- ,  -                 1 late afternoon sky, a red tile roof and the Santa Barbara coast line frame this party of old friends
trio plays Brazilian music as guests carry drinks and nibble on dessert
2    -                                   2 The Couple who live in this house,   , drink champagne as they chat with their closest friends, is mid-fifties and has embraced that fact
She knows 50 is not the new 40 and because of that, she is still described by all who know her as beautiful
Everything about this woman's appearance screams "solid
" The years have been good to
He's never lost his looks, his killer smile, or his ability to charm
He lifts his glass of champagne
Happy happy happy
(reminding him) -- Anniversary
Jake pauses, wryly turns to Jane, making her smile
Some things never change
Thank God
thought maybe you were drifting
He was pausing
Exactly
(sighs, raising his glass) Happy
Anniversary
You two have led an extraordinarily blessed life
() 2
(cont'd) As long as 've known you both, you've always managed to somehow do everything entirely right
-- That's so true
But, honestly, how can it be thirty years
When did we do that trip to Spain
(looks to Jane) It was for both of our what
-- Fifteenth anniversaries
God, that was a great trip
The Two Women exchange a quick look when a tall,  21 joins the group, holding a bottle of beer
This is , Sally and Ted's son
All four light up as Oliver puts his arm around his Mom
Ollie, how was graduation
It was fantastic
can't believe 'm not in school anymore
When's Luke's graduation
Next week
(correcting him) It's in three days
Sorry
mean this week
Are the girls going
They can't wait
Jane glances across the party and sees , in her thirties, wearing a sarong over a bathing suit and walking directly toward them
She carries a slice of cake
Jane becomes instantly distracted and uncomfortable
3
How long is Luke home before he has to go back for work
-- Only a week
Aw, that's it
know,  hate it
Well
(Agness joins the group, standing next to Jake) Congrats again
(puts down her champagne) Great party
You're leaving
Yeah,  have some (Agness hands Jake a piece of cake
Jane works hard at not appearing flustered) -- stuff  have to get done tonight for work
(to Jake & Agness) 'll see you two in New York
Absolutely
Lookin' forward to it
Good
Well
-- Jane, what are you wearing to the graduation
Oh, a suit or dress, probably a suit
Fancy
Okay
Jane smiles tightly, raises her eyebrows to Sally
4
See you there, Janey
Where are you staying again
We're at The Park Regent
You said you were at The Four Seasons, right
don't know
(to Agness) Where are we
We're at The Park Regent too
(hates    this) Oh
Good
That'll be convenient, actually
Okay, so, see you soon
(waves    awkwardly) -- 'll walk you out
As they  , they : So, Ted, do you think you can help us get Pedro into El Montecito for kindergarten
-    - (laughs) thought it was sweet how well you and Jake were getting along
Felt like old times
Yeah, well, we know how to do this by now
It has been ten years
That's crazy
Jane hugs Sally good bye, her eyes landing on Agness affectionately rubbing Jake's back
5
- as it closes after Jane
- and sees Jane is gone
: 3   -                                      3 in jeans and a tank top     , Gabby is Jane and Jake's middle child
But unlike most middle children, this one has never suffered from being ignored
Not a possibility with Jane as your mother
We are: '  - The house is modest and charming and sits on a few acres in the lush green hills of Santa Barbara
Neat rows of vegetables dot the landscape
Gabby arrives at her already packed Prius, where her , , 26, is trying to fit everything into the trunk
Lauren is more conservatively dressed than Gabby and has an air of maturity about her
Gabby, stop
you're never going to fit all this in
you can come back for the rest tomorrow
can't come back t--- Gabby looks up to see , ' , in a -shirt and over-the-knee gym shorts, lugging a huge suitcase down the front path, a duffel strapped across his chest
Oh, God
that's all my clothes
(sets the suitcase down as he sees an  heading to the house) () 6
(cont'd) Okay, your Mom is home
She'll figure this out
The  pulls to a stop, Jane gets out
Gabby starts pulling cartons out of her trunk to make room for her clothes
Gabby, you're leaving now thought you were going in the morning
know but my friends are all there and they wanted me to come tonight
But honey, it's gonna get dark soon
You can't see out the back window
It's Saturday night
People will be on the road drinking
Mom, she'll be there in a couple of hours, she'll be fine
Okay, 'm leaving this stuff here
'll be back for it in a few days
Want me to drive it down in the morning
(Gabby's , she laughs, thumbs flying) could be there by lunch
We could go to that big Bed, Bath, and Beyond, buy kitchen stuff
Gabby, can you look up from that thing
(looking up) got it covered, Ma
(to Harley) Hey gangsta, help me carry these
(exhausted) Yep
Gabby and Harley    back into the house
Jane seems worried as she watches them
7
Mom, are you afraid to sleep in the house alone
What are you
No
(Lauren looks doubtful) -- 'm not
One of you is always moving out
(Gabby re-joins) But  am wondering who 'm gonna watch The Hills with
(huge hug) Mamacita
'm gonna miss you
Jane hugs her back, but is aware of not hugging too hard
Harley joins the group
Omigod
Okay
'm doing this
(walks to her car) Mom, you don't happen to know where Dad is, do you
tried calling him to say goodbye
He was at Sally and Ted's
He was
How was that
You and them at the same -- (Jane turns to him) -- not that it's in any way, any of my
was just
-- It was
(notices both girls wait for her answer) -- whatever
It was fine
Was her lunatic child there
(laughs) Not this time
Gabby, call me when you get there
Do  forget
() 8
(cont'd) (Gabby texts, deep in convo ) Gabby
will
'll call you
Knock `em dead, little one
And call us when you get there, too
And no texting and driving
Jane loves that Harley said that
Gabby gets in her car and starts off
(puts his arm around Jane's shoulder) They grow up so friggin' fast hate it
Gabby pulls out of the driveway and out of sight
Maybe you should get a dog
Oh my God
Goodbye you two
Love you
(heading for their car and getting into the passenger seat) Love you boss
As Lauren and Harley drive off,    Jane turns and looks at her suddenly very empty nest
4
'  -                                     4 Woman's house
Books and art collected over years
Interesting, unexpected pieces of furniture
Jane kicks off her heels, now feeling short and alone
Deep breath
5
5 Cramped, but clearly a cook's kitchen
The Kids have left a few glasses and plates on the island
9
Jane gathers them and as she rinses them at the sink, she suddenly and surprisingly feels very alone
She pauses, allows herself the moment, then forces herself to snap out of it
7
-  -                              7 This is Jane's other home
large, bright, bustling /
The bakery counter could rival any in Paris
Last year, The New York Times rated Jane's pain au chocolat the best in the United States
line waits to get in
very relaxed Jane is behind the busy counter, easily moving between her young staff
The atmosphere is efficient and friendly
Jane adjusts a few signs on the counter, then reaches inside the display case, pulling out a tray of muffins topped with powdered sugar
She carries the tray to the open pass- through to the   and calls to the head Baker
Reynaldo
(nods to the muffins) Too much sugar
Little bit
Reynaldo nods as Jane hands him the tray
Jane notices a line waiting to get up to the bakery counter
Knowing what to do, Jane's staff has already set out cups of coffee with lids
Who wants coffee while they're waiting
Jane and the staff hand out the free coffee
- refills a glass of water, checking on her customers
(quietly to a Young Employee) Check on table five, will you
10
The Young Employee nods as Jane looks up and sees a  on the other side of the counter
They exchange polite hellos when Jane notices , tan and confident, approaching her
(all smiles) Peter
joins , the man who stands across from Jane
Adam is handsome in a way that sneaks up on you
There's something reserved and refreshing about his demeanor
He holds rolled blueprints
Jane,  can't remember, have you ever met Adam Schaeffer
No
Yes
Well
(shrugs awkwardly ) Look what we've got
(raises the blueprints) Your plans
(to Peter) So excited
8
'   -                 8 farmhouse table almost fills the room
On the walls, posters for Jane's two cookbooks, framed food photos and a few reviews
Jane, Peter, and Adam sit around the table as Adam rolls out the blueprints in front of Jane
(before she looks) 've been thinking about this addition for ten years
Peter and Adam watch as Jane's eagle eye examines the plan
11
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Oh, niiice like this wall of windows, Peter
That was Adam actually
Oh
(still perusing, then to Peter) Love where you put the stairs
That's so good
Adam's idea
Did she hear that
Oh my God, the kitchen
Finally - have a real kitchen with four walls
It's
oh, wow
you actually understood what  wanted
Jane looks to Peter with enormous appreciation
Peter looks to Adam
All Adam
Jane turns to Adam
'm happy you like it
(finally noticing him) Okay
Hi
(shakes his hand) (laughs) Hello
You read all my e-mails
All 47 of them
12
Jane smiles as her Office Manager sticks her head in the door
Jane, it's 10:15
It is
(rises) Oh, sorry,  have a 10:30
dentist
Can you leave these and 'll make a few notes
Well, actually,  have one tiny note now
(to Adam, re: plan) In my bathroom
um
no his and her sinks
Okay, sure
No his
Just hers
And you don't think in the future you might want a his
Oh, God, we're talking code about my life, right
(laughs) No, no, didn't mean to be
The truth is, in my current bathroom,  have two sinks and sometimes the other sink makes me feel bad
One sink
Not a problem
Can we schedule a meeting for next week
Does Tuesday work for you
Tuesday's great
Eight-thirty too early
At the house
'll be there
13
9
'  -                               9 Way too chic for a dentist's office
Jane sits nervously in a chair in a well styled, well upholstered examination room
The door opens quickly and a handsome, crisp looking Hi
Hi
'm Dr
Moss
(shaking his hand) Hi
Jane Adler
So,  just wanted to start with
and please don't take this the wrong way but 'm the type of person who kind of makes fun of people who get plastic surgery
understand
You do
Good, because, you know, some women can look a little fake and plasticky
And in my opinion -- worse
agree
Oh, that's good, so, well, as against the whole thing as  am, do have a problem that's been bugging me
My left eyelid is really saggy
find 'm sometimes holding it up when 'm watching or reading and  was wondering if that's something you could fix
(looking at her closely) It's resting on your eye lashes
Is it
14
(measures her lids with a very tiny ruler) Actually you have the same amount of excess skin on both sides
do
Well, 'm only interested in fixing one eye
Jane, what you need to fix this is a brow lift
brow lift
Wh-what is that exactly
We surgically cut at your hair line
Incision goes right across here
(demonstrates on himself by indicating a line drawn like a headband) Then we just lift the skin up a little tighter across the skull
(Jane nods, already hating this) We staple it back in place right above your ears
Recovery isn't all that bad but you could be fairly numb and you'll probably have a headache that lasts anywhere from say 3 to 6 months
10
10 Jane flies into the elevator, out of breath and a little nauseous
She taps on the Lobby button
The elevator moves down
The   and Jane looks into an empty hallway, facing a  that reads, Santa Barbara Fertility Center
Helping Couples Become Parents
Jane hears someone is about to get on the elevator, steps back toward the corner
messy looking 5 dashes in
Jane recognizes him
She looks up and Jake and his wife, Agness, in oversized dark shades and a long black dress (very Angelina Jolie) get on the elevator, obviously mid-argument
15
Agness' mood seems very dark today
They instantly shut up when they realize Jane is in the elevator
Jane
-- Hey
Hiii
Hello
(pushing the Lobby button, mumbles) -- Perfect
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake
Jake
Hold on Pedro, 'm talking to someone
Pedro sits on the floor, crashing into the back wall of the elevator
Pedro, up
Now
(she snaps) Jane unconsciously holds up her left eyebrow
What are you doing in this building
Dentist
You don't go to Sharon anymore
Uh, no
changed
Jane looks at the fertility literature in Jake's hand just as Jake slips it behind his back
An awful two seconds of silence, then Jane notices a tattoo of a tiger on Agness' back
It creeps her out
16
Jake catches Jane's reaction, then thank God the doors open
Jake leans down and picks up Pedro who instantly climbs up his back
Honey, don't do that
11   As they all   , Pedro has now made his way up 11 to Jake's shoulders
Think chimpanzee
Agness' cell and as she answers it -- -- See you in the Big Apple
Pedro is now resting on Jake's head
(trying to be nonchalant with a kid on his head, smiles) See you there
12
' /  -                12 Jane and     are mid-meal
The wine is flowing and the women are laughing
has happily never been married
is widowed and  is divorced
They are all Jane's age and have been friends forever
That is beyond
(laughing) -- When the three of them got in the elevator
between that and the staples and the headache for six months
it was the most insane hour of my life
-- Jake has lost his mind
Oh,  don't know
know
First of all, he was a complete prick for cheating on you
Well, can't disagree with that
17
And then he marries her
a known lunatic
She has a big job
Why do you always say that
Because she does
She runs the whole marketing department at , whatever that station's called so she's not that big of a lunatic
Janey, come on, he cheats on you with her, your 20 year marriage ends then six months later she leaves Jake for some random guy, has a baby, leaves that guy, marries Jake and she's not nuts
(groans) Jo, you're so lucky Jerry's dead
Oh, thanks
No,  mean, you never have to bump into him
That's true
(rises to get more wine) Janey, you want to meet a guy  met on Match
com that  didn't like
Gee, what a great offer
don't think so
He wasn't that awful
Oooo
Sounding better every minute
18
Trisha stops at Jane's seat, refilling Jane's wine glass
You know it's not healthy not to have sex for
however long it's been
Trust me
'm not not doing it on purpose
Okay
don't know if this is true, but  read on line about this woman who hadn't done it in so long her vagina closed up
What
Get out of here
All the Women
swear to God
It grew back together
Wait
Was it ever one piece
All  know is, she had to have a vaginaplasty
Ouch
Oh my Goddddddd
Jane flops over on the table, laughing, resting her head
(lifts her head, then talks as if she's in the doctor's office) "Dr
Moss, Hi
have a little situation that needs fixing
" Bubbee, you want to fix your situation
Just date someone
Seriously
Anyone
19
As Jane takes that in, we: : 16
-  -                         16 Park Avenue to find Jane, the Girls and Harley, just out of a Cab
The Bellman is taking their luggage as the Girls spot their brother, , heading toward them
Lauren and Gabby run to Luke, hug him, commenting on his hair, his shoes, his jeans, his tan
Jane lights up when she sees her son, hugs him incredibly hard, kisses his cheek, then another tight squeeze
Love when we're all in the same time zone
A17
-                  A17 They all cross    toward the
So, what's up Luke
Did you decide to have the party
Oh, yeah
Big time
What party
Are you guys gonna sleep over
If you give us your bed and change the sheets
They arrive at
You're having a party
When
(to Reception Clerk) Hi
Adler
Two rooms
hopefully next to each other
20
have an Adler,
in a Superior Suite, Park Avenue view
Oh, 'm sorry, here it is
Adler  -- two Standard Doubles
Sorry about that
Yeah, we're not the ones in the Superior Suite
Have the other Adlers checked in yet
Just wondering
No, they haven't, ma'am
Not yet
Now  just need a credit card and your signature
As Jane takes out her credit card
-- Mom, is it okay if the girls come with me now and help me set up
And by girls he means the three of us
Wait
Hold on
Set up what
have reservations for all of us for dinner
That's not happening now
don't know
Me and my friends are having this huge thing at our apartment and the girls said they'd help us set up
(sees her disappointment) We're going to be together all day tomorrow
-- Mom, it's his last night before graduation
Okay, okay
Do you want me to help or
21
(super sweetly) -- Love your credit card
17
-                        17 Jane rides the elevator carrying both girls' jackets and carry ons as well as her own
Just as the doors are about to close, a Good Looking Couple in their early forties gets on
As they go up
The Guy has his hand around the woman's waist, his fingers fanning her butt
The Couple looks at each other, smiling privately
Jane looks away
18
'  - 20                        18 Two double beds
Jane lies on top of one of the beds, fully dressed, shoes off, eyes wide open
20
-   -         20 Jane  the hotel's posh bar/restaurant
(to Host) Hi
Adler
One
Hi
Your table's almost ready Mrs
Adler
Would you like to wait at the bar
(trying to read upside down reservation list) Sure
You don't happen to have another Adler coming in, do you
Adler for two
(perusing) No
You're our only Adler this evening
(relieved) Thanks
- Jane takes a seat next to Two Hot Younger Women
22
(to Bartender) Pinot Noir, please
No, you know what
'll have a Tanqueray Martini very dry with a twist
Jane strums the bar top, checks out the room
It's fun being in a big city
Her martini arrives, she takes a sip and something very familiar
Jake's laugh
She looks across the bar and sees Jake talking to the bartender
He seems to be alone
Jane waves
Jake notices her and smiles
Where's your
Jake picks up his drink and carries it to the bar stool next to Jane
Pedro got the stomach flu so 'm flying solo
Really
Didn't know you knew how to be by yourself
Any chance you could just go easy on me
Just a one night free pass
(noticing her) You look good, Janey
Yeah
You do
You always do
Your hair's shorter
Longer
like it
The Host joins them
Mrs
Adler, your table's ready
Want some company, Mrs
Adler
23
Jane gives Jake a doubtful look
-- We both have to eat
(sees Jane is hesitating) When's the last time we ate a meal together
(thinks for a sec) Just the two of us
Alone
1999
So, come on
Once every ten years
21                                                21 New drinks arrive for Jane and Jake
Physically, they're sitting as close as they've been in a decade
So
how are things in the fertility world
(checks watch) can't believe it took you this long to bring that up
(trying not to laugh) Sperm issues
Apparently
Yes
baby
Really Jake
So
the next time you go to a graduation, you'll be what
Fifty-eight plus
(tries to do the math) --  think the number you're looking for is 79
Okay
So
Seriously, how is that good
Why are we talking about this thought we were going to have fun
24
Where'd you get that idea
22                                           22 and poured
The bar has filled up and Jane and Jake are sitting a little closer together
-- Just tell me, how long were you seeing him for
Oh, please, it was five years ago
know but  always wondered so
Little jealous
Yes
The man's married now
don't care
How long
Eight months
(surprised) Long
Not long
A23                                                         A23 The bar is now crowded
Jane and Jake are finally eating but still drinking
Jake is telling Jane a long story and she can't stop laughing
23                                                            23 24                                                      24 spins for the after dinner crowd
Couples dance on the dance floor
Jane and Jake both react to the song
25
This song reminds me of your birthday party
the one in our old house
-- Oh, yeah
That was such a fun night
So fun
You wore that white halter dress
(remembering) Oh, yeahhhh
(remembering it all, looks at Jake with a longing for her own past
) Want to dance
-- No
25      -                            25 Jake and Jane are dancing
it's familiar yet with the blush of the new
Something's going on here
Jake starts singing
Jane joins in
This is by far, the loosest we've seen her
Of course, it helps that she's drunk
They dance around one another without inhibition
mating dance
(astonished, laughing) You're married to someone else
Tell me about it
They both laugh then Jake pulls Jane close
(sexy
) Hey
know you
26
(looking deeply into her) And  know you
: 26
'  -                                     26 They're in bed and they've done it
They're not even entirely undressed
They're spent, sweaty, breathing heavily
Jake cups his hand on Jane's vagina, gives it a solid pat and hold
Home sweet home
Oh
God
Jane covers her face
That was one crazy ride
thought we were going to break the bed
(not looking good) -- 'm having an out of body experience
Totally
You're so great, Janey forgot how great
Holy shit
Please shut up
'm so dizzy
And the pilates are payin' off by the way
Jane moans,     , leans over and throws up into it
Oh no
Jane woozily sits up on her side of the bed, her back to Jake
Jake looks over at her
You okay
27
(starting to rise) Look the other way
Why
`Cause  have to get up
Jane
know what you
Look the other way Jake
As Jake turns away, Jane runs to the bathroom, carrying a pillow covering her bare ass
Jake hears her throw up again
He winces
27
27 Jane sits on the floor, by the toilet, looking wiped out
Jake gingerly steps into the bathroom, hair a mess, wearing boxer shorts and his unbuttoned shirt
(looking up at him) is wrong with us
What do you mean
This was amazing
We just had a great time
great time
This is the dumbest thing two people have ever done
(giant moan
) Jake sits on the edge of the tub
This is news to him
Really
don't know
haven't thought it out, but off the top of my head 'd say it was smokin' hot so something about it wasn't so dumb
(she stares up at him, sick as a dog) And, ,  like that you stopped getting bikini waxes
You've gone native
was into it
28
Horrified, Jane lets out a yelp on her way to throwing up again
28
-                28 The  Band plays Pomp and Circumstance as the Graduating Class of `09    in caps and gowns
All the families in the bleachers are on their feet, applauding
29    -                                             29 Jane, in sunglasses, is sobbing, taking photos
Next to her are Gabby, Harley and Lauren, hooting, clapping and screaming, "There he is
" And next in line is Jake manning the video camera, wiping away tears
, Luke spots his gang in the bleachers and gives a broad bow
The Adlers go crazy, especially Jane, who does a finger whistle
Jake looks over at Jane with puppy dog eyes
The girls notice, assuming their Dad is emotional over the ceremony
Jane feels Jake's glare but won't dare look over at him
Gabby nudges her Mom to look over at Dad
Jane turns his way, sees that look in his eyes and starts to bawl
30
-  -                                   30 The Family celebrates over lunch
Luke is telling a funny story about something that happened on stage at graduation
Jane is the only one not fully chiming in and laughing
She can't seem to move beyond what happened last night
(sotto) You okay
Yeah
Totally
Jake slips off his shoe and rubs his foot up Jane's leg and under her skirt
Jane jumps, quickly turning it into a reaction to Luke's story
She gives Jake a private stare that says, "stop or 'll kill you
" 29
would like to propose a toast to your Mother
(what
) To me
've done my part with you guys, but Jane
you -- very talented you
Oh, God
Gabby, 'm serious
Jane, you did a magnificent job, as you always do
The Kids look at one another
what's this about
When  look at the three of you beautiful kids
all grown up, think of all the work your mother did, much of it without my help
(starts to well up) Dude
pull it together
-- Janey,  take my hat off to you
Okay, Jake
Thank you
Out of nowhere, sudden appreciation
But thank you
Really
Not totally out of nowhere, Jane
if you know what  mean
(quickly) Which  don't
but
What's he
30
-- Have no idea
Let's move on, shall we
Jane holds up her droopy left eye
'd like to say something too
For real
No offense to the lovely Agness or her charming offspring
(the Kids stifle laughs) -- Not nice
Harley stops laughing
know
'm sorry
But  just want to say  really loved today, just being with the original five
(Luke nods in agreement) -- plus Harley, but he's like one of us
don't think we've ever done this before
Had a meal together
And hung out like this
You mean other than the first 13 years of your life
know what's she saying
It's been awesome
just for a whole day to be just
us
They all reflect on that one
31
-                           31 The Adlers are at the Reception Desk
Jane and Jake are next to each other, signing their credit card receipts, the Kids chat behind them
(to Jane) Something feels right in the universe again, doesn't it
Jane looks at him but doesn't answer
She turns to the Kids
31
So who's coming home when
No one's told me the details
Jake's
Jane half listens to his conversation
(into cell) Hey
(turns away) How's Pedro feeling
Distracted, Jane focuses on Lauren
(responding to "Pedro") Okay, we're gonna help pack Luke up, the three of us leave day after tomorrow and Luke's home the end of the week
(rejoins, finishing his call) --  will
Call you when  land
(slips cell away, not missing a beat) Janey, what flight are you on
'm on the uh, the four o'clock
Ah, too bad
'm on the five o'clock
That's nuts, why don't you try to get on the same flight
Yeah,  could try
It's been
great, but let's not push it
He was just trying to be nice
know
Okay, 've got to hit the road, guys
() 32
(cont'd) (kisses each kid as they line up) Thanks for staying
So proud of you
Be good
Call me if you need me
(she arrives at Jake, pauses, speechless) (kisses her cheek) It was really fun
(painfully) It was
: 32                                                           32 33                                                           33 34        -   -              34 We are looking    and listening to a (
) -- Just follow a few basic rules to make your divorce a less hurtful one by breaking the cycle of conflict
- (
) Accept your ex, for who she is
very big ho
(
) And try to remember when you fell in love and
(spotting something) -- There she goes
33
'  - jogging right past his car, listening to her iPod
Jane
She doesn't hear him
Adam backs up next to her
Jane slows down
Adam lowers the passenger window
She looks in, doesn't recognize him at first
It's Adam
It's 8:30 Tuesday morning
Are we still okay
Yes
Totally forgot
'm so sorry
Can you give me a lift back to the house
(quickly cleaning up the front seat) Sure
come on in
Jane     just in time to hear: (
) -- But perhaps the most important lesson in going through your divorce is to learn to forgive
Forgiveness is the key to-- Adam hits the   to turn the  , but instead he accidentally
(
) In spite of your hurt feelings, prove to her that you can be a mature-- Adam    again and this time, turns it , a bit mortified
Just getting a divorce
34
Yeah
(then) Two and a half years ago
Wooo
(embarrassed) It's been a process
Here's the good news
In two more years you'll actually begin to feel normal again
In two more years 'll begin to feel normal
Why am  having trouble seeing that as good news
Maybe that was just my experience
Oh God,  hope so
35
-                                          35 Blue prints are spread on a garden table
Adam is drawing as Jane watches
-- So if we move this wall back a bit, that can bring the arch forward, which is where you really want it, right
Yes, 'd love that
(sketching) Thought so
have an idea
what if we move my bedroom like six or eight feet so  can get more of the morning light
() 35
(cont'd) (sees Adam hesitate) Not possible
-- Yes, but you'll wake up in the morning, open your bedroom door and fall 12 feet into your kitchen
Ahhh
Forgot it was all open up there
But  get where you're headed
Let me see what  can do
This property is so great
Have you lived here a long time
About ten years
bought this place right after my divorce but it's taken me until now to be able to finally do this
Jane and Adam are distracted when a Porsche noisily pulls up and Jake gets out wearing a suit and a chipper attitude
Good morning
(to Jane) Am  interrupting
(thrown that   he's here) Hi
No, well, we   were just about done
Adam, this   is my ex-husband, Jake
Jake, this   is Adam Schaeffer, my architect
Hi
(they shake hands) Good to meet you
(re: plans) Can  take a look
Do you mind
Adam looks to Jane for approval but too late, Jake's already looking
36
Everything's not 100% worked out yet
Wow
You're finally getting the kitchen you always wanted
Yeah
Huge bedroom
It's not huge
(suddenly insecure) Why don't  show these to you when we get a little closer
Jane starts to roll up the blueprints, fumbles a little
Adam finishes for her
She thanks him with her eyes
So,  think next we should stake out the addition
see how it all feels - size wise
Sounds great
'll e-mail you and we'll set it up
We did good work today
Jake, nice meeting you
Jake smiles and waves as Adam exits, walking to his car
(turns to Jane) Got time for a cup of coffee
Adam can't help but sneak a look back at them
Jane waves, a bit embarrassed
36
'  -                            36 Jane moves nervously around the kitchen, opening the fridge, taking out juice
37
Why haven't you returned any of my calls or e-mails
Jake, come on
This is just too weird
We have to just never do what we did - ever again
You're an adulterer and 'm an awful person, basically
haven't slept in days
What we did was just so wrong on so many levels
And it was so right on a couple of levels too
Admit it
(finally settles) No
It wasn't
On no levels was it right
You can't say we didn't enjoy each other's company
Sitting at the bar, dancing
after dancing
(she doesn't want to be reminded) Come on, you and  haven't had fun like that in a hundred years
Yes
Because we're not supposed to have fun like that
We're divorced
Are you like, what
Unhappy at home
Does she not "understand" you
Did you just want to know what it would be like with someone my age
What is this
'd be lying if  said  never think about you, Janey
think about you
lot
And no, it's not perfect at home
Obviously
Look at me
've got three grown kids and 'm going to kindergarten interviews
'm a walking cliche
Jane shrugs
She agrees
38
And  can't, literally can't stop thinking about what happened in New York
Fate brought us together once, maybe it happened again
(she pauses
) And  know
you've moved on with your life,  get it, but you can't deny something real and honest happened that night
Can't we just go with it, see where it takes us
No one has to know
(Jane shudders) You were so great
So loose and sexy
How often do you get to be like that
You can run and open restaurants and build your perfect kitchen but what about having someone to hold you in the middle of the night
Not high on my list these days
But what if that someone is someone who's known you since you're 23 and loved you for most of your life
forgot what a good lawyer you are
Give this a shot, Janey
Life is short and it's tough
Don't discount what we have with each other
(he's getting to her) You know what they say
people in nursing homes who have plants live longer than the people without plants
Oh, so you're saying you think this is a healthy choice for me
Honey,  know it is
39
37
'  -                      37 And the plants get watered
38
'  -                           38 Jane and Jake have done it again
In broad daylight and sober
They catch their breath
Oh, God, it's official
We're having an affair
Why do you need to label everything
Because that's what this is
Yes, in its crassest form, maybe, if we were two other people
Just because we were married for 19 years does not not make this an affair
Okay, but since we were together for so long, it's not really that wrong
Really
You want to run that logic by your wife
Jane fans herself
Do me a favor, you're on my side
Can we switch
feel disoriented
Since when is this your side
Since ten years ago
Please
40
They switch sides
In the middle of this maneuver Jake lands on top of Jane
He pauses
Could  interest you in a little
No
They flop onto the opposite sides of the bed
Jane fans herself
So hot
(turns to her) Why do you think the sex is so much sexier this time
don't know
Jane pulls the sheet up
They look at one another
He gets her to smile
've gotta get to work
Me too
Okay
(moans as he sits up, then rises) Jake starts to get dressed
Jane watches him from bed, checking out his stomach
He notices
(indicating his belly) See what happens when you're not looking out for me
(pats it) She lets me eat everything
pasta, cream cheese
Can you hand me my robe
Jake reaches for Jane's robe, hands it to her
She indicates Jake should turn around
Why do  have to
41
-- Because the last time you saw me standing up naked  was in my forties
(Jake can't believe this) Things look different lying down
Just
Jake rolls his eyes, turning away from her
You've gotten a little nuts
(slipping into her robe) Jake,  think it would be really good for us to not talk for a few days
Okay
(turning back to her) You know what  think -- just for the record
think we're doing something kinda brilliant
All the things that tore us apart aren't issues anymore
'd say our problems actually went away
What
Didn't you always say you felt you weren't being heard
Wasn't that our big issue -- both of us always feeling rejected and unappreciated
Look at us now
You're so much more together, you're not exhausted all the time, you're not catering every weekend and busy all day with the kids and 'm calmer, less obsessed about work
'm a partner
'm there
We grew into the people we wanted each other to be
And don't know
appreciate things about you  couldn't even see before
(not wanting to get into it) Really
() 42
(cont'd) Well, you know, 'm not as good as you at remembering all the details of our
(getting dressed) -- Do you remember never having time for sex
Now look at us
We've already done it two times this week and it's only Tuesday swear to God, if half the couples who got divorced, could get back together 10 years later, their problems would be solved
think we're on to something
Not sure  agree and
also, we're not back together
And  know other divorced people think about this
they wonder - what if
(fixes his tie) think this is very French of us
How is this French of us
have a young wife but 'm having sex with my old wife
Not old, you know
Ex
(Jane nods
) didn't mean old
39   Jane tosses Jake his jacket
They  the  and head 39 toward
You're doing that thing where you act like you're not listening
but think about what 'm saying, okay
(then) Do you have any of your homemade granola here
haven't had it in so long
You miss it
43
So much
We sell it for $6
50 a bag at the store
Yeah, why give it away when you can
(Jane  the front door and moves him outside) Kiss good bye
Jane kisses him on the cheek
She wants to be courted
(as he heads for his car) can do that
(turns back) And honey, thanks for the
(indicates sex with his fingers) -- Coffee
Jane can't close the door fast enough
40
'  -                                 40 Jane carries three beautiful homemade pies, arriving in where her Friends are gathered
Platters of food and open bottles of wine are on the coffee table
Oh my God, now what
Three pies
This is a feast
don't know what's going on, have so much energy lately which think is probably a result of
all the sex 'm having
(the Ladies ) Yeah
'm actually not kidding
'm having an affair
(They stare at her) With a married man
44
What
When did this happen
Where'd you meet him
Well, it
started in New York
In New York
Last week
Yeah, we did it once there and once here
Maybe more than once there, was drunk so
You had drunken sex with a married man in New York when you went for Luke's graduation
(laughs, embarrassed) Turns out 'm a bit of a slut
(re: pies) Apple, Blueberry or Plum
Wait, wait, wait
Hold on
You're not saying
(clueless) -- What
(catching on) No
You're not
Oh, God, but  am
'm having an affair with Agness Adler's husband
The Women all  as Jane fans herself
That
Is
Genius
But also sort of wrong
know
45
Oh, please
Not that wrong
know
'm so happy to be able to tell someone
This is the most out of control thing 've ever done
Literally
You know me
Yes we do
You don't do anything wrong, or bad
Ever
So you're allowed this one
'm sorry kinda love it
He was yours first
True
Not that  want him back by the way
Of course not
You can do better than Jake
(a little insulted) Thanks
mean you've outgrown him
You've blossomed, you feng shuied your whole life
Just please, don't let him talk you into saving him
won't
(wonders what that means) There is something kinda perfect about this
You don't have to cook for him or clean up after him or actually even sleep with him
Yeah,  have an Ex with benefits
46
(') But, girls, what about the fact that 'm now the other woman
'm the one we hate
Oh, forget that
Agness is still the one we hate
Even in this scenario
Yeah, karma is the ultimate bitch on this one
41
-                                  41 Jane walks through the busy kitchen holding a sheet of paper
Her shirt is a little more fitted
Her make up, a little prettier
She crosses to the head Baker who's just taking a tray of cookies out of the oven
Reynaldo, 'm changing the breakfast menu, want to give it a little more life
(shows it to him, he seems distracted) What do you think
(distracted) -- What'd you do
Something to your hair
don't think so
Something about you looks different
Little more "caliente
" Caliente
Another Chef in the kitchen nods in agreement
You see it Eddie
Whatever it is, it's workin'
47
He winks at Jane as he stirs cookie batter
Jane blushes as her cell phone rings
Hello
(listens) No
didn't do this again
42
'     -                           42 on Adam, waiting by a ladder in the middle of the field
Jane's addition is staked out with orange tape
- Rushing toward Adam
Adam, 'm so sorry
My mind is just
Forgive me
If  were your shrink 'd say maybe you don't really want to build this house
That's completely not true
'm really sorry
(looks at taped off addition) Oh
like it already
Yeah, it's feeling really good
So, this becomes your office
We come down your new hallway, the windows are all along here
Great
Love it
And from here to there
wait, let me get the door for you
(opens a piece of tape) Your kitchen
(they ) We're in the eating area
How's the size
(pretends to sit) We're at either end of the table
48
(laughs at Adam) Feels perfect
thought so too
(taking it all in) This is heaven
It's gonna be cool
Want to go upstairs
43                               43 So if you were lying in bed, this would be your view
Jane breaks into a smile
-    -- Over this tranquil view --
Jane takes her phone out of her pocket, sees it's Jake calling
She pauses, then pushes "" and then promptly loses her balance
Adam immediately reaches over and steadies her
You okay
(grabs her heart) Yeah
: 44
- '  -                      44 Water is running in the sink, even though no one's at the sink
Jake is in the shower stall, fully dressed, putting away his cell
He quietly pushes the shower door open and then carefully shuts it with a small snap
Jake fake coughs and then turns off the sink water
He checks his watch when he hears   in another room then hears Agness calling his name in anger
He leaps
49
Coming
Jake quietly     and  to find his path is blocked by Pedro who sits on a tricycle staring up at him
What were you doing in there
Going to the bathroom
The toilet didn't flush
Yes it did
Why were you in the shower with your clothes on
(making sure Agness doesn't hear) What are you talking about
heard the shower door close
What do you have, x-ray ears
Agness joins in briefs and a white tank, black bra peeking through
She holds a broom
What's up Pedro
Jake took a shower with his clothes on
Pedro
Darling
What's he talking about
don't speak Pedro
That's your department
50
(to Pedro) Don't go in the kitchen, ,  broke something
(to Jake, annoyed) Yo
Can you help
Agness  back to the kitchen as Pedro stares at Jake
: 45     - -            45 These open-faced fancy French Grilled Cheese Sandwiches are carried to Jane's counter
We're: '  - Jane very professionally places the Croque-Monsieurs onto two waiting plates, adds some salad on the side
Adam stands nearby with a glass of wine, jacket off
That looks amazing
It's called a croque-monsieur
It's one of the first things  learned to make when  lived in Paris because the ingredients are really really cheap
When did you live in Paris
In my early twenties
went there to take a six day pastry class and ended up staying a year working as an apprentice in a bakery
Jane places the plates    as she and Adam Jane raises her wine glass
Thank you for taking my 47 e-mails and turning them into something so beautiful
51
You are rapidly becoming one of the most appreciative clients 've ever had
Well, 'm not all that used to being able to count on anyone
(surprised by that) Really
46     -                                    46 He squints, looking ahead, : '  - And Adam's car parked out front
Jake turns , slowly pulling around to the side of the house
47
'  -                         47 know it's none of my business but
'm trying to figure out why someone like you is divorced
And what'd you come up with
Something in the you're too nice department
Yes, that and my wife fell in love with my best friend
Ex-best friend
Oh, no
We were all on a biking trip, he and his wife, me and my wife
through Tuscany and on the last day of the trip they announced they were in love
52
That's awful
Yeah
Not a great plane ride home
can imagine, sitting there for eleven hours with your wife who you know is -- oh, that's rough
Actually they went on to Venice and flew back with Carol, his wife
You can't imagine what it's like to sit next to someone who's been crying for ten straight hours
don't blame her
was talking about me
Anyway, they're married now and it's pretty much an ongoing awful thing
But, you and your ex
When  saw him stop by for a cup of coffee the other morning,  thought -- Wow
That's the way it's supposed to be
You two seem to have it all figured out
We're not as figured out as you'd think
48
-                                        48 Jake, in work-out clothes, sprints across the front lawn, careful not to be seen
49                                                    49 Jane clears their dishes
(laughs) You know  hope you don't feel 've been interrogating you, but
() 53
(cont'd) know what it's like to have your ex remarried and to not have so much going on in that department
mean, do you date ever or
Uh, constantly actually
Constantly
Everyone  know or have ever known has fixed me up
And then, sometimes  just meet women, don't know how that happens, but
-- But no girlfriend
Not yet
Jane stands        and hands Adam another croque-monsieur
She stays on her side, like a waitress at a counter
She refills his water glass
Just like to date
Actually,  find it really stressful
You know, the last time was in the dating world was 1978
It's a little more complicated these days
can't tell you how nice it is to have a conversation with a woman and have the pressure off
Not to mention, a home cooked meal that no one else  know could possibly cook
Jane's not sure if she feels a little hurt by that
She smiles, wiping the counter
That was a compliment
So you don't have a guy in your life at the moment
No
(starts to say something
) No
54
No
'  - Jake rises from the bushes outside of Jane's Kitchen Window
He  in the window, balancing himself precariously on a stack of loose bricks
He sees Jane telling Adam a story and both of them cracking up
Jake leans in further to try to hear what Jane's saying when the bricks slip under his feet, he loses his balance and drops
51
'  -                                  51 Jane walks Adam to the door
He holds rolled blueprints
This was so nice and relaxing and the lavender ice cream was actually the best dessert of any sort 've ever had
like, in my life
Aw, thank you
always make ice cream when  can't sleep, so 'm glad someone was here to eat it
(opens door) (pauses
) Great getting to know you a little
(nods) It was really fun
Adam waves, Jane waves
Definitely a little sweet/awkward
Jane closes her door, starts turning out lights, heading for the kitchen, when there's a   on the
Woops
Coming
Jane quickly returns to the door and opens it to find: leaning in the door frame
55
thought he'd never leave
(entering) Hello Jane, you look very beautiful tonight
He takes her in his arms
Mmmmm
Love when you smell like butter
(easing away) What are you doing here
Missed you
It's nine o'clock
Where does your wife think you are
At yoga
Shall we do some downward facing dog
Not tonight big guy
They
Is it really necessary for you to always say no before you say yes won't think less of you, you know
Really, Jake, 'm a little tired, was just gonna take a bath
Good
So, we'll just hang out
(now   , he the dinner dishes on the counter) Ooooo, is that Croque-Monsieur
Who's plate is this
Yours or his
Mine
56
(eats her leftovers, savors the taste) Oh my God, just as  remember it
Don't you ever eat at your house
Pedro dictates all meals and he has a very limited palate
(sees melted ice cream) What kind of ice cream is that
Lavender Honey
(immediately) Not sleeping
Not at all
You
Never slept better
And my digestion is finally back on track
You've turned my world right side up, Jane
You know what this means, don't you
No
That 've never really known how to live without you
52
'                                       52 Jane takes a bubble bath
Jake lies on the floor, leaning against the tub, his back to her, eating a bowl of ice cream
Maybe we should be growing old together
Hate to tell you, big guy, but we already grew old apart
57
What's with the `big guy'
Is that because you think 'm fat or is it a term of endearment
have no idea why  keep saying that
'm sorry
'll stop
Thank you
(then) love how quiet it is in your house
have no quiet in my life
Ever
Yeah, well, you live with a five year old
Yes
and don't forget Pedro
Jane splashes him
So what does that mean exactly
What's going on over there at your place
My marriage is
not turning out as  hoped
That's obvious
Agness started out really looking up to me
We never used to fight but now
with the kid
lately we're all about where he's gonna go to school and now she says we need a bigger house, more help
was thinking of cutting back at work
now that's never gonna happen
And she wants another baby before Pedro gets too old which  get but since we're always fighting
oh, God, listen to me
Isn't a baby part of the deal when you marry a woman that age
58
Is it
guess so
She's got me booked at the fertility center every other day and she's so amped up on hormone injections  may need to find an exorcist if she doesn't calm down
(Jane laughs) wish it was funny
(finishes his ice cream) Incredible ice cream
'm turning around
(as he turns, Jane shrinks in the tub) Remember when we used to smoke pot and eat your ice cream in the hot tub
The "hot tub"
That feels like a billion years ago
How long has it been since you
(indicates smoking a joint) Me
Since before Lauren was born
27 years
At least
Jake slips a joint out of his shirt pocket, twirls it
Are you kidding me
Put that away
It's been too long
Exactly
'm not going to
Okay, why don't  leave this with you
(It's kind of amazing
) Maybe you'll take a few hits
() 59
(cont'd) get your sea legs, then we'll smoke the rest of it together
Maybe
Jake places the joint in a drawer
So that nerdy architect likes you
you know that, right
He's not nerdy and he definitely doesn't
We're working together
was watching when you bent down to open the oven, his eyes were glued to your ass
(changing the subject) Hey, will you do me a favor
53
53 Jake is on a small ladder, changing a light bulb in the chandelier
Jane, in a robe, stands beneath him
(looking down at her, smiles) Tell the truth, Janey is this a great affair, or what
don't know
It's my first
(climbing down) We don't even have to have sex and it's fun
(arrives next to her) wish  could sleep over
gotta tell my shrink about this
This is a lot to handle
guess you should go
'm sure yoga's probably closed by now
() 60
(cont'd) Oh, you got a little ice cream on your shirt
Let me get that out
It's okay
Jake takes Jane in his arms and gives her a deep hug
He lingers, kissing her neck, smelling her skin
She kisses him on the cheek
He slides her robe off her shoulder
He softly caresses her shoulder, kissing it, then makes his way up her neck
Jane gives in and kisses Jake fully on the lips
He pulls her close, her robe falling
Wow, wow, wow
what's happening, Jake
The Phone
Jane pauses
Don't get it
always get it
have three kids
(Jake wishes she wouldn't
She hesitates, picks it up) Hello
Hiii
(makes an  told you so face) You still on the plane
How was Luke when you left
Oh, that sounds like fun
Let me know what can bring
No
Don't have any idea where he is
(points to Jake) Okay, honey, talk to you tomorrow
(hangs up) Now 'm lying
Lauren and Harley are giving Luke a graduation party this weekend
Sweet, huh
Jake's   , sees it's Lauren calling
(into phone) Hello stranger
Welcome back
Jane    and Jake darts over for a quick kiss and then  toward his car
They wave to one another
61
(into phone) -- Just getting in my car
This weekend
Sounds great
Let me know what  can bring
Jake looks to Jane
She shakes her head -- he's shameless
Jake shrugs
Jane watches as Jake drives off, talking on his cell
54
-                    54 Jane paces outside of a medical building, holding a box from her bakery
She's clearly waiting for someone
She spots a comfortably dressed holding the leash of an Airedale and approaching the building's entrance
(approaching him) Dr
Allen
(surprised to see her) Jane
Hi
Am  seeing you today
No,  just need to talk
and  was wondering if there was any chance you could squeeze me in for an emergency session
'm sort of desperate for some advice brought you some of that coffee cake you like
Not as a bribe or anything
(checks his watch) only have twenty minutes until my first patient
That's fine
'll talk fast
55
-  -            55 Jane, Dr
Allen and the Dog walk the corridor
62
(whispering) So, at this point,  just need some sound, unbiased guidance
Is having an affair with you know who a good thing or a bad thing
(they stop at Dr
Allen's office door) It's a bad thing, right
How could it be good
(opening his door) It's not good
It's not bad
Oh, man
Not what she needs to hear
56
56 Jane sits in a chair across from an empty chair
Dr
Allen turns on a few lamps as his dog settles
You know, things happen in life and our job is to find out why
What we have to do is take a real look at this
Are you ready to do that
am
Definitely
've made a list of what this can possibly be about
at my end
Can  read it to you
(taking his seat) Of course
(digging out her Blackberry) Thanks
e-mailed it to myself
(reads from Blackberry) Okay
Am  still trying to figure out why the marriage failed
Do want to get back together
Do we have unfinished business
Is this about revenge
Am  just
lonely
Or, is it my "caretaker" thing
() 63
(cont'd) You know, the kids are finally gone and now all of a sudden Jake's back and  get to take care of him in some way
Dr
Allen nods, impressed with the work she's done
And, listen,  get how therapy works,  do
We look at things, we examine them, weeks turn into months, what
we're going on eight years, right
and 'm okay with that,  like it
but in this case,  need to know what you really think
Like, 'd like you to say
Don't do this, it's absolutely wrong or go ahead, you'll be fine
actually want to be told what to do
What's interesting is 'm already seeing you open up more than  have in some time
'm thinking, through this affair, you may learn to view the world in a different way
'm sorry
need more concrete
Are you saying  should keep seeing him
Because, honestly, if the guilt and fear could go away, maybe could let go a little and figure this out
wouldn't resist looking at this
(mulls that over quickly) Okay
and another way of saying that is
Let go Jane
It can't hurt
Jane fist pumps in the air
64
57
-           57 Jake is in the Waiting Room with several other "Older" Men all with their much younger Wives
Nurse , holding a chart
Jacob Adler
Jake rises
One of the younger women whispers
Have fun
58
58 The Nurse shows Jake into a windowless room with a sink, a pleather barcalounger, a  and a  player
Okay, you know the drill
You can hang your things in the closest, the remote is on top of the  and the materials are in the drawers
(cleaning the remote with an anti-bacterial wipe) Please deposit your specimen in the cup and 'll see you when you're done
She dims the light before leaving
Jake takes off his jacket, tosses it on the chair, slips off his shoes, takes off his pants, sits for a sec when his He looks at the name of the caller
Smiles
Hi
59        '
59 (on her cell) Hey, where are you
At the office
Want to grab some lunch
65
Absolutely
When
Can you do it now
have about an hour
Thought we could go to The Stanhope
get room service
(she's nervous just saying it) (rising) Be there in ten
See you there, Adler
(hangs up) She's comin' back
Jake rushes to put on his pants, catches his foot in the pant's hem, hops to safety
He reaches for his jacket then grabs an anti-bacterial wipe, using it to turn the door knob
60
/ -                         60 Harley and Lauren are having lunch in the  connected to the Lobby
Harley has a clear view of the Lobby's Reception Desk
Lauren has her back to it
-- Luke's so excited about his party
We can fit forty people in our place, can't we
Sure, if nobody wants to sit down
(notices   the hotel) -- Hey, there's your
Harley then realizes   signing the Register and and chokes on his French Fry
My what
(starts to turn) Harley grabs Lauren's face in his hands and kisses her, even though he's choking
He coughs while kissing her
66
Harley
'm sorry,  didn't mean to spit on you
just needed to kiss you
While you were choking
It worked
'm not choking anymore
Harley swallows a cough, reaching for his water, as Jake is     and Harley drinks his entire glass of water as he watches
(turning) Who did you just see
Luckily Jake is now gone
No one
Thought it was your cousin
but
Harley falls silent as he After a sec, she's pointed toward the same elevator
Ohhhh my sweet Lord
(looks up from her salad) Now what
Honey,  totally forgot  have a conference call at 1:15,  gotta get back to the office
Waiter
Honey, stop eating, get the waiter
Call the one over there
(pointing her away from Jane) Harley, we can't leave, we're meeting with the Wedding Specialist
67
(watches as Jake waits for Jane around the corner) Yeah, you know what
Today's not a good idea to do that
(Sees Jane join Jake, they step into the elevator and immediately fall into each other's arms and kiss) Oh my God
61
'   -  -        61 The curtains are drawn,   the lights are low
Jane, in a hotel robe, slips a cd in the   cd player and we hear a mellow song, perfect for love in the   afternoon
The Bathroom Door and Jake , also in   a hotel robe
Jane stands across the room from him
They smile at one another
From behind, we see Jane untie her robe, letting it fall to the floor
Jake looks at her, from head to toe and back
They smile at one another, then something comes over Jake
His eyes roll back, his legs give out and he collapses against the wall
Jake
62
-                                   62 The Hotel's Wedding Specialist has joined Lauren and Harley's table
She holds a binder filled with photos
Harley is a mess, knowing what's going on upstairs
adore October weddings
Let me show you what we did last October
She opens her Book of Photos for Lauren
Lauren gasps
(rising) Honey, 'm gonna make that phone call from the
Lauren and the Wedding Specialist don't look up and don't hear him
They keep talking to each other
68
(nods) -- Okay
Good
You just keep doing that and 'll
They still don't look up
Harley nervously when he spots the  , bag in hand, arriving at the Reception Desk
What's the room number
408
Adler
His wife said he's conscious now
(taking off) On my way
Harley stops in his tracks, freaking
Adler
63
'   -             63 Jake is under the covers, in his robe, a blood pressure cuff around his arm
Jane, still in her robe, paces
The Hotel Doc sits on a chair next to Jake's side of the bed
Your blood pressure's good
How's his heart
Do you have a heart condition, Mr
Adler
No
And  just had a check up
You did
Oh, that's good
(listening to his heart) Deep breath
So, no chest pain
None
69
When you got dizzy, did you feel your heart was beating funny
Yes, but  was admiring my beautiful
(indicates Jane) Jane holds up her weak eyelid
-- Well that's nice to hear after all these years
(winds up his stethoscope) Did you forget to take any of your medications today
Took `em all
What all did you take
Uh
Lipitor, baby aspirin
(whispers) Flomax
(sitting on the bed) Flomax
(embarrassed) Yes, otherwise  pee 40 times a day
How long have you been taking the Flomax
Not that long
And  only take it sporadically
have to sneak it actually
(explains confidentially) It reduces semen and that's not good for my wife right now
(to Jane) Sorry
70
(looks over at Jane) Really
Yes,  prefer a lot of semen
Always have
(rises) Okay, well, thank you so much for coming
Looks like he's gonna live, so
(packing up) Yeah, my guess is Flomax is probably the culprit here
It can definitely give you a sudden drop in blood pressure so  suggest you stay off it for a few weeks, which apparently your wife will appreciate
(holds in a chuckle) Yeah
Really good for me
The Doctor snaps his bag shut, rises
And  suggest you rest quietly for the rest of the afternoon
(to Jane) No hanky panky, Mrs
Adler
No chance
assure you
64
64 Harley sits on a bench with his head between his legs
Lauren arrives, joins him on the bench
Are you acting like this because of the wedding
Tell me the truth
(head down) Not at all
Swear to God
71
Because  don't want to be one of those couples where the guy goes into a coma the whole time we plan the wedding
It's not worth it to me
Harley looks up, sees the Hotel Doc walk by the Reception Clerk
The Doc gives her a wink and a "thumbs up" and keeps on walking
(deep sigh, rises) Okay
We're back in business
65    -  -                                      65 In Jane and Jake's room
- Sitting up in bed, in their robes, watching Oprah and eating chicken soup on trays
Jake reaches for the salt
Jane eases it away from him
Jake looks over at Jane, oozing with love and appreciation
See
Just that move
you have no idea
Not everyone's like that
(mutes Oprah, then:) Jake,  have a confession to make
Back when we broke up
knew it wasn't all your fault
You mean that
You've never said that to me before
know
Because when you cheated, didn't have to
But  think in some way,  gave up on us and 'm not sure you ever really did
still haven't
Jake takes Jane's hand
She looks down at his wedding ring, then turns her eyes back to Oprah
beat, then: 72
Are you and Agness
still having sex
Jake doesn't answer
Jane turns, looks right at him
Only if she initiates it
Jane
'm trying not to rock the boat at home until you and  figure this out
(sees her reaction) This is a little trickier at my end than yours
Right
Yeah
Okay
(rises
) Now  know you're gonna think 'm leaving because of what you just said, but 'm not
really have to get back to work
(takes Jane's hand) We got really close there for a moment
She knows he's right
Jane's Cell
She lets it ring again, then answers it
(into phone) Hello
66    -                                           66 (into phone) Hi, hope 'm not interrupting anything
Adam
Oh
Hi
73
Jake is instantly jealous
He rises, crosses to the closet, starts dressing, his eyes glued to Jane who seems to be very engaged by Adam
just found out there's a French Film Festival in town and that made me think of you so  was wondering if you'd like to go to the opening night tomorrow night
(a little nervous
will she accept
) Oh, that sounds so fun
(Jake rolls his eyes) Let me think, tomorrow's what
(desperate, whispers) -- Say you're busy
Agness has a dinner thing tomorrow,  can come over
(Jane hesitates) Please
Oh, um, you know, 'd really love to, but, my son is coming home from college the next day and  have a bunch of things  have to do to get ready
(hates lying, Jake crosses to her, smiles) 'm so sorry
No, don't worry
No problem
Maybe we can see something another night
Absolutely
would love that
Jake smiles appreciatively, crosses to Jane, hugs her
67                                                   67 We see he is holding Two Movie Tickets
He looks at them then crosses to the desk of a Female Worker
74
Melanie, how would you and your husband like two tickets to the opening of the French Film Festival
Reserved seats parking
Seriously
68
-                                68 Jane and Jake are finishing getting dressed, moving about, putting on shoes, blouses, ties, jackets, belts
You'll make the whole thing
The roast chicken, the--- -- mashed potatoes, sauteed string beans and double fudge chocolate cake
know your favorite dinner, Jakey
(touched) You haven't called me Jakey in 10 years
This has been a great day for us
So, do we have a date
(fixes Jake's hair) We have a date
Jake grabs his heart
Jane leans on him, a smile on her face as we begin to
69
'  -      -                   69 Music plays from the outdoor speakers
Jane sets the table in her courtyard
She's singing along with the music
70      -                                    70 sits on the Kitchen Counter
Jane finishes off icing the cake like the pro she is then peeks into the oven, looks at her perfect roast chicken
71                                                            71 75
72
'  -                               72 Jane clips the price tag off of a new dress and slips it off its hanger
73                                             73 tells us it's 8:45
His eyes glued to the clock
We are    ' Jake and Agness lie on their bed, both doing paper work
Pedro is asleep between them
Jake gets up, slipping his cell into his hand
(not looking at him) Why are you taking your cell to the bathroom
Oh
Didn't mean to
(places it back on the night stand) Carry him to his bed, will you
Jake carefully lifts Pedro off the bed
(while reading) And hurry back
'm ovulating
You are
Why do you think  cancelled my dinner
Agness pulls her t-shirt over her head
she is gorgeous
74
'  -                                74 Jake gently lies Pedro in his bed, pulls up the covers
Pedro takes Jake's hand, holds it to his chest, looking up at him
Jake offers a comforting smile and Pedro closes his eyes
76
Jake sits on the bed and lets Pedro fall back asleep, holding onto his hand
75
'  -                                   75 Candles are lit on the table, but are now low
The table is set with flowers from the garden
The wine has not been opened
to  Jane   , still dressed for dinner and deep in thought
She then sighs very deeply and decisively as she turns out the lights and room by room, the house becomes dark
76
'  -    - 6
76 The Kids cars are in the driveway
77
'  -                           77 Jane, Gabby, Lauren and Harley are in the kitchen, cooking, setting the table, opening wine, chatting
-- Oh, Mom,  keep forgetting to tell you about our meeting at The Stanhope
We went there for lunch two days ago and met with their Wedding Specialist
think that could be the place, Mom
Two days ago you went to The Stanhope
for lunch
Yes and guess what
We saw nothing
Jane and Harley connect
He immediately looks away
What is that supposed to mean
Who wants wine
Anyone
(starts pouring) (looking in the fridge) Mom, you have an insane amount of food in here, even for you
77
(taking out last night's roast chicken) knew you were all going to be here for the weekend so  made a bunch of stuff last night
Looks like Jake Adler's favorite meal to me
(laughs) Very funny
Very
Jane looks to Harley again when they all hear a car horn Jane     and sees ' with Luke in the passenger seat
The Girls rush out the Kitchen door
Harley sees Jake getting out of the car and pours himself a larger glass of wine as Jane approaches him
Harley
Just then, Luke enters and Jane lights up
Yay
(hugs Luke) (surveying all the food) Mom, this looks amazing
Harley and Luke hug, talk the talk
`Sup
Yo
(sheepishly joins the group, eyes on Jane) Hi
(briskly) Hey
Harley takes a huge gulp of his wine
(holding Luke's backpack) Where should  put this
78
(turns her back on him, making herself busy) Wherever
Harley watches their interaction tennis match style
Jake looks at the table set for five, wishes he was joining them
He sees last night's dinner, now being served as left overs
Jane slices the roast chicken
That looks incredible
Jane looks up at him, knife poised
Is he kidding
Thanks
She goes at the chicken with the knife, slicing off a leg
Jake flinches
Jake
Glass of wine
Uh, sure
Thanks
Jane
(not looking up) No thank you
Jake's cell
He turns his back to take it
(into cell) Hi Ag
Just got here
Jane has a hot flash
Starts fanning herself
(into cell) Okay,  will
Yeah, no,  know
(turns back to the family) 'm sorry guys,  gotta hit it
Bye-bye
The Girls look to Jane
79
have to stop at the market
Agness is making some pasta thing and she ran out of olive oil
Hey, at least she's finally cooking
So
see everybody at the party tomorrow
Yeah
It's gonna be so fun
(to Lauren) told you 'm bringing someone, right
No
Who
Adam
My architect
You're bringing your architect
Yes  am
Like as a date
(looking right at him) Yeah
like the idea
Me too
Yeah, seems like it should round out everything really nicely
(pouring another drink) Nobody wants wine but me
80
Luke opens a cupboard, takes out a bottle of olive oil, hands it to Jake
Here, now you can stay another five minutes
(catches Jane's eye) You have three bottles in there
Janey, can  talk to you privately
Just for a sec
Jane heads out still holding the carving knife
Harley slips the knife out of her hand
There you go
(to Kids) Somebody's talkin' graduation gift
78
78 Jane and Jake stand in the courtyard off of the Living Room
What is it, Jake
What
don't get not calling me back
`Cause  don't care what your excuse is
(shuts the door to the living ) She didn't go out, Jane
She cancelled her plans and every time  tried to call or write, she caught me
wanted to be here
You know what, Jake
You were worried about rocking the boat at home
Well now you're rocking my boat and  don't like it
(stopping her) Honey, don't let one night
81
You don't understand
'm not even blaming you
fully participated in this
But  don't want to do it anymore
The last thing in the world  should be right now is your mistress, sitting around at nine at night wearing heels and perfume and blowing out candles and wrapping everything in Saran Wrap because your wife cancelled her plans
It was cliche and humiliating
(wistfully) You lit candles
Oh, shut up
Look, 've had a pretty good life these past 10 years
figured it out and moved on
no longer feel alone or divorced
just feel normal
You know how long that took, just to get my balance back
No
The point is, 'm going in the wrong direction here
But the worst part is
It's feeling like it used to feel
All the little untruths that are hard to catch but add up
-- Janey, c'mon, it was one mistake
(joining them) -- Everything okay out here
(Jane and Jake turn) The kids are gettin' hungry
Yeah
We're done
(walks away, pauses in front of Harley) We were just
82
(as she passes) -- None of my beeswax, Jane
(once she's gone) And please never tell me
Lauren joins
What's up
Nothin', punky
(rubs her arm) (taking Jake back inside) Yeah
So, we're going to see you tomorrow night, for sure, right
Harley starts to follow them out when Jane grabs his shirt sleeve
Okay
What did you see and what do you know
Nothing
Really
Jane gives him a look that could get blood from a stone
(confesses rapidly) Okay, he checked in, you arrived, you met in the elevator, possible kiss there, Doctor went up, Doctor came down, thumbs up
That's it
Have no idea what happened in between
(dying
) Have you told Lauren
No and  won't -- (joining them) Mom
Dad's leaving
83
Jane and Harley  from the courtyard just as Jake is about to leave
Jane immediately crosses to the table which now has dinner on it
Lauren kisses Jake good-bye on the cheek then joins the others who are about to sit down for dinner
(from the Dining Room) Thanks for picking me up, Dad
Jake pauses awkwardly at the door
He can't catch Jane's eye
He waves to the kids, who don't seem to notice then heads out
Jake , turns back, looks    , sees his family sitting around the table, talking, laughing
He heads toward his car as
glances out the window at Jake as he drives off
One of the kids says something, distracting her, and she laughs
A80
'  -             A80 Harley and Luke, on ladders, are stringing paper lanterns across a small patio
Lauren crosses under them, carrying a tray of food and joins Gabby who is setting out drinks
81                                                   81 Jane sits at her dressing table, dressed for the party
She puts on hoop earrings -- likes the way she looks
She opens a drawer to take out a lipstick
- Sitting among her cosmetics is the joint Jake left for her
She looks at the joint, then looks at herself in the mirror
84
82    -        - 15   82 He looks adorable and carries a gift the size of a book
He knocks in a playful rhythm
all smiles
Hey
- Very happy to see her
Hey
You look fantastic
'm feelin' a little fantastic
She       and we   she's eating a gi-normous piece of cake
(trying not to react to that, , handing her the gift
) This is for you
Really
Thank you
Come on in
(takes a huge bite of cake) Can you hold this for a sec
(hands him the cake plate) Oh my God
(takes another bite) -- this could be the best cake ever made
You want a piece
It's like
beyond
think 'm good
(focusing on the gift) can't believe you brought me a gift
So nice
85
Jane unwraps the gift, turns it around, looks at it
An appointment book
sort of assumed you didn't have one
--Because  never remember our
Awww
took the liberty of filling in our next two meetings
And marked them with post-its and wrote them in red and then highlighted them in neon yellow
Thank you
Jane kisses Adam on the cheek just as he was moving and the kiss lands on his lips
Sorry
'm not
(Did he really say that
Then, he licks his lips) Wow, that cake is good
Jane laughs a little too hard
83
'  -  -                           83 So, let me ask you something and please don't think 'm weird or out of line or anything
but do you by any chance poke smot
Do
mean do you smoke pot haven't asked anyone that question since  was twenty-two
86
Uh
No,  don't
But  have
But don't think 've had any since my kids were born
so not in like 27 years
Oh my God, we have kids the same age
And  haven't had any since my kids were born either
Except for tonight
had one hit off of this
Jane pulls the joint out of her purse, just as they pull up next to a Police Car
You might not want to hold that quite so
(nods) Hello Officer
(turns,  the Cop Car, and , then  to Cop, waves, then:) actually know him
Blueberry scone and a latte
(the Cop nods, pulls away) Oh my God
That was horrifying instantly saw myself in a mug shot
My heart is leaping out of my
(then distracted) Wow
This is the most insane dashboard 've ever seen
It's like we're in a cockpit
It's spectacular
Adam, what kind of car is this
Jane
(turns to him) Hi
Did you get this high from one hit
87
Yes
don't know what they've done to pot over the last 30 years but it rockkkkks
84
'  -                     84 From , we can see lots of folks in the Living Room
Candles dot the path up to the cottage door
Several Couples and College Kids are walking toward the house
85    -                                   85 Jane and Adam are sharing the joint
Jane takes a tiny, lady- like hit, passes it to Adam
(whispers) Don't take too much, it's really strong
She blows out the smoke
Adam, on the other hand, takes a huge hit
(while holding in the smoke) haven't had fun in almost three years, Jane
(takes another huge hit) Bring
It
On
walk past the bushes
Who's got the reefer
(
) (fake falsetto) No one
Keep walking please
The Kids laugh
86
'  -              86 Jane and Adam, two very straight laced grown ups,  the party, pausing as they peruse the crowd
88
How you feeling
Totally fine
Me too
Adam starts to move to the music insanely well and then just insanely
Lauren and Harley greet them
Jane greets them back with a huge hug
Hi
love your dress
Hey Harls
(that's weird
) Harls
Adam, this is my oldest, Lauren and her fiance, Harley
(giggles to Kids) We're on a date
Adam and Jane stifle laughs
87      -  -                              87 Jane and Adam chat with all the Kids
Looks like it's going great -- Adam is a big hit
- Jake nurses a drink and is not looking happy
He sees the Kids disperse, finishes off his vodka, ready to make his move
Now alone
They haven't seen Jake yet
(starts moving to the music - Jane laughs) By the way -- How great is this party
Let's be the last to leave
(bops to the  then , seriously eyeing him
) () 89
(cont'd) Hey, there's your ex-husb-- Uh-Oh
He's headed right toward us
Not the time to be "feeling groovy" (dances again when he sees Jake in - getting closer and closer) Oooo
Why so intense, big fella
Adam slides a bit behind Jane as Jake arrives with Agness who looks inappropriately youthful
Hello Jane
Adam
(all smiles) Hey, good to see you again
Adam, this is Agness, Jake's wife
(suddenly realizing) Now that is an odd sentence for me to say since that was me for most of my life
Seriously
How weird is that
Both of us married to the same man
(dismissing the idea) You know
it's
hey, what are you gonna do
Yeah, why go there
At this point, Adam gets hit with a severe case of the giggles
As the rest continue, he can't keep a straight face
Because there, is
fascinating mean, when you think about it, it sort of links us in some cosmic crazy way, doesn't it, Agness
Of all the men on the planet, we both said " do" to this guy
Yeah
Twenty-five years apart know you're having like an "Ah-Ha' moment, but  think 'm gonna get a refill
Adam, good meeting you
90
(whispers to Jane as Agness exits) She's got a really scary tattoo
Janey, can  talk to you for a quick sec
Jake nods his head toward the bathroom and heads for it
Jane looks to Adam
He always needs me for a quick sec
(starts to exit) You okay
Oh, 'm very okay
88
-                             88 Jane and Jake are crammed into an extremely tight space
What's going on
You're acting insane
(whispers giddily) 'm stoned
What
You smoked the joint  gave you
You told me to
It's a-mazing
But you weren't supposed to smoke it with him, you're supposed to smoke it with me
Somebody's jealous
Yes, of course
Why shouldn't be
you're my
91
-- What
What am , Jake
You're my ex-wife, lover, oldest friend and girlfriend
Jane blurts out a laugh
Okay
You're hilarious
And because of that, even though  kind of hate you/love you, 'm going to let you have some
You love me
mean,  heard "hate" had top billing, but
Jane takes the joint out of her purse, lights it up and hands it to Jake
Just as she does that,    and , thinking the bathroom is free
Jake quickly yanks him in, shuts the door, locks it
Harley is now caught between Jane and Jake and a cloud of smoke
Oh my God, you're smoking weed in the guest bathroom
Yes we are and we'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone about this
No
Never
Adding it to the list
Care for a toke
don't really smoke marijuana
(blowing out smoke) Me either
Okay, one hit
(looks at herself in the mirror) () 92
(cont'd) Oh, my God
Is that what  look like
89
-                            89 small group is dancing to a hip hop song on the patio
Adam and Agness are dancing together
They're totally into it
Jane makes her way to the dance floor as the song ends and The Beach Boys "Wouldn't It Be Nice" begins
Jake follows Jane dancing his way toward the crowd, spinning Gabby on his way
Jake takes Jane's hand
dances with her
Harley arrives next to Lauren and Gabby who watch their parents
They must be hammered
Or something like that
Adam glances over and sees Jane and Jake
(to Agness) Sweetest divorced couple in the world
Agness is surprised by how happy Jake looks with Jane
(spotting Adam) Hey
(to Jake) Jake, 'm gonna
Jane and Adam cross toward one another
Jake dies a little as Jane leaves him, her eyes on Adam
Jake doesn't notice Agness is watching him
Jane, now dancing with Adam, looks from Adam to Jake then back to Adam and then doesn't look back at Jake again
Jake is still as he watches the woman he loves slip away
Agness has her eyes firmly on Jake, not missing any of it
90
'  -  -                              90 Adam drives Jane home
Clearly the end of a great night
Wow
Fun is not overrated, is it
93
You know what's great
What
How much  like you
(really touched) Thank you
really like you a lot too
even though
oh
you didn't say, "a lot"
But  was thinking it
So
'm not too old for you
How can you be too old for me when 'm older than you
just figured all these women you get fixed up with are thirty-five
Your age is one of my favorite things about you
(she appreciates that) Do you think you have any more of that chocolate cake at your house
Hungry
Starved
91      -                                91 And we are    at
Jane turns on a few more lights, but keeps it a bit moody
Officially now the best date of my life
Pre or post divorce
94
Get out
All right
so basically  can make you anything on the menu or even not on the menu
Just name it
No
Really
Okay
(scans the blackboard menu) What about a
warm chocolate croissant
My speciality
92                                                           92 as Adam, now in an apron, watches, chatting with her
Jane then places the dough in a machine called a Sheeter
The dough slides into the sheeter and then slides back out bigger and flatter
-    - watching the sheeter, mesmerized
Jane folds the flattened dough, measures it with a yard stick, then cuts it into sections
She takes one of the sections, spreads it on a marble slab and very quickly cuts it into triangles
She's a whiz at this
, Jane shows Adam how to stretch the triangles of dough
Nervous at first, he gets the hang of it
Then, Jane teaches Adam how to place a bar of chocolate in each triangle and roll it into a croissant
Laughing as they work, they make a dozen croissants
into the
93
-                                      93 Jane and Adam sit at a table in the corner, a stack of croissants piled high between them
Music plays as Adam takes the top croissant and Jane takes the next
95
(bites into it) Oh
Baby
(smelling hers) Mmmmmmmm
It's crazy how good this is
(biting into one, nods) Yeah, and 'm not even stoned anymore
Neither am
(happy about that) Oh, then
merci, Monsieur
Do you remember when  asked you the other night, if you were dating anyone and you said no
It sounded to me like you were maybe saying yes
was sort of seeing someone
But, it's over now
(Adam nods) Honestly
`Cause 'm not strong enough to fall for someone who's with someone else
Wouldn't be able to take that again
understand
wouldn't say it was over if it wasn't
Adam takes Jane's hand in his
relieved
Great
Adam turns Jane's hand over and looks at it a bit quizzically
96
(explains) Cooking scar
From a very hot batch of caramel
Ooooo
What about that one
That one's from boiling sugar wasn't very skilled in the beginning
And that one is from a large French
Adam presses Jane's palm to his lips and kisses her scar
-- Saute pan
Adam then kisses the burn on her forearm
Jane sighs, closes her eyes
This feeling is unexpected
She opens her eyes as Adam moves closer
Would it be okay if
Jane nods
He kisses her great
was going to say, kiss you
figured
If you feel this is in any way wrong because we're working together
don't
He smiles as she folds into him and they kiss and kiss and kiss again
94                                                            94 97
'  - Quiet
Jane enters from the garden, humming, "Wouldn't It Be Nice
" Luke , still looking half asleep in his  Shirt and boxers
Hey sleepy
What time did you get in
Have no idea
Lauren and Harley drove me home
(joining) 'm surprised you remember that
(turns to see Lauren) Hi
didn't know you slept here
Lauren, in an open robe over drawstrings and a tank top, takes out a box of cereal
We were playing Scattagories with Gabby and Ollie then Harley fell asleep on the couch
Harley meanders in wearing Victoria Secret Heart patterned bottoms and a Girl's -neck -shirt
Sweet
got cold in the middle of the night
Lauren and Jane laugh
Okay, who wants what
(noticing Gabby entering) Hi baby
(looks out the front window) What's Dad doing here
98
Everyone     and  Jake sitting in his Porsche
96
96 Jane  as Jake steps out of his car
He looks like he's had a rough night and has something on his mind
Jane cautiously looks back at the house
The kitchen windows are all open
(quietly) Everything okay
left Agness
No, don't say that
She saw it my eyes, Janey
Saw what
That 'm still in love with you admitted it,  told her about us and 've left her
For you
No, no, no
What do you mean
Jake, this is crazy
(worried the kids will hear, whispers) Are you telling me the truth
(nods) This feels so right Jane
As Jane is about to respond, Gabby  the house in her 's, looking confused
(from the porch) What's going on
Nothing
Honey, set the table, 'll be right in
99
Mom, you're the only one who cares if the table's set
Okay, then do it for me
just go in please
Luke and Lauren join Gabby on the porch
What's up, Dad
Having some problems on the home front, just wanted to talk to your Mom for a sec
Jane shakes her head
Why did he have to say that
Harley joins the Kids
Problems on the home front
Is one of you seeing someone else
Hearing that, Harley does a swift about face and goes right back inside
Jane's eyes widen toward Jake
(off Jane's cue) No, it's nothing like that
just need to find a hotel or something for a few days `til  get my head together
It's that serious
Jake nods
Mom, can Dad stay here for a few days
He can share my room
don't think that's the best idea, Luke
Daddy, are you crying
100
93     -                                    93 He turns away from the kids
The tears could be for dramatic effect, could be real
'm sorry
All Three Kids immediately well up and look at Jane
(begging) Mom
97
-                 97 Jane nervously nibbles on her fingernail as the family sits silently around the table watching a ravenous Jake eat French Toast, bacon, coffee, side of fruit
His mood has been lifted
His energy is in full bloom
Mommy's the best cook in the world
98
-                        98 Jane is working in the garden
shadow falls over her
She looks up, Jake stands before her, a cute smile breaking across his face
Thank you for saving me Janey
Jake, you knew the kids were all here
Shouldn't we have talked about this
Agreed this was the right thing to do
This is so typical
Only thinking about works for you
'm sorry,  guess  should've called before showing up
-- And 'm not sure you even left Agness
Maybe she saw something last night and threw you out
101
What's the difference
was drowning over there
'm not going to get that many more chances in my life to figure myself out
Janey, let's use these couple of days to see if we can make this work
We can't, Jake
told you this the other night
Please listen
But you were all pissy because you thought  stood you up
Things are different now
'm a free man
(then) Can we just hug
hate that you're being so distant
It's literally giving me a pain in my stomach
Oh, God
Jane reluctantly hugs him
He tries to kiss her
See
Too much
Okay
Good note
Jane can't help but smile
Can  help with what you're doing
Hold your basket or
'm fine
Okay
'm going to go to the video store and get us all a dvd to watch tonight
We'll have movie night
Just like old times
How's that
'll make the popcorn
Just then Jane's Cell
102
Fine
(into phone) Hello
(whispers) love knowing 'm coming back here
(nods, turning slightly) Oh, hi
slept great
How `bout you
Jake waits, but realizes Jane's not going to turn back
99
- '  -                   99 The Adlers are watching The Graduate
The lights are low
Jake, shoes off, hands everyone bowls of popcorn
Jane sits in a club chair
Harley's on the floor and the Adler Kids are on one long sofa, all covered in a blanket
Jake hands them popcorn then squeezes back in, between the Girls
- Are you here for an affair, sir
What
The Singleman party, sir
Jane cringes as the Kids laugh
She looks over at Jake snuggling between the Kids, all eating popcorn and laughing
He catches Jane's eye and mouths

Any leftovers
Are you kidding
(takes out an armful of Tupperware) Any of that noodle thing left
(Gabby hands it to him
) Where's Mom
She disappeared so fast after the movie
She's probably sleeping
think she's on her computer
They all nibble out of Tupperware, leaning against various counters
Tonight was weird
So weird
Still is
loved tonight
Yeah
That's why it was so weird
Just seeing you in your robe in our kitchen
Remember when you weren't even allowed in
Mom used to go out to the car to talk to you
(handing Gabby his Tupperware) You know,  don't even really remember you and Mom as a couple
104
What do you mean
you were ten when we broke up
was eight actually and  don't know
it's all foggy to me now
You don't remember us in Hawaii or all sleeping in that tent in the backyard
Yeah, of course, but  don't remember like you and Mom hugging or waking up together
Jake grabs his heart, moans
-- It's okay
'm not damaged or anything
You've been good parents
Speak for yourself dude
'm definitely damaged from the divorce
Harley and Lauren
Lauren turns the tea kettle on
Hello troops
Why are you still here
don't know, you and Mom sleeping in the same house
Harley thought we should stay
Jake turns his beams on Harley
She exaggerates
just thought perhaps you might want to talk later, or
Is that the noodle thing
Oh
Sorry
think  ate it all
105
Dad
didn't know anyone wanted any
102
'  -                           102 Jane, sits on her bed, talking to Adam via iSight
On her , we see Adam but he's a bit of a
Wait,  can't see that one
Can you back up a little
'    - He back ups from the lens and models a rather ridiculous ski sweater
(hmmm) Very festive
-kay
Thank you
(into lens) Gift from my ex-sister-in-law
Have no idea why  kept it
(pulls sweater off) Into the pile
Hey, check out the pile, Jane
Adam    to the floor to show a Nice
(then) Hey, the pile's moving
Murphy, get out of there
small Mutt scurries out of the pile
Jane laughs
(re-enters in an odd shirt) What about this
was in India and  had it made
() 106
(cont'd) The guy ran out of fabric so he didn't make me long sleeves
(looks down) Or short sleeves
It's weird
And kinda girly
(taking it off) Not what 'm going for
(holds up a sweater) Gray sweater
Very old
But cute
(slips it on) You sure
You don't have to say you like it just because you nixed the last 20 things
Jane likes this man
Keep it
It's cozy
Boy, you have a lot of clothes
(looks at the floor) Uh, not anymore
Okay, we're almost done
You are helping me so much by the way
-- Adam,  really have to pee
Oh good
Me too
Meet you back in thirty
(lifting the laptop) Putting this on my desk
' Just a shot of Jane's Pillows on her bed
' 'm not in there
'  -
107
' Can't hear you
103
'  -  -                        103 Jake pokes his head in, looks around, sees no one in the room
He hears Jane in the bathroom and  quietly, quickly squirms out of his boxers and -shirt, then, , and lies on his side, on the bed, completely  -- elbow up, palm supporting his head -- a smile on his face
He changes his smile to a smoulder
Jake hears water running
Suddenly modest, he quickly drags over the open Laptop and places the open screen in front of his privates
He smiles, ready to be discovered
A104   dries her hands at the bathroom sink
A104 104
'  -                               104 Adam crosses through the room on his way to his laptop

105 Simultaneously,       , and instantly    in disgust
Mother of -- (looks again) Ahhhhhhhhhhh
Jake     ,     ' What are you doing in here
(covering the screen with his hands) Get it off
(covering himself) wanted to see you
108
Why are you naked
(sits up straight, the lap top shooting even more directly at his groin) Why do you think
Okay, 'm gonna be sick
Jake  , covers Adam's eyes on the screen, which, of course, does nothing
Not working
Big close up
Jake rises, now his ass gets the close up, he bends over to get his robe
Okay
Good night
Jake    and the
Jane and Adam look at one another
No time to say anything
She's desperate
He's lost
The   , the   , just as Jake ties his robe
Everybody okay
No one says anything
What's happening
Adam listens, his eyes on Jane
Jake crosses to Jane, facing the Kids
He walks in and out of the iSight shot
Okay
Let me explain
The reason left Agness wasn't just because my marriage wasn't working
(The Kids wait
) 've also fallen in love
back in love
with your mother
Or maybe never stopped loving her
Is this a joke
109
know this is shocking, but think this is the best thing that's ever happened to me
Your Mom and have been seeing each other, on the side
ever since New York
Mom, is this true
(dying) That part is, but
found my way back home
just hope she'll take me back
Gabby breaks down in tears
Lauren puts her arm around her
Jane starts to cry, looks at her laptop, just as she and
Why's everyone crying
Why isn't this good news
Because we're still getting over the divorce
Mom, are you and Dad getting back together
No
we're not
Jane looks at the Kids with incredible sadness
106
-  -                           106 The Kids, in their cars, drive down the road, away from the house
Jane stands in the driveway, watching, never before feeling quite like this
Jake   , holding his bag
He stops, looks at Jane
She has nothing left to say
Jake gets in his car and pulls away as Jane walks back inside
107                                                          107 110

/ -                   108 Jane lies on a pool chaise, wrapped in a blanket, tissues in hand
She stares up at the night sky and as her eyes flutter shut, we drift off of her
: 122                                                           122 123
' / -                     123 , asleep on the pool chaise, still wrapped in a blanket
The sprinklers go off and wake Jane
She opens her eyes, looks around, realizes she's spent the night outside
Jane sits up too fast, a tad disoriented, then quickly realizes what she must do
124                                  124 bed-headed and still in his pj's
He approvingly looks at Jane, who stands across from him, ready to right it all
Glad you're here, boss
125
-                                    125 Harley leads Jane down the narrow hall to the Bedroom
Now  know you don't need my advice Jane, but
got this one
know you do
Jane pauses, Harley nods for her to go inside
'  - Her Three Kids are under the covers
Lauren is between Gabby and Luke
They look like they just woke up
111
Jane stands in the doorway
The Kids don't say a word
Jane doesn't wait
She crosses to the bed, sits on it, looks at her children
Knowing how to be divorced is next to impossible
and sometimes over the years, 've thought that your Dad and  weren't quite finished
And, as it turns out, we weren't
So  went out of my comfort zone, which,  found out, if you're really honest with yourself, isn't all that comforting
So, experimented with a part of myself
wanted to find out if, after all these years there was still something there between us
And was there
There kinda was
Lauren smiles with her eyes
But Mom, you have to understand how bonkers this sounds to us
For two people who for years couldn't be in the same room together
to then have an affair
You and Dad
know
it was hard for me and was doing it
hope you'll forgive me for confusing you or betraying your trust, but  did this for me and for him and realized even though your Dad and once had something extraordinary
we no longer really fit together
But he is a part of me and always will be
So it's over now
You guys are back to being divorced
For better or for worse
112
Lauren takes her Mom's hand
Harley joins them, sitting on the other side of the bed, holding back tears
Group hug
And as they all move into hug, we: : 126      -
-               126 walking through Adam's firm
She arrives at: 127   '                                               127 Adam is on a phone call
(into phone) Yeah no problem
we can definitely do that
(notices Jane) -- James, can  call you back, someone just
Thanks
(rises) Hi
Hi
May  come in
-- Sure
didn't call you last night because  wasn't sure you would take the call and then  thought that could go on for months and
--  would have taken the call
Oh
Well, anyway, it's better to say these things in person
Adam, the man  was seeing was
think 'm up to speed on that part
113
want you to know it didn't last long and you're divorced, so maybe you understand, when marriages end, there's doubts and hurt, and you've got kids and sometimes you wonder if you did the right thing and when the moment presented itself
--  get it
could imagine it could
told him it wasn't going to work between us but  guess he didn't believe me and unbeknownst to me, he showed up at my house yesterday
He left Agness and
-- Jane
actually think understand what happened but
uh
you know 'm not as macho as  appear and  think it's probably best for us not to get any more
involved because your relationship with Jake isn't really done and  know you're saying it is, but he's in love with you and for everyone's sake, that should probably get resolved
Wow
So that's how grown ups talk
Adam smiles
Please tell me you're not going to quit my job and ask Peter to take over because then 'll never get to see you and
was thinking of asking Peter to step back in
Oh
hope you don't
Thanks
114
128                                                       128 129
'  -                      129 Jane drives home, when she notices Jake's Porsche in her driveway
She gets out of her car, finds Jake sitting on the bench swing hanging from a large oak in the front yard
Jane crosses to Jake
He moves over
Jane sees the humor in this gesture and sits on the swing with him, letting out a sigh
Side by side, they swing in the late afternoon breeze
'm sorry
Jane doesn't answer right away
How far back does that sorry go
How far back do you need it to go
Way back
Consider it an all inclusive apology
From not being the husband you needed to showing up nude on your bed last night
Yeah, what were you thinking with that move
That you'd find me irresistible
Jane turns to him, her eyes warming up to him
Never considered the alternative
Gotta love that about you
They swing some more
115
Oh, man, can't believe  got up to bat again and blew it
You didn't blow it
We blew it
We blew it the first time around
This time
we just should've known better
Too much has happened
Too much time has passed
And you don't think we could make it right
Does that mean you didn't feel it was totally right either
Being with you Jane is the best 'm gonna be
But do you agree that it wasn't really
It was complicated
Begging for an answer
thought it was good
wanted it to be good
Guess that's as close as 'm gonna get
Do you always have to be so hard on me
No
don't
don't regret giving it another shot
116
Probably would've been better if you hadn't been married
It may never have happened if wasn't married
Jane looks at Jake, knowing how true that is
They sit, side by side, as they sway in the breeze
don't regret it either
They continue rocking, not much more to say
As , we: : 130
'  -                        130 It's raining
Trucks are pulling into the driveway as lumber is being taken off of a truck and covered in tarps
Jane    in a parka and under an umbrella huddled under a make-shift tarp
Jane crosses toward them and as the group opens to face her she spots Adam, holding blue prints
Jane is stunned he's there
Good morning
Good morning
Did you know it's good luck to start building in the rain
Really
(obviously lying) Yes
It's a well known, very good, really lucky omen
Thunder rattles the sky
117
(looking up) Good,  could use one
(then) Would you all like to have your meeting in the house
it's dry and 've got hot coffee
The Group thanks her and heads for the house
Adam stays back and walks next to Jane
It's a long second before someone talks
Jane,  need to ask you something
Anything
You wouldn't happen to have any of those amazing chocolate croissants, would you
Oh
you like those, huh
have incredibly fond memories of them
don't have any here, but we could go into town and get some
right out of the oven
They turn toward the house and on their backs we hear: You want to do that
Yeah
love to
