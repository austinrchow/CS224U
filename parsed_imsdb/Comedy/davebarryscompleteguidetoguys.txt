Everybody's living la vida

come out of the
Loud Hawaiian shirts, walking a Chihuahua
They pause; take in the scene on Ocean
Adjust their

They thread their way to the corner
across the street
onto the Promenade
Under fat shady palm trees, to a  -- : - has a  with a kick-ass scope watches through binoculars; talks through a collar mike
Okay sit tight
Company's coming
, as    approach like barracudas
,  , the  they're protecting
Then as     -- Shit
Hang on
Leopold scans, looking for them
Searching, until he  -- -- The Hawaiian Shirt Guys hear that
The  the Barracudas, getting nearer; steal a look at the roof
: -   - rinses off at an outdoor shower
Beads of spray skip off her like diamonds in the sunlight

Oh, mama
She bends, twists; water streams down every delicious curve
She sure is taking her time
She must be really salty
(shakes his head) It's not just the salt
She's got sunscreen on
Then the sand gets on that, and it sticks
(then still watching) Hell, one time  was in Hawaii
And these three models -- Wait a minute
(looks at him) Hawaii
-- Shit
He    back: but all that's left is the Chihuahua
Then, walking into the spot -- Hi, 'm Dave Barry
Has something like this ever happened to you
(bends down to pet ) Because if you're a guy - or if you know someone who is - then what you've just seen should look pretty familiar
He picks up the Chihuahua, starts walking with it
Scientists call this condition "Lust Induced Brain Freeze
" It affects millions of guys, every day, in all walks of life -- causing anything from a mild embarrassment, to an international incident
He stops
Finds  and  and pointing  at him

Hand over the dog
Hey
didn't even know it was a dog
They take it from him; rush it away
Dave turns to
Notice  didn't say it's a condition that affects men every day -- only guys
And that subtle but important difference is one of the things this movie is about
: - and his
He has suitcases by the front door
You'll never get away with this
'll sue you down to your last penny
Good luck -  transferred everything we own into private accounts, where you can't touch it
In fact, as of now, you're broke
But
why
've fallen in love with another woman
younger woman
Prettier, with no cellulite
Actually,  think you'd like her
You bastard
The
Dave walks into the room
Now clearly, this woman is dealing with a Man
() 4
(') Whereas Guys aren't capable of doing anything like what you just saw
Guys are more like this: : / - sits across from his
Above and behind her is a  with SportsCenter on
just want you to know, 've thought about this a lot
Mm
And 've talked it over with everyone know
() Good
She looks down; stirs her soda
So there's nothing left to do now, but leave you, forever, and only see you from across a shiny conference table with bloodthirsty lawyers all around it
(a beat; turns to her) -- Okay
"Okay
" That's all you have to say
(then watching him) Well then  guess this is it
She pushes back from the table, starts off
Wait a minute
() This can't be happening
The words she's waited for
She turns, relieved
(to the tv) How can you dQ that
How can you trade Lupenza
(then to the ) What's the matter with these people
Beats me
saw this on the eight o'clock
He's the backbone of the whole team
They're pikers without Lupenza
'll see you in court
--  gotta call Lenny
He takes out his cell phone
She levels a look
Maybe you should call your lawyer too
If he could hit left-handed pitching, would
() Lenny
Pick up -- the Yankees got Lupenza
The
: - Two   on a glider
talks directly to
' absorbed with some device that we can't see
Well when  met him,  didn't know so much
About guys, or men or what have you -- we just didn't talk about such things then
In fact,  didn't see him naked until quite well into our marriage
When was it Albert
6
year ago
By accident
Anyway
thought  was marrying a man, but didn't know that in his heart, he was a guy
(
) When did you first suspect
Not long after the wedding
But it didn't bother me
just didn't know how to recognize the signs
But we've learned to live with it
Haven't we, Albert
(then after a beat) Albert
It's twelve hundred and thirty-one miles from this spot right here, to Cleveland
What does that have to do with anything
He holds up the device - handheld
Six hundred fifty-one from Atlanta
Who cares how far we are from Atlanta
You have a cousin there
Albert
There's a person here asking us questions
There's a film crew here
He looks up at the , as if just noticing someone there
Then holding up the  -- You
Where do you live
(
) Here in Miami
What part
Lenore buries her head
: - Dave walks down a crowded street
Colorful day life
Like a lot of big cities, Miami is known for its sizeable population of guys
So we came here to take the city's pulse on the subject
: '   - young, pretty, single
Let me put it this way
Everyone ever dated was a male
mean they were all men
But only some of them were guys
You know
(
) see
(thinks about it) -- The guys were funnier
But the men were more responsible
You could almost half-believe them when they told you something sometimes
(
) So, if you were to meet someone that was funny and responsible
That would be a woman
: -  - 20-ish   talks to the  while she combs out a mane
8
Well guys, they're sort of like your older brother
And men are like your dad
(
) In what way
Your older brother doesn't have to grow up
Your dad came that way
: - Dave walks out of the barn towards
So now you have some background on basic guy attributes
But before we move on, let's look at one more scene and see where you stand -- : : "  " '   - works at a window desk
watches  on
( ) -- now that's the kind of middle linebacker you like to see
He's got the mud all over him, he's got the bleeding knuckles, he's got the clumps of grass all jammed in his -- Roger
(to the tv) Oh man you gotta show that again Shepauses; chews her pen
Roger
think  really love you
() (') (looks over there) But  can't bear the uncertainty anymore, of where this relationship is going
Roger turns
'm not asking whether you want to get married
Only whether you believe that we have some kind of a future together
That you, and  - have a future
Now this is just what you want in a playoff game
You got snow, you got mud, you got a lead that keeps changing, you got two great teams that just hate each other to the bone and would rather die than give up
Roger looks
then takes the  and     - waving Elaine over, who cuddles into him
've been thinking too, Elaine
And for the first time in my life, 'm feeling like  might really be close to a lasting commitment
haven't said anything up until now because it's always been important to me that  not mislead you
But yes, Elaine
want to think that we dQ have a future
And with a little more time,  think  could be sure
Oh, Roger
He smiles
Strokes her hair and pulls her in even closer
They share a long deep sigh together, As the and
If this was how you responded, you're not a guy
You may not even exist
(then taking the remote) On the other hand
10
-- 'm not asking whether you want to get married
Only whether you believe that we have some kind of a future together
That you, and  - have a future
(then looking at him) Roger
(engrossed in game) What
on her look, and -- ( ) If that was you
you're a guy
: - talks to the  before going onstage
The muffled  of the warmup band
Well there were always guys at my shows - right from the beginning mean you start out playing beer halls, right
So when you have beer, you have guys
And it sorta just grew from there
But  was okay with it
They didn't cause much trouble
(
) And what about men
Men cause trouble
() But that's okay too
get half my songs from that
(
) So it all works out
11
Long as they buy the records
: - Dave walks along the stacks in the
So where did this all start
Many experts now think they know where men came from, but what about Guys
where did they come from
He stops, peels off a   full of science things
To answer this question accurately, we might have to look something up
So instead we'll travel back to prehistoric sub-Saharan Africa, and get there just in time for the Dawn of Guys
: : "   " : - The endless expanse
cluster of caves
of all kinds of nasty shit out there
Skittering over rocks
Slithering through the grasses
Bigger predators, circling
cocks his head back and  out
: opens one eye
, and  -
Hairy grunting things, all sleeping in a protective clump
12
He rolls over, back to sleep
But the   again
: , : - comes out
sleepy nod at   and , as they take up leaning against their caves and start off
In a few million years they'll be leaving suburban driveways this way
-
- and   have joined   and All carrying their slabs of jagged rocks
Grunt grunt grunt grunt grunt
() -- and that's why wildebeests are so mean
Grunt grunt
0 Ha ha
Grunt grunt grunt
0 That's really funny
Grunt
0 don't get it
The other three look at him
- work in stooped-over positions, trying to pound roots and tend fires while   crawl all over them
They  the Primate Guys' laughter trailing off
They trade looks; Something seems to pass between them
- Primates Roger, Gene, Lenny and Phil get to the grounds and and  already there
These two don't have the rock slabs though
13 Grunt grunt
0 Whassup
Grunt grunt grunt
0 Nothing
We've been hunting
Grunt grunt
0 Where are your jagged rock slabs
Grunt
a Slabs
(looks at Primate ) Grunt grunt grunt
a Who needs slabs
Primate Pete laughs with him; then holds up a  , about the size of a grapefruit
Primate Roger and Primate Gene trade looks with Primate Lenny and Primate Phil
Grunting/subtitles continue
Ooooohhhh
Ooooohhhh
Where'd you get that
Primate Discount Manny
He just got them in
Mind if  have a look
Be my guest
He hands it over
Primate Roger lays down his jagged rock slab to check it out
His buddies gather round
How do you kill an animal with that
You throw it
14
You mean you don't chase the old ones until they get tired and then hit them with the jagged rock slabs
(shakes his head) You can stand in one place all day
And when they go by, you just let loose
He shows a throwing motion
The first four look intrigued
You can carry more than one - and if you're throwing uphill, it rolls back down if you miss
It's so much easier with these
-- 'm sticking with mine
(then off their looks) We've been using these jagged slabs forever
And you know why
Because they work
And anyway, killing them is only half of it -- how are you gonna skin a wildebeest with that
They look at Primate Pete: Yeah, how
But he's there
We get the women to do it
They look among themselves
They like it
But then
How
-- 'm working on it
: - The   are still, pounding roots and tending fires and dealing with climbing
They ; gather and go to the ridge where they -- The   are coming back, without their jagged slabs and without any animals
But they are having great fun: 15
running in primitive patterns, and throwing one of the back and forth and chasing whoever has it
It looks like the beginnings of rugby, or Australian Rules Football, in terms of all they need now is beer
The   watch
And trade looks
Once more, something seems to pass between them
: - Primate Roger and Primate Elaine try to keep it down for the Primate Kids' sake
(grunting, subtitled) Please don't tell me you got rid of your jagged rock slab
But these are great
But you didn't kill anything
Nobody's going with jagged slabs anymore
But the kids are hungry
What about your pounded roots
Pounded roots are a side dish
They need balance in their diets
(then off his look) And another thing - suppose you do start bringing animals home using this -- who's going to skin and clean them
He looks at her-the  of '   as : - Primate Roger comes out of the cave, with his rock
He gives it such a look
16
Then looking up at the sky he hurls it, up as high as he can
, , ,   , ,        -- '       -- : '   - -- which  is holding, across from  on the couch
Five hundred dollars
It can hold a thousand addresses
So can my address book
Can your address book pick up your em-ail
No but my computer can
Well this can do both
For five hundred dollars it should give me a manicure, Roger
It should drive me home from work at night
could you spend that kind of money without discussing it first
On Roger's look
the
Dave walks in
There's a whole list of things a guy is supposed to discuss first
Unfortunately, he never knows what they are until he's already not discussed them
() 17
(') To a girl it's a pain in the butt
But to a guy - some things just come naturally
: - Shrouded in fog
scans the horizon through a spyglass
Next to him is long-suffering
Well did you ask
This is a shortcut
Explorer Elaine shakes her head
Dave enters
There's a very simple reason why guys don't ask for directions
It's because they know that if they do, someone else - most likely Visigoths - will come and steal their woman
to the side rails, where a nod, slobbering, confirming this
just want to get to Colonial America
: : "   " - bunch of  dressed as Indians are throwing barrels into the water
interviews
-- and this is your way of expressing the public outrage over the high- handed anti-democratic actions of the British Government in general and King George  in specific
(looks a little nervous) Uh, yeah
18
Might  ask, sir, whose idea was this
() Guy over there
The one drinking coffee
That's him
His name's Starbuck
He said to get rid of all the tea
(; ) see
One more question
Aren't those Greek fraternity letters painted on your chest
The Guy looks;   in greasepaint
didn't do that
(then as the Reporter ) Don't tell anyone
: -   - , ethnically cross-sectioned
Well that's pretty much how it is right now, right
They don't grow up
Or, they grow up, but they don't change
() You want to know how to spot a guy, there's your first clue: Look for an otherwise man who did not grow up
No they grow up all right -- but only just enough - you know
() 19
(') Like they'll meet the absolute minimum requirements of being a man, but that's it
The rest of the time they're fourth-graders
Walking fourth-graders
More like driving fourth graders
With credit cards
And a phone
And give them ten minutes on their own
Or put them in with other guys
Now you've gone nuclear
Please
: - The lot is filled with 60's and 70's cars
Dave gets out of a  ; has mutton-chop sideburns, talks to
In learning to understand Guys today, it's important to remember that these same guys, only yesterday, were just kids
: - table of 8   : punching, eating, climbing all over each other
One poor luckless  with them
Stop punching
We're not punching
You are too punching - now stop
We didn't come here to punch
20
They stop; look at him as if he's crazy
Then one of them notices   8 looking
Hey Roger's got a girlfriend
8 do not
Then what're you looking at
8 Nothing
And they start punching again
The Dad looks up - so weary
( ) Here we can see where even at an early age, guy behavior is already well developed along complex patterns that social scientists have called, "jerks
" While girls at the same age are referred to by the same social scientists, as "human beings
" -     8 They are all chatting nicely, passing out napkins and ketchup packets making sure everyone has what they need
While the that brought them quietly reads a novel
See
Humans
He walks past with his takeout order
As  at 8 notices Roger, blushing, taking all this punishment because of her
(as Dave exits) Will you please stop punching
: '  - Dave sits across from a   with a  saying, "Noted Pediatrician
" He has a laser pointer and a powerpoint presentation
21
Where are we in the area of Guy Violence, Doctor
Well first, one must understand the inherent differences in  and cell structure as relates to men and women
( ) For example, all women have a gene that makes them have the need for meaningful conversations
Likewise, all men have a gene in them that we scientists believe is directly related to violence
And what can be done about that
well, some of my esteemed colleagues are quite keen on the idea of tampering with the  itself - an idea with which  heartily disagree
The bastards
Then what would you recommend
Me
Well they can start by spreading out the funding a little bit
Let a few other scientists wet their beaks
mean what's the point of rewarding the same tired old hacks, year after -- meant about Guy Violence
-- (then shifting back) Well nothing, really
mean, what can you do
Short of lobotomizing them, anyway
No  suppose we'll just have to continue to channel their aggression into socially acceptable outlets
Like professional wrestling, or the space program
see
Can  ask you a question
22
Certainly
Where'd you get that laser pointer
It's mine
: - Dave stands in front of the entrance
lot of work has been done in the field of children's toys and how they unconsciously reinforce gender roles
Studies have found that over ninety-three per cent of this work is done by researchers who don't have children of their own
But to test the theory anyway, we're here at Toy World Warehouse Planet
: - Dave shepherds new father  up to the counter
Hi
My friend here is looking for toys for his son that are gender neutral, environmentally sound, and culturally unbiased
Here it is
He brings up a box with a picture of a spinning top on it
What's it do
It's recyclable
23
Where are the trucks and guns
: - New Father Gene meets up with    at the car
She came from  ; he helps load up the bags
What's this
(looks, sees the toy ) Oh  got that for Benjy
You were supposed to get a rattle
All the rattles were recalled
So you bought a tank
Wait'll you see what this can do, baby
Benjy's gonna love it
Oh yeah
Can he shake it
Will it rattle
Rattle
This thing'll bring down a bookshelf
She looks at him
He'll be returning the thing within seconds
to Dave, who shrugs
: - '   - rundown place with junked cars out front
's an intense little guy in a Tigers' hat and a couple major tattoos
Well 'm into fireworks
like to take 'em apart, you know
And study 'em
See what makes 'em tick
24
He shows Dave a box with   inside
just got these from Ohio
don't think they're as good as the ones got from Tennessee
Not as loud, you know
Well no, if loud is your -- If you want to hear loud - listen to this
He goes over to a different box, takes out what looks like a stick of dynamite
Gets ready to light it; turns to
You may want to step back a couple hundred yards
: '  -  - As Ed's Auto Shop recedes in the background - with a accompanying - So when we see guys like Ed, and his fireworks - or guys shooting marine flares into innocent pumpkins, or building catapults that'll throw a Buick - we should not condemn them
We should not assume these are just pointless juvenile activities
Instead we should be convinced they are, and move on to Guys in the Workplace
: -  - stands outside a
Guys at work
Or guys doing work
() 25
(') mean unless you want to talk about faxing or emailing their stupid jokes back and forth
Sick jokes
: - Dave and a   eat   from a
Ten, fifteen years ago
guy would call you up with some joke he just heard
So you wanna pass it on, it's by phone
One person at a time
Then a while later, some guy calls you up with the same exact joke
Then when group faxing came in, it really sped things up
Next thing you know there's like ten faxes on your machine, from places you never even heard of
Places around the world, 'm saying
And how long would that take
run of the mill, 'guy walks into a bar' joke, those'd take about
a
week to come back to you
The topical ones, your mass murders and tragic accidents and the like, they're naturally gonna have a lot more heat on them and they'll circulate a lot quicker
mean no one's gonna sit on a Princess Diana joke until three weeks after the crash
No one i know, anyway
( ) Now there's the internet -- and what used to take a week'll take like seconds
'm telling you it's getting harder and harder to keep up
lot of people don't understand the attention and the kind of importance these jokes have
Who
() 26
(') () Oh you mean women
Well, you know - what's the importance of having fifteen pairs of shoes
No one knows that
: : "  " '  - Roger is slumped across the back seat; messed-up clothes and in obvious pain
Elaine drives; talks to
So  get this call at work
(then to Roger back ) You want to tell this
Its just a sprain
(shakes her head) get on the phone and they say he's okay - but maybe  should come down to the paper and get him
Does he look okay
It's a sprain
It just looks worse
Not the way  heard it
: - Roger's at his desk; can't help but  ,  and talking nearby
He's how old
High school
sophomore
27
Big deal
could run the forty that fast
You and who - the Flash
This kid set a national record
Yeah
What nation
: '  - ( ) Tell me something
If the article was about a poem there wouldn't be an argument - would there
Why would there be an article about a poem
'm just saying
don't see the four of you fighting over who can write the better sonnet
So
So no one gets hurt writing sonnets
(off her look; then) It's a sprain
: - Roger listens more agitated as the argument mounts
When did you last run the forty
Hey
could beat you in the forty running backwards
28
You couldn't even beat your butt running backwards
(from his desk) Will you guys cut it out
They stop
Look at him
The kid in the story's in high school
You're not
You're supposed to be adults and you're bragging about who can beat who in a stupid footrace
No one's bragging
Gene's just saying he can run the forty in under six seconds
Hey
can do it in under six seconds
, on their expressions
" " T0: - The   crouch in their starting stance stands at the end of a marked-off course with a stopwatch and a whistle
She blows the whistle
They're off
All four guys explode off the line
Patrick gets five strides and goes down
Tom gets two more and falls, howling in pain
Then Gene and Roger, neck and neck for at least three more strides until Roger   "," that  over the music, and goes toppling down
As Gene finishes alone - gripping his side in awful pain but pumping his fist in victory
29
: '  - Elaine comes in; Roger, limping and leaning heavily on her
don't know why  listened to you
You need to see a doctor
It's a sprain, Elaine
Roger you can't walk
It'll work itself out
She gives him a look
Parks him long enough to close the door behind him
Without her support, he drops to the floor
She turns to the
Why won't they go to the doctor
: '  - British, white coat, stethoscope
Here's why
He holds up a
Dangles it harmlessly
don't care who they are
If they think there's even a chance their doctor will use one of these - and they always assume there is - they won't come in
() 30
(') (puts it away, shakes ) If there's anything out there that would bring them in
it hasn't been invented yet
: : "    " - It says so on the
, like an international road sign, has a graphic of a      with a through it
There are also
: - The  checks a ' chart
There's a  with  on in the exam room
What seems to be the problem
Well the main thing is,  keep coughing up blood
And  get these really severe chest pains, and double vision sometimes
And every night at sunset, little worms come burrowing out of my skin
It's just a sprain
That's what  thought
: : " " -   - Karla , Mia, Lila and Sidra again, with Dave
lot has been said about how guys don't share their feelings
31 You mean they have them
Or they have them and don't acknowledge them
Or they don't think that others have them
Or they just don't think
(as they agree on ) -- Is it possible that they do have feelings, they do acknowledge them and they do know others have them - but they just don't express it the same way
Four blank faces look at him
Then
Sports
They have feelings about sports
And their underwear
( ) You ever try and throw out their underwear
Once
nearly lost my life
They act like it's so sacred
've seen pairs of briefs with holes in them larger than the leg holes
(as the others nod) tried to throw a pair out once
And sneak it past him
He went out into the garbage and found them
He said he couldn't trust me after that
Tell me what that's all about
don't even want to think about it
32
(off their reactions) So you agree then, that guys at least have feelings
They just waste them
That's all
: - and  get out of Roger's car
Elaine has an armload of magazines
Now remember
Gene's dad is real sick
Kelly says he doesn't talk about it
So see if you can draw him out
He already did talk about it
Oh
What did he say
He said his dad is real sick
She gives him a look
Gets to the door
What are those
Kelly's boss is turning forty
So you're giving her magazines
(a look; then) Just see if you can get him to talk
: - There's a  on
Gene sort of stares
Roger has a on his lap; goes through Gene's  cartridges
33
Galaxians
Far out
(while Roger keeps ) Can you believe the Yankees got Lupenza
They get everybody
know
They suck
know
Silence
Roger pulls out two cartridges, compares them
got to Level 24 of Arkanoids
() -- You're kidding
Gene shakes his head
He's not
This is big
You've seen the Evil Presence
(then off his look) What's it look like
Gene shrugs; even the best of friends
Roger understands
to Dave
Believe it or not, ladies - that was sharing
(then nods to kitchen) And believe it or not, guys - so is -- : - Elaine and Kelly with magazines and writing pads
Well  don't know
How do you think she feels about getting older
34 don't know
know how  felt
How did you feel about it
How does anybody feel
() So you think she'll want a smaller gathering
Well if we go that way, we know who to invite
But then who do we not invite
Exactly
And how are they going to feel about that
So maybe we should make it a slightly larger gathering
-- Depends on the food,  guess mean, if we go with a larger gathering
Exactly
(finds the right ) saw something earlier in here about low-fat hors d'oeuvres
Oh - 've seen that one too
They open to the article, scanning it
Hmm
Hmm
35
You thinking what 'm thinking
That if we have low fat hors d'oeuvres she'll think we noticed she's gaining weight
Exactly
( ) Maybe just blow it out, you know mean it's a party
Go with the high fat
Thinking she won't think we've noticed the weight gain
Unless she thinks that's insensitive
You know, that we hadn't noticed
Hmm
They close the magazine, look through the others when: How about medium fat hors d'oeuvres
And we could cut them into smaller pieces
() She could think we were being cheap
And how would she feel about that
: - Roger and Gene watch a   without the sound
That one has the
With the screen that has maps of everything
36
What about with the convertible
It's optional on the convertible
Unless you get the turbo, then it's standard
Phil Wonkerman got the turbo
No shit
Phil got a Porsche
Said it was his birthday present to himself
(; ) When was his birthday
Beats me
Probably around the same time when he got the car
No shit
() Maybe we should get him something
(looks at him) He just got a Porsche
Right
They look at the  again
Then, from the kitchen doorway: Roger
They turn
Elaine gives Roger a look
: 37
Roger met Elaine at a company event
: - with  mingle with drinks and appetizers
Dave comes away from the hot buffet table with a great haul
-- They discovered they had something in common right away
He points to  and , over by a tiki-torch
You're kidding
That was you
At the Burger King
was in fourth grade
was too
But my God, you remembered that
(off Roger's nod) She loved that he remembered that
: - - night; neon and black light and
(handing out shoes) few nights later, he asked her out
He points over to the  where they're bowling
They had a good time, and so he asked her again
And then before too long they were seeing each other regularly, and not seeing anyone else
() 38
(') () Of course, Elaine was the only one who knew that
: -   - Roger opens Elaine's door for her, then goes around
She lingers, watches him before she gets in
What
Nothing
She smiles; gets in
Roger pauses
Roger has no idea that this was a defining moment for her
Roger gets in
Fuzzy but not sure why

She waits
' Gee
wonder if it bothers him that  said that
Maybe he thinks 'm trying to push him into some kind of obligation that he doesn't want, or isn't sure of
Maybe he's been feeling confined enough by our relationship as it is
' Six months
39 ' He's worried
(then thinking about ) Well hey - you know
'm not so sure  want this kind of a relationship either
Sometimes wish  had a little more space, so 'd have time to think about whether really want us to keep going this way
mean, where are we going
Are we just going to keep seeing each other at this level of intimacy
Are we heading toward marriage
Toward children
Toward a lifetime together
Am  ready for that level of commitment
Do  really even know this person

You're too idealistic
You're waiting for some knight to come riding up on his white horse, when you're sitting next to a perfectly good person, a person you enjoy being with, a person you truly do care about, a person who seems to truly care about you

That was the day  met her
His  turns, looks at him funny

And that made all the difference
Happiest day of my life, just about
She watches him
The man is hopeless

He smiles at her
Gets a thin smile back
What
That wasn't me
Of course it was you
What are you talking about
It was your first wife
Nonsense
( ) We met in Sacramento
Eight and a half years ago
Don't believe her
've never owned a yellow sun dress in my life
And even if  did, wouldn't be wearing it in November
48
(off her look) -- The point is, in 1960 an Irish Catholic could be elected president of this fine country, as long as his father was a filthy rich rum-runner with connections to the Mafia
And when Nixon did get elected, he had to quit
His wife shakes her head
: '   - Kelly and Gene on the sofa
Well we didn't know each other mean, of course we didn't - we hadn't met yet
But we were both invited to the same party, by different people who we only knew marginally - only the party got cancelled, and  guess that's how marginal we were, because no one told us
So we came in different cars and found ourselves at the same front door - with no one home
(then taking his hand) So Gene asked me out to eat
was hungry
You were in love
(then off his look) You told me you loved me, that first night
said  loved mashed potatoes
You were eating mashed potatoes
You said you loved me
You said because your name was Gene and mine was Kelly, that that just proved it
We were meant to be together

Then as Roger sloshes past, to the car
And what is it about the hardware store
All they do in there is buy a bunch of tools that they don't know how to use -- and no matter what the problem is, all they'll end up doing is whacking at it with a hammer until it breaks even more
And then they cover it all up with duct tape and then come out and say it's supposed to work that way
( ) Then we have to call Steve
And they get offended

Let me tell you something
If  had a dollar for every time  heard "Steve's" name,  could hire somebody better than Steve, just to shake things up
Get her one of these old semi-retired guys - someone from the pre-steroid days, with the hairy shoulders, and the butt crack
They won't be so quick to call him every ten minutes

Keep these away from anything magnetic

He takes the tool kit from the Clerk and drops it
The Clerk watches Roger chase down all the parts: what a dolt

then stops
The thing is -  missed out
(turns to ) It's like everyone else was there the day they taught all this stuff
How to look inside acar
Or a furnace
Or a rocketship
But the guys like Steve, youknow
They were born knowing allthis- and now they're laughing

Elaine tries opening the door
(on other side) 'm sorry - the door's stuck

And the pain in his heart is something we can feel

Steve pulls the cover off the  assembly
Roger is sorting through the 53-piece tool set he bought and has no idea what to do with
If you've got a minute, sir

That won't be -- (then as all the parts ) -- necessary

Roger puts the tool kit down
Joins Steve
There's your problem right there
() You got calcification in your pullet- beam header grommets
was afraid of that
Steve looks at him
One of those sideways looks
What you gotta do is jack up your laminate bolts and remove the calcification on the stress points
(while Steve takes ) Of course when he says "you," he doesn't mean "me

don't have winches

Three months ago, the Marlins traded a guy named Rufino Lupenza to the Yankees, for some minor league players and cash
grant you it was a rotten trade
grant you the Yankees seem to have this, this knack for making brilliant deals year after year
But three months
(pops in a tape) The Marlins are over it
The Yankees are over it
The players and their families are over it -- but just check this out
( ) The guy was a workhorse
He filled in wherever he was needed and he never got hurt
And when he got hurt, he played hurt

He says they're all doing fine: Lucita's got the kids in their new school already and they all seem happy
She even found an Ecuadorean grocery she likes
Grocery -- the guy batted 340, from both sides

They don't know the players
The players don't know them - yet they idolize these people
They follow them from team to team -- and they know more about these teams than they know about their own families
They might not even know if they have families
Not during the playoffs anyway
62
(amen to that; then) And what gets me is, they think - they really think - that whether a team wins or loses or not depends on how much they personally care about them
Like if they don't care, the team can't win
But that's true
They look over - see him on the counter
What's true
It's true that the level of concern a guy shows for his team can affect the outcome of the game
(then off their looks) mean not just one guy - but lots of guys
All the guys who care about the team combined, if they really care, can make a difference on the scoreboard
That's crazy
Who is he

For the first time ever, through the use of highly advanced technology, we will be able to see the actual Concern Rays emanating from the minds of Roger and Gene, in their attempt to affect the outcome of this upcoming - and totally critical - foul shot

Then we       emanating from Roger's and Gene's foreheads and traveling into the screen

And it is here, at the arena, where the combined Concern Rays from both teams' fans will be measured - not just for quantity, but for quality

It is an important territorial statement that males are genetically programmed to carry out

John, thanks for coming by today
Happy to be here Dave
John, you heard what our leading expert said about this particular anxiety that guys have regarding bathrooms in general and public ones in particular
Any thoughts
Well he's exactly right, Dave mean the guy was a little loopy but he hit the nail on the head
So an airport bathroom presents a specific kind of challenge
67
The worst kind, Dave, and in a lotta ways
Because a guy's main goal is to get in and outta there without having to deal in any other way with any other guy - and in an airport bathroom especially, with the turnover rate they've got, he's up against some pretty mean odds
Couldn't agree more, John
Let's go -- : -  - wearing headsets
Dave and John sit by a There's a  for John
Okay
Now this angle here, we're outside the bathroom and the maintenance guy's just about to open it up

Okay now the leadoff guy, he's gonna come in, he's gonna see the open field and he's gonna swing wide right to grab a spot against the wall
He's got one flank covered this way and for now he's feelin' pretty good -- and of course by doin' that, he's also settin' the tone for everything that happens after
ra
68
What's the main thing we're looking for, John
What does each individual guy feel he needs to get out of this
Well the crucial thing here, is makin' sure there's no eye contact
mean none - zero
These guys'll look up, they'll look down, they'll look straight ahead -- but a guy would rather have you poke both his eyes out with burning hot fire tongs, Dave, than to give the next guy over a reason to think you might be lookin' at him in a public bathroom
For reasons that oughtta be pretty darn obvious
Obvious indeed
Now here comes Guy Number Two -- The   comes in; John diagrams the call
Now Guy Number Two, what he's gonna do is, he's gonna come in, see the first guy in position along the wall and right away he's gonna line up wide on the opposite side
This is a best case scenario here, something both these guys can appreciate
Plus they've opened up the middle for the third guy -- The   comes in
John diagrams his path to the middle urinal
The Guy goes there
What about eye contact in this situation
Well you're still not likely to encounter any, but again if you do, that's what that buffer zone on either side of him's for
And all three of 'em are feelin' pretty lucky to have it,  can tell you that
Okay
Now if things stay like this
69
If things stay like this, you're fine - and if this were some small commuter airport, y'know late at night or somethin', then these guys could possibly even be home free
But we're talkin' Miami International here, this is the big time, we're talking about 747's, -10's, the big jumbo jets dumpin' off three- four hundred people at a clip
So everybody's gonna be next to somebody, which is the last thing any of these guys want
You're in a critical mass situation, and this is where a lotta mistakes get made
Which brings us to Guy Number Four
Here he comes -- -- and there he goes
Guy #4 spins around and leaves
John and Dave watch; then
Now one thing that  know we're going to get asked, John, especially from women, is whether, as guys, we're aware of how utterly stupid this kind of behavior really is
Well  think we know, Dave
Don't you think we know
think we do
() Have to be stupid not to

) We did that

Threads through who don't know he's there
If there's anything that causes more anguish in a guy than sports anguish, and public restroom anguish, and hardware store anguish, it's the day that he realizes that somehow his life is half over now, and no matter what he tries to tell himself, he's not young anymore and he's never going to be young again
(then he stops) And as any guy'll tell you - it sucks

Except men get it different
It doesn't show, y'see
The cramps don't come, the hot and cold flashes, and you don't have your magazines and drug stores filled with helpful stuff to do about it
But something comes, and it hits every guy who's living whether he likes it or not
Whether he knows it or not
Guy can lose his bleepin' mind if he doesn't watch out
He gets a mirror to show Dave the back
Gives him time to get philosophical
But you know
Maybe it's for the better
Maybe whoever designed all this, was afraid to let the men in on what was gonna be happening
Like if we knew, we'd bail or something
You know, ahead of time
: - The  wipes the bar down in front of Dave
'm just telling you what  see
Every lousy day
guy'll come in and sit down, right where you are
He loosens up a little and then it comes
The road not taken
Unexamined choices
An unfulfilled life
And other guys, they'll come in and don't say a word
The ones who just stare at the mirror
That sounds pretty bleak

Ancient times, you know

(') But now that men aren't doing that, there's a lot more shit up ahead, and none of it looks good so they go freak out and make a mess of things -- they'll quit their jobs or walk out on their marriages or make some other idiot grandstand move
None of them are happy and every single one of them wishes he did something else with his life and can't figure out how it got this way
Every single one of them
: '  - hotshot  is dictating a memo to his
therefore please be advised that in reference to the aforementioned subject matter, as per the original agreement dated 7 March Two Thousand, -- His Secretary stops writing

7 March Two Thousand
Um
You said that already
(shakes his head) started here on the 7th of March
Fifteen years ago
Oh
Well - Happy Anni-- What the hell am  doing
Why did even think this would be a good idea -- to work my ass off every single day of my life
So  could come in here and dictate letters like this
They're not all like this
You do a lot of good
73 And what does it get me -- a twin- turbo convertible that  don't even get to drive, because 'm always traveling and renting shitbox cars in other cities where all  do is take clients out to lunch and tell them how to negotiate their golden parachutes
You ever sit in the driver's seat of one of those renta cars
Well my husband usually does the -- Brand new cars, not even two thousand miles on them, and already they drive like camels
The seat's got no cushion left already, and you're lucky if you don't need a chiropractor after twenty minutes in one
What do people do in those things
Maybe  could get you something
You want something
Yeah
want something
want the number of that hang-gliding place out on Route 33
You want to go hang gliding
want to teach hang gliding
'm sorry
didn't know you did that
don't do that
want to do that
've always wanted to do that, and lots of other things too -- only 'm stuck doing this all day long
And don't even know what this is half the time, just that  have to spend every waking hour doing it
So you tell me -- where the hell does hang gliding fit into that
74
Um
Saturdays
Give me a break
(as he starts to leave) Where are you going
should have done this a long time ago
What about the letter
Put in the usual bullshit
Nobody's gonna read it anyway
He's gone
She sits there
: '    - lifts a titanium frame up onto the back of a pickup
Part of it catches on the lift gate and he , kicking it
About to really lay into it when the drives up in his twin turbo convertible and gets out
Hi
Sorry
We're closed
(stunned; watches him) -- It's two thirty in the afternoon
Hey
don't make the rules
Aren't you the owner
You're right
do make the rules
We're closed
75
(sees he means it) Look, there has to --  really want to learn this --  just quit my job to learn this
Be my guest - learn it
He kicks the frame again, walks off
The Lawyer watches
How can you do this
This is the perfect job
Yeah right
Driving around in a rusted worthless pickup truck that's about to be repossessed anyway, while a guy like you, my own age, is going around in a Porsche Carrera
But you get to fly
No, you get to fly
get to hoof this shit up and down these godforsaken hilltops listening to stockbrokers brag about getting lap dances from college coeds, and charging the whole thing through the company expense account -- while can't even deduct my blood pressure medication
That's what  get to do
He kicks a rock in the road, which almost feels good enough so he kicks another one -- but this one is buried in the dirt like an iceberg and doesn't budge -- Ahh,
-- and he falls down hobbling on one knee instead
: '  - Johnny Lake waits on the examining table, holding ice against his leg
The Lawyer sits on the extra chair reading 76
He holds up a : a Guy in a hammock, in Paradise
Look at this
You got that right
The Lawyer shakes his head; flips the page
Hey
(then on Lawyer's look; he shrugs) You don't think he's gonna
What
You know
Have to use the -- Glove
(then off his look) You hurt your knee
He already took the x-rays
What if something's broken
Well he's not going in that way
You don't do a rectal to set a guy's leg
Still the guy looks doubtful
The   - British, familiar - comes in, with a fresh -
Well you've done quite a number on yourself
Want to see
Why should
wouldn't know what the hell 'm looking at
You're the one who went to medical school
Don't remind me
(then on their looks) What
You think  like this
() 77 (') The medical profession
Owing my life to the insurance cartel while the rest of the world thinks 'm so stinking rich
Well
aren't you
Of courseIam - 'm an orthopedic surgeon
Ijust don't like people assumingit
( ) And this --  am so sick of this bloody thing  can't even tell you
Because every time it goes off it means  have to stop doing one thing don't want to be doing, and start doing another thing  don't want to be doing
You call that a life
They look at him
Don't know what to say
-- Let me show you something
(puts down the x-ray, goes to a drawer) 've been working on this during my free time
Not like  get any
He gets an accordion-style envelope; takes out a Hands it over to Johnny Lake
What is it
What is it
It's a screenplay
This'll blow the lid off the orthopedic surgery industry
Look - look here -- (takes it back; flips ) -- no wait, this part's better
No -- here
Here you go
Read this and tell me if you don't -- 78
He looks up
They're gone
: "      "  - The lot is filled with Ford Fiestas
The Lawyer and Johnny Lake drive up
When they pull the door open there's from inside
Then the    comes out, storms past them and throws his rag down hard as he gets the hell out of there and away from that shit job
As Dave walks into frame, starts over to his car
Okay
Well it looks like it's time to talk about sex
: : "   " (
0
) Will you knock it off
: - Dave gets out of his car and walks towards the mall
For the sake of any younger viewers who might still be paying attention, during this next segment we will be using certain euphemisms to describe a natural and wonderful thing that happens among grownups - grownups besides your parents, that is
: -   - Dave walks along all the ', , etc
Probably the fastest growing sector of the
economy is the sector that conducts surveys asking women () (') what is wrong with men
And in all those surveys, there is one main area that shows up constantly at the top of the charts
(he stops, pulls a ) -- Euphemisms
: '  - Dave walks up the aisles filled with delectable things
when  say "euphemisms,"  of course am not suggesting that guys don't have them
Guys have plenty of euphemisms
Most guys have more euphemisms in a single day - and here  am thinking of a day that occurred in the summer between ninth and tenth grades - than some women have in a lifetime - or longer, in the case of certain Math Teachers
: - Dave walks outside, past a line of  off a
It all goes back to a time, millions of years ago, when primitive males often had to complete their part of the equation quickly and right away stand ready to fight off attackers
: -  - Dave walks past glassed-in  of
Today, however, women want euphemisms too -- and this ability in males is no longer as prized as it once was
() 80
(') In fact, when modern women describe the qualities they're looking for in the ideal man, the phrase "a real fast shooter" is usually pretty far down the list
( ) Naturally, it fell to guys to do something about this
So, naturally - they did
: - Dave stands outside while Kelly and Gene come back from walking their dog
In a hurry
one technique for holding back the inevitable, is when the guy - just when he is about to have his euphemism - will hurl himself violently into an iron bed railing, and raise a lump on his head the size of a golf ball
: - They come in the room, shedding clothes
He lifts her, carries her to the bed -- with nothing but pillows against the wall
He stops, panicked
There's nothing there
: - Dave watches the
Turns back to the
In cases where there aren't any iron railings, a good backup technique can be found right on the end of the cold wet nose of the trusted family dog
to the window where we hear: 81
Yes
yes
yesyesyesyes
yesyesyesyes
just hold on
yes
yesyesyesyesYEEE00000WWWW
back to Dave
There are also mental techniques -- : '  - Roger and Elaine are under the sheets
Some good early as Dave comes in, holding a mike, interview style
One of the most time honored and reliable mental delaying styles, is the Baseball Method -- (taps Roger's shoulder) -- how's it going, Champ
Roger pokes his head out of the blanket; stays active from the neck down
Oh - yeah hi
( ; then to Dave) Well, the baseball thing
mean a while ago  was into that - big time
You know, fooling around with different lineups, mixing up the batting order - like thinking about what would happen if you took your cleanup guy and made him eighth or something -- just something stupid like that, you know
Stuff you'd never really do
And that did the trick
82
Oh hell yeah
mean  could go all night - literally all night - just shuffling my pitching staff around, or thinking about who  might try and sign at the winter meetings
Hang on -- He goes under the blanket; pays more attention to Elaine
then comes back
The thing is, it got stale
And found after a while  wasn't enjoying sex or baseball that much
And you don't want to mess with that stuff
(' ) So what do you do instead
Math problems
Really
(off his nod) You mean like if a train leaves Chicago at one o'clock and another train leaves Denver at two o'clock and they're going at different speeds
(shakes his head) can't do train ones
always end up imagining this beautiful girl on the train - and it makes things even worse
Elaine stops
Pops her head out
what beautiful girl
-- You, Elaine
The girl on the train is always you
Oh, Roger
83
Roger gives Dave a close call look
then goes back to work
: '  - Dave helps himself, makes a sandwich
As you can see, a lot of guys are making a tremendous effort here - and yet, according to certain standards they are still, basically, lame as hell on almost every single count
The reason for this is simple: women set the standards
(takes a bite) And not just bedroom standards -- all standards
Because women invented standards
Remember the Dawn of Guys
: - Long shadows
are still at it, pounding roots and dealing with
: '  - Primate Elaine, picking up around the cave
She stumbles on something gross
finally has had it
() That's it
: -  - Primate Elaine addresses the
All
've been thinking
We need some standards around here
What are standards
84
What is 'thinking
' The others turn, look at her
Look back at Primate Blaine
Standards are like rules
Things they'll have to do
And things they'll have to stop doing
How about "no leaving your dirty smelly loincloths wherever you feel like it, and expecting me to do something about it
" Can that be a standard
That can be one of the first
How about "No gnawing on a fish head during sex
" There are all kinds of things we can get them to do
How
They're stronger than we are
They smell stronger maybe
(off their laughter) like the smell
Of the men, or the rotten fish
There's a difference
More laughing; then they turn back to Primate Elaine
But how will we make them go along
Most of them can't even remember which cave to come home to every night
How are they going to remember rules
85
We'll give them a Look
look
special look
'Certain Look
' But we look at them every day
And they still do whatever they want
(as the others agree) 've been working on this
Watch
She turns to Primate Blonde Woman, who is holding a gourd
On the Look, the Blonde drops the gourd
See
And she wasn't even doing anything
Agreements and "Wows" go all around
Now who's with me
: , ""
, : - The Primate Guys come back lugging
Each now has his own , instead of the giant jagged slabs
What are you doing later
don't know
Probably just stare at the fire
86
bunch of us are going over to Primate Blonde Woman's cave to see what she does with those gourds
Want to come
-- Can't
Primate Elaine's ancestors are still here
Bummer
Tell me about it
() They are so Ice Age
: '  - Primate Roger watches Primate Elaine examine his
Her     hover on the edge of the discussion
don't get it
What was wrong with the other one
This one's better
It's an upgrade
' What did he say it was called
An 'upgrade
' An improvement on a previous design
' What
What'd he say
' (to his wife) An upgrade
An grade
(to Primate Elaine) The guy said there are newer ones coming out that'll make even this one look primitive
They're getting lighter and rounder every epoch
87 ' What guy
Primate Discount Manny
' () Boy he must have seen this one coming
Dad
(then to Primate Roger) just wanted to know what the difference is between this one and the one you had
You were so excited about it when you got it, and now you've gotten rid of it -- and the only difference  can see is where this one has these markings painted on
She holds it up; something like   going around
Those make it so it travels better
Painted on
(off his look) -- What'd it cost you
Nothing
couple wildebeeste steaks and handful of seeds of some kind
' told you
(then to his wife) Did  say he was a bum
Who's a bum
Are you calling me a bum
' No one's calling anyone a bum
' 'm just visiting
You do what you want
88
Oh yeah
Who do you think killed your dinner tonight
Look
Just take it back
Please
But  can't do that
All sales are final
You can explain it to him
Tell him he can keep the steaks, but we want the seeds back
' (to Primate Roger) don't mean to meddle
But you should listen to your wife
' That's meddling
That's meddling
(then to Primate Roger) -- But in this case she's right
(to her parents) Look will you both stop
(then to Primate Roger) Just take this back
All right
This is totally unreasonable
() Oh  get it
Don't tell me -- it's your time in the moon cycle again -- He stops cold
Stunned by her
History's first in  ,   , the way they do it when buildings explode in much bigger movies
-- 'll take it back
She smiles
: ,   - Dave strolls among the ,  etc
He has the with him; tosses it unconsciously like a baseball
89
This is basically where we stand today
The only difference is, we have way more standards
(gives the  to a passing by) There are social standards, about being sensitive - remembering anniversaries, listening during conversations, not eating soup with your hands, or sitting around in your underwear when company's over
: - Dave goes up the escalator; walks through the kind of 'Home Stylings' section where no other guy would go
Everything he talks about is on display in some form
-- And there are thousands of standards for domestic life, involving even more totally un-guy concepts -- like curtains, bedspreads, napkins, special hangers, little soaps shaped like fruit, and decorative boxes that hold tissues that already come in a box
While guys, left on their own in the wild, will develop lifestyles that don't involve any of these things
: - and   stand in their doorway
There is one window, a lot of dust and nothing else
know just what this place needs
() Hockey sticks
They turn around to go buy hockey sticks
: 90
- on a lawn chair drinks beer out of an ashtray
College Roger and College Gene play Indoor Death Hockey; slamming into walls, scattering  and   - as their
of course, even by the most basic standards, these two are living like savages
But they honestly don't know this -- because Guys, in their natural state, aren't any more aware of domestic standards than a trout would be aware of the stock market
And this causes women a lot of concern
: - - - Take laundry
To him his clean clothes are ready when he's ready to go get them
And they can dry the rest of the way in the drawer
But they don't dry the rest of the way in the drawer, they sit there in damp musty unfolded balls and he doesn't even mind, and  can't figure that out
What is the matter with folding something
What is the matter with waiting for it to be dry
: '   - Dave unloads a laundry basket on the bed
Starts folding the clean clothes and making piles
Laundry's a big issue - and a deep and puzzling mystery to guys
My own wife Michelle, for instance, is an accomplished sportswriter and mother of an extremely young child, yet she is still able to maintain a vigorous clothes-cleaning regimen bordering on the super-human
And 'm not allowed near the stuff
91
(comes in with more ) He's right
She dumps out the clothes, sees what he's doing and takes over, doing it better
Dave picks up a random , shows a  with lots of printing on it
These are clearly secret codes, that women intuitively understand but cannot adequately explain -- just like how a lot of guys understand the Infield Fly Rule, without being able to explain that
can explain the Infield Fly Rule
Because you're special, Sweetheart
: : " " - Dave anchors a semi circle with Sidra, Mia, Karla  and Lila
They take turns focus group style
Sometimes  think they're just like tapeworms
You know
mean tapeworms are just tapeworms - that's all they are, and all they'll ever be
They're just these repulsive little parasitic beasts and nobody expects anything different from them - because people know that's their nature
And it's the same way with guys - although a tapeworm's more likely to help clean out the garage
() They have to be the biggest and they have to be the best
And they can never back down from a challenge
Ever
92 They sleep with your sister and wonder what's wrong with that
They will make a game out of anything
contest out of anything
Give them a grain of sand and they will figure out some game with it
And they'll argue over the rules
(off their agreement) They leave their dirty dishes everywhere
can't believe the places 'll find some crusted over cereal bowl with yuckola blobs of God knows what in them
And the thing is, from his point of view
They really do get cleaned by magic
Because  can't take seeing them sit there, so  clean them
(to Karla ) just get him to wash my car when that stuff happens
Sweetheart he could wash my car with his tongue and it still wouldn't make up for where  find those dishes sometimes
(while they commiserate) So now that we've heard your thoughts
The frustration, the exasperation
the obvious question comes to mind: Why go through it
Why have guys in your life at all
They look at him
-- You mean as a choice
You mean like a mature adult choice to have a guy in your life
In spite of everything
93 Like trying to borrow money from you, after you've broken up, so he can buy something for his new girlfriend
And wondering what the problem was with that
mean like really not knowing
Dave looks at her
They all do
Until -- 'll tell you why
There is no good reason, that's why
The others turn, look her way
--  mean don't get me wrong
They really can be fun
You know, like a big stupid dog can be fun
mean not everything has to be so serious in life
You want to be able to do more with someone than just read book reviews together - which is something a guy would never do anyway
(then as the others ) But what a guy will do
Is at eleven o'clock at night he'll show up at your door and bring cheese steaks
And he doesn't care that you look all rumply and dreadful from not expecting anyone
He might not even remember that you're a vegetarian and don't eat cheese steaks -- but that doesn't really matter either
Because the point is he wanted one, and he can't come out and say it but he didn't want to eat it alone
And you're the person he thought of
(off her look; nods) can't tell you what that feels like, when they do that
(a beat; and then) swear, if they knew how adorable they are sometimes, they'd be dangerous
mean -- more dangerous
The other Girls think about that
Considering
94
-- Bullshit
They're tapeworms
The rest of them agree and all high-five her
Dave leans back from the fray, turns to the
think it's time for the conclusion now
: : " " '    - says "
" Dave is on top of the hill, in a rig that the - is fastening him into
Well now you know where things stand
You've learned a little bit about guys, and the critical roles they've played in the past and in modern society today
And for better or worse, they're here with us to stay -- so the best thing you can do about it, is continue to learn about them - by coming to see this movie lots and lots of times, and bringing more and more of your friends back every time you do
Because the more people that understand guys, the better for everyone
And the more people that -- (as the Lawyer launches ) -- Off he goes
right out of frame, and -- ,  -- : ,  ' : Roger now owns a 104-piece tool set, and he has successfully attempted to change his first switchplate
95
: Elaine has an open line of credit with Steve
, : Gene and Kelly won the Fred and Ginger Award in three straight ballroom competitions
Gene was right; they belong together
, : Sheryl Crow gave a concert in Central Park for half a million people a while back
We weren't there, but we have it on
: Richard
Nixon was finally elected President in 1968
He held that position until August, 1974, when he resigned in disgrace
: Agent Leopold and Agent Stearns were fired by the for gross incompetence
They now work in network television
: This man is not really an expert
If you see him, don't listen to any of his opinions
, : Rufino Lupenza is an imaginary ballplayer, created by the filmmakers to prove a point
However, if he did exist, and if he were any good, the Yankees probably would get him
And that would suck
-- Now these are the kinda end credits you like to see
You got the final update thing goin', where you find out how all the characters you've been watchin' are gonna turn out
You got good music, a lively kinda feel, and maybe most of all, the movie itself isn't too long -- He reacts now, looking down at the   as they start speeding up
96
-- that's how you know it's a real movie, in my book
That's how you know it's not some boring kinda art piece made by these tortured head case kids fresh outta film school -- you're not gonna come outta this theater talkin' about symbolism, or the use of darkness and light or any kinda mumbo-jumbo like that -- you come out of this movie and you're laughin'
And that's what  like in a movie - a movie that's funny but it doesn't take forever, you know
You still got some time to do somethin' after, maybe go get somethin' to eat, y'know
Because the guys behind the thing knew enough not to drag on and on and -- : : " " As the
