Written by Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg July 20, 2006 - - , which builds to an exciting crescendo filling us with the expectation of a thrilling, action-packed opening sequence
Instead we get: '  - Seth, seventeen, a bit heavyset, in the midst of a sad attempt at growing a goatee and clearly a terrible driver, cruises along while fiddling with the  player
He pulls out his cell and dials

He is on his cell phone
What's up
was doing research last night, for next year, and  think 'm gonna go with Bang Bus
Which one's Bang Bus
The one where they bang the chicks on the bus
Thirteen bucks a month
Total access, live Web Cam feed
The works
It'll be like 'm on the bus, banging them myself
That stuff's bullshit, they're all faking it
And plus, your parents are gonna look at the bill
It shows up under a different name

Bang Bus

Maybe  should just pick the one with the least dirty sounding name
Weapons of Ass Destruction's out then
Seth pulls up in front of a house
could tell my parents 'm doing a project on Rome and  have to research orgies

he is walking towards Seth's car
(still into phone) Yeah
Just tell them your taking a class on blow jobs
They both hang up and Evan gets in the car
Seth is about to pull away, when '  comes out the front door
' Thanks for taking him, Seth
Evan changes the radio station
Seth slaps his hand
Don't touch that
' You two are so funny
can't imagine what you'll do without each other next year
Evan told me you didn't get into State
Yeah, you know
got some other places
Good places
think we'll be fine
' Are you going to miss each other
Miss each other
No

Bye, boys
Seth and Evan drive off
am truly, truly jealous that you got to suck on those tits when you were a baby
Fuck you, man

There is a giant sign that reads "Seniors - Two Glorious Weeks Until Graduation"
Seth turns into the  parking lot

You're being an idiot, man
You really shouldn't park there
Fuck it
'm a senior about to graduate
They should be suckin' my balls
It's the least they can do for stealing three years of my life
They walk past  (18, big Native American guy) as they enter the store
Dimitri aggressively bumps his shoulder into Seth
What the hell's wrong with Dimitri
Oh, yeah dude,  forgot to tell you knocked the fuckin' shit out of him in capture the flag last week
Good
9th Grade Camp he gave me whiplash in "King of the Ring
"  fucking hate that guy
They go to the magazine rack and stare at a Maxim cover

They're like baby toes
It's not fair
have to hide every erection  get
Sometimes  get boners so big  can't hide them
And then  get nervous and my heart starts pounding, and it all just, like, feeds my boner
It just becomes this
thing
that's attached to me
And it won't go away
Just imagine if girls weren't weirded out by our boners and they actually wanted to see `em, like this shit
You know it's been, like, a year and a half since 've seen an actual human female nipple
Besides my mom's
saw it last month, and it was sick
Holy shit
Liat was two years ago guess so
She was insanely hot, though
Exactly
Too hot
That's what sucks
How can that possibly suck
'd be fuckin' psyched if 'd gotten with a girl that hot
You got, like, two dozen handjobs
And three quarters of a blowjob, But that was fuckin' it
It was the peak of my ass- gettin' career, and it happened way, way, way too early
You're like Orson Welles

5   : (2)                                                  5 Exactly
If 'd built up to it, 'd probably at least be having steady sex with a mediocre-looking girl at this point
honestly now see why Orson Welles ate his fat ass to death
You'll have sex in college
Everyone does
And if not, you'll have the Bang Bus
But the key is to be good at sex by the time you're in college
You don't want girls to think you suck dick at fucking
still think you've got a chance with Jules
She got mad hot over last summer, and clearly hasn't realized it, `cause she still flirts with you
Are you joking, man
Let's see here
she dated Dan Remick, Matt Muir, Josh Corber and what's-his-face
All of those were cool guys
She's been hot way longer than you think
Why would she end her high school career with me
Well, Helen got with Ariel Shafir
Yeah, and he was a complete fucking loser
You're a step up from that
Which is why you should stop being a pussy and do her
You could nailthe shit out of her for, like, two months before you leave
That bitch looks like a good fucker
Hey
'm sick of you talking about her like that, man
Evan starts to walk out
Seth follows
What, you can talk about that bitch all day every single day, but  can't say one thing about her

didn't insult her
said she looks like a good fucker
She looks like she can take a dick
That's a good thing
Some women pride themselves on their dick- taking abilities

, one of the rough-looking smokers, calls out
Yo
Seth
Did you hear 'm having the big grad party
Evan, a little scared, keeps his distance
No
Yeah
Terry spits on Seth's shirt
(') And you're not coming
Tell your fucking faggot friend he can't come either
Seth wipes the spit off
He looks at Terry and seems as though he's about to say something, but is interrupted when Terry starts hocking up more spit
Seth runs away as Terry and his friends laugh
He catches up to Evan and they head back to school
Wow
You really bitched out on that one
bitched out
You bitched out
You were across the street before  even realized what was going on
(beat) That guy's such a douche bag

We hear a  yell "Go

We  them from above
All the boys keep pretty much the same pace except for one runner who slowly lags behind
The group gets so far ahead of the him that he is alone in the frame
He stops

She`s a very tall girl and is athletic in a sexy way, wearing volleyball team sweat pants and a tank top
He looks up from her breasts to her face: she is staring right at him
He immediately looks to the front of the class, embarrassed
The bell rings and everyone leaves
Helen walks up to Evan as they enter the hallway
He's really nervous
She offers him a pen
Hey Evan, thanks for the pen
Oh, don't worry, no worries
Just keep it
Then you'll just have it, and you won't have to borrow another pen
Thanks
uh
was going to ask you, did you hear about Terry's grad party
It's going to be so insane
Yeah, it's a maybe
But, you know, gotta,  got my

so, you know
Fun shit
But , like, never see you at any parties or anything
Because of all the other fun shit 'm off doing
(playful) Okay
So why weren't you at Dimitri's party on Saturday
Dimitri's
uh
didn't want to go, because, well,  did other stuff
Saturday
(nervous, he desperately thinks) Oh yeah
Saturday night was awesome
(The real version of Evan's story is shown through a montage of quick flashbacks
) (') (
) First my parents went out to a double feature, so a bunch of people came over
'  - 9                                                                  9 Seth is there
Evan and him are surfing the Bang Bus web site
arrives with a bottle of Sambuca
Fogell is one of those seniors who looks like he's thirteen years old
and we had a couple drinks in my basement
An empty bottle of Sambuca in front of them and empty beer cans at their feet, the three boys each shotgun a beer
(') (
) and Seth's parents were having this cocktail party, and we went over there to, like, mingle

'  - 10                                                                  10 Seth's parents are having a fancy cocktail party
The boys are drunk as hell
and there were actually some really interesting and, like, entertaining people there
The boys laugh hysterically as they each shake Tobassco Sauce onto their tongues
They writhe around in agony as several adults look at them like they are morons
(') (
) and, uh, then we saw some, uh, live music
'  -  - 11                                                                  11 In Seth's basement, the boys violently wrestle
Evan gives Fogell a bloody nose, but they all can't help but laugh
then we went to a club downtown
- 12                                                                  12 The bouncer of a dirty strip club rejects them
and then we pretty much called it a night and went home
- 13                                                                  13 Evan pukes all over Seth
Evan and Fogell laugh hysterically as Seth yells at them

you would've loved it
That sounds so fun
would love to go do something like that

14   :                                                        14 Yeah
well, you know, me and Seth are always cooking up
uh
fun little
events
Helen is disappointed in his response
So, are you guys going to the same school next year
Nah
We were going to but, uh, we got into different ones
What are you going to do without him
Same shit 've always been doing
It'll be fine
Don't worry about it
'm not

The blackboard reads, :
The ingredients are listed below
Seth is talking to the cooking teacher
Mrs
Grier,  joined this class because thought 'd be cooking with a partner
It's not fair
She's never here
don't get twice the marks for doing all the work
didn't invent odd numbers, Seth
Look at Evan
Evan is playfully throwing flour at a tiny Japanese boy
They both laugh hard
(') While 'm over in my unit, isolated and alone, eating my terrible-tasting food because  can't even properly mix ingredients by myself,  gotta look over at that

Evan then turns around and ties the boy's apron
They both look happy

And that is
'm like a single mother
Well, save it for next week
Today Jules' partner isn't here either
Pair up with her
Station four
Jules
The teacher walks away
Seth looks over to station four, nervous as hell
: Jules, well-dressed and "popular" looking
She stands alone at station four, laying out utensils
Seth musters his courage and walks towards Jules
He stops, unsure of what to say
Hey Seth, your partner didn't come again
That's kind of a personal question
What
(nervous) Nothing
It was my attempt at humour
Well, uh, maybe  kidnapped her so you'd be forced to work with me
There's my attempt at humour
Well,  would call that a success
(reading recipe sheet) Marscampone
scamponee cheese
Is that some kind of new cheese or something
All cheese tastes the same to me anyway
Except blue cheese
That stuff is sick

Yes
My older brother always eats blue cheese
You know that stuff is actually moldy
Like, they tell you it's moldy, then they tell you to eat it anyway
Well whoever "they" are, they can eat my dick

What are you doing tonight
don't know, probably nothing
Why
My parents are out of town and 'm thinking of having a party
don't know how big it'll be, but you should come anyways
Yeah
Sure
That sounds fun
love parties
Really
don't usually see you at them
Oh, uh
It's more of, like, a love-hate thing
Right now  love them, though
Uh
how do  do this
'll write down my address and number

Evan is standing by the sink scrubbing a tray
Behind him, at the table, is the small Japanese boy eating the tiramisu

: Fogell entering the room (') (whispering) Don't tell Fogell about the party
Hey guys,  was walking here, and on the way,  saw Nicola, and she was wearing these tight white pants and a black g- string and you could see it right through the pants

She turns and notices Fogell
He gives an awkward look
It's nine thirty

told her what time it was
It was awesome
She's got the nicest ass
Like you'd know what to do with it
Ha ha
'm really gonna miss your knee- slappers when me and Evan are at State
(pissed) Yeah, well 'll be at Junior college where the girls are half as smart, and thus twice as likely to blow me
What are you guys doing tonight

Sorry
You'll just have to fingerbang yourself
(to Fogell) What you doing
Well, Seth always said  was too much of a pussy, but he was wrong
It's been arranged
At lunch, 'm going to the same place Mike Snider went to pick up my brand new false identification card
Dude
That's perfect, `cause, Evan, didn't you just say that you heard about a party
(to Evan) Why didn't you tell me
Shut up
Who cares
Just be happy he told
And hey
Now you can buy the booze
Sounds cool
Cool
(
) If you're not in this class, leave this class
Well done, man
We'll see you after class
Fogell leaves
Did you tell that nimrod you're not going to room with him
Uh
no, not yet
You better, man
That guy is a poon-tang repellent
Seth sees Jules coming

What's the hold up
We're getting a fake
Well, you two have four more years to cuddle, so let's get to work
Actually, we're going to different schools
Really
You're cutting the cord
What's going to happen
Nothing
Jesus
Yeah
What do people think is gonna happen
That's what  don't get
We're not, like, dependent on each other
We met when we were 8, we were fine before then
It's not like we do everything together

So it looks like we get a little graduation party after all

Seriously
Why do you hate her
Is there even an actual reason
Because seriously, 'm beginning you think you like her
Hell no
hate her
Why
was never going to tell you this story, because  knew that if you heard it you would never want to get with Helen, but over the last few weeks 've been having a hard time thinking of a reason not to
So, here it is
Helen and  went to elementary school together, right

Can you get us drinks
Ummm
don't know
think
maybe
(half joking) Come on, you scratch our backs, we'll scratch yours
Well, funny thing about my back
It's located on my cock
Shirley is offended
Jules laughs a little
Seth laughs too hard
(') Ha
Alright, sure
can do that
What do you guys want
Well, this is actually, like, a big favor, but, well, my parents gave me like a hundred bucks to feed myself for the week, but the house if full of food, so figure  should just spend all of it on extra drinks for the party
Wow
would never even think of doing something that nice
Jules hands Seth a hundred dollars

30   : (2)                                                 30 Well, this is really nice of you
mean, really appreciate this
Seth can't believe what he's hearing
He can barely contain his smile
Should  just get, like, a shitload of different shit
Whatever shit you think people would like,  don't really know
want Mike's Hard Lemonade
Okay
'll see you tonight
Yeah
'll see you
The girls walk off, leaving Seth lost in thought
He suddenly runs down the hall
- 31                                                                  31 Evan is standing alone amidst the rest of his gym class as they play soccer
Evan, get into the game
Evan says nothing and the teacher soon redirects his attention elsewhere
Evan sees Seth jogging towards him
(out of breath, worked up) Man, just - Evan, listen to me
You know Jules
You know what she just did
She came up to me and asked me if  would buy her alcohol
Not just her, her whole party
Do you know what that means
It means that by some miracle, we were paired up, we talked, and she actually thought of me afterwards
Thought of me enough to decide that  was the guy that she was going to trust the fun-ness of her party with
She wants me
She fucking wants my dick
() 21
31   :                                                       31 Did you ever think maybe she's just using you to get her alcohol
Of course  thought of that () 32                                                                    32 The same scene as before with Seth and Jules in class
Yeah
My older brother always eats blue cheese
You know that stuff is actually moldy
- 33                                                                    33 She has an older brother
She could have asked him, but she asked me
She looked me straight in the face and asked me
She wants to fuck me, man
Do you understand that
Fucking
Today is the day that fucking has become possible
Are you stupid
You're not going to be able to sleep with her tonight
She's going to be at the party, she's gonna be drunk, and she likes me at least a little, so  can get with her
Then, make her my girlfriend, and then  fuck her all summer long
Then, by the time college rolls around, 'm the fuckin' fucking master, man
Make her your girlfriend
Of course
That's good
So, hypnosis, love potion, or mind-control helmet
Once 've gotten with her,  write her love letters, flowers, 'll do anything - 'll be the most pussy-whipped guy in the universe - what chick wouldn't go out with a guy like that
() 22
33   :                                                       33 The soccer ball rolls towards them
They both watch as it rolls by
What the hell, Evan
Evan shrugs back
(') Fuck you, man
Fuck off, Greg
Why don't you piss your pants again
That was, like, eight years ago, asshole
He runs off
(to Evan) Wanna hear the best part
(sarcastic) Oh,  haven't
Helen
Evan looks upset, assuming that Seth is about to trash-talk Helen, as usual
(') You do the same thing, man
Buy Helen her alcohol
Then, tonight, when you guys are both drunk, get with her
This is the last party we're ever going to go to as high school people
've fully ignored my hatred for Helen in coming up with this, which is a big ass deal
We need to stop being pussy and for once just goes balls out, man
Evan seems to be swayed
should get Helen alcohol
Of course
It'll be pimp, and then you know she'll be drunk
() 23
33   : (2)                                                 33 Have you talked to Fogell
You talk to Helen, 'll find that retard Fogell
- 34                                                                  34 Everyone is rushing to class
Evan hurries through the halls and finds Helen at her locker
Hey Helen
Hold up
Did you hear about the party tonight
Yeah,  just heard
It sounds sweet
You're not coming, are you
No, no,  am
That's why  came looking for you
Me and some guys are going to the liquor store after class, so  was thinking  could buy you yours, if you needed someone to
Yeah
That'd be great, that'd save me such a hassle, cause  was going to beg my sister, but yeah, could you get me, like, a bottle of Goldschlager
'll pay you back tonight
You will absolutely not
It's my treat
Wow
Thanks, Evan
Evan swings a friendly little punch at Helen's shoulder, but someone walks into him, causing him to nail her in directly in the tit
(') Hey
You punched my tit
(mortified) 'm sorry
Shit, shit
'm so sorry just wanted to give you a friendly nudge in the arm, you know
'm so sorry
() 24
34   :                                                        34 (giggling) Don't worry about it
So 'll see you at the party
Yeah
'll see you then
'm so sorry about that
- 35                                                                     35 Seth is waiting angrily in front of the school
Evan comes out the front doors
That douche bag isn't back yet, 've been standing here with my thumb up my ass
did it, dude
even offered to pay for it
It was pimp
Whoa
That is fucking pimp
Why didn't do that
Shit
The bell rings
- 36                                                                     36 Seth and Evan work side by side in the woodshop
(yelling over the machines) That's what we get for trusting a mental midget
He's fucking it all up
bet he pussied out, just like  said he would
- 37                                                                     37 Seth and Evan walk out the front door
mean, what are we going to tell the girls
"Sorry, we couldn't do what we promised because we're dickless incompetents
" We'll never get laid because of that little ass-fuck
How did he get in to State
He's got shit for brains
Shit
How else can we get liquor
(
) Hey guys

37   :                                                        37 Seth and Evan turn around to see Fogell running after them
Where have you been
Yeah
You almost gave me a goddamn heart attack
You better fucking have it, where is it
got it
It's flawless
It's great, man, look
Fogell reaches into his pocket and pulls out the fake
Evan grabs it
(reading the card) Okay Mr
"McLovin"
What kind of a stupid name is that
What are you trying to be, an Irish & singer
Well, they let you pick any name you want when you get there
So you picked McLovin
It was between that or Muhammad
Why was it between that or Muhammad
Why didn't you just pick a common name
Actually, Seth, Muhammad is the most commonly used name on earth
Have you ever actually met a guy named Muhammad
Have you actually ever met a guy named McLovin
No
That's why you picked a bad name
() 26
37   : (2)                                                 37 You probably have federal agents tracking you for even considering the name Muhammad on a fake
Look at this shit man, you don't even have a first name
It just says ": " One name
just thought McLovin sounded old, and the chicks would dig it
Under what circumstances would you ever have to show a chick your
She could ask
Or,  could just show it to her
Holy shit
don't believe this
This says you're fucking 25
Why didn't you just put 21
knew you would ask that
Look, every day, dozens of kids roll into the liquor store with fake 's trying to act like Joe Casual
Each and every one of these kids just so happens to be 21 years old
Just how many 21 year-olds do you think there are
Fool
Calm down
It's not terrible
This might work, but it's up to you, Fogell
They'll either think, "Oh, it's another punk kid with a fake
" Or, "Look, it's McLovin, the twenty five year-old organ donor"
What's it gonna be
Fogell takes a deep breath
() 27
37   : (3)                                                37 am McLovin
You're not McLovin
No one's McLovin and this is never going to work
We need a new way to get alcohol
Could we drive to Canada or something
still think it's going to work
They walk into the staff parking lot
Seth stops
What the fuck
Where's my car
told you, man
What did  say
told you that was a dumb idea
Why would you park in the staff- Shut up, Fogell
`Cause you're not staff
am aware of that, Fagell
Seth storms off
Evan follows him
(yelling) Will you still pick me up from work
Evan and Seth round the corner, leaving Fogell behind
Let's go to your house

Evan is playing the video game Grand Theft Auto

Take a bit from every bottle
Piece of cake
It's not exactly what Jules wanted, but it'll do, right
Come on
Just wear what you wore to school
told you  can't do that
can't let Jules see me in the same shit  wore at school
It's completely unbecoming
Why don't you just go to your house and get your own clothes
`Cause this is stupid
You're stupid
can't go home
Then my mom will know the car got towed and 'll be grounded tonight
'll just stay here all weekend and pick it up on Monday
(: video game) Where the fuck is the dirt bike
(beat) Ah, screw it
'm just gonna kill everyone
Boom
Die, piggies
Don't you have bigger clothes
See what my dad's got

Not bad, eh
It's, like, 7:30 and my Mom's still here

'll fuck your Mom in the basement while you steal the liquor
Fuck you, asshole
Let's just sneak down there and grab it
'  - 40                                                                     40 Evan and Seth, carrying an empty two liter bottle of Coke, cautiously descend the creaking staircase
Their eyes watch the  room, where Evan's mom is on the phone
The boys enter the dining room and cautiously open the liquor cabinet
Seth enthusiastically reaches for a bottle
(whispering) Alright, dude
Get ready to receive
Evan begins unscrewing his bottle, when he notices a little black line marking where the liquor bottle is filled to
Then, he realizes that every bottle has it
(whispering) can't believe it
They marked them
(whispering) What do you mean they
oh, man
Your parents are fuckers
What do we do now
(whispering) Shh
We
we
take some and fill it back up with water
Get ready, 'll get water
Evan hurries off
Seth looks at the liquor cabinet, trying to choose the best booze
He grabs a massive bottle of gin
Evan reappears
(') (whispering) Gin
That stuff is literally undrinkable
(whispering) It's the biggest bottle, you douche
Just do it
She's right in the other room

40   :                                                      40 Evan reluctantly holds an empty Coke bottle as Seth shakily pours the gin in
Evan starts refilling the gin bottle with water, when suddenly they both hear his mom coming
(whispering) Run
(whispering) But, the booze
(whispering) Take it
Seth runs off with the gin and Coke bottle
Evan quickly closes the cabinet and sneaks off right before his mom enters
Through the window she see's that Seth is already on the front lawn and thinks nothing of it
(') Bye, Mom
Love you
' Love you, sweety
Evan leaves

Seth holds up the gin
Look at this mother
Smell it's glory
He opens it up and takes a whiff
(') Mmm
It's good
Barely a scent
He takes a crazy big swig
(') See that
always said  had the highest alcohol tolerance
'm like Superman
Seth taste another swig, but makes a strange face
Evan grabs the bottle and takes a swig
It's fucking water

41   :                                                     41 Water
(drinks again) Fuck
Your brother beat us to the punch
We have to go back
We can't go back
She totally knew, she'll bust us for sure, and we have to meet Fogell
Well, fuck
fine
Text your brother he's a stupid piece of crap
Evan pulls out his cell and chuckles as he types

They see Fogell walking towards them
He's in his uniform holding a hanger with a shirt and a vest
What the hell is that
vest
You're gonna look like a Pinocchio
What
It's just a vest
Yeah
How many high schoolers you see in vests
(eyeing Shopwell's) You know, they got a ton of liquor right in there
If we get it now we can get to the party faster with all of Jules' shit
No way
work there
They know 'm not twenty-five
Nobody said anything about you, dick- mouth
You have one name on your
It's out of the equation

'm gonna steal the booze
What
No
Hell no
You can't do that
(mocking) Yeah, right
That's right
And that way  give Jules back her money, like you did with Helen
That was good thinking, that's fucking pimp
That's how you seal a deal
It won't be hard
Remember Dan Vertlieb stole a keg from here and he's got, like, really bad scoliosis
You're not gonna steal it
Fogell, he's not going to steal it
Please
Don't do this
promise
'll get the liquor later
'm stepping up
And once 'm up,  don't step back down
Maybe you "State" boys don't understand that
Seth walks to the store

He spots a standing by one of the registers
(to himself) Hope piggy can run
He walks past the registers, which brings him in front of the long liquor aisle
He surveys the scene
There is an browsing the shelves
Seth looks over to the registers

He has a huge amount of booze in the conveyor belt
How old are you

Thank you kindly
You're welcome, Seth

She drops her big purse
hand reaches down and picks it up
It's Seth
Excuse me, ma'am
You dropped your purse
Would you like me to help you to your car
That would be lovely, young man
Would you like me to buy you alcohol
That would be lovely

He takes it and looks down at it in his hands
big golden label reads, "
" (
) Don't do it kid
We see that the Security Guard is right behind him
Seth doesn't look up, he just stares at the bottle dramatically
never had a choice
He throws the bottle at the guards face
The guard blocks it with his billy club, grabs another bottle, and hurls it at Seth
Seth dodges it by an inch; the bottle hits the in the head
(in agony) Before Seth can do anything, the guard smashes a 40-ounce bottle of beer across his face
The guard  the broken end of the bottle and cuts Seth's throat
Blood spurts out
Seth drops his bottles and falls to the ground

Oh, and, uh, my Mom said we can have the from her basement and 've got, like, three lava-lamps and one strobe light, so like, we can have that in the room- Evan sees Seth coming out of Shopwell's

Seth's coming
You still didn't tell him we're rooming- No

was gonna do it, but security was tight as shit
was gonna do it though, don't think  wasn't
Let's go to the liquor store and try your stupid
Seth heads towards the bus stop
Wait
'm gonna put my vest back in my locker

Nothing happens whatsoever

Well, here we are
Fogell, are you ready
Here's the list
list
Why
We're getting girls their booze so they'll get with us
put a lot of thought into that list
It's the perfect party bar, so don't mess it up and get Sambuca again
Fogell reads the list
worried look sweeps across his face
Ouzo, Drambuie, Jager, Gold-shlay-ger- Goldschlager
That's for Helen, so do not forget it
-Alize, Captain Morgan Rum, Smirnoff Rasberry and a big ass bottle of Popov- () 36

This is too much
can't get away with this much
What's the difference
Seth hands Fogell the money
don't know, man
'm getting, like, really nervous
Fogell starts breathing very hard and making an while doing so
Are you okay
What the hell are you doing
don't know if  want to do this
What are you talking about
You just promised you would
What is this shit
What if they turn me down
Then we're in the same place that we're in right now
It's fucking humiliating
Everyone in the store sees them kicking me out
What if they make me put all the liquor back on the shelf
can't do that
This whole thing is bigger than you, asshead
Just go in there and buy the damn alcohol
What if  don't feel like it anymore

51   : (2)                                                 51 Then  will kill you
How's that
If you don't buy the alcohol,  will kill you
Killing me won't get you any alcohol, jerkoff
'm the one with the
Then  will kill you, cut off your ugly face, put it over mine, and buy it my fucking self
You don't have the technology or the steady hands to pull off a procedure like that
Seth stands for a moment, then suddenly rushes Fogell
Evan stands between them and breaks it up
Seth, calm down
Fogell, stop being a baby and go buy the alcohol
You said you'd do it, so do it
It's why you bought the , so just go do it

Fogell walks into the store

Fogell is confused, dizzy, and sweating
He steps behind a large beer display and takes a few deep breaths
Hi there
Fogell flinches, shocked someone spoke to him
He keeps walking
He nears a mother and her 17 year old
As Fogell passes them, the son seems to recognize him
Fogell clearly recognizes the son
Their eyes meet
Fogell looks in the opposite direction
Fogell

Yo, Fogell
`Sup man
What're you doing here
(weird voice) Uh
nothing
Not Fogell
(whisper) Shut up, Moscovitch
You don't know me
(knowingly) Oh, oh
Cool, cool
Good luck
He puts his head down and quickly walks away
He arrives at the beer and cooler section
Clearly intimidated, he slowly opens a beer fridge
He grabs one beer attached to a six-pack and pulls it forward
The beer comes loose in his hand as the other five fall to the ground, cracking on impact, and spraying beer all over the place
Fogell scrambles to stop the beers from spraying, but soon finds that it is impossible
Fuck
approaches Fogell
Is there a problem, sir
Umm, nope, no problem whatsoever
(pointing to the beer on the floor) Sir, did you do this
On the floor
(beat) No
(beat) think it happened before
Fogell is standing in a puddle of beer with beer sprayed all over his legs, holding a can of beer

52   : (2)                                                 52 Are you sure
think  would know, thank you
Fogell walks away
- 53                                                                  53 Fogell has a shopping cart filled with booze
He gets in line to pay
He looks ahead to the -  (35) who is currently at the  (woman) paying
Um, yes, may  please see some
- No problem
Heh
haven't been -ed in years
Anyone who looks under thirty-five
The guy looks through his wallet
Fogell nervously watches
- 54                                                                  54 Seth and Evan peek through one of the store's front windows
It's a good , right
Mike Snider never had a problem
It's fine
Right
Calm down
(beat) Did you remember a condom
You brought a condom
Yeah,  figured, you know, might as well
brought one of those little things of spermicidal lube too
He takes them out of his pocket
You asshole
You laughed in my face when said we'd be having sex tonight
() 40
54   :                                                        54 It doesn't mean you shouldn't be prepared
You didn't even bring one
No
That wasn't the plan
We had a plan
can't believe you did that without even consulting me about it
don't really even understand what your plan is
'm gonna go down on her for, like, hours
She'll love that
She'll want to go out with that
Yeah, but  figured there's no harm in bringing just one little condom
And one little bottle of spermicidal lube
That's nuts
You can't let her know you brought that
These girls are 18, not dried up old ladies
They're ready to go
Fine
won't bring the lube
- 55                                                                     55 Fogell pushes his stuff up to the Cashier
She looks at him kind of funny
Hello
(reading name tag) Mindy
She rings up a six pack of Budweiser
(') Oh,  love that stuff
Been drinking it for years
heard they recently decided to start adding more hops
Fogell just nods kind of proud of himself
She stops ringing stuff up and looks at him
() 41
55   :                                                       55 Umm, okay sir, 'm gonna need to see some Identification
- 56                                                                     56 Seth and Evan are still leaning against the window
Do you think  could get Helen to do some kind of long distance thing
Seth looks as if he sees something in the distance
He stands upright
Holy Shit
It's Cary Hutchins
haven't seen her since she switched schools
She had the biggest tits in the universe
Down the block there is a girl walking a dog
heard she had breast-reduction surgery
Her tits must be crazy perfect now
gotta see these bastards
Let's check `em out
Seth and Evan run off towards the girl
(') Man, 'm gonna pretend to trip and grab `em
(beat) hope they've healed
: - 57                                                                     57 The cashier is still examining the card
She hands it back to Fogell
() 42
57   :                                                     57 That comes to a total of $123
59 huge smile forms on Fogell's face as he pulls out a wad of money and hands it to the cashier
She starts to gather his change when, , a   runs up and  Fogell right in the side of the head
Fogell falls to the ground
The dude sticks his hand in the open register, grabs a handful of money and runs
The whole thing is over in a matter of seconds
Fogell is on the ground, dazed and confused
What the hell happened
Fogell sees the distressed cashier frantically dialing the police
(breathing hard) don't believe it
don't believe it
- 58                                                                  58 Seth and Evan walk down the street towards the liquor store
That was a waste
But she fully looked way better before thought when they reduced them, they just kind of reshaped them nicer
Made them more supple
can't even begin to imagine the justification for making breasts smaller
It's like me making my nuts saggier
Evan sees something in the distance
Whoa
What's this
What
() 43
58   :                                                        58 Check it out
The cops
They see a cop car with the lights flashing parked outside the liquor store
Seth and Evan cautiously approach the liquor store and look inside
They see two  talking with the Cashier, and Fogell is standing right beside them
(') Shit
They busted Fogell
- 59                                                                     59 The two police,  , 30 and experienced, and , 25 and learning, are talking to the Cashier
Fogell stands beside them, nervous and afraid
(to cashier) So, did he punch anyone else
(losing it completely) can't do this, okay
told you, have an exam tomorrow
Can you understand that
goddamn exam
The cashier breaks down crying and walks off to the back of the store
The officers look at each other
Apparently, she has an exam
They chuckle
Then they turn to Fogell
(turn to Fogell) So then, son, you're the one that got punched
Fogell looks down to his bags of liquor at his feet
Then back at the cops
He nods
We'd like to ask you a couple questions
The officers each take out a note pad and a pencil
(') Okay, first things first
What's your name
() 44
59   :                                                      59 Fogell looks like his heart is about to explode out of his chest
My name, it's
it's
(tripping over his own words) Mc
mac
laddle
MicMac what
No, no  said, "McLovin"
McLovin
McLovin
The officers both write down some information
Cool name
And your first name
Fogell looks twice as scared
Oh
that's uh
a good one
it's a
an interesting
uh
event
Fogell trails off mumbling and starts to breathe heavily, making an
Behind him, in the window of the store, we see Seth and Evan peeking through
- 60                                                                   60 Shocked, Seth and Evan walk away from the window
Seth starts to pace in anger
don't believe this bullshit can't
this isn't happening
didn't even know you could get arrested for this shit
Oh my god
Are they gonna take him downtown
Fuck Fogell
He got arrested
We're on our own
() () 45
60   :                                                        60 (') We need a new way of getting liquor
(realizing) The money
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
How much money can you get
What are you talking about
Money
What about Fogell
That doesn't matter anymore
just lost a hundred dollars of Jules' money
We have to help him
Help him
What are we gonna do
Bust him out of jail
don't even know where jail is
What we need is the alcohol, which is impossible because we don't have any fucking money
Seth steps into the driveway leading to the parking lot
Fine
Just
calm down
We need to think
We need to think
Fuck thinking
We need to act
Suddenly, a car pulls out of the lot going 10 mph and knocks Seth down
- 61                                                                     61 The cops are still talking to Fogell
He looks completely flustered
He's lost his composure
Okay, your name is just McLovin, there's no need to get irrational
In the  (not in the view of Fogell and the cops) we see  of the car, a shady-looking guy in a hockey jersey, gets out of his car and walks over to where Seth is lying, apologizing frantically
lot of people have strange names these days
() 46
61   :                                                       61 once arrested a man-lady who was legally named "Pearl Necklace
" It's just
changed my name
was going to be a singer
&
Fine
That's not illegal
And, how old are you McLovin
Fogell looks down at the bags of booze again
Old enough
Old enough for what
Can  see your
Um
okay
Fogell takes his shaking, sweaty hand, sticks it in his pocket, and pulls out his fake
He slowly hands it over to Officer Slater
The cops both look at it, then Fogell
Beads of sweat are running down Fogell's face
In the background, Seth pops up and starts kicking the guy's car out of anger
Evan and the driver both restrain Seth
You're an organ donor
What
didn't want to be one but my wife insisted
Just like a woman
Even after you're dead, they want to tear your heart out
The officers start laughing
Fogell is shocked
They hand back the

61   : (2)                                               61 Look
'm really sorry, but  don't really have any information
didn't really see him
His fist hit here
Fogell points at his giant black eye
Are you in a hurry or something
Uh, yeah
kinda
kinda had to catch a bus
Where were you going
Umm
near thirteenth and Granville
We'll take you there, get your information on the way
Sit tight
Fogell is completely dumbfounded
- 62                                                                62 The driver is pleading with Seth and Evan
'm so sorry, man
'm so sorry
didn't see you at all
Are you okay
Are you okay
'm sorry, man
Look, what can do
Are you okay
The driver glances at the cop car
(') mean, please don't report me, we can figure this out, okay
Why wouldn't  report you
Because 'll do anything
Please
Anything
What can  do
You have any money
() 48
62   :                                                        62 (quietly to Seth) What are you doing
(beat) Fine
Just take it
The driver reaches into his pocket and hands Seth some money
Seth looks at it
It's seven dollars
What is this
This isn't enough
Seth stuffs the money in his pocket
It's all  have
Well, you just came from the liquor store, give us your liquor
didn't get any
They're not letting anyone in
They're arresting someone or something
Well, they'll be arresting somebody else if you don't do something quick
Ow
My shoulder
It's killing me
Seth, acting poorly, pretends he's way more hurt than he is
No
Wait
Okay, you want alcohol
can get you alcohol
'm on my way to   this party right now
There's gonna be   tons of liquor
will definitely get you   plenty
You better
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hold on
Come here
Seth goes over to Evan
(') What are you doing

62   : (2)                                              62 What
Jules' money is gone, Fogell's out, we've got no other option
Let's go
don't
don't like this idea at all
'm just not feeling it
That guy's fucking creepy
Just look at him
They look at the Driver, who is staring at Evan with a dumb expression on his face
(to Evan) You know a guy named Jimmy, perchance
Cause you totally look like his brother
He's an idiot
And he's our only hope
Come on, don't break your promise to Helen
- 63                                                                 63 The Driver's car pulls away with Seth and Evan sitting in the back seat
few moments later, the cops walk out with Fogell right behind them carrying the bags of liquor
(to Fogell) Man, that lady just wouldn't stop crying, huh
And you're the one that got punched
Did you hear her say she has an exam tomorrow
Boo-fuckin'-hoo
Am  right
(afraid) Heh
Good one
Could we have taken her in
Just to scare the shit out of her
Hah
Probably could have found a way
But a good general rule is only take people in you want to ride with
And whiny bitches don't make that cut
The cops chuckle as they all get in the cop car

'  - 64                                                                  64 Seth and Evan sit in the back seat
The Driver is in the front
One of you bros could have sat up here with me
There is an awkward silence, when suddenly Seth starts to wriggle in discomfort
Aaah
Seth fishes his cell phone out of his pocket and looks at it
(') 875-6611
(thinking) Holy shit
Seth answers the phone
(') Jules
What's the haps
Who is it
: - 65                                                                  65 There are six girls passing two beers in a circle while dancing blissfully to crappy 80s music
Seth
Where are you
Jules
just got in a cab and 'm going to the liquor store as we speak
Awesome
can't wait for you to get here
huge smile sweeps across Seth's face
Really
() 51
65   :                                                        65 Yeah
It looks like it could actually be a great party
think, like, tons of people might show up
hope they don't trash my house
Well, if they want to do that they're going to have to get through me
So  guess  don't have to worry then
'll see you soon
Seth hangs up the phone, completely elated
She called, man
That's insane
She's practically begging for it
She said, " can't wait for you to get here
" That sounds like she fully wants it
Where's she gonna get it from, huh, my man
Seth and Evan are very weirded out
- 66                                                                     66 The Driver's car pulls up in front of a house
The three get out
Hey, are you sure that it's cool we're here
Oh, definitely
'm essentially best friends with this guy
whole bunch of my buddies are coming
Come on
The Driver runs into the house happily, Seth and Evan following closely behind
- 67                                                                     67 The boys enter the house and stand by the front door of the huge party
It's in full swing with all sorts of random- looking people
Nobody is under the age of 25
This is weird
() 52
67   :                                                        67 Whatever
Just act casual
And old
All we gotta do is find the booze and haul ass out of here
As they make their way down a hallway, a few people give them looks
- 68                                                                     68 They enter the kitchen, where Seth spots what they've been looking for
There are big buckets of ice filled with beer, coolers, wine, vodka, everything
Holy shit
Let's grab one of these buckets and go
(
) What the fuck do you think you're doing
(
) What, man
It's nothing
The guys turn and see that in corner of the kitchen, the Driver, holding a phone, is being yelled at by a massive brute,
You calling more of your stupid friends again
Ya prick
Mark, calm down, okay
Just relax
Get the fuck out of my house
Mark, come on
What the heck
Don't be a dick
Suddenly, Mark grabs the Driver by the back of the neck and drags him out of the kitchen, down the front hall and out the door
group of people follow, including Seth and Evan
- 69                                                                     69 The Driver get pushed out of the door and lands on the front lawn
Seth and Evan watch from the doorway of the house, a group of people in front of them
() 53
69   :                                                        69 Mark
Dude
This is bullshit
Just chi- Mark steps on the Driver's hand
(') Ahhhh
Fuck
The Driver takes his hand out from under Mark's foot
He stands up
(') Fuck you, man
'll fucking do this
Suddenly, Mark becomes enraged
He takes a big step forward and brutally  the Driver square in the nuts
The Driver clutches his nuts and falls to the ground
Francis, you and your idiot friends stay the away from me and mine or 'll flipping shiv your ass
Mark and his buddies head back in, leading them towards Seth and Evan, who quickly duck back into the party
- 70                                                                     70 The frightened boys walk into one of the first rooms and hide in the corner
They have a hushed discussion
Dude, let's slip out the back
Why
Come on, we're here
Let's just hurry up and do this
You want to end up like that guy
Not me, need my nuts
We need this liquor
You need it
don't need it
'm going to tell Helen  like her, and then maybe she'll get with me; not after  get her stinking drunk
() 54
70   :                                                        70 Then why haven't you ever made a move, you pussy
Because  respect her
'm not going to put that kind of unfair pressure on her
These aren't girls, they're women
They need our dicks as much as we need their poons - and we all love liquor, so where's the fucking beef
We're leaving, okay
These guys could kill us
You want to get killed for liquor
You're really gonna bail on me
(rolls eyes) Jesus
Evan walks out the door
Okay, okay
if that's how you're going to be, then 'll get the booze on my own
And you're not getting any
And neither is Helen
Seth storms off
- 71                                                                     71 Fogell sits in the backseat
The cops are in the front
There is silence for a few beats
Um
hey
uh, officers
could answer those, uh, questions now if you want
We get the gist of it
You were buying some beer, some guys came in and robbed the place
don't think we're gonna find `em this time
The officers start to chuckle
() 55
71   :                                                        71 It was only one guy
Only one guy
Well, fuck that
We could never catch one guy
You see, McLovin, if it was two guys, we'd have twice the chance of catching one of them
But just one guy
mean, how are we supposed to find one guy in this whole city
Yeah, McLovin
You know how many people there are in this city
have trouble finding people  know
Aren't you guys supposed to be trained or something
Don't you have a computer
Yeah, that stuff can help, but if someone walks up to me on the street, and is like, "Hey, find Bob
" Well, how the hell am  supposed to do that
Who's Bob
Exactly
If  don't know who he is, then how am  supposed to know where he is
When you're new to the force, like  am- Only six months in
(proudly) got two and a half years under my belt
You learn a lot of crazy stuff
For example- The car radio goes off

It's Bailey's Bar and Grill
Car 43, respond please
Slater picks up the receiver
Ten-four
(hangs up) Nice
Ya see, Michaels, when ever there's a call for a bar, you take it
Good fucking call, sir
They chuckle
Hey, McLovin
We got a situation at Bailey's
We have to see to that, but we'll drop you off right after
Okay
Um
okay
Michael's hits the siren and they drive off

An nudges Seth aside and sticks his arm in
Hey Mark, you want another beer
Seth quickly walks away from the fridge and goes down the hall
- 73                                                                  73 Seth enters a room of people dancing to hip-hop
He notices all the girls are drinking Mike's Hard Lemonade, and then locates a cooler full of it across the dance area
He tries to make his way through the sea of dancing
hot, sorority-type  drunk out off her ass dances over to him and starts grinding against his leg
He doesn't know how to react so he just goes with it, bumpin' and grindin' with the girl

Whaa
What the
oh
He takes out his vibrating cell phone and looks at the callers name
it's Helen
(') Oh dude
Oh dude
Oh dude
He looks intensely at the cell as it continues vibrating
(') Okay
Okay
Here we go
He presses talk
(
) (through the phone with horrible static) Eva
lo
Helen
Helen
The phone cuts out
Evan sees that he has no reception
He looks back at the party, then at his cell phone
He shakes his head and turns back towards the party

They stop before they enter
Alright McLovin, this will only take a few minutes
Just grab a beer at the bar and we'll be done before you know it
(a little scared) Well
what's goin' on in there
The Officers chuckle as they lead Fogell into the bar
'    - 76                                                                  76 As they enter the bar they immediately see a drunken, crazed screaming at a bar tender

You didn't see me pissin' anywhere
Fogell quickly sits at the bar by the entrance to the kitchen
Alright, Michaels
've got your back
Show this rummy how we roll
Officer Michaels walks up to the Homeless Guy
Excuse me
Sir
The Homeless Guy turns and sees the cops
He runs for the front door
Resisting
Michaels blocks the door and the Homeless Guy rams into him, knocking him to the ground
(sarcastic) Good one, Michaels
Slater runs at the Homeless Guy and chases him into the dining area
The Homeless Guy knocks over a table, which Slater trips over
(') Fuck

Ow
Please
Stop, you fucking bum
The Homeless Guy gets up, grabs Fogell and  him into a rack of trays
He then turns to run, but  on a wet spot and  his head against the ground

As the song ends, the Woman moves on
Seth glances at the cooler and sees one more Mike's hard
He grabs it and puts it in his pocket
The bulge is apparent

There are a bunch of chilling on the couch, who all look at Seth oddly as he enters
Hey, wut up
The guys just nod at Seth and continue to look at him strangely

Uh
no
What
don't know what you're talking about
1 That shit you spilled all over yourself, idiot
(sincere) didn't spill anything on myself
Seth checks himself to see what the guy is referring to
(') Oh shit
On Seth's upper thigh there is a red splotch about the size of a palm of a hand
(') What the hell is this
1 Oh my lord
You were just dancing in there, right
Yeah, so
The guys all burst out laughing

Why would  get blood on my leg from--- (beat of realization) The guys start laughing even harder

He points out the stain Seth's pants
All the guys burst out laughing
Embarrassed and fearful of the attention, Seth starts making his way out of the room
Yeah
It's really funny, huh
Yuk it up, assholes
Seth works his way through another room full of people, shielding the splotch as best as he can
Dude
Check it out
That guy's having his period
Another group of people turn and laugh
He looks about the right age

Slater's radio goes off
Calling all units, armed and dangerous man in the vicinity of- Click
Slater turns his radio down, ignoring the calls
So anyways, we leave the bar, 'm charmin' her pants off telling her stories of shoot-outs and shit
You've been in shoot-outs
Nope
McLovin, all we do is bonk homeless people on the head
You're practically a cop now
So  pull up in front of her house and she asks me to come inside for some coffee
Of course,  say yes
Oh shit

So we go into the kitchen start taking off my clothes, she fucking flips, starts screaming at me, and 'm like "Can't have coffee without cream
" Oh
Right
fucking said that
Then, she slaps me, throws me out
'm telling you McLovin, stay out of bars
Hey, you don't need to tell me
So, yeah, you gotta look in different places
The gym, an art class, you know, shit like that
met the Missus at paint ball
Can you believe that
shot her in the neck, and we just hit it off
And my first wife -- who is a whore -- where do you think we met

don't know
find they're always good for a little quick ass
The cops laugh

You do the whole mysterious guy thing, right
Yeah McLovin, how's it going with the ladies
Fogell thinks for a moment, he is feeling rather comfortable
Well, officers, it's not the going with the ladies  care about, it's the coming
The cops and Fogell burst out laughing
Oh
McLovin in the house
He sees that the cops clearly like him; his confidence level increased, he takes a chance

you guys got guns, huh
The officers glance at each other as sinister smiles creep across their faces
Yeah
We got guns
haven't had one for long, but, man, let me tell you - it's like having two dicks
Can
can  hold one
Your gun
Michaels and Slater look to each other
mean, if we took the bullets out
Yeah
Why not
Slater pulls out his gun and takes out the clip
(') Here
Fogell takes the unloaded gun and flops it back and forth in his hands, a huge smile gleaming
Wow
've never held one
Are they hard to shoot
If you're Michaels they are
He can't shoot worth dick
Fuck you, old man
could out-shoot you with my sack tucked between my legs
Only one way to settle this

He stops for a moment to take a breather as he looks around the basement
He spots a fridge in the corner and walks over to it
As he opens it, a look of awe sweeps across his face
Every shelf is completely filled with beer
Jesus's tits
He grabs as many bottles as he can and starts sticking them in his pockets, when he notices two large jugs of detergent next to the washer
He thinks for a moment, then begins to empty out the detergent jugs

huge smile crosses his face
As he turns around to exit, five older, unbelievably drunk wander into the room
1 They're going to kill that guy, man
That bitch's boyfriend is so pissed

And he's a beast
They start pouring a baggy of coke on the table when one of them notices Evan standing in the corner

Evan glances down at his crotch
He is confused and horrified

Oh no, that's not me either
Wrong guy, man
Sorry
Dude 3 gets up and blocks the door
3 No
No, that's you, man
You are fully Jimmy's brother
You were just so messed up you can't remember

Seth turns and sees Mark, the guy who assaulted the Driver, walking towards him
He notices Mark has a splotch on his leg, too
Hey
You got one, too
We're blood brothers
Shut it, you little shitter
What the hell were you doing dancing with Jacinda
Horrified, Seth scrambles for excuses
didn't dance with her

The Enormous Guy and Mark's friends are gathered beside Mark

Evan and the four dudes who were doing coke walk into the room
Evan is shocked to see Seth at the center of so much commotion
Mark notices the detergent bottle in Seth's hands
And what the fuck is this
It's nothing
It's detergent

Seth turns and faces Mark's girlfriend,
You motherfucker
She grabs a lamp, still plugged in, and swings it at Seth
She hits him square in the chest and the light bulb explodes
You ruined my birthday
You humiliated me
You're the one who used my leg as a tampon
She charges at him again, arms flailing

The Homeless Guy is sleeping in the back
Michaels has his gun drawn and is carefully aiming at a distant stop sign
You've been saying some bold words, my friend
Better not mess up
You can do it, officer
Michaels blasts off a round, which punches a hole right through the center of the "" in the stop sign

Fogell shoves the unconscious Homeless Guy over

Of course you did
We were supposed to do something and you left instead of doing it
That's the definition of bailing
If you said we should burn our dicks off and  didn't, that's not bailing
It is bailing, if you promised to burn your dick off
What
The bottom line is   you're a bailer
You just bailed on me,   you bailed on me this morning when Terry   spat on me, and you're bailing on me next   year
Oh
Okay
There it is
It finally comes out
We were supposed to go to college together
Since elementary school
What ever happened to that
What happened to that, is that you're too stupid to get into the schools  did
was not too stupid,  was too lazy
You've wasted all my time, you selfish bastard

How do they expect us to work these things while we're driving

Pretty much anything, if you're smart enough to figure it out

Was the guy alright
What
Oh, yeah, the guy was fine
Michaels looks back at the Homeless Guy, who looks a little bit more awake than before
(') Are you awake, sir
The guy starts to open his eyes a little
Michaels grabs the guy's face and slams it back, knocking him out again
Fogell jumps a little
'm sorry, McLovin
But  really need this to be a private thing
Officer Michaels takes out two cigarettes, and gives one to Fogell, who accepts, quivering in fear
Michaels lights his, then passes the lighter to Fogell

Officer Slater and myself, don't you
Fogell tries to light his cigarette
It takes a few tries and he starts hacking after the first pull
(coughing) Umm, yeah, sure
You guys are great
Yeah, well, we're also on probation
You see, we've actually trashed two other cars
The first time wasn't our fault, and the second time a bee flew in and freaked out
Point is, we trash another car, without a good reason, we're fucked
Know what 'm saying
Fogell continues to painfully suck back on the cigarette
Sure
Now, we're going to arrest these guys, and if you don't mind, which you shouldn't, we'd like you to write a fake witness report saying they jumped out in front of our car
Cool, McLovin
Fogell nods his head, getting some of his cigarette smoke in his eyes
He winces and starts to blink in discomfort

How tall are you
Uh
don't know, five-foot-ten, eleven
And you said those were "Pumas

Officer Michaels and Fogell get out of the car

Fogell turns and sees Seth and Evan - he's completely dumbfounded
Evan starts to look really nervous, like he might literally explode
He starts to stand up
The cops are still talking when suddenly, Evan
Shit
The cops run after Evan
Seth and Fogell look at each other
Seth grabs the remaining detergent jug and runs off in the opposite direction of Evan
Fogell reaches into the cop car, grabs the bags of booze, and follows Seth
Seth
Wait up
Officer Slater looks back to see Seth and Fogell running
Shit
Shit
McLovin bailed
The cops run back into their car

As they run, we see the   Homeless Guy slump out of the car, landing on his face with a   muffled groan
He stands up, grabs the jug of detergent that   was left on the ground, and runs off

Seth grabs Fogell and takes him around a house and towards a backyard second later, the cops run by the house and continue up the block

Fogell helps Seth get up
They try to run, but Seth is caught on the tent
He drags it a couple feet as the kids start clawing to get out
(') The zipper opens and a  hops out
The Kid looks at Seth
Holy shit
Little kids
little  runs out and books it into the house
From inside the tent, another kid starts kicking at Seth
Ow
Seth manages to free himself from the tent and he and Fogell fall to the ground
The kids continue to scream
(
) Get away from my children
The guys turn and see a crazed, slightly overweight  in his underwear running at them with a baseball bat
Fogell and Seth scramble to their feet as the Dad takes a swing at them, narrowly missing them
(') You sick sons-of-bitches
Fogell throws his shoulder into the guy, knocking him down
Seth and Fogell run to the backyard gate and try to open it
They can't
Help
Fogell starts banging as Seth looks back to see the Dad coming for them
Seth swings the detergent jug at the Father, knocking him on his ass
He quickly gets up and charges, enraged

Seth coughs and wheezes, slowing down as he lugs the detergent
The Father enters the alley and sees the boys running
He throws his baseball bat
It sails through the air and nails Seth in the back
He falls
He gets up and the keeps running

He keeps looking out for the cops, when suddenly he hears a gunshot - (to himself, mumbling) Oh god
Oh god
Fuck
Fuck
As he fumbles to turn his jacket inside out and get it on, he sees Seth and Fogell running towards him
He pops out of the bush, scaring Fogell and Seth

They turn onto a main street and are exuberant at the sight of an oncoming bus
It stops at a nearby stop
They haul ass and make it on

(
) Hey
It's you
Fogell looks up and sees the Homeless Guy stumbling towards them, sucking back the bottom of the lost detergent bottle
The Homeless Guy sees they have bags full of booze
(') You got booze in the bag
Can you gimme some
No
Fuck off
You already drank our detergent beer
That was beer
(to Fogell) Well, you little shit
ain't got no cop people to help you keep your booze

Who cares
Just because he doesn't have a home doesn't mean he can be a lunatic
Give me the booze
The guy shoves Seth aside and dives at Fogell
: - Helen's bottle of Goldschlager gets knocked from the bag
It   falls towards the ground
- Seth reaches for it, but doesn't quite grab it
-    the bottle as it slams against the bus floor
but doesn't break
It slowly rises back up into the air and begins sailing towards the front of the bus
- Evan  through the air, sailing towards the precious Goldschlager with his arms extended
(in slo-mo voice) - He is inches away from grabbing it, when it suddenly smashes into a pole, , sending little gold flakes everywhere
The Homeless Guy sees the gold flakes
Shit
Gold
He starts frantically picking up the flakes as Evan stares at the remains, shocked
Fogell walks over
What the hell is going on
Where did you come from

The boys look at each other terrified, and get off the bus

There is no one else out there
The moment the door closes behind them, Seth turns to Jules and puts his hands on her hips
He stares into her eyes and moves in for the kiss
Jules instantly pulls back
Whoa
Whoa
Slow down
What
What's wrong
'd
uh
prefer if we did this at some other time
(confused) But
there is no other time
School's up
This is the only time
what's wrong with now
Well, you're drunk
Like, really, really drunk
So
So are you
'm not drunk at all
don't even drink
Seth is absolutely shocked
It takes his remarkably drunk mind a moment to process this information
You don't drink
But
but, you told me to get the liquor
Yeah, 'm

throwin' a party, remember
You don't drink
No

uh, you know
Uh, no
Not right now, thank you very much
Seth looks at Jules and realizes that he's screwed up
His eyes start to water
Ahhh
man
fuck
Seth starts to cry
Are you crying
No
Yeah, so what if  am
'm a fucking idiot and it was my last chance
So should be crying
Last chance to do what
To make you my girlfriend for the summer, okay
There
You're, like, the coolest person that's ever talked to me, and thought we'd both be drunk, but
What would me be drunk have anything to do with it
`Cause you'd never get with me in your right mind
Look at me
(beat) And now look at you
Suddenly, the front door opens, and a   walks out

The Random Girl notices Seth and Jules

Evan's eyes widen
She looks at Evan and rubs her breasts in a very un-sexy way

Here we go
Helen crawls onto the bed, pushes Evan down, and starts seriously making out with him, drunker and sloppier than ever
(') Evan, 'm so wet
(still nervous) You're so beautiful
Helen shoves her hand down Evan's boxers
Evan jolts, terrified
You've got such a smooth cock
Um
thank you
've thought you were a really incredible person for a really long time
Evan looks really nervous as Helen's hand starts moving up and down
You've got to get hard for me

Yeah, Evan

Evan sits up
What's wrong

You don't want to do this
Yeah  do,  want to fuck you
Look, you know  really like you, Helen, but this is
it's just too intense
And 'm so drunk  don't even know how to, like, process- You're just being a pussy

They are kissing
Nicola sits up and takes Fogell's hand and starts sucking his fingers

He pulls out a little bottle of lube

Seth has his face in his hands
Jules is patting him on the back, but clearly feels awkward
Seth, you

Seth looks up at her, drunk as hell, his eyes half-open
(') You didn't blow it, you're a- Seth blanks out and falls forward
He head-butts Jules in the face

He wiggles around a bit
(') sorry
Seth passes out again
few moments go by, when  a cop car pulls up in front of the house
Seth opens his eyes and sees the cops
(') Oh no
Two cops get out and start harassing two kids smoking a joint on the front lawn
One of them turns on their flashlight and Seth sees - it's   and

He's absolutely smashed
Life's bullshit, huh, Miroki
Suddenly, Seth bursts into the room and grabs Evan's shirt
(') Fuckin' wax off, asshole
No
'm helping you, man
Just listen
Seth grabs Evan's wrists and tries to pull him to his feet
Fuck off, jerk
You're hurting my shoulders
Just then, Terry (the guy who spat on Seth in the beginning) walks by
Hey
Look, it's Christina and Britney
Have fun boning each other on grad night
Terry and his buddies laugh their asses off when, suddenly- () 102

Someone opens the door, revealing Officer Slater and Officer Michaels
They talk to whoever answered the door, oblivious of Evan and Seth
We had a complaint about the noise
It looks like you're having a nice little party here
nice little underage drinking party
Evan points at the cops
Dude
Seth
It's the cops
The cops
That's what 've been
Here
Seth pulls Evan up and the two drunkenly make their way out of the living room just as the cops step into it
Okay, everyone out
Party's over
Get out of here
Michaels turns to Slater

told you this would release some anger
'll tell you what would release some anger, if one of these little fuckers touched me and  got to club his face in

Fogell wears the greatest look of accomplishment one could possibly imagine

Nicola screams, grabs her clothes, and runs into the bathroom
McLovin

Officer Slater
You ran away from us

Get up here

Seriously
Shut the fuck up
Wait a minute
How old was that girl

You sick bastard, that's statutory rape, McLovin
Officer Slater appears in the doorway
McLovin
He was violating a sixteen year-old girl

You're going to jail, fucko

Slater walks over and bashes the kid in the face with his nightstick
The kid drops
There you go
That does feel better
They throw Fogell into the back of the cop car

It stops
Fogell and Officer Michaels get out, both smiling
The driver side window rolls down, reveal Slater
Alright, boys
What 'm about to show you is pretty much the greatest move in donut- spinning history
Behold: the reverse figure-eight
Slater drives to the other side of the lot
So, like, what's your official position
If you were in, you were in
You are no longer a virgin, end of story
Screw cumming
Suddenly, Slater guns it and speeds across the lot, slamming the breaks, spinning wildly in several erratic donuts backward donuts
Slater completely loses control of the car
He smashes through a bunch of shopping carts and slams into a light post, completely fucking up the cruiser
Slater tries to open his door, but it won't budge
He crawls out the missing windshield, slumping onto the ground
Alright
think that's all the fun we're gettin' out of this one

Of course
That mugger had nothing but murder in his eyes
owe you my life
Fogell signs the pad
Can we do this already
The cops and Fogell push the cruiser towards a small, but steep, hill
They shove it over the edge and watch it roll
It gains speed and smashes into a tree, shattering the windows and crushing the front of the car
(') Can we shoot at it
don't know, can you
They whip out their guns
(') 'm throwin' down the gauntlet
50 bucks
Whoever hits the gas tank
You are so fucking on

Seth walks out of the dressing room wearing jeans that are way too small
Don't ask me
don't give a shit if your pants look good
Well,  need someone's opinion
Fine
They're way too small
Yeah, but when  was wearing your dad's pants last night  realized that if  buy pants that are too small it'll encourage me to lose weight
And in tight pants chicks'll kind of see my dick a little
Yeah, the male camel toe look is really big this year
Seth goes back into the dressing room and wriggles out of the pants
He walks out
These pants suck

Seth and Evan wave back
The girls get up and start to walk over

can't talk to her, look what  did to her

Not bad, but not great, how about you

They didn't blow it
So, uh, 'll call you later
Yeah man, have a good one
Come on, Seth
Let's go
Jules pulls Seth away
Evan and Helen start walking in the opposite direction
As they walk away from one another, Seth and Evan look back and give each other a small and yet emotionally-charged wave

They look as though they're never going to see each other again
