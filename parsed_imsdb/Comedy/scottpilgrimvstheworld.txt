He turns to  , dark hair, arched eyebrow, disloyal

" Before you hear some dirty lies from someone else, yes, 'm dating a 17 year old
Wallace looks up from the  magazine he's reading
Is he cute
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Does this mean we have to stop sleeping together
Do you see another bed in here

Who told you
Wallace

Scott turns to see Wallace on a second cordless
Wallace
Wallace clicks off
Scott sinks into an armchair
Who is this mysterious child you date
Her name is Knives
Knives Chau

You're ridiculous
It's a Catholic school too
With the uniform and everything

9 : (3) 9 Yeah, the whole deal

We haven't even held hands

Um, Scott
Why are you doing this
don't know
it's just nice, you know
It's just
simple
It's been over a year since you got dumped by she-who-will-not-be-named
Scott glances down at the partially obscured  magazine, looking into the  '  on the back cover album ad
(') So, are you legitimately moving on, or is this just you being insane
Scott looks at a strip of photobooth pictures: he smiles next to a hot redhead in happier times
Can  get back to you on that
clangs loudly

-  10 Wallace and Scott stand outside a
Uniformed boys and girls pour out
do not want to be here
At all
This school has boys too

Her shy friend  lingers behind
Hey Knives, this is my cool gay roommate, Wallace Wells
He's gay
Oh, hi
Do you want to know who in my class is gay
Yes
Does he wear glasses
Wallace, you go now
Begone
Wallace pulls Knives close
Whispers
You're too good for him
Run

-  11 Scott and Knives play    (think a martial arts version of   )
They punch and kick in unison, side by side
Did you know the original name of Pac- man was Puck-man
You would think it's because Pac-Man looks like a yellow hockey puck, but actually it comes from the Japanese phrase paku-paku which means to flap ones mouth open and closed
They changed it over here because Puck-Man is too easy to vandalize
You know, scratch out the and turn it into an  or whatever
Knives flips over Scott's back in a  move

Hangers click in time
don't listen to much music know a lot of kids who play piano or whatever, but you guys

Thank you, Knives
13
( ) -  13 Scott and Knives flip through records in perfect sync
mean, you guys are gonna be
Well, we're already pretty big
But it might be cool if cool people wore our -shirt
Knives speaks to a female clerk, surly with tats and specs: ", 22, ' , :
" Excuse me, do you have anything by 'The Clash At Demonhead'
Have you tried the section marked 'The Clash At Demonhead'
Thank you, Julie
Are you coming to my party Friday or will you be busy babysitting

13 : 13 Thank you, Julie
( ) You don't want to listen to her

13 : (2) 13 (') And you definitely don't want to listen to them
Scott puts The Clash at Demonhead  back in the rack
Oh,  heart them so much

But that's just me
() Envy Adams is sooo cool
Do you read her blog
Sorry, you were saying about me

Yeah, so whatever, man
've never even kissed a guy
Knives blushes and looks at the ground
Scott hugs her
Me neither

So this is your secret lair
Can come in

But do you want to see the house where  grew up
Sure
They literally walk across the street to a small house
Here you go
Wow
Yeah
Wow
Wind blows
The light snowfall turns into sand
16
-   16 Scott wanders alone through a barren land
He falls to his knees next to a lonely cactus
Oh God
so
so alone
rollerblades across the shifting sands
She wears fishnets, an army jacket, skirt and goggles
Her pink hair is funky but cool
She is hotter than the desert sun
You're not alone
You're just having some idiotic dream
Does that mean we can make out
But she's gone

Oh God
Wallace wakes up to the left of Scott, rubbing his eyes

Oh God
What is it, Scott
scruffy, goateed guy wakes right between Scott and Wallace: " , 22, '
:  " Can we skip the dreamtime
Color me not interested
But there was this girl
Girl
Was this an Envy related dream
We don't use the -word in this house
No, it wasn't her
It was somebody new
Yay for that
Other Scott goes back to sleep
Wallace rubs his eyes
Speaking of new, weren't you supposed to take your fake high school girlfriend to the library a half-hour ago

Sunlight ignites the room
(') Arrrrgh

-  18 What's wrong
() 14
18 : 18 Scott is noticeably taller than all the teens in the library
He carries a stack of books for Knives
Libraries remind me of grade school
That must seem like a reeeeally long time ago
Uh
Let's talk about something else
The hiss of ball bearings catches Scott's attention
He freezes as he sees skating towards the desk in
Do you know that girl
The Rollerblading Girl delivers a package from
to the librarian
Scott's gaze follows the  as she blades out of the library
Pensive guitar underscores his thoughts
Scott
Scott continues to stare at the girl
Time slows to a crawl

Scott, Kim Pine, Stephen Stills and Young Neil walk down an icy Toronto street
Scott's head is still in the clouds
We're going to this party, retard
Party
At Julie's
Ugh

We did
But, you know, there may be some label guys there, so
Aw, man

Enigmatic
Hot
Scott sidles up and stands next to her
Hey, what's up
Nothing
Hey, you know Pacman
know of him
Scott begins to babble
() 17
22 : 22 Well you know Pac-Man was originally Puckman but not because Pac-Man looks like a hockey puck and paku-paku-paku means flapping your mouth and they changed it because if you scratch out the "" and turn it into an "'
You know
Like
Yeah that's amazing
Um
am  dreaming
Ramona looks at Scott blankly
He slowly skulks away

He ducks around corners, spies from behind a much bigger dude
Ramona leaves the party
Scott grabs a startled Young Neil

All  know is she's American
() American

Dating a high schooler is the mourning period
She's got a point

That's garbage
Completely untrue
That time with Lisa- Misunderstanding

We hear the sound of arctic winds
Whatever, Ramona is out of your league, let's leave it at that

She keeps mentioning some guy named Gideon

Well, you should break up with your fake high school girlfriend
Wait

Duh
Wallace
He's not even conscious
Whatever
You of all people should know how sucky it is to get cheated on
Don't you have a job to do
You're right

Hi, um,  was thinking about asking you out, but then  realized how stupid that would be
() Do you want to go out sometime
Um, no, that's okay
You just have to sign for this alright
just woke up, and you were in my dream
dreamt you were delivering me this package
Is that weird
It's not weird at all
It's not
No, it's just like, you've got this really convenient subspace highway running through your head that like to use
It's like three miles in fifteen seconds
Right
() 27
31 : 31 Oh yeah
forgot you guys don't have that in Canada
You don't remember me do you
met you at the party the other day
Were you the Pac-Man guy
No

You're Ramona Flowers right
That's me
So, you're like American
Why, am  coming off as rude
Not at all
Noooooo
Scott stands in awe of Ramona
She gives him a pen
You know
you need to sign for this
Whatever this is
It's something really cool
You'd be impressed
You still have to sign
But if  sign for it, you'll leave
Yeah
That's how it works
Okay well, can we just maybe just hang out sometime
Get to know each other
You're the new kid on the block, right
've lived here forever
mean
there are reasons for you to hang out with me
You're all over the place

my dream girl
need to find a new route
Either that or you need to start hanging out with me
You want me to hang out with you

If  say yes, will you sign for your damn package
Scott finally signs on the dotted line
And throws the package straight in the trash
Done
So, yeah
Eight o'clock
32  [   34] 32 33  33 34
-  34 Scott finds Ramona waiting at the top of some stairs in the park
The Toronto skyline gleams in the night behind them
Why are you just standing there
Dude, 'm totally waiting on you
Sorry,  just assumed you were too cool to be on time
Well
You assumed wrong
So what do you want to do
We could get a slice at Pizza Pizza or flip through some records at Sonic Boom
Oh, or there's this awesome game called Ninja Ninja Revolution at- () 29
34 : 34 'm not into simulated violence
'm cool with whatever you want to do
This is good
Scott and Ramona trudge through the snow in the empty park
This is good
So how'd you end up in Toronto
Just needed to escape  guess
Oh yeah
got this job here
And Gideon had always said Toronto was one of the great cities so
Is Gideon
is he your boyfriend
He's
a friend
Was he your boyfriend
Do you mind if we don't get into that right now
It's so not interesting to me
They sit on some swings in the park
So what about you
What do you do
'm between jobs
Between what and what
My last job is a long story filled with sighs
() 30
34 : (2) 34 know plenty of those
Is that why you left New York
Pretty much
It was time to head somewhere a little more chilled
Well, it's certainly chilled here
Yeah
Uh
Chilled as in cold
Yeah
'm totally obsessed with you
didn't mean to get you obsessed
just haven't been obsessed with a girl for a long time
It's weird
That's probably because you sleep with a guy
Um
was guessing from your apartment, but you totally do
() 31
34 : (3) 34 It's
we're just poor
We can't afford two beds
We're not gay
Actually
no
Wallace is pretty gay
Dude, relax
believe you
You're too desperate to be gay
feel so stupid
Aw
you're probably not that stupid
Laughing, Ramona hops off her swing
(') 'm
mostly stupid
Well, you're definitely stupid if you want to go out with me
Exactly, yeah
The snowfall gets heavier
This is ridiculous
Isn't it like April
Yeah
can barely see you
This whole thing is an unmitigated disaster
think 'act of God' is a pretty decent excuse for a lousy date
So this is a 'date', eh
Did  say 'date'
Slip of the tongue
Tongue
The snow gets heavier still
Ramona walks away
Anyway, night's not over yet
think there's a thingy up here somewhere

can't see you
'm blind
Help me

Ramona opens the door
Scott and Ramona fall into blackness
35
'  -  35 Scott shivers at the kitchen table of Ramona's cozy, girl friendly apartment
He watches as she slips out of her coat
What kind of tea do you want
There's more than one kind
We have blueberry, raspberry, ginseng, sleepytime, green tea, green tea with lemon, green tea with lemon and honey, liver disaster, ginger with honey, ginger without honey, vanilla almond, white truffle, blueberry chamomile, vanilla walnut, constant comment and earl grey
Did you make some of those up
think 'll have sleepytime
That sounds good to me
Let me get you a blanket
That would actually be awesome
Ramona exits
After a moment alone, Scott ventures upstairs
He wanders towards a half open door
Pushing it open, he finds Ramona in her bedroom in her bra and skirt
Dude
'm changing
Scott covers his eyes and our screen goes
(
) Sorry, 'm just
cold
(
) Here, does this help
(
) That's
very warm
What is that
() 33
35 : 35 Scott opens his eyes to see Ramona hugging him
(') Ohh
kay
They look into each others eyes
camera circles Scott and Ramona as they begin an awesome make out session
Scott imagines himself soundtracking the kiss with a slinky bassline
Ramona breaks off, smiling
Scott is in heaven
(') Were you
were you just going to bring the blanket from your bed
guess
Maybe
maybe we should both get under it
since we're so cold
Well
what about our tea
can
not have tea
The slinky bassline continues as Ramona takes her skirt off, revealing black panties to complement black bra
Scott takes his shirt off
They tumble onto the bed and make out
Then- changed my mind
Changed it to what
From what
don't want to have sex with you, Pilgrim
Not right now
Ohh
kay
It's not like 'm gonna send you home in a snowstorm or anything
You can sleep in my bed
And reserve the right to change my mind about the sex later
Ramona curls up next to Scott
() 34
35 : (2) 35 This is cool, just this
It's been like a really long time, and this is
think  needed this
Whatever this is
So, thanks
You're welcome
They exchange a smile
Then without warning we jump cut to - 36
'  -  36 Scott awakens
Ramona is gone
An arrow points to the empty spot in the bed next to him
' ' Another arrow point out that- ''   ' Ramona steps out of the bathroom in a towel
Scott relaxes

Work
You have to leave
37
'  -  37 Ramona skates towards the front gate, Scott walking next to her
covers the roads and sidewalks
Hey, can this not be a one night stand
For one thing,  didn't even get any
that was a joke
What did you have in mind
Umm
oh, come to the first round of this battle of the bands thing
( ) You have a band
Yeah, we're terrible
Please come
() 34A
37 : 37 Sure
() 35
37 : (2) 37 Ramona shrugs and  through the snow
(somehow) Wait
Can  get your number
Ramona skids to a stop, right back next to Scott
She hands him a note
'  , 212 664-7665, xxxxxxx' Wow, girl number
Scott looks back up
Ramona is already skating far, far away
See you at the show, Scott Pilgrim
Oh, hey
It's tonight
At The- 38
-  38 ' ,  :     '
Ramona wades through a grungy venue under the stare of young hipsters, reaching Scott at the bar
He stands with Wallace and Stacey
She holds hands with a guy wearing glasses
You totally came
Yes
did totally come
Scott is so amazed at her presence, his social skills vanish
Excuse my brother
He's chronically enfeebled
'm Stacey
Hey
And this is Wallace, his room-mate
Hey
And this is my boyfriend Jimmy
(staring at Jimmy) Heyyy
() 36
38 : 38 And this is Knives, Scott's- Scott goes white
He didn't even see Knives come in
Hey
Knives pecks Scott on the cheek
He pushes her away
Knives looks kinda sexy, wearing makeup and new clothes
Do you like

Stacey stares at Scott
Knives and Ramona stare at each other
Wallace stares at Jimmy
(') Have
To

Scott scurries off
We hear feedback from a mic onstage
(
) This next band are from Brampton and they are Crash And The Boys
39
,  -  39 Scott runs backstage to see Stills obsessively flipping through a chart with hand drawn stats of their rival band
This is a nightmare
Is this a nightmare
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Once we're on stage you'll be fine
We were just on stage
For sound check
The sound guy hated us
It's just nerves
Pre-show jitters
People love us
Right
Scott sounds less than convincing
He looks up at Ramona and Knives sitting with Wallace, Jimmy and Stacey in the
37

,  -  40 Crash and The Boys tune up
drunk Wallace turns to Jimmy
Jimmy
Do they rock or suck

Crash and the Boys play a whole song in
04 seconds

Wallace yells from the balcony
'   ,
This song is for the guy who keeps yelling from the balcony, and it's called "We Hate You, Please Die
" Sweet

Are these guys good
Kim Pine scowls harder than ever
These guys are good

Sound explodes from the stage
The audience are stunned
43

How are we supposed to follow this
We're not going to win, we're not gonna sign with -Man and we'll never play opening night at the Chaos Theatre
( ) , , ' 44
,  -  44 As Crash And The Boys climax, Stacey turns to Ramona
So, how do you know Scott
He's
um
He's a friend
Hard for me to keep track sometimes
He has so many friends
Ramona arches an eyebrow
Stacey turns to Knives and Tamara
So Knives, how did you meet Scott
39
45
,  -  45 Scott looks up into the balcony, sees Stacey talking to Knives
He turns around and slaps Stephen Stills in the face
We gotta play now and loud
46
,  -  46 Stacey and Ramona listen intently to Knives' story
Well,  was on the bus with my Mom- Knives freezes, staring at the stage
Is that seriously the end of the story

This next band is from Toronto and

Scott nods vigorously
Kim

She faints in the excitement

Sex Bob-omb rock out, barely into the first verse when a chunk of ceiling  down and a through the hole, finger pointed at Scott as he sails towards the stage
() 40
47 : 47 lands onstage and glares at Scott through a lopsided fringe
He wears an evil grin and a jacket that borders on flamboyant
He drags on a cigarette (blacked out)
Mr
Pilgrim
It is , Matthew Patel
Consider our fight
begun
What did  do
Matthew Patel leaps in the air and sails toward Scott
What do  do
Scott throws his bass to Young Neil and  Patel with his left arm, then  him across the floor with his right
Patel  like a cat,  his fringe and  at Scott
Alright
Alright
Watch out
It's that one guy
Thank you, Wallace
Patel  at Scott
Scott   Patel in the chin and sends him flying into the air
They land in  , knocking hipsters down and squaring off in the resulting circle
You're quite the opponent, Pilgrim
Who the hell are you anyway
The   spotlights the fighters
My name is Matthew Patel and 'm Ramona's first evil ex-boyfriend
You're what
Ramona's first evil ex-boyfriend
All eyes  up to Ramona

Patel attacks Scott with spin kicks
Scott blocks
Patel punches
Scott blocks, then holds his hand up for a time-out
() 41
47 : (3) 47 We're fighting because of Ramona
Didn't you get my e-mail explaining the situation
skimmed it
You will pay for your insolence
Patel attacks, landing kicks and punches
Scott evades and counter-attacks
Patel evades, then lands more punches
Scott jump-spins away from danger
They pause, breathing heavy
What's up with his outfit
Yeah
Is he a pirate
Scott looks at Patel's outfit
Are you a pirate
Pirates are in this year
Patel attacks again
They exchange furious blows, until Patel puts Scott in a choke hold
Scott looks up to Ramona
You really went out with this guy
Yeah, in the seventh grade
The Lighting Guy  the spotlight to Ramona in the balcony
We see a sketchy childlike
(') It was football season and for some reason, all the little jocks wanted me
Matthew was the only non-white, non-jock boy in school, probably in the entire state, so we joined forces and took 'em all out
We were one hell of a team
Nothing could beat Matthew's mystical powers
Nothing but pre-teen capriciousness
We only kissed once
After a week and a half, told him to hit the showers
() 41A
47 : (4) 47 The spotlight swings back onto Scott and Patel

47 : (5) 47 Dude, wait

Patel levitates into the air and points at Ramona
You'll pay for this, Flowers
Patel  his fingers and launches into a
(') If you want to fight me, you're not the brightest
You won't know what's hit you in the slightest
Patel levitates into the air
Four hot girls in skirts with fangs and bat-wings appear in the air around him
(') Me and my fireballs and my Demon Hipster Chicks, 'm talking the talk because  know 'm slick
Patel and the Demon Hipster Chicks shoot  at Scott
He flips back onto the stage, narrowly dodging the attack
(') Fireball Girls
Take this sucker down
The Demon Hipster Chicks unleash more fireballs
Scott dodges
The house drum kit is trashed behind him
(') Let us show him what we're all about
Scott hits the ground, dodging a third wave of fireballs
They explode Crash and the Boys in the wings
That doesn't even rhyme
Scott rolls across the stage,  one of Kim's  and throws it Captain America style
It hits Patel square in the eyes
, the Demon Hipster Chicks vanish
This is impossible, how can it be
Scott leaps into the air
Patel opens his eyes just in time to see Scott Pilgrim's  racing towards his face
Open your eyes
Maybe you'll see

Not again
Ramona passes Knives, who is being resuscitated by Tamara

Aw man
$2

That's not even enough for the bus home
'll lend you the 30 cents
Ramona yanks Scott away
The Promotor ambles back onstage
Yeah
so like, Sex Bob-Omb wins

,  -  50 Knives is now wide awake, clapping wildly from the balcony
Her eyes scan the venue for Scott
but he is long gone
51
-  51 Sooooooo
bemused Scott and mortified Ramona sit on the bus home
What was all that all about
Uh,  guess
Ramona takes a breath
Looks deep into Scott's eyes
(') If we're going to date, you may have to defeat my seven evil ex's
You have seven evil ex-boyfriends

51 : 51 Seven ex's, yes
So  have to fight- Defeat
-defeat your seven evil ex's if we're going to continue to date
Pretty much
So, what you're saying is

Scott bursts through the front door, a spring in his step
The studio audience applauds
Someone's happy
Well, someone got to second base last night
And someone has a second date tonight
Someone's lucky then
You know when  say ' someone',  mean me, right
got to second base last night
maybe first and a half
Wallace shoots a look at the idiotically upbeat Scott
() 45
53 : 53 (') Oh, hey, 'm inviting Ramona over for dinner, so you can't be here tonight
don't want you gaying up the place
Okay, Scott
But in return  have to issue an ultimatum
One of your famous ultimatums
It may live in infamy
You have to break up with Knives
Today
Okay
Scott huffs and helps himself to some of Wallace's bacon
But
but
it's
If you don't do it, 'm going to tell Ramona about Knives
swear to God, Scott
But you
you're
At this point a sleepy  wanders out of the bathroom and helps himself to coffee
Morning
Scott points bacon at Wallace accusingly
(') didn't make up the gay rulebook
If you have a problem with it, take it up with Liberace's Ghost
You're a monster
Now put the bacon down and go do your dirt while  watch the Lucas Lee marathon on  Superstation
Who's Lucas Lee
Wallace points to a hunky actor on the cover of  magazine
() 45A
53 : (2) 53 He was this pretty good skater and now he's this pretty good actor
() () 46
53 : (3) 53 (') He's filming a Winifred Hailey movie in Toronto right now
They make movies in Toronto
Yes
am stalking him later
So, this Lucas Lee- Lucas Lee is not important to you right now
Get out
You suck
Surprising no one
Scott grumbles off
Wallace turns the television way up
We see Lucas Lee on a payphone in some crummy thriller
( ) Listen close and listen hard, bucko
The next click is me hanging up
The one after that
is me pulling the trigger
54
-  54 shivering and annoyed Scott dials the payphone
Oh, hey, Knives
Um, do you want to, like, talk or whatever
(
) Are you wearing a tan jacket
Like a spring jacket
And a hoodie
Ummm
Scott checks what he's wearing
underscores
(
) And a dorky hat
It's not dorky
Why are you psychic
beaming Knives knocks on the payphone glass
(') Oh
Uh
okay
Hi

Scott is on edge as Knives geeks over a standee for : it features sultry blonde singer posing and the rest of the band shrouded in shadow and mist
can't believe they're coming to town
Will you take me to the show
Yeah, listen- The   gets louder, pounding inside Scott's head
Oh, hey,  wanted to invite you over for dinner
Like, Chinese food
Yeah
Hmm
It's not my favorite
Yeah
Well, to meet my parents
It's my birthday dinner
Uh
think that's a really bad idea
Like, really, just so bad
No, it's okay
Why
Well  mean, 'm too old for you
No you're not
My Dad is nine years older than my Mom
And
and
are you even allowed to date outside your race or whatever
don't care
'm in
() 47A
55 : 55 Knives is so smitten, the word actually appears onscreen
Scott brushes it away
The   comes to a stop
Um, listen
was thinking we should break up or whatever
() 48
55 : (2) 55 Really
Yeah
um
it's not going to work out
Oh
Scott walks out, leaving Knives in the aisle
56
/   -  56 Scott sits on the bus alone, thinking about Knives
with Knives still in the record store, in shock
: Scott sighs, thinks of something happier
with Ramona: rollerblading, her funky pink hair
: Scott smiles, a little happier

'  -  57 Sex Bob-Omb tune up
Kim spins a drumstick in her fingers
Where's Knives
Not coming tonight
Oh
No
We broke up
Young Neil  his
Kim and Stills share a look

Scott plays the insanely simple video game tune
Scott, you are the salt of the earth
Aw, thanks
Wait

Aw, thanks
You

57 : 57 Yeah, but don't worry, maybe you'll meet my new new girlfriend soon
Newnew
Kim mimes shooting herself
Stills unplugs Scott's amp
Okay
From here on out, no or  talk at practice, whether they're old, new or new-new
We were lucky to survive that last round
This is sudden death now
Okay
Okay
(') That's for me
Scott opens the door to see Ramona, now sporting
(') Hey
you're here
Yes
Like you said
Is it not cool
Scott ushers her in, weirded out by this hair development
You know your hair
know of it
It's all blue
Yeah
just dyed it
Are you going to introduce me
Oh yeah, this is Stephen Stills, Young Neil, that's
Kim
Hey everyone
Everyone mumbles back
Scott still stares at Ramona's hair
() 49A
57 : (2) 57 Is it weird not being pink anymore

57 : (3) 57 change my hair every week and a half, dude
Get used to it

how do you guys all know each other
High school,  guess
What Neil said

Believe it or not,  actually dated Scott in high school
Got any embarassing stories
Yeah
He's an idiot
Scott fake laughs
Starts ushering Ramona out again
Okay
Cool
See you guys tomorrow
Uh, what about rehearsal
Neil knows my parts
( ) 'm Neil

'  -  58 Ramona lounges, reading a magazine
tense Scott hurries around the kitchen area, preparing food as Wallace looks on
Are you doing okay there
Yeah, good
Good
Ramona goes to the bathroom
Scott drops the act
She changed her hair
() 50A
58 : 58 So
It looks nice blue
() 51
58 : (2) 58 know, but she changed it without even making a big deal about it
She's spontaneous
Impulsive
Fickle
Oh my god, what do  do
can't believe you were worried about me gaying up the place
Ramona returns
Wallace pulls on a jacket
How's dinner coming along
Yeah, good
Good
'll leave you lovebirds to it
'm heading up to Casa Loma to stalk my hetero crush
Scott stops Wallace at the door, with a panicked whisper
Don't go
Will you man the hell up
You could get to 2nd and a half base
You think so
Well, if you strike out in the next hour, come find me at the Castle
'If  strike out'
Okay, 'when'
See you in sixty
'15  ' Ramona and Scott eat on the floor, picnic style
Scott has cooked garlic bread (and only garlic bread) for dinner
This is actually really good garlic bread
() 52
58 : (3) 58 Garlic bread is my favorite food could honestly eat it for every meal
Or just all the time without even stopping
You'd get fat
No
Why would  get fat
Bread makes you fat
Bread makes you
'15  ' nervy Scott serenades Ramona on his bass guitar
So  wrote a song about you
Oh yeah
Yeah, it goes like this: Ra-mona, Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ra-mona, Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ooooh
can't wait to hear it when it's finished
Finished
'15  ' Scott makes out with Ramona on the futon
Scott smiles as she runs her hands through his hair
Your hair's pretty shaggy
'
Scott sits up like a shot
Ramona is taken aback
What
() 53
58 : (4) 58 Ha
No, sorry
It's just that got
got a bad haircut right before me and my big ex broke up
But it's so long ago,  can barely remember it
deep voiced  chimes in
Earl Jones deep
Scott is acutely aware that his last salon haircut took place exactly 431 days ago, three hours before his big breakup
He blames this largely on the haircut and has been cutting his own hair ever since
Sounds like a bad time
Not really
It was
It was a mutual thing
It wasn't
mean, she told me it was mutual
She dumped him
It was brutal
What was her name
She was Nat when  knew her
But she stopped liking that name
Then
she stopped liking me
Your hair is cute
like it long
But it'd be cuter short
Wouldn't it
Scott disappears and just as quickly reappears, now wearing his dorky  , hair tucked tightly beneath the flaps
What
Why are you wearing that
() 54
58 : (5) 58 thought we could go for a walk
59
-  59 '15  ' Scott and Ramona climb a , long handrail between them
Tell me we didn't come out here just so you could cover your hair with that hat
Nooo
just love me some walking
Putting one leg in front of the other
You seem a little
heightened
Yeah
don't know
just, when 'm with you  feel like 'm on drugs
Not that  do drugs, unless you do, in which case  do drugs all the time, every drug, but
you make me feel don't know
Things seem a little brighter around you or something
Ramona and Scott finally reach the top of the stairs and , as if crossing a magical line
What is this place
totally awesome castle
They're shooting this movie up here
Ramona looks up at the looming  , a castle surrounded by big, bright movie set lights
Who's in it
Winifred Hailey and some actor guy
Oh, who

Hey
The only thing keeping me and her apart is the two minutes it's gonna take to kick your ass
you dated a  guy
In 9th grade
We had drama
Actually, it might have been math
just remember there being lots of drama
Lucas Lee points at Scott, who remains oblivious
He just followed me around
He was a little snot nosed brat
He had snot
In his nose
But he's famous
It's not a big deal
only dated him for a week and a half- 'm talking to you Scott Pilgrim
Lucas Lee stomps towards Scott, who gasps
He's famous and he talked to me

He nods to Ramona
Sup
How's life

Scott staggers to his feet, punchy
Hey

) Looks like you're seeing double
Scott turns to see the real Lucas, smirking on the sidelines
The identical Stand In punches Scott to the ground
He's good, right
Sometimes  let him do wide shots if  feel like getting blazed back in my winnie
Scott stands to fight the double
Suddenly, fan out behind the  , all identically dressed, all carrying skateboards and ready to rumble
'm nothing without my stunt team
The Stuntmen  Scott Pilgrim with a howl
Scott through a couple of the boards, Tae Kwon Doe style
Ask them how it feels to always get his sloppy seconds
How does it feel to- Scott takes a skateboard to the face, followed by a barrage of crippling skateboard blows to his knees and ribs
'm gonna get coffee
You homies want anything
We follow the smirking Lucas to the coffee station
We hear the noise of punching and kicking slowly subside to nothing

Controlling the future of Ramona's love life

Scott goes to shake it
Lucas gets him square in the mouth
Scott smiles through his aching jaw
You are a pretty good actor

But are you a pretty good skater

Lucas pulls down his shirt, revealing a skate company tattoo
So you can sell them, but can you do a thingy on that rail
Scott points to the   on the stairs
It's called a grind, bro
So can you do a grind thingy now
Are you serious
There's like 200 steps and the rails are garbage
Hey, if it's too hardcore
You really think you can goad me into doing a trick like that
There's girls watching
Somebody get me my board
Wallace taps Lucas' shoulder and hands him his skateboard
Hi
Big fan
Why wouldn't you be
Lucas   , a perfect ollie onto the rail
Scott and Wallace watch as Lucas disappears from sight, sparking down the
Cut back to Scott & Wallace, impressed at Lucas
Wow

Hey
It's me, Scott again
Call me back
Scott Pilgrim

Seriously
Scott ambles over to the fridge and rests his head on it
Yeah, you said that last night
You know what really sucks though
What
Everything
Come on guy, you can't say you didn't see this coming
It was right under your nose
Wallace points to the  Ramona scribbled which is pinned literally under Scott's nose on the refrigerator: , 212 664-7665, xxxxxxx What did you think these were
Kisses
Seven little kisses
Seven deadly 's

61 : 61 Wallace cocks an eyebrow
Scott slides to the floor
Why does everything have to be so complicated
Wallace crouches down to join Scott on the floor
If you want something bad, you have to fight for it
Step up your game
Break out the -word
Lesbian
The other -word
Lesbians
Okay, it's 'love'
wasn't trying to trick you or anything
Look, if she's really the girl of your dreams, then you have to let her know
You have to overcome any and all obstacles that lie in your path
You have the spirit of a warrior, Scott
You can do it
Be with her
It's your destiny
() Plus,  need you to move out
Scott's face falls, completely shocked at this bombshell
What
Why
Are you moving in with Other Scott or Jimmy or someone
Or someone
Either way, 'm kind of banking on her calling you back so won't have to evict you and feel all guilty and shit

Wallace appears over him
Okay
Everything does suck
Scott grunts
Wallace grins and grabs the phone
Or does it
Scott sits bolt upright, expectant
Oh, hey Knives
Scott lays back down
What's that
You're outside
Scott sits bolt upright again
Wallace opens the door a crack
Knives shivers outside, pale and broken looking
Is Scott here
You know what
Behind Wallace, we see Scott  through a window head first

Knives sighs
Scott sprints away in the background

He's pissed now

Okay, enough
Scott punches the air in front of him

She spins to face Scott
You punched me in the boob
Prepare to die, obviously
Listen, 've had it today
Can we not do this right now
#1: ( ) Love to postpone, darlin', but just cashed my last raincheck
What's that from
( ) My brain
Well whatever this is about, can it wait till 'm in the right frame of mind
#2: Nuh uh
This is one nightmare you can't wake up from
Wait, am  asleep right now
No
So, technically this is not a nightmare
() 64A
62 : (3) 62 Right
So how can  not wake up
If 'm not actually asleep
Don't question me
Scott shakes his head, baffled
Well, 'm really, really not up for this
Whatever it is
Okay little chicken, then 'll see you later
But you won't see me
Because 'll be deadly serious next time
What
Nevermind
- the Mystery Attacker vanishes
Scott looks to the sky
Oh man
Someone help me

-  63 Scott is in his usual payphone, dialing Stacey frantically
It's Scott
(
) What did he do this time
No, it's Scott
It's actually me
(
) What did you do this time
didn't do anything
It's everyone else that's crazy

63 : 63 (') Look  need to talk to you, 'm having a meltdown or whatever
Are you still working

) 'm literally about to leave
Cool, 'm coming in
Scott hangs up the phone and walks two steps into- 64

Stacey has her back turned
Think 'll make it a decaf today
Stacey turns around, revealing herself to be
What did you do with my sister
Stacey taps on the window outside, mouthing that she has to go
Scott turns back to Julie, not happy
What can  fucking get you
Is there anywhere you don't work
They're called 'jobs', something a fuckball like you wouldn't know anything about
And by the way, can't believe you fucking asked Ramona out after  specifically told you not to fucking do that
(Note to concerned reader: Everytime Julie says "", a black bar comes out of her mouth and the sound is bleeped
) How do you do that with your mouth
Neverfuckingmind how  do it
What do you have to say for yourself
Uh
Can  get a caramel macchiato
() 66
64 : 64 Maybe it's high fucking time you took a look in a mirror before you wreak havoc on another girl
Me
Wreak havoc
Julie points at     poster behind the counter with concert dates at the bottom
Fucking speaking of fucking which, hear the girl that kicked your heart in the ass is walking the streets of Toronto again
So  can pick up my coffee over here
Scott retreats away from Julie and bumps right into
They share an awkward moment
She looks at the floor
Sorry that got a little crazy last night
Yeah
You kind of disappeared
Yeah,  do that
Listen,  know it's hard to be around me sometimes
'll understand if you don't want to hang anymore
No
No,  want to hang
The whole evil ex-boyfriend thing
No biggie
Exes
mean,  know it's early days, but don't think anything can really get in the way of how
Scott hides behind Ramona as a lithe figure emerges from the steamed-milk mists of the coffee shop
the singer from has seemingly stepped out of the poster

She's totally jealous of you
Envy's jealous
How about that

How
About

What happened with the two of you
Do you mind if we don't get into that right now

Ramona stops and kisses him

Just because Envy's back in town doesn't make it not over
Double negative

Can't we do our own secret shows
All our shows are secret shows
We're doing it

We play the next round of the battle Saturday
We need to get some buzz going
We need groundswell
We need stalkers
Stills paces past the window to reveal
on her tearful face, pressed against the window
to see Scott cuddling with Ramona
What would you do
If your ex was in a band and they wanted you to open for them
If my ex was in the band
Yeah
It might be a little awkward
But maybe it's the grown up thing to do
Yeah, we're all adults right

She's cool
thought she was fat- Well she  she's cool
This is all her fault
Why
Tamara turns the faucet on and rinses Knives hair
It  be her fault
Obviously it's just a twist of fate or whatever, isn't it
Star crossed lovers
Born too late
Knives looks in the mirror:

Hey Ramona
Hey Todd
Been a while
Mmm hmm
Mmm hmm

How was the tour
You played with The Pixies
You're a superstar now
It's-yeah, it's not something  can really put into words
Um
Envy
read your blog
Todd and Julie glare at Knives
So
Scott and Ramona eh
What of it
You guys are a cute couple, you know
You suit each other
So what's your ulterior motive Envy, in general
She doesn't need ulterior motives, Stephen
She's got a write-up in Spin
You're my role model Envy
Just saying, cute couple
like your outfit Ramona
Affordable
was going to say, Envy
Did you get those jeans in New York, they're- 'm talking to Ramona right now
Ramona lived in New York
was just there
We played the Chaos Theatre for Gideon
You know him, right

So, are you guys doing anything fun while you're in town
Fun
In Toronto

It's not a big deal

Ramona and Sex Bob-Omb peer through the newly made hole in the wall, to see Scott sprawled on some trash bags
He tries to keep cool, despite being in a lot of pain
No kidding
anyone can be
vegan
Ovo-lacto vegetarian maybe
Ovo what
partake not in the meat nor breastmilk or ovum of any creature that has a face
Short answer: Being vegan just makes you better than most people
Bingo
Todd lifts up Scott telekinetically and throws him miles into the air
Scott sails out of shot and into space
Hey man, question
always wondered, how does not eating dairy products give you psychic powers
You know how you only use ten percent of your brain
Well, it's because the other 90% is filled up with curds and whey
Did you learn that at Vegan Academy
Go ahead and get snippy baby, if you knew the science, maybe 'd listen to a word you're saying

He moans in pain

How about you give me the Cliff Notes on how and why you ended up dating this a-hole
Is that really important right now
If there's a key element in his backstory that can help me out in a critical moment of not dying
Yes
brief, scrappy   of Young Todd and Ramona
(
) was only dating Lucas until the minute Todd walked by
guess that's not very nice, but  used to be kind of
like that
Young Ramona shoves Young Lucas down a hill and starts making out with Young Todd
(
) We hated everyone
We wrecked stuff
Nobody cared
Young Ramona and Young Todd wreck stuff
Nobody cares
(
) He punched a hole in the moon for me
It was pretty crazy
Young Todd punches a hole in the moon
It's pretty crazy
(
) week and a half later, he told me his Dad was sending him to the Vegan Academy, so  dumped him
Does that help you at all
The  ends
Scott can only fixate on one aspect
Have you dumped everyone you've ever been with
You've never been the dumpee
Ramona shrugs
Look, 've dabbled with being a bitch
It's part of the reason moved here
was really hoping to put it all behind me

Todd calls to a roadie
Get me my bass
The good one

Todd easily out-basses Scott, shredding him into oblivion
The enormous reverb  club debris towards Scott
The reverb is hurting my soul

can see in your mind's eye that you poured Half & Half into one of these coffees in an attempt to make me break vegan edge
'll take the one with soy
Thanks, tool
Todd floats to the ground, takes one of the cups and drinks
Actually,  poured soy in this cup, but thought real hard about pouring it in that one
You know, in my mind's eye or whatever
What are you talking about
You just drank Half & Half

That Todd guy was cool too
And hot
liked him
Scott sighs and holds a cold Coke Zero on his forehead
Are you okay
Uh huh
You sure about that
Do  look like 'm not okay
Scott does not look okay
Stills coughs
We're still going to the after show right
'm not sure it's gonna be much of a party,  think a third of the band just went 'poom'
Cool bands never go to their own after parties
It's just the desperate people trying to rub elbows with label guys
Then why would we
oh
Neil, you down

Not to my knowledge
Oh

Oh
Yet
Ooh

Scott limps a bit, lagging behind
Ramona falls back with him
We really don't have to go to this thing

81 : 81 No, 'm fine, 'm fine
It's just- It's just
() 86
81 : (2) 81 Well, not that fighting harder and harder battles for your love is getting old or anything

Scott and Ramona enter a big, fartsy, artsy
82

But are you saying Envy wasn't
We all have baggage
My baggage doesn't try and kill me every five minutes
What did you do to your ex-boyfriends to make them so insane
Exes

82 : 82 No break up is painless
Someone always gets hurt
What about you and that girl Knives
Knives
Who broke up with who
believe
broke up with her
And was she cool with that
Knives is with Young Neil now, she's totally cool with it
They pass Knives and Young Neil
She seemingly has no interest in her date and simply stares at Scott lovingly
You sure about that
Yeah
She's very mature for her age
It was a very healthy break up
We're all peaches and gravy
We hear an offscreen distant ' nooooo' from Knives
And what about you and Kim
They pass Kim
She's also staring at Scott
Not lovingly
Me and Kim
can barely remember
Why, is it important
Hey, you want to know everything about my past, dude
It was just

don't know
It was high school
She had freckles
It was cool,  guess
That's it
Yeah, it kind of ended
We changed

82 : (2) 82 Scott and Ramona have reached the bar at the party
That's really the whole story
had to fight a dude to get with her
fought a crazy eighty foot tall purple suited dude
And had to fight 96 guys to get to him, too
He was flying and shooting lightning bolts from his eyes
He was totally awesome and  kicked him so far he saw the curvature of the earth
Does that make you feel any better
Well now you are being a total ass
Welcome to the club
In the back glass of the bar, Scott sees his reflection: fringed hair, wicked glare
He catches himself
Sorry
'm not usually like this
Hey, don't worry
don't know what 'm like anymore
guess this whole ex-boyfriends thing is really messing with my head
Exes

Ramona tries to lighten things

Scott seems immediately drunk
Maybe you could just give me a list of all your exes so at least  know who's going to beat my ass into the ground next
Oh, like a handy little laminate or something
Let me see if  can find one
(looks through bag) Maybe we could exchange our information
Scott has already downed his second drink
Just out of sheer curiosity and concern for my mortal well-being, is there anyone at this party you haven't slept with
Ramona stops
Looks hurt
She touches her hair

He can't find Ramona, but comes upon standing alone in her homemade Sex Bob-Omb -shirt

Kim shrugs and signs it too, before trying to hand it back to Scott
Nuh-uh

Scottie, buddy, can  just say, keep your emotions in check
Don't let what's past screw up your future
Scott watches Ramona get into the Continental
She rolls the mirrored window up so Scott stares at his own reflection
The people need to hear us, Scott
Then you're going to need to find someone else to play bass

Looks like we're all set
Young Neil signs the contract
There are hand shakes all round
Gideon turns to Scott and pats him on the shoulder
Oh and Scott, we should really be thanking each other

One lens of his glasses cracks
He looks up at the steely eyed Scott
(') Who do you think you are Pilgrim
You think you're better than me
'll tell you what you are
pain in my ass
You know how long it took to get all the evil exes' contact information so  could form this stupid league
Like two hours
Gideon starts to pixellate quite badly
Not long now
(') You're not cool enough for Ramona
You're zero
You're nothing
Me
'm what's hip
'm what's happening
'm blowing up right now
() 117
99 : (8) 99 You're right
'm not cool enough for Ramona
And you got another thing right
You are blowing up
Right now
Scott spins and   Gideon in the face
Gideon's head , his glasses  down the steps of the pyramid
Then his body follows suit in an almighty- rain down
Scott and Knives kiss
Whoa
There goes our deal
We're still getting paid, right
Kim points to the falling coins
There goes our deal
Oh
Stills jumps off stage and picks up coins
The coin rain continues, silhouetting Scott and Knives in their kung fu poses
They share a smile
(
) You two make a good combo
Ramona, awake now, makes her way towards them
Yeah
Yeah
() 118
99 : (9) 99 The trio walk down the pyramid steps
Scott picks up Gideon's fallen glasses
The glasses
'  echoes
'  (
) You can defeat me
but can you defeat
yourself
Scott peers into the glimmering lenses, spotting his staring back at him
The glasses dissolve and Scott whips around to face
Negascott
walks towards Scott, Knives and Ramona
Fringed hair
Dark clothes
Evil face
Knives and Ramona flank Scott in a fighting stance
No
This is something  have to face on my own
The girls reluctantly exit stage left as Scott walks forward to confront his dark side
Scott and Negascott face off
Both take a step forward
100-103  100-103 104
-  104 Knives and Ramona huddle in the snow outside Chaos Theatre
They look expectantly at the entrance, worried for Scott
Then
Scott strolls out with Negascott
They chat amiably, shake hands and part ways
Scott approaches Knives and Ramona
What happened
Aw, nothing
We just shot the shit
He's a super-nice guy
We actually have a lot in common
Scott runs his fingers through his hair
Your hair
() 118A
104 : 104 What
() 119
104 : (2) 104 It's getting really shaggy
Scott's  appears on his head
He looks totally freked
Yeah
like it
Knives removes the hat from Scott's head, literally taking his guard down
Ramona sees this and smiles
You do
Scott smiles, then realizes Ramona has gone
He turns to see her, pulling her hood up and walking into the darkness
Scott calls after her
Steps tentatively away from Knives
Hey
Where are you going
Ramona, hoping to slip away, stops and turns back
dunno
should probably disappear
After all that
It's hard, you know
came here to get away, but the past keeps catching up
'm tired of people getting hurt because of me
Ramona looks at Knives as she says this
think  understand
Snow begins to fall
Ramona straightens his parka tenderly
should tahnk you, though
For what
For being the nicest guy  ever dated
() 119A
104 : (3) 104 That's kind of sad
( ) It is kind of sad
She takes his hand briefly, then lets it drop
Well
Bye and stuff
Yeah
And stuff
She turns to walk off again
Scott watches, then hears- (
) Go get her
Surprised, Scott turns back to see a smiling Knives
Wha
You earned it
You've been fighting for her all along
But what about you
(totally sweet and sad) 'll be fine
'm too cool for you anyway
She grins and kisses his cheek
There's someone out there for me
We hear a  - Young Neil sidles into frame behind her
Guitar still in hand
We hear a 2ND  - Nega Scott also sidles into frame
Knives doesn't look back, but urges Scott to- Go talk to her
Before she's gone
Ramona walks on into the night alone, but then- (
) Hey
mind if  tag along
() 119B
104 : (4) 104 Ramona is flabbergasted to see a cheery Scott walk alongside
You want to come with me
() thought maybe we could
try again
Ramona smiles
She holds out her hand like in the park scene earlier
Scott takes it
We see the door with the star on it, standing right in the middle of the street, snow swirling around it
Scott and Ramona walk towards the door, sunrise coming up over Toronto, night magically turning to day, winter turning to spring
Over this magical transformation, we hear a lush rendition of ' Ramona' swelling and hear whispers of gossip over Toronto's cell phone airwaves
(
) Oh my God, can  blow your mind
Scott Pilgrim totally threw down with Gideon Graves at the grand opening of Chaos Theater
Yeah, it was apparently awesome
(
) Oh my God, it was a  fight mean bananas
My little brother kicked a guy's head off
Literally
It was unbelievable
Someone seriously should have been filming it
Scott and Ramona walk through the door
Tilt up to the heavens and reveal the  graphic in the stars
