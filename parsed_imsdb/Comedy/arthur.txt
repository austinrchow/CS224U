Written by Peter Baynham 10/16/09 - , who from his tatty suit may have been a top broker this time last year, is picking through a bin in Manhattan's deserted night-time financial district
The street starts to vibrate
approaches
huge black shape smashes into view -   ' Our audience wonder if they've wandered into the wrong movie
The Homeless Man dives for cover
The Batmobile smashes into a row of parked cars
We hear manic laughing from inside the car, which screeches and careers violently into a sign reading ` '
Sirens herald    in hot pursuit
The Batmobile roars up Wall Street, bashing against the New York Stock Exchange, thumping up and down the Federal Hall's steps and finally smashing at high speed into the rear end of the famous 'Charging Bull' statue
Two enormous bronze testicles thud onto the Batmobile's bonnet and roll away
The cop cars screech up, surrounding the Batmobile and   surround it, weapons drawn
appears, blazing the Batmobile in white light
Cooool
An older Cop flashes the rookie a dirty look, then points a into a tiny window
- actually drunken English socialite    in a costume - lowers the window and offers a handshake
Evening, Constable
1 (seen it all before) Hi, Arthur
Are you familiar with the expression ` can explain everything'
1 Out of the car, please
2
Terribly sorry, but in the film they used a different model to show the old Batchap getting in and out
This one has no doors, so 'd have to squeeze out the back arsehole first
Which nobody wants
(  2) Apart from you, cheeky monkey
() It's a joke
Okay, okay
Arthur wriggles awkwardly out of a rear hatch
The bronze bull teeters, a little scarily
He stands, wobbly
His Batman utility belt features a big water pistol, a firework, a hip flask and line of shot glasses
And, inexplicably, a big red stapler
The younger cop is desperately fighting the giggles
1 Okay, explain everything
Well
What with having spunked 1
6 million fat Alberts on this little runaround,  thought why not take it a step further and try to actually collar a few ne-er do wells
It worked for the billionaire Bruce Wayne, why not the future billionaire Arthur Bach- Templemead
Will  have to do traffic school
2 How much have you drunk, Arthur
To use the technical medical term - megabloodyshitloads
Either that or 've had a stroke
But fret not, have a designated driver
The cop shines his flashlight back inside, revealing 60S `' costume
Where's my five thousand dollars
Arthur counts out a huge wad of cash
The Boy Homeless here neglected to say he'd never driven
() 3
(') Or that the only reason he's sober is to be ready for the conspiracy of leopards about to seize Manhattan
It's
English prick
Arthur hands another wad of cash to Cop 1
trust this will cover all repairs to New York and any inconvenience to your good selves
He turns and tries to get back in
(') Up up and away
Ah, no, that's the other chap
The bronze bull collapses fully, crushing the Batmobile
23RD
-  - Arthur sits, minus mask, in a cell with Homeless Robin and and , including , sporting a terrifically swollen eye
, a drunk with a bandaged neck, is ranting away at Arthur, who's paying close attention, genuinely fascinated
Cash sticks out of various pockets
Then the crazy motherfucker cut me
Goodness
Why
Said  cut the bombita with pig killer
Rude man
And who threw hot Americano in whose face again
did in his
No half and half neither
That shit burnt
Jay laughs hard, as does , another crook
Arthur, out of politeness, tries to join in the laughter
4
burnt my sister's hair
(high fiving him) Cool
Ho wanted to evict me, just 'cause don't fit her definition of hygiene
Plenty of places to take a shit, toilet's just one of them
Just ask the a-rabs
It's like a chat show, this
(looking into an imaginary ) It's been said of my next guest, by Jay the bandaged lunatic, that she's `a sick-ass, whacked-out, whacked-up asswipe'
(to a ) Carmella, when did you first dream of becoming a crack whore
Mother died when  was six
Oh -d,  hate when that happens
My father raped me when  was twelve
Sounds like you had six relatively good years
What do you do
model riding boots,  spend money,  sleep with women
But have weekends off and  am my own boss
The cell door swings open
1 Hey, The Drunk Knight
Your Fairy - d-lawyer's here
5
() never thought New York's underbelly could be quite such agreeable company
shall never forget you
Farewell
The crooks look back at him sulkily
Arthur looks guilty
23RD
- Arthur's attorney   is leaving with him
don't think your mother will be pleased, Arthur
Really, Elverton - if a chap can't help out a few chums, whatever their station in life
The other crooks from the cell are leaving alongside them
(') Each has given his or her word to put the criminal life behind them
23RD
- Arthur steps into a blaze of paparazzi flashes
am the Batman
Gotham can sleep easy tonight
(points at  ) Don't point that shit at me, bitch
will
Jay attacks the cameraman violently
Gary piles in
Yes
Yes
Kill the lizards
Arthur pushes past the press
Arthur
What will your mother say
Didn't she send you here to get you out of the British papers
Arthur
6
He turns to those crooks who aren't fighting
Anyone need a job
My last driver resigned after  filled his limo with squirrels
Preferably sober, clean driving licence
The crooks all look unsure
Apart from one
- different, extremely flashy car zips through Central Park, the back full of released crooks, the huge Chicago guy - his name's  - at the wheel
The car passes
It stops and backs up
Arthur opens a door and beckons the jogger, offering champagne
The jogger gets in
The car sets off again
(
) Anyone know a good bar
- The car pulls up outside a very rough-looking dive club
Out falls Arthur, laughing his head off, along with champagne bottles, footballs and rich boy's toys
Following him are his crook friends, the jogger,  -  and in a leotard twirling a big sign reading ` ' Like the pied piper, Arthur leads his disciples into the bar
: - Arthur staggers out, leading a bigger crowd
(
) He's even more drunk, arm in arm with Carmella the prostitute and a very attractive young woman,
He produces Stand back
He releases the firework; it flies at a crazy drunk angle, people screaming and diving for cover
It explodes into a shop sign reading ` '
7
() Oh, man
Nobody tell you about the recession
The what
- very long line of excited people stand at an , Arthur at the front
Roll up, roll up, folks, let's fix this thing right now
(to his first customer) How much, sir
Um
$800 please
Coming right up
(keys it in) Fries with that
The man laughs, along with others in the line, including Sofia who catches his eye
(') Congratulations everyone '
Arthur dials a number on his gold iPhone
(') Pierre
Arthur Bach-Templemead
Can you squeeze me in for a little snack
Yeah, just me and a couple of mates
-  - The Maitre ' enters from the kitchen and is stunned to find the restaurant incredibly stuffed with people, so there's standing room only
People are even sitting on tables
It's a very eclectic mix of people
An angry, stuffy old man and his wife and daughter sit horrified at the center
8
Arthur's flanked by Carmella the prostitute and Sofia from the  line
Pierre
We'd like 182 pate de foie gras, 182 chateaubriand steaks, a motherlode of chips and your entire wine cellar please
The daughter of the stuffy couple - she's  - speaks
Arthur
( ) Erica
Fancy meeting you here
Er
Everybody, this is Erica - the very best friend forever of my girlfriend Susan
And Erica's parents Ernest and Margaret
(to Erica and her parents) Are you familiar with the expression ` can't explain anything'
Who are the women with you, Arthur
Oh, um, this is Sofia
believe she works for Avis
Checks the cars for dings, dead people in the trunk, that sort of thing
And this is Carmella
Anyway
' What do you do, Carmella
Whatever you want
But no penetration without a rubber
It's all gone a bit tense
Carmella's joking
She's actually a
queen
Of a very small country
' Is she now
It's terribly small
9
' see
Rhode Island could beat the crap out of it in a war
' Yes, it's a small place
85 cents in a cab from one end of the country to the other
'm talking small
' think  understand how small it is
Just had the entire country carpeted, this is not a big place
' You need to grow up, Arthur
That's easy for you to say, you haven't got 50 pairs of short trousers hanging in your closet
Maybe we should go somewhere else
Maybe you should
He gets out his ultra-exclusive Black Visa Card
Could  have all those lobsters to go, please
- The bright dawn sun explodes on the windows of Arthur's castle-like $56 million penthouse atop the Pierre Hotel
'  -  - huge jacuzzi is full of contented liberated lobsters, surrounded by the most amazing toy boat armada in history
10
We cut around the vast, opulent 20's apartment, scattered with unconscious revellers from last night
mixture of old extravagance and modern excess, the place is stuffed with the toys of the boy who has everything: An old gun cabinet is stacked with enormous water rifles
`Bodyworlds' plastinated corpse is posed, swinging from a chandelier, a bottle of champagne in its hand
Damien Hurst's shark in formaldehyde is half out of its smashed tank, a '  protruding from its jaws
Unconscious partygoers are slumped on plush seats in a home cinema themed to look like the set of `Roadrunner', while a screen plays episodes of the cartoon
naked couple lie in a sleeping embrace in a room converted entirely into a sandpit, complete with giant toys
Big Chicago Marty, Arthur's new driver, lies on a big sofa, consulting his sports pager
Homeless Robin is filling pans and antique vases with water
huge photo of Arthur modelling riding boots fills a wall, beside an old red London telephone box, converted into an aquarium, bubbling with colorful fish

(brightly, as he humps) Morning, Hobson
Unfazed, Hobson busies herself picking up Arthur's trousers, and emptying wallet, matchbooks, and iPhone into the tray
Morning, Arthur
She hits a remote
The curtains fly open
flips on, showing news coverage of Arthur's antics last night

Hobson's reading a text on Arthur's phone: `So excited ur funding my movie
' The African heritage festival celebrated five months from now
She replies: ` was drunk
Piss off

(noticing Sofia's stopped having sex with him) Why are you stopping
Oh, sorry
How impolite of me
Sofia, this is Hobson, my nanny
Nanny
He's merely shaped like an adult
Is she going to stay here
Hobson, could you come back in a minute and a half please
Negative
You're seeing your mother this morning
Nobody told me
Actually  did, on the other side of the vast moat of champagne known as `last night'
Hobson picks up Sofia's panties and bra from the floor like a crime scene officer
(') wouldn't recommend letting him get used to your breasts, dear
Addictive personality
He was at mine until he was six
Hobson
Really
had to dab Tabasco sauce on the nipples to see him off
can't do this
She pulls away from Arthur, grabs her clothes and jumps out of bed, nearly tipping Arthur out
13
support your decision 100%
Will you be requiring a taxi, or just be getting in a random passing car
Sofia storms to the door, clutching her clothes
Arthur can see other revellers being removed by
(') Say goodbye to your new friends, Arthur
They have to go back to the recession now
Arthur covers his head with the sheet
Cancel my mother please, Hobson
'll work from bed today
But Hobson hits a touch-sensitive screen on the wall
The magnetic bed thuds to the ground
She taps another control
: , (') Not the death metal, please
(shouting over the music) Aren't you a fan of Carcass
Hobson reads off an album cover in a little wall screen
(') `Vomited Anal Tract' is surely a classic of its genre

Arthur sits up
Hobson stops the music
Good boy
'm going for a shower
'll alert the media
14
- Arthur stands naked in his shower - a big glass cube jutting out from the balcony like something from a David Blaine stunt
Hot jets of water are blasted from holes in the cube's ceiling
Arthur can see Manhattan far beneath his bare feet as he showers
() To Bombay, a travelling circus came
Arthur grabs a pair of binoculars which hang on a hook
They brought an intelligent elephant and Nellie was her name
Hobson
We see Hobson on a little screen inset into the glass wall
She's on a phone at Arthur's computer
Female Tom Hanks
-  - Hobson - in front of an Ebay screen full of purchases - picks up her own pair of binoculars and looks down

Can we invite her up and dress her as Forrest Gump
No
Just for a laugh
We'll pay her

- Arthur, in expensive baggy yoga pants and collarless shirt, is doing self-invented yoga to Indian `meditation' music

Hobson is sitting, exasperated, going through various expenditures
Arthur, you have to stop giving money away

'm a philanthropist
With the emphasis on the `pissed'

- Arthur and Hobson are in a huge Bentley
Marty's at the wheel, still in his Cubs shirt but sporting a chauffeur's cap and tie
As he drives, he checks a bleeping sports pager
He nearly hits a pedestrian, then goes back to the pager
Sorry, fellas
() You don't seriously intend to keep employing this gentleman
17
Give the guy a chance, Hobson
He got laid off in Chicago
But he doesn't know his way around New York
So
want interesting, fun people around me, not drones who just get the job done
Arthur sees something out of the window
(') Marty
Stop the car
Marty hits the brakes, pitching Arthur and Hobson forward
- Arthur hurries up to
(
) The Chrysler Building
Designed by William Van Allen
wearing a name badge reading `Naomi' is talking
She is gorgeous, wearing vintage clothes, clutching a clipboard
We understand why Arthur stopped the car
and inspired by the machine age of the 1920s, this magnificent structure was the world's tallest building for 11 months before the Empire State stole its thunder
She looks out on her sullen, miserable tourists
(') The Chrysler got its name when the builder went bust in the 1928 Cement Famine and had to melt down his Chrysler to make the pointy bit at the top
If you peer closely you can still make out remnants of a hub cap and a sticker reading `Honk twice if you voted Hoover
' Some tourists laugh
Some don't
Arthur's transfixed
18
(') That was a joke, folks
It was built for the Chrysler corporation
Naomi shares an eye roll with    who's clearly in love with her
(') The spire is a beauty, especially on a winter's morning when the sun hits it and it just seems to
() How tall is it
1047 feet madam, not allowing for pigeon shit
Okay, let's cross
Naomi leads the tourists across the busy road
She has to go back to grab a teenager in the headphones, who didn't hear
Arthur hurries alongside Naomi
Can  join your tour please
Sure
It's $15, plus $5 for the free authentic street pretzel
Sorry, my bosses make the prices
Arthur produces his wallet full of high-end credit cards
(') Sorry
can't take cards
() Ah, owe me it
start on that corner every day on the hour
Just as Naomi's reaching the other side, a cabbie, driving very aggressively, nearly hits her
(') Hey, you big blind jerk
Doesn't your braille windshield work
() 19
, The cabbie's shocked - but laughs and blows Naomi a kiss
She smiles back
Wow
What did you say
Just generalised criticism of his parents and genitals
(to the tourists) Everyone make it over alive
Excellent
Next we enter Times Square, world famous for New Year's Eve, when a Waterford Crystal Ball descends at eye-poppingly slow speed for the inexplicable entertainment of a million drunk fools
Many people think the square is actually a square, despite blatant evidence otherwise
( ) Sir
What shape is Times Square

() See
Morons
More tourists laugh this time
Some
When do we get the pretzel
Soon, sir
Soon
She checks her watch and leads the party inside a laundromat
(') Okay, next the very Laundromat once used by George Gershwin, Donald Trump
20
-  - Naomi approaches a washing machine just as it ends its cycle and makes a loud buzz
Mr Big from Sex and the City and three of the 9-11 terrorists
She starts unloading the machine of a large man's whites - vests, underwear, shirts, all stained red by a baseball cap
(') Oh, dad
She transfers the laundry into a tumble dryer and feeds it quarters
Arthur stays close
(') The Welsh poet Dylan Thomas drank himself to death at the Chelsea Hotel half an hour after losing a sock in this very dryer
() Are you abusing this tour to do your errands
Are you abusing the tour to stalk me
Absolutely
Arthur stares at the big tumble dryers
(') These things are amazing
Have you ever put all your father's clothes on and just got inside one
Naomi looks at him, bemused but intrigued as she heads to the door
- Hobson's out of the car looking for Arthur
Where the blazes is that boy
Arthur
21
-  - They emerge into the street
Ahead, the jewel in Manhattan's crown, the Empire State Building
This iconic symbol of American corporate might was adapted during World War 2 in case of attack from enemy forces
At three minutes' notice the entire structure can retract into the ground like a tortoise's head
That's not possible
should know, 'm a civil engineer
You're not being very civil to me
Some tourists laugh
The building doesn't retract; the ground rises up
Exactly
The ground rises up
Thank you, sir
They were going to install giant legs so if a plane was flying at the tower it could run away
But where's it going to run
Manhattan's in the way
It'd have to jump in the Hudson
Victory to the Nazis
Is that what you want
The group approaches a pretzel stand
(') Okay, folks, your pretzel awaits
The group lines up to get their pretzels
22
(') Do  know you from somewhere
If you go on Perez Hilton or
What are they
The gossip websites
That the internet
Ah, my computer's too old for all that
For the internet
Seriously
Life's too short for all this obsessive upgrading
You consider the internet an upgrade
Wow
So why do people gossip about you
Ah, that was a joke
'm nobody
Arthur feels a tap on his shoulder
Hobson
You're late for your mother
( ) Sorry, this pretzel stand is a watering hole for the crazies
(raises her voice to ) The soup kitchen's just up and to the left, honey
Hobson, this is
(reads her badge) Naomi
She's with you
23
Delighted to meet you, Naomi
Normally one has to go to a bowling alley to meet a woman of your stature
Ooh, Grandma's got jokes
You aren't the first woman who walks the streets this young man has asked
Who's this
Joan Rivers' older bitterer sister
My nanny
Obviously
Seriously, who is she
My nanny
Well, she started as that, but these days she's more of an all-round enforcer and bodyguard
Naomi looks at her watch and glances to the tourists, chewing on their pretzels
She starts to walk away
Sorry,  have to get out the cattle prod and haul ass
Got another tour starting in eight minutes
Can  call you
Naomi starts to walk away
don't give my number to grown men with nannies
But as you may not be a grown man, it's 917 476 2030
Manhattan swallows the lovely stranger
24
-  - They cross a huge foyer, passing a big sign reading `  ' to the elevator
But what if this is the one
This is just like the Komodo dragon
Everyone else is happy to see one in the zoo and leave it there
You had to own one
Thank goodness that handbag manufacturer was prepared to take the poor lizard away
() You said he's in London Zoo
He is, Arthur
Are you the only one allowed to joke now
- Reception is manned by , a too-cool-for-school, young Aryan beefcake straight out of an Abercrombie & Fitch spread
Arthur and Hobson enter
don't like it here
Of course you don't
People work here
( ) Good afternoon, Mr Bach-Templemead
Hi Grant
Tell me - which of your parents are you most like
Abercrombie or Fitch
(doesn't get the joke) have no connection with that store
My family name is Von Krausehoff
Take a seat please
25
Arthur and Hobson sit down
Grant picks up a phone
(') Vivienne

mmmm
Don't fret, Arthur
This won't take long
Then we'll have ice cream

(
) Come in, Arthur
Arthur heads to the door
- a formidable, tanned American widow in her sixties, shakes his hand
(') Arthur
Vivienne
You know  prefer `mother'
'm sorry
You look more like a Vivienne
Vivienne nods to Hobson as the door to her lair shuts
An icy breeze passes between biological mother and surrogate
'  -  - The office boasts many glass cases full of trophies and framed photos of Vivienne's younger self showjumping and holding trophies aloft
There's one small photo of Vivienne, Arthur's late father  and Arthur as a toddler
Vivienne's engrossed in a document, making notations
Arthur, clearly uncomfortable here, sits in a low sofa before her
(not looking up) So
How are you, Arthur
Quite busy
have a riding boot shoot for Petrie Dressage
26
But Vivienne's buried in her work, not listening
(') What else
'm meeting Ivanka Trump for brunch to discuss the environment
She's sending her helicopter to avoid the traffic
Vivienne's still not listening
(') Crashed my Batmobile into the bronze bull on Wall Street
She's still not listening
Has it always been like this
(') which caused a hole to swallow up the New York Stock Exchange
She's still not listening
(') the world economy to collapse and the planet to descend into looting and cannibalism
Still not listening
(') What else
Um
tripped over in the shower this morning
Head split open, found a family of meerkats hiding in there
Hated the thought of the little lads being homeless so  bricked up the remaining half of my brain, popped them back in and Hobson glued my skull back together
Still not listening
(') 'm thinking of buying a giant think the market's right for it
Arthur stops
He watches Vivienne
He lets out a huge belch
Nothing
big fart
Nothing
Opera
Nothing
(') You really are a shoddy mother
Vivienne eventually looks up
27
Did  hear you say you were meeting Ivanka Trump for brunch
That's nice
Right
Today we're going to have a friendly chat
Then a serious talk
And lastly make a timetable
How does all that sound
Amazing
Do you have any vodka
What happened, Arthur
You were such a sweet baby
still wake up in my own poo occasionally
Right, that's it for the chat
Time to transition to our talk
Vivienne hits a remote control
large wall-mounted screen fills with a changing collage of him drunk, dancing, puking, making out with women, beside countless news headlines
(') This insanity has to end, Arthur
As the delightful coffee-coloured gentleman who runs this country said, `The time has come to set aside childish things
' Can't Hobson set them aside for me
Susan is a splendid girl
Her feet are on the ground, she's of fine stock
( ) Oh
That's what this is all about
'm not marrying Susan
don't love her
And
You think  spent my marriage to your father skipping through meadows
28
Not after you ran him over in the Bentley, no
Susan's boring
She's not funny
Ditto your father
The aristocracy doesn't marry for `fun', Arthur
It's about stability
Continuity
and sinking your fangs into Susan's father's bank account
The Johnson family's considerable equity in a stormy financial period is merely a side issue
Burt is a pillar of the community
His baby formula was taken off the market in six African countries
completely innocent error in places where there's precious little for children to live for anyway
The families all got gift baskets as compensation
That little bump in the road aside, Burt is a devout Christian
Yes, because they're never insane
And where did he get Jesus
( ) Burt paid his debt to society years ago
He strangled a fireman
Who strangles a fireman
Arthur
29
'm sorry, Vivienne
've met someone else very lovely who, as far as  know, isn't related to anyone who would kill an unsung hero in cold blood
Un-meet her
Arthur, you're the end of our line
We need an heir
nearly gave you an heir
Oh, give me strength

That was just her stage name
To give her more mystery when she

Susan is 33 this year
Her egg inventory has dropped by 23% since you met her
You risk having no sons, or worse, some pea-brained hunchback who hugs everyone
Great
like hugs
And some of them are really good at math
(heading to the door) You know the `Frog and Toad' books
No
Of course you don't
Hobson read them to me while you were off riding horses over stripey poles
They're about fun and friendship, not how many unspasticated tadpoles can squirt up a rich girl
Your father would turn in his grave to hear this nonsense
30
That  won't follow in his footsteps and marry a woman  hate
think he might climb out of the grave and dance on it
Suit yourself
Vivienne holds up the document she was notating earlier
(') My will, which  have updated to designate Grant in reception as the sole beneficiary
You wouldn't
You're my

Try me
Vivienne opens a draw and takes out
(') Shall we segue to the timetable part of our meeting

Arthur eats lunch alone at a huge table,        is beside him
Hobson brings a plate of vitamins
Ah
The ring your father gave your mother,  recall
(feeling its huge weight) Did he knock her out with it, then drive her to the church in the trunk of his Bentley
No
Your father was a gentleman
What's gentlemanly about dying before  knew him
That's just rude
Did he ever love my mother
31
They had their days
Ah well
At least he doesn't have to wake up every day to a woman with a face like saran wrap stretched over a gargoyle
Arthur stares at the ring again
(') What about Naomi
Arthur
say this with love: Uh-oh
Even by modern male standards you're a breathtakingly immature little shit
Coupled with the kind of money you have access to, that's deadly
Susan may not have a four hour stand up routine about the Flatiron Building, but she's a solid girl who will look after you
have you for that
Not forever
Yes forever

list is beside him, reading `Picnic in park, movie, dinner, view
' What sort of food do you like
Anything but guts and mushrooms
Okay, enough questions
Oh come on
This all helps build up a profile of you before  trick you into my basement
'd hate to not have your favourite snacks ready
Turkey Jerky and Pez
Are we done
Just that
34
The line goes dead
Hobson is standing behind Arthur, the ripped out phone cord in her hand
Time to get engaged, Arthur
The Komodo dragon can wait
The original Delorean from `Back to the Future' putters up to Burt Johnson's imposing, tacky mansion
The car stops and the gull wing door swings up, revealing an extremely drunk Arthur, clutching a bottle of champagne
- ,    answers
Hi
Is it June 19th at 7 pm
No, sir
It's 8
34
We overshot
Time travel can be a real cunt sometimes, don't you think
'll be right back
See you in an hour and a half ago
The butler doesn't laugh
'  -  - Arthur and the butler enter the large, paneled study
Would you care for anything while you wait
trampoline and a selection of woodland creatures if that's not too much trouble
The butler leaves
Arthur gazes around the room, which is filled with antique Christian iconography
The ceiling fan is in the shape of a cross
large, scary Jesus statue, palms outstretched, stares at him from beside a fish tank
He sees a cocktail cabinet
35
(') Ah
( ) Shhhhh
He opens the cabinet
Nothing but bottles of water
(') Bollocks
( ) Sorry
Actually, you couldn't, um
you know
(points to the water) turn this into a nice 1990 Romanee Conti, could you
He sips the water as if it's wine
Lifts it to Jesus
(') Cheers ears
He checks out a huge, very old, rusty sword on the wall
Beneath it is a small information plaque
(') `Genuine Sword of the First Crusade
Excavated Germany, 1972'
He looks around, then reaches up and takes it off
It's heavy and clanks to the ground, slamming his foot
(') Jesus Fucking Christ
( ) Sorry
It's not like you shouted `Arthur Fucking Bach' when they pinned you up
Sorry
Sore subject
Arthur lifts the sword again, brandishing and twirling it, making the noise of a Star Wars light sabre
(') Feel the force, Luke
He swings it in a full arc
Arthur has decapitated Jesus
Where's the head
The door opens
, a large, imposing man with a tiny crucifix around his neck, fills the doorway
Arthur
36
, er, had a bit of food stuck in my teeth and couldn't find a toothpick
Burt, unperturbed, takes the sword from Arthur
Heck, this sword went through three crusades
Beheaded 1000 moslems
Nothing you can do to harm it
Burt walks straight past headless Jesus to the water cabinet
Arthur looks around desperately for the head
You don't, um, have anything stronger, do you
Sparkling
Arthur laughs nervously
But Burt's not joking
(') `The drunkard and the glutton shalt come to poverty: and drowsiness shalt clothe a man with rags
' Surely a glass of sherry at Christmas
Burt clinks glasses with him
Peace be with you
And also with me
He sees Jesus's head
It's sitting on top of one of the blades of the ceiling fan
Arthur
Can  be honest with you
You're the real Slim Shady
knew it
37
My faith teaches me to hate the sin, not the sinner
But with you, struggle with that belief
Burt turns away to get a glass of water
You could switch to Judaism
(glances up at the fan) Bit warm in here
Do you mind if put the fan on
Arthur turns the fan on a low setting
It rotates slowly, the head going around with it
Burt turns away to pour more water
Arthur grabs the moment to speed up the fan again, until it's going fast enough and Jesus's head falls off
Arthur catches it
Arthur gets behind Burt, out of sight temporarily
Anyway, Arthur
However  feel about you, my daughter loves you
Yes, it's a problem, isn't it
Arthur reaches out and, unseen by Burt, he reaches out of shot and puts the head back on Jesus's body
(') Let's knock our heads together and find a way to stop her loving me
Got it
We'll tell her 'm on the sex offenders register
No, am and she knows
() Joke, sorry
Ah
We'll say 'm gay
did once dabble actually, so can tell a plausible story
You made love to a guy
One Moslem doesn't make a mosque, Burt
You made love to a Moslem
38
No, sir, it was Prince Alois of Lichtenstein and he made love to me
The fact that it took three bottles of poppers and a Jacuzzi full of Krug to loosen me up confirmed my heterosexuality
Arthur notices that Jesus's head is on backwards
Burt picks up a Bible from his desk and quotes from memory
`If there is a man who lies with a male, they shall surely be put to death
' Crikey
Couldn't there just be some kind of on-the-spot fine
Burt really hammers the table this time
You will stop this talk and marry - my - fucking
Jesus's head falls off
Arthur peers around
It's nowhere
Oh bollocks
Both Arthur and Burt see Jesus's head at the bottom of the fish tank
It floats back up to the top
(') It's a miracle
He is risen
But , Burt's beautiful daughter, enters with her best friend Erica - who Arthur met whilst at the restaurant the other night
(') Hi Susan
Erica
Burt looks from Jesus's head to the sword, figuring it out
Sorry to make you wait, Arthur was talking to your mother
hear you have something to ask me
Arthur feels Burt's smiling face - and hating eyes - on him
39
Shall we go
- performs the specials menu with ludicrous elan
Susan is rapt, taking it all very seriously
(
) the chef has bathed the bass in a parceline of Chilean fennel and finished him with a little gift of kobe beef
Also  have a progressive tasting of Kumamoto oysters en gelee which evolve on the palate, from light and refreshing to complex and spicy short story with a twist at the end
Le fin
Susan chuckles approvingly, knowingly, the twit
She coos with delight and claps in appreciation
Do you have something with less words please
The chef doesn't have to re-cook it, just scrape off the nouns and trim out all that gibberish in the middle
He's just joshing, Dominic
'll do the skate in wood ear mushroom
Excellent decision
Sir
bowl of champagne and a spoon
The waiter leaves, despising Arthur
Arthur, did you really have to be so icky to Dominic
'm sorry
just can't handle the whole specials act
It's not a Shakespearean soliloquy, it's some heated up dead things that aren't on the main menu
40
slams a bowl and spoon next to Arthur
He pours in champagne
You know,  was grumbling to your mother about how things are with us sometimes
How 'm sure you're trying to drive me away
Arthur slurps his champagne
Um hm
But she was explaining that relationships are like property purchases; invest only in high-end stock, avoid anyone 'up-and- coming', then hold onto the property through thick and thin to deliver maximum return
Isn't that darling
Is it possible to buy the house but then rent it out
Sorry, joke
'm not suggesting pimping you
Arthur sees a very frail, rich old woman dripping in diamonds, passing by on her walking frame
(') Look
You after our first child is born
Arthur
Why can't you learn to laugh at genuinely amusing things
Such as
YouTube clips of babies giggling
Dane Cook
Susan
Why are we together
love you, Arthur
And you love me, whatever you think
41
We don't have the same sense of humour
We don't like the same films, food, music
You like horses,  think they're arrogant idiots
Don't they say opposites attract
That depends on the opposites
Racists and the Nation of Islam don't secretly want to 69 each other
Susan, you're beautiful
You're bright
You're fucking loaded
Is there really no one else who could make you happy
No
Never
Well,  had a thing at college
That was serious for a while
But daddy
She stops herself
Daddy what
Prayed to Jesus for it not to work out, then shot the bloke behind a meat truck
Because Jesus would consider that cheating
Susan places her hand on Arthur's
Ask me, Arthur
Arthur takes Susan's hand
Susan
You're the only woman
at this table
waiter tops up Susan's wine
Arthur, now very drunk, holds out his champagne bowl to be refilled
42
You're not happy, Arthur
Nobody who drinks like you can be happy
How do you know
What if the drunker  get the better it is for me
Not everyone who drinks is a poet, Susan
Some of us drink because we're not poets
The waiter arrives with Susan's fish and Arthur's drink
real woman could stop you from drinking
It'd have to be a real big woman
Ask me, Arthur
Arthur sinks to his knees
Susan waits
and waits
Arthur has passed out
Susan kicks him awake
He fumbles away in the gloom, getting out the ring box and trying to get it on her finger
At table level, Susan waits, irritated
(
) All done
Susan pulls her hand up, and gazes at the huge, glinting diamond - pushed onto the end of her thumb
(') Susan
Would you marry me
Take the weekend if you want
Yes, 'll marry you
She nods imperceptibly at the waiter
Ladies and gentleman - the happy couple
Music starts
congratulatory round of applause
Confetti is thrown
The whole restaurant cheers
Susan whips out her Blackberry and starts hitting keys
43
Erica will be the planner
Erica
She hates me
Who  love, she loves
Oh, come on
She always looks like she wants to set fire to my face then put it out with an Uzi
Susan's phone rings
() Hello
thanks, daddy
Sorry, hang on,  have Erica calling
What's going on
only just bloody proposed
Arthur's phone rings
The caller
reads `Vivienne'
He kills the call and sits, horrified, as the entire restaurant celebrates his grim fate
-  - In the gloom we track past the crushed Batmobile, the Delorean and other famous cars, to find Arthur sitting in from `Knight Rider'
(') What have  done, Kitt
This mistake's up there with Hitler joining his school debating team
() Go to bed, Arthur
Arthur jumps out of his skin
But it's Hobson, standing by the car holding a dressing gown and a mug of cocoa
And stop this self-pitying bibble
You're going to be fabulously rich
Maybe 'd rather be fabulously poor
Some poor people  see look happy
44
That's either because they're far away or you've just given them money
Arthur, poor people have to work
They stand for hours in the rain, waiting for buses full of other poor people to take them to things called `jobs' which they do all year round to pay for holidays away from those jobs
Don't patronise me
have a job
Lying drunk on a bale of hay in riding boots being photographed by another pampered prick won't prepare you for the work  mean
And  don't want to see you suffer
Take your fish oil
' ,  - very old Apple Mac sits on a cluttered desk
Ralph is in his chair, eating Popeye's Chicken n' Biscuits, watching  on an old  with a tiny satellite dish on top
When are we getting cable
(
) We have satellite
Honey, that's some bullshit aerial from the 99 cent Store
It's a satellite dish
read the box
It said `No satellite fees to pay because does not receive satellite signals
' That's like saying `Hey - eat this plate of broken glass
It won't make you fat
'cause '
' Naomi comes in, looking absolutely beautiful
She checks her hair in the mirror
45
It's better than nothing
Ralph unplugs the dish
The picture improves
No it ain't
Honey,  love you, but you're even cheaper than your mom
And she bought food from yard sales
miss her too, daddy
But now she's gone and if 'm going to keep you in grits and Oprah the rest of your life, you live by my rules
But you live like you're preparing for a war
And you earn a decent salary
So

What's he do, this English bum
Who cares
He's nice
He's funny
On , a female body is being unearthed
Yeah and  bet that girl said the same about her date
Honey, stay home
don't want you ending up like that poor girl
bad actress holding her breath
She changes the channel to something else
(') Stop watching
beep from outside
She kisses him and leaves
- Arthur's Bentley pulls up at a quiet part of Battery Park
46
(
) Sorry we drove around so long
Navigation isn't my driver's strong point
There's a huge ding in one side of the car
(') Or road awareness
-  - Arthur and Naomi sit in the back of the car, while Marty checks sports results on his pager
Can you put this on please
Arthur's holding a blindfold
On a first date
Are you crazy
Trust me
Arthur
We're in Battery Park at night
've met you once - in the company of your nanny
You make a disturbing number of jokes about stalking and basements
My dad already has you down as a mass murderer
And you want me to put on a blindfold
give you my word - if  kill and eat you, you'll never see me again
She shrugs and puts on the blindfold
- Arthur guides Naomi in the dark
She stumbles
Okay, 'm officially a little worried
She tries to pull her blindfold off
47
() Don't worry
Arthur removes her blindfold
She's stunned to find herself on a huge blanket under a tree in a clearing lit by numerous candles
Before them is spread the most amazing picnic of all time
Flowers are everywhere
log fire burns in a grate
Soft music plays
(') You said you wanted a picnic
He pours them glasses of 1928 Krug
Arthur,  don't know what to say
It's beautiful
( ) Who did all this
The picnic fairies
Who liaised with the flower fairies, the candle fairies, the log fire fairies, the hidden sound system fairies
He lifts a silver platter lid to reveal a vast pizza
(') and the pizza fairies
crack of a twig from somewhere
Did you take account of the heroin fairies who hang here at night
But there's nobody there
cool breeze blows
Naomi shivers
Arthur uses a remote to turn the log fire flames up
It's nice to keep it simple like this
'm sick of Michelin-star restaurants
All that embarrassing crap with the specials
Are you kidding
Where  normally eat, the special's the one that comes with a free toy
Arthur lifts a grill lid to turn over succulent steaks
48
(') You're rich rich, aren't you
get by
`It doesn't remotely matter how much or what you spend it on' rich
Arthur shrugs and swigs champagne, pouring more
(') Craziest thing you ever bought
once inadvertently financed a terrorist cell who said they needed 100,000 to open a falafel stall
She laughs
She stops laughing
Oh my -d, you're serious
What's the craziest thing you ever told a tour party
once said the Manhattan we were in was actually a movie set built for `You've got Mail', but that after the film wrapped, everyone moved to the set because there was less crime
sudden, very loud, very out-of-date ring tone
Naomi takes out a huge ancient Motorola phone
(') Yes, dad
There's a small Tiffany butter knife about two inches from his hand but it might take him eight months to dismember me with it
( ) Gotta go, battery
Love you too
She ends the call
49
(') Mom died last year
For eight months dad ate nothing but Popeye's Chicken n' Biscuits in front of So  persuaded him to move in with me
Where he eats Popeye's Chicken n' Biscuits in front of Sounds like you're very good to him
What are you gonna do
All those years your folks tucked you in, did their best to stop you from eating crap in front of the
And then one day, you're the one saying `No, honey, it's bad for you
Go to bed
' Weird, huh
(not relating at all) Yeah
hate that
(looks at her phone) Nice bit of kitsch
Where did you find that
& store in 1998
It's
You've had it twelve years
It's a fine phone
Battery life of eleven seconds, which cuts the crap right out of conversations
Something weird is happening
The world wobbles imperceptibly as the background drops away
She hasn't noticed yet

Vinyl's back in, out with the CDs

She looks around
And down
50
(') Cutting wide, we see that the picnic was taking place on a grass covered platform with a tree planted in it - which is being lifted off the ground by a crane
couldn't decide between picnic in the park and dinner with a view
So it's a picnic in the sky
Isn't it ace
The whole thing is rising higher and higher and higher
No it is not ace, you crazy English bastard
This is dangerous
Oh, sorry
Forgot
They said to put these on
He pulls back the blanket to reveal seat belts
He straps her in
(') () Naomi, it's okay
It's very safe
It's this company called `Aerial Delights'
They specialise in catering unusual events at a height of 180 feet above the ground
gust of wind blows the structure, which swings
Naomi screams
(') So what got you into the walking tours
You're seriously making date small talk while this is going on
Be still
Breathe deep

51
`Lower this freak show to the ground and get me a cab': Naomi Snart
(handing her something) Taste this truffle
Naomi tastes it
It's clearly delicious
She gazes around as the crane swings them out over the Hudson
The view of Manhattan, of the river, of the Statue of Liberty, is mind bogglingly gorgeous from up here
Naomi bursts out laughing
She sips champagne
What the hell
Gotta go sometime, right
At least it won't be years of pain like mom
Just a few seconds of screaming and falling with a truffle in my mouth
So anyway
The tours
( ) Okay, okay
Be deep
Breathe still
The tours are a temporary nine year fill-in until 'm drowned in a tsunami of apologies from everyone who failed to recognise my writing genius first time round
What did you write
kids' book
sent a chapter to a childrens' publisher
Sunshine Press'
The rejection letter was the meanest thing  ever read
Kids can be so cruel
() Arthur
We have a problem
52
told you, don't worry
These crane people know what they're doing
Not that kind of problem
Arthur feels a blade at his throat
He looks up to see ,  , standing over him
Phone
And the watch
Hurry
Arthur hands him his phone and watch
Um
Out of interest, how did you get up here
What you talkin' about, dog
We see a sleeping bag and needles behind the tree
Great
`Picnic in the sky' followed by `Robbed in the sky'
Arthur get the giggles as the junkie reaches into his pocket for his wallet
Naomi gets involuntary giggles too
(') This isn't funny, you lunatic
The junkie stuffs his face with food, swigs champagne from the bottle, then walks away
Phew
Then
The junkie's walking towards the edge, oblivious
Arthur jumps up, causing the platform to wobble scarily
He grabs the junkie's arm
The junkie swipes, cutting Arthur's hand
You don't understand
We're 180 feet up in the sky
() You on the same shit as me, yeah
Good stuff, right
53
No, we're not high
Well we are, but only in the literal sense
The junkie hurries away again
He's about to walk off the edge
Arthur runs and grabs him
They end up in a messy struggle, the platform rocking badly
(') ( ) Hit the panic button
It's next to the truffle station
Naomi's panicking, searching desperately
Arthur and the junkie roll over the posh food, right to the edge
(') Hurry
can't find it
Over here
No
That's the bouquet of world hams
Naomi finds the truffle station and hits the panic button
Down in a Crane Cab an alarm goes off
The driver starts to lower the platform
Naomi tries to help Arthur as he struggles with the junkie, but she gets slashed on the ear
She screams
As the platform lowers, it swings back over the river to the land and tips them all into the river
: '  - Naomi and Arthur - his face bruised - are sitting in the car, both dripping wet
Naomi's ear and Arthur's hand are bandaged
had fun tonight
She stares at him as if he's utterly crazy
can't believe 'm saying this, but so did
54
'  - The room has started to fill with groom's paraphernalia - morning suits, top hats, shoes
Erica is sitting with a huge sheaf of wedding admin and brochures
Vivienne, Burt and Susan listen attentively, studying seating plans
It all feels more like a council of war than a wedding preparation
Summarising Phase Alpha: formal wear for bridal attendants, groom's attendants, mens' formal wear, St John the Divine all confirmed

( ) Are there breathing holes in the coffin
'm sorry
In case 'm passed out drunk rather than medically dead
Don't worry, Thomas
This whole thing's just a joke to Arthur
Hobson brings Arthur a glass of water and two Nurofen
( ) Thanks, Hobnobs
You are good to me
Vivienne, irritated, hands Hobson a coffee cup
Take this away
( ) Progress on the reception
Black inked at the Emery Roth Room at the Ritz-Carlton
The screen lights up with a church graphic
55
(') first pass at the guest list
Bride's family and friends: 3-d layout of the church appears on a laptop
In the mock up, the bride's side of the aisle fills with hundreds of computerised guests, many labelled with famous names
(') Groom's family and friends: About a fifth of that number pop up on Arthur's side
(') We can arrange to screen off the area behind your guests, Arthur
To make it seem less desperate
Arthur groans and leans over a bowl
Sorry, everyone
that graphic's too colourful and this hangover's a 7
6 on the Richter
the Sickter
Arthur's sick
Erica lays out more sheets
Cakes, caterers, floral arrangements, photographer
Hobson reappears, wipes his mouth and takes the bowl
She stands with it accidentally-on-purpose, very close to Vivienne's nose
Will there be anything else, sir
No, thanks
( ) Ma'am
No
You can leave
Why all this crap now
What's the rush anyway
The wedding is in a month, Arthur
56
month
was thinking more sort of ten, fifteen years
Just to really enjoy the anticipation of the big day
Arthur gets up
Where are you going
(gets out his cellphone) Sorry, Dwight
Bridalshower, Operation Ball and Chain will have to wait
- Arthur is walking Naomi along the Hudson, this time in daylight
He stops
Here we are
We're not going to end up in the Hudson again, are we
can promise you won't get wet
: - The Hudson is bare of craft
until, suddenly, a bizarre mini submarine shaped like a dolphin, dives out of the water in an arc
Arthur and Naomi are laughing inside it - until they almost collide with a Circle Tour boat full of tourists
- Arthur and Naomi are hand in hand, walking along the street
He's a bit drunk, wobbly on his feet, a little morose
Are you okay
Yeah, fine
Actually
57
But Naomi sees something on the other side of the road
Arthur gets a a text from Hobson: ` her
' Hey, Richey Rich
Want to go somewhere really romantic
It's a big tacky shop: ' 99
99   - `'  '
The space is huge, garish and piled high with countless cheap household cleaners, candies, foodstuffs and toys
Arthur's fascinated, a tourist in austerity
Everything is 99 cents
Yip
whole penny less than those bourgeois assholes at the Dollar Store
Arthur reads a doll's label
`Warning: This product contains chromium, which may be linked to chronic bronchitis and reproductive hazards
" That one was on the news
Everyone else recalled them, the pussies
Not my 99 Cent
Arthur turns the doll over: a sticker reads `China'
Maybe China's trying to wipe out the west's children one by one
He gazes around in wonder
Oh,  love this place
Why
58
Well, 'd like you to believe it's because 'm a poor girl reduced to buying `Depressed Chef' burgers-in- a-can to Right Said Fred because don't know where my next paycheck is coming from
But the truth is - bargains get me hot
Got it from ma
Drives my dad crazy
The tour
Yes please
She takes his arm
Looking west, the ladies' hygiene products
Note that the more natural-sounding the name, e
g
this 'Vermont Breeze' Feminine Spray, the more lethal chemicals it contains
Watch out for the products cunningly labelled to make the dumber consumer think they're getting the real thing: 'Special ', 'Crampbell's Soup', ''Aunt Janina's' Maple-Style Syrup
Arthur holds a tin with a Coffee Mate-style logo, reading `Friend of Coffee'
The store music changes to  : `' ' (') And ah, the music: Dated sounds for lonely people to buy cheap shit to
They pass    who is going through a stack of identical tins of cheap beans
(') once watched a woman shoplift an 8-pack of toilet scrubbers down her panty hose to 'Everything  do, do it for you'
Arthur just stares at Naomi
(') Why are you staring at me
Just fascinated
59
You're good at fascinated
You're good at fascinating
The old woman has knocked over all the beans
(') Are you okay
Let me help you
He hands her a tin
Not that one
(offers her another) This one
(shaking the tin) No
There's less beans in it
This one
(sniffs the tin) No
This one
She stares and thinks
Arthur puts the tin to his ear
(') No
think  hear a mouse inside
Arthur shakes and sniffs another tin
(') Oh my -d
This is a good one
No rodents
Packed
He slips her a dollar and whispers to her
(') Quick, before someone gets it
Naomi gazes at a different Arthur to the fool who nearly got her killed
60
( ) You got a good one here, honey
She hurries away
Look
Us in a year's time
push a cart past
sneezes
The old man produces a tissue and gently wipes her nose
(') If you got ill, 'd care for you
'll get ill
The music changes
(') Oh, man, Phil Collins
Gotta get out when they start playing Phil Collins
Want to see how to get a quarter from a shopping cart
- Arthur, Susan and Erica - her laptop open - are at dinner
Hobson's salting Arthur's soup, then checking the temperature
Tiger Woods has confirmed
didn't know you knew him
don't
Why is he coming
He agreed to daddy's fee
This is going to be the happiest day of my life
She looks at Hobson
(') Why is she here all the time
61
If you can bring Erica,  can bring Hobson
She's my wedding planner
She's my Hobson
Hobson leans into Arthur while tidying his napkin
() Tell Naomi
That's an order
' Arthur's giving stunned Naomi a tour of the huge apartment
Reminiscent of a French castle perched 500 feet above New York, the penthouse was known from early days as the `Chateau in the Sky'
He leads her out onto a second rooftop ballroom
second ballroom
Obviously
Gotta have a second ballroom
Where George Gershwin and the Astors danced to Shep Fields and his Rippling Rhythm Orchestra
He grabs her in a ballroom dance move
(') Come on, cheap girl
We can be Fred Austere and Stingy Rogers
( ) just need one of your collection of bathrooms
Behind the telephone box fish tank
See you on the balcony
62
Arthur goes onto the balcony
Naomi's notices a figure sitting in the dark, stifling a cough
Hobson
Hobson
He's not like other men, you know
think  realised that as plunged into the Hudson with a junkie
But  like him
He's fun
Hobson fights another little cough
She gets up
know he is
That's the problem
What does that mean
'm sure Arthur will explain
- The live version of Simon and Garfunkel's `The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy') is playing on speakers
Arthur and Naomi look out over the view, the park, dark and empty in contrast to the cheering and clapping on the recording
Naomi sips her wine
Arthur throws back a whisky
Your kids' book
What was it about
`Vlad the Inhaler'
About an asthmatic boy detective
Be serious
Oh, it was dumb
`The Boy Whose Heart Escaped'
It was about this kid who wakes up to find his heart has climbed out and is shinning down the drainpipe to freedom
love it
63
Rainbow Press said it was too disturbing
But it wasn't literal - there wasn't a kid lying there with a gaping hole in his chest
It was just this cute little heart bouncing up and down shouting `You can't catch me, mofo
'
'm paraphrasing
Did he catch the heart
Never got that far
Arthur wobbles a little more
(') You like the hooch, don't you
Only if 'm sad, happy or bored
There's this bit in a book Hobson used to read me as a kid that says it all: `We must stop eating cookies, Frog
' cried Toad, as he ate another
' Frog and Toad
loved Frog and Toad
( ) `Frog put the cookies in a box
`There' he said
Now we will not eat any more cookies
' `But we can open the box
' Frog tied some string around the box
`There' he said, `Now we will not eat any more cookies'
`But we can cut the string and open the box'
Naomi lays her head on Arthur's shoulder
(') So Frog took the box outside
He shouted in a loud voice, `Hey birds, here are cookies
' Birds came from everywhere
They picked up all the cookies in their beaks and flew away
` () 64
(') Now we have no more cookies to eat' `Excellent
' said Toad, ` am going home now to bake a cake
' () Classic addict
They might be about to kiss
But Arthur holds back
That was beautiful
It's like you read it yesterday
'  -  - Arthur's blissed out face, lying in bed in the soft light
() Frog and Toad stayed on the island all afternoon
Hobson's reading `Frog and Toad' to Arthur
(') They ate wet sandwiches without iced tea
They were two close friends sitting alone together
Hobson closes the book and turns out the light
couldn't tell her, Hobson
She isn't the Komodo dragon
She's my toad
You're quite sure about this
Yes
(under her breath) Oh, bollocks
' Naomi's sitting with Ralph, who's scratching off lottery tickets
65
don't know, honey
What's this teabag even doing here
Couldn't he make it in Lord of the Rings land
Not that it matters, but he's a billionaire
You have my full permission to marry him
clears a showjumping barrier
Grant applauds
Bravo, Vivienne
Well done
Arthur's watching, sweating in the sunshine, while Marty and Hobson wait in the Bentley
'd be wary, Grant
She's planning to ride you around the course next
Her last boyfriend broke his ankle jumping that ditch
Had to be destroyed on the spot
Vivienne canters her horse up to them
Arthur
What's so urgent that you had to come all the way out here
'm in love
With a woman who isn't exactly who you'd describe as Susan
She's called Naomi
Arthur, we've been through this
Won't you at least meet her
What family is she from
The Snarts of Detroit
66
Never heard of them
No, because they're normal
She's a walking tour guide, her dad's a retired car worker
Susan will generate quality sons, not oil-soaked car monkeys
Unbelievable
Why don't you just keep me here, pay a servant to wank me into a bottle once a day
Arthur
then inject it all into a field of heiresses and see who farts out a thoroughbred first
We need an heir
Fine
You can have one with Stevey Steroids here
Surely even your uterus has had a face lift by now
Arthur storms away towards the car
( ) That's enough, Arthur
None of your business,  Crew
You are so ungrateful to your mother
She adores you
Arthur
Come back here
You can shove your inheritance up your horse's arse
67
Arthur jumps into the car and it pulls away
Vivienne sits shocked on her horse
But then she throws it into a gallop and catches up
Suit yourself, Arthur
Follow your heart
But do be aware  consider what you've squandered so far an advance on your inheritance
That's about $17 million
Why would you do that
You'd never get it back
No
But you'd spend the rest of your life in court
There's a simple solution to all this
Marry Susan
And cheat with the nobody from Queens
- Arthur's very drunk, maudlin, sitting opposite Naomi
He's holding his menu upside down
Have you been at the cookies
ate the whole jar
(realising it's serious) Oh, man
What
What
'm engaged
To another Susan
Woman
Engaged to another woman
She slams her menu down
(') 'm so sorry  didn't tell you
What are you talking about
This is bullshit
Who do you think you are
Is this some rich guy thing
was going to tell you
just
68
Naomi gets up and puts on her coat
Yeah, yeah, you just
Please, Naomi
didn't mean for it to get to this
planned to just be your friend but then  started to fall for you and  thought ` can't marry Susan,  might fall for Naomi
' But  thought `No  have to marry Susan or 'll be poor so won't fall for Naomi' But then did fall for you
Because you're brainy and funny and gorgeous and too smart to do walking tours
You're too smart, Snart
Smart Snart
There's a 99 cent cereal
() Anyway, so  went to see Vivienne, and  said ` can't marry Susan, love Naomi she's my Frog my Toad' don't know any more
You're frog
Thanks
Then she said `Noooo, if you don't marry Susan, 'll make you pay all the inheritance money back even if you can't - ha ha ha'
Okay she didn't laugh but she might as well have, the evil cow
Because it's like all the money ever and they'll put not just me but both of us in prison and your dad, like in Dickens
There'll be ghosts, and Oliver and
He stops, his mouth flapping like a fish
Maybe if 'd spotted this facet of your personality earlier we wouldn't be having this conversation
She heads towards the door
Arthur regains his lucidity for a moment
Toad
Stay a bit longer
Please
69
Why
'cause it'll reduce the proportion of my life 'll spend feeling utterly miserable
Naomi watches him take another big slug of wine
Bye, Arthur
Arthur looks confused
Bea Arthur
What's she got to do with all this
She shakes her head and goes
'  - Naomi's looking very sad, shaking - because she's comforting Ralph, who is sobbing on her shoulder
It's going to be okay
'll get you a beer, yeah
just have to be alone for a minute
Oh, -d,  can't bear it
- Arthur sits miserable, drinking, as he sits beside Susan at a Dane Cook gig
' Naomi's been crying
She's reading the screen of an ancient Apple Mac: `    ' by   Snart
She reads a paragraph - and smiles
This stuff isn't so bad
70
'  -  -
Arthur and Susan are getting a dance lesson from a , clicking her fingers to a club anthem version of the awful Jefferson Starship song
Arthur dances terribly
Hobson watches sadly
' Naomi's typing, getting back into it
'  -  - The tailor is positioning a top hat on Arthur's miserable head
He's shirtless and unshaven
' The sun is coming up over Queens
An ancient dot matrix printer spits out a final page
Naomi is at a desk with      and envelopes to various publishers
One is to `Rainbow Press'
- Naomi's pointing at the Chrysler Building for a particularly grumpy bunch of tourists of all types and ages
() Designed by William Van Allen and inspired by the machine age of the 1920s, the Chrysler
Hey
got a question
Please, interrupt
Hell, who wants to come home with me and butt in with questions while 'm watching Letterman
`Yo
How tall is Dave
' () Sorry, sir
Late night, no sleep, long day
What's your question
71
The opening bars of a familiar song start up somewhere, filling the street
Suddenly, some of the members of her tour group start lip syncing to Phil Collins
How can  just let you walk away, just let you leave without a trace
When  stand here taking every breath with you, ooh
2 You're the only one who really knew me at all
van with speakers on the top is parked nearby, pumping out the music
What is going on
How can you just walk away from me, when all  can do is watch you leave
'cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
Yellow Cab goes by, the driver lip-syncing out the window
(') You're the only one who really knew me at all
The song hits a hard club mix
Arthur bursts from the back of the van in a frog outfit
The `tourists' launch into a well- rehearsed dance
(lip syncing too) So take a look at me now, 'cause there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me, just the memory of your face
() 72
(') Take a look at me now, `cause there's just an empty space, And you coming back to me is against all odds and that's what 've got to face
Just take a look at me now
The song builds to a dance crescendo
magical moment
The crowd watches
How can she say no
Sorry to be a wet blanket, folks
he's getting married
But  guess he didn't choreograph that bit for you
But
but this took ages to rehearse
had the frog outfit specially made
These aren't actual tourists
gathered that, Arthur
Are you capable of doing anything without it being a grand gesture
What do you mean
It's like Hobson said
You're not like other men
If you were normal, if the money and the booze didn't cloud everything, you'd deal with the fact that you're engaged, rather than just looking for ways to win me back
But it was a lovely routine, really
Fantastic outfit
just wanted to see you
He takes out his flask and has a swig
() You need to see someone, Arthur
Seriously
73
'
- Arthur's in his cuboid David Blaine shower
He picks up his binoculars
Hobson
Female Tom Hanks has had a haircut
Hobson
But Marty pipes up on the little inset Hobson screen
He looks at a note in Hobson's handwriting
It says here you shouldn't forget to clean your junk
guess that's what
'genitahlio-ah' is
Marty
What are you doing there
Hobson left me in charge
She's gone to bed
She had a headache
She's had quite a few headaches lately
She blacked out
' Hobson's in bed, watching a Discovery Channel documentary about grizzly bears
Arthur hits pause
Put my bears back on, Arthur
Not until you answer my question
Hobson closes her eyes
She hams the next bit
'm travelling down a white tunnel
To - a garden
Mother
Father
Why is it so hot
Who's the red gentleman with the big pitchfork
Will you cut it out
74
Arthur
There are three books
This is important
Take them back to the library
She feigns a melodramatic death
Hobson, please
Don't die any more
It's getting very boring
Arthur
Old women, like bears, get sore heads
Are you okay
You look a little lost
Naomi doesn't want to see me
terrible shame she had to go little tart like that could have saved you a fortune in prostitutes
Listen, old woman
Don't ever talk about Naomi that way again
What gives you the right to be such a snob
You're just
you're just
Mary Poppins with a menopause
Arthur storms out, slamming the door
But within 10 seconds he returns, humbled, ashamed - a regretful naughty child
(') Hobson, 've never raised my voice to you
'm sorry
'm sorry too
You know, Arthur, you may be growing up
Do you want anything
want to be younger
Sorry, it's your job to be older
() Hobson
If you're feeling better tomorrow, will you accompany me somewhere
75
She pats his hand gently
Of course, Arthur
- Marty and Hobson are staring, bemused
(
) How do  look
Arthur's wearing a huge, ludicrous wig and beard
Hobson and Marty fight giggles
(') can't have this getting out
'm in the public eye
Yes, it would be disastrous to harm such a dignified profile
He looks, scared, at the building
(') It's going to be okay, Arthur
- are sitting in a circle
, a respectable- looking, smart woman, is speaking
was waking up four, five, six mornings a week in different mens' beds
Arthur (in his ludicrous disguise), Hobson and Marty enter
(') wanted to die
To be nobody
-  - man, , speaks emotionally
steal from my friends, my family
sold my son's pedal car so could score junk
76
Arthur - utterly depressed - has his head in his hands
Jesus
accidentally backed my car over my mother outside Walgreens
Marty chuckles
He tries to fist-bump James
() Marty
This isn't a sports bar in Chicago
These people aren't here to brag
() had a business, a home and it's all gone
'm in this fucking grave and they're pouring the earth in
Whoooaaahh
Okay, cut
don't know about anyone else, but this isn't exactly killing my thirst
Well why did you come
What's your name
Gandalf
Arthur thinks
Seriousness - his least favourite thing - is upon him
He takes a deep breath
But - (') 'm sorry, you're not going to convince me my life isn't fun
( ) And no offence but if  ran over my mother, 'd be out celebrating
Which is what  plan to do right now
Come on, Hobson
Marty
Arthur leaves, the door swinging behind him
(
) 'm Jane
And  believe  have a dependence on alcohol
The woman confessing is Hobson - on Arthur's behalf
77
and because  have done nothing with the astonishing opportunities handed to me, apart from pissing away my inheritance and drinking enough to kill a rhino
Arthur, having heard, comes back in
(') But imagine being me
once ended up in bed with the daughters of three of the Rolling Stones
But a) don't remember a thing about it, b) apparently  was sick on two of the women before c) losing control of my bladder on the third
All such fun
until the strangers pay to be my friends have gone, the fog parts and there's a hole so big, you could pour all the champagne in the world into it and never fill it up
But 've got so much potential, a good heart, 'm a good person, even if 've completely wasted my short, precious life because  somehow convinced myself that happiness is a Komodo dragon, a case of booze and the memory of having once stripped naked to Beethoven for a coachload of German tourists who met outside the Rainforest Cafe
She's done
An awkward silence
It's always the quiet ones
- The car drives through Manhattan
- Arthur stares out of the window, beaten, drunk
Thanks, Hobson
Maybe you can go every time  crave a drink
78
Hobson doesn't even crack a smile
Arthur gets out his phone and scrolls - past Naomi's name, to Susan's
He dials
(') Susan
Look,  know the wedding date is set
But fancy bringing it forward
just want to get it over with
In a good way
Think about it, yeah
He ends the call
Silence
He looks to Hobson
(') It's the agony of possibility, Hobson
It just hurts too much to know  could still be with Naomi if had the guts
Just promise you'll never ask me to sleep with Susan for you
- Naomi's riding the bus
Her phone rings
`Number withheld'
She rolls her eyes and answers
Arthur, if that's
() Hello
Yes
Yes,  did
Yes
Sorry
Really
Well  worked pretty hard on it
Love to
Love to
What time
Incredibly excited, she grabs a pen and writes on a walking tours brochure: `
' (') 'll call in dead to work
Bye
She writes ` 11
30' and an address
'  - There's a ring at the doorbell
Ralph answers
It's Hobson
Good afternoon, Mr Snart
Is Naomi here
79
You must be the nanny
must be
Ralph embraces her
(') Please stop this,  can't inhale and am in danger of treading on one of your knuckles
Ralph releases her
(') If you and your undershirt would walk two paces back  could enter this dwelling
Naomi appears, looking more of a writer than a tour guide
Well, well
Ever since  met Arthur  liked him
We have to make sure these two wonderful kids stay together
Try not to talk
It's not your words but the breath which bears them
Perhaps you could repair to the East Wing and make me a cup of tea
wish to speak to Naomi
Sure, sure
Ralph leaves
Arthur is having a pre-wedding party tonight
You should come
Oh, should
Are all the other girls he passed up going too
Hobson picks up a letter from Rainbow Press and peruses it
80
Don't you want to show Arthur how well you're doing
Tell him thanks, but  have a deadline
Arthur doesn't know 'm here
He's far too decent to be involved in something so tawdry
You could bring your father
magical experience before he's too big to leave this apartment
() Why would  go to this
Why would do that to myself
My dear, if there's one thing old women can tell, it's young men in love
And the food promises to be breathtakingly free
Hobson has a slight dizzy spell and sits down
Are you alright
Better than you, dear
You really look out for Arthur, don't you
Yes
And it is a job that recommend highly
Ralph comes back and with a cup of disgusting-looking tea
(') You really look out for this gentleman, from what 've heard
Ah, what am  gonna do
The no-kill pet shelter won't take him
Ralph hands Hobson the cup of tea
81
Thank you
Would you go the bathroom and commence washing
You only have three hours and it could be quite a project
Ralph goes
Naomi takes the tea
appreciate what you're trying to do but 'm not going to that party
Suit yourself
Hobson gets up, still dizzy
Have you seen a doctor
Yes
And he has seen me
think Arthur has a very good friend
May  kiss you on the cheek
Is it something you feel strongly about
Yes
But Hobson falls back into her chair heavily, looking sicker

Thanks
We're going to move things up tempo now with `The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me Is You

Partygoers hit the dance floor
Vivienne, Susan, Burt and Erica pass a huge ice statue of Susan and Arthur in a loving embrace and amazing catering
Splendid affair, Susan
Don't thank me, thank Erica
Erica shrugs modestly
Arthur appears
Burt puts a big burly arm around him and squeezes him a little too hard
Naomi climbs out of a crappy cab
She's on her phone
With all due respect, Hobson, you're talking out of your frumpy English ass
Arthur needs to know
-  - Hobson's in bed looking ill
Ralph's fussing over her pillow
Hobson slaps him away
You are not to pull him out of that party on my behalf
() Hello
Naomi
But Naomi's gone
Ralph tries to plump the pillow again
You're gonna get through this, babe
Then who knows what the future may hold
-  - Naomi hurries past    with a clipboard
Excuse me, madam
Name
Madam
83
Naomi grabs the arm of
Snart plus one
She hurries in with the bemused, but delighted man
The checks his clipboard
- Naomi enters the party, releasing the man, who's disappointed to see her go
She looks around for Arthur, getting admiring looks from other men - and women
Nice dress
Vera Wang
Ross Dress For Less
You know where Arthur is
() Sorry
Naomi moves on
The Door Man appears, looking around for the gatecrasher
The man whose arm she took on the way in - he's called  - is also on the prowl for her
- Burt takes to the stage to applause
When Arthur proposed to my daughter,  was overjoyous
The Bach-Templemeads are my kind of people: classy
Respectable
Well spoken
People like in Shakespeare in Love, who esprouse the same values  have always upheld both in my business and spiritual life
But tonight isn't about me or America's leading independent formula brand
Arthur takes the stage to wild applause
Thank you, Burt
've actually prepared a little surprise song with my friends here
84
The band starts playing `Close To You' by the Carpenters
Arthur sings to Susan, down in the crowd
(') Why does cash suddenly appear, every time you are near
The audience laugh
(') Just like me, it longs to be, close to Sue
Why do cars fall out of the sky, all of which,  can buy
() 'll sing a proper song
() You say potayto and  say potahto, You say tomayto and  say tomahto, potayto, potahto, tomayto, tomahto, Let's call the whole thing off
You say , and  say `no way', you say `Red Bull' and  say `Go away, Rehab, No way, Red Bull
- approaches Naomi, who's still looking around for Arthur
We meet again
Yeah
Have you seen Arthur
The ballroom
'll take you to him
Justin takes Naomi's arm and leads her at a leisurely pace
They pass a portrait of Susan
(') 'm so happy for Arthur and Susan
Justin points at a portrait of Susan
(') Isn't she beautiful
Of course she is
Why would Arthur marry a pig
85
The Door Man appears, seeing Naomi
What business is your family in
Hm
Oh, 'm the heiress to a fortune built on small pets
'm sorry
Hamsters, mice, doglets
Doglets
Tiny dogs
The technology's not perfect
Seeing a horse the size of a can of soup fall dead before your eyes - that shit stays with you
They walk through a door, ending up in a garden
- Are you sure he's this way
Absolutely
Naomi turns to
(to a ) Excuse me
Have you seen Arthur
That way
The ballroom
Bye, Justin
Naomi hurries away - running straight into the Door Man
Excuse me, madam
You're not an authorized guest
86
know that
'm here to give Arthur some very important news
Of course you are
(takes her arm) Shall we discuss this outside
() Get your hands off me
They tussle
Arthur intercedes
It's okay, Jeff
She can stay
Arthur, can  talk to you
-  - is on the phone beside Hobson's bed
We ran tests
It was just a dizzy spell
We'll be sending her home tonight
But what about the other blackouts
Hobson snatches the phone from the Man in a White Coat
Arthur, 'm fine
Do not leave that party
-   - Arthur's on the phone, coat on, in a big empty panelled room
(
, ) Especially now that Naomi is there
The call ends
Arthur looks across at Naomi, at the other end of the room, looking so beautiful
She's fine
They're sending her home
Do you want a drink
87
No, thanks, Arthur
should go
But you came all this way
There's ridiculously fancy food, there's
Arthur
Please
Can you just call me a cab
You're a cab
No laughter this time
It's not funny
He takes out his iPhone again
Stares at it
(') Shit
Hobson usually
Orders cabs to take the girls away
Arthur's busted
He scrolls the phone for a cab number
Thank you for coming all this way
'm sorry for all the stupid presents and calls and gestures
It's okay
Naomi looks up at a portrait of Burt and young, prissy, but beautiful Susan
(') She was a looker from the get-go
What were you like as a kid
Nuts
thought the moon followed me
would walk and think the moon went any place that  did thought it meant something special would happen
So 've been waiting
What an ass
Arthur sees a sound system
He goes over and plugs his iPhone into it, then takes Naomi in his arms
88
Dance
Arthur
We've been through this
Call that cab please
Arthur looks down into her eyes and hits `' on his iPhone
Music starts: it's not a slow, smoochy song but big, brassy and upbeat
: `  ' Arthur ballroom dances Naomi at speed around the room
To Bombay, a travelling circus came, they brought an intelligent elephant and Nellie was her name
() What the bejeezus is this
Hobson used to sing it to me
( ) One dark night, she slipped her iron chain
Off she ran to Hindustan and was never seen again
Nellie the Elephant packed her bags, And said goodbye to the circus, Off she went with a trumpety trump, Trump trump trump
It's energetic, wonderful, as romantic as any slow dance
They stop dancing
Arthur stares at Naomi
At last, they kiss
But the music stops
It's Vivienne
Is this the tour guide
She's a writer
Is this the Vivienne
Crowded field, writing
89
Maybe someone will see her potential
We all know who's seen her potential
Meaning
Oh, of course, you don't know, do you
Arthur suddenly goes pale
Vivienne, please
Don't
What is going on here
My son became fond of you
You're not the first
Or the last, imagine
Anyway  was scanning his monthly expenses - which always makes for entertaining reading, all those gifts for all those girls - and found he'd bought an entire publishing company called
what was it now
Rainbow Press
You bought Rainbow press
So you could tell them to publish my book
He knows people, dear
'm sure you do too, though the people you know tend not to own books, let alone publishers
Arthur,  trust we'll see you back at the party
Susan's a little worried
Vivienne leaves
Naomi storms away
Arthur chases
didn't think would ever see you again
was just trying to give you some
90
() Confidence
Self esteem isn't a gift, Arthur
It isn't a fur coat or a thousand billion orchids or an apartment made from truffles or whatever else you rich freaks use to express love
Arthur looks incredibly hurt
do express love
love you
Don't say that
You just told me to
And stop going on about me being rich
You think it's easy being trapped by money
Naomi gets her old phone out
She speaks into it
Hello, Amnesty
Come quick
Arthur's being held against his will in Guantamoney Bay
Abu Greed
Stop riffing with me
How dare you do what you did
didn't need your money to feel good about myself
No
Being cheap gives you that
Huh
At least 'm prepared to have fun
To live
'm not all `Oooh look at me with my antique food, aren't cool
' And
and
your phone's It's made of bits of old doorbell and vibrator,  bet you can only get calls from 1994 on it
91
( ) As long as  don't get any from a drunk, rich fuck up like you
door opens
Hello
heard shouting
'm an employee of Arthur's
came to complain about the conditions
Naomi, please
Mr Bach-Templemead,  know you thought putting half and half in the staff kitchen was an improvement
( ) But some people prefer Coffee Mate
You were disrespectful
quit
Naomi walks away, slamming a door behind her
Because you changed the creamer
() Arthur, Marty called from the hospital
It's okay, Hobson's fine
spoke to her doctor
Apparently you didn't
- Hobson is lying in bed, looking even iller than before
It's just a headache
Stop saying that
You bribed a hospital orderly to tell me you were okay
92
Oh, bothersnaps
What do doctors know
The door opens
Marty enters with a shopping cart
Da dahhhh
give you the amazing costly, health-giving presents
Arthur starts to produce gifts for Hobson: jewellery, expensive bath products, perfumes, clothes, a

( ) How much did you waste on this poppycock
Arthur and Marty laugh
(') ( ) see you've decided not to grow up after all
She sounds like Darth Invader
Finally, Arthur unwraps a very high-end  player and
Why, Arthur

He stumbles on a document
It reads: `    ' ' He opens it
How did this get here
have no idea
You might have a brain tumour but you're not a complete veggie burger just yet
Has Naomi been here

She dropped by once or twice
Frightful needy trollop

Arthur's reading the manuscript, bearing Hobson's notations: `Shorten', `Wonderful - do  cut
', `Beautiful

Just trying to spare her outright humiliation while 'm still here
Don't wear yourself out
You're not going anywhere soon
He taps the top of a state-of-the-art heart monitor
(') World's most advanced heart rate monitor
The tiniest problem will alert your own private platoon of paramedics camped out downstairs
Hobson takes Arthur's hand
Arthur
've loved caring for you so much
But you'll never grow up with me around
So either  retire
Or  die
Option 1 involves too much paperwork and blather with having to find somewhere else to live
And no offence to you, dear boy
She glances at a      DVDs beside '
(') but  think we've exhausted the bear-based entertainment
Which leaves option 2
Arthur can't fight the tears any more
(') You're a good son, Arthur
You can do anything with your life that you want
Just like  did
95
But you spent half of it looking after a spoilt drunk twat
Exactly
Sorry Arthur
'm past my use-by date
Sorry, Hobson, You don't win this one
need you to care for me
(holds up a pill) Now take your fish oil
'  - Arthur, in a chair at the end of the bed, wakes with a start from a dream
He looks across to Hobson, who is very still
Hobson
The expensive monitor is dead
He jumps up
(') (hammering the machine) Why the fuck has the stupid thing not gone off
() '
He sees that the monitor is unplugged
The cord is in Hobson's hand
It's over
Hobson's dead
Arthur sobs his heart out
'  - It's a few weeks later
The place is very, very messy
The place also seems to be heavily splattered with all colors of paint
big lump of red paint thuds into Hobson's giant teddy bear, which is already heavily spattered
Arthur's sitting naked, apart from a helmet, in his tiny army paintball tank
He's in a blank, drunken daze, firing paint at the teddy
The tank turret rotates
He shoots walls, possessions, furniture
He stops
96
Would Frog ever get up again
Or would he just sit in his tank, crying and soiling himself until he died of dehydration because he didn't even have the energy to eat a wet sandwich
He looks down at an ashes urn
(') Hobson
Why are you in there when need you
(lifts lid off urn) He's rewarded with a face full of ashes
Angrily he spins the turret through 360 degrees, firing paint
(') Arrrrgghhh
Marty comes in - and is hit hard by paint
(') Sorry
How's the tea
Shockingly bad, thanks, Marty
Want to talk about the Cubs game
Nahhh
Can  be alone please
Marty goes
Arthur picks up his phone and scrolls down to Naomi's name
He thinks for a moment, hits `call'

- Naomi is shopping
She looks at the phone, sees Arthur's name
She so wants to answer
But doesn't

He peers down at Manhattan far, far below

huge crash from off

Tilt up to find Hobson's  teddy  lying on the roof

- Arthur's on his phone again
(leaving a message) Naomi
doubt you'll ever get this, because your voicemail probably consists of a 4000 year old woman who writes the message down in hieroglyphics then loses it down the back of her incontinence loin cloth
Hobson died
Hobson died and 've fallen apart
The doorbell rings from off
(') Marty
Can you get that
Marty
( ) Naomi
Could you get it
Hello
He throws the cellphone off the roof
couple of seconds pass
We hear a very faint howl of pain from whoever it hit
- Arthur opens the door
It's Vivienne
Arthur
You haven't answered the phone for eight days
Susan's beside herself
What's going on
98
What do you think's going on
Hobson died
Oh, that
She bustles in past Arthur
follows
(') ( ) Chop chop
You cleany penthouseio
Come on, Arthur
Have to pick yourself up, lad
It's like when Nixon my Great Dane had to be put down
Frightful state for days
But pulled myself together
You're comparing Hobson to
a dog
Well, yes
faithful, humble companion who
Um,  think 'd like you to leave, if that's okay
Now
Remember who pays for this apartment, Arthur
For everything
He guides her out the door
(') You had damn well better be at that wedding, boy
Don't worry
If 'm going to drink myself to death 'll need resources
Bye Vivienne
It's mother
My mother's dead
He slams the door
The phone rings again
(') Hello
'm sorry

'  - Arthur is sitting in an estate attorney's next to  , a small, dirty man
is at a desk opposite them, reading from a will
The last will and testament of Jane Hobson
() ` leave my life savings to the Tulare Bear Sanctuary, Tulare County, California
' Aherne hands Mr Finke   for $8,864
That'll explain the strong smell of bear shit
Sorry
Aherne opens a tiny envelope
To Arthur Bach Templemead,  leave this
She produces a teabag
(') To operate kettle, press red button
Milk in refrigerator; that's the big box with the pretty light that comes on when you open the door
() Arthur
You're going to be okay
Now it's your turn to look after someone
All my deepest, fondest love, my dearest boy

And a drop of vodka

just want you to know, if he doesn't show up for this wedding, can't know what 'll do
Don't worry, Burt
He's cleaned himself up
He's stopped drinking, he's anxious to get a real job
He's become a responsible citizen
- Arthur is stalking - drunk but determined - through the crowds
He comes upon a group of tourists standing by a tour bus
Naomi's now wearing a headset mic, pointing south
Due to a tragic error in the architect's drawing, the original Statue of Liberty unveiled in 1886 was just seven inches tall
100,000 New Yorkers rioted, having come expecting to see something more impressive than a garden gnome holding up an ice cream
Naomi
Arthur pushes his way through the tourists
He sees her bus and headset
(') You're on a bus
With a microphone
Girl's gotta have a dream
Naomi
Can you take the next 60 years off
Are you okay
You're a mess
You look like you
now
Sorry
accidentally swallowed three bottles of hand sanitizer
Fascinating story
Okay
() 101
(') Drinking was the only way  could get the courage to come here and say this:  don't need the money love the money
But  don't lie awake all night wondering how 'll live without ever seeing it again
just wonder what it's like to go 24 hours without a steak tartare
Naomi looks unconvinced
Arthur pulls out his wallet and takes out a load of credit cards
(') The American Express Centurion card - you have to spend at least $250,000 a year to keep it, which blow in a quiet week
He drops it down a drain
He produces another card
(') Sotheby's `World Elite' Mastercard for art collectors
Drops it down drain too
The tourists are enjoying this

This last one he hands to a

Arthur flings it in the air
crazed fight breaks out
Arthur stands before Naomi in just his underpants and socks
(') These are from The Gap
'm so sorry about Hobson
They step away from the tourists
'm sorry about the Rainbow Press
It's okay
So how did Susan take it that you're not marrying her
She didn't
You haven't told her
What's it to you
She's your arch- enemy
Are you six
She isn't my enemy
She's the woman you proposed to
couldn't tell her
Today's the biggest day of her life
The wedding's today
When

Which is

Better hurry

No

Naomi starts herding her tourists onto her bus
'mon, folks
Naomi
Susan's dad will

Then we'll talk

Ah shit

John the Divine please
About 15 bucks

Every timepiece reads 11:54

He looks around for Arthur then scowls very scarily
- Arthur stops, out of breath
He sees That gives him an idea
() Gather round for the nearly naked Yoga man -

Arthur strikes a sequence of silly poses and names

Arthur jumps out and starts running again
He sees   with ` ' in its window
We cut to people cheering Arthur, hanging on the bus's front bicycle rack
But the  sees him and hits the brakes
Arthur's flung forwards but gets up and keeps running
He sees a Subway Station
( ) Excuse me, are there trains down there, like in films
Yes
Arthur runs down the steps
- train pulls on to the platform
Arthur leaps aboard
- Arthur stands among New Yorkers, none of whom bat an eyelid at his appearance
He looks up at the stations
(to   ) Excuse me
Terribly sorry to bother you, but
Without looking at him, the guy hands him a dollar
(') Crikey
Thanks

-  - Susan is ready
She looks to the door
Erica, who is peering out, shakes her head with an ` told you so' look
'   - Naomi's driving her bus up 42nd Street
(into a headset mic) originally a rough neighbourhood
Some say it was called 42nd Street because it wasn't safe to spend more than forty seconds on it
few grudging laughs from the tourists
Excuse me
If you burst into song, you're off this bus
Huh
want to see St
John the Divine
Sorry, sir, that's not on our route today
Anyway
want to know if Arthur's gonna make it
(') You should be there for him
Other tourists agree

Okay
Arthur comes bounding out of another station
Clutching his dollar, he sees a bus
He runs aboard, and up to the driver
Ah
'm trying to get to
Arthur feels eyes on him
The bus is full of
It's a school bus
They all stare for a beat, then get out cellphones to report the weirdo in their midst, who runs off again and up Broadway, passing a store's line of shopping carts
He starts emptying them of quarters
Hey
police car rounds the corner
( ) Uh, unit 6J, we have reports of an indecent exposure on a school bus
Arthur jumps in a shopping cart; as the truck passes, he launches forward, grabbing the rear fender
- Burt gets up, squeezing past
- Arthur's cab pulls up outside the church, surrounded by Arthur leaps out and fights his way through the crowd
People start to recognise the crazed, sweating panting weirdo in underwear
Paparazzi and pedestrians photograph and film him
He runs into the church
-  - The church is packed with  , ,
Vivienne sits waiting
Arthur stumbles in at the back
109
- Arthur's trying to inch along the back
But the congregation falls silent, watching him
He stumbles up the aisle, looking up to Jesus, in similar scantily-clad appearance, on a cross
'm not him
(shows his wrists) Look ma
No holes
Arthur slips in a side door
- Susan is sitting, sad, Bridesmaids comforting her
(
) Susan
Susan turns and is shocked to see Arthur
Arthur
What's going on
Susan
can't
can't
He leads her away from the bridesmaids
What
The girl at the party
The one who talked all that rubbish about Coffee Mate
love her
Susan slaps Arthur
Hard
Shut up
We're getting married
But  don't love you
And you think  love you
Well, yes
What's not to
110
never have
Susan, you're upset, you hate me
It's okay
Now 'm sorry,  have to go, or your dad's going to do whatever he did to your boyfriend from college
Daddy never hurt Alex
He paid her parents to send her away
You're
a
Lesbian
Yes
You may have noticed that daddy is homophobic
He swore he'd disown me if it happened again
But
why do you want to marry
Arthur glances across, sees Erica skulking
(') Hang on
Am  your beard
Why else do you think 'd spend more than 30 seconds in your company
You're the perfect cover
() Have you been pretending to like Dane Cook as well
No
Wow
Wow
Well
Uh
(heads to the door) Thanks for your honesty
don't feel so bad about calling this off
Erica steps in his way
111
Arthur, please
You can drink as much as you like, sneak off to Naomi
We keep the money
We live our lives
Everyone wins
may be a weak, pathetic drunk
But  won't marry a lesbian Dane Cook fan
Arthur pushes past Erica
- Arthur stumbles out on the altar
The  stares
He taps a mic from the pulpit like a stand up
Good evening, St
John the Divine
Anyone in from St
Patrick's
Bialystoker Synagogue
Manhattan Mosque
- Naomi's tour bus screeches up
She hurries out
- Arthur's still before the congregation, telling a story
and the first turned to the second horse and said `That dog just spoke'
The hateful silence that only 500 angry rich people can muster
(') The joke being that it's inconsistent that the horses can speak but the dog can't
Naomi creeps in at the back
(') The wedding's off
The bride has had second thoughts
can't say blame her
Would you marry me
() 112
(') () You won't be seeing me again, as 'm going to be poor
'll be shopping at the 99 Cent Store
Six pork chops for under a dollar
discreetly scribbles `99c Store, chops' on a torn- out Bible page
(') Great
'm glad we had this talk
'll let you get on with the wedding
huge crucifix strikes Arthur hard
Burt, crazed with hatred, drags him by his hair off the altar
- Burt is bashing Arthur's head  against a stone font
Daddy, no
Stop it
Vivienne bursts in
Followed by Naomi
Burt
Get off my son
But nothing's going to stop Burt
(louder than anyone yet) Susan is over Burt, brandishing a Virgin Mary statue
You wouldn't hurt me
Wouldn't
You crushed me
just wanted you to be happy
Bullshit
You wanted to stop me being a lesbian
Shut up
Shut up you dirty little dyke harlot
113
Erica leaps on Burt, pummelling his face with her fists
You want some more, bitch
Huh
Arthur looks up at Susan
Erica, that's enough, honey
Erica stops
Susan kisses her
Why didn't you tell me
We could have worked something out
Naomi give Arthur a look
(') 'm joking
- The church is empty, apart from Arthur and Naomi on the altar
Naomi's trying to remove something from Arthur's neck
Vivienne is sitting alone in a pew near the back
Stop it
Why are you doing that
Because  hate an infection
Keep still
No, you keep still
He kisses Naomi passionately
What are we going to do, Arthur
'll get a job
'll model cheap riding boots for people with no horses
You can write books about boys whose lungs have run away
Stop this
Vivienne walks up to the altar
114
(') Bach-Templemead has never been poor and we're not about to try that experiment with you, Arthur
That said, you've shown strength of character for once, instead of blubbing on about frogs and friendship
The inheritance is yours
All  ask is, with Hobson gone, you finally start treating me like a mother
Sorry, Vivienne
can't do that
beg your pardon
You've never earned that title wouldn't fake it with Susan won't with you
Arthur
will withdraw this offer forever
Don't doubt me, boy
don't
Arthur shakes Vivienne's hand
(') Take care, Viv
Arthur takes Naomi by the hand and they leave the church
Arthur
Arthur
am serious
If you walk out of that door
They're gone
Vivienne sits in a pew
For once she looks small, old, alone
- Arthur and Naomi step into the daylight, pushing past paparazzi and press
Marty is waiting in the Batmobile, now repaired
115
Sorry, Marty
This isn't mine any more
Fancy joining us for a bowl of Special
Marty gets out
The three walk away up Amsterdam Avenue

) '  - Naomi's typing, sipping `Sprike' (fake Sprite)
Beside her is a printed manuscript titled `'    -  Bogus guide to the World's Greatest City
' On the computer screen is: `
the 1765 Irish Hair Famine swept through Manhattan, rendering every resident bald for a week
' (
) This is outrageous
'
-  - Arthur's struggling with a very crap, piddly shower
Rather than the glory of Manhattan from his shower-in-the-sky, Arthur just has a bare wall opposite to look out on
Operational heat controls in a shower are a basic human right
hole in a pipe sprays his groin with hot water
He screams
'
-  - Ralph and Marty sit watching sports, Marty cheering as the Yankees are losing, Ralph miserable, The doorbell rings
' Ralph stands hammering at the bathroom door, holding a package
116
(
) Owww
My eyes
'm blind
Ralph hammers again
The bathroom door opens
Arthur's holding a giant bottle of cheap shampoo
His eyes are bright red, streaming
(') What the hell's in this shampoo
Napalm
It sure as hell isn't tea tree oil
Ralph hands him the package
Package for you
With any luck an apartment for you and Lurch
thought you liked me
may have been seduced by money
It happens
'
-  - Naomi appears from the bedroom
She finds Arthur staring at a framed photo of Hobson as a beautiful young woman holding Arthur as a happy, laughing toddler
note is attached
(reading it out) `Can  be your friend at least
Love, Vivienne xxx
Lunch sometime
The inheritance is yours
It always was
' Arthur looks at Naomi, at Ralph, at Marty
On balance, 'd go for it
Money good
They look at Naomi
You were never happy rich, honey
It's only been a month
Be strong
Remember: however hard life gets, love will always find a way
() 117
(') (off their stares:) What
Can't a girl make a joke
- Arthur steps out of a Bentley
- Arthur enters the  meeting, clutching Hobson's ashes
Brought her for moral support
But 'll do the talking this time
