Cal pulls out  , looks at the menu
Well, 'm full
You were right, hon

() Want to just share a dessert
Tracy is lost in thought, gazing at a menu
You okay, babe
You seem out of it
Yeah, 'm just thinking about what want
Me too

Jessica's skinny, wears glasses, a hipster -shirt
In five years, she's going to make all the boys' heads spin
But not yet

2 : 2 'm gonna getcha
'm gonna getcha
She grabs Molly and tickles her
Molly  with delight
As she kicks
picture falls off the nearby console
Jessica picks it up: Cal and Tracy
This is their house
It's okay, my fault
() Alright, kiddo, it's getting late, let's get you to bed before your parents get home
Don't give me the puppy eyes, you little maniac
Go brush your teeth

Once Molly's gone, Jessica looks at the photo
She eyes Cal affectionately

Her best friend,  (29),
Seriously
Conan 'Brien
You'd do Conan 'Brien
'm just saying, Richard's a lot of things: successful, smart
Boring, workaholic, sexually repressed

3 : 3 But he's not very funny, that's all
Yeah, well, you want funny, go watch `Cosby' reruns
You want a good lay, go get yourself some of
that
She motions off to the side
What
The hot piece that's been checking you out for the last hour
, revealing:   (32)
The smoothest, coolest son-of-a-bitch you've ever seen
He tilts his glass at them, toasting

"to- go" box from the French restaurant in his lap
Tracy drives
Aren't you going to say anything
Nothing
Almost twenty-five years of marriage, you have nothing to say
She looks at him
He turns to her, about to say something, then
stops himself
Turns back forward
It's silent
Devastating

'  5 Meanwhile, Jessica (the baby-sitter) stops at a bedroom door
She hears  coming from inside, puts her ear to the door
It's Lady Gaga
It's awful
She smiles, knocks and opens the door at the same time

5 : 5 Hey, your sister's asleep, just checking you're alive -- She  as -- (13), quickly covers himself up
He was masturbating
Close the door
who slams the door shut
( ) 'm sorry, Robbie
didn't see anything,  swear
Robbie lies there frozen, horrified

6 Meanwhile, where Liz and Hannah keep drinking
don't know, Hannah
Your life is just so
-13
Hannah's mouth drops open
My life is not -13
It so is
You've never left
You pass the bar you're gonna be, what, a patent lawyer, probably married to that snooze-fest Richard
just worry about you is all
Hell, you've resorted to fantasizing about Conan `Ginger- Dick' 'Brien
() 5
6 : 6 () He's funny
He looks like a carrot, honey
Hannah
(
) Who
They turn
It's Jacob Palmer (the stud from earlier)
Hi
Hi
Who looks like a carrot
Conan 'Brien
My friend Hannah thinks he's sexy
think your friend Hannah is sexy
Hannah
You didn't really just say that
Pretty sure  did
How old are you
Thirty-three next month
Then you should know by now that cheesy pick-up lines don't work
Jacob sits down at their table, uninvited
find you incredibly sexy
It's a fact, not a cheesy pick-up line
() () 6
6 : (2) 6 (') There are many attractive women in this bar -- including your friend here -- and 've been unable to take my eyes off you, only you, for the past two hours
Again: not a cheesy pick-up line, just a fact
() Answer this quickly, without thinking about your answer: do you find me attractive
Hannah doesn't flinch
don't
Yes you do
Yes, she does
'm an accomplished lover
If you come home with me,  am confident you will leave satisfied
Multiple times
You've got to be kiddi-- We'll make love and it will be amazing
You'll laugh afterwards and say ` never do this kind of thing
' Then you'll do it again
Is that so
It is
So now 'm going to ask if can buy you another drink
If you say yes, we'll have one more cocktail each -- just enough to start losing inhibitions, not enough to get sloppy, after all: promised to satisfy you
Multiple times
() 7
6 : (3) 6 That's right
So, here we go, Hannah: can  buy you a drink
Hannah and Liz share a look
What do you expect me to say to that
Margarita, rocks, salt
Wow
She , grabs her coat and Liz's hand
Okay, time to go
Liz doesn't move
'll go home with you, you can call me Hannah,  don't give a -- Liz
(whispering to him) Another time, maybe
, the girls leave the bar

7 Still driving, Tracy looks at Cal
He remains silent
'm unhappy, Cal
've tried not to be
We've been married so long, somewhere we became
stagnant, you know
He keeps staring straight ahead
Okay, you're not talking and you know that only makes me talk more
Maybe that's good, maybe that's good
Okay
() () 8
7 : 7 (') () There's this person
No response
We've been spending time together
Lunches, meetings, that kind of stuff
Silence
She closes her eyes tightly
slept with him
Kind of
Tracy opens one eye, taking a peek
Nothing
No, no kind of
can't believe said kind of
That's just not something you do in a kind of way
slept with someone
There said it
slept with someone
Oh God
It's the worst thing 've ever done but it feels so good to say out loud
slept with someone
with someone slept with
slept with please stop me, please say something
No reaction
David Jacobowitz
From work
You met him at the Christmas party
You remember that party
They had the giant paper-mache wreath kept asking the decorator how he made it
You wore that sweater -- Finally, Cal speaks -- Please stop
The last person in the world 'd ever want to hurt was you, Cal -- If you keep talking, 'm going to get out of the car
() 9
7 : (2) 7 But the fact that  did, that it could happen at all,  think it just shows how broken we are and -- Okay
Just like that, Cal    to the moving car and, simply, steps out
Tracy  as Cal goes flying
She screeches to a stop as he tumbles to the curb in her rearview mirror
8
-   8 Tracy runs to him
He's on the curb,  but okay
Are you out of your mind
He looks up at her, pleading
'll leave tonight, 'll sign whatever you want me to sign, if you'll just stop talking about it
She touches his bloody forehead, affectionate
There's still something here
Okay
Okay
He stands, limps back to the car

9 Meanwhile, Jessica sits on the living room couch
Robbie , stands there
He's a precocious, adorable, masturbation-addicted, thirteen-year-old
'm sorry that you had to see that
She keeps staring straight ahead
should have knocked
() 10
9 : 9 Silence
After a long beat
For the record:  think about you while  do it -- Robbie
have a picture of you and  look at it the whole time -- Stop it
love you, Jessica
And  know you're seventeen, and  know just turned thirteen, which is the same age as your little brother, and you're technically my baby- sitter, but someday soon our age difference will be inconsequential which is good because
-- 'm pretty sure you're my soulmate
She stops, looks at him and smiles gently
Listen, Robbie -- (
) We're home
Shit
Jessica jumps off the couch
Hi, Mr
and Mrs
Weaver
How was dinner
() Oh my God, Mr
Weaver, you're bleeding
Why are you bleeding
() 11
9 : (2) 9 Mrs
Weaver told me she wants a divorce so  jumped out of the car
Hope the kids behaved
Come on, 'll drive you home
Robbie steps
Dad
Oh
didn't know you were here
You're getting divorced
Yes
Cal
And you jumped out of a car
moving car, yes
Cal
( ) 'm sorry you found out this way
'm sorry you jumped out of a car
Thanks
() Jessica, you got your coat
Uh-huh
10
-  10 Cal drives now
Jessica in the front
Awkward
Finally, Cal starts talking to himself
Almost shell- shocked
() 12
10 : 10 We'll talk to the kids tomorrow
Tell them we're separating
Just separating
We'll do it together
He thinks
'll have to tell Nanna
Uch, she's gonna be crushed
But not right now
She's got enough to worry about
He trails off
Another long beat of silence, then he remembers his company and turns toward Jessica
( ) So,  hear Stanford early admission, huh
know your dad is so proud
Yeah
() You're bleeding real bad, Mr
Weaver
She goes to touch his eye
Out of nowhere
he starts out of his steering wheel
David Jacobowitz
Are you kidding me
He calms down, slowly
Pulls up to a
Sorry about that
It's okay
Jessica reaches for the door, but stops
She takes a deep breath, adorable
Mr
Weaver,  know you don't know me very well, but 've been baby- sitting for your family for three years
You're the nicest dad of any of the families  baby-sit for, by a country mile
() () 13
10 : (2) 10 (') You're funny, and you're always really generous, and you're the only dad who's excited -- genuinely excited -- to check on his kids when he gets home from dinner
Now  like Mrs
Weaver, like her a lot, but if she wants to divorce you, well
then think she's batshit crazy
Cal smiles, distracted but grateful
In fact -- and,  hope this doesn't make you uncomfortable -- think 've even developed a -- ( ) Hey: do me a favor -- can you not mention what's going on between Mrs
Weaver and  to your parents
It's probably better they hear it from us
Okay
Uh-huh
That's my girl
Jessica awkwardly gets out of the car
Hey, Jessica
Thanks for listening
She smiles, turns back
She freezes when she sees
He's holding  out the window to pay her
You put this to that fake you'll need up at Stanford
And with a sad wink, he drives off -- leaving her standing there, lovelorn and forty-five dollars richer
: 11
-  11 Cal sits at the bar, drinking away his sorrows
He's disheveled, a bit wobbly
He motions for the
() 14
11 : 11 Another vodka cranberry
Yes
Just
yes
(30s) approaches the bar
Cal taps her shoulder, a drunken train-wreck waiting to happen
Guess what
What
My wife is having intercourse with someone who isn't me
'm sorry to hear that
That's very nice of you to say
She just told me tonight, obviously it came as a bit of a shock and you're not listening anymore
The Girl has turned back to a group of friends
bet you wouldn't ignore me if were David Jacobowitz
My wife doesn't ignore David Jacobowitz
(to no one) She screws him
Something catches Cal's eye across the bar
We
wearing his two thousand dollar suit, he's now got fawning over him at his table
Cal takes him in for a long beat, turns back to the bartender, and decides: (: ) Gay
15
12
-  12 You know these places: basically a "strip" of identical housing units -- usually occupied by newly-divorced dads
(60s) gives Cal the tour
So it's pretty no-frills
Unit 2 is a lot like unit 1 except you're downstairs so
the ground is closer
Which is nice
13
-   13 The most depressing, empty, beige place ever
guess the price is right
Yeah, well, tons of divorced guys here
You'll fit right in
Cal , un-enthused
'll take it
Ooh, the gym has an elliptical machine
assume you want to get back in shape
Cal looks down, embarrassed
guess
Great
'll let you know when they fix it
14
-  14 Cal sits at his desk, doing paperwork
His
Cal,  just got the weekly sales report, good good good
You really killed this quarter
() () 16
14 : 14 (') Keep it up you're going to be sitting in my seat by year's end
Really great, Cal
Seriously
Who told you Tracy and  were getting a divorce
() Divorce
That's it
Amy heard you crying in the bathroom
We all thought it was cancer
Thank God
have to go buy furniture now
Cal stands,
Go for it
(then, calling after) It could have been cancer, buddy
15
-  15 Cal is sitting on a plain, faux-modern couch
He's staring into space
Can  help you, sir
My wife is sleeping with David Jacobowitz
need a couch
Ooh,  understand
Can  give you a word of advice, one divorced man to another
If you don't mind
Sure
Get the matching chaise, killer deal
He pats the adjacent piece
Cal processes this
want it in beige
() 17
15 : 15 'll write you up
16
-  16 Cal's back at the bar, sipping on his drink
He looks absolutely exhausted
He looks across the bar
At his usual table, Jacob is now wooing a
Cal shakes his head, amazed at this guy's chutzpah grabs the open bar stool next to Cal
Cal reacts
Oh, no, 'm sorry, 'm waiting for a friend
You've been holding the seat for an hour
( ) Yeah, well, my wife is screwing David Jacobowitz so eat me
The guy shrugs, walks away
Cal looks at his watch, puts a napkin on his drink, and stands
17
-  17 Cal pees
Jacob steps   in the adjacent urinal
Cal does a friendly "'m peeing next to you" nod
Then: Can't help but notice that you're always surrounded by women
Multiple women
Jacob doesn't even turn
'm getting divorced
Or, in the process
Gonna be single again
Nothing
Any advice
Yeah
() 18
17 : 17 Jacob zips, flushes, turns
Don't start conversations with people while they're pissing
He walks away, washes his hands,
beat, then: ( ) So gay
: 18
-  18 Cal's a few drinks in now
The door to the bar opens as (late 40s) rushes in
An oak tree of a man
He's carrying a
Sorry 'm late,  had to pick something up from Macy's
Don't worry about it, here, sit, 've been guarding this stool with my life
Bernie sits, looks uncomfortable
It's good to see you, man
've called you a few times
It's been a rough couple of days, obviously
Nothing  could use more than my old pal Bernie to unload on
Hey, we should play racquetball, when's the last time we played racquetball
Claire won't let me be friends with you anymore
Cal takes this in
'm sorry, what
She said we had to choose between you and Tracy
chose you
She said no
() 19
18 : 18 He pulls a   from the bag, hands it to Cal
It's cologne
Are you breaking up with me
Claire's waiting in the car
Um
there's a gift receipt in there
Sorry
Bernie stands, awkwardly
He pats Cal on the shoulder, lingers a beat too long, then simply turns and
Cal is left alone
He raises a finger at the Bartender
Do you have anything with a worm in it
Because 'd like a gallon of that now
Legs crossed, martini in hand, he's been watching Cal get dumped this whole time
He   from Cal's feet
The white sneakers
Bad navy blue dress socks
Dad khakis
An ill-fitting, untucked, dress shirt
Half-lidded eyes
Rumpled hair
Jacob shakes his head
Jesus Christ
He says something to   who currently sits at the table
She nods, gets up and walks away
As the Bartender pours him a second shot
He's now showing pictures from his wallet to the Bartender
This is my youngest, Molly
Her two favorite things are High School Musical and her mother hate both of her two favorite things

Cal turns, sees Jacob
Jacob motions for Cal to come over
Every move Jacob makes is practiced, perfectly cool
() 20
18 : (2) 18 Cal points at himself: "Me
" Jacob nods: "Yep
" Cal , stands, and wobbles over towards Jacob
Jacob Palmer
-- 'd like to buy you a drink, Cal
already have a drink
Let me buy you a drink, Cal
Okay
Jacob motions to the Bartender who
Cal
My wife is cheating on me with -- David Jacobowitz, yes, Cal, 've heard
We've all heard
For the last two nights, 've watched you batter every poor soul in this bar with your sad-sack loser sob story
Cal takes this in
He
You know what,  don't need this -- Sit down, Cal
Okay
Cal sits
Jacob's that powerful
Cal's that drunk
() 21
18 : (3) 18 Cal, 'm going to make you an offer, it's probably the best offer you're ever going to get, and you're extremely drunk, so it's wildly important that you don't answer until 've finished and you've taken a few moments to process what 'm saying
Do you understand
Cal goes to answer, Jacob holds up a finger
Cal stops himself
Once he's settled, Jacob continues: As  said, 've been watching you for two days now and  can say, without hesitation, that you are the sorriest man 've ever seen in my life -- don't interrupt, Cal, it's the truth, and you need to hear it
You're sitting there with your Supercut haircut, getting drunk on watered down vodka-cranberries like a fourteen- year-old girl, wearing a 41R jacket when you should be wearing a 40L --  don't know if  want to help you or euthanize you -- stop drinking out of the goddamn straw, Cal
Cal stops drinking from the wimpy red straw
You asked me for advice before, Cal, so 'm going to help you don't know why
Maybe 'm just bored
Maybe all my friends have abandoned me for wives and children and labradoodle puppies, who cares why
Why doesn't matter
The point is, you've got a good face, and a good head of hair, and 'm bored as hell and need a project
So if you want, 'm going to help you rediscover your manhood
Do you remember when it was that you lost it
Cal shakes "no
" () 22
18 : (4) 18 Doesn't matter, we'll find it
And when we do, when 'm through with you, that wife of yours is going to rue the day she decided to give up on you too early
That's my offer
What do you say
Cal stares at him blankly
long beat of silence
Cal goes for a drink, almost uses the straw
then catches himself
He puts down the drink
Looks up
Yeah, okay
Mall food court, Thursday, six o'clock
'm sorry, what
Jacob downs his drink, nods at   (now nearby)
You ready to go
She nods, subservient, and follows him out
Cal shakes his head, picks up his drink, and slurps the rest of his vodka cranberry out of the straw

He loads it into the -haul and takes a last look back at: weathered playground sits off to the side
You can tell it hasn't been used in quite some time
Baseball equipment lays all over, the site of many father-son catches
An oft-used barbecue next to the house
You can tell a lot about this family from seeing this backyard
You like this family a lot from seeing this backyard
() 23
19 : 19 (
) Cal
Cal looks up
Tracy approaches
She's wearing sweats
It's pretty obvious that she's been crying
Awkward silence
Neither knows what to say
just wanted to say that
Her voice cracks
She turns away
Shit
She gathers herself
Cal steps forward
Instinct tells him to comfort his wife but he can't anymore and he stops himself
She realizes this
There's something harsh and complicated about the reality of it all
Tracy looks at the -, wipes her eyes and tries to lighten things
Do you want me to back that thing out of the driveway for you
'll be fine
You have trouble in reverse is all
It was two times -- Three if you count my father's foot
did that on purpose
knew it
They smile, in rhythm for a moment
Then they realize, stop smiling
Cal turns awkwardly
Once 'm settled, 'll get the kids so they can see the place
He walks to the truck
Tracy's voice stops him
() 24
19 : (2) 19 think 'm have a mid-life crisis maybe
Can women have mid-life crisis
( ) Make sure the lawn gets enough water
In the movies it's always men having them and buying ridiculous yellow Porsches, but 'm not a man and  really don't want a yellow -- You have to fertilize once a month
Not twice a month, not once every two months
She takes a deep breath, finding her balance
We got married so young, Cal
And 'm forty-one
And that's so much older than  thought 'd be
The sprinklers turn off behind you
And  got really upset with an umpire at Molly's t-ball game last month -- like really upset, like screamed at him and wished he would die -- and  started feeling like the person  promised wouldn't turn into, you know
If it rains a lot, you need to shut off the automatic setting
And we haven't been us, not for a long time
And  don't know when you and  stopped being `us' but
mean, do you
Cal finally turns and looks at her
() 25
19 : (3) 19 think it was when you screwed David Jacobowitz
Ouch
Tracy's face registers the blow, but she nods: she also understands it
Make sure my azaleas get enough sun
Cal turns, gets in the -, and backs out
And immediately crashes into the neighboring
20
-  20 Cal leads in Molly and Robbie
Okay, well, this is it
What do you think
Didn't have a lot of time to house-hunt, but
They look around his depressing, beige apartment pathetic  plays the Disney Channel in the corner
There's a second bedroom with twin beds so you two can stay over whenever you want
Anytime
So
you're like, actually going to live here
Molly looks like she's going to cry
Hey, hey
Come on now, you'll visit all the time
Every weekend
It won't be that bad
Don't you love us anymore
Cal takes Molly's face in his hands, starts tearing up
Listen, baby
What's happening with your mommy and
it's not what either of us wanted, not what either of us planned
() () 26
20 : 20 (') But you need to understand that you kids have done nothing wron-- She bolts past Cal to the , where   is on- screen, prancing about in a basketball uniform
Robbie and Cal stand there, awkwardly
Don't take it personally
That show's like crack to her
Cal
You okay
You
Robbie shrugs
Can  say something with a curse
One time
Yeah
Why not
Robbie , takes a deep breath
Love is fucked
Cal , a bit of tension relieved
Is that so
You in love, buddy
Well, if you must know -- (
) Ding dong
They turn -- it's Jessica, the baby-sitter
What is she doing here
Oh, right, hey, Jess, thanks for -- () () 27
20 : (2) 20 (') (back to Robbie) have to run out really quickly, just for a few hours, and your mother wants you to stay here while she's out hooking -- What
Huh
( ) The place is
nice, Mr
Weaver
Yes, well, that's a generous adjective, thank you
( ) Anyhow, Jess is gonna keep an eye on you guys for a few
But  don't need a babysitter
She's only four years older than me
You need to know that
She needs to know that
know, buddy
Cal musses Robbie's hair
My little boy's growing up, Jess
He's in love already, can you believe it
Uch
Robbie thumps the wall with his head, dying
Molly, say bye-bye to Daddy
No response, she's glued to the television
Wait, where are you going
'm, uh
decided to take a class
() 28
20 : (3) 20 That's great, Mr
Weaver
It's a difficult time for you, it's important that you find new interests, try new things, maybe things you'd never have considered trying before
Cal looks down, Jessica has her hand on his shoulder
It's a bit odd
She realizes, takes it off
Okay, well
Molly, last chance
But Molly is still locked on Efron
That's my angel
Back in a few
But, Dad -- Nope
The door slams
Robbie stands there with Jessica, awkward
Tries to maintain some semblance of cool
don't need a baby-sitter
know, Robbie
An awkward beat, then
love you so much -- Jesus Christ

-   21 Cal pulls into the parking lot, grabs a space
What am  doing
22
-   22 He , still going
() 29
22 : 22 What the hell am  doing
He walks past a
Inside is
Hannah (girl from the bar who Jacob tried picking up)
23
-   23 She's sitting at a table with Liz (her friend) and a in suits
There are in front of Hannah
Holding her hand is an average guy (33), her boyfriend, We   mid-conversation

think that's Tucker
No, no, no
Chris Rock is the stand-up comedian
Chris Tucker is the actor
Is it racist that  can't tell them apart
Liz nods her head "yes" at Hannah
Hannah stifles a Liz stands
Well, Richard: thank you for inviting me to Hannah's `goodbye' party
The conversation has been riveting, like stepping back in time
Before  go, a toast
She holds up her glass, toasting
Sweetie: go into your hole and study your cute little ass off for that bar exam
We'll see you when you emerge
She's gonna kick that bar's butt
All the dorks
Liz
Yeah, okay

23 : 23 Liz  her drink, turns to Hannah
() 'll walk you out
Before they clear
Hey, Liz
When my girl passes, we're gonna have another little celebration, right here
Hope you can make it
It's going to be a special night
Richard, you just give me a heads- up so  can get really drunk before-hand, okay
You know it
Hannah leads Liz out of the restaurant, : Did you hear that
`It's going to be a special night
' You think he's going to propose
At the Cheesecake Factory
Oh God,  hope not
() Why
Do you really want him to

He's nice
Yeah, well

Jacob is eating pizza, cool as ever
You're late
(then, offering) Sbarro's
No thanks
So what exactly are -- How much money can you afford to spend on clothes today
dunno
Five hundred
Three thousand
Okay
We'll start with shoes
Let me see those sneakers you're wearing
Cal holds up his foot
Take them off
Cal bends down, takes one off
() Other one too, please
Cal does as he's told
Jacob holds out his hands
Cal , hands Jacob the shoes
Jacob simply turns and throws them over the railing
What the hell
Are you in a fraternity, Cal
Those were my favorite shoes

No
Are you Steve Jobs
What
No
'm not Steve Jobs
Then you don't need to walk around in New Balance Sneaker, ever
Let's go

-   25 Cal (barefoot) follows Jacob around the store

Jacob ignores him, grabs a pair of
Any man can rebuild his entire wardrobe with sixteen simple items

Numbers one and two: pair of dress shoes, pair of loafers

Your credit card please

These are two hundred and thirty dollars

Jacob is already halfway to the car
'm sorry
Don't leave

28 : 28 Jacob immediately heads back inside and answers: No, Cal
We can't just go to the Gap
What's wrong with the Gap
In Hell, every store is the Gap, that's what's wrong with the Gap, Cal
It's lowest common denominator
Be better than the fucking Gap, Cal

) Four dress shirts
Cal's arms are filling

31 : 31 You rub this in around your eyes every night and every morning
What does it do
() It gives you x-ray vision, Cal
() It tightens things up
The skin around your eyes looks like Milton Berle's ballsack
Cal stops, examines his eyes in a mirror
Oh my God, it does
32    32 Cal is getting his hair cut at a fancy salon
The is young, hip, and beautiful
like to use a number four on the sides and the back, go longer on the top
Oh, okay
Thanks for that, Vidal Sassoon
Tiffany, hon
Scissor cut, tight on sides, get him some texture up top, take off about

like to blouse out my shirts a little
Shut up, Cal
( ) You'd fuck him, right
() Jesus
Yeah, probably
Tiffany
(then, realizing) You would
Tiffany
You see that, Cal
The simple act of opening your mouth instantly causes Tiffany to lose interest in sleeping with you
Your personality is actually your weakest link
Cal takes this in
Well, that's the meanest thing anyone's ever said to me
No, Cal
The meanest thing anyone's ever said to you is this: your wife cheated on you because you lost sight of what it took to keep her content at home -- as a man, as a husband, and probably as a lover
Cal's lower lip begins to quiver
() 38
33 : (2) 33 Yeah, okay, that was meaner
: 34
-   34 Cal sits next to Jacob
Cal is wearing his new "outfit
" He looks great, but not yet comfortable in his new "gear
" Jacob, on the other hand, looks like he's walked out of a men's magazine
And he knows it
Cal looks at Jacob
notice you only button your shirts up, like, halfway
can't pull that off, right
No
Listen, Cal, 'm going to be calling women over to our table shortly
Cal rubs his hands together, nervous
We should have some background on each other, no
'm in insurance, more on the corporate side
My kids are -- Cal, the only thing  care less about than corporate insurance are your kids
Here's the only thing need to know: how many women have you been with
Sexually
Yes
In my entire life
No, synchronized swimming
Yes, Cal
Sexually
Cal thinks
He  to himself, counting it out on one hand

34 : 34 He smiles at Jacob proudly when he has to move the count to a second hand
Then: One
Jacob
But Cal just stares at him blankly
Wow, okay
wow
(then, checking) Not at a time
Total
What

We met in high school
He smiles, remembering
Tracy was so damn beautiful
You know those women, the ones who can be wildly sexy and unbelievably cute all at once
never knew how she did that
still don't know how she does it
() Anyway, we had a bit of a hiccup our senior year but we made it -- Cal,  literally stopped listening at `Tracy

Jacob takes her hand

also think you're one of those rare women who manages to be both wildly sexy and incredibly cute all at once
Mouth agape
That was his line
Let's get out of here

She thinks, then
Okay

Because they're in love, and love is for stupid So thanks for choosing this book, Mrs

You ran away in the other direction when you saw me coming down the hall yesterday

He turns serious
'm sorry about you and Cal
Thank you
'm also not sorry, if 'm being completely honest

No,  do -- lot
Just to clarify
like you a lot
had no intention of falling for a married woman just wanted someone to go to lunch with who didn't make me want to shoot myself in the face
But we started having lunch, and talking, and suddenly  was an accountant who was popping out of bed in the morning, excited to get to work
That doesn't happen to accountants
Ever
've checked with other accountants
She smiles
() 45
42 : (2) 42 So when the time is right for you to get back out there again, officially,  just
'd like to throw my hat in the ring
Officially
That sounded weird
Tracy  lightly, leans forward
David, you've been a great friend to me
And you were the first man in a very long time to make me feel
noticed,  guess
What happened between us that night
it meant something to me
You weren't the only one excited to come to work lately
David smiles
But now, when  see you, all  see is his face
All  see when look at you is what  did to my marriage
She's losing it, wipes her eyes
You see this
'm saving you from disaster, David, `cause you're asking to pre-board the Titanic
Honestly, do you really want any part of this
Before he can answer
It's Tracy's phone
(
) Your son's school on two
Tracy quickly picks up phone
As she talks, David scribbles something on a postcard,
( ) Right, okay
No,  understand
Of course, right away
She  , looks at the Post-It
It reads, simply: "Yes
" Tracy looks up, but David is gone

Seriously
Sorry
She
It's been a rough couple of weeks, you deserve a freebie
'mon, have to get back to work
They walk out together
They still make kids read The Scarlet Letter, huh
Robbie
You'd really think someone would have written something better by now
Robbie , the tension broken a bit

She places the picture face down gently
She tries to return to her work, but can't
How is he
've spoken to him but only about bills, or you kids, but
how is he, really
Robbie hesitates
Sorry, that's unfair
Ignore me, 'm almost done here
She turns back to her work
After a beat: He's dressing a lot better
Going out a lot
Oh
Well, good
That's
really good
(then, covering) We'll get take-out for dinner tonight, okay
Think about what you're in the mood for
Robbie hesitates, then adds: He's sad
He looks better, but
sadder, too,  think
You know
Yeah
guess 'm pretty sad, too
know
You do
heard you crying the other night and
didn't know what to do
'm thirteen years old and
can you just tell me what 'm supposed to do in that situation
didn't want to Google it
She smiles, shakes her head
() 48
44 : (2) 44 Oh God, baby, you're so much like me it's scary
You wound up with all my stuff, Robbie
'm so sorry
'm okay with being like you, Mom
like you
She puts down her pen
Smiles sadly at Robbie
It's my fault, what happened with your father
It's grown-up stuff that  can't talk about but
it's my fault
Not his
So just
be good to him, okay
It'll be okay, Mom
() You promise
He , the most soulful thirteen-year-old ever
(
) Hey, they need you in the conference room for a sec
oh, sorry
They look up
It's David
Tracy gathers herself, stands
David, this is my son, Robbie
Robbie, this is David
() We work together
Robbie takes him in, shakes his hand
'll be right back, okay, honey
Okay
Okay
Awkward
Really awkward
Tracy starts to say something, thinks better of it, and
David moves into the room, sits down opposite Robbie
() 49
44 : (3) 44 So, Robbie
hear you're quite the soccer player
So, David
hear you broke up my parents' marriage
He  awkwardly, shocked
You are David Jacobowitz, right
From accounting
Um, yes  am -- Here's the thing, David: in the end, she winds up back with my dad
He's better than you, in every category except probably math
And she still loves him
Robbie props the  of Tracy and Cal back up
Listen, Robbie -- Now  know what you're thinking: `he's just in 8th grade, what does he know about love
'  know a lot more than you think, David
Just today,  had a meltdown, almost gave up on the love of my life
My dad's having his meltdown now, but long-term
He won't stop fighting for my mom any more than won't stop sending Jessica texts that make her uncomfortable
And you need to know that
Tracy -
You ready to go
( ) Mommy, can we do Chinese for dinner tonight
() 50
44 : (4) 44 Tracy waves to David as she and Robbie , leaving him stunned in the middle of her office, staring at: that Robbie has left directly in his line of sight

Once, then twice
It's Cal, sneaking into the backyard
He takes a covert look inside the house
All is quiet
He gets to work

-- Trims some bushes
-- Picks off some petals from some dying flowers
It's the strangest goddamn thing you've ever seen
Finally, he finishes

Cal sips his drink, staring aimlessly forward
Jacob looks at Cal
Cal looks great, more comfortable in his new "skin" than when we left him
He's drinking a martini, rather than a red-strawed vodka cranberry
passes
Without speaking, Cal taps the rim of the glass, silently requesting a refill
It's a cool, practiced move
and he did it instinctively
Jacob smiles, leans forward
think you're ready, Cal
For what
() 51
46 : 46 To talk to a woman, take a woman home
Oh, no
No, 'm not
You've been watching me do it for two weeks
Yeah, well, 've been watching LeBron James for years, doesn't mean  can suddenly dunk a basketball
Cal, do you remember the part in Karate Kid, where Mr
Miagi keeps having the kid wax the car and the kid gets all bent out of shape because he doesn't see the point, but the movements were actually building blocks for throwing and blocking punches
Oh God
Are you going to make me fight someone
Jacob stretches his neck, trying his patience: Cal, what's the first thing  do when a woman sits down
You ask if you can buy her a drink
And what if she says no
You order her a drink anyway, let it sit there
When she asks me a question about myself
() 52
46 : (2) 46 You deflect it back to her
You never answer questions about yourself
And what happens
They talk about themselves lot
And what do  do
You act really interested
You nod a lot
And at the end of the night
You compliment them, then you ask if they'd like to come back to your place
Do  ask
No
You confidently tell them you'd like them to come back to your place
() Holy shit
You Mr
Miagi'd me
Jacob  to Cal, Japanese style
stands near their table
Jacob stands, smiles
Oh, and no talking about your job, your children, your pathetic sexual history, or David Jacobowitz
Okay, here we go
What, no, 'm not ready for -- (then, to woman) Hi
Jacob has pulled her over
She's attractive, mid- thirties

Kate, Cal
Jacob  at Cal ("you've got this") and leaves them
Kate
Cal smiles at Kate, nervous
She smiles back
Cal  for a waitress in the distance
Can  buy you a drink, Kate
( ) Oh
No thank you
Cal smiles, portrays confidence
'm buying you a drink anyway, Kate, so you might as well tell me what you want
Really, thank you but it's okay
'm guessing you're a vodka girl, am  right
Yeah
nice dirty martini
No, no, no: a Grey Goose, rocks, extra lime
'mon, one drink
Picture those ice cubes clinking together
Mmmm
Can't you taste it
She smiles
Yes,  can but
'm, uh, five years sober so
Cal's face drops
The  approaches
What can  get -- Nothing
We don't want anything
Don't come back here ever
The Waitress leaves, confused
Kate looks around, uncomfortable
She tries small-talk
So
what do you do, Cal
What do you do, Kate
() 54
46 : (4) 46 asked you first
asked you second
She  lightly, thinks he's being funny
Seriously, what do you do
Seriously, what do you do
Now it's getting a little weird
'm a teacher
Now, c'mon: what do you do
Cal , exaggerated
Teacher
Interesting
'm very interested in teaching
'm sorry, are you not going to tell me what you do
He's still nodding, as if fascinated
teacher with an alcohol dependency no less,  bet that's actually more common than people realize
should get back to my friends -- Kate
Cal puts his face in his hands
'm sorry
'm supposed to deflect your questions
oh screw it: 'm in corporate insurance
And  have children
Plural
More than one
The only thing have  of, is sexual partners, that would be the woman  recently separated from because she was cheating on me with David Jacobowitz who  wasn't supposed to tell you about either
() 55
46 : (5) 46 Kate turns back, curious
What were you supposed to tell me
don't know: that you're a perfect combination of sexy and cute -- it was something  said about my wife that's since been corrupted
But 'm tired, and 'm at least fifteen years older than you, and this sweater is called slim fitting but it's really just uncomfortable and itchy
You think 'm a perfect combination of sexy and cute
Cal looks up
That's what you took away from that
She smiles, sits back down
Wow, an actual honest man don't know what to do with that
It's kind of
rare around here
() It's nice, actually
It is
You have no idea
'm kind of a magnet for these jerk-offs
They charm me, and  fall for it, and at some point they just
never call me again
() don't understand
Look at you
Who wouldn't call you again
She looks up
It's not a line, it's a genuine compliment
She smiles warmly
Holy shit, Cal is in
() 56
46 : (6) 46 So
what were you `supposed' to do next
Well, eventually 'm `supposed' to ask you if you want to get out of here
Actually no, 'm supposed to tell you, confidently, that you should come home with me
Why don't you give it a shot, see what happens
Cal looks up, surprised
He clears his throat, then: You're very pretty, Kate
And can't tell if you're being serious, but  think you should come home with me
() Ask me again
Cal smiles and leans forward, faux-confident
'm not asking you, Kate
'm telling you: you should come home with me
Kate looks up, genuinely turned-on

Oh, okay
So, Madison, here's the thing
don't mean to be blunt or insulting but, let's call it what it is: you're always sleeping with older guys, right
() 61

Lots of college guys, 've heard

So my question is: how do you do that

well, a kid in high school
Oh, well first off,  have a huge rack
You do, yes
So that helps

You put those across his radar, he won't see you as a little girl anymore, that's for sure
Madison walks off, calls back
Don't send it to him as a jpeg, though
He'll put it up on his fantasy football web-site

(to other room) Kids, say hi to Nanna
Hi, Nanna
Oh, 've been keeping busy
Made a new buddy, 've been spending time with him
Yeah, 'm going to see her tomorrow night
Of course miss her
You don't know how much  miss
() 67
56 : 56 His voice cracks
He turns, sees Robbie staring
He heads into the bathroom with the phone, closes the door
Robbie , turns back to the
: 57
'   -    57 Cal and Robbie are having a catch
Robbie is listless
So you're seeing Mom tomorrow, huh
At my parent-teacher thing
Yeah
First time in a while
Yeah, but no biggie
Cal tosses him back the ball
Hey, what's with the moping
Nothing
It's just
there's this girl
Cal smiles
Oh yeah
You like her
like Pringles
This girl's my soulmate
'm like crazy, stupid, in love with her
And she wants someone else
But she's your soulmate
Yeah
Well you can't just give up
() 68
57 : 57 Why not
(then, quietly) You did
Cal freezes
Mom was yours, right
didn't give up
Listen, Dad
love you
have your back, always
But let's be honest here: the woman told you she wanted a divorce and you jumped out of a car
It was slightly more complicated than that
And 'm a different guy now
You're the same guy
You just have different clothes
Do you still love her
How old  you
() Do you still love Mom
Cal doesn't say anything
His silence speaks volumes
Weren't we talking about you
We are
Your son is in desperate need of some romantic inspiration
So set an example for your boy
Don't give up
It's complicated
Uncomplicate it
She says no
Change her mind
Look at you, you're the man right now, Dad
Get her back
() Get back my mom
() 69
57 : (2) 57 Robbie punctuates his pep talk by tossing Cal the ball, hard
Cal is lost in thought
The ball sails past him and of a nearby car
58
-   58 walk hand-in-hand, into the school
It's Parent- Teacher conference night
59
-   59 Cal sits on a small chair outside a classroom
Tracy approaches
(
) Wow
Cal looks up
Tracy stands there
She's dressed down, but looks amazing
Vulnerable and nervous
() You look great, Cal
Oh, well turns out 've been buying the wrong size suit for twenty years so
Well you look great
Really
Cal smiles
Thank you
() You always look great, so
Awkward
Neither knows what to say now
Tracy takes the seat next to him
talked to Nanna yesterday
Me, too
She sound okay to you
She sounded like
Nanna
She worries about us
() 70
59 : 59 Tracy
long beat, then: feel like 'm about to get detention
Tracy , tension broken a bit
Which teacher is this
Mrs
Thompson
This is the one he pulled The Scarlet Letter Asshole routine on
Cal smiles
He's a really weird kid, isn't he
Yeah
() kind of like him, though
do, too
'm so glad we switched the babies at the hospital
Me, too
They
God, these two are great together when they're in rhythm
The laughter trickles away
An awkward beat, then: So, how are things with
(a beat, then) How's it going with David
She looks down
Oh
it's not
() It wasn't about him, if that means anything
No,  know
() 71
59 : (2) 59 Cal looks at his watch, a nervous gesture
You seeing anyone
Who, me
No
You know me
No, not really
Oh
Because you hear things, you know
Yeah, well
Another long beat of silence
Cal gathers himself, takes a breath, and turns toward Tracy
miss you,
Tracy looks up surprised
got complacent,  think
You find your soulmate in high school
you've got the game sewed up in the first quarter, you know
She smiles
put in an effort when we were younger, didn't
'd do anything to make you happy: take you miniature golfing, dancing -- you were such a good dancer
had to be
You were such a good miniature golfer
He smiles, emboldened
All  ever wanted to do was make you love me
And then you did, really early on
And we got married so young
And  guess
got lazy
got boring
And 'm furious at you for what you did
But  don't totally blame you, if that makes any sense
() () 72
59 : (3) 59 (') () shouldn't have jumped out of the car
should have fought for you
You fight for your soulmate
At least that's what our thirteen- year-old tells me
Tracy's eyes well up with tears
He's a very strange boy, isn't he
'll be honest: he scares the shit out of me
She  through her tears
missed you, too
Cal takes her hand, kisses it
(
) Mr
and Mrs
Weaver
They turn around
It's Robbie's English teacher, Mrs
Thompson
better known to us as: (the teacher from the bar who Cal slept with)
Cal freezes, his lips on Tracy's hand
Oh God
Cal
What are you doing here
(looking to the sky) Really
You two know each other
Um, yes
we've met before
() 73
59 : (4) 59 We've met before
Seriously
Mrs
Thompson
This is my wife
Tracy
Oh, so now she's your  again
Kate's getting louder now
Why don't we head inside
,  '
She
Tracy looks at Cal, follows her in
60
-   60 Kate  in front of the classroom
'm sorry, 'm playing catch-up: how do you two know each other
Maybe your husband should tell you
Cal hesitates
We have a mutual friend
Ha
You know, maybe we should focus on Robbie
Yes, let's do that
Let's focus on Robbie
Kate goes to her blackboard
() 74
60 : 60 As you know, Robbie's shining moment this year was when he set a school record for cursing in an eighth grade English class
She writes on the board:
She underlines it
Asshole
Are you familiar with this word, Mrs
Weaver
She's heard it, yes
So in terms of Robbie's progress -- Asshole: as in, someone who tells a woman that he'll call, and never does
We were a little concerned about Robbie's grade on his oral book -- Asshole: as in, someone who uses `honesty' to get a woman into bed with him, but is actually full of shit like the rest of them
Because usually he's a very strong public speaker -- Asshole: as in, someone who allows a woman to go down on him for forty-five minutes because he's `nervous' -- Kate stops
Cal turns to Tracy
She looks crestfallen
can explain
Tracy rushes out of the room
Cal calls after her
She's an alcoholic
You can't trust what she says
() 75
60 : (2) 60 in horror
Cal races after Tracy
Kate races after Cal
61
-   61 three-way chase: Tracy, wait
Leave me alone, Cal
'm sober for  , you and  (including Jessica's parents), stepping out into the hallway and following them outside
62
-   62 Tracy races to her car
Tracy, c'mon
We were separated
(fumbling for keys) know, and  cheated, so it doesn't make any sense for me to be mad at you
Okay, so -- can't do this now, Cal
Tracy,  love you
Tell her she's the perfect combination of sexy and cute, Tracy looks at Cal, stunned
That's their thing
() 76
62 : 62 It's a funny story, actually -- 'm going home
She opens the car door
Tracy, wait
Yes,  slept with her
slept with our son's eighth grade teacher
from the crowd
Claire (Jessica's Mom) takes a picture with her cell phone
But all it did was confirm what already knew:   ,
Tracy hesitates
Cal seizes the moment
Before, you were the only woman 'd ever been with or wanted to be with
And now, even after 've been with eleven women, you're He instantly trails off, realizing
( ) the only woman  want to be with
don't even know who you are
Tracy gets in her car and speeds off
(weakly, to himself) 'm your soulmate
Cal turns around to the crowd, only to be met
By a   the face by Kate
She
`' () 77
62 : (2) 62 in the sky
It begins to pour
Cal stands there, soaked
He looks up at the sky
63
63 Meanwhile, the rain pours down as  scurry into the restaurant
64
-   64 We've been here before
the same group of at the same table
Liz and Hannah  off to the side
There's a cake on the table that says "
" Richard stands on a chair
Excuse me, everyone
Everyone
The room goes quiet
Now, if we could get our guest of honor over here
forget what she looks like, anyone remember
Liz  herself with her finger, looks at Hannah
Hannah takes a deep breath, downs her drink, and walks over to Richard
Is this it
'm so proud of you, baby
had my doubts, of course
More
Now  did tell you that it'd be a special night when you passed the bar
And 'm a lawyer so you know never lie
More  from the crowd
Liz desperately orders another drink, barely able to take it
So, Hannah, 'd like to formally ask you, in front of all our friends and colleagues
() 78
64 : 64 Hannah waits, frozen
if you'd like to become a permanent lawyer at the firm of Watkins, Goldberg, and Schmidt
Hannah steps back, breathless
Richard reacts
You don't have a better offer already, do you
Everyone
No, that's great
just
(then, privately) 'm sorry,  thought
thought you were about to propose
The room goes quiet, trying to hear
What
No,  just
it's fine
'm sorry,  just got thrown is all
Richard pulls Hannah off to the side
Honey, 'm so sorry,  didn't realize
No, no, don't be silly, it's fine
It's definitely a possibility, down the road
think  just need a little more time
'm still figuring out how  feel about us, you know: long-term
No,  know
() Wait -- you're figuring out how you feel about us
She
Once
Then twice
Loudly
Everyone's now watching
Liz gets a good seat, excited
() 79
64 : (2) 64 Honey
She's really laughing now
You know what the best part is: would have said yes
To
And didn't even want you to propose
Just now,  swear to God:  was hoping you wouldn't propose
And still would have said
That's how pathetic  am
She snags someone else's drink from the table,
She grabs Richard's cheeks
will consider your job offer, thank you so much, Richard
Hysterically , she walks away
As she passes, Liz sticks out her hand and they slap five
65
65 Meanwhile, Jacob sits alone in the bar
He checks his watch
No Cal
Suddenly, he looks very alone at his usual table
He shakes it off, stands, and approaches the table of a group of nearby
One of them is telling a story: And you know what she said
(
) What
What did she say
The women look up
Standing there, in all his glory
He flashes his coolest smile
They melt
We've seen this before
The door to the bar busts open, revealing: () 80
65 : 65 She's dripping wet from the rain, looking almost wild
She scans the room, quickly, searching for
She spots him, marches straight to him
For the first time, he looks like a deer in the headlights
She grabs him
Kisses him
long, deep, almost angry kiss
She pulls back
Do you remember me
Yes
Do you still think 'm attractive
Yes
Do you still want to take me home
Yes
Hannah , takes his hand
Let's go
She leads him out of the bar
We   the Jacob had just been introducing himself to
#1 Slut
66
'  -  66 We haven't been here yet
It's exactly what you'd expect though: an elegant bachelor-pad
Modern furniture
Sleek
Everything just right
Jacob puts an album on his record player
() 81
66 : 66 This place looks like something out of a men's magazine
Is that a compliment
'm not sure
Music starts playing: "As Tears Go By" by the Stones
like this song
thought you would
() Drink
Yes, please
Jacob pours two nice glasses of , neat
Brings them (and the bottle) over towards the couch
He pats the couch
Hannah nods, walks over, sits down
Cheers
Cheers
They
Jacob takes a sip
Hannah downs hers
She holds out her glass for a refill
Jacob raises a brow, pours her another
This time she as she downs it
As soon as she finishes choking
So is this how it normally works
What
How you woo a woman
You take them back to your granite- countered bachelor pad, put on the perfect song, and make them a drink
() 82
66 : (2) 66 Yes
That's how it normally works
Hannah , grabs the bottle, takes a swig
And then you sleep with them
Yes
So that's what happens next
We sleep together
At some point, yes,  was under the impression that was your plan
She takes a deep breath, admits: 'm very nervous
'm getting that
know at the bar  seemed confident, but  was more just soaking wet and cold and trying to be dramatic
Jacob
He actually
You're adorable
Hannah , already tipsy
No
Not adorable
Sexy
-rated sexy
Because  know what happens next in the -13 version of tonight:  get really drunk, and pass out, and you cover me with a blanket, and kiss my forehead, and nothing happens
but that's not why 'm here
() 'm here to bang the hot guy from the bar who hit on me
() 83
66 : (3) 66 don't think people say `bang' anymore
do
We're going to bang
'm finally going to do something exciting and dangerous and Liz can blow me
Hannah shakes her hands out, pumping herself up
Okay, okay, this is happening
() Take off your shirt
What
need to stop thinking
Take off your shirt
Jacob , stands, unbuttons his shirt and takes it off
He's ripped
Holy crap
She pokes a finger at his abs
It's like you're photo-shopped
Now take off yours
No way
Not with all that happening
She motions casually at his abs
So
do you prefer to do it here or in the bedroom
() In the bedroom is preferable
Hannah stands, a girl on a mission
() 84
66 : (4) 66 Good
Let's go there
67
67 Meanwhile Cal, beaten up and soaking wet from the rain, He looks to his usual table, in need of a friend's company
But Jacob isn't there
: 68
'  -   68 Hannah lies on her back in the dim light
Jacob is on top of her, shirtless
They're making out, gently
() This pillow is amazing
It forms perfectly to the shape of my head
'm glad you like it
They resume kissing
After a beat, she pulls back again
Wait, are these those foam pillows from Brookstone
Off his look
They are, aren't they
always wondered who actually buys them
You do
The hot guy from the bar buys them
Of course
She shakes her head, amazed
Gathers herself
Sorry, let's proceed
Jacob smiles, goes to kiss her
she pulls back again
You don't have one of those ridiculous massage chairs, do you
() 85
68 : 68 () No
Oh
My
God
You totally do
() do
She
It's infectious
How much did it cost
Five thousand doll-- That   , hysterical
Jacob starts laughing with her
really laughing
We can tell: this is different for him
He likes her
We watch him as he realizes that
As he processes it
We watch him look at Hannah
Hair in her face: drunk, laughing, completely amazing
And then
Jacob does the most unexpected thing: Do me a favor
Ask me a question about myself
What
No
don't want to know anything about you
'mon, one question
Okay, fine, but then we bang
Absolutely
Now, come on, 'll answer anything
You can ask me about my job, or past -- What's your mom like
() 86
68 : (2) 68 The question takes him by surprise
He hesitates, then: Icy
guess
Not cruel, but cold
Very cold
And your father
He died, long time ago
Left us a lot of money, which is how have
He motions at his
Stuff like this
She motions at his abs
And time for stuff like that
He
My dad was the opposite of my mom, actually
We   as they continue chatting
, as one question leads to another, and then another
Body language shifts
-- Soon they're sitting in bed, sharing the Scotch from the bottle, just talking
Then kissing
Then lying on their sides, face-to-face, talking some more
-- Until finally: it's Jacob who passes out
And it's Hannah who covers him with a blanket, and kisses him on the forehead, and begins falling in love with him
as we begin a
, , 87
69
-  69 Hannah looks longingly at Jacob's plate of pancakes
He notices, switches plates
She smiles
He smiles
God, he's crazy about her
He looks at the next table, watches a   switch plates with his
Uh-oh
70
-  70 the row,  are held between , all entranced by the movie, until we : staring down at his hand, locked with Hannah's
He looks terrified
71
'  -  71 Now it's Hannah who's asleep in bed, and Jacob who stares at her lovingly
Suddenly, he catches himself
In a series of  -, he wrestles with the implications of what's happening to him
-- Pacing
drink
big drink
Fingers pulling at his own hair
Hyperventilating
More staring
More pacing
: 71A
'  71A And finally, he loses the battle: he tucks Hannah under a blanket, kisses her forehead, and finally
Gives in to falling in love with her
: 72
-  72 Cal is sitting at the table that once belonged to Jacob
He suddenly seems very alone
() 88
72 : 72 He looks towards the bar, notices that same -
Also alone
He picks up his cell
73
-   73 Tracy sits at a table,  off to the side
Her phone rings
She looks at it, sees it's "Cal
" She hits to reveal  , across from her
He looks at Tracy and smiles
She smiles back weakly
74
-  74 The awkward end of a first date
David walks Tracy to the front door
She's carrying those same flowers
Awkward beat
had fun tonight, Tracy
And was wondering if -- David, stop
Look,  had a nice time, which is a substantial upgrade from the rest of the
times 've been having lately
So,  don't think 'm ready to start dating but my ex clearly is and there's a yogurt shop where they make this eight calorie ice cream that tastes like a laxative, so if you'd like to take me there sometime  guess  wouldn't say no
Wow
You know, that's exactly what  was thinking
It's almost uncanny
They
This is the moment
Romantic chemistry
Are they going to kiss
Holy cow
And then
Jessica stands there
Hello
Oh, Jessica
Hi
Sorry
Jessica, this is my work-friend

David, this is my baby-sitter, Jessica
Okay, David, well everything sounds great

Tracy stands there with Jessica, awkward
Robbie sneaks down the stairs
From a kneeling position, he can hear and see everything
So
How was dinner
It was just for work
() It's a pretty dress
Oh, thanks
Tracy reaches for her purse, awkwardly
So how much do  owe yo-- Did you know your kids are the only ones  baby-sit for who always want to stay awake so they can see their dad when he gets home
mean, they fight with everything they have to keep their eyes open so they can hear what Dad had for dinner, or how he liked the movie
Lot of kids want to stay awake for Mom -- and your kids always want to see you, don't get me wrong -- but not a lot wait up for Dad
Maybe it's because he's good, and he's kind, and he's decent
() 90
74 : (2) 74 What are you talking abo-- Batshit crazy
She walks out the door
Tracy looks confused
Jessica
Jessica turns, explodes
'
She storms off
Jessica
But she's gone
Tracy  ("what the hell was that") and  the door
75
-   75 Tracy locks the door and leans against it
processing what Jessica just said about Cal
She puts the  down on the table, and heads into the kitchen
at top of the stairs, regarding the flowers
76
-  76 Robbie rides his bike down the street
He's got Tracy's  nestled in his handlebars
77
'  -   77 Jessica  in a huff, goes right toward a drawer in her dresser
She pulls out a
we watch as she: Sets it on her dresser
Hits the timer
Steps back
Drops her clothes to the floor

77 : 77 Prints a  from her camera
And places it in an : "Cal Weaver
" With a heart
She stares at the envelope for a beat
Just then:
Jessica jumps, started
She quickly puts the envelope in a drawer and heads for the door
78
'  -   78 She opens the front door
Sitting on her stoop: The same flowers that David Jacobowitz gave Tracy sit out front
She looks at the note
It reads: "Just give me a chance, love David " but the "David
" has been crossed out and replaced with "Robbie
" She shakes her head, takes the flowers, closes the door
79
-   79 as we spy the Weaver family through their windows: Robbie plays video games in his room
Molly watching her show in hers
Tracy in the kitchen

He fertilizes, trims and waters
All under cover of night
(
) Kids
Ice cream
Cal looks into the living room
Tracy has brought out ice cream: a carton with three spoons
The kids race down the stairs, join her, and start eating
Laughing
We take in the real-time : Cal's wife and children -- his family -- inside
Cal: watching them from the outside, looking in
It's touching
It's complicated
It's horribly painful
Tracy looks at her kids, thinks of something
She steps into the , closes the door, and her phone
Cal leans toward the window, suspicious
Cal's phone rings
He jumps to silence it
() 92
79 : 79 Hello
Hi, Cal
Silence
Cal is looking at her inside
She has no idea
So

Obviously Cal sees she's not in the basement
'm sorry to bother you,  just
what do  do
Cal lowers the phone, looks at her, hesitates
Then: It's fine, it's fine
'm glad you called
Here: 'll walk you through it
() Do you see the little grey door
Yeah
Pull it down
She pantomimes this in the kitchen
Okay, it's down
Now, you see the red button wrote `push' on it

Push
Now turn that to the right and stick the match in
Oh, there it goes

'   -  80 Cal sits on his little couch, between Robbie and Molly
Molly is once again absorbed in High School Musical
Cal looks depressed
Robbie doesn't look much better
Nanna's coming over tonight

As she pulls in she notices Robbie
He's standing outside the front door in a tuxedo
a shit-eating grin on his face
She  ("what now
") and parks the car
88
'  88 Meanwhile
Claire is putting away laundry
She throws some underwear in Jessica's bottom drawer
Notices something
An envelope
It's addressed to Cal Weaver
Curiosity piqued, she picks it up
Looks inside
Almost faints

Zombie-like, she hands Bernie the envelope
Jessica looks up, sees it
No

Bernie, dazed, slides the pictures back into the envelope
He looks at the envelope again

Daddy
Bernie puts a hand up
He can't speak
He marches out the door
From inside we hear a car

Then  at a different angle, double-knots it
Then
Okay, we're good, let's do this

She too  through the same light

One of them finishes writing in a pad
#1 Well, okay

(to his partner) What do you think
The other cop
The first cop, thinks, then: #1 Look, 'm just gonna write domestic disturbance reported but all clear, okay
`Cause honestly, don't even know what to put down here

He nods, walks to the door
Stops there

Keep it in the family, okay
Jacob  down a laugh
Cal glares at him
'll kill you
The cops look at Cal, at each other, , and

95 : 95 Awkward silence
Our whole cast is there: disheveled and bloodied
The place looks like a hurricane has hit
miniature golf hole torn to shreds
Bernie turns to Jessica
Let's go
Now
She
Looks back at Cal
'm so sorry -- And that's that
Robbie runs to the driveway, looks: 96    96 as Jessica runs after her father, trying to apologize

Over and over again
You are not to see him any more

Cal turns away
Well then  don't have anything else to say to you
-- shocked
Cal, stop being unreasona-- said: '    ,

This time it's Tracy whose face registers shock

-  (  ) 102 Cal sits back at his usual table
This isn't "Cool Cal," the Jacob disciple
No, this is "Sad Mess Cal
" He's grown a patchy beard
He's wearing a ratty sweatsuit
He's drinking, once again, vodka-cranberry out of a wimpy red straw
It's pathetic
Can  get you another
What time is it
2:30
In the afternoon
2:30 would have been sufficient but  appreciate the judgment, Cocktail Waitress
() Yes, another drink would be grand
She
Cal feels bad for that one
As she re-approaches: That was uncalled for
Sorry for being a dick
(
) Ah, it's okay,  deserved it
Standing there
As always, he looks perfectly put together
He takes in Cal
It's a nice sweatsuit, Cal
What do you want
Can  sit

Sometimes
Must be missing a lot of work

Some vacation

They wait her out
She
() 112
102 : (2) 102 You want a sip
No, she probably spit in it
Jacob  as Cal pushes the drink away
Your kids miss you
You're hanging out with my kids, fantastic
You can teach Robbie how to objectify women, he'll love that
His eighth grade graduation is next week
You coming
Of course 'm coming
Well you haven't exactly been around for him, Cal
He's not my biggest fan right now
Oh, that's a good excuse -- Alright, man-whore, if your lecture on parental responsibility is almost done -- love her, Cal
Cal looks up
've never been in love before
Honestly, 've never even been in `like' before
() never got it
saw people in love --  saw weakness
heard them say the things they said, and do the things they do, it all just seemed so
so pathetic
() () () 113
102 : (3) 102 (') She's my perfect combination of everything, Cal
Cal looks up at Jacob
He smiles, gently
know you
know what you are
You are not good enough for my daughter
And you will never have my permission nor my approval
Jacob stands
'll see you at graduation
He
Once more, Cal is alone
Just as he wants it
103
-    103 small -
About 150 people fill the crowd of an intimate middle school graduation
Tracy, Molly, and Hannah sit in the front row
Jessica sits with her family a few rows away
All look nice
-- Sits Cal, sandwiched between
Cal is now shaven and well-dressed but he looks miserable
His eyes brighten for a moment as he notices
between Tracy and Hannah
He leans forward, are they saving it for him
But just then
Jacob arrives
Kisses Hannah and takes "Cal's" seat
Cal looks nauseous
We  the ceremony for a moment
The  labors through her introduction
(
) and now, to introduce the first student speaker: our very own English teacher Kate Thompson
Cal's former conquest steps onto stage
() 114
103 : 103 Tracy looks away, clearly uncomfortable at the teacher's presence
She accidentally catches Cal's eye
Awkward
Our next speaker is not only the class salutatorian, but he's also one of the most
() Spirited
young men, 've ever had the pleasure of teaching
Ladies and gentlemen: Robbie Weaver
Robbie takes the stage to
This is not the same kid we've come to love
There's something different in his face
He's been broken
He spots
(a bit monotone) Thank you, Mrs
Thompson
Welcome, Class of 2011
( ) wasn't really sure what  wanted to talk about today
Mrs
Thompson said it might be good to talk about growing up and getting older and stuff
So  guess 'll talk about that
Cal watches, concerned
Where's his son
grew up a lot this year, think
used to think that growing up meant really growing
Like getting taller and bigger
But now  think that growing up just makes you smaller
Your dreams get smaller, and what you want gets smaller
(beat, then) grew an inch and a half this year, but  feel a lot smaller
Cal sits forward, getting increasingly concerned

And  know that makes parents laugh because 'm only thirteen but whatever,  was

But that's not how it works
It sounded good when  was younger, but
it's just not how it works
There's no such thing as one true love for everyo-- (
) Stop
Robbie turns
Cal is  in the middle of the crowd
Everyone turns to look at him
Dad
Hi
(awkward, to crowd) Hi, everyone
Silence
No one knows what to do
Cal is suddenly really uncomfortable
May  have a word with my son
It'll just take a second
Cal tries to extricate himself from his row
He steps over people, squeezes by people, almost trips
Finally clear, he gathers himself, and tries to keep his dignity as he marches down the aisle -- past his family
Robbie comes to the front of the stage, bends down
( ) What are you doing
don't know
What are you doing
Robbie's eyes well up with tears
was wrong, Dad
There's no such thing as -- Cal turns toward the crowd, announces: () 116

from the crowd
Now standing, alone, front and center in front of an entire eighth grade graduation ceremony
He looks behind him at the panel of

In fairness,  don't know where he was going but  think we can all agree it was heading in a pretty depressing direction
And basically wrote it for him mean,  didn't literally write it but  sure as hell influenced it, and the kid's already a spitting image of his mother and 'll be damned if this is what he's going to get from me
People squirm, uncomfortable
This is a train wreck
My son -- not him, my actual son -- he believes in grand romantic gestures
He believes that people have soulmates
And we always want to tell our thirteen-year- olds that they're wrong, that `one day you'll understand, young man
' But maybe it should be the other way around
He looks at Tracy, out in the crowd
met my soulmate when  was fifteen years old
Our first date, we went for ice cream
After, my dad started teasing me about my `first date' the way dads do
And  told him: `stop making a big deal, Dad
'm going to go on lots of dates with plenty of girls
' That was the first time ever lied to my father

And  have loved her with everything  have for every minute, of every day, ever since she let me buy her that first mint chip ice cream
have loved her through the birth of our three perfect children, and  have loved her even as 've hated her -- only married couples can truly understand that one
And  don't know what will wind up happening with us --  don't, Robbie, 'm sorry  can't give you that -- but promise you this:  will never stop trying
When you find `the one' you never give up trying
and  love you, my amazing boy, for reminding me of that
Robbie hugs his father as the crowd reacts
Cal kisses his son on the head, then motions towards the microphone
Robbie grabs it with newfound gusto and announces: still love you, Jessica
've loved you since the first time you changed my sister's diaper
've loved you since
The crowd reacts (, , etc
) as Robbie continues
Cal stands back and smiles
His boy is back
104
-  104 The ceremony is over
Robbie heads over to his family
They hug him, kiss him
Cal approaches Hannah and Jacob
Hi, Nanna
Daddy
He smiles at her, adoring
My perfect girl
He kisses her forehead, turns to Jacob
() 118
104 : 104 already ordered a gun
'm not kidding
ordered a Colt
45 on a shady internet site,  can show you the receipt
If you hurt her, am prepared to shoot you in the face
Cal, 'm not going to -- Shut up, Jacob
Jacob shuts up
Wow
like that
Jacob smiles, shakes hands with Cal
Cal notices: Is that a new shirt
Hannah took me to the Gap
It's actually not as bad as  thought
Seriously
Of course not, Cal
It's the Gap
got this at Nordstrom's
And like that
order is restored in the universe
Who approaches Jessica
It was nice of you to come
wouldn't have missed it
Awkward
So, how are things with your dad
() 119
104 : (2) 104 Strained
took a summer internship up at Stanford, gonna head up there early
Figure it can't hurt to get out of his line of sight for a while
Yeah, probably a good idea
() You were a good baby-sitter, Jessica
'm sorry if  made you uncomfortable
He holds out his hand, to shake, formally
Wait:  thought you weren't giving up
'm not
But  figure: you like my dad, and one day 'll look like my dad, so 'll just come for you then
Jessica smiles
It's a good plan
She looks over her shoulder, reaches into her purse
Until then: a little graduation gift
To help get you through high school
She hands him something in an : the same type of envelope she once used for
Robbie peeks inside
His eyes
Jessica kisses him, sweetly, on the cheek
You take care, Robbie
Robbie watches her go
Love-struck once more
Cal steps up next to his son
You okay, buddy

104 : (3) 104 (: ) am now, Dad
am now
Robbie runs off to join his friends
Cal smiles
(
) 'm terrified of what's going to become of him once he hits puberty
Cal turns, Tracy has been watching
We might have to lock him up
Tracy smiles
Cal walks over toward her
You gave a good eighth grade graduation speech
've been working on it for thirty years, so
She , then
quiet
Do you think we can ever come back from all this, Cal
don't know
'd like to try though
know 'd like to try
She nods, thinking
Things are just so messed up
And it's been such a strange year
've been in such a strange place
And we have all these problems, so many problems 've lost count, but at the end of the day,  mean, the only thing  know -- She stops herself, emotional
Then, simply: am just so glad you took me for that ice cream
Cal smiles
They share the moment in silence
And then: () 121
104 : (4) 104 It was rocky road by the way
No
As they  and  about what flavor the ice cream was, we
Off to the side, Robbie steps away from his friends and watches them enjoy one another's company
He smiles
