The couple is tense
You just don't get it, Kurt
Aw Christ, Pammy
Hang on guys, how's this sound-- you can both be right

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Yeah, whole deal
Now
Now  got my back up against Christ-knows-what
No Lemke, no buyer, the wife's spending like we won the goddamn Powerball
And what's worse, because of the way, y'know, the way Roger passed
Krogstad chokes up
His grief is very real
So is Tim's
The
belt and the lederhosen
(a nod, a sigh) Quote-unquote perverted, they're saying
Like Northlands has some kind of stain
Oh, 'm so goddamned tired
Is there
Can  do anything to help, or
Krogstad hands Tim a Manila folder (bloodying it in the process)
Tim gestures for his customers to hold tight
Tim opens the folder, reading aloud from a cover page

Not gonna happen

Why can't Lila do it
'mon Tim
Lila's about as charismatic as a bag of hair
Bill, 've never

Tim is really starting to panic
You were what, 16, when  gave you that filing job
Right after your mom passed
Raising yourself pretty much, living all alone
And 'm thinking, now here's a kid
Here's a kid who's gonna go places
(a hand on Tim's shoulder) And then, somehow, you kind of just didn't
Now,  guess it makes some sense-- a child loses both parents at an early age, becomes what you might call stunted
But cripes almighty, do you want to just sit there in your folks old house, just rot away in Brown Valley dating that

Millie and  are getting married
Tss, maybe three'll be a charm

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 (') Point is, 'm not exactly dancing in the streets here Tim, but it's a perception thing
You go down there to Cedar Rapids, wholesome and pie- eyed and all that
You show them that Northlands is a good outfit-- an upstanding Christian outfit
Tim considers the gravity of this moment

Krogstad starts crying again
He hugs Tim, his bloody hand staining Tim's canary yellow -neck sweater
Tim looks up to see the Gambskys in the conference room staring at him

He looks at the barren trees as he considers his fate

He closes his eyes, exhales

Wade's presence) Wade's cable's down

Oh yeah
Those guys
Hilarious

If  don't try to do this, it's not just my job, Mil
There are four other employees whose lives are on the line
Plus Carol, who does part time seasonal work
So

Bill Krogstad runs up to Tim
He's out of breath
Hey Bill, what's going on

Hang on, lemme
Krogstad puts his hands on his knees, takes a few deep breaths
Then he hands Tim a detailed handwritten checklist
(') It's basically an  Convention Bible
It's going to tell you who to talk to, who to avoid, how best to fellowship and network
Tim glances at the list, reads the only name under
Dean Ziegler, Stevens Point
Ziegler is a cancer
Sonofabitch called one of Lemke's biggest clients-- Joyce Armbruster
Smeared Roger's name and the Northlands' name
Frickin' poacher
Avoid Ziegler like the plague
The fella got you rooming with, Ronald Wilkes-- that's who you stick by

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 By Ziegler's name, Tim frantically writes, "Poacher" and "Armbruster--" making sure not to forget the umlaut

Affirmative
Tim untucks his shirt, revealing a zippered cummerbund-like money belt
(') On me at all times
Plus three back- up discs
Hey-hey
That kind of prep is pure Lemke
Didn't know any better, 'd say Roger's spirit had kind of climbed into you, just planted its seed inside you there
Atta boy
High praise indeed
Tim hesitates
Is now the right time
Bill
have to ask
Let's say one of these big dogs-- your Allstates, your Prudentials-- does decide to go and buy Northlands
Said it before, 'll say it again: Your job, the office in Brown Valley-- all safe
What you need to worry about is getting down there and representing us the best you can
That's all you need to worry about

Terrorists
It's really just a formality
Believe it or not,  have actually never been on an airplane before
Oh, well you'll do awesome
(takes a moment) If you need any help, 'm in
The flight attendant smiles politely, if confusedly
Tim looks out the window, watching nervously as the dairy farms and frozen lakes of northern Wisconsin recede
He instinctively turns to his neighbor
Tim Lippe
Ah
David Marinakis
They shake hands
Great to meet you, Dave
Wondering, what kind of name is Marinakis
Greek
It's Greek
Marinakis
Mine's German
Lippe

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 (') As in, "Don't you get lippy with me, mister

Before she passed
Lot of people pronounce it lip
Course the high German's probably more like lipp-uh
David Marinakis nods, goes back to his book, seemingly shutting down the conversation
Tim settles in
-- Tim hesitates before stepping onto the jetway-- one small step for man-- and just like that, he's in
,   - Tim helps David Marinakis take his bag off the carousel
Like  say, Dave, it's not life insurance so much as it is dream insurance
It's a good way of looking at it
think so
Tim hands David his card, who takes it with a genuine smile
(') Let me know how things go with your Alltel deal, Dave
-mail me
Will do, Tim
Thanks
David exits
Tim stands there waving
- Tim emerges from an elevator on the roof of a parking garage
He inhales the chilly Iowa air
He glances at his rental agreement and spots his car, a red Chevy Cobalt
Hello

As he approaches the car, he stops
He chuckles, in awe
21
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 (') Holy crap
Awesome
In the distance, the Cedar Rapids skyline looms-- its tallest building, the Alliant Tower stretching 21 stories into the cloudy sky
Tim snaps a photo with his cell phone

He looks around-- not too shabby
But upon spotting a   in a turban, Tim straightens up and cautiously adjusts his money cummerbund

Tim enters the hotel
- Tim walks in
He strolls atop the velvety green carpet, past a fountain, beneath a golden-colored chandelier and makes his way to the front desk-- blown away
An apple-cheeked clerk, whose name tag reads , greets him
Checking in with us, sir
You tell me
Never done the hotel deal before
Well, welcome
'll just need to see a credit card for the incidentals

Yes, we just need an imprint of your card

Tim laughs loudly
Ronald just looks at Tim

just super great to meet you, Ronald
Tim shakes Ronald's hand, holds onto it for at least two seconds too long
You want to check out the room then
- Ronald leads Tim into the room, a junior suite with two beds, a kitchenette and a couch in the separate living room area
Check out these digs
Huzzah
Yeah, you could do a lot worse
(a serious beat) Look Tim,  gotta put the cards on the table here
The reason we got the junior suite upgrade is because the hotel overbooked-- wedding or some such
Point being, they were asking folks to take on a third roommate to consolidate space
Now to me, being an independent owner, the savings of adding a third guy sounded like a real positive
() 25
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 (') But if you've got any qualms, hear you  & , that's Loud & Clear
Ronald has undoubtedly been called a nerd more than once
To Tim, however, he is the embodiment of cool and hilarity

Any idea who we're gonna be chilling with, roommate-wise
No
Just hope he doesn't snore

booming laugh follows as the feet continue down the hall
- Tim admires Ronald's laptop
The screen saver is a photo of a billboard advertising Ronald Wilkes Insurance
picture of a stoic-looking Ronald is the centerpiece of the billboard along with the slogan, Your Insurance Professional
26
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 So far it's just the one billboard north of St

Dean notices Tim's look
What's the matter, friend, never seen a chocolate-vanilla love sandwich
Wait until later when we get to the buttfucking
Nah, 'm having fun

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 We drew the short straw with this pitiful reprobate, Tim
Dean, this is Tim Lippe
Call me Deanzie

No

Bill Krogstad's outfit
The Krogger
(beat, dials it way down) Aw shit
was sorry as hell to hear about Lemke's passing up there
That guy was tits as a rep
Course he thought  was a big, loud asshole-- s'pose he wasn't too far off there
No boy, a real tragedy
() Uh, thanks
Thank you
It's
Roger was just a super great man
Amen
He'll be in my prayers
His family, too
Tragedy
All three nod
moment of solemn silence
Then: (') Well
don't know about you wingnuts, but the Deanzie could use a drinkzie
What say we blow off the welcome hoo-ha and hit Horizons for happy hour
Two-for-one cocktails, 10 cent wings, and an all-you-care-to-eat pussy buffet
That line was unappealing last year, Dean
It remains so now
'm planning to watch President Helgesson's opening remarks
28
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Oh, don't get me started on that smug fuck
Orin Helgesson is a-- pardon my French-- a cunt
Just a steaming wet dog cunt
Tim stands there slack-jawed-- this man is evil
No one's buying the potty-mouth nonsense you're selling, Dean
Tim, you'll learn to ignore this degenerate before too long
Let's go hear what Orin has to say
Fine
Have fun ladies
Not
Tim and Ronald exit
Dean can't handle the momentary silence
As he lugs his suitcase into the bedroom: (') Party time
Excellent

Rogers persona, addresses a crowd
banner reading  `09: Let's Build a Bridge to the 22nd Century
hangs above the podium
'm Orin Helgesson, your Midwest Region Chapter President
But 'm not going to make you play Hail to the Chief
Not yet anyhow
Polite laughter from the 60 or so mostly male congregated in the Sunset Terrace Ballroom, which has neither a terrace nor a window through which to view a sunset
(') Seriously, we've got a great line- up for  `09, with our forward- looking theme, Let's Build a Bridge to the 22nd Century
Just so many innovations-- our newsletter, The -teer is now fully digital
So a lot of our breakout sessions will be dealing with this kind of "- Commerce" sort of thing

He's seated near Tim and Ronald
Beige
In the beige sweater vest
Great
Orin continues
but we stay with Tim and Ronald
() 'm worried about this Deanzie guy
Bill Krogstad told me specifically to stay the heck away from him
Oh, Dean ran for President against Orin last year-- only got four votes
He's running again this year
He's just full of bluster
Tim looks deeply concerned
Back on Orin
The Two Diamonds are given every year to the agency that best exemplifies the  decree: "To provide high quality insurance services and related products while maintaining Commitment to Community, Country and God
" We have a record number of entries this year-- over 15 agencies competing
Good luck to you all
Tim eyes go wide-- Did he say over 15 agencies
Did he say over 15 agencies
Yeah, it's gonna be brutal this year
brought my -game though
You're competing
30
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Heck yeah
It's the first year 've ever had a real shot
But the guy you really have to worry about is Mike Pyle
He owns the sixth largest Allstate agency in the Upper Midwest
The guy's a shark
Tim looks at Mike Pyle, the bland-looking man in the sweater vest
Tim's confidence is waning
Back on Orin: moment of silence for the man many considered to be the Michael Jordan of Mutual Insurance Agents
Roger Lemke
Orin places a 4 x 6 foot poster of Roger Lemke on an easel period of mournful reflection follows
Until Orin breaks out in song--
, a somber hymn
(') Were you there when they crucified my Lord
Were you there when they crucified my Lord
Tim looks around nervously as the entire room joins in song

Um
Yes, please
And just, would you tell her  love her very much
(
) You got it, bud
Tim shuts his eyes for a moment-- be strong
Be strong
- Tim, in shorts, tube socks and a very old Milwaukee Bucks tank top, reads the diagram for the chest press machine
He gives it a try, lifting about 50 pounds
The only other person in the room is a , 37, on a treadmill
Tim glances her way, and by chance they make eye contact in the mirror
She smirks
He immediately looks at the floor
We stay on Tim, lifting weights, eyes to the ground
But we hear the treadmill stop
Finally, Tim looks up to find: You were checking me out
Mortified, Tim drops the weights
They crash to their base
(') 'm gonna have to tell the hotel there's a pervo in the fitness center hitting on innocent women
Ma'am, no

Tim reddens, once again going into panic mode
Joan laughs

Tim tries to think of something clever to say, but just sits there with his mouth open
He's never met a woman like this
- Tim finishes showering
He steps out of the shower to find Orin Helgesson, completely naked
Orin has just exited another shower
He smiles pleasantly at Tim, also naked
How ya doin'
Oh

Tim, what can  say just-- we're all feeling it
'm so sorry for the loss
Orin puts a supportive hand on Tim's shoulder

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Um, well, it's rough
Real rough
Like you said in your remarks, Roger wasn't just a great rep, he was a good father and
And a pilot
Flew a Cessna
Yeah
It's just rough
Come here, son
Orin gives Tim a hug
Tim juts his butt out so that their penises don't touch
enters the locker room, sees this odd embrace, pauses a beat and hurriedly exits
Thank you
The embrace runs its course
Tim isn't sure where to look
Tim,  know Bill's looking to retire and from the sound of it he's on the hook for a pretty sweet time share
Yeah, it sounds pretty top-notch
want to help him find a buyer, and God knows 'll try my darnedest
But-- and it pains me to say this-- there's a petition going around trying to rescind all of Northlands' Two Diamond Awards
What
know
But let's be honest, one of the core tenets of the Two Diamonds is Commitment to God
And the way Roger passed on
well, some folks are saying that type of activity isn't entirely "godly
" Tim shakes his head, disbelieving
35
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 (') You have to understand, this isn't some namby-pamby local event
This is a regional convention, Tim
Now, want to help you, but you're going to have to help yourself too
Orin goes to his locker, removes a folder

Times that by 10 drink coupons
We're talking 40 large, Tim
Doesn't sound so friendly anymore, does it
Sounds more like one of these -scratch- your-back-you-scratch-mine deals

So Big Time Tim, what're you looking for pussy-wise here in Cedar CRAPids
Ah, that would be nothing
Tim displays a photo of Millie (a portrait from the junior high where she teaches) in his wallet
That your mom
No
No it is not
Millie and  are engaged
To be married
You're married yourself, Ziegler

Lucky if one of `em was decent
It's a weird moment
Dean takes a drink, laughs it off
(') What  was talking about anyway, Ronimal, is that from what  can deduce, young Timbo Lippe here has led a-- shall  say-- sheltered existence
And  think we oughta help him, y'know, aroo-aroo
Dean raises his drink heroically
No one else joins him
isn't a vacation for everybody, Dean

Tim sips the thick red syrup, surprised by its sweetness
Careful you don't get too loaded, Lippe, or  might have to take advantage of you

Well hear this: After you left the bar, Mike Pyle comes up to me-- Pyle of shit,  call him-- and he asks do  want to sign this thing
And  go, "Lemke might have been a class- deviant, but the guy was tits as a rep
" Pardon my French, Dean, but that's a bunch of bull roar
My boss, Bill Krogstad
He told me how you called up Joyce Armbruster and smeared Roger's name all over town
Joyce who
Oh, no-no-no, whoa- whoa-whoa, that old whore called Harping about Lemke being a pervert and how she wants to take her business elsewhere
So  says, ", 'll run some numbers
" Well, she calls back later that same day, says she got Krogstad to lower her premium
Which is all the greasy twat wanted in the first place
So wait, you didn't call her
44
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 may be a lot of things, but poacher ain't one of `em
Tim lets this sink in
Dean hiccups and burps again
So what's with this petition
Personally
think Mike Pyle of Shit started the thing as a way to drive down the price of your agency
Dollars to donuts he wants to swoop in and pick up Northlands at a bargain basement price
And you know what else  think
think Orin's in on the deal somehow
What
That's impossible
What
That's impossible
can't quite figure it myself, but know what  know

) Well you better try doing something right, Lippe
Because if you keep lousing up, we all by god starve

You are freaky

What's your take, Ronald
End of the day, you know 'm a big supporter of yours, Orin

Despite the low-key nature of the melee, it draws the attention of Trent, the desk clerk
Gentlemen
will call security
Tim deflates
He gives Dean one more shove
Dean laughs
What the  did  ever do to you, you a-hole
Tim walks away
Dean calls after him
Come on bud,  was having fun
- Tim sits on his cot
He is on his cell phone
just wanted to hear your voice
(
) Brandy, no
Bad girl
Sorry, she's giving me grief over this new wet food
What did you need now, Tim
Nothing
Nothing really

Brandy
No
She's going number two on the floor
No
You get outside
'll call you later, Tim
He hangs up
He exhales
He looks out the window: An Applebee's
Super Target
Traffic on the distant interstate
Something is bubbling in Tim-- maybe not cauldron of lava; more like a cup of soup left in the microwave a bit too long
But still, there's a boiling, churning glow behind his eyes
- Tim determinedly enters a banquet room where  have set up booths
He approaches a  at a table with a sign that says Met Life Scavenger Hunt
'd like to sign up for the scavenger hunt
Super
Teaming with a co-worker or are you in need of a partner
(off Tim's look) This is a team event, like the Amazing Race
On
But instead of going around the world, you look for stuff in Cedar Rapids
And instead of a million dollars, the winning team gets a $75 gift card for Westdale, which is
Eastern Iowa's largest two-story mall
know
Sweet
(a thought, a moment) And yes,  do have a teammate
(   ) - Ronald and Joan exit the Seminar
They spot Tim

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Everything
Yeah, what was that call
Oh, nothing
Say Joan, you have something on your blouse
Joan looks down at her blouse
Tim flicks her chin
(') Burn
() You are very weird
(bad Elvis impersonation) Thank you
Thank you very much
() So, ah,  signed you up for the Scavenger Hunt
To be my teammate
In the Scavenger Hunt
Really
Why
Uh, well
Because Ronald already had a teammate
Bill Hernandez
Taco Bill
And  thought you'd-- we'd-- be y'know, a decent team
So
(then, firm) think you should do it
Heck yeah

We're going to kick some
few  look curiously at Joan
Tim stands up a bit straighter
This is good
This is good

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 - Orin, in a theme-appropriate safari hat, addresses the 10 Among them: Tim & Joan, Ronald & Taco Bill, Mike Pyle & a -
Dean is absent
Like last year there'll be a few physical challenges
( ) am super pumped
() Whoo-hoo
Course this should be considered a fun event, in the spirit of team building
You can find your first clue "under the sea
" By which mean in the pool area
So ready, set, race
As the teams take off for the pool, Dean enters
Tim pauses long enough to say: You're going down, a-hole
Just then, Dean's partner, a  in an electric wheelchair, , 29, rolls in
They high five and whoo-hoo
Let's roll, Perry-- Perry-plegic
Get it, like paraplegic
But
Yeah
Good one, Dean-tard
Like retard, but Dean-tard
Get it
Dean laughs as he and Perry follow the other contestants
- The pool is large and reasonably impressive, with a slide, lawn furniture, a whirlpool and a video arcade nearby
The contestants rush in
Tim spots something on the bottom of the pool
series of bricks spell out:

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Check it out-- Planet
Tim unzips his hidden cummerbund/money belt
He pulls out a small laminated packet, held together with metal rings

Ooh, that's hot
(flips through his packet) Maps, area attractions, crime stats, local customs
Look at you
Bingo
Right here-- Planet  Family Fun Center
Let's go
Act natural
Joan cracks up
They walk out casually
For good measure: What a gyp
There are no stinkin' clues in here

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 -- - Tim, Joan and the other teams bound through a huge, Martian- themed ball pit
They start digging through the balls
Perry sits dejectedly off to the side in his wheelchair
Tim and Ronald shove past Mike Pyle, knocking him down
Tim is the first to discover a foam "moon rock" amid the balls
The rock reads, "
" Taped to the bottom, a message: ( ) "You've seen the future, now Czech out Cedar Rapid's past
" But it's Czech, like Czechoslovakia

It's Millie
He ignores it

Joan swishes a 3-pointer
-    : The teams milk cows
Mike Pyle is particularly proficient
Dean can't help himself
Know what that cow's thinking, Pyle
She's thinking, "quit pulling on my tits and fuck me already
" -    : Dean loads Perry into a handicap- accessible van as Mike Pyle and his partner blow past them
-     : Joan gobbles down hot dogs in a speed eating contest
Tim cheers her on
Ugh
'm gonna puke
No, you're doing great, Joan
And you look super awesome with a wiener in your mouth
59
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 (stunned, mouth full) Oh my God, did you just make a dick joke, Lippe
No
(giggles, with pride) Maybe
Joan bites seductively into her hot dog
The others are close behind
Except Ronald's partner, Taco Bill, who is vomiting
-  ( ) The sun is low
Long, phallic shadows are cast by a series of 70-foot silos which are covered with thick sheets of ice
Tim and Joan run up to Orin, who is waiting by the silos
guys, this is it
First team to complete this challenge wins the whole shootin' match

Tim looks petrified
Joan shakes her head
That doesn't even
There's no such thing as silo ice climbing
No, it's actually a big thing in Iowa
news did a story about it
saw it on YouTube
Of course you did
Well, you can do it then
Uh-uh, absolutely not
'm scared crapless of heights
You need to get over it, Lippe, cuz 'm not climbing jack
() 60
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 (') Come on Insurance Man-- leap tall buildings in a single bound and all that
Tim's nostrils flair
Just then, Mike Pyle and his partner arrive
Tim looks to the top of the silo
It is dizzyingly high
He shuts his eyes for a moment, exhales
Yeah
Let's do this thing
Orin turns on a boom box, which blasts some triumphant music (Whitesnake's    , perhaps)
: The Dudes get Tim and Mike Pyle into their climbing gear-- harnesses, helmets, crampons
And they start climbing
Sort of
Tim jams his pick into the ice
He tries to pull himself up, but can't
Mike fares worse
He can't even get his pick to stick in the ice
(') Hang on
How's it
Little help here
The Dudes shout instructions
Tim and Mike try again
To no avail
Neither could do a pull-up if his life depended on it
-- All the contestants have shown up
But not a damn one of them can get more than a foot off the ground
Ugh
This is frickin' hard
Really hard
think  just shit my pants
Joan cheers
Orin looks to the Dudes, who shrug
-- Orin talks on his cell phone, conferring
The contestants wait in a field, shivering
The sun is getting lower
Orin hangs up, sighs, shuts off the uplifting music
61
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 gang, that was Rick Martini with the National Chapter
Here's the deal
Since no one could do the final task, and since Joan and Tim were the first team to get here, we're just gonna go ahead and award them the first place prize
Unless anyone's got a problem with that
Ronald mutters to himself, frustrated with his performance
Dangit
You could've done better, Wilkes
Wait, we won
Yup
So here you guys go
Your $75 gift card for the Westdale Mall
Orin hands Joan the gift card
Despite the anticlimax, Tim is overjoyed
He picks up Joan and spins her around
Everyone else just wanders away
: '   () - Tim is ebullient
Joan rides shotgun
The screen on Tim's phone says that he's missed 11 calls
It rings again
Oh crap

( ) Hey, Millie
(
) have been trying to reach you for the last eight hours, Timothy was going to call the police
Where have you been
'm sorry, Mil
signed up for this scavenger hunt, and check it out-- we won
My teammate and , that is
Joan
Hi Millie
62
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 That was Joan saying hi
(beat, to Joan) Millie says hi
(
) did not say hi
didn't say anything
If you had asked,  would have told you that 've been at the vet half the day because Brandy swallowed a pencil eraser
Something dawns on Tim-- who gives a shit
He glances at Joan and her skirt and her exposed knee
(
) (') Lucky for us it came out naturally or we'd have been looking at surgery
Tim pulls into a spot in the Westdale Mall parking lot
He gestures for Joan to wait a second
'll just meet you inside
Sounds good
( ) Sorry Mil, go ahead
'   - Millie looks wounded
So who's this Joan
- Tim gets out of the car
Just some gal from Omaha they paired me up with
Between you and me, she's a little different
Real hyper-- one of these types who kind of overdoes it
But for a 75 dollar gift card, 'm not going to complain
63
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 (
) You promised you'd check in with me
'm very disappointed
() , Mom
Silence
It's as though a profound revelation has just slipped out
As if, in an instant, everything has changed
'   - Millie's heart sinks
She looks at her Beanie Babies
Well
You obviously have more important things to do than talk to me
My brother and  were just getting ready to go for fish at the Eagles anyhow
Reveal: Wade is sitting in his rightful throne, watching an aerobics show on
Millie snaps at him
(') Go warm up the car, Wade
(
) Mil,  didn't
It's fine
You'll call me some time when it's convenient for you, Tim
Good Night
Millie hangs up
Wade gives her a supportive shrug

What just happened
He considers his options for a moment
- Joan window shops at a LensCrafters
Tim approaches her
Hey
What say we just use the gift certificate to get a nice supper here
At the mall

We have a gift card

Is that
Save for three tables of  , the place is empty
' Right this way, sir
Tim raises his eyebrows to Joan-- not too shabby

Opera Muzak tinkles
If you didn't know this to be a mall-based chain, you might think it a romantic Italian restaurant
Maybe
An acne-scarred , 21, approaches with a tray
Coors Lite for the madam
cream sherry for monsieur
And here are some bottomless bread sticks
Nice
Thanks
The waiter exits
Tim raises his glass for a toast
(') To victory
To new friends
To life
And all the joys of living it
That's really nice

Tim takes a dainty sip of his sherry
Mm, it does taste a lot like communion wine

Um

He takes a sip of sherry, shrugs
Well
always hoped  could take over Northlands when Bill retired
But that obviously isn't going to happen now
Oh, screw him
He wants to sell, why don't you just buy Northlands
Yeah right
Why not
You could get a loan
don't
Probably not
You know the business
You know the clients
You actually care about your job
You'd be perfect
66
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Grrrr
Ha
Time out
Sheesh
Let's
() What 'd really like is a family
To be a dad
So kids, guess, that's what  really want

Anyway, we ended up getting married sophomore year
Then kids
Then blah-blah-blah, and here we are
Richie's a Supervisor in the Parks Department now
For the County
Wow
Tim doesn't hide his shock well
Joan sees it

And if  had it all to do over again,  don't know what 'd choose

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 (') But  don't have that option
So this is my fantasy-land, Tim
Cedar Rapids
This

No kids
No husband
No responsibility
Wild woman
(an ironic growl) Sometimes a gal just needs a vacation from who she really is-- know what  mean, Lippe
Tim nods but looks more confused than ever
'   - Tim drives
The Olive Garden doggie bag sits in Joan's lap
Silence, other than the radio
After a bit: thought of another one
One what

Or dream or whatever
It's still small potatoes compared to

Joan fights her instinct to tease him
That's great, Tim
You'll do it know you will
Very cool
He shrugs again, but now he's grinning from ear to ear
- Tim yawns as he and Joan enter the lobby
Wanna get one for the road, stud
Oh no,  have to practice my Two Diamond presentation

One nightcap
It'll loosen you up
Tim looks at the ground
He looks up, tries to make a joke
Ha
Nightcap
Kneecap, more like

Yes
She looks at him oddly as he charges ahead to the bar

Bree, wearing a new denim skirt, grinds on the dance floor with yet another

Timbo and the -Fox
Wondered when you crazy kids were gonna show up
He ushers them to the bar, where Ronald is seated
Can  buy the big-shot winners a drink
Coors Lite for Joan
And Tim, you want a pop
69
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Actually, do they have cream sherry
Cream sherry
Jeez, guess that victory really did go to your head
Coors Lite's good for me, thanks gotta run wash my hands quick
Joan exits
Ronald goes to order the drinks
You tag that yet, Timbo
Bet she's moist as a damp sponge, huh
She is
And you're just
What is wrong with you
Shit, what isn't wrong me
drink too much,  weigh too much,  piss people off
Speaking of, that crank call earlier-- way outta line
People are right,  am an asshole

You kind of are
But guess 've seen worse

Please give my children the courage to hate my fucking guts
Thank you Jesus
Praise Jesus
Praise Jesus
" Ach, 'm just having fun
(crosses himself, looks ) No offense Big Man
Right, Timbo
Dean laughs heartily
It's a deeply uncomfortable moment
Tim looks around
He sees Joan talking to the karaoke
Thankfully, Ronald returns with the drinks

Come on Ziegler, this is supposed to be a clean game
No, if you used some salad dressing a bum's a-hole might not taste that bad

Which makes everyone else laugh

He slams it
The room applauds as Tim nervously makes his way to the stage
Tim confers with the

Tim gives Joan a look of mock anger as he takes the mic
, um, 've met some really, just super neat people here
But this song, 'd like to dedicate to the first African-American person 've ever met

Papa used to tease me about it
But deep down inside he was hurt, 'cause he'd done all he could
Joan and Dean whoo-hoo
(') (breaks into song, very soulful) My papa was a great old man
can see him with a shovel in his hands
See education he never had; He did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops he raised barely paid the bills we made
Joan and Dean rush to the dance floor
Ronald remains on his bar stool but bops his head politely
Tim tears it up
Patches continues, creating a: : 73

Everyone laughs
- Joan, Dean and Ronald roam the Holidome halls
Tim jumps out from behind a corner, whips some ice machine ice at Dean
Dean takes off running after Tim
Joan and Ronald follow

The sign on the pool door says, Hours 8  - 11

Told you, it closed an hour ago
Tim tries the door
It's open
Dean and Joan go in
Tim and Ronald stay in the hall

Tim busts up
It looks like too much fun

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 (') No frickin' way
Tim goes through the door
Ronald shakes his head

Tim thinks a beat, then keeps on
Other than Dean's splashing, it's quiet and peaceful in the semi-darkness
Joan sits on a lawn chair
Whaddaya say, Lippe
Take a dippy
( ) Ich can nicht schwimmen
That's " can't swim
" In German
And can't
`Sides,  didn't bring a bathing suit
So we stay in the shallow end
(starts removing clothes) And neither did
Gulp
Now in her bra and thong, Joan jumps in
Dean bobs around with the trash can on his head
Tim slowly starts to undress
He carefully places his money belt on a table
He gets down to his -shirt and tightie- whities
Far enough
He eases himself into the shallow end
Yow
Chilly

Joan back strokes over to Tim
He tries to look elsewhere

Joan pulls off Tim's -shirt, flings it aside
They're really going to town
-, we hear a sliding door open
(Specifically, four floors up): From this , it looks like Tim and Joan are having sex
Dean, meanwhile, has moved closer and may or may not be masturbating as he watches them
Reveal whose  this is: Orin has come out onto his balcony
He looks aghast
What the heck's going on down there
Tim looks up, makes fleeting eye contact with Orin
Shit
Tim scrambles to get out of the pool
Joan is a half-step behind him
Dean decides that now would be a good time to moon Orin
Suck my ass, Helgesson
'm calling security
Tim grabs his money belt as he and Joan run out of the pool area

So special
Joan awkwardly pats Tim on the head as he drifts to sleep
: '  - Joan is talking on the phone with her son
Her demeanor is entirely different-- a tone and physicality we've not seen

It's not that far
Put your dad on
Tim wakes up
The morning light hurts his hung over eyes

Did you not look at the schedule on the fridge
Did we not have this conversation 10 minutes before  left

The playoffs are in Ralston
This is the last regular season game
He actually has a chance to play, Richie
Christ
Tim staggers out of bed, smiles
Joan holds up a finger
(') Fine, but watch your speed on 84th by Giles Road
Chris Beeler's gotten busted twice right there
By that golf course

Exactly
Love you, too
Bye
Oh, tell Ty to kick some butt for me

See ya
She hangs up
Tim does a theatrical stretch and yawn
Good morning

Sorry if woke you up
No problemo
Tim sees that Joan's computer is open-- and his Two Diamond presentation is up on the screen
(') Is that
Were you looking at my Two Diamond presentation
Your cell phone kept ringing in your little fanny pack thing, so shut it off

It's a solid presentation
Um
Thanks
It was Roger Lemke's
Yeah,  see that
( ) You know we were together right
What
Whaddaya
You and
You and Roger, you mean
It's so stupid-- but everyone basically treated us like the Brangelina of  for a while there
It ended two years ago
He was getting into some pretty weird stuff
as we all know now
Tim is livid
He ejects his disc from Joan's computer
(') Come on, Lippe
It doesn't matter
You knew, didn't you
My foot  knew
No,  did not
And yes, it most certainly does matter
Man, this 's me off

You can't be jealous
The guy's dead
Every stinkin' place  go people remind me: You're no Roger Lemke
You're not as good as Roger Lemke
Here we go again
As good
Tim, Roger was a small- minded, egotistical jerk
You're an infinitely better man than he was
This stops Tim in his tracks
Better than Roger Lemke
Wow
Why were you with him then
This stops Joan in her tracks
Her inner pain percolates
Why

What are you talking about
Us
This
What this
What are you talking about
There's no this
There's no us

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 What about
What about it
told you, what do here
In Cedar Rapids
It stays here
Tim gets up, even more pissed off than he was before
Where the heck are my clothes
Come on, Tim
We're adults here
You're acting like a child
Yeah
Well, you're acting like a fricking
prostitute
He wraps up in a towel, grabs his money cummerbund and goes
moment
Joan looks at the rumpled bed sheets, starts making the bed
As she does, she sees the Clairol Nice `' Easy hair dye box in the garbage
Joan smiles a what has become of my life smile
She sits on the bed and stares out the window
- looks up from her cart, smiles
Tim, wearing only the towel, mumbles as he walks by
lost my slacks somewhere
- Tim's clothes remain where he left them the night before
We drift off his clothes to a   with floaties bobbing in the pool
The kid is staring at something: Dean is asleep in a chaise lounge chair in his underpants
- Tim approaches the Junior Suite just as Ronald exits
Tim self-consciously tightens the towel
81
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 'm really, really sorry Ronald
If said anything, or
Hey, it's not Ronald Wilkes's job to judge you, Tim
End of the day, the Lord's got that covered
But am disappointed
You bet  am
Heck, 'm all for having fun
But didn't think you were one of these guys who comes down here only to get loaded and act like a derelict
No, 'm not
(
) Timbo
Ronimal
Dean, still in his underpants, approaches
(') You should have stuck around last night, Ronimal
Watching Timbo and the -Fox get it on in the pool-- shit,  was harder than Chinese arithmetic
What a couple of class acts
'm running late for the prayer breakfast
Oh and Tim, Bill Krogstad's been trying to reach you all morning
Ronald walks off
Tim deflates
- Bill Krogstad paces in a church, talking on his phone
Tim, Bill Krogstad again
Orin Helgesson told me about your little hootenanny in the pool there
Clear violation of 's Morals Code-- meaning we lose our certification, we lose our Two Diamond rating, we lose our customers and  lose any chance of buying my goddamn business

Because unless you pull off a miracle, we're done
You've let me down hard
Cripes
shaping up to be the worst day of my life
Krogstad hangs up
He walks over to his large, beaming daughter
He puts on a fake smile as she gives him a hug
(') You look real beautiful, Kayla
Like a flower
The photographer snaps a photo
Krogstad chokes back tears
- Tim stares at his cell phone
He looks in the mirror
Goddarnit
He picks up a hairbrush and tries to break it
But it won't break
Dean enters
That time of the month
(off Tim's look) 'mon man, it's gonna be
No it's not
Nothing is
My job, my fiance
(dawns on him) God, 'm a philanderer
've let Bill down
've let everybody down
'mere, kiddo
Sit
Sit down
83
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Dean leads Tim out of the bathroom
Tim sits on a desk chair
Dean sits on the edge of the desk
He looks fatherly
(') My ex, Patti
Well-established fact that this broad is a serious fucking cuntstain, right
But like say, she's made it pretty much so the kids hate my guts-- 'm the bad guy
`Cept when our 17-year-old daughter comes home -- oh yeah, happy day in the Ziegler household, lemme tell ya-- who's the one so depressed that she can't get out from under the afghan on the goddamn couch
Patti
And who's the one planning the baby showers and taking Meg to the gyno, all that shit
The fucking Deanzie
That's who
Tim stares at Dean for an incredulous moment
Is this
Why is this all of a sudden about you, Dean
'm telling you this, buddy, because it shows to go ya-- even if you're a fucking waste of space jerk-off like myself, there's always opportunities to do the right thing
If this Two Diamond bullshit and that matters so much, you'll find a way to make it right
If not, fuck it
Life's way too short to lose sleep over shit that don't matter
Tim slowly nods, surprised to find himself moved
- Orin enthusiastically introduces a  in a smart pantsuit
Without any more ado, our keynote speaker, Iowa Insurance Commissioner, Mrs
Susan Voss
The room goes nuts
As Orin leaves the stage he spots Tim waiting in the wings
Tim gestures for Orin to come outside
84
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 - Orin, stone-faced, approaches Tim
President Helgesson, please let me stay in the Two Diamond contest
Please
This isn't for me-- it's for Bill Krogstad
can't let him down
Please just let me compete
moment
Orin nods, almost imperceptibly
- Tim and Orin silently ride the elevator to the fourth floor
- Orin opens the door to the Tiffany Suite, a slightly larger version of the Junior Suite
He ushers Tim inside
(self-deprecating, but proud) Tiffany Suite
Bit much
Perks of the Presidency, guess you'd say
Please
Have a seat on the davenport
Tim sits
Orin goes to the mini-fridge, takes out a Sprite
(') Drink
Ah, no
Thanks
Suit yourself
Orin opens the Sprite, drinks
He reaches into a briefcase
He hands Tim a document with dozens of signatures on it
This is the petition
Tim shakes his head as he reads the names
Between you and me-- this was a ploy by Mike Pyle
Trying to drive down the value of Northlands so he could get it on the cheap
85
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Just as Deanzie predicted
Orin snatches back the petition
He rips it in two
(') just made that happen
Poof
Gone
Rainmaker
(makes rain gesture) Northlands keeps its three previous Two Diamond Awards
Oh my gosh, really
Thank you
Orin sits next to Tim on the couch, closer than he needs to
One thing Roger Lemke knew, Tim
He knew that when you get all dolled up, go to the prom-- the Big Dance-- that you gotta be prepared to put out
To show a little teat
(off Tim's confused look) You ever hear of PayPal, Tim
PayPal
Um, yeah
've used it to pay for Beanie Babies on -Bay
() For my fiance
Good
Thing you gotta ask yourself now is this: "Am  ready to dance
Am  ready to show a little
" don't understand what you mean
Calm down, Orin
'm sorry
Please, let's talk -Commerce for a minute
Tim hesitantly follows Orin to the desk
laptop sits open
(') Four years ago, the brain trust at National mandated we go "on- line" for everything
Billing, newsletter, the whole shebang
Now 'm almost 70-years-old-- 's about as likely to figure this deal out as  was to learn Chinese
Well, as you know Roger Lemke was a real whiz on the computer
86
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 You bet
So Roger's up here looking over this new system, and he gets one of these lightbulb-going-off kinda looks, the way he did
And he says, "Orin, with that newsletter going digital you're saving almost four grand a year in printing costs alone
Four grand
Pure profit
" You see where this is going, Tim
can't say that  do
PayPal
That's where
What has ever given Orin Helgesson
Huh
Not dime one
Sure as shoot not an opportunity to serve on the National Board
Have  not been a good President
Do  not deserve a little something
You're an awesome President
You're  right  am
Orin pounds his fist on the desk
Tim swallows hard
(') But  don't know the first blessed thing about this PayPal deal
Roger had the on-line know-how, not me
'm still not reading you here
There aren't printing costs anymore, see
The -teer's digital
- Commerce
Don't you get it, Tim
All that money-- almost 39-hundred dollars a year-- that goes into a PayPal account now
My PayPal account
But 've got no idea how to use it
87
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Do you literally mean you just need help, like, getting on-line, or
Your performance in that scavenger hunt was first-rate
Then  see you in the pool making love to that floozy,  realize maybe you've got a bit of Lemke's, shall we say, moral ambiguity
need that
You're talking about stealing
Pontoon boats don't pay for themselves, Tim
Roger Lemke came to the prom
He showed me a little teat
rewarded him with the Two Diamonds three years running
'm prepared to do the same for you
What do you say
You take home those those Two Diamonds, Northlands' value skyrockets, Bill Krogstad retires to his time share
Everybody wins
We push in on Tim-- at the crossroads of all crossroads
Outside, a clap of thunder booms ominously
'd be doing it for Northlands-- to keep it in Brown Valley and help my co-workers
To help Bill
Tim looks away, avoiding eye contact
Then: (') What would you need me to do exactly
Orin claps once, smiles like a proud grandparent
, marvelous
( ) - Dean has dozens of Hello My Name Is stickers with "Deanzie For President
" written on them
He forces one on a
88
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Vote for Deanzie
Vote for change
'm good thanks
Well fuck you very much, Carla
The woman shakes her head and walks away
Ronald approaches
(') can count on your vote tomorrow, right Ronimal
Not a snowball's chance in Hades
You're all a bunch of dicks
(spots Tim
) Hey there, Hangover Harry
18 hours and counting
Got your guns loaded for the Two Diamonds, partner
Tim's guilt is apparent in his awkward demeanor
Um
don't know about that
Don't be nervous
You'll do fine
There's a prayer circle tonight before the entertainment program-- might help ease your mind
'm sorry about
Ronald
Just
about everything
Tim abruptly walks away
Dean and Ronald look at each other, perplexed, as Tim exits the hotel into the pouring rain
-  ( ) cold, hard rain falls as Tim walks from the Holidome toward an Applebee's across the busy street
89
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 ' - Tim enters and walks to the bar
He's soaking wet and looks despondent
cheery female bartender, , 40, greets him
Happy Saturday
What'cha drinkin'
large cream sherry, please
As she pours a healthy glass of sherry: Looks like you could use some cheering up
What do you call it when it rains chickens and ducks
() Fowl weather
() That's pretty hilarious
Tim slams the sherry in one gulp-- to Kay's dismay
(') Another please
have to use the little boy's room
Kay watches as Tim heads for the bathroom
He leaves his cell phone on the bar
'  - Tim pees at the urinal
He zips up, goes to wash his hands
In the mirror, he's shocked to see:  squinty, drugged out , 25, exit the stall, followed by
Bree
moment of recognition
Bree
(off her confused look) It's Tim Lippe
From the convention
We met out in front of the Holidome across the street
Bree coughs a hacking, phlegmy cough
She's very out of it
90
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 (') That's what you get from smoking all those-- what'd you call `em, heaters
Smoker's cough
Ha
Just kidding
Butterscotch
He removes a few hard candies from his pocket
She takes one
(') Small world, huh
Totally
You wanna party
Ooh, that's really awesome of you to ask
But  have a super important presentation in the morning unfortunately, so
The squinty-eyed man, , who has been drinking out of the sink, looks up at Tim
gotta work in the morning, too
Can't be productive or whatever without occasionally taking a little ride on the good times express
It's like, fuck that shit, yo
Yeah
hear that
&
Loud and
clear
Seriously
We're going to this thing at my Uncle Ken's later-- after his shift's done
Bree examines Tim, standing stiffly, hands in his pockets
(') You look like you're in serious need of some relaxation, dude
Bree nonchalantly pinches his nose
Tim looks oddly touched
have had a pretty messed up day actually
Might not hurt to forget about it for a little while
91
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 - Mike Pyle, in a bold chartreuse sweater vest, quietly confers with Orin outside a conference room
My advice, Mike
Pull the trigger
've pretty well convinced him that his company's in the crapper
85- thousand is as low as  could possibly get him
He's said nothing to indicate 'd have to hang onto his employees or the office up there, right
Bill was real clear about that
You're buying his clients-- not his brand
You've done this before, Mike
The Northlands policies will simply roll over into your Allstate office in Milwaukee
Unless you want to keep a satellite branch up there in North Palookaville
() Let's pull the trigger
Oh, and Mike-- we're square on my consultant's fee
Ten percent, as agreed
Marvelous
Now just give me a second here
- Orin enters the conference room alone
He un-mutes a speakerphone
The Chicken Dance Polka blares from the other end
We're all systems go over here, Bill
92
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 (
) Praise Christ
This is super, Orin
was able to get Pyle up to 81- thousand for you, Bill, which is pretty amazing given all the
the tribulations and that
Of course that number doesn't include my 15 percent consultant's fee
- do the chicken dance
Krogstad strains to be heard over the music
'know what Orin, it's only a seven hour drive to Cedar Rapids
If leave right now,  can be there first thing in the - and we can lock this sonofagun down
(
) wouldn't want to put you out, Bill, but it would be nice to put pen to paper on a contract sooner than later
Hell yes
You bet
It's no problem
'll be there in time to see the Two Diamond presentations-- not that that matters to me anymore
Thanks a million, Orin
Krogstad clicks off his phone, pumps his fist, overjoyed
He approaches his wife
(') Dione, the deal's going through
81- grand
We're getting this albatross off our backs after all
'm going to Cedar Rapids
No, Bill
Goddamnit, Dione, not now
This is happening
No flex on this one
93
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Krogstad hustles out of the reception hall
The fleshy bride and her oily groom watch him go
- On stage, a    does a lame routine
You can't handle the truth
Laughter
Joan and Ronald are in the back of the room
We used to get bands, Ronald
Real bands
Kansas
Speedwagon
Remember  let me get on stage and play tambourine
'll go ahead and admit, this is an odd choice for an  headliner
Budget crunch,  guess
Danny isn't here Mrs
Torrance
Dean urgently approaches Joan and Ronald
Are you ready for this
Mike Pyle of Shit just bought Northlands
Word is the cocksucker's liquidating Timbo and the whole Brown Valley operation
What
Holy smokes
Does Tim know
Don't look at me
don't think Tim likes me very much anymore
Cry me a fucking river, honey
This isn't about you for once
Fuck off, Dean
Jackass
Hey
Come on you guys
Cut it out
The crowd guffaws as faux Jack does his thing
94
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 said, 'm not gonna hurt ya
'm just going to bash your brains in
pall overtakes the room-- this used to be fun
Now it's just kind of sad
You two are a couple of serious fucking downers, man
Timbo left here in a huff a few hours ago-- you saw him Ronimal
Maybe he already knew
Shit, the kid's one of my best friends
You met him two days ago, Ziegler
Know what, blow me Ronald
It's not my fault you're too goddamn afraid to open up and tell another man you love him
Do what you want, but the Deanzie's gonna make sure his friend is doing
' -  - Boston's     blares on the radio of a pick-up truck
Tim politely rocks out, sandwiched between Bree and Gary in the front seat
violent-looking, wire-thin man in an Applebee's uniform,  , 40, drives
After a bit: That must be pretty all right, Ken, getting half off at Applebee's all the time
'd only weigh like 10- thousand pounds
Pass me that cube, Skeet
Gary opens the glove box, passes Ken a glass pipe
Ken lights up, takes a hit, passes it to Bree
Bree follows suit, then passes the pipe to Tim
Tim looks at it, pauses
Ah
This would be marijuana, 'm guessing
beat
Then they all laugh like crazy
So Tim laughs, too
Bree puts the pipe in Tim's mouth
He looks frightened
95
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Suck the glass dick, dude
They laugh
Bree lights the pipe
Tim inhales and instantly: oh fuck, Oh Fuck,
Tim's eyes bulge, his teeth grind
Then he shakes his head like a wet dog and violently
Oh jeez, oh jeez, oh jeez
butterscotch might help
(  ) - Dean has his phone to his ear
Ronald and Joan watch
'  (
) Hello
Trying to reach Tim Lippe
Who am talking to
'  (
) This is Kay over at the Applebee's
Your friend left his phone here
That right
Is he there now
(
) No he's not
Be honest,  was kinda worried about the little guy
- series of shots as Tim-- sweaty, high and extremely hyper-- dances with Bree to the deafening death metal
The party is a volatile mix of   and
Even though his salmon-colored oxford shirt has come untucked from his casual slacks, Tim still looks a tad out of place
The following conversation is shouted because of the music
96
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 , -
90 , '     ' ,
' (not sure he heard right) Tim pauses
Then-- what the heck
He unzips his money belt
' - Dean, Ronald and Joan look worried as they listen to Kay, the friendly Applebee's bartender
Like  say, he was pretty ripped from all that sherry
He left with Ken and them for some party
Who's Ken
() Ken's our cook
We all think he deals dope, though
get along good with everyone
But Ken
He's just real different
Oh jeez
'you know where they were going
Any idea
You could try Ken's place
It's way out in the boonies
- Bree snorts a line in a disgusting, fetid bathroom
Tim sits on the counter
He's jacked up, sweaty and very chatty
97
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 My mom became real protective of me after my dad passed
She didn't really let me play sports or any of that
Fact, if  think about it, never really did much of anything
Except gardening, which  do enjoy
Well you're livin' now
Here
She offers Tim a line
He declines
(') bought some pills, too
Here
These'll make you feel better
She gives him a couple pills
He pops them without thinking
Thanks
It's funny, though, because my job is all about protecting other people's dreams
But what about my dreams
It could be like-- maybe
(does another line) Whoa, shit's tight
Like maybe it has to do with your parents both dying
Like, maybe by protecting other people-- it's like you're trying to save your parents
Like somehow you feel like it's your fault
Like in your sub-conscience
Something struck a nerve with Tim
He chokes up
(') And so you're not really like, living your own life fully
But dude, let me tell you this: the only real insurance in this life-- is love
That did it
Now Tim is weeping
Bree notices
(') Oh baby, c'mere
'mere
( ) You can fuck my ass if you want
98
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Before Tim can respond to that, the door bursts open
It's Uncle Ken, and he is  happy
Uh-oh
: '  - Krogstad chugs coffee as he drives through the night
: - Orin and Mike Pyle laugh as they raise a glass for a toast
: - Dean's minivan pulls into the gravel driveway of the dilapidated, isolated farmhouse
We can tell it's the party house by the music blasting and the  on the porch
Dean and Joan climb out of the minivan
The rain is falling harder
Ronald slides open the back door and climbs out
He has on a long black rain coat
He nearly slips on some ice
Oh man
This place is bad news
/ - Uncle Ken grabs Tim and shoves him out into the hall
Tim trips over a    and stumbles against the wall
Faggot
Watch out
Bree looks legitimately worried for Tim
- Dean, Joan and Ronald formulate a plan
'll be standing by `case things get squirrelly in there
Getaway vehicle type scenario
99
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 So you're sending me into that shithole
How chivalrous, Dean
You and me can go in, Joan
It'll be fine, 'm sure
- Uncle Ken drags Tim into a kitchen full of  gathered around a keg of Natural Ice
He shoves Tim face first against the wall
Tim takes this opportunity to notice the peeling wallpaper, which surprisingly has the same floral pattern as his own kitchen wallpaper
- Ronald and Joan approach the front door
Judging from the looks on the faces of the  on the porch, black folks are not a common sight at this residence
Gary, the squinty-eyed guy Tim met in the bathroom with Bree, ogles Joan
Nice tits
(not missing a beat) Thanks
Thank you
That's nice
We don't want any trouble, guys
We're just looking for our friend
The dudes let Joan and Ronald pass into the house
/
'  - Dean sits silently in the driver's seat
The quiet gets to him
He starts humming, then mumble-sings to himself and drums the steering wheel
Mm-mow-mow
Two tickets to paradise
Hmm-hmm, pack your bags we'll leave tonight
100
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 - Joan and Ronald make their way through the house, clocking the aggressively angry looks as they go
Joan sees something: Oh shit
: Uncle Ken is choking Tim
The cheer
Uncle Ken punches Tim in the stomach
Tim falls to the filthy linoleum
Bree protests
But he paid for it, Uncle Ken
You can't let some dude pay for crystal meth and an ass fuck with a traveler's check, Bree
That shit can be traced
() It's fully insured
100 percent
() And we didn't make love
Shut the fuck up
He kicks Tim hard
It's looking bad, when all of a sudden: (
) Hey
They all turn to see Ronald
In the black trench coat, he actually looks
He has one hand in the coat pocket
(') (hard-core gangsta speak) may look like some suit wearin' businessman to y'all
Truth is, 'm straight up gangsta
And  always keeps one in the chamber
(indicates the bulge in his pocket) in case you ponderin'
So suggest for the time being that you let my nigga be
Muthafucka
Uncle Ken blinks a few times
Then he lets Tim get up
(') Indeed
101
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Ronald takes Tim's arm
Joan joins them
The three of them walk backwards toward the door
- Dean is outside the minivan, taking a leak on a tree
He looks toward the house
Oh fuck
Ronald, Tim and Joan exit the house
Run
They run for Dean's minivan
Tim slips, sliding across the snow and mud
Ronald drags him halfway across the lawn before Tim finally gets to his feet
Dean, meanwhile, tries to finish peeing as he makes his way back to the van-- doing a sort of crab walk to avoid pissing on himself
Tim, Ronald and Joan dive into the minivan
Dean climbs back into the driver's seat
Bree and gang exit the house and watch as Dean peels out, tossing up bits of gravel as he speeds away
'  - Dean looks nervously in the rearview mirror-- all clear
Ronald tries to calm Tim down in the backseat
What the fuck happened
Oh my God, Tim
Are you
() don't know
don't know
All know is  was getting kicked and then Ronald was there talking like a ghetto person
Dean looks at Joan and Ronald-- What
102
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 In order to extricate Tim from what was clearly a volatile situation, did, in fact, rely on my community theater training
don't like to brag, but  do a pretty convincing Omar from the  program, The Wire
(beat, as a gangsta) Least them crackers back yonder seemed to buy it
The Ronimal
The minivan speeds through the dark, rainy night
- Tim sits on the couch bouncing his legs, still messed up
Joan sits with him
Dean and Ronald watch, worried
can't believe Bill would do this to me
He was like a father
Wasn't just Krogstad, Timbo
Orin's the real devil in this deal
Joan shoots Dean a look-- shut the fuck up
You'll find another job, Lippe
Maybe even move to a new town
Shoot, you could come work for me if you wanted
For some reason, Tim finds this funny
He laughs hysterically
love you, Joan
(to Dean & Ronald) Get some sleep you guys
'll stay up with him-- make sure he doesn't chew his arm off
Ronald sighs, nods
Dean kisses Tim's sweaty forehead
103
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Sleep good, little friend
Dean and Ronald head for the bedroom
Tim looks at Joan
didn't make love to Bree, Joan
It doesn't matter
Here, lie down, Lippe
Tim rests his head on Joan's lap
His eyes are still on fire
(') ( ) Oh dear, what can the matter be Johnny's so long at the fair
He promised to bring me a pocket of posies
Tim shuts his eyes
Joan must be a good mom
sound fades in, providing a: : - Orin stirs in his king-size bed
The knocking is at his door
He gets out of bed, puts on a robe and goes to the door
He peeks through the eyehole
Oh, Tim
Just a sec
Orin glances in the mirror, smooths his hair
He undoes the chain and opens the door
Tim bursts in and attacks
Orin, being relatively frail, immediately tumbles to the carpet
This can't be good
: /
'  () - Krogstad yawns but drives with determination as his car passes a sign that reads   - 100
104
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 - Dean and Ronald sleep soundly in their beds
We drift off of them to the couch, where Joan has fallen asleep
She wakes, realizes that Tim is no longer there
Oh shit
/
'   () - The first hints of daylight illuminate the eastern sky
Kenny Loggins'      plays on the radio
Tim, still hopped up, drives
He enthusiastically sings along
Sweet love showin' us a heavenly light
never seen such a beautiful sight
See love glowin' on us every night,  know forever we'll be doin' it right
Tim drives past a farm and sees dozens of hogs foraging around in a sloppy pen
He stomps the brakes, sliding dangerously onto the muddy shoulder
/  - Tim gets out of the car
The peppy song is still playing
Tim sings along as he dances to the back of the car
always wanna call you "friend
" Sweet love showin' us a heavenly
Tim opens up the trunk
That's when we see: : Orin, in his pajamas, bound and gagged by Holiday Inn bedsheets
His shouts are muffled by the gag
Tim pulls Orin from the trunk
Orin's feet are tied together, so he has to hop as Tim leads him toward the hog farm
(') Careful
It's super slippery
Orin falls face first into the muddy ditch
(') Whoop
Careful now
105
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Tim helps Orin to his feet
Several enormous  rush toward them on the other side of a barbed wire fence
(terrified, through gag) Nmmmmmmmmm
did a ton of research on hog farm risk mitigation
Don't worry-- they might bite you a little if they think you're a food source
But there's never been a recorded hog- bite death
So
With great difficulty, Tim picks up Orin
Then, he awkwardly hurls him over the barbed wire fence
Orin lands on his back in a deep pile of mud and hog shit
The hogs descend
(') The Two Diamonds may be meaningless to you and Bill
But there are people who care about this stuff
Ronald Wilkes
Even Dean
Honest, good people
'll come back for you after the Two Diamonds have been handed out to a legitimate winner
'm really sorry about this, Orin, but the insurance industry deserves better than you
Tim goes to his car, leaving Orin wriggling with the hogs
- and  sleep
Their phone rings
They stir
The clock says 6:45
The woman rolls over
Who the heck's calling at this hour on a Sunday morning
The man answers the phone
(: We should now recognize the couple as the clients Tim dealt with in the Northlands conference room
) Hello
(
) Kurt Gambsky, Tim Lippe-- your insurance agent
How's Pam and the girls
106
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 (whispers to wife) Tim Lippe
( ) Um, fine, Tim
We're fine
Everything  by you
'   - Tim talks on his cell as he drives
Well,  think everything's
Hope it is anyway
Listen Kurt, here's why 'm calling
: - An eagle soars on a large video screen
patriotic anthem plays
We boom down from the screen to find Ronald
He's on stage finishing up his Two Diamond presentation
People sometimes say that promises are cheap
You know what Ronald Wilkes says to that
--
Not so fast
At the end of the day, a man's word is a sacred creed
And the word  give you at Ronald Wilkes Insurance is--  will work for you
Thank you
The words, "Ronald Wilkes Insurance: Working For You" appear on screen
Ronald's face dissolves over the eagle
The  goes nuts, applauding wildly
Dean and Joan start a standing ovation
Ronald, though exhausted, beams on stage
Tim is nowhere to be found
An addresses the crowd
Once again folks, President Helgesson left a note under my door this morning saying he had to leave early due to a family emergency
haven't been able to reach him on his mobile, but obviously our thoughts and prayers go out to Orin and his family

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 (') (a moment of silence) Now
we're set to hear our final Two Diamond presenter
Tim Lip from Northlands Insurance
Tim
Joan, Dean and Ronald exchange worried looks
Dean stands
Hey Travis,  don't think Tim
Just then, Tim appears
He is filthy-- covered in mud, sweat, hog shit and tears
He futilely smooths his hair and tries to tuck in his shirt as he takes the stage to sparse applause
Tim goes to the computer set up on stage for Power Point
He puts in his disc
His presentation appears on the screen
( ) Thank you
'm Tim Lippe
Hog farm risk mitigation
What is
Tim knocks a folder off the podium
Papers fly everywhere
(') Smooth move, Ex-Lax
(a few chuckles) So, Hog
No
, ah
this girl met, sorry woman,  guess
She's 23
She takes drugs, and  think might be some kind of prostitute
(a collective gasp) But she's super insightful
'know what she said to me last night
Said the only real insurance is love
That's fricking , isn't it
Awkward murmurs
At this moment, a very pleased Bill Krogstad walks in with Mike Pyle
Krogstad tenses, however, when he sees Tim's state
(') 'm
ah
Our only true safety net
Love
Crazy
believe in insurance
believe in love
Tim laughs
He looks up and sees Bill
(') Bill
Bill Krogstad
My former boss, everybody
108
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 (- ) What're you doing, Lippe
Why'd you do this, Bill
don't understand
Krogstad chuckles, preferring to avoid any public drama
(') Why'd you do it, Bill
Why'd you do it
Why'd you lie, Bill
(to the audience) Sorry, folks
Guess it's against the law now for a business owner to sell his own business
Must've missed that constitutional amendment
This draws chuckles from the crowd
Insurance isn't just a business, Bill
Insurance is personal
've got some savings
could've gotten a loan
We could've worked something out
(still playing to the crowd) Yeah, there's a guy you want running an agency, isn't it
() Come on, Tim, you're tired
You're looking foolish here
You couldn't run an agency if your life depended on it
Tim's lip starts to quiver, and with great effort: Screw you, Bill
Screw you
hard
( ) That's a bunch of dog crap
You and Lemke, that
fucking pervert
you stole my ideas and called them your own for years
And  didn't say squat-- because  figured we were like a family
may not have quite as many clients as Roger had
But my people are loyal, Bill
() 109
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 (') care about them
And guess what, they care about me
Fact, 've called more than half of them already this morning
Watch yourself, Lippe
knew which ones would be on their way to church, which ones 'd be waking up, which ones probably got a little blotto last night and might be hung over
And every single person  talked to-- every one-- is staying with me
You don't know what you're doing
do actually
do know, Bill
And before the day is out, 'll have called all my clients
All of them
(to Mike Pyle) So hey, congratulations Pyle of Shit-- you just bought a company that's losing half its business
Fuck yeah Timbo
Mike Pyle blinks several times
Krogstad seethes
Before Tim can fully bask in the glow of his triumph: (
) Right there, officer
That's him
Orin, still in his pajamas and caked in hog shit, points in Tim's direction
Tactful pandemonium ensues
Dean, Ronald and Joan rush to Tim's side
Jesus Lippe, what did you do
Aw jeez
This is no good
What's the fucking charge
Here
Before the cops get to him, Tim hands Dean a crumpled piece of paper
110
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 What's this
You'll figure it out
cop cuffs Tim and leads him out of the ballroom
: - Tim sits on a metal bench in a dank holding cell
know what you're thinking-- thinking "this wiseacre's full of baloney
" Am  right
Reveal: He's chatting with a massive black man, , 30
(') But 'm telling you Reginald, you're actually a perfect candidate for term life
opens the cell door
Tim Lip
He pronounce it like Lippy
Well, you're outta here, Lippe
Tim hands Reginald a business card
'm serious
Call any time-- on the mobile or home phone, though
The office number's no good anymore
Reginald gives Tim a warm hug
Thanks Tim
You're all right
111
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 - - Tim walks out of the jail into the bright sunlight
Dean is there waiting for him
They walk toward Dean's minivan
Don't even say it, Deanzie-- no one butt rammed me or whatever in there
"Butt ram
"  love it
Dean gives Tim a hug
He then pulls a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket-- it's the sheet Tim gave him earlier
(') Want your get out of jail free card back
Not particularly
When  saw it, at first  was like, shit am  supposed to take money out of the account, or what
Did you
Nah, it was more fun watching the smug fuck sweat
told him 'd rat his pathetic ass out if he didn't drop the charges against you
(a genuine smile) Sweet
Dean tosses the paper into the trash
We now see what it says
On Holiday Inn stationary, in Tim's scrawl: www

Username: OrinHelgesson
Password: PontoonMan123
'  - Dean drives
Ronald rides shotgun
Tim and Joan are in back
The minivan cruises past downtown Cedar Rapids
Tim looks up at the buildings
So tall
Ronald considers his Two Diamond plaque
112
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 It's not as cool as  thought it'd be
don't think this is even real wood
(lacking his usual energy) 'll show you some real wood
Ronald starts giggling
It turns into a laugh
The laugh becomes infectious
Before long, Tim, Joan, Ronald and Dean are all laughing their asses off
- Dean, Ronald and Joan accompany Tim, now cleaned up, to the airport
Tim sets down his old American Tourister
Well
Deep subject
'aar
Get it
(punches his arm) told you you were a hero, Lippe
Insurance Man saves the day
Tss
Ruined it more like
True sign of a good day
Well, pal, it's been real
( ) 'm gonna miss you guys
Yeah
You bet
Listen, my cousin Bob-- guy made a truckload selling these little scented pine trees all the ragheads hang in their cabs
Fuckin' believe that
Anyhow, he's got a sweet cottage up on Lake of the Woods
Canada

() 113
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 (') say we book it for June, before the mosquitoes go apeshit up there
More time in a tightly enclosed space with Ziegler
Gee, sign me up

Actually, me too
The Ronimal could use a vacation
Done
Dean picks Tim up in a bear hug, spins him around
Ronald gives Tim a more subdued hug
Then there's Joan
So
Keep in touch
-mail, all that good stuff
You bet
You bet
You too
If you're ever-- not that you would be-- ever in Oh-my-God, Nebraska
Yeah
Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom

Would be cool some day to see
Yeah
Look me up
So
He puts out his hand
She laughs and hugs him instead
Tim closes his eyes
She feels so good
Smells so good
Joan's eyes are wide open
She swallows hard
She will not cry
It's
Keep telling yourself everything will be
: 114
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 - Tim looks out the window, watching the city lights of Cedar Rapids fade away
He catches his reflection in the window
He exhales
He smiles a little
Tim relaxes in his seat
He looks at his seat mate, a pleasant-looking  in her mid-30s
So, did you do anything fun in Cedar Rapids
: : One Day Later : - Tim loads a plate with macaroni, meatloaf, peas and mashed potatoes
Millie selects fish, potatoes, rice and corn
They wordlessly walk from the buffet to a booth
They sit and start eating in silence
After a bit: How's the walleye
Decent
Not bad
Meatloaf's on the dry side
Mm
Tim tries to smile at Millie
He is surprised to see that her eyes are filling with tears
What's
Without saying a word, Millie struggles to pry the small diamond engagement ring from her sausage-like finger
Finally, she gets it off and hands it to Tim
He thinks of protesting
Instead, he takes the ring and puts it in his pocket
Millie sniffles a bit, composes herself
Tim opens his mouth to say something
Before he can think of anything to say: 115
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Wade sits down with a ridiculously full plate of food
Shit, where were they hidin' the meatloaf
: '  - Tim dumps birdseed in the feeder
Sunlight filters through the tree branches
The snow is starting to melt
(
) You're just gonna attract red squirrels with that junk, Tim
Tim smiles at his old, gnarled neighbor, , 80
How ya doin' there, Leslie
Ach, 'm too old to give a shit
They take off their gloves to shake hands
Leslie won't let go of Tim's hand-- the way old men sometimes do
(') Bill Krogstad told me he's switching our policy to some fella down in Milwaukee
Allstate
Says won't notice a bit of difference in coverage or nothin'
No, you probably won't
Mm
Anyhow,  told the cocksucker to go fuck himself
Says 'm going with Tim Lippe
man  can trust
( ) It's a good thing you're doin'-- keepin' work in Brown Valley
'm trying
Leslie pats Tim on the shoulder
As he heads back inside: 116
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Let me know when them red squirrels show up at your feeder
'll borrow you my 22
Tim chuckles
He goes back to his yard
He pauses
At his feeder:  robin
sure sign of spring
An uplifting song fades in, along with: (
) The chances we take in life are called risks
: -- -   : Tim is pulled behind a boat on waterskis
He falls face first, skipping across the lake
(
) We pay insurance companies premiums as a way of hedging our bets, in case those risks we take cause us or our property harm
-    : Tim, playing in a summer softball league, slides headfirst into third base
(
) (') That's the point of insurance-- so we can live and love life to the fullest
-    :   walks past a discount shoe store and into
The camera follows them into the cramped, decidedly unimpressive office
Tim, seated at a desk, looks directly at the camera and stiffly addresses it
(') At Tim Lippe Insurance, we can't guarantee that you'll live your life without devastating losses
But we can give you peace of mind-- knowing that if something awful or unfortunate does happen-- we'll have you covered

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 fanciful unicorn prances across the screen, and we: : - : Tim, Dean and Ronald have been watching Tim's ad on a at a lakeside cabin
Tim looks proudly at his friends
Can  be honest here, Tim
You bet
What was with the fuckin' unicorn
What
It represented hope
All's 'm saying is you might've wanted to hire an actor with some professional training
Jesus-- a retarded kid just sitting there yelling would've been better than you
Aw, you're both a couple of a- holes
Tim whips an empty beer can at Dean
The three friends laugh-- living life in the moment
As it should be
