Hello, Mrs

Pat told me all about you, how God made you rich in character, and you're the mighty oak that holds the household together, and not to mention the lasagna you make on game day when the Birds play
- '
'  - Danny was in for assault because of crystal meth and alcohol
Bad combination
Yeah
On top of an anxiety disorder
That was when  was an -ray technician with my  and my anxiety
had a lot of access to medication and  took advantage of it
That's when my hair was long, too
But my hair only grew when was older
When  was younger, my hair didn't grow because my brother
( ) Remember  told you about my brother, he had a Jheri curl, and couldn't get a Jheri curl because my hair didn't grow long enough was so jealous of my brother

( ) He's obsessed with his hair
'
(into cell phone) Hello
( ) It looks great now
You like it
It's good now
(into cell phone) Yes, it is
'
(as Pat touches hair) Wait, you're going the wrong way
(into cell phone) What
Are you sure about that
'll bring him back right away

,   , Come on, tell me that one
It's insanity
He spikes the ball at the one yard line
The one- fucking-yard line
mean, get into the end zone, dummy
mean, he celebrates before he's even in
You know something
It's nothing new
Your team does that all the time
They get close
, 9
(') and then they blow it
They got an inferiority complex
Wait a minute, what are you talking about
What makes the Cowboys America's Team
Because we are, we're America's Team
You should be ashamed of yourself
We're in Philadelphia, what's the matter with you
You're a fucking traitor
What's more American than a cowboy
You know what's more American
What
Benjamin Franklin, that's what's more American
Benjamin Franklin

You still got yours
Yeah,  got mine
(') So what, you don't talk to me
You didn't tell me you took him out
Well, he's ready
Look at him
You didn't tell Dad you were picking me up
Don't worry about that
wanna make sure when you come out that you're okay, and she didn't say anything
(to Dolores) You didn't tell me
The court said yes
Don't worry
12
Yeah, but what did the doctor say
Because the, the court listens to the doctor
Yeah, and the court said-- The court listens to the doctor, -- Dad, relax
The court said it's fine, okay
Let it go
Don't worry
Dad, 'm in there because of the court
That's the agreement that we made months ago
It was a plea bargain with the courts
The lawyer, he instructed me, he said that what we should plead that, and then  would serve eight months and then 'd get out
Yeah, no,  just-- It's all under control
Well
okay, okay
Congratulations
Thank you
So what are you doing with yourself
You know, 'm gonna start a restaurant
(') It's gonna be a cheesesteak place
How you gonna pay for it
'm gonna pay for it, don't worry about it
13
From your bookmaking
Who told you that
Mom told me
Outside
did not
No,  didn't
You just told me outside, Mom, what are you talking about
Five minutes ago, we were walking up the stairs, you said, "Don't say anything, but Dad lost his job and he's bookmaking
" Why, Dolores
Why did you say that to him
He has the wrong idea
( ) Everything's fine, Patrick
'm more concerned about you than anything else
Good, Dad
Good
Okay, the question, the big question, is what are you gonna do with yourself
What am  gonna do
'm getting in shape, 'm getting trim, 'm getting really fit for Nikki
'm gonna read Nikki's teaching syllabus and get my old job back
Nikki sold the house
She left
Didn't your mother tell you that
Let me tell you something
You don't know anything about my marriage, okay, Dad
All right
Our marriage
we're very, very much in love, okay
Just like you two
Listen, Patrick, she's gone
She's not around anymore
Nikki left
14
What are you doing, Dad
You know what
Excelsior
Excelsior
What does that mean
It means you know what 'm gonna do, 'm gonna take all this negativity and use it as fuel and 'm gonna find a silver lining, that's what 'm gonna do
And that's no bullshit
That's no bullshit
That takes work and that's the truth

/  - / - -
15
,
What the fuck
- ,   , () Stupid fucking book
/  - : () just can't believe Nikki's teaching that book to the kids mean the whole time -- let me just break it down for you -- the whole time you're rooting for this Hemingway guy to survive the war and to be with the woman that he loves, Catherine Barkley
It's four o'clock in the morning, Pat
16
and he does
He does
He survives the war, after getting blown up he survives it, and he escapes to Switzerland with Catherine
But now Catherine's pregnant
Isn't that wonderful
She's pregnant
And they escape up into the mountains and they're gonna be happy, and they're gonna be drinking wine and they dance -- they both like to dance with each other, there's scenes of them dancing, which was boring, but liked it, because they were happy
You think he ends it there
No
He writes another ending
She dies, Dad
mean, the world's hard enough as it is, guys
It's fucking hard enough as it is
Can't somebody say, "Hey, let's be positive
Let's have a good ending to the story
" Pat, you owe us an apology
Mom, for what,  can't apologize
'm not gonna apologize for this
You know what  will do
will apologize on behalf of Ernest Hemingway, because that's who's to blame here
Yeah, have Ernest Hemingway call us and apologize to us, too
,
- Why didn't you run with me

17
Please
Do us a favor, don't read for a while

You have to go to therapy
don't wanna go to therapy
You have to go
It's part of the deal
You can't live with us and not go

Yeah, well, Cliff, that's not the way you're supposed to meet people, okay
Why don't you write that down in your,  don't know, your little book you write stuff down in
19
'm sorry about that song
just wanted to see if it was still a trigger for you
Bravo
It's a trigger
'm not gonna take any meds,  should just tell you that right now
You have to take medicine
No, 'm not gonna take any medicine
It makes me foggy-- () No, you will have to take medication
don't want any meds, Doctor
Look,  am not the explosion guy, okay
My father is the explosion guy
'm not that guy
He got kicked out of that stadium he beat up so many people at Eagles games, he's on the exclusion list
had one incident
One incident can change a lifetime
But 'm ready
'm ready to take responsibility for my side of the street
She just needs to take responsibility for hers
What's hers
What's hers
Are you joking
Let's go back to the incident
come home from work after - - '
20
( ) left work early -- which  never do, by the way, but  got in a fight with Nancy, the high school /
'  - principal
come home and what's playing but the song from my wedding
The song that you so charmingly played out here today for us
That's playing and  don't think anything of it
Which is odd, `cause  should have
/  -  - , ( ) come home, what do  see
walk in the door and  see underwear and pieces of clothing and a guy's pants with his belt in it, and walk up the stairs, and all
/
'  - ll of a sudden  see the player, and on the -
/  -  - ( ) - player is the  and it's playing our wedding song, and then look down and  see my wife's
'
21
/
'  - panties on the ground and then- /  -  - ' ( ) look up and  see her naked in the shower
/
'  - and  think, "Oh, that's kinda sweet, she's in the shower
What a perfect thing
'm gonna find her and maybe 'll go in there
We never-
/ - - ,
( ) fuck in the shower anymore
Maybe today we will
"
/
'  - pull the curtain back and there's the fucking history
/ - - ,  , ,        , ( ) -teacher with tenure
22
/
'  - And you know what he says to me
/ - - ,
( ) "You should probably go
" That's what he says to me
/
'  - So yeah,  snapped
almost beat him to death
But now  get fucking chastised for it
'm parallel to my father
don't think so
All right
Can you talk about something that you did, before or after
Yeah, about a week before the incident,  called the cops and told them that my wife and the history guy were plotting against me by embezzling money from the local high school, which wasn't true
It was a delusion
And we later found out from the hospital that's because 'm, uh
undiagnosed bipolar
Yeah
With mood swings and weird thinking brought on by severe stress, which rarely happens, thank God
And then the shower incident happened and that's when everything snapped, so  then realized that, oh, wow, 've been dealing with this my whole life
And without any supervision 've been doing it all on my own with no help and basically 've been white-knuckling it this whole time
23
That had to be hard
Yeah
It's a lot to deal with, especially when you don't know what the hell is happening, which  do now
Sort of
(

You gotta come see the baby
She's beautiful
And Veronica wants to make dinner for you
Congratulations on the baby, but 'm not buying the invitation
'Cause you think Veronica still hates you

Nikki always said that "Ronnie's wife keeps his social calendar where she keeps his balls, in her purse
" That's not true
' Ronnie

Okay, it's a little true
But if you think she still hates you, you're wrong because why would she tell me to invite you to dinner

'  - Tell me one thing
Would you like to be a guy who goes back to jail or to the hospital
Hmm
So take your medication and if you do fine, we'll reduce them
Nikki's waiting for me to get in shape and get my life in order, and then she's gonna be with me
And that's better than any medication
35
Pat, there's a possibility, and want you to be prepared for it, that she may not return
True love is about letting her go and seeing if she returns
In the meantime, if you listen to that song,  don't want you to fall apart
So get a strategy, okay
You need one
Let me say something,  gotta say something
Okay
This is what  believe to be true
This is what  learned in the hospital
You have to do everything you can, you have to work your hardest, and if you do, if you stay positive, you have a shot at a silver lining
Work on a strategy, okay

Well, Martin Van Buren, the eighth president of the United States of America, is from Kinderhook, New York

Can you forgive
Are you any good at that
63
/
'  - You seemed to have trouble last night
Let me just set the record straight about last night
Hurting my mother was a mistake and  hate myself for it, and  hate my illness and want to control it
My father, on the other hand, had no trouble slapping the shit out of me last night, which  did not return `cause  could've killed him and didn't
He's sixty-five years old
You don't think  could've beat the shit out of him
mean
He was scared for your mother and you hurt him as well
Yes, last night was a mess
Okay
And  think he probably just tried to do his best
Pat, you have to have a strategy told you earlier
You need to recognize these feelings coming to you, otherwise you will be sent back to Baltimore
So when you get these feelings, you need to get to a quieter place, and be at peace with yourself, however you can
Yeah, but that's easier said than done
You have to do it
You have no choice
Excelsior
Yeah, Excelsior
Listen,  have a letter  want you to give Nikki, okay
No
Why
64
Because you have a restraining order
() What good are you, man
Why did you have this overwhelming urgency to see your wedding video last night
Oh,  don't know, because 'm married and  haven't seen my wife in eight and a half months
Maybe you think that Nikki's not around and Tiffany's an attractive girl and if you get drawn towards Tiffany, you will spoil your chances of getting Nikki back to you
Not bad, Doctor Jones
But  don't think 'm gonna blow it with Nikki because Tiffany's a slut
Why is she a slut
After the dinner at Ronnie's, she said, quote, "We can go to the back house and you can fuck me as long as we turn the lights out
" Unquote
And she still wears her wedding ring
So she's a loyal, married-to-a-dead-guy slut
Maybe she just needs a friend and she thought if she offers you sex, it will be easier for you to become friends with her
She said she's not a whore anymore, but she likes that part of herself along with all the other parts of herself and can  say the same
Can you
65
Is that
You're asking me, you're really asking me that question
Yes
With all my crazy sad shit
What, are you fucking nuts
Pat, the silver lining thing is yours
'm just giving back your words to you
This "crazy sad shit," as you call it, made you a happier, calmer person with a beautiful positive philosophy of going outdoors, working out, and reading books
No, not the books
You said Nikki's friends with Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany
So if you become friends with Tiffany, Nikki will think that you're a kind, generous, large-hearted person, who helps people in need, who is basically thriving
So if you help Tiffany, it will be good for you
- , (
) Trick or treat
Hey
How do you know when  run
66
wanted to clarify something just want us to be friends
(Pat doesn't answer) Did you hear what  said
(Pat doesn't answer still) Why are you giving me such a hard time
No, 'm not giving you a hard time
don't know how to act with you when you do this shit
() You wanna have dinner at this diner
'
Pick me up at seven thirty

' '
Happy Halloween
Hi
, - 67
- , - Here you go
Thank you
,
'm gonna have a bowl of your Raisin Bran
'
Tea
Be right back
You look nice
Thanks
Raisin Bran
Milk
Thank you
You want to share this
Why did you order Raisin Bran
Why did you order tea
68
() Because you ordered Raisin Bran
ordered Raisin Bran because didn't want there to be any mistaking this for a date
() It can still be a date if you order Raisin Bran
It's not a date
So how's your thing going -- your dancing thing
It's good
How's your restraining order
wouldn't actually call the restraining order "my thing," but getting back with Nikki is, and 've been doing pretty well
Except for a minor incident at the doctor's office
And the so-called incident with the weights
Yeah
That was a thing with my parents
wish  could just explain it all in a letter to Nikki because it was minor and  could just explain it and let her know that 'm actually not out of control and that 'm actually doing really well
can get a letter to Nikki
see her sometimes with my sister
'
It would be so amazing if you could get a letter to Nikki from me
69
'd have to hide it from Veronica
She's not into breaking the law, which this letter would definitely be doing
But you would do it
'd have to be careful
'm already on thin ice with my family, you should hear how  lost my job
How did you lose your job
By
having sex with everybody in the office
Everybody
was very depressed after Tommy died
It was a lot of people
We don't have to talk about it
Thanks
How many were there
Eleven
Wow
know
'm not gonna talk about it anymore
Okay
Can  ask you one more question
Were there any women
70
Yes
Really
Yes
What was that like
Hot
Jesus Christ
Was it like
older women, a sexy teacher who wants to -- Made me sit on her lap and do things
Yeah
What
You sat on her lap
Mm-hmm
She told you what to do
Mm-hmm
Oh
my God
Nikki hated when talked like this
Made me feel like such a pervert
Maybe we should change the subject
don't mind it
You don't, do you
No
But then people were getting into fights in the parking lot at work, and in the bathroom
and the boss called me in to his office and tried to pin it all on me
So accused him of harassment and then they fired me, sent me home and put me on some meds
71
get it
The song that was playing when my wife
was in the shower with the history teacher
heard about that
it was my wedding song and when hear it,  go kinda crazy
Sometimes  hear it when it's not even playing
Wow
Yeah
So they put me on medication, which  feel ashamed of
Yeah
So  know
You do
just gotta get a strategy, you know
Me too
We'd better get back to the letter
Yeah, let's get back to the letter
What if you told Nikki when Veronica was in the bathroom
Yes
Yes, that could work
love that
Oh, my God, 'm gonna go home and write the letter right now
72
Can  at least finish my tea
Wait, what
My tea
Can  finish it
Wait a minute
Did Veronica tell Nikki about our dinner
Why would she do that
Was it a test
kinda got that feeling, yeah
Goddamn it
knew it
It was a test
How did  do
think  did pretty well
Yeah, she said you were cool, basically
"Basically"
Was  some percentage not cool
No, she said you were cool, but you know
No,  don't know
Sort of how you are
It's fine, relax
What do you mean
How am
What does that mean
Sort of like me
"Sort of like you"
hope to God she didn't tell Nikki that
Why
73
Because, it's just not right, lumping you and  together,  mean, it's just wrong
And Nikki wouldn't like that
Especially after all the shit you just told me
You think that 'm crazier than you
() () Because, well, we're different, -- Oh, my God
Ugh
You're killing me
You know what
Forget  offered to help you
Forget the entire fucking idea
`Cause that must have been fucking crazy because  am so much crazier than you
Keep your voice down
'm just the crazy slut with a dead husband

No,  don't
You told your therapist that you were in a superior mental illness category, didn't you
What
Hey, calm down
Hey-- Just leave me alone
75
Can  just explain myself, please
didn't want Nikki to think that was associated with that kind of sexual behavior because 've never done anything like that, okay
You may not have experienced the shit that  did
But you loved hearing about it, didn't you
You are afraid to be alive, you're afraid to live
You're a hypocrite

mean, people fight
Couples fight
We would fight, we wouldn't talk for a couple weeks
That's normal
She always wanted the best for me
Tiffany listens
(') She wanted me to be passionate and compassionate
And that's a good thing
You know
just, look, 'm my best self today, and  think she's her best self today, and our love's gonna be fucking amazing
It's gonna be amazing, and you're gonna be amazing, and she's gonna be amazing, and you're not gonna be that guy that's gonna take advantage of a situation without offering to do something back
So think about the dance thing

Okay, jailhouse lawyer, come on, let's come back and sit down the way you were before

You gotta be careful
She goes to a lot of therapy

What are you trying to say
'm just saying-- () ) Am  messed up

You judge everybody
You're the one who has a messed up marriage

She's unstable

When 'm with Nikki, 'm never gonna do stuff like that
(
) Whoa, Nikki
What's all this about Nikki
Pan from the framed photo of Jake on foyer wall, to Jake on the stairs above
(') restraining order is nothing to fool with, bro
[Walks down to Pat]
Holy shit, look at you
You are fit
You look absolutely amazing
You feel good
How you doing, Jake
Good
You look like Schwarzenegger in his prime
Didn't  say you wouldn't recognize him
So, listen, 'm sorry that  didn't come see you down at the hospital
You know how those places creep me out, and the firm's been expanding
've been helping Pop with the restaurant `cause he needs to have a legitimate business
He needs a tax return
With all the money that he's making with his bookmaking, they're gonna come after him
And then it looks like 'm making, 'm gonna make partner at the firm
Pat just stares at Jake
The room is silent
(') Well,  don't even know what to say to you anymore
You lost your wife, 'm getting engaged, and  wanna be able to tell you about those kind of things
You lost your house, 'm getting a new house
You lost your job, things are going great for me at the firm
94
Maybe stop talking about all the stuff that's good for you and bad for him
Just, you know, leave it alone
We're watching the game
You know what, 'm just gonna, 'm just gonna, 'm just gonna stop talking
'm gonna shut my mouth
Pat stares down Jake
Tense
As my friend Danny would say 00 The room hangs on Pat's words
(') got nothing but love for you, brother
That's right
That's right
/// (
) That's nice
That's nice
Well, thank God, finally
DeSean Jackson
Yeah
Did it fit
wore it to Ronnie's for dinner
Beautiful jersey
love that jersey
Veronica didn't like it
Veronica hates the jersey
Whatever you do, watch out for that restraining order, okay
95
'
'm not doing anything
Don't let Tiffany get you in trouble
Pat, you're up to something, know
People like Tiffany, or Danny, or me, maybe we know something that you guys don't know, okay
Did you ever think about that
Maybe we understand something because we're -- We have a sixth sense
mean, everybody's got it
Everybody's just not in touch with it
Oh, no
How you doing, Pat
Jesus
guess his sixth sense forgot to tell him the cops were coming
(: ) 'm taking him back to the hospital
What
No, no, he passed his thing, right
96
First of all, check with the latest legal development
Well, we got a call that they did convert you to a Mental Hygiene Law admission status by the deadline of your sentence, so
( ) Wait a minute
Are you an Eagles fan or are you not an Eagles fan
'm an Eagles fan
Well then, what's the problem
He's not goin' anywhere
Just let him finish the game, that's all
The handkerchief is working
We're killing the Seahawks, twenty-seven- ten
What's the matter with you
Let him stay, please
don't know what the hell you're talking about "the handkerchief"
And 'm glad that the Seahawks are losing and we're winning, but gotta take Danny McDaniels back to Baltimore, alright
He can contest his case from Baltimore
Not correct about the Mental Hygiene Law
You're not correct
Come on
You guys oughta be ashamed of yourselves
97
- ' , ' , ' /  - used the insurance money to build this
designed it
All the floors are hard oak
It has good bounce for dancers
Wow
'm not that great of a dancer, but who cares
It's therapy and it's fun
And the walls are good `cause can play music really loud without anybody hearing
Where do you sleep
Upstairs
It's a garage,  just renovated it
You know,  was thinking about putting a ballet barre here
When are you gonna give it to her
What
The letter to Nikki
Probably tonight
Really
98
Ronnie and Veronica and  are gonna see her tonight
Oh,  actually changed the first paragraph
did this thing about Shakespeare and how it's very - Mm-hmm
-and that maybe in the future if she wanted to go dancing,  can be able to do that because of all the -- () No, that's good, that's really good
assume you're a good teacher
'
Yeah
mean,  hope so
Maybe you can teach us both, you know what  mean
(') And  also mentioned how generous it is, what 'm doing for you
Yeah
Mm-hmm
It's really generous
You know, being of service
Yeah
To your need
Uh-huh
99
(') All right, let's start simple
Start at that corner, walk towards me
Walk across the room
Pat stands in the corner, doesn't move
Can we do something else besides the dance deal
Are you fucking kidding me
'm good with a hammer
You want me to fix something
deal is a deal
know
Okay
was just suggesting that maybe there's a better scenario
Why don't you walk towards me like 'm Nikki
And the only way to convey how much you've missed me is by your walk
By your slow walk
You can't talk
'm not doing it
Only walk
Do it
No
That's stupid
No walk, no letter
Walk to me like 'm Nikki, come on
Do it
'm Nikki
Come on
(under his breath) You're not Nikki
Don't look up until you're halfway here
100
(') That's right
(') Not yet
(') Yes
Do you feel that
That's emotion
don't feel anything
Has anybody ever told you how Tommy died
No
We were married for three years and five days, and  loved him
But for the last couple months,  just wasn't into sex at all
It just felt like we were so different and was depressed
Some of that is just me, some of it was he wanted me to have kids and  have a hard enough time taking care of myself
don't think that makes me a criminal
Anyway one night after dinner, he drove to Victoria's Secret at King of Prussia Mall and got some lingerie to get something going
And on the way back, he stopped on 76 to help a guy with a flat tire and he got hit by a car and killed
And the Victoria's Secret box was still in the front seat
(pause) That's a feeling
,  , ' "   " , : 101
(') Okay, this is the waltz
'm gonna teach you the waltz step
as she showed him, his hands on his shoulders

He wants me to have- ,

It's his living
Um, tell Dad thanks
Your father expects to spend time with you, Pat

) Hey, hey

You're not gonna read that shit on my time

" It's a bunch of boys on an island and they have a conch -- they have a shell -- and whoever has the conch has the power and they can talk
And if you don't have the conch, then you don't have the power
And then there's a little chubby boy, and they call him Piggy and they're really mean, and then there's a murder
mean, humanity is just nasty and there's no silver lining
Wow
That was a great synopsis still need to read it, though
(') Who's that
104
(') What the
(laughing) What are you doing here, man
If one of your two supervising physicians loses their license, then your whole ajudication is thrown out
How'd you know we were here
went by your parents' house looking for you and they told me you was over here
Danny, this is Tiffany
(to Tiffany) Tiffany, this is Danny
Hello
Pat told me about you
So is the girl, that you wrote about
Yeah
What
He wrote about me
'm "the girl"
He wrote about you, all right
What'd he say
He said you guys was helping each other out and you were nice and had a mouth on you, that you were mouthy, but-- Whoa, whoa, that's enough
No, please, tell me more about what he said in the letter
105
Yeah, anything you wanna know, 'll just tell you
It was nothing
It was just a very general letter
Cool
(looks at Tiffany) She's fine
She is my friend with an "
" capital "
" For "friend
" The three stand there awkwardly for a beat
Hey, can  see what you guys are doing
Yeah
Okay

(') And then this goes into something else
That's it
Why
What is it, what is it, what is it
Can  say something
Do you mind
No
You sure
Just say it
Say it
106
No, please
think Pat, you should be facing Tiffany
,
(') Let me show you, Pat, let me show you what  mean
You gotta come at her with a little bit more soul, man
(') ( ) You should move more hips
,
(') ( ) Just, just sort of come in, Pat, come in like this
And
,
Okay
Yeah
Can you move `em a little bit more
Yeah, that's it
Move `em a bit more

Yeah
You're pretty good

(') () Mm, yeah

Okay, we got it, we got it
107
Okay
Okay

(') Come on, Pat, come on

Black it up, Pat
"Black it up"
You know damn well what it means
(') Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
Oh, man

, (') Come get some, Pat
Come get some
: (') Shuffle back, shuffle back
Shuffle back, shuffle back
Girl, you gotta move your junk
' (') gotta get out of here
gotta go see this girl, Tanya

Excelsior, Pat
Excelsior
That's my man
/ - ,
'
Hey
Patty
(') Pat
(') Patty
Where have you been
Huh
(') We got a serious situation on our hands, you know that
Pat looks concerned, he could be in trouble
(') We gotta beat the Giants if we wanna have a chance of getting into the division, any chance of playing in the playoffs
Do you realize that
didn't realize that
109
Yeah, that's the bind we're in mean,  think it would be wise if we spent father-son time, reading about the Eagles, talking about them, just to strengthen the good luck thing that you're in
Okay
Yeah
Right
Hmm
(') just wanted to, maybe  didn't, spend enough time with you growing up
spent too much time with your brother
It might have made you feel worse about your behavior, but didn't know anything,  didn't know how to handle it
mean, that's what all this Eagles stuff is about
It's about us, spending time now
wanna do everything can to help you get back on your feet
That's the whole point
Yeah
wish you'd watch these games with me so we could talk, we could get into things
(inhales) So would you, would you just come downstairs and talk to me and Randy now
'
, ,
/ - ,
Randy, tell him what 'm doing
He's betting everything on the Giant game
Everything
110
(') All the money that he needs for the restaurant, he's betting on the Giant game
Tell him why
Because he believes in you
Is that true
believe in you, Patty
believe in you
want you to know that
So 'm gonna bet heavy on this game
(') You understand
Yeah
Heavy
want you to go to the game with your brother
You want me to go to the game with Jake
Of course  do
Does he want me to go
Of course he wants you to go
He told you that
He told me, yes
Even with all his friends
With all his friends
He trusts you
111
He's not embarrassed
No
'd love to go to the game, too, but as you know, 'm banned from the stadium
`Cause 'd love to see us beat the Giants and take a lot of money from this asshole
Listen, personally,  think it's a stupid bet
As a matter of fact, think it's ridiculous to bet all that dough for the restaurant on a game
Randy
(to Pat)  just hope you heard what  said
It's like a family business, it's our family endeavor
We all stick together on this
That's how it works
That's a positive, positive vibe
made a commitment to Tiffany about a project, and we have a very important part of it that we have to go over on Sunday, and it's good for me, Dad
It's making me disciplined and focused, and it's, it's--,  never would've thought this, but it's a good thing
What is this thing you're doing
Yeah, what is it
What is this project, hon
It's a dance thing, okay
There's nothing more to it, Dad
swear
,
' /  - Listen,  need to ask you something
() 112
(') Tomorrow can  spend half the day with you and half the day at the Eagles game
'm gonna pretend that you didn't just ask me that
Why
These are the two days that you have promised me and that we have prepared to nail the big move
It's not ready yet
And we don't have a move yet
know, but my dad opened up to me and it was really beautiful and wanna be of service to him, okay
And he's worried that the juju from the Eagles is being fucked up and he's concerned that it's because 'm spending time with you
Oh,  messed up the Eagles' juju
No, you're not messing up the juju, but the juju is messed up because 'm not with him during the games
Guess what
What
Nikki replied to your letter
,
(') () But you can't read it until after you nail the big move
Go
, : ' --      --   -- --
,
113
Tiff, 'm sorry
can't do anything else without reading Nikki's letter, okay
It's just--, it's in the back of my head
We don't almost have it, all right
just hope you can handle it
Thank you
(') What was her energy when she gave it to you
She was intrigued, excited, and a little scared
She was scared
About what
Did she tell you
,
Try to stay positive
'
'm just gonna read it out loud, okay
Because if she says anything that's, you know, is that too much to ask
No
,
(') thought you were gonna read it out loud
Okay
Sorry
() () 114
(') "Dear Pat, It was very emotional for me to get your letter, as 'm sure you can imagine, but 'm glad you took the risk of discreetly getting it to me through Tiffany
This gives us a chance to communicate while  keep the restraining order until  feel safe
must admit you sound terrific and 'm happy that you are feeling so positive and becoming a more loving and caring man, which always knew you were
was moved to read about `Excelsior' and your belief in happy endings
am also moved by your act of love to read the books  have taught at the high school
'm sorry you find them so negative, but  disagree
think they are great works of art that reflect how hard life can be and they can also help kids prepare themselves for the hardness of life
In spite of all these positive developments, Pat,  have to say if it's me reading the signs,  need to see something to prove you are ready to resume our marriage
Otherwise  find myself thinking that we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately
Please don't react quickly to this, but take time to think about it
'm glad you're doing so well
Love, Nikki
" He is kind of crying
(') think 'm done for today, okay
(follows him to door) She said to show her something, Pat
This dance can be that something
You would have never done something like this in a million years
It shows all kinds of skills on so many different levels: focus, collaboration, discipline
It's romantic, like said it would be
It's for her
(over his shoulder) Thanks for the letter
'll see you tomorrow, okay
115
- (indistinct chatter - continues under following scenes ) '  - Can  use your phone
Is it an emergency
Yeah, kind of
What kind of emergency
Well, 'm just doing this project with Tiffany and  wanted to tell her 'm not gonna be on time
Just don't make her an emergency, that crazy girl, you know
She's not crazy -- 'll just borrow Jake's phone
It's too bad you can't come in to the stadium, but know you were kicked out, you know, for beating everybody up
Guess we're not that different, huh, Dad
That a bad thing
No,  think, it's a good thing
Don't drink too much
Don't hit anybody

Who's this
We need to talk right now
When you make a serious commitment to somebody, it is not cool to not show up
Wait a second,  tried to call, my God, what's happening,  called--, but  tried to call you, Tiffany, -- Who is this
What is this
Oh, really
123
Yes
(') told you  was gonna split my time with my dad and you, and my dad was pulling me in one direction
Doctor Patel, Ronnie-- Well, that sounds great, Pat
That's great for all of them, but all of them didn't make a commitment to me in return for my help
'm Tiffany, by the way
What is this craziness with Tiffany Maxwell
There's no craziness
told you who she was,  was doing this thing with her
We had a conversation
She's fucking nuts
When you started spending time with her, it all fell apart
This is the fucking reason right here
You think  fucked up the Eagles' juju, don't you
Ever since, ever since he was with you, ever since-- () You think that 'm why today's happened
That's right, you are why today happened
'm the reason why today happened
think so
Let's talk about that
124
Be my guest
The first night that Pat and  met at my sister's, the Eagles beat the Forty Niners handily, forty to twenty-six
The second time we got together we went for a run and the Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to five in the
She's right, Dad
The next time we went for a run the Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty- seven to fourteen
Wow
The third time we got together we had Raisin Bran in the diner and the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in the fourth game of the World Series, ten to two
Oh, wow
Let me think about that
Wait a minute
Well, why don't you think about when the Eagles beat the Seahawks, fourteen to seven
He was with you
He was with me
We went for a run
Really
That's crazy
125
There have been no games since Pat and  have been rehearsing every day and if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants
She's making a lot of sense, Pop
That's all right on all counts
Does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of the state of New York is on the official seal of the State of New York
Huh
Anybody
(to Pat Sr
) Do you
Do you know
"Excelsior
" Look it up
Yeah, "Excelsior
" Oh Pat
Not that  give a fuck about football or about your superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs,  don't send the Eagles guy whose personal motto is "Excelsior," to a fucking Giants game, especially when he's already in a legal situation
Unbelievable
Wow
How did you know all that stuff
did my research
Well,  gotta say, 'm impressed
Thank you
gotta rethink this whole thing didn't trust it before, but  gotta say, now  do
126
Oh, now you like her, Dad
have to say  do
Yup
Patrizio,  feel terrible, you know
You made the bet,  won a lot of money, and now look, your whole family is in turmoil
Oh, fuck off, Randy
You love it
You live for this shit
You've been betting against my father for years
Is that right
You're twisting the knife right now
You get off on it
That's bullshit
That's not true
Don't say that
You get off on it
If not, then prove it
Prove it
Yeah, prove it, prove it
How do you want me to prove it
How's he gonna prove it
By giving them the chance to win back everything, double or nothing
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Double or nothing on the Bengals, next week
Is that what you're saying
No
127
She pauses, turns dramatically to Randy
(') Against the Cowboys
(') That's your team isn't it, Randy
That's his team
know who his team is
When is the game
December twenty-eight, last game of the season
Oh, my God
Same day as the Benjamin Franklin Pairs Open Freestyle Dance Competition
Oh God
Randy,  thought they were America's Team
Don't you believe in America's Team
Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in America's Team
Yeah,  believe in America's Team but if  win that bet,  win your book, you're out of action, you get no restaurant, no nothing
like it
No
No, Patrizio-- 128
believe in the Eagles,  believe in my son, 'll take the action
'll take it
Dad
Patrizio, don't
It's toxic
have faith,  have faith
Excelsior belongs in this house-- -- --not in the State of New York
In this house
Dad, listen to me
didn't know that "Excelsior" was the state motto of New York, okay
didn't know, either, but now know
know, but listen to me, this is toxic
Dad, Dad, Dad, this is toxic, you shouldn't be doing this, you shouldn't be doing-- Randy, what do you say-- (to Pat) Be quiet, shut up
You already did enough
(to Randy) Randy, what do you say
My birds, Benjamin Franklin's team favored by one and a half points
'll give you three more
Patrizio, stop it
And Randy, don't you take the bet
In fact, 'll give you ten points
No, Dad
Dad
129
Dad
You have to take that bet on the Cowboys
Dolores, would you stop him
Jesus
How could you not take that bet
Even with the ten points  give you, that's an insane spread to your advantage
Cowboys are cowards
And 'll bet you're such a coward, you won't take the ten
Plus, are you listening, plus whatever their score is at the dance thing
(to Tiffany) What's that
Tiffany, what's that
What
No, no, no, no
You're crazy to give away that many points
That's ridiculous
won't take that
However, wait a second
do like the idea of a parlay
What
No parlay
No
No, don't do it
Don't do it
Pat, how do they run this dance competition
mean, how do they score it and everything
don't know,  don't know how they fucking score
We're participating
We're not, we're not a part of it
There are people, this is a high- end dance contest
don't know
Do not put it as part of the parlay, Randy
Don't-- 130
They go by the Philadelphia rules
Each dancer is scored on a scale of one to ten, ten being the highest
You have to average the four judges' scores
Okay, score is from one to ten, right
And you guys are how good
We suck
We don't suck
Pat's a beginner, 'm okay, we're happy just to be going there
And how are the people you're competing against
They're good
Some of them are professionals
They're good
Better than you
Pause
Tiffany says nothing
lot better
lot better
So if  was to say you only have to score five, would be really very generous, right
No, no, that would be amazing if we got five
Let's not get away-- Oh, come on, we can get a five out of ten
Gimme a break
Gimme me a break
We can't get five
Give `em a five
Give `em a five
131
We can do a five
What are you talking about, Dad
You haven't even seen us dance
That's the parlay
Will somebody please explain to me the parlay
Please
You gotta win two bets or you lose the whole thing
For Pat Sr
to win, the birds gotta beat the Cowboys plus Pat and Tiffany gotta get at least a five at the dance
That's very, very manic indeed
That's the parlay
Shake on it
You know what
'm not gonna be a part of this
(to Randy) Randy, Randy, you're a sickness
You're a fucking sickness, Randy
'm out
Pat, you can't quit
'm not doing the dance
'm out
Pat, calm down
Thank about it
See you later
Pat, no
What are you doing
Pat
132
( ) 'm out
( ) Here we are again at the one yard line
DeSean, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory
There you go
What does that even mean, Dad
'm not gonna make that, that, that connection that you're making with DeSean Jackson
It doesn't matter anymore okay
Just because  have the fucking jersey on
'm not gonna do it
'm sorry
You are not a stand up guy right now
If it's me reading the signs
if it's me reading the -- If it's you reading the signs
You're reading the signs
Oh, okay
Pat
You are not a stand up guy
Pat
/  - told you not to push it
Yeah, but he's gotta do this thing
He can't be a quitter
He cannot be a quitter
133
() You took that stupid parlay thing, and now he won't do the dance and it was very constructive for him, and you ruined it
There's only one way to get him to show
What's that
Oh, what's that
We have to tell him Nikki's gonna be there
They stare at her
/  - , , ' -
-
/ - She won't come
She can't come
We have to tell him that she's coming
We have to tell him that she's going
But that's a lie
It's a white lie
134
It's a white lie, what's that matter
That's no big deal
So it's a little lie
There's no other way
You know, we gotta leave a trail of bread crumbs so that he can live his life without ruining it
No
don't approve
You can't do it
Well, you know,  didn't approve when you called her and you told her where he was running, so she could ambush him
didn't approve of that, but you did it anyway, so 'm doing this anyway
That's it
We're gonna tell him Nikki'll be there
( ) You gotta be part of it
We have to do it
Aren't you nervous to be lying
Yeah
little bit
But it's for the best

Well, you knew that
Maybe you should've scouted `em

That's all

She'll see how well he's doing, maybe she'll lift the restraining order
Oh, my God
