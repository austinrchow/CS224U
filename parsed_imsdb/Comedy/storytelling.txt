Vi and Marcus finish making love
Marcus has cerebral palsy
Hey, you want to hear my short story now
Huh
(lifts a  from a shelf by his bed) can read it to you
You mean, again
Well,  changed the ending a little
Oh
What happens now
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer
think it's better
More
raw
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context
think you should leave it the way it was
It was good
Pause
So you don't want to hear my new ending
You'll read it in class tomorrow
Surprise me
(beat) Anyway,  have to go
promised Melinda 'd help her with her oral
She rises, starts dressing
You're tired of me
can tell
Marcus, 'm tired
That's all
You've lost interest
You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex
was never much of a sweater
You know that
Look, Vi,  don't blame you
You feel You feel pity now
The pleasure isn't there any more
The kinkiness has gone
You've become kind
- It is bright and sunny
'  - Mr Scott, who is black, presides over his class
Marcus is reading from his story, Vi at his side
Catherine, a stunning intellectual, sits near the teacher
The rest of the students (Amy, Elli, etc
) listen closely and take notes
"
but when he saw her
it was as if he could walk like a normal person
His legs didn't swing, his arms didn't spaz away
He wasn't a freak any more, for she made him forget his affliction
No more cerebral palsy
From now on  "" stood for
cerebral person
He was a cerebral person
Pause
Marcus and Vi exchange looks
thought it was really good, Marcus
Really moving and emotional
Yeah,  thought it was really emotional, too
And  mean, really good word choices
It kind of reminded me a little of Faulkner, but East Coast and disabled
Or Flannery 'Connor
She had multiple sclerosis
And Borges
He was blind
Pause
Updike has psoriasis
Pause
Um
Maybe 'm wrong, but, um, 'm afraid  found the whole thing to be a little trite
Its earnestness is, well
it's a little embarrassing
And those adjectives, they're a little flatfooted
And redundant
'm sorry, but
Anyway, what do know
Don't even listen to what say
mean
Pause
Anyone else
No response
Catherine is right
The story's a piece of shit
You express nothing but banalities and, formally speaking, are unable to construct a single compelling sentence
You ride on a wave of cliches so worn, in fact, it actually approaches a level of grotesquerie
Ad your subtitle, 'the rawness of truth' is that supposed to be a joke of some sort
Or are you just being pretentious
(beat; then checking his class book) Who's next
- Marcus, upset, rushes outside, Vi in pursuit, desperately trying to console
Marcus, wait up
Marcus stops
What do you want
Don't be so upset
It's
What the fuck are you talking about
What's
(beat) You know he hated my story also
Your story was terrible
He moves on, she keeps up with him
Marcus
You'll write something better next time
Patronizing fuck
If you had just been honest with me in the first place  wouldn't have read it knew it was shit
But - idiot
- believed you
That's not fair
was honest
Just because  wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine
Well,  sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered
admit it -  was scared
was shocked, in fact , by what he said
And he's so
convincing
'm sorry if  let you down, but really,  still say he's just one opinion
don't even like his books that much
They're all so aggressively confrontational don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize
Catherine and Mr Scott walk by together in the distance
You just want to fuck him
Like Catherine and every other white cunt on campus
He leaves her
'   - Melinda lies on her bed with some homework, watching Vi
(
) (on phone) But Marcus
You can't just unilaterally decide to end things
This is a relationship we're talking about
friendship
You don't just
Fuck you
She hangs up and enters her bedroom, in tears
(cont'd) Fuck him
Fuck him
Fuck him
Vi
Are you
Yes
'm
'm totally
Melinda rises, puts a hand on her shoulder
You did the right thing
know that
Fucking cripple
Why do  waste my time with undergrads
They're all so
juvenile
Uch
just thought Marcus would be different mean he's got
Pause
What are you gonna do now
dunno
go to a bar
get laid
whatever
Don't worry about me
'll be fine
She starts changing into a new outfit
- Students hang around outside
Vi goes inside
- Vi walks up to the bar
Can  have a beer
After getting her beer, Vi turns around and suddenly notices Mr Scott, who is sitting alone
She goes over to him
(cont'd) Hi
Hello, Vi
What are you doing here
What are you doing here
'm sorry
didn't mean,  just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all
Well, now you have
Vi laughs, sort of, ten blushes
Yeah, um, then
are you alone
Uh huh
Can  join you
Mr Scott gestures for her to sit down with him
(cont'd) Gee, thanks
Well, um
just wanted to say that 'm really happy with the class and, um
know you must here this all the time, but 'm also a great admirer of your work Sunday Lynching, especially
really, um spoke to me
God,  hope 'm not embarrassing you
You're not
Good
(beat) 'Cause
um
really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was
That's good
And  also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story
It is a piece of shit
Pause
You have beautiful skin
Thank you
(beat) So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer
Maybe
She's
Pause
Aren't you going out with Catherine
(beat) 'm sorry
It's none of my business
didn't mean
'm not 'going out' with Catherine
Oh
(beat) Do you think  have a potential as a writer
No
Thank you for being honest
Mr Scott leans over and touches her hand
have so much respect for you
- Mr Scott and Vi walk together in silence
'  - Vi and Mr Scott enter
He turns around and looks at her
Pause
Can  just freshen up for a second
He indicates the direction of the bathroom
It's over there
Thanks
'  - Vi enters, locks the door behind her
She looks at herself in the mirror, then notices a snapshot of Catherine: she is naked, legs open wide
Other erotic photographs lie beneath Catherine's
(to herself, almost chanting) Don't be a racist
Don't be a racist
Don't be a racist
'  - Vi emerges from the bathroom to find Mr Scott lounging on the bed
It's a really nice place you have
Is the rent high
Take off your top
She obliges
Now
take off the rest
She does, and he looks hard at her
Finally he rises
Turn around
She does
Bend over
He starts making love to her, from behind
(cont'd) (whispers) Say, 'nigger, fuck me
' Oh, bu
uh
can't say that
Say, Ni
Ni
gger
gger
Say, 'Nigger
' Nigger
'Fuck me hard
' Fuck me hard
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard
' Nigger, fuck me hard
Again
Nigger, fuck me hard
Again
,
'  - Lights are out
'   - Marcus looks in the mirror, ponders his reflection
Freak
There is a soft knock at the door
He turns  away from the mirror and opens it
Vi is there, teary-eyed, disheveled
Can  come in
They embrace
You're all
sweaty
- Vi finishes reading her story to the class
'
So John flipped her around and slammed her against the wall
Jane braced herself: she thought about her mother
She thought about Peter
She thought about God
and rape
''Say, 'Fuck me, nigger
Fuck me hard
''' John's flesh abraded her soft skin
There would be marks
She acquiesced, and said what he asked her to say, and did what he asked her to do
She had entered college with hope, with dignity, but she would graduate as a whore
' Silence
Why do people have to be so ugly
write about such ugly characters
It's perverted
know you all think 'm being prisssy, but  don't care
was brought up in a certain way
And this is
mean-spirited
Pause
Yeah, well, it did seem a little affected
Like by using taboo language you were trying to shock us about the hollowness of your characters
think it was a little bit racist
It was completely racist, and beyond that  felt deeply offended as a 	woman
As if a woman can only operate from experiences of objectification
Totally phallocentric
And so weirdly misogynistic mean, why does Jane go through with this
Is she stupid
Hey, But wasn't this a rape
Or did  miss something
Because - 'm confused
Because if this was a rape, then why would she be a whore
(beat) It was confessional, yet dishonest
Jane pretends to be horrified by 	the sexuality that she in fact fetishizes
She subsumes herself to the myth of black male potency, but then doesn't follow through
She thinks she 'respects Afro-Americans,' she thinks they're 'cool,' 'exotic,' what a notch he 'd make in her belt, but, of course, it all comes down to mandingo cliche, and he calls her on it
In classic racist tradition she demonizes, then runs for cover
But then, how could she behave otherwise
She's just a spoiled suburban white girl with a Benneton rainbow complex
It's just my opinion, and what do know
but  think it's a callow piece of writing
Callow and coy
Jane wants more, but isn't honest enough to admit it
In the end, she returns to the safety of her crippled (translation: sexually impotent) boyfriend
This is bullshit
Her story was the truth
Right
It's unbelievable
It's cliched
It's disgusting
But it happened
Silence
don't know about 'what happened,' Vi, because once you start writing, it  all becomes fiction
Still, it certainly is an improvement over your last story: There is now at least a beginning, a middle, and an end
: '' '  - Lower East Side tenement apartment
dogma '95 poster hangs above the bed
Toby, down and out and in his thirties, leafs through his high-school yearbook
He reads an inscription: 'Toby,  just know you're going to become a movie star
Please don't forget me when you make it to the top
will always love you - Pam'
He picks up his phone and dials
(
) Hello
Hello, is this Pam
(
) Who is this
Toby Oxman
(
) Toby -
Oh, hi
How are you
Oh, fine
How are you
(
) Great
Great
(
) So what's going on
That's what  was gonna ask you
(
) But
you called
Oh, yeah, well
um
was just calling because, well,  was wondering if you still remembered me, which  guess you do
(
) Yeah
Pause
So
Look at where we are: the year 2000
Can you believe it
mean, did you ever think we would actually make it
(
) Um, well, yeah
(beat) So are you still acting
Oh, no, not any more
No, um, kind of came to terms with myself, realized  had done what  had to do
And it was time to move on
(
) Oh
So what did you do after you gave up on acting
Well,  went to law school, if you can believe that
Mike, Toby's roommate and cameraman, enters looking for a towel, then goes to take a shower
(
) believe it
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh
so  dropped out
(
) Oh, that's too bad
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing
(
) Anything  might know about
Well, um,  kind of let things go on this novel 'd been really into -  mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt mean, really, it's finished
(
) That's too bad
worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but,  mean, that was like -  mean,  have some dignity
(
) That's good
So then what do you do now
'm a documentary filmmaker
(
) Oh
Anything  might have seen
-not yet
'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers
Geez, remember when we were teenagers
(
) Yeah
You didn't wanna take me to the prom
Oh,  don't remember that
(
) do
Well, but it was so long ago
We were so different back then
No response
(') Uh, well, anyway, so 'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia
Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology
wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration
But everything's still kind of in development at this point
(
) Hunh
(beat) work in a shoe store right now
But it's cool
'm not ashamed mean, really,  have a much stronger sense of self now
And, uh, anyways, it's really very temporary
(
) That's good
Yeah
um
so anyway, tell me
What about you
'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies
(
) Yeah
But not any more
Oh
Tired of 'life in the fast lane'
No response
(') Yeah
So you're um
you're married
(
) Yeah
Huh
Kids
(
) Yeah
How many
(
) Three
Great
How old are they
(
) Eight, six, and four
Wow, that really is great
In a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary
Pause
(
) Listen, Toby,  can't really talk right now
Do you mind if  call you back
Yeah, sure
(
) Bye
(to himself, after pause) Maybe she has caller
- It is bright and shiny
(
) Do you have any hobbies
'  - Scooby, seventeen, and Mr DeMarco, the guidance counselor, sit opposite each other
No, not really
Any books you like to read for fun
No
None at all
How about those 'underground' comics
hate reading
(beat) All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush
With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere
'
' So you just don't care
(beat) Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but
as a friend: what do you want to do with your life
mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have
dunno
'mon
Talk to me
Tell me what you're thinking
Well,  mean
wanna be on
Maybe have a talk show or something
Like Conan
Or early Letterman
Ah-hah
And how is it you hope to achieve this goal
dunno
See if  have any connections
The sprinkler system is still on
The family is sitting waiting at the table: , Scooby's attractive mother; , his bullish father; , sixteen, his handsome jock brother; and , ten his smart youngest brother
, the maid, brings some bread to the table
Did you knock on his door
Yes, but he just shouted at me and used the f-word
Scooby
Dinner
No response
Pause
Would anyone be interested in being hypnotized after dinner
// No
Pause
Let's just start
They eat
don't know what's wrong with that kid
Maybe he's gay
Don't ever say that
What if he is
He isn't
Marty, ignore him
He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports
Brady
Pause
And even if he is
Pause
Gay people are people too, you know
You're just being prejudiced
don't care is he's gay
'm cool
mean, it's not like  have to share his room or anything
just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner
Maybe he's building a bomb
just like-
Don't even joke about that
'm serious
What happens if he blows up the school
tense pause, followed by a distant crushing sound
(
) Fuck
'm going in there
Scooby appears
Was anyone in my room today
Is everything
My  case like totally collapsed
'm gonna have to recatalogue all weekend
(sitting down) Hey
Can you pass the salad over
(beat) Steak's really good tonight
(beat) Good
Got a lot of homework
dunno
Whaddya mean you don't know
You either got a lot or you don't
What's not to know
Marty
(beat) You started filling out your college applications yet
'm not going to college
Pause
What are you going to do
dunno
What  you know
Dad, 'm trying to figure things out right now,
It's like, really hard, and 'm just listening to some old Elton John and
Brady mouths: 'Gay
' Out
Leave the table
What
You heard me: leave the table
(rising) Man,  am out of here
This family is so fucked
Brady leaves
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and  can't
Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up
Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair
- red sports car drives up front
Esposito, Brady's buddy, drops off Brady and Cheryl, Brady's cheerleader girlfriend
cleaning woman walks along the sidewalk on her way to the bus stop
'll talk to you later, man
Yo, dude
Thanks, Esposito
Brady, still in his football outfit, tracks in some dirt
Cheryl follows him to his room, giggling
Mikey sits on the sofa while Consuelo continues her housework
Consuelo
Yes, Mikey
Do you have any brothers or sisters
Yes
Really
How many
Four brothers and five sisters
Wow
(beat) Why did your parents have so many children
mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two
It was God's will
But do you really believe in God
And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff
(beat) No
The Livingstons are eating dinner
So
How was school today
The same
The same
Same as what
Just the same
tense pause
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies
Oh, yeah
We did the same thing last year also
How was the class
Well, 'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework
The movie's like almost four hours
And then 'm supposed to write a report on survivors
(to Marty) You know any survivors, Dad
Hmmm
Do  know any
personally
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor
He was in a concentration camp
Well, no
But he had to escape the Nazis
But  thought he came over to America before the war
Well, he did
With his family
But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed
And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed
So in my book he's a survivor
Even though it was only his cousins that were killed
But that could've happened to him
Or to me, if 'd been alive
Or you
Or me
You mean, then, we're all survivors
Well
yes
If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe
We would have been
European
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe
if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born
long pause
Get the hell outta here
(rising) Man, it's just, like, conversation
' Toby sits across from Mr Kirk
Tell me: you make a living at this
Well, sir
uh
'm actually not doing this for the money
When you make a documentary, you do it for many reasons, but money is certainly not one of them
don't get it
Well, sir, a lot has happened to the landscape of the suburban high school since  was a student, and feel it would be a valuable, perhaps even enlightening endeavor, to chronicle the changes, to get intimate with the realities kids and parents face in American schools today
Yeah, well, whatever
'll let you know if there's interest
- Toby pauses by the receptionist before leaving
Excuse me, where's the bathroom
Toby rushes to the urinal
Scooby is sitting in a corner, smoking a joint, observing him
Toby smells the pot, turns and smiles at him
You a pervert
No
Actually, 'm a documentary filmmaker
Oh
You mean, like, Blair Witch Project
Well, no
'm doing one on high school students, in fact
What for
Well
it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine
Is this to like get into Sundance
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it
Doubt it
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel
Whoopee
and  have also shown some interest
Pause
So you have connections
The lights are on
(
) You see, we're trying to do a film on suburban lifestyles
Toby sits in the living room surrounded by the Livingston family
Marty fingers a card that reads:  ,
His address and phone number are printed below
kind of An American Family for the new millennium
thought this was about kids getting into college
Oh, it is
mean Which is it
You gotta keep your focus straight
You're absolutely right
The focus is on the college admissions process today
Pause
And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds
Oh, well,  don't have them yet, but Either Scooby is the focus, or forget it
Yeah,  thought  was the focus
wanna be the focus
Brady slaps him
Toby, we need this to be a positive experience
Well,  suppose  could reconceive
Reconceive
'Cause Scooby does have a quality that 've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today
It's part disillusionment, part hope
Consuelo comes in with tea and Twinkies
Twinkeys
Boys, take napkins
Napkins
Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this
(laughs) Don't worry, he doesn't mean money
Oh,  know,  know that
Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can  hope, be an illuminating experience
Yeah
How do we know we won't be exploited
No, it's true
Mr Livingston,  fully understand and  share your concerns
You fell vulnerable
And  know that this is a very difficult question, but what it comes down to is: can you make a leap of faith in me, in the same way that  have to make a leap of faith in you
: Big Esposito, in football attire, surrounded by Brady and other athletes, talks to Toby
Kids whip towels at each other in the background
This is a great school
don't care what anybody says
mean, it's not perfect, but like the people are really cool, like the teachers and kids
they really care and all
And  know that they make fun of New Jersey all the time, but  don't care
'Cause they're just snobs
'Cause Jersey is where America's at
: (
) Walking down these hallways just like the ones  once walked down as a teenager,  couldn't help thinking back to a time when every day  woke up depressed, suicidal, consumed by despair
Had things changed
Was the competition to get into the most prestigious schools still a requisite rite of passage
Beneath these masks of courtesy and friendliness  knew that there were darker forces at work
and  knew that Scooby was the key to revealing the truth
looking pensive
(
) Scooby, Scooby, Scooby
What are you thinking
College, SATs, your parents, your brothers, your friends
How is it you deal with all this stress
: school psychologist sits at her desk
The pressure to get into the college of your choice is incredible
You know, they did a study recently of the youth in Bosnia during the bombing, and they found that the stress the young people experienced there was less than what American high- school students go through when applying to college
(
) Is that right
Yes
(
) Oh, my God
Toby and his editor examine the footage on an
So whaddya think
Well, 'm not really sure what you're trying to say
It's funny, suppose
But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are
'm not making fun
'm showing it as it really is
You're showing how superior you are to your subject
No, but  like my subject
like these people
No, you don't
Yes,  do
love them
Pause
The camerawork's nice
Thanks
'll tell Mike
(beat) Well, it's still just a beginning
know  can
dig deeper
It is bright and sunny
Fern is in the kitchen talking on the phone
She has a list of names and notes in front of her
Consuelo dusts in the background
Toby and Mike stand nearby with a video camera, recording everything
but Marj  may  call you Marj
what it really boils down to is
what does it mean to be a Jew
Exactly
Tzedakah
Charity
And the new wing at Beth Israel is
Well, actually, last year you gave $500
But this year $1,000 would not only be a mitzvah, it would bring you to a new level
Yes, of course
Your gift would also give you a Chagall menorah and two tickets to the dinner dance this spring
Because it's true: Israel needs us now
If not now, when
Well, that's wonderful
'll speak to you next week
You too
Take care
She hangs up just as Scooby walks inside, fresh from school
Hi, Scooby
How was school today
Fine
Ready for tomorrow
What's tomorrow
The SATs, knucklehead
'm not taking them
He walks off
: The family is eating dinner
There is a tense silence, finally broken by Mikey
Mom
Yes, Mikey
was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and  took one of the practice tests
Guess what score  got
What
550 verbal, 520 math
And 'm only in fifth grade
Everyone turns to glare at him
' Scooby is brushing his teeth when Marty enters
Scooby
Yeah
We have to talk
Pause
Whaddya wanna talk about
Don't screw around with me
You know what 'm talking about
(beat) You're taking those SATs
You're taking those SATs or your collection is history
You're taking those SATs and you're going to college
You're taking those SATs if  have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them
Pause
(under his breath as he starts walking away) Tired of this shit
- Toby and Mike shoot footage of the students as they take their SATs
Scooby is filling out his  in such a way that he creates a pattern of filled blanks that spells:
Toby and Mike are interviewing Brady and Cheryl in the driveway
Off to the side, Mikey tries hypnotizing a cat
So are you surprised that Scooby took the SATs after all
Not really
He's kind of a wuss
How about you, Cheryl
Were you surprised
dunno
Whatever
Hmm
Hey, how come you drive such a shitty car
Yeah
(joins their laughter) don't know
That's interesting, though
cool car
Is that something that's real important to you, Brady
Yeah
Uh duh
' Scooby handles a gun his friend Stanley has given him
Pretty cool, Stanley
Thanks
How'd you get it
It's my Dad's He hides it under some old  Guides in his closet
Gee, your Dad's smart
know
Is it loaded
No,  don't think so
Scooby points it at his head
Scooby, don't
Be careful
'm not an idiot, man
watch
Know
'm sorry
'm just
a little nervous,  don't know why
You should be
Scooby points it at Stanley, gets a terrified reaction, then tosses the gun aside
Here
You can keep it
He lies down
Pause
Scooby
Yeah
You know
like you
Yeah
know
mean
know
Everyone knows
Oh
(beat) Do you think that you'd let me
um
Pause
If you feel like it
Just give me a second
He pulls a bag of mushrooms out from beneath his night table, takes some and offers to Stanley
You want some
No, thanks
Scooby flicks on a , then lies down
While Stanley goes down on Scooby, the camera pans away from Scooby to reveal Marty and Fern being burned at the stake in the front yarn, writhing and screaming in agony
'm so sorry
should never have made you take the SATs
The camera then pans to reveal Conan 'Brien approaching
Hey, Scooby
How's it going
Conan 'Brien
Whoa
What are you doing here
'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show
Any suggestions
'll be your guest
Really
Well, all right
Let's take a look at the television and see how we look
The camera pans to reveal a  standing on the lawn
Cool
Conan turns on the  and we move inside it to see Conan and Scooby sharing some talk-show patter and repartee
Welcome to the show, Scooby
Thank you
Nice to have you here
Great to be here
And thank you for dressing up for us
This is very classy
Tell us
What kind of professional plans do you have
What's in your future
Well,  was thinking
might work for you
Ahh
tell me
What do you want to do for me
What's your idea
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a  talk- show host
talk-show host,
You were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then talk-show host
You'll be a Latin dictator in a bout a minute
Audience laughter
Let's see what they think of the first idea
'm curious what the audience thinks
Folks, what do you think: should Scooby be my new sidekick
Audience cheers
Scooby, new sidekick, everybody
Bigger round of applause
:
' Scooby has spaced out while flossing
There is a knock at the door
Yeah
Brady enters
Hey
Hey
What's up
There's something  need to talk about with you
What
There are some rumors
Like what
You know
Stanley
Oh
And like, don't take this the wrong way
mean, 'm cool
but
you know
've got a good reputation at school and, well
really don't want it ruined
He is visibly upset
Pause
No prob
'm cool
Thanks, Scoob
- football scrimmage is in progress
play ends, and the Coach comes on to the field, barking: Esposito, What the fuck do you think you're doing
You're tackling like a bitch on my football team, son
You gotta bend your ass over and hit somebody
You understand me
Yes, sir
You understand me
Yes, sir
Then do it
Livingston
That's the way to hit that hole, son
Brady waves a Cheryl in the stands
We're gonna become a football team today, guys
Let's move the ball
Move
Move
Move
wanna see you hit those holes
Defense, fill those goddam gaps
Let's go, guys
Let's do it
On the next play Brady runs to catch a pass, but is moved down by Esposito shouting, '
' Cheryl jumps up, alarmed
cheerleaders finish their 'Go Bucks
' cheer, but Brady doesn't rise
Brady lies unconscious in bed, hooked up to machines
Marty, Fern, Scooby, and Cheryl stand around him
Mikey sits at the kitchen table with Consuelo
He is eating ice cream
When 'm in high school 'm not going to play any football
'm just going to concentrate on class rank
(beat) What did you do in high school
did not go to high school
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador
We had to work
My family was poor
Must've been hard being poor
'm still poor
Hmmm
(beat) But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything
No, Mikey
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working
'm always working
But when you're not
Like now
What do you like to do
This is work
But it's not like real work
This is just babysitting
Consuelo stares hard at him in silence
You know, your job's really not so bad, if you think about it
You should smile more often
:   : (1) Driving-along-the-neighborhood shots; a lam post; a sign; a floating straw wrapper
(
) When the sky is clear and the sun is warm, you're reminded of how beautiful things can be: a lamp post, a sign, a straw wrapper blowing in the wind
But when that dark cloud appears, you realize how fragile the balance of life is
(2) The neurologist Dr Barry Jordan discussing Brady's condition: When Brady first arrived at the hospital he was unresponsive to verbal stimuli
Wee performed a scan which demonstrated a large subdural hemotoma with mass effect
Since the removal of the subdural he's been in coma
(3)  psychologist discussing the effect of the Brady crisis on his family: When  first met the Livingstons it was in the first twenty four hours of Brady coming in after his tragic football accident and they were acting in a fairly typical way
(4) The Livingstons consulting with Dr Goodman in a hospital waiting room: We're not the ones who need the help
My son needs help
And you- My son's in there
He can't even feed himself, he can't eat don't even know if he's going to be a vegetable or not, for Chrissake
The picture freezes and then zooms into a close up on Scooby
(
) But what about Scooby
How would this effect him
What meaning is to be found in this
Toby and his editor finish watching this latest footage
This is definitely better
You think so
You don't think that this might not be a little dry
This is entertainment you're making, Toby
This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative
Yes,  know
But still, it should be somewhat entertaining
mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation
No, no, no
No exploitation
This is serious
But don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time
You've got a family tragedy on your hands
Will you tell me what's funny about that
About a kid in a coma
Nothing,  guess
mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity
, you're right, you're right
(beat) You know, we need to screen what we've got
invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types
and see what real people think of this
dunno, Toby
We really have a long way to go
You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening
, then we can invite serious intellectual types
We're not ready
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better
We're not ready
Well,  need to see this with an audience
What's an audience going to tell you
don't know
Maybe they'll like it
Mikey opens the refrigerator, takes out a bottle of grape juice, pours a cup for himself, then accidentally spills it all on the floor
Consuelo
spilled some grape juice on the floor
Consuelo
Mikey goes downstairs, finds her alone in her bedroom
She appears to be upset
Consuelo
No response
Consuelo
Are you crying
No
Yes, you are
can tell
What's the matter
Mi Jesus
mi jesus
Speak English
Mi Jesus esta muerto
Consuelo, 'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English  can't understand you
My Jesus
Who is Jesus
My baby
You have a bay
My grandchild-baby
Gee,  didn't even know you had any children
But why are you so upset about Jesus
He's dead
Oh
How did it happen
He was executed
He was on Death Row and then he was executed
How did they execute him
Poison gas
(beat) Maybe it's for the best
mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrong
People who are bad should be killed
Don't you think so
Jesus was not bad
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it
He wasn't
But still, you can't be sure
am sure
But really, you never know
know
(beat) Why was he on Death Row
For rape and murder
Pause
Consuelo, what is rape exactly
(beat) It is when you love someone, and they don't love you
And then you do something about it
Pause
Sometimes  feel like my parents don't love me
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it
long pause
Consuelo
spilled some grape juice upstairs
Do you think you could clean up the floor now
' Marty and Mikey sit by the comatose Brady, who lies now in his own bed
Dad
Do you think that Brady will ever get better
One in a million recover
Maybe he's that one in a million
Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity
It's a very fine line
Pause
don't think there's any hope, either
was just trying to make you feel better
Thanks
You're welcome
(beat) Dad
Would you let me try hypnotizing you now
Yeah
Sure Go ahead
Hypnotize me
Stay there
'll be right back
Mikey hurries off to fetch his hypnotizing apparatus
Marty sits and waits
Just a sec
Be right there
Mikey returns, sets himself up across from Marty and takes out a shiny object
Dad, can you turn around a bit, please
Marty obliges
Thanks
All right
Now you must look at this shiny object and concentrate
Relax your legs
Relax your arms
Relax your shoulders
Now keep your eyes on the shiny object
Your eyelids are getting heavy
heavier
You're getting sleepy
sleepier
Now let your eyes close shut
and you are asleep
Marty's head drops
Now you are completely under my power
am the only voice you can hear, the only voice you will listen to
Now
When you wake up you will be in a good mood
You won't worry so much about Brady
And  will be your favorite from now on
If Brady dies, you can be sad for a little bit, but  will still be the most important person in your life
You will never be mean to me, and always give me whatever  want
Also, you should fire Consuelo
She's lazy
Now when  snap my fingers, you will remember nothing, but you will do everything  have asked
One
Two
Three
Mikey snaps his fingers and Marty wakes up
Hey, Mikey
You wanna get some ice cream
couple of maids are walking by with white babies in strollers
:
' So like, yeah
caved in
mean, had to
My parents, they're like still really depressed about Brady
So  wrote the bullshit essay
Filled out the applications, did the interviews
'know,  figure  can always drop out
(
) So where'd you get in
Prnceton
(
) (beat) But what did you get on your SATs
200 verbal/710 math
Kinda weird, know
But  think they thought it was, like, good-weird
: Marty and Fern sit on the sofa
We used pull
You know, you have to
Sometimes you just have to, Toby
(
) But what kind of pull did you have
have a cousin
Very big giver to the alumni fund
It's all about who you know
Look, we're not suckers
Everyone else is out there doing the same thing
He's right
Scooby watches Toby and Mike as they try fixing their jammed camera
Damn, Toby
This thing won't open again
Let me try it, let me try it
(takes camera from Mike) It's um
The button is just stuck
Hey, um, Toby
was wondering
Is the documentary almost finished
Uh, yeah, we're getting there
Can  see what you have so far
Sure
um
yeah, as soon as  have a screening 'll let you know
Thanks man
Mikey and Consuelo are playing cards
Gin
win
Let's play again
He starts dealing another round when Marty suddenly appears, back from work
Hey, Mikey
Hi, Dad
Come here, give me a hug
Gee, you're home early
Yeah, uh, listen
Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit
need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment
Sure, Dad
He runs up the stairs, pretends to disappear, but stays to observe
Consuelo
Mrs
Livingston and  have discussed this, and we've come to the conclusion that we are not very happy with your work lately, so we're going to let you go
- don't understand
We've been happy with you in the past, but now we think maybe it's time for a change
uh
know you've had trouble at home and maybe, you know, some of that is reflected your work
But, Mr Livingston,  work very hard for you and your family
understand,  understand that, and 'm sorry it had to end this way
Consuelo exits the house and trudges towards the bus stop, carrying all her belongings
Other cleaning women are waiting for the bus as well
' Scooby is looking at the address on Toby's 'documentarian' calling card
He picks up the phone and dials
Dave, the store manager, leaves a costumer for a moment to pick up the phone
Florsheim
Can  help you
(
) Hi
uh
'm trying to reach Toby Oxman
Sorry, he's off today
on the phone
um
Thanks
Scooby drives his Mom's shiny new  to New York
- Scooby pulls into a spot
' Scooby climbs a stairwell, rings a bell
Mike opens the door
Hey, uh, Mike
Is Toby here
Uh, no, he's not
Oh
Do you have any idea where he might be
think he's at a test screening
' Scooby hurries outside only to find his car stolen
Scooby rides a train
- Scooby sees a sign that reads: 'American Scooby: test screening
' He goes into the screening room
' of the documentary being screened
: Marty talks to Toby poolside as he prepares a barbecue
think Scooby's like a lot of kids
He just hit a
a speed bump
Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and think he's gonna continue his education at a good college
And everybody else is gonna be happy
(
) But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism
Pause
don't know why this is so hard for you to comprehend
had a terrific time in college
've got a terrific job, a comfortable salary, terrific wife, three terrific kids
and every year give to the alumni fund
Now why are you trying to make college out to be a bad thing, a negative experience
You were unhappy
Well, to bad
Get over it
Stop trying to impose your misery on others by going around saying, 'Life is bad, life is horrible
' Life is tough on you
Well, boo hoo
laughing
:
- Scooby talks to Toby in the Backyard, Marty seen in the distant background
Well, yeah, my Dad is kind of a goofball
just have to pretend to go along with his ideas
'Cause he really doesn't get it: like could be the next Oprah, for all he knows, but he's never even seen the show
watching himself on screen : as he continues talking to Toby
(
) What is most important to you
dunno
'd like to be good at something
It doesn't have to be mean, it could be movies
Anything
'd be willing to direct
The audience laughs
But 'd like to be, you know
famous
Not necessarily a superstar, just famous
Be recognized
Get fan Mail
Things
: still talking to Toby
(
) Uh, Scooby, now  understand how you want to be a  talk-show host and all, like Conan 'Brien, but did you know even he went to college
He did
(
) Yeah
He went to Harward
(beat) Oh
watching the film and listening to the audience
The laughter is out of control
He is devastated
- Marty and Fern are in bed watching the news
Mikey appears in the doorway
Mom
Dad
Can  sleep with you
'm scared
They flick off the
Sure
Of course, honey
Come in bed with us
Come on
Mikey gets in bed with them
Snug as a bug in a rug
Yeah, here you go, pal
All righty
You're monster-proofed
- Consuelo approaches the house stealthily
opening the back of the house; stuffing towels under bedroom doors; turning on the kitchen stove's gas; switching on the main gas valve in the boiler room
- Consuelo flees
very long pause
- Scooby gets off the bus with a few cleaning women
He walks homewards
- Scooby sees reporters, policemen, firemen, ambulances, gas company vehicles, and neighbors surrounding his house
Toby and Mike suddenly appear with their camera trained on him
(
) Oh, my God, Scooby
'm so sorry
'm so, so sorry
Don't be
Your movie's a hit
