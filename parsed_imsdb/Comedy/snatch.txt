By Guy Ritchie Draft 4 August/9/1999 1
-- We open on a  sitting in front of a sentry post
He is wearing a heavy fur hat that covers his ears and a military- jacket
Behind him is a list of instructions (in Russian)
He 'sucks in a cigarette as though he's a drowning man lookin for oxygen
comes to a stop by the sentry post, the, guard looks, asks a couple of questions and is given an -envelope which he quickly examines, he then attempts to stick his head in the car
gun barrel is promptly stuck in his face and a couple of angry words emanate from the back, the guard jumps back and quickly raises the barrier
This next section will be intercut with the credit sequence
2
-- On the back seat is   -, (New York street wise Jew) who is clutching a fancy looking briefcase which is handcuffed to his wrist
He is flanked by This next section will be subtitled
How much further do we have to go
Just then the car comes to a standstill
The window is wound down and a gun barrel is stuck through
The looks dramatically calm
Pass him the money
Franky hesitates for a second
(') Franky you know you have no choice
So please can we get on with it
Franky knows discussion is futile
He flips the case open and pulls out a transparent plastic bag full of American dollars
The package is pulled out of the window, the driver doesn't move, we dissolve for a passage of time, the anxiety is more than obvious, but Four Fingers can do nothing
All of a sudden a package comes through the window and the car speeds off without waiting for an inspection of the delivery
() 2   : Franky opens the package and he reveals a stone the size of a fist
He shines a torch onto it and puts a stone inspectin monocle to his eye
He's satisfied
: ,
: : : Franky Four Fingers opens a fancy case, presses a hidden catch, this reveals a second wall within the case, he then carefully places the stone within this secret compartment and firmly closes the case
The Russian next to him is playing with a revolver, he spins the chamber
(') If you need a man in London then call this number
Franky takes the card looks at it and repeats the name
Boris
Boris, Boris can get you anything you need
: 3
-   -- : We are in the back room of an amusement arcade and can hear fruit machines beeping in the distance
Meet and  who is toying with a heavy-looking revolver
It's a bit heavy isn't it Boris
Heavy is good
Heavy is reliable
If it doesn't work you can hit him with it
Tommy practices a couple of gun slinging maneuvers
He's impressed
At that moment the door opens and in walks a carrying two heavy sacks of coins
He's a rough looking bastard, he's massive, and extremely ugly
Meet () 3     : Yes Gorgeous
George looks at the weapon and can see that he's interrupting
Sorry Tommy,  hope that  am not interrupting
Oh of course you're not interrupting Gorgeous,  put the do not disturb sign on the door because  wanted you to join us
George isn't too bright What are you doing Tommy
am baking a cake Gorgeous, not that i t ' s any of your business
Put the takings down, and be a good chap
-
George puts down the coins
Tommy implies he should leave
Gorgeous isn't too bright and continues to stand there looking stupid
Tommy goes to turn around but can see that he hasn't left, so he turns back, (') Is there anything else Gorgeous, a cup of tea perhaps
No
Well in that could you kindly fuck off and shut the door behind you
Tommy turns round to Boris with a slight shake of his head
(') Not too bright but he hits like a train
' l l take it
You're a gambling man Boris, so 'll toss you for it
Heads it's mine, tails 'll give you twice the price
Boris chews this for a second
' l l toss the coin
He tosses the coin : 4
YORK_OFFICE -- : Meet
On the phone
Cool young street wise  diamond dealer
He catches a coin
Twenty carats
5
-- Franky's on the phone
Best stone 've seen in years
Good man Franky, you done a good job
What time you back
gotta move the smaller stones here; it shouldn't take me long
' l l be a couple of days
Speak to my cousin Doug
Doug the Head
Yeah, Doug the Head
But get some security
mean it, get it today, speak to those Russians, they can get you anything
And
Dramatic pause And what
No fuckin around in any casinos, you hear me
You've done a good job Franky, don't go and fuck it up
hear ya Hands
see ya Hands
The phone goes down and Hands looks up at a
He's got it
6
BORIS1 On the phone subtitled Yes he's got it
He might call, he might not, but if he does be ready
' l l see what  can do
He can't know that it's you Boris
We do too much business together
You're gonna have to get someone else to hit him and there is no way it can relate to us
You understand
Yes  understand
One more thing, he loves to gamble
7
-- (aka  ) is a heavy looking fella
He is observing a giant of a man,  , boxing a sparring partner
Two hundred and sixty pounds, that's fucking pedigree pal
He's talking to  and , a couple of employees
(') He doesn't look bad does he
Oh no Mr Mclean, he looks great
Yeah great
He'll kill him, he'll do you proud governor
Do you reckon that's what people should do for me, do you Gary, do me proud
That's what you deserve Mr Mclean
() 7   : Pull your tongue out of my arsehoie Gary
Dogs do that, and you're not a dog, are you Gary
Taken aback by the change in tone
Err no,  am not
However, you do have all of the characteristics of a dog Gary, all except loyalty
There is a definite change in temperature
(') And people like dogs Gary, for the principal reason that they're loyal
So  don't quite know where that leaves you my old son, other than refuckinpugnant
There is a problem (') Which one was it that kept the four grand from the Clapham job
Pause (') Don't let me ask again
would like answers, but  am not in the mood for asking questions, get busy lads, or it's feeding time, oink, oink, know what  mean
Liam takes a step to the side and moves his eyes in a sideways action implying the guilt lies with Gary
Gary catches this and opens his mouth to protest
One of Brick Tops's henchmen, , sticks a belt in there as quick as it opens and smashes a bar across Gary's legs, he buckles
The henchman man pulls out a plastic bag and a roll of tape
('') You know what to do with that don't you Liam
Don't look for your sake
() 7   :   (2) of Smaller Fighter, we witness Liam putting the bag over Gary's head and tying tape round his neck
Gary tries to resist but it's futile and we vaguely witness the demise of poor Gary
You're a ruthless cunt Liam, ' l l give you that
Brick Top turns away at this point to admire his fighter
(') But  got no time for grasses
We cut to see Liam's panic filled eyes
The bar comes down again
Brick Top finds more interest in his fighter
(') Feed em to the pigs Errol
With a short beat
(') He's looking good, Bomber, is he not
How's their man getting on
We whip pan off Brick Top's boxing ring
8
- - And the whip pan shot takes us into this boxing ring
Meet , he is Tommy's partner
Turkish is older and wiser than Tommy, they are both watching Gorgeous go through his paces
Gorgeous George is head butting a heavy punch bag
The sound that emanates is disturbing, and Tommy is distracted
Is he allowed to do that
Turkish is drinking milk from a bottle It's an unlicensed boxing match Tommy, not a tickling competition
These lads are out to hurt each other
Oi Turkish, can  have a drink
Turkish looks over his shoulder and then points to himself () 8   : What do  look like to you George, a fuckin water boy
Turkish looks at the
(') Oi son, look lively
He turns
back to Tommy
(') Look at it
He turns to see the remnants of a caravan where they keep the training gear and administration for the fights (') How am  supposed to run this thing from that
We gonna need a proper office
He looks at the caravan again and sighs, it is quite pitiful (') want a new one Tommy and you 're going to buy it for me
What's wrong with this one
Turning back to Tommy and ascending the steps in to his " have seen better days" caravan, ' foot goes through one of the stairs and the
door comes off at the hinges as he tries to open it
Oh nothing Tommy, it's tip top, it's just  am not sure about the colour
He passes him a piece of paper (') Here it's all arranged
You just gotta pick it up
Here's an address
Tommy looks at the address and frowns
t ' s that campsite
That's right, you're buying a caravan, caravans live in campsites
() :   (2)
They aren't pikey are they
don't know what they are, all know is they have a caravan, and we want a Caravan
hope they're not pikies
hate fucking pikies
You're a sensitive boy, ain't you Tommy
You got ten grand and  want to see change
He is distracted by the bulge in Tommy's trouser front
(') Fuck me, hold tight, what's that
It's my Gucci belt, Turkish
Pointing quite clearly at the gun
No Tommy, there's a gun in your trousers
What is a gun doing in your trousers
It's for protection
Protection from what, the Germans
The war ended fifty years ago
Err what's to stop it blowing your balls off every time you sit down
Where did you get it
Looking down onto his gun
Boris the Blade
You mean Boris the sneaky fucking Russian
Turkish pulls the gun out of Tommy's front
() 8   :   (3) (') t ' s a bit heavy isn't it
e spins the chamber : BORIS1  -- : The weight is a sign of reliability
always go for reliability
Boris is showing Franky a large pistol
' l l take it
How much do you want for -it
Nothing
Pause Ok, so what do you want for it
want you to do something for me
Franky nods for him to go on
(') There is a fight in a couple of days: What kind of a fight
Unlicensed boxing
The camera tracks into Franky: he has a problem and it's been exposed
(') There is a bookies  know that will take bets
If you place one down for me we will call it quits
Why don't you put it down yourself
() 9    : Well there isn't too many bookies that take those kind of bets, and already have an outstanding debt with the house
know something most don't
Why don't you put a few pounds down yourself
Frankie shrugs and implies he wants to hear more
What do you mean
10
-- On the phone
Play the game Doug
11
' is an east London Jew, about forty five, almost completely bald and proud of it, he sits with his two twin daughters  and  - they look like Prada models but as soon as they open their mouths, it's clear that they aren't, they have extremely rough London accents
Doug is on the phone to Hands
am playing the game Hands
That's what  ' l l give ya
Hands shakes his head in disbelief
You gotta haggle fairly Doug, otherwise it'll make your hair fall out you'll see
You know  won't buy poop
He isn't selling poop
Listen if the stones are kosher then 'll by em
Now  gotta business, to run
He puts the phone down
() 11   : (') That was my cousin Hands, Have told you about my cousin Hands
Yes Dad, you have
He's an important fella
,
Yes Dad, you told us
Is that a prawn sandwich you're eating
Doug looks mildly embarrassed Is it
You're Jewish Dad
Yes
was last timeI looked
Well you can't eat shell fish, Dad, i t ' s against your persuasion
What persuasion myself or the prawns belongs to is not the issue, the issue is how a fuckin shrimp managed to sneak in to' my sandwich
Pause
(') Sneaky bastards
He throws the half eaten sandwich out the window
12
-- We cut to an enormous and frightening looking dog sniffing the half eaten prawn sandwich, before he is yanked away by his master
The dog is a lively young thing
We raise the camera to see the man that is walking it
Meet
Vinny is a very large black man - the size is due to dumplings not dumbbells
He
stops outside a shop
We see it clearly
t ' s a pawnbrokers
() 12   : Move it, come on move" i t
Vinny enters the pawn shop
13
-- Meet , who's behind the counter, Vinny's partner in the pawn shop
He's concentrating on the deal at hand with and has a stone-inspecting monocle to his eye
Alright Sol, Lincoln
They are in deep discussion and only Lincoln responds
Vin
It's a mosinite
whatinnite
No, a mosinite
How much a night
No, a fuckin mosinite
It's the updated zirconia
Enough of bosinites and mosonias, talk English to me Sol
Zirconias are artificial diamonds, they look pretty good to the novice like you Lincoln
But you could break them with a hammer, so they came up with mosinites
What are you saying
am saying it's worth fuck all
Lincoln's face drops () 13   : Fuck what
t ' s worth more than fuck what, but not a lot more
We have told you before Lincoln, you stick to being a gangster and leave this game to me and Sol
Sol looks round properly at Vin and can see that he's accompanied by a dog
' What's that Vince
Err, it's a dog Sol
' Where do you think you're going with that Vince
You can't bring that thing in here
It's in here, what's the problem, it's only a dog
know full fucking well what it is Vin
Where did you get it
Those gypsies, they threw it in with a load of moody gold
Sol considers this and decides it can't be all bad
It better not be dangerous
Does it look dangerous
Yes, it fucking does Vin
If it so much as farts it's out
If it farts we'll all be out
() 13   :   (2) Vin turns around and runs into Boris, who's entered the shop without making a noise
(') Jesus, where did you come from
Uzbekistan
Oi Sol, Boris is here
Boris, what's up
have a job for you
Go on
want you to hold up a bookies
How high do you want us to hold it
Steady on George
We deal in jewellery Boris, we don't hold up bookies
We can hear Vinny in the background Hear me out
This one is different
14
'  -- Tommy is driving down a country lane with Gorgeous George in the passenger seat
Don't you worry Gorgeous, he's a big man granted but you gotta bigger punch than Judy
Cut to a caravan camp site comes into view
It's the Jesus what's that
That's what we are looking for
() 14   : t ' s a camp site
It's a pikey campsite
Ten points
What are we doing here
We are buying a caravan
Off a pack of fucking pikies
What's wrong with you
This'll get messy
Not if you're here
Oh fuck off Tommy you never said anything about pikies
Calm down, we are buying and then we are off
Oh you bastard,  hate fuckin pikies
They arrive in the camp site and the car is immediately surrounded by
The kids (most of whom are on bikes) speak with a sort of Anglo-Irish mix that sounds as rough as the kids look
, 1 That's a flash car Mister
Not as flash as your bike though is it
1 Who you looking for
Mr 'Neill
1 Do you want me to go and get him
Good lad
() 14   : (2_)
There is a pause, the boy doesn't move
(') Well are you going to go and get him
1 Yeah
There is another pause
Well what are you waiting for
1 The five quid you are going to pay me
Chuckling
Oh fuck off, 'll find him myself
1 Two fifty
You can have a quid
1 Oh you're a tight fucker aren't ya
man shouts from the background
He's a young fella with a hard but friendly face (when he smiles)
He's covered in grease and facial hair, and his trousers are done up with string
But he's wearing a Cartier watch and Gucci shoes, and a large gold identity bracelet
This is  '
What are you doing Paul
Get out of the way boy
Are you Tommy, have you come about the caravan
Mr 'Neill
Fuck man, call me Micky
Micky comes up to the car, cleaning his grease covered hands with a hand towel
How are ya
() 14   : ( 3 ) am well sir, well, quite well, the weather is being kind to us but the engines aren't
Gorgeous George steps out of the car
Micky takes a step back
(') Fuck me, would you look at the size of him, Jesus man how big are you
Hey kids how fucking big is he
2 He's a big man that's for sure
Would you look at the size of his muscles
And then look at the size of his fists
Hey Mum, come and look at the size of this fella
The kids start to feel his arms
Gorgeous George plays the game and raises the kids on his biceps
Micky's  comes out to see
(') Would you look at the strength of the man
bet you can box a little can't you sir
You look like a boxer
Get out of the way Micky and see if the fellas would like a drink
could murder one
There won't be any murdering done around here,  don't mind telling ya
Would the big fella like a cup of tea
Don't be silly Micky, a man didn't get that size from drinking cups of tea
Offer the man a Guiness boy
2 Lift me up would you Mister
() 14   : ( 4 ) 3 bet you can't lift us both at the same time
Tommy and Gorgeous follow Micky who's walking past a kennel
The dogs are in good condition, and are happy as you like to see
Micky stops and gives one of them a stroke
Good dogs, do you like dogs
Sure, yeah,  like dogs
like caravans more
15
' We open on Vinny's dog, now sitting in a car, it's breathing heavily and doesn't look well, and Sol doesn't see the funny side of the dog sitting next to him
The man driving is called : he's a white guy who thinks he's black
Vin is also in the car
don't want him dribbling on my             , seats man
Give him another of those biscuits
They shut him up
They give him wind
Tyrone turns round to complain, and narrowly misses a car
(') Hey watch the road
Fuck me, you want this man to drive us Sol
Can you drive mate
No Vin, he can't tell the difference between a steering wheel and a man on the moon
That' s why  got him
Sol gives the dog another biscuit
Don't you worry about me, jus worry about the dog on my seats man
Tyrone gets out of the car to put some petrol in
() 15   : Sol why's he talking like a black man
don't know Vin
Oi Tyrone, Vin wants to know why you talk like a black man
Roots and ting, seen
Sol and Vin raise their eyebrows
Roots and what
don't know
You get that gun from Boris
Got it
It wasn't exactly what was expecting, mind
Mean looking bastard though, that's for sure
Sol unzips a bag
Inside is a ridiculously powerful shotgun
What's that
It's a shotgun Sol
t ' s a fuckin anti-aircraft gun Vin
What are you planning on shooting, the angels out of the clouds
That's gonna raise more than pulses
It will raise hell my old son
don't think  really want to see hell Vin
What's wrong with a normal gun
The are psychological advantages to a gun that looks like it can perforate the moon
() 15   : (
) Tyrone gets into the car, starts it up again and puts some money in the car wash machine
Can you get this fuckin dog to stop dribbling on me
Vin pulls the dog back
(') worry about you Vin, Jesus, talk about overkill
One look at a crack desperate brother and you could wave a knife and fork around, and  am sure they would lick the salt of your scrotum
The car wash starts
What the fuck are you doing
never do a job unless  have a clean car,  like to make my wheels look crisp
Are you serious,
You' re a getaway driver, you're not here to show your fuckin car off
The machine starts
They do the windows up and that point the dog lets out a fart
The water starts to hit the windshield so they can't undo the windows
There is more an atmosphere of disbelief than of concrete anger
16 Gorgeous George fastens the caravan to the back of their Land Rover and pulls away
They wave at Micky and he reciprocates
He's a good dog
He'll get a little homesick for a while but he'11 get over it
Tommy has a dog that looks distressed about leaving Micky sitting next to him
17
-- don't know what all your fuss was about
They aren't bad fellas
Just then the wheels of the caravan come straight off and the caravan is dragged until the car comes to a sudden stop
The dog jumps out the window and goes bounding back to the campsite
18
-- They are looking at the damage
Of course i t ' s completely useless now
don't think it's supposed to have done that
19
-- The dog is behind Micky's legs happy to be back
The deal was you bought it how you saw it
Tommy goes to interrupt but he doesn't get a chance (') Look,  have helped ya as much as am gonna help ya
You still got a car and  suggest you use it before you're not welcome anymore
There is a silence for a while
The atmosphere has gone more than frosty and a few more gypsies are hanging around
Hey
Interrupted It was only a question of time before you got some attention
Nobody brings a fella the size of you unless they are trying to say something without talking
Just give us my money and you can keep your caravan
() 19   : Why the fuck do  want a caravan that's got no fuckin wheels
am not going to do that
Gorgeous George steps forward
(') Where the fuck do you think you're going
You want to settle this with a fight
You'll do no such thing Michael
You'll
Alright Mum, we shan't, we'll settle it some other way, now don't get upset
won't have you fighting, Micky
Micky's Mum is getting upset and it's consequently upsetting Micky
Okay mum okay
You need to sit down
Micky calls to one of the lads standing by
(') Darren look after Mum
Get her sitting down
We see Mum being led out by Darren; Micky looks genuinely concerned for his mum
Pause as Micky waits for her to be well gone
(') ' l l fight you for it
Tommy looks at Gorgeous George
Gorgeous George raises his eyebrows
20
,   -- The two fighters start pacing
It looks a bit ridiculous, Micky is dwarfed by comparison
Gorgeous George takes a swipe: it was an
impressive punch, but Micky is a quick littl bastard and sidesteps
Micky does nothing to retaliate; his hands are still by his,side
() 20   : Gorgeous George lunges out and grabs Micky by the throat and groin, picks him up like a sack of spuds and throws him against the car door
All eyes are on Micky for a second or two, then he rises and appears little bothered by this, he gets up brushes himself off and starts to pace again, hardly even looking at the big man
You want to stay down my friend, promise you, you want to stay down
Micky ignores this and continues to pace, the big fella grabs him and puts him in a headlock and charges him into the stable door
There is a terrible noise
(') Now you fucking stay down boy or you won't be coming up next time
It appears as though this is going to get messy and any humour that might have been around has now evaporated
Micky raises his head there is still no damage to speak of
All of a sudden he starts jumping up and down like he's warming up, throwing a few shadow punches, taking off his shirt
This reveals a heavily tattooed and scarred torso, and underneath these embellishments is a physique that warrants some respect
(') This is sick
am outta here
- You're not going anywhere my friend
You stay until the job is done
Micky starts pacing, and throwing out a couple of shadow punches with his back to Gorgeous George, he still hasn't really acknowledged his opponent
Gorgeous George moves in for the coup de grace, Micky spins on his feet and catches the big man under the jaw
: We see Gorgeous George lying on the floor with a head the size of a water melon
There is blood streaming out of every orifice in his head - he's in
big trouble
We are in slow motion;- there's a lot of activity going on around the body on the floor, their mouths are open but we can't hear what they are saying, all we can hear is the voice over given by Tommy
(
) This isn't good, if George doesn't wake up in the next few minutes () () 20   : (2) (
) (') have a problem
am scared, really fuckin scared
There is something coldblooded and practical about what these people are thinking
They will pop me like a hot sausage if George doesn't wake up
Why do they want to go to the trouble of explaining why a man died in a campsite
These people don't exist in society, you can't find them, they live under their own laws and ignore everybody else's
am scared, am really fuckin scared
21
1 -- We see Turkish with a somewhat serious expression on his face he has his customary pint of milk on one side, he takes a sip and "ohhhs" and "arrrs" for a while
So you're telling me he would have run you through if Gorgeous hadn't woken up
No, his Mum stopped it
If his Mum hadn't turned up, well,  ' d be pikey fuckin sausages
What were you thinking of
Why the fuck did you put Gorgeous George into a bare knuckle boxing match two days before he had to fight the Bomber
He was half his size
He pantomimes a man that would reach his navel (') didn't expect him to get hurt
You put the man into a bare knuckle boxing match
He raises his voice () 21   : (') What the fuck did you expect grease down and a shiatsu
Who took the jam out of your donut
You took the fuckin jam out of my donut Tommy, you did
You said get a good deal so
Tell me the correlation between a hospitalized boxer and a good deal
Pause there is no correlation as Tommy knows
(') How are we going to explain to Brick Top that his fight isn't going to
happen
We replace the fighter
Oh what, and hope he doesn't notice
And who the fuck are we going to replace him with
John "The Gun
" Or "Mad Fist" Willy
You're not exactly Mr Current Affairs, are you Tommy
Mad Fist went mad, and the "Gun" shot himself
What about Clam Hand Tony
Got his fingers caught in the till
He's no good to anyone
Why not
() 21   : (2) bare
knuckle boxer isn't a lot of good without any fuckin knuckles, Tommy
Pause for thought, then Turkish has the look of a man that has come across a really bright idea
(') Jesus
What
Let's use the fuckin pikey
22
'  -- Doug the Head and Franky Four Fingers are doing a deal
Doug has a case open and is admiring a couple of stones
From Russia with love
You interested
told you  was interested
Pause
Franky's in a rush
got stones to sell, fat to chew and many different men to see about many different dogs, so if  am not rushing you, could you spit shine the top of your smoothie and move a little faster
Hold tight Franky, when in Rome
am not in Rome Doug,  am in a rush
He looks at his watch (') gotta make the bookies
Bookies
What you betting on
() 22   : Some guy called Bomber Harris
The unlicensed boxer
You know something  don't
Maybe
Doug raises his eyebrows You get busy Franky
Put a couple of hundred down for me
23
-- What do you say
How much you going to pay us
Ten k

' l l do it for a caravan
what
No a caravan
what
You are sitting in one if that makes things easier
want a top caravan
It was us that wanted a caravan
- Anyway what's wrong with this one
It's not for me, it ' s for me Mum
24
'  -- Doug is on the phone to Hands
() 24   : overpaid Hands,  want you to recognize charity when i t ' s offered
Do shut up, where is he now
don't know Hands,  ' m not his mother
But  am seeing him later
When
He wants cash so he's coming back after he has been to a fight
There is a serious expression of alarm on Hands's face - the camera crashes in
What do you mean a fight, you mean a boxing match
Is there gambling involved
t ' s a boxing match Hands
Hands isn't happy
Did he have a case with him
Yes
And he's gone gambling
That's Franky " have a problem with gambling" fuckin Four Fingers, you are talking about Doug
What am , telepathic
Franky is good at buying stones Doug but he's a fuckin liability when it comes to gambling
That has cost me
So in turn rit' s cost him
He gets distracted and chopping off a digit seems to focus his attention
() 24   : ( 2 ) How much can he lose
Hands pulls a face like "what kind of a stupid question is that
" He them starts to shout ' l l not forgive you Doug,  am coming over, get me that car
The phone is slammed down
: 25
-- We see the undercarriage of Concorde taking off
26
'  -- Tommy and Turkish walk into a pub and approach the
They reach the bar
We are here to see Brick Top
The barman looks them up and down a bit
He's not doing anything
am very busy at the moment
am not asking you to break sweat, am asking you to call Brick Top
Who
Brick Top
Never heard of him
:                : Well make a call and see if someone else has
Say it's Turkish
The barman looks bothered by the fact he has to move but wanders off
Turkish looks at the pool table
() 26   : (') You know what he's done to people on that pool table
They both give the table an eyeball
What, potted more balls than any other player
What else can you do to people on a pool table
Quite a fuckin lot if you nail 'em to it
appear out of the woodwork
You Turkish
Yup
- Follow me
The heavy fella opens up the bar and beckons Turkish and Tommy through
They go through another door and the corridor turns into a mass of dogs barking, snarling 'and whining in cages
The mood is sinister
they reach another door, they open up and we are introduced to a dog fight
load of are commenting on the performance of the dogs, one dog is being carried out by a single leg, it's covered in blood
Another dog is left in the ring, it too is covered in blood but it's survived
They can charm the paint off walls these fellas
27
-   -- circle of blunt faces are exchanging money with one another few faces turn round to examine Tommy and Turkish, they frown slightly but carry on about their business once they see they are accompanied by the muscle
The heavy walks over to Brick Top
The heavy taps him on the shoulder and whispers
He acknowledges, and gives his drink to the heavy
He walks over
There is a cage next to Brick Top which has a pit bull in, and Brick Top who is carrying a cane pokes it through the cage doors
The dog snarls back
() 27   : Look mean now you hairy fucker won't ya
He looks at the appalled faces of Turkish and Tommy
(') Shits itself when you put it in the ring, but poke
it with a stick and watch his bollocks grow
You like a dog fight, Turkish
like my dog to growl at the post man
Gorgeous ready for tonight
We don'c have a Gorgeous anymore
Brick Top turns round and indicates that he would like the noise around him to drop
It does marginally
You're going to have to repeat that
We have lost Gorgeous George
Brick Top turns round again at the already subdued crowd, he doesn't raise his voice but the crowd reacts
said keep the noise down
tangible silence between the men reflects Brick Top's authority
(') Well, where did you lose him
He isn't a set of fuckin car keys is he
And it's not as though he is inconfuckinspicuous is it
am not backing out
You can bet your bollocks to a barn dance you're not backing out
() 27   :
(2) We are changing the fighter
Brick Top wasn't expecting anything out of Tommy
Oh fuck me your lady friend has got a voice
And who might you be changing him to, sweetheart
You won't know him
Pause: a look of you're kidding comes over his face
Are you taking the piss
No, there was an accident
'll show you a fuckin accident
You've still got your fight
No,  lose all bets at the bookies
You can't change fighters at the last minute, so no,  don't have my fight do , you fuckin prat
You could take bets at the fight
Put a lead on her Turkish,     Before she gets bitten
Pause (') Make sure your man goes down in the fourth
You're on thin fuckin ice my pedigree chums and 'll be there if it breaks
28 The black guys pull up in'Tyrone's car outside the bookies Vin is playing with the dog in the back
() 28   : am not happy about that dog Vin, you can't bring a dog on a job
You can't leave him on his own, not to begin with, he gets homesick
Homesick, for fucks sake
He does
If he gets the chance he runs back to the gypsies' campsite
Ohh shut up, how can he find it
don't know Sol,  am not a dog
Ask him
It' s like he's got a fuckin homing beacon
Give him the chance and he's off
You're going soft Vin
Here pass me a sandwich
Vin throws a sandwich to Sol but the dog catches it whilst i t ' s in flight and swallows it in one gulp
(') Jessssus, he didn't even chew it
The car has stopped
What have you stopped here for
What's wrong with that space
It's too tight
What are you talking about, tight
You could land a jumbo fuckin jet in there
Leave him alone, he's a natural
Tyrone gets a little over-excited with the accelerator and reverses with a crashing sound into the rear of the van behin them (ie it:s parked back to back with them)
() 28    : ( 2 ) natural fuckin idiot
Tyrone, what have you done
Look, you hassle me, see what happens
Tyrone makes to move the van forward again
Well don't move it now, otherwise people will see the damage
What did you do that for
^ didn't see it there
Eh
It's a four ton truck
It' s not as though i t ' s a ferret fuckin a flea is it
It was at a funny angle
Vin is confused as to this last statement
Funny angle
It was behind you Tyrone, whenever you reverse things come from behind you
am not happy Sol
- The dog starts whining
(') Give him something to shut him up
Sol throws a plastic squeaky dog ball that was in the front
The dog grabs in and swallows it in one gulp
The brothers look on in shock
He can't swallow a whole ball
He swallowed it
The dog looks up having completed the task
Vin who looks quite alarmed holds the dog by the ribs and squeezes, there is a squeak
29
-- Doug and Alex are waiting to pick- up Hands
Did you get Hands that car
got him one like it
Doug is in shock
What do you mean one like it
got him the Volante
What did  say
What exactly did say
You said get him the Vantage
That's right,  clearly said get him the Vantage
So why did you get the Volante
; Because they look the same
The Septuagint scholars mistranslated the Hebrew word for "young woman" in to the Greek word for "virgin", because they thought they looked the same, coming up with the prophecy "behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son"
But there is a world of difference between a virgin and a young woman like there is between a Volante and a fuckin Vantage
'
Pause: she thinks about this
Are you saying that the fact that your cousin Hands is driving a Valiant instead of a Vantage is a profound a mistake as a whole religion
Yes  fuckin am
() () 29 (') Cars are his religion
He can drive a Valiant in the States but  can't drive a Vantage because they won't tolerate the emissions
Well, it's too late now, that's Concorde
' 30
-- Hands and his sidekick Rosebud are coming out of the sliding glass doors towards Doug who's now standing by the car with his arms crossed
Hands is quite clearly looking for a car
How about a hug for your old cousin Doug
He stops looking for his car and focuses on Doug
Fuck off you fat bald bastard - and where's my car
31 The black guys are sitting in the car still
The occasional squeak comes from the dog
How am  going to get it out
He'll probably cough it up
Do you think he'll be alright
Sol shrugs
Hope not
What are we waiting for
We are waiting for a man carrying a case
Why
() 31   : Because the deal is that we give the Russian the case and we keep the money
He rubs his fingers symbolically together What's in the case
Sol turns round to talk to Tyrone
Fuckin 'ell Tyrone you ask a lot of questions
You concentrate on the driving okay
He turns back just as a  is stepping into the bookies: he is carrying a case
(') Shit, was that him
' Don't ask me, you're the one supposed to keep an eye on it
How many fingers did he have
Are you serious
am sorry but couldn't get the binoculars out in time
Well let's not stand on ceremony, let's start the show
They get out of the van and go up to the bookies, leaving Tyrone in the van
There's a double set of glass doors
Sol pushes them open, and Vinny walks in first, while Sol hangs back with the shotgun
32
-- Inside is the  with the case, busy filling in a slip, and behind the betting counter
Vinny doesn't mince around and goes straight to the counter, where the , comes up to help
Yes sir, how can  help
() 32   : You can start by giving me all your money
Does Sir know who this bookies belongs to
It
belongs to me now
Vinny then leans over the counter to get menacing
Pauline looks more than a little concerned (') If you know what's good for
He is cut short, as Pauline triggers a button under the counter and a security screen comes flying up at a very rapid rate of knots protecting all the counters
This has the unfortunate consequence of taking Vinny with it
Poor Vin is shot straight to the ceiling, all we can see is half a body and his desperately searching for ground legs
Needless to say this leaves Sol in a bit of a bewildered state
He's looking the wrong way at the critical moment and is left wondering what happened, not having seen Vince impaled on the ceiling
Sol extracts the enormous shotgun
Vi nce
Vince
He spins round looking for his colleague
muffled noise tells him to look up
, (')
What are you doing Vince
And what the fuck are you doing up there
few groans emanate from the other side of the counter
Sol panics some more, and decides that emergency action is called for
(') have got your man out here
If you don't put down the screen 'll blow his fucking head off
You hear me
(
) don't care, you can do what you like he's not related to me
You think you can try me
() 32   : (2
) Sol raises the gun and fires into the side
of- the wall
There's an enormous explosion and a clear hole is made in the side of the wall
The powerful kick from the gun also makes Sol momentarily airborne
33
'  -- We see Tyrone grimace at the sound of the shotgun
34
-- Sol pulls himself together and marches up to the hole in the wall that the shot created and pokes the gun through
Drop the screen now
You just seen what it did to this wall so think what it could do to you
Pauline knows she has lost this one and looks genuinely scared
(to the other clerk) Do it
said do it
The screen comes down with a thud
This means that Vince comes down with just as serious a thud
He lets out another groan
How you doing Vince
weakened voice retorts
How do  look like  am doing you fucking idiot
would be doing a lot better if you would stop using my name
Consoled that his colleague is not dead it's back to business for Sol
He raises the gun and pulls his fiercest face
Now fill this bag
'
-
- All bets are off
am not here to make a fuckin bet
() 34   : All bets are off
Are you fuckin stupid
don't care if the fuckin bets are off
want
If all bets are off then there can't be any money, can there
There is a pause
Sol knows he's fucked
She points to a black board that clearly states "   " ain't buying that
ain't fuckin selling it, it's a fact
''
Pause Well, what have you got
Nothing,  mean we got a few coins but no notes
Can we just get out of here please
am not feeling too funny
Sol's temper does have a limit
Well  am not feeling too fucking funny myself, let me tell you
Sol points at the man on the floor who is carrying the case
(') Let me see your hands
The man holds his hands up
He has got a perfect set of five fingers on both hands
Sol puts his head in his hands
Pauline and the other clerk put two bags full of coins on the counter
Sol picks them up and frowns, he's not happy with a bag full of change
He puts his gun down and starts to rifle through the bag
Pauline can see Vinny's pistol on the counter, dropped after his encounter with the screen
() 34   : (2
) (
') Copper coins
What do you mean copper fuckin coins
Pauline sees her opportunity and grabs the pistol
Sol
goes for it too, but he's beaten to it
Sol ducks, pulling Vince with him, Pauline lets out a series of shots in their direction, Sol counter blasts over the top of the counter
The security screen comes flying back up
Get me out of here now Sol
Vinny does sound convincingly desperate
We're going Vin
He grabs the bag of copper coins, grabs Vince and marches towards the double'doors
They open the first set and then they try to open the second
They push the door nothing happens
There is no going back
Sol starts to kick the glass door, but it doesn't budge
With panic rising swiftly, Sol doesn't fuck around he takes aim with the handgun and fires, the bullet shatters the glass but it doesn't break through, and the bullet now ricochets off both glass doors shattering bullet-proof glass all around them
Vinny's panic filled eyes attempt to follow its trajectory
Sol is unaware of the ricochet and before Vin has time to warn him, Sol fires another bullet
Now he observes the problem and waits for the inevitable
The bullet tears through the bag of coins, which then empties its contents at Vin's and Sol's feet
Eventually the bullet hits poor Vince in the thigh
Sol sinks to the floor, he has given up
Amongst the yells emanating from Vince we can hear Sol's pathetic and desperate whimpering
(') No security, eh
At that point Tyrone appears and pushes the door open
The door was open the whole time - only Sol was pushing it the ,,       ' wrong way
What the fuck are you two doing
They stumble out into the street
Vinny is in big trouble
They throw him into the van
Just as Sol gets into the back, we hear kicking noises on metal from the van behind
Tyrone pulls out
And the rear doors of the van behind them fly open
Franky Four Fingers appears from the back of this van
He was locked in due to the fact that the black guys' van was blocking his exit
() 34   :   (3
) Tyrone get us outta here
Tyrone takes an interest in the man from the van (ie Franky) seeing that he's carrying a case and the case is connected to his wrist
(') said, get us outta here Tyrone
35 The Aston Martin comes to a screeching halt outside
Doug is quite pale from the ride
Hands looks almost satisfied with the car
-
gotta say it's not bad
He then looks at the sign of the rundown venue, his eyes squint incredulously
(') Caesar's Palace
36 Doug approaches the entrance
Private night tonight chaps
Doug passes him a ticket
The doorman steps to the side
They continue to walk past several other doorman who all inspect the ticket
Jesus are we ever going to get in there
You gotta understand that this isn't exactly Vegas and it's not exactly legal
am not looking for Vegas, Doug, am looking for Franky Four Fingers
Well he said he was going to be here
() 36   :
If there's gambling involved, he'll be here
They get nudged aside by an entourage of men coming through
(') Hello, who's your man
Hands points out Brick Top who is being crowded by minders
Horrible bastard, it's his fight, made all his money in
He touches the side of his nose and inhales
Original
So he doesn't need to do this, but he's got dark taste for fights and blood, he wants to impress London's criminal royalty
He points out  "   " and  : they are surrounded by heavies
(') with a tip on when who hits the floor
Any man with veins in his brains knows Brick Top knows the answer
Cut back to Jack and Salt Pete
(') Those boys make Brick top look like a skirt clinging thumb sucker
And i f y o u p l a y wi t h f i r e
Cut to a few still shots of atrocities committed by the men in question
, :    :  & So Michael, you got it clear
It's the fourth round
'll tap you anyway to let you know when to go down
() 36   : ( 2 ) Just make sure the man doesn't kill me before the fuckin fourth
:  & As long as we keep them happy
Brick Top nods at Jack and Salt Peter, they nod back
(') Make sure they are kept sweet
The last thing  want is them fuckin moaning
37
-- ' In the blue corner  have the young and only unchallenged cutthroat of calamity, meaner than Beelzebub's conscience cleaner
Give it up for the bone crunching one punch machine gun -- Micky
murky sound of displeasure emanates round the arena
The audience don't know who he is and don't care either
(') And in the other corner a man that needs no introduction to destruction, the solo warrior of Walthamstow, sometimes known as Buckshot Peter, or sometimes known as the dictator
to the devastator, he put the ' e ' in eradicate, the ' o ' in obliterate and the ' a 1 in annihilate, you know this monster of a monster, the sinister prime minister
"Bomber the "mad man" Harris"
The audience goes mad
It's hard to tell whether it's out of affectionate enthusiasm or just enthusiasm
(') Now  want a good dirty fight lads, So now it's that time again
Let's
Get ready to rrrrrrummmmmble
The two come out to fight
Bomber Harris lifts his monster hands to do damage
They pace each other for a second
Then Micky lets one go
(  ) 37   : It hits Bomber Harris square on the jaw this has the effect of forcing blood out of his ears the man is positively out cold
We crashtrack into various characters' reactions: Brick Top, Turkish and Tommy etc
All are in shock
The ref (who is obviously paid off as well) tries to resuscitate Harris/ but it's not happening, he catches a look of desperation from one of the villains and is eventually left with little choice but to hold Micky's hand up
We cut to the nasty looking characters that we saw before they have approached with their heavies, and they are obviously not satisfied
Tha-nks for the tip, Brick top
have just said goodbye to forty large because of you, what's the crack
38
-- (: the first half of this scene happens about midway scene 28 - as Tyrone parks the van ) We cut back to Frankie Four Fingers getting out of his van
He takes a quick look around and enters the back of his van
There he raises the spare tire and picks up his gun, he examines it and places it in his trouser front
He then turns to exit
At which point there is a loud smash and Franky is knocked backwards (as Tyrone hits his van)
' (Time-wise, we're now at the end of scene 34) Frankie wakes up
He has a trickle of blood dripping down the back of his neck, he looks at his watch and panics
He kicks the doors a couple of times - nothing happens, but on the third kick the doors spring open
Franky brushes himself off and makes his way to the bookies
39
-- We cut to Tyrone
Tyrone clocks the case attached to Franky' wrist
Gets out and slams the end of the gun across Franky Four Fingers' head
He falls to the ground
Tyrone tries to take the case off him but i t ' s handcuffed to his wrist
So he has little choice but to pick him up and throw him in to the back of the car with the other two
40
-- We cut to the   black guys trying to open the case
They have Franky's hand   up on a desk and are fiddling with the handcuff, whatever they   are trying to break in with snaps off
Vinny is frustrated   and illustrates his dissatisfaction
Where ' s the Russian
He should be here in a minute
Well get him to open it
Vinny turns to Franky who has tape over his eyes
(') Oi, you, Four Fingers, how are we going to get into your case
If you take the tape off my eyes Ml tell you
What do you need the tape off your eyes for
You talk out of them
Just tell us the combination
can't remember the combination can only do it if  see it
Pause You look at us and it's good night
Vinny takes it off
Franky blinks at the revelation of light
And gets busy opening the case
Come on
He opens it - and it's got about a grand inside
And
And here's the money
() 40   :
don't believe this
Why are you carrying round a case with this little in it
Vin turns to Sol and Tyrone who is leaning on the big shotgun At which point Franky pulls out the gun from the secret compartment in the case
Now be a bunch of good fellas and lie down on the floor
Tyrone goes for the big gun and Franky pulls the trigger
Nothing happens other than a big click, there is silence for a long second and the black guys open their tightly shut eyes
: Whoops
Tyrone also looks into the case and sees the
open secret compartment: this also reveals the stone
(') Hello what have we got here
41 Boris is admiring the outside of the shop
He walks in
42 Franky is tied up on a stool, in front of him is the case and it's open
Boris waves the black guys to come into the corridor so they can talk without being heard
What are you doing with him
The case was attached to his body
So why didn't you chop it off
Sol looks horrified by the thought
Err, because we didn't
Now Boris we have or rather you have a problem
What
() 42   : There wasn't any money there
v Boris pulls out a wad of notes There's ten grand
Keep it
We want this, or at least half of this
Vin holds up the stone: the atmosphere changes
What was in the case was mine, what was in the bookies was yours, ok there wasn't much but, here's ten large to help the situation
am afraid it's too late for that Boris
- He holds up the diamond
Boris1 eyes follow him as he walks back into the room where Franky is and puts the diamond back into the case while he's talking and changes the combination
(') We want half and that's because we are being generous
We could by rights keep the whole fuckin stone
Boris grimaces and pulls out a gun from god knows where, and within a second shoots poor Franky in the face
Franky's body disappears off the stool that he was sitting on
The black guys are stunned into silence
You fuckin idiots
He couldn't know who  am
Now open the case and give me
the stone
The black guys are left with their mouths open, everything just changed gear and they weren't expecting that
(') Who's next
You have the ten grand now give me the stone
The pause continues
Boris lets a shot off that tears worryingly close to Sol's head
() 42   :   (2
) The only man that knows the combination you just shot
Boris appears little bothered by this and whips out a four foot machete that he was concealing about his person
He pulls the case towards him and brings the machete down with full force
We can tell by the expression on Tyrone's face that it must have been some part of Franky's anatomy
Pointing to the ground: He's your problem now
You can keep the" ten grand along with the body, but if  see you again
well look at him
He points to Franky
While he is saying this he bends down and picks up the case from the floor and wraps the severed arm in newspaper
He then walks out of the shop casual as you like
43
-- Turkish pulls up outside his arcade and has a look around: all seems to be clear
ain't going in the front
don't think it's a good idea you going in at all
The car surges off round the back
Unless you are going to transcendentally extract the passports and cash from out of a steel safe, can't see any other way of getting them
Keep your eyes peeled
Turkish has another look around the back (') Well  can't see anyone
After have got in go round the front and call me if you see anything
44 Turkish lets himself in and walks through
Everything seems to be fine
() 44   : He walks into his office, has a quick look around and makes his way to the safe under the floor
He decides to put the kettle on, does so, and his attention is caught by something, he looks at the cups on the side and sees that one is waiting to be made
He stands back and looks at the cupboards he sees that they are all open
Then he sees that the kettle is already boiled
Oink, oink
Where do you keep the sugar
Shit you scared the life outta me
You wait till you see what the pigs do to you
What brings you two here, run out of pants to sniff
That's very good Turkish
Very cool Turkish
Well what do you want
want two sugars in my tea
What do you want John
want to see him lying cold and still, but we aren't here for what we want are we Errol
Errol shakes his head slowly
Turkish's phone rings
They let it ring for a while
Well aren't you going to answer it
Turkish does
45
-- Tommy on the phone
() 45   : Brick Top's just landed, he's walking in the front,  would move it if were you Turkish
Turkish puts down the phone What's happening with the tea
Help yourself
You have to every thing else
That sounds like hostility, doesn't it John
Oh we don't like hostility do we Errol
No John we don't, but  am sure he could be pacified, what do you think John
Here you hold his arms, and ' l l hold his legs
In walks Brick Top before the boys have had a chance to get a grip
Brick Top
, Turkish
Got the kettle on
Turkish adapts to his new circumstances
You want sugar
No thank you Turkish,  am sweet enough
If  turn my back am  going to get a hole through it
Don't be silly Turkish, if  wanted you dead would  be talking
() () 45   : (2) (') Carry on
You've provided me with a problem, which you gonna have to remedy
gotta bare knuckle fight in a couple of days
want to use the pikey
Of course
Of course fuckin of course,  wasn't asking  was telling
But this time do want him to go down in the fourth
And  do mean it this time
Pause (') Now  know you,came back
to
open your safe, so now you can open it
There is nothing Turkish can do
46 Brick Top exits with Errol and John and grimaces with
the light
He's holding the contents of Turkish's safe
He's been a busy little bastard that Turkish
think you have let him get away with enough all ready gov
Brick Top looks round with some concern
It can get you into a lot of trouble thinking Errol,  shouldn't do so much of it
Pause as Errol wants the ground to swallow him up
(') Well that takes care of one little piggy, now find me the silly sods that blagged the bookies
Find em today
: () 46   : : : 47 The film stock is 1970s, and things seem more dated
This is confirmed by the dress of our man
Tony is standing outside a scrap metal yard and he is kicking the door of a portacabin
Open up Charlie
Fuck off
The only thing '11 open up is you
t ' s lucky you
got me Charlie, it could have been one of the other lads, and then think how much trouble you' d be in
You come through that door and you'll be going out prostrate
It doesn't belong to you Charlie
He kicks open the door
is standing behind his desk holding a pistol directly at Tony
On the table is a bag of what we must believe is coke, it's open, and Charlie has it all over his nose
(') You silly fucker, you can't go running off with other people's gear
How much you put up your nose
Charlie opens up, he fires four shots straight into Tony who buckles and falls to the floor
Tony seems only shaken and he holds his hands out to inspect them, he's bleeding
(') Oh you silly cunt
Tony stands and walks towards Charlie
Charlie is understandably shocked and fires another
It goes straight through Tony and we see the blood hit the wall behind
Go down-boy, go down
() 47   : Tony keeps going for him
Charlie raises the gun and points it at Tony's face and fires the last shot
The bullet goes straight into his mouth but it went in at an angle and it exits his cheek
Tony is standing there with six
bullet holes in him and bleeding all over the carpet
As he talks blood courses its way down his front and a strong lisp is frustrating the words
Ohh you'f in twouble nowf
Tony slowly extracts a short sword from behind him
Fear has set into Charlie's face and has rendered him useless
: 48 The car comes to a halt again
They, have only made forty this year
You could find the maker of this engine's signature on the engine
But you can't find me Franky
No it's true
can't find'him, but know a man that can
Cut to a shot of Hands encouraging him to continue
(') Tony
Bullet Tooth Tony
He'll find Franky for you
Who's he
Susi interrupts
What is he
' Would be a more appropriate question
Doug frowns at Susi, but continues
He's the best chance you have of finding Franky
() '                '               ' 48   :
He has upset every bad boy in town, at some point, or another but nobody's got the nuts to knock him off because they aren't sure whether you can kill the bastard
You really think he can find him
He'll find you Moses and the burning bush if you pay him to
Ok so let's get hold of him
Firstly you gotta understand he's a little strange
He could swing from trees wearing rubber dresses as far as  am concerned, all as  care about is whether he can find Franky
49
-- Turkish and Tommy pull up outside the pikey camp
Micky's Mum is sitting in her chair surrounded by kids
They're very nice Tommy
Thank you
Tommy has produced a bunch of flowers from somewhere
Turkish finds this a great surprise
Where did they come from
You're a snake in the grass Tommy
You looking for Micky
'Do you know where  can find him
Yes
Pause () 49   : Well would you like to share that information with me Ms 'Neill
don't want you getting my boy in to any trouble you hear me
He's my only boy and he's a good boy
(') He's coursing, he's a couple of fields that way
Pause What's coursing
50 Hare coursing
The gypsies can't get enough of it
What the fuck's a hare
t ' s a big rabbit
Why don't they call em big rabbits then
Because they call em hares
Tommy shrugs
So what's coursing
They set two lurchers, they are dogs before you ask, on a hare, that's the big rabbit
And the hare has to outrun the dogs
What happens if he doesn't
Well the big rabbit gets fucked doesn't it
() 50   : Tommy looks a taken aback by this statement
Come on, what, proper fucked
Yeah before the Germans get there Tommy
How can a dog fuck a rabbit
eh
If eats the bastard
51 Errol is curb crawling down a particularly seedy street in a car with John
They come to a halt, at the feet of some touter
Excuse me mate, d'ya know Mullet
The man looks a little 'further down the street
Errol follow his eyes, squints and seems to focus on something
(') Cheers pal
Errol puts on the gas a little-, the car surges forward and slows at the feet of Mullet - seedy looking character with big ears and a moody haircut, who smokes fat cheap cigars and wears his top shirt button fastened
Errol, John
Alright chaps
How's the gov'nor
Very well Mullet,  am sure he'll be flattered you inquired
Yeah let him know that  asked
We'll be sure to
Now come on Mullet what have you got for us about the gov'nor's bookies
did find something out as it happens,  knew a driver who was grafting that day
Don't stop with the foreplay
() 51   : White geezer, bit of a bounty
Eh
Bounty, black on the outside, white on the inside
Go on
He was doing a job for a couple of brothers in Smith Street
think it was a pawn shop
Porn as in filthy dirty
Pawn as in  have run out of money and here's my wedding ring
Good boy Mullet
52 Turkish and Tommy have found Micky who is in the middle of a field and is betting on with various dodgy characters
Well do you want to do it
That depends
On what
On you buying this caravan
He pulls out a catalogue on fancy caravans and points to the picture of the Rolls Royce of caravans
That's not the same caravan
This isn't the same fight
() 60
52   :    _                        - t ' s twice the fuckin size of the last one
The fight is twice the size
And my mum still needs a new caravan
Micky you are lucky we aren't worm food after your performance,  think buying a tart's mobile palace is a little fuckin rich
There is a pause while Micky frowns
Turkish looks a little sheepish
(') didn't mean that your mum was a tart
just meant
Save your breath for cooling your porridge
'll bet you for it
What like Tommy did last time
Do me a favour
' l l do you a favour, you have first     , bet
If  win  get the caravan, if lose 'l l do the fight for free
Turkish considers this, uneasily
He looks at the dogs they look keen and fit
Okay,  reckon the hare gets caught
But he's in
Gypsy Romany Music starts
Cut to slow motion, of dogs' enthusiasm,  of pikeys and their fingers skillfully dealing in money, inhaling cigarettes, etc
53
-- Slow motion
Errol and John are looking for Tyrone
54 Slow motion
Cut back to the dogs
The chase starts
55 Slow, motion
They see Tyrone, Tyrone starts to run
56 Slow motion
The hare sees the ,dogs and starts to run
57 Slow motion
They bail Tyrone into the back of a car
58 Slow motion
The dogs move out in a pincer movement
59 Poor Tyrone is bleeding in the boot of a car
60 The dogs move in
61 They bail Tyrone out of the car and into Brick Top's pub
Brick Top is waiting there
Brick Top asks questions
We can't hear what he's asking, but we can see that Tyrone isn't playing the game
62 The dogs are moving in
63 door is opened and Tyrone is thrown in
rabid Neapolitan mastiff pitbull hybrid that is attached to the end of a long pole with a lasso at the other end is brought in, it will quite clearly savage anything in its way
64 The hare gets caught and a pile of fur comes up 65 The dog bites Tyrone in the leg
Tyrone shouts in panic, the music breaks, we come out of slow motion and into real time
Ok, 'll fuckin tell you
66
The hare escapes the jaws of the dogs and is off
67 Turkish is getting into his car
You're are as mad as mars you are, why did you take that bet
What happens now
We buy him a caravan Tommy
There is something very wrong with this, it was us that wanted to buy a caravan off him
Why didn't you "bus a cap in his ass" then Tommy
Mind you, you would do more damage if you threw it at him
You saying  can't shoot
Oh no Tommy  wasn't saying you can't shoot,  know you can't shoot
What was saying is that six pound piece of shit stuck in your trousers there would do more damage if you fed it to em
Are you saying it doesn't work
You tried it
Tommy frowns -(') =
That Russian saves the shooters that        "' work for the faces, and  don't want to be the one that breaks it to you Tommy but you ain't a face
Go on try it
Tommy sticks the gun out the window and pulls the trigger
Nothing happens
( ) 67   :
(') Whoops
want to see that sneaky fuckin Russian
68 Vin and Sol are trying to wrap Franky's body up
Bad Boy Lincoln has been called in to help
What happened to him
He got shot in the face Lincoln, would have thought that was obvious
Well what do you want me to do about it
Sort it out
The only way to sort it out is to bring him back to life and  am not a fuckin witch doctor am
Villains are supposed to know how to get rid of bodies
Err, yes, but  have never actually got rid of one
Who is he
He's a man with a hole in his face Lincoln
Who cares who he is
Err well, let's wrap him up
What do you want to do that for
, He's not a fuckin Christmas present
69 Brick Top is on the phone and Errol and John sit opposite
() 69   :
Like  said  wasn't giving you a choice
am telling you that fuckin gypsy has got to fight
70 Turkish is on the other end of the phone to Brick Top
Tommy is trying to listen in to what is being said
am sorry, but he's a stubborn bastard, he says he's had enough, he says he's got to look after his old mum
His what
-
' His mum
Are' you taking the piss again
That's what he said, she's a nice old girl his mum
You're on thin ice Turkish, and  am going to be there when it breaks
He puts the phone down and inhales
(') Anything for an easy life
That fuckin pikey being difficult
Hello, we here
71 We see Errol outside with a glass cutter
He puts it around the door and creates a circle with the sharp side, pulls it out and puts his hand through to kill the alarm
He's in
- You coming John
Is a trout's head water proof Errol
wouldn't miss it for the world
() 71   : Get the governor John
John goes back to the car which is parked down the street
The window slides down
It looks like we are in gov
Oh goodie gum drops
Get us a cup of tea would you Errol
72 Vin, Lincoln and Sol are arguing Hold him by his legs
What do you think  am holding him by, his fucking ears
The interconnecting door opens slowly
Hope it ' s not a bad moment
Sol looks at Vin, Vin looks at Lincoln: they are understandably surprised
Brick Top looks around the room the silence continues
Brick Top helps himself to the most comfortable seat
(') Do you know who  am
Yeah  know
Good
That will save me some time then
Well  don't
What you gonna do with your man there
You're always gonna have problems lifting a body in one piece
Apparently the best thing to do is cut the corpse up into six pieces and pile it all together
() 72   : Would someone mind telling me who you are
After you got six pieces you gotta get rid of 'em, of course you can't just leave it in the deep freeze for your mum to discover, can ya
Pause while the black guys are still holding the body
The door opens and in walks Errol
He passes Brick Top a cup of tea in a take away container
Lincoln, who is this man
And then  hear the best thing to do is feed 'em to pigs
You gotta starve the pigs for a few days, then the sight of a chopped up body looks like curry to a drunk
You gotta shave the heads of your victims and pull the teeth out, you could do that after of course, but you don't want to go sieving pig shit do you
Ever seen the size of one of their molars
He holds up his fist (') They go through bone like i t ' s butter
You gotta have a few pigs though you need about sixteen they will go through a body that weighs two hundred pounds in about eight minutes that means that a single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh every minute,
Pause (') Hence the expression greedy as a pig
Pause Well thank you, that's a large weight off my mind
() () 72   : (2) (') But would you mind very much telling me who the' fuck you are
Other than a man that feeds people to pigs of course
The door opens and we see John, who is wearing a pair of extremely large plastic gloves, showing Brick Top the shotgu that he has found
Would you look at the size of this
Golly that is big isn't it Errol
He looks back at the brothers (') Do you know what Nemesis means
There is a pause (') righteous infliction of retribution by
an appropriate agent, personified in this case by a horrible cunt
Me
Brick Top stands and opens the door
We can see that a coupl of ropes have been slung over the rafters and a couple of buckets are underneath them
(including Errol and John) are standing around wanting to get busy
- Tyrone is with them, all trussed up
73
' '  is in front of Hands, Rosebud and Doug
Can  call you Tony
You can call me Susan if it makes you happy
You got nice teeth Susan
Tony demonstrates an interest in Rose Bud's
You don't, you should comb em some time
() 73   : Hands interrupts - Tony,  want to know if you can find me a man
Well then it depends on all the elements in the equation, how many ,                 are there
About forty thousand
Where was he last seen
At a bookies
bookies eh
Susi, pass us the blower
Susi reaches for the phone
74 The black guys are hanging upside down
Errol and John are now wearing industrial pinnies
Is this how you want him gov
No spin him round,  want him sunny side up
Mr Mclean  kid you not
Why do you think we have a dead man, missing an arm in our office
Give us four days and we'11 bring you a stone the size of a home
Brick Top considers this, and has a look at Errol who is more than enthusiastic to get on with the job at hand
What do you think Errol
think we should drip dry em governor, while we have the chance
() 74   : Brick Top again frowns at Errol
It was a rhetorical question Errol, what have  told you about thinking
He turns back to the brothers
(') You got forty eight hours
He looks at Lincoln
(') am going to take your man here
Pointing to Tyrone
(') You can keep this silly wanker
Hold on
Shut it or 'll cut ya
In forty eight hours '11 set the dogs on him and then the pigs on the remains
Brick Top nods at Errol who looks extremely disappointed
75 and Hands are driving along
Rose Bud is in the back
bookies got blagged last night
Blagged
Robbed
gotta see a man who looks like he might know something, but it can't be done on the phone if you know what  mean
He turns to Rose Bud
need a cun
( ) 75   : No you don't, Rose Bud my old son, you need me
76 Tyrone looks desperate
He set the dogs on me
Look
He shows his wounds to Sol and Vin
No wonder that sneaky fuckin Russian didn't want to do it
First things first, one of us, Tyrone, you get round to-the Russian's
The second you see him call us
You better be round with something substantial, don't turn up with a frown and a wagging finger
am on it Tyrone^
77 is in the car with Hands and Rose Bud
The car is parked at the feet of Mullet, who is in discussion with another horrible character
Mullet is extremely nervous about seeing Alright Mullet
Tony, alright mate
thought
, well  thought you weren't about anymore
:
: : Well what do you know
It's still warm the blood that courses through my veins
Unlike yours Mullet
Bt
t has a quick look down the street
() 77   : (') This job does have prospects after all, you travel to pretty places, meet interesting people
Btt looks at who Mullet is talking to, the man has a try hard mustache and interjects
Who the fuck gave you such a big mouth
Someone whom you might shortly meet
You threatening me
Only with wings and a halo
Mullet gives the man a furtive kick and makes eyes to shut up
, (') Clean the breakfast7off your top lip/ and make yourself busy sunshine
The man moves off (') want to know who blagged Brick Top's bookies
Oh do me a favour Tone
will do you a favour Mullet, 'll not bash the living fuck out of you in front of all your girlfriends here
don't know anything about that Tony
If you play hard to get 'Mullet you'll wish you'd never been caught
Mullet looks uncomfor'table about the fact that he's thinking
j                   ' () 77   : (
2) Make it worth my while at least
Jesus Tone you know how it is
Btt turns to Hands
Give us your wallet Hands
Hands makes eyes and digs into his back pocket and produces his wallet
takes out some notes and proffers them to Mullet, Mullet nervously reaches forward
As quick as you like Btt has Mullet by the collar and pulls Mullet into the car
He then raises the electric window on Mullet's throat until it has fastened Mullet to the roof of the vehicle
(') Comfortable Mullet
, Mullet has already gone pink
(') You can take as long as you like Mullet
Btt starts to pull away so Mullet has to keep walking with him
Fuckin hell what are you doing
am driving down the street with your head stuck in my window
What do you think  am doing you penis
He does the window up a bit tighter
And grabs him by the nose
He pulls a face when he smells his breath
(') You been using dog shit tooth paste Mullet
He speeds up even more
-
- Slow down
Err no  don't think 'l l slow down Mullet,  think  ' l l speed up could play you some music if you like
() 77   :   (3) turns on the radio
song comes on that he loves
(') Oh  love this track
Yes Mullet
It could be Tyrone Conway
Tyrone Conway
White geezer, thinks he's black, did a job for a pair of brothers who have a pawn shop in Smith Street
Tyrone Conway
Yes that's what  said
t ' s fuckin Tyrone Conway
It may be fuckin him, but wait and see what  can do to you
He puts his foot down and Mullet loses his footing, and is dragged along
'
What about
He points to Mullet
pulls an, 'oh yes  forgot about him1 face
He doesn't even look at Mullet
He lowers the window, and Mullet falls by the way, in god knows what condition
78 The music continues, and we have a montage of the black guys dealing with Bullet Tooth Tony and Hands as they arrive at the pawn shop
We see the corpse, we see Hands get irate and it looks like it's going to be the end of the black fellas again
The black guys try to whip out the big gun but Tony disarms them and takes the gun off them
The music ends along with the scene when Sol breaks
It's the Russian, well to be technical an Uzbekistan
() 78   : Russian
The sneaky dogs
been doing business with those sneaky dogs
Boris
looks familiar with this name
Dear oh dear, you do know some horrible people
79
' Russians,  didn't think it would be the Russians
Boris the Blade
heard of him, isn't he supposed to be a short little fucker that's covered in scars
Sneaky little shit one of the Russian dissidents, killed more men than,
well he's-killed a lot of men
Deals in arms, that he gets off some of the old school
We cut to the security monitor that observes the shop, it sits on Doug's desk
The door opens and in walks Boris
As bold as brass he walks up to the counter
Hold on
What's going on here
Doug picks up the phone to the downstairs shop
Susi picks up the receiver at the other end
Yes Dad
---   - What does that man want
t ' s hard to say, he's got a thick Russian accent
80
' They are obviously going to move in on the Russian
He's a bit sneaky this fella, so watch out
hate Russians
'll sort him out
Hands and  both look at Rose Bud and look relieved for the offer
He's all yours Rose Bud
81 Micky is looking at his caravan; it's in flames, real proper roaring flames
People are desperately trying to put the flames out
Micky is covered in dirt from his futile efforts
One of the other pikies who's involved in trying to extinguish the fire turns round and sees Micky standing there motionless
He can see he's upset
What's wrong with Micky
His mam was in there Patrick
They burnt his mam
All real sound recedes and we drift in to music
The camera slowly tracks in on Micky
It's hard to read how devastated he is
The camera reaches Micky's face, the reflections of the flames can be seen in his water swollen eyes, but his cheeks remain dry
82 is driving, Hands in the passenger seat and Rose Bud in the back
's got a bleeding eye and his hand is wrapped up in a bandage
Rose Bud is clutching his stomach
Sneaky was a bit of a fuckin understatement wasn't it
What do you want me to do
Your man there thought he could take him told you he was dangerous
How you doing Rosey
() 82   :
Hands looks at Rose Bud who's holding his midsection
You're going to have to get me to a hospital, let's shoot that fucker
Then get me to a hospital
We gotta get this stone first Rosy and then we'll get you to a hospital
83
' Vin and Sol are going through a selection of keys they have, trying to open the front door
Lincoln's got some tools here, when he has had a few drinks he gets em out and runs around the house holding a pistol in each hand, telling me about what a bad boy he is
Do you know where he keeps em
They find the right key
Well they ain't gonna be lying on the kitchen table Vince, we gotta have to look
Flick tlie switch
t ' s dark, they flick the switch
They look onto an immaculate pad
Music fades up along with the lights
Jesus
What's going on here
He likes his drum does Bad Boy Lincoln
The dog goes bounding in
(') Well let's get busy
BORIS1 84 's car pulls up outside Boris1 house
and Rosebud pull Boris up in the boot
Tyrone who is hanging about nearb keeping watch, witnesses this
Rosebud places a blade at the Russian's neck
() 77
84   : think you have got something to tell us
Take it easy Rosy, take it easy
looks at the blood that's already starting to pierce the skin from where the blade is pressed against the Russian's neck
then looks at Hands with concern
You want him to be able to talk or not
85
' Sol and Vin have found the weapons and are tossing them from hand to hand
didn't know did
They always looked the shit to me
What are we gonna do with em Sol
Shut your mouth Vince, this is all we got, so this will have to do
Sol's mobile rings
(') Yes
86
' Boris is here
87
' Now
That's why  am calling you
We're coming over
Hold him there
Sol puts the phone down before he has to hear what Tyrone has to say
() 87   :
S7 (') Leave that dog here Vince, we gotta                      * go
They shut the dog in the main room and go out of Lincoln's house
88
BORIS1                                                 88 (continuing after                                  * Sol's put the phone                                * down)                                               * He's not on his own
89
'                                                 89 We cut to Vinny and Sol tearing round to Boris's
They're driving Tyrone's car
As they arrive, Tyrone jumps out in the middle of the road
They screech to a halt, narrowly avoiding squashing Tyrone
Where is he
t ' s not just a he, there are three
* of them in the house with him
Why didn't you tell us Tyrone
Tyrone pulls a " tried" face
Do they look hard
They look fucked up
"                     * Well get in and let's load up
Vin whips out a gun
* Load them up with what
* * What's wrong with them
They're replicas
() 89   : Hold tight rudy, are you fuckin mad
Do you know who these people are
No  don't Tyrone, but  do know don't want to be eaten by pulled apart by dogs and then eaten by fuckin pigs
90 Tommy and Turkish are looking on to the burned out caravan
They are in shock
There is a whole gathering of dodgy, angry looking pikies standing around, giving Turkish and Tommy some bad looks
Jesus  am sorry Micky
am really sorry
He's a mad bastard
Darren decides to interject
Who are these the boys Micky
Darren's eyes are full of poison
Tommy and Turkish suddenly feel very uncomfortable
Back off Darren
What kind of cunt would turn up here if they knew what had happened
Leave my business to me boy
Darren spins on his heel (') got a message that he wanted me to fuck you two off, that's why  wanted you back
' l l do the fight before he causes any more carnage, but  ' l l only do it if you're there
Why
Because  know he fuckin hates ya
91
'  -- Turkish and Tommy are driving
Turkish is drinking a pint of"milk (as usual)
There is silence for a while
() 91     : It's not warm the blood in his veins is it
gotta say
1 don't like this Tommy
This has got very fuckin messy
Jesus you know how he felt about his old girl
think we should get you a new gun Tommy, but this time try '
it
How far is the Russian's
We'll be there in a minute
He takes a sip of his milk
There's a pause
(') It's not the same
What
Milk, in these cartons
You shouldn't drink that stuff any way
Why, what's wrong with it
It's not in synch with evolution
Shut up
Cows have only been domesticated in the last eight thousand years, before that they were running around mad as lorries
The human digestive system '"' hasn't got used to any dairy products yet, it takes a lot longer than that
Well fuck me Tommy, what have you been reading
() () : (2) 91 (') Cows mad as lorries eh
You hear about the two cows having a chat in a field
One says to the other, "what do you think about this mad cows' disease then
The other one looks back and says "doesn't bother me, 'm a duck
Turkish looks back at him blankly
Here let me do you a favour
He reaches over and grabs the carton from Turkish, and throws it out the window
The milk obviously hits an on-coming car in the other direction
There is a terrible crashing noise
Tommy and Turkish come to a standstill, and look back to see a small pile up on the other side of the road
(') What was in that milk
92
' , Hands and Rose Bud are standing over a safe
They are looking at a whole pile of money
The case is open and Hands is holding the stone
He's a sneaky fucker that Russian
Well shall we go
What you want to do about the Russian
want to bury him
BORIS1 93 Hands, Tony and Rosebud walk out
94
' The black guys witness this
Tyrone's now in the front seat driving
Well come on let's have em
Pause while they consider this
() 94    :    - (') Well come on
Not so fast Vin we can't get em now we gonna have to follow them
's car moves off
The black guys follow
' l l move in
It'll be ok
is very close to , and  is close to
fucking
You know what  stands for Tyrone
It stands for
It stands for
shut your fuckin mouth Tyrone and leave the talking to us
Let's get these ready
Do they fire
Pointing to the guns
' Of course they fuckin fire
How do you know
They're replicas, what do you know about replicas
Sol looks at the gun and frowns, "what does he know about replicas"
He pulls the trigger
He fires one shot
It is very loud, the gun goes off near Tyrone's ear, he buckles in pain
The car does a massive swerve and everything nearly ends in disaster, all the windows shatter including the windshield (but the glass stays put)
Tyrone regains some control over the car
{') What the fuck do you think you're doing Sol
Jesus,  didn't know it was that loud
() 94   : - Well just how fuckin loud did you think it was going to be
It's a- fucking gun Sol, guns are renowned for making a loud fucking noise whenever you pull the trigger
You wanted to see if they worked
didn't mean try it in the fuckin car Sol
Well they work,  reckon they are really going to put the shits into em
Right now  am not concerned with putting the shits into em Sol,  am " "
concerned about taking the pain out of my ringing fucking ears
Look what you did to poor Tyrone
Tyrone you alright
He taps Tyrone on the shoulder
Tyrone looks up
(') Are you alright
Tyrone spins in his seat and answers a little too loudly
am fuckin deaf
What have you done to my car
They crash into the car in front
Boris the Blade comes flying through the windshield
95
-- (This scene runs concurrently with scene 91) -
How we going to get rid of him
You want to shoot him
t ' s a bit noisy isn't it
() 95   :    - Well you want to stab him
- That's a bit cold blooded isn't it
You want to kill him or not
' 1 1 cut him
That's the spirit
There's a sword back there
He points to behind a seat: there is a bloody great sword concealed
Tony skillfully passes the sword to Rose Budd, who attempts to pull it out of its scabbard
Tony turns round to Hands
(') You, you want a knife
He passes Hands a knife
wouldn't know what to do with it
It's not a fuckin rocket launcher
It's a knife for gods sake, what have you used for to keep your fork company for all these years
It's got a sharp side and a blunt side
You want a lesson
There is a sudden bang on the windshield and  turns back to the front only to see the windshield covered in milk
Tony can't see where he is going and searches for the windshield wipers
While this is happening the car swerves to the side and hits a lamp post
They crash and the boot (trunk) has flown open and Boris the Blade tries to lift himself out
Rose Bud looks down at the sword he has been extracting he can see he very nearly cut himself in two
Tony pulls himself up from the steering wheel he has a trickle of blood running down his face
There's a crash and a car hits em from behind
96
'  -- They too are recovering from the accident
And Boris has now come headfirst through the windshield
() 96   :   - You idiot what have you done
Is that Boris
97
' What happened
We hit something and something hit us
He turns and sees that Rose Bud has got a sword sticking though him
It's gone through him and the seat that he is sitting on
98
' Let's hit em now
The is a dead Russian on my lap Sol am not thinking about hitting anybody right now
Well you better start thinking Vince because otherwise you'll be fuckin lucky if you end up looking like that
99
'
You alright
No  am about a rocket ride from right Tony
mean do you feel alright
Ohh yeah,  feel like  am lying on the naked lap of Aphrodite, cooled by the tumbling petals of spring roses, how the fuck do you think feel
() 99     :     - Hold tight big man, and put your guns away
Let's get going
What about Rose Bud
Well you can bring him with you if you want but which bit do you want to bring
100
' They are getting out
Well get down, the last thing we want him to see is three brothers wearing ski masks
1
01 and Hands, covered in blood, walk off the street into a cafe
gotta clean up
He goes out the back while  goes to the pay phone to call Doug
102 The black guys pile out of the car and follow  and Hands at a safe distance
103 is on the phone Doug, we are in the shit, come and pick us up
104
BORIS1 Tommy and Turkish pull up outside Boris' house
He's left the door open
() 104   :    - shouldn't think that's a good idea
Shall we have a look
don't want to go in there, he's a dangerous bastard, taken too many disco biscuits in the heat of Russian disputations, he's got as many of these nuts as those nuts
He grabs his groin and circles his finger and his temple don't care if he's got fuckin hazel nuts,  want a gun that works
Well come on then before the Germans get here
105
The black guys have followed  and Hands and are waiting outside, readying themselves for action
'
Now Tyrone you go
Tyrone, oi Tyrone
Tyrone can't hear a thing
'11 never forgive you Sol
Sol taps Tyrone on the shoulder
When we get in you wait by the door am number one, Vin number two and you are number three
106 The black guys enter
has just finished his phone call and sat down
-
don't want a fuss and  don't want to put a bullet in your face, but unless you give me exactly what want there will be murders
shakes his head in amazement
() 106   :    - (') Number three pull the blind down
Tyrone can't hear this request
lo number three, he said pull the blind down
He still can't hear him
This is minorly embarrassing
(') 'll sort it
Stand up
Excuse me, but who the fuck are you
You hear what
1 said
Stand up, unless you're crippled
Do  look crippled
, You'll look fucking dead, unless you stand up
Sol cocks the gun and Tony pulls a sarcastic ' am shocked' face
You got ballsl You want to test em
There are two types of balls, there are big brave balls and there are little mincy faggot balls
'-- - * '
- p-
You're a dead man talking
These are your last words so make them a prayer
Vinny takes aim
() 106   : (2) So you're obviously the big dick, and they on either side of you, must be your balls
Vin goes to hit him with the gun but it's caught by Tony, Vin tries to pull the nose out of Tony's hand but he can't move it
Sol steps forward and raises his gun
Let go of the gun
Vinny cocks his gun
There is a pause and eventually Tony lets go of it
am talking for your benefit
Now dicks have drive, and clarity of vision
Tony starts to build himself a complicated looking weapon under the table, unseen by the black guys
He takes bits out of one sock and bits out of another sock
(') But they're not clever, they smell pussy, and they want a piece of the action, and the dimmer the dick, the less he cares about the consequences, and you thought you smelt gooood ol pussy, and have brought your little mincy faggot balls along for a gooood ol time, but you have got your parties muddled up, there is no pussy here, just a dose to make you wish you were born a woman
We cut to the shell shocked brothers, and the almost completely built weapon
(') And just like a prick, you are having second thoughts; you're shrinking, and your little balls are shrinking with you
They stare on
The brothers have lost this one and they know it
They start to reverse
lets the odd chicken cluck out the corner of his mouth, Vinny misses his step and waves his gun about in a futile effort to look mean
They back away into the corridor down to the back door of the cf
ae 107
-- and just as they turn the corner they bump into Hands still drying his hands, they can see that he's carrying a case that they recognize
The brothers adapt to their new scenario: Pass it me
Hands hesitates
108
-- can hear that the black guys and Hands have run into each other and pulls out the complicated looking gun which is now in one piece
cocks the gun and aims it at the wall which the brothers would be behind, he follows the wall simulating the speed of their journey
109
-- -
'- won't ask again He raises his gun
covey of bullets perforates the wall, one hitting Vin in the hand
The brothers take the opportunity to duck
Hands dives for cover too and drops the bag
continuation of bullets comes flying through the wall
The black guys take the opportunity to pick the bag up and leg it
110 '
' 111
' The brothers are standing in front of Brick Top, they move uneasily from foot to foot
Brick Top examines the stone
He looks up
Quite a lump
Alright you can go         ' now
' Any chance of taking Lincoln with us
That's where Errol's taking ya
() Ill   : They turn and Errol is waiting for them
Follow me
They go out of one room into another, and Errol shuts the door behind them
Vin looks uncomfortable
Another door is opened and a man brings out Lincoln
Lincoln is in bad shape and is relieved to see familiar faces, they are now shut in a room
You alright Lincoln
Do you know why the governor is the governor
Err
t 's because people are scared of him
You know why they are scared of him
Err
It's because of stories
am sure you've heard one or two of those stories
For example, did you hear about the three black fellas that did a very bad thing, however they made some effort to redeem that very bad thing, so the governor saw fit not to kill em
He thought it would be a more advantageous concept to let them kill each other and let the survivor live to tell the tale
That way everybody wins, well, all except the two that died of course
We look at the table where we see three large kitchen knives sitting provocatively
Tyrone rushes for one of the blades grabs it and runs at Vin, Vin sidesteps and Tyrone keeps running straight into the arms of Errol who raises his gun at the last moment
Tyrone slides the blade into Errol 's ribs and Errol fires a shot straight at Tyrone
The bullet passes through Tyrone and hits John in the throat
Vin, Lincoln and Sol are left wondering what the fuck has just happened
() 111   :    (2) , Grab it
What
The gun you prick
Sol goes for one, and Vin goes for the other
112
, There is a wake in motion
We cut to Micky and Turkish
It is obvious that a lot of hard core drinking has been going on, and there is an Irish band playing
The is a coffin in the middle of a caravan that is closed for obvious reasons i t ' s surrounded by heavy looking lads
The is a man dancing on one of the tables
113
'             ' All three black guys are sitting in front of  and Hands and Doug
There is silence as the white guys have just been told something disturbing
eventually breaks the silence Well you gotta admire their balls
_  don't want to admire balls that want to chop off
What choice did we have
know sorry doesn't mean fuck all, but we are game on, what do you want us to do
Get us that stone back
So Brick Top has now got the stone
He's got it
() 113   : You wouldn't be lying to us would you now
Why should we
Could just have disappeared
Cut to Hands who's thinking
Okay
114
' and Hands are at the bar
You got some front coming round here ain't ya Tony
Never mind what  got ,  am looking for Brick Top
You mean Mr Mclean
You know who  mean you fucking fringe now find him
Pause: the barman looks truculent
(') Chop chop
The barman walks down the end of a bar and picks up the phone
What was it you did exactly Tony
had a little run in with a few of the chaps
How ' s that
They're all brainless, they got white powdered angels sitting on their shoulders telling them what was what, all too busy
() 114   : - He sticks his finger by the side of his nose and inhales
(') If they weren't sniffing the dust they where flicking the ash
And never trust who puts anything other than a finger up his nose
, another of Brick Top's men, appears from somewhere and approaches Tony with another heavy,
Follow me
They do and end up in a corridor
The door
shuts behind them and the door in front hasn't yet opened
Ken turns around and faces Tony
(') Did you know that it was my cousin Lorrie you stabbed
There is a pause
The situation is volatile
Yes  know  stabbed a man called Lorrie, but no  didn't know he was related to a tub a shit
Ken knows it's on
Shut that door Sean
Lock that fuckin door Sean
takes a step forward and puts his hand, into the back of his trousers
He starts to growl
(') You're a big man, but  don't care if you're ten foot fuckin tall, you still got eight pints of blood and you'll bleed like any bastard
And when
drop
ya, and  will fuckin drop ya, 'll open you up like a packet of crisps
Pause to take in what has just been said then he continues
(') You're a bully Ken, but remember, am a bigger bully
() 114   : (2) The door opens and they are interrupted by another
Ha, Ken what' s going on
Bring em through
The governor wants to see em
Ken is relieved by the interruption, and he leads the way with a truculent "you're lucky" stare
They enter Brick Top's office
gotta say you have got some front coming round here Tone, you know the lads are picking straws
Interrupted You gotta diamond and it doesn't belong to you, it belongs to my colleague here
That's what  love about you Tone, no small talk
said we should come round and raise fuckin hell, you know shoot a few of the boys and that, but he said he thinks we would have more success if we paid for it
So  am going to have a drink and let you two discuss what you have to discuss
Btt walks to the bar
Ken is sitting there with Sean
(') Alright big man,  hope you aren't bitter about your cousin Lorrie
If you listen carefully, you will hear a slight zip of flies being undone
You know you're alright when they're are talking business,  ' d like to see you gob off outta here
Ohh do me a favour Ken, you've always been mouth and no trousers
() 114   : (-3) We cut back to Brick Top and Hands - 'l l pay for it,  won't pay you the top fuckin whack but you'll never get that anyway
You got it
can't sell you something  haven't got now can
returns to them - there is a scream from Ken You're a dead fuckin man
You listen to me Tony you're a dead fuckin
Brick top frowns at Ken, and Ken shuts up quickly
What did you do to upset Ken, Tony
Tony shrugs He's pissed in my fuckin pocket, look
Ken shows off a wet-sided jacket and a damp set of trousers
Do shut up Ken
That was a bit naughty Tony
Tony shrugs
Brick Top puts his hands in to his pocket and withdraws the stone
We cut to Hand's expression
Well come on, let's have a look
Brick Top passes the stone to Hands
All goes quiet while everybody focuses on the stone
Hands lifts it up to his eye
(') What are you playing at
- He drops the stone: it smashes on the ground
(') It's a zirconia
We crash track in to Brick Top's expression of shock
115
(' ) The four black guys are trying to pick the lock of the vault, having been locked in it by Bullet Tooth, Hands and Doug
changed the stone
You what
changed it
know Brick Top knows nothing about stones
Yes but Doug the fuckin head does
Yeah well  didn't expect them to lock us up in here did
Ohh your one clever bastard Vin, you really are
Where is it
It's at Lincoln's
What the fuck's it doing at my place
Waiting for us to pick it up
What happen if they find that it's a fake stone Vince
Well we are going to get fucked Sol what do you think is going to happen
The door opens
Ohh yes you are going to get fucked Vince
- 116
distant voice is shouting Oi Micky
Oi Micky
117 '
-- We fade out of black to Micky's pov
Thisis shot in slow motion
Micky opens his eyes, in the backof
a large van, there is only one faint light that moodilyilluminates his tired eyes
You feeling alright Micky
've felt better
We are nearly there
They are a horrible bunch this lot Micky so pay attention to what you are doing
Micky just yawns
(') Put up some kind of a show, he's a hard bastard this "good night" Anderson so don't get too clever, he used to be a pro
Just keep moving round the ring, and let the odd one go when push has come to shove
Let's get on with it, shall we
118
-    ' temporary ring has   been erected, four scaffolding posts with welded on hoops   make the arena, the ropes that are threaded through the   hoops are industrial nylon and free of padding
Around the    ropes it's starting to fill
Brick Top approaches Salt Pete   and Jack 'the all seeing eye'
, hope we gonna get a better show this time
This will make up for it
Micky's going down in the fourth
Terry over there is in charge of   the bets
Now you'll have to forgive   me
Brick Top leaves with Ken
(') Have we got the lads at the- camp site
() 118   : Yeah they are there
Cut to a shot of some of Brick Top's heavies waiting in a car outside the campsite
Where's that fuckin pikey
119 Brick Top is standing in front of Micky whose eyes are still semi open
What's wrong with you
You stoned
Is he fuckin stoned
- He's like that before a fight
He turns his attention to Micky
Now you know when you're going down
Of course he knows when he's going down
Hey fuck face, who's speaking to you
He asked him didn't he
Fuck face
like that,  ' l l have to use that one next time - want to impress your mum Ken
The fourth
or was it the fifth
There's a campsite full of pikies that might not think you're so fuckin funny when they 'are putting the flames out on their children's backs
Cut to a shot of Brick Top's boys lighting a cigarette in the car outside the pikies
120 Micky appears from a small door at the back of the warehouse
He approaches the ring accompanied with shouts of encouragement and counter shouts
He's wearing a pair of semi cut tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt with grease marks down the front
Turkish walks behind him, Micky still looks bored
He climbs into the ring
Then from the same door as the one through Micky came out walks a larger character with a nose that appears to have seen countless rounds with a frying pan:  ' NIGHT1
Alright lads no eye gouging no biting
Do your worst
Back to your corners
We drift again into Micky's pov, his world is becoming more and more surreal
He can faintly hear Turkish whispering words to him, but he's not really listening
bell comes from somewhere, and Micky instinctively walks to the center of the ring
"Good night" is already there, they pace one another for a second or two, Micky avoids a punch or two and then he takes a hard one and he knows it, we flash to white, Micky's in trouble: he lets one of his missiles go and it shakes "good night" to his core, all goes quiet
We go to super slow motion: his knees buckle and "good night" is in trouble
Micky maintains a frown as he watches his opponent's knees threaten to betray him
The crowd tries to digest what is happening
After a period of silence reality dawns
Brick Top mouths the words in silence
"Don1t go down you fucker"
The crowd wants Micky to finish the job
But common sense reins back the coup de grace
"Good night" eventually regains control of his legs and stumbles forward, after a few sleepy punches he starts to provide a serious onslaught
don't like the look of this Tommy, bring the van up to the back door
This goes on for two rounds (which is montage down to a few seconds)
We go in the mind of poor Micky
We break the music just as it's starting to look dangerous
The bell goes and Micky walks to the wrong corner
Turkish pulls him back to his corner
(') They are on ya
You got to hurt him Micky
Otherwise we are rumbled
you hear me Micky
Do -something, it looks like it' s rigged
Micky goes out again his hands are low,  there is a flash of white as Micky goes down in the dirt
Dust rises from where he fell
He gets up quickly, his hands are still low, he goes down again, in no time he's up
() 120   :    - : he hits the ground again and this time when he hits the deck, he penetrates the dust covered floor, like i t ' s made out of water
He falls through the water like he's sinking; his eyes are open and he can't breathe, he continues to fall, but he's unpanicked (he is now Micky 1)
When Micky 1 looks up he can see himself in the corner of the ring takin kidney punches from Good Night, he's winded and only semi- conscious (this is Micky 2)
Micky 1 makes the effort to swim up and tries to penetrate the floor but he's stuck he can't get through
Micky 2 takes more punishment in the ring, as Micky 1 ' s hand continues to try to break the underside of the floor but it stretches like rubber and forces Micky 1 down again
Micky 1 looks up again and sees how much trouble Micky 2 ' s in the ring
Micky 1 is panicking now, he's running out of oxygen and Micky 2's being beaten, Micky 1 starts -to sink again but now flames tickle the bottom of his feet he looks up
and sees Micky 2 being smashed to hell, his body eventually collapses and Micky 2 falls through the floor
And as the latter falls through, Micky 1 manages to rise from the depths and his punch manages to perforate the surface
The punch continues its trajectory and has the power to fell a red blooded rhino
it catches "Good Night" on the jaw and it's good night for "Good Night" it's unlikely that he'll awake in the next hour
Dear oh dear everybody is in trouble
Again we cut to the reactions of the relevant parties
(') Tommy get the van
have it, it's waiting
Turkish jumps into the ring and grabs Micky
We are off Micky, hold tight, and move quickly
, Turkish pulls Micky away
It's not as hard as it might be trying to get out, because the crowd seems to have found its own disputes, chairs start to fly
Brick Top's boys are frustrated in the mayhem
Brick Top calmly dials into his mobile telephone
It rings
121
, Darren picks up the phone
If you would you like to speak to your friends, you'll have to speak a little -louder
() 121   : We pull back to see four slumped heads in the car and blood staining the windscreen
Brick Top calmly puts the phone down
Right lets get outta here
Brick Top is looking every which way and trying to get out of there, accompanied by Ken
(
') Where's the car Ken
t ' s coming now
We are outta here
They come out of a side entrance, their car pulls round the corner and screeches to a halt
Brick Top opens the door as he is about to get in, he's eyes widen to the size of saucers as   (who we recognize from the wake) are sitting in the place of his driver
They both have sawed-off shotguns and empty four barrels into the chest of Brick Top and Ken
The car spins away, leaving their twitching bodies on the dirt
122
'
Hands, Doug and Bullet Tooth have Vin, Sol and Bad Boy Lincol in tow
They look at the front room of Lincoln's house
Very nice Lincoln
Veeeery nice Lincoln
(') Well where is it
Next door
They open the door
123
'
This room is a complete mess
All the colony leather has been chewed up beyond recognition
They all grimace at the smell
The dog comes running up () 123   :    - Look what your dog's done to my leather
It's a bit funky in here
opens a window
The dog looks extremely relieved to see someone
You keep a good house Lincoln
So where's this stone
It was over there
He points to a pile of chewed up cushions
Where
We left it in a box over there
somewhere
He walks over and finds the remains of the box
(') t ' s empty
Tony
Dear oh dear
He's not fuckin about, we left it there
It must be in the dog
All eyes focus on the dog
Well let's have a look shall we
Tn
oy All eyes focus on Tony
What
Have a vlook in the dog
() 123   : ( 2 ) What do you mean have a look in the dog
mean open him up
Tony is not sure about this
t ' s not a fuckin tin of baked beans, what do you mean open him up
mean open him up
Hands does a movement that represents a knife across the throat
That's a bit strong isn't it
You wouldn't have a problem if it was a person
But it's not, it's a dog and  have never done a dog
My heart bleeds
There is another pause , What dp  do
Let me take a wild and reckless guess
Stick a knife in his guts and see if it's got a diamond in there
'll hold it still and'you open it up
Tony looks positively unsure and rocks his head from side to side
Fuckin hell, alright then
You can't do that
() 123   : (-3) Well do it to you as well if it makes you feel any better
Cut to Tony having some problems trying to get hold of the awkward dog
The dog starts to squeak
Tony passes the blade to Hands
t ' s squeaking
What, you've never heard a dog squeak before
Hold him still
The dog isn't sure about this either
Vin is in a panic and suddenly
Stop
can see it
can see the stone
Hands at the point of entry stops
Vinny hops over to the stone and picks it up
Tony lets the dog stand but keeps a grip oh the collar
The dog is relieved to be semi-liberated
Hands is still on his knees armed with an incredulous stare
Well let's see it
Vinny holds it up
There's a sense of relief
He then throws the stone, it cuts through the air
And the dog seeing another projectile runs to intercept it
There's a pause while all now focus again on the dog
This is digested literally and mentally
The dog recognizes all the attention it's receiving
And goes through the motions of swallowing it
Hands attempts an approach
The dog understandably feels uncomfortable about the advancing vanguard and decides emergency action is needed, and seeing the open window launches itself out of it
124
; The pikies have moved overnight
Well this is where they were
() 124   :    - Well they aren't fuckin here now are they
And  can't see a dog can you
They can't be far
125 Hands,  and the black guys are back on the road
You gonna have to come up with something
Just then they see some caravans in the distance
There they are
126 All the caravans are fastened to the back of cars
Vinny, Sol,  and Hands are standing in front of Micky
Well he's didn't come back to us
But he always came back
Well you might have noticed that we have moved, you should have fed him more, a dog will never leave you if you feed it properly
It was a good dog, he had a little flatulence problem but was a good dog
Are you sure he's not here
think  would have noticed if a fuckin dog was sitting in my caravan don't you
Tommy, Turkish, have you seen a dog sitting in me caravan
can't say  have Micky
See there you have it
() 126   : Do you mind if we have a look around
What the fuck's got into you lot
It's only a dog
'l l give you another one, if it means that much to you
127 Vinny, Sol,  and Hands descend the steps, they look like children with their toys taken away
You better find me that dog, skinny Vinny
One of Micky's kids is on the bottom of the caravan steps as the brothers walk by
1 looked after your car for ya
So
1 So aren't you gonna pay me
Yeah bollocks
1 Bollocks to you, you tight git
Watch your mouth you cheeky shite
1 Yeah fuck ya
The kid turns away and goes back to squeezing a toy
All four of the chaps stop in their tracks
Cut to shot of squeaky toy
We have seen this toy before
Cut to freeze frame of Sol, Vin,  and Hands stopped dead in their
tracks
They haven't turned to look over their shoulders yet, but their eyes are turning to look
