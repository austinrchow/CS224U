Every morning
It happened again
David, the girl is absolutely useless
You've got to get me someone who knows what she is doing
Excuse me
'm not getting any of my mail, nothing has been filed
Ever since she got engaged, my life has been a disaster
You know, she came so highly recommended
She spent the last three months writing down her married name
Mrs
Judy Hicks
Mrs
Donald Hicks
Mrs
Judy Mitchleson Hicks
Sometimes with a hyphen, sometimes without a hyphen
Sometimes she spells the hyphen
Well,  really don't know where  can put her
Put her on unemployment
When can you start
Soon
25 thought we'd start you out with preschoolers
Should take you a few days
Give you a chance to find your way around
Do you smoke
Well, uh, just once, but
Only on breaks in the coffee room
Most of that is pretty straight forward stuff
If you have any questions, come to me
Good luck
Bye
26 Psst
Psst
Hey
Hey
'm Scott Brennan
Uh, 'm Josh Baskin
Listen, what are you trying to do
Get us all fired
Huh
You've gotta slow down
Pace yourself
Slowly
Slowly
Sorry
Today's my first day
know
So how long have you worked here
Five years
Work stinks but the fringe benefits are great
See that girl over there in the red
Say hi to her and she'll be yours
She'll wrap her legs around you so tight you'll be begging for mercy
Well, 'll stay away from her then
Excuse me
Yeah Brennan
gave it to you yesterday
Oh, here it is
don't have time to xerox it
Let the new guy do it
27 That's total bullshit Paul
Look sir, the favorability rate is
Come on
Let's not lie to ourselves
If a kid likes a toy it sells
That's all
But every bit of research and focus testing
It works with research, it works with focus testing, it just doesn't work with the kids
Sorry
'm sorry
Why don't you watch where the hell you're going
Are you okay
'm fine
You could kill somebody running around here like that
It's all right Paul
The boss should get knocked on his ass once in a while
It's good for him
don't know sir, maybe you should see a doctor
For crying out loud Paul, 'm fine
'm fine
Sorry sir
Sorry
Where were you going anyway, son
Uh,  was going to the xerox room because they needed these by 5:00
Oh, that's good
Nothing wrong with a little hustle
Nothing at all
Right Paul
What does he mean
hustle
Uh sir
Sir
28 Hello
Hello
Hello
Mrs
Baskin
Yes
How are you
Who is this
just wanted you to know that Josh is all right
He's okay
You have my boy
Yeah
And you're gonna get him back, just the way he was
Look,  swear to God--If you do anything to him, if you touch one hair on his head,  will spend the rest of my life making sure you suffer
Wow
Thanks
Let me talk to Josh
Oh, he can't come to the phone right now
Why not
Why not
What did you do to him
didn't do anything to him
think he's a terrific kid
want proof that he's all right
Uh, well, all right
Ask me something that only he would know
Then 'll ask him for you and that way you'll know that he's okay
Ask him what  used to sing to him when he was a little boy
Isn't there something else that you would rather ask him
Ask him
Oh,  got it
got it
Memories, like the corner of my mind
Misty water color memories, of the way we were
Scattered pictures
Look, you're gonna see him again really soon
promise
cross my heart
We'll talk about this later

30 Hi
Hi
Okay, so how would you like that
Three dimes, a hundred dollar bill, and eighty seven ones
One, two, three

It wasn't that bad
It was the boat ride that did it
No, it was the pork rinds
Pork rinds
Aghh
We sure had fun, didn't we
Yeah, we sure did
32 Got you
What's your name
Jordan, what's yours
Mine's Josh
'm gonna blow you away Josh
But  just got you
No way
Get back here
33 You work for me, don't you
Yes
thought so
What, are you here with your kids
No
was just looking around
Oh
Me too
come here every Saturday
Can't see this on a marketing report
What's a marketing report
Exactly
Come on
What do you think of that
The Championship Hockey
Oh,  love it
Only the
Only what
Well, the pieces don't move
What do you mean
Well, on the old set you could slide the men up and down the ice, and now all they do is spin around
It was more like real hockey the old way
Why did they change it
don't know
You see, the Star Fighters are good because you can change all the pieces
But  never liked the Galactakons
You only get one robot, and they don't come with a vehicle
see
Plus you can't take them underwater
And if you do they
Neat
Okay, let's check out the
Piano lessons
Three years
Me too
Everyday, after school
Chopsticks
What department did you say you were in
Oh, 'm in computers
Computers
You just saved me a trip to the gym Son
34 Vice President in charge of Product Development
Vice President
He's only been here a week
Vice President
And he came from data processing
He's out of his mind
The old man has finally lost it
Did you know they gave him Bob's old office
Bob's office
Bob's office is bigger than my office
There's got to be a reason
Things like this don't happen unless there's a reason
35 That means if the president dies you get to take over
No
No
They got a hundred of them
Are we ready
Yes Mr
Baskin
Come on in
Look at this place
It's bigger than the principal's office
How would you know
Remember that explosion in science
Oh yes
Truck-a-Killer
$59
95
You know that only costs 10 bucks to make
Get out of here
What is this
Oh, well, this is just
They just put this in here
it doesn't mean anything
So what do they make you do for all this
Well,  play with all of this stuff and then,  go in there and tell them what  think
That's it
Yeah
And they pay you for that
Yeah
Suckers
Oh, thank you Miss Patterson
Hey
Miss Patterson
Could you call down to Media and have them send up a video tape of the Giants Broncos Super Bowl
And have them edit out all the commercials and talkin' and stuff
Yes Mr
Baskin
Miss Patterson
You're the luckiest guy  know
36 Did you check Mattel
Nothing
Colleco
Zero
He can't come from nowhere Susan
He has to come from somewhere
How about Hasbro
Yes
And Fisher Price and Worlds of Wonder
have called everywhere
Nobody's ever heard of him
Great
Face it Paul
The guy comes from data processing
Terrific
That is just terrific
This is just terrific
You're being paranoid Paul
37 These tests were conducted over a six month period using a double-blind format of eight over-lapping demographic groups
Every region of the country was sampled, the focus testing showed a solid base in the 9 to 11-year old bracket--with a possible carry-over into the 12-year olds
When you consider that Nobots and Transformers pull over 37 percent market share, and that we are targeting the same area,  think that we should see one quarter of that and that is one fifth of the total revenue from all of last year
Any questions
Yes
Yes
don't get it
What exactly don't you get
It turns from a building into a robot, right
Precisely
Well, what's fun about that
Well, if you had read your industry breakdown, you would see that our success in the action figure area has climbed from 27 percent to 45 percent in the last two years
There, that might help
Oh
Yes
still don't get it
What
What don't you get Josh
Well, there's a million robots that turn into something
And this is a building that turns into a robot
So what's so fun about playing with a building
That's not any fun
This is a skyscraper
Well, couldn't it be like a robot that turns into something like a bug or something
bug
Yeah
Like a big prehistoric insect with maybe like giant claws that could pick up a car and crush it like that
prehistoric transformer
Interesting
Gentlemen
So the robot turns into a bug
Ah, gentlemen, listen
Listen to him
He's got a very good idea here
The robot turns into a bug
This is a great idea
Different sizes and things
And
you could have them wreck something
lady bug
Transformers for girls
This is a bug that moves
It's got all kinds of possibilities
This doesn't just happen
This doesn't happen
You don't just come to a meeting and say "bugs
" , uh
Well done, Josh
Well done
38 Ho
Ho
Ho
He is vicious
He's not vicious
Oh, come on Susan, don't kid yourself
That man is a killer
All he said was " don't get it
" don't get it
don't get
don't get
He's going for the throat, trying to eviscerate me
Did you see the look on Macmillan's face
Mmm Hmm
39 It's quite a unique space
The lines are so clean and you don't get any of that partition quality
It has 50-foot ceilings, all hardwood floors, ample closet space, a modern kitchen, a brand new bathroom with a jet stream jacuzzi
We'll take it

Rental delivery
Dear Mom and Dad
They said that  could write you and let you know was okay
So far, they're treating me fine
've got enough to eat and 'm perfectly safe
They say that 'll get out of here in about a month
In the mean time, it's a lot like camp
watch  and even get outside once in a while
know you miss me
But try not to worry
think this experience might even be good for me
love you very much and  know that 'll see you soon
Your son, Joshua
Give Rachel a kiss from her big brother
41 It's very beautiful and 'm having a lovely time
'm glad Miss Patterson
It's much better than last year
just wanted to tell you that
'll have another scotch
Susan
Love your tux
think it's the same as the maitre's
Have you decided what you're doing on the Danberry line
No,  haven't
Well, uh,  think if you got everyone's input up front,  mean right from the beginning
Susan, have a drink
What
Have a couple drinks
It's a party
42 Josh
Glad you could make it
Bet he gets another raise
Now that's what  call a tuxedo
rented it
This is a real bow tie though
tied it myself
And that's why  was late
No, you're not late at all
Come on, let me show you around
Hey, there's Miss Patterson
Hi
There's the guy from the meeting
Hi
43 The guy's a damn knock-off artist
What do you mean
The Amphibian
He takes 10,000
Joes, slaps some gills on them, webs their feet, and packages them in seaweed
So  show him the schedule and he says, "It's not correct accounting procedure
"  Give me a goddamn break
But the toy sold Paul
Excuse me
44 Hi
Hi
All the same people having all the same discussion
It's like they cloned some party in 1983 and kept spinning it out again and again and again

It's Beluga
Macmillan orders it every year
You all right

You want something to drink
Could  have a milkshake or something

You want to get out of here

You know,  like things that are a little more intimate
Wow
Is this your car
Well, it's the company's car
Oh, this is the coolest thing 've ever seen

mean, just being with you here tonight, really get a sense of who you are
Are you gonna eat these fries
No
No
Hey mister
You want some of these fries
We're not going to eat them
No, thank you
You see, it's hard in a business situation

What, are you going to call someone before
No
Uh,  mean at this point in my life
Don't
Don't play with the radio
Leave the uh
Don't

Give yourself a couple of days, it'll pass
Well, they said it was gonna take six weeks
Well, it can be painful but, that's what they invented Xanax for, right
Watch your step

Do what
Well,  mean  like you and  want to spend the night with you

We could be like a team for the Macmillan Company
No
'm not very good at sports, but 'll give it a try
My best sport is video hockey
That isn't a sport
Well, it takes eye to hand coordination
It's not a sport if you don't sweat
What about golf
You don't sweat and that's a sport
Yeah, and you're not sittin' there letting some machine do all the work
What about car racing

Everything is a fight with him
Everyone's an enemy
It's not just a job for him, it's a war
Well how come you're so nice

Yes  do
You're one of the nicest people 've met
How do you do it

Shampoo, razor, toothpaste, two neckties and your exercise tape
Oh, and  want my keys back
Sure
It's just some scratches
He'll get over it
Oh, it has nothing to do with him
Oh come on Susan
He's just another link in the chain
First it was Tom Caulfield, then Handlen
Then Golding, then me
Am  missing somebody
It's not like that anymore
What is so special about Baskin
He's a grown up
Susan

What were you like when you were younger
Oh,  wasn't much different

've been thinking about you a lot
It's crazy
In my car, lying in bed
've just never gone out with someone like you
With all the other men there was so much to hide
feel like  can tell you anything
Susan
There's something  think  should tell you
What
59 You want the light on
60 Hey Frank, how are you
Good morning everybody
Good morning Sir
'd like some coffee please Miss Patterson
But you don't drink coffee
And uh, make it black

It is so pretty up there
Did anyone happen to see that great documentary about Columbus on the other night
Uh, no
Was it good

Yeah, the Santa Christina
That's right
He only had that on his second trip, though
You saw it, too
No, but  used to study
stuff
Really
Dad,  need some help
All right, but not now Adam
Yeah, but Dad you said
Adam we have guests
He's had the roughest time with algebra
We've tried tutors, everything
Algebra
used to study that, too
62 All right, let's say Larry Bird is going to score 10 points in the first quarter
Okay
How many is he going to score in the whole game
That's easy, that's 40 points
Probably
Okay
And that's algebra
Right
It is
Yeah

Okay
One quarter is to ten points that he scores in that quarter
Just as four
You're right
He's wonderful

Kind of like a sweepstakes
Get the Art Department on the phone
Get them
Send out for some sandwiches
Maybe next year, all right
Next year
65 You can do it
know you can
cannot plan a whole line
Why
Nobody knows more about toys in the entire company
Susan, doing that means marketing and strategy and stuff like that
All he wants is a proposal
can't
Look, you come up with the ideas and 'll handle the marketing
But it's
Come on
It'll be neat
All right
don't know

You've got great ideas
66 Yeah, well tell him  called again
Kopecky
--
Yeah right
well tell him it's important
67 You see it won't be like these where you just follow the story along
You would actually make a whole different story appear just by pressing these buttons
An electronic comic book
That's amazing
Yeah
An electric comic book
It's gonna be different every time
This is incredible
You're brilliant--you know that
If you like one you could see it, you know, over and over and over again
You're wonderful
You really like it
You think Mac will like it
You know, what we could do
We could do like sports comics
or like if you're going to steal second or something like that
You'd have sports books
baseball, football
really, it work with almost any sport there is
Hockey
What
What is it we're doing
What's going on here
You know, we're
Is something wrong
You don't like it
No
No
It's
mean if it's an affair, that's one thing
But if it's something else
mean, not that we have to know right now, we don't
but if we think that it could turn into something else
well
How do you feel about all of this
How do  feel about what
How do you feel about me
What is that supposed to mean
68 Well, Wednesday would be better than Thursday
Mr
Baskin can't be disturbed
Yeah,  have the Keating example right here
Where've you been
've been trying to reach you forever
Shh
'm right in the middle of something okay
That's the list
All you've got to do is call
Can you give me just a minute, please
What are you talking about
This is the list
Would you come back at lunch
All right, 'm a little bit busy right now
Hello

Are you out of your mind
Jesus, Billy
Miss Patterson, could you get them on the phone again
This is the list we've been waiting for
've got work to do
Can't you understand that
've got a deadline to meet
God
Who the fuck do you think you are
Hey
Hey, you're Josh Baskin
Remember
You broke your arm on my roof
You hid in my basement when Robert Diceman was about to rip your head off
You don't get it, do you
This is important
'm your best friend
What's more important than that, huh
'm three months older than you are--asshole
69 You are standing in the cavern of the evil wizard
All around you are the carcasses of slain ice dwarfs
Melt wizard
What do you want to melt him with
Throw thermal pod
Josh, what's wrong
What is it
haven't told you something because if  did,  didn't think you'd believe me
And even if you did believe me,  didn't think you were going to like me anymore, so
Oh, Honey, come here
You can tell me anything
What
Susan, 'm not what you think  am
What do you mean
Before  met you  was in little league
was in little league and rode my bike to school and  played with my friends and hung out with them and
Josh
Josh
What are you talking about
want to go home
miss my family Susan and  want to go home
Oh my God
You're married
No
No
knew that this was too good to be true
knew that there had to be something
No
No
Susan, 'm not married
You're not
No
'm a child
What
'm a child Susan, and 'm not ready for all this
Oh that's fine
That is just great
Well, you see what happened
No
understand
'm not ready to make a commitment
No
No
No
'm not ready to accept responsibility
No
You don't understand
mean, 'm thirteen years old
Oh
And who isn't
You think that there isn't a frightened kid inside of me, too
No
mean  really am thirteen
went to bed one night and  was a kid, and when  woke up the next morning  was a grown up
Oh right
And just yesterday  was a school girl with pigtails
Why are you doing this Josh
There was this carnival in New Jersey
made a wish on this machine
It was called a Zoltar Machine
Oh stop it
It was called a Zoltar Machine
It had this bobbing head that looked just like a devil and if you got a quarter in the devil's mouth you could make a wish and  did
So  made a wish to be big
That is what 'm trying to tell you
changed into a grown up but 'm really just a kid
Fine Josh
You're a kid
Look,  really don't know what it is that you're trying to tell me
But we have a very big presentation to give tomorrow, so 'm going to get some sleep
70 Josh
Josh
Oh, hi Mrs
Baskin
Hi
was just looking around and
Your hair is getting longer
got it cut yesterday
He had a birthday
Yeah,  know
He'll be coming back real soon
Everything is going to be okay
Thanks
Goodnight
71 Right there
Sea Point Park, New York
Well
Yes
They're waiting for you Mr
Baskin
Thanks
See you around
72 There's this flat screen inside with pictures on it and you read it
And when you get down to the bottom you have to make a choice of what the character's going to do
Like if he going to go in and fight the dragon then you have to push one of the buttons
Excuse me
Paul
don't get it
Well, it's a comic book that
See, there's a computer chip inside which stores the choices, so when you reach the end of the page, you decide where the story goes
That's the point
Terrific Susan
kid makes his own decision
This is really possible
Yeah
In fact, it's a very simple program
Isn't that right
So what happens when you run out of choices
Well, that's the great thing
You can just sell different adventures
Just pop in a new disk and you get a whole new set of options
We could market this on a comic book rack
'll be right back
73 How much would the unit cost
Well, our initial figure is around
around $7
00, with a retail cost of around $18
95
You expect a kid to pay $19
00 for a comic book
think a kid
Would you excuse me
74 Josh
Josh
75 Will you take me to Sea Point Park, New York
Sea Point Park
Josh
Josh
Josh
Yes
76 Excuse me
You know him
You know Josh
Yeah
Look, you have to tell me where he went
Who are you
'm his girlfriend
Billy Kopecky
Look, you have to tell me where he went
Where did he go
Please, tell me
Tell me
77 Work
Damn it
wish  was a kid
Josh
Susan
You know, you don't walk out on somebody
You don't just get up and leave and walk out like that
You don't do that
know
know
'm really sorry
'm really sorry but  didn't know what to do
didn't know what to say
Oh God
You got your wish
tried to tell you
didn't listen,  guess
didn't hear you
tried to tell you last night
or want to
or how would  have
or even if  did listen, why would  know
Why would  know that
've been thinking about this and there are a million reasons for me to go home but there is only one reason for me to stay
What
What reason is that
Well, you
Oh, come on
Don't cry
So, what are you
15
16
'm 13
Well, that explains it
Maybe you could come with me
No
No
Why not
've been there before
It's hard enough the first time
You know what  mean
You don't know what  mean
Come on, 'll drive you home
'm sorry
No, 'll be okay
You'll be fine
In ten years, who knows
Maybe you should hold on to my number
78 So this is where you live
Which one is it
The one right there
Oh
It's nice
'm gonna miss you
'm gonna miss you, too
You won't even remember me
Oh yes  will
79 Mom
Hello

Josh
Oh my God
Oh, thank God you're home
Oh Ma,  missed you all so much
80 'm just not good enough
What are you talking about
You've been hitting the ball over the fence almost every time in stick ball
You just got to get used to a fatter bat
You really think  could do it
Yeah
Come on
We'll hit some after supper
Okay
'll call you
