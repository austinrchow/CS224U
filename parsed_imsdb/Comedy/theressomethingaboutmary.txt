Strauss and Peter Farrelly & Bobby Farrelly There's Something About Mary Screenplay by Ed Decter & John
Strauss and Peter Farrelly & Bobby Farrelly Story by Ed Decter & John
Strauss (   ) 21, 1997 : ,     - It's the early 1980's and everyone is arriving at school
We push through the parking lot crowd to a nervous, lanky kid, '  (
) When  was sixteen years old  fell in love
- , a tough girl with stringy brown hair and a shiny forehead, as she turns toward the camera
Hey, Renise
She barely looks at him as he approaches, just drags on her smoke
Hey
So what's up
Eh
Great
Great
(beat) So listen, uh,  was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me
Renise looks unenthused
(cont'd) It's no big deal, whatever  mean, if you want
See, the thing is,  heard a rumor that this guy  like was gonna ask me
Uh-huh
Yeah, so
'm gonna wait and see what happens there
But that sounds great, yeah
Ted nods, confused
Okay
(beat) So is that a yes or a no
think  was very clear, Ted
If everything else falls apart, maybe
Renise throws down her butt and storms off
'm gonna hold you to that
: - a pretty girl, , climbing off a ten-speed in the school parking lot
She's athletic and tanned and doesn't have a bad bone in her body
'  (
) Her name was Mary
She'd moved to our little Rhode Island town from Minnesota two years earlier
She locks up the bike and starts walking toward the school
'  (
) Mary was very smart, and very cool, and she had a faceful of eyes that promised you a better life if you could only know her
As she approaches the camera, we  to see Ted watching her
He's sitting on a picnic table with two
#1 Hey, dirtbud, who you going to the prom with
Finally Ted takes his eyes off Mary
Ah,  don't know if 'm even gonna
You know, not my style
#2 You have a style
#1 Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey
(perks up) Who
Friend #1 makes a jerk-off motion
#1 Rosey Palm, your girlfriend
God knows you spend enough fucking time with her
The guys
(out of ammo but doesn't know it) Yeah, and who are you gonna take, your own palm
His friends stare at him
#1 Clever
like the way you just spun that around on me
Friend #2 notices Mary talking to her
#2 wonder who she's going with
#1 Some guy named Woogie
Who
#1 Big guy--goes to Barrington high school
This irks Ted
Woogie from Borrington high
Sounds like a loser
#1 Loser
Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class
#2 heard he got a scholarship to Princeton but he's going to Europe first to model
This takes the wind out of Ted's sails
#3 Yeah and he's got a huge cock
Everyone looks at him
#3 (cont'd) heard
Suddenly Friend #1  something
#1 Hey, check it out
-  large, goofy   with an unfashionable crewcut comes walking up the street
He's in his early twenties and though the weather is mild he's
He approaches a    sitting on a car hood
- You seen my baseball
#2 No
The kids watch as the Ear-Muff Guy approaches another group
- You seen my baseball
#1 (to his buddies) This guy must be in the 'tard squad
(to Ear-Muff Guy) Hey, buddy, come here,  think  know where your ball is
The Ear-Muff Guy heads back to the car
- You seen my baseball
#1 Yeah,  seen it
That girl over there, she has it
Car Hood Kid #1 points to a   leaning against another car talking to her large
#2 (cont'd) 'Cept she doesn't call it a baseball
She has another name for it
: - The Ear-Muff Guy marches up to her and her boyfriend
- You seen my pecker
What
- You seen my pecker
The Boyfriend grabs him by the collar
You son-of-a-bitch, 'll kick your ass
The Boyfriend throws the Ear-Muff Guy to the ground and is about to pummel him when Ted intervenes
Take it easy, Smokey
/ This fucking pervert just came on to Nance
All right, just be cool
(under breath) He looks like he's not all there, you know what  mean
crowd starts to gather which only incites Smokey more
/ Get the fuck out of my way, man
Smokey tosses Ted out of the way and moves toward the Ear-Muff Guy
Just then Mary shows up and steps between them
What's going on here
She bends down and helps the Ear-Muff Guy off the ground
(cont'd) Are you all right
- Mary, you seen my baseball
No,  haven't seen your baseball
Jeez, Warren, you know you're not supposed to leave the yard by yourself
/ (to Mary) You know him
He's my brother
/ Oh
(beat) didn't realize he was
you know
At this, Smokey and his girlfriend reluctantly head toward the school, along with most of the crowd
Mary turns her attention in the direction Ted was thrown
You okay
- Ted is sitting in a mud puddle
He stands and brushes himself off
Oh yeah
Fine
Thanks a lot, Ted
- Ted
He can't believe what he's just heard
As Mary helps him up, she turns her attention to Warren
'  (
) That she knew my name blew my mind
Some of my best friends didn't know my name
- Mary and a muddied Ted are walking Warren home
Warren lags behind, mumbling to himself
Mary notices that Ted is limping
Hey, you're limping
Did you just hurt yourself
No, it's an old football injury
Oh, are you on the team
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh,  fell off the school
Warren approaches and motions for Ted to hop on his back
Piggyback ride
Warren, come on, leave Ted alone
Warren pats his back again
Piggyback ride
(to Mary) don't mind
If you think he can hold me
Oh he can hold you
He weighs two-hundred-and-thirty pounds
real Clydesdale, huh Warren
Ted hops onto Warren's back
(cont'd) Giddy-up
Warren walks about five feet and stops
My turn now
Off Ted's reaction, we : '  - Muddy sweat is running down Ted's face as he struggles up a hill with Warren on his back
(straining) We're here, Warren
You wanna get off
Giddy-up
Ted rolls his eyes and continues toward the front door
Mary looks on, amused
So who you taking to the prom
Huh
The prom--you going
Oh,  don't know
think proms are pretty dumb
'Cause  thought maybe you and  could go if you weren't already taking someone
mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year
She smiles at this
'  (
) From that moment on the guys at school looked at me in a whole new light
: #1 #1 You're a fucking liar
- - Ted is leaning against his locker surrounded by a group of guys
#2 You expect us to believe you're going to the prom with Mary
What about Woogie
They broke up
She said he started getting weird on her
#1 got twenty bucks says you're full of shit
Oh come on, why would  lie
#1 Because you're a loser, and in some warped way this gives you a momentary sense of worth
#2 Put me down for fifty
#3 'm in
As the others join in, we : '  - tuxedoed and smiling Ted drives up in his parent's station wagon
'    - Ted knocks on the door and Mary's gruff  answers
' Yeah
What do you want
Um, hi, 'm Ted Peloquin
'm here to take Mary to the prom
' Prom
You're about twenty minutes late
She just left for the prom with her boyfriend Woogie
Ted looks devastated
Suddenly the door swings open revealing '
' Charlie, that's mean
Come on in, Ted
Don't listen to Mr
Wise Guy here
He's a joke a minute
Oh
(relieved) Oh, that's a good one
'  - Ted nervously enters and sees Warren watching
in the den
Hey, Warren
Warren doesn't look his way
Just then Mary comes down the stairs looking as if the directors had really taken their time casting this role
Ted can't believe his eyes
Hi, Ted
Hi, Mary
' Poor Teddy--he's been getting it both barrels from the Wisenheimer here
Dad, have you been busting Ted's chops
Mary's Dad shrugs
(cont'd) Warren, did you say hi to Ted
(not looking up) 'Bout ten times
Hey, Warren,  think  know where your baseball is
This finally gets Warren's attention
You seen my baseball
We see Ted discreetly pull a    out of his pocket and palm it in his hand
Well, if it's a big white one with red stitching,  think  saw it right behind your ear
Ted is reaching behind Warren's ear when suddenly Warren , knocking him to the ground
Warren
Ted    on the coffee table
- as it rolls under the couch, stopping right next to the
- In a split second, Warren is up like a cat and As     , Ted manages to free himself from the disabled man's clutches and ' (to Ted) What the hell are you doing
' Teddy, let him go
(out of breath) 'm trying
tell him to
calm down
The family jumps on Warren and finally break it up
'  (cont'd) (to Ted) Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you doing
was playing a trick
-- had a baseball
' What baseball
Where's a baseball
Ted looks around but there's no ball in sight
There was a ball  had a honest
As Mary helps Ted up, we see that his shirttail is out and his tie is hanging off
Mary's parents lead the frothing Warren back to the couch
(to Ted) 'm sorry
should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears
Oh
Okay
gotcha
Are you all right
Oh yeah
' (to Mary) Honey, now you're all wrinkled
Mary looks down and frowns
Ted, will you just give me one more minute
have to iron this thing
Ted starts to tuck his pants in as Mary and her mother head back up the stairs
Mary's Dad and Ted are left alone
And Warren
Ted rubs his head, sees a spot of blood
(to Mary's Dad) May  use your bathroom
- Ted dabs his head with a tissue, then moves to the toilet
As he he glances out the window to his left
' - two  are perched on a branch
Ted smiles
at the  of these beautiful tweeties singing their love song for themselves, for the spring, for Ted and Mary, and suddenly they fly away and we
to reveal Mary in the bedroom window , in just a bra and panties, and just then her mother glances Ted's way and  - with what she can only presume to be a leering Peeping Tom
he loses the smile and ducks his head back into the bathroom, , he hastily zips up his fly and : - concerned Mary, her Mom, Dad, and Warren are huddled outside the bathroom
(knocking gently) Ted, are you okay
(
) (pained) Just a minute
' He's been in there over half an hour
(whispering) Charlie,  think he's masturbating
Mom
' Well he was watching you undress with a silly grin on his face
(
) (pained) was watching the birds
They all look at one another
' Charlie, do something
' All right, kid, that's it, 'm coming in
- whimpering Ted huddles in the corner as Mary's Dad enters
'  (cont'd) What seems to be the situation here
You shit yourself or something
wish
Ted motions for him to close the door and Mary's Dad obliges
(cont'd) , uh
got it stuck
' You got what stuck
It
' It
(beat) Oh it All right, these things happen, let me have a look
It's not the end of the world
Mary's Dad moves closer and puts his reading glasses on
- As Mary, her Mom, and Warren listen in
'  (
) (
) Shhhhhh
- ' ( ) Shirley, get in here
You gotta see this
What
No please, sir-- ' She's a dental hygienist
She'll know what to do
Mary's Mom comes in and closes the door behind her
' Teddy, hon, are you okay
(moving closer, seeing the situation) Would you shhh
Mary's gonna hear us
' Just relax, dear
Now, um
what exactly are we looking at here
(dizzy) What do you mean
' (delicate) mean is it
is it
' (gruff) Is it the frank or the beans
think a little of both
Suddenly we hear Warren from outside the door: (
) Franks and beans
Ted hangs his head
- Mary and Warren are huddled outside the door
(to Warren) Shhhh
'  (
) What the hell's that bubble
Mary  to this
- One guess
' How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that
don't know
It's not like it was a well thought-out plan
' Oh my, there sure is a lot of skin coming through there
' 'm guessing that's what the soprano shriek was about, pumpkin
' 'm going to get some Bactine
No, please
Suddenly a   sticks his head in the bathroom window
Ho there
(humiliated) Oh God
Everything okay here
Neighbors said they heard a lady scream
' You're looking at him
'mere and take a look at this beauty
No, that's really unneces-- But the Officer's already climbing in the window
Once inside, he turns his flashlight on Ted and
Now 've seen it all
What the hell were you thinking
(frustrated) wasn't trying-- Is that bubble what  think it is
Mary's parents nod
(cont'd) But
how
how'd you get the zipper all the way to the top
' Let's just say the kid's limber
The Officer makes a face, then rolls up his sleeves
Well, there's only one thing to do
No, no, no, 'll be fine
'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning
Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second
The Officer reaches down and takes hold of the zipper
No, no, please
' Teddy, be brave
(
) Beans and franks
(
) Warren, shhh Defeated, Ted holds his breath and braces for the worst
It's just like pulling off a Band-aid
-one and a-two and
: We got a bleeder
'  - rush Ted out the front door on a stretcher
Mary runs alongside him holding a towel on his crotch
while a dabs at his crotch with a towel
Mary's Mom and Dad are out front along with two , four  , and a crowd of about thirty
(to Mary) Keep pressure on it
Mary does as she's told
(running along) Ted, 'm so sorry
Are you going to be okay
(irrational cockiness) You betcha
He gives her two thumbs up as they slide him into the ambulance
- The doors  shut and as the ambulance pulls away Ted starts to and we can see Mary fade into the night, as we : '  - Ted, now in his 30's, lays on his therapist's couch
Anyway, school ended a few days later and that July her father got transferred to Florida
The up to reveal that the
Ted has been telling all this to no one (cont'd) It took me half the summer to pay off all those bets
(sighs) never did see Mary again
That was about twelve years ago
Just then the door quietly opens and Ted's  tip-toes back into the room and takes his seat
(He has a dab of mustard on his chin and has forgotten about the cloth napkin tucked into his collar
) Uh-huh
Interesting
The Psychiatrist notices the napkin and quickly wipes his chin, then tosses it aside
Anyway, it's not something you exactly forget about, but  guess  must've blocked it out of my head
Then about a week ago 'm driving on the highway and  got to thinking about Mary and suddenly  couldn't breathe
couldn't keep up with the flow of traffic anymore  felt like  was going to die
pulled into a rest area, parked the car, and just started shaking
The Psychiatrist scratches his chin
You know
rest areas are homosexual hang-outs
Huh
Highway rest areas--they're the bathhouses of the nineties for some gay men
Ted thinks about this, then glances back at the shrink
What are you saying
(checking wristwatch) Oops, time's up
We'll have to delve into that next week
Off Ted's look, we : - Ted and his friend  are blasting a couple buckets
Gay
He said you were gay
He implied it
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay
Look at Truman Capote
Yeah, but he was successful
Let me ask you this: When you smoke a cigar, do you ever pretend it has balls
Ted appears to think about this
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay
'm going to fix you up with my new assistant
What's he like
Dom , then watches as Ted hits a ball
You're leaving it out
Finish your swing
(beat) You're going to like this one--she's half Asian, half American
Good-looking
just told you, she's half Asian
half American They're all good looking
You could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and they're going to have a gorgeous kid
It's a foolproof combo
Ted thinks about it
What's the point
Let's face it, Dom, 'm in a slump
() Lately 've been feeling like
well
like a loser
Loser
You
Ted shrugs
(cont'd) Give me a break
Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed
If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match
What are the odds of that, one in a million
Oh, so 'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion
never said that
'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys
(beat) Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you
Ted gives him a look
(cont'd) You know, you're a real glass-is-half-empty guy
You got a fucking guardian angel, man
Ted manages a small smile
Just then, Ted's cell phone
gotta take this, it might be my boss
(flips phone open) Ted here
(on phone) You're a cocksucking motherfucking piece of puke
Whoever it is
Without reacting, Ted closes the phone and puts it back in his pocket
Yep
'  - Dom and Ted are drinking beer while sitting on Dom's front steps
We see signs of kids everywhere: a tricycle, six-foot basketball hoop, dolls, etc
'  comes out and hands them each a cigar
' thought you guys might like these with your beers
Thanks, baby
She goes back inside
See, that's what  want
don't need these bimbettes you got me chasing
want what you have
family
Someone to
you know
love
These guys don't usually talk about this crap, and Ted gets a little embarrassed
(cont'd) It must be great with a wife like that
Each day is better than the next
(beat) Have you ever been, you know
in love with someone
Nah
Never
Well once
Mary
Dom
Mary again
Look,  admit it was brief, but it was definitely love
Crushes don't last twelve years
Whatever happened to Mary
told you, her family moved to Miami
mean since then
don't know
Well why don't you look her up
(sarcastic) Yeah, right
Why not
Because  guarantee she's married and has a couple kids
Girls like Mary don't stay single
What if you're wrong
You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her
did try calling her
(sheepish) few years ago
She wasn't listed
So that was it
One bump in the road and you gave up
also called Unsolved Mysteries You're kidding
What did they say
They told me they don't help out stalkers
(beat) Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time
got it--you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing
Ted considers this
No
No fucking way
That's too creepy
Dom thinks a moment, then  his fingers
Wait a second
There's a guy named Healy in my office who might be able to help you out
He's a claims investigator and he goes to Miami every couple weeks
As Ted thinks about this, we : of a big insurance company - -  - Ted and Dom are walking down a hallway
don't know about this, Dom
Relax, this guy owes me a big one
couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume--like we haven't all done that
Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk
His mother
Yeah,  guess he still lives with her
Seemed like a sweet lady--got diabetes or something--so  went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence
And you think he could find out her number for me
He'll do better than that
'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down
Ted thinks about this
(cont'd) Just let me warn you--This guy runs a little hot, but he gets the job done
: '  - Ted is seated inside a small cubicle across the desk from , a shaggy-looking guy in a mis-matched three-piece suit
Healy looks more like a used-car salesman than an insurance investigator
So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school
Uh-huh
Any idea where  might start looking
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago
checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed
She might've moved ten times since then
(skeptical) All you want is a phone number
Well,  know you're busy Don't play games with me, Ted
don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador
don't buy it
You don't buy what
Suddenly Healy is in his face
Ted, 'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip
Now  want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up
(indignant) No
She's blackmailing you, right
(more indignant) No
You want her dead, don't you
You can't be serious
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case
'm not a stalker
She's a friend of mine
Sure she is
That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years
Oh you're good, Ted
You're a real piece of work
(stands) Look, let's forget it
Let's forget the whole thing
get one hundred a day plus expenses
( at Healy's nerve) You get fifty a day, period
It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses
Healy thinks about it
Okay, Ted, 'll do it
But if this chick turns up with a toe tag, 'm rolling over on you
: - of Miami Beach - Healy waits alone on a corner carrying one bag and a Suddenly a '89 Chrysler Lebaron convertible with a in the back  to a halt in front of him
The driver, , is a muscular, well-groomed man in his thirties
Healy you dog
(checking out car) Fucking Sully
Look at you
(Boston accent) You hot shit
Ya look fuckin' pisser
- The dog is catching wind in the backseat and Sully hands Healy a packet
Here's the info you asked for
Thanks
You should thank me--that girl was not easy to find
What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend
Stalker, huh
Big time
'  - This place is modest and clean but it has a direct view of South Beach
Healy puts his bags down and looks around
Very nice
'm doing okay
(checks watch) gotta get ready for work
Sully ducks into the bedroom and Healy looks around the apartment
Okay
With this pad, the killer wheels
Looks like you really cleaned up your act
(
) What can  tell you
It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear
Those guys worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence
Fuckin' animals
Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks
(
) Not for me, buddy
don't drink anymore
Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right
Suddenly a huge Boa Constrictor slithers up on Healy's lap
(cont'd) What the
Sully comes back in the room wearing a police uniform
Take it easy, that's Bill
Tell Bill to get the fuck off
(smiling) Relax, he just ate
Healy just stares at his friend
(cont'd) (proudly) Nineteen months  been sober
What are you talking about
You were never an alky, you were a cokehead
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too
Is that right
Well good for you, Sull, 'm proud of you
Healy pops open one of his beers and hands it to Sully
(cont'd) Here, just have one of these then
Healy, what  just tell you
This is a light beer
You can't have a light beer
No  can't
Healy stares at him, baffled
Sully, it's one fuckin' beer for Christ sakes
(holds up beer) Ooh, the big bad beer's gonna get ya
Sully stares at the beer, weakening
(cont'd) 'm worried about you, man
You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon
You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy
Am
Bet your ass you are
Now  don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit
You gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me
you're gonna break
Finally, Sully takes the beer
He stares at it a moment and then sips
Jesus, you know what
This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy
What are you, spotting
Healy takes the beer from Sully and as he chugs it, we : - Healy is on a stakeout
He's dozing
He's been here for hours, food wrappers litter Sully's car
He's wearing Walkman-type which are connected to a attached to a pair of
Suddenly  explodes through his headphones--Healy's jolted awake
Who threw the grenade
Recovering, Healy aims the binoculars toward
' - ' Healy has a clear, unobstructed view into Mary's apartment
The music is coming from Mary's clock radio
sits up in bed and shakes herself awake, like someone's just poured cold water over her
She cranks the music even
Mary hops out of bed, wearing only her panties, and though she's a little older now, she still looks well cast
-   - he's become extremely interested in his work
As much as Healy's enjoying the show, he's got a job to do--he speaks into a - : (into recorder) Okay, Ted,  found your Mary
Her current address, two-niner-eight Euclid Avenue, Miami Beach
Husband, negative
Children and Labrador, negative
Extremely nice ass, affirmative
'
- Mary walks into the living room where we see an old woman, , sitting on the couch  to a stack of
Have you been up all night again
Bet your ass  have
It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is
Neighborhood Watch
Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius
Meaning
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps
For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife
(feigning shock) You picked that up on the scanner
We gotta move
confirmed it on the scanner
knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people
Magda pats her little dog  on the head
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there
Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing--he was a fucking asswipe--but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you
Okay, you win
Now try to get some sleep, huh
Mary gives Magda a kiss and heads to her bedroom
: - as Healy follows Mary around town
- Mary exits her apartment and bounces out into the world
There is a   sitting on the sidewalk
Mary flips him an apple, then jumps in her Honda Civic and drives off
- Mary is at the range  a couple buckets of balls
- watching from the parking lot
(into mic) Looks like we got an athlete on our hands
' -  - Mary waits in the drive-thru lane reading the
Finally the window opens and she is handed a
Healy watching from his car
(into mic) Well, from her figure and her appetite, 'm guessing she's either got a bowel disorder or we've got a hurler on our hands
- Mary's brother Warren is wearing a walkman as he plays catch out front with a    while several other -  entertain themselves
Mary pulls up, gets out, and starts handing out Egg McMuffins
Get in line
One at a time
fat patient, , approaches
Can  have two, Mary
Yeah, you can have two halves, just like everyone else
Thanks
Gary takes his and walks off
couple more patients and then bucktoothed  steps up to her
Will you marry me, Mary
Oh yeah, pretty boy
And what about Dolores
Mary points to another  staring bashfully at Freddie
Would you marry us both, Mary
Yeah, that'd be a good deal for you, wouldn't it
Freddie moves off and fat Gary is back, trying to be inconspicuous
(cont'd) Wow, this is weird
There was somebody who looked just like you here a minute ago
Mary smiles and hands Gary another McMuffin
Healy
(into mic) Ixnay on the big appetite
(beat) She's just got a big heart
- Neighborhood restaurant and bar
After-work crowd
Mary and her friends, , , and  are sitting at a table under an umbrella
Lisa reads from the   in South Beach Magazine Listen to this one--'Seeking sensitive Wasp doctor to share candlelit dinners, long walks in Coconut Grove, marriage
' What does this girl want, a corpse
You gotta be more specific: 'Seeking deaf mute with three pound cock and trust fund
' No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs
' Ugh, not pecs
Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock
the bar where we see Healy eavesdropping on their conversation
(
) (to Mary) suppose you wouldn't like someone with a washboard stomach like Brad Pitt
Mary and friends
'm just saying  don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly
It means he's a guy
You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections
(quietly into mic) girl after your own heart, Ted
Mary and friends
can live with those reflections
'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies
Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty-six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame
(sarcastic) Jeez,  don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that
But here's the rub
The guy 'm talking about has got to be self-employed
You mean, like an architect or something
Architect, yeah
You mean creative, but not poor
No, it's not the money
Creative, yeah, that's good, but it's the freedom 'm talking about
See, this guy has to have a job he could do anywhere
That way we could just up and leave at the drop of a hat
And where would you and your beer-bellied architect be leaving to
don't know
The Super Bowl, New Orleans Jazz Festival
maybe a couple months in Nepal
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu
What's that supposed to mean
It means you're too hard on guys
No 'm not
Oh come off it, Mare
What about what's-his-name
Steverino
You could've at least passed the baton on that one
The girls
Yeah, Steve
Steve was all right for awhile
All right for awhile
The guy's good-looking, rich, witty
He was a god
At one point you were talking about marrying him
Come on, why'd you dump him
Mary thinks about this
don't know, it was complicated
He's in San Francisco, 'm in Miami
(dodging question) Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him
Is that old crab still with you
Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month--it's been a year and a half
Ah, she's okay
Mary, cut the crap, what really happened with Steve
Nothing
mean, you know my brother
(sighs) Warren
What
Steve seemed to put up with Warren
don't want someone who'll put up with him
want someone who will enjoy him, the way  do
Do you know what he told my friend Tucker
He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life
(beat) Well he is in my life and 'm goddamn lucky to have him
The hell with Steve
Everyone is touched by this
Then: Well, that's the last time  blow him behind your back
As the girls , we : '  - Healy sits out front in his car again waiting for Mary to get home
He picks up the phone, dials a number, and someone answers but doesn't speak
Hello
Sully
(beat) Sully, that you
(
) (over phone) Who the fuck is it to you
Sully, it's Healy
What's going on over there
'  - Sully is sitting on the kitchen floor in his police uniform, a ring of white around his nostrils
The room is littered with beer cans, he has another one in his hand, there's a pile of cocaine and a rolled-up bill on the breakfast table
The dog and the snake are in the doorway looking at him with concern
(into phone, sloshed) Fuckin' Patrick Healy, you think your shit don't stink
Well  got news for you--you're goddamn right it don't
How the hell are ya
'  - Healy looks at the phone, concerned
Uh, 'm fine
Just wanted to let you know 'll have your car back in a couple hours, 'm still staking out this girl's apartment
(
) You found my car
Just then Healy notices Mary pull up and park
He slides down in his seat
- she gets out carrying a bag and approaches the Homeless Man, who is still sitting on the sidewalk
She hands him the bag
Thanks, Mary
You watch out for yourself, Herb
As Mary bounds up the steps of her building, we the Homeless Man as he happily takes a sandwich and soda out of the bag
'  - As Mary rushes into the apartment, Magda is glued to her radio scanner, listening intently
Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this--some cop's staking out this broad's apartment
No time, Magda, my show's starting
he can hear the conversation through the pointed at Mary's place
(
) This is a good one, Mare
Sounds like his partner's all lubed up
(quietly into phone) Call you back
(over phone) God,  miss ya, ya fuck- Healy hangs up abruptly
'  - Ah, Christ,  lost 'em
Mary runs into her bedroom, shuts the door and flips on the tube just as Sportscenter's is playing
Relieved, Mary lays back on her bed and starts watching
: '  - Mary is now watching Andy Griffith while    and away in bed
- he's sitting in his car, , too
Fucking Barney
he never learns
'  - As the show's end credits start to  , Mary stands and starts to  for bed
- he sits up, very interested now
(into mic) Here we go, Teddo
Here comes the money shot
Healy quickly reaches in the back seat and pulls out a bigger, ' - we're   the wrinkliest, saggiest, droopiest set of milkbags on the planet
- he cringes
(cont'd) Oooof
First chink in the armor, Teddy Boy
'   - He moves his view up from the tits to reveal
for bed
- He flinches, sickened by his mistake, then repositions the binoculars dead left to the next window
' - moving over to the next window we see
Mary as she just finishes putting on some sexy t-shirt
- as he starts to drool
(cont'd) Oh sweet Jesus : -    - Ted is sitting alone having a beer when a smiling Healy approaches
've got some very, very good news for you, my friend
Really
(perking up) Very, very Healy sits down and motions for a beer
think your life's about to change
So you found Mary
Right there in Liberty City
And you were right, she's really something
(smiles) So she hasn't changed
That  couldn't
say
Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school
No, not at all
Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years
This doesn't dampen Ted's enthusiasm
Mary's a little chubby, huh
'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half
Not bad
Ted's smile starts to fade
(cont'd) But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds
So she's married
Nope
Never been
Huh
Four kids, three different guys
Three different guys
Well 'm guessing
There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget
Oh my
Hyperactive little fuckers, too
Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair,  bet
She's in a wheelchair
Ted looks completely drained
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time
bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you
(shrugs) It's just that
Mary
wouldn't have thought
Anyway, the good news is  have all the information you need
Got it from her bookie--nice guy
You should definitely call her, Ted
mean she's a real sparkplug, that one
She seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help 'll bet she does it
Ted stands and starts moping away
Thanks, Healy
Good work
Ted
Don't you want the name of the housing project
Uh, that's okay
You sure, big guy
'll bet she'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy
As Ted leaves, Healy puts his feet up on the table and sits back
'  - We  across the room of unopened boxes to Ted laying awake in bed
We hear -  coming from the apartment next door
Finally Ted gets up and walks over to his dresser
As he flips on a small light we see loose change, a balled-up Kleenex, a few golf tees, and Ted's wallet
Ted picks up the wallet and opens it
' - Inside is an an old high school photo of a smiling Mary
As Ted looks at it, he can't help but smile, too
- ' - Healy's taking his last boxload of crap out of his cubicle when he spots Ted
He tries to duck back in but Ted sees him
Healy forces a smile as Ted approaches
What are you doing
Oh, uh,  resigned
Ted picks up a plane ticket off the desk
Miami
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me
'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai
Jai alai
Yeah,  don't know why but  always felt at home in the fronton
Healy starts walking out of the office and Ted follows
Healy is having a hard time looking him in the eye
So he doesn't
Look, uh, 've been thinking about everything you told me
Good good
Well  think you're right,  should look her up
Rollerpig
Are you nuts
But you said she was a sparkplug
said buttplug
She's heinous
Ted  and follows Healy out the front door
- They walk across the lot toward Healy's car
All the same,  still want to call her know it sounds crazy--Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life--but,  don't know, maybe  can help her out
(sighs) The poor thing's had it tough--she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes
It's a goddamn bunion
It'll heal
Oh
thought (beat) That's not it anyway
know this doesn't make any sense to you, but  just can't turn it off that fast
still feel something for her
Healy comes to his car and puts his stuff in the trunk
Okay, tell you what: 'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan
Japan
What's she doing in Japan
You've heard of mail-order brides
Well they go that way, too
Ted is devastated
Mary's a mail-order bride
Fetched a pretty penny, too
Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there
Sort of like tuna
Off Ted's look, we : - Ted and Dom are having a beer and a dog
That's it, 'm making an oath
'll never procrastinate about anything again
Life is too fucking short
Hey, look on the bright side-- (interrupting) What's that, Dom
What's the bright side
Well
at least now you know
think it was better when  didn't
It was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world
As Ted dwells on this, Dom bursts out
What's so funny
'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal
Don't you see
You're liberated feel liberated
mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you
Ted flinches at this
Wait a second,  never told you that
Christ, Ted,  was only four towns away
Ted thinks it over
Maybe you're right
should look on the bright side
mean, 've still got my health
(checks watch) 'm out of here
've got to get up at six a
m
to move my boss's brother into his apartment
What On your day off
Do you even know the guy
Never met him
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine
Amen to that
: -   - Healy pays for a bucket of balls, then takes his clubs and strolls jauntily to
' Healy places a ball on the tee and takes a swing
He tops the ball and it dribbles about ten yards
Hit a house
Bite bite
(to Mary) Haven't swung the wrenches in a while
Mary nods
Healy takes another swing and duck-hooks one about fifty yards
Mary addresses her ball, takes a smooth backswing, and (cont'd) Hey, can you give me some tips here
She cracks her shot long and straight
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing
Thanks
Mary tees up another ball and Healy puts down his club
(cont'd) 'm gonna get a soda, you want one
(annoyed) No thanks
Healy pulls out a huge wad of change from his pocket
Oh cripes
Do you have change for a dollar
All  have is these stupid Nepalese coins
(interested) Nepal
Have you been
Not in months
don't even know why bought the damn place
You own a home there
Well
it's just a condo really
Right outside Katmandu
Wow
That's a place 've always wanted to go
Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops
Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit
That's been my experience anyway
She looks impressed
Healy looks at his watch
(cont'd) You know,  should just get going
'll work on my game next week
He flips her a coin
(cont'd) Here
Spend it on your trip to Katmandu
(smiles) Thanks
Healy starts to walk off
Mary doesn't know what to do
Will she ever see this guy again
(cont'd) ( after him) It was nice meeting you
Healy doesn't answer or turn around
He just raises his hand and gives her a little wave
Mary shrugs her shoulders
Oh well
- Healy is sitting in Sully's Chrysler LeBaron, right next to Mary's Honda Civic
He watches the rear-view mirror, and the moment he sees Mary coming out from the driving range, he swings his legs out the door and starts changing out of his golf shoes
As Mary tosses her golf bag into the trunk, she notices Healy tying his shoes second chance
Well, it was nice meeting you, again
Same here again
By the way, what's your name
Pat Healy
There's an uncomfortable pause
Why doesn't this guy ask the usual questions
Don't you want to know my name
already know it, Mary
(surprised) How'd you know that
It's right there on your golf bag
Healy opens the back door to put away his golf shoes
Suddenly, rolls and rolls of paper come tumbling out
Mary bends over to help Healy pick them up
What are you doing with all these blueprints
Some buildings 'm working on
Are you
an architect
Well, just until  get my  Tour card
Mary stares at him, mouth agape
(cont'd) 'm kidding
Yeah,  guess you could call me an architect--it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving
My real passion is my hobby
What's that
work with retards
(taken aback) beg your pardon
You know
(flaps lips with fingers) the guys who ride the short bus
(put off) Isn't that a little politically incorrect
The hell with that
No one's gonna tell me who  can and can't work with
No,  mean --There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid
He got out of his cage once and-- --He's in a cage
Well it's more of an enclosure really
They keep him confined
That's bullshit
That's what  said, so  went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard
He's got plenty of room out there to dig
The kid's really blossomed
Now  can take him to ball games, movies--you know, happy stuff
That sounds like fun
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me
(getting emotional) Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing  have in this crazy old world
(checks watch) Ooh, hey,  gotta run
(won back over) Look, uh,  was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime
Healy smiles at this and we : - 7:45
profusely sweating Ted has a     and  his way toward the front door as his '   catches up to him
(The man is a quadriplegic who needs to use a  to operate his chair
) ' Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh
(straining) What
' You heard me
You already put a fucking nick in my piano
(biting tongue) 'll try to be more careful
' 'matter with you
You look like you're fading
The thing's kind of heavy
' Heavy
Heavy
What  wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick
No,  just meant
' Yeah yeah
'm going to the corner to get a cup of coffee
The Boss's Disabled Brother bites into the mouthpiece and up the sidewalk
Ted takes a step
Rests
step
Rests
' Hey you
Ted glances back toward the street to see a from the  7 - rushing toward him with a   on her heels
(cont'd) Do you know that you're parked in a handicapped spot
: '  - Ted is splayed out on a table in obvious pain while
, an old high school pal, palpates his spine
(smirking) So
see you made the news
(angry and embarrassed) It wasn't my truck-- was helping out a guy in a wheelchair
(dubious) Uh-huh
Where was he
Out getting coffee
Yeah, that's more or less what the others said, too
Out getting coffee
supposed to meet him here
picking up my grandma
Ted turns and  at him
(cont'd) 'm just saying
They sure made you look dumb
Ted
couple big  of the neck
Bob, do you remember Mary
Who
Mary
From high school Mary
Yeah,  saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas
Ted sits up
convention
How'd you see her at a convention
'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon
The Doc , still able to recall the feeling
(cont'd) What a babe
Ted sits up on his elbows
Babe
: - buckled-over Ted limps into Dom's office with a crazed look on his face
Mary's a babe
What
My Mary--she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats
She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe
Huh
But why did Healy
Well think about it
Ted folds his arms
No You mean
Uh-huh
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up
(nodding) That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai
Dom shakes his head
Then: Well then you've got to call her, man
Fuck calling her
'm going down there
'  - While Mary gets ready for her date, Magda sits in front of the radio scanner in her bathrobe with her little dog Puffy on her lap
So who's the lucky guy
Name's Patrick,  met him at the driving range
Good lookin'
He's no Steve Young
'  -  69 Healy, listening through his headphones, reacts to this
(
) What's he like
(
) don't know
He's kind of a mook
(
) What's a mook
(
) You know, a mookalone, a schlep
'  - Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep
Come on, Magda () It's like that movie Harold and Maude don't watch the new ones
This one's almost thirty years old
It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love
That's exactly why  don't watch 'em anymore--it's bullshit
Why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid
Mary smiles at this
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone , having things in common kindred spirits
Fuck kindred spirits
My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat
If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed
well, you got yourself a keeper
'  - As Healy thinks about this, we : '   - Healy enters the building
'   -  - Healy tiptoes up to Mary's apartment door
He peeks through the mail slot
' - Puffy is staring at him and
Healy reaches in his pocket, pulls out a  and a
Healy shoves the pill into the treat's soft center, examines it, then thinks what the hell and
Puffy
Healy pops the treat through the mail slot and listens as the dog
Healy looks at his watch, then sneaks back outside to wait a few minutes for the drugs to kick in
: '   - Healy is sitting on Mary's couch with Puffy spread-eagled upside-down on his lap,
Mary and Magda look on in amazement
(baby talk) Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum-tum rubbed, doesn't he now
Wow, 've never seen him like this
He doesn't usually like guys
You mean he doesn't like bad guys 'That right
He can tell you're an animal nut
You are, aren't ya
Truth is  usually get along better with animals than with people
In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan-tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals
(babbling) who love him a lot, too
and so on
' Magda stares dreamily at Healy, smitten
Would you like a glass of tea or something
You got a brew
Sure
(noticing Magda's trance) Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers
Oh, yeah, of course, dear
The two women go into the kitchen and Healy is left to pet the Suddenly Healy notices that the dog is Healy checks Puffy's pulse
He looks at his watch to time the rate
(
) ( out) Sorry, Pat, out of beer
You like vodka
( out) Great
He starts   , but Puffy doesn't move
Healy goes into action
He starts pressing on his heart,
One-and-two-and-three, he continues trying to revive him
(
) ( out) Would you like a little clam-dip, honey
( out) No, thanks
(panicking) Love a little bundt cake if you have some
'  - Magda and Mary are on their way out the door when they stop
Bundt cake
(shrugs) Must have a sweet tooth
See if you can find some cookies
As Magda starts to go through the cupboards
'   - panicked Healy is giving the little mutt -- now
Then back to the heart, the mouth, the heart, the mouth
(quietly, desperately, to Puffy) Come on, man, stay away from the light
Healy resumes blowing into the dog's snout, pumping his chest, with no results
Desperate, he picks up the cheese knife and quickly
Healy grabs the two wires and on the little pooch's chest
- the dog  a couple feet off the couch as Healy takes his pulse again
Nothing
He  him once more with the
- Still nothing
Healy gets to his feet and peeks into the kitchen
When he turns his back, we see When Healy turns back, he's horrified at what he sees
He grabs a vase of flowers and
With this, Puffy flinches and comes to,
All  had was some Funny Bones--how does that sound, honey
Healy picks up the stunned pooch and swaddles it in a blanket as Magda  the room followed by Mary
(petting dog) Fine
Fine
Here you go
(sniffs) What's that smell
Mary hands Healy his vodka and as he downs it, we : - Healy looks slightly disoriented as Mary leads the way into the courtyard area by the main building
The museum
thought we were going out to dinner
We will, but first  have a surprise
surprise
The architecture exhibit
My friend Tucker is going to be here
He's an architect, too
You guys will have tons to talk about
' as he starts to panic
Mary and Healy walk through the exhibit area
Mary scans the room for her friend
Healy's face is ashen
know he's around here someplace
(chipper) What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket
We just got here thirty seconds ago
Isn't this stuff great
Mary points to an architectural model
(cont'd) Is this one art deco or art nouveau
Deco
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule
That
Vestibule
How about--
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces--look at the building in its totalitarianism
Mary gives him a look
Suddenly, Healy draws a couple of invisible sixshooters at her
(cont'd) Stone crab time
Come on, let's get outta here, goofy
He turns to go but Mary notices something
Tucker
Mary leads Healy over to her friend , a distinguished-looking man in his fifties
Healy looks like a dog that's being dragged to the vet
Mary and Tucker embrace
(still hugging) Come on, like you mean it
Mary  and hugs Tucker tighter
Then: Tucker, this is my friend Pat Healy
Healy and Tucker shake hands
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick
Same here
Pat's an architect, too
Hey, no kidding
Where are your offices
(keeping cool) Mainly  work out of Boston
Boston, huh
Did you get your degree up there
Yes yes,  did get my degree up there
Harvard
You bet
(pleased) Did you study under Kim Greene
Among others
Kim and  are close friends
Well, 'll tell her  ran into you
You mean him
Well
that's debatable
Healy makes a hand-gesture to imply that Kim's sexuality is in doubt
Really But he's been married for twenty years--they've got six kids
Nice smokescreen, isn't it
Tucker can hardly believe his ears
Pat does projects all over the world
(impressed) Where would  have seen your work
Have you been to (thinking hard) Let's see--Santiago, Chile
Absolutely
was there twice last year
Which building is yours
Do you know the
soccer stadium
Did you build the Estadio Olympico
No
just down the street, the Amigo Tower
'm sorry, 'm not familiar with it
What style
Uh, sort of nouveau deco
with a big vestibule
Check it out next time you're up there
Tucker starts to look a little suspicious
You know,  really should take your card
(noticing something) Oh look, it's Doob
Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker
Healy drags Mary across the room toward a  who's looking at an exhibit
(to Man) Dooby, you old sheep-fucker
How the hell are ya
My name's Mel
Oh, sorry
Anyone ever tell you you look just like Jim Dubois
The sheepfucker
Healy shrugs and the man walks away angrily
: - two-door Toyota Tercel flies by the camera
determined Ted is cruising along the highway in his rent-a-car
He has a cup of coffee in his hand and a  in the seat beside him
The Hitchhiker sits with a between his legs
Thanks for picking me up
No prob,  could use the company
've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight
know how you feel-- been standing in the same spot for the last five hours
You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state
That must make it tough
Sucks
So what's up
You some kind of salesman or something
Nah
'm
'm nothing
Oh
Well  am
Hm
salesman--that's what  am
mean, 'm gonna be anyway
'm starting my own company--video sales--just as soon as  get enough seed money
'That right
Good for you
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea--it's a home run
You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs The exercise tape
Sure, 've seen it on Two million copies it sold last year
Two million, man But not next year--my idea's gonna blow them outta the water
Get this: (dramatic pause) Seven-Minute Abs see where you're going
(big smile) Think about it
You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven-Minute Abs --which one you gonna spring for
'd go with the seven
Bingo
Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work-out
How do you guarantee that
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute
' Huh
That sounds great
(beat) Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs
Ted , but the Hitchhiker just  at him, unamused
(cont'd) (unaware) 'm gonna pull over
gotta take a leak
- The Toyota Tercel pulls in and parks
Ted gets out and walks into the bushes to whiz
- as he steps into the dark brush  his fly he over something and
What the--
Suddenly , , --several huge illuminate the area revealing scurrying to pull their pants up all around him
(
) a startled Ted    directly in front of , making it appear that he's been
reveals a    holding the spotlights and moving in for the arrests followed by a (deer caught in headlights) Wait a second, it's not what you think
with his pants at his ankles jumps on the bandwagon
That's right
-- was just pissing
Ted glares at him
No
was pissing
Yeah, 'll bet you all were
Come on, in the truck
As they grab Ted and the others and hustle them away, we the Hitchhiker sitting in the Toyota watching the raid unfold
The Hitchhiker is clearly  at the sight of all the cops
Quietly he    , ducks down, and then , : as the bust continues
Each of the men    as they pass by the camera, who is extremely visible
(to Cop) Okay, take it easy, you don't have to push
a shocked Dom and his wife watching this on their television
Oh my God
Is that
' (matter-of-fact) Told you he was gay
- The  struggle to get the feisty Ted into a police van
was taking a leak
(
) We'll be right back with more of our special edition of - : - Healy and Mary are walking home at the end of their date
Healy is eating a big, wild cone of   and drinking a beer
That grandmother of yours--she's really something
Magda
She's not my grandmother--actually she rents the apartment right next to mine
Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone
And it doesn't cramp your style
Sadly, no
Well except for the lint
Lint
Yeah,  think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day--just makes for a lot of lint
Look at this
Mary lifts her shirt, revealing a -
(cont'd) See
That's just one day
Healy   and then gazes at her
What a babe
You know, sometimes  wish  could be like Magda and not go home
'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling
Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to
It's clear Healy forgot about that one
Ah, 'd sell that
Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies
You're a movie buff
Try to be
It's tough going with the crap they make today
If Dumb and Dumber 's the best they've got to offer  say thanks but no thanks
Have you seen it
No
But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it
fucking moron
Huh
guess  just wish they made them like they used to
You know, something like The Heartbreak Kid or Harold and Maude Mary can't believe her ears
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie
Ouch
Come on, don't bust my chops
know it's corny, but  do love it
Pat, 'm not kidding
really think it's the greatest-- --Love story of our time
Mary smiles
Is this guy for real
Yeah
Wow
thought  was the only one
They come to her apartment building and stop
It gets a little awkward
So
Yeah
guess this is it, huh
guess
Well, 'll see ya
Healy turns to go but stops
(cont'd) Mary ah, forget it
What
No, forget it, it was stupid
Come on, what were you going to say
Nah, really, it was moronic
She grabs him by the shirt playfully
Just say it
Healy takes a deep breath
Could  feel your bosoms before  go
Mary just stares at him
(beat) Knock yourself out
Healy reaches out and cups her breasts
He doesn't kiss her, she doesn't kiss him, he just fondles her breasts
Then: Okey-dokey, so tomorrow night
She smiles and as Healy walks away we : - Ted is sitting alone at a table in a small interrogation room
to reveal that he is being observed through a two-way mirror by two detectives,  and
Man, they never look like you'd expect
That's probably how he got the victim to drop his guard
Where'd they find the body
In a big red bag on the front passenger seat
All hacked up--fucking gruesome--a real psycho, this one
The Detectives  the room
- Ted stands as the Detectives take a seat across from him
(agitated) 'm telling you,  did not solicit sex was just stopping to go the bathroom, next thing  know  tripped over something--well someone--and, , there's cops and lights and-- Okay, calm down, Ted, we believe you
(beat) The problem is we found your friend in the car
As Ted sits back down the Detectives just stare at him
Finally Ted thinks he gets it
Oh
The hitchhiker
() That's what this is all about
Ted puts his head in his hands and smiles
(cont'd) Isn't that just my luck-- get caught for everything
So you admit it
Guilty as charged
'm not gonna play games with you
could give you a song and dance but what's the point
did it and we all know it
(laughs) The hitcher himself told me it's illegal The irony
The Detectives are surprised by his forthrightness
Well, uh, can you tell us his name
Jeez,  didn't catch it
The Detectives flinch at his glib demeanor
So he was a stranger
It was totally random
(confused) He was the first hitcher  saw, what can tell you
Now cut to the chase, how much trouble am  in
The Detectives look at one another
First tell us why you did it
Why  did it
(scoffs) don't know
Boredom
thought  was doing the guy a favor
The Detectives look at each other
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted
How many we talking
Hitchhikers
don't know--fifty
a hundred maybe--Who keeps track
Finally Detective Cavallo  across the table and starts on a shocked Ted
You sonofabitch
You're gonna fry
: '  - Mary pulls up in her Honda Civic
She parks out front and enters the building
- Healy is parked in his car
His surveillance equipment is pointed toward Mary's office
'  - Mary walks into the office and sees a   standing near the coffee maker
Mornin', Jane
#1 Good morning, Doctor
Your friend Tucker's in your office to see you
Mary nods and heads toward her office
'  - Mary walks into her office and sees Tucker seated at her desk
(  behind Tucker so we only see the back of his head
) What's up, Doc
Tucker, you look different some how
Did you do something with your hair
' - Tucker's got two   under his upper lip making him look like a walrus
The teeth, the teeth
got 'em capped
- smiles
Oh yeah, they look great
'  - He's got his listening gun fixed on Mary's office
(
) You don't think they're too big
(
) No no, the bigger the better
(beat) But  must say, they could be a little brighter
Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites
Healy looks at his teeth in the mirror
Not exactly pearly
'  - Tucker pulls the tongue depressors out of his teeth and laughs
He stands up, and when Mary tries to squeeze past him he gives her a kiss on the cheek
You ever been laid in this office
Mary pushes past him
Behave yourself, Tucker
(smiles) Come on, what are you doing here
She sits in her chair and leans against her desk
wanted to talk to you about your friend Patrick
'  - Healy almost flies out of his seat
(
) He's a nice guy, isn't he
(
) Well that's what 'm trying to figure out
How long have you known him
'  - Tucker has a look of concern
Not long at all, but  really like him
(off Tucker's look) Okay,  know he's a little different, Tucker, but that's what  like about him
He's a guy
real guy
He dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts, too
And that's okay with me
That's what you've been looking for--a farter
've been looking for a guy --not one of these South Beach pussies
() Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night
He gave me this funny vibe
Anyway,  called some friends back east
They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus
'  - Healy  his hand on the steering wheel
Fuck
(
) Huh
that's strange
'  - thought so
Anyway,  hope you don't think 'm being meddlesome
just think you should be careful with this guy
(concerned) No no no, Tucker, thank you
mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people--'m just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there
(small smile) appreciate you looking out for me
: - - Detective Franek as he , sheepishly
His remorseful- looking partner Cavallo stands behind him
On behalf of the entire South Carolina law enforcement community,  would like to offer our heartfelt apologies for any pain or temporary inconvenience we may have caused you, Mr
Peloquin
- reveals that Ted is lying on his prison bed being spooned by a 300-pound
The two Detectives and an apoplectic Ted walk down the hallway
At exactly 10:48 this morning a man was apprehended not far from where you were arrested
He was identified as an escaped mental patient and subsequently confessed to the murder that you were being held for
Lab tests confirmed a fingerprint match on the bag
(fragile) So
'm free to go
Detective Cavallo stops and holds out his hand
No harm, no foul
(stunned) guess
Still traumatized, Ted shakes the man's hand, then mopes toward the door
By the way, there's somebody here to see you
: '  - Dom is driving; a bruised and somber Ted is in the passenger seat
You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that
am
Didn't they tell you
That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak
You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man
Yeah feels like it
Ted grimaces and shifts in his seat
(cont'd) How the hell did you get here anyway
Flew
(beat) Told my wife  was going to a Promise Keepers convention
Ted gives him a look
(cont'd) hate to ruin your day, Ted, but  have some bad news for you
Ted
(resigned) Shoot
Remember our friend Healy
Well,  didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so sent my assistant by his mother's apartment
Turns out there is no diabetic mom
Landlord said she's been dead for ten years
And this adversely affects me how
Don't you see
--Healy lied to us about everything The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary
Ted is stunned
Huh
What
No
My Mary Mary wouldn't go for him
would she
Dom hands Ted a
His address in Miami
You know, when you think about it, we really don't know the first thing about this guy
Finally the implications of this dawn on Ted
Jesus Christ what have  done
: '  - confused Mary and her girlfriends are in the apartment while Magda listens to the radio scanner in the b
g
You're not seriously thinking about going out with this guy again
Mary, he sounds like a psycho
Would you hens quit ya cackling and let her do what she wants to do
Puffy liked him and Puffy's never wrong
The girlfriends roll their eyes
Mary, the guy's full of shit
What if he's not
What if Tucker just made an honest mistake
What if he didn't
It's clear that Mary is torn
don't know how  can bail now, he's going to be here any minute
Well then blow him off when he gets here
But you didn't meet him
He seems so don't know
perfect
kind of
He has a big cock, doesn't he
Mary shoots Brenda a look
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was
Healy
Magda's eyes almost come out of her head
think you better listen to this
Magda turns up the volume on her scanner and we can clearly hear Healy
Mary and her girlfriends gather around
(
) So where the hell are you, Healy
(
) Ah,  got a date tonight with that Mary girl  told you about
(
) The sawbones
(
) Yep
The girls all look at one another
We hit the motherlode
We shouldn't be listening to this
Shhh
(
) She still think you're a fucking architect
(
) Oh yeah
(
) Dumbshit
Mr
Perfect, huh
Mary starts to feel like a fool
(edgy) Turn it up, Magda
(
) Hey, watch your mouth--she's a great gal
'm the dumbshit for lying to her
(
) Why didn't you just tell her the truth
(
) don't know
guess
it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages
The girls all seem moved by this
'  - Healy is parked out front, the phone in one hand, a  in the other, as he listens to Sully read the following words: (
) But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did
(dismissing this) Ahh
'  - disheveled and wired-looking Sully is sitting on the couch in his underwear
There's  on the table,   on the floor, and  everywhere
In the
we see the Great Dane  at his empty bowl and the Boa Constrictor sprawled out on the floor, barely moving
(reading) Come on, you could tell her about the irrigation ditches you dug in Sudan, the orphan babies who cried in your arms in Romania
(does a line of blow) the hope you gave Freddie the leper in Calcutta
Suddenly the dog snatches the page out of his hand and Mary and friends
(welling up) love this man
Magda folds her arms and gloats
'  - Look,  did all those things for myself
'll be honest with you, 'm a selfish prick
get a high from helping all of God's creatures
An honest to goodness high
Just then, Healy sees a bug on the car window and instinctively squashes it
- he has the phone wedged between his cheek and shoulder as he  with the dog to get the script
Sully still can't retrieve the script, nor his next line
(winging it) That's bullshit, man you, uh, you were on the front line
Remember the, uh, malaria the, uh, typhoon fever that vicious strain of genital herpes
- they flinch at this
- he stares at the phone, horrified
(
) Uh, sure
cured a lot of nasty illnesses in third-world countries
- as they let out a sigh
(
) (cont'd) The bottom line is, 'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency
especially after what  did
() lied to this poor girl
Lied
man
She deserved better
(
) Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things
(
) You said it, mister
(choking up) gotta go
- as he   the phone and does another line, we the Great Dane Hal as he looks around for something, anything to eat
He  at a sock, then a beer bottle, before finally setting his sights on the Boa Constrictor Bill
Bill glances the dog's way nervously,  , and wiggles his way into another room
As Hal   after the snake, we : '  - Healy starts to knock on Mary's door, but, before he can, the door suddenly swings open revealing a beaming Mary
(startled) Oh Mary
Look, there's something  have to tell you
'm not Before he can finish, Mary steps forward and their mouths meet in a passionate
: --As Mary watches, Healy plays   with Warren and a few of his friends
Healy catches a pass then, trying a little too hard to impress Mary, he delivers a forearm shiver to his defender and gives Warren a vicious -
When Healy gets into the end zone he spikes the ball and starts talking trash to another defender
--Healy shows up at Mary's door sporting a set of -
He gives her a big horse smile and she reacts uncertainly
--Healy is in Mary's apartment as Mary finishes dressing for a night on the town
All set
You look great
(beat) Hey, Mare, do  have a rip in the back of these pants
When she puts her head close to inspect his pants, he lets fly a She pulls her head away, repulsed, but Healy just --Mary and and the horse-toothed Healy are having dinner in a romantic restaurant
As he eats he tells an animated story but he's having trouble with the new choppers and chunks of food are spraying out of his mouth with every word
Mary has to to avoid being covered with debris
--Healy and Warren are playing monopoly
When Warren isn't looking, Healy cheats and puts a couple hotels on Boardwalk
In the b
g
we see one of Warren's buddies fall out of a palm tree
: '  - lovesick Healy is mauling Mary out on the sidewalk in front while Warren stands off to the side
reveals a devastated Ted and Dom watching this from Ted's car
Fuck me
(sighs) Let's go home
No
You've gone through way too much to back down now
Get over there and do something-- can't stand watching this
as Healy starts -  and Mary has to break it off
Whoa, whoa, how's my stomach taste
Healy
How's my stomach taste, she says
(shakes head) Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare
Sorry  forgot my wallet
feel like a dog
Forget it
It was
fun
Ted recognizes Warren
Holy shit, there's Warren
, Suddenly we see Warren   at something
Franks and beans
Jesus,  think her brother spotted me
They both duck down in their seats
Beans and franks
Give it a rest, War
You just ate
Aw, leave him alone, he's just got a big appetite
(to Warren) Am  right
Healy winks at Mary
Huh
Healy reaches over and lifts a headphone off Warren's ear
said you've got a big app-- Suddenly Warren -
(cont'd) Urrggghh
Warren
- as they flinch
Attaboy
et al - Healy holds his throat, clearly in pain
Are you okay
(cont'd) (raspy, to Mary) Not to worry
So
see you tonight, right
Right
(cornered) Sure
Mary watches with a look of concern as Healy gets in his car and drives off
Ted stares gazily
Well
What are you waiting for
don't know what to say
Tell her the truth about Healy
Blow the schmuck out of the water
Are you crazy
've unleashed a psycho on her
She's gonna be fucking pissed
(stares at Mary) She's even more beautiful than  remember
- Mary and Warren start to go in the apartment
Get over there, you pussy
She's leaving
Suddenly Dom   , then ducks down
Mary turns around and sees Ted
You asshole, what are you-- (  ) Mary
Is that you
(squinting) Who's that
Ted gets out of the car and hustles across the street toward Mary
It is you
It's me
Ted
From Rhode Island Ted
Finally she recognizes him
Oh my God
Ted
(big smile) What are you
can't believe this haven't seen you since-- Yup, that's right
Junior prom
kinda
And did everything--
Oh yeah, healed right up
No visible scars
Mary
(cont'd) How are you doing, Warren
Good, Ted
Piggy back ride
'm gonna take a rain check
Mary is stunned
can't believe he remembered you
He never remembers anybody
(beat) You know  tried to call you for weeks after that
Really
never got a message
That's weird
talked to your brother Jimmy five or six times
Ted is devastated to hear this
(cont'd) By the way, how's he doing
He's dead
(taken aback) Oh, Ted 'm so sorry to hear that
(bitter) No, it was a good thing
(off her look) mean, good in that it was very quick
Ted pantomimes an explosion
Oh
So
what brings you down here
Funny story
You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to
ah
you know
just drive down
She stares at him
Well you look great
Are you married, do you have kids
Nope, nope--dodged a few bullets
(smiles) God,  cannot believe 'm standing here with Mary Jenson
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now
(taken aback) Oh
are you
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet
(off his look) There was this guy back in college who was bothering me
got kind of ugly--a restraining order, the whole bit
Anyway, when  got out of Princeton  changed my name as a precaution
Jeez
that sounds awful
Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times
Didn't we just do that
Ted doesn't know how to respond to this and then she smiles
(cont'd) 'm kidding
'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is  already have plans
How about tomorrow night
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years
(beat) Don't make me wait another day
Mary seems touched by this
Tell me where you're staying
'll pick you up at eight
Ted finally smiles and we : '  - content Healy is parked out front of Mary's apartment, absently listening to her spill her guts to Magda while he reads the newspaper
(
) 'm buying bananas tonight
(
) Why
(
) Back when  was your age  always used to make myself a big banana split after sex think you're gonna need one tonight
(
) Don't get ahead of yourself
You'll probably need it before  will
'  - Mary is skipping around the apartment while Magda sits on the couch
Don't bet on it
Last time  had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker
So maybe  could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be
Love
Come on,  wouldn't call it love
Oh no
ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster
- he's reveling in it all
(
) Well  am pretty psyched
ran into a guy today  hadn't seen since high school
Healy loses the smile and sits up
(
) An old flame
(
) Kind of
Ted Peloquin--one of the sweetest guys in the world
Healy
(cont'd) He was so shy and clumsy
had a major crush on him
as he nearly puts his head through the roof
He grabs hold of the steering wheel and pounds his head on it
No
(
) (cont'd) We're gonna go out tonight
Oh, that reminds me, 've got to call what's-his-face and cancel
Do  sense a chill in the air
Mary sits down
Oh, Magda,  let my head get in the way of my love life
always pick guys on what feel in here
(pats heart) But with this Pat guy my head kept saying "Grow up, Mary
You have a lot in common with this one, you'll grow to feel something for him
" But it never happened
- he couldn't look more crushed
Suddenly his cellular phone
He stares at it for , ,
Panic-stricken
Then he answers it
(jovial voice) Hey, Patty-boy here
Sorry  missed ya, but 'm out rustling up some champagne and roses in preparation for the greatest birthday of my life
Hope you and yours are having a good day, too
Healy makes a  sound and then holds his breath
- she stares at the phone, feeling cornered
Uh, hi Pat, it's me, Mary
Just wanted to say 'm
looking forward to tonight
She hangs up
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night
can't do it-- just found out it's his birthday
(sighs) guess 've gotta cancel on Ted
- he blows imaginary smoke off an imaginary gun
Then he sits back and smugly listens to her
But then he hears something that concerns him--a  on the door and the dog - she puts down the phone and answers the door
It's Tucker, the architect
(surprised) Tucker
come on in
pulling his hair out
He's on an emotional roller coaster heading downhill
(
) Well look who's here
' - Tucker is carrying an unopened and absently flicking the  pooch off his ankles
There she is-- brought you a little thirst-quencher, Mag
Oh, you are sweet
No, 'm not
just want to get you-drunk so you'll pass out and  can have my way with Mary
Everyone
Can  pour you one
Thanks, but 've got to be going
Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit
Tucker's tone shifts and Mary grows concerned
What's up
Well
've got a little more news about your friend Healy
Mary seems relieved
know what you're going to say, but he already told me everything
know he's not an architect
Tucker pulls out a piece of paper
(cont'd) think you'd better sit down
Tucker,  appreciate you doing all this, but 'm really strapped for time here and-- Mary, the man's a killer
- he can't believe his ears
- as she lowers herself onto the couch
(stunned) What
've got a friend in the Boston police department
He faxed me this this morning
'll just give you the highlights
(reading from rap sheet) After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick
Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen
At sixteen he committed his first murder--a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove
He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him
In his mid-twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington
Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on
Mary looks like she's going to throw up
- he listens intently, his face ashen
(
) Holy shit
(
) Puffy, get over here
We hear the - of the dog's nails on the floor, then a followed by a
Magda
The little shit lied to me about that guy
Mary picks up the startled dog and pets him
(growing emotional) can't believe this is happening
'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour
Okay, just calm down
It's going to be okay
Tucker puts his arms around her
Why you two never hooked up is beyond me
Mary looks fondly at Tucker
Magda's right, 'm so lucky to have you in my life
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head
(smiles) The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off
Yeah, yeah
Okay,  think  know what to do
'll call him right now
- he looks stunned
His cellular
He stares at it, then picks it up
Hi, 'm out drinking champagne and roses
and 'm really happy
Leave a message
(
) (nervous) Uh, hey buddy
Oh boy, am  pissed
You're not going to believe this--well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to--but just got beeped for emergency surgery
Well, um, sorry, but 'm going to have to bail on you
As we hear a , Healy stares at the cell phone, seething
: '   - Tucker comes out the front door, looks around, then walks off down the sidewalk
- on Healy, his steely gaze fixed on Tucker
(under breath) You're gonna pay, fucker
Healy discreetly pulls out and slowly follows Tucker in his car
- He continues down the sidewalk, looking back once or twice, apprehensive
He rounds a corner, then stops next to an
He looks around nervously again
Then Tucker '  and
Healy pulls into traffic and follows
: - Dom's mixing a drink while Ted paces nervously
Oh God, 'm fucking nervous
don't know if 'm ready for this, man
Just relax
Have you hit the cash machine
(pats his back pocket) Got cash
Car clean
Plenty of gas
Check
Mints
Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash
Dom nods, satisfied
Okay, sounds like you're all set
Just clean the pipes and it's a go
Hm
You know, clean the pipes
Pipes
What are you talking about
You jerk off before all big dates, right
Tell me you jerk off before your big dates
Ted just stares at him
(cont'd) (incredulous) You don't jerk off before--
Are you crazy
That's like going out there with a loaded gun
No wonder you're nervous
Ted considers this
(cont'd) Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous
No
Dom shrugs
Duh
Why's that
'm usually too tired to be
Dom makes a game-show  sound
Wrong
It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more
That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will
(starting to believe) Huh
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load
That's a medical fact
And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid
You're actually thinking like a girl
They love that
Jesus Christ you're right
You bet your ass 'm right
You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels
(shakes his head) Holy shit, 've been going out with a loaded gun
People get hurt that way
: - Dom walks out of the lobby just as another cab arrives and Mary gets out
He sees and her and ducks behind a bush as she walks past him
'   - Ted has a newspaper splayed out on the counter (open to the bra ads) as he furiously    (chest-high side view
) We see some balled-up tissue nearby
After several frantic strokes, he takes a deep breath and slowly and loudly , clearly having
He draws a few more breaths, picks up a face cloth, and goes to clean up
But something's missing: The Load
Ted looks down, checks his hands, pants, shoes, looks in the sink, finally glances at the ceiling, with no luck
The Load That's when the doorbell
Ted couldn't look more
As he buckles his pants, he makes a last, panicky reconnaissance of the area
The doorbell   and Ted reluctantly goes to answer it
'   - Ted opens the door and Mary is standing there looking as lovely as ever
Hey
Hi, Ted
You look great
Thanks
She notices something
(cont'd) What's that
Hm
On your ear, you've got something
' - a   is hanging off of Ted's earlobe like a drop earring
(cont'd) It looks like a gob of
Mary leans forward for a closer look
Ted is terrified
(cont'd) (making face) Is that
hair gel
Sure
Oh great,  ran out
Before Ted can stop her, Mary grabs The Load off his ear and : - Healy is still following Tucker in his car
Finally Tucker stops in front of a lavish Victorian home and gets out carrying a pizza and wearing a
Healy  to a sideways stop, jumps out and
(cont'd) You motherfucker, you're a dead man
Tucker drops the pizza as Healy   into a tree
(cowering) Okay, Pat, take it easy--don't do anything stupid
Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me
Healy
Whoa, whoa-- don't know what you're talking about
Maybe this'll jog your memory
Healy  him across the face
(cont'd) 'll give you a hint--it's got something to do with me being a murderer
Healy raises his arm again and Tucker tries to shield himself
Okay, okay,  might've gotten some bad information
Healy grabs him by the collar
That stalker Ted got to you, right
You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit
Who
Healy throws Tucker to the ground and takes off his sport coat
This is your last chance, you fuck
Now either you come clean or 'm going to kick your ass from here to Tallahassee
Healy grabs Tucker by the hair and cocks his arm
,
Tucker suddenly gets emotional
Healy stops and looks at him
You what
You heard me, goddamnit
love her
Healy slowly lets go
(cont'd) 'm a phony--just like you, man
What do you mean
mean 'm a fucking fraud
'm no architect
Don't be a putz--who's been to Santiago twice in a year
(scoffing) Estadio Olimpico --please
But
but you knew people at Harvard
knew shit
The only thing  knew was that you were a fake and  made up everything else
(sighs) My real name's Norm
deliver pizzas
Bullshit
Tucker rolls his eyes and pulls out his   , with him pictured beside the name Norman Plante
As Healy let's this sink in, we : - Ted's rolling a little wine around in a glass
He takes a sip, nods his approval
Thanks, that's great
The  turns to Mary
Madame
- The light, puffy bangs that Mary started the night with are gone, replaced by a glazed,  - up front
Thank you
The waiter pours her a glass and leaves
Now by killer , you mean
mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston
The guy's a freak
(stunned) Jeez, Mary
'm
Well, lucky for me  found out
Thank God have friends like Tucker
(beat) Look, 'm sick of talking about stalkers
(big smile) Let's talk about you
: - Healy and Tucker are bonding over a beer
So then in '94  went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through hooked up with the Pizza Barn
And you met Mary how
Just dumb luck
delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown--that was it for me
went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later  was laid out in her office with a broken back
How'd you manage that one
(matter-of-factly) Friend
Baseball bat
Nice
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up
Hey, hey, hey, 'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition--that's crossing the line
What line
The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war
Future wife Get real, man--you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes
Why you son of a-- Tucker grabs Healy by the jacket
Okay, calm down, calm down--the bottom line is neither of us are going to get her if we don't do something about that headcase she's with now
As Tucker slowly releases him, we : - Ted and Mary are eating  at the snack bar
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen
(shrugging) No short game
She smiles
We should play some time
mean, if you can afford to lose some money
(smiling) What are you
Twenty-two
Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron--don't sandbag me, lady
Mary smiles coyly
Okay, sometimes 'm a nineteen
That's more like it
(to Counter-Man) Two more nitrate-sicles please
- You got it
Mary is amused by this
Nitrate-sicles-- like that
say they should put more meats on a stick, you know
They got a lot of sweets on sticks--popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops--but hardly any meat
agree there should be more
The Counter-Man hands each of them another corndog
You know what 'd like to see
Meat in a cone
You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver
like it
And think of the toppings--cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly Not to mention ketchup and hot peppers
They smile at one another
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted
(pleased) Yeah
We've got a lot in common
Ted takes a chance
Well
why don't you move back
Ah, my roots here are too deep
love my practice, the people  work with, Warren's got a nice thing going (joking) Why don't you just move down here and marry me
Mary smiles and Ted
perhaps a little too hard
: '  - Ted and Mary are sitting on her front stoop
So you're a writer
Trying to be
Well good for you
bet it works out for you
We'll see
If it doesn't, what the hell, at least  gave it a shot
That's right
And the good thing is you can do it anywhere
What about you, Mare
How the hell'd you manage to stay single
don't know
My friends think 'm too picky
think 'm just a weirdo magnet did come close once--just last year, in fact
There was this guy he lived in San Francisco
the corner of building
We see Healy and Tucker from the shadows
() That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch
Fucking sickening
Healy and Tucker duck back into the alley
: '  - Healy is throwing   through an open - '  - We hear the  and see Magda  on the couch with a watery     and the dog Puffy at her feet
Suddenly a   flies through the window, landing on the rug
Puffy    and approaches the treat
He sniffs it, then
doggie treat lands beside him and he eats that, too
Then
'  - Tucker keeps throwing the treats up and Healy looks concerned
How many is that
Four
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch--you sure it won't kill him
never said that
As Tucker throws another
'  - The doggie treat   ' , waking her up
Magda looks around, gets her bearings, and then
: '   - Mary and Ted, still sitting on the stoop
Mary seems a little reflective
and then it was all over
() We haven't spoken since
(sincere) Wow
That's too bad
He sounds almost perfect
Yeah
almost
(beat) You want to come up and watch Sportscenter
Uh no
think 'm gonna get out while 'm ahead
Mary looks a little disappointed
Ted
you're not that far ahead
Look, Mary, the truth is
'll be in town for a while now but  don't think we should see each other for a few weeks
(alarmed) Why not
Well
to be honest
'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when  get nervous 'm not myself and 'm afraid 'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so  think should just lay back until  regain my composure
Mary sort of smiles
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books
All right, let's go
Ted jumps up and starts up the stairs two at a time
'  - As Ted and Mary , we see Magda     with one hand and
Mary doesn't know what to make of it
Magda, what are you doing
Magda turns off the vacuum and we hear a   coupled with the
of Puffy
Oh, hi hon
Just straightening up
Where's Puffy
Ah, he was being a pest so  put him in the bathroom
As the
continues, Magda and starts  the  stand
(to Ted, concerned) Um, Ted,  need a moment with Magda--would you let the dog out of the bathroom
Yeah, sure
Ted walks down the hall, following the until he comes to the bathroom door
The  is now and he
' - the bottom part of the door is being from the force of something
( out) Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy
(
) ( out) Toy poodle
Ted thinks about this, shrugs, and opens the door
like a Rottweiler, Puffy  at Ted's jugular
'   - Ted stumbles back into the living room with the hopped-up dog He    , tumbles onto the floor, and fights for his life
Mary and Magda  as Ted and Puffy mix it up on the floor
Ted tries to     but Puffy of Ted's anguished face as he gets pulled back into the room
Ted manages to
Stop it, you're hurting him
(out of breath) Tell him
to calm down
Puffy gets a piece of Ted's wrist and Ted  and drops him
Both man and toy poodle
They start
Puffy leaps at Ted and Ted into a wall
Unfazed, the dog gets a running start and '
Ted manages to duck and
: - --Ted and Warren are at the top of a giant Warren motions that he has decided this is not for him
Ted shoots him a look that makes Warren feel like a sissy
Convinced it's not too dangerous, Warren decides to go for it and Ted follows
--At the bottom of the slide Ted splashes into the huge pool of water, laughing, having a blast
Then he looks around
no sign of Warren
Concerned, Ted dives underwater and a moment later Resurfaces clutching a Warren
- --Mary pumps Warren's stomach as he coughs water out of his mouth
Ted looks on sheepishly
- Ted and Warren walk down a city sidewalk
As they pass a shop Warren points to the window excitedly
In the window there is a mannequin dressed in a Super- hero outfit, i
e
a generic superman
Warren then pulls Ted into the store
: - Ted comes out followed by a beaming Warren dressed in the Super-Hero outfit
They continue walking again and a few steps later Warren excitedly points to another shop window
In the window is a mannequin dressed in a cowboy outfit, i
e
Lone Ranger (hat, badge, holster, chaps, vest, boots, spurs, etc
) Again, Warren pulls Ted into the store
: - Mary is window shopping with a few bags in hand
She turns and reacts amused
Warren is now dressed in the cowboy outfit and a humiliated Ted follows dressed in the loose fitting Super-hero outfit
-  - --Ted and Mary are walking arm and arm on a where
Right behind them are Magda and Herb (the Homeless guy) enjoying one another's company
Ted is on top of the world, feeling good, looking good-right up until he gets the Suddenly he gets
-  - --Ted is   on the pavement and a has his     as he Mary looks on, concerned
-  - --Ted and Mary come out of the grocery store each Ted also is  , Ted     , then starts putting the groceries in the back seat
'  - --Mary pulls her car up in front of her apartment Ted gets out of the passenger's side, he notices that He quickly before Mary notices
-  - --Warren is futilely taking swings in a while Mary looks on helplessly
Finally Ted goes into the cage,        , and
-- distraught Ted   on a bench
Beside him, Mary comforts Warren whose : '  - Ted shows up at Mary's apartment door carrying a and a
When he , the door opens
'  - Ted peeks around the corner and sees a  Mary sitting on the couch
(chipper) Hey
Mary doesn't look up
Ted , revealing his gifts
(cont'd) The flowers are for you and the ball's for Warren
had a friend of mine Fedex it to me--it's signed by Tony Conigliaro
Mary finally looks up but doesn't smile
Did you hire Pat Healy to follow me around
Ted tries to hide his horror
(lamely) What do you mean
Mary picks up a letter off the coffee table and hands it to him
Ted takes a quick look and then drops it on the table
It's not true
right, Ted
Ted
Well, funny story there
You see, uh, it started out as a uh
yeah
it's true
= Mary stands up
Get out
Wait, hold on, Mary--it's not as bad as it sounds
certainly didn't know-- That you put a murderer on my trail
Well yeah,  didn't know much about him just thought-- What did you think, Ted
That you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone  could
really go for
Mary starts to get emotional
Mary,  swear  wasn't trying to trick you
Then what the fuck did you do it for
did it because because 'd never stopped thinking about you and if  didn't find you  knew my life would never be good again
Mary looks away
(softly) Please leave
(devastated) Mary, come on
Go
(beat) Okay
And so Ted does
: '   - Ted comes out of the building, a broken man
He paces back and forth on the sidewalk, manic with despair
Then he seems to grow angry
He rifles through his pockets until he finds a ' - the paper reads: 'Healy's Miami address--229 Court Street, apt
43
' - Ted walks down a rather dark hallway until he comes to apartment 43
He  on the door but no one answers
He tries the handle and
'  - Ted  and immediately reacts to the
reveals that the place is a fucking - is everywhere,  fill the room, a  scampers across the carpet
Hello
No answer
Suddenly he   out in the hall, so he ducks behind the door
Healy and Tucker  the apartment and stop in their tracks when they see the
Ho-ly shit
Hey, this is a pretty nice place
Sully
What the fuck happened here
Again, no answer
Suddenly Ted    shut and grabs Healy by the collar
(cont'd) (alarmed) Hey, hey, hey
Surprised
Hey, buddy, don't do anything rash now
(to Tucker) Who the fuck are you
He's in love with Mary, too
Ted releases Healy and glares at him
You fucked me, man
Why would you do that
(righteous) What do you mean 'why'
Answer the question, shitball
think everybody could use a drink
Tucker goes into the kitchen
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and  did and  started to like her, and then  realized  just couldn't in good conscience do it
(amazed) Do what
Turn her over to a stalker
What
You're calling me a stalker
That's right--if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself
Suddenly they hear a  and turn to see Bill the Boa slithering into the room with  , --  in his midsection
(cont'd) (sickened) Oh Christ
poor dog
You're a sick man, you know that
Yeah well fuck you
You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn
Your turn
(getting emotional) That's right, hot shot
My turn What's the matter with me, huh
Why can't  ever get the great girl
Give the big pig with the
to Healy, right
Well  was sick of it, man
No more--it was my turn
It was time for me
time for me
to be happy
This is so pathetic that it actually gets to Ted
He sits down, runs his fingers through his hair
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water
Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you
don't know what you're talking about
'm talking about the letter, asshole
What
Ted stares at him
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal
Why the fuck would  do that
'd be screwing myself
The guys stare at one another, then Tucker comes out the kitchen with a drink
They turn their attention to him
(cont'd) You little fuck
What
You fucking prick, we had a deal--you said you wouldn't fuck me and  wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture
(moves in on Tucker) You crossed the line, man
Tucker backs away nervously
Whoa, whoa, you're getting crazy now
Why would  cross the line--what do you think got no pride
Healy grabs Tucker by the neck
(cont'd) swear
didn't tell her nothing
You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit
Oh that makes a lot of sense
Why would rat myself out
Like 'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face You were following us
Don't flatter yourself-- was following her ,  always do
How the hell you think got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve
This gets Ted's attention
You mean
Steve didn't say all that stuff about Warren
Are you shitting me--Mr
Goody-Two-Shoes
He was like a fucking eagle scout
You two should be kissing my balls--if it wasn't for me, she might've married that schmuck
Ted thinks about this
The hell with you both--'m out of here
Ted walks out the door leaving Healy and Tucker to stare each other down
Just then Hal the Great Dane walks out of the bedroom with a   stuck on his head
Healy does a double-take, then looks back at the snake
(sadly) Oh
Sully
Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it
: '  - an alarmed Mary
Woogie
What are what are you doing here
reveals Dom sitting on her bed
Did you get my letter, Mare
The one about Ted
You sent that
Uh-huh
was worried about you
Well
thank you
But
you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me
(excited) That's what  want to tell ya
've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what
You were right -- needed help
(cautious) That's great, Woogie, 'm happy you're better--you seem
good--but
you put me through quite an ordeal, you know
Dom nods aggressively
(cont'd) had to move, go to court, change my last name--you stole all my shoes
Dom stands up
Look at me
Mary turns her head
(cont'd) Look at me, Mary On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me,  did not steal your shoes
Woogie,  caught you red-handed
All right,  did, but  was in a weird place then
He approaches her
(cont'd) Give me a break, Mare,  was nuts
Mary backs into the living room
: '  - Healy and Tucker are parked right out front They seem concerned
(
) Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me
Who the hell's Woogie
Tucker just shrugs
Mary and Dom
=~ 'm asking you to leave
(gentle) Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong
(beat) 'm not leaving
' (cont'd) (
) Not until  get a little something to remember you by
(
) (clearly struggling) Stop that
No
Somebody help me
Healy and Tucker jump out of the car and
: '  - Healy and Tucker     and freeze at what they see
- Dom is cradling     in his arms and trying to crawl to the door while Mary holds him back
Stop it
Just one pair
You owe me that much, you heartless bitch
Healy and Tucker grab Dom and throw him down on the couch
Dom, you're pathetic, fucking over your friend Ted like that
What
You fucked him over, too
He's no friend of mine
Suddenly Magda  from her bedroom
She's holding a half-eaten Herb, the Homeless Man, follows after her, sporting a Tom Jones and buttoning up his shirt
What the hell's going on here
At first no one knows what to say
Then: We're in love with your roommate
Aw, Christ,  can't take it anymore
'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place
Magda heads back into her bedroom and Herb follows
Tucker, where are your crutches
Tucker is stumped for a second, then: (British accent) Interesting query, Mary
Healy slaps Tucker in the back of the head
Shut the fuck up and tell her the truth
Before he can respond, Ted
Well isn't this nice--now we've got the whole gang together
Ted can hardly believe Dom is there
Dom
What are you
You stole her from me
Now  want her back
(rolling eyes) Woogie and  went out for awhile in high school
(stunned) You're Woogie Dom Wooganowski
Duh
But but you're married
You have kids a great wife
If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest
If  may  have a proposal
Everyone turns to Healy
(cont'd) say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants
Now Mary,  know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us
Are you crazy
Why would  pick you
You're a murderer
Healy glares at Tucker
Uh, well
not exactly
You see, exaggerated a little there
You mean he's not a criminal
God no
(pleased) 'm just a pathological liar
Mary looks at Tucker, confused
Tucker
not you, too
Tucker lowers his head and reluctantly nods
Name's Norm
live up in Pompano with my folks
Oh Jesus
Just then the door opens and  , the Packers quarterback , with Warren (wearing a walkman) beside him
Everyone is stunned
(cont'd) Brett
Hi, Mary
What the hell is Brett Favre doing here
We're in town to play the Dolphins
called him
told him to pick up Warren and get over here
everyone turns their attention to Ted
(cont'd) Mary,  found out that your buddy Tucker there lied to you about Brett
Tucker lowers his head
(cont'd) Brett never said anything bad about Warren
He loves Warren
and from what he just told me on the phone, he loves you, too
(beat) He's the guy you should be with
That's right, Mare
And you know 'll always be true to you
Aw shit, this isn't fair
Mary manages a smile
(to Mary) realized something tonight
'm no better than any of these guys
None of them really love you
they just fixated on you because of how you made them feel
But that's not real love
Thank you for letting me see that
Now  can get on with the rest of my life
Tucker, Healy, and Dom scoff
Oh please
Don't listen to him, Mary
It's a ploy
You are so full of shit, Strohman
Are you going to stand here and tell us that you aren't in love with this girl
Ted looks into Mary's eyes
She looks vulnerable
Yeah
that's what 'm telling you
(winks) See you, Mare
Ted looks Mary in the eye, then starts for the door
(cont'd) (as he passes Warren) See you, Warren
Huh
Ted lifts the earphones off Warren's ear
See you, Warren
Bye, Ted
Ted then
They all stand there in silence for a moment, then Dom turns to Brett Favre
Hey, Brett, any chance  can get you to autograph one of these pumps for me
: - Ted is walking down the street
Everyone he passes stares at him
Suddenly Mary comes running down the
Ted
Ted stops and looks across the street at her
He wipes his eyes, hopeful
What what are you doing here
You forgot your keys
She holds up a   -
(deflated) Oh
Thanks
They remain across the street from one another
Did you mean what you said back there, Ted
Ted starts to well up again
(cont'd) Ted
(looking down) just want you to be happy, Mary
But  think 'd be happiest
with you
Ted just stares at her
You're fucking with me, right
Mary smiles
(cont'd) (wiping eyes) But but what about Steve
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun--the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble
Now Ted smiles
(cont'd) Get over here
Really
Really
The  Ted starts walking across the street
Suddenly a He bounces around under the bus like a rag doll, then finally squirts out the back end and Mary  and runs toward the body as a  begins to gather
Ted, no, no
She starts giving him
Somebody covers him with a blanket
Just then, another      like speedbumps
The crowd winces
(cont'd) Somebody hold up traffic
(beat) Come on, Ted
Come on
Tell me you're going to be okay
Then Ted takes a deep breath and his eyes flutter open
Mary
Oh Mary,  love you
Mary's smile is as bright as the light from heaven
love you too, Ted
(beat) think  always have
As the two lovebirds kiss, a   : Over here
found his foot
It was in the storm drain
as she holds up a   in a cloth
All right, everyone, let's fan out and look for the penis
