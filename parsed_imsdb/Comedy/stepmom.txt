An alarm clock
As , the lovely sleeping face of   rolls into frame
Then out of it
Alarm keeps
Back she comes, pulling the sheets  her head
Motionless now, as we hear
the   of the alarm shutting off
beat
Rachel
out of the room
From the back we see that she's dressed only in a pair of men's boxers
She makes it halfway down the hall, does a   back into the bedroom, frantically  a robe hanging from the door, taking the wall hook  her
She  her robe on as she  down the hall, wall hook   of her back
'  - Ben
You overslept again damn it
The room looks like a 6 (but 'm almost 7) year old exploded
Posters of  on all the walls
Rachel darts about the room mismatching the clothes she forgot to arrange the night before
Get Up Get Up Get Up
The  under the cover doesn't move
Ben you're late
'm serious
'm wearing a very serious face
Don't make me start counting
No movement
Rachel tugs the sleeve of a shirt hanging on a chair, and out comes a magician's bouquet of
She pulls a dirty handkerchief out of the pocket of the shirt -- it's an endless '
Don't make me say three 'm about to say three
(a beat, then) Three
She  the covers off and a blow-up  sleeps in Ben's place
Ben 'm not kidding around
You make yourself appear this instant
saunters across her toes
Rachel  -- then gathers her wits and searches under the bed -- under the bureau -- she opens the closet doors and shoving clothes aside
You might think this is funny but this is actually  funny
Unseen by Rachel, six-year-old  sits, perched on the highest closet shelf, knees under his chin, holding his breath
His eyes gleeful as Rachel frantically closes the closet door
- Rachel hops over the Bunny, navigates through strewn toys and books her baby toe
She limps in agony past a big picture of the kids with their daddy and heads towards a door with a sign
(bellowing) '  - , 10 years old, sits on the edge of her bed, fuming, all of her limbs crossed
She holds up a filthy purple tee shirt
You forgot to wash my purple shirt told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today
didn't forget
was up all night thinking about it and  concluded you're too special to look like everyone else
(she grabs an orangey red tee shirt) Orange Red
That's your color
Few can carry it off
Now please
Help me find your brother
You lost Ben
Of course not
Does he look lost to you
(big breath) -  - Rachel, smoking a cigarette and drinking a diet coke,  open pantry doors, closet doors -- looking for Ben -- attempting to put stone hard butter on toast at the same time
She glances at the clock -- 7:55
Oh dear
Annabelle sits at the table, in a grumpy orangey red mood
Rachel hands her what was once a piece of toast
No
told you
like apple butter not butter butter
(hands her an apple) Here
Never mind
'll just eat my lunch
(forgot) 'm almost done making it
(to the non-existent Ben) Alright Ben -- you deal with the tardy, you write yourself a note, your daddy told you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were
She has opened a cupboard with a Lazy Susan that turns revealing sitting there
Rachel screams
Oh my God
That is so not funny
You're late
You're really late
Now get out here and have some cereal
No
Fine
Eat in the cupboard
She hands him a bowl of sugared cereal -- puts two spoonfuls of instant coffee in Barney cup, and sticks it under the faucet
No
Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops on the bottom
Fine
Rachel grabs the bowl, turn it   on the table reversing the order of the cereal
She  it back in the bowl and quickly hands it back to him, the phone
You touched it
Then have a donut -- No
Alright starve
'm gonna beep daddy at work
He's badgering a witness
Eat
But you told us to starve
(picking up phone) Hello
Duncan
The Ad Agency's already there
'm out the door
(Ben flings a fruit loop at her) Ben
Knock it off
(into phone) It's gonna go beautifully
(another fruit loop) Damn it Ben -- Rachel runs around absentmindedly loading out leftover pizza, Hoho's, and Chips
She glances at the clock again -- 8:00
You swore
You owe me a quarter
Did you remember my egg carton
told you  needed my egg carton for seed planting today
Absolutely Duncan 'm on top of everything
Rachel takes the eggs from the fridge, and dumps them -- accidentally missing the sink
They  onto the floor
She hands the empty carton to Annabelle
EGGzactly
'm putting on my coat -- (she hangs up, panicked) We are late
We are seriously late
Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed -- No
Ben races away but Rachel  And  him
He wiggles in her arms as she struggles to change his clothes
Just as she gets his bottoms off she drops his clothes in the pile of gooey eggs when we hear a loud  at the kitchen door
Holding a half naked Ben in her arms, Rachel looks up at
An immaculately dressed, intimidatingly intel- ligent, utterly beautiful woman staring at her with extreme disapproval
Mommy
Annabelle and Ben  into their mother's arms like little angels
Jackie shoots a fiercely protective glare at Rachel
They eyes
Enough wattage to light up all of Manhattan
' ,  - Jackie and the kids exit Rachel's building, onto a bustling Soho street
The kids clamber into the double-parked Volvo wagon
Jackie, still pissed, climbs behind the wheel
Drives off
'    - Jackie drives the children down a tree-lined street in Englewood, New Jersey
Ben is banging Jackie's sunglasses case against the window
it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple
(yes she does) don't care
know you don't, but if you had, chrom- atically you are in the purple family
Jackie fishes through her purse
Finds a toy airplane for Ben
He stops banging her glasses case, starts banging the plane
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants
Doesn't she have underpants of her own
noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches
As if by rote, they hold out their lunches
One is a plastic Vons bag and the other a crumpled Macy's bag
She collects them and hands Ben and Annabelle two brightly colored lunch bags
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night
do that, you  lie
And  him
Never say 'never' -- it's not fair to say 'always' -- and no name calling
Use your words
hate when you say that
Thank you
Those were all words hate the planet Uranus
Terrible name for a planet
Annabelle and Ben look up at her curiously
hate snails and blue cheese
Especially together
Hate have lava
(reflects) Lava's hateable
never thought of that
hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up
Excellent point
hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt
hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk
Jackie nods sagely
Pulls up next to a school playground
hate to say goodbye
Eskimo Kiss
(they rub noses) Russian Orthodox Wedding Kiss
They bump foreheads and elbows
Ben runs toward the kindergarten playground; Jackie watches concerned as Annabelle climbs the steps
The only orangey red dot in a sea of purple
,  - Taxi pulls up to a converted warehouse
Rachel  out, for the door
- Black and white  the frame
Like a checkerboard
We and realize we are seeing a group of  waddling against a black and white backdrop
We see a  ' in a holding glasses on a tray
, , in a glides through it all
In the center the only dash of color is Rachel -- who has just entered and starts expertly directing the action
She calls out to her assistant,
Perpetually hip
Perpetually young
Cooper, back the fill off  don't have enough shadow
You've got a fruit loop in your hair
You say that like  don't know that
once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head -- And when did that pass
Actually, never
They'll always hate you
There's a gene for it
-- Rachel's boss, an elegant, edgy, Englishman interrupts them
Congratulations
Only forty minutes late
You're handling this promotion really well Rachel
Duncan
My work is everything to me
This'll never happen again
Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing -- Duncan backs off, charmed by her ballsiness
The music  just then, and a penguin  forward and  the model
The  of the camera
We  for a second, seeing the photo Rachel just took
An Avedonesque portrait of a model being  by a penguin with a maitre'd who  his tray and the penguins seem to be  and  uproariously
It's an inspired photo
'  - 2:30 Jackie and   -- ruggedly handsome man, mid-forties, charming, disarming, and smart as they come
They sit side by side on a couch across from  , an Elementary School Counselor Mr
and Mrs
Harrison, while change is exhilarating for adults, it can be quite challenging for a child
Luke's beeper beeps
He ignores it; focuses on Mr
Franklin
won't get that
It's fine
Change
we were talking about change
The fact that you two are remarrying obviously has Annabelle overjoyed
(they look at her, dumbfounded) And she's very excited about your move to Switzerland
She said we're getting remarried
Suddenly -- a long bell rings -- Jackie  , startled
Only a fire drill
My concern is that Annabelle seems apathetic towards her work knowing she's leaving before the end of the semester
Mrs
Franklin we're not -- Planning on getting -- Remarried
There is no move
(trying to appear unfazed) Really
Well then my concern for -- Luke's beeper  again
They talk right over Mrs
Franklin
Are you here
'm here
Because you don't really seem here
'm here
've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have  answered the goddamn thing
Something's up wi
You think  didn't get that
She cuts a look at Mrs
Franklin
Excuse him
He never learned how to turn the darn thing off
And reaches
Does it for him
'm wondering if there's anything going on at home that could be intensifying Annabelle's need to create this fantasy
Long pause
Then suddenly they both start speaking
've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly
But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids might add -- she moved in last month
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age -- Rachel's not half my age
We're not discussing your age
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father
Jackie, they come to be part of my life
Rachel is part of that life
Mr
Harrison,  hear you talking about your life, your needs, but are you really in touch with what Annabelle needs
(suddenly fierce) This man would walk thru fire for Annabelle, gladly, any day of the week
Napalm
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up -- Jackie, she was five minutes late -- 'm wondering if Annabelle is responding to the underlying hostility that exists between Rachel and Mrs
Harrison
Of course she's responding to it
You think it's easy for any of us
You think it's easy for Jackie to watch her kids being looked after by someone who has half the experience she does
Of course she's going to be hostile, irrational, and defensive
Thank you Luke
Mrs
Franklin doesn't quite know what to say
The bell
Thank you Mrs
Franklin
Jackie
(they get up) This has been very valuable for us
And 'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight
It's Wednesday night
She's at my house
'll talk to her
'll call from work
We can have a conference call
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes
And they're out the door
You can hear the fight as it echoes down the elementary school hallway
, ,   - Jackie and Luke exit the pleasant suburban school
Head for the parking area
You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill
'm worried
Me too
Luke,  need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend
(pointedly) that way you'll be there, and 'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
Fine
But  wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so 'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding
Easy enough
Good
Well
Take care
As if on automatic pilot they move in to kiss each other goodbye then stop
Each takes a step back
15 years of hellos and goodbyes
beat
wave
They head their separate ways
'  - Establishing shot of Jackie's lovely home on its lovely street
Old trees
Comfortable front lawns
Safe and happy
place to grow kids, dogs, probably walruses, even
We  toward the warm glow from within this home
'  - Jackie setting the table
Annabelle recording the moment with her omnipresent
didn't say that
Why would  say that
Well Daddy and  were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen
don't want that to happen
Why would  want that to happen
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends -- Mass hysteria
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in
'm not upset
Why would  be upset
Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine
But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me
Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face
You wind up looking like
She stops
It's just too horrible
Like who
Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty
Ben enters in white gloves and Jackie's scarf
Pick a card
Any card
Jackie picks a card
It just slipped out
It happens
(a beat) What happens when he loves Rachel more than us
That will never happen
Never say never you always say that
'll bet daddy's mad at me now
Queen of diamonds
Seven of clubs
Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it
'm gonna call him
Annabelle, daddy and  will always be there
That's one time always is always
You can call him after dinner but
Annabelle  out of the room
Jackie watches her sadly
Ben hits Jackie hard with his magic wand
Poof
You're happy now
Thank you Ben
(unhappily) Annabelle
Ben finds himself alone in the kitchen
He hits himself on the head, hard
Poof
He begins to serve himself dinner
Alone
,  - Rachel and Luke exit a neighborhood bistro
Stroll down the street
(irritated) Okay, if they're going to have sauce, put something in it besides flour and chicken broth
(quietly) It was a veal stock,  thi
Well, it wasn't a reduction like you do it
Boiling down half a ton of bones
Luke is thinking of something
She's watching that
The way you cook
If you could make love, 'd marry you
(softly) We have to talk
(happy) Uh-oh
mention marriage, all of a sudden
(ominous Nazi Baritone) Ve haff to ta
didn't want to spoil our supper
You'd rather spoil our walk home
Yeh, it's cheaper
Okay, what
just found out  have to go to Boston to get a deposition
might not be back until Saturday
(mock horror) So 'll have to order in
(dropping the other shoe) We have the kids this weekend, so
(softly) Jesus
He glances over
thought it was her weekend
Do ever see you alone
He draws a breath
The concern is behind his eyes
Anyway,  thought
while 'm gone
maybe 'll hire in some help
For what
Just a babysitter --  mean
you're working
can take them to work with me -- can shift things around -- You don't need to
don't expect you to handle them yourself
Can't handle them myself is what you mean
Can't
Maybe she's right
Because he doesn't say anything
You don't trust me to be alone with them
trust you of course  do but -- But
But what
But you're not good at this
Not yet
'm sorry
know how responsible, caring adults parent children
'm bribe 'em
But 'em a dog or something
Maybe a Doberman
He loves her
But this problem is real
Look
know they hate me
They don't hate you -- And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work -- Nobody's telling them to hate you -- Really
Look in your ex-wife's eyes
It's complicated for Jackie
It's complicated for me
You don't have kids -- you don't understand -- (angry now) Oh right
So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause  just don't understand
No you don't
And 'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now -- You know  don't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot
your ex-wife's doing a bang up job and  have to face it every Tuesday and Thursday and every other goddamn weekend and  just don't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long
Jesus what did you see in her
don't get it --  just don't get it
They've reached their building
As they enter
She's a great mother
'  '  - The door of the freight elevator  open
As Rachel and Luke step out into their loft, the phone is
She looks to Luke
Then  to  it up
Hello
:
'  - ' Annabelle with a phone in her closet
Hearing Rachel, she hangs up
pink   creeps under the door '  '  - The most beautiful little puppy in the world -- sitting in a puddle of pee on a hardwood floor
Aw George
not again
who wants to help clean up this time
(overly zealous) Annabelle
She looks around -- completely exhausted
It's late
Annabelle is video taping the dog pee
Ben's in the kitchen talking to himself
He pours and sprinkles, working intently on a
Why do you make that face when you talk to me
(she imitates Rachel) And that voice you use
you think 'm deaf or something
Ben  the magic potion theatrically with his fingertips
(reaching for her) 'm sorry, okay
Let's not fi
Don't touch me
'm allergic to you
She starts sneezing furiously and scratching
Ben comes out of the kitchen carrying a steaming cup of potion
"Those who travel far and near this will make you
" have to work on my video project
Don't follow me
can put myself to bed
She races upstairs
Rachel follows
So does Ben
And George
(
) Excuse me -- (following into Annabelle's room) Annabelle let's get something clear
don't have to listen to you
You're not my mother
Thank God for that
She leaves the room  the door behind her
Takes a breath, turns, and walks back in
What  meant and perhaps  didn't say it well was you have a great mom
You don't need another one
But when you're at this house -- This is my daddy's house -- This is my house too
And this is my room so get out
(
) Excuse me
Rachel throws open the door
Ben stands there innocently
made you some cocoa
See
Thank you Ben
That was so sweet of you
(pointedly to Annabelle) Goodnight Annabelle
Sweet dreams
Rachel leads Ben to his room
With Rachel safe out of sight, Annabelle takes the puppy into her arms and cuddles it
'  - '  '  - Rachel, dead on his feet, reads "Goodnight Moon" to Ben
"In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon
" Aren't you going to drink your cocoa
It's the good kind
(faking a big sip) Mmmm
Tasty
You're a master chef Ben
Just like your dad
Ben points to the book -- she 'reads' skipping pages, a hundred miles an hour desperate to get to the end of the book
"Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben
No
You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing  can't sleep otherwise
Ben's eyes are glued to her
She lays down next to him, yawns
"In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon
" "And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon
" (laying head down) That's nice Ben
Ben reads until Rachel's asleep
He looks at her in
Rachel
Rachel
No response
Rachel's really asleep
He lifts her head
It flops down
In  he jumps off the bed and with a quick look back, races from the room, and
down the hallway,  into walls -- He  inside Annabelle's room,  the door behind him
Ben
What's wrong
(triumphantly) killed her
Ben and Annabelle gape at one another, stunned
'  - Rachel pulls up  in Luke's Grand Cherokee
As she  to a stop, the kids pile out with their gear
Rachel takes an anxious look toward Jackie's place
Here we go
'  - The clock reads 8:10
Rachel and the kids enter
Annabelle's hair is brushed forward, hiding her face
Ben is ebullient
Jackie's edgy, ready to snap
How do you hold down a job
It's 8:10
You were supposed to be here at 7:00
She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays
(pulls out post it) got it right here
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday
It's not that hard
Didn't you have a mother
(flinching) Can  please have a cup of coffee
We don't have any coffee
What is this
The Betty Ford Center
Annabelle, how's your video rep
Annabelle  past her
Ben saunters off after his sister
Jackie turns to Rachel, accusingly
What happened with Annabelle
Has nothing  said gotten through to you
Maybe you could back off just a little bit -- What did you do
Nothing
Look,  want to talk to you about
well
Luke said to ask you
Jackie's edge sharpened by Rachel's unease
See, the place where  can connect with Annabelle is my photography
Because she loves video and all
And
She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only
a ridiculously expensive and inappropriate item, which her father and  have already told her she is far too young to own
But you apparently want to buy her forgiveness, with
(had enough) Forgiveness
For what , exactly
Silence
How much time have you got
Let's start with this morning
Why did she run from this room
Long beat
Then, Rachel looks dead on at Jackie
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking
'm sure that didn't upset her
Everyone in our family takes showers
was in there in him
The air is thick with tension
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards
No
thought it might be uncomfortable for her -- You mean for you
10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family
She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time
And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen
(turning away) This isn't going to work out
You're damn right
'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit
never said was Betty Fucking Crocker
If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead
have a life
Oh and  don't because  have a children
The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother
Maybe the problem is your kids Maybe they're spoiled, coddled brats Get out
(holding up Post Its) But it's not on the schedule
You got to hell
Jackie turns away, storming out of the room
Ah Ah Ah
You owe me a quarter -- - Luke stands in an apron before Annabelle's Girl Scout Troop, rolling out a large pie dough
They imitate his every move
Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust
And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more
what
Ice cold water
(adoringly) That's my girl
Rachel watches from a corner
Blueberry pie must be topped with vanilla Haagan Daz and/or creme fraiche
now the secret to a great creme fraiche is
Orange peel
which also is the secret to
French toast
Now don't forget to teach your fathers that
Next week
apple brown betty
He takes off his apron and walks toward Rachel as the girls file out
She said no
He doesn't even know what she's talking about
The editing machine
mean, Annabelle would have really loved it
She looks down
It would have been great for us, so obviously, Jackie just
Eyes down
Choosing her words
She's really a difficult person
Looks up
Best thing ever happened to you was her throwing you out on your butt
An afterthought
Not that  have a personal stake in it
He comes and kisses her
Get ready
To get really mad
Uh
Annabelle's video report has been switched again
Not yet
Hey,  sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo
We have the kids
Next weekend
And it's my call
promised them water-skiing, instead o
(quiet pain) Our weekend
At that sweet little &
He puts his arms around her
And the evil part is
am so stoked about the water-skiing
can't wait
He tastes her mouth
And again
sweet, hot moment
Her fingers trace up his neck
To his hair
No, this is good
Celibacy is healthy
For a guy your age
You'll get used to it
From the kiss that follows
He won't have to
'  - an
, , and
(
) Hi, it's the trophy bimbo
Annabelle's teacher called, and her video report is being moved up to 8:30 tomorrow
Sorry to deprive your step aerobics class of their role model
Pause
to see
(
) Anyway
'm sorry  lost my temper the other day
And 'm sure you are, too, so
, looming over the hardware
Fingers poised above the buttons, and he
(
) no, apology necessa
strikes
Playing all the keys at once
Like chords on a baby grand
- on a small  , the angelic face of 10-year-old , practicing for the Miss America Diplomatic Interview, circa 2009
Well, had a million dollars
would use it to
feed all the precious hungry children of the world
And bring about total world peace
to see the class and teacher watching raptly
Filmmaker Annabelle in the seat of honor next to her proud father
Rachel in the back of the room, anxiously looking at the back door
While on screen
another face
, bad as he wanna be
million big ones
Oh
'd buy about a thousand babes
Not to do anything bad,  mean
Just to hang with
Near the monitor, Annabelle's eyes are also furtively cutting to the classroom's back door
On screen now
the handsomest 10-year-old since DiCaprio
the Dreamboat
Stares soulfully at the camera
Murmurs
Well, first off, Annabelle
'd give half of it
To you
The class ,
Annabelle flushes, but she clearly likes it
Brad grins a Redford grin her way
And through the back door
a harried, disheveled
Still in workout clothes
As on screen
There you have it
Now ask yourself what would  do
The screen goes
The class, teacher and especially Luke with
So does Jackie, who has locked eyes across the room with her mortally-wounded abandoned daughter
Then Jackie's eyes
Rachel, a deer in headlights
Death by Army ants would be too kind
Annabelle, Luke and Jackie  at Rachel, who looks awkwardly at her feet
stream past, unaware of the gravity of the moment
Machines do not  message
Look,
Of all the cheap excuses
To break a child's heart
The jury is in
There is no appeal
Jackie takes her daughter's hand
Don't worry, sweetie, there's still the Harvest Pageant
And you are the lead vegetable
Said with bottomless pride
And nothing
And no one Can keep me away
One laser look at Luke
This bitch is your responsibility
And she leads her baby off
'  - parked , packed with  and ski gear
No people across the suburban lawn to
Luke, dejected, at Jackie's door
Rachel nearby, still peers into the window of an unlit, empty house
cellular phone
Luke  it out, like the Governor's pardon hangs in the balance
(
, from carphone) You paged us
(distraught) Where are you
throughout
Jackie on her cellular, herding the kids toward a
Just outside the big top, we're almo
You're
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top  know said 'd get 'em back tonight
Jackie, we were taking them water- skiing for the whole weekend
(innocent) until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets
What, Rachel
'forgot'  told her
Luke's eyes  to an uncomprehended Rachel
She's never seen him this angry
Don't tell me
Another machine ate another message
Boy, there's a lot of that going around
Put her on, huh
beat
He hands the phone to Rachel
She brings it to her ear
Yeh
Think twice
Before you ever pull that again
The line is dead
And so is Rachel
- glum Annabelle and Ben sitting on a bench watching Rachel at her photo shoot, George between them
beautiful  appears in the turret -- she lets down her hair -- a modern day  -- her golden locks fall 17 feet -- now a of yellow -- as a hundred   fly out from her mane beautiful  begins to  the hair
The man in mid air surrounded by canaries
Rachel works with intense concentration
It's been hours
Annabelle and Ben are completely bored
(to Cooper) The timing was off --  need this light
(to herself) Just where  wanna be all Saturd
(to everyone) Hold lunch
But we're hungry -- and  have to pick up my costume for the pageant
It starts at seven
It's only one o'clock
Why don't you get another Fudgesicle -- 'll be done soon -- really soon
Annabelle and Ben
Rolling their eyes
Annabelle asleep on the bench
Rachel stands over her, a canary on her finger
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty
Where's Ben
Is he in the bathroom
don't know
feel like 'm gonna throw up
' Annabelle stands with Rachel by a line of empty urinals
What if he's kidnapped
He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just --
Panicked, she grabs Annabelle's hand
Don't touch me
You bring bad luck
Rachel
Starting to believe it
- Breathless, Annabelle and Rachel  the castle stairs when they hear  -- Rachel follows the whimpering --  -- Ben
Ben we're here
In the corner of the tower we see  staring up at her
But Ben is  to be found
He's gone forever and 'm gonna miss the pageant
Rachel once more
Her life flashing before her eyes
,   - Jackie  up in the Volvo,  to a stop in a non-spot, into
- Jackie  through the police station moving down corridors past desks until she sees  sitting with   on a bench
She holds him to her chest, shaking
Ben
Oh my Ben
Are you alright
knew where  was all the time
- Ben sits between Jackie and Luke holding each of their hands
Rachel sits on the other side of Luke; all waiting for the Harvest Pageant to begin
It's horribly tense
(sincerely) Jackie
am so sorry about today really fucked up royalty
When you called Luke  was so goddamn relieved -- Luke elbows her with an "We're in an Elementary School" elbow
No  did --  know  did --  screwed up
feel like such an asshole
Jackie lifts Ben onto her lap, holding him tightly
She turns and faces Rachel, claws bared
Shhhhhh
The lights go down
They sit pretending the other is not there
On stage -- The class is dressed as the harvest
Annabelle is the
Each   steps forward and introduces itself
Annabelle rehearing her line over and over
"Hello
am Maze
But you can call me Corn
Hello
am
" Inside her costume, her breathing is sharp
She stands very straight, very bold
brazen ear of corn
She steps forward
"Hello
am
Rachel   next to the stage with her huge and giant flash
Her camera  three times, quickly
After each flash, we see the picture for a split second, Annabelle ear of corn
ear of corn
(blinks, disoriented) Um
'm
'm
Oh
In the audience, Jackie is willing her daughter a recovery
Sees instead, a completely  ear of corn
(exploding in tears) Oh forget it
She runs offstage amidst laughter and applause
Luke looks over at Jackie but she and Ben have already left their seats
- Jackie comforts Annabelle
Ben watches closely, getting caught up in his sister's sadness
Luke and Rachel approach
hate her
really hate her
There you are
(covering her face) Don't take my picture
She starts to cry
Ben's lip quivers, his eyes well up
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now
'm sorry  didn't mean to break your concentration
thought it would be a nice moment to rememb
don't ever want to remember this
approaches
They're taking a picture of the Produce, we need the Corn
'mon Annabelle
See
No one's laughing at you
Your friends want you to join them, Anna- belle
Corn is a very important part of the Harvest Produce
Now Ben, walk your sister over to the Yams
Ben takes Annabelle's hand
When they are gone
Jackie, if  thought for one moment
(lighting into Luke) You listen carefully because  am only going to say this once
That woman has nothing more to do with my children
Our children
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today
How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did
He could have been
But he hasn't
He wandered off know it's terrifying
can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens
Not to me
(soft, reasonable) Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes -- 'm not gonna wait around to see the next one
'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement
'm seeing a lawyer
Jackie stop
We promised we never go there
We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke
Why are you taking this out on him Rache, get out of th
(still to Jackie) You haven't done one goddam thing to make any of this easier
am not here to make it easier for you
These are my children
They don't want to be with you
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y
(poking Luke's chest) court order is gonna say that woman is never alone with my children
Ever again Do you  that
All of New Jersey heard that
On the silence that follows, she stalks off
The mother lion
Doing what she has to do
- Jackie and her children ride  side by side through a perfect Fall afternoon
Our riders look about alertly, as if patrolling enemy territory
Guinevere, Godiva,  sense enemy sol
don't want to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter how much  like chocolate
want to be a stud
In distance, a gaggle of
Jackie points these out to Ben, without missing a beat
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops fear for the women and the property values
'll ride ahead
Nelson, protect the Queen
And she canters off, blood in her eye
Alone now with his mom, Ben has something serious on his mind
Mommy
It's not Rachel's fault  ran away
(doesn't turn) No, that's your fault
It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority
Which means, the most important job
(thinks about this) Rachel's job is she works
Ben, mommies work too
They work very hard
Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working just don't get paid
Does Rachel make a lot of money
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money
think she's pretty, Mommy
Yes
if you like big hair
Mommy
What honey
If you want me to hate her  will
On Jackie
Stunned
Her lips part for an answer
But she hasn't got one
'  - Luke pacing around on the path through Jackie's front lawn
Jackie exits the house, alone
Stands on the porch
And they stare at each other
You know, you can come inside the house
He looks at the end of his rope
She walks down to him
(quietly) Did you see the lawyer
Oh
Well
Called him
We set an ap
(almost a whisper) Don't do this
So vulnerable
The air comes out of her
We see how much she still cares for this man
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war
But 'm doing this for their well-being
Partly
But partly, you're mad
Staring
At each other
You know the kids aren't really in danger
This is about Rachel, and you're right, 'm disappointed in her learning curve, and
Slugs Have faster learning curves
Trees , even
He takes a breath
(here it is) 'm afraid she's going to walk
And 'm supposed to care
He reaches out
Takes her hands
(softly) About me, yeh
Like  care about you
She looks in his eyes
Like you cared about me three years ago
He shrugs
Looks saddened by that
(softly) Hey
You kicked me out
And just this once
With all that's happened
Jackie needs to say
Maybe you should talk to your daughter, about why
She seems to have missed that part
Now he looks ashamed
And sorry from his heart
(softly) Forget  said that
He has to tell her
This thing with Rache
need this
don't want to lose her
And  will see to it that the kids don't suffer
Help me, huh
Help me
'd do it for you
Yes, he would
Despite everything, she knows that
One last chance, don't make me regret it
Her voice tried to be tough
But the tension showed through
or you will, too
last look
She walks slowly
Back toward the house
,   - The last cars are pulling away
No kids left, except the ones shooting hoops
Except
On the low brick ledge by the flag pole
Annabelle sits
Alone
Quietly freaking

Your paper went off during the procedure
Do you want the number
Jackie turns, suddenly focusing
Wait
what time is it
'  - Annabelle sits glumly, refusing to eat some chips from the bag in Rachel's hand
Rachel's voice is low, soothing
Dare we say, maternal
Hey, sea salt and vinegar, know this is your fave
Annabelle keeps her eyes down
This is more than a sulk
She seems fairly unglued
'mon, these are the Bomb,  prom
Now could she just

Rachel stares back
Eats a chip

The kid blinks
non-compute
Your mom had to
help a friend with this
emergency
And she called me
And we switched days
Then,  got stuck on my shoot, and
Rachel  to see  filling the doorway, Annabelle flying to her mother's arms
The women's eyes meet
How much did she hear
'  - Jackie brushing out Annabelle's hair
Jackie's eyes are distant
Annabelle watching in the mirror
Are you worried about your friend
With the emergency
Jackie's eyes come back to focus
Hmmn
Oh, 'm waiting on some news, that's all
Say
Can  ask you why you never asked me something you probably asked Daddy anyway
And she smiles
Real carefree
So Annabelle smiles back
You can try
More brushing
Gentler, slower strokes
Daddy was washing Rachel
In the shower
What did you think that was about
Sex
Of course
Oh
Well, not exactly s
Why does Rachel scream
Does she mean what Jackie thinks she means
Scream
During sex
Oh
Again
How would you know sh

In the same country
Her mother laughs
Encouraged
(imitating) Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh
why do you think
Because it feels really incredibly good
Jackie moves around
Leans to stare in her eyes
So why are you asking me
like talking about it
At least, to you
The look holds
Almost a bittersweet smile plays on Jackie's lips
She leans to kiss her daughter's head
(a murmur) Same here, huh
'  - -- Slowly an   -- Floating in a pool of water
It's a photo of a child's
Only the wrong shoe is on the wrong foot
Suddenly,
Hold on
Don't let the light
Jackie enters, leaving the door wide
in
'm sorry
Look, 'm not real comfortable being here, but
don't recall inviting you
Silence
overhead what you told Annabelle
The lie
Unreadable faces
What are they feeling
have a snoop
didn't need you to take the blame for me, 'm quite
(simply) didn't do it for you
Believe me
And Jackie
Finds that interesting
(shrugs) She already hates me
You've seen to that
You're not terribly good at taking care of h
need practice
Those are my children you're practicing on
They deserve first- rate care
Every minute
Of every night
And every day
More silence
So why did y
did it for her
Straight to her eyes
Poor kid has to believe in someone
Even if it's you
Nothing friendly about it
But Jackie hasn't come seeking friendship
have an appointment this after- noon
need someone to take them to the park
What
And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders
How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors
Hard looks
All around
However many
It's not enough
'm already on thin ice
Yesterday, actually thought my boss was going to fire me
Fine, forget it
But neither of them wants her to
Mexican Standoff
Until Jackie empties her huge purse on the counter
Bandaids for cuts
Bandaids for new shoe blisters
Packet of Wash n Dri's
Kleenex
Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms
Why not just bring the whole toilet
Ben likes to be read to
Do you know Dr
Seuss
Not personally
Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can  finish
This silences Rachel
Jackie hands her a Post It
Here's their schedule for this after- noon
'll meet you at the park at five
All  ask is that they're alive when  get there
beat
(dry) Thank you
And scoops up the parenting paraphernalia
(drier) Thank you
And walks out the door
- Jackie stands outside a door
Deciding
She knocks and enters
Duncan's office
He sits behind his desk, across from a client
Both men looking up at this stranger
Mr
Samuels
Forgive the intrusion, 'm Jacqueline Harrison, and
The sweetest smile she's got
Which is pretty good
well,  just wanted to thank you
For your generosity
(a beat) Gener
my daughter had a terrible emergency yesterday
My husband and couldn't be reached, and
your Ms
Kelly came to Annabelle's rescue
Confides
'd hate to think what might have happened
Shakes her hand
She told me that you were so suppor- tive, even at great inconvenience to your business, and
An amazing smile
It's wonderful to see a successful man
With that sense of priorities
(longer beat) Well
under the circumstances
If  can ever repay your kindness
It would be my great pleasure
Backing out the door
and your Ms
Kelly
remarkable young woman
The client is beaming
(clearing his throat) We think so
'  - on Jackie, looking down
She seems to be staring at something in her lap
(quiet anger) don't even know what that means
Spread
That is very unclear
but there is nothing there
Her lap is empty
Except for her unnaturally still hands
(
, gently) means we found some cells
In your lymph nodes
In three of them
The hands come together
Slowly, deliberately
Stating to anyone who would watch that there is no panic here
But the other time
You said you got it all
So you could be wrong again
One time, you say one thing, then
(
) The other time
Was a year ago
The air comes out of Jackie
In a thin, slow, precise stream
Everything, her very breath
Under complete control
(
) That was a tiny lump in the breast
We radiated, we thought we had it all
We were hopeful
But there were no guarantees
Silence
Jackie's eyes stay on her folded, still, hands
But we can beat it
to see the small, neatly kept office
is 50, slender, elegant, kind
The doctor you want when you're dying
Jackie looks up to her
People beat it, don't they
All the time
(straight) Every day
More and more
Jackie swallows
The confirmation of hope has allowed some of the fear to show
So we'll
radiate some more
At first
Then, after awhile, some chemo
blow
Jackie absorbs this
That's necessary, huh
Let's take our best shot
Jackie nods
Staring at the woman
Then, to break the spell
guess a no-hair day beats a bad-hair day
The doctor smiles
Jackie looks at her watch
have to get dressed
My ex-husband has asked me to dinner
God knows why, he was very mysteri
Have you still never told him
flash of the anger flickers
Why would his worry
Or my children's worry
Or anyone's worry
Help the sit
(very soft) Sooner than later
You really need to
That brings a silence
shading of defiance to Jackie's features
You don't burden others needlessly
That's how  was raised, Doctor
Hold the look
Maybe at dinner tonight
Think about it
'  - Jackie is getting dressed in front of the mirror, her eyes distant, in spite of her attempts at control
Annabelle is watching her like a hawk
We see Ben in the  -- sawing the in half
Why are you going to a French restaurant
Throughout, Annabelle is trying on Jackie's jewelry, making a pest of herself
Jackie fights against rising irritation
Because it's quiet
And he wants to talk
Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime
What are you gonna talk about
(applying mascara) Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system
The usual
Then why are you putting on mascara
(a beat) 'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates
Well Daddy and  are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara
Or blush
You look pale
- Country French place on the West Side
Classy, but inviting
- Jackie and Luke sit across from each other in the lovely restaurant
Jackie looks beautiful in the warm candlelight
Maybe you don't think three years is enough for a person to change but
things are different now Jackie
'm different
Jackie feels her heart beginning to race
They lock eyes for a moment
He unconsciously begins to eat off her plate
He eats her chicken, and in the dance they've done a thousand times -- she reaches for his uneaten vegetables
The  approaches
Would you and your wife prefer still or sparkling water
He doesn't correct the waiter
Still, please
(when the waiter leaves) Annabelle showed me the new dress
She's amazing in it
Getting so beautiful
she looks more like you every day
(Luke downs Jackie's wine) Jackie
've really given this a lot of thought
great deal of thought
Their eyes lock for a moment
Here it comes
'm gonna marry Rachel
know you don't think much of her but she's a special person -- she really is
And  love her
This is a bridge we never wanted to cross but it's not helping her or the kids if don't really commit to that
Jackie stares at him stonefaced
didn't think a phone call was appropriate
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago
The music sounds kind of the same from where 'm sitting
He shifts in his chair
Wants this to sound as authentic as he feels it
grew up, a little
'm ready for a life that's built around commitm
Just not to me
The waiter returns with a bottle of red wine
It's horribly quiet as he pours
Waits, obtrusively
Thank you, it's fine
Would you like to taste it
Can we please have less service, here
The waiter leaves, taking his attitude with him
Luke sighs
It's going to be hard for the kids when  tell them
'd like you to be there
To make it easier for them or you
It's a huge moment in their life -- You can't be an 'us' just when you want to
You can't play that card when it's convenient
We
are over
' still their parents for the next hundred years
On this, Jackie looks down at her hands
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us
We should tell them together
No
You think this is going to help the kids then you do it
You're on your own
'  '   - Jackie sits next to Luke on the couch -- looking lovingly towards the children, who sit across from them
Annabelle is taping this
The great thing about life is that things keep changing
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced
And we all went through that together
Ben
He knew it
-- Behind the video camera -- Where's this headed
Well things are going to change again
Ben  up from the couch and  into Jackie's arms
knew it
knew it
knew you guys were getting back together
Jackie looks at Luke
Annabelle   on their faces
No they're not
Annabelle put down that camera
She  in on his face
Put down that goddamn camera
You owe me a quarter
Look she's upset -- No 'm not
don't care
Why should care
mean nobody asked me when you got divorced
Nobody asked me if wanted a new mother
Nobody even asked me if  like her
If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh
Daddy and  tried hard
We really did
No you didn't
All you guys did was name call
heard you
You didn't even try and use your words
Ben runs out of the room
Luke follows him
'  - Ben pulls his cape over his head and hides in a bundle in the corner
'm disappearing
'm almost invisible
(holding him) 'll find you wherever you go
my magic boy
'm still your daddy
nothing will ever change that
- Jackie moves to Annabelle who won't put down the camera
Annabelle
Rachel's not taking my place as your mother -- it's just Daddy's chance to be happy again
Isn't that what we all want for each other
No answers
Jackie looks at this daughter she loves so much
Pats the seat beside her
Come
Sit
Something in the softening of the tone changes the atmosphere in the room
More real
More like equals
Life is full of hard things
And we can't always have what we want, you know that
Don't you
Annabelle nods, cautiously
But we do have a choice
To make it better
Instead of worse
Like how
Like seeing the good side of Rachel
So she'll see the good side of us
Annabelle's stare is hard and questioning
She didn't expect this
Because 'm looking ahead
And you know what  see
Annabelle doesn't
But she sure is listening
Time will come
When we all need to be there
For each other
Strokes her baby's hair
That happens
To families
(straight back) 'll be there for you
Her mother's eyes cloud with feeling
murmured
'm counting on it
'  '  - Barely any light in the empty kitchen
to see Ben, alone, in his cape
Carefully, he sets a cup of saucer atop a cloth napkin that lies across the butcher block table
He  the corners of the napkin
He looks scared
We get what's about to happen
As he
the napkin, as  as he can, the cup and saucer, and
stay put
Ben
Is astounded
And then he looks up
To a cabinet filled
With glassware and china
'  '  - Rachel's  as a beautiful   is slipped on her finger
She is asleep
Then, she
stirs, wakes
Stares at her hand in shock and delight
Oh my God
Are you serious
(tenderly) think so
What do you think
think so too
They hold each other for a long time
It's forever you know
(trying to read him) Okay
Is that the good thing or the bad thing
Because  can't hurt anyone like this ever again
She grins
How did you hurt someone
She threw you out, remember
He does
She hugs him tight
Everything's gonna work out
The kids and
we're going to love each other
Rache, it may take time
What's eight, ten years
Hell, you'll still be ambulatory
think
She's counting on her fingers
He kisses her
It's inevitable
Look,  was defensive,  was insecure
was afraid to love first
Her incredible smile
Filling even Luke with confidence
But 'm not anymore
sudden horrific  sound
The breakage of the breakable
Their look holds
'll get this
quick kiss
And she's gone
on Luke's light smile
Maybe this will all work out
'  - Ben is cuddled up in his coverlet
Almost as if he's hiding
She picks up some stray underpants
Actually, three of them
Are you real mad
How could  be
We learned some magic
She goes to his bed
Sits down
made all the pieces disappear
Oh
She leans toward him
And you learned
She kisses his forehead
Very sweetly
to make that trick disappear, huh
He nods
Big time
She stands, smiles
(softly) night
Of learning
They share the smile
And Rachel leaves, into the darkened hall
Down it now, only to
stop
Open a door, so quietly
Silently enter
'  - the room of a sleeping child
Rachel moves soundlessly to Annabelle's side
Stares down
Listens to the soft breathing
She straightens the covers slightly, in a maternal way
Then, on impulse, reaches down
tenderly smooths back a strand of hair
One last look
And she
leaves frame
on Annabelle, as we hear the knob turn
The door close
Alone, now
Annabelle opens her eyes
She is thinking
'  - Rachel dropping off Annabelle at Jackie's door
They must be late, because Rachel is looking anxiously at her watch
Not even noticing that Annabelle has pulled out a tube of  , turning the shaft to reveal a glittering golden-colored gloss
Then
Uh
Put that away, hon, your mom w
The door
Jackie is dressed for riding
(sincere) Sorry 'm late,  got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's
It's okay, it's twenty minutes
The horse'll be there
Rachel blinks
Is she on the right planet
Mom, look what Rache got me
Uh-oh
The kid holds it up
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, 'm way too young
It's just for play
See,
(taking it) That is so pretty
You usually only see that color in people's teeth
Annabelle has entered the house, to see on a table by the door a huge, brightly-wrapped
Wow
Who's that for
(quietly) Well
It's for you
The kid  around
Really
Just because
Just because  love you
Go ahead
Annabelle starts to unwrap the present with Christmas-morning-care
Jackie looks at the glitter gloss
'm sorry,  just
Hey
At least it's not an editing machine
No way
told her two, three years, maybe, for such an expens
And stops
Because the paper has come off
giant deluxe model beginner's
Annabelle is  silent
So's Rachel
(tears in her eyes) Oh, Mommy
And  into Jackie's arms,  her with the hug mothers live for
hope it's the right kind
Are you kidding It is so much better than the one Rachel showed me
Jackie strokes her baby's head
Well,  thought
You know, why wait
The child turns to Rachel, frozen in the doorwary
told you  was big enough
Is my mom the greatest, or what
Rachel swallows
The greatest
on the look
The women share
- Jackie and Annabelle riding
The kid is still on Cloud Nine
Jackie's eyes are on her
mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff
She's like still a kid, herself
Like a big sister
She knows every neat junk food place
Looks to see if her mom is okay hearing
Actually
She's kind of cool, when you get to know her
bet
Annabelle studies her mom's profile
And don't tell her  told you
Secret's safe with me
'   - Rachel sits cross-legged on the floor of the walk-in closet
Next to her, a glass and a botle of Stolie, getting toward the bottom
An ashtray filled with butts, and
a card board box
Dragged out of somewhere
Photo albums, loose snapshots
Vintage stuff
From her face, this is not a carefree romp down Memory Lane
She takes another hit on the Stolie
More than slightly intoxicated, weaving, squinting at
the next photo
Luke, young, straddling a Kawasaki
Jackie, just as young, holding him from behind
She wears a halter and shorts, and looks simply terrific
Rachel looks drunk and jealous
With an overlay of self-pity
Brings the photo closer
Squints harder
What the fuck is that
Her worst fears confirmed
a tattoo -   - The lights are coming on in The City
Jackie sits staring out the window, as an  drips into her arm
She is alone, and down
And fighting the fear of what may come to pass
Her pager goes
Jesus
She pulls a cell phone from her purse
Works it with one hand
Brings up
the smile
Showtime
(softly) Hey, good-lookin',  was just thinking about calling y
throughout:  Ben on the phone in Rachel's and Luke's kitchen
He is alone
Staring through the glass window of the oven
Rache says  have to eat lamb told her you're making me spaghetti Honey, this is Thursday
pick you up tomorrow, and we do big spaghetti
And many meatballs
nurse enters, and Jackie shoots her with a wave of her fingers
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, 'm flying them in from Sweden
Is that like Luigi's
She loves this kid so much
Not a lot, sweetie
It's a country
Like Canada
Only smaller
Where are you, anyway
And the feeling comes straight to her eyes
She can't fight it
'm somewhere, thinking of you
And meatballs
And you know what
Yes
Of course, you do
Being magic
Then you know 've got a flu bug, and  turn green and barf profusely when  even think about food
So, all the more meatballs for you
But you know what
did
Do  have to eat lamb
Daddy didn't cook it, she did
Do me a favor
Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay
Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup
He laughs
And she can hear that
And her eyes fill
And she murmurs
Hey, that's a world-class laugh you got there
Can  all you sometime
If  fell blue
silence
And for a heartbeat, the fear
Did he hear it in my voice
But no
Sure
You got my number
And now she's crying
But she can't
She can't
Gains control for a whispered
That  do
Always will
Mom
She sniffles

Tomorrow
Can  have one butterscotch pudding for dessert
See her relief
Secret still safe
Nope
He's crestfallen
We can only have two
- Jackie is pushing her cart
Ben sits in it, pulling things off the shelves
On automatic she's putting them back
Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel
Then when  see her do say hi Stepmommy
And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son
(lost in thought) Thursday's fine
Frustrated, Ben   of the cart and trails behind Jackie
He reaches for an apple off the  of a huge display of Red Delicious, and the whole thing comes
Shaken, she looks around for Ben
He's gone
'  - Jackie with a Store Manager and a Policeman stand at the front of the store near the Bakery
Jackie is totally distraught
looked away for one second
Just one second
he's
he's
How would you describe him
He's my son
He looks like his father
His name is Ben -- he answers to Harry -- Is he wearing a red shirt
The manager  to the frozen food bin
There, lying on his back atop dwindling stores of Breyer's ice cream
is Ben
Hands and beaming face  to the underside of the glass
Jackie does the only reasonable thing
and   Snow White's glass coffin
, Nope
got my warm t-shirt
Enough of a non-sequitur to make everybody blink, before Jackie him, roughly and tenderly, from the bin
She  him in a violent, desperate hug
You found me cause 'm your priority , huh
She kisses him fiercely
At the edge of tears
Whispers
You got that right
- 3 ' Luke coaching the girls team
Annabelle one of many who surround him for that final word of wisdom
Alright my Little Warriors, remain calm; trust that the ball will find you; remember they're your opponent not your enemies -- Not kick butt
In the bleachers, Jackie sits alone with Rachel
They are having a coaching session of their own
Rachel points down to the field, where
Annabelle pushes her hair over her eyes
She's gonna trip over her own feet, if she doesn't get her hair out of her eyes
Jackie casts a sidelong glance at Rachel
Decides to tell her
Pushing her hair over her eyes
Means she's avoiding a confrontation
Rachel looks over
Really
Jackie decides to share more
Reading Rachel's reaction to
If she's twirling it, she's playing something out in her mind
If she's stopped combing it, she might be depressed
As Rachel listens she's unconsciously twisting her hair
What about obsessively picking her split ends
Anxiety
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell -- She was angry at herself
Jackie
Yes
When  twisted hair like this it means 'm intimidated by you
Jackie gives her the trace of a smile
'll keep it in mind, and use it against you
She looks back down at the game
Rachel watching her profile
Finally
You feeling all right
(doesn't turn) Not great
Plus, 've got things on my mind
You know
Things
Rachel doesn't know
Blurts
Are you
seeing someone
Jackie snorts a laugh
In spite of herself
Yeh, that does tend to make me sick to my stomach
Actually, 'm, uh
Thinking
Deciding if this is the time to say
thinking of going back to Random House
On a part-time basis
Wowie
How wonderful
But Jackie still hasn't turned
Eyes glued to Annabelle, racing around with determination
Well,  could do most of it from home
But, while 'm working it out with the head editor, 'd need to
Sighs
Boy, this is tough
Tries for matter-of-fact
make some trips into the city
Sometimes, overnight
Hey, any help you need, we'll cover
Jackie nods
Appreciates that
But she still hasn't turned to look Rachel in the eye
Uh
Have you told Luke and the ki
Let's
hold up for a bit
It may not happen
Our secret, okay
little strange
Particularly the hardness of Jackie's eyes
Rachel watching her
Something's up
(softly) Sure, if you like
Jackie looks away now
To the playground just beyond the bleachers
Kids rise swings, clamber over a jungle gym
But her eyes are routinely, automatically, zeroing in on one single kid
who is climbing his way  a tall
Crouched over as he inches up the shiny metal surface, using the side rails
Rachel follows Jackie's eyes, just as
Ben reaches the top and  , hands  his head, Jackie's breath catching, Ben totters once and
fast, hitting the grass with a thump we can hear, lying crumpled, motionless, as our two women
up as one,  down the bleachers,  toward the playground, Jackie initially in the lead, but Rachel out- sprints her,   on the child, as he rolls over grasping his leg, and reaching him first
some instinct makes her hold back, let Jackie  past her, to kneel at Ben's side
She lifts her baby in her arms
His pants are torn, his leg is bleeding
His own concern
can still go to Tucker's party, right
- full house of walk-ins with assorted needs, none of which appear to require George Clooney on an urgent basis
Across the room, an irritated Jackie finishes the last of the paperwork at the nurses station
Exchanges a less-than-pleasantry with the less-than- helpful duty nurse, and
heads off through the crowd,  a hallway,  a corner, to see
stands by a doorway
Smiling, as he gazes into a hospital room
Jackie comes to his side, looks in
Ben doesn't see them
His back is turned, as he talks to Rachel, who sits on the side of his bed, feeding him the pudding she got from a vending machine
for Christmas, okay
Every magician needs a white dove, a real one, they do Well, that's a long way off, sweetie
We'll talk to Mom and Dad
Dad
You can talk him into anything
Unseen by the two, Luke grins
Then, Ben snuggles into Rachel's arms and kisses her
Jackie stares
(singing softly) 'In the still
still of the ni-ight
held you
held you so ti-ight'
take it, man
(singing softly) Doo-wop-doo-doo, doo -wop-doo-doo
Jackie stands there
Her eyes are difficult to read
But she sure is watching
(softly) Nice, huh
She steps back
Looks him in the eye
It is
It's about time
He give her a goofy give-me-a-break
She twists the corner of a smile
She's a charmer, you'll see
In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you
Stop
You're making me insecure
Now they're smiling at each other
In the old way
nice moment for them
You changed your hair
And we notice
It does look different
It's temporary
(grins) It's good
You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you
Her look holds
An odd extra beat
Not the term 'd use
He glances back through the doorway
You want us to take him tonight
Give you some private time with Annab
Never stand between that kid and a meatball
Yet another spaghetti night
Yeh, better  should forcefeed him burnt lamb and
couscous, was it she made him
Boy, kids go wild for that
She pats him on the shoulder
'll drop him at Tucker's party Saturday, if one of you guys can pick him up
have to go into the City
And breezes by him into the room
Ben wheels to see her
You know what happens to spaghetti when it waits around for you too long
He really thinks
Actually
No
Pray
We never find out
- door with balloons  -- , the birthday boy's mom, stands there -- children running behind her in party hats, all with their conservatively dressed
Rachel's attire a sharp contrast
Hi, 'm here to pick up Ben
Does Jackie know this
No
'm doing it behind her back
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties
Where is she
Something came up
'mon Ben
've got a shoot at three
Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer
Rachel eyes the    yet to be opened
-
Rachel, in a pointed party hat, sits schmushed on the couch in between all the other
black jeans stranger in a strange peach land
She eyes that mound of presents
Not even a dent
She pulls out her cell phone, moves towards the hallway
Hey Cooper
pull a number 64 steel blue gel on the back light
yeah 'm on my way but
piece of   through the air and  on Rachel
Now Ben, let Tucker play with his Batcave
Ben won't let go of Tucker's presents
Tucker tries to take it
Ben is adamant
Rachel reaches for him, tousling his hair
Hey Benjy boy -- chill
(he shimmies away from her) He's there already
No  don't want to talk to him -- Duncan
How are you
The mothers are all too aware of Rachel on the phone
Two kids shoot water guns -- Rachel gets drenched
Ben pulls at the toys
want it
Ben  know you're angry and confused but it's Tucker's birthday party
Ben and Tucker fight for it -- the mothers all
Ben -- (into phone) Duncan 'm aware of that - Goddamn it Ben
Let go of it
He stares at her
It looks like he's gonna let go -- On the mothers -- impressed, not to mention surprised
When Ben suddenly  the toy onto the floor
horrible falls over the room
Broken only by the sound of Duncan from inside the phone
Rachel
This is a big bloody account -- If you don't show up in five minutes
Rachel takes Ben and leads him into another room
Ben 'm sorry
It's been a hard day
Now would you do us both a favor and take this phone and
She  the phone
Hands it to Ben
make it disappear
Okay
He  it down the front of his pants
The peach moms are taken aback
Rachel nods, you got it
Delighted, Ben turns, scampers off, as
his pants start
He stops dead
Looks down at them
Still
He turns around and waddles delicately back to Rachel, as if he's carrying nitro in his shorts
She holds out her hand
Breaks out the geiger counter, the man is radio -active
He pulls the ringing phone from his pants
She grasps it without hesitation, while peach moms wince in disgust
it open
Get over it, Dunc
(stops) whoa, whoa, Annab
Listens
While everybody watches
Could it be, maybe
anywhere else
Like
another galaxy would be more convenient
Listening, listening
Everybody really watching
Even Ben
Rachel oblivious
(gently) Okay, don't cry
Flunking science is not happening
On my watch
'  - All the kids are running around crazily in a hypersugared frenzy
Peach moms drink diet sodas and chat
Rachel making a call by the phony little carp pond
just that her daughter left a science book somewhere at her house, and  need t

The East Side below her window
'm sorry, Ms
Harrison is not here

Twice
Rachel nodding
Well, she's been meeting with the head editor for the last few w
Miss, am Senior Editor
Ms
Harrison left Random House eleven years ago
We have not had the pleas- ure of a visit from her in that time
Rachel blinks
Actually, she's going back to work with your company on a part- time basis
Excuse me
If Jackie Harrison were coming back to the editorial staff, would be frankly delighted
And
Would be the first
To know
Silence
In the midst of hysterical children
Thank you for your time
Don't mention it
And Rachel's line
Is dead
'  - Rachel alone at Jackie's front door
Staring at the key in her hand
One last chance to back out
(mutters) What the hell
the door
Enters the empty home
Walks slowly, self- consciously, down the hallway
Kitchen, kids' rooms
Now, if  were a science book, where would
And stops
At the doorway of the master bedroom
Who am  kidding
And goes straight to Jackie's desk
Starts rummaging through the incredibly neat stack of papers
Great, 'm leaving prints
The open appointment book
Today's date
Just says,
Nothing more
Opens a drawer
Stapler, clips, neatly-stacked stationery
Opens the bottom drawer, and
stops
She pulls out
Opens the folder
Continental Airlines
Newark to San Francisco
And tucked inside
a fax, neatly folded
Rachel opens it
The letterhead says, , 134 Sutter Street, San Francisco, California
, Editor
(reads) Jackie
Can't wait to see you here
know you're anxious
But it's going to work out wonderfully,  promise
Til then
Charlie
on Rachel
Trying to put this together
'  - Jackie takes a kettle from the stove
Pours the water into a tea cup
Then, fills a second cup
Drops a tea bag into each
Carries both cups to
the kitchen table
Where Rachel is waiting
She looks more than tense
Actually, scared
Jackie taking this in, as she sets down the tea
Okay, what is this
If you want to dump Luke on me, no sale
You're stuck with him
And before she can sit
know your secret
Jackie
To stone
No one says anything
Two hearts beating at red-line
don't know wh
was looking for Annabelle's book, and  found your tickets
And the note
From your new boss
My what
Jackie leans forward
Her hands resting on the back of the chair she never sat in
My boss
You're not working at Random House, talked to them
You
You're taking the kids
And moving to San Francisco
And Jackie has to laugh
Cold
Bitter
Look, you've never liked me
Don't flatter yourself
And  know checking into your life was inexcusable
Nobody likes a snoop
But  came here to
All the air comes out of this young woman
so vulnerable, so real
to beg you
Not to do it
And at this
look of intense interest crosses Jackie's face
Really
'd have thought this was the answer to your prayers
Lose the witch, and her two brats, in one swoop
Problems solved
Rachel is clearly distraught
This is no act
You can't take Luke's children away from him
Jackie thinking
Reading this girl's face
Bi-coastal parenting
Happens every day
Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and
(blurts) We can't live like that
And Jackie straightens
Cocks her head
Did  hear the word
Luke
Can't live like that
Ah
Then let him talks to me
We don't need you to solve our prob
(quietly) it's my problem, too
And Rachel's eyes
Fill with tears
She hates that
Jackie won't take her off the hook
Stands waiting, until
got used to
thinking of them
As
my kids too
Really
By what right
Six months of part-time screw-ups
Rachel lifts her chin
Defiant and tender at once
No right at all
just love them
Now it's Jackie's eyes
That begin to fill
And she hates that even more
(pleading) There's so many publishing houses in New York
Surely, you could find a good one
Jackie takes a step back
Shakes her head
Goddammit, life is full of surprises
She walks around in a little circle
Turns back
Sure,  could
If  was looking for one
Rachel's turn to be surprised
Confused
You're a moron, kid
You guessed the wrong secret
An odd, almost defiant look
Jackie reaches up to her own head, and
slowly, holding eye contact all the way, she slips the wig from her head
Her scalp covered by the partial regrowth that chemo- therapy has left her
You can hear Rachel's  clear to Kansas
(calmly) Charlie Drummond used to be a colleague at Random House
'm crashing at her place, while  take some new protein injections my oncologist recommended
can only get them in San Francisco
Rachel's lips part
But no sound comes
Life's a trade-off
You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you do get to smoke dope
(please) You're not dying
The kid so painfully sincere
No such luck
'm beating the shit out of this
Pardon my French
Rachel can't find her breath
She is clearly the worse off of the two, in this moment
Then she starts to nod
You bet you are
How the hell would you know
don't, but
How would you know anything That was sharp
Rachel startles slightly
exercise,  eat the healthiest foods, you live on pork rinds and Ho-Ho's, and 've got cancer
That leaves a silence
And cigarettes
smoke, too
You are marrying the greatest guy who walks this earth Who  have loved from my heart for twelve years Listening
And you walk in
You smile that smile
You move that boy
And he's yours for free
She sags back against the counter
And you
Love my kids
How fucking touching
Comes forward
Stalks her
They came out of my body See,  know that
have given them more love and more care every fifteen minutes of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty years Leans over the table
Rachel looks scared to death
Okay, 'm undeserving
Ironic, huh
And staring in Rachel's eyes, Jackie's fierceness fades
Ironic, that 'm gonna need you
All the air comes out
Her heart as naked as her skull
To be a little less
Undeserving
The look holds
And holds
(quietly) Drink your tea while  go vomit
And turns, goes to the door
Turns back
You love my kids, that's a start
(nods) We'll work on it
And gone
Hear her footsteps
Climbing stairs
Rachel lifts her cup
Looks at it
(calling out) This is very good tea
Then tastes it
Makes a face
- graceful stone building with arched windows
Gas lanterns on the exterior wall and burning dimly inside
Stone gargoyles smile down on those who enter the heavy, bright red wooden door
- Drinks hour
Upscale crowd
Dim lights, clink of glasses, the hum of private conversations side-by-side
Civilized as hell
And at the deuce by the window
the man's head is down
We can't see Luke's expression, as he stares at his clenched hands
We don't need to
thought a phone call was inappropriate
No one smiles at the irony
Not much to smile about
could have taken you to that restaurant, but it would have been a waste of money
He loos up
She studies the pain
(softly) know
wouldn't know what to say
If it were you
We're going to win this
(straight back) Walk in the park
And thanks for the 'we'
Tears fill his eyes
None in hers
You're not alone in this
You're not alone
Jesus, you're not alone, okay
Jackie swallows
Tries a smile that doesn't get halfway there
Looks down
What happens next
live or  die
Looks straight in his eyes
We don't need the bullshit
Not us
Tell the kids together
She thinks
barely perceptible nod
Want Rache someplace else
On that one
She has to smile
My compliments
On your learning curve
'  - Jackie carrying two steaming  from her stove
These have marshmallows floating in them
She sets them down in front of her children
Ben starts plucking the marshmallows out of Annabelle's mug
Annabelle doesn't care, too busy video taping
her father
Who sits with this tender, compassionate, and therefore rather ominous smile
Doesn't take a smart kid like his daughter to guess
So what's up
Who's marrying who this time
Mommy's marrying Rache
He's happy
Jackie reaches and shuts  Annabelle's camera
And the directness in her gaze keeps the child from complaining
(simply) Mommy's sick, guys
You have the  flu since
have cancer
Do you know what that is
He doesn't
Someone else does
real quiet) It's what Grammy Lil died from
Ben's eyes   to his sister
He sees the cold fear in her face
to Mom
She seems fine, calm, smiling even
Grammy had a different kind
There are lots of kinds
Hers was very bad
Is your bad
Shut up
She's going to die
But the anger in her eyes isn't for Ben
She is glaring
At her mom
Actually, 'm getting better already
Straight
As if to an equal, an adult
had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller
lot smaller
Annabelle cuts him an angry look
He's on her shit list, too
So you're okay
'm still sick, but 'm better
You lied to us when you never told us
Ben hadn't thought of that
Nods now, yeh
That's right
And you're mad
Annabelle just glares with all the hatred she can turn her fear into
know how scared get when you're sick
So  waited to tell you
Until it was getting smaller
thought that was best, maybe was wr
You lied
If you lied then maybe you're lying now can never belive you again Annabelle, never say 'nev
' But Jackie's raised her hand
Jump back, Jack
The eye contact with her daughter never breaks
We make mistakes
And we forgive each other
Because we love each other, very m
Where's Rache
It's Thursday we get to be with Rache (the diplomat) 'd rather be with Mommy
She's dying and Rache is your mother now
She jumps up from the table
at her brother
You are so
And she , halfway to the door
She turns,  at the anger in that
You do  run out on your moth
' '   , And  from the room
In the silence she's left behind
Annabelle's worse than everybody
'  - Rachel and Luke cuddled in bed, watching a video in the darkness
At least, she is
Just now, he's watching her
Well,  think you should tell him you changed your mi
(softly) It's no biggie
She's still watching
It's a French-language comedy
She can feel his eyes on her
Never turns
It's just an assignment
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it
Are you hungry
You could make us something
She's still never looked at him
He can see she's getting irritat- ed
He says nothing
It's two solid months, around the clock, Jackie needs some cover- age, you're in a trial, what are we talking about
There'll be other assignments
He kisses her hair and flinches slightly
Tries to pretend it's because she's concentrating on the movie
They're my kids
Great, wallow in guilt, you sure you're not Jewish
long beat
He snuggles closer
They watch together
She's not gonna die
know that
'  - Jackie and Ben cuddled in bed, watching a video in the darkened room
It is not a French Comedy
They are, however, eating popcorn
The door opens
Annabelle stands motionless, composed
Her face looks like she's been crying
She clears her throat
'm sorry you're sick
From across the room
Jackie stares at her
can't hear you
Jackie cups her hand to her ear
Shakes her head, can't hear a thing
Waves, come on over
And slowly
Annabelle does
Crawls up into the bed, on the opposite side from Ben
Into her mother's arms
Jackie kisses her head, strong
Big smile
said
'm not deaf, y'know
They grin at each other
Like equals
Jackie picks up the remote, cuts  the sound
And when Ben turns to her
(singing) In the still
still of the ni-ight
held you
held you so ti-ight
That's Rache's song
Sugar
was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born
Wow
Really
You bet
Annabelle chuckles
You think she's the Queen of Cool
Jackie shakes her head
Pulls down the covers, pulls up her t-shirt
Does she have a tattoo
The butterfly
Just below her navel
Ben has seen this before, of course
Touches it, with his small hand
He wouldn't know
saw her in the shower
And
Ben looks to his sister
For the verdict
Annabelle shakes her head
Nope
She is only the Princess of Cool
Mommy is the Queen
She is but an arriviste
new word, apparently
newcomer
She's still got a thing or two to learn
Annabelle nods
You betcha
(resumes singing) held you
held you so ti-ight
(to Annabelle) You sing lead, you've got the voice
She bumps head gently with Ben
The stud and  will doo-wop
And as they doo-wop the back-up

Let you go

- Parents streaming slowly in for a  night
They are chatty, tired, preoccupied
And 95% female
- Folding chairs set in rows
Parents taking their seats with coffee and cookies
Up front, a table where a panel of speakers are beginning to gather
faded banner says  --
Jackie is nibbling at a single cookie, when
a figure slips into the seat beside her
Rachel is juggling a coffee and maybe nine cookies
Drops one
Picks it up
Dusts it off
Jackie is repelled, but has to smile
Small world
Luke's depo ran late
promised 'd take notes
To prove it, she balances the cookies on her thighs, and produces a notebook
Looks around, and in a conspiratorial near-whisper
So  have to tell you something in confidence
You're a cross-dresser
That
And
Annabelle is over her head
With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky
Does a Groucho eyebrow move
She hasn't mentioned this
She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it
Jackie is hurt
Covers
Moi
Toi
They've been 'going out' for two weeks
Rachel breathless and happy
Jackie attentive
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit
They don't actually go to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're
going out, yeh
had kids of my own, once
Anyway
He walks up to her on lunch yard today
And tells her
publicly
that they're 'breaking up
' Jackie's mouth drops
Oh, my God
Right
Which is the whole point of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date
She's devastated
Doesn't begin to describe it
mean, you've got cancer, this is serious
Rachel  Jackie's arm
She spent an hour in the girls' bath- room, crying with eight of her closest friends, who are sending the message to every boy in the grade that Brad Kovitsky is yesterday's toast Devours an entire cookie in one gulp
So here's the point
pick her up from soccer, she tells me the whole mess, and asks me what to do
How about that
And you said
Beats me
Ask your mom
Oh
So she's gonna
Tomorrow
Leans closer

Don't fuck this up

They are cracking the shells gently, and carefully peeling them

No, but  thought till Thursday

Flannery is twisted

(thinking it over) Actually
could only help him
Every time 'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded dorkface little adoring out-crowd henchmen You don't like his friends
they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some really clever cut like that
Like it hurts my feelings
They keep peeling eggs
You wouldn't kiss him, huh
Not with my mouth open
(softly) Good girl
Annabelle's eyes well up
She covers by concentrating all the harder
And what do you do wh
call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame
You have to ignore him
And on this
Annabelle looks up
He's not even there
You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys
This is a joke, right
Jackie shakes her head
Nope
All he wants is the attention
When he can't get to you, he'll try harder for a little while
Then, he'll give up
It'll be no fun
The kid blinks
You think Rache would do that
Takes Mom back a bit
Enough for her daughter to notice
It's just she's younger
Maybe she remembers how to do this
Jackie shrugs
Maybe
Annabelle studies her
This'll work, huh
Oh, yeh
Annabelle takes heart from her mom's confidence
Nods, with her trademark determination
How many devilled eggs can you eat
Maybe twenty

That's right, Ben
That's why Firemen have giant ladders and climb up and down poles
They're like
messengers
carrier pigeons
between heaven and earth
That's good cause we need to hurry
My mom doesn't have very much time left
Then you know what we should do
We should go to the Fire Station together and ring the firebell to get God's attention
Cause it's an emergency
Ben opens his arms, teeters, and Jessica  him
She reaches him out, and
him to Jackie, alone in the cherry-picker
Jackie Ben, pulling him  to her arms in a death grip
From down below, the kids
The worst is over
on Jackie, clutching her baby for dear life
Knowing it isn't
'  - Jackie stands in the doorway watching her son -- her baby boy -- sleeping
She looks drawn, but even if her body would let her sleep she couldn't
(a whisper) God
will do anything
will go through any amount of pain you give me
If you'll just let me see them grow up
slow ragged breath
Is that asking so damn much
She leaves the room soundlessly
Ben stirs
'  - Annabelle sleeps soundly in the glow of a night light
Jackie appears, leaning down to rouse her gently
Annabelle
wake up honey
(sleepy) Mom
What's wrong
Nothing sweetheart
Jackie sits on the edge of the bed, stroking Annabelle's head
got Ginny Weintraub to come stay with Ben
Annabelle's puzzled look
Why would you do that
How'd you like to go someplace special with me
Right now
- The light of the full moon illuminates the night and we see Jackie and Annabelle sitting on a horse
Annabelle in front, Jackie with a strong hold on her
Both have their nightgowns tucked into their jeans, coats over them
Hold tight, sweetheart
She  the horse forward and they   toward the rolling hills in the distance
Jackie and Annabelle ride faster and faster along the trail
Jackie has one arm firmly around Annabelle's waist and controls the horse with the other
Jackie closes her eyes for a moment, allowing the wind to wash over her
The smells and sounds of the night seem to free her, give her strength
Annabelle relaxes against her mother and giggles with delight
Jackie soon joins her, and the sounds of their laughter break the silence of the night
They come to a stop at the crest of a small hill and we now see the tears on Jackie's face
Annabelle can't see, and stares out at the moonlit valley before them
'm never, never going to forget this
Annabelle snuggles back
Happy
Never say never
Jackie kisses the top of her baby's head
You're old enough to learn the loophole
You can say 'never, never'
If you mean it enough
To say it twice
Annabelle yawns
So content in her mother's arms
'll remember
Always, always
So Jackie grips a little tighter
Breathes a single word, just loud enough to hear
Promise
'  - Rachel and Luke heading up the path to Jackie's door
It is early winter
Stark trees, a light snow on the ground
Rachel pulls her coat tighter around her
'   - Ben rumbling down the hall to the door
Stands in front of it, as the bell  again
(
) '  ,  , So he does
Gives her a sweet hug
(
) Hey
Remember me
He enters behind her
his body in the air
(John Wayne) Listen up
That's a pretty big love you're givin' my best girl, pard
(Clint) Listen sideways
love her and you love her
Now what are we gonna do about it
They follow Rachel down the hall
(Mister Rogers) We'll share
Like good neighbors
They enter the living room
Annabelle sits sullenly in front of the
Her overnight duffle and book bag and coat piled beside her
Hey, gorgeous, where's Big Mama
No answer
Annabelle worried about something
She still packing for her trip
killed my math quiz, -minus
They slap
Go through the ritual of a three-step black guy handshake
And
other things
At school
Annabelle cuts a look in Luke and Ben's direction
Please not in front of the menfolk
We'll talk
'll go check on Mom
Annabelle frowns at Mom's name
Rachel strokes her
Heads down the hall
Knocks at the open door to Jackie's bedroom, where Jackie is calmly, meticulously, laying out things beside her large open suitcase
She waves Rachel in, and keeps working
(checking out the stuff) It's gonna be cool, huh
Bulky sweaters
Wool things
can never figure weather
Last trip,  made all the wrong choices
Rachel and we have a better angle now
Jackie looks awful
Drawn, weak, masking pain with obvious courage
Bad day
Rachel sits on the edge of the bed
Jackie turns away, goes to her open chest of drawers
Can't complain
Even her voice is carefully under control
Awkward, Rachel looks around the room
stack of photo albums, scrapbooks, open
Works in progress
Can  look at the pictures
It's a mess, right now
That's my project when  get back
So quiet, we can hear a clock  nearby
Rachel's gaze returns to the bulky sweaters
Holds there
See, 'm not going to Houston, after all
Like you obviously figured out
There's this clinic in Montreal
We've studied their process, we like their success rate
Two women nodding, in a calm, matter-of-fact way
As if discussing recipes
They combine some compounds that have been getting results in France, with vitamin injections
Seems to activate the chemo
Silence
So
Hopeful
It's promising, this one
We're upbeat
Rachel swallows
She's out of words
really look like shit
You look sick
But you look
together
Mentally tough
Yeh, that's bull
'm going for serene, they say some actually get there
shrug
The first bitterness to seep through
Prob'ly low percentage on mothers
She sits, unceremoniously, right on the floor
Pantomimes a smoke
Rachel goes into her bag
You try to center on the big issues, y'know
What it's all about
What this whole trip has meant
But then, the really big issues keep swamping y
Brad Kovitsky
Tosses Jackie a pack
Matches next
You don't have any pot,  s'pose
Rachel's eyebrows head north
The primo stuff is great for pain
think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms
' Jackie lighting up
Deep soulful drag
So
She ignores this little Kovitsky punk, takes the high moral ground
Reading Rachel's face
Who is already wincing
(yeh) He's relentless major asshole
(nodding) And you said
What else
Keep on keepin' on
Oh
Rachel tries to hide her disappointment
She has to stick with it
Have the patience, the guts, to ignore the pain
You disagree
Half a beat
Rachel shakes her head, nope
(softly) Hey
You oughta know
'  - Luke sits with Ben, building a gigantic magic castle from a million Leggos
's architecturally interesting
Through the window behind them, a cold winter rain
(
) God, sorry 'm so late
She is entering, peeling off her jacket
Tired as hell
Duncan is doing his Himmler imitation on this gig
got yelled at for quitting at eight Under Luke's patient exterior, the stress is showing
As Ben watches, he replaces a key piece of the turret
Yeh, well, 'll be up all night on this brief
And then
He shoots her a really sorry look
've got a morning plane to Boston for the depo
Back Sunday night
Wow
They lock eyes in the bond of 'what are we gonna do
' No problem
made that paella you liked
It's on the stove
She kisses Ben's head, Luke's mouth, that one lingering a little
Then, down the hall to
the kitchen
Annabelle sits with her homework stacked, untouched
Staring out the dark window
Clearly, this is worse than death
Lemme guess
bad hair day
Annabelle  like a hunted animal
She told me to keep ignoring him
So did it
Not a good result, huh
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me now In front of the whole world Frosty, the Snow Bitch
That's so weak
Here's weak Mom said she was gonna talk to the teacher and Brad's parents Can you believe the humiliation Honey, she won't d
told her if she pulled that 'd kill myself, and she could go to my funeral for a change
For a change
That's where this is coming from
Rachel reaches her arms around her
(murmurs) Hey
Hey
've personally never gone to a funeral
And 'm not starting anytime soon
The phone begins to

Keep
Rachel checks her watch
Shit

Lifts the phone on the sixth ring

At the window of her room, rain pouring down on Montreal

'  - Annabelle lies on her bed in darkness
Clutching her pillow
Lights streams in as Rachel enters
Sits on the bed, next to this furious child
Puts the cordless phone by the pillow
Annabelle,  know you miss your mother
So why don't you say hello
Why don't you say hello
Annabelle pick up the phone
Annabelle pick up the phone
That doesn't bother me
That doesn't bother me
You think this is funny
You think this is funny
No
think it's ugly

You think that means you can step on me

No smile at all
You know when girls grow into women
When they have to
And this is your moment, kid
Ready or not

She needs you, right now
She needs you to be big
To put the kid aside, and help her get well
Now
Fucking
Do it
the phone
Hands it to her
(tears on her face) Hi, Mom
How are you feeling
As Rachel leaves, silently, we
throughout:  Jackie at her clinic window
Cellular at her ear
Darling, 've been thinking about our little Brad problem
And think it's time we move to Plan
You cannot believe what he said, it was the worst instant of my total life on Earth know
know how rough life can be
And how unfair
So here's what we do
Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk straight up to that little jerk
And bring my knees up, real hard, yeh
No, that never solves anything
You talk like the big girl you are
About what you feel
And how he's hurt you
You know
You tell the truth
Nodding to herself
Knows this is right
You use your words
- An actual   filled with  of animals, cats, rabbits, dogs, two horses peeking out a window, peacocks
Noah's Subway, so to speak
Duncan and his client watch as Cooper assists Rachel, who the menagerie from low
At last, she lowers her camera
Check her watch
Shoots Cooper a knowing look
And   the camera
to her subjects
love you guys
You're animals
And starts   down the tunnel
Duncan looks at his watch, then  up,  after Rachel,  her arm, her around, he faces
someone ready for this
It's 1:45,  told you there's no one to pick up Annab
But you're not done She licks her lips
Stands her ground
've got it
It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th
We don't  if you've got it, we haven't  it yet
Now go back and
Her glare says do  fuck with me
The mother lion look we've seen on Jackie
Which part of no don't you understand
Look,  will send a
to pick up the children
There are agencies that supply sitters, nannies
They're losing one mother
They can't lose two
The bottom line
He looks as freaked as she is determined
You're making a career decision here,  would strongly sugg
Duncan
've got an even better idea
She leans forward
In his face
So she barely has to murmur
Quit
beat
You can't do that,  won't let you
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to keep not a job that's hard to lose , can't be both
Rachel, don't do this, you will never forgive yourself
She thinks that over
For half a second
Actually
just did
And without further fond farewell
She is gone
,   - The last cars are pulling away
Some kids are still playing sports
And sitting on the ledge by the flag pole
two children
The little boy is reading his Garfield book for the three hundredth time
His big sister is simply crying, openly, for a disinterested world to see
car  up
The driver out the door,  to us
Then crouches slowly
At Annabelle's feet
Oh, baby, 'm so sor
' Rachel is dying inside
Reaches to brush at Annabelle's tears, but the child  her head away
Ben, go sit in my car right now, and  will bribe you big time
Excited, he runs off
did what she said used my words, told him what felt and they
laughed, yeh
They laughed real hard
Annabelle nodding , gulping back tears
That's because men can be scum, your precious father excepted, may you live to find one like him, it is damn hard
And wraps her arms around the girl
(looking around) Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, 'm gonna rip his fucking heart out
No, his mother's always on time
Great
And Mom says anger never, never solves anything
It makes every- thing worse That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than  will ever be
Now, just this once
Just this once
If  tell you what to do
Can we cut a deal
Annabelle stops crying
This is what she has prayed for
Tomorrow is Friday, your mom comes home
You tell her you did what she said
It didn't work yet
But you're gonna talk to Brad again on Monday
Leans close
And you don't tell her
What you're going to say
Not use my words, please
(smile) No, baby
You're gonna use my words
The sun dawns
On a child's face
Rachel brushes the tears away
They won't need them anymore
Okay, let's start with looks know he's handsome, but the best- looking people are so vain, there's always something they're insecure about
Annabelle shakes her head
Nothing
Does he have zitz
We can call him Pizza Face
Nope
None
Help me here
Uh
He thinks his nose is too big
But it's not
Great
Big ears, too
No
But they stand out, a little
Like this
Shows how
Done
He's a dead man
Rachel stands up
Walks in circle, thinking
Comes back
Strikes a pose
Monday lunch, you walk up with attitude , you hear me
Finger  out
(as Annabelle) Hey, Ear Boy
(does the ears) Listen up, Rhino Face, because 'm saying this one time
So your pathetic, no-life, ass-kissing little groupies here, better take notes Annabelle is swooning with joy
(as Annabelle) dumped you , limp dick, when got a peek at your deformed unit which is sadly microscopic Annabelle laughing, applauding
(as Annabelle) As for your pitiful knowledge of sex 'm not wasting my time with some loser who doesn't even know what snowballing is
Annabelle raises her hand
Uh
What is it
Oh
It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie 'd never let you go to
But it's real
Does he have an older brother
In high school
He'll be impressed
The clincher is, you walk away, then whip around
Like this
The guy see is in the eighth grade at Prep School, and he laughs his ass off every time we talk about you
But Rache
suitable boy, will be at this flagpole, on Monday, with a very expensive bike, and he will be a stone  if  have to call an escort service
The kid
Is breathless
Now let's go stuff you full of junk food
Wraps an arm around her
've had the worst day
Till now
- Arriving  are filling through the gate
Last, is a female ,  a gray-faced Jackie in a collapsible wheelchair
The woman leans to her
We'll get your bags, and the taxis are just
Jackie  the wheel,  them
Stares, frozen, as across the way
three faces stare back
(sheepish) Surprise
And Jackie  out of the wheelchair,  across the distance, runs to  her babies in her arms
It's a miracle
can walk
Annabelle laughs
Ben covers Jackie with kisses
Rachel watches
From the crowd
'  - Rachel carrying the suitcase, Jackie has each kid by the hand, as they troop through the house to arrive at
Jackie's bedroom
Where Jackie freezes
Her mouth
For Rachel has
striking black and white  of the children all the room
One is of Ben's , left shoe on right foot and vice- versa
Another glimpses Annabelle's beautiful  hidden in her hair
Ben sitting in a cupboard
Annabelle a bold ear of corn
Ben sitting on the bottom limb of the huge evergreen
Annabelle kissing her horse's muzzle
Jackie just stands
Trying not to cry
Okay
These are good
helped
She know he did
Looks across the room at Rachel
No more words
Let's go to the park
Jackie sighs
Smiles down at him
've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie
And 'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar
Rache can do that part
Jackie absorbs that
And all it portends
(softly) Hon, maybe your mom would like t
go to the park
In the worst way
Silence
(grins) Well, with Rachel driving
That's how we'll go
- five swings in use
In four, the kids are pushed by moms or nannies
In the fifth, Ben is pushed by Annabelle
Guess who's going the highest
to
two women on a bench
Under a starkly bare tree
Jackie is drinking in the air, the cold, the day
Rachel watching that
Serene
You're getting the hang of it
Jackie doesn't answer for a beat
Almost as if she hasn't heard
Serene means you accept
Shakes her head
Part of me hasn't quit yet
And the other part is still pretty outraged
(calmly) When it's not terrified
Watching the world of moms and kids
Who are not terrified
'm thinking
Do  know you well enough to really chew you out
No
Jackie turns to her
Diamond laser glare
Have you lost your mind You fought years for that job
And you quit Oh
That
It's just not the right time t
Do what you've worked your whole life to do
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others
You mean, after 'm dead
Do you
Hey, you haven't quit on you, 'm sure as hell not gonna
just mean, 'm juggling a lot right n
Juggle it
Move the darkroom into your house
You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway
Don't lose your confidence
Don't lose your edge
It's the same choice you made
Yes
made the choice that was right for me
And  don't regret it
But even for me, there were days when  felt so lost, so invis- ible
And then 'd hate myself for the kids not being enough
Reading Rachel's face
(softer) know you, huh
The car pools, he measles, the
It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run
You have to think long term
just want to spend time with them when 'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or
That's motherhood
That's the job, with or without a career
'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness
They need you to be happy
Can you hear me
Cause if you're not, the easiest person to  blame is the guy sleeping next to you
And you'll push him away, and then hate him even more when he goes, until finally you have no choice but to leave
And that can't happen
Rachel's turn to wonder
She starts to say something, thinks better of it
Asks instead
That's the bottom line, isn't it
can't make a mistake
Because it'll screw your kids
Glances over
My advice to you
Don't die
Feeling the pressure
Rachel's eyes move across Jackie's face
Then, out to Ben, on the distant swings
Last time pushed him
He said, 'Higher, Rache
It makes my penis sting
' Thin smile
Now it's Jackie watching Rachel's profile
'm gonna buy him that white dove for Christmas
If  don't, you'll get him a fucking eagle
Jackie keeps watching her
And in a quiet voice
Ben was born in two hours, went right to my breast and camped there for three days
Always with this
mischievous look
Watches Rachel nodding, absorbing
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that
He loves to hear that story, over and over
How he was born a magician
(softly, never turning) And her
Took 28 hours
She just wasn't sure about entering this world
Watches the feeling well in Rachel's eyes
The doctor wanted to go in and get her, but  knew she'd come in her own time
Rachel nods
It fits
That's who she is
Don't let anybody rush her
Silence
murmur
'll keep that in mind
Rachel settles back
Her eyes now locked away somewhere private
(quietly) What
Rache smiles
That Jackie sensed something
It's not about the kids
Looks over
Decides whether to ask
That thing you said before
Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away
Because of what you gave up for motherhood
Is that what he told you
He won't discuss it
Just calls it history
trace of edge to Jackie's smile
But no real anger
Well, he got that part right
Looking
Looking
So what's the part he got wrong
An urgency in that
got all day
- Luke and his bulky briefcase, coming down the stone steps two at a time, until
he sees her
In her winter coat
Smoking as if it could keep her warm
And despite her tension, he grins, heads over
What a great surpri
Hold your applause
We're not having fun, here
And from her face
She means every word
(concerned) Is Jack okay
Great
Just what she wants to hear
Oh yeh, she was cracking me up
Dishing details of her sordid little divorce
Ah
beat
To assess the damage
And you freaked
little
Hey
Just like to make sure
That your past
And my future
Are real different
(quietly) Well, they will be
(hard and low) Imagine my relief
So what's for dinner
He sighs
Jesus
Why in the world would she t
You took a fishing trip with the boys
Liked it so much, you took another
needed some time away
while she watched the kids
Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer
But she said
(weary) '
the kids have camp
Their friends are here
Over there, 'll just be shopping in a language  don't even know
My life, and the kids' lives, aren't here to service your mid-life crisis
'  Did it go like that
It did
People are passing them
They do not notice
She called it a fight
The fight
What do you call it
You told her you had doubts
He looks around
People are moving on
Toward their drinks, their dinners, their lives
Can we go sit somewhere
Let me put it this way
Hell, no
And takes out her cigarettes
Her fingers fumble slightly
It isn't the cold
told her  loved her
By way of saying you were unhappy
Restless
Excuse me
'Things are so confusing for me, Jack
Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able
It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules
When  think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life
' Dead at his eyes
And he nods
Once
(softly) '
don't know if  can make it
' That's what  said
But  didn't leave
No, she threw you out
What a difficult woman
Pulls out her box of matches
So now get to wait
single match
For the first sign
The first fishing trip
it
Shields it from the wind
What do you figure, Luke
When am too old to be exciting
When your daughter brings home her college roommate
Lights her cigarette
As he watches
(softly) That's a pretty ugly thing you just said
No, here's ugly
' love you , babe
It's just our life together 'm not so sure about
' Big draw
Never wavering from his eyes
'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky,  might just never leave, who knows
' That's not us
Because you've changed so much
He puts his hands on her, gently
But she flinches
So the hands come away
You want me to show you the future
Well,  can't darlin'
can't
She searches the lovelight in his eyes
As if she could weigh it
We make our lives, one step at a time
We do the best we can
The truth about the future
promise
Is only a hope
How about the promises we make to our kids
About their future
Do we shrug those off, just that easily
That slows him down
Maybe Annabelle deserves to find out who really broke up her family
While her mom is still around
Stops him
Cold
(quiet) Hey
Just a thought
Flips her cigarette to the gutter
Shrugs
You got one less for dinner
Takes a step back
Only one
But it registers
Where you goin'
'm gonna get me a drink
Nods, to herself
And 'm gonna drink it alone
And she walks off
Slow
,   - Ben alone in the back seat
Reading his beloved Garfield book
Shift  to see
the women standing by the car
Rachel looks a little anxious
You really didn't have to come, you know
'd have brought them straight t
(staring at something) Who in the world is he
See now, across the way
gorgeous , dressed cool, stands holding an expensive bike
And chatting happily with Annabelle
In the distance, other kids pretend they aren't watching
Looks nice enough to m
He looks familiar
Did he do a Calvin Klein ad
Across the way, the boy leans, kisses Annabelle sweetly on the cheek
Waves to her
Peddles off
In distance, kids are dying
Annabelle pretends not to know that
Just walks casually toward us, but as she approaches, she can't help breaking into a , straight
into '
(breathless) It workeditworkedit worked Omi god you can't believe the look on his face Rachel tight enough to crush her bones
And although Rachel hugs back, although she kisses Annabelle's hair
Her eyes are locked to Jackie's
Houston
We have a problem
'  - Rachel alone by the weathered redwood swing and slide set
She is pacing in a circle, looking like a kid waiting to see the principal
Sucking her cigarette like smoke was oxygen
She picks a bottle of beer off the grass
Twists the top
Settles awkwardly on the seat of the taller swing
the screen door open
Bang shut
Rachel takes a sip
Before she looks up
(low, calm) Now we're going to have a fight, you and
(barely audible) Are we
And 'm going to win
(straight to her eyes) Don't be too sure
No anger in Jackie at this moment
The ferocity of that mother lion
The strongest face we'll ever see
Now, 'limp dick',  know
What
Is 'snowballing'
It doesn't matter,  didn't tell h
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so
And they'll b
Give 'em my number
Jackie on the prowl around this swing
Stalking her prey
Actually
They'll want Annabelle's mother
Is that what you're worried about
Looking bad at the
You are defending what you did
Right down to the ground
Let's get to it
Not quite what Jackie expected
You put filth in my child's mouth
Aw
You had her lie about that
that fancy-boy model Worked
Like a charm
Jackie cannot even believe this
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni
So you became the hero
And became the schmuck
Straightening her spine
You taught my child that  am some limp dick loser Who didn't care about her pain
That's not wh
You think didn't have some dirty words for that little putz
You think couldn't figure out some low blows
You weren't passing 'em out
Well, maybe your version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'
Stalking
Closer
Fierce
Mine
Is a little different
Right there
At the swing
In her face
See, in that crisis,  saw an opportunity
For some real growth
Oh please
Shut the fuck up
didn't go behind your back
The one scored
Rachel sips her beer
Doing the right thing
Knowing who you are , inside
Not caving to peer pressure, or lowering yourself to that level, steering your own course
She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering yours Well, that's what parenting is about little girl
They are pleading to know how they are supposed to do it
And you sure as hell showed her
Silence
And there will come another moment
When the stakes are really there
And she will look back on this
And remember how good it felt
How easy it was
And she'll fight back again
God help me, what have  done
Jackie's voice drops
The softness makes it somehow more menacing
You've turned her into you
And may not get another chance
To turn her back
(suddenly fierce) That's what it is
And that's all it is
The hand with its cigarette  out
You won't get the chance
Jackie back on her heels
Thinking
mile a minute
You've got a point there, for a change
Oh, yes you do
finger stabbing out
You didn't get morning sickness for seven months, you didn't breast feed till your nipples fell off, you didn't spend every minute of every day thinking and planning and knowing that your decisions were shaping the people they were going to be
And now Rachel
Has nothing to say
You are gonna be taking Ben's training wheels off
You are the one my little girl will confess her first love to
You will see them married , you will play with their babies , you fucking ,  hate your
The blast washes over Rachel
And in the silence
Now you're talking sense
She looks down at her beer
All year long, 've been watching how you do this
The worries, the sacri- fices, the signals you give them
Thinks
Really thinks
Wants so much to say this right
And  admire you
More than you'll ever believe
And yet
this
thing
has been growing
Inside me
Looks up
Straight to her eyes
For better or worse
'm not you
And so she stands up
The swing shimmies in her wake
can't live my life channeling the One True Mom after you're gone can't do it
can't do it
can't
Do it
Sets the beer down
Stabs out her smoke
We have to deal with that
And walks off, slowly
Across the yard
- Huge indoor space
Wood-sided walls, dirt floor
High corrugated metal roof, with birds flying, roosting in rafters
little , under the keen eye of her , puts her mount through its paces
In the cold air, steam rises from the horse's body
It's late, no one else around
now
down a walkway
Toward the stables
barn cat is crouched, stalking prey
We hear a soft voice, speaking
One we know
(
) It was like telling her
See him now
Standing awkwardly, against the side of a stall
that  didn't love her anymore
See the horse, still steaming
Standing patiently
if  could be sure 'd always stay
Circling the horse now, we see Annabelle's back
She is slowly brushing out the sweat mark
Where the saddle used to be
Her movements are stiff, mechanical
The soft voice continues
(
) She said, 'This thing you call a partnership
The schedules, the chores, all the things we have to work out
' Our   to see at last Annabelle's face
(
) (softer) '
for the kids
' The tears that stand in her eyes
The set line of her small mouth
(
) '
that's the life  dreamed of
And it's all  ever wanted it to be
' She swallows
Because she will not cry
(
) That's the kind of person your mom is
She's the best
Annabelle says nothing
She drops to her knees
Begins to clean out one of her horse's hooves with a metal pick
The only sound against the stillness
And her father watches
His heart pounding
complained a lot, baby
We couldn't travel, we'd lost our privacy, our chance to do things on the spur of the moment
To live for
ourselves
The way we'd started out
He goes to her
The sound of his feet on the straw
And she said
Sounds like you'd be happier
If the kids weren't around
Crouches down
Very close to his child
said
love them more than anything
But sometimes
do miss what 've lost
Annabelle stops working
Turns her faces away
She said she could never feel that way, not for one single second
So he leans closer
She didn't want to be with someone
Who could
Silence
He's staring at the back of her head
You know, this horse smells really bad
There's worse things
At least she can talk
If only just above a whisper
Do you know why  never told you all this before
beat
She doesn't look at him
Sure
You wanted me to blame her
Instead of you
Waiting to hear
(very softly) That's right
She hears honesty
And heartbreak
It makes her turn
How come you're telling me now
He gets lost
Looking in those eyes
don't want to be wrong anymore
don't
want to say 'm sorry, because  am
And let you hate me
If you have to
She swallows hard
Her eyes moving over his face
See that feeling
Where you feel two different things at once
That's a grown-up thing
It's not a lot of fun
She shakes her head very slightly
And her eyes water
Know why your mom never told you
She doesn't
She knew that you and her were so
solid
Nothing could rock that
But she didn't want to risk
The hardest thing
He's ever had to say
your hating me
Cos she loves you
Cos she loves you She wanted you to have a daddy to love
Even if he didn't
completely
deserve it
Now the tears in his eyes
And she's watching that
You know how much love that is
That she has for you
Do you
There's going to come a moment
When she'll really need you to give that back
And you're just the girl that can do it
The way he says this
Makes her ask
Now do  know when
He reaches
First time
Strokes her hair
That moment will come
And your heart is going to whisper, 'here it is' Winds his fingers
Around her hand
And you'll come through
She stares in his eyes
And dead straight
If  miss it, daddy
You clue me in
Okay, he nods
That's a plan
- The dimly chic bar
With its soft upscale buzz
Where Jackie told Luke she had cancer
Tonight, she waits alone
Watching the entrance
Nursing her drink
And then
Rachel comes into the place
Spots Jackie across the room
Weaves her way through the tables
And she is there
Slipping into her seat
Not knowing what to say
Thanks for coming out
Neutral ground
What's up
Jackie stares evenly
Her chin rests across the back of her knuckles
She looks tired, but okay
Fueled by adrenaline
Luke called
He says you're checking out
Of the Heartbreak Hotel
The waitress appears
Rachel too locked into the moment to notice
So
She likes a Stolie, no ice
(softly) Double
As the woman leaves
What's this about
Because we fought Don't flatter yourself
(beat) always liked that line
Signs
love Luke,  love the children
But there is more to life than even love
No, there isn't
And  have looked down the road
At what my life will be
And can't handle it
Jackie unblinking
Focused, strong
What do you see
Down that road
No answer
Then
never wanted to be a mom
Then, sharing it with you was one thing
Carrying it alone, the rest of my life
Is scary
But you want it
Gimme some truth here
The Stolie arrives
They wait a beat
The waitress disappears
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh
You die young, you always look golden
Perfect
The memory kind of burnishes the image, and
Come on, a wuss like me
The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back
Maybe  was wrong on that one
That sits there
In its sincerity
Well, maybe you weren't
And so does that
Tears are forming in Rachel's eyes
Here, in this public place
Look, when  said  couldn't channel you
That didn't mean  wouldn't give my right arm to do just that
Shakes her head
Maybe  don't want to be looking over my shoulder
Every day for twenty years
Knowing someone else would have done it right
The way  can't
Jackie waits
Thinks
Trade you a smoke
For a secret
The way she said that
Something weighty behind it
So Rachel reaches into her purse
You know,  lost Ben awhile back
In a supermarket
Rachel's hand freezes
In mid-course
You're lying
lost him
was panicked
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 seconds , you could find him from a coma , there is no
(smiles) was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off
Doing my imitation of you
Rachel still not buying
Ben never mentioned it
He only remembers found him
My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing  could ever have done for you
The smile fades
Why didn't
Uh
You hate my guts
Passing the cigarettes over
We were competing
Even then
Yes we were
Instead of being partners
Watch- ing each other's back
Seeing things were covered
Pulls out a smoke
Offers the pack
You're not scared you'll think you don't measure up
You're scared they'll think it
That's the thing, yeh
Rachel takes one
Eye contact holding
With good reason
They fucking worship you as it is
What do  have that you don't
Everything
You're
the Earth Mother incarnate
You're the hip and fresh
You ride with Annabelle
You'll learn
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's happiness has been wrapped up in you , every moment
have their past
the match
You
Have their future
Rachel stunned
By the simplicity of it all
Slowly, she leans to accept Jackie's flame
Don't you get it
You look down the road to her wedding
You're in the room alone with her, fitting her veil, fluffing her dress
Telling her no woman was ever that beautiful
Tears now
Standing in two pairs of eyes
And your fear is
She'll be thinking
wish Mom were here
Jackie lights her own
And mine is
She won't
Her hand trembles as she takes a drag
Now that's enough fear for either one of us to kill the other
And no jury in the world would convict
Jackie raises her glass
We're guilty, girl
Of being human
And we can't forgive ourselves
Holds it forward
In a toast
But  forgive you
And slowly, Rachel lifts her own glass
it with Jackie's
Don't rush me
'm deciding
'   - White Christmas outside the window
Richly trimmed tree, presents everywhere, carols softly playing
The whole nine yards
Luke and Ben standing at a wrapped bird cage, where a dove is cooing inside
Annabelle is setting out the cocoa with a uniformed
Rachel enters
Kisses Annabelle's head
'm gonna check on Mom
Goes down the hall, every emotion in the world is playing across her face
Into
' Jackie lies on her death bed
She is beautiful and near the end
Despite the  tube, the monitor, she's gotten to serenity after all
As close as any of us will ever get
Hey, gorgeous
Time for the presents
Jackie licks her lips
Pretty dry
Rachel takes a cotton lemon swab from the nightstand
Tenderly, cleans Jackie's mouth
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds
You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know
(clears her throat) Just want to be a little sharper
For a few minutes
few minutes
Some things to say
To the kids, huh
Smiles
Then, bring in the presents
We'll have big fun
Rachel can't really bear this
You know, there's nothing you have to say
Because they know your heart
You don't have t
Just sit me up
Nice and tall
Bring Benjamin first
Staring at each other
Then Rachel reaches her arms around Jackie, and as gently as she can manage, lifts her to a full sitting position
Scrapbook
Rachel brings the big book
Lays it on the bed
And goes
Jackie begins to turn the pages
Her life with these children passing before her eyes
No tears
No smile
Just full attention
Fingertips touch the one she was looking for, as
The door
Ben, hesitant, enters alone
His mother's face is fine and strong and smiling
Find the bird cage
(standing there) Rache says it's from you
Well, don't make him disappear before  see him
Ben nods
Okay,  won't
She glances to the scrapbook
Oh, look at this
And forgetting his uneasiness, he runs over, climbs  the bed
Jackie doesn't wince, doesn't even blink
Nothing for his memory bank but smiles
He looks at the photo
Jackie holding a spunky newborn
That's you and me
Our first photo as a couple
He nods
Really staring at it
Did you know  was good-looking right away
She reaches to hold his face in her hand
Stares in his eyes
This good-looking
Was beyond my imagination
She leans
Kisses his lips lightly
How many more times will she get to do this
(a murmur) So what do you think we're gonna talk about
(straight back) You dying
She nods
Her smile is right there
The secret of it
That only magicians
Can ever understand
His eyes brighten
The sadness pushed aside
See, when we die
Our body goes away
Our body
But we we are not our body, are we
He doesn't know
Maybe he thought we were
If a soldier loses his legs in a war
Is he the same guy
Sure he is
But you can still see him
Half
Of him
This is so fucking hard
But her eyes stay dry
Dying
Is where the whole body goes away
So you can't see any of it
But Rests her hand tenderly
On his hair
What do magicians know
Leans forward
Here's the secret
Just because you can't see it
Doesn't
Mean
It's gone
Does it
And Ben smiles
He is inside the secret
The world
Thinks 'm gone
But only the magician
Knows better
So where are you
She was waiting for this
For a long time
She wraps her hand around his fist
And puts their hands against his heart
(a whisper) Right here
Right here
Inside the magician
Shhhh
Can  talk to you
When you're there
Always
Always
And you won't hear a voice
But in here You'll know
What 'm saying
Yes, you will
It's not good enough
No, it isn't
Because it isn't everything
And we want every- thing, don't we
He nods
They do
But God does let us keep the one best thing we have together
The one best thing we've always had
Know what it is
He doesn't
But he wants to
love you
And you love me
Comes closer
Nose to nose
It's worth a lot
Will you keep it
He answers
With a kiss
- Luke and Annabelle are doing a hugely complex jigsaw puzzle
Ben runs in, falls on his knees by the puzzle
Without looking at Annabelle, he tells her
Your turn
It wasn't bad
Annabelle looks straight to her dad
There is a moment, a silence, that no one else could ever understand
She leans to him and whispers
Here it is
His eyes water
He takes her in his arms
Whispers close to her ear, only the words
Here it is
She smiles at hi
Fear gone, filled with resolve
Gives him a kiss
Rises, to
follow Rachel down the hall
Rache wraps an arm around her big girl
No words, except a murmured
You can do this
Voice cracking
She's not as good at it as this girl's mother
You can do anything
At the door
Open it, and
' Annabelle enters alone
The door closes behind her
Her eyes lock with her mother's
No words
Annabelle's eyes filled with tears, and Jackie's arms
out, and Annabelle  to them
They hold each other
For a forever moment
don't want to say goodbye
Don't
Take me with you
And Annabelle looks up
Tears on her face
Thank God
got to see you
Grown up
'm not
(very softly) Let me be the judge of that
And Annabelle climbs onto the bed
Their hands never stop touching each other
Saying  love you
There's an amazing thing when a woman has a daughter
One day you look up, and you see
a sister
Someone
You can say
Anything to
Anything
wrote a whole lot of letters
To each of you
And the envelope says when to open it
Like, which birthday
Or
when you get your driver's permit
First time you see Rome
Things like that
Things like that
Annabelle is beginning to lose it now
So Jackie says only
Keep Ben's for awhile, okay
Until he's old enough to not open them all at once
Until he's old enough to read
Tears on Annabelle's face
Her mom wonders
Are you afraid for me
Where 'm going
Yes
Don't be
'm going
Where we all go
Now how can that be bad
'll miss you so much
Good
That's very good
She nods, yes it is
What you're grown-up enough to know
Is that people
Can do two things at once
Okay
She brushes at her baby's tears
Then tastes her wet fingertips
Mmmn, surprisingly good
Annabelle sort of smiles
You can miss me
And
Take me with you
Hold the child's face
In her hands
When you're in trouble
Have me there
When you fall in love
Have me there
You can
Said with such absolute assurance
That's how we go on, you know
Forever
Because someone takes us along
Annabelle swallows hard
On your wedding night
When your babies are born
want to be there
Will you take me
straight question
It needs an answer
Always, always
Always
sigh
shared smile
You made my life wonderful
You
Take that with you, too
Hold
On Annabelle
'  - The presents are here now, they fill up the room, spill over the bed, where both children sprawl
Ben  the shit out of wrappings like a wolverine, Annabelle carefully saving her gift paper as if she were going to hang it in the Louvre
She holds a tank top up to her chest, for her Mom's approval
Jackie's not sure
Rachel handing up more boxes, Luke in charge of bagging trash
Ben's white dove, flying free around the room, zipping and diving
No one cares
It's Christmas
Hold
And
- Family and friends are leaving the wake, exiting the softly-lit chapel into a snowy night
They are saying goodbyes, kissing one another, going to their cars
And saying her last goodbye
Rachel turns to Luke
Whispers, close to his ear
He looks at her for a beat, then leads Annabelle and Ben toward the car, as
Rachel goes back into the chapel
Alone
The room is nearly dark
One soft spot plays on a simple
No canned organ music, no sound at all
As Rachel enters
She goes to the casket
Stares down at it for a beat
And just above a whisper
See,  told you 'd do this
Only
Only
Now  don't know what to say
Her hand reaches out
finger absently traces the edge of the wood
It seems a gesture of unconscious affection
You'd have written it down, so you wouldn't blow it
slight smile
Here's where the love shows
Maybe we should change places
Nods slightly
Maybe we should
She takes a step back now, to a waiting chair
Sits
Her hands folded in her lap
Thinks
Well
We were less than friends, guess
And more
More
We were never
girlfriends, we never dished
That wasn't
What we had
No apology there
It's just the truth
We had some battles, man, they were
world class, huh
(beat) And  don't regret a one of them
Sad little shrug
miss them
Thinking
Of how much more she'll miss
We've got our secrets, we have
And 'll keep 'em if you will
Crosses her arms
Lost in the moment
But  wish we had one more night
In that little bar, remember
Remember that toast
Sure, you do
Her voice wavers
But the eyes are dry
Know what
forgive me, too
See
You're the magician
murmur
Don't worry, partner, 've got your back
We're covered
It's what she came to say
- Lights and music and laughter
They're in black tie tonight
It's a wedding party
Up on the stage, at the head table, some guy is finishing a toast, and as everyone  and
so
Thank she's more than he deserves
Everybody shouts
Everybody drinks champagne
And the bride stands up
In her white gown
In her hand, an envelope
She goes to the mike, and waits for the raucous cheers, the calls of
, to die down
Leans to the mike
Flushed and happy
And, oddly, nervous
Now  know the tradition, so this isn't a toast
At least
not for me
The guest list is 114
But we all know there's one more here, tonight
Because
Looks down the table at her children
Dressed to kill
Enjoying the party
my two sidekicks there always bring her along
Wherever they go
Right
Right
So Jackie and  were sitting around
On New Year's Eve
And she said, 'You're not gonna talk at my funeral, are you
' And now
It is quiet indeed
And  said, ''ve never been to a funeral
'm not sure 'll know how to act
' Her sweet smile
Keeps the mood right
'
but 'll prob'ly sneak into where you are
Just before it's over
' Nods to herself
Fights back the feeling of that moment
'
say something
Just to you
Get the last word in, when you can't talk back
' There is laughter in this room
Gentle, loving
So she says, 'No way
' Holds up the envelope
Holds it tight
She wrote this
She sealed it up,  didn't see it
She made me promise to read it
At the wedding
And slowly, Luke begins to
And others join
And when it stops
told her she'd better make it dirty, or make it funny
Because
no way
on my wedding
No way in hell
could she make me cry
They are loving it
She says, 'It's a deal'
The band plays an impromptu
Rachel begins to carefully tear open the envelope
Now, if it's too raunchy, we may have to excuse the kids
from everyone,  the children
She has it open
She looks at it
And everything
Stops
The world watches her sway, watches her eyes fill as she stares at the small card in her hand
She can't believe this
(mouths to herself) You promised
The tears are welling
Everyone  for her to read it
She leans to the mike, shaking her head
It's
no big thing, really
it's just
five words, it's
The place goes happily
joyful  of demand
Tears  now, Rachel fumbles to pull up her white beaded bag
As she puts the card inside, we alone can read the words
on this
And
