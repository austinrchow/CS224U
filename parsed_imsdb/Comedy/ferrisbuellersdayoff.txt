() () -
() (whispers, sadistic) When you turn ten, your head's going to swell up real big like a watermelon and we're going to have to put you to sleep like they do with a dog
Where's Mom
Is my head going to swell up
What
,
'
() (screams) The house falls dead
We hear footsteps thundering through the house
What's that
Wait
Hold still
What
You heads starting to swell up
Todd screams
We hear the sound of Tom's footsteps running through the kitchen, down the hall, up the stairs, up the hallway
door open
(breathless) What's the matter
(worried) It's Ferris
What's wrong
(snaps) What's wrong
For Christ's sake
Look at him
2  -
2 An eighteen year-old boy
He's staring lifelessly at
His mouth's open
His eyes are bugged-out
His tongue is fat and dry in his mouth
He's laying in bed, on his side
3
'                                             3 Ferris' parents,  and   are standing at bedside
They're in their late forties, early fifties
Handsome, upper-middle class parents
They're both dressed for work
Ferris
He doesn't have a fever
But he says his stomach hurts and he's seeing spots
4  -
4 His lifeless eyes blink
5
5 Tom bends down and touches Ferris' forehead
What's the matter, Ferris
Feel his hands
They're cold and clammy
Tom takes one of Ferris' hands
(discreetly) Should you call the doctor
(whispers) He doesn't want me to
Why don't you want Mom to call the doctor
Ferris exhales loudly
He tries to speak but all he can manage is a choked gasp
What
Ferris tries again
(raspy) Don't make a fuss
'm fine
'll get up
He starts to get up
Joyce gently pushes him back down
have a test today
have to take it
want to get into a good college so  can have a fruitful life
You're not going to school like this
(to Tom) Maybe  should call the office and tell them  won't be in
'm okay, Mom
feel perfectly
Oh, God
He's gripped by a seizure
His body stiffens and he chokes
His older sister, , walks into the room
She's dressed for school
She's cute and stuck-up
major pill
Oh, fine
What's this
What's his problem
He doesn't feel well
Yeah, right
Dry that one out and you can fertilize the lawn
That's enough, Jeanie
You're not falling for this, are you
Tell me you're not falling for this
Is that Jeanie
can't see that far
Jeanie
Pucker up and squat, Ferris
(annoyed) Thank you, Jeanie
Get to school
(angry, defeated) You're really letting him stay home
can't believe this
If  was bleeding out my eyes, you guys'd make me go to school
It's so unfair
Please don't be upset with me, Jeanie
Be thankful that you're fit and have your health
Cherish it
(to herself) Oh,  wanna puke
She glares at Ferris
Her eyes are mascara and vengence
She slips out of the room
Ferris' brother,  and sister, peek into the room
Myocardial infarction
Get your stuff
Daddy'll be right down
Syphilitic meningitus
That would be a huge family embarrassment
Get downstairs
If he dies,  got dibs on his stereo
She turns sharply and exits
(worried) Dad
Does my head look alright
Get downstairs
Now
Just answer me one question
Is it swelling up
Kim said it was going to get as big as
() (yells out the room) Shut-up
Get downstairs
Todd backs out of the room
'll be okay
'll just sleep
Maybe 'll have an aspirin around noon
(to Ferris) 'm showing houses to the family from California today but 'll be in the area
My office'll know where am, if you need me
'll check it with you, too
It's nice to know  have such loving, caring parents
You're both very special people
6
6 He acknowledges Tom with a pathetic flutter of his eyelids
7
7 She strokes Ferris' hair
hope you feel better, pumpkin
She leans down and kisses his forehead
Tom pats his shoulder
Get some rest
8
8 Ferris lets out a wheeze
His glassy eyes follow his parents to the door
() We love you, sweetie
() Call if you need us
They close the door
The lock clicks
Ferris' eyes shift from the door to
sly, little smile crawls across his lips
They bought it
The  theme music
9
9 The  at the foot of Ferris' bed
The  logo is playing
10
10 Ferris yanks open the drapes
The pall of the sickroom disappears in the brilliant glow of morning sunlight
Incredible
One of the worst performances of my career and they never doubted it for a second
(looks out the window) What a beautiful day
He turns from the window
Parents always fall for the clammy hands
It's physical evidence of illness
It's a good, non-specific symptom
Parents are generally pretty hip to the fever scams
And to make them work you have to go a hundred and one, hundred and two
You get a nervous mother and you end up in a doctor's office and that's worse than school
He flips on his stereo and fills the room with the broadcast
begins
Fake a stomach cramp and when you're doubled over, moaning and wailing, just lick your palms
It's a little stupid and childish but then so if high school
Right
He equalizes the sound a little
This is my ninth sick day with semester
If  go for ten, 'm probably going to have to barf up a lung
So,  absolutely must make this one count
He exits into the hallway
11
11 Ferris walks into the bathroom
It's littered with Jean's debris
He turns on the shower water
don't care if you're fifty five or seven, everybody needs a day off now and then
It's a beautiful day
How can  be expected to handle high school
He bends down    as he loses his briefs
He pops up
do actually have a test
That wasn't bullshit
He steps into the shower
Through the pebbled glass of the shower door we see Ferris' outline
That  care about it was
12
12 Inside the shower
Ferris' hair is standing straight up
It's moulded into a fin with shampoo
It's on European socialism
mean, really
What's the point
'm not European
don't plan to be European
So, who gives a shit if they're socialists
They could be fascist anarchists and it still wouldn't change the fact that don't own a car
He turns the shower head around and uses it like a microphone
(sings) , , 13
13 Ferris comes out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist
He's drying his hair with another of a different color
Not that  condone fascism
Or and "isms"
"Isms", in my opinion are not good
person should not believe in an "ism"
He should believe in himself
John Lennon said it on his first solo album
" don't believe in Beatles, just believe in me
"  good point there
Afterall, he was the Walrus
He opens a linen closet and tosses the towel in it
could be the Walrus and 'd still have to bum rides off people
He passes  and goes into his room
() 'm not very political
Let me put that into perspective
14
14 Ferris tosses the towel he's dried hair with on the bed
My uncle went to Canada to protest the war, right
On the Fourth of July he was down with my aunt and he got drunk and told my Dad he felt guilty he didn't fight in Viet Nam
So  said, "What's the deal, Uncle Jeff
In wartime you want to be a pacifist and in peacetime you want to be a soldier
It took you twenty years to find out you don't believe in anything
" (snaps his fingers) Grounded
Just like that
Two weeks
(pause) Be careful when you deal with old hippies
They can be real touchy
He opens his door
15
15 The door opens and Ferris rifles through his shirts
My mother was a hippie
But she lost it
She got old
If she listens to the White Album now
She doesn't hear music, she hears memories
Nostalgia is her favorite drug
It'll probably be mine, too
hope not
He finds a shirt he likes
He steps back from the closet and puts it on
He drops the towel
16
16 He walks across the room to his dresser
He opens his underwear drawer
There's an old model of a submarine on the top of the dresser
He picks it up
In eighth grade a friend of mine made a bong out of one of these
The smoke tasted like glue
He pulls out a pair of underwear
He gets dressed as he speaks
His name is Garth Volbeck
He's a serious outsider
Not a bad guy, like him
'm probably his only friend
do what  can for him
mean, if was him, 'd appreciate it
Do unto others, right
Anyway, his mother owns a gas station
His father's dead and his sister's rumored to be a prostitute, which is complete bullshit
She only puts out so people will hang out with her
It's sad but  don't hold it against her
Better to hold it against the guys who use her and don't care about her
(pause) My parents never allowed Garth over here
It was because of his family
Mainly his older brother
He's in jail
could see them not wanting his brother here because he is a registered psycho
wouldn't want him here
once watched the guy eat a whole bowl of artificial fruit just so he could see what it was like to have his stomach pumped
But Garth isn't his brother
It isn't his fault that his brother's screwed-up
Alot of fights with the parents on that point
always felt for Garth
was sleeping at his house once and  was laying on the dark worrying that his brother was going to come in and hack me to death with an ax and  heard Garth crying
asked him what was wrong and he said, "Nothing"
Nothing was wrong
There was no specific thing he was crying about
In fact, he wasn't really even aware that he was crying
He just cried himself to sleep every night
It was a habit
The guy's so conditioned to grief that if he doesn't feel it, he can't sleep
How could you possibly dump on guy who has to deal with that kinda shit
My parents acknowledge the trudge of the situation and 'm sure that deep down, they do feel for him but still the guy's banned from our house
He looks at himself in the mirror on the back of his closet door
He doesn't like what he's wearing
He continues his speech as he disrobes
Unfortunately, now my parents have a legit argument
Garth doesn't need his brother to give him a rep anymore
He's getting one on his own
He's lost
It's over for him
He's eighteen
Gone from school
Gone from life
His legacy is a gas station
17
17 Ferris comes down the stairs
He's wearing a completely different outfit
One very serious danger is playing sick is that it's possible to believe your own act
18
18 Ferris comes into the kitchen and crosses to the refrigerator
That and boredom
Alot of people ditch and feel great for about an hour
Then they realize there's nothing to do
and food
myself have ditched and gotten so bored did homework
Figure that shit out
He takes a sip out of a bottle of orange juice
You have to plan things out before you take the day off
Otherwise you get all nervous worrying about what to do and all you get is grief and the whole point is to take it easy, cut loose and enjoy
He crosses to the pantry
You blow your day and at about three o'clock, when everybody's out of school, you're going to wish you'd gone to school so you could be out having fun
He emerges from the pantry with a handful of Oreos
Avoid the misery
Plan your day
Do it right
19
19 Ferris walks in and flops down in an armchair
There's alot of pressure at work in my age group
And it's not always recognized
He reaches over and picks up the telephone
He sets it in his lap
Some guy whose hair is falling out and his stomach's hanging over his belt and everything he eats makes him fart, he looks at someone like me and thinks, "This kid's young and strong and has a full, rich future ahead of him, what's he got to bitch about
" 20
20 He punches out a number
21
21 He remote controls the  on
That's just one reason why  need a day off every now and then
22

'                                            23 It's a dark, dreary sick room
Shades drawn, floor strewn with used tissues, nightstand a still-life of over the counter remedies
high school boy,  , is laying in bed
We don't see his face, only a silhouette with a thermometer sticking out his mouth
U2's is playing
He's mumbling random words
Food
shelter
no
yes
The phone rings
His hand reaches back and hits the speaker phone button
(weak) Hello
' Cameron
What's happening
Very little
' How do you feel
Shredded
' Is your mother in the room
Cameron takes the thermometer out of his mouth
She's not home
Where are you
' Home
24
'
24 Ferris is sprawled out in the chair
'm taking the day off
Get dressed and come over
' can't
'm sick
It's all in your head
Come on over
25
'                                           25 Cameron's insistant
feel like complete shit, Ferris
can't go anywhere
' 'm sorry to hear that
Now, come on over and pick me up
Ferris disconnects
Cameron slowly hangs up the phone
'm dying
The phone rings again
Cameron hits the speaker button
' You're not dying
You just can't think of anything good to do
26
'                                       26 Ferris hangs up
If anybody needs a day off, it's Cameron
He has alot of things to sort out before he graduates
He can't be wound this tight and go to college
His roommate'll kill him
've come close myself
But like him
He's a little easier to take when you know why he's like he is
The boy cannot relax
Pardon by French but Cameron is so tight that if you stuck a lump of coal up his ass, in two weeks you'd have a diamond
(after-thought) And Cameron would worry that he'd owe taxes on it
27
27 We hear roll call as    the tile floor shoe's
' Albers

' Anderson

It travels past a teacher's Hush Puppies and heads up an aisle of desk past dirty yellow Reebocks, rotting Air Jordans, scuffed heels, pristine loafers
' Anheiser
' Here
' Busch
' Here
' Bueller
reaches the last desk and rises slowly to reveal that it's empty
' Bueller
' He's sick
(pause) My best friend's sister's boyfriend's brother's girlfriend heard from this guy who knows this kid who's going with a girl who saw Ferris pass-out at 31 Flavors last night
guess it's pretty serious
' (weary) Thank you, Simone
' (cheery) No problem whatsoever
' Drucker
' What

28
28 is playing on video cassette
The big chase at the end
He's sitting in the arm chair pretending it's Humongous' war wagon
He's wearing a hockey mash
He's steering
He reaches down and grabs an imaginary nitrous oxide valve
Humongous reaches down and grabs a real nitrous oxide valve
He gives it a twist
He throws himself back against the chair
The force of the rapid acceleration of his vehicle throws Humongous back in his seat
He bounces himself in the chair to simulate the bumpy high speed ride
The was wagon hurtles down the road
He rears back in horror
The war wagon is heading for a head-on collision with the tanker truck
Arms outstretched, head thrown back, braced for collision
29
29 Outside a bedroom window
flowering crabtree branch
Petite pink flowers It's Jeanie's room
pink and powder blue pig pen
Clothes everywhere, make-up, books, records
Ferris is sitting on her bed going through a purse
This is really degrading
He comes up with a crumpled dollar bill
Financing my activities this way
Very damaging to the self-image
But, hey, 'm broke
In times of crisis one must to what one must to
'll pay it back
With interest
He comes up with a five
Regardless of how much shit sisters make you eat, how often they rat on you, how gross they act or how wicked and insensitive they can be, you should not alientate them
Because most likely they have cash and it's usually very easy to get your hands on
He holds up a twenty and snaps it
' "" 30
30 The song plays as Ferris digs through the sofa cushions
Ferris extracts a sticky quarter from a crevice
31
'                                         31 Ferris is going through his father's pants pockets
Another crumpled bill surfaces
32
32 couple of stiff, hard, bleached singles that have gone through the wash lay on top of the washer
hand scoops them up
33
33 An obvious gift from a grandparent
Mint proof set ten, a five and a single enclosed in a lucite frame screwdriver tip wedges between the two pieces of Lucite and pops them apart
hand peels the bills off the backing
34
34 Hands ripping through the kitchen junk drawer
Locating a dollar bill
35
35 The familiar blue collector's album
One-by-one, the quarters are being popped out of their slots
36
36 The dusty, dirty contents of the bag are emptied on the floor
Fingers pick a dime out of a matted wad of filth
37
37 It's being shaken furiously
38
38 It's a child's card
It's slowly opened to reveal a crisp, new five
39
39 The door opens and Ferris thrusts his hands into the pockets of the coats
He comes up with a ball of Kleenex
roll of Tums
squirt gun
Then a modest wad of bills
His face lights up as he counts out the cash
He closes the door
40
40 Ferris' face appears between the bed and the floor
His arm reaches out for a small metal bank hidden under the bed
41
41 It's on a work bench
An awl is driven in between the door and the jamb
It pries the door open
Inside are trading cards, a charred doll's head, a Zippo lighter and, finally, a five dollar bill
42
42 Ferris is on his hands and knees under the kitchen table
43
43 Ferris lifts the leg and removes a quarter that's been used to balance the table
44
44 Ferris stands up and pockets the quarter
45
'                                               45 shower of coins and bills rain down on the sheets

47 Joyce is behind a desk
Across from her are two
They're also real estate agents
No one's going to consider a house with a black living room
Not even those jerks from Vermont
Let's be realistic
1 Mrs
Volbeck's dead set against putting any money into the house
Joyce's phone intercom buzzes
She take the call
Joyce Bueller
Her eyes open wide with alarm
Oh, my God
'm so sorry completely forgot to call

48 modern, suburban high school
' Are you aware that your son is not in school today
49
49 It's a passing period
The hall is clogged with students
' Yes,  am
Ferris is home sick had a meeting first thing this morning
should have called
It completely slipped my mind
50
'                               50 is at work at her desk
We hear the dean inside the office
' Are you also aware that Ferris does not have what we consider an exemplary attendance record
51
'
51 It reads,
The dean's feet are up on the desk, behind the sign
Moderately priced dress shoes
' don't understand
' just had his file up
is sitting behind his desk
He's tough, clean and straight as an -beam
Short, neatly combed hair, suit and tie
He's toying with a pencil
He's confident to the point of arrogance
just has his file up, Mrs
Bueller
Behind him is a computer terminal
He removes his feet from the desk and turns in his swivel chair
If Ferris thinks he coast this last month and still graduate, he's sorely mistaken
' This is all news to me
The monitor on Rooney's desk displays Ferris' records
' So far this semester alone, he's been absent nine times
Including today
' Nine times
Under   we see a number 9 suddenly change to a number 2
Rooney turns to the monitor
He reads off the screen
have it right here in front of me
He's missed
He looks closer at the screen
52
'                                             52 Ferris is at his Macintosh computer
He has his record up on the screen
wanted a car
got a computer
How's that for being born under a bad sign
53
'                                           53 She's still on the phone with Rooney
can give you every assurance that Ferris is home and that he is, in fact, very ill
debated whether or not  should even leave him
can appreciate that at this time of year children are prone to taking the day off, but in Ferris' case, he's truly a very sick boy
54
'                                          54 The grille cloth is throbbing
The meters on the amplifier are totally in the danger zone

He's playing
home video camera is capturing Ferris on tape
55
'                                           55 He's sitting on the edge of the bed buttoning his shirt
He sighs deeply and fall back on the bed
56
56 Jeanie is at her locker during a passing period comes up to her
'm really sorry about your brother
What're you sorry for
have to live with the trouser snake
No,  mean  heard he's really sick
Who said he's sick
whole bunch of people
They said he's like on the verge of death
Jeanie stares incredulously at the girl
This guy in my biology class said that if Ferris dies he's giving his eyes to Stevie Wonder
He's really sweet isn't he
She smiles and exits
Jeanie cocks her head in bewilderment
She kicks her locker shut
57
'                                             57 He's in bed on the phone
sample of my blood was sent to Atlanta to the Center for Disease Control

When the guy had the creature in his stomach
It feels like that
58
58 is on the pay phone
couple of his are standing at his side waiting anxiously for news
Goddamn
Are you kidding
What
Did you see Alien
No
You never rented the video cassette
Second boy shakes his head, no
Oh
He's really wasted
(to the Second Boy) Who's he talking to
Ferris Bueller
You know him
(excited) Yeah
He's getting me out of summer school
Anyway,  appreciate you letting us know how you're doing
We gotta split
(pause) Huh
Yeah, sure
Hold on
(to Third Boy) Shit
hope he doesn't die
can't handle summer school
The boy snatches a passing
Did you see Alien
Yeah, why
He hands her the phone
Hello
(pause) Who
(pause) Hi, Ferris
How's your bod
(jaw drops) Oh, my God
You're dying
Is it serious
(pause) Shiit
Are you upset

'                                            59 Rooney's comparing his computer monitor to hard copy
His is standing over his shoulder
don't trust this kid any further than  can throw him
With your bad knee, you better not throw anybody, Ed
Rooney stares at her for a long beat
What's so dangerous about a character like Ferris Bueller is that he gives the good kids bad ideas
The last thing need at this point in my career is fifteen hundred Ferris Bueller disciples running around these halls
He's very popular, Ed
Sportos, motorheads, geeks, sluts, pinheads, dweebies, wonkers, richies, they all adore him
That's exactly why  have to catch him this time
To show these kids that the example he sets is a first class ticket to nowhere
(impressed) Ooo
You sounded like Dirty Harry just now
Rooney looks up at her with a proud smile
Really
He unconsciously does an Eastwood squint

Modigliani nude
Cameron, if you're not over here in fifteen minutes, you can find a new best friend
'm serious, man
This is bullshit, making me wait around the house for you
62

Why can't you leave me alone
' You're not up for some good times
It's a beautiful day
It's almost summer

63
'                                             63 He's growing weary of Cameron's wimpishness
You want to stay home and try to have the shits
Try to barf
Try to feel worse
' don't have to try
Be a man
Take some Pepto Bismol and get dressed
You're boring me with this stuff
The other phone line rings
Squeeze you buns for a second got another call

Can you hold on a second

Are you alright

Hold on

' Oh, that's just great
Are you busted
It's completely cool
He's just checking up on me
Now, listen to me
'm working on getting some heavy bucks out of him
So, the least you can do is hurry up and get over here
Bye
He disconnects and gets his father back
He switches back to his sick voice
Sorry, Dad
The moment before you called,  had a chest spasm and blew lung fluid all over the place
It was making me ill looking at it
But gee, it's sure great of you to call
'm sure there're alot of fathers who wouldn't take time out from their busy schedules to call a dumb, sick teenager
' Hey, pal, what was  supposed to do
Ferris reaches out and hits a key on his computer
The screen dumps the drawing
Give yourself some credit, Dad
It was a mammoth gesture
It's like those savings bonds you used to give me every Christmas
(looks at  and smiles) It was that kind of concern
message is flashing: " "

He lights a cigarette
You had to work hard for the money to buy those things, right
' Not any harder than anybody else
Ferris mouths Tom's words as he says them
67
67 Ferris' drawing suddenly appears on the billboard
Pedestrians stop to look
68
'                                             68 He blows a smoke ring
You work so hard 'll bet you don't even remember where those bonds are, right
Ferris points a finger in the air as a cue to his father
' Wrong
He nods
Oh, yeah
You're pulling my leg
You're just trying to cheer me up
' Like hell  am
They're in a shoebox in my closet
Ferris smiles
He looks at
He's gotten exactly what he wants
(to , normal voice) Was that a class move or what
The guy gave it up faster than a drunk Catholic girl
hope my kids don't pull this shit on me
(thinks) Of course, if they didn't, they'd be dumb and abnormal and they'd probably never move out of my house and 'd have to support them until  die
take it back
(to the phone, sick voice) Dad
All this talking has made me kind of light-headed
think better lie down
' Okay, pal
You take care
'll call you after lunch
You don't have to, Dad
' want to
Bye now
He hangs up
Ferris sighs
You win some, you lose some
He turns his desk chair around and gets up
'm so disappointed in Cameron
Twenty bucks says he's sitting in his car debating about whether or not he should go out
69
69 He's sitting behind the wheel of his car
We're gonna get caught
No doubt about it
He cuts the engine
'm not doing it
He sits for half a beat
He'll keep calling until  come over
He sighs and restarts the engine
Another beat
Actually, what'll happen is 'll get caught
Ferris'll escape
Another beat
He stops the engine
70
70 Hands curl around the drawer pulls
The drawer is opened slowly, ominously
The hands lift a sweater out as we see a men's magazine beneath the sweater
' He takes out the magazine
He leafs through the pages for the pictorials as he speaks
Cameron'll go on like that for a good thirty minutes
The guy is a shellfish when it comes to making a decision
The reason he doesn't fell good is, he worries about everything
He's the only guy  know who's deeply concerned that when he grows up there'll be a critical shortage of strategic metals
He exits the room
71
71 Ferris comes out of his room and heads down the hallway
Cameron's also the only guy know who knows what strategic metals are
(waves the magazine) Pardon moi
He goes into the bathroom
We (sings) '    , '
72
72 stunningly beautiful girl,  , is sitting at her desk in a history class
She's staring out the window as a tweedy   delivers a dry, dusty lecture
Roosevelt's health had seriously deteriorated by the time he met with Churchill and Stalin at Yalta
(sneezes) Pardon me
The classroom door opens and the school  walks in
For a moment, the teacher thinks she's come in because she heard him sneeze
She crosses to him and whispers in his ear
She, like the others, watches the nurse curiously
The teacher's face drops as he's delivered an obvious piece of disturbing news
He nods grimly to the Nurse
She looks at the kids
Sloane Peterson
Sits up in her seat
She's a picture of compassion and understanding
May  see you outside for a moment
There's been an emergency
smile curls across her lips
As she gathers her books she looks to the  next to her
(whispers) Dead grandmother
73
73 The Nurse is gently holding Sloane's hand
(nods solemnly) Dead grandmother
74
74 He has a suspicious look on his face
Dead grandmother
' Rooney's at his desk
His secretary is standing across from him
That's what Mr
Peterson said had Florence Sparrow notify Sloane
Who's this girl's going with
It's so hard to tell
see her alot with Ferris Bueller
Rooney smiles
His suspicions are confirmed
Could you get me Mr
Peterson's daytime number
As the secretary starts out of the room, Rooney's phone rings
She stops and answers the desk phone
Edward Rooney's office
(pause) Yes
Can you hold
Thank you
She puts the call on hold
It's Mr
Peterson
Rooney is startled
He thinks for a beat then reaches for the phone
Do you still want his number
Rooney answers her with an annoyed look
She smiles and backs out
He punches the phone button
Ed Rooney
' Ed
This is George Peterson
How are you today, sir
' We've had a bit of bad luck this morning as you may have heard
Rooney rolls his eyes
It's so obvious it's not Mr
Peterson
heard
And, gosh, 'm all broken up
Huh
Oh, sure
'd be happy to release Sloane
You produce a corpse and 'll release Sloane
want to see this dead grandmother firsthand
The secretary stops cold in the doorway
She turns to Rooney in horror
He covers the phone
(whispers) It's Ferris Bueller
Nervy litttle punk
'm gonna set a trap and let his walk right into it
(to phone) That's right
Cart the stiff in and 'll turn over your daughter
It's school policy
Was this your mother
Rooney's other line rings
75
'                                       75 She steps out of Rooney's office and picks up the other line
Ed Rooney's office
Her jaw drops
Hold, please
She puts the call on hold and hangs up
She hurried into Rooney's office
76
'                                            76 Rooney's chewing out the person on the other line
'll tell you want, you don't like my policies, you can just come on down and smooch by big old ugly ass
You hear me
The secretary comes in
She's waving her arms furiously
Rooney tries to wave her away
He's angry
She stomps her foot
Rooney covers the phone
What
Ferris Bueller's on line two
' It freezes in mid-tap
' The pencils falls from his fingers
' mask of horror
He glances at the phone
The second line light is flashing
He blinks, cocks his head, twitches
77
'                                             77 He's zipping his pants, fastening his belt
The phone's cradled against his shoulder
He speaks in the same voice he used on his father
Mr
Rooney
'm sorry to disturb you at work but  was wondering if it would be possible for my sister to bring home any assignments from my classes that  may need
78
'
78 He's staring blankly ahead
' Thank you, sir
He nods
Rooney's finger gingerly presses the button on the waiting call
He winces as he returns to the first call
79
'
79 Cameron's on the phone in the kitchen
He's doing a deep, phoney "father" voice
You oughta be sorry for Christ's sake
family member dies and you insult me
What's the matter with you, anyway
80
'
80 He apologies profusely to Cameron
He's perspiring, trembling
don't know
thought you were someone else
You have to know, sir, that  would never deliberately insult you
can't begin to tell you how embarrassed  am
' Pardon my French but you're an asshole
Rooney nods enthusiastically
Absolutely
most certainly am
81
81 Cameron lays into Rooney
This isn't over yet, buster
You just make sure my daughter's out in front of the school in ten minutes
Do you read me
' Load and clear, Mr
Peterson
Call me sir, goddamn it
' Sir
That's better
Ferris strolls into the kitchen to catch the last of the conversation
Cameron covers the phone
(to Ferris) 'm scared shitless, Ferris
What is Rooney guesses my voice
Impossible
You're doing great
Cameron sighs and goes back to the phone
(clears his throat) don't have all day to bark at you so 'll make this short and sweet
Ferris gives Cameron an enthusiastic thumbs up
(mouths) Great
Cameron smiles proudly
want my daughter out in front of the school in ten minutes
By herself
don's want anyone around
Ferris smacks Cameron
He's said the wrong thing
He covers the phone
What'd  do
Out in front my herself
It's too suspicious
He'll think something's up, moron
Cover it
Cameron panics
He holds the phone out to Ferris
You do it
Ferris waves his arms angrily
Talk
Cameron takes a deep breath
He clears his throat and puts on his father's voice
changed my mind, fella
You be out in front with her
wanna have a few words with you
Ferris slaps Cameron
The phone flies out of his hand
82
82 He winces as the phone hits the floor with a loud
We         , ' On second thought,  don't have time to talk to you
We'll get together soon and have lunch
We
83
'                                          83 Cameron's rubbing the side of his head
Why'd you hit me
Where's your brain
Why'd you hit me
Where's your brain
Why'd you hit me
Where's your brain
asked you first
How can we pick up Sloane if Rooney's going to be there with her
said for her to be there alone and you freaked
My, God, you're so stupid
(aside) didn't hit you,  lightly slapped you
You hit me
Look, don't ask me to participate in your crap if you don't like the way  do it
Ferris is incredulous at Cameron's stupidity
Cameron's anger is intensified by his embarrassment
was home, sick
You get me out of bed, being me over here, make me jeopardize my future, make me do a phoney phone call on a dean of students, a man who could squeeze my nuts into oblivion and then you deliberately hurt my feelings
didn't deliberately hurt your feelings
Oh, really
Yeah, really
Cameron glares at Ferris
Hey, Ferris
Have a nice life
He turns and heads out of the room
Ferris sighs
Cameron
Stick it up your ass, Ferris
Cameron, 'm sorry
didn't mean to jam you
It was uncalled for
Cameron stops
You're serious
He turns around
Dead serious
Cameron smiles
He appreciates Ferris apology
Thanks
You did screw up through, right
Not that is was necessarily all you fault
Right
(suspiciously) Why
To fix this situation, 'm going to have to ask you for a small favor
Cameron's jaw drops
84
84 The door opens slowly, dramatically as we hear a heraldic fanfare
Light streams in to reveal Cameron and Ferris looking at the car
Ferris is smiling with excitement and awe
Cameron is frowning with trepidation and fear
The prancing black stallion
We move up from the stallion to the erotic red hood of a 1958 Ferrari 250  California
Cameron's face is ashen
The end of the world is at hand
Ferris is in heaven
(grim monotone) 1958 Ferrari 250  California
Less than a hundred were made
It has a market value of $265,000
My father spent three years restoring it
It is joy, it is his love, it is his passion
It is his fault he didn't lock the garage
Ferris, my father loves this car more than life itself
We can't take is out
man with priorities so far out of whack doesn't deserve such a fine automobile
He never drives it, Ferris
He just rubs it with a diaper
We can't pick up Sloane in your car, Cameron
Rooney'd never believe Mr
Peterson drives that piece of shit
It's not a piece of shit
It's a piece of shit
Don't worry about it
don't even have a piece of shit
have to envy yours
Look, 'm sorry but there's nothing else we can do
He knows the mileage, Ferris
He has it tatooed on his wrist
He doesn't trust you
No
Alright, look, this is real simple
He puts his arm around Cameron
Whatever miles we put on it, we'll take off
(suspicious) How
(big, proud smile) We'll drive home backwards
Cameron shakes his head, no
Forget it
'm putting my foot down, Ferris
You'll have to think of something else
Cameron's protests are drowned out by the distinctive roar of the twelve cylinders
' You're not talking me into this one
have to live with the man
'm sorry but
The roar of the engine is overtaken by the sound of a crowded school hallway
85
85 She comes out of a classroom
She stops as Sloane and Rooney walk past
Sloane has her coat on and she's carrying her books
Jeanie watches her suspiciously
86
86 The Ferrari is parked out in front
The top is down
87
87 Ferris is driving
He's wearing a man's hat and sunglasses
Cameron's in the back
Are you crazy
Put the top back up
This is perfect top-down weather
What about Rooney
Cameron, the more obvious we are, the less likely we are to get caught
That makes no sense whatsoever
The adult mind is a suspicious machine
(look around at Cameron) Stay down, man
Cameron squeezes himself lower
Howcome it's my Dad's car and 'm taking all the risk and  have to ride back here
don't have an explanation
88
88 Rooney and Sloane come out the door
Once again let me say how deeply saddened  am by your loss
Huh
Were you close to your grandmother
Oh
Um
Yeah
Very
She was a terrific lady
Very hip
Very old
Yeah
Oh, Sloane
Dear
Sloane looks across at the Ferrari
Rooney looks
Ferris is looking out across the roof of the Ferrari
He's careful to keep his nose and mouth below the roofline
Hurry along now
Rooney's suspicious
Sloane smiles and bids Rooney a hasty farewell
guess that's my Dad
Thanks
See ya
She hurries to the car
Rooney watches her
Something does compute for him
89
89 She's watching out the door
She sees the Ferrari pull away
90
90 He can't quite put his finger on what's bothering him
91
91 Sloane shrieks with delight
She leans across the console and gives Ferris a kiss
This is so great
can't believe it
Right in front of Rooney
She laughs and turns to Cameron
Hi, Cameron
You comfortable
Hi
No
What a fabulous car
Enjoy it quick
It' s going home
It was risky, it was bold but it was totally necessary
What're we gonna do
The question isn't "what are we gonna do", the question is "what aren't we going to do
" Don't tell me we're not going to take the car home
Please
(to ) If you had access to a car like this would you take it back right away
Would you give up feeling like a ton just to ease your best friend's tension
He smiles
Either would
92
92 It accelerates away like a shot
93
93 fresh, modern bank building
The clock outside read 9:53
The Ferrari pulls into the parking lot
94
94 Ferris, Cameron and Sloane walk in
Ferris is cocky and confident
Sloane's still intoxicated with her freedom
Cameron's having stomach trouble
Ferris leads the way to an open teller window
about seventy with a silver blue beehive
It's about four inches higher the highest beehive you're ever seen
As she moves the beehive hits a small sign over her head
She's been at the bank since they opened
She smiles when she sees Ferris
Ferris Bueller
He's at the window
On either shoulder are Cameron and Sloane
Ferris smiles
Cameron blanches
Hello, Mrs
Froeling
How are you
She pats the rock-solid mass of blue hair
In doing so she locates a missing ball point pen
She withdraws it from the hair and smiles at it's reappearance
passed a kidney stone Tuesday, so 'm a little pooped but other than that, 'm as chipper as can be
(something occurs to her) Say, should you be in school
He lays his savings bonds on the counter
Me
(polite laugh) 'm out of school, Mrs
Froeling
In fact
'm married
This is my wife
Madonna
Sloane suppresses a laugh
(to Cameron) And this is my brother-in-law, Top
, this is Mrs
Froeling
Cameron isn't amused
(to Cameron) Is Top a Slavic name
Yeah
'd like to cash these in, please
We're having a baby and we need the cash for a crib, clothes, diapers, food pellets, leash, water dish
Mrs
Froeling takes the bonds with a hearty smile
The latter part of the conversation sails over her like a line drive
baby
(to Sloane) You must be so excited
Cameron groans and turns away from the sham
'm thrilled, ma'am
'm especially looking forward to wearing those jeans with the stretch panel in front
Mrs
Froeling thumbs through the bonds
Are you hoping for a boy or a girl
Actually, we're hoping for a car
He's spooked by the games playing
He scans the bank nervously
He blinks, focuses, blinks again
Joyce is with a -  and their bored, sour-puss teenage son,
He's sitting in a chair with his legs slung over the sides waving a Bic lighter back and forth across his rump
The parents are Joyce's clients from Vermont
is discussing the local financing situation with them
His is an open office adjacent to the teller windows
Joyce's back is to the tellers
It's like he's just witnesses an ax murder
Shit
Her back is to the teller windows
She's conducting her meeting
Behind her we see Cameron grab Ferris and point her out to him
He waves
Cameron slaps his arm
Mrs
Froeling shows Ferris the savings bonds
These bonds aren't mature
If you hold onto them another two years you'll get an additional four dollars
'm aware of that
You're throwing away four dollars
No, ma'am, 'm giving it to the government
They need it
Do you know what an aircraft carrier's going for these days
She concludes her meeting
She shakes hands with the loan officer and stands
The Vermont Couple stands
Boyd scrapes the bottom of his shoe on the desk, leaving a glob of mud behind and he stands
Joyce turns into the bank
Ferris, Cameron and Sloane are gone
She escorts her customers out
Joyce and the Vermont Couple approach the doors
Boyd lays a luggie in the drinking fountain
Mrs
Froeling passes with the savings bonds
She stops when she sees Joyce
Mrs
Froeling, how are you
passed a kidney stone Tuesday
(shifts gears, to Joyce) Say, you must be very proud
Joyce doesn't know what she's talking about
(whispers) met Madonna
She pats Joyce on the arm
She told me everything
Keep me posted, 'll want to send a gift
She toodles on her way
Joyce and the Vermont Couple are completely baffled
95
95 Joyce and the Vermont Couple walk along the side of the bank, heading for the parking lot
Boyd's tagging along behind
He picks up a stone and hurls it into the parking lot
My son's home sick today
If you wouldn't mind, on our way back to the office, 'd like to just run in and check up on him
We
as Boyd's missle hits a car
Of course
They pass a show window
As they pass, we hold on the window
It's promoting saving for college educations mannequin father is congratulating his mannequin son in a mortar and gown as a stiff Sloane, Ferris and Cameron look on proudly
96
'                                            96 His secretary is dialing a number for him
This is the Peterson's home
She hands the phone to Rooney
Watch your mouth this time
Rooney glares at her
Ferris Bueller's behind this
There's no doubt in my mind
That's what  was saying this morning
Why he has to be stopped
He's got Sloane Peterson involved in this thing now
See
The secretary nods
And her grandmother, too
97
97 It clicks on
We hear a grieved woman's voice
It sounds an awful lot like Sloane
We can't come to the phone right now
We've had a death in the family
If you need to reach us we'll be at the following number
98
'                                            98 Rooney quickly takes down a number
99
'                                          99 His answering machine clicks on
We hear Cameron's voice
' You have reached the Coughlin Bros
Mortuary
We are unable to come to the phone right now but if you'll leave your name and number
100
'                                           100 Rooney hangs up the phone
Something's going on, goddamn it
The secretary's looking at a newspaper on Rooney's desk
She's not listening to him
There's a railroad strike
And 'm going to stop it
My brother-in-law'll appreciate it
Rooney looks at her, puzzled
What
My brother-in-law rides the train to work
Rooney stares at her like she's crazy
Who gives a good goddamn
101
101 The major thoroughfare into the city of Chicago from the suburbs
The Ferrari streaks past
In the distance we see the Sears Tower, the Hancock Building and the Standard Oil Building
102
102 Jeanie's walking down the hall
She's stopped by a  with a Coke can
Yo
We're collecting money to buy Ferris Bueller a new kidney
Jeanie stares at him
She's flabbergasted at the proportions her brother's scan has reached
They run about fifty g's so it you could help out
Go piss up a flagpole
Huh
She knocks the can out of his hands and storms down the hall
The kid yells after her
Hey, babe
Some day you might need a favor from Ferris Bueller
Then where'll you be
He reaches for the can
Heartless wench
103
103 The Ferrari pulls into a large parking garage
Ferris, Sloane and Cameron get out
Cameron's having fits
We can't leave the car here
Why not
Because we can't
want it back home where it belongs
What could happen to it
It could get stolen, wrecked, scratched, you name it
'll give the guy a five to watch it
What guy
He smiles with relish at the car
6'6", 240
An  that equals his hourly wage
Shoulder-length hair stuffed into a hairnet Gold teeth
Earring
Goatee
The Attendant swaggers over to the car
Ferris slips him a give
You speak English
Since  was three
Great
want to you take extra special care of this vehicle, okay
He pats the Attendant on the arm
He smiles
Like it's a beautiful woman
appreciate it
The Attendant very gingerly gets into the car
Ferris turns to Cameron
The Ferrari pulls into the lot very slowly, very carefully
No squealing tires, no revving engine
See what a finski can do to a person's attitude
He's going to treat it like a beautiful woman
Yeah, sure
Whip it with a stick and piss on the hood
Oh, please, Cameron
Do you have to be so graphic
She heads down the street
This is so right
Ferris nudges Cameron on
They exit the garage and head after Sloane
long beat and the Ferrari creeps down the exit ramp of the garage
It's gone in the entrance and out the exit
Another attendant jumps in the passenger side
He's skinny, tall, with a huge knit hat willed with dreads
He lets out a spirited laugh and the Ferrari peels out of the lot
It heads down the street away from Sloane, Ferris and Cameron
104
'                                           104 Joyce's care pulls in the driveway
She gets out and heads up the house
105
'                                            105 It's dark
There's a figure in the bed
We hear soft snoring
wire runs from under the bed covers to the closet door to the door to the room itself
The wire is tied to the doorknob
It's taut
Downstairs, we hear a door open and close
106
106 Joyce quietly walks up the stairs
107
107 Joyce comes up the stairs and crosses to Ferris' room
She listens at the door
Joyce slowly turns the doorknob and pushes the door open a crack
The door opens and the figure-like lump in the bed moves
She smiles and closes the door
108
108 The closet door is open
The wire from the bedroom door is strung over the top of the closet door
trophy is attached to the end of the wire and it's resting on a yard stick
As the bedroom door closes, the trophy lifts up off the yardstick and the lump in the bed goes back down to it's original position
' Little 's are lighting up to the rhythm of the snoring
The snoring it simulated
109
109 Joyce listens at the door another beat
She's smiles with relief and affection
110
110 moves in on the world's tallest building
As it passes we see three figures pressed against the windows
() This is the world's tallest building
From our vantage point here on the 103 floor, we are provided with a view of four states
() Do you think the car's alright
() Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and my personal favorite, Indiana
111
111 Ferris, Cameron and Sloane are standing against the window
don't feel good, Ferris
Are we gonna stay long
Take a step back
Ferris steps back
Sloane and Cameron follow suit
Now, lean against the glass
Like this
He leans forward, putting all his weight on his forehead
And look down
Sloane leans forward
Cameron follows, reluctantly
Oh, shit
The street far, far below
dizzying view
The three are leaning against the glass
What if the glass gives
Death
Cool
He's looking down
think  see my Dad
112
112 middle-aged man, Cameron's father,  , is standing on the street corner
He's lean, clean, tough and humorless
He's wearing a puzzled look on his face
' think  see my car
The Ferrari screams down the avenue and disappears down the underground ramp
113
113 Ferris and Sloane bound down the escalator
Cameron follows glumly
They dance past the giant Calder mobile
They're singing
' ' ,   ' 114
114 Ferris and Sloane burst out the doors garnering the annoyed stares of the business people busily going in and out of the building
Cameron politely waits his turn to exit
Ferris and Sloane head down the street
Cameron follows
115
115 Giant old monolith
116
116 Traders are frantically buying and selling commodities
117
117 Ferris, Cameron and Sloane are sitting in the gallery watching the proceedings
Do you love me
Do you love me
asked you first
Yes
You
Yes
Would  trash a day of education to be with you if  didn't love you
Yes
Would  risk damaging a deep and wonderfully enriching relationship with my parents if  didn't love you
Yes
Would  have introduced you as my wife if  didn't love you
Wait a minute
That was a lie
True
Ferris puts his arm around Sloane
Would you want to get married mean if  wasn't an asshole
Sure
(serious) Today
Sloane stares at him
Is he serious
'm game
No way
'll do it, if you will
Cameron suddenly adds his two cents
You need a blood test
Ferris looks around at him
Huh
If your blood's not compatible, you could produce a pinhead
The state requires a blood test
So
So, you can't get married today
Tomorrow
If you get a blood test today
'm not getting married
'm with you, babe
Why not
What do you mean, why not
Think about it
Besides being too young and your father hating my guts and not having any place to live and feeling awkward about being the only cheer- leader with a husband, give me a good reason why not
'll give you two
My mother and father
Ferris and Sloane look at him curiously
They're married and they hate each other
(to Ferris) You've seen them
Am  right
You're father's a toad and your Mom's always wired out, but so what
They're old
That's natural
It makes me puke
Seeing people treat each other like that
It's like the car
He loves the car
He hates his wife
My parents are divorced
So what
It's not like it doesn't happen ten thousand times a day
Just because it happens doesn't make it right
Are you comfortable with it
No
It's not something  can get comfortable with
've tried
Are yours divorced
They may as well be
Do you think they're staying together because of you
Cameron hasn't seen it that way
He shrugs
Do they like you
It hasn't occured to Cameron that his parents might not like him
That parental love might not be a given
Yeah
Sure
Consider this
my father canned me and my brother and my Mom for a twenty five year old dipso with fake tits
He dropped us like a rock
Everything was cool at our house
thought so
We all thought so
Then
It's over
(to ) This is all news to me
She keeps a pretty good secret
(to Cameron) It was pure selfishness
When  have a kid,  don't care how much  want something, if it's gonna screw-up the kid, forget it
(to ) She's not lying
You could change
Yeah
But 'm gonna try not to
'm gonna think about it
'm gonna try to prevent it
This is optomism
It's a common trait with my age group
Adults think it's cute, it's like a charming quick that infests youth
But it's a cool thing and  think, deep down, crusty old shits wish they had some
They wish they had her, too
(points to Sloane) Sorry
She's taken
'd rather not have my family break apart, thank you
Well, you know what
It ain't up to you
It's out of your hands
So,  in other words,  should just sit back and watch it crumble
You're merely an inhabitant in their universe
Frightening choice of words
They call the shots
When you split from them, you call the shots
So, you're saying  should run away
No
She's saying it's time for lunch
What
Let's go feed Cameron
They stand up and head out
Ferris hangs back a moment
He cups his hands to his mouth
He yells at the top of his voice
And he exits

Ferris is looking at the maitre 'd's reservations book
His fingers runs down to a party of three for 12:00
The maitre'd returns
' (to Ferris) May  help you
Yes
'm Abe Frohman
Party of three for 12:00
The maitre'd looks at Ferris curiously
Is there a problem
' You're Abe Frohman
'm Abe Frohman
' (chuckles) 'm sorry, son
'm very busy right now
If you have trouble finding the door
Sloane tugs Ferris' sleeve
He ignores her
Are you suggesting that 'm not who  say  am
' Shall  call the police
Let's go
Abe
'm not going anywhere
(to the Maitre'd) Call the police
Go ahead
Better yet
(grabs the phone) 'll call myself
Cameron chokes
Sloane grits her teeth
The maitre'd smiles smuggly
Ferris punches out a number
beat and the restaurant's second line lights up and the phone rings
The maitre'd motions for the phone so that he can answer the call
Ferris waves him off angrily
You touch me and  yell "rat
" There's another phone around here
Find it
The maitre'd backs off
Ferris, let's split, please
Cameron's right
We're gonna get busted
Not a chance in the world
He hands the phone to Sloane
Ask for Abe Frohman
Ferris, Sloane and Cameron are seated in the restaurant
The maitre'd is hovering over Ferris
' appreciate your understanding
Don't grovel, Charles
Just leave us to our repast and all will be forgotten
' Enjoy your luncheon
Thank you
The maitre'd backs away
Ferris smiles
Sloane is impressed
Cameron is flushed with nerves
Darling, you were wonderful
Oh, but  had a wonderful teacher
Cameron, dear friend
Cameron looks to Ferris
And you thought we wouldn't have any fun
Shame on you
Ferris disappears behind his menu

(mean, vicious) 'm gonna bust his buns
Why
What's the point
Why
Because 'm sick of the little dope
He manipulates my parents, he does whatever he wants, whenever he wants and he never gets nailed
(wicked pause) Well, babe, today 'm the hammer
She yanks angrily on the velcro strap on her sneakers
The straps rip off in her hand
think he's cute
Sweetie, it's an established fact that you have no taste
Ferris is not cute
He's not charming
He's not nice
He's not a wonderful person
He's an ignorant mule and the sooner everybody in this school comes to that realization the better off we'll all be
She displays the velcro straps to her friend
See
My brother strokes you, you sympathize with him,  get pissed off and this is what happens
Jeanie tosses the straps on the floor
Let me tell you something
study hard,  work hard, 'm polite, 'm considerate, 'm friendly and fair to all kinds of people
Except morons
try to be everything a good, decent person should be and you know what
Everybody thinks you're an asshole
Jeanie freezes with her next sentence pinned to her tongue
Excuse me
don't think you're an asshole
Who does
Her friend smiles sheepishly
Rachel
Jeanie's friend shrugs, wags her head, does everything but verbally confirm
Rachel's a dirt bag
Who else
don't know
Just forget it
Forget that everybody thinks 'm an asshole
Would you like everybody to think you're an asshole
Not everybody thinks you're an asshole
Mr
Rooney likes you
Oh, hey
That's exciting
fat fifty year old clod with
likes me
Jeanie shakes her head in disbelief
Would everybody be happier if maybe  were to die in a flaming car accident or something
Maybe if you didn't cat like and asshole
Am  acting like an asshole
didn't mean it that way
this a conspiracy to shit all over me or something
Is my brother behind this
Tell me if he is or 'll sock your tits
You really do have a problem, Jeanie
Me
have a problem
Somebody who threatens to sock people's tits has a problem
Alright
How about if  sock your face
Jeanie's friend gets up
Take a walk, Jeanie

123 Ferris is standing at the urinal
She's a person who views life as an ordeal that must be endured
Her body is a transport vehicle for her anger
don't know where she gets this shit
Basically, the family's pretty cool
He looks down at the urinal
wonder if everybody shoots at cigarette butts in urinals
Probably not many women
(continues) used to think that my family was the only one that had weirdness in it
It used to worry me
Then met Cameron and  saw how his family functioned
He zips this trousers and steps away from the urinal
Cameron's home life is really shit
He wasn't lying
That's why he's sick all the time
It really upsets him
What he said about his parents hating each other
refuse to sleep over at his house
His parents fight all the time
Even when 'm there
Is there anything worse than being at somebody's house when their parents are fighting
It's the absolute height of social discomfort
He checks his hair in the mirror
When they go after each other, Cameron tightens up
It's scary
He gets so wadded-up, you couldn't pry his buns apart with a crowbar
The thing with taking his old man's car
It's good for him
It teaches him to deal with his fear
Plus, and  must be honest here,  love driving it
highly recommend picking one up
He exists the men's room
We hold a beat
toilet flushes
Another beat and Tom walks out of the stall
He crosses to the sink

124 Cameron and Sloane have been served their lunches
They're staring at the plates
What is it
don't know
But it looks like it's already been eaten and digested
knew it was a mistake letting Ferris order for us
Ferris slides over to the table and drops into his seat
What are you doing
Cameron looks at Ferris
What is this shit
You got me
don't speak French
He puts his napkin in his lap and smells his plate
think it's a land-based beefoid creature
He takes a bite
He savors the taste
Splendid
Really
Superb
Cameron and Sloane try theirs
They chew tentatively
Good
Sloane and Cameron shrug
It's not bad
passes
Ferris stops him
Yo, Clouseau
The waiter stops and looks at Ferris indignantly
have a growth on my brain that causes memory lapses
Could you tell me what we ordered here
The waiter glances at the plates
Sweetbreads
Uh, huh
And what might that be
Pancreas
As in the gland that has important functions in digestion and metabolism
They stop chewing
They're holding their sweetbreads in their mouths
He continues his questioning
That secretes a thick, colorless fluid containing digestive enzymes
The home of the world famous isles of Langerhans
He nods broadly, knowing that he's spoiling the kids' meal
They look at each other
He pats his mouth with his napkin
He looks to Cameron and Sloane
He raises a finger, holds it a beat and gives a cue
He turns away as Sloane and Cameron spit out their food
He watches Sloane and Cameron then glances at the waiter
Check, please

We're gonna get nabbed, for sure
No way, Cameron
Only the meek get nabbed
The bold survive
Let's go
He turns to the cab
Sloane and Cameron turn slowly
Tom and his party are still jawing at curbside
Ferris, Sloane and Cameron slowly approach the cab
Behind the backs of the men, Ferris scoots Sloane into the cab
Cameron dashes in

class of kids walking along holding hands
Among the second graders are Ferris, Sloane and Cameron, holding hands looking like giant grade schoolers
Baby chicks are hatching in a huge, round incubator
Sloane, Ferris and Cameron are intently watching the process
Sloane, Ferris and Cameron ride in the coal train in the coal mine replica

Sloane operates a metal press to produce a tin ashtray
giant, walk-thru replica of a human heart
Ferris staggers out of it, clutching his heart, feigning a massive heart attack

He checks to see if he's being watched then he presses a button and pulls a lever
For the first time in forty years, the screw turns

boat is rolling up the man-made canyon
() Are you guys worried about nuclear war
() Cameron, it's a beautiful day, we've won our freedom, we're traveling down one of American's most scenic polluted waterways and you have to bring up nuclear war
() It is kind of raggy subject, Cam
() Regardless
It's with us every day
The possiblity of global destruction
() Don't you think it's an issue because people need something to worry about
They have to like, have some major problem that puts all their little bullshit into some kind of persepective
() Maybe
They used to have Viet Nam
They used to have the oil crisis stuff and Iran
That's over and people have to have their big issue
It's not like somebody came up with the nuclear holocaust yesterday at noon, you know
() To answer your question
No, 'm not worried about it at all
() We don't know when the bombs going off
We do know, however, that college starts in the fall
() (dramatic, deadly serious) Do you know what a nuclear winter is
Long beat
() Yeah
Everybody's dead, it's real cold and the skiing's for shit
The boat makes the turn in the river and
The three are sitting on the aft deck of the tour boat
Their feet are up on the railing
Very casual, very relaxed
Discussing the end of the world
My step-father's always going off about how when he was young he was committed to all these causes
He's full of shit
All the old hippies are full of shit
He says  don't care about things like he did
What's he care about now
Baldness, fatty meats and money
rest my case
What's spooky is they still control everything
They took over when they were young and they never gave it up
One of the most frightening experiences of my young life has been observing my parents and our neighbors playing the Baby Boom Edition of Trivial Pursuits
It's chilling to see people crazed with the minutia of their past
It's human nature to like what you had better than what you have
Agreed
loud speaker on the boat identifies a point of interest
' The three look to the left
, , , The Sears Tower
You know, this is all very interesting but 'm starving
An hour ago you wanted to yack
feel better now
Lean over and grab a fish

What comes after a nuclear winter
Nuclear spring

Hello, Jeanie
Who's bothering you now
Jeanie scowls at her

He suspects it's Ferris
It look sort of like Ferris

The blood evacuates his face
He stares at the girl
She stares at him
She picks up her Coke
She puts the straw to her lips and sucks
He's still staring
He can't think of anything to say
Holding the straw in the mouth, she draws it out of the cup
She raises it, pointing it directly in Rooney's face
He squints She blows a strawful of Coke in Rooney's face

Behind him is the kitchen and a grease-covered  set broadcasting a Cubs baseball game
There's a long foul ball
The  camera follows the ball into the stands
kid makes a stab at the ball
Rooney wipes his suit off
The  camera zooms in on the boy triumphantly holding the foul ball aloft
It's Ferris
He does a little celebration dance
Rooney wads up the napkin and tosses it in a trashbin
The  camera returns to the game
Rooney glances at the screen
What's the score
Zero to zero
Who's winning

On either side of him are Cameron and Sloane

Can we leave now
You want to leave
We just got here
You got a call, you broke your thumb, what's left to do
Cameron offers his nachos to Sloane
She looks at them with disgust
No wonder you're always sick

Riding atop on a float is Ferris

He and half a dozen homely German-American Beauty Queens
He's leading the girls in singing, " "
They're watching Ferris go by
They wave to him
love him
It's hard not to
Cameron breaks a smile
As worried as he is about the day and getting caught, he has to admire Ferris for his lack of inhabitions
Cameron mumbles a few words
Stop

Do you believe in reincarnation
Huh
Do you believe that you lived before
Yeah
Sort of

Ferris is on his knees, reaching down from the float, shaking hands with people in the crowd
Guten tag, dude
Sloane and Cameron continue their conversation
What were you in a previous life
'm not sure but  think  know who Ferris was
Hannibal
From the -Team
No
The guy who rode the elephants into Switzerland
Sloane laughs at herself
They step out of the crowd and head down the street in the direction the parade's heading
think if he was anybody, he was Magellan
You know, the guy who went around the world
Cameron nods
could see him ignoring popular belief and taking off on some impossible mission
Yeah
As long as 've known him, everything works for him
There's nothing he can't handle
can't handle anything
School, parents, the future
Ferris can do anything

They continue their conversation
The future's worse for a boy, isn't it
Cameron doesn't understand what she means
girl can always bail out and have a baby and get some guy to support her
That's a pretty grim thought
True, but it's an option
No options is worse
don't know what 'm gonna do
College
Yeah, but to do what
What are you interested in
Nothing
Me either
They walk on for a few beats
We  "  " The sons is taking over all the other tunes in the band

Mouth open, tongue out

Broad, excited smiles

This is Ed Rooney, Ferris
'd like to have a word with you
' 'm sorry  can't come to the door right now
'm very ill and 'm afraid that in my weakened condition, could take a nasty spill down the stairs and subject myself to further school absenses
There's a pause
Rooney presses the intercom again
Come down here
' You can reach my parents at their places of business
Thank you for stopping by
appreciate your concern for my well-being
It will be remembered long after this illness has past
His voice clicks off
Rooney presses the intercom again
'm not leaving until you come down and talk to me
' Have a nice day
Rooney presses the intercom
'm not leaving, Ferris
There's no response
Rooney rings the doorbell again
The pre-recorded litany starts over
' Who is it
Rooney doesn't realize that he's listening to a recording
Don't get smart with me Ferris
' 'm sorry  can't come to the door right now
'm very ill and 'm afraid that in my weakened condition

He can't quite figure out what's going on

, They're sitting in a booth in the garish, nearly deserted strip joint
Cameron's mouth is open in amazement
Sloane is embarrassed and revolted
How does she do that
One goes one way, one goes the other
She's probably schizophrenic
Ferris, this is nauseating me
Really
'm losing respect for you by the bucket
You don't think it's amazing that we got in
Who wants to get in
Cameron looks like a toddler, for Christ's sake
'm talking about a major achievement in false identification
'm not interested in watching someone jiggle their mammary glands
Point well taken
But consider why she does it
Why she does it and you don't
'm not a tramp
Maybe her life fell apart
Maybe she lost somebody
lover
boyfriend
parent
child
(to ) This kind of thing makes me a little depressed
You may think because 'm the age  am that 'm a sex maniac
That sex is all  think about
But that's not true
'm a romantic
think alot of people my age are
We think about love and matters of the heart
And  scores and acne aside, we worry about lonliness
It's a terrible thing
And we feel it feel it
He flips his collar up, curls his lip and affects an Elvis impression
sappy, do-wop track
The club lights go down
Cameron and Sloane disappear into darkness
Ferris stands up from the booth
He strolls slowly through the empty club as the stripper bumps and grinds in a pool of blue light
You know, someone said the world's a stage and each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love, with you as my sweetheart
Act one was when we met
loved you at first glance
You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two
You seemed to change
You acted strange
And why, 've never known
He climbs up on the little runway
The stripper disappears in darkness as Ferris takes over the spotlight
Honey, you lies when you said you loved me and  had no cause to doubt you
But 'd rather go on hearing your lies than to go on living without you
Now, the stage is bare and 'm standing there with emptiness all around and if you won't come back to me, then they can bring the curtain down
Elvis fades up
The orignal recording
Ferris lip synchs with the big, dramatic florish that was the King's trademark ballad sign-off

Ferris drops his head

The Attendant and the Rastaman are glowering at him
They're holding bags of fried chicken
You looking for something in my car

Ferris is on one window, Cameron on the other
Sloane's in the middle
Ferris is talking to the
So
He leans forward and reads the driver's name off the city license
So, Yuri, how long have you been in America
One year
What's your overall impression
It's very good here
Better than Russia
Much better here than in Russia
Clearly you've never been to an American high school
Ferris sits back
He puts his arm around Sloane
It's getting late, Ferris
have to get the car home
know you don't care, but it means my ass
You think  don't care
know you don't care
That hurts, Cameron
Jump back, Ferris, Cameron's been a good sport
Cameron, what'd you see today
Cameron looks at him
You saw four states, a submarine, a giant heart, seventy five dollars worth of cooked pancreas, two of the most incredible breasts ever to come out of modern plastics, major league baseball and
(quizical look) Are you gonna chuck your nachos
Cameron's staring past Ferris
He's frozen
Ferris realizes he's looking at something out the window
He turns
He freezes
In the gridlock traffic, their cab is squeezed tight alongside another cab
In that cab is Tom
He's about a foot from Ferris
He turns and looks right into
' Ferris' frozen face

He pauses
Looks up
Thinks
Turns back to

Fakes a yawn

Cameron and Ferris are on the floor
On their asses, with their backs to the back of the front seat, feet up on the seat

(revolted) He's looking at me and he's licking the glass and making obscene gestures with his hands
What
Sloane bursts out laughing
Roast
She licks her finger and touches Ferris knee
She makes a sizzling sound
She collapes on the seat in hysterics
' Tom's looking into Ferris' cab
Sloane's bouncing up and down

'm very ill and 'm afraid
' It's a recording, asshole
that in my weakened condition,  could take a nasty spill and subject What's your problem
myself to further school absenses
(pause) He's one of my students
You can reach my parents at their places of business
Thank you for Little bugger's dying
stopping by
appreciate your concern for my well- being
It will be What
remembered long after this illness has passed
As  heard it from our mailman he was supposedly born with only half a kidney
' Have a nice day
(to the intercom) Thank you
(continues) don't know the details
But my boss had to send to Milwaukee to get more orchids
He's very popular
Rooney is flabbergasted
Nobody's home here
No
You gonna be around for awhile
imagine so
You wanna keep an eye on these
Rooney looks at the flowers
Then he looks at the Delivery Man
(happy sigh) It really touches me that so many people are rallying behind this guy
guess there's hope for the human race afterall
He hands the arrangement to Rooney
Gotta run
He bounds off the porch and trots to the truck
Rooney looks incredulously at the arrangement
He opens the attached card
(defeated) Oh, Christ
It's signed: 155
155 The number one afternoon  rock'n roll
is sitting behind his microphone
don't know who that was or what they were playing but apologize for it nonetheless
(pause) have a guest with me today

156 He put his headphones on

'                                           157 Jeanie's car pull in the driveway
We hear her car radio
His name is Ferris Mueller
Bueller
Ferris Bueller
She goes into shock
Her eyes blink, her head cocks
Sorry about that
It's cool
Jeanie draws back and punches out her radio
The impact of her blow to the radio shoots the antenna in the air
158
158 Ferris leans forward and adjusts the microphone
He has an incredible story
Ferris turns to
'm going to tell a massive lie here
It's going to by very thick and very steamy
think radio's a facinating medium, it challenges the imagination
Unlike television which provides the images, radio
(pause) You know this
Anyway, it's always been a dream of mine to be on the radio
have what  consider to be an excellent broadcast voice
practise it in the bathroom all the time
used to play records and do introductions to them
But 've never had the chance to sit behind a microphone and try it out for real
This is a 50,000 watt outlet
'm going out to several million people so let me just say, 'm in a very pleasant groove right now
(clears his voice, speaks into the mike, affects a "radio" voice) Well, Steve, you and your listeners are probably not going to believe this but

' 'm the first Chicago area youth to be selected to participate in a space shuttle mission

160 Ferris turns from the mike to
was going to say  knew Springsteen's home phone number and  was going to give out the number of the New Jersey State Police but  thought might get busted
After  got flunked in driver's ed for sideswiping a mail box, which was not in any way, shape or from my fault
was putting out a cigarette, like  was told
It was weird
'm so used to getting in a car and lighting up, because 'm not allowed to smoke at home, that  got in the driver's ed
car and spaced completely, pulled out of the lot, lit up a 'boro and Mrs
Heller looked at me like 'd just pulled a bunny out of my nose or something and  realized what the hell  was doing and  went to put it out and hit the mail box
Anyway, was so pissed off at her reaction to the whole thing that  considered running an ad in a sleaze magazine for a school teacher that does phone sex and  was gonna use Mrs
Heller's home number but is cost too much
took it again and passed
But had to work at Burger King to get the cash to pay for the driver's ed
car
The car got fixed in auto shop for nothing and think Rooney pocketed the cash
But can't prove it
'm in high school, remember
He turns back to the
How did you get picked for this
It's kind of a long story but 've been doing alot of programming for 161
161 even larger group of kids is listening to the blaster
They're cheering him on

162 The Rottweiler is laying unconscious on the lawn
The flower arrangement is scattered all over the yard and the ceramic vase the flowers were in has obviously struck the dog
The broken pieces are all around the dog's head
He's smiling with great satisfaction
Sleep tight, pooch
He hears something in the house
His head snaps around
He drops down and peek in the windows
glimpse of a fleeting figure
His eyes dance in anticipation of revenge
163
'                                     163 Jeanie kicks the door open
The yardstick flings the covers and the pillows beneath them in the air
She stomps in and turns off the snoring synthesizer
knew it
She grabs the phone and sits down
She dials a number
164
164 Rooney sneaks around the side of the house
He slinks up on the porch
The front door's open
He peeks in
165
'                                            165 Jeanie's on the phone
Is Mrs
Bueller there
Where is she
This is her daughter
Do you know where she is
Do you know when she'll be back
Do you know anything
She slams the phone down
The worm has luck like clams have body odor
She's startled by a noise downstairs
smile spreads across her face
He's back and she's going to nail him
166
166 Rooney sneaks into the house
He looks around the foyer and heads into the kitchen
167
167 Jeanie tiptoes down the stairs
168
168 Rooney sneaks through the kitchen into the den
169
169 Jeanie comes down the stairs into the foyer

170 Rooney comes out of the den, back into the kitchen
He crosses back toward the foyer
171
171 Jeanie sneaks into the kitchen
172
172 Jeanie and Rooney come face-to-face
Jeanie squeals in horror
She doesn't recognize Rooney as himself but as an intruder
She drops into a karate stance and kicks Rooney in the face
He hits the deck
She flees back up the stairs

173 Boyd is sitting in the backseat of Joyce's car listening to the radio
' My input on the Star Wars defense plan was pretty substantial so guess this is their way of rewarding me
'm pretty flattered
Joyce and her clients leave a show house and head toward the car
Boyd looks out the window as his parents and Joyce appear
Can you stay around and take a few phone calls
' 'd really like to but  have a kidney operation in about an hour
Joyce and her clients take one last look at the house
If you're willing to commit a little time and a little money to this place, you can really have something to be proud of
Don't let the black living room throw you off
She opens the car door
The door opens
wish you the best of luck
' Thanks, Steve
very interesting guy, Ferris Bueller
Joyce gets in
The clients get in the other side
song starts
(to the kid) Well, Boyd, how are you bearing up
The kid stares at her
Did  tell you  have a son your age
Twice
His name is Ferris
think you'd like him
Boyd sits up in the seat at the mention of Ferris' name
Is he going up in the space shuttle in September
Joyce looks around at Boyd
She gives him a curious look
Not that  know of
knew he was bullshitting
Watch your mouth
How do you watch your mouth
Do you know my son
Don't pay any attention to him
He thinks it's cute to bait adults
don't think it's cute
think it's fun
Joyce give him a puzzled smile and starts the car
174
'                                            174 Jeanie's on the phone
She's in a panic
This is not a phoeny phone call
There's an intruder, male caucasian, possibly armed, certainly weird, in our kitchen
(pause) My name is Bueller
There's another pause
Jeanie's face drops
It's real nice that you hope my brother's feeling better but 'm in danger, okay
'm very cute, 'm very alone and 'm very protective of my body
'd rather not have it violated or killed
need help
175
175 Rooney's plugging his bloody nose with paper towel
The intercom goes on
' Excuse me
If whoever's in the house is still in the house, 'd like you to know that  have just called the police
If you have any brains whatsoever, you'll get your ass out of my house real quick
Rooney stiffens with fear
' 'd also like to add that  have my father's gun
And a scorching case of herpes
176
176 Rooney's car is hooked to a tow truck
It's parked in front of a fire hydrant and the windshield is decorated with parking citations
In the distance
177
177 The three are waiting for the Ferrari
We ,   -
Then the Ferrari pulls down the ramp and jams to a frightening stop
jumps out
Ferris hands him the parking stub
Just out of curiosity, what was your top speed coming down the ramp
(matter-of-fact) About 60
Stunning
He hands him a buck and opens the door and pulls the passenger seat forward for Cameron
This is probably the last time you'll have to ride back here
Keep that in mind
Cameron gives him a look and squeezes in
178
178 The Ferrari cruises through traffic
Sloane's in the passenger seat
Ferris is driving and Cameron is crammed in the back
What's next
Nothing
We return the car
We could go to my house
My parents aren't coming home until late
We have enough cash left for a quick flight to Peoria and back
Very funny
Ferris looks in the mirror and changes lanes
He glances down at the speedometer, then to the road
And back to the speedometer
Cameron
How many miles did you say this thing had when we left
One hundred and twenty six and halfway between three and four tenths
Why
How many miles are on it now
He glances down at the speedometer
The odometer reads 432
7
(to ) Here's where Cameron goes berserk
The Ferrari pulls up at a stop light
We   , The Ferrari is buzzing through traffic
Sloane turns in her seat and looks at Cameron
Her gesture is one of genuine support
You okay
His eyes are frozen in a mindless, vacant stare
He looks at Sloane
He's concerned
Hey, Cameron
It's okay
We'll fix it
He's still holding the stare
He starts to breathe heavily
He's trembling
She whips around in the seat and grabs his arms
Cameron
Cut it out
What's wrong
Ferris
He shoots Sloane a look
Cameron, are you okay
It's no problem, really
Your old man won't know a thing
It's completely fixable
Sloane fires an angry look at Ferris
Shut-up
It is a problem
For him it's a problem
Nothing's a problem for you
But it's a problem for him
So, just shut-up
She turns back to Cameron
What can  do, Cameron
Eyes front
He knows what he's doing
179
'
179 The doorbell rings
The Ferris' tape is activated
Who is it
We hear a   over the intercom
Anybody home
' 'm sorry that  can't come to the door right now
The tape continues as Jeanie hurtles down the stairs
'm saved
Thank you, God
Thank you, thank you, thank you
She jumps the last few stairs and slides to the front door
She whips it open
180
180 The door swings open
Thank
you
Her jaw goes slack
She blinks her eyes
The Delivery Man and a young  are standing at the door with floral arrangements
Spread all around them are more flowers
sexy singing  and a   steps up on the porch

181 Rooney's walking down the street
school bus is crawling alongside him as kids hang out the windows
From inside we hear  and seventeen different top forty montage
Hey, Mr
Rooney
What're you doing
Rooney doesn't respond
Did you get in a fight
Rooney keep walking
The bus doors open
The  calls out to him
You want a lift
Rooney takes a few more steps
He stops
The bus stops
Rooney takes a deep breath
He climbs aboard the bus
182
182 The bus is jammed with  and
The passengers are silent as they watch Rooney shuffle down the aisle and take an empty seat next to a skinny, myopic
She looks at Rooney and smiles
She pushes her Coke bottle glasses up on her nose
He looks vacantly at her
She holds her smile
'll bet you never smelled a real school bus before
He stares at her
She holds up a candy package
Gummi Bear
He stares at her
She puts one in her mouth
They've been in pocket
They're real soft and warm
rotund   sitting across from Rooney is staring at him
He looks across to the kid
He leans forward
It's kind of like being in the belly of the beast isn't it
He turns him eyes to the front
The bus jerks forward and pulls away

184 Cameron's laying on a picnic table
Sloane's sitting beside him on the table
She's stroking his hair
Ferris He addresses
This may very well be for real think Cameron might have blown a micro-chip or two
He's always been a little keyed-up
All  wanted to do was give him a good day
We're gonna graduate in a couple of months
Then we have the summer
He'll work and 'll work
And we'll see each other at night and on the weekends but then he'll go to one school and 'll go to another
And basically that'll be it
As much as we like each other, the process of growing up will separate us
He begins to walk
We follow him
Sloane's a bigger problem
She still has another year of high school
How do  deal with that
was serious when said 'd marry her
would
This isn't just teenage infatuation
That's what my parents call it
What do they call what they have
If that's love, 'll take infatuation
His eyes are closed
Sloane's stroking his hair
() Cameron's never been in love
At least no one's ever been in love with him
He's gonna marry the first girl he lays
And she's gonna treat him like shit because he's gonna kiss her ass for giving him what he's built-up in his mind as the end-all, be-all of human existance
She won't respect him because you can't respect someone who kisses your ass
It just doesn't work
She's studying Cameron's face
She looks away
Ferris
He looks to the picnic table
Then back to
'm being tested here
He starts back to the picnic table
My best friend has flipped-out
Conventional wisdom would suggest a visit to the nearest trauma center
wouldn't fault anybody for doing that
My, personally, think this calls for something new, something bold, something wet and wild
185
185 hyrdojet spews a gush of air bubbles
finger pushes the  button on the cassette The finger pops a beer
painted fingernail pierces the cellophane wrapper
Ferris and Sloane are in Sloane's parents' Jacuzzi
Their clothes are tosssed around the deck
Cameron's been placed in a patio chair at the edge of the Jacuzzi
He's still catatonic
He's mummbling softly
Ferris is drinking a beer
Sloane's eating Oreos
You feeling any better, Cameron
The water's really nice
wish you'd come in
Staring into space
Surgery
fire
move
They look at each other
She offers him a cookie
He offers her his beer
Cameron
Do you think this because of the car or is it a combination of everything shitty in your life
He doesn't respond
Music
kiss
attack
Sloane sips the beer
You just can't deal with anymore shit
The car took you into the red zone
Time for a reality check
Cameron
could flip real easy, too
There's nothing wrong with it
At one time or another, everybody goes to the zoo
Maybe he was actually sick
Maybe he wasn't bullshitting himself
No response
Gesundheit
God
mercy
Ferris and Sloane watch their catatonic friend
He smiles
She leans forward and stares at Cameron
He cocks his head, wondering what Cameron's up to
He keels over forward
Cameron falls out of the chair and splashes down, face-first, into the water
Sloane screams
Ferris leaps for him
Ferris struggles with Cameron's lifeless bulk
She's screaming
Ferris thrashes around in the water
Ferris grabs Cameron's collar and rips him out of the water
Ferris sits Cameron on the edge of the Jacuzzi
His eyes are closed
He's lifeless
His face is a mask of terror
He shakes Cameron
She's screaming
smile spreads across his face
He sees the smile
He stops shaking Cameron
Ferris and Cameron are looking at each other
Sloane's still screaming
She realizes that Cameron's okay
She stops screaming
What
(Cameron) You asshole
Cameron's smiling
What
Ferris starts to laugh
Cameron explodes with laughter
Sloane's bewildered
What's so funny
186
186 Jeanie's sitting on a wooden bench with a in a Triumph t-shirt, long hair, torn jeans, creepers, studs and chains
He's studying her
Drugs
No, thank you
'm straight
meant, are you here for drugs
Jeanie stares at him
Why are you here
Drugs
don't know why 'm here
Then why don't you go home
Why don't you put your thumb up your butt
The boy stares at her
You want to talk about your problem
With you
Are you serious
Yeah, 'm serious
Blow yourself
Jeanie turns away
The boy crosses his legs
Jeanie looks back at him
You really want to know what's wrong
The boy shrugs
Alright
If you've got the time, 've got the troubles
In a nutshell, hate my brother
How's that
That's cool
Did you shoot him or something
No, not yet
The boy nods
He understands the emotion
went home to confirm that the shithead was ditching school and a guy broke into the house and called the cops and they picked me up for making a phoney phone call
What do you care if your brother ditches school
Jeanie stares at the boy
Why should he get to ditch school when everybody else has to go
You could ditch
'd get caught
So, you're pissed at him because he ditches and doesn't get caught
Basically
The boy nods knowingly
Then your problem is you
Excuse me
Excuse you
You oughta spend a little more time dealing with yourself and a little less time worrying about what your brother does
It's just an opinion
Jeanie stares angrily at him
Partly because he's so bold and partly because he's so right
There's somebody you should talk to
Jeanie stares at him threateningly
If you say Ferris Bueller, you lose a testicle
You know him
' It curls into a fist
187
187 It's spinning rapidly
brick's resting on the accelerator, holding it down
' Ferris, Cameron and Sloane are sitting in the garage
The Ferrari is jacked up
The wheels are turning
The engine's racing
The whole time  was just thinking things over
was like, meditating
was thinking about the future
And  realized it doesn't make and difference if the present goes to shit
have a agree with you there
Really
've been thinking all day that if you could only have the use of one word, what would it be
Sloane is naked before your eyes and you're thinking about words
God bless you, Cameron
Thank you, Sloane
If you guys only had one word, what would it be
can't believe you'd think up something like with a naked girl in a jacuzzi right in front of you
Come on, Ferris, answer his question
Bathroom
'd say
She thinks
Cash
It's the only word you could ever use
Hello
Love
And what is you loathe somebody
Are you going to say "love" every time you see them
It's better than "hello"
Hellos' generic
You wanna be generic
It's help
Cameron smiles at his wisdom
Ferris and Sloane think about it
It's a good choice
Cameron gets up and walks to the Ferrari
The word is help
Cameron peeks in the window
Nothing's happening
Cameron pulls his head out of the car
Ferris
It's not working
Ferris looks up
The miles aren't coming off, running it in reverse
thought that might be a problem
Let's crack open the odometer and roll it back by hand
Cameron shakes his head
got a better idea
It's cool
He walks back around behind the Ferrari
Seventeen years and 've never taken a stand
Now, 'm gonna do it
'm taking a stand against my father, against my family, against myself, against my past, my present and my future
will not sit idly by as events that affect me unfold to change the course of my life
will take a stand and will defend it
When my father comes home tonight, he's finally going to have to deal with me
Good or bad, 'm taking a stand
He turns to
This is a big -2 fan
She smiles proudly at Cameron
She applauds him
He's serious and determined
He has made up his mind and it appears that it won't be changed by anyone but himself
It's spinning wildly
Cameron's foot rests on the bumper
beat and it gives a mighty shove
The spinning tires slam down on the cement
Cameron has kicked the Ferrari off the jack
It squeals out of the garage in a cloud of blue tire smoke
$50,000 unmanned investment heading backwards down a driveway
They're in shock
The Ferrari shoots down the driveway
Cameron watches the car go
He's strangely placcid about the impending disaster
Ferris and Sloane are bewildered
The Ferrari travels down the driveway, across the street, over the curb into the wooded property opposite the house
The Ferrari's brief journey ends as it smacks a tree trunk
Ferris and Sloane exchange baffled looks
They look at Cameron
He's proud and bold
What was that about
This has to be a dream
Cameron
One quick question
Why'd you do that
Cameron holds his proud posture for a beat
Then a look of bewilderment comes over his face
He shoots a look to Ferris
puzzled look
You trashed the car
Cameron looks across the street
Why
took a stand
No, Cameron
You wrecked a car
Cameron thinks for a moment
Then he regains his confidence
It's okay
Ferris looks across the street at the car
have an idea
If you're interested
Cameron looks at him
He shakes his head
'm gonna handle it
think this could work
No, thanks
want to deal with it by myself
What about your one word
You already did it
If  need it again, 'll use it
He smiles
He raises am impish eyebrow
It's cool
'm loose

188 Joyce is talking with the juvenile officer
Outside the office, on the bench, we see Jeanie and the boy making out
She's never been in trouble before
This is a shock to me
First, don't know why she wasn't at school
Second,  don't know why she'd call you with this story about a rapist
For whatever reasons she did it, think she'd had a good scare
hope so
appreciate your calling me
can assure you that her father and  will have a long talk with her
The gathers her purse and jacket and stands
Thank you
Oh, by the way,  hope you son's feeling better
Joyce looks at the officer curiously
Tell him, all the guys at the station here are pulling for him
189
189 Jeanie quickly breaks the embrace with the boy as Joyce steps out of the juvenile officer's room
She's still a little bewildered that everybody knows Ferris was ill
Jeanie wipes her lips and sits up straight
The boy adjusts his pants to better hide his passion
(to the boy) If you keep this to yourself, think we can probably get it on pretty good
For sure
Jeanie stands up
Hi
Don't "hi" me, young lady
Get your stuff
Jeanie reaches down for her purse
What's your name
Jean
What's yours
Garth Volbeck

'                                       190 Sloane and Ferris are standing at the back fence
had a great time today
Yeah
It was pretty cool
You think Cameron's gonna be alright
Sure
He had to so it,  guess
His old man had it coming
He'll be okay
'd be worried if he'd taken my idea
Sloane smiles knowingly
You didn't have an idea, did you
Not a glimmer
You're so smart
No
'm just real loose
He kisses her
'll call you tonight
Sloane nods
Ferris jumps the fence and takes off across the backyards
Sloane watches him go
huge smile spreads across her face
She backs away from the fence
He's gonna marry me
know it
She turns and runs into the house

191 Ferris sprints across a backyard
He jumps a plaster elf
192
192 Ferris vaults a fence
He runs directly for a swimming pool
He's approaching it from the side
He leaps, hits the diving board, springs off, does a flip and lands on the grass on the other side of the pool

193 Neatly bundles stacks of bills and rolled coins significant amount of cash
She's writing
We see a portion of the typewritten letter as she signs it

in the amount of $1,765

car honks
Ferris moves to the side
The car pulls around him
Tom's at the wheel
He glances in the mirror
He does a take
We see Ferris cut across a front lawn and into a house
He realizes it couldn't be Ferris
195
195 Ferris runs through the kitchen, past a , fixing dinner and out her backdoor
The Woman looks up curiously
196
'                                           196 Tom pulls in the driveway
He parks and gets out
Joyce pulls in from the other direction

197 Ferris tries the door
It's locked
He reaches down and lifts the doormat
The outline of a key in the dirt under the mat
The key's gone
The toe of a chewed-up dress shoe steps
An He stares up in horror
Rooney's looking down at him
He's holding the house key
Ferris stands up
He smiles
Looking for this
Yes
got you, Ferris
This time  finally got you
Ferris is caught
There's no way out
Rooney gloats severely
How does another year of high school sit with you
Suddenly, the backdoor opens
Jeanie looks out
She feigns joy and relief
She rushes Ferris and hugs him
Thank God, you're alright
We've been worried sick
moment of curiosity
Then it dawns on him what's happening
He smiles
His eyes dart from Ferris to Jeanie to Ferris
His victory is evaporating
Jeanie breaks the embrace
(to Rooney) Thank you for bringing him home, Mr
Rooney
(to Ferris) You better get up in bed tight now
Ferris limps into the house
Can you imagine someone as sick as Ferris trying to walk home from the hospital
(shakes her head) Kids
He's dumbfounded
She raises her hands and strikes a karate pose
huge smile passes over her face
look of terror as he realizes that is was Jeanie who kicked him and that Jeanie knows it was he who she kicked
Jeanie steps into the house
198
198 The door closes on Rooney's defeated, lost, dejected, bewildered face
Not only has he lost Ferris again, he has Jeanie to deal with next year
199
199 The click of the door wakes him up
His head pops up off the grass
He senses new danger
We hear
Rooney squeezes his eyes shut

200 Kimberly and Todd are sitting at the kitchen table watching and eating cereal
They look up at Ferris as he comes in from outside
Ferris
Does my head look like it's getting bigger
Ferris leans against the counter as he tries to catch his breath
He looks at his little brother
No, but Kimberly's is
He crosses to the refrigerator and opens it
Kimberly feels her head
(to Todd) Is he serious
think so
Oh, shit
Ferris takes out a bottle of orange juice out of the refrigerator and drinks straight from the bottle
Jeanie comes in
Thanks, Jeanie
No problem
By the way,  borrowed some cash from you
'll pay you back
You don't have to
want to
You don't have to
've been ripping off your wallet for years
Ferris gives her a proud smile

(to Todd and Kimberly) Hi, guys
Is my head swelling up

203 The foyer is jammed with floral arrangements, plants and gifts
Ferris and Jeanie step gingerly through the flowers and head upstairs
'm sorry 've been riding your buns for so long
It's completely cool

Ferris continues up the stairs
He affects a sickly voice
Upstairs, Mom

Do you know a guy named Garth Volbeck
Vaguely
Is he cool
He's cool
But stay away from his brother
Ferris walks into the room, brushes the crumbs off his hands and peels off his shirt
He climbs into bed
No sooner are the covers over him than the bedroom door opens and Joyce and Tom walk in
They walk over to the bed
Joyce sits down
Honey
The same deathly face he had in the morning
Tongue out, eyes bulging
() Ferris
How do you feel
He pulls in his tongue to speak
(deathly gasp) 150% better, thank you
205
205 Tom and Joyce hover over him with deep concern
'm much better, really
Please, don't make me stay home again want to go to school
'm graduating in June and
Ferris
You're sick
There's no point pushing yourself and making it worse
Maybe you're right, Dad
know 'm right
Joyce leans over and kisses him forehead
How did you get so sweet
Years of practice
Tom pats Ferris on the rump
He and Joyce exit
The hideous face
beat and we
Ferris looks at
(happy sigh) Yeah, life is a carousel great big crazy ball of pure living, breathing joy and delight
He rolls over on his back and puts his hands behind his head
You gotta get one
He smiles
