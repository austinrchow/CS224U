Written by Jeffrey Scott Richards : -' nervous leg shakes under the table
The appendage seems to be attached to someone who has a lot on their mind
- , a college student in his late twenties stares at a friend who is sitting off screen
Louis is calm, almost villainous in how collective he is
He stares at this unseen friend, trying to assess the cause for his anxious state
(smug) Something is bothering you
We finally see , also in his late twenties
He is obviously uneasy about being out in public with this person
appreciate the faux concern but 'm fine
Louis is taken aback
My concern is genuine
With our history can you honestly say you care about my well being
Yes  can, our connection is a product of destiny
have no ill-will against you
Quinn scoffs
1941- -The Stephen Speilberg film
No, there was that little French girl liked
You
you violated her and torched her farm killing her family- 2
-Actually you are jacking up the story, violated her father in front of her
then  torched the farm
Well
that makes it ten times better
Quinn that was war, people do crazy things midst of wide spread conflict have gotten jaded over time
It's not like the dark ages when  had style
When you would rape the horses and ride away on the women
Yeah  was such a ham
(beat) Quinn, this is what we do
have gotten carried away in the past, but now 'm tired
just want to get this over with
It's our calling, we help bring order and balance to the universe
(beat) Maybe  would feel less removed if you would let me win just once
This isn't a 1930's boxing match
If take dive, 'm not lining the pockets of some bookie
'm bringing on the apocalypse
Louis takes a drink of his coffee
See at least our obligation would be over
Louis  might be nervous, but  accept my role as savior of this world
(beat) We have been doing this for years- -centuries- -and in 5 days we will do the same thing we have always done
() 3
(') (beat) We'll fight to the death
Atta' boy
: -- We pan across the cafe to the table of  and , a young college aged couple
Zoey is obviously trying to have a serious conversation, while Rick hides behind his laptop using it as a shield
'm not saying this is an intervention
Rick doesn't look up from his laptop screen
Wouldn't there be more people here if it was an intervention
See and  don't want it to be- (disinterested) -That's because it's not It's just
mean
are you gambling again
(totally removed) Nope
Because
um
the laptop, and you never go anywhere with out it- -it's my lifeline- -Yeah well
just know when  met you saved you from that downhill spiral
you know
uh
the online poker- 4
-'m not a project, you know that right
Of course not
never said you were
Because you act like it
wonder if didn't have this "so called problem" if you would have even been interested in me
Of course  would
just- -Take it upon yourself to save people
maybe
Honestly we have to save each other, who else is going to do it
(continued to be removed) People could just save themselves
True
Is that human nature
People rely on false deities, self help books
Rick the day  realized we were alone in the universe was the day  realized we have to be there for each other
(beat) Plus don't you find it romantic that want to save you
Like a movie
So our relationship is like a romantic comedy
(dreamy) Cameron Crowe romantic comedy
Oh well
so do you want to see what 'm doing on the computer
Zoey feels like she has broken down the "wall"
Yes
of course
5
Rick spins the computer around
Check that out Lloyd Dobler
(Shocked) Is that
porn
Red Tube
like You Tube
but with porn
Um
(lightbulb) wait
is that
Oh yes
Us having sex
Oh yeah
Rick reaches over and points at the laptop screen
(') love the part coming up
(beat) You know where  put your legs behind your head and yell "hump bunny
" Yeah
um
'm not  with this
Yeah
'm also breaking up with you
What
- -Yeah not working any more for me- What the hell
How is it not working
You are yelling
you know  don't like confrontational situations
6
'm not trying to be confrontational just
you are breaking up with me
-Yeah
Can  have my laptop back now
Zoey, still confused, slowly turns the laptop back toward Rick
(') (looking at the screen) This part is fucking priceless
Zoey is bewildered
- Louis kicks at the ground, almost as if he was searching for something
His foot finally rests on a broken tree limb
He places his foot under it and kicks it up to his right hand
This will do
He throws it over to Quinn, who catches it in one swift move
So what are you wanting to do
Louis searches around for a stick of his own
figure we would train
Why
Louis finds what he is looking for as he spins his limb into attack position
Because you dominate me every time- (beat) -ohh that sounded dirty So you want me to help you get an advantage
7
No,  want you to help me put on a good show
Everyone loves a good climax Quinn
-- Zoey sits on a bench beside her best friend
Zoey is completely distant, as Anna's words pass through her into thin air
You know  don't like interjecting myself into other people's affairs but- (barley paying attention) -But you're going to You let Rick do this to you
(Snapping to it) How so
You think you can change the men you are with
You can't get into a relationship with someone in the hopes that you can mold them into the person you want them to be
Rick needed someone stable- -Rick needs castrated
That's slightly strong
He was an asshole
Misunderstood- - 'll meet you half way
misunderstood asshole
(beat) You have been repeating the same cycle your whole entire life
8
Now that's a little off base
: 10 young  is sitting on another little boy's head
It looks like he is passing gas on him
(
) Remember Billy, who used to give kids the "dirty bomb"
You took it upon yourself to change this behavior- The boy is now doing the same to Zoey
(
) (') -This put you right in the cross-hairs to be his next victim
13 , a young teenager is selling drugs on the street corner
His bags of coke should be exaggerated, as well as the customers coming up to buy from him
Think if South Park was crossed with 's The Wire
(
) (') Good old Zack the neighbourhood drug dealer- Zoey takes Zack into a room labeled "Rehab" on the door
(
) (') -You took it upon yourself to be his personal savoir
What did it get you
Zack is out with Zoey when a few of his old show up looking to collect
Zack opens his pockets to show he doesn't have any dough on him
(
) (') Well when Zach's old business partners wanted to collect on a debt- Zack slowly pushes Zoey toward them
9
few days later we see Zoey being used as a human coffee table as the gang uses her back to cut cocaine
(
) (') - they used you to replace their missing coffee table they broke during a drunken party
17
gang member looks directly into the camera
He smiles showing his golden grille
(
) (') -And then you have Toothpick
What kind of name is Toothpick
(
) It was his gang name
(
) Of course
It's prom night and Toothpick is in his "pimp" tux
He takes a swig of his "40" while he dances with Zoey
(') We won't talk about prom night
Needless to say it wasn't romantic
Toothpick and Zoey are in an hotel room
Toothpick is standing over Zoey, who is facedown on the bed
It appears he is urinating on her
It's hard to tell with the black censor bar
: -- Exaggerations- -Accurate account of events
The story of your romantic life- -Unfair
Because these people need someone who is going to sacrifice their own needs for them
10
Why
Who else is going to do it
We're alone in the universe
If we are going to make it through this "crazy world" we need to look out for each other
think you use atheism and the whole "we are alone in the universe" jive to justify your actions
(beat) regret taking you to see Dawkins because you use that as a fall back to be codependent
First of all you are bitter about the whole Dawkins thing, because you flashed him your tits and got us kicked out- -You didn't even know the first thing about "The God Delusion" until  gave you a copy- -And someone who was huge supporter turns her back because Richard Dawkins didn't like her nipple piercing- (playful banter) -Enjoy your suite in hell non-believer- (more banter) -Enjoy your delusional life there fence sitter
How about you pray to Thor to hit me with a lighting bolt so  can be removed from this asinine conversation
You're hiding behind this religious debate because you don't want to admit you have always gravitated toward the "wrong type" of guy
Zoey is staring off into space
11
(detached) actually stopped listening to you
What are you staring at
Zoey points at Quinn and Louis, who are fighting with tree limbs in the distance
Who are those guys
The one closest to us is Quinn
Very weird, socially awkward type of guy don't know who his friend is
What are they doing
don't know
Looks like that stuff my ex- Rob was into- Oh that medieval rugby style game- -Yeah the made up sport from "Blood Of Heroes"
Oh
Jugger
- -Sounds pornographic
(beat) So Quinn
What else do you know about him
Oh no you don't
This is exactly what was talking about
Anna senses something in Zoey that she is trying to hide
(') Wait a second
You've already established contact with Quinn
What is this -6
You have your sights on him already
12
No, 'm just curious
What happened
: : 2 -- Zoey is overcome with emotion as she makes her way down to the riverside
She is holding something tight in her hand
- As her hand opens a class ring was digging into her palm
It appears this might have belonged to Rick
- Still teary eyed, Zoey angrily throws the ring toward the river
gust of wind causes the ring to curve and it slams into the temple of a man sitting on a park bench
Zoey walks over to apologize and meets Quinn for the first time
(making her way to the bench) 'm so sorry Quinn rubs his temple and then reaches down to pick up the ring
(handing the ring back to her) Is this yours
She takes the ring and shoves it into her pocket
Kinda
Again 'm so sorry
No need to apologize
Quinn scoots over and motions for her to sit
13
(') Do you want to sit
(unsure) Zoey sits, still apprehensive
(') (reaching her hand out) 'm Zoey
(He returns the gesture) Quinn
(beat) Zoey
Interesting
Oh name
Yes, most people have interesting stories behind their names
Honestly  have nothing
Not sure why my parents did that
Very unique
(smiles) suppose that's a compliment
So 've seen you around school, but never really
in
class
don't go to Marshall,  live near the campus though
Oh, well so what do you do
As in profession
don't really have one
Really
Rent is insane around here
Yeah, my father provides for me
That's pretty cool
What's he into
14
Everything
An entrepreneur
That's awesome
(beat) Well
So do you like coming down here
To the river
(smiles) Yes where we are right now
just needed to think
Yeah me too
just suffered a break up
My apologies
No it's
mean 'm over it
(laughs) My head disagrees
'm sorry
It's really
So what did you need to think about mean if 'm not prying of course
No,  just have some problems
(beat) 'm not sure about my calling in life
'm not sure anyone is
You know if you need a friend, 'd be glad to
well you know
listen
'd appreciate that
don't have many friends
15
know
(trying to double back) mean
've seen you around campus
you seem like a loner
didn't mean you were a loser
Loner is kind of sexy, loser
well can kind of be too
'll stop
No, it's
agree it never hurts to have a friend
So we can maybe go out to dinner if you want
And  can pay, you know
make up for the head
You really don't have to
No  want to
Well
(beat) Good let's meet up tonight
My place, 7pm
: : 7PM ' -7PM ,  20 year old gay man who loves him a good "Cosby Sweater", is sitting at the computer desk "surfing" on the desktop
Anna walks up from behind and runs her fingers through Jack's hair
16
So when does Ted Bundy get here
We follow Anna across the room where she plops herself down on the couch
promised her we would behave
is heard at the front door
(') Although knocking right as  sat down doesn't endear him to me
Jack gets up from the desk
You sit your pretty little ass down hooker
Anna adjusts herself back down into the comfy couch
This is why  don't need a boyfriend
You are way to good to me
Jack opens the door to reveal Quinn
Look at this mother fucker
He rudely motions him to come in and sit down
(') Zoey is in the bathroom getting ready for a night of manipulation, sit the fuck down
(confused) Um
In almost the same beat, Zoey walks into the room
Quinn, is he being rude
(looking at Jack) No quite pleasant
Zoey reaches out her hand to help Quinn off the couch
17
Let's go
(looking at Quinn) will call the state police in a fucking heart beat if she isn't here by midnight
(still confused) Anna grabs the remote trying to ignore the situation
Anna, you going to call the guard dog off
(out of it) David Smith's Candytakers is on tonight
'm relaxing and not getting in the middle
(To Jack and Anna) Nice meeting both of you
Get the fuck out
(to Jack and Anna) Don't wait up Zoey and Quinn leave the apartment as Jack stares daggers
- Zoey shuts the door and then turns to stop Quinn
Sorry about Jack
like him
18
- Zoey and Quinn are enjoying their meal at this fancy upscale establishment
Quinn picks up his menu, running his finger down though the menu items
Zoey  would be more than happy to pay
No not at all
This is on me
can cover dessert at least
Listen Quinn, 'm an atheist- -So you don't want dessert
- -No,  just wanted to get it out of the way
It bothers people,  mean in this state especially
Quinn puts down the menu
It doesn't bother me
Really
don't believe anyone is truly an atheist at the end
'm pretty sure 'm really an atheist
Why's that
Because 'm a logical thinker
(beat) don't mean to offend, 'm guessing you're religious
One supports the business they are in guess
19
Oh my God you are in the ministry
(smiles) Kind of
My father was a "fire and damnation" preacher
Baptist
He's
He's
It's nothing
(beat) Sorry  don't mean to rock your world
(smiles) You didn't
You poor thing
You are probably so desperate for friends- (laughs) What
Have you thought about St John's Wort
You are a very cryptic speaker
No 'm thinking out loud mostly
was just
well
you have some social awkwardness
Well you are latching on to religion to make you feel whole
It doesn't make you feel whole, or at least as whole as you thought it would- You are kind of right on that one
20
So you are out with me
represent everything you were brought up to combat
You're missing something and you are looking for help
am looking for help
'm out with you though because 'm interested in getting to know you
(smiles) See 'm good at reading people
(rolls eyes, smiles) Kind of
don't know Quinn you seem like a lost soul
thought that when  saw you by the river
You like lost souls don't you
Yeah  actually do
Someone needs to save them
You going to save me
If you let me
think you might be able to
(endearing smile) So what do you need Quinn
(smiles) Dessert
' - Jack is passed out drooling on the couch
Anna and Zoey are cross legged on the floor in the midst of "girl talk"
21
don't know, he seems fishy
He seems harmless
have heard that a million times
know
He's in the ministry- -and you hate organized religion
know and he's understanding of that
Plus it's to my understanding he didn't actually admit what he did
He just did a bunch of double talk
It was understood
Yeah again
not feeling confident in your choices
Please Zoey
(beat)
Be careful this time
: 4 ' - Quinn is sleeping in his bed
His room is rather bare, with the exception of the basic living necessities
It almost appears like a room at the ""
- foot is seen kicking the bed, startling Quinn
' Quinn flies out of bed and sees Louis leaning against the wall with his arms crossed
Where were you last night
22
(getting his bearings) Out
thinking
You've done a lot of mopping and thinking over the centuries
It kind of brings me down
So what do you need
Training
- Louis and Quinn walk out into a huge open field
Louis is carrying a black tote bag that he drops on the ground
Now this is a place for a climatic battle
Not bad
Quinn points at the bag (') What's in the bag
You will love this
Louis goes to the tote bag and starts to unzip it
(') went to the toy store last night and picked these up
He reaches into the bag and pulls out two "nurf" style swords out
(') Nothing like our real stuff, but it will do
Louis throws one of the "swords" to Quinn
(catching it) It's kind of lightweight
and silly
23
Louis comes over carrying his sword
Come on give it a chance
Louis comes at Quinn and his instinct kicks in
The two begin their mock battle
From behind a tree we see   for the first time
He hides in the shadows taking pictures with his digital camera
Quinn and Louis continue to practice unaware of the unwanted attention
- Louis sips his coffee, while Quinn just stares out the front window
It almost as if he is searching for something
You have not been lively at all this go around
lot on my mind
We only do this once every seventy years brother
You have to enjoy it while it lasts
Louis our whole purpose here, is to show up, and over time establish a social base, and then kill each other
You know and 'm very good at the social base part, and you are not so good
That's because you find a way to screw it up every time
That's because,  know this is news to you,  represent evil
() 24
(') Here's the thing though, 'm tired Quinn
really want to stop being the ambassador for this
That's something we agree on
'm tired too
don't know if we can get off this train
It's just a viscous cycle
Letting you win is not an option
wasn't going there
(beat) yet
' - Quinn is sitting on the couch as Jack and Anna make their way for the door
(
) You guys leaving
Zoey comes out of the kitchen with a bowl of popcorn
Yeah we don't want to interrupt your "date rape"
Anna hits Jack
Jesus Jack
He can't do anything here anyway
Too much exposure
Witnesses my friend
We knew he was here
Zoey sits down and hands the bowl to Quinn
Will you guys stop
It's
like your friends
Anna walks over to the couch
So Quinn
25
Yes
Zoey says you are in the ministry
Sort of
You are or you aren't
It's complicated
At some point you will have to explain it to Zoey
mean don't you agree
Well
(put out) Will you guys leave
Jack grabs Anna by the arm and leads her to the door
Who is going too far now
"Date Rape" (trying to make a point) Bye guys
Anna and Jack mumble as they head out the door
(') (turning to Quinn) Sorry about that
It's really
- Jack puts his arm around Anna, as to stop her for a second
26
You know  hate him because it's my nature but- -You think  hate him because of my distrust of men
Tragedy changes people, it effected Zoey in one way
you in another
Yeah (beat,smiles) became a "fag hag" : ' - Zoey is curled up next to Quinn on the couch
popcorn bowl is squeezed in between them
She reaches over and picks up the remote
Tonight's Feature Presentation is " am Curious:Yellow"
Probably not the best date movie, but  always show this to ever guy in the beginning
It's  this will be my first film experience
What
Yeah, 've never seen a film before mean  know of films, can't live in this world and not
've just never seen one
This might be a little hard-core for your first film
No it's
'm excited
Zoey shakes her head
27
feel like 'm stealing your virginity here
Zoey slowly looks over at Quinn
(') You're a virgin too aren't you
Quinn shrugs (') Oh my god
'm a bad girl
Quinn puts his hand on her shoulder
(smiles) You are not
Quinn motions to the
(') Please play the film
(hesitant) mean  usually play this for potential boyfriends
If they can handle this, they can handle me
Zoey hits play on the remote
(') guess you're lucky  thought about "They Call Her One Eye"
(to herself) hope this doesn't jack you up
: : 3 - Quinn is sitting cross legged in the middle of the field
He seems as though he is in the middle of a trance
(monotone) am curious Yellow
Louis walks up and throws a toy sword on Quinn's lap
28
What the hell are you talking about
Quinn stands up and grabs the sword
Nothing really
The two start to sword fight, but Quinn does not have his heart in it
You half asleep Quinn
Quinn stops for a second and drops his sword down to his side
Louis pokes Quinn in the chest with the tip of his sword
(') Look at that ladies and gentleman the apocalypse has begun
Quinn sits down
Have you ever seen a movie
Louis follows his lead
've seen plenty of movies
Really
Yeah  watched "The Sorrow and The Pity" at Marshal the other day
You know people here have yet to figure out we are not students
think they have a pretty good idea
So in all the times we have been here, you haven't gone to the cinema
No
Why not
29
It's not what we are here to do
In your bosses name, what is wrong with you
You've got to enjoy yourself
You might be chosen, but you have needs
We all do
have to stay focused
You've also burned yourself out
You're not going to be any good to me
Louis gets up and reaches out to help Quinn (') unless you take some "you" time
Quinn takes Louis' hand and gets to his feet
(') Can we get back to the matter at hand
Louis brings his sword back up into attack position
Quinn is back to his "swashbuckling" self
The two battle it out on the field, matching each other blow for blow
' - We creep upon Ryan Blood as he works at his computer
On closer inspection, it appears he is editing video of Quinn and Louis' mock fight earlier in the day
- Louis' set up is more lavish than Quinn's
It's obvious he indulges just a little too much
Louis comes out of the bathroom with a towel around his waist
He starts singing "Motown" songs to himself
He walks back off screen to the bedroom
We still hear him singing, as we pan around the apartment
We swing back around to the entrance of Louis' bedroom
He finally comes out fully dressed
He uses the towel he was wearing to finish drying his hair
He walks up to a mirror and starts looking at himself
30
' He starts to run his hands through his hair
He tries to straighten up the mess on his head
He picks up some gel and squirts a small amount in his hand
He runs it through his hair, getting the desired look
(to himself) You are a handsome devil
Louis spins around and grabs his keys off of the coffee table
He then dances right out the door
' - Louis walks into Quinn's room and finds him not there
(puzzled) Weird
Louis walks out into
the hallway
Ryan Blood is standing in the doorway of his room, across the hall
You looking for Quinn
Takes Louis' a second to register Ryan's question
Yes
(nodding toward the exit door) He just left
Louis runs outside
He looks up and down the street
In the distance he finally spots them, Quinn and Zoey holding hands
31
(to himself) What do we have here
- Louis stands across the street, staring right into the window of the cafe
He clearly sees Quinn and Zoey on a date
His eyes widen as their hands touch
'  - Zoey and Quinn walk holding hands through the apartment building parking lot
Zoey stops for a second and turns to face Quinn
Why haven't  seen your place
My place isn't very exciting
That doesn't surprise me
can't imagine you having a vast Blu Ray collection
Blu Ray
Wow
Quinn, you have to start enjoying the world around you
You know  realized today you are right about that
So you're saying you want to come up stairs and watch "They Call Her One Eye"
(laughs) Uh
no
'm still trying to get  am Curious Yellow out of my head
Yeah
sorry about that
32
(smiles) It's
Suddenly, guided by instinct, Zoey kisses Quinn on the lips
Quinn is completely thrown
'm sorry
No don't be
shouldn't have been that aggressive
No
it's
need to get back though
Puzzling
but  know
virgin and all- -Well
mean
That came out rude
just mean wanted to do it
should have taken it slower
It's
'll be by tomorrow
You sure
Yes of course
(worried) hope so
Quinn slowly turns around and walks away
Zoey looks at him like she is unsure if she will see him again
33
Meanwhile, leaning against the dumpster, Louis watches the display unseen
' - Ryan is working at his  when a  is heard
He gets up from his messy desk and makes his way over to the door
As he swings it open we see Louis on the other side
' - Ryan leans back in his desk chair
Louis has cleared off a spot on a messy couch
The apartment, simply put, is a "shithole" You're here to learn more about his "coming and goings"
To find out what have seen
So far you are dead on
It's more than that Louis- -You know who  am
know pretty much everything
've watched you, studied you
feel 'm expert on your little game every seventy years
Really
Oh yes
Ryan picks up a stack of documents and throws the papers one at a time at Louis
(') You battled as mortals- (beat) () 34
(') -You were a Lamanite then- (beat) -Quinn was a commander of the Nephites, last survivor of that nation- (beat) -The savoir spoke to him, showed him his future
his destiny- (beat) -See after the death of Christ there was some debate on what was going to bring on the end and signal his return- (beat) - It was decided two great warriors had to fight
The winner would determine the start of the apocalypse
Your boss of course needed someone to represent his interests
Who better than Quinn's old adversary
Louis brushes the pile of papers of his lap
Where are you going with this you weird little man
You had strategy in the beginning
Middle Ages
Old West
Even World War
(beat) Let's take a step back for a second
The Old West
Lack of faith, corruption, these things make Quinn weak
The chink in his armor is his faith in people
You knew that, and corrupting America
a young land
was the key
(beat) Quinn was a step ahead of you, and looked for a human ally
That ally was Joseph Smith, and Quinn
or  mean Moroni
led Joseph to the plates that later when into- Ryan picks a book up and throws it at Louis
Louis looks down at the "Book Of Mormon"
(') -His little plan didn't work, but the book is a great coffee table discussion piece
This made him weak Louis
You could have destroyed him
The problem is you've allowed yourself to become fond of him
need to embrace your destiny
How do  do that
35
This girl is distracting him
Get his mind focused on the matter at hand
At this point 'm afraid he isn't even going to fight you
'm surprised this girl even likes Quinn
He comes across creepy
Maybe that's the key- (lightbulb) -Make her think he's crazy
' - Quinn opens the door to his room and spies a silhouette in the far corner
Where have you been
The silhouette comes out of the darkness and into view
It should come to no surprise that Louis is emerging from the darkness
You've been waiting long
No  figured you were on your way back- -because you are spying on me again
So don't need to tell you where 've been
Louis sits down on the edge of the bed
Who's the girl
It's started again
You're already jealous
You are going to do the same thing you did during the war
you're going to sabotage this
'm insulted frankly
36
Don't you play that game
You are being facetious
No, 'm being serious
You care about the girl, it's obvious
Not in a friendship or 'm curious about human behavior way
Quinn sits down beside him
So why are you here
Have you told her
Who  am
Of course not
Quinn you only have a few days left and you care for this girl- (beat) - What's the harm in telling her
There's a lot of harm in telling her
If this is real and you really care for this girl, you have to tell her
It's only fair to her
She has a best friend who is very guarded of me
It's odd she eluded to the same thing
You know the whole "'m hiding something, and  need to come out into the open" thing
Sounds to me like she is right
Quinn gets up and walks to the door
Well  better do this now then
Yeah you don't want to lose your nerve
Can you let yourself out
37
Of course
Quinn slowly opens the door and walks out
The door creeps shut behind him
Louis smiles to himself, feeling satisfaction
His face looks evil, almost demonic
'  - In almost a "romantic movie" way, Quinn runs toward Zoey's apartment
When he reaches the door he knocks like his life depends on it
Anna swings the door open, she's obviously surprised to see Quinn
What the hell
You can hear Jack inside the apartment
(
) What the fuck
want to watch Bring me the Head of Alfredo Garcia in peace
need to see Zoey
What about tomorrow
Or never is good
You hear Zoey off screen
(
) What's going on
Zoey comes to the doorway and stands behind Anna
(') Quinn
What's wrong
need to talk to you, it's important
Quinn grabs her by the arm and pulls her outside, pushing her right past Anna
Jesus Christ
Anna slams the door shut, leaving Zoey and Quinn outside
38
need to tell you everything
Anna is so right
What are you talking about
Anna is right
've not been honest with you about what do
or who  am
need to come clean
want you to trust me
want your friends to trust me
(nervous laugh) Quinn, just spit it out
(beat) 'm an archangel named Moroni and basically represent "light" or everything that's good
Louis, my friend, represents "darkness"
Every seventy years we have to fight to the death
If  win everything stays the way it is
The world continues turning
If  lose, Louis takes on the role of the Antichrist and the apocalypse will be unleashed
'm talking Book of Revelations stuff here
So  only have a limited time left in this world
(beat) want to spend that time with you
Zoey is stunned, silent
Oh honey
Zoey touches his face
(') You must have a brain tumor or something
You're obviously mentally ill
Zoey
39
Zoey puts her finger up to his lips to quiet him
Shhh
You need me more than ever
Zoey reaches down and takes a confused Quinn's hand
She leads him to the door
Like a sheep herder, she takes Quinn inside of the apartment
The last image we see is the apartment door slamming behind them
: -' - - Zoey, roughly 2 years old, sits in the floor of her parent's home playing
Her , only seen from the waist down, walks in front of Zoey with his bible in hand
He makes it to Zoey's , on the other side of the room You're not even helping me
don't even know what you want
can't run my congregation with this sickness
The sickness is in your head
You're too busy running around doing whatever you feel like
'm going to fall apart and it's all on you
-' -  - Zoey, now 12, is going through some boxes in the closet
Her head bumps a shelf and a box falls on her
When she goes to pick up the box she finds a ton of tapes
40
She goes through the box looking at the labels: "Anna age 7" "Anna age 10" "Anna age 12"
-' - The glow of Zoey's  fills her face
We can neither see nor hear what she is watching
Zoey looks like she is about to throw up
: ' - - Zoey jumps out of bed, like she is waking from a nightmare
startled Quinn, who was sleeping beside her, starts to arouse
: : 2 ' - Louis walks into Quinn's room with his black tote bag from earlier
It's obvious he was meeting Quinn to go train
He looks through out the room, but quickly realizes Quinn is probably with Zoey
He slumps down on Quinn's bed
Anger and hurt is portrayed upon his face
- Quinn and Zoey are having coffee
It's obvious Zoey had a rough night
She takes a sip of coffee, her mind is distant
Last night
Yes
Did you
Enjoy myself
Of course
41
Based on how you are acting this morning have my doubts
That's not what  meant though
You woke up screaming
It was nothing
understand if you don't want to talk about it
'm just concerned
It's not a big deal
It was
a
well wouldn't call it a nightmare
repressed memory
Hell, it's not repressed think of it all the time
What is it
You don't want to hear about it
Quinn touches her hand
Please
Zoey takes a deep breath
My father,  mentioned him before, was a Baptist minister
He always said he had this "sickness"
He begged my mom for help, it was more important though for her to having shopping and dinner dates with her girlfriends
Anna, my friend that "loves you", has been in my life since  was tiny
She used to come over all the time
My Dad adored her
When was around twelve  found something in the closet
tapes
My Dad and Anna from the time she was like seven
He
(starts tearing up) showed my Mom, and Dad
well he got out of prison when  was seventeen don't see him anymore
His church, even though they knew he had a problem disowned him
He wouldn't have done that to Anna if my mom would have supported him, got him help
42
Who do you think is to blame
He tried to get help Quinn, he reached out to my Mom
should have protected Anna too
mean- -None of this was your fault
have to protect people
This was out of my control, you Quinn
What's going on with you
have control of that
Quinn looks at Zoey
He loves her, but a part of him pities her too
-- Zoey is curled up under Quinn's arm as they sit on the same bench from earlier
Quinn stares out toward the river
It's obvious he is pondering over his choices
love being with you
Me too
can't renege on my responsibilities with Louis though
Zoey sits up
You're not actually going to fight your friend to the death are you
know you don't understand this
We just need to make the most of our time
Quinn, in 2 days things are going to be normal
This is just a delusion
know you don't understand
just need to go see Louis today
43
understand that
Quinn leans his head back
He catches something out of the corner of his eye
' Quinn sees Ryan Blood hiding behind a tree
He is taking video of Quinn and Zoey with a "smart phone"
- Quinn jolts up
Zoey is alarmed
What is it
Quinn doesn't answer
He gets up and runs to the
Quinn looks behind the tree, but Ryan is long gone
Zoey comes up from behind, she places her hand on Quinn's shoulder
What was wrong
My neighbor Ryan Blood
looks like he's spying on me
What are you talking about
need to go see Louis
' - Louis is watching the video on the smart phone
He's seen enough, he throws it back to Ryan
Louis tosses trash off the couch so he can sit down
(sitting down) thought him admitting his true self would break them up- 44
Ryan plops down in his computer desk chair
-Instead he is still hot and heavy with her
(beat) He even did the "bipty boom" last night
The fight is pointless
It's not pointless
The game has just changed is all
(beat) We have two levels here: one is making sure we keep him engaged
(beat) Honestly though that's an afterthought at this point- So what's the next move
Ryan reaches into his desk drawer
(still searching) Well when he does become engaged
Ryan throws something at Louis
Louis catches the item
He looks down to see a nine millimeter
(
) (') We need to make sure you still have the advantage
' - Zoey is pacing back and forth
Jack rubs his face in frustration
He is tired of watching Zoey tear herself up over this guy
Anna tries to step into Zoey's path attempting to get her attention What are you doing
45
Zoey is jittery, she can't handle Anna blocking her way
haven't heard from Quinn since he wigged out today
Well honestly maybe that's a good thing
He needs me
He doesn't need you
Not everyone needs you
(frustrated) This isn't about me and you- -This is about me and you
You think you can make up for what happened
The fact you didn't notice, couldn't save me in time
You were a child
was a child
You couldn't have saved your father either
Your mother couldn't have, no one could have
He was a fucking pedophile
Zoey slaps Anna across the face
(') Hate me all you want, but it's impossible to redeem yourself for things you had no control over
Jack is sick and tired of this display
Just show her the fucking file
Jack gets up
(confused) What fucking file
- Quinn runs toward Louis' apartment
His  sound like a jackhammer on the door
Louis answers
46
We have a problem
You're right
We do
Louis moves slightly and we see Ryan Blood in the background
Louis slowly closes the door in a stunned Quinn's face
Louis turns toward Ryan
thought coming here would give us some privacy from Quinn
think it worked out perfectly
'  - Jack walks into the room holding a file folder
Zoey is sitting on the couch trying to get a grip
Jack throws the file in her lap
So is the file folder for dramatic effect
No it was to keep everything organized
(beat) and for dramatic effect
Suddenly Zoey's cell phon rings
She sets the folder aside and answers
Quinn
Quinn is on a pay phone, he's shaking
At this point he is lost on what his next move should be
47
Ryan Blood
You mentioned that earlier
What is going on
He's with Louis
They're planning to kill me
thought that was the whole plan
No it's
this isn't like Louis
think he is trying to cheat his way to a win
Why don't you come over here
can't
Come on Quinn get a grip
Just calm down and come over here
You're right
so just come on over and we'll talk
No  mean you're right
need to get control of myself
have a destiny need to figure out my next move
Quinn
No wait- Quinn hangs up the phone
' Zoey slowly drops her cell phone to the floor
Jack picks up the folder Zoey set aside
What is it
48
don't know
He's losing it
Jack hands her the folder
You need to look at this
Zoey takes the folder from him and starts reading
(') spent a lot of time gathering that information
So what is all this
Quinn Wilson and Louis Marks were orphans
Zoey is flipping through documents
(') Quinn displayed some erratic behavior from the beginning
One of the staff members was Mormon and they would read stories to Quinn out of the Book Of Mormon
That employee was later fired, but a seed was planted in Quinn's head
He kept going on about how he and Louis were meant to fight to the death
Some of the children at the time claim Louis would encourage this behavior
He probably thought this was Quinn's attempt at playing
(beat) As things continued the staff at the orphanage thought Quinn needed help beyond what they could offer
They sent Quinn to a hospital
Zoey puts the folder down, the documents fall to the floor
You're not telling me anything  didn't already know
That makes it worse
You're going to continue this now that you know for a fact that he is nuts
49
'm too far into this now
don't have a choice
Zoey picks the documents up and places them in the folder
She then tosses the folder on the coffee table
Why don't you let us save you
Please Zoey
Let me be guys
Zoey walks to her bedroom, leaving Anna and Jack exhausted
' - The apartment is quiet
Anna no where in sight, more than likely in her room sleeping
Jack is passed out on the couch
Zoey walks in, it's obvious she hasn't slept all night
She scoots Jack's legs over and sits on the couch
She proceeds to pick up the file folder
She starts thumbing through the documents
After a few moments she finds one of interest
She reaches over and pushes Jack
(rousing up) Ehhh
what
You better be a hot bear of a man
Jack looks up and sees Zoey
(') Or Zoey
What do you need hun
Zoey hands Jack a document from the folder
What's this
Jack's eyes try to focus on the document
Looks like a room list from the psych hospital
50
gathered that
Under Quinn's room
Quinn and his roommate is listed
Quinn's roommate was Ryan Blood
Yeah
looks that way
Ah fuck
: : 1 - Louis stares out into the open field
gust of wind blows through his hair
Ryan Blood comes up from behind and pats Louis on the back
We need to talk
Louis turns around to face Ryan
About
Strategy
Strategy
Yes
have a method- - have to hear this
12 point system- (confused) - Like 12 steps
51
Exactly
It's a sure fire plan to throw Quinn off of his game Louis laughs
Oh  am so all ears
Well the first thing you need is a battle cry
Excuse me
battle cry
Yes a battle cry
Every great warrior has one
And a battle cry is going to give me the advantage in battle
Of course it will
Why don't you try one out
What
Yeah, try one out right now
It's liberating
'd rather not
Come on
(extremely confused) Right here
Here 'll go first- Ryan let's out a scream that sounds as though he is being sodomized
That was
interesting
52
See
(beat) Your turn
Louis looks around
So right now
Of course
Louis inhales deeply and then lets out a scream
It comes out more like frightened little girl
(') Oh come on
That sounds like you are scared of the battle
What
Are you scared of Quinn
You probably are- Louis lets out another scream, this one is slightly better
(') That's good
Come on
Louis lets out another one that actually causes Ryan to jump back
(') Yes that's what 'm talking about
Out of nowhere, Quinn walks up to the two of them
(') (noticing Quinn) Quinn
Good to see you
Quinn grabs Louis' arm
We need to talk
(to Ryan) Excuse me for a second
Louis walks with Quinn to a spot that gives them some distance away from Ryan
know that guy and  don't trust him
53
don't trust you anymore
Your new friend is dangerous
So is yours
Leave her out of this
You fighting tomorrow morning Quinn
It's over
This whole thing is nuts
'm walking away
Let me walk away from you first then
Louis starts to walk away from Quinn
He turns around as he continues to walk backwards
(') 'm coming at you
You are in this game like it or not
- Zoey's car pulls up in front of an historic brick building
She slowly gets out and starts to look the structure over
It's almost like she is trying to assess if she has the right place
- awkward young man, , is sorting through boxes
He's kneeled on the floor organizing a mess of files
Zoey walks up and tries to attract his attention
Excuse me
Jake comes out of his world of file sorting
He looks up at Zoey
(monotone) Yes
54
Jake stands
'm looking for Mrs
Rhodes
believe the people here referred to her as "mother"
(monotone) People look for a lot of things
Zoey is confused
'm sure they do
(looking at the boxes) You guys shutting down
(monotone) We are ceasing operations
Is there something wrong with you
, a 60 year old odd looking lady, comes out of the back
Calm down
You need to calm down and count to ten
What
don't know what that means
Mrs
Rhodes starts waving her hands at Zoey
She flaps them up and down in her face
You have to calm down and meditate
Um
no
listen do you know Quinn Wilson and Louis Marks
They grew up here
Mrs
Rhodes steps back like a vampire who has just seen a cross
No
You need to leave
What
55
And give me your shirt
Um
no
Zoey turns around and starts to leave
Mrs
Rhodes starts screaming at the top of her lungs
You better make your peace with God girl
The end is coming, those boys are ushering in a new era
Zoey runs down the hallway toward the front door
Zoey runs outside and makes it to her car
She hits the roof of her vehicle in anger What a fucking nut house
(
) (monotone) Excuse me
Zoey jumps up and screams
She sees Jake standing creepily behind her
What
(monotone) know the young boys you speak of
(doesn't care) And
(monotone) was here when Quinn got sent to the mental hospital
It was like the other one set it up
Wait Louis
You think Louis made Quinn appear crazy
56
(monotone) They both believed the same thing
Louis was just smart enough to hide it
There is more to it than that
(monotone) don't understand Listen "Robot Boy", where did this whole belief come from
This isn't something two kids come up with on their own
(monotone) Yes  believe a seed was planted
Exactly
heard there was an employee that got fired for sharing Mormon mythology with the boys
(monotone) No
Off base
He's not the right one
' - Jack sits at the  while chatting away on his cell phone
It appears he is looking up information for who ever is on the other end
' - Zoey is parked in a parking lot, while she chats on her cell phone with Jack
You might be right sweetheart
The employee  was telling you about earlier was instrumental in getting Appleridge Orphanage shut down
How
57
Mrs
Rhodes was pretty well known in Huntington
think she felt this guy was getting in the way of her master plan
Finally, nearly 20 years later, he convinced the state what was really going on there
Well
elaborate
That girl you talked to was "pants crapping nuts"
She actually makes your boyfriend look sane
guess she believes that Lucifer came to her in a vision- -How is that different than a dream
Just saying- - don't know
think you have to be awake for a vision
(beat) Will you please pay attention
Anyway he, meaning Lucifer, gave her this jazz about
well you know the story
Two angels, fighting to the death
blah
blah
Anyway he told her she needed to look after Louis and get Quinn out of there
guess trying to stack the odds in Louis' favor
So she had Quinn committed
To the same hospital where her nephew was a patient
All on the dark lord's orders guess
Fucking Ryan Blood
Your friends are fucking whack
Thanks Jack
So what are you going to do
58
'm going to stop an Apocalyptic battle
Goddamn Zoey
' Jack realizes Zoey hung up on him
He slowly puts his phone down and steps away from the computer
He walks over to the couch and sits down
He lets out a sigh of exhaustion as he leans back on the couch
' - Jack is now sprawled out on the couch
Anna walks in the room and sets a beverage on the coffee table in front of him
She moves his legs and sits down beside of him
So where is she at now
Jack sits up
got a text about thirty minutes ago
'm pretty sure she is going to head to Quinn's apartment
Jack
What
Her Christ Complex is going to get her killed
Trust me  know Anna
(beat) know
is heard at the door
Anna gets up to answer
(') Maybe it's Quinn the jackass
59
Anna just gets the door opened a crack when
Ryan and Louis  into the room
Anna
Louis restrains her against a wall
Jack gets up from the couch, but he meets a gun handle to the head from Ryan
Good afternoon boys and girls
need your assistance
' - Quinn walks into his room
To his surprise, Zoey is sitting on his bed
It appears she has been there for a while
How do people keep ending up in my room
(laughs) You need to learn to lock up
Quinn walks over and sits on the bed beside her
'm not fighting Louis
Why the change of heart
think you might be right
don't think it's necessary
think the world will keep turning one way or another
'm not dependant on that
(beat) 'm not a savior
Do you really believe
You know
Yes
do believe it
know it actually
Since  have been with you, 've doubted what  know to be fact though
Then it hit me, it really doesn't matter
'll help you Quinn
don't want to do it for myself
() 60
(') don't want to do it because  feel have to
Obligations, or dark incidents from my past
That's not a reason to help anyone
It makes me fucking selfish actually
You're not selfish Zoey
care about you Quinn
That's sincerely my reason for wanting to do this
That's a first for me you know
know
Quinn hugs her and they slowly lay down on the bed together
: ' - Quinn gets pistol whipped across the face
Suddenly we see Louis picking Zoey up by the hair
(in pain) Let her go
Louis has a hold of Zoey
Quinn gets up and goes for Ryan
Louis drop kicks Quinn and sends him flying across the room
Louis throws Zoey at Ryan
Ryan then holds her at gun point
(looking at Quinn) Let me pretty the girl up a bit Ryan beats her repeatedly with the gun until she passes out cold from the trauma
Quinn tries to get to his feet, but Louis kicks him back down
Hold on sunshine
61
Ryan throws Louis the gun
' We see Louis with great force repeatedly hit Quinn with the gun
Everything goes fuzzy and then we
: ' - Quinn slowly gets to his feet
He walks over to the doorway and kneels down
He sees a puddle of blood
Zoey's blood
He puts his fingers in it
He inspects his hand, rubbing the blood between his index finger and thumb
He jumps up and screams in anger
That would be Quinn's version of a battle cry
-' hand rips duct tape off of Jack's mouth
He let's out a loud scream
Mother fucker
' - Quinn crouches down beside Jack
Jack and Anna are both tied up, Anna still has duct tape across her mouth
You can hear her muffled screams as they fill the room
Where's Zoey
Fuck you mother fucker
'm going to call the fucking fuzz once you untie me
Fucking nut bag, ball sac- (like he is talking to a retarded child) will
come
rescue
you 62
Ass fuck salad- Quinn puts the duct tape back on Jack's mouth
Even though we can't make out what he is saying, he is still running off at the mouth
That actually felt kind of good
Quinn pats Jack on the head
(') 'll be back guys
Quinn leaves the room
Muffled cursing can be heard through out the apartment
-' long black box is pulled out from under Quinn's bed
We see Quinn's hands unlatch and then open it
Inside we see Quinn's katana
His hand grips the hilt
' Quinn gets up, holding his katana and ready for a fight
He's dressed in a black biker jacket, kind of looking like the Bride from Kill Bill
He walks to the doorway
He stands still for a second
He's preparing his next move
Bad ass comic book pose
'nuff said
: : The front doors to the church swing open
Light fills the sanctuary
Zoey walks through the doors
She heads toward the alter and sees a man, in his 50's, kneeling
It appears he might be praying
63
She places her hand on his shoulder
As he turns around she sees her Dad
'm not doing it anymore
You will not have redemption from me
(raspy) Zoey
He reaches for her, she pulls away
She starts to back up
Take ownership of what you did
Don't rely on me to save you
need to start saving myself
She slowly backs up and then turns to walk away
(') (as she is turning) Goodbye
: - ' Ryan slaps Zoey in the face to wake her up
- Ryan pulls Zoey up to her feet
He presses the gun against her head
Louis walks out into the middle of the field
He's dressed in a full ninja outfit
He unsheathes his katana
What do you think Zoey
'm a ninja
(struggling under Ryan's grip) You're fucking crazy
64
That's not nice
think  look good
think you're a fucking nut bag
This is going to be fun
You'll see
Mrs Rhodes
Does that name ring a bell
My aunt
Yeah
yeah
she played a part in the game
Tell us something we don't know
You're such a sexy Nancy Drew right now
Go fuck yourself
Or a foul mouthed Velma
That gets me so hard
Does that get you hard Ryan
Can we go back to my aunt please
Mrs
Rhodes
What about her
Other than she fucked you guys up
She taught you, Louis how to play it straight
Then she has you fuck Quinn over
She didn't fuck Quinn over
She just helped him out
Yeah by getting him in contact with you
She knew one day it was all going to catch up with her
She trained me to get into the game
She told me it was my destiny
Is that why she placed you in that hospital
65
She was my caretaker
She told me she was sending me someone
Someone  would have to guide on to the right path
Guys  have let my parents fuck me up
There comes a time though where you have to go out on your own
Take responsibility for your own life
There is a much bigger purpose
You'll see
This whole thing was to carry out some delusional woman's master plan
She doesn't even remember who she is at this point
went to see her
she wanted me to take off my shirt
Louis is irritated
Will you shut up
You are ruining my climatic fight
Louis spies Quinn in the distance
(') Showtime
Quinn lowers his katana, it brushes against the blades of grass
Louis follows suit as he slowly walks to meet Quinn in the middle
The two warriors stand on opposite sides of the battle field
Quinn looks over and sees Zoey
Let her go
Ryan grabs her tighter
Not yet
66
(To Louis) Is this the game you want to play
'm not going to lose this time
(To Quinn) thought you didn't believe this shit anymore
There's more going on than you realize Zoey
This is fucked
Quinn you're not 5000 years old
You were born in an orphanage
None of this makes sense
Lady, it would look weird if we roamed the earth for 5000 years without facing a mortal death
We keep getting reborn, sometimes we even switch physical form
Thanks for coming to the game late missy
That makes total fucking sense
Color me stupid
(to Louis) You don't get it do you
What
If you win
you're not becoming the antichrist
What are you talking about
It's   Ryan
it's always been Ryan
(To Ryan) What is he talking about
67
He's pitting us against each other
'm going to be honest with you Louis
've always been honest
Yeah sometimes to a fault
We have always played this game as honest as we could
We never did anything to undermine the other
Despite what you represent, you have moral code
(beat) You are not acting with in that code today
'm tired of losing
You're losing right now
Your actions, you can't win like this
Not acting this way
'm tired of you
'm going to end it
Louis goes over to Ryan
He trades his sword in for Ryan's gun
Ryan holds the katana to Zoey's throat
Louis points the gun dead at Quinn
You going to shoot me
It's the endgame
Tense moment as Louis aims the gun at Quinn
he spins and shoots Ryan dead in the head
Ryan falls and Zoey gets free
Louis looks at Quinn and then throws the gun far out into the field
(') guess  do have some morals
68
Zoey gets her bearings
What the fuck
Zoey go home
We need to finish this
Louis walks over to Ryan and grabs his katana
No you don't
Guys what are you doing
Go home girl
Are you being serious
Quinn stops and turns toward Zoey
will always love you
You have to go though
If you don't walk away from this field right now, you will lose me
will not be in your corner
will call for help
They will stop you
Go
Quinn
last chance
Zoey walks over to Ryan's body
She searches till she finds her cell phone in his front pocket
(') will call the police Quinn
Quinn looks at Zoey, dead in the eyes
Goodbye
Quinn turns toward Louis
He pulls his katana up to attack position and Louis follows suit
(tearing up) Wow
yeah goodbye
69
Quinn and Louis charge each other
Zoey doesn't bother to stay to watch the battle
She slowly walks away
Quinn and Louis' swords meet
The clang is triumphant
Details of this climatic battle will be choreographed by the actors involved, but think high flying Shaw Brothers film
We don't see a clear victor, just the two boys going at it until we can't tell who is who
- Zoey starts to make a call on her cell phone
- She starts to dial 911
Her thumb moves in the position to hit send
Zoey stops
She slowly puts her phone away
She looks back toward where the battle is going on
She starts to walk back
The walk turns into a jog
Finally the jog turns into a full run
When she gets to the field Quinn and Louis are gone
All that can be seen is Ryan Blood's body, two katanas and an empty ninja suit
Zoey leans down and touches Quinn's katana
(laughs to herself) am Curious:Yellow (beat) Goodbye boys
Zoey stares out into the open field
She feels reborn
She knows there is a new world, a new perspective for her beyond the horizon
: : 70 70
The camera slowly pans toward an older ninety year old Zoey
She's behind a podium, there is a sign on the front that reads: Marshal University Association of Free Thought
For years we have thought absence of the impossible indicated that we were exercising free thought
In my experience ladies and gentleman, that's not the case
(beat) Believing in hope my friends, opening yourself up to accepting there might be more than the world around you
That's truly being a free thinker
The camera ends with a close shot on Zoey's face
-- Zoey sits on the same bench where she met Quinn
Her great-granddaughter,  walks up
She sits down beside her grandmother
Hey Grandma
Hey
You look solemn
Just sitting here
thinking
What are you thinking about
've had a great life
wonderful husband, children, grandchildren
(motions to Jennifer) great grandchildren
spent so much of my youth being angry
wish  could relive my life now, knowing what  know
You do have a lot of wisdom
71
've tried to pass it on to you
You've taught me a lot
Just remember, you can believe what you want to believe Jennifer
Live by what ever moral code you want to live by
Just make sure it's yours
Don't let it stem from anger or past tragedies
(beat) Let it come from your heart
Jennifer turns around
(') What is it
My new boyfriend
The one  wanted you to meet
Zoey turns around to see the  walking toward them
It shouldn't come to a surprise that he looks a lot like Quinn
Jennifer gets up and grabs her boyfriend around the waist
He reaches his hand out to Zoey
(nervous) Nice to meet to ma'am
(shakes his hand) Likewise
Jennifer grabs his hand right after his handshake with Zoey
We better get going
We're going to grab something to eat
(to the boyfriend) didn't catch your name
'm so sorry
'm being rude
72
(laughs) He can be like that
'm Louis
Zoey is stunned
(to Zoey) You
Yeah 'm fine
(snapping out of it) Enjoy dinner
See you later on
(making eye contact with Zoey, smiling) Nice to meet you
(returning contact, and smiles) Likewise
The two lovebirds walk away
Zoey stares at them for a second
it "can't be look" crosses her face
"  ' -' Zoey smiles almost to say to the camera that there is more out there
Things that we don't fully understand
The smile then fades
Her final look is that of content
And then as Done and Dusted plays we
