Oh, God, no
The hair's wrong
This is a bad sign

Bruce  from pissed to instant charismatic  newsman
(Note: Whenever Bruce speaks on camera he speaks in his "' " - that recognizable, too-smooth delivery that all news reporters seem to have
In mathematical terms Bruce's version is to the 7th power
) For three decades the Kowolski Family Bakery has been a mainstay in downtown Buffalo
Known for their sinfully rich, cream filled, deep fried polski pierogis
And the occasional sugar induced coma that follows
Today, in honor of their 30 year anniversary, Momma Kowolski and her sons Gustov and Vol, decided to do something, a little bit different
Tell me guys, how did this idea come about
Well,    Vol said to me, 'Gustov, why don't    we make the biggest chocolate chip    cookie in Buffalo
' And said,    'Yeah, sure
' Wow
Fascinating
Bruce steps up to the
The previous Buffalo cookie record was 3 feet, 17 inches baked by Gladys Pelsnick
But this behemoth cookie clearly proving that Gustov and Vol have much more free time
The Kowolski brothers and all celebrate in the background, toasting with big mugs of milk
Bruce steps forward, looks dramatically at camera, slow zoom in as he speaks
(') As we witness the ceremonial toasting with milk it makes one pause and think
What are we really looking at here
() 3
(') Is it just a big cookie or does this cookie represent the pride of Buffalo
Our dedicated and hard working citizens the key ingredient, with a few nuts thrown in
(motions his eyes to the Kowolski twins) And finally, the love of our families which provides the warm chewy center making our beloved Buffalo the sweetest place to live
Camera is in  as Bruce signs-off
(') And that's the way the cookie crumbles
'm Bruce Nolan, Eyewitness News
Bruce's hair net  , The Kowolskis and bystanders all laugh
The frame
We   from the  and find Bruce holding the remote, watching the recorded spot on
We are now
'  - Bruce is with his longtime girlfriend,
She has a box of photos on the coffee table in front of her organizing them into a photo album
So, what do you think
It's good
It sucks
It's a story about a cookie
People with eating disorders will be riveted, (goes into huge pathetic fan character) Dear Bruce, love the bakery piece
can't wait to vomit so  can make room for more cookies
thought it was funny
love the hair net
How'd you get it to do that
4
What
'm cutting that
They made me wear that stupid thing
don't even look like myself
The hair is one of the most important parts of an on camera persona
Right out of the gate,  lost the hair advantage
Grace looks at a photo, Oh, my gosh, look at this one
My sister is so drunk
She places it in the album
Grace
Try to stay focused here
need your help
Aren't you taking this a little too seriously
It's sweeps Grace
It is serious
There's an anchor job open
This is important
This is our future
Bruce points to the  as he says "future," not realizing he's pointing at the ridiculous image of himself with the hair net bun
Grace can't help but giggle
'm sorry
Bruce collapses into Grace's arms like a child
He clearly has a fragile temperament
(sighs) 'm never going to get anchor doing these kind of assignments
want my work to matter
It does matter
You're funny
You make people smile
Come on, take a break, help me put this album together
(reluctant) Alright
Grace holds up a photo
Oh look at this
It's the first day we moved in together
It's the two of them, younger, laughing
(down) Yeah, so full of hopes and dreams
Oh, here's me at my sister's wedding
caught the bouquet
It's a picture of Grace overpowering the other bridesmaids for the bouquet
You look pretty intense, hun
Well,  was thinking about you
Grace cuddles into Bruce
So, you're attracted to me in some way, is that what you're trying to say
Grace rolls over onto Bruce
You have no idea
was saving myself for the wedding night, but if you keep this up, may lose my resolve
Grace stands, pulling Bruce up
Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles
They kiss, stumbling toward the bedroom
6
Hey, that's a good line, but you need more resonance
From the diaphragm
(newscaster voice) That's the way the cookie crumbles
Oh, say it again
(bigger) That's the way the cookie crumbles
(sweet, southern groupie) Oh,  just love on-air personalities
(newscaster voice) Well then, let me take these clothes off and slip into my hair net
Grace laughs, Bruce joins in as they disappear into the bedroom
: We see the    : 'm Ed Bradley, 'm Merely Safer, an d  ' m -- is
Her head wavers, then  on the desk
The camera  to , who lowers a bamboo blow gun, cooly addresses camera
Bruce Nolan
And this is Sixty Minutes
: '   - We are in
7
'  - Bruce lies next to Grace with a big smile on his face
Grace hits the alarm, rolls over snuggling close to Bruce
Sweety, time to get up
She kisses Bruce, gets up
No, 'm having a great dream
The covers are
Bruce throws a mock hissy fit
- Bruce watches  as he buttons his shirt
and the Sabers lost another close one last night
Four to three to the Toronto Maple Leafs
Of course they lost, they're my team
: Bruce checks his hair in the mirror practicing his new sign- off
"And that's the way the cookie crumbles
" (calls to Grace) You know,  think there might be something to that cookie line
Everything great anchor has his own signature sign-off
(as Walter Cronkite) "And that's the way the cookie crumbles
" - Peeing in the corner on the carpet
8
Oh no
Grace, the dog
(
) 'm in the shower
Ah
Bruce runs along carrying the peeing Sam with extended arms dodges a man ascending the stares, who gets sprinkled
Whoops, sorry
- Bruce makes it outside, sets Sam down on the grass
Sam looks up innocently at Bruce, finished
Oh, you're all done, huh
-e-a-utiful
- Bruce pulls up in his Ford Tauras to a cluster of cars unloading kids
2003   passes by
Wow, nice car, huh
Yeah, if you want to rub your success in people's faces
Then Bruce notices a big medical van in front of the school with a
What's with the hubbub
We're having a blood drive
Creepy
Needles, yech
Oh, that's a nice response
9
mean, it's just s o
Helpful and life saving
'mon, that's your
blood
It's in your body and  don't think it's supposed to come out
Besides, they stockpile that stuff
They have an endless supply frozen in a warehouse somewhere then tell everyone there's a shortage
They do not
Now stop it
'm                        * giving
have a very rare blood                     * type,  positive
Well, 'm  positive
positive they aint touchin' me with no needle
Grace sighs in exasperation, starts out when
(suddenly remembers something) She places a     on the rearview mirror
What's that
Prayer beads
The kids made 'em
Keep you safe
Well,  hope they work, cause it's going take a miracle to get me to work on time
- Bruce is stuck in bumper to bumper traffic
He stares at the prayer beads with a "thanks alot" look
10
big accident ahead
Bruce looks at his watch, he's screwed
person is     , Bruce is oblivious
This is just my luck
Bruce's  sounds
He checks it
The meeting's starting, perfect
(thinks) Screw it
He looks to the right of the car in front of him, then peels off onto the shoulder, passing tons of cars
(laughs) Catch you later, lemmings 1 It's kill or be killed, only the strong survive, no guts, no glory1 : Bruce pulls over, fumes
(looking heavenward) Thank you
- Bruce screeches into a space, races out of the car, bumping over a trash can, goes back to pick it up, sees a who sits peacefully next to a paint bucket and sign boards
The various "warnings" change daily
Today's reads: Bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then continues on
- Bruce rushes through the newsroom, rounds a corner and runs right into , the endlessly yammering

Bruce the goose
Morning, Buddy
Don't even move,  got somethin' special today
My mom made it just for you
Well, that's- Bobby,  gotta go- 'm late
(bending down) You like Quiche
He comes back up, proudly presents a slice of quiche
You know, contrary to popular belief the quiche was actually invented by the Mayans, then stolen by the French
They shoulda said, "Hey, that quiche ain't yours, it's Mayan
" Bobby belts out a laugh
Bobby,  can't, -- Just taste it, taste it
Bobby shoves a bite into Bruce's mouth
Bruce feigns liking it with exasperation
Mmm, delicious,  really gotta go
That's a buck seventy-five
Can you get Kelly- Ahh
Bruce tosses the thought, digs into his pocket, fishing for cash
(excited) Oh, two o'clock, two o'clock, two-o- five, two-ten
12
Bruce glances over, annoyed but freezes at the sight of sexy anchorwoman,   across the room
Way out of our league, huh
Bruce offers his money to Bobby
You know,  saw them editing your cookie piece
Really
They must have gotten high or something, cause they was orderin' everything,  had
Hey, how long have you been interested in pastry
'Cause 've got an aunt who makes baklava twenty layers deep
(holding money out) Bobby
(gets a brilliant idea) Maybe you could do a story on her
Bruce tosses the money on the cart, heads off
Keep the change
(calling after) 'll give her a call, we'll talk about it later
- : Is something killing your kids
Find out tonight at eleven
Bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then continues on
13
The morning meeting is well in progress
Leading the group is the station manager and Bruce's boss,  , 50's, a constant furrow in his brow
Also in the room: Bruce's fellow field reporter and rival , 30' s , a walking statement
Impeccable posture, perfect speech, perfect everything and he knows it
, the ever jovial sports reporter; always tanned, vain weatherman,   and segment producer Ally Loman
Okay, promos are approved, let's-- Ah, isn't that last one a little misleading
mean, the story's about flu shots
Do we have to scare people to death
No, just into watching
Or  could change it to: "Slow news day, come yawn with us
At eleven
" Sniffles at eleven is nice
Attack of the killer sniffles
(to Dallas) The tanning booth is starting to zap your brain, you know that
don't use a tanning booth
beat and they all crack up
* Come on
You're turning orange
* * He looks Florida ripe to me
* More laughs
* 14
would have swore  already said this, but promos are approved
Now                  * can we move on
* Jack, shouldn't the promos be                       * focusing on Pete's retirement
This is his last week
(leading) Yeah, yeah
Any word on the open anchor position, Jack
Evan, you'11 know something when know something
Bruce bursts into the room
The meeting stops
Jack doesn't need to say anything, he just looks at his watch
Sorry, Jack
It wasn't my fault
The traffic was -- You guys already played the spots
Nice story, Bruce, but we're going with Evan's piece on the sex scandal at the mayor's office for sweeps
This hits Bruce hard
beat of silence
And that's the way the cookie crumbles
The others chuckle
Only Ally remains sympathetic
'm just messin' with you, Bruce
See you've got to remember that the news room is like a cookie
More laughs
(re: Evan's perfect posture) That's great Evan
() 15
(cont'd) Is you're posture naturally that good, or do you have to shove a stick up there
Okay, knock it off
Bruce we're holding your story in reserve
Now, can we get back to the board so we have something to air today
Jack continues with assignments
Evan sits smugly, as Bruce slides down into his chair, deflated
- Jack is at Bobby's cart, paying for a sandwich
Bruce catches up
to him
Jack, Jack, hey
Can  talk to you for a second
Sure, Bruce
What do you need
Sweeps
Jack takes his sandwich and leaves
Bobby leans to Bruce
Don't worry about it
called my aunt, we're on
Bruce looks at Bobby, continues after and catches Jack
Look, Jack
Hear me out, 'm getting desperate man,  am pushing forty and what have  got to show for it
The point is, 've hit some kind of a ceiling here
Some kind of anti-Bruce barrierI And Evan is just lovin' it, by the way
He gets the good stories, he gets on sweeps
Maybe  have to be more like Evan
You don't want to be like Evan
Evan's an asshole
can be an asshole
16
No, Bruce
You can't
Bruce thinks, then flips Jack's sandwich plate over
It scatters on the floor
Jack and Bruce stare at each other for a beat
Are you going to pick that up
Yeah, 'm sorry
Bruce bends down, starts picking up Jack's food
It's just- this anchor position looming, it's gotten me nuts
He hands the plate to Jack, as sexy anchorwoman saunters by
Hi, Susan
Hi, Susan
Hi, Jack
Bruce blanches at this obvious snubbing
Look, Bruce
You're a good reporter
You make people laugh
God knows today we can use it
Bruce slumps, he's heard this a thousand times before
* * (beat) Alright, tell you what
It's the                   * 23rd anniversary of the Maid of the Mist
want you at Niagara Falls in an hour
Maid of the Mist
That's always live
Yep
Evan gets the live feeds
17
Well now you and Evan get the live feeds
'm going live
In sweeps
Yes, but watch yourself, Bruce
've seen your outtakes
Bruce hugs Jack, pressing the sandwich against his chest
Yes 1 You will not regret this, Jack
(releases Jack) will not forget you when  go national
Bruce takes off, Jack looks down, peels the sandwich off his chest
We hear children's joyous
- playing at Grace's self-starter business, a one room day care center filled with children and toys
Grace turns, reacts
Martin, are you eating the glitter again
- He shakes his head "no
" Martin
Open your mouth
Abra su boca
He does
His tongue sparkles with glitter
Oh, you're not huh
Well, then you've got a bad case of Liberace
Grace's sister, Debbie, enters
She's wearing a nurse's outfit
Her youngest, , 3, runs over to greet her
Mommy1 18
They didn't teach you Spanish in nursing school, did they
Well, it seemed like they were speaking a foreign language sometimes, but no
Problemo
Martin has decided to explore new food groups
(back to Martin) Martin, this is for art
Like this
She spreads paste on the paper, sprinkles glitter
Is it so wrong to tie them up
eb -- Ma rt i n
Martin is busted with the paste spreader stuck in his mouth
Grace snatches it
Okay, go rinse your mouth with water
Lave su boca
Go

You should have some of your own
Don't start

Saved by the bell

Live
That's greatI Yep, it's happenin', hun

You know what that means
() 20
(cont'd) They're seeing if  can think on my feet, like you might have to do in a live news anchor situation
Oh, my gosh
This is happening for us, Grace
What we've always talked about
Jack practically came out and told me
Grace quickly switches gears
She experienced the premature- celebration before
Wait, what do you mean practically
Well, he didn't spell it out, but this is exactly what happened to Susan Ortega right before she was bumped up to the desk
(being cautious) just want to make sure we're not getting too ahead of ourselves
totally agree, but in the mean time you should start thinking about what coast you want to live on
Ally interrupts, indicating the time
Oh, they're calling me,  gotta go
Good luck, honey
love you
* * love you

They want you close to the falls
What for
'll get soaked
That's the point
They want you to hold up this
She hands Bruce a very stupid looking, blue "falls" shaped with the
Part of the condition of us getting the exclusive
Bruce takes the umbrella
'     ' Lovely
Glad  wore my tap shoes

Okay, 90                      * seconds
Bruce looks upward at the ridiculous umbrella
Mutters encouragement to himself
22, 90 seconds, going live
Think anchor, think dignity, (glances up toward umbrella) Ignore umbrella
Just have fun
: Some of the   watch the feed
Pete Fineman is reporting
but because of the fast response by our local fire fighters, the toxic chemicals were cleaned up without incident
Susan
The female co-anchor,  : Bruce Nolan is standing by at Niagara Falls with a report on the Maid of the Mist sightseeing boat, but before we go live to Bruce, we have an announcement to make
As everyone knows, after 33 years, our beloved Pete Fineman is retiring
Pete smiles a proud, heart-felt smile
Pete's shoes are virtually impossible to fill, but the show must go on
And we could think of no one better than our very own Evan Baxter
Listening to the feed
His
He stands in shock
Evan is seated next to Susan
23
Congratulations, Evan
Looks like we'll be sitting side by side from now on
Thanks, Susan
' m thrilled and honored
Like you said, no one can replace the great Pete Fineman, but 'll do my best
have to say am so proud to be a part of our local community
Of Buffalo think a great city is a lot like a great recipe really
Put in some hard working citizens, add some care givers, maybe a few nuts
The other news anchors and Evan himself chuckle at "his" joke
Bruce listens on the feed, beyond stunned
(') All sprinkled with the strength and love of our good families, that ultimately creates a sweet place to live
Thank you
(touched) Wow
That was amazing
And now let's go live to wacky Bruce Nolan out at Niagara Falls
- Bruce stands like a deer in headlights, drenched, holding the ridiculous umbrella
Ally sig nals Bruce he's on
He stares into camera, numb
- The kids are gone
Grace watches the  with a few other teachers
She's concerned
Talk honey, talk
- Jack rushes in, looking at Bruce on the monitor
What's going on
24
We've got a Walt Disney
Frozen solid
He may not have audio
Check his feed, have Susan cover
- Susan reacts to the message in her ear piece
We may be having a bit of technical difficulty
Evan smiles in the background, clearly enjoying himself
- Feed's good, Jack
Come on, Bruce, talk damn-it
Okay, get ready to pull the plug
- Please baby, say something
- Like popping out of a coma, Bruce surges in
Surprisingly, seems very up and fine
Thank you, Susan 1 Bruce Nolan here aboard the Maid of the Mist at Niagara falls
- Thank you, God
25, - (sighs relief) Thank God
Jack pats the Director's shoulder, heads out of the room
- First off, " want to add another congratulations to Evan Baxter
It's good to see what someone with real talent can accomplish when great opportunities are given to him instead of me
(still smiling) Anyway, 'm here,  believe with Katherine Hepburn's mom
Tell me, why did you toss the blue "heart of the ocean" jewel over the railing of Titanic
The Old Woman doesn't know what to say
Did you feel guilty at all letting Leonardo Decaprio freeze, while you were safe floating on the big door
Do you think he would have survived if you had taken turns, or were you too afraid to freeze your big fat ass off
- Jack rockets back into the room
Did  just hear
Well,  guess that's the way life works, isn't it
Some people are drenched, freezing to death, on a stupid boat, with a stupid umbrella
(heaves the umbrella) while others who aren't fit to kiss my willy, are sitting in a nice, comfy news room, sucking up all the glory111 26
- This isn't happening
This isn't happening
- Bruce takes off walking, the camera follows
Now, lets speak to the owner
Come on in here, Bill
Bill shakes his head "" as Bruce pulls him into frame
Bill, you
've been running the Maid of the Mist for 23 years
Tell me, why do you think  didn't get the anchor job
Hey, man,  don't want any-- Do you think it's my hair
(Bruce messes his hair like crazy) Maybe my teeth aren't white enough
Or like the great falls, is the bedrock of my life slowly erroding underneath me
(moving closer to camera, to an inch away) Erroding
Erroooding
Errodiiiing
- All work has stopped
Stunned staffers stare at the monitor
- Jack stands with his jaw dropped, snaps out of it
Alright, cut the feed
Cut to black if you have to
'm on it
27
- Bruce is now licking the camera lens
He steps back and signs-off
Smooth as silk
'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness news
Back to you fuckers 1 - Susan Ortega stares frozen blankly into camera
: - Bruce is     , his box of possessions spilling on the ground
Bruce  at the building
- Bruce carries his box to his car, when he
street  is hassling the
Pushing him around, breaking and painting over his signs
Instinctively, Bruce walks over
Hey, come on guys
What are you doin'
Just leave him alone
They turn, look at Bruce, laugh and head off
Bruce helps the Sign Guy up, looks after the Gang
Yeah, you'd better keep walkin'
They stop cold, turn back to Bruce and
Bruce attempts to run, but they leap on him in a big dog pile, swinging and kicking
Bruce is left with a bloody lip, lying beside his car
We hear the sound of smashing glass and scratching metal and the gang running off
Bruce slowly gets up
Reveal Bruce's car, ' ,   and the word ""
-e-a-utiful
(looks up) () 28
(cont'd) Just what you get for trying to help someone
Bruce gets in, pulls out of the parking lot passing the Homeless Man who sits beaten up holding a scrawled out sign "
" Get a clue, buddy
'  - Bruce is pacing, holding an   to his swollen lip
Thank God you're alright
God, yeah
Let's thank God
Thanks for everything, Lord
am so honored that my horrible demise is a part of your loving and mysterious plan
Bruce, don't talk like that
Oh, don't worry, he's not listening
If he is he doesn't care
Have you seen the news lately
We got gangs, we got drugs, we got corruption
What kind of God lets that happen
Every time we cure a disease he comes up with a new one
(goes into God character) Yeah, is this the lab
Yeah, it's God
They've just come up with a treatment for syphilis down there
think it's time to release the tainted monkey
Oh, and there's a guy in Ohio who's praying for strength and wisdom, blind him and cut off his legs
So God is torturing us
Think about it, Grace
God is all- powerful
He could fix everything in five minutes if he wanted to
() 29
(cont'd) But he doesn't want to
He doesn't like me
Sam starts
Oh, Perfect
(to the dog) But you're aim isn't so good, 'm over herel Bruce, please
This isn't his fault
Of course not
(hushed tone) It's part of the mysterious plan
Grace puts Sam outside
Returns, trying to calm Bruce
Honey, you're mad right now
It's understandable
And what Evan did was slimy and wrong
But your job doesn't matter to me
You matter to me
You could've really been hurt
'm just glad you're okay
Okay
News flash: 'm not okayi And 'm not okay with the fact that you think everything is okay
'm not okay with a mediocre job
'm not okay with a mediocre apartment
'm not okay with a mediocre
Bruce angrily swipes at the table knocking the photos and the photo albums to floor
Is that what you have, Bruce
mediocre life
Well, 'm sorry for being a piece in your mediocre puzzle
Terrific
'm drowning and you throw me a brick
Grace starts to cry
30
Perfect
'll have the worst day of my life with a side order of guilt, please
--  don't need this
Bruce grabs his keys and heads out
- It's  now
Bruce drives, going nowhere in particular
His frustration is turning to desperation
Okay, God
You want me to talk to you
Then talk back
Tell me what's going on
What should do
Give me a sign
Bruce passes a    , doesn't notice
'm right here
Speak to me
stepping into the crosswalk, steps back out of the way

Bruce is oblivious
All  need is some guidance
Please send me a signal

The va rie d s igns re ad: Yi eld , Wrong Way, Dead End, Do Not Enter, Stop
Oh well,  guess you don't care
Bruce spots the   hanging on the rearview mirror
Okay, we'll do it your way
(pulls the beads from the mirror) Lord,  need a miracle
Please help me
31
He hits a bump and the
Bruce reaches down, fishes for the beads
Come on, where'd you go
(holds them up in triumph) Ah ha
And
11 '
-   - Bruce stumbles out, surveys his demolished car, then looks at the beads in his hands
He begins to laugh maniacally
He spots the lake, starts running toward it like a madman, He looks heavenward, challenging the Infinite
Okay, if that's the way you want it
The gloves are off, pal
Let me see a little wrath
Smite me oh mighty smiteri What, no pestilence no boils
Come on, you got me on the ropes, don't you want to finish me off
You're the one who should be fired
The only one around here not doing his job is
What are we, you're little pet project hobby you tinker with now and again
Answer me
beat of silence then Bruce's
He cynically chuckles at the timing, checks it, sees 772-5623
Sorry, don't know you, wouldn't call you if  did
Bruce walks off toward his wrecked car, it
: - The  continues
We are in
'  -  - Bruce wakes, slaps at the alarm clock, groggy, reaches for the phone, finally realizes it's the beeper
He gets up, begrudgingly, checks it
The same number
32
Well, hello again 772-5623, don't hold your breath
Bruce tosses the pager on the bed, heads for the bathroom
The beeper
Bruce stops in his tracks, turns, opens the window, grabs the beeper and
It against a telephone pole
He calmly continues to the bathroom
note is stuck in the bathroom mirror, with an old picture of he and Grace in happier times
The note simply says: "
Grace" Peering over top of the note, Bruce sees Sam circling on the rug
Oh, no
- Bruce runs down the stairs carrying the trickling, Sam
- Bruce sets Sam on the grass
Sam looks up, finished
What's the point
, ,
Bruce walks over to the shattered beeper
He picks up a small piece of it containing the  read out: 772-5623 - : '  - - 33
Denied that promotion at work
Is life unfair
Everywhere you turn is there someone less talented than you reaping all the benefits
Is your name Bruce
Then do we have the job for you
We're located at 77256 23rd Street
Bruce reaches for a pen, begins jotting down the address
So come on down, or we'll just keep beepin' ya
- An old building on the outskirts of town
faded sign painted on the wall reads,
Bruce's demolished car enters frame
He studies the area and building suspiciously
Bruce cautiously moves towards the structure and then, He
Perfect
He gets out, shakes off his sopping leg, and heads inside
- Bruce enters and checks the
It reads: Pers onnel    Rm
7 Ac coun ting Rm
7 Security      Rm
7 Creativ e     Rm
7 (
) You're looking for room 7
Bruce turns to see a  mopping the floor
He looks at Bruce's wet leg, offers the mop
Want me to even those up for you
34
(feigns a smile) How would  get to room 7
That'd be on the seventh floor
Stairs are right over there
What about the elevator
He points to an elevator bank a couple of steps away
Out of order
Bruce heads for the stairs
You mind giving me a hand with this floor
What
Yeah,  mind
He continues on
The stairwell door opens up to a   with a at the end of an otherwise empty space
Bruce hears someone tinkering atop a tall ladder extending into a hole in the ceiling
Excuse me
Hello
'm, ah, looking for whoever runs this joint
(
) Be right with y
a, just fixin' a light
Tell me if it's working
and an     , shining down blinding Bruce
Yep, seems to be
(wiping his eyes) Kinda bright, though
35
An electrician, silhouetted in the bright light, descends the ladder
(
) Yeah, it is for most people
They spend their lives in the dark
As he talks he steps down next to Bruce and we see that it is the
(') thinkin' they can hide from me
The two stand, angelically illuminated
Bruce tries to put everything together
Oh, the elevator's broken, huh
Yeah, but 'll get around to it
The Janitor     and the light goes off
You installed a clapper
Nope
Catchy jingle, though
(sings) , (claps twice) You can't get it out of your head
gotta go
Okay, but the boss'11 be right out
The Janitor unzips his uniform, revealing a very nice suit
He extends his hand to Bruce
You must be Bruce
've been expecting you
Oh, this is hilarious
So you're the boss and the electrician and the janitor
36
Nothin' wrong with rollin' up your sleeves, son
People underestimate the benefits of good 'ol manual labor
There's freedom in it
Happiest people in the world stink like hell at the end of the day
He strolls down the room, takes a seat behind the big desk
Your father knew that
He was a damn good welder
Bruce approaches the desk
How do you know my father
And how did you get my pager number
Oh,  know a lot about you Bruce
Pretty much everything there is to know
Everything you've ever said, done or thought about doin', is right there in that file cabinet
He points out a single drawer file cabinet
(sarcastic) Wow, a whole drawer
Just for me
Mind if  take a look
It's your life
Bruce pulls the drawer and it  , -- The Janitor casually pulls a file
Now this last entry was a little disturbing
He thumps the file cabinet with his fist and the drawer dramatically sucks closed,
The Janitor reads from the file
(reads, scanning) Thanks for everything, Lord
() 37
(cont'd) am so honored that my horrible demise is a part of your loving and mysterious plan
The gloves are off, pal
Smite me oh mighty smiter
(aside) 'm not much for blaspheming but that one made me laugh
Oh, and let's not forget "What kind of a God would let this happen
mean, have you seen then news lately
" Bruce stands, dazed
Who are you
'm the creator of the heavens and the earth
'm the alpha & omega
The first and the last
Sorry, it's not ringing a bell
/ 'm God, Bruce
Oh, you're God
Well that explains everything1 That's how you know everything about me
That's how you got up to the seventh floor so quickly
(placating) Well, it's really nice to meet you
Thanks for the Grand Canyon and, ah, good luck with the apocalypse
Bruce turns to leave, He tries again, and again
Okay,  don't know how you're doing that, but  really gotta go
This place is obviously rigged in some way
We're on some freaky hidden camera show
(playing to the "cameras") for which  will not sign a release, by the way
But you know what, 'd be a little more impressed if you didn't use the cheesy file cabinet illusion
() 38
(cont'd) Everyone with a      brain in their head would know that      the drawer is being fed through the       wall from behind-- Bruce pulls the file cabinet from the wall, sees it has a normal back
Okay
That's good
That's a good one
Bruce quickly puts his hands behind his back
Okay, God
How many fingers am holding out
Bruce extends three fingers
Three
He quickly pulls one finger in
Two
Bruce begins switching fingers rapidly
God doesn't miss a beat
Four
Nine
Six
Eight
One
One final attempt, Bruce holds seven fingers
Okay, how about now
He quickly pulls in two fingers
Seven
HAl Bruce proudly presents his single hand of five extended fingers to God, then immediately notices he has AAAHHHl 39, He shakes his fingers wildly and the two extra fingers disappear
God approaches Bruce
You've been doing a lot of complaining about me, Bruce
And quite frankly, 'm tired of it
Bruce backs away from God
You stay away from me
don't know what your doing
But whatever you're doing is probably actionable
Well, that's not very neighborly
brought you here to offer you a job
Job
Wh at job
My job
You think you can do it better, so here's your chance
When you leave this building you will be endowed with all my powers
Sure, whatever you say, Pal
He turns to go but     in the Janitor uniform, holding the mop
All the power of God
Bruce glances back at the empty desk, turns back again and God the Janitor has also vanished
beat, then Bruce sprints out of the room
- Bruce barrels out of the building -- Okay, that did not happen
He races to his car stepping in the  , but this time his foot doesn't sink, he
He paus es f or a bea t -- 40
No
He races on
' Bruce jumps in, turns the key, the car turns over but doesn't start
'm having a breakdown
That's what it is
Just a normal, everyday psychotic episode, brought on by tumor or brain lesion
We hear the car wind down to nothing
Bruce releases the key pounds the steering wheel in frustration
(to the car) Come on, startI The car  starts
(denial) Well, that was lucky
Bruce backs up, peels out
: "'       " Bruce drives, whistling the tune, catches himself, immediately stops whistling
Okay, just relax here
did not meet God and  do not have his powers
(laughs) If that was God, then 'm Mario Andretti
Instantly, Bruce's car  , races through traffic, dodging and passing cars right and left
41
Suddenly there is a        standing before Bruce waving a red flag
Bruce swerves to avoid the man and  into a pit stop
Several other red-suited Italian men engulf the car
Bruce watches in amazement as the professional racing team jacks up his car, slaps on , gases him up, etc
leans into the driver's window
Hey Mario, did you get that box of dressing  sent you
Bruce responds against his will    -- (in perfect Italian) Si, dovete venire sopra per il pranzo un certo tempo
(: Yes, you must come over for dinner some time
) Bruce reacts shocked
The crew backs off and urges him on in Italian
Vete l Ve tel Bruce's car peels out on it's own, he struggles to control the wheel, finally pulling over to a curb
His car door won't open so he has to crawl out of the driver's window
He rushes onto the sidewalk, backing away from his normal looking Tauras
Not knowing what to do, he slips into a diner
- Bruce quickly walks to a back corner booth
The only other patron is an   seated at the counter
It isn't real, it isn't real, it isn't real
An older
Sally Kirkland-type , order pad in hand, stands listening to Bruce with a raised eyebrow
Oh hi, ah, coffee please
The waitress pours him a cup
42
We've got a special on soup today
No, that's okay
It's tomato
Alright, okay
She heads off
Bruce sits thinking
Could it be real
He looks at the  down at the end of the table, holds out his hand and the The  slides into his other hand
Bruce is half scared, half thrilled
He pours some cream and sugar into his cup, looks around the table
Excuse me  need a spoooo
Bruce chokes up a spoon into his hands, wipes it off with his napkin
That's alright,  found one
The Old Man eyes Bruce suspiciously, gets up and moves further down the counter
The Waitress sets down the soup, heads off, then turns back
lie to my sister
What
(becoming emotional) And 'm sleeping with my best friend's husband
know he's just using me but
'm just so tired of being alone
don't know why 'm telling you all this
Just seems like you'd understand
Okay
43
(sets the check down) Take care of that whenever you're ready
Bruce looks at the soup
His look grows intense
He slowly raises his hands over the soup bowl
: The front door blows open, as    through the diner and with all the flourish of Moses at the Red Sea, little cockroach scurries across the table, climbs up the edge of the bowl and walks through to the other side
(
) Havin' fun
Bruce is startled and the soup splashes back to normal collapsing on the cockroach
He looks up at God standing beside the booth
Bruce is now awestruck
You- He- Thy
Let's take a walk
- God leans down, lets the little soup covered cockroach go
God and Bruce then walk along the lake shore
(re: the cockroach) Most people want to kill these guys
'm quite fond of em'
Very streamlined design
Like little armored tanks
'know, they can hold their breath for forty minutes and their cells divide only once per molting cycle creating a cytoskeleton with cell adhesion that
(catching himself) Oh, this is a bit over your head, isn't it
Off Bruce's look
44
Okay, let me explain the rules
Rules
Yeah, you left in such a rush didn't get a chance to explain
Well the two extra fingers freaked me out a little bit
(laughs) figured that would get your attention
did the same thing to Ghandi, he couldn't eat for three weeks
Now, here's the deal
You have all my power
Use it any way you choose
There are only two rules
You can't tell anyone you're God
Believe me you don't want that kind of attention
And you can't mess with free will
Uh huh
Can -ask why
(excited) Yes you can
That's the beauty it
Suddenly a
Bruce looks to the sail, oddly, then
-  God and Bruce are now walking about 100 feet from the shore
They watch the sailboat pass
Bruce is awestruck
This is amazing
Oh, speaking of amazing
God dips his hand in the Lake and pulls out
He pockets them as he talks
45
Since you're finished with these, think 'll hang to 'em
Might come in handy someday
-  - God and Bruce are tiny figures on the river, as God begins to walk away
'll be seein' ya
Where are you going
'm taking a vacation
God can't take a vacation
Can he
Can you
Ever hear of the Dark Ages
Besides, 'm covered
You can fix everything in five minutes if you want to, right
Right
Left alone, Bruce begins to carefully tip toe back to shore, progresses to a full sprint
- Grace and Debbie stand at the check-out stand
Grace flips through a celeb magazine, as Debbie places the last few items from the cart to the conveyor belt
In the background, throughout, Debbie's daughter, Zoe is grabbing random items off the shelves and placing them on the belt
(re: magazine) Gosh, this girl is so talented and all they ever talk about is her hair
46
Yeah, she should marry somebody famous, take the focus off
Grace checks her cell phone screen
We would have heard it ring
know
It's just that he usually calls during the day
He just needs to blow off some steam, he'll be fine
hope so
've never seen him                        * that mad
An d  lashed back--                        * Wow, you lashed
You never lash
'm impressed
feel bad for him
He's wanted anchor for so long
Zoe begins pulling groups of items onto the belt
Well, 've been praying to win the lottery for fifteen years, but it's not going to happen
You know, it's not all about money
The  finishes ringing the last item
That'll be four hundred and twenty- seven, eighty
- What
Debbie looks in a bag, pulls out a handful of various counter items
Zoe giggles and proudly holds up one of the hundred or so Tic-Tac mint containers
Zoe
(to Clerk) () 47
(cont'd) Hang on,  might need you to un- check a few things
The people in line hem and haw, exasperated
Come on, lady
(snaps) Hey, everybody back-off i Zoe laughs, enjoying the commotion
Listen,  better get back
want to be there for him
You're a saint, Grace
What can  say,  love him
And if know Bruce, he's out there wandering around with the weight of the world on his shoulders
T0: - Bruce struts down the street the embodiment of confidence
He turns shooting a finger at a fire hydrant, it run off their front steps, start playing
, comes' walking toward him
As she passes he and turns to watch her
And he saw that it was good
He spots a    mannequin in a store window display, wearing a cool, casu   al outfit
He closes his eyes
When he opens them, '        and the mannequin is dressed in   his clothes
He checks his reflection
better
Bruce rounds the corner, sees the   that beat him up, hanging out in the alley
-e-a-utifull 48
Bruce approaches the gang
Hey guys, remember me
The gang members turn to Bruce
#1 Oh look, it's the hero
#2 Hungry for another can of whoop- ass
#3 Your stereo sounds great in my car, man
He and a couple other gang members laugh and high-five
Look,  don't want to fight you guys
So as soon as you apologize, 'll be on my way
beat, then the Hoods
few circle behind, surrounding Bruce
#1 Oh, yeah
'll apologize
The day a monkey climbs out of my butt
What a coincidence
That's today
The Hood gets a  , starts gyrating around, then a comes climbing out the back of his baggy pants
The Big Guy looks at Hood #1
Did that come out of your butt, man
Hood #1 faints from shock
Now 'm going to have to teach the rest of you guys a lesson
49
#2 Yeah, you and whose army
Just me
and me
steps out from behind a stack of crates
And me, and me, and me, me, me, me, me and me and me
As Bruce talks,  ' begin popping out from various spots, a doorway, hanging down from a fire escape, a dumpster pops open, six Bruce's jump out
RABBIT1 -- Hood #2 is instantly tackled by   -- kneels down behind a hood,   pushes him down over his back
The two Bruce's high-five -- Hood climbs a fire escape
gives a hand up to , who takes pursuit
leans out of a window  a potted plant over his head -- - , Our Bruce stands in the middle of the action, happily watching the mayhem
#2 Let's get out of here, manl Hood #2 takes off running, the gang members follow
Okay guys, Kum Ba Yal The Bruce's jog over, leaping and diving into Bruce's body
'll take it from here
Bruce takes a deep breath,    , -- 50
- The gang streams out of the alley screaming, Bruce exits the alley, the monkey at his side
He looks down to the monkey
Back home for you, little one
The monkey takes off back into the alley, as we see  #1 stumbling to his feet
#1 NoI   NOOOOO1 He takes off running, the monkey in hot pursuit
He belches and one last locust flies out
He reacts to the unpleasant aftertaste and walks off
: - We widen to an   of him standing on the top of Buffalo's tallest
Clouds swirl behind him
He looks out over the vast city lights, opens his arms and proclaims to the world
Bruce poses in dramatic god-like form, lightning crashes behind him
He is an awesome god
'  - Grace sits on the floor next to the coffee table with a box of photos working on the album
She takes a sip of wine, sets down the glass
Sam walks over and laps up the wine
(to Sam) Well, at least  have someone to drink with
Grace hears Bruce coming up the stairs, singing
51
What if God was one of us
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on a bus
Trying to make his way
Grace reacts a bit surprised by Bruce's happy tone, she gets up, opens the door and there stands , beaming smile, holding a very unique
(finishing song) home
(re: the flowers) Oh, my God
You can call me Bruce
Where have you been
You're so
happy
Who wouldn't be on a night like this
(holding out the flowers) For you
Grace takes the flowers, gives Bruce a kiss, still sizing up his mood
These are amazing
What are they
It's a totally new breed
cross pollination between tulips and Daisies
call them Todayzees
Todayzees
Okay
Grace goes to put them in water
- Bruce, is there something you're not telling me
52
Nothing of this world
Why
What do you mean, why
Last night you weren't exactly happy with life
Last night,  was only human
Bruce backs out of the kitchen seductively
- Bruce breezes through, casually instructs the stereo as he passes
4, Track 7
The Stereo illuminates and Barry White music plays
- Bruce opens the doors, steps onto the balcony
He surveys the cloudy sky, reaches up with his hand and ,
Still not completely satisfied he reaches up toward the moon and makes a  ,
: - Earth far off in the distance - And with a the  starts
Bruce adds a finishing touch by adding several stars with points of his finger
Grace joins Bruce on the balcony and is taken aback by the perfectly orchestrated sky
Wow, it really cleared up
've never seen the moon that big
Bruce puts his arms around Grace from behind
53
We shouldn't waste it
Bruce starts kissing her neck
Grace turns,
they kiss and a lights the sky behind them
The kiss ends
Bedroom
Five minutes
- Grace grabs a neglige from the drawer, heads into the bathroom
Bruce enters, adjusts the ambience of the room, with a quick puff of air, with a gesture
His clothes magically fall away
- Grace slips her neglige on, begins brushing her hair
'11 be out in a minute

)                                * Don't rush yourself
Sometimes                        * anticipation can heighten the                         * pleasure

Standing at the door with both arms extended toward the bathroom like an
Suddenly the light hits him from the open bathroom door and he quickly strikes a casual pose
Grace stands in the open doorway, panting like an animal
She dives on Bruce, attacking him
- - In international news, Japanese relief workers are staging a desperate effort to rescue hundreds of people stranded by a freak tidal wave that hit Kitamoto City
We see remote footage of Japanese families being airlifted from root tops
Scientists say the tsunami may have been caused by what they're describing as "unusual lunar activity
" More on this, as it develops
Grace half watches the newscast as she finishes breakfast
- Bruce lies blissfully asleep
Big smile, life is good
Then, we hear  - Like distant voices  all at once
Bruce wakes with a start
He looks around puzzled, sticks his finger in his ear checking his hearing as the voices fade away
- Circling, getting ready to go on the carpet
Bruce casually warns
Sam
Uh uh uh
55
Sam looks at Bruce for a beat, then  walks into bathroom, raises the toilet seat with his nos e, and ,        (, '  )
He looks proudly back at Bruce
Good boy
Grace places breakfast on the table
Bruce comes out, fully dressed with a spring in his step
Good morning
(gushy-lovey, sing songy) Good morning
Cooked you grilled cheese
Oo, my favey
Bruce sits, Grace sets down his plate, leans close
Last night was just
Heavenly
Mmm hmm
Bruce enjoys his grilled cheese
It's funny, but when  woke up this morning, It felt like my boobs were bigger
Bruce looks away, guilty, trying to be nonchalant
(holding them up) Do they look bigger to you
Huh
Ah, no, they, ah, look the same to me
56
They aren't
They are clearly bigger
She holds them
They're definitely bigger
They feel huge to me
Bruce throws up his hands
You got me
Probably just a hormonal thing
(takes a quick final bite) Well, enjoy your breakfast, 've gotta run
Where are you going
He stops, turns
new confident Bruce
To get my job back
: '  - Bruce heads for his severely beat-up junker car whistling "What if God were One of Us
" ' - He gets in, fastens his seat belt, as two teenagers cruise by on skateboards, stop outside Bruce's window
(sincerely impressed) Wow, nice car man
Well, it gets me from  to
- Reveal Bruce's car is now a brand new  2003 He starts and revs     and peels out
57
- Bruce turns the corner into bumper to bumper traffic
No problem, the traffic magically opens up for him, cars instantly swerving right and left clearing a path for Bruce
He waves as he passes
And the last shall be first
- , , performs some standard   by "attacking" a "criminal" (trainer) on the run
, a reporter from a rival station is wrapping up his story
certainly wouldn't want to be a fugitive on the run with Hank, Buffalo's number one police dog, on the job
This is Phil Sidleman reporting from The Police Canine Training center
(beat) And cut it
Let's go, guys
The crew start to wrap up
- Watching the action from the side, holding his own home video camera
Phil spots him
Hey, channel seven, right
You're the guy that went crazy
Yeah,  had a bad day
But things are lookin' up
What are you doin' here
Just lookin' for a story
(waving the video tape) Well, this pond's fished out
Pretty standard stuff anyway
58
don't know
My instinct tells me there's something more
Well, go with that
It's served you well in the past, right
Phil and a couple of his crew laugh, as they load the last of their equipment into the van and shut the doors
(
) Hey, Hank found something1 Phil turns back, Bruce and he exchange a glance
Hank is  , making a
The Policeman jogs over, joins the trainer
They watch as Hank
We got a bodyI (to his crew) Shit
Get the camera, now
-  ' It
The  yanks at the door
It's locked and the keys are inside Bruce casually turns his camera on, gives Phil a "tough break" look, heads for the scene, as Phil and his crew scramble around the van
: The body of Jimmy Hoffa was uncovered in a field today outside of a canine training center in Buffalo New York
Local Buffalo freelance field reporter Bruce Nolan was the first on the scene
59
We cut to the pre-taped story
Bruce stands with Hank and his trainer before camera, the body being exhumed from the ground behind him
Since the disapearence of Teamster president Jimmy Hoffa in the nineteen sixties, his whereabouts have remained one of this country's great unsolved mysteries
That is until just moments ago, when during a routine training session, a police dog named Hank sniffed his way right into the history books
As you can see behind us, the body is being carefully exhumed and will be transported to a hospital facility where  testing will confirm the identity
That, of course, only a formality as in a bizarre twist, the body was found buried with a birth certificate and complete set of dental records
(rubs Hank's neck) Sort of a two-in-one for Hank today, as moments later, he busted a local news camera crew with four kilo's of marijuana
We see footage of     , being cuffed on the ground, as large stacks of marijuana plants are being pulled from the van
've never seen it before,  swear - As Bruce pulls up in front of the building the flies back into the bushes and the as though being sloppily painted with invisible brushes
Bruce exits the car and smooths past the Homeless Sign Guy, who sits in his usual spot
His sign reads: "
" - Bruce cruises through the office, fielding greetings
60
Nice Job, Bruce
Way to go, buddy
get 'em, Bruce, etc
Susan Ortega smooths up to Bruce
Hi, Bruce
(surprised) Oh, Susan
Hi
Good work, 'm impressed
She give's Bruce a "look" and continues on
Bruce is a bit inflated by the encounter
Bobby the pastry cart guy wheels his cart up along side

Bruce is forced to stop
Tell you    what

Bobby, -- Come on, it's my mother's recipe she's practically cripple
Bobby forces a ladle of rhubarb out at Bruce
No,  really- no
Open up, that's it, here comes the news chopper
(makes sound of Chopper) No, Bobby
Bobby N01  said didn't want anything
(turns, heading off) Damn you
Bruce continues    off, as Bobby stops cold, adopts an odd expression, then    his      , , He turns instantly demonic
An overly     approaches Bobby from behind
Hi, Bobby
Is there any of that split pea soup left
She is instantly hit in the chest with a stream of green vomit
beat and Bobby offers out a plastic spoon

Jack, don't worry about that

The Prime Minister of Sweden visited Washington today as my little tiny nipples moved to France- Evan stops cold, staring at the teleprompter
- The Director in the booth reacts
What did he just say
Check the prompter
The Console Operator checks the text being fed to Evan
It's fine
Well, signal for him to keep going
65
-^   The Stage Manager motions to Evan, he reluctantly continues /    reading
The White House reception committee greeted the Prime Rib Roast Minister and  do the cha cha like a sissy girl
(urged to keep going, so continues slowly) lika do da cha cha
In desperation, Evan shifts from the prompter to the paper script on his desk
Sorry, we're having a few technical difficulties, here

sudden stream out of one          * nostril
Susan reacts
So does Jack
Bruce smiles
,   Evan sees the blood, tries to stop it but it only streams -/    faster
He keeps talking, but the stream increases
Susan gets up, tries to help
Somebody get some napkins
Dallas, help me
'm not touching hinu (realizing he's on camera) mean, 'm not really qualified
Evan's hair
His hair's on fire
Dallas runs off
(casual to an amazed news staffer) You know, he does have a certain pizazz about him
66
Susan reaches for a water pitcher, as a crew man steps in and Evan's head with a fire extinguisher
Evan is in shock, his face now white
The screen cuts to a " -" title card, then cuts to an episode of "Dragnet
" - It's fun to be God
/ - Bruce is bored off his ass, interviewing some at the Mark Twain chili cook off
(talks so slow you want to kill yourself) My secret is  let the jalapeno's marinade in a spicy sauce for over 24 hours before -- We see Bruce's pained face, realizing what horrible news this is, when he gets an idea and
11 to earth behind them
Hold that thought, Hazel
(Bruce walks back toward the explosion) It seems some type of meteor or asteroid has, by chance, hit the earth right behind the Mark Twain Chili Cook Off
- Bruce is free-falling in full sky diving uniform
So remember, it's sky diving season at Old Pete's airfield
(grabs the ripcord) This is Bruce Nolan
(gives it a tug, doesn't budge) My rip cord appears to be a bit stuck
Bruce yanks again harder, nothing, then again and the cord rips free from the suit
67
This is a very unfortunate turn of events
'm heading toward the earth at a very precarious speed
The cameraman pops his shoot and we see Bruce continue to stream toward the ground below
He falls into a wooded area
picks up the coverage, runs through the brush with other  to find Bruce laying on top of a ,
(
) He's okay
What's that
It's Bigfoot
Bigfoot broke his fall
Bruce stands groggy, points to a dazed Bigfoot
Ah ha
You are real
'  - Bruce sits watching a hockey game on
He follows the puck intently with his eyes, as though controlling it's path
,
: ,
: Grace sits aside him, working on the photo album
Do you believe how they're playing
(beat) Oh, honey, would you hand me the scissors
Bruce diverts his attention, when the Sabers screw up and the crowd
Bruce immediately turns, looks intently at the puck and ,
'  -  - - Grace's
Bruce is trying to help her fasten her bra, but it's a good three inches from touching
Bruce shrugs "got me
" 68
- Bruce is doing a report just outside the Pandas' enclosure
In the past, zoo officials have been unable to get these Panda's to mate, but that doesn't seem to be a problem today
wholeheartedly humping another
And the mood seems to be catching o
of the enclosure - ' are coupled off and humping everywhere
Mothers are frantically covering children's eyes, ushering them away from the exhibit
His stories are all over town

#3 to an asteroid crashing to earth
Bruce Nolan is rapidly becoming known as
- being put up with a big smiling Bruce with arms extended
It reads: "Mr
Exclusive"

* * eeeEEEEeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEeeeee
* '  -  - Bruce finishes running a bath, gets into the tub but  as is    and ends up sliding around like on a sheet of glass
He tries to break through, can't
Then, he concentrates and finally

He shoots his     * arms up, the crowd goes nuts
"Mr
Exclusive" flashes on the * screen

and that's the way the cookie crumbles
- Bruce surrounded by Hazel and other chili cook off contestants shouts up from the bottom of the crater hole: 70
& (in unison) And that's the way the cookie crumbles
-                                          * The words  on the jumbotron and the entire crowd chants:   * * And that's the way the cookie                         * crumbles
* / - Grace lies in full body wrap, while Debbie is in the process of being wrapped by , a rather ruff Spanish Salon attendant
So this is what success buys you
guess
(wiggling around) feel like a human taquito
Well, thank Mr
Exclusive for me
He's on a quite a roll
What'd he do make a deal with the devil
And he's taking me out tonight to dinner at Chez 'Amour
Well, la-ti-da
Mike's idea of a romantic evening is Chez Sizzler
Margarita pulls the wrap tightly around Debbie
(to Margarita) What does this do again
EstS para su grasa
Grasa
Doesn't that mean fat
71
Afraid so
Debbie eyes Margarita
(gushing) So, Bruce said and  quote: "Prepare yourself for an amazing evening that will change our lives forever
" Margarita reaches Debbie's waist and  tightly
Good - you wouldn't want to leave any spare oxygen in there
(back to Grace) Wait a second, you don't think he's going to propose, do you
don't think anything
You do
You think he's going to propose
Well, he's always said when he gets his career together, you know
And his career is more than together
mean, come on, Chez 'Amour
Change our lives
don't know, hun
mean,  like Bruce but that man's priority list is him, him, him, then him some more and then you
Well, he just might surprise you
That's what 'm worried about
(re: Margarita) Careful, you missed a spot of free flowing circulation
Margarita senses the attitude and pulls tighter
Debbie reacts
72
That'd do it
Margarita motions for Debbie to lay down and leaves
Debbie struggles to lay down
Let's see, how do -- Debbie slides to the ground, Grace cracks up, gets up to help, but also in mummy wrap, topples on top of her
They both laugh and struggling to get up
Hearing the ruckus, Margarita enters and gasps
Lesbianas1 Grace and Debbie crack up harder
Hey, 'll take that over fat
Margarita tries to pull them up, but falls too
No sexo, no sexol Grace and Debbie can't stop laughing
' - waiter pours the first trickle of wine into Bruce's glass
Bruce whiffs it, tastes it
Very good
If you run out just bring me some water, 'll take it from there
Grace looks over the menu as Bruce notices people at various tables eyeing him
He glances up to a ceiling light and with his mind, so it   in golden light
with dates  and wave
He waves back
Should we ask for a more private table
73, Huh
Oh, no this is fine right here
Bruce looks at Grace lovingly
He takes her hand
was going to wait until after the meal, but  think it's going to just bust out of me if  don't do it now
Grace beams, looks at Bruce with total love
You ready
(nervous) think so
got anchor
Grace's face falls
She does her best to cover
Evidently, they're having problems with Evan
He's finishing up the week and  go live Monday
That's great, honey
Congratulations
Wow
So that's what's tonight is about
Well, yeah
Grace,  got anchor
We got anchor
She's having a hard time covering her let down
(noticing her flat reaction) What's the matter
Well, to be honest,  thought that maybe tonight, you-- The    interrupt, approach Bruce
74
#1 'm sorry, but we had to come over
We just think you're amazing and
#2 Well, we can't believe it's you
They both laugh, Bruce enjoys the attention
(laughing along) Yep, it's me
#1 Can we get a picture with you
Well, sure
(glances to Grace) Just one second, hun
(leans to Grace) Fans
We better get used to this, huh
Grace sits watching the two girls take turns sitting on Bruce's lap, taking pictures
Sees Bruce relishing in the attention
One girl gives Bruce a peck on the cheek and they r"sS
w^w
s leave
Grace is clearly upset
You have lipstick on your face
Oh, thanks
Bruce, we need to talk
thought we had an understanding-- Suddenly, the  start again
Bruce looks around, figures it's coming from the restaurant patrons
Wow
It's kind of loud in here
Grace looks around the quiet romantic setting
What are you talking about
It's not loud
The
75
Geez
(shouts to the restaurant) -----   -   ~  DOWNl---  -- Bruce, this isn't funny
(talking loud
over the "racket") He gets up and darts off
'  - Bruce races through the restaurant kitchen holding his ears - -  - He  out the kitchen exit into the alley
Unclasps his ears, but no relief
The whispers are now loud voices
We start to make out fragments of words "Please," "Help me," etc
Overwhelmed and scared, he slides down the alley wall, covering his face, then   -- Bruce lowers his hands and finds himself (
) Really something isn't it
God sits down next to Bruce
Is this heaven
God laughs at this one
It's Everest
You should try flipping on the Discovery Channel every now and then
Well,  guess you can't now, being dead and all
'm dead God laughs
76
No, 'm just messing with you
Those voices
They're prayers, Bruce
You keep ignoring them and they're going to build up on
you like that
You didn't think being God was going to be all fun and games did you
Prayers
Those are prayers
Why can't  understand them
God forms a snowball in his hands as he talks
You aren't listening, son
Let's see, you've had my powers for over a week now and how many people have you helped
Okay, so maybe 've righted a couple of the wrongs in my own life
was going to get around to others
can do both
can help the world
The world
That wasn't the world, Bruce
That was just Buffalo, between Commonwealth and 57th
Didn't want to start you out with more than you can handle
Now how you doing otherwise
Personal life in good shape
Yeah
Everything is great
like a crack in space
Grace steps out, sees Bruce
Bruce
What are you doing out here
With that, the terrain  back into the alley where Grace has been standing all along
She can not see
God
77, Oh, ah, (to God) She can't
(God shakes his head, back to Grace) just, ah, needed a little fresh air
Bruce fakes a couple big breaths
Bruce, what is going on
The second  want to talk about us you run out on me
(to Bruce) Everything's great, huh
wasn't running out on you
You know,  actually had the crazy idea that you were going to ask me to marry you tonight
Now it's heating up
(to God) You are not helping
(back to Grace) me at all here, Grace
(sarcastic) Nice recovery
Bruce looks to God to shut up
Not helping you what
(to Grace) Look hun,  want to talk about this
This just isn't a good time
Okay
78
When is it a good time
It's never a good time
She's got a point
(to God) Stay out of this
Grace looks at him like he's nuts
Who are you talking to
Just then, the  start in again
Bruce reacts
Oh, not now
Bruce puts his hands to his ears
Grace takes this as him not wanting to listen to her
You're going to have to answer those things, y'know
Fin e

You want some friendly advice

God smiles

Bruce takes center stage, quiets the crowd
' d thank you all for coming, but the liquor is free so maybe you should
Everyone laughs
And now let me tell you a story
There was a man who had two sons
The younger son took his inheritance and squandered his money on a life of lust and debauchery
Everyone throws their hands up and continues to party
Bruce's big smile fades
He looks around the room, hoping to spot Grace
He grabs a phone, walks out to the balcony, di al s -- He gets their answering machine, hears their outgoing message together from happier times
He hangs up
(
) Hey there
Bruce turns, sees  , completely stunning in a sexy dress
Hi Br uce
What are you d oing out here all alone
Oh, ah,  was calling Grace
Yeah,  didn't see her in there love the new place, by the way
So how are you and Grace doing
don't know, we had a fight earlier
Ever since
Well, things are different now and
94
You're on fire Bruce
Some women can't handle fire
Some can
Susan smooths close to Bruce
You know,  always had an instinct about you
knew you were going to make something of yourself
Really
There's something special about you Bruce
like special
Look Susan,  don't know, -- Susan grabs Bruce, kisses him passionately
Bruce doesn't join in, but doesn't fight it either
- Grace and Debbie enter
So this is your new place, huh
Cozy, don't you think
Come on help me find him
They head into the room
You sure you want to do this
don't know
It's his big night
* don't want to spoil it
know
* how much this means to him
* * So much for lashing back
Grace stops dead in her tracks
Her face drops
'  - , still lip-locked with Susan Ortega
95
Oh, boy
Bruce turns and sees Grace
Grace,
(fighting back tears) Get the car, Deb
Right
Grace, wait
Grace follows Debbie out
- Bruce follows Grace outside
Grace, come on
Grace stops, opens her purse, tosses the keys to her new car in Bruce's chest
Here
do n't w ant your car don't want your things
don't want you
Come on, don't say that
was just calling y ou-- And you thought Susan's mouth was the phone
didn't think you were coming-- mean,
screwed up, okay
Let me make it up to you
How about a boat, Bruce
If that's what you want
96
Yeah, a big boat and oh, maybe two bags of cash, you know, the ones with the big cartoon dollar signs on the front
Then 'll be happy
Because 'm just hollow inside
Debbie's been right
All this time
defended you, told her there was good in you
Another side to you
Well,  just saw that other side and  don't want anything to do with it
Debbie pulls up, Grace storms off to the car
Bruce follows, Grace, come on, don't do this
Go back to your little co-anchor
Or is that ho-anchor
(tearing) came back here to apologize
How stupid am
Grace turns and heads to the car
You're the one that didn't like the new place
Grace gets in, slams the door
You can't walk out on me
'm the alpha, lady
'm the Omega
Debbie peels out
(desperate last attempt) could make you stay
Bruce is left alone in the middle of the street
Fine
don't need you
have everything  need
Did you hear that
(yelling) have
97
- Bruce walks in, Susan is waiting for him
was right
She couldn't handle the fire
Bruce looks at Susan with disgust, then glances to a on the wall, mentally
The sprinklers turn on, as well
People scream, rush toward the exit
Bruce sits down on the sofa, being rained on by the sprinklers, alone
He finally plops back and God is sitting next to him
Enjoying your party
Yeah, nothing like spending time with some real frien ds
Any s hrimp left
Grace left me
know
(certain) She'll take me back
(uncertain) Will she take me back
Would you take you back
Bruce mulls this over,- then
How do you make someone love you when you can't effect free will
Welcome to my world, son
You come up with an answer to that one, you let me know
Off of Bruce thinking
: 98
'  - Grace's alarm goes off
The radio comes on and it plays a John Cougar Mellencamp song
But the lyrics are different
Here's a little ditty, about Grace and her man Bruce, two Americans growing up, needing to make a truce
Grace's eyes pop open
Is she dreaming
' Bruce hides behind a hedge, watches Grace jog past
notices something        it reads: " + "
Carved in     the next tree, "    "
Carved in the next    tree, "  , "
She does     a double take, continues on
Grace reaches in her purse to pay for her coffee and a bunch of
They are all of Bruce and Grace
She thinks, definitely didn't -put them there
'   - Grace is helping one of the kids, when she notices something outside the window
It's a cloud formation that strangely looks like  (in profile)
She reacts as the imagery melts away into a very faint " " - Grace is talking with one of the other teachers
The kids, playing dodgeball in the background, laugh and scream louder and louder
Grace turns and sees
Bruce getting pelted by multiple balls
Okay, surrender, surrender
He walks over to Grace
Hi
99
Hi
, ah, have my first anchor tonight
That's great
hope it goes well for you
He's hit in the head by a ball
Grace can't help but smiles Bruce leaps at the opportunity
miss you
(off her silence) just took the first step, shot myself out on the ledge, awaiting vulnerably your response
don't know what to say
How about you love me and you'll take me back
No, Bruce
Come on, what about all the signs
What
How do you know about that
Did you talk to Debbie
(beat) Would it help if  told you  acted like an ass
Martin is standing nearby
Hey, you said ass
It's okay as long as you mean a donkey
didn't add "hole
" It's only bad when you say "ass-ho-- 100
Alright, inside, Martin
(to the others) Okay everyone, inside
The kids race in
Grace starts to follow
Grace, please
None of this seems                    * right without you
* (off her reaction)                               * Is that a glimmer of hope  see
* have to go
* She starts off
Wait
Bruce      , like putting a love spell on her
Now how do you feel
She looks at him, oddly
Are you out of your mind
Have you been drinking
Drin kin g
Sur e
'm dru nk wit h Bruce
ME1
(a beat) You need help
She heads back inside
Bruce throws his hands in the air, frustrated
'   - Bruce heads for his car as he sees a two guys in (from the prison yard) drive off with it
101
Hey11   That's my car
'  - The  drive off laughing
#1 Ha, nice wheels, huh
sits up in the back seat
Thou shalt not steal
The prisoners
Car, show them the way out
Instantly, the car doors fly open and the seats tilt sideways dumping the prisoners
What is wrong with the world
- #1 The Dow skyrocketed again today and with a new influx of paper millionaires, analysts are warning of a potential run on banks
We see a stock graph superimposed on the screen with a ludicrous jump straight up off the charts
: #2 The scene nearly turned violent when hundreds of disgruntled Buffalo residents protested the results of lasts weeks fluke lottery results
: 102
#3 another 37 arrests today at the Beasley Construction Site for indecent exposure
We see women getting pulled away one by one into police vans, after they flash their tops
In the background, a "Girl's Gone Wild" van is there rolling tape of each flashing
The world's gone mad
Jack clicks off the monitor
Bruce hustles in from make-up
An air of forced confidence about him
Nothing and no one is going to ruin his big moment
Oh, there you are
Your big debut
How you feeling
You know what
'm good
The show must go on
Bruce sits in the anchor desk, breathes in the reality
(whispers) Bruce, if  had any idea Grace was going to be there last night
Susan, you didn't do anything                          * wrong
In fact,  found the                            * moment rather pleasurable
* Susan shudders, tries to compose himself
(flustered) Oh, really
that's nice
Okay, the Sabers just won the Stanley Cup
It's getting pretty crazy out there
We're going to kick live to Fred at the stadium
Oh, and Bruce, you won the pool again
Exact score, dead on
Twenty-three to one, who would have thought
103
bXA This is it, you good
Bruce nods, straightens in his chair, prepares for his dream The Eyewitness News opening plays, then fades away to Bruce and Susan
'm Susan Ortega
'm Bruce Nolan and here's what's m ak i n g n e ws -- And the screen goes to
Lights dim in the studio
What happened
What the hell happened
The Stage Manager listens to his wire
We lost the signal
It's another power surge
Aw, geez
Ever since that damn asteroid hit
The power comes back up
We're back
We apologize for the interruption, and now back to the news
Bruce
Thank you, Susan-- Susan gets a feed in her earpiece
104
'm sorry, we're going live to Rupp arena where the Buffalo Sabers have won the Stanley cup
Fred
Bruce is noticeably bothered
: Fred is with the coach
The team is celebrating, champagne rains down
Thank's Susan
'm here with coach Tucker who has lead the Sabers to their first championship in 22 years
' mounting frustration
He gives a look
Tell me coach
Fred's face registers
He tries to keep it together
beat of silence
' (quickly) have to use the restroom
He drops the mic and runs out
Off the coach's puzzled look
What the hell
Bruce covers
We'll get back to the Saber victory in just a moment
In other news-- Again,
Jack tosses his headset
Oh, for the love of Godl What is it now
The Stage Manager again listens to his wire
105
The whole booth is down
flies through a front window
Bruce turns to see
- in progress
College students, city dwellers going crazy
Cars are burning, people are out of control
Escaped convicts are running in and out of stores looting right alongside ordinary citizens
The Kowolski brothers and Momma Kowolski are helpless against the onslaught as pillagers run out of the bakery carrying cakes, pies, bread - whatever they can get their hands on
Bruce stumbles through the mayhem, confused
What's going on
Partying, man
Wooooll
Sabers
They continue to trash the area
But your team wonl Cars are being rolled over
lone   protects himself with his shield as he's pelted with various debris
The Officer   down behind a car
Stay down
Where are the other officers
What other    officers
Half the force just    retired
Said their "ship came    in
" You better get home pal
t's dangerous out here
The Officer heads out
Bruce stands, then quickly , as a bottle is tossed through a window that has a lotto sticker on it
106
The lottery sucks
only won 17 bucks i Bruce looks up at a burning building with a flaming "Mr
Exclusive" billboard above - it comes
Bruce looks out over the rioters
We see the anger build in his face, like Moses looking down on the Israelites
He Hear, ' Buffalo, you have awakened my wrath
Vengeance is mine
shoots right into the middle of the rioters, scattering them
People flee in every direction as and lightning bolts continue to strike
Bruce stands alone in the street, surveys the smoldering mayhem, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out the key God gave him
He grips it tightly and
-                                        * Bruce stands there, sees God as he originally found him, mopping
God looks up at Bruce, not surprised to see him
They're all out of control don't know what to do
You mind giving me a hand with this floor first
Off Bruce's look
: Bruce's sleeves rolled up, mopping next to God
* "Poor man wanna be rich, rich man                     * wanna be king, king's disatisfied                     * 'cause he rules everything

like a little Boss                     * in my head while 'm workin'
* They finish up
God looks back at the sparkling floor, satisfied
There we go
Wonderful thing
No matter how filthy something gets, it can always be cleaned right up
God collects Bruce's mop
What happened
gave everyone what they wanted
God sets the mops down
Since when does anyone have a clue about what they want
God holds up a   , changing the room into the where Bruce first parted his soup
(: Whenever the room "changes" we're actually still in the room, but seeing a full projection of an environment on the walls and columns) The older waitress, Ginnie, clears some dishes
Remember Ginnie
Ginnie bends down behind the counter and when she comes back up she is a hot 21
Ginnie thought she lost her beauty when she got older
'm trying to convince her otherwise
Ginnie bends down again, and when she comes back up, she is again
God clicks the remote, changing the environment into a We see the grade school where Filbert Davis, the boy Bruce helped up the rope, is in a fight
Ah yes, Filbert
Brilliant young man
He was going to be a great poet
() 108
(cont'd) The soul of his work would have been built out of his hardships
He would have touched millions
(feigns cheery) But now he's headed for a career as a professional wrestler
God clicks, changing the environment into a
We see a lonely woman (who found the cash in her purse) sitting depressed, rocking in a chair
Ester Maha
love Ester
Ester was bankrupt
She was going to have to eat her pride and call her sister
Would've got the two of them together again
Instead, she bought a condo in Florida
God clicks the remote again

* * You want some advice
* * Yes
* God smiles, starts to walk away
* * Everybody wants a miracle, Bruce
* Want me to do everything for 'em
But what they don't understand is, they're the one's holding the power
God claps the bright ceiling light on, walks over to the latter
Wait
Where are you going
This is good-bye, Bruce
You've learned a lot
think you should be able to handle things now
God climbs, ascending into the light
What if  have a question
What if need you
God stops, looks down to Bruce
110
See Bruce, that's your problem
That's everybody's problem
You keep looking up
He smiles and disappears into the light, leaves Bruce thinking
'  - Bruce stands in the apartment, Sam at his side
No signs of Grace
The bed is made
Empty
Then, he notices the   , the incomplete albums
He picks up a photo of he and Grace in an even tinier apartment, Sam is a puppy, they have little money, and despite it all look very happy
Bruce smiles at the memory
Reaches for a stack of photos
- Bruce sits in bumper to bumper traffic
man's car is broken down in the middle of the street causing the bottleneck
Bruce sees    by the side of the road
His sign reads:
Bruce looks out at the other drivers honking and shouting at the frustrated man
- the stalled car is now rolling to the shoulder and we  that Bruce is doing the pushing
' The auto-function is answering "" to the prayer emails
Bruce clicks cancel, turns off the computer
Filbert Davis is beating up another kid
Bruce watches at a
distance
Bruce giveth and Bruce taketh away
Suddenly, Filbert goes to throw a punch but his punch has no sting
The bigger boy looks down and grins

Come on, Sam
Let's do this the right way
Oh, alright
Bruce pulls out a   , lays it on the grass
Sam happily goes
They walk off together
That's not normal you know
- Bobby places three blue home address number tiles on the counter - all number 6
(demonic voice) Do you have these in red
Bruce walks up behind Bobby
Okay Bobby, it's time to come back
Bobby  at Bruce, turns
It (casual) Un-damn you, Bobby
Bobby instantly transforms to normal
112
Hey thanks, Bruce
(holds out a cookie) Biscotti
- Evan is packing his things at his desk, still looking much worse for the wear
Bruce walks up to him
You're probably here to gloat over the anchor position
Go ahead, 'm sure  deserve it
You know, Evan
've been a real prick
Evan stops, looks up at Bruce, confused
You were born to anchor
'm not taking the position
Oh, and never really congratulated you on getting the job in the first place
Congratulations, Evan
Bruce offers his hand, Evan takes it
When their hands meet, there is a kind of   that passes between them
Bruce walks off, Evan is confused when he catches his reflection in the mirror
'
'  - Evan is manning the anchor desk and looking good doing it
Jack is relieved
In the financial world, things are settling back to normal in what analysts are calling a fluke market fluctuation
Bruce enters
You made the right choice, Jack
113
So what about you
What will you do
With your permission,  think 'll go out there and make the people laugh
To quote a friend, "God knows we could use it
" Jack smiles
Permission granted
Bruce turns to go, then turns back
Oh, are you hungry
know a place that makes a mean tomato soup
- Bruce walks along side Jack
Jack talks and talks, happy to have the company
Bruce opens a door for Jack, leading to
Bruce and Jack take a seat at the counter
(
) Coffee, gentlemen
Jack and the waitress lock eyes - there's an instant attraction
Bruce smiles

'  - Bruce paces, waiting for Sam
You can do it, Sam
Without the carpet
Come on
Sam does
Bruce celebrates, does a happy dance and is surprised to see Debbie standing there
(re: the peeing dog) Looks like your rain dance worked
Debbie
Hey
You know,  never got to apologize for-- didn't really come to chat, came for Grace's things
' Debbie is packing items into a box
She sees the photo albums on the coffee table
She flips through, surprised
They're full
You did all this
Bruce nods
Debbie looks at Bruce, sizing him up
You really hurt her, you know
know
Debbie starts to go, but turns back
You know what  do before  go to sleep every night
tuck my kids in bed,  eat a scoop of ice cream and watch Conan
() 115
(cont'd) You know what Grace does
She prays
Most of the time for you
This not only touches Bruce, but it gives him an idea
'   - Bruce sits anxiously at the computer with Sam, checks the e-- mails and types in
He hits "search"
1,273 entries appear
The woman does pray a lot
He types in "Grace and Bruce" and eagerly awaits
There are 335 matches
He checks a few
"Dear God, please help Bruce to find himself, find contentment, find You
" "Dear God, please help Bruce
He's struggling to find meaning
" "Dear God, help Bruce to be happy
He can't seem to find his way
" Over and over, he finds the same prayer, the same entry every morning and night for months on end
Bruce is touched
She still loves me, Buddy
He   and races out
- Bruce stands in front of the house with flowers, another special creation
He looks at the lavish bouquet, then sets them down, picks a single, normal Daisy from the garden
Better
He heads for the door when he hears crying
It's Grace
He looks up, sees a light on in the upstairs guest room
He climbs the fire escape and looks in the window
is sitting on the bed crying
As Bruce watches her cry, feeling her emotion, it starts to
Please God
Please
11 6
Through her tears she is praying
Bruce looks at her with total love
Please God
still love him
Bruce smiles, thankful
but  don't want to love him anymore
Please God
Help me to forget
(cries) don't want to hurt anymore want to forget
Bruce just stands there, stunned
He gets it
He raises a hand, and with a simple wave, he performs an excruciatingly selfless act
He lets Grace go
Her face changes
She wipes her eyes
The pain is lifted
And it is Bruce now who feels that pain
He looks at Grace
sad smile
- Rain droplets splash on the river where Bruce first raged at God
He stands in the middle of the street, looks up heavenward, weakly
Humble
You win
' m done
Please don't want to do this anymore don't want to be God
(sighs) Please, help me
And with that, the rain stops
The dark clouds slowly open as beams of light cut through, shining down upon Bruce, birds begin to chirp
adding to this magical moment as
HONK1 ,
His spirit remains in the same spot, looking confused, then heavenward
117
like a missile,   , to
- No walls, just white as far as the eye can see
The flooring is the whitest of white puffy clouds
Bruce finds himself standing there
He looks around and when he turns behind him, he sees
Floating on nothing, as though sitting in the most royal throne
Am
You can't expect to kneel down in the middle of a highway and live to talk about it
But why
Why now
work in mysterious ways, son
beat as Bruce takes everything in
You knew it all along
You knew if got everything  wanted,  would ruin my life
God doesn't respond, just listens
So 'm dead
Okay
If this is what you want
Okay, okay
God holds up the  , tosses them to Bruce
Bruce looks at the beads, then up at God, puzzled
Go ahead, use 'em
Alright
've learned that don't know as much  thought did
Boy, you can say that again
Hey, 'm praying here
118
Sorry, go
If  could have just one thing in the world
It would be for Grace to live a happy, joyful life
And that she finds someone
(getting emotional as he realizes what he's saying) that she finds someone that will treat her with the love and respect that she so deserves
God smiles the most satisfied of smiles
Now that is a prayer
(beat) Well,  better get on that one
See ya, Bruce
Off Bruce's puzzled reaction he     -- -    , back , and right     where
and he
The still clutched tightly in his hand
stop giving Bruce , see that his vitals have returned
He's back
40 over 110 and rising
#1 (to Bruce) - Bruce
Can you hear me
(Bruce nods) We almost lost you there
- The   is a   - Bruce is heavily bruised and bandaged
#1 You lost a lot of blood
It wasn't easy to find a match - you're a very rare blood type
119
Bruce looks to the blood bag, sees "/ Positive" written on the side
- , (groggy whisper) / Positive
#2 (
) You should thank God for donors
We don't have a lot of that type on hand
There's your angel now
Bruce turns toward the hospital door and sees
cotton swab taped to her arm
Now he remembers where he heard of that blood type
(re: her swab) hear that all of this winds up in a warehouse somewhere
But you know me, 'm a sucker for this stuff
The doctors give Grace the nod to enter as they go, leaving the two of them alone
Grace tentatively approaches
don't even know what 'm doing here
But
When  heard that you'd been in an accident and that you might not make it
She starts to cry
Hey, 'm okay
Does it hurt
Only when  talk
, and smile
and y'know, exist in general
120
Grace laughs
That's one thing Bruce could always do, is make her laugh
Grace spots the prayer beads in Bruce's hand, raises his arm
Oh my gosh, you still have those
Bruce looks at the prayer beads, then looks at Grace
He remembers his prayer to God and the emotion wells within him What is it
Nothing
It's just really nice to see you
She goes to him, Bruce sits up a bit and they embrace
: - in progre   ss
Everyone is there, Grace, Sam, Debbie and Zoe, Ginnie   and Jack, the Kowolski brothers, Momma Kowolski, Evan, Susan   , Dallas, Fred
Bobby serves various food items from his   cart
You know, French Toast was invented by tavern owner, Joseph French, who had a poor knowledge of grammar, and did not know how to use the possessive apostrophe, so he called it French Toast instead of French's Toast

He's now talking in his , much more himself
This is Bruce Nolan at Buffalo's first annual "Be the Miracle" blood drive
Remember, the life you save may be mine, so hurry down
had a close call and, well, can you imagine what life would have been like without me
Laughs in the background, from the people that know Bruce
Bruce walks over to the Kowolski Brothers
121
In honor of this event, the Kowolski brothers have baked a one- of-a-kind, creation
The brothers proudly unveil the special cookie and we see that it's a
Sure, a little creepy and a shameless plug, but we love 'em
(Bruce breaks off a little piece, takes a bite) Mmm, good needle
Remember, that's Kowolski's bakery
The bakery that gets more air time than a high speed chase
Everyone laughs
The Kowolski brothers beam
Bruce takes a seat as a   pulls up his sleeve, revealing the prayer beads worn around his wrist
She ties off his arm, starts to probe for a vein
To be honest, 've never been a big fan of shots
The volunteer now is swabbing Bruce's arm and Bruce is starting to sweat
(nervous) Okay, we're good to go
They just stick it into my arm
Breaking through the skin, of course
The volunteer pulls out the needle and Bruce
Gasps, the Nurse leans close, total silence, then: Bruce jolts awake making the Nurse and several people jump
They all laugh
Had you going, didn't IIIIII1 He reacts to the nurse  the needle in
Everyone laughs more
122
No, this is nothing
In fact, this is the second time 've given blood this week
For those of you who haven't heard,  ' d like you to meet the soon to be Mrs
Exclusive
He throws a look to Grace who smiles in return
The crowd applauds
This is Bruce Nolan reporting for Eyewitness News
The camera cuts
