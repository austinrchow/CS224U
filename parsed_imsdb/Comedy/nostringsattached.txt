Written by Elizabeth Meriwether - and   Naked in bed but covered
in sheets
Lying next to each other, but not touching
Emma stall has her shoes on
don't know
What about "Comrades-in-Fuck"
No
What if we say we're in the Axis of Fuck
we formed a Fuck Alliance
We're neighbors 'on
Fuck Street
What's wrong with "buddies'
Who says "buddies"
Yeah, you're right
-- - 1994
summer camp in- Northern Michigan
It's a dance
An over-enthusiastic counselor with a massive boombox stereo
Coolio's "Fantastic Voyage" blasts
About ten thirteen-year-old boys are lined up along the side
'Hair down to their ears and parted in the middle-- little versions of Kurt Cobain or Jord Catalano
They are staring at a group of dancing girls - In the middle is , the blonde who grew boobs before anyone else
And every time she moves; she bounces
The boys watch her, serious, concentrating
They need to remember this for later
Katie continues to bounce- One boy suddenly looks down, scared
It tickles
- Yeah
It does other stuff
But there's a boy on the, edge of the group :  sweet
face, 'and you wouldn't be surprised to- find but he's Jewish:  12 year - old, Adam Kurtzman
He's the only boy not looking at Katie
Instead, he's staring off in another direction
On the other side of the dance floor, next to an 'enormously ' fat kid, there's Emma
She's an awkward 12
Wearing borrowed clothes- a skirt that's a little too long, a top that she can't fill out
She's taller than any of the boys
But there's something in her eyes, like she's laughing at everything
She makes eye,contact with Adam: She squints
, He takes -a deep breath,
She squints some more
He walks over
-'
Hey
- Hey
'long' pause'
-They're not looking at each other
Then Do you want to, freak
'-- 's "No Scrubs
" Emma and Adam are freaking awkwardly - Emma is too tall and Adam is holding on too tight and just bouncing up and down
- You freak, good
Okay
- (singing along with the ) "No,  don't want no scrubs"-- 3
don't get it
' Urn
She doesn't want a -scrub; Because he's hanging out of his
best friend's ride, trying to -holler at her
Katie, in another part of the dance floor, is in the middle of a big freak-sandwich
Emma scowls at her, looks at Adam
Let's go to the dumpster- () We're not even going out
() But  feel like 've known you
my whole life
-  - Emma and Adam awkwardly stand against-the wall near the dumpster
There are couples on either side
of them making out
So
've enjoyed camp
There's all kinds of fun activities
For example,  learned how to-archer
That's good
That'll be useful if you ever make a time machine and go back'to the medieval ages:-and then your-time machine breaks, and you get attacked by knights
You're funny
It's weird
4
'+fAi121A My life's pretty
fucked ug'
My parents are gettinga divorce
' That's why  had-to go--to carp
The couple making out next to them rolls over
really close
Emma pushes them back over
Marriage sucks my ' butt
Yeah
it sucks it
It sucks it
all 'ni-ight
+ People aren't meant to be together forever
' just want to find a girl Who's really nice
And she likes to eat hummus
Suddenly, another   comes up
' Are
you guys gonna make out
We just got here
- Well people are waiting
a line of awkwardly coupled Campers waiting = to get to the make-out Spot
boy walks by them from some ather'-spot, smelling his  finger
Do you want to- Adam leans in and kisses her
with tongue
' They're both pretty
bad
like frenching with you
Okay
5
Adam starts crying, trying to hide it
'(')
Are you crying
Pretty much
' Why are-you crying
Because- because camp'-s almost over- Jesus
Exwaa pats him a'couple times on the shoulder
(') Look
'm not really an affectionate person
Emu a, very uncomfortable, puts her-arm around him
He lets her
They
don't look at
each other
Can  finger you

Adam does a little- imitation of what that looks
like
Emma smiles, -kind of embarrassed
She looks over and sees Alv n and Vanessa there too, laughing
-She's surprised'
; 113
(') And it suddenly became clear why none of my girlfriends ever wanted to have sex with me
thought it was just because my dick was too big and it scared them-But apparently-that's not the problem
At all
Actually, 've heard it's like acupuncture- you're- on your back the whole time and you don't even feel it go in
That's what my ex-girlfriend told me before she started dating my father
Vanessa and Alvin laugh, Vanessa covers her head with-her hand
(') Actually they're getting married
So Mother's Day just keeps getting better and better

care
--- want that time back

Let's try
( ) don't think  can do'it again
Yeah
Okay
But we should still, you know, see - Come on

', How'd
you get so screwed up
( ) Oh yeah
- did it
'm just like you- 'm going to fuck it all up
Like you
-Like you gave up on Mom
(a beat) ' When ' we -first , had you, we hadn't slept in days, we were just shoving' food in our mouths over the sink whenever we could
And finally, got it together enough to get
some take-out from one of the -restaurants we used to like
() 117
(') And  set it all out on,the table, and the second we sat down,  think it was the first bite  took, you started crying
And your Horn and looked at each-other-and just -- uncontrollably laughing
, We're on the floor, we can't breathe
that kind of laughing
( ) 'm pretty sure that was the best of moment of my life'
If, you rre not Counting anything with a blowjob
So why'd-you start dicking around
'
Why'd you leave her
don't know
-think the
simplest answer is: 'm a jerk
And--the
other answer is: Because - at -some point, we forgot how to make each other laugh
And if that-sounds like a bullshit answer, you're probably right
But if it 'sounds really deep, then - that-'s, good too
( ) Alto
-just - the first time cheated
oft
' your mom,
was on a lot of blow
So
if you're married and you
do blow, try to avoid-being -around women who wantto_fuck
you
Even fat women
