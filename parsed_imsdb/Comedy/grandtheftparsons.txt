' phone rings in the dark
little light falls from the open window, illuminating an old bakelite telephone
It sits on a small table alongside a large amount of empty bottles and a couple of overflowing ashtrays
' three wheeled motorcycle is being driven through the night at great speed
The trike is moving very quickly, its headlights cutting through the darkness, its wheels sending a spray of sand flying towards us, as the driver fights to keep it on the road
This is  , and he's in a hurry
-  8 Two figures are struggling on the floor
The male is naked
The woman sits astride him, her movements urgent, her breath fast
They appear to be having sex
The Trike cuts through the night, and we pull back to show desert, more desert, and then
a giant bright, flickering neon sign: 'Welcome to the Joshua Tree Inn'
' That phone - still ringing; shrill, insistent
There is a bed next to the table
It is covered in clothes, but there is also a man's shape, which now moves
-  8 little more light, and it now appears as if our man and woman are struggling
There is fear on her face
' Still that insistent ringing, and the covers suddenly fly off the bed
We see the man from behind as he shakes the sleep away and looks for the damn phone
2
-  8 The woman is screaming now, and banging on the man's chest with her fists
He is motionless underneath her
The Trike skids to a halt amid a cloud of dust and the driver leaps off
He runs at the door, throwing it open in one movement, disappearing into the room
broken striped 'No Entry - Police' band flutters to the ground
' The man finally answers the phone
At last the ringing stops
Hello
-  8 The door bounces back open, and we can see the Phil walking quickly through the room
As he searches, we hear: ' Oh my God please help me found your number in his pocket and  don't know
don't know what to do
' Ah, what
who are you
' He's dead
he's dead
and 'm
just
don't know what to do
The man glances into the bathroom and opens some drawers
' Hold on
Tell me who's dead
' Parsons
Gram Parsons
We met in a bar and we had a lot to drink and he just
' Are you sure he's dead
He looks under the beds
3
: ' Yeah
He's really dead
He just
' Listen
Call an ambulance
Where are you
' Joshua Tree
Joshua Tree Inn
Room eight
He checks on top of the wardrobe
' Have you got a car
' Yes
' Call an ambulance
Then get out of there
Okay
Okay
' Yeah, okay
'm goin'
He picks up a sheet of paper from the bedside table and glances at it
He turns and walks past us to the car and for the first time we see Phil Kaufman's face
The Trike skids to a halt outside the small white hospital
There are a couple of press vehicles parked outside, and a reporter is recording a piece to camera in the background
Phil sits for a moment, and then opens the door and walks to the entrance
- We move through the reception area up to the nurses' station
Phil is in conversation with a large woman in a nurse's uniform
You wanna run that by me again, sir
Okay
'd like to see Gram Parsons
They stare at each other
4
: You want to see Gram Parsons
Yes
Alone, if possible
And would you have a gurney standing by in case  need to move him
She looks carefully at the pyjamas which peek out from under the shabby overcoat
His hair is on end
He is wearing biker boots and is holding an unlit but half-smoked cigar
And you are
his physician
Or perhaps a close relative
Phil clears his throat
Actually, 'm his road manager
The big nurse smiles mirthlessly
So you're not his physician or a close relative
beat
No
Mister Parsons is awaiting a post mortem
He will then be delivered to his family suggest you speak to them if you wish to pick through his personal effects
Sir
She turns away
Now listen here
No, you listen here
Mister Parsons is dead and no longer appears to need a road manager
Which makes two of us
The nurse turns and marches down the corridor
Phil waits until she's gone and then walks through a door marked 'Admittance only to Authorized Hospital Staff'
5
Phil slips off his overcoat and stuffs it into the trash
He tosses away the unlit cigar, grabs a white coat from a hook and puts it on
He walks out through another door
Phil wanders down the corridor, glancing into rooms and checking signs
He pushes open a door marked 'Pathology'
The room is empty, except for a couple of covered bodies on trolleys
Phil checks under the first sheet, and recoils at whatever it is which lies beneath
Sheesh
He walks over to the next gurney and lifts the sheet
He stares down at the body, visibly moved
(') Hello buddy
How you been
He stands for a moment, gripping the gurney and looking down at his friend
Then he snaps out of it
(') Well,  can't stand around here chatting with you all day
Things to do
He wheels the gurney towards the door
Phil wheels the gurney down the corridor towards the exit
doctor in green scrubs approaches and glances down at a clipboard
Can  help you
Naw, 'm cool thanks
The doctor reads the tag on the body's toe
What are you doing
Just taking some stiff down to neurology
6
: We don't have a neurology department
Urology
The doctor grabs the end of the gurney
Phil tugs and the doctor tugs back
After a moment, Phil sighs and shakes his head in frustration
(') Okay
Just hold your horses - 'll go check the paperwork
The doctor holds up his clipboard
have the paperwork
No
You have your paperwork need to go check my paperwork
He slips through the exit
The doctor waits awkwardly     for a few seconds, and then pushes open the door
Hello
Hello
He glances around in surprise, but there is no-one in sight
Phil's trike accelerates as it approaches a  junction
To the right the sign points to 'Joshua Tree Town', to the left 'Los Angeles'
The trike doesn't even slow as it skids left, sending a spray of sand and gravel flying across the road
There will be several shots of Phil driving through the desert, set to music
' The Trike pulls up outside a rambling old house
Two enormous plaster eagles flank the front door, a giant Harley Davidson sign hangs from the roof, and there's a six foot flashing neon star in the front window
Phil gets out, walks up to the door and pulls some keys out of his pocket
7
' Phil walks into the room and pours himself a drink
He slumps onto the couch, takes a sip and closes his eyes
We see movement behind him, as an attractive girl slips through a door and approaches Phil from behind
This is , and she puts her hands over his eyes
Guess who
Martin Luther King
Try again
Susie leans over the back of the chair and gives Phil a long slow kiss
She jumps over the couch and resumes kissing, this time more passionately
Phil tries to pull away with little success
This
isn't
the best time
Baby
Susie continues regardless, Phil is now finding it hard to resist
He eventually gives in, and they begin to kiss passionately
' Phil and Susie are sitting at the kitchen table
He takes a drag from her cigarette and passes it back
God damn
'm so sorry, baby
Yeah, out of a job again
Would never have happened if you were there
How do you know  wasn't
Well, if you were, you wouldn't have let him die
was still 'on staff'
He was still my responsibility
8
: They sit quietly for a moment
Then: (') So where have you been, anyway
She sighs, and stands up
(') How long this time
Two weeks
Yeah, let's have this conversation again
Like you haven't just done six weeks on the road
Yeah, but  usually leave a note
And there's a paycheck involved
Susie disappears through the door
Phil's shoulders sag and he slumps against the wall
Then Susie reappears with a bottle of Jack Daniels and a couple of glasses
She pours out two generous measures and hands one to Phil
Come here
After a moment, he gets up and follows her out of the room
' Susie guides Phil to a chair and sits him down
What's this
This is a remembrance
She crosses to a record player and turns it on, pausing to let down the blind on the way back
'In My Hour of Darkness'(or similar music) fills the room
: )
)          : (Earnestly) He was so beautiful, and he understood what my heart was feeling
'll
( ) 9
: (') never laugh again
My inner joy has gone
It evaporated when Gram departed
)  '' He sang country music in a way that it had never been sung before
It was 'country rock', if you like
And it was kinda catchy
At least, the young people seemed to lap it up
It's fair to say that when Gram Parsons died, he died a star
)
)        : It's like
can't
It was real, kinda
Oh, man
)  ,
)        : And another light burns out in the desert
Gram Parsons - the standard bearer of the new country music movement - is dead, following an overdose of drugs
While many of America's young people are today in mourning, their parents will view this as another example of how today's drug culture can so easily claim a life
We'll leave you tonight with the young man's own words
Gram Parsons wrote a song called 'In My Hour of Darkness', which contains these words: 'In my hour of darkness
' We are back in Phil's sitting room
Fade up on the music, to match the reporter's words, as Gram's voice fills the room: (or similar music)
' In my hour of darkness, in my time of need, Oh Lord grant me vision, Oh Lord grant me speed
Oh Lord grant me vision, Oh Lord grant me speed
10
: Susie tenderly throws a blanket over the sleeping Phil as the record ends
She turns the light off and the room goes dark
' Susie walks in with a coffee
She sits beside Phil and strokes his head until he wakes
She kisses him and passes him the cup
Hello
Hi
He sits up and stretches
She leans over to kiss him, then stands and starts to tidy
He watches her
She picks up some clothing from near his chair and moves away
He drops another piece of clothing on the same spot
She says nothing and picks it up
He takes a sock off and drops it
It has stopped being a game and started being a statement
She picks the sock up and drops it in his lap
He pushes it back onto the floor
She opens her arms and everything falls to the floor
She walks out of the room and into the kitchen
He follows
' Susie leans on the table, staring out of the window
Phil walks up behind her
When you're here,  spend my time wondering when you're going
And when you're back,  wonder where you've been
She turns and walks round to face him
Phil, you give me laughs and a great time
But 'm not sure if that's enough
You mean there's more than that
Yes, there's more than that
There's dependable, responsible, reliable
11
: There's dull, boring, normal
You should hook up with someone who works in a bank
know a guy, actually
He has fish for dinner every Friday, cleans his shoes twice a week and buys his ties in bulk because it works out cheaper that way
'll put you in touch
don't mind loving a crazy bastard, Phil
But you've got to be for something and not just against everything
You have to choose something to represent
represent the combined forces of charm, enchantment and exuberance
Your job is to arrange other people's lives
Maybe it's time to put a little thought into your own
Susie walks out of the room
suburban street of small, neat bungalows
We move down the street, past house and identical house, until we rest outside another that is identical to the rest
The front door opens, and a nondescript man emerges, carrying a small overnight bag
He carefully locks the door and walks down the path to where a cab waits
We can clearly see 'New Orleans Taxi' marked on the door
Airport, please
This is  , Gram's father
' There is a loud banging on the front door
Phil glances out of the window, and looks momentarily puzzled
He opens the door, and a beautiful woman stands on the step
Long time, no see, Barbara
12
: Don't try and schmooze me, Kaufman, you repellent slimeball
She notices Susie standing behind Phil
(') The latest victim
Barbara walks past them into the kitchen
Susie looks quizzically at Phil
Meet Barbara
Barbara calls out from the kitchen
It's a lot tidier than remember
Susie raises an eyebrow at Phil
Who the hell is she
Gram's ex-girlfriend
Phil points at his temple as if to say she's nuts
Girlfriend
Isn't he married
Barbara walks back into the hall
Welcome to the seventies
What do you want, Barbara
Barbara lights a cigarette
'm here to fulfill Gram's wishes
She waits for him to speak
That's nice
have no idea what you're talking about
She holds up an old piece of writing paper
13
: (2) Do you know what this is
Phil reaches for it, but Barbara snatches it away
(') It's Gram's will
She reads it out
(') To whom it may concern:  would like it to be known that it is my wish to leave Barbara Mansfield my assets and belongings in the event of my death
Signed: Ingram Cecil Parsons
Phil looks surprised
Did he write that with joined up writing or was it before he knew how
Barbara gives a wry smile
Still the jester Kaufman, and still very unfunny
That's not a will Barbara, and you know it
It's better than a will, actually
It's a signed promise from Gram to leave me all his assets and belongings
And anyway, it's really none of your business what this is
've come for the guitar
Phil shakes his head
Guitar
Yes
Gram's guitar
He always kept it here
It's been a while since you were around, Barbara
( ) 14
: (3) (') Gretchen, his wife, took it back six months ago
Barbara leans forward until their noses are almost touching
don't believe you, Kaufman
Barbara pushes past Phil who gives no resistance
She walks straight over to the couch and starts pulling up the cushions
Susie moves to stop her, but Phil holds her back and lets Barbara carry on
' Phil and Susie sit on the sofa, an island of calm in a sea of chaos
Around them, the floor is covered with papers, clothing, empty record covers, torn open cushions and books
broken drawer is propped against the table lampshade hangs crazily from its bearings, throwing strange shadows around the room
Suddenly, Susie gets up and kicks a cushion across the room
Hey, well done
You found the only unbroken thing
Why did you let her in
It's all part of the grieving process
How can she behave that way
Gram's not even in the ground yet
Phil stares at her
(') What
Nothing
He continues to look at her oddly
Don't you freak out on me
Do me a favor and get the guitar, sweetheart
15
: He disappears into the kitchen
Where are you going
(
) gotta make a call
man with glasses and an ill-fitting black suit does some paperwork
He is surrounded by coffins displaying garish 'special offer' price tickets
The phone rings, and the undertaker takes his time answering it
Afternoon
Joshua Tree Obsequies
' Phil is holding the phone
He frowns
(into phone) Obsequies
What the hell does that mean
'm
We hear the rest of Phil's mutter from the phone in the undertaker's hand
It's Latin
It means burial
Is there anything  can help with
Who am  speaking to
' Phil straightens up
He speaks curtly
Yes, you can help me as a matter of fact
am
Again, we hear Phil's voice trumpeting out of the phone
The undertaker changes his tone
Mister Parsons
'm sorry, 'll take a look immediately
16
: He puts down the phone and flicks through a big book
He purses his lips
He wipes his nose with a white silk handkerchief
Then he picks up the phone
(') Yeah, he was here
Mutter
(') New Orleans
Although he only just went, so he'll still be on his way to Los Angeles Airport
Big thrill for us here, as we're only a small facility
Nearly got Jane Mansfield in '67 when she passed through, but she got diverted to Frisco
Hello
No mutter
(') Hello
Hellooo
' The phone sits on the table but the room is empty
(
) Phil
Susie walks in, looks around, and leaves
' Phil is lying down in the back of Susie's station wagon, his feet sticking out of the back
Susie comes out of the house carrying the guitar, and sits on the steps, where she watches him
After a minute: What are you doing
These things aren't that big
Okay
Is that a problem
Not really
Susie is confused
17
: Well, that's good
No answer
Phil continues to check out the inside of her car
(') So what are you up to
It's best you don't know
Without a word, Susie gets up and walks into the house
Phil lies still
After a moment, she reappears with her bag
She flounces theatrically past him and opens the car door
Phil gets out of the back
don't know what this madness is, but 'm not getting involved
Well, that's the point
mean,  don't know what it is you're planning, but 'm not bailing you out again
Right
'm going
Again
She gets into the car and slams the door
She starts the engine, and Phil stands back, but the car doesn't move
After a moment the window winds down
This time, 'm not coming back
She gives him a 'so there' smile
(') 'm going to find a man who buys his ties in bulk
She drives away
' Phil arrives on his trike outside a small house
18
' man is sitting cross-legged on the floor
joss stick burns beside him, and sitar music plays in the background
This is  , and he is meditating
There is a loud hammering on the door
Larry shows no sign of having heard anything
More hammering at the door, but still no response
Then the letter box creaks open and an eye appears in the slot
After a moment, the eye disappears and Phil's face appears momentarily at the window
The window seems to be slightly higher than Phil, so his face appears every time he jumps up to peer into the room
(
) Hello
Anyone there
Then Phil is gone
Larry expels a big breath
The letterbox creaks opens again and the eye is back
(') (
) There you are
'm looking for Larry Osterberg
Larry sighs, and stretches
He gets up slowly, gently shakes himself to relax his muscles and walks to the door, which he opens
The door is unlocked
Phil barrels in and closes the door behind him
He turns to take a look around the room
You Larry Osterberg
Yes
Welcome to my house
This might be sarcastic, but any nuance is lost on Phil, who props the guitar up against the wall
Very nice
What's that noise
Manomanjari on the sitar by Nikhil Banerjee
(
Similar music may be used in this scene) Phil stares at him
19
: (carefully) Okay
He pops a cigar into his mouth
There's no smoking in here, 'm afraid
Phil stares meaningfully at the burning joss stick, but puts the cigar away
Right
Who are you, please
Oh, 'm Phil Kaufman
And how may  help you, Phil Kaufman
'd like to hire your car
Why
Well,  need to pick someone up at the airport
Don't you know anyone with a car
Yes, of course
It's just that 'm told your car is more suitable
see
In what way is my car more suitable
Well
it's a hearse
Yes
They both look at each other
Larry waits for Phil to speak
20
: (2) (') And how is a hearse going to be suitable for picking someone up from the airport
It's
a joke
joke
He doesn't look entirely convinced
prank
surprise
Well, okay
Is it two hundred dollars worth of surprise
No, it's more of a fifty dollar surprise
can lend you a bicycle
Besides, the car is booked
Booked how
use it to carry equipment for a band
Phil pulls some cash out of his pocket and sorts through it
Well, here's two hundred dollars to unbook it
Let 'em carry their own trombones
Phil passes the money over
Larry starts to count it
(') You don't need to count it
You could trust me
Larry doesn't pause counting
Let's see; 've never met you in my life, you shout through my mail slot, you want to hire my hearse as a joke, and
( ) 21
: (3) (') you're twenty dollars short
Why should  trust you
That last twenty is for gas
Anyway -  haven't even seen the car yet
'm the one who's operating on trust
It's a hearse
What else do you need to know
' The garage doors swing open and a hearse drives out into the sun
It is bright yellow and covered in painted flowers
One of the side windows is broken and a headlight hangs out
Phil's jaw drops open
Larry gets out of the driving seat and pats the roof, proudly
Meet Bernice
Bernice
Bernice is a Cadillac Superior Royale Tiara Limousine Funeral Coach
We've got a Seven gallon V8 engine offering three hundred and forty bhp at four thousand six hundred revolutions per minute
You're looking at a twenty one feet beauty with a one hundred and fifty six inch wheelbase containing a four barrel Rochester Quadrajet carburetor with Turbo Hydramatic transmission
Bernice weighs over six thousand pounds
There is a very long silence
It's yellow
Yes, it's yellow
Bernice comes in yellow
It's supposed to be black
But they're all black
22
: That might be my point
So how is a yellow hearse covered with flowers less of a surprise than a black hearse
paid you two hundred dollars for a black hearse
(patiently) No, you paid me a hundred and eighty dollars for a hearse, and a hearse is what you've got
If you take a long, hard look at Bernice, you'll see that she's one of a kind
She's big, she's fast, she's comfortable, and she's beautiful
But she's not black
They stare at each other for a moment
Then Phil sighs deeply
Okay
Where are the keys
Why
gotta go
Larry looks from Phil to Bernice and back again
Oh, no
She doesn't go anywhere without me
Phil thinks this over
Okay
Well, let's boogie
Larry runs across and closes the doors on a pile of amps and band equipment that now sits in the garage
Phil puts the guitar in the back seat and they get into the car
Larry pulls a screwdriver out of the glove compartment and jigs it about in the ignition until the engine catches
23
: Then he turns the keys and pull up and down to undo the steering lock
Phil watches curiously
Someone stole her last summer
Well, 've paid top dollar, so it's nice to see 'm getting the best
How did you hear of Bernice and me
You are famous throughout the greater Los Angeles area
Larry looks pleased
(') But you are the only guy with a hearse
Don't go getting carried away
One backfire, and Bernice is ready
The hearse weaves erratically across the road and then disappears in a cloud of exhaust smoke
' Barbara sits at a table in her shabby kitchen, reading the will
She lights a cigarette and sits back in her chair
The hearse drives under a huge sign which reads 'Welcome to Los Angeles Airport' and peels off the main road past some offices and cargo stores
Bernice drives into a giant hangar and pulls up outside a dark and shuttered office
- Phil glances out of the window
Pull over
Larry parks, and Phil looks at his watch
(') Shit
24
: What's the matter
Nothing
Well
What flight are they on
We'll wait here
Okay
Well, what time is the flight due
Soon
Okay
How soon
Why do you ask so many damn questions
Well
don't know
There is silence
Then: (') Shouldn't we be at arrivals
Look, will you please shut up asking me stuff
Okay
He looks out of the window, and then back at Phil, who now has his eyes closed
(') So how long are we going to wait
Phil doesn't answer for a moment
Just as Larry opens his mouth to ask again, Phil speaks
Morning
Larry looks at Phil with astonishment
25
: (2) Morning
What do you mean, morning
We'll make the pick-up in the morning
Larry tries to start the car
Phil leans over and plucks the screwdriver from his hand
He reclines his seat and closes his eyes
You wait till morning
'm going home
Larry opens the door and gets out of the car
He slams the door shut behind him and stomps off into the gloom
Phil doesn't move
-
- The drivers' door opens and Larry gets back into the car
'm only back because  don't trust you with Bernice
don't even know you, and if you think 'm going to leave my car with you and just walk away, then you've got another thought on the way
He stares at Phil, who hasn't moved an inch: eyes still closed, unlit cigar hanging out of the corner of his mouth, feet up on the dash
(') 'm staying right here
Where can keep an eye on things
There is still no response from Phil
After a moment, Larry settles back in his seat and closes his eyes
The hearse disappears into the gloom as the light fades and night falls
' door swings open, and Barbara appears
She is looking quite stunning, with a tight black suit doing equal justice to her womanly curves and her duties as a mourner
She strides down the sidewalk, and as a group of schoolchildren appears around the corner Barbara scatters left and right
26
: Then she cuts across the road, and a delivery van skids to a halt inches away, horn blaring
The driver leans out of the window, furious
Hey, lady
Barbara stops and whips round, her hair cascading across her shoulders, her blue eyes flashing
The man simply stares at her, enchanted by her beauty
Yes
He continues to stare, and is only shaken back to his senses by a burst of abuse from further back in the road
You
should be careful
Barbara smiles
Why, thank you
- Stanley is standing at the Airport Airlines check-in desk, facing the check-in clerk
Parsons
The clerk checks her paperwork
- You've just arrived from New Orleans, mister Parsons
Yes
- And you're flying directly back to New Orleans
On the same plane
That is correct
The clerk awaits an explanation, but none is forthcoming
She raises an eyebrow
- Okay
Well, enjoy your stay at Los Angeles Airport, Mister Parsons
27
: Thank you
Stanley turns to go, but then pauses
(') 've come to pick up my son's body
The line behind him falls quiet, and the officious clerk wobbles slightly
Stanley raises his voice
(') My son died out here, you see
So 've come to bring him home
Everyone looks at Stanley
Stanley looks at the clerk
(') 'm wondering if that's enough information for you
- Yes
Yes
'm sorry
We'll
see to it that you get every assistance on your journey, sir
Most kind
There is a line leading to the information desk, but Barbara ignores it
She walks up to a female teller, who is serving another customer, and cuts in
'd like to see the manager, please
Wait your turn
Barbara's eyes immediately water, and her lower lip trembles
'm sorry
It's just that the man  loved died yesterday was forgetting my manners
She dabs at her eyes with a lace handkerchief
The customer looks embarrassed
'm sorry
Please
go ahead
28
: Barbara fixes the teller with a no-nonsense look
The teller responds with a similar look
The manager
man unlocks the shutters with a clatter and goes inside
- The sound wakes Phil, who glances around and stretches, before getting out of the car
Phil walks over to the door and walks inside the mortuary
The clerk busies himself opening up
Phil wanders around and knocks into a coffin
The lid bangs closed and the sound echoes around the hangar
Can  help you
'm here to pick up a
coffin
The clerk looks Phil over
He's dressed in denim, with scuffed Harley-Davidson cowboy boots, topped off with a cut- down denim jacket with 'Sin City' stitched into the back
No you're not
Yes  am
No
You're here to pick up a casket
Phil looks irritated
Okay
casket
What flight number
29
: It   was due out on the next flight to   New Orleans, but 'm driving it   now
The stiff doesn't like to   fly
The clerk stares at him
You're one of those funny guys, right
Yeah, but it's my day off
Name
Mine or the
The deceased
Phil moves to the desk
Parsons
The clerk turns and shouts over his shoulder
Barney - bring up Parsons
- ' The Bank Manager is staring at the piece of paper
simply can't give you any money based on this piece of paper
Barbara is totally calm
It's not a piece of paper
It's a promise from Gram to leave me all his money
Well, 'm sorry, but it's highly likely that the estate will go to probate and be divided up accordingly, subject to a valid will existing
30
: She just looks at him
He tries again
(') Mister Parsons was a customer of ours
We can't just pass his money across to someone who says they're in the will
There are
rules
Barbara, realizing that she's getting nowhere, starts to cry
You don't seem to understand
These are his wishes
Barbara is now sobbing, and the bank manager is becoming increasing uncomfortable
He gives her his handkerchief
No
do
understand, Miss Mansfield
Really  do
Please tell me how 'm supposed to get my money
Well  imagine that you first need to prove that mister Parsons is actually dead
Are you saying that 'm lying
No, absolutely not
But getting a copy of the death certificate would probably be a good first step
- Stanley takes a swig from a hip flask and looks out of the window
very overweight, red-faced man squeezes into the next seat
He bangs Stanley with his knee as he sits, but Stanley doesn't move
He peers at Stanley and shuffles in his seat, but there is still no reaction
Next, a deep sigh is forced out between his fat wet lips - he is plainly keen to start a conversation
Stanley keeps looking out of the window
He is watching the cargo being loaded
Paw on the space, don'tcha think
Stanley turns slowly
31
: 'm sorry
The fat man smiles and extends a chubby hand, which Stanley shakes awkwardly and reluctantly
Gambrell, at yer assistance
Pernell Jayson
Jes' saying paw on the space in dese buckets
Stanley is obviously having problems fully understanding what is being said
After a moment: Stanley Parsons
Gowna be a trip
Besta know yer otherwise gowna be a slow one
Yes
suppose so
The clerk scribbles on a form
Papers
They'll be along
With this being a rush job, they said you'd understand
He passes a folded banknote across
The clerk pockets it without a change of expression
Well, you'd better tell them that we've got rules
The men stare at each other
Then Phil pulls another note out of his pocket and passes that over
Again, the clerk pockets it
(') And this is the exception which proves that particular rule
beat
Then: (') Although you don't need to tell them that
32
: Phil smiles broadly at him
The clerk turns and selects a casket from a gurney behind the counter
(') And this
is your deceased
Phil is wheeling a casket on a gurney down the middle of the hangar
He can see Larry peering through the window at him
He can also see a uniformed policeman approaching Larry from the other side of the street
As he speeds up to try and reach Larry first, the clerk calls out from his desk
Good luck with her
Phil closes his eyes and slows to a halt
Larry is jumping up and down nervously outside the window
The policeman appears at his shoulder
Excuse me, sir
Is that your hearse
Larry turns slowly
Hearse
The cop points at Bernice
That hearse
Larry has started to sweat profusely
That hearse
The cop looks at him carefully
Are you okay, sir
Okay
Sure
He leans against the window for support
33
- Stanley is looking out of the plane's window, but the fat man is now locked on
He gestures around him
Jes sayin' 'bout the space
Another thoughtful pause from Stanley
Yes
He glances out at the cargo loaders
Space ma game, kinda
Partitions
Fixed
Slidin'
Demountable
Integrated
Right
Always say
Why have one room
When you can have two
see
He leans forward to watch a loader wheeling a casket towards the back of the plane
What's your bidness
Stanley watches the coffin and doesn't answer
tear rolls down his face
The fat man pulls some candy out of his pocket and takes a bite
Phil and the clerk peer into the open casket
Yup
That's a she
And yours is supposed to be male
Yeah
The clerk walks back to the counter and peers at his paperwork
34
: Well
Gone
Gone
Whaddya mean, gone
We got the wrong box
Your box is being loaded
Nice work
So how do  get my box back
The clerk raises an eyebrow
Phil understands immediately
(') You're a damn thief
That's very hurtful
Phil reluctantly hands another note over and the clerk speaks into a radio
(') Barney
You receiving
Larry is standing by the hearse
The cop is reading his license
So, whatcha doin' here
Doing
Here
- Stanley has his eyes closed
The fat man eats
Suddenly, Stanley's eyes snap open and he peers out of the window motorized cart chugs into view with the casket covered in a blanket on the back
It is driving away from the plane
What the hell
He stands up and turns to the fat man
(') Excuse me
Why
35
: need to get off the plane
The fat man reluctantly struggles to his feet and squeezes out into the aisle
Sheesh
Only jes' got settled
Phil glances nervously out to where Larry is being interrogated by the cop
The clerk is reading a paper
Can you speed things up
What's the hurry
Phil is distracted, watching the cop and Larry out of the window
'd like to get to the Joshua Tree while it's still light
The clerk looks up
thought you were taking him to New Orleans
What
When you came in, you said you were driving the casket out to New Orleans
But just now you said you were headed for the Joshua Tree
Phil is under pressure
Joshua Tree, yeah
buzzer sounds
No-one moves
(') Joshua Tree, Louisiana
Just outside the city
Never heard of that
36
: It's small
Just another local community struggling to get by
The buzzer goes again, and Phil attempts to change the subject
(') Use your phone
After a moment, the clerk nods towards the phone on the desk, before turning and disappearing into the rear of the mortuary
Phil wipes some sweat from his forehead, picks up the phone and dials
' Susie is packing
The phone rings and she hesitates for a moment
Then she continues loading her case, leaving the phone unanswered
Stanley tries to ask a question at the check in desk, but gives up and walks toward an exit
The clerk returns with a casket on a gurney and Phil replaces the receiver as the clerk flips open the top of the casket and peers inside
(into casket) Hello there
We was looking for you
He wheels the casket over and Phil has a quick look inside
(') Need you to sign for it again
Phil signs the papers
(') Looks like it's your lucky day after all
Yeah
'm a real lucky guy
Phil again glances out of the window
37
The cop is wandering around the hearse
Larry trails behind him, disconsolately
don't like the look of you
(miserably) No
Fair enough
Wherever there's a hippie there's a crime, even if it hasn't happened yet
That's what always say
Right
Good saying
He prods at the broken light with his baton
So whatcha doing here
We're meeting someone off a flight
You're meeting someone off a flight
Yes
In a hearse
Yes
It's a
surprise
Which parts the surprise: The fact that you're in a bright yellow hearse, the fact that you're dressed like something out of a horror film, or the fact that you're half a mile from the terminal and they're gonna have to walk across two runways to reach you
Larry is looking increasingly desperate
38
: Well
the first part
The cop nods and repeats it to himself
The first part
They stare at each other
(') Okay, now why don't you tell me what the hell's going on
Going on
They stare at each other
The cop shifts position and purses his lips
Larry stares at the ground looking for some kind of inspiration
Just when the silence moves beyond uncomfortable, the door of the mortuary opens and Phil clatters out with the casket
Well,  don't care if it is first thing in the morning - but  sure need a coffee
tell you, 've never seen so many darned bits of paper to sign
It's paperwork which is slowing this great country down
We're drowning in triplicate
He's busying himself at the back of the hearse, and appears to notice the cop for the first time
(') Good morning officer
The cop peers at him suspiciously
Mornin'
was just saying how people with work to do - people like yourself, officer - are just getting engulfed by paper
Grab the end, will you
Doesn't that just drive you plain crazy
The cop hesitates and then takes the end of the casket and helps load it into the hearse
39
: (2) guess it does
Phil gestures at Larry to get into the car, which he does
One casket, six sheets to sign
Six
That can't be right
Does that sound right to you
He closes the back doors and gets into the passenger seat
Nope
Sure don't
And the very last thing  want to do is to hold you up further with my chatter
Thank you for your help, officer
You have a good day, now
It looks like they've got away with it
But: Just a moment, boys
Phil smiles up at him
Yessir
Your sidekick here has just finished telling me that you're gonna pick someone up from the terminal
surprise, he said
And here you are loading a coffin into your vehicle
Phil doesn't miss a beat
And there you have it, officer
You see the gentleman we're meeting from the plane doesn't yet know about the sad passing of his
aunt
And you're gonna meet him off his flight with her coffin
He raises an eyebrow
40
: (3) (') That's a real nice touch
Yeah
We're doing it this way for the avoidance of doubt
He gestures at Larry to start the car
Larry pulls out the screwdriver and starts to jig it about in the ignition
The cop watches
As the engine refuses to catch, Larry starts to panic
Ignition's a bit temperamental
Right
More fiddling
No ignition
Have to use a screwdriver
see that
The car starts
Thanks for everything, officer
We'd best be off
He looks meaningfully at the cop, who grudgingly moves back
As they move off, Stanley hurries round the corner with his overnight bag in his hand
- Inside the car, Phil bangs on the dashboard in joy and exultation
Yes
We did it
Did what
What did we do
Phil changes the subject
What was all that babbling about earlier
didn't babble
just
have a problem with authority
41
: What the hell does that mean
don't like them and  don't know what to say to them
They make me feel uneasy
Well of course they make you feel uneasy
They're supposed to make you feel uneasy
Larry sulks
Phil shakes his head and glances back at the cop and Larry crashes the car straight into the hangar wall
We pull back to reveal the enormous opening that Larry has missed
- They both sit there, staring out of the windshield at the wall
You hit the wall
clipped it
clipped the wall
(shouts) There's a gap fifty yards wide
You just had to aim for the gap
How could you miss the gap
(babbles) was distracted
We're supposed to be picking someone up and you arrive with a coffin and 'd only just woken up and
The cop peers in at the window and gestures at Phil to wind it down
As he does, the glass falls out
Hello, officer
guess they make these hearses wider than they need to
The cop ignores him and concentrates on Larry
42
: Are you on drugs, boy
Larry swallows hard
Uh, not at this time, no sir
Not at this time
Okay, well let's see
You just missed a gap of fifty yards and hit a wall in broad daylight
Why was that
Larry licks his lips
Well
Pause
Phil wills him to speak
Well
Still nothing
Larry looks like he's trying to form words, but nothing emerges
Now 'm gonna
The radio in his car crackles into life
We - and he - are too far away to hear what is said
He is torn for a moment, but then: (') Wait
He walks back to his car
Phil shakes his head
Fantastic
Well done
Oh, right
So it's all my fault
You
you just drove into a wall
Of course it's your fault
Jesus
They both stare out of the window at the cop, who is talking animatedly into his radio
Then the flashing lights and siren go on
(') Here it comes
43
: (2) The police car drives up to, and then past, the hearse, before disappearing out of the hanger at speed
Phil and Larry look at each other
(') Well
Well what
Well, what are we doing now
He said to wait
Phil just stares at him
After a moment, Larry reverses Bernice and then drives the battered car through the gap and out of the hangar
Phil slumps back in his seat
Nice going, hippie
Went right through the gap that time
Larry says nothing
Phil leans back in his seat
(') Well, we got it
Whoooh
Larry slams the brakes on and the huge car skids to a halt in a cloud of dust
Phil is flung forward in his seat
(') Jesus
What now
Get out
What are you talking about
He looks nervously out of the back window
(') 'mon, we gotta keep moving
Get out and take your friend with you
Look,  can see you're a bit
sensitive about this whole
casket thing
44
: (3) Get out
(shouts) Stop saying that
can't get out
Why not
look, it's not right to throw me out onto the street with a coffin
Larry slips the car into gear and it moves forward
(') Thank God
Larry makes a -turn
(') What the hell are you doing
'm driving back to the mortuary
You can't do that
Nearly at the turn now
Phil opens the car door with a mind to jump out, but one look at the fast-moving road changes his mind
He glowers at Larry and shuts the door
The hearse skids round the corner, Larry slams on the brakes and the car slides to a halt outside the mortuary
Talk
What talk
Larry gestures towards the back of the car
Who's the stiff
The clerk is standing at the counter staring at Stanley
Parsons
45
: Parsons
The clerk looks worried
Long blond hair, blue eyes, mid- twenties
Well
yes
Was he in a Berkeley
What's a Berkeley
luxury casket of solid mahogany, finished with a split- hinged lid, eight brass plated casket handles and an engraved inscription plate
& Barbara is sitting in a cubicle opposite a middle-aged woman in a suit
Her allure appears lost on the official, who gives the dress a disapproving look
Parsons
Parsons
And he's a
musician
She says 'musician' with great distaste
Was
He was a musician
The woman flicks through some papers on her desk
Barbara watches her
Eventually: 'm afraid we have no official notification of death
With a flourish, Barbara places a copy of the  Times on the table
The headline is 'Country-Rock Pioneer Dead' in large black print
The official glances at it and gives a thin smile
46
: (') At this current time, the Greater Los Angeles registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths does not regard the local newspaper as an official recorder of record
- Larry is staring at Phil
Waiting
Can we please talk about this later
This is not a great place to be right now
Larry moves to get out of the car
Phil grabs his arm
(') Oh, just a minute
Now understand
You think there's a body back there
He starts to laugh
(') You think there's a body in the coffin
Larry watches him laugh
Phil catches the look and stops laughing
(') can fully understand why you'd think that
mean, it is a coffin and all
But would  - would  really - steal a real live dead body
Stanley and the clerk are staring at each other
You just gave the body away
Well, it's not like this is a bank
People round here don't generally take dead bodies they're not entitled to
Why did you give it to him
47
: Well, he signed for it
Who signed for it
The clerk peers at his paperwork
When he eventually speaks, it is wearily
John Nobody
And where do  find this John Nobody
The clerk's attention switches to a point just above Stanley's shoulder
He points out through the window to where the hearse is parked over a hundred yards away
There
- Larry is staring at Phil
Empty
Absolutely, completely, totally
It looked pretty heavy, for an empty casket
They are made of finest
poplar
That's very heavy wood
Poplar
No way
Mahogany, or oak, but not
Look, 'm not going to argue with you now
Poplar is very well suited to the making of coffins
Larry stares hard at Phil
We see the door of the mortuary open over Larry's shoulder and Stanley and the clerk emerge
Then: 48
: Okay
So why have we got an empty coffin in the back of the car
Phil glances at the approaching Stanley
'm
selling them on to a company in Palm Springs
Lots of stiffs, lots of money
And then of course, it's very environmentally sound
And
look, under the circumstances, perhaps we should renegotiate the financial arrangement between us
Larry still stares at Phil
Stanley is almost at the car
(') Fifty-fifty
That baby's worth two grand
Stanley is getting ever closer
Phil can see him in his wing mirror
Larry releases the safety brake and the giant car roars away, leaving Stanley standing in a cloud of dust
& Barbara picks up the newspaper and rips it into pieces, which she scatters onto the desk
She walks towards the door
Don't forget now
Barbara keeps walking
(') Notification of death
Barbara is gone, the door slamming behind her
Larry drives
Phil is still pitching
They are driving alongside the airport runway
So then Bobby transfers 'em into hardboard boxes just prior to the cremation and  drive the caskets over to a guy  know in Palm Springs who resells them
49
: As new
Well 'm not sure the 'one careful owner' thing works with coffins
The whole thing is completely immoral
Yeah, well
saw how outraged you were back there, when mentioned money
Just think of it as recycling
Look,  really need to get home
Why
just
do
Larry is sweating
Well, while  acknowledge the power of your argument, we have to be somewhere else
So just settle back and enjoy the ride
Larry slows the car down
(') What now
Gas now
Larry pulls the car onto a Gas station forecourt
An attendant is filling Bernice
He looks Phil over
You an undertaker
Sure am
50
: Ain't yer surposed to be in black
Nope
We're special rock 'n roll undertakers
Musical morticians
- Larry is sitting on the toilet seat - still fully dressed but bent double with cramps
Then Phil bangs on the door and calls from outside
(
) 'mon, hippie - let's roll
Larry turns to look at his reflection in the grimy mirror
He is shaking
The tank is full, and the attendant screws the cap back on
Phil reaches into the back and pulls out his jerry can
He passes it to the guy
High test
This car runs on regular
Phil raises an eyebrow, glances across at the casket, and winks
Who says it's for the car
The man gapes at him
Larry walks over to the car and Phil gets into the passenger seat
He passes some money to the attendant and takes the can
Ain't fer the car
Nope
Larry jiggles the screwdriver, slips Bernice into gear, and they're gone
The attendant watches them go
Larry is driving, Phil is looking out of the window
They are still in a built up area with cars around them
51
: We could go back
Why would we want to do that
wasn't expecting a long trip
haven't packed any spare clothes
We could pick up some supplies and drive out tomorrow
You want to go home to pick up fresh clothes
Well, yes
Phil stares at him
And then drive back out tomorrow
We could do that
Just drive the car, okay
We could just
No
It would
No
No
' Barbara is standing in her sitting room, the phone to her ear
You might need to repeat that
52
: Her mouth drops open and she sinks down onto her couch
(') Stolen
What the hell do you mean, stolen
Who steals a body
Phil is smoking
Larry is driving, his fingers tapping nervously on the wheel
He looks distracted and speaks to break the silence
still don't fully understand what you do
Well,  do everything
Everything
This little number is for drinking money
By trade 'm a Road Manager
Oh, one of those
Like a well- paid gopher
No, not like a well-paid gopher
'm responsible for movement, maintenance and management
'm a confidante and a companion, a partner and a patron, an ally, agent and ambassador
'm like an executive nanny
Not a gopher
Larry backs down with hint of sarcasm An executive nanny, not a gopher
Thanks for clearing that up
10 Bernice cruises along the freeway then takes an exit for Joshua tree
Stanley and the clerk are standing just inside the hangar door
53
: So where are the cops
The clerk pulls the money out of his top pocket and looks at it
He shrugs his shoulders
called them
There's supposed to be a funeral in New Orleans
need to find my boy
New Orleans
Clerk points into the distance
(') The man said he's going to Joshua Tree, Louisiana
Joshua Tree
' Susie is moving her suitcases into the sitting room when there is a banging on the front door
Susie opens the door and Barbara is standing outside
Where's the son of a bitch
The son of a bitch isn't here
Well, he's stolen Gram
Susie looks bemused
Stolen Gram
Barbara lights a cigarette
They had some kind of weird pact
think Phil's taken Gram out to the desert
Why
54
: Some kind of voodoo thing with hot wax and dolls to stick pins in
Don't be ridiculous
Barbara glances down at the packed bags and smiles
Now that is a wise move, if you ask me
didn't ask you
The hearse is parked by the side of the road, near a rickety stall where an old lady sits, selling melons
Larry sits inside and Phil walks to a phone by the side of the road
He dials
' The girls are still arguing
You'll learn about Phil Kaufman
If you stick around long enough
And you know him
know he's a brainless, interfering asshole, yes
don't need to listen to this garbage
The phone starts to ring
Susie instinctively moves towards it, then stops
Barbara watches carefully
That's him, isn't it
Generally, it's best to answer the phone to discover who's calling
She still makes no move to answer it
55
: Fine
She walks across the room and picks up the phone
Phil is holding the phone
Hello baby, it's the love machine
How are ya
' Barbara smiles unpleasantly
Hello Kaufman
know what you're up to, you thieving bastard
know where you're going, and  know about your sick, revolting plans, and 'm coming after you
And when catch you
Phil looks surprised
Hello Barbara
How nice to hear from you again
And so soon
Suddenly the door of the hearse flies open and Larry runs out
Phil holds the phone away from his ear as Barbara's shouting can be heard coming out of the receiver
He watches as Larry just makes it to a cactus and is violently sick
He glances across to where the old melon woman watches, expressionless, from her stall
After a moment, Larry wipes himself down and walks back to the car
(') Sorry Barb, gotta go
He goes to replace the receiver, and then pops in a last comment
(') It's been real, though
He puts the phone down, cutting off Barbara's squawk and watches Larry get into the hearse
He frowns
56
' Barbara slams the phone down
Then she picks up the receiver again and smashes it onto the table
Sonofabitch
She walks to the door, brushing past Susie
Then she stops
(') Okay, honey
Do you want to see who Phil Kaufman really is
Do you want to see what he's capable of
Barbara shows Susie the door
(') Or maybe you already know 'm right
Susie hesitantly dismisses the challenge
You don't know shit about him
Well why don't we find out
Barbara turns and walks out
Susie looks at her packed bags then follows
Phil gets into the hearse, looks back at the coffin and sniffs
He looks down at the air conditioning and turns it up full
Larry starts the engine and the car stalls
So what's that about
Sunstroke
Phil shakes his head
You've hardly left the car since we met
How can you have sunstroke
'm susceptible
57
: Phil doesn't look convinced
You're a winner, that's what you are
winner
Eventually, the engine catches
Phil immediately gestures at a small road that heads off into the desert
(') Turn off here
This isn't the way to Palm Springs
Phil winks at him
It is if you're a coffin smuggler
The old woman watches them go
: We stay on the old woman and her melon stall as the light rapidly changes, cars and pedestrians whizz by, and an hour passes in moments
As we slow to normal speed, a car drives past, stops, and reverses back to park by the stall
Stanley gets out of the Avis/Budget hire car
Good afternoon
Hello
He points at a melon
'll take that one, please
Fifty cents
58
: was wondering
Have you seen a hearse pass this way in the last couple of hours
What's it look like
The question throws Stanley
Well
It
It's a big car big yellow car
Two guys inside
Was one of 'em sick in them bushes
Well
don't know
Maybe
The old woman nods
Yup
seen it
Larry drives and talks, Phil looks tense
See, the Yin is the negative - the darkside
And the Yang represents positive - good
If you like, the first is earth and the second heaven
: - Larry still talks
Phil now looks bored
The Yin Yang symbol is really evocative about the whole concept
As you travel around the circle, white or black will increase until the opposite color is almost gone
But never totally gone, right
And this cycle then repeats for the opposite color
: 59
- Larry still talks, glancing across to Phil to make his point every now and then
Phil is tossing a cigarette into the air and trying to catch it between his teeth
What seems like Yin is often supported by Yang, and vice versa
Let me give you an example: To truly know good, you must first know evil, and without good as a comparison, nothing can be evil
So by allowing Yin to flourish, you welcome Yan
By letting go of Yin, you are waiting for its return
Another example is
There is a crash, and the car slams to a halt
Larry is thrown forward, but manages to grab the wheel
Phil is not so lucky, and catapults into the dashboard, before being thrown back into his seat, the crumpled cigarette still gripped between his teeth
Bernice has driven into a road sign set into a concrete pillar
In fact, the sign that Bernice has driven into is the only thing anywhere near the road for miles in any direction
Phil is dazed
He checks his forehead, which is bleeding
Then he gazes out at the desolate road and the solitary, buckled sign
It would be really nice if we could get through a couple of hours without crashing the car
was distracted
Phil looks out of the window at the vast expanse of nothing but desert
Of course you were
60
: There is a faint noise
Larry hears it first and then Phil and then, as they strain to identify it, they see a tiny dot on the road ahead of them, which grows and grows as they watch it, and they peer hard into the wind to identify it and
it's a motorcycle cop
(') don't believe it
Middle of nowhere, and
quick - stand in front of the car
They jump out of the car and shuffle sideways, until they are standing in front of the actual point of collision
What now
Pretend we're having a conversation
The buckled sign hangs dangerously above them as they both grin at the approaching policeman in a friendly manner
Okay
What about
don't know what about
Ever since  met you, you've talked
Yabba, yabba, yabba, every waking minute
Religion, your supersonic, supercharged car, the darkside
Now you need to talk, and you can't think of anything to say
The cop slows down but drives past
Phil waves at him
(') Whatever your damn fool religion is called,  think it works
Well
it's more a philosophy than a religion
The cop does a -turn and motors towards them
Oh, well done
Good work
He shoots a vicious look at Larry
The cop parks his bike and removes his helmet
61
: As he opens his mouth to speak, a headlight falls off the car and rolls off the road
They all watch it go
Afternoon
Afternoon, officer
How's it going today
The sign gives an ominous creak
Larry takes a sideways step, out of danger
Oh, it's going fine, thank you
How are things with you
Fine, fine
We just
stopped to take a look at
He waves his arm at the desert
(') the fine view you folks have got around here
The cop takes his sunglasses off and takes a look around, as if it's the first time he's seen it
Well, it is mighty nice around these parts
If you like desert
They all look appreciatively at the desert, and the cop glances down at the keys in Larry's hand
(') (to Larry) And how are things with you today, sir
Larry looks flustered
Ooooh, 'm well
Really well, actually
Thank you
The cop doesn't respond, just keeps looking at Larry with a pleasant half-smile on his face
The reason  ask, is that you appear to have driven into one of our road signs
62
: (2) Larry turns and appears to see the huge buckled pole for the first time
Oh
'm surprised that you hadn't noticed earlier, as it does appear to be impeding your forward progress
Phil starts to laugh
That's a great line
The cop turns to Phil
He is still smiling
Thank you
long pause
Then: (') wonder if you gentlemen can help me
Anything
'm looking for some fellows who stole a body back there at the airport
Larry wobbles with shock
body
Stole a body
body
Rather like the one in the back of your car
That's an empty coffin, officer
The cop ignores him
Phil lights his cigar
63
: (3) know it sounds strange
But these guys - there are two of them - they stole a body, loaded it into the back of an old yellow hearse painted with flowers, and they're supposed to be driving out this way
Larry thinks hard
Hearse
Flowers
He looks to Phil for support
Phil raises an eyebrow
think he's onto us, Larry
He's just having a little fun at our expense
The cop is no longer smiling
In the car, please
Phil opens the door and empty beer bottles cascade out into the road
They get into the car and the cop cuffs them together through the steering wheel and takes the car keys
Then he walks back over to his bike and starts to talk into the radio
Phil closes his eyes and shakes his head
God damn
He said a body
He said we stole a body
Phil opens his eyes
He meant a coffin
He didn't say 'coffin'
He said 'body'
Tell me we haven't stolen a real person
64
: Look, the place that  get the coffins from probably haven't filed a report yet
It'll all be sorted out within the hour
Trust me
Oh, 'm just overflowing with trust for you, man
feel this overwhelming feeling of
trust every time  look at you
He shakes his head
(') 'm gonna check inside that box just as soon as we're out of here
They both stare out of the window
Phil bangs the cuffs against the wheel
Jesus
They sit glowering out of different windows at different bits of desert
The motorcycle cop can be heard talking into his radio
What are we going to do
Time
What
(bitterly) We're going to be arrested, that's what we're going to do
Then we'll go to court and then we'll go to jail and we'll do that for a while
Larry mulls this over
What about if  could slip out of these cuffs
Phil treats the theoretical question with indifference
65
: (2) Yeah, that would be great
Then we could suspend you from a bridge in a straitjacket and set the rope on fire
No, really
really can slip these cuffs
He has Phil's attention now
Okay
Show me
Larry pops his middle finger out of its socket, squeezes his hand and slides it out of the handcuff
He hands the other cuff to Phil, who stares at him in astonishment
Do you think we should go
Yes,  think we should go
Larry starts the car
He throws it into reverse and the bumper slowly disengages from the metal signpost
Suddenly the car tears loose and flies backwards, smashing into the cop's motorcycle, leaving him holding the radio and its trailing wire
Larry slams on the brakes
Oh shit
Nicely done
He rolls down his window and addresses the cop, who is staring with horror at his ruined motorcycle
(') We'll be moving on, now that your sign no longer appears to be impeding our forward progress
Bernice accelerates away but slowly starts to turn in a wide ark and circles the smashed bike
The cop chases them
Phil screams at Larry
What the hell are you doing
66
: The steering lock is on
Well
turn it off
can't - he's got the keys
Phil turns to watch the chasing policeman
So, we've escaped but we can only drive in a circle
Yes
They do another circuit
The exhausted cop stops, breathing heavily, and then watches in astonishment as the hearse turns and heads back towards him
Phil and Larry stare at the policeman out of the window as the car sweeps past
The cop gets his gun out of his holster, and Phil reaches into the glove box and pulls out the screwdriver
He leans across Larry, jams it into the wheel column, and snaps the steering lock in two
The hearse's direction immediately changes
Can we please go
Okay
The hearse roars away and the cop watches it go
' Barbara drives and Susie sits in the passenger seat
It doesn't look as if they've spoken for hours
If you hate Phil so much, why are you chasing him across California
He's got Gram and  need him
67
: Well, that's really touching
But
you've got to come to terms with the fact that he's dead
Barbara shoots her a withering look
know he's dead, Honey
But he hasn't been officially identified, and there's no certificate of death
don't understand
Let's just say 'm overly sentimental, okay
This is all about money, isn't it
Isn't everything
Why do you think you deserve anything
was a great support to Gram before Kaufman came along and spoiled the party
Phil's not responsible for your problems with Gram
What do you know
know that he can be a pain in the ass, but when it came to Gram, Phil only ever did the right thing
In his whole life, Phil Kaufman didn't do anything because it was the right thing to do
You can bet the ranch that wherever he is, he's having some fun
68
: (2) Maybe that's what  like about him
Sure it is, honey
That's why your bags were packed
Have you any idea what it's like to really love someone
Barbara laughs
You might exclusively love Phil Kaufman - but unfortunately, so does he
You're just handy to have around
don't have to listen to this
Susie leans over, grabs the safety brake and pulls it up hard
The car swerves and skids to a stop
(') Okay, you vindictive bitch
'm going with you to Joshua Tree because my life seems to have been turned upside down and want to know why
But you don't know me and  won't let you judge me
Do it again and 'll smash that pretty little face of yours off the fucking road
Got it
Barbara dismisses her anger with a tight little smile
The truth can hurt, can't it
- Phil finishes his beer, rubs his eyes and slumps back in his seat
He looks terrible, but not as bad as Larry who is pasty and sweating
Well, that's it
They're going to lock me up and throw away the key
Why would they do that
69
: You saw what happened
drove over that cop's bike
That's destruction of police property, or something
You worry too much
Not 'til  met you
Phil finishes his beer and peers at the empty bottle
Then something catches his eye and he leans forward in his seat
Jesus - what the hell is that
large plaster dinosaur appears ahead
It's a dinosaur
Very perceptive
What's it doing
As they get nearer, they can see that the huge model is carrying a sign
(reads) 'The Polyonax Place'
(aside: to Phil) Polyonax is probably some kind of dinosaur
Phil shoots him a look
(') (reads) 'Dinoburgers, Reptile Steaks and Primeval Soup
Titanosaurion portions, prehistoric pricing
Liquor served'
Pull over - let's
eat
Let's not
The cops'll be after us and we should just get on to Palm Springs and do the thing, and then  can get home and you can
do whatever it is you do
Let's do that
70
: (2) We need to stop
'm starting to get hungry
'm not nice hungry
You surprise me
vote we keep going
What gave you the impression this was a democracy
The hearse pulls up around the back of the building, and parks in a place that is hidden from the road
Phil gets out and stretches
He is joined by Larry, and they both peer round the side of the building to check that they have not been observed
Then they walk towards the entrance
Police Car with siren blaring and lights flashing speeds past on the road
- We are with a short-order cook
He expertly flips a burger from a hotplate and adds it to a plate overflowing with bacon, sausage and fries
He slips this plate onto a tray on which there is a second plate containing two pieces of plain bread and some lettuce
He dings a bell and a waiter enters and picks up the tray
We move with the tray as he carries it from the kitchen and into the dining area
He stops at the bar to load three foaming glasses of beer and a glass of water onto the tray, and delivers it to Phil and Larry, who are sitting in a window booth
Larry has his head resting on the table
He lifts it as soon as the food arrives
You frighten him
do not
Everyone else, he announces the food when he brings it
Diplodocus this and Allosaurus that
Us he just slaps it down and runs for cover
They both look at Larry's bread and lettuce
71
: (') It's probably the rabbit food
Look, 'm a vegetarian
have a problem with dead flesh
Okay
understand
Really  do
That stuff'll mess you right up every time
Phil picks up the first beer and downs it in one go
'
Stanley is driving along the road
He puts his hand in his pocket, takes out his hip flask, pops the lid and goes to take a drink
It's empty
Then he notices the dinosaur
Phil pushes his full plate away and finishes off the third beer
He gets up
Larry notices he hasn't eaten anything
thought you were hungry
Phil ignores him
Gotta make a call
He glances around and then walks over to the bar
(') Hey man, where's the phone
Out back
He jerks his head by way of direction
Phil wanders off just as the door opens and Stanley walks in
Good afternoon
Yup
Do you have a telephone  might use
In a minute,  do
72
: In a minute
Yeah
Phone's for customers
Stanley looks confused
Then he understands
'd better order, then
Right
Stanley picks up a menu
' ' - Phil dials a number on the phone
' The sitting room is empty
The phone rings
And rings
' ' - When it becomes clear that no one is going to answer, Phil replaces the receiver and walks back into the diner
He pushes past Stanley as he goes to the bar
Phil joins Larry and puts a bag of beers on the table
Speak to her
Who
Your girlfriend
Your wife
None of your damn business
So you didn't
pause
No
73
: Maybe she's out
Shopping, or something
Phil pours the rest of his beer down his throat, before signaling the barman to serve him another
Yeah, that'll be it
Shopping
He raises an eyebrow at Larry
Behind him, we see Stanley walk in and take a seat at the bar
(to barman) Beer
The barman gives Stanley his beer
(') Would you put a scotch in there, please
Sure
He pours the spirit in
(') Bad day
Stanley rubs the top of his head
Yeaaaaah
Yeah, a real bad day
What happened
My boy died out here the other day, and some punks have stolen his body
Stanley reaches for his pocket
The barman puts his hand up to refuse the money
That's worth a shot on the house
The barman tips a little more scotch into the beer
Thanks
74
: (2) Stanley takes a drink
Phil slips some money on the bar and stands up
(to Larry) We gotta go
Larry is listening to the conversation
Haven't finished my drink
(to Stanley) Why would someone steal a body
Phil picks up the glass of water and drinks it down
All gone
'mon
He turns and walks to the door
Well, maybe they were souvenir hunters or something
My boy's kinda famous
Who is he
Phil is back
Gram Parsons
The Barman looks surprised
Gram Parsons
Phil reaches across and grabs the back of Larry's jacket
Gram Parsons
Both the Barman and Stanley look round, but Larry's stool is now empty, spinning
He and Phil are already at the door
Phil propels Larry outside
75
: Gram Parsons
Is Gram Parsons dead
Better get going
He said someone took Gram Parson's body
Two people
Yeah, he was a real blabbermouth
In fact,  thought he was never gonna stop talking
Anyway, although that's real interesting, we've gotta keep to the schedule
Schedule
What schedule
There is no schedule
Well,  think we should just make our delivery as soon as possible, don't you
Get our package to Palm Springs
Remember
Larry looks horrified
Package
We've stolen that man's son
Stolen
his son
That's outrageous
'm appalled that you could even think we'd do such a thing
They move round the back of the Polyonax Place, where Bernice is hidden behind an outhouse
don't know what you take me for
want to see in that box
Larry walks round to the back of the car
We've really got to go
Larry swings open the back window and pulls at the casket
It's heavy
76
: (2) Phil glances at his watch
Okay, then
Well, if you're satisfied, let's go
said it's heavy
Heavy, yes
Well, it is made of wood
Wood is heavy
Actually
Yeah,  remember
Finest poplar
Larry slides the top of the casket off and looks inside
He recoils
(') Jesusjesusjesus
He drops the lid and looks at Phil, horrified
Phil walks over and looks inside
Gosh, they must have given us a full one
We'll have to sort that all out when we get to Palm Springs and
Larry is staring at him with horror
Oh my God
You stole Gram Parsons
Phil gives up
Well, technically, we stole Gram Parsons
stole a coffin,  didn't know there was a body in it
'd save that line for court
As the enormity of the news starts to sink in, Larry hops up and down in panic
Phil watches him
(') What are you doing now
77
: (3) Larry is losing control
don't know
What am  doing
mean
What-am--doing
Why am  here
Why am  with you
Calm down
thought it was bad enough when ran over the cop's bike, but now 'm a fucking body snatcher
Well, when you've quite finished, we should go
Larry goggles at him
His voice takes on a level of hysteria
Go
You go
tell you what 'm going to do
'm going inside and 'm going to give that man his son back
'm going to do the right thing, 'm going to follow my conscience, 'm going to
Larry walks towards the bar, then quick walks, then runs
Phil tackles him around the legs and they both fall
Larry's head hits the ground hard and he lies there unconscious
Shit
Phil picks him up, slings him into the passenger seat, and slides behind the wheel
The hearse moves off
Stanley takes another drink and glances out of the window, just as the bright yellow hearse drives past
He stands up and walks to the window
Son of a bitch
The hearse picks up speed and powers down the highway out into the desert
78
' Susie seethes and Barbara smokes
You're not a very nice person, are you
Nice
No,  suppose not
Does it matter
Susie looks surprised
It might get you further
do okay
Listen,  was an orphan at fourteen and a waitress at fifteen
do what  do because it puts food on my table, and because if  don't look after myself, no-one else will
So what do you want from us
don't want anything from you
It would be a bonus to see Kaufman crash and burn, but don't need to be there when it happens
Why do you hate Phil so much
Barbara lights another cigarette
Gram was the first good guy ever hooked up with
He wasn't perfect, but it worked between us
We just seemed to fit together
But Gram was already wild, and  made him wilder
Kaufman watched over him like a hawk, and when he felt things were getting out of control, he turned Gram against me
lost the only decent thing in my life
Surely Phil was just looking after Gram
79
: Gram was an adult
He didn't need a nursemaid
Except that now he's dead
Yeah
Without my help and while Kaufman was babysitting
Silence for a moment
don't like you much, Barbara
That's fine
just want what's mine and then 'm gone
Gone real fast
The hearse powers through along the desert highway
They pass a sign which reads 'If You're Looking for the Joshua Tree National Monument, You're Getting Close
If You're not, You're Getting Lost
' Phil is getting very tired, his vision is blurring and he shakes his head to wake himself up
He glances across and sees that Larry is awake and staring at him
Welcome back, hippie
So why d'ya do it
Do what
Have a guess
There is a moment's silence
Well,  gave my word
This is what Gram wanted
What, cruise around the desert until he starts to smell
Were you - both bombed
80
: Phil looks offended
Do you have friends
Of course  have friends
Well, what would you do for them
Anything, within reason
Phil stares out of the window
That's what  hate about people like you
Everything's 'within reason'
There are always boundaries, provisos
You only operate with a safety net
Larry is confused
Tell me something - if it was the other way round, would Gram be sitting here, driving your bones out into the desert
Phil says nothing
(') Well
You've missed the point
See, it doesn't matter what he would do, or what you and your tie-dyed friends think is the correct way to behave
To me, it only matters what  do
Where you have boundaries and limits and thresholds -  only have right and wrong
If  make a promise, keep it - that's right
If break that promise - that's wrong
Phil rubs his eyes, tired
Suddenly, Larry smashes Phil across the head with a bottle of Jack Daniels
Phil slumps back in the seat and Larry, dropping the bloodied weapon, reaches across to grab the wheel and slow the hearse
81
Bernice fishtails across the road as Larry struggles to retain control
It eventually slides to a halt
Larry gets out and runs round to the drivers' door
Larry stares down at Phil
Ohmygod
He slides Phil across the seat and slips behind the wheel
He shouts at the unconscious Phil
(') You made me do it, you bastard
've never hit anyone in my life, but you pushed and you pushed and
you gave me no choice
Larry prods Phil to ensure he's unresponsive
The hearse executes a wide -turn before gently rejoining the highway and heading back towards town
moment after completing the turn, the one remaining headlight stutters and goes out
Bernice pulls off the road
Shit
He flicks the headlight switch, but to no avail
Then, in the distance, he sees a car approaching
Stanley can be glimpsed in the driving seat as the car flashes past
(') Shit
Shitshitshit
Bernice rejoins the road and drives slowly off into the darkness after Stanley
Phil is motionless, and Larry peers out into the darkness as the car limps on, lit only from the light of the moon
Larry sees a glow in the distance ahead, and drives towards a neon sign; 'Welcome to the Joshua Tree Inn'
82
: He stops by the entrance to the inn and stares at Stanley's car parked in the bay outside room 8
He glances across at Phil, turns the car around and drives in
Bernice glides to a stop in the bay next to Stanley's car
Larry gets out and looks around
After a moment, he walks over to the door of room eight and knocks
8 - tired-looking Stanley opens the door
Yeah
Hi
Hello
They stare at each other
Um
'm one of the guys that took your son
After a moment, Stanley steps back and opens the door
You'd better come in
/  - car drives past the inn and then brakes sharply and skids across the road
It reverses and pulls in, parking next to the hearse
Barbara and Susie get out and look around
Then Susie walks over to the hearse's passenger window and raps on the glass, and Barbara marches to the back of the hearse and attempts to open it
She can't
Where's the catch on this piece of shit
Susie notices Phil, slumped in the seat
Phil
Phil
83
- Phil comes to
He looks out of the window at Susie, then at the 'Joshua Tree' sign, then at the door to room eight, then round to the back of the shaking hearse as Barbara tries to get the door open
His jaw drops open and he rubs his eyes again, before getting out of the car
8 - Phil stands in front of Susie
What happened to your head
He touches his head and looks at the blood on his fingers
His handcuff hangs from his wrist and Susie stares at it
hippie hit it
thought you'd gone
Hold that thought
What the hell does that mean
need to know what it is you're doing
Barbara shouts from the back of the car
told you what he's doing
He's going to set fire to my Gram in some freaky ceremony with witches and black magic and
dolls
Dolls
Dolls to stick pins in
What the hell are you talking about
(shouts) want my man back
Enough of this shit
84
: Phil walks over to the door of room 8
(') They've gotta be in here
It's fate
He opens the door and walks in
-  8 Larry and Stanley are sitting on the bed
Phil shoots a vicious look at Larry
Whatever happened to peace, love and understanding, hippie
You're Kaufman
Yup
Stanley folds his arms
Susie and Barbara follow Phil into the room
And you are
'm with him
She indicates Phil
Hello Stanley
Remember me
The psychotic girlfriend
Hello Barbara
Nothing wrong with your memory
He turns to Phil
(') Did you sell tickets or something
Now, you boys want to tell me why you stole my son
Well,  didn't even know he was in the box
85
: 'm going to cremate him, here in the desert where he felt most at home
That's what he wanted
The hell you are, Kaufman
Stanley picks up the phone and starts to dial
You know  can't let you do that
know you have to
Stanley smashes the receiver down onto the table
Everyone jumps
don't have to do anything, Mister Kaufman
This is  loss
This was  son
How dare you try to take my grief away from me
It's too late to claim him now
What the hell does that mean
They are almost nose-to-nose now
It means that you were never there when it mattered to Gram
It means that you stopped being a father the moment he stopped doing your bidding
It means that you learned to care too late
That's what it means
don't have to justify my relationship with Gram to you
Not to me, no
Stanley sits down
It's true that when Gram left college, we drifted apart
( ) 86
: (2) (') He was a disappointment to me, because he wouldn't use his brain
He had so much to offer, but he let it trickle away
No - he gave it his all, but in a way you could never understand
And all he ever wanted from you was approval
He wanted you to be proud of what he had achieved
kept everything
Every record, every article, every photo
It's no good telling me
You should have told him
loved him
Too late
Stanley looks up at Phil
understand that you were his right-hand man, as well as his friend
was both, yes
And that you weren't there when he died
When he needed you most
beat, then: Yes
That's right
So the guilt isn't all mine, then
guess not
Susie walks over and takes Phil's hand
Stanley says nothing for a moment, but his eyes fill with tears
87
: (3) You boys took away my son lost him once in life, and now you're trying to take him from me again
He starts to cry
Larry shoots an imploring look at Phil
Barbara glances around the room
Can we just cut through this
She gestures at Phil and Larry
(') You two stole the body
Theft
Indicates Susie
(') Sweetie, 'm sorry, but you seem to be in the whole thing up to your neck
Accessory
Waves a hand at Stanley
(') And you are an old fool who should have called the police, but hasn't
Stupidity
She walks over to the phone
(') Now, let's just call the cops and get it done
The sooner we get us a death certificate and bury him, the sooner his soul will be properly laid to rest
Phil walks over to Barbara, picks her up and carries her into the bathroom
(') Hey
What the hell are you doing
He emerges and slips the back of a chair under the handle, effectively locking the door
Son, you had your chance to look after Gram, and now he's dead
There is a 'bang' from the bathroom, and the door shakes
88
: (4) (
) Bastard
only failed because  couldn't save him from himself
You failed him all his life
You never believed
never doubted
Stanley pauses
Okay
You tell me why  should let you take my boy
was his road manager and his friend
We loved it out here in the desert, and we made a pact that whoever died first, the other would come down here and set them free
Gram gave his word and  gave mine
Stanley thinks about this
You're a couple of druggies
Why should  believe you
Phil doesn't like the inference
don't take drugs
Another 'bang' from the bathroom
Stanley turns to Larry
What about you
Are you a druggie
There is a long pause
Then: Yes
Yes  am
Phil closes his eyes
Stanley picks up the receiver and starts to dial
Then Phil jumps up off the bed and walks out of the room
After a moment, Larry and Susie follow
8 - Phil is waiting by the car
89
: (to Larry) Nice work
Let's go
Larry gives Phil the screwdriver
can't do this
This isn't right
Larry walks away leaving Phil with Susie
He looks at her
Just do whatever feels right to you
God damn
After a moment, Phil walks back into room eight
-  8 Stanley is sitting on the bed, the receiver in his hand
Phil sits facing him
Did you call them
No
Are you going to call them
Well, you haven't given me a reason not to
There is another 'crash' from inside the bathroom
The door shakes
There isn't a reason
If someone tried to steal my son's body, 'd stop them
For sure
Larry and Susie quietly enter the room
So you are prepared to go to jail
'm expecting to
90
: (
) Don't you worry - it's gonna happen
Mister Parsons
Phil and Stanley look up
What is it, son
've been a junkie for over four years
started taking heroin on June 5th 1969 at a concert in Indiana
You don't need
Larry holds his hand up to stop Stanley
've taken heroin, speed, uppers, downers, blues, morphine, methadone, mushrooms, quaaludes, acid, valium, barbiturates, straight , marijuana, marijuana laced with opium, nembutal, mescalin of course, and medical methaqualone, which made me shake uncontrollably for six weeks and vomit every hour
(dryly) That's very impressive, son
Not my point
Better make the point
started working my way through that list on June 5th 1969, and since then there hasn't been a day when  didn't at least smoke one joint
Phil shoots Larry a dangerous look
91
: (2) Are we sure that this is helping
Larry ignores him
And now 've stopped
stopped because it seems that  had something more important to do
They all look at him
He gestures at Phil
(') He's doing this because he gave his word
'm prepared to do this now because  think it's right
And because  believe that each body has a soul
And Gram's soul doesn't belong in a family plot surrounded by strangers
It belongs here, where he was happiest
In the silence, Susie walks over and grips Phil's hand
Then Stanley gets up off the bed
'm going to go say goodbye to my son
Everyone looks surprised
Phil gives Larry a look of appreciative approval
Barbara starts to kick furiously at the door from inside the bathroom
Stanley pauses for a moment, and then walks outside
Phil and Larry watch him go, and Susie walks over to kiss Phil
What's that for
That's for failing to reinforce my expectations
Well
'll have to do that more often
The three of them move to the door, and Phil turns to Larry
(') Did you really take all those drugs
Of course not
92
: (3) He grins at Phil
(') may have got a little carried away
The door of the bathroom shakes and one of the hinges flies across the room
'mon, time to go
8 Phil, Larry and Susie leave room eight
They look around with surprise, but there is no sign of Stanley
Phil opens the back of the hearse and takes a quick peek inside the casket
Just checking
Yeah, he took the body and stuffed it in the trunk of his car before escaping into the night
Larry is already behind the wheel
Phil opens the car door and looks at Susie
Are you coming
She smiles at him
reckon  am
She gets in
There is a final, almighty 'crash' from inside room eight
The three of them look at each other, and then Bernice is gone into the darkness
moment later Barbara runs outside
She leaps into her car and screeches after them
In the distance a blue flashing police light suddenly materializes
' Barbara is on the road, driving fast
Suddenly a blue flashing police light fills her mirror
Thank God
She pulls over and the police cruiser pulls in behind her
The traffic cop walks up and looks through the window
93
: Evenin' ma'am
Barbara gives it everything
Please help me, they've got my boyfriend's corpse and they're going to perform a ritual with his body
The cop turns on his torch and peers at her carefully
May  see your driving license please, ma'am
My driving license
Please
've just told you that they've stolen a body and you want to see my driving license
He just stares at her
Barbara is losing it
(') You people are supposed to be on the lookout for a hearse hearse is a big long car
You can usually tell which ones are the hearses, because they have coffins in the back
The one we're looking for is painted yellow
Does this look like a yellow hearse to you, asshole
Long pause
Barbara realizes that she might have gone too far
He starts to write a ticket
(') Is that a ticket
Are you writing me a ticket
Yes it is, ma'am
And yes  am
Phil indicates an area just off the road
94
: Cap Rock
This is perfect
Really peaceful
Larry pulls the hearse over near the rock
They all sit there for a moment
Phil and Larry look at each other
Phil opens the back of the hearse and slides the casket out of the car
He notices that Larry has made no move to help
Susie sits on a rock and watches
You wanna give me a hand here
Larry walks over and grabs the other end of the casket
They walk it away from the car and lay it down
As they lower it, the coffin slips out of Phil's hands and bangs down in the sand
(') Sorry, Gram
They stand and stare at the casket
Susie walks over with the guitar and takes Phil's hand
What now
Now we
do it
He gets the gasoline can from the car and stands over the casket
(') Take the top off
Why
Flesh burns easier than wood
can't believe you just said that
'm not taking the top off
He walks off
Phil puts the can down and removes the top of the casket
He peers inside
95
: (to Gram) Hey, man
Looking a little peaky
Some decorum would be nice
Right
He pours some gasoline into the casket
(') Do you think that's enough
Against his better judgment, Larry walks over and peers inside
Well,  don't know
Maybe a little more
Phil pours a little more fuel in
He looks over at Susie
Enough
'm not having a conversation with you about how much gasoline you need to burn a body
She backs off
think that'll do it
Phil stops pouring and shakes the can
Only a little left
He pours the rest of the can into the casket
Susie walks over to stand next to Phil
He looks down at Gram
(') 'm sorry  wasn't there for you when it mattered, but  was there before, and 've been there ever since
Gram, good luck to you, wherever you are
They all stare at the casket
Phil wipes a tear away and tucks a can of beer into the coffin
96
: (2) (') That's my last one, man
He rests Gram's guitar against the casket, takes big puffs on his cigar to get the flame up, then tosses it into the coffin
They wait
Nothing happens
Phil edges nearer and looks inside
Then the coffin explodes into flames
All three of them are thrown backwards by the blast
The traffic cop is finishing the ticket when there is a ball of flame in the distance
Barbara just scowls
Jesus
What the hell's that
That'll be Gram Parsons, on fire
Get in the car, ma'am
Now
Phil, Larry and Susie pick themselves up
They stare at the pyre
Phil is close to tears, and Susie puts her arm around him
For a moment, Phil thinks he sees the flames morph into the shape of an angel over the burning coffin
The image disappears when Larry speaks
Maybe too much fuel
Nah,  just didn't factor in the booze inside of him
Gram always
He breaks off as a flashing police light appears in the darkness, followed by a siren
(') think our work here is done
Larry and Susie run to the car
Phil lingers a moment, looking down at the flames
Then he follows the others
Phil jumps into the car
Go
97
: The huge car screeches off into the darkness, with no lights
Stanley watches as the hearse flies past him
He glances back at the fire, smiles sadly, and bows his head for a moment
Then he turns on the ignition and drives away into the darkness
The police car arrives at the scene
Barbara and the cop get out
He peers into the flames
How do you know it's your boyfriend
(sarcastically) recognize that birthmark on his shoulder
Look, can  make an observation
Be my guest
We're in the desert
It is dark
If you want to catch someone in the dark, it's best not to turn on big flashing lights and make a loud noise with a siren
Do you want to know what  think, ma'am
No
But 'm really, really keen to find out
The traffic cop stares into the fire
think it was suicide
He just wanted to get away from you
Phil is fast asleep and snoring in Bernice's passenger seat
He wakes slowly and shields his eyes from the bright sunshine that pours through the windscreen
He pulls a flask out of the glove compartment and takes a long gargle, spitting the result out of the window
98
: Then he glances in the rear view mirror and sees the man sitting in the casket bay
Sure is hot
Hello, Gram
Phil
Gram pulls himself along the bay and onto the back seat
He then climbs into the front, settles next to Phil and holds his hand out for the flask
Do you think you should
Not gonna hurt me now, is it
He takes a drink and looks around
(') Nice wheels
Very stylish
They're very handy for transporting dead people around
Nothing better
am dead, then
You're more than dead, Gram
You and the box are down to bones and brass
Oh, well
Here's mud in your eye
He takes another drink and hands the flask back to Phil
What can  do for you, Gram
You assume  want something
Well, you're here
And seeing as just burned you to a cinder, you shouldn't be
( ) 99
: (2) (') So 'm guessing you've got some kind of reason
Well, okay
just wanted to say thanks
What for
Doing the thing that we agreed, keeping your word, keeping them all away
Well, that's okay, Gram
But don't need thanking
You don't
'm just taking care of business
That's what you paid me for - that's what  do
Gram grins
You shooting for a raise
Actually,  just quit
Gram holds his hand out for the bottle and takes a drink
Well,  s'pose  should be getting along
Goodbye, Gram
'm glad it all worked out
What
said 'm glad it all worked out
And Gram is now Larry, peering down at Phil
All what worked out
100
: (3) Phil sits bolt upright and looks around the car
Larry and Susie stare back at him
Doesn't matter
Can we go now
'm getting sick of sand
We hear Gram's: 'Return Of The Grievous Angel' or some similar music
We follow Bernice as she drives through the desert, and into Los Angeles
We follow her through the city streets, and we stay with her as she parks
Fade down music
Phil turns off the ignition and sits back in his seat
He and Larry look at each other
Well, we did it
We saved a soul
He leans across to hug Phil, who looks awkward and pats him on the shoulder instead
Singed my damn mustache, that's for sure
Phil pulls a cigar out of his pocket and lights it
The handcuff dangles from his wrist and bangs against the dash
He stares at the match as it burns
Well, shall we
Phil blows the match out
Yeah
Let's roll, hippie
They all get out of the car
Phil turns to Susie
Where d'you think you might be when 'm done
101
: 'll be waiting
Yeah, but where
There is a small moment of tension, before Phil grins at her
They kiss
Get out of here
Finish it
Phil pats Bernice's battered wing as he walks away and over to where Larry is waiting
They cross the road and walk into a building through heavy wooden doors
Pull back to reveal a sign: 'Los Angeles Police Department'
: Phil Kaufman and Larry Osterberg appeared in West
Municipal Court on November 5, 1973 - Gram Parsons's 27th birthday
Since a corpse has no intrinsic value, the two were charged with misdemeanor theft for stealing the coffin and given a token punishment: $708 in damages for the coffin, and a $300 fine for each of the bodysnatchers
