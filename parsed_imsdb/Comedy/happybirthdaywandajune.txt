Animal eyes begin to glow in the darkness
Sounds of the jungle climax in animals fighting
is heard singing the first bars of "All God's Chillun Got Shoes
"  , , , and stand in a row in the darkness, facing the audience
They are motionless
city skyline in the early evening materializes outside the windows
The lights come up on the living room of a rich man's apartment, which is densely furnished with trophies of hunts and wars
There is a front door, a door to the master bedroom suite, and a corridor leading to other bedrooms, the kitchen and so on
How do you do
My name is Penelope Ryan
This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't
am Harold Ryan, her husband have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier
have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport
am Dr
Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer
find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society
Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed
(to ) Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel
(embarrassed) Jesus-- dunno
You know
What the heck
Who knows
Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash
dunno, boy
You don't know
It was a bitch
Thank you
(to all) You can leave now
We'll begin
(to the audience, making a peace sign) Peace
All but  exit
(to the audience) This is a tragedy
When it's done, my face will be as white as the snows of Kilimanjaro
(hyena laughs) My husband, who kills so much, has been missing for eight years
He disappeared in a light plane over the Amazon Rain Forest, where he hoped to find diamonds as big as cantaloupes
His pilot was Colonel Looseleaf Harper, who dropped the bomb on Nagasaki
(hyena laughs) should explain the doorbells in this apartment
They were built by Abercrombie and Fitch
They are actual recordings of animal cries
The back doorbell is a hyena, which you've just heard
The front doorbell is a lion's roar
(to the wings) Would you let them hear it please
(lion roars) Thank you
, her twelve-year-old son, enters from corridor, a sensitive, neatly dressed little rich boys
And this is my son, Paul
He was only four years old when his father disappeared
(radiantly, sappily) He's coming back, Mom
He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived
(to audience) told you this was a simple-minded play
Maybe he'll come back tonight
It's his birthday
know
Stay home tonight
(ruefully, for they have been over this before) Oh, Paul-- You're married
You've already got a husband
He's a ghost
He's alive
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad
(sick) Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks
(resentfully) Thank you, kind sir
vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor
what kind of doctor
fairy--a queer
Everybody in the building knows he's a queer
(knowing better) That's an interesting piece of news
You're the only woman he ever took out
Not true
Still lives with his mother
You know she has no feet
You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet
How did she lose her feet
In a railroad accident many years ago
was afraid to ask
Norbert was just beginning practice
real man would have sold her to a catfood company,  suppose
As far as that goes,
Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother
didn't know that
lot of people don't
Edgar Hoover plays sports
don't really know
To only exercise Dr
Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign
(makes the peace sign and says the word effeminately) Peace
Peace
Peace, everybody
Lion doorbell roars
(cringing) hate that thing
It's beautiful
He goes to door, admits , whom he loathes openly
(wearing street clothes, carrying a rolled-up poster under his arm) Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope
You're taking Mom out tonight
(to ) You're going out
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight
Take plenty of cigars
(an apology, secret from ) We made the date three months ago
must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night
That's also fun
came to see Selma, as a matter of fact
She quit this afternoon
We don't have a maid any more
Oh
The animals made her sneeze and cry too much
'm glad somebody finally cried
Every time  come in here and see all this unnecessary death,  want to cry
(winking at , acknowledging 's low opinion of him) don't cry, of course
Not manly, you know
Did she try antihistamines
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work
Throw out all this junk
Burn it
This room crawls with tropical disease
Everything stays as it is
monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat
(hotly) My father
apologize
But you didn't know him, and neither did
How's your asthma
Don't worry about it
How's the fungus around your thumbnail
(concealing the thumb) It's fine
It's jungle rot
This room is making everybody sick
This is your family doctor speaking now
(unrolling the poster) Here-- brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety
(reading) "War is not healthy for children and other living things
" How lovely
No doubt Paul thinks it stinks
Lion doorbell roars
hate that thing
(going to the door) Keeps fairies away
He admits  , who carries an Electrolux vacuum cleaner
(to affectionately, touching him) Hi kid
(seeing ) Would you look what the car dragged in
'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner
Is that a fact
That maid just quit
The place is a mess
You can start in the master bedroom
Please-- He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom
'll get ready, Herb
didn't expect you this soon
(to all) Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while 'm gone
All freeze, except for , who comes forward to address the audience
Lights on set fade as spotlight comes on
Most men shunned me--even when nearly swooned for want of love might as well have been girdled in a chastity belt
My chastity belt was not made of iron and chains and chickenwire, but of Harold's lethal reputation
comes into the spotlight
keep having this nightmare--that he catches us
Doing what
He'd kill me
He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is
Or was
We haven't done anything wrong, you know
He'd assume we had
That's something  suppose
All through the day 'm so confident
That's why 'm such a good salesman, you know
have confidence, and  look like  have confidence, and that gives other people confidence
People laugh sometimes when they find out 'm a vacuum cleaner salesman
They stop laughing, though, when they find out  made forty-three thousand dollars last year
've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence
That's what charges them up
'm glad
was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University
know
If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh
If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt
don't want to go to Vanderbilt
You don't wrestle if you don't have supreme confidence, and  wrestled
But when  get with you, and  say to myself, "My God--here  am with the wife of Harold Ryan, one of the great heroes of all time--" Pause
Yes
Something happens to my confidence
(to the audience) This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when  don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong
'm going to ask you to be my wife
'm touched
That's when 'll get my confidence back
see
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly
Good night
Good night
Blackout
and  argue in pitch darkness, with listening, and lights come up gradually to full on the living room the same evening
You've got to fight from time to time
Not true
Or get eaten alive
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true
Phooey
Which we do
But we can stop doing that
The lights are full
and  are bored with each other,  looks out the window, speaks to an imaginary listener who has more brains than
hates them both, but prefers 's noisy manliness
We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive
(calling) Penelope
We're late
(off, in master bedroom suite) Coming
(to ) Women are always late
You'll find out
(thoughtfully) The late Mrs
Harold Ryan
'm sick of this argument
just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does
That's the only way you can have a country
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists
Speak for yourself
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device
Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind
You can believe that if you want
talk to guys like you, and  want to commit suicide
(to ) You get that weight-lifting set sent you
It came yesterday
haven't opened it yet
(musingly, attempting to find the idea acceptable, even funny, in a way) Maybe it's supposed to end now
Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way
(to ) Start with the smallest weights
Every week add a pound or two
Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends
Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends
They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows
Or recruiting Marines
(to ) You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day
He died of a massive rupture
You think you're so funny
You're not even funny
(to ) Right
Right
You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow
You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque
(to ) Take care of your body, yes
But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes
Don't become obsessed by your musculature
Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be
Their magic was in their muscles
Your magic is in your brains
enters from the bedroom, dressed for the fight
She wears barbaric jewelry  gave her years ago, a jaguar-skin coat over her shoulders
(brightly) Gentlemen
Is this right for a fight
It's been so long
Beautiful
've never seen that coat
Seven jaguars' skins, 'm told
Harold shot every one
Shall we go
(sick about the slain jaguars) Oh no
Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool
What
Wear a coat of domestic mink
For the love of God, though, Penelope, don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you
She's my date tonight
What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump
Bugger off
Ask Paul what he thinks
(to ) Your mother looks beautiful--right
( pointedly declines to answer) Kid
( walks away from him) Doesn't your mother look nice
(he goes to , wondering what is wrong) Paul
(smolderingly) don't care what she wears
Something's made you sore
Don't worry about it
You bet 'll worry about it said something wrong
(close to angry tears) It's my father's birthday--that's all
(facing everybody, raising his voice) That's all
Who cares about that
(horrified, raising his hand to swear an oath) had not the slightest inkling
(to , feeling betrayed) Why didn't you say so
(bitterly) She doesn't care
She's not married any more
She's going to have fun
(to ) hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it
(to ) Dr
Woodly-- hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far
(reaching out for ) Kid--kid-- (to ) And  wish you'd quit touching me all the time
It drives me nuts
(reaching out again) What's this
(recoiling) Don't
(aghast) You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight
Explain it to them
'm bugging out of here
He grabs a jacket from a chair
is in his way
Don't touch me
Get out of the way
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing
Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl
(to ) Where will you be
Anywhere but here
'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten
worship your father
That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot
It's the proudest thing in my apartment
(at the door) Everybody talks about how rotten kids act
Grownups can be pretty rotten, too
He exits through front door, slams it
(heartbroken) Kid--kid-- It's good
Let him go
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way  asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around
'm going to go get him-- Don't
Let him have all the privacy he wants
Let him grieve, let him rage
There has never been a funeral for his father
never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say
Tonight's the night
If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire-- What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage
feel like 've been double- crossed
(to , peevishly) If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday-- What then
We could have had some kind of birthday party for him
We could have taken Paul to the fight with us
Minors aren't allowed at fights
Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks
've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat
(going to the front door) 'm going to bring that boy back
He exits through front door
(going to ) This is very good for us
It is
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow
As long as he keeps out of the park
After this explosion,  think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again
The only thing  ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down
" We've got to dump Shuttle
(pointing to the vacuum cleaner) He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates
That's the
The what
It's an experimental model
He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition
What kind of a life is that
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was
He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old
(clinging to him suddenly) Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park
(pause) If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty
(petrified) No
Oh no
Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks
The police won't even go in there any more
wish Paul luck
It's suicide
'd be dead by now if that were the case
Meaning
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, 've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight
Why would you do that
To show myself how brave  am
The issue's in doubt, you know--since 'm always for peace-- 'm amazed
Me, too
know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight
Nothing
Or, when 'm in there, there's me in there
Fear and nobody and me
And maybe Paul
What about the murderers
They're in there
They didn't murder me
Paul's only twelve years old
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound
We've got to rescue him
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that
He's not your son
No
But he's going to be
If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side,  can say to him, "You and  are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight
" (pause) On that we can build
It's a jungle out there
That's been said before
He'd go to a movie
think that's what he'd do
If  were sure he was in a movie,  could stop worrying
We could have him paged
Lion doorbell roars
hate that thing
He opens the door, admits , who carries a bakery box
Did you see him
Yeah
Is he all right
Far as  know
Is he coming home
He ditched me
He started running, and  started running, then he lost me in the park
The park
It's dark in there
And that's where he is
figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another
(disgusted with him) You figure
Then  saw this bakery store that was still open, so  bought a birthday cake
what
For Harold
When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake
How nice
They had this cake somebody else hadn't picked up
It says, "Happy Birthday, Somebody Else
" "Happy Birthday, Wanda June
" We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife
Did you talk to Paul
Before he started to run
He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door
We've got to find him
(preparing to exit through front door) want you to show me exactly where you saw him last
(to ) And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home
(to ) That's all he said--the thing about the key
He said one other thing
It wasn't very nice
What was it
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon
Blackout
Lights come up on living room
is alone, asleep on the couch
lets himself and  in through the front door--quietly
has a full beard and a paunch
is skinnier
He has a handlebar moustache
Both wear new sports clothes and smoke expensive cigars is calm
is nervous, confused
They prowl the room cautiously, checking this and that
awakens by playing with his feet
(startled) Ooops
(to , very amused) Ooops
Can --uh--help you gentlemen
(moving downstage, feeling at home) Gentlemen--that's nice
(to ) You startled me
Yeah
We just got here
thought you might be burglars-- but you're not,  hope
Nope
(idiotically, incapable of deception) got a lot of stuff
(looking at him closely) You do
The door ws unlocked
Is it always unlocked
It's always locked
But here you are inside, aren't you
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan
We tried to be
We tried to be
He's dead, you know
Dead
Such a final word
Dead
(to ) Did you hear that
Yup
Telephone rings
answers, keeping his eyes on the bizarre guests
Hello
Oh--hello, Mother
(to ) Hello, Mother
Who
Did she say how far apart the pains were
When was that
Oh dear
Oh dear
Call her back--tell her to head for the hospital
Tell the hospital to expect her
'll leave right now
He hangs up, faces the intruders
Look--'m sorry-- have to go
We'll miss you so
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here
Mrs
Ryan won't be home for a while
Oh, oh, oh-- thought it was your apartment
You seemed at home here
'm a neighbor
have the apartment across the hall
have to go to the hospital now
An emergency
is unstirred
mean-- can't leave you here
You'll have to go
'll tell Mrs
Ryan you were here
You can come back later
Ahh--then she's still alive
She's fine
Please-- And still Mrs
Harold Ryan
Will you please go
An emergency
She still has just the one child-- the boy
He moves slowly toward the front door, with  trying to hustle him and  out
Yes
Yes
The boy
One boy
(stopping) And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs
Ryan
Neighbor
Doctor
live across the hall
And you come into Mrs
Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters
Yes
Please
You've got to get out right now
moves a little more, stops again
Just her neighbor and doctor
That's all
(at the end of his patience, blurting) And her fiance
(delighted) And her fiance
How nice
hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman
've got to run
He turns out the overhead light
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is
That's how it goes
(holding open the front door) 've literally got to run
won't try to keep up with you
'm not as fast on my feet as once was
All three exit
moment later,  lets himself and in again with a key
He turns on the light again, roams the room, reacquainting himself with his beloved trophies
is jangled by the adventure chucks a lioness under her chin
Miss me, baby
dunno, boy
Hm
It's a bitch
(quietly) bitch
Didn't recognize you
We've never met
wonder who'll recognize us first
They'll wet their pants
hope the men do
would rather the women didn't
'm gonna wet my pants
He laughs idiotically
(looking around himself) Home, sweet home
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap
bet Alice threw out all my crap after 'd been gone a week
We'll see
, who wants to savor the early moments of his homecoming alone, now tries to get the very jumpy out of the apartment
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel
Why don't you run on home while the evening's young
Home
Jesus
(makes his hands tremble) 'm like this
Home
Home is important to a man
You know what gets me
(absently) No
How all the magazines show tits today
Um
Used to be against the law, didn't it
(fed up with ) suppose
(making no move to leave) Must have changed that law
Silence, while  attempts to be alone, even though is still present
(thoughtfully hefting a broadsword, admiring its balance and strength) Home
You know what gets me
does not respond
You know what gets me
(to himself) Oh, shit
(finding enough encouragement in this) How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time
used to be scared shitless 'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident
Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time
Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country
(flatly) Looseleaf--will you get the hell home
At least we found the diamonds
At least
'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home
It's enough that you've brought yourself home
wish you'd tell Alice that
And that Goddamn Mrs
Wheeler
(hotly) Tell them yourself
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy
After eight years in the jungle with you,  know Mrs
Wheeler better than  know anybody in the universe
didn't tell you everything
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs
Wheeler
didn't even scratch the surface
You're lucky, boy
You come home, and nobody's here
When  go home, everybody's going to be there
This room is full of ghosts
You're lucky, boy
My house is gonna be filled with people
ignores this, attempts to savor the ghosts in the room
You know what gets me
Go home
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds
The hell with the diamonds
You were rich before
This is the first time  was ever rich
Go home
Show them how rich you are for a change
Can  have the Cadillac
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all  care
What'll you do for transportation
'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs
Go home
You know what gets me about that Cadillac
Go home
When  drive it,  feel like 'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum
don't hear anything, don't feel anything
figure somebody else is driving
It's a bitch
Go home
'm liable to find anything
That's the point
Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up
know,  know
dunno
At least she's in the same house
Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was
So long, Colonel
You know what gets me
(taking hold of and steering him to the front door) Let's talk about it some other time
How short the skirts are
(opening the door) Good night, Colonel
It's been beautiful
Something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone
shoves him out of the apartment and shuts the door
starts to roam the room again, but the lion doorbell roars
(going to the door) Hell
opens the door
comes in
You know what gets me
Those guys who went to the moon
To the moon, boy
Leave me alone
After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part
crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood
You and may not meet again for months
Months
'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and  will not welcome your horning back into mine chapter has ended
We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways
(bleakly, shrugging) 'm lonesome already
He exits
(roaming the room again) The moon
The new heroism--put a village idiot into a pressure cooker, seal it up tight, and shoot him at the moon
(to his portrait) Hello there, young man
In case you're wondering,  could beat the shit out of you
And any woman choosing between us--sorry, kid, she'd choose me
(pleased with the room) must say, this room is very much as  left it
(sees the cake) What's this
cake
"Happy Birthday, Wanda June"
Who the hell is Wanda June
Blackout
indicates happiness, innocence, and weightlessness
Spotlight comes up on  , a lisping eight-year-old in a starched party dress
She is as cute as Shirley Temple
Hello
am Wanda June
Today was going to be my birthday, but  was hit by an ice-cream truck before could have my party
am dead now
am in Heaven
That is why my parents did not pick up the cake at the bakery
am not mad at the ice-cream truck driver, even though he was drunk when he hit me
It didn't hurt much
It wasn't even as bad as the sting of a bumblebee
am really happy here
It's so much fun am glad the driver was drunk
If he hadn't been,  might not have got to Heaven for years and years and years
would have had to go to high school first, and then beauty college
would have had to get married and have babies and everything
Now  can just play and play and play
Any time  want any pink cotton candy  can have some
Everybody up here is happy-- the animals and the dead soldiers and people who went to the electric chair and everything
They're all glad for whatever sent them here
Nobody is mad
We're all too busy playing shuffleboard
So if you think of killing somebody, don't worry about it
Just go ahead and do it
Whoever you do it to should kiss you for doing it
The soldiers up here just love the shrapnel and the tanks and the bayonets and the dum dums that let them play shuffleboard all the time--and drink beer
Spotlight begins to dim and carnival music on a steam calliope begins to intrude, until, at the end of the speech, is drowned out and the stage is black
We have merry-go-rounds that don't cost anything to ride on
We have Ferris wheels
We have Little League and girls' basketball
There's a drum and bugle corps anybody can join
For people who like golf, there is a par-three golf course and a driving range, with never any waiting
If you just want to sit and loaf, why that's all right, too
Gourmet specialties are cooked to your order and served at any time of night or day
Sudden silence
Ha ha ha ha ha
(pistol shot) You got me, pal
Silence
Spotlight comes up on  , who wears the clothes he will wear in the next scene--new sports clothes, a shirt open at the neck
As always, he is friendly and embarrassed
When Penelope asked me to say something about dropping the bomb on Nagasaki,  didn't give a very good answer,  guess
It's a very complicated question
Jesus--you know
You have to explain what it's like to be in the Air Force and how they give you your orders and all that
What it feels like to be in a plane, what the world looks like down there
After  got home from the war, the minister of my church asked me if  would speak to a scout troop that met in the church basement
So  did
They met on Thursday nights
used to belong to that troop
never made Eagle Scout
But you know something
It's a very strange kind of kid that makes Eagle Scout
They always seem so lonesome, like they'd worked real hard to get a job nobody else cares about
They get a whole bunch of merit badges
That's how you get to be an Eagle Scout
don't think  had over five or six merit badges
The only one  remember is Public Health
That was a bitch
The Boy Scout Manual said  was supposed to find out what my town did about sewage
Jesus, they just dumped it all in Sugar Creek
(laughs idiotically) Sugar Creek
That was a long time ago, but it's all coming back to me now
There was another merit badge you could get for roller skating
There used to be a roller rink at a bend in Sugar Creek, up above where the sewage went in
got in a fight there one time
had on roller skates, and the guy  was fighting had on basketball shoes
He had a tremendous advantage over me
He was a little guy, but he beat the shit out of me
had to laugh like hell
Don't ever fight a guy when you've got on roller skates
(silence) Jesus-- remember my mother used to make me chew bananas for a full minute before  swallowed--so wouldn't get sick
Makes you wonder what else your parents told you that wasn't true
Blackout
comes up on
He sits on the front seat of an imaginary car
The seat is covered with zebra skin
The night  met Penelope,  had no beard--so imagine me, if you can, without a beard
Actually, wasn't as good-looking then as  am now
And, if anything, me health has improved
At any rate-- had just come home from Kenya--to discover that my third wife, Mildred, like the two before her, had become a drunken bum
In my experience, alcoholism is far more prevalent among women than men
So got into my automobile-- He pantomimes turning the ignition key
The sound of a starter and a powerful engine responds
He pantomimes putting the car in gear and driving away from the curb
Appropriate sounds are heard
drive through the night, until was attracted by a sign which said-- Spotlight comes up on , who wears a skimpy carhop outfit she has had on under her coat in the previous scene
"Hamburger Heaven
" Heaven
pantomimes swerving into Hamburger Heaven
Tires squeal
He pantomimes a stop, kills the engine
He blows his imaginary horn
real horn blows the bugle call for "charge
"  crosses to
Can  help you, sir
think so, daughter
How old are you
Eighteen-- (pause) and a half
springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle
Sir
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion
want to eat the onion like an apple
Do you understand
Yes, sir
(to the audience) It was a very unusual automobile
It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be
(to ) And what to drink
What time do you get off work, my child
'm sorry, sir, 'm engaged to be married
My boyfriend would be mad if  went out with another man
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire
'm engaged
Daughter-- love you very much
You don't even know me
You are woman
know woman well
This is crazy
Destiny often seems that way
You're going to marry me
What do you do for a living
My parents died in an automobile accident when  was sixteen years old
They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things live for a living
've just come back from Kenya--in Africa
've been hunting Mau Mau there
Some kind of animal
The pelt is black
It's a kind of man
Blackout
rises on empty living room
lets himself in with a key
Mom
(silence) Herb
(silence) Dr
Woodly
(advances into room uneasily) Hello
(sees the cake) cake
Who's Wanda June
enters quietly from the kitchen, holding a can of beer
Anybody home
As a matter of fact-- (nearly jumping out of his skin) Sir
As a matter of fact-- am home
(thinking  may be a burglar) Hello
(simply) Hello
Are you-- His voice fails him
(hoping to be recognized) You were about to ask a question
Are you--do you-- Ask it
(blurting) Do you know who Wanda June is
Life has denied me that thrill
Do you mind if  ask who you are
Mind
(aside) God, yes,  mind
(to ) 'm your father's friend
man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago
Dr
Woodly
Dr
Woodly
should make a little list
Is anybody besides you here now
The doctor was called away on an emergency
think it was birth
Where's Mom
You don't know where your mother is
Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle,  guess
You think you could find me a pencil and paper
'll see
He rummages through a drawer
And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where
was going to a funny movie, but changed my mind
If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much
(gives  pencil and paper) When did you know my father
Man and boy
Everybody says he was so brave
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said
He worships Father
(pleased) Ah
And what sort of man is this worshiper
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman
(deflated) see
(recovering) And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille-- She met him at college
(startled) College
They were in the same creative writing class
College
She has a master's degree in English literature
What a pity
Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch
Everything stops
(pause) And the doctor
He worships your father, too
He insults him all the time
(delighted) Excellent
What's good about that
It makes life spicy
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother
(indicating 's portrait) You know what he called Father one time
No
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy
" (measuring his opponent) What does he do--of an athletic nature
Nothing
He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet
Aha
He has a brilliant military record, 'm sure
He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War
(pause) Were you in a war with Father
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise
Tell me some true stories about Dad
(unused to the word) "Dad
" (accepting it) Dad
(to himself) The boy wants tales of derring-do
Name a country
England
(disgusted) Oh hell
Dad was never in England
Behind a desk for a little while
(contemptuously) desk
They had him planning air raids
city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan
There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself
Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade
He was a famous sniper
They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting
" (echoing wonderingly) "The sting
" As in "Death, where is thy sting
" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more
(slightly dismayed at such murderousness) "The sting
" Ask about the time he and  were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis
Tell me that
saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand
(his excitement rising) Tell me that
Tell me that
Hid by day--fought by night
At sunset one day, your father and , peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn
It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car
Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia
Wow
We blacked our hands and faces
At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village
The name of the village was Mhravitch
Remember that name
Mhravitch
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound
(involuntarily) Uck
Don't care for cold steel
knife is worse than a bullet
don't know
The story gets hairier
Should stop
Go on
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane
Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire
Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire
That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards
The face turns a curious shade of avocado
must ask the doctor why that is
At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there
Where did you get the poison
We carried cyanide capsules
We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured
It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time
And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia
The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received
And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America
You,  believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia
" Blackout
Pitch blackness
The sounds of a Nazi rally come up slowly: "Sieg Heil
Sieg Heil
Sieg Heil
"  Spotlight comes up on    , and officer in the dreaded
He is in full ceremonial uniform
The sounds fade
(sadly, resignedly, remembering) Ja ja
Ja ja
(pause) am Major Siegfried von Konigswald
They used to call me "The Beast of Yugoslavia," on account of all the people  had tortured and shot--and hanged
We'd bop 'em on the head
We'd hook 'em up to the electricity
We'd stick 'em with hypodermic syringes full of all kinds of stuff
One time we killed a guy with orange juice
There was a train wreck, and two of the freight cars were loaded with oranges, so we had oceans of orange juice
It was a joke--how much orange juice we had
And we were interrogating a guy one day, and he wouldn't talk, and the next thing  know--somebody's filling up this big syringe with orange juice
(pause) There was a guerrilla war going on
You couldn't tell who was a guerrilla and who wasn't
Even if you got one, it was still a civilian you got
Telling Americans what a guerrilla war is like--that's coals to Newcastle
How do you like that for idiomatic English
"Coals to Newcastle
" (laughs) That Harold Ryan--he says he spoke to me in perfect German
He talks German like my ass chews gum
'm glad to hear the wonderful thing he said before he killed me
sure didn't understand it the first time around
figured he was a Lithuanian or something, which will give you an idea of how wrong you can be
All  knew was he was very proud about something, and he had a machine pistol, and it was aimed at me
The woods were full of all kinds of nuts who were proud of some damn thing or other, and they all had guns
They were always looking for revenge
You find a way to bottle revenge--that's the end of Schnapps und Coca-Cola
(pause) Harold Ryan said he killed maybe two hundred guys
killed a hundred times that many,  bet
That's still peanuts, of course, compared to what that crazy Looseleaf did
Harold and me--we was doing it the hard way
hope the record books will show that
There should be a little star or something by the names of the guys who did it the hard way
(pause) 'm up in Heaven now, like that little Wanda June kid
wasn't hit by no ice-cream truck
Harold Ryan killed me with his bare hands
He was good
My eyes popped out
My tongue stuck out like a red banana
shit in my pants
It was a mess
(pause) When  got up on the day  died, said, "What a beautiful day this is
What a beautiful part of the world
" The whole planet was beautiful
Up here  meet guys from other planets
(laughs) We got some really crazy-looking guys up here
Their planets weren't anywhere near as nice as Earth
They had clouds all the time
They never saw a clear blue sky
They never saw snow
They never saw an ocean
They had some little lakes, but you couldn't go swimming in them
The lakes were acid
You go swimming, you dissolve
We got some guys up here who got shoved in them lakes
They dissolved
(pause) Harold Ryan stopped talking German to me there in Yugoslavia
He switched to English, so  finally got some kind of idea what he was so burned up about
He wanted revenge for the guy we killed with orange juice
don't know how he ever found out about it
There was just three of us there when we did it--me and two regular military doctors
Somebody who cleaned up afterwards must have squealed
If 'd lived through the war, and they tried me for war crimes and all that, 'd have to tell the court, guess, " was only following orders, as a good soldier should
Hitler told me to kill this guy with orange juice
" Blackout
Lights come up on living room
has just finished telling his true war story to
Mhravitch
Remember that name
Mhravitch
The name will live forever
It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia
Mhravitch
When  grow up, 'm going to go to Mhravitch
It's rather a disappointment these days
It isn't there any more
Sir
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground
They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia
To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout
(abruptly) Play lots of contact sports
wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid 'd get hurt
You're supposed to get hurt
Dr
Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football
He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that
They're not engaged
He seems to think they are
He told me that were
Oh no, no, no, no, no
It can't be
How embarrassing
(unexpectedly moved) You're a very good boy to respond that way
No, no, no, no, no
'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if  may
Go ahead
(as  exits) No, no, no, no
and  enter through front door
They are tremendously relieved to see
Thank God
What a relief
(going to ) My baby's safe
angrily avoids her touch
What's the matter now
We got a birthday cake, kid
Did you see the cake
Are you and Dr
Woodly engaged
(stunned) Who have you been talking to
What difference does that make
Is Dr
Woodly going to be my father now
Pause
Yes, he is
(a stifled, gargling cry) Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah
(sick) That goes double for me
don't want to live any more
feel like  want to yell my head off--just yell anything
(yelling) Bulllllllllllllll-dickey
'll kill myself
The wife of Harold Ryan is going to marry a pansy next
This is the end of Western Civilization as far as 'm concerned
You must be crazy as a fruitcake
Possibly
How long has this been going on
week
We were waiting for the right time to-- feel as though  had been made a perfect chump of
'm sorry
Marry me instead
Thank you, Herb
You're a wonderful man
You really are
Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League
You're saying no
'm saying no--and thank you
didn't make my move fast enough
That's it, isn't it
was too respectful
You were wonderful
What's so wonderful if  lost the sale
(turning to ) You poor kid
Don't touch me
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him
No
(moving dazedly toward the front door) All my dreams have suddenly collapsed
(pause) We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope
It's true
Well--it was nice while it lasted
Thanks for the memories
He exits
Silence
toilet flushes loudly and complicatedly
Is Norbert still here
No
Then who flushed the toilet
Father's friend
What's his name
Don't know
For Heaven's sakes
enters, still adjusting his trousers
How do you do
How do you do, Mrs
Ryan
'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are
Am  intruding here
Not at all
couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again
has now recognized him, but attempts to protect herself from shock by pretending that she has not
Our family physician has asked me to marry him
Paul needs the guidance and companionship that only a man can give
He isn't at all like Harold
But then again, 'm not the woman  was eight years ago
She slumps into a chair, buries her face in her hands
Mom
(pointing weakly) That man is your father
What
There stands the loins from which you've sprung
don't get it
It is you, isn't it, Harold
(enjoying the drama hugely) Yes, wife, it is
(to ) Come here, boy
Your father is home
Sir
Go to him
goes to  dazedly
They embrace clumsily
Son, son, son
Father, father, father
They part, unsatisfied and confused
goes to , his arms outstretched
Wife, wife, wife
struggles to her feet, her face blank embraces her, finds himself wrestling with a rigid, unresponsive object
Wife, wife, wife
lets go, backs away from her
What's the matter
(tearful) Give us time
Like hugging a lamp post
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive
You were well adjusted to my being dead
We adjust to what there is to adjust to
Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately
hope he can will take a little longer
'll be as quick as  can
What sort of time period do you have in mind
Half an hour
An hour
don't know
This is a new disease to me
Disease
Situation
This reunion isn't what  imagined it would be
telegram--a phone call might have helped
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown
Lion doorbell roars
Who's that
Teddy Roosevelt
answers the door, admits
(to ) Safe and sound,  see
(to ) Oh--you came back
came back
You know each other
We met here earlier this evening
How neat
How keen
How was the emergency, Doctor
Profitable,  hope
policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab
Tough luck
You'll have to split the fee
(puzzled by 's mood) Are--are you crying, Penelope
She's crying because she's so happy
That's why 'm crying
Dr
Woodly
(indicating ) You know who this is
didn't get his name
friend of your father
He isn't any friend of Father
He isn't
He is my father
No
Eeeeeeeeeeee-yup
Dr
Woodly-- would like you to meet Harold, my husband
Harold, this is Dr
Woodly, my fiance
She crosses to the door of the master bedroom, kissing each male lightly as she passes
Good night, dear
Good night, dear
She stands in the doorway
Stay or go, talk or sulk, laugh or cry--as you wish
Do whatever seems called for
My mind is gone
Good night
She exits into bedroom, closes the door firmly, locks it audibly
(dazedly) feel the same way
What next
What next
You leave promptly, of course
There is no question as to whose home this is-- None
Whose son this is, whose wife that is
fiance is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time
Good night
(crushed, without any possible comeback) Good night
He exits through the front door
goes at once to 's door, tries it, finds it locked
Penelope
God damn it
Penelope
He considers kicking down the door, thinks better of this, turns away
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt
Is Looseleaf Harper alive
Alive and hale
He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family
Is your mother often this unstable
(not waiting for an answer, calling again) Penelope
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes
Why don't you go to bed--son
can't take my eyes off you
Tomorrow's another day
You know what my English literature teacher said about you
Can't it keep till morning
She said you were legendary wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes
" That's nice
You thank her for me
Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning
Tomorrow's Saturday
Anyway, she's dead
Penelope
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime
Penelope
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her
(sharply) Will you go to bed
(stung) Yes sir
If you can't wake Mom up, 've got double-decker bunks
(stamping his foot) Scat
exits hastily down the corridor to his room goes to 's door, attempts to woo her through it
Penelope--darling--can you hear me
Wife--you know what kept me alive all these fevered, swampy, nightmare years
Your heavenly face, Penelope, my wife--shimmering before me, coaxing me up from my knees, begging me to stagger one step closer to home
Has love ever reached so far
Has love ever overcome more hardships than mine
(silence) Has love ever asked more manliness of a man, more womanliness of a woman
Has ever a man done more for a woman's reward
The bedroom door opens, revealing
(hollowly, to the world at large) There is no one in here of any earthly use to anyone tonight
Tomorrow is another day
She closes the door and locks it
(to audience) End of Act One
Blackout
, alone in the living room, hammers on his mother's door
He wears pajamas
Mom
Mother
Mom
Toilet flushes
Lights come up on the living room
It is morning
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom
What'll  do
Mom
(a moment of exhaustion) Damn
Mom
Door to the master bedroom suite opens
appears in the doorway
She has decided during an almost sleepless night that she owes it to  and to her own self-respect to explore the possibility of beginning her life with anew
She is terrified of him
She hopes that if she can keep calm and open, her fears will diminish
Perhaps she can love him again
(attempting to behave mechanically as a good wife should) What are his symptoms
Shivers and sweats and groans
His teeth chatter
What'll we do
What does he say to do
He can hardly talk
(responding to a last twinge of nausea) Bluh
You'd better get Dr
Woodly
Really
It is an emergency, isn't it
(uncertainly) Yeah
Then get him
(thinking she has made a mistake) Okay
He exits through front door, leaves door open
We hear him knocking on a door in the hallway
Dr
Woodly
enters, drained but recovering
He chews on a root
He has slept in the shirt and trousers he wore the night before
He is barefoot
knocks again
Dr
Woodly
There is the sound of 's door opening
and speak unintelligibly,  evidently inviting  in for a moment
's door closes
What's that all about
We thought a doctor might help
Your old beau
We thought it was an emergency
don't want that chancre mechanic in here
He's a very decent man, Harold
We all are
Shouldn't you lie down
When 'm dead-- (throwing it away) or fucking
Paul said you were awfully sick
was,  was
It never lasts long
He hears 's door open, is alert to 's approach, continues to speak to  absently
The Indians call it "Zamba- keetya"--the little cloudburst
and  enter
is correctly professional and carries a little black bag
Ah
You're ambulatory
What a brilliant diagnosis
You know what  want
(all look at her) want you both to be friends know you both, respect you both
You should be friends
Nothing would please me more
(believing him) Thank God
(pleased but careful) Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today touch of malaria, perhaps
know malaria
Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats
You've been bitten by bats
Colonel Harper and  once shared a treetop with a family of bats
There was a flash flood
There were piranha fish in the water
That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe
You have chills
Chills, fevers, sweats
You can describe it and name it after yourself: "the Woodly galloping crud
" enjoys the joke and the blooming friendship
You can also describe its cure
'm eating its cure
was going to ask
Pacqualinincheewa root
Would you say that again
Pacqualinincheewa root
Means "cougar fang
" Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back
've never heard of it
Congratulations
By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it
(fascinated) Are you've seen it work cures
Hundreds
'm so glad you like each other was so scared, so scared
(breaking off a piece, offering it) Have some
Thank you
Thank you very much
believe in miracles now
Wasn't that sweet of me
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people
Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things
We have, have we
That's an editorial we, of course
haven't turned up anything personally
Everything about you is the editorial we
Take that away from you, and you'd disappear
Harold
could carve a better man out of a banana
Please-- You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles
You know who filled that bag for you
Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself
Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death-- (off balance) Good Lord
can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and start flying in pacqualinincheewa root
can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest
Now we cure you with it
Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks
" suddenly goes to , takes his hand and pretends abject gratitude
Oh, bless you, Doctor, bless you-- oh healer, oh protector, oh giver of life
withdraws his hand, examines it as though it were diseased
He doesn't deserve this
You don't know him
It isn't fair
He thought he could take my place
It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why  don't think he's man enough to do that
thought she was a widow
You were wrong, you quack
Awful
(approaching , but not getting too close) can't tell you how sorry  am
Say hello to your mother
(fervently) Do say hello to your mother
'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now
She's going to East St
Louis--to visit an aunt
Tell her to have a nice trip
(moving towards the front door) Thanks
laughs
This stings  to a cold, peace-loving anger
'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health
What for
Quarantine, possibly
You may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the American people could do without
Goodbye
He exits instantly
Now that's what  call fun
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again
You used to eat it up
did
We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again
What we need is a honeymoon
Let's start right now
trip, you mean
had a trip
We'll honeymoon here
(to ) Go out and play
Play
Your mother and  do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours
He hasn't had breakfast yet
Buy yourself breakfast
(takes his billfold from his hip pocket, hands  a $100 bill) There we go
hundred dollars
The smallest thing 've got
Can  get dressed first
Make it fast
exits to his bedroom
turns to
Honeymoon
Honeymoon
Say it: Honeymoon
It's so--so stark
You used to like it stark
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon
(beginning to stalk her cunningly) 'm not going to strike you
am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie
You mustn't run away now
This is your loving husband approaching
'm your husband
Society approves
wants to run, but doesn't
Good
You held your ground
is very close now, but not touching her
Now--turn around, if you would
Turn around
(laughing) 'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty
What  have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage
Turn around, turn around
obeys
'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now
You mustn't scream
(touches her shoulders gently, expertly) So tense, so tense
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body
That's why you're so tense
Forget Norbert
Relax
It's body time
have a brain
We all do
But now it's body time
Relax
Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream
You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods
Think of your muscles one by one
Let them go slack
Relax
Let the brain go blank
Relax
That's the idea-- that's my girl
Now the small of the back
Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl
(entering, dressed to go out and play) Dad-- (hanging on to , but knowing the mood has been broken) Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door
hundred dollars for breakfast
Leave a tip
(suddenly twisting away, having been nearly hypnotized) have some change
Ram it up your ass
He realizes at once that his violent side has severely damaged the side of him which is the great seducer
and  are straight as ramrods
do beg your pardon
(sincerely) Those words were illy chosen
There is tension in all of us here
Something you must both understand, however, is that the head of this household is home, and he is Harold Ryan, and people do what he says when he says it
That's the way this particular clock is constructed
Lion doorbell roars
Sometimes even  hate that thing
goes reeling to the door in terror, admits , who has also been sleeping in his clothes
(walking right in) 've been looking at motorcycles
Go home
You ever own a motorcycle
(to ) You're right
We'll take a trip
trip is what we'll take
(to ) don't want to talk about motorcycles
don't want to talk about tits
Go home
Haven't got one
(to ) And you went home unannounced, too
dunno
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
did
And how were things
Let's talk about something else
(to ) Alice got married again
She did
You didn't even find that out
There was so much going on
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum
So that's it
"Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum
" Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum
"  thought it was some foreign language
Otherwise, how are things
sure didn't expect her to drop dead
Dead
Jesus
(sick) Alice is dead
No, no--shit no
(stops short) Excuse me, Penelope
For what
For saying "shit
" Or is that okay now
(shrilly) Who's dead
My mother-in-law
Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners-- What happened
Well-- walked up to the front door
was still alive
Big surprise
rang the doorbell, and old Mrs
Wheeler answered
She had her Goddamn knitting
said, "Guess who
" She conked right out
How horrible
Yeah--cripes
never did get any sense out of Alice
She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel
It was a bitch
You know--maybe Mrs
Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if 'd been the paper boy
Maybe not
dunno, boy
That's civilian life for you
Who knows what kills anybody
Could have happened to anybody
First Nagasaki--now this
How about breakfast, wife
Breakfast
(as though to a waitress) Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion
want to eat the onion like an apple
Do you understand
turns away
And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice
Mrs
Wheeler is dead
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs
Wheeler
(regarding , resigning himself to being stuck with his company for a little while longer) Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel
Penelope will bring you some chow
That is the most heartless statement  ever heard pass between human lips
(honestly mystified) Which one
(chokingly) "Bring me a side order of Mrs
Wheeler
" She's up in Heaven now
She didn't hear
She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness
There's nothing nicer than that
(suddenly, angrily, slamming a table with his fist) Chow
Harold Ryan wants chow
What a honeymoon
Honeymoon temporarily canceled
(catching sight of , whose physical appearance really offends him) The boy should still go out and exercise
have the impression he never gets any exercise
He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators
You're wrong
Then let me see him go out and get some exercise
(explosively) Right now
goes reeling in terror to the front door, opens it
(to , abjectly) What kind of exercise
Beat the shit out of someone who hates you
exits
pounds on a table
Chow, chow, chow
God damn it-- nutriment
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast
The cook quit yesterday
You're a woman, aren't you
nods
Then we have a cook
hesitates
Cook, by God
Cook
You're the nigger now
People don't use that word any more
Don't lecture me on race relations
don't have a molecule of prejudice
've been in battle with every kind of man there is
've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian
If 'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me
Cook
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity
People now have dignity when frying eggs
They don't have to feel like slaves
(grandly) Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up
attempts to respond to this, but is too enraged
She exits, making a tiny mosquito-like hum
dunno, boy
The educational process
guess
You're lucky you don't have any old people around here
She was about to get married again
She locked me out of the bedroom last night
starts to laugh
shuts him up
What's funny about that
(apologetically) You know me, boy
enters from the kitchen with a question on her lips
should have torn that door off its hinges
Should have scrogged her ears off
Should have broken the bed
(seeing ) What do you want
(words fail her) Well
-- was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever
could eat a raw baby crocodile
(turning to  crassly) The way to get your wife back is in bed
Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours
(to ) We're starving
Do you mind
exits dumbly, detesting the word "scrog," which she has never heard before
She had two lovers, by the way
starts to laugh again, stops the laugh as glowers
Excuse me
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern
Huh
He and his love are like a retiarius
Do you know what a retiarius is
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap
(amazed) How do you know that
You told me
When
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats
Oh
'd forgotten
Fourteen times you told me counted
Really
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and 'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again
" (acknowledging a flaw in a manly way) Sorry
enters, is about to speak
stops her with a raised finger
Let me guess--breakfast is served
No
What then
do not wish to be scrogged--ever
never heard that word, but when heard it,  knew it was one thing never wanted to have happen to me
That's what you're supposed to say
This is not a coy deception
do not want to be scrogged
want love
want tenderness
You don't know you want
That's the way God built you
will not be scrogged
remember one time  saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel
It couldn't
'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours
(shaking his head) Fish can't feel
Well,  can
Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me
'm not a silly carhop any more
(an unexpected, minor insight) Maybe you're right about fish
When  was a carhop,  didn't feel much more than a fish would
But 've been sensitized
have ideas now--and solid information
know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you
(sensing danger) Such as
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots
Tell me about its sexual roots
It's complicated and  don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted
It's just the truth
like the truth
wouldn't be alive today if  weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there
Go on
(blurting) And they have very mixed feelings about women
They hate them in a way
One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently
They can scrog them, as you say-- (pause) for revenge
You learned this in some college course
learned a lot of things in college
Actually--it was Norbert who told me that
(darkly) The doctor
Yes
And what is his most cherished possession
(not sensing the drift of the conversation) His most cherished possession
His violin,  guess
And he keeps it in his apartment
(still at sea) Yes
And no one's there now
don't think so
That's too bad
would rather have him at home--to see what 'm going to do
(suddenly catching on, sick with fear) What are you going to do
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me
'm now going to even that score
'm going to break in his door and 'm going to smash his violin
No you're not
Why not
Because if you do--'ll leave you
(promptly and emotionlessly) Goodbye
Blackout
comes up on   and  , dressed as before
They have become close friends
We have this new club up here in Heaven
Yes, we do
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time
We have enough for a shuffleboard team
In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything
Hitler plays shuffleboard
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard
Mozart plays shuffleboard
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard
Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard
It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard
like his sense of humor, though--you know
He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears
You know what it says on the back
"Pontius Pilate Athletic Club
" Most people don't get it
Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club
We're going to have jackets, aren't we
You bet
"The Harold Ryan Fan Club
" Pink, eh
With a yellow streak up the back
(both laugh) We got very good tailor shops up here
They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want
Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart
He walks around all hunched over, and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the words, "Go take a flying-- punches him in the ribs
leap at the moon
" , 's third wife, enters
She is voluptuous, blowzy, tough--about forty-five
She has trouble with alcohol
is expecting her
Aha
Hello
You're Mildred, right
heard you were looking for me
You were Harold Ryan's third wife
Right
Yes
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club
Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back
Do  have to
Who's the little girl
Mr
Ryan just borrowed my birthday cake
don't really know him
Thought you were another wife, maybe
'm only ten years old
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife
He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids
Won't you please join our club
Please
Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time 've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual  would rather forget
He drove me to drink
He drove his first two wives to drink
Because he was cruel
(covering 's little ears) Premature ejaculation
Ach soooooooooo
No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation
Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring
He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace
He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them
He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes
He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet
That was very important to him
did it tried to be a good wife
He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo
couldn't do that, but  pretended  did
It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo
" Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids
Any little kids
That is sad
(blankly) Is it
(pause) have this theory about why men kill each other and break things
Ja
Never mind
It's a dumb theory was going to say it was all sexual
but everything is sexual
but alcohol
(making peace sign) Peace
(making peace sign)            (making peace sign) Peace
Peace
Blackout
Darkness
Ha ha ha ha ha
(pistol shot) You got me, pal
Silence
baby cries
Silence
The lights come up
Go to the funeral
Of course
Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform
Rent a uniform
That's against the law, isn't it
can't wear a uniform anymore
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass
When  was a naive young recruit in Spain,  used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos
now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear
(raises his glass) To our women
didn't know we had any women left
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy
Every time  start thinking like that  get the clap
Lion doorbell roars
(going to the door) This could be my next wife
He admits  , who carries a bouquet of roses
(puzzled by ) Hello
How are you, honeybunch
Is Penelope in
The posies are for her
wanted to apologize
You've come to the right man
forgot my vacuum cleaner
forget mine for years on end
(suddenly realizing who  is) Oh my God-- (pause; points) And you are Looseleaf Harper
Hi
faints
(crowing) It's what 've dreamed of all my life, Looseleaf
To have a grown man realize who  was--and faint
(to audience) End of Act Two
Blackout
enters drunkenly up aisle, sits precariously on apron of stage and speaks to audience
Two days later
The afternoon of the day of Looseleaf Harper's mother-in-law's funeral
You got it
Two days later
(pause) You know what happened in Heaven today
There was a tornado
'm not kidding you--there was a Goddamn tornado
Tore up fifty-six houses, a dance pavilion and a Ferris wheel
Drove a shuffleboard stick clear through a telephone pole
Nobody got killed
Nobody ever gets killed
They just bounce around a lot
Then they get up-- and start playing shuffleboard
(pause) never saw a tornado when  was alive, and  grew up in Oklahoma
There's this big, black, funnel- shaped cloud
Sounds like a railroad train without the whistle
had to come to Heaven to see a thing like that
lot of people got photographs
(pause) After the tornado was over, a man had some film left and he wanted to take pictures of me--to use up the roll
don't like people who go around taking pictures of everything
Nothing's real to some people unless they've got photographs
(pause) Two days later--right
She exits clumsily, the way she came
Silence
Lights come up on the living room, which has become a pigpen
, ,  and  sit around a dinner of nearly raw beefsteak set on the coffee table
wears an ill- fitting uniform, which he has rented
told you the uniform wouldn't help
It helped more than you know
Down deep, people were deeply affected
You keep on saying "deep" and "deeply
"  wish something good would happen on the surface sometime
can't get over how you guys are my friends
Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends
Our pleasure
Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me
We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup
Blue soup
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising
It was a form of chemical castration
We became two more sleepy Indians
(to ) So, kid--how they hanging
Or don't you say that to a little kid
He's a man
(to ) Tell him you're a man
'm a man
We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change
wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up
(to ) Still miss your mother
(weakly) No
You're free to go to her, if you want
If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die
'd rather go to Viet Nam
Would somebody please pass me the catsup
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup
" Pass the fucking catsup
gives it to him
dumps catsup on his steak
keep thinking about Africa--and the elephants
don't think 'll go
Of course you'll go
You're going to fly the helicopter
dunno
You're so low
Look at that beautiful red meat
You haven't touched it
Sorry
At least you've got a place to come back to
don't have a place to come back to anymore
All the more reason to go to Africa
dunno
You know
(pause) used to really love that Alice
Do you know that
You know her for what she is now-- garbage
dunno
She was always a rotten wife
She was against everything manly you ever wanted to do
(to ) He was the most daring test pilot in the country at one time, and his wife made him quit
She made him become a life insurance salesman instead
'd think any woman worth her salt would be proud to be married to a test pilot
know  would
She tried to like it
She was a very nervous woman
could tell that at the funeral
(to ) Would you please pass the fucking catsup again
Was it dangerous testing planes
dunno
Who knows
You know-- you're up there, and you're in some plane nobody ever flew before
You put her into a dive, and everything starts screaming and shaking, and maybe some pipe breaks and squirts oil or gasoline or hydraulic fluid in your face
You wonder how the hell you ever got in such a mess, and then you pull back on the controls, and you black out for a couple of seconds
When you come to, everything's usually fairly okay--except maybe you threw up all over yourself
It's just another job, but you try and tell Alice that
Insurance
You actually sold insurance
tried
(indicating ) sold him some
That was the only insurance  ever sold
Hyena doorbell laughs
What an awful sound
Get used to it
(to ) Back door, Paul
exits to the kitchen
(to ) It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa
've considered that
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have
just want one true adventure before  die
That can be arranged
appears at the mouth of the doorway
He has something amazing to announce
Dad
Who was it
It's Mom
He steps aside
appears
and stand,  angrily
(openly, cheerfully) Hi, Penelope
(to ) Shut up, you ninny
(to ) You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever
came for my clothes
Sneaking in the back door
rang
It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use
Your clothes are at the city dump by now
Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation
came for Paul as well
If he wants to go
You took him to the funeral,  hear
He'd never seen a corpse
He's seen a dozen now
dozen
It's a big and busy funeral home
(to ) Did you like it, dear
It isn't a matter of liking
It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing
Would you mind leaving
No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything
Unless she has nerve
More nerve than the doctor,  must admit
He hasn't been home for two days
Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin
He knows you shattered his violin
'm dying to hear of his reaction
The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions
He cried
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat
Two hundred years old
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention
(moving toward the violin, and, incidentally, placing herself much closer to ) He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now
(echoing, expressing the futility of such long-term expectations) Hope
He spots the vacuum cleaner, probes it with his toe, asks with seriousness
Do you hope with all your heart that someone will be using this vacuum cleaner two hundred years from now
starts to answer, but stops, supposing that he is being made sport of
Fifty years
You're making a joke
(not joking) 'm interested in long-term expectations
(flatly, protecting his dignity) It's engineered to last about fifteen years
(downstage center, addressing the civilized world) Things
Oh--you silly people and your things
Things, things, things
(to , as reflects majestically on the emptiness of materialism) You and Harold are friends
(revealing how mixed and worried his feelings are) He's the most wonderful guy  ever met, Penelope
He's the most complicated guy  ever met can't believe it, but he's going to take me to Africa with him
Things
You feel 've done a dreadful thing--leaving him
(almost hypnotized) If  were married to him,  sure wouldn't walk out
(directly to the audience) Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit
Look after your things, your things
(to ) And you, Colonel
Let me guess: You don't know
dunno
(to the audience) Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things
Jesus-- wouldn't want to be married to him
You know
What's this
wouldn't want to be married to me
We're too crazy
You know
In what way, pray tell
didn't like that violin thing
That was sad
Tit for tat--as simple as that
You never played a violin
You did
Yeah
practically forgot
But after you busted that thing,  got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe 'll start the violin again
" That didn't just belong to Woodly
That belonged to everybody
Maybe he would have sold it to me, and could have some fun
After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out,  thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her
" Maybe it's time you got out
Me
You
Okay
(pause) Okay
You're an imbecile
know you think that
Everybody thinks that
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life
(shaking his head) don't think so
(pause) It could have been
If what
If  hadn't done it
If 'd said to myself, "Screw it
'm going to let all those people down there live
" They were enemies
We were at war
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better,  think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--'m not going to do that to the enemy
That's too much
" You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up
could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb
(pause) sent 'em to Heaven instead--and don't think there is one
Goodbye, Looseleaf
walks around and gathers his things
So long, you guys
What will you do, Colonel
dunno
Marry the first whore who's nice to me,  guess
Get a job in a motorcycle shop
So long, you guys
kisses
Everybody but  acknowledges his departure is some way
turns his back exits, closes door
Silence
Who's going to fly our helicopter now
(blackly, tautly) What
We got to get another pilot
For what
For Africa
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman
You invited me
To make an ass of yourself
What went wrong
We're ahead of schedule, that's all
You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive
Gee whiz-- It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us
wouldn't drop my gun
You're hollow, like a woman
'm smarter than Looseleaf
He can shoot
He can hold his ground
He can attack
You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one
(close to tears) How do you know how 'd act in Africa
Look how you're acting now
This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying
Slug me
You're my buddy
Out
Out
No matter what you say to me, still think you're the greatest guy ever knew
Out
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out
Thank God
He propels  out the door and slams it
He faces and , speaks with malicious calm
Well--what have we here
family
Almost a Christmas scene
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Just one favor
Money
There's plenty of that
Mildred got the brewery
You'll probably get the baseball team
want you to tell me that you loved me once
is about to dismiss this request majestically, but cuts him off with a sharp, dangerous warning
mean it
must have that, and so must Paul
Tell him that he was conceived in love, even though you hate me now
Tell both of us that somewhere is our lives was love
experiments inwardly with responses of various kinds, obviously saying them to himself, directing himself with his hands
Nothing quite satisfies him
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range
don't do them well
(sincerely, not liking to fail in any way) That's a failing,  know
(accepting this ruefully) see
don't care
don't care if there was love or not
That's all right
'm going to go to my room and close the door
don't want to hear any more
exits wretchedly to his room
See how you've upset him
He was so merry and hale before you came home
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room
He'll play with his rifle,  expect
That will cheer him up
Rifle
bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven
And where is the good doctor
Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere
He's in East St
Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt
Last  heard, his mother was going alone
He's afraid of you, Harold
He knew you'd want to fight him
He doesn't know anything about fighting
He hates pain
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice
It seems highly intelligent to me
What kind of a country has this become
The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them
America's days of greatness are over
It has drunk the blue soup
Blue soup
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink
It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge
We laughed, we sang, we snoozed
When a bird called, we answered back
Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought
Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried
We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach
sang "Oh Promise Me
" Can you imagine
Where the hell did  ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"
Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a -36
All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup
Never stopped drinking blue soup
Blue soup all the time
We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender
Sounds quite beautiful
(angered) Beautiful, you say
It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything
(anger still mounting) Beautiful
Seven years gone-- (snapping his fingers) like that, like that
Seven years of silliness and random dreams
Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much
Like what
(becoming dangerously physical, seizing a battle-ax) Action
Interaction
Give and take
Challenge and response
He splits a coffee table with the ax
(rushing in with his 22 rifle at a high port arms) Mom
What's this
wilts instantly, attempts to make his rifle inconspicuous, harmless, meaningless
What's this
Nothing
That's a rifle you have
No
Of course it is
Is it loaded
No
Open the bolt
obeys
cartridge pops out
That's a cartridge, if 'm not mistaken
Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go
was cleaning it
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs
Gee whiz, Dad-- Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart
Load that gun
(bleatingly) Dad-- Too late
It's man to man now
Protecting your mother from me, are you
Protect her
` He's a child
With an iron penis three feet long
Load it, boy
You're begging him to kill you
If he thinks he's man enough
(amazed by sudden insight) That's really what you want
You become furious when people won't make you dead
'm teaching my son to be a man
So he can kill you
You hate your own life that much
You beg for a hero to kill you
plan to live one hundred years
No you don't
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself
Honor,  suppose
What a handsome word
(wonderingly) But it's all balled up in your head with death
The highest honor is death
When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them
You honored them with death
Harold--it is not honor to be killed
If you've lived a good life, fought well-- It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all
It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness
To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all
May  continue with the rearing of my son
(to ) Load that gun
shakes his head
Load it
refuses
Then speak, by God
Can you fight with words
don't want to fight you
Get mad
Tell me you don't like the way  treat your mother
Tell me you wish 'd never come home
(weakly) It's your house, Dad
(throwing up his hands) Everybody simply evaporates
(including the audience, inviting it to share his indignation) There are guest issues to be fought out here--or to be argued, at least
The enemy, the champion of all who oppose me, is in East St
Louis with his mother and his aunt have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a violin
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight
They're trying to save the planet
There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore
feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect
We don't have to fight with steel
can fight with words
'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary
Call him up in East St
Louis, Penelope
Tell him to come here
No
(emptily, turning away) No
Pause
He contemplates
And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too
don't know
hope he never hunts
hope he never kills another human being
(to , quietly) You hope this, too
don't know what  hope
But don't think you care what  hope, anyway
You don't know me
(indicating ) You don't know her, either don't think you know anybody
You talk to everybody just the same
'm talking to you gently now
Yeah
But it's going to get loud again
He's right, Harold
To you, we're simply pieces in a game--this one labeled "woman," that one labeled "son
" There is no piece labeled "enemy" and you are confused
Lion doorbell roars
goes to answer it
There won't be anybody out there
That's the new style: nobody anywhere
, aghast, admits
is high as a kite on his own adrenaline
(aghast, chokingly) Get out of here
It's really that bad
He comes farther into the room, bravely
You fool, you fool
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you
It died for your sins
This little corpse is intended as a lesson
There's a certain amount of information there
Lest we forget how cruel you are
(moving to the telephone) 'm going to call the police
(frighteningly) Don't
agree
closes the door
backs away from the phone, drifts toward , who still holds his rifle
This is man to man
It's healer to killer
Is that the same thing
What brought you back
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon
"Honor, " if you like
(to ) He's a champion after all
Of the corpses and cripples you create for our instruction--when all we can learn from them is this: how cruel you are
This is suicide
(to ) Go get the police
Stop
stops
There's going to be no bloodshed here
know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words
The truth
(to ) Am  correct
Yes
can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers
But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words
The truth
Correct
Correct
What an hallucination
(laughs) Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear
Oh dearie me
You haven't heard me yet
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice
Will  bleed from my every orifice
Who will clean up this awful mess
We'll find out now, won't we
No, we won't
No matter how it begins, it will end in death
Because it always does
Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death
There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort
These elements are lacking
You're a filthy, rotten bastard
(pretending to be wounded) Oooooo
That hurt
You're old--so old
Now who's being cruel
living fossil
Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs
We do survive, don't we
You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard
That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard
No rush about that
Just remember to apologize sometime soon
takes the rifle from
You're a son of a bitch
Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology
Whenever you feel like it
It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly
Your apology turns off the alarm
(leveling the gun) 'm turning off the alarm
'm turning off everything
Ah
The lady is armed
want you to get out of here, Norbert
Harold-- want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone
(to ) Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do
It's the American way
mean it
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun
(to ) Where's the bullet
makes no move to help
Help your mother find the bullet
(to , pointing to the floor) There it is
Give it to me
obeys
How do  load
(to ) Load it for her
shakily obeys
Cock it, too
obeys
Give it to her
obeys
All right
Am  exceedingly dangerous now
The National Safety Council would be appalled
Then listen to me
(angrily) You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride
(to ) hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film
loved you when you stayed away
But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl
You fool, you fool
Everything's going to be beautiful
You fake
You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon
(pause) You're not going to beat Harold
You're not going to beat anybody
You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed
Go home
She's right, Norbert--go home
haven't said all  have to say
Out
haven't told you, Harold, how comical  think you are
(hit squarely, absolutely unable to forgive) Comical
(to ) Sit down or 'll shoot
goes over to her, easily takes the gun away) Give me that Goddamn thing
Now get out of here, or  might kill you
Who knows
(terrified) You've killed women
Seventeen of them--eleven by accident
March
Move
(to ) You, too
and  move toward the front door
Norbert--you come, too
(to ) Let him go, Harold
Let him go
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree
Do it, Norbert
Hands and knees, you say
And terror, if you don't mind
Do it
(to , simply, decisively, unafraid) Goodbye
(before she can protest any more) Goodbye
Goodbye
He bellies and bullies  and  out the front door
Get the police
No time to lose
He slams the door, turns to
You're in one hell of a jam
You realize that
'm high as a kite
Glands
You're supposed to be happy when you die
Call me comical again
You're a clown
You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown
love you
Have a cigar
(ignoring the cigar) Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar
Simple butchers like you are obsolete
'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else
This is going to become very physical
Are you prepared for that
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man
'm an honorable clown
King Arthur
You hope
In any event,  will not beg for mercy
No quarter asked
(taking a sword) No quarter given
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew
(offering sword) Cut me open
Find out
've struck my blow
With spittle
've poisoned you
(pointing at in horror) Lucretia Borgia
(looking around frantically) Something  drank or touched
(understanding) You refused a cigar
That's it
Potassium cyanide in the humidor
Treacherous lover of peace
put a poisoned thought in your head
Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind
It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown
" Poison
You have a very good mind, or wouldn't have come back
That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown
" And the answer is, "Yes
" (touching his forehead experimentally) -- really must congratulate you
Something is happening in there
You can never take yourself seriously again
Look at all the creatures you've protected us from
Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive
(blankly, as though in a dream) No
The magic root you gave me-- had it analyzed
It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893
He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife
(blankly) see
You aren't going to hurt me
You aren't going to hurt anybody any more
Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself
(quietly) Don Quixote
My violin is avenged
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect
And the hell with it
It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed
The new hero is you
hate crowds, and  have no charisma-- You're too modest
But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me
He'll disarm you, of course
No more guns, no more guns
Was  ever of use
Never
For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind
picks up the rifle, considers it, offers it to
Here
Finish the job
'm utterly satisfied
You're making a mistake
Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded
You've wounded me
More clowning
Don't you see
We never quit fighting until we're dead
You'd be killing a friend
Don't you know how much  like you
'm going to shoot you now
No
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it
It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man
You can change
Like the saber-toothed tiger
(sickened) Oh God--you're really going to kill me
It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee
Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say
You'll like it there
Can  beg for mercy--on my knees
If you want to be found that way
What is this thing that kills me
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders
He will soon be extinct
It's time, it's time
Don't shoot
've enjoyed being man
He aims the rifle tentatively
No
(goes down on his knees) No
Get up
No
Have it your way
We'd both be better off dead now
begins to squeeze the trigger, falters, lowers the rifle
Can't do it
Thank God
Crawl home
He turns his back on , who stands shakily
Thank you--for my life
It's trash now, like mine
New lives begin
Somewhere in this city
Not here, not here
Tell Penelope  loved her--in my clownish way
And Paul
Tell him to be a healer, by all means
What are you going to do
Use the sanitary facilities, if  may
Leave the rifle here
'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do
For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word
exits into corridor
looks after him helplessly, apprehensively
Silence
Harold
, , and   enter from the side stealthily
, pantomimes that his companions are to be quiet and to listen for something wonderful
All ghosts cup their hands to their ears
Harold
There is a shot offstage
is delighted
is sickened
is dazed
collapses in grief
enters from the corridor, shaking his head
missed
expresses disappointment
covers her face
sucks her thumb
The end
Curtain
