Written by Tim Burns, Tom Stern & Alex Winter January 12, 1992 & horribly deformed figure--hunchback, misshapen head--sits on a stool in complete silhouette
This is
Can you imagine it, Regis, Kathie Lee
One day 'm a hot young movie star, and the next day 'm a hideous mutant freak, covered with festering lesions
Oddly,  and   are also in complete silhouette
Sounds like my wife when she misses a mudpack
The audience
Kathie Lee pooh-poohs Regis
Oh Regis
You're incorrigible
Ha- ha
(to Rick, she turns ) Ricky, once you were the all- American boy next door, star of the beloved Hey Dude films
Now the very mention of your name makes children scream in terror
We've all read about your disturbing story
But the people want to hear it from you, Ricky Coogan
(: children scream) Won't you tell us your story
Well, it's kinda long, but okay
It all started when  signed a deal to be spokesman for the
conglomerate
: - The
logo--a large metal shoe with a bar across it, with the words "Everything Except Shoes" beneath
Widen to reveal  , president of
, smiling rigidly to camera
is next to him, also holding a stiff movie-star smile
They shake hands as the photographer takes publicity shots
Off to one side, behind Hertz, are several
Behind Rick is his entourage: , , , , and 2
Further off, at the boardroom table, four on the brink of death look on with glazed expressions
(through a clenched smile) So, what kind of crap do you scumbags want me to peddle
Everything
Everything except shoes, of course
Hah hah
He laughs pathetically
Rick doesn't respond
Hertz nods to a nearby  who hands him some
Meaty Twig Beef Sticks
Rick takes them and holds them up to the camera
Smiles
Flash
Helmet Head hair spray
He takes the hair spray and holds it up
Smile
Flash
The assistant carefully hands Hertz a pulsating metal container with lots of warnings and danger symbols on it
Hertz gives it to Rick
Noxon 24 biogenetic neuro- fertilizer
Rick holds it up, then pushes it away in disgust
Fertilizer
Ricky Coogan does not do ads for hi-tech cow shit
'm a star, got it, Hertz
(to his aide) Rico, give these misguided clowns Tony Danza's phone number, and let's get the hell out of here
He gives the finger to the  photographer, who obligingly takes a picture
Hertz waves at him to get lost, and calls after Rick who's headed to the door with his entourage
Rick
Wait
Only you can stand up to the radicals trying to keep Noxon from the struggling farmers whose very future depends on it
3
() Noxon
Wasn't that just banned
Only in the
and Europe
But  heard that shit's lethal
Hertz lets out a big laugh
He shakes his head at Rick
Rick, Rick, Rick
You want proof
Fine
Just take a seat
Please
Rick nods to his entourage
They sit at the boardroom table, across from the  execs
An easel behind Hertz shows a placard with a bar graph
Hertz whispers something to an aide, who scurries off
( ) Meet the head of our South American research facility, Juan Valdez
The aide ushers in a handsome    in a natty three-piece suit and a sombrero
My name is George Ramirez
Whatever
He's worked with Noxon 24 every day for five years, and he's in fine shape
Aren't you, Juan
George glares at Hertz bitterly
Hertz stares him down
Yes
am fine
Me and my team in Santa Flan have-- Santa "Flan
" What kind of shitty name for a country is that
It is named for the patron saint of creamy desserts
As  was saying, we've worked very closely with Noxon
4
Rick nods
We cut back to George, but he isn't George anymore
He has mutated into a similar looking actor, in the same suit, the same sombrero, but shorter and swarthier
(') personally supervised its development
Rick furrows his brow
He's a little suspicious of George's transformation, but just a little
Now George is even shorter, even swarthier
Yet another actor
(') performed rigorous scientific tests
No potential danger was left uninvestigated
Rick's suspicion is increasing
He looks over to Hertz, who feigns total innocence
George is now even shorter
Still another actor
His clothes are baggy, and the sombrero is starting to slide down over his face
(') The environmentalists are crackpots, all of them
Rick looks at his entourage
Their mouths hang open in astonishment
George has now shrunk to near-midget proportions
The sombrero completely covers his head
When he takes it off, we see he's now played by
It's ridiculous,  tell you
Totally ridiculous
Rick is ready to ask questions, but Hertz cuts him off
Thank you, Valdez
That will be all
George nods and heads back to his seat
As he passes behind Hertz, he can't resist sticking his thumbs in his ears and making a face
Wait a second-- 5
Ricky, this is important
We're talking about a major threat to the image
How does 2 million dollars plus expenses sound
The aide reveals a new placard on the easel
It reads "$2 " Look, it sounds great, but-- hear you
Make it five million-- (a new placard: 5 ) that is, if the board agrees
Hertz reaches beside his chair and pulls a lever
The old geezers beside him raise their arms stiffly, as if they were being pulled by strands of fishing line, which they are
Good, it's unanimous
Well, what do you say, Ricky
Are you 's "Man in Santa Flan
" Rick looks at his advisors--they look over at Linda Hunt, then emphatically shake their heads "
" Rick looks at Hertz, who shows him five big fingers and grins
Rick breaks into a big smile and gives Hertz his trademark thumbs up sign
: Rick stands in line at the luggage -ray machine
He impatiently checks his watch as the -  chats him up
holding a large bomb passes through the security check unquestioned
- My kids just loved you in "Hey Dude Three: The Final Countdown
" We need more wholesome role models like you
Uh-huh
( ) Where the fuck is Ernie
6
We hear '
They turn towards the noise and see a bunch of  scattering from a trendy young cad with a fake hand sticking out of his fly
This is , Rick's buddy and resident court jester
Ladies
All  wanted was a manicure
Yah-ha-ha
(he sees Rick) '
'
Rick pumps Ernie's third "hand
" The miffed -ray checker points to Rick's large carry-on bag as it emerges from the - ray machine
- ( ) Mister Coogan, is this your bag
Yeah, why
- Is this your kid
He indicates the -ray monitor, where we see the skeleton outline of a ,  10    curled up in Rick's bag
The kid waves
Rick and Ernie look at each other in horror
/ Stuey Gluck
The bag bursts open, and out pops  , an obsessive young autograph hound toting a stack of scrapbooks and memorabilia
Rick
Rick
Look
got a rare still from your high school production of The Glass Menagerie
Could you sign it for me
Please
( ) Let's get the hell out of here
7
Ernie nods and yanks the bag away from under Stuey
They run away down the corridor
Stuey chases them, holding up an 8 by 10 photo
Rick
Wait up
Rick and Ernie run around a corner with Stuey in pursuit
Rick
Remember the speech you gave at the Actors Forum for Social Justice
He holds up a cassette player and hits play
It's Rick's old speech
'  ( ) If all the world is a stage, then let us shine the spotlight on truth, integrity, and a deep compassion for all life
Leave me alone, troll
( ) That was before  got an entertainment lawyer
Quick, down here
Ernie leads Rick down an adjacent hallway
It's a dead end
Rick and Ernie are trapped
Ernie gives Rick a sheepish look
Stuey stands at the entrance of the hallway
He holds up a Time magazine
Rick
Rick
It says here Noxon's dangerous
Why are you lending your name to it
What's happened to you, Rick
You used to be good
And now
just don't know
Stuey starts to cry
Rick looks guilty
Don't cry, Stuey, 'm still good
8
passing electric baggage cart nails Stuey at full speed and carries him off down the corridor, screaming bloody murder
Rick and Ernie high five
: - pours champagne for Rick and Ernie
The anarchist sits nearby with the bomb on his lap
Rick winks suggestively at the stewardess
She walks off, obviously not interested
Rick raises his glass to Ernie, oozing sleazy confidence
In the bag
The plane hits turbulence, and Rick's drink flies up out of his glass--he catches it as it comes down
Another helps the Anarchist put his bomb in the overhead compartment
Ernie ogles her
She sneers at him
We hear the ' voice on the loudspeaker
(
0
) Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking
To the right of the aircraft, you can see a great view of the Grand Canyon
All the passengers crane their necks to the right
(
0
) And to the left you can see a panic- stricken little troll
Rick turns to his window and flings open the shade to reveal
on the wing, pressing his face up against the glass
He's holding up a publicity shot of Rick and screaming something we can't hear
Stuey loses his grip and is whisked off the wing
Rick watches him fall into oblivion
9
Relieved, he turns nonchalantly to Ernie, ignoring the other horrified passengers
You gonna eat your peanuts, Ernie
Nah, you can have 'em
: large haystack sits in the middle of a field
We hear Stuey's approaching scream
(
) Stuey misses the haystack by a few feet
He hops to his feet and dusts himself off
Hey, 'm okay
His scrapbook falls into frame and beans him
: - We see the airliner lowering its landing gear as it makes its final approach to the runway
() Here we are Ernie, Santa Spam
World famous for loud music and hot sex
() It is
() Give me a few hours
-
The plane explodes in a fireball
Swish-pan to reveal
10
Standing just outside the airport
porter follows with their bags
Sure glad that wasn't our plane
Ernie nods
They're distracted by the sound of chanting
They squint into the distance, where they see a group of chanting --young "Save the Earth" types, latter-day hippies, kids, seniors, etc
mustn't stay
Take your toxic crap away
mustn't stay
(etc
) Some of their signs read--"Say No to Noxon
", "Coogan Go Home", " is killing our Earth
", "Ricky Coogan Sucks Shit" (this one held by a nice  ), " Like Ike" (held by a confused  , shuffling around aimlessly), "Drink Pepsi" and finally
"Free Nelson Mandela"--we  to reveal the subheading: "Inside specially marked boxes
" We keep  to reveal that this is not on a protest placard, but a box of cereal some  is eating as he watches the protest
Jesus
We better find the limo before these whale kissers chop us up and sell us for parts
(he spots the limo) There it is
Off to the side, away from the protesters, an unmarked limo with tinted windows (and plates that say  ) awaits
, an  exec, leans out the window and waves discreetly at Ricky
The stewardesses, looking tipsy, wave their bras out the back window invitingly
Ernie tries to grab Ricky by the arm, but he resists
He's looking at the protesters
Wait a second
His
standing in the center of the crowd of protesters, holding a to her mouth and chanting
She puts down the megaphone to rest, and we can see that she's powerfully beautiful, in a no-nonsense feminist kind of way
This is Rick is smitten
11
Let's go, Rick
They're waitin'
Forget them
got a better idea
If  can just find the right disguise
Coog, those hippies'll tear us apart
Rick spots a    limping out of the airport on crutches
Rick approaches him, waving a roll of bills
Hey, how'd you like to make a quick hundred bucks
The man mutters something weakly
Ernie puts his ear up close to hear him better
He says the pants don't usually come off for less than two-fifty, but since you're so cute, he'll make an exception
: buried beneath rolls and rolls of bandages, making his way through the protesters on crutches
Ernie helps him along, nervously
As Rick spots Julie from behind, he hands the crutches over to Ernie
Here
Ernie takes the crutches
Rick waves his arms dramatically, clutches his bandaged legs, and winces in pain
Help
Ow
Give me back my crutches
You monster
Oh, the pain
The agony
He falls theatrically at Julie's feet
Are you okay
Let me help you
12
Thanks
Don't worry about me
What's one man's pain weighed against the global injustice of corporate tyrants like
Go
The fight must continue
Julie's buying it big time
She gazes deep into Rick's eyes
Wow
My name's Julie
Josh
Josh Tavner
Ernie sticks a hand out, grinning sarcastically
Mother Theresa
Glad to meet you
Julie turns on Ernie viciously
She slaps him hard, and grabs the crutches from him
Ow
Hey
Give me those, ape
Help him up
Rick rises to his feet "painfully
" Hey Josh, a busload of us are headed over to Maracas to protest Noxon 24 and pelt Ricky Coogan with cow shit
Same here
You could ride with us
Us
You're with him
She looks at Ernie, who grins stupidly
Oh, he's okay
Have you ever heard of an idiot savant
Sure
That's Ernie
Except for the savant part
13
Ernie glares at Rick
Rick smiles at Julie hopefully
Julie looks at them both, and can't help smiling herself
: - Ernie drives the battered old convertible which bears the proud logo of Santa Flan Rent-a-Car
There's a Pepsi billboard in the background
Julie massages Rick in the back seat
(faking terrible pain) Ooooh, my pelvis
() Is this better
' Rick moans and cracks a huge grin through his bandages
Ernie tries to get in on the conversation
Hey Julie
You know 'm kind of an idea man myself
Like, let's say there's a nuclear war, and the only two people left are you and the Pope
Would you pork him
Disgusted, Julie smacks Ernie sharply and continues massaging Rick
Scowling with jealousy, Ernie tries a new approach
But one thing's for sure
That Coogan guy sure is an asshole, huh
'll say
What a total piece of shit
Don't you think so, Josh
Rick grits his teeth
( ) Well, he's got a few problems
And what a lousy actor
mean can you believe that "Hey Dude" crap
14
Well, with a script that bad, Coogan deserves an Oscar for coming off as good as he did
( ) mean, that's what  read
Well, he's no Christian Slater
() could act circles around that one-note hack
He was shittin' his diapers when  was the toast of Broadway
made grown men cry
made crippled children laugh
Now all  ever hear is Slater
Slater
Slater Enraged, Rick rips the bandages off his face
You think Slater could improv like this
Make you believe he was an invalid
Huh
Julie stares at him in shock
Rick catches his breath, realizes what he's just done, and smiles weakly
Ernie tries to break the awkward silence
( ) So, do you like Swedish films
Julie gives him a murderous look
: - High wide shot: The car is descending deeper into the wild jungle, towards a huge eerie sunset
Julie's been lecturing Rick for some time now
You don't even want to hear the truth about Noxon, do you, Coogan
() 15
(') mean, look, 'm not saying this stuff is going to turn anyone into a
a
' on the road behind Julie he sees a crude carnival billboard featuring a painting of a huge worm with a man's head
It reads "See the Incredabel Humin Werm
Only at Elijah
Skuggs Famus Freek Land
" Julie can't see it
() Human worm
Right
human worm
mean, that's just stupid
The point is-- Rick sees another billboard for the freak show
This one features a half-man/half-dog creature and says "See the Aztownding Dawg Boy
" Dog boy
Yeah, or a dog boy
That's absurd
-- Another billboard
This one features the "Hidyous Frawg Man
" Hideous frog man
Okay, okay
Now you're just being silly
Human suffering's just a big joke to you, huh
You are sick, Coogan
She turns away from him in a huff and looks out her window
She sees a billboard that reads "See The Hole Amazing Famly of Freekz at Elijah
Skuggs Famus Freek Land and Mutent Emporeum
" Cool
freak show
Let's check it out
Kind of like a family reunion for you, huh
16
Lighten up, Coog, could be a goof
The car turns into a driveway near a crude, hand painted sign that says "FreekzTM--Thiss waey" with a messy arrow
We   to the hand painted "small print" on the bottom of the sign, which reads--"Freekz is a registered trademark of Elijah
Skuggs Enterprises
Any unauthorized reproduction is strictly prohibited without prior written consent
" : The car stops at the end of the long, spooky driveway, just past a sizzling electric fence
Rick, Julie, and Ernie get out and look around
It's eerily quiet
There is a large dilapidated mining shed complete with rusted ducts and a tall smoke stack, a tattered carnival tent with an ornate stage flat facade, a lopsided outhouse, a creepy broken-down farm house, and in the center of it all, a giant molded carnival head with big staring eyes, which slowly rotates on a creaky base
Ernie looks hard at the big eyes
He turns away for a second, then spins around again
The  are looking in a different direction
Ernie shakes his head and unwraps a chocolate bar
Isn't it great
It's so "real"
Real stupid
( ) Let's go
This place is dead
Yeah
Where are all the weirdos
(
) There are no weirdos here
Startled, they turn to see
, a twisted, haggard old man
He takes a bite out of an ice cream cone which contains the rear half of a chipmunk with a maraschino cherry on top
Elijah has bad teeth, a bad shave, and scary eyes
We now realize the giant head is molded in his image
17
Mutants, yes
Genetic nightmares, definitely
Children of Hell and twisted masses of living, breathing tormented flesh, certainly
But as for weirdos
not a one
Unless of course you count me
Ha ha ha
Nah, you seem like a regular dumbshit old redneck to me
Elijah ignores him
Julie shoots him a look and smiles at Elijah
'm Julie
And you are
Elijah
Skuggs, proud proprietor of Skugg's Fabulous Freak Land and Mutant Emporium
But you knew that
After all, you've ventured miles away from civilization, hospitals, telephones, ( ) police
How may  help-you
Drop dead
Elijah smiles, unfazed
Julie glares at Rick
She smiles apologetically at Elijah
We'd like to see your freak show
You see, only by appreciating the variety and innovation of nature can we come to respect the fragile complexity of our global eco- system
Elijah nudges Ernie
And you come to me looking for weirdos
Ernie shrugs
He goes to take a bite out of his chocolate bar and finds only the empty wrapper left in his hand
Hey
What the-- He looks behind him, and there--about ten feet away--is
18
warts all over, squatting on the ground and chewing happily
This is
Julie and Rick turn and see him
() Eeuuuwww
(composes herself and ) Ahem
Hello
Toad doesn't respond to her waves
Mr
Toad is my
assistant
As for the show, 'm afraid the next parade of deformity isn't until tomorrow night
Rick and Ernie pretend to be disappointed
They turn to leave
Julie's sincerely upset
Oh, just our luck
Elijah grabs Rick's shoulder and turns him around
However
do have a private exhibit in my shed you might enjoy
don't usually share it with the general public
We're deeply honored
But no thanks
Yeah
We really must be-- He raises his cigarette to his lips, but it's gone
He turns to see Toad, ten feet behind him, puffing away happily
Hmmm
Elijah is already leading Julie towards the shed
The sideshow tradition has been misrepresented by the media
You don't traffic in human misery
You show society the part of itself it doesn't want to look at
19
Yes
Yesm  see
He looks over to Rick and Ernie with a grin that says "Where'd you find this nutty chick
" Rick shrugs and follows, taking Ernie with him
What the heck
We'll see some pickled dog brains, maybe some pictures of women with, you know, added equipment
And to think we could be in the limo with those stewardesses
Elijah holds the shed door open for them
It's pitch black inside
Julie enters
Rick and Ernie follow
What the hell, Coog, these people are weird, but they seem nice enough
sits outside the shed
Toad lashes out with his ten foot tongue, and sucks the bunny into his mouth
He shuffles into the shed, crunching contentedly
Elijah closes the shed doors in our face, grinning
we hear a lonq peal of   from inside
-----

- -----
--- -------- -
It's dark and spooky
Elijah stands in a pool of light, reading a Family Circus cartoon in the funny pages
---
God  love the Family Circus
How do they do it day after day
It's amazing
He turns to
, , 20
as Toad finishes strapping them onto massive Frankenstein- style operating tables
They struggle desperately against ( ) Well,  guess they do use the same joke over and over
'm just a sucker for that little moffet's shenanigans, that's all
(he tosses the funnies ) But perhaps  should tell you a little more about what  do
You see,  not only exhibit freaks, make them
Just like Michelangelo saw the angel in the stone,  look at a guy like Kevin Costner and see a giant peach grub who can fart the Blue Danube
(mops brow, asks ) Am  crazy or is it hot in here
Rick, Julie, and Ernie shoot him a look that pretty well answers his question
Elijah shrugs and goes back to his spiel
Behold
The Tasty Freekz machine
He pulls a tarp off a huge complicated machine
Several drums and vats of various chemicals feed through a crude network of pipes, gadgets and computers into an old Tasty Freeze soft serve ice cream machine (The logo has been changed to "Tasty Freekz")
The biggest vat reads " 24
" My God
He's using Noxon Twenty- Four
Hey
You're not supposed to have that stuff
Oh
Well,  guess 'm not supposed to have these either
21
He holds up a matching towel and washcloth embroidered with the "Ramada Inn" logo
Rick, Julie, and Ernie gasp
He tosses the towels
As Elijah gets worked up into a frenzy, the ambience in the room becomes more and more horrific: the sunlight is replaced by an eerie green glow, a thunderstorm rumbles to life, a raven perches on the windowsill, a rat scurries across the floor, one of those plastic "Bony Banks" reaches out and grabs a quarter
need only punch a few buttons on this magnificent device, and it gives me an easy-to-apply ointment that will mutate a perfect young body, bubble its skin, warp its bones and twist its guts into , - Elijah's hair is now standing on end
He's foaming at the mouth
bolt of lightning and  cap the monologue
Wait a minute
Does this mean we're not going to see a show
( ) Toad, fire up that machine, and let's turn these hapless asswipes into monstrosities
, , () Now let's see
Who wants to get freaked first
(points at Julie) Ladies first
Go screw yourself
If  were you,  would
Hmmmm
22
Toad is adjusting some knobs on the machine
Elijah steps past him to a jerry-rigged computer console
He punches some keys and some rotating  models appear on the monitor
(mumbling to himself) It's like Yin and Yang
/
two birds with one stone
Yeah, it's pretty darn good, really
He presses "enter" and the computer beeps
He smiles
Let 'er rip, Toad
Toad yanks a pull-start cord and the machine rumbles to life
Elijah pulls the Tasty Freekz lever and fills a small dish with phosphorescent ointment
Toad cuts open their clothes, exposing their sides, and pushes them close together
Wait a second
You're really gonna smear that stuff on us and mutate our body parts
Correct
Well
then could you give me a really big rodney
'm a mad scientist pal, not a miracle worker
Elijah smears the ointment on their exposed sides
Their skin begins to bubble and undulate
/ Oh God
No
Holy shit
() grapefruit-sized lump pops up on Ernie's side, then another on Julie's side, and then the lumps do a little synchronized dance together
Suddenly Ernie's flesh balloons out and melds into Julie's side
The mass of connected skin continues to bubble and mutate
Odd shapes press up under : Four humans faces that quickly become Mount Rushmore
The Pepsi logo--"Pepsi: The Choice of a New Generation"
Julie and Ernie merge into one amorphous flesh blob which then takes the form of
23
Demon versions of  and his magic horse
Gumby's got his back to camera
He's grabbing his crotch and flipping everyone off
Gumby
Put that thing away
Gumby and Pokey mutate back into a blob and then into
/ joined side to side, their two heads on a single body which is split down the middle--half Julie, half Ernie
Elijah wheels a large mirror in front of them
Feast your eyes
Well, at least 'll never have to go far for a piece of tail
Pig
She  him
Ouch
was just trying to keep things light
Oh God
Why me
He starts blubbering uncontrollably
Toad drags them towards the door
Mother always said there'd be days like this
And  thought she was nuts
They exit
Elijah turns to Rick
(gestures to Julie/Ernie) mere party trick
But you, you're gonna be special
Elijah steps over to the computer console and starts punching keys
( ) Let me go, Skuggs, or else
() 24
got some (cont'd) friends that'll come down here and mess you up bad, homey
(Elijah chuckles
Rick tries a different ) got some other friends who can score you box seats at the Superbowl, no problem
( ) , '
(switches gears again) You ever had a hot fudge bath with Morgana
[foreign take: Madonna] ( --) You know her
Rick nods hopefully
Elijah considers it for a moment, then frowns
Ah, screw it
'd never get anywhere with her Toad starts the machine
Elijah pulls the lever and dispenses a bowl full of glowing ointment
He carries it towards Rick, leering maniacally
For years 've strived to create the ultimate monster
The first of a whole new generation of superfreaks
Now 've finally got you, the perfect subject--a real asshole
-- (he pauses and looks closer at Rick) Wait a minute
Aren't you the guy from "Hey Dude Three-The Beguiling
" Yeah, that's me
You were great in that picture
Oh well,  guess for the next one they'll have to get Christian Slater
--
25
Elijah squishes the ointment into Rick's horrified face
: - The barn looks especially sinister silhouetted against a big green moon
huge ball of flame belches out of the smoke stack
(
) : - It's eerily quiet in the dawn light
Extreme close-up of Rick's eye as it opens, and searches the room frantically
Close-up of Rick's hand--a normal hand-- straining at the bonds
's  groggily searches the lab, and picks up the blurred image of Elijah in the distance
He's on the phone, speaking in hushed tones
This is Red Swan
May  speak to the Laughing Man
Yes, 'll hold
For a moment, Elijah is entertained by hold music to the tune of "Freak Out," by Chic
man's laughing voice comes on the other end of the line
It laughs throughout the "conversation"
Laughing Man
Red Swan
've done it
found the perfect subject-- huge ego, shallow personality, almost no moral values lawyer
No, better
An actor
Yeah, the guy from those hilarious "Hey Dude" movies
Hahahaha-- Laughing man has stopped laughing
Elijah dummies up
26
() Well,  liked 'em
Laughing man resumes laughing
Elijah listens intently
(') Right
Yes
Yes,  see
But that's just it
He's not quite, uh, finished
need more Noxon so  can-- Laughing Man laughs so loudly Elijah has to hold the phone away
() Geez, what a grouch
Over on the slab, Rick groans
He's waking up
Elijah notices
(to Laughing man) Laughing Man
have to go
What about the Noxon
Two days
Great, you can see everything then
Yeah, you take it easy too
Elijah hangs up the phone, and strides over towards Rick
Wakey, wakey
Time to meet and greet the new you
Huh
He flips the slab right-side up, and holds up a mirror
Rick's eyes widen in terror as he beholds his hideous new form
Rick's left half has been transformed into a hideous, bug-eyed monster
AAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh
: - The doors fly open
Elijah drags Rick out
Horrified, Rick clutches the monster side of his face
27
Oh God
This was my good side
Still is if you ask me
Hell, even half-done, you'll be the star of the show tonight
Elijah stops in front of the tiny outhouse
(') Welcome to your spacious accommodations
He unlocks the door and drags Rick in
Oddly, the interior is a vast barracks, fifty feet long and thirty feet high
Rick looks around
() Great use of the space
learned it all from Bob Vila
walks up next to Elijah
You know you could expose those rustic beams and put in a skylight over one weekend, Elijah
Give it a rest, Bob
He pushes Bob away into the freak house, gives Rick a goodbye wink and walks out the door
Elijah pauses and looks at the tiny outhouse
One of these days  gotta put a shitter in there
Bob Vila steps out of nowhere again, holding a Time-Life book
28
No problem
It's all here in my Beds and Bathrooms book, Elijah
And you pay nothing for thirt-- Elijah knocks him out cold with a ball-peen hammer from his tool belt
It takes a few moments for Rick's eyes to adjust to the dim light
There's nobody in sight
The walls are lined with dark cubicles, stacked atop each other with walkways like prison cells
Rick staggers to his feet, and makes his way forward
Ernie
Julie
Over here, Coog
Are you alright
Rick sees the vague outline of JulieErnie a few yards away
know that voice
That's the voice that said, () "Cool, a freak show
Let's check it out
" What
Oh sure, blame the woman
Typical
() "It's so real
" Is this real enough for you
'm friggin' Quasimodo
Chill out, Coog
You're talking to the original tag team of ugly pukes
Step into the light
Okay, here  come
29
Rick steps forward into a pool of light
Julie and Ernie are caught by surprise
Julie struggles to keep her composure
Ernie's repulsed
Ernie turns away and pukes on the floor
Julie soldiers on
Oh geez
It's not so () revolting
After all, physical beauty is just a socially-enforced myth that we, uh, oh shit Julie turns away and pukes on the floor
() Yeah, well, you're no Mona Lisas yourself
You're lucky 've got a strong stomach

) And you're lucky  don't  you
Heh heh heh heh
Rick wheels around to see    , snickering behind him
Juan is a hairy young Mexican with a snout, dog ears, and canine teeth--Scrappy Doo with an attitude
Rick assumes a threatening pose
Get away from me you, you
Freak
Ha ha hahahaha
(he stares hard at Rick) am Juan the Dog Boy, leader of the freaks
(walks up to them) Kind of the "top dog
" Juan scratches himself behind the ear with his hind leg
Welcome to Hell, Rick
Shake
He extends a hand to Rick
Rick doesn't take it
He hears a slight  noise from the direction of the cubicles, and turns to look around the apparently empty Freak House
30
No thanks
don't plan on staying long
How many of you are there in here anyway
Juan shrugs mischievously and sticks his snout in Rick's face
First,  have a question for you, Ricardo
Who starred in the film "International Velvet
" Huh
Well, perhaps we should ask the Worm
The top right cubicle lights up, revealing the
He is a man with no arms and legs, and the wrinkly, slimy body of a worm
His face is learned-looking, with spectacles, a small goatee, and a pipe which he puffs on pompously
Tell us, Worm, who starred in "International Velvet
" He puffs pensively on his pipe for a second
Yes, yes
very interesting
International Velvet
The perfectly appalling sequel to National Velvet,  believe
No dramatic verisimilitude whatsoever
Yes, Worm
But who was the star
The worm takes a long, thoughtful drag on his pipe
Olivia DeHavilland
Olivia DeHavilland
Rick, do you agree or disagree
This is nuts
This is crazy
Besides, it was Tatum 'Neill
31
Very good
It was Tatum 'Neill, now married to tennis star John McEnroe
Circle gets the square
The lights come on in 9 of the center cubicles, silhouetting 9 freaks in a full size   3 x 3 layout
The applaud Rick's success
He's incredulous
Yayyy
Worm nudges an "0" into place in his cubicle, with some difficulty
He's not happy about being proved wrong
Blast
'Neill
No talent ragamuffin
okay, JulieErnie, your turn
Who's it going to be
As Juan names the freaks one by one, their square is highlighted, and they wave at Rick cheerily
(') Nosey the Nose Man
is a man whose massive nose dominates his head
He blows into a huge hanky, and waves it wearily at Rick
() Cowboy
is a young boy with cow-like features, a cowboy hat, cowboy clothes, and a full set of udders
(-) The Bearded Lady
The   is a big, tough, bearded man--in a blouse
He has lipstick, earrings, and tattoos on his muscular arms
(gruff and masculine) How ya' doin
Sockhead
is a freak with a large button-eyed sock puppet for a head
He's munching cookies which ,spill uselessly out of his throatless sock mouth
32
The Human Torch
The   is a man engulfed in flames
He waves apathetically
Rosie the Pinhead
is a pinhead in dark sunglasses
She has a great bod jammed into a sexy dress
She smokes a cigarette demurely, and waves a small, arrogant big-star wave
The hideous Frog Man
Frogman is just a guy in a scuba outfit
He strikes a threatening "monster" pose, then gives a friendly wave
And of course, in the center square, Mr
Paul Lynde
Suddenly the lighting changes to flashing red horror lights with plenty of dark shadows
There's a horrific and we   to a   in the center cubicle
Its eyeball drips out of the socket
Well JulieErnie, who will it be
Call me old-fashioned, but 'll go with Paul Lynde
Don't be an idiot
They argue back and forth, hitting and poking each other 3 Stooges style
Juan turns to Rick
You see, Rick
Just because we're freaks doesn't mean we can't have some fun, huh
Rick is overwhelmed by it all
He backs away
Get away from me
Get away
'm not like you
You hear me
'm Ricky Coogan
33
The Freaks laugh in Rick's face
He storms off
: -- Rick sits in a corner, pondering his fate
Oddly, there's a shiny new Pepsi machine in this dingy corner of the Freak House
JulieErnie approach him
Okay Coog, so  get twenty four hour access to  `n' , and you look like a plate of rancid giblets
We're still pals, right
Rick shoots him a look
All the freaks have gone through this anguish, Rick
At first, was blinded by my anger
admit it
wanted to break your neck for getting me into this
But got over it
Juan taught me to channel my anger for the common good
It was your fault, anyway
You wanted to see the freak show
() She tries to wring his neck
Ernie helps
Rick glares at Ernie
Ernie
Oh
Sorry, Coog
For a second there,  was a total man-hater
Weird
Julie regains her cool
She takes out a pamphlet, scribbles something on it, and hands it to Rick
Here
Take it
Rick examines the cover
He reads it aloud
34
"So You're a Hideous Mutant Freak-- Now What
" There's an "8" scribbled on the pamphlet
we're in cubicle eight
Maybe later you'll be ready to talk
Forget it
Not me
'm not like those other god-forsaken animals
He throws the-pamphlet to the ground, just as the Worm, Bearded Lady, and Sockhead approach
They sit down in a circle around him
The Worm looks down at the pamphlet and puffs thoughtfully on his pipe
You're mistaken, Rick
You are exactly like us
We were all normal healthy folk before we made the fateful mistake of visiting this hell hole at an off hour
Why, when  first came here
: - The Worm, as an  , is wandering around the grounds, taking notes and puffing on his pipe
(
) was a professor of lacrophylogy-- er, the study of worms, of course
came in search of the Epsosophecci dilepsidae--in layman terms, the fat pudgy worm
Mr
Skuggs said he had just such a worm in his shed
How could  have surmised that the specimen and would ultimately prove to be one and the same
We see professor Worm meet Elijah, and follow him into the lab
The smoke stack belches a plume of flames as we hear his off-camera screams
back to
-- The Worm finishes his tale
35
At first, the transformation was fabulous
truly understood the worm's ethos like never before
But those early days of fascination are over
Now, in retrospect, think the whole thing is a fucking headache
'd sell my soul just to be able to wipe my own ass
He sniffles a little, but manages to hold back the tears
We pan to Sockhead
first came here as a tourist, looking for some fun
: - lanky , obviously Sockhead in better days
He approaches Elijah
(
) Anyway, then Elijah turned me into a sock
That's it
- Sockhead shrugs apologetically
Sorry
'm not much for stories
The camera moves in on the
When  arrived here,  was nothing like  am now
: - The bearded lady (as a man) steps out of the cab of his eighteen-wheeler
He looks very much like he does now, except he has no lipstick or earrings
36
(
) was confused--a walking contradiction, so full of questions
- He finishes his story
/ Now  know who  am
can say, "Hey world
This is me
'm a woman
And  like me
" The others look at the bearded man uneasily
The camera pans past the Bearded Lady, and moves in on an ordinary lying on the ground
: - Happy music
The hammer is placed on a shelf by a friendly The music turns tense as Elijah appears and scans the shelf
He makes eye contact with the hammer, and smiles
He grabs the hammer roughly and shoves it in a plastic bag
Darkness
- The bag opens, Elijah reaches in and takes out the hammer
The music turns to Psycho-like string stabs as Elijah uses the hammer to smash in a nail
- Everyone looks at the hammer sympathetically
Rick turns away to wipe a tear from his eye
You are one of us now, Rick
Whether you admit it or not
It's irrefutable
Yeah
Says you
The worm shakes his head
The freaks turn and head back to their cubicles
Rick exchanges a look with Julie before she and Ernie turn and head off
37
Rick is left alone, staring pensively at the hammer
: Hours later, Rick is still staring at the hammer
He picks it up and stares at it more closely
: Hours later
Rick is still staring at the damn hammer
He nods with resolve
( ) You're right
He spots the pamphlet on the ground, picks it up, dusts it off
He opens it and begins to read, under the heading "1
It's Fun Being Ugly
"
Rick closes the pamphlet, looks at the number "8" Julie scribbled, and nods with a sense of purpose
Standing up, he throws the hammer carelessly aside into the muck, and walks towards the cubicles
: - Rick walks past the cubicles
In one, the Bearded Lady knits a sweater
He reaches cubicle 8, and is about to speak when he hears Julie giggling
There is a man's voice, but not Ernie's
It's Juan
Rick peeks around and sees Julie scratching Juan's belly
He licks her face happily, and she giggles with delight
Ernie is reading "The Woman's Room," trying not to notice all of this
Rick watches, disgusted
He tears up the pamphlet, throws it to the ground, and storms off to find his own cubicle
Ernie peeks at Julie and Juan continuing their foreplay
Juan stops abruptly
Hey
Mind your business
Sorry
38
Ernie returns to his book
The camera  up to Rick's cubicle
He's sitting on his cot, distractedly whittling a log with his knife-like talon
He talks to himself, making sure to be loud enough for JulieErnie and Juan to hear
Well that  guy should rescue me any minute
Then it's straight to the plastic surgeon and back to sunny old
wonder how many of my beautiful, anatomically correct girlfriends will be waiting for me
(
) 'll be waiting for you, Rick
Thanks, Stuey
Rick looks up and sees a holographic image of Stuey Gluck floating in the air above him
phantom troll
He swings the log wildly at the hologram, but it keeps darting around, dodging the blows
Cowboy leans around the cubicle wall
He talks a lot like Gomer Pyle
() Seeing phantom trolls, Rick
() No
Rick stops swinging, lamely pretends he was stretching, and ignores Stuey, who hovers around him
Sounds to me like you've developed a telepathic bond
Don't mean yer nuts or nuthin'
Heck, old Nosey, why he can smell the future
Lots of us freaks got
And Sockhead, he's got
He points at Sockhead, who's watching pro wrestling on a portable
Watch out, Hulk
He's gonna try the skull cracker
39
Shucks, Rick, you're lucky
Telepathy like yours only occurs between real soulmates
bond like that should be cherished
Cowboy smiles and ducks back into his own cubicle
Wow
'm Ricky Coogan's soulmate
In your dreams
Now get lost, troll
He swings wildly at the hologram, which starts to break up and fade away
( ) Wait'll  tell the kids at school
Stuey disappears
Cowboy leans into Rick's cubicle again
Shucksm Rick, it don't make sense to spurn your soulmate
reckon that troll could help you if you just let him into your heart
Rick scoffs at him and starts whittling again
: '  - It's a cramped room filled with Ricky Coogan memorabilia
Stuey is drawing a crude sketch of Rick on a pad
This sequence is set to brassy "man on a mission" music
Once America sees what happened to Ricky, they'll probably send the whole  down to save him
: Stuey marches towards a frosted glass door that reads " "
40
'll probably win a Pulitzer prize for this scoop
And 'll dedicate it to Rick
He walks through the door
Beat
He comes flying out through the glass and lands on his butt
" " --
Stuey flies out through it
"
" --
Stuey flies out through it
"  " --We see Stuey and an silhouetted against the glass
(

) Of course 'll print it
America needs to know
Burt
Give mister Gluck his fee and show him out
(
0
) That's okay
know the way
Stuey dives through the glass door
: - Stuey proudly reads the weekly world News
The front page features Stuey's story and his sketch of Rick
( ) "Freaky Deaky
Ricky Coogan's a mutant in South America
By Stuart Gluck
" (to  ) That's me
Suddenly two  in dark suits snatch the paper away from Stuey
They grab him and force him into a limousine
The Goons hold Stuey in between them
'He's terrified
we hear the low, menacing chuckle of the Laughing Man, who's off screen
The camera is his
Heh heh heh heh hehh heh
41
Sure  wrote the article
But-- Ha-ha-ha
No
You've got it all wrong don't know anything about that
You gotta believe me
Ho-ho-hahahaha hee hee hoohaaa
cruises off down the street
We hear a  , Stuey's , and Laughing Man's hearty  from inside
: '  - Rick has whittled his log down to a toothpick
He admires it, then leans over and fits it into an intricate three-foot scale model of the Eiffel Tower, made entirely out of toothpicks
The Human Torch walks by
Wow, what a great model
(he points at a toothpick) But look, this one's crooked
He reaches out to fix it and--
The whole model burns to a cinder
Rick looks at him hatefully
() Sorry
Elijah steps into the freakhouse
Alright, freaks
Get ready for the glamour
Get ready for the glitz
Get ready to be pelted with rotten vegetables, 'cause it's showtime
: 42
Elijah, looking natty in his Ringmaster suit, stands at the entrance, barking to various people who are drifting in
It's grisly
It's revolting
It'll make you wish you were dead
And at just twelve bucks a head, you can bring all the kids
We follow a   through the curtained entrance
He collapses, a knife embedded in his chest, revealing the total mayhem
The motley crowd (, sleazy looking , rogue , wayward , and  , etc
) is brawling and drinking and having a heck of a time
Some small displays and a few carnival booths are set up around the sides of the tent
There's a " " where a  is petting a two-tailed-no-headed dog
And there's a "  " where a  is french kissing a six- legged goat
sits in a dunk tank, heckling the customers
The sign says "
" 'mon, my granny could throw better than you
He's talking to an  , who throws a baseball, hits the target, and dunks the clown into the foaming bath of carbolic acid
We hear his gurgling screams, then his bony hand reaches up out of the bath
Elijah walks out on stage and looks at the rowdy audience
It's total mayhem
() Quiet, please
Everyone instantly sits down, shuts up, and looks up obediently at Elijah
43
Thank you
Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to witness a cavalcade of atrocities so horrific,  advise the more sensitive members of our audience to leave the premises
Two    wearing sweaters draped over their shoulders politely get up and leave
Tonight 'm proud to announce the addition of several new monstrosities to the show, including our star attraction, the Beast Boy--an untamed and highly dangerous ghoul who's liable to go nuts and kill us all at the drop of a hat
(impressed "oohs", "ahhs", and "cools" from the ) But first up, prepare to behold an unspeakably repulsive yet heartwarming atrocity, Three Men and a Baby
, all fused into a single multi-limbed freak, walks out onstage
One of its arms holds up a dirty diaper, and all the three men hold their noses and grimace
The audience breaks into warm-hearted laughter and applause
The freaks mill around in the caged-in green room, guarded by Toad
Frogman, dressed in a magician's outfit over his wetsuit, holds an empty dove cage and searches the room, whistling for his missing dove
Nosey sneezes up a cloud of feathers
JulieErnie walk determinedly towards the adjacent Men's and Women's restrooms
They hit the wall between the two doors
Rick is reading his "script", rehearsing his lines
He's wearing a cheesy "jungle" costume
Arrrggg
am Beast Boy
will eat you
Arrrghh
(he throws down the ) can't do this shit
He peers through the bars, scanning the audience for signs
of a rescue party
44
Damn it
What's keeping those guys
The Worm creeps up behind Rick
Something's troubling you, my boy
what is it
Well, let's see
've been kidnapped, hideously disfigured, imprisoned with a bunch of mutant freaks, my rescue party is
, and this dialogue makes "Hey Dude Three" read like "Dr
Zhivago
" think  know what you're going through
too had an eating disorder
You see, 've always had a feverish obsession with pudding
And when  was a young lad
Rick groans and looks out at the audience
onstage
And now a perennial favorite here at Freakland, ladies and gentlemen
know you'll all enjoy the musical stylings of Rosie the Pinhead
Rosie the Pinhead struts out wearing a sexy dress and holding a microphone
After the applause dies down, she whips off her sunglasses with a flourish, revealing her extremely goofy- looking crossed eyes
She wails incomprehensibly and bonks her head with the mic
() series of  show bits of various acts as the evening : / are doing a Vaudeville style stand-up routine while tap dancing
45
Hey Julie, how many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb
How many
Two
One to screw it in and one to ride my Rodney
Ha-ha-ha
Oaf
She bonks him with their cane
He bonks her back
She knocks him cold
They both fall down
is doing a make-over demonstration
He's got a local from the audience sitting at a makeup table onstage
If your coloring is in the autumn range, like Maria's, try an earth tone eye makeup
Now 've done a lovely French braid on Maria, but encourage everyone to experiment and use your imagination
The main thing is to just have fun with it
The audience is engrossed
Some take notes
is ringing those "tuned bells" and singing along
Edelweiss, Edelweiss
He takes a bow but his sock is snagged on the mic stand
It pulls off and reveals a normal-sized hand where the sockhead was--he's actually a hand-head
The audience gasps gets up and points accusingly
He's got a hand under there
It's a hoax
Sockhead realizes he's unveiled and tries to hide his hand- head with his other hands
The crowd starts jeering and pelting Sockhead with rotten vegetables
He gives them the finger with all three hands
Elijah tries to calm them
46
Puppetteering is an admirable skill in its own right
Give him his due
Where's the beast boy you promised us
Bring on the beast boy
We want the beast boy
(etc
) The Worm is still talking to Rick
We can hear the crowd screaming for him in the background
And when  won first prize, they never called me pudding-head again
So
Don't you see
You must turn your hardship into inspiration
You're an actor, Rick
Your body is your instrument, and with it you must play your tragic symphony for all the world
Rick is really moved
Elijah pokes his head backstage
( ) They're going nuts for you, Beast Boy
You better go out there now
He starts to take off his jungle costume
(determined, inspired) 'll be right there
( ) Thank you Worm
don't really know how  can repay you for this
() You could wipe my ass
(thinks Worm is joking) Ha-ha
Always the wit, eh Worm
47
Rick claps him on the back and walks off
Worm is disappointed
( ) Damn
(he turns to Nosey) Nosey, have  ever told you what a gifted artist you are
Nosey gives him a worried look
The spotlight reveals Rick, centerstage, poised in Shakespearean garb
The crowd quiets down and focuses on Rick with great respect and awe
truly dramatic silence
Rick pauses for effect and then launches into a soliloquy with bravura
Now is the winter of our discontent, Made glorious summer by this son of York, But  that am not shaped for sportive tricks, Nor made to court an amorous looking glass, , that am curtailed of this fair proportion, Cheated of feature by dissembling nature, The audience is riveted
Even Spanish-speaking peasants are mouthing the words
Elijah, however, thumbs through his script, totally confused
The freaks watch through the bars from the wings--completely engrossed, especially Julie
Juan notices this and pulls her closer to him, but she pushes him away
We move in on an erudite British gentlemen in the crowd
By God
It's
He turns to camera
Subtitle: ( ) If you're having trouble understanding Mr
Coogan's brilliant reading of this soliloquy from Richard the Third, please take advantage of the handy subtitles for the culturally illiterate
48
sitting next to Cooke is trying to listen to Rick
He turns angrily to Cooke
Cooke turns back to the stage
The words in brackets appear as
Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time, {' } Into this breathing world, scarse half made up, {'  } And that so lamely and unfashionable, That dogs bark at me as  halt by them
{'  ' -,
} Why , in this weak piping time of peace, {, , } Have no delight to pass away the time, {
} Unless to see my shadow in the sun, And descant on mine own deformity
{ ' } Rick bows
The crowd bursts into applause
They yell "Bravo" and throw bouquets
Rick takes several curtain calls
The freaks cheer for him
Julie is particularly moved--she and Rick exchange a heavy look, laden with romantic potential
: We will insert an almost subliminal one-frame shot of the Pepsi logo at this triumphant moment
Kevin, the  executive from the airport scene, walks into the tent
Rick sees him and gasps with joy
He leaps off the stage, runs up to Kevin and hugs him
Kevin is shocked, of course
Overcome by the moment, Rick regresses to his old self
'm saved
Haha
You sorry mutants are gonna rot in this hole while 'm sipping mint juleps by the pool
{   '  , ' } The freaks and the audience gasp at Rick's cruelty
Julie is shocked--Juan gives her an " told you so" look
Rick sees Julie and catches himself
49
( ) mean, um,  hope you have room for all my friends, heh-heh
Rick, Rick, listen,  really love this new look you've come up with
But just between you and me, don't think the guys upstairs would really get it
What are you saying
( ) 'm saying you're ugly enough to burn the nosehairs off a dead nun
The crowd bursts into cruel hysterics, pointing mockingly at Rick
Even Alistair Cooke is practically choking with laughter
---
Rick looks around, horrified at the sea of evil, jeering faces
He begins to tremble
Then
' springs to life for the first time and glows red with rage
His whole monster side awakens and takes charge of his body with violent intensity
He grabs Kevin's head and screams in a new, monstrous voice
He plucks Kevin's head off his neck and holds it aloft
The head stares down at Rick in disbelief
' Now you're just being childish
Rick serves the head like a volleyball, smashing it to bits
The crowd panics and charges for the exits
People are trampling over each other in the mayhem
Alistair Cooke is crushed under the stampede
50
The freaks are horrified
Monster Rick growls triumphantly
Elijah looks on, intrigued
Now that's entertainment
- Rick awakens with a start and gets up
He approaches JulieErnie, The Bearded Lady, Nosey and Dog Boy, who are idly playing a game of "Wheel of Fortune
" The cubicles contain large blank blocks, like the "letters" on the game show
So far, there's a "", two ""s, and a "" revealed
Rosie the Pinhead plays Vanna White's role
'd like to buy a vowel
The Bearded lady yawns
Rick edges towards them
Hey
The Wheel
Mind if  sit in
Juan advances towards Rick, sneering
So
Now you don't mind mixing with us--how did you say it--sorry mutants
Look
'm sorry for what happened at the show
Can't you just forget it
He shakes his finger at Juan, and notices there's still a human nose stuck on his monster claw
He wipes it off, embarrassed
There's an awkward pause
Ernie breaks the silence
Hey, shouldn't you tell Rick about your big escape plan
Juan gives Ernie a nasty "shut up" look
He growls at him
Well, excuse me for living
You have an escape plan
Listen, Beast Boy, the games are a simple diversion
() 51
(') Beneath our twisted flesh we freaks cry out for freedom
Aooooooorrraaaagh
Juan howls lustily
He looks to rest of the freaks
They're a pathetic lot, and their half-hearted howl proves it
Aoo
Beat
Juan's plan is really ingenious Rick
See, he figured out that-- figured out that our escape does not include the Beast Boy
No one may discuss the plan with him, understand
Juan gives the others a threatening look
They mumble agreement
What's the matter with all of you
You trust your lives to a guy just 'cause he can lick his own privates
The freaks ponder this a second, then nod "yes"
You gotta admit, Coog, it's a helluva trick
() Fine
'll just come up with an escape plan of my own then
Haha
have spent a year studying this hellhole, devising the perfect escape
You think you'll just tango right out the door
Ha
Just try it, amigo
will
Rick turns to go
JulieErnie rush over and try to reason with him quietly
52
Rick, wait
Yeah
Don't go off half-cocked
Believe me, it ain't all it's cracked up to be
This isn't one of your dumb movies, Coogan
Look, Juan's a good dog, a smart dog
'll talk to him
Don't be stupid, Rick
You can't do it without us
Forget it
don't need you, , or anybody else
'll get out of here all by myself, you
you
,
crud sucking pus monkeys
The letters in the Wheel of Fortune board light up, and  turns them over to reveal "Crud Sucking Pus Monkeys" as the secret phrase
Everyone claps despite themselves
Juan stares them down
They stop
Rick storms off in a huff
Juan takes Julie's hand and gazes deep into her eyes
He kisses her passionately
Julie is watching Rick leave
Juan nibbles her neck, which gets her attention
She scratches Juan behind his ear
His leg instinctively kicks the air
Ernie looks worried
'm getting a bad feeling here
: - Out of sight from the others, Rick approaches the rear door and tries it
It doesn't open from the inside
Damn
He peers out through a crack in the door and sees a getting out of his truck in the driveway
( ) Psst
Hey, you
Milkman
53
The milkman looks over at the outhouse, suspicious
Yeah
(
0
) Just the man 'm lookinq for
Be a pal, and give me a hand will ya
Oooh no
know you freaks
You'll try anything just to get someone to open that door
Well not me
Ha
He's about to walk away
Okay
Guess 'll just have to milk the world's biggest breasted woman all by myself
Sorry to bother you
The milkman stops in his tracks
He tiptoes over to the back door of the outhouse, listening intently as Rick goes into his "act
" (in a lusty womanish ) Ooohh
Milk me
Milk me now
Milk me hard
(Normal Rick voice) 've only got two hands, all right
Geez
don't care if Elijah did give you skim milk on the right side, chocolate on the left, and eggnog in the middle
The milkman is salivating at the door
( ) Gee,  love eggnog
The milkman opens the door eagerly and steps inside
Beat
Hey, what the-- We hear the sound of bottled buttermilk beaning his soft noggin
Rick walks out wearing the milkman outfit complete with the little six-milk-bottle-carrier thing
54
He looks around and heads for the milk truck, whistling casually
He notices something
It's
Its big eyes are staring at Rick (note: there's a skywriter plane in the distance behind the head, which finishes writing "     : ") Rick gets to the truck and tries the door
It's locked
Shit
He looks over at the giant head
The eyes are still staring at him--they seem to have shifted
Rick shrugs it off and looks around
He walks over to Elijah's car
It's locked too
He checks the big eyes
They've moved again
Rick's getting a bit desperate
He sees something else and runs towards it
It's a dry-docked motorboat
It's locked too
The eyes have followed Rick again
He sees something else and runs over to it
It's a bag of golf clubs leaning against Elijah's porch
They're locked too
Damn
This guy doesn't trust anybody
He looks at the giant head- the eyes are gone, leaving only empty eyesockets
Rick hears behind him, spins around and faces
with little arms and legs, wearing Jamaican Rasta hats and aiming smoking Uzi 9mms in the air
They aim their Uzis at Rick
One holds a walkie-talkie, the other holds a big spliff
in Elijah's hands, shows Rick staring at us, the Eye's
seen in extreme close-up, watches the surveillance monitor
He speaks into a microphone
We don't see what the room looks like
Good work, Eye and Eye
55
bob in response to Elijah
They have no mouths, but their pupils open and close when they speak
( ) Rastafari
(
0
) (over the walkie-talkie) Now bring the Beast Boy to my, uh, den
Ha-ha-ha-ha
Rick looks worried as they lead him towards the scary looking house
' It's a lovely, suburban den with a coffee table full of magazines like "Better Homes and Gardens," "National Review" and "Freaks Illustrated"
Elijah sits in a big Barcalounger, smoking a pipe
Rick sits on the sofa
Toad walks up with a tray of soft drinks
( ) Diet soda
No thanks
Elijah points to a bowl of Fiddle Faddle
Toad sits beside Rick
Fiddle Faddle
(Rick shakes his head) You sure
Well, okay
(he scoops some into his ) Well, are you gonna torture me or kill me or something
Torture my greatest creation ever
Kill the final piece of the puzzle that 've been putting together for years
Sure, it'd be fun, but 've got a bigger plan, my boy
() 56
(') And when you ripped off that guy's head,  knew it was working like gangbusters
But  thought  scared everyone away
Uh-huh
And then they told two friends, and they told two friends, and so on, and so on
Look at this
Elijah grabs a big mail bag and spills some letters out on the table
Elijah opens one and reads it
() Dear Mister Skuggs,  was shocked and disgusted when my grandson told me about the head-popping beast at your show
Please send me six tickets
(he reads another) Dear Beast Boy,  used to like New Kids on The Block, but you're way cuter
My favorite ice cream is chocolate
Is it fun ripping people's heads off
love you
( ) The Beast Boy is on a blood-letting spree, and Oscar is along for the ride
(he looks up at Rick) That one's from Pat Collins
Yeah, but she loves everything
Rick reaches for the Fiddle Faddle but the bowl is empty
Toad
Toad
That Fiddle Faddle is for guests only
You've had enough
Toad is blankfaced
Elijah walks over and refills the bowl
Rick scoops some into his mouth
Elijah walks to the fireplace and pushes the embers around with a poker
Look Skuggs--Elijah--'ve been in show business all my life
The public does not want to see disgusting, depraved violent filth
57
Oh, and  suppose Jake and the Fatman is just a fluke
The phone rings
Elijah looks at it, and back to Rick
(') 'll get it
He goes over to the phone and lifts the receiver
`Yello
On the other end of the line, we hear  's insane chuckle
Elijah's smooth smile fades
He turns his back to- Rick, who strains to identify the familiar laughing voice
Elijah scribbles notes on a pad by the phone
Yes
Right
Tomorrow
Mmhmm
Mnunhmm
Wow
Okay
You got it
Hasta la vista to you too
Hahaahahaahaha-- Laughing Man hangs up on Elijah
He looks a little pissed- off as he turns to face Rick again
Grumbling, he takes the poker in hand, and pokes at the coals angrily
Okay, Coogan
'm finished with you for now
Ricky rises and snatches the notepad just before Elijah spins to face him
(') But listen
may not be "Mr
Tinseltown", but  damn well know what  like
You're gonna be a hideous killing machine, and that's final
Tomorrow night 'll finish the job onstage
And then, to demonstrate your horrible power, you'll slaughter all the old obsolete freaks in cold bl--
Elijah thrusts the red hot fire poker out and
He catches Toad's ten foot tongue--curled around the searing poker inches from the Fiddle Faddle
58
told you enough
: ' Elijah shows Rick out the door
The Eyes scurry out and leap back into the sockets in the giant head
Bye-bye
And remember, try another escape, and 'll feed your balls to Toad
As he walks towards the Freak House, Rick pulls out the note he pocketed
gust of wind blows it away from him
He chases it behind the carnival tent where
He runs into   , backing their way around the corner, each carrying their own six-pack of milkbottles
Startled, they turn around
Why, it's the freaks
And they're all dressed as milkmen
Cowboy carries the hammer, who's dressed in a little milkman suit as well
Hey Rick,  thought you were gonna come up with your own escape plan
( ) This is your big plan
dozen milkmen
Isn't that a little unusual
Juan hadn't thought of this
He pushes himself forward and confronts Rick viciously
Twelve milkmen is theoretically possible
Thirteen is silly
Looks like one milkman too many, Coogan
He pushes Rick aside
The freaks continue past him
Fine then
Go ahead
Hope you like reggae, ya flea bitten bastard
Rick watches as the Freaks approach the open courtyard, where he knows the Eyeballs will spot them
59
Julie glances at him a second, then looks away
His mind made up, Rick takes a deep breath
Ah, shit
He runs over to the Freaks
He stands in Juan's way
Look, you'll all be killed
You don't know about Elijah's giant Rasta eyeballs with machine guns
(they think he's nuts) It's suicide
can't let you do it
And  can't let you stop us
This is it
Rick and Juan square off
Juan growls and bares his teeth
Rick's   starts to glow and pulse dimly
They circle each other
The others are transfixed
' He peers through a side window, and sees the pack of milkmen cheering two of their coworkers, locked in mortal combat
That's a lot of milkmen on the same route
No wonder they fight
Juan rears back, about to lunge, when suddenly he freezes and looks off into the distance
is sitting innocently a few yards off
Squirrel
He zooms off after the squirrel
The Eyes pop out of the giant head and follow after him, Uzis
Juan dodges their bullets and disappears after his prey
The freaks watch their best chance of freedom run off after a pesky rodent
They turn to Rick
Wow, giant Rasta eyeballs, just like Rick said
Gosh, if it wasn't for Rick, we'd all be dead
60
Yeah
Way to go Rick
Alright
( ) God,  can't believe he left you for a squirrel
What a dick
Julie's hurt
She doesn't even smack Ernie
You know how men are
Besides, it was a pretty good looking squirrel
Julie looks at Rick
She sees he's trying to be helpful, not sarcastic
(to the others) Come on
You heard the Beast Boy
Back to the Freak House, now
Her eyes meet Rick's
She manages a smile, and Rick smiles back
Ernie sizes up the situation and groans as they all head back to the Freak House
Not again
( ) Oh well, at least we'll get to try a new position
: We're moving in towards a door in this desolate, vaguely corporate looking hallway
We're looking at the back of Laughing Man's leather chair
We hear his , as well as  ' and a horrible
We can see the usual bright interrogation spotlight, and a couple of extra  watching the goings on, but Stuey and his actual torturer are hidden by Laughing Man's chair
(
) We move past Mr
Big's chair to reveal Stuey lying face down on a table, while Bob Vila is using a power sander on his butt
Bob is happily giving pointers to the two goons
61
Notice the way  use an elliptical motion to chafe Stuey's buttocks
(the Goons nod ) It's all here in my new book: Pipes, Fixtures, and Torturing -- (
) (Loud, sharp laugh) ------
Bob obediently shuts up
Laughing Man directs a sinister low chuckle to Stuey
No way
'll never talk
'm made of stone
Bob considers this a second, then starts up a jackhammer
: - We hear    as we pan past the cubicles
Cowboy is playing the harmonica
The Bearded Lady unties the pretty pink ribbon in his hair and sets it aside
Suddenly, we switch to    as the camera picks up  '  with flashing red lights
His eyeball drips out of the socket again
Then it's back to the
In the next cubicle, Ernie is sleeping, Julie is awake, dreamily fondling a large eclair
She looks longingly up towards Rick's cubicle as we
: Rick (his face is normal) and Julie kiss passionately in a billowy white bed amidst puffy clouds
62
() Julie, compared to this, sex with Julia Roberts was a thankless chore
: ' We follow her gaze, panning up to Rick
He's lying on his bed, dreamily fondling a donut
He looks down towards Julie's cabin
: Rick and Julie kiss passionately
We're tight on them
Oh Rick, you've touched a place in me no one has ever touched before
(
) 'll say
Almost punctured a kidney
to show Ernie, still attached to Julie, leering at Rick
Rick is mortified
: - Rick sits in his cubicle, visibly sickened by his daydream
Stuey's echoey voice drifts in
(
0
) Rick
Riiiicccck
holographic image of Stuey lying on the torture table appears over Rick
We can see the jackhammer looming over Stuey's face
Rick looks alarmed
Rick
Do something
It's up to you, Rick
Pleeeeeeease
(
) Aha-hee-hee-ho-ho-har-har-har
63
The Laughing Man
Rick watches the hologram break up and disappear
Wheels spinning in his head, he takes the crumpled piece of paper out of his pocket and reads it
(under his breath) Holy shit
/' Julie and Ernie are struggling over a bottle of deodorant
It says it's strong enough for a man
But it's made for a woman
She grabs it away and shoves it in Ernie's mouth
Rick walks in
Hey Rick
What's up
Read this
grabbed it from Skuggs' office
He hands her the notepaper
She reads it, with some difficulty
Ernie is still gagging on deodorant
"Tape Donahue
Renew Subscription to Beaver World
" Eeuw
She gives Rick a disgusted look
Ernie mumbles with the deodorant in his mouth
(interested, muffled) Beaver World
Julie smacks him--he swallows the deodorant
( ) After that
64
"Prepare demonstration for Laughing Man, receive five thousand barrels of Noxon
" Five thousand barrels
Elijah's up to something big, and we have to stop him
Ernie
Rick sniffs the air
Mmmm
Jasmine
: - Rick takes a deep breath, and begins his presentation to the freaks assembled before him
Alright guys, listen up-- Sockhead suddenly freaks out
We're done for
We're done for don't want to die
It's the end of the world
The apocalypse
Aahh
He stops
Everyone is staring at him
haven't said anything yet
Sorry
'm not much for timing
He takes his seat again
( ) Tomorrow night, at the show, 'll be turned into a homicidal monster and forced to kill you all
But we might have a chance if we act fast
And 'm prepared to be your new leader
65
( ) say we kill him
Sockhead nods
And 've got a plan
still say we kill him
Sockhead nods again
If we can get into Elijah's lab, maybe we can-- Of course
Design a super freak of our own and manipulate the genetic code to make him destroy Elijah instead of us
Brilliant
Oh
Well-- But how do we get to the lab
Um, maybe-- Right
The worm could dig a tunnel
By God, it's so crazy it might just work
But you need Noxon 24 to make the freaking sludge, and Elijah told us himself he's run out of it
Oh
Oh yeah
Well, see, what was going to say was-- 66
Yes
Exactly
If they've been using Noxon 24 as a fertilizer here, the entire ecosystem must be soaked with it
All we need is a way to extract it from the vegetation, ideally into a liquid form
Right
Well, what about-- Golly
So that's why my milk comes out that funny green color thought the grass tasted funny
Wow, Rick, you're a genius
( ) Good thinking, Rick
The freaks all nod in agreement
Way to go, Rick
How did you ever think of such a plan
Rick pulls out an old comic book and points to an ad for Sea Monkeys
Well, actually,  was going to suggest we send away for sea monkeys, train them to fire guns, and make a break for it
But if you want to go with this other thing,  guess that's okay
The freaks stare at him, not sure if he's kidding or not
: - ,     " "- -Nosey milks Cowboy, squirting the glowing milk into a funnel which feeds into a crude still
The Torch heats the boiler
-The Worm digs the tunnel
JulieErnie hand Rick pieces of wood which he puts into place as tunnel supports
They hand him Paul Lynde's corpse and he wedges it in as well
67
-Everyone's getting into it and working up a sweat
Nosey wipes his brow, opens a bottle of Pepsi and chugs it down in a beautifully lit slo-mo product shot
The other freaks follow suit, including the Worm, down in the tunnel, who struggles to hold the bottle in his tiny feeler
Everything's going great and the song is really pumping when
runs out on his front porch in his nightclothes and screams down at the outhouse
Nosey turns off a boom box and the music cuts short
The freaks exchange tense looks
Nosey calls out apologetically to Elijah
-
(to the freaks) What a jerk
The Worm burrows along, leaving a tunnel wide enough for Rick and JulieErnie to crawl after him
Rick notices a ray of light coming through a rock formation
Hey, look at this
They all stop and look
Rick fingers the hole, and the rocks cave in, revealing It's obviously a matte painting
Good Lord
It's the Lost City of Nodd
Wow
68
-
We hear the sound of a slide projector switching slides and the underground city is replaced by a still image of some tourists standing around a geyser
[foriegn version: the Blarney Stone]
It's Old Faithful
(foriegn take: "It's the Blarney Stone
"] They "Ooh" and "Ahh"
The image switches to a snapshot of a -
It's my Aunt Gladys
The other freaks nod politely
The image switches to a And that's me at my bar mitzvah
'mon Ernie, let's go
Wait, you gotta see the ones from sleep-away camp
They're hilarious
Julie smacks him
Stooge
- It's an "Antfarm View" of the yard, where the freaks are visible tunneling underground, and Toad is visible on the yard above them
We see a bat fly overhead
Toad shoots out his tongue, snags it out of mid air, and chews it happily, oblivious to the freaks burrowing right underneath him
Nosey looks at the nearly full container of distilled Noxon
Almost there
(he sniffs the air) But wait, 'm getting a whiff of things to come
69
What do you smell
() Blood
Bearded Lady looks grave
Nosey sniffs again
() And hot buttered popcorn
Awwright
They're burrowing along
Ernie loudly clears his throat
Julie spits out a loogie
She grimaces
hate when you do that
We hear muffled
Hey
Do you hear that
It's a dog
( ) Hurry
The Worm breaks through into a small cavern with several exposed sewer pipes
lovable mutt leaps out of a pipe and drops an old tennis ball in front of Rick
He starts licking Rick's face
Scrappy
wells up
It's been ten years since you chased this ball into the sewer thought you were gone for good
Yap
70
Listen Scrap
Go home
Get help
Understand
Yap
Good boy
Now go
Scrappy runs away into the sewer pipe
Rick shrugs
You never know
Julie taps on some exposed wood on the cavern ceiling
Look, a wood floor
It must be the lab
we've done it
They all look at each other excitedly
Suddenly Elijah's voice rings out behind them
' Not so fast, you scabrous freaks
They spin around and see Nosey holding the bottle of Noxon 24
He grins
Didn't know  did impressions, did ya
The freaks are waiting around the hole
Nosey pops out
Mission accomplished
They've got the Noxon, and they'll be in the lab within minutes
Boy, this is going like clockwork
Everyone smiles, pats each other on the back, etc
Except Sockhead, who finally snaps
No
Can't you see we're digging our own graves
() 71
It's nuts, (cont'd) that's what it is
Nuts
Well, maybe you've all got a deathwish, but you can count me out
' He runs amok, pushes various freaks to the ground, and runs around screaming
The freak house door opens--Eye and Eye step in to check out the noise
One of them has a spliff sticking out of its pupil
Sockhead charges at them like a mad dog
They aim their Uzis
(at the Eyes) --
They spray an ungodly amount of bullets into Sockhead
He falls to the ground
The Eyes leave
The freaks gather around Sockhead
Nosey pulls the sock off his hand head, which is making a little "Senor Pepe" face with its fist
It spits up a trickle of blood and tries to speak
() just
wanna
say
What is it, kid
Ah, forget it
'm not much for dying
He goes limp
: ' JulieErnie, the Worm, and Rick are just emerging from the hole
It's really dark in the lab
Shit
can't see a damn thing
Keep your voice down, Ernie
Don't push me, Coog
got a real short fuse today
'm cranky, bloated, got a wicked case of cramps
Don't ask why
72
(whispers to Rick) (has to think about this) Oh
Right
Rick pats Ernie on the shoulder reassuringly
He moves over to Elijah's computer terminal
(') Well, here it is--the control panel for Elijah's Freaking process
Good work, my boy
Now step aside
This is scientist's work
Worm muscles Rick out of the way and sits at the console
Using a pen held in his mouth, he flicks a series of switches and punches a fast series of computer keys
The light on top of the Tasty Freekz machine starts to revolve, and after a couple of seconds, a stream of oozes out of the spigot
Hey
It's working
You did it, Worm
Way to go
But how
You didn't even use the Noxon
The Worm rushes over to the container of glop below the spigot, and without hesitation, plunges his face into it
Rick, Julie, and Ernie gasp in horror
The  lifts his glop-smeared face out of the bowl, and smacks his lips in delight
Ah
You don't need Noxon to make Butterscotch pudding
just wanted to test the machine's capabilities
Mmmm
Glorious
So creamy
Yum
The Worm is lost in his pudding-induced reverie
They ignore him
Julie turns to Rick
73
Hang on, Rick
Do you really think we should put this toxic glop on you
What if it doesn't work
What if something goes wrong
What -- If it does work, do you think there'll be enough left over to give me a monster size rodney
Julie goes to doink Ernie in the eyes, but he uses the classic "Three Stooges" handblock
( ) Here, hold this
Rick hands the container of Noxon to Ernie
Julie gives him the eyepoke
Rick shakes hands with Julie, and takes back the Noxon
( ) Thanks
(to Julie, heroically) Look, 've been a freak all my life
'  realize that now
Up there on that screen, humiliating myself for every fool with six bucks in his pocket-- Seven bucks
Sometimes seven fifty
Alright
It doesn't matter
Sure it does
They don't let you into the theater if you don't pay the price of the ticket
Look, 'm talking about the ultimate human sacrifice
No kidding
When you consider money for parking, popcorn, drinks
74
The worm chimes in, still gorging himself on pudding
Don't forget a sitter for the children
Rick's had enough
Hey
In case you haven't noticed, 'm about to commit a noble and selfless act here
Rick pounds the table, sending a glass beaker flying
It smashes through the window, setting off a loud
' Elijah's in his robe, watching the opening of "Crooked Cops" on
On screen is a revolving police beacon on a beat-up car, with a loud
Elijah munches his popcorn happily
Julie manages to silence the alarm by yanking the cord out of its socket
She shoots Rick a hard look, he shrugs innocently
Oops
() Okay
Let's do what we came to do, and this time, no more screw ups
Rick slams his hand down for emphasis and impales it on one of those desktop paper pins
He  in agony
' Elijah's watching an old war movie--a soldier is running across a battlefield with a bayonet,
He doesn't hear Rick
Julie has her hand over Rick's mouth, silencing his scream
He calms down
He gingerly slides the pin out of his hand, grimacing but not making a sound
He sighs with relief
The coast seems clear
Then, in  , his hand knocks a styrofoam cup off the desk and onto the ground
75
' The war movie has erupted into a massive battle--machine guns blaring, grenade launchers and bazookas booming, the works
Suddenly, his ears perk up, and his head swivels around towards the window
Styrofoam cup
He puts on his "smiley face" robe and bunny slippers and heads out the door
Julie is pouring the distilled Noxon into the top of the Tasty Freekz machine
Don't you think we should make some more pudding first, as a test
No
Here goes
He presses some buttons on the computer, and the Tasty Freekz machine starts humming
Ernie is looking out the window
Somebody's comin'
Hurry
We have to wait
There's no way to speed up the machine
' Elijah comes out of the house and walks towards the lab
Rick's starting to sweat
He looks over at Julie, who holds an empty Pepsi cup under the Tasty Freekz spigot
drop of ointment drips out and into the container
Here it comes
begins to turn slowly
76
Everybody freezes
The flow of ooze slows to a stop
It's plugged up
They look over at the doorknob--it's still turning
( ) If it's your damn pudding, 'll ring your wormy neck
(under his breath) Preposterous
have no neck
'm a worm, imbecile
is still turning, agonizingly slowly
Elijah is trying to turn the knob,, His grip keeps slipping because of the butter on his fingers
Aaargh
Damn buttered popcorn
The spigot has started to discharge more,reliably
The Pepsi cup is filling up now
Elijah is wiping his hands off on his shirt tails
He tries the door knob again
We hear a low rumbling and the floor starts to shake
The tunnel walls are about to collapse
You go ahead
'll catch up
-- Go
77
The door knob is turning more vigorously, but still not opening
Julie and Ernie get in the hole with Worm, while Rick attends to the almost-full Pepsi cup of sludge
Elijah is still having trouble with his grip
Rick pops the plastic lid onto the Pepsi cup, and climbs into the hole
He rests the cup on the floor and lifts the floor board over his head
The  gets louder as the tunnel walls start to crumble
Rick
Come on
Rick is losing his balance as the ground shifts beneath him
He sways, and knocks the Pepsi cup of sludge rolling
He watches, helpless, as it rolls across the floor and comes to a stop across the room
For a second, he contemplates making a dash
Elijah has wrapped his shirt tails around the knob, and finally has a good grip
He twists the knob
Rick sees the door opening
He dives down into the hole
The floor board falls into place just as Elijah walks in
Elijah scans the room
He goes over towards the Tasty Freekz machine and finds the styrofoam cup
Bad for the environment
He crumples it in his hand
The "antfarm view" again
We see the freaks running back through the tunnel as it caves in behind them
Toad sits on the ground above, oblivious to them
We hear a low flying aircraft
Toad shoots his tongue up out of frame and sucks the twin engine Cessna into his mouth
Beat
He and spits up a propeller
78
The freaks wait by the mouth of the tunnel
We hear the rumble approach
The worm, JulieErnie, and finally Rick scramble out of the opening
The dirt avalanche is stopped short by Paul Lynde's corpse, just as Rick scrambles to safety
Just made it
Paul saved our lives
Way to go, Paul
Nosey claps Paul on what's left of his back--his skeleton shatters and the tunnel collapses, burying him instantly
The freaks are horrified
turns to them guiltily in -
His voice is slowed down and distorted like John Lennon at the end of "Strawberry ": buried
Paul
Back to normal speed
This is no time to lament over a cadaver
We've got to get moving, or we're history
Now c'mon
Nosey is still morose
He speaks backwards and sounds a lot like "Revolution #9"
Daed si luap
: "Paul is dead
" said enough
Okay, listen up, everybody
We cracked the code and made the ointment we need to bring Skuggs down for good
The freaks applaud and cheer
79
But we left it in the lab
The freaks jeer and pelt Rick with rotten vegetables
He desperately pulls a bag of cookies out of his pocket
But wait
found some macaroons
And there's plenty for all of us
The freaks burst into applause again
Yaayyy
: - The Freaks are all sleeping, macaroon crumbs still left on their faces
There's a lot of snoring
Rick awakens with a start
He hears something in the distance
Something like a helicopter
He gets up and peeks out a crack in the wall
'
- An  corporate helicopter touches down
few gun-toting in dark suits and dark glasses get out
They check that the coast is clear, then give the signal
Out steps Richard Hertz
He mutters something to one of the security guys, and walks towards the Freak House
(under his breath) don't believe it
What's Hertz doin' here
The door to the Freak House opens
Hertz enters, unzips his fly
Finding no toilet, he shrugs and relieves himself on the floor
Rick steps out of the shadows towards him
So  is in bed with Elijah
Skuggs, eh
Figures
Hertz is momentarily startled by Rick
He collects himself
Rick
Thank God  got to you in time
80
Cut the crap, Hertz
Hertz relieves himself as he talks
Ricky, you have no idea how your misfortune has touched our hearts
When you disappeared we almost gave up hope
But we'd heard reports of Skuggs's reckless abuse of Noxon, and when the story broke in the tabloids,  decided to personally come down and get to the bottom of things
He zips up and heads to the door
() Really
No
() The cackle is unmistakable--Rick's face twists in horror as he realizes
Hertz is
Hertz ducks out the door
Rick looks after him, stunned
We hear a nearby  cut off, and the Human Torch stands up from the spot where Hertz relieved himself
He's dripping wet and no longer on fire
He sniffs his soaked, smoldering clothing
Peuw
Hey
Of all the
That really pisses me off
He catches fire again and walks off
Rick is doing a slow burn, still looking after Hertz
He erupts and his monster eye glows briefly
He screams in anguish
Dejected, Rick leans against the wall
JulieErnie walk up behind him
Julie puts a hand on Rick's shoulder to comfort him
As they look into each other's eyes, a loud distracts them
Rick peers through the crack
81
' caravan of  trucks crash through the front gate and drive up to the lab
There's a few cargo trucks and a huge -24 tanker
Holy shit
forklift drives out of the back of one of the large trucks, carrying the old corporate farts on a wooden palette
One of them falls off, and a bunch of  scramble out to prop him up and push him back into place
- Elijah switches on the lights, and turns to face his audience
Hertz is accompanied by his stone-faced security men and various executives
Workmen are busy installing the old board of directors and their arm-raising pulley system
Nice to see you in the flesh, Laughing Man
No need to use codenames, Elijah
We're all friends here
And just to prove it,  brought you a little present
Hertz snaps his fingers and nods to a security guy, who produces a wriggling canvas sack
He dumps its contents onto the lab table--it's Stuey Gluck
His glasses come tumbling out after him
He squints at the security guy
Rick
Is that you
Who's the troll
He was asking questions about Coogan, causing trouble
We figured he was one of yours
Stuey puts on his glasses
Elijah looks him up and down
make freaks alright, but come on, fellas--this thing's pathetic
82
Well you're no Julio Iglesias yourself, mister
( ) Rick
Riiiick
Riii-- Rick hears Stuey's voice in his head, all echoey
(
0
) --iiiiiick
Oh no, not now, Stuey
The ghostly image of  gradually takes shape in front of Rick
Rick can make out the lab table Stuey's on, and some shadowy figures in the background
( ) Hey
That's Elijah's lab
( ) Stuey
Are you really in the lab
Stuey is still wailing, and everybody else is getting pretty damn annoyed
Yes
'm in the lab
'm in the lab
Not only ugly, he's crazy too
Toad grabs Stuey and slaps a piece of tape over his mouth
He throws him into one of the chicken cages along the far wall
two-headed chicken starts to peck at him
So, where were we
Gentlemen, 'm not going to bullshit you
know my setup here at Freakland looks like small potatoes
83
He pulls the cover off a small scale model of Freakland, about ten inches high
It shows the stage, lab, outhouse, the head, everything
But thanks to your Noxon and my genius, tonight  will turn Ricky Coogan into a freak so hideous, it'll be enough to turn your stomach inside out, boil your brain in its own juice, and cause cold sores you thought had healed up to start buggin' you again
(the  men shift ) It's the dawning of a new age for us all
Behold, Super Mega Freak World
He whisks the cover off another scale model--it's exactly the same as the little model except it's a lot bigger
(') It's really somethin', huh
( ) Very impressive
We'll kick Disney's dead ass
Rick is watching all of this in a ghostly image
Stuey
Stuey, can you hear me
Stuey's image, still with his mouth taped shut and the chicken pecking at him, nods yes
Mmm hmmm
want you to try and escape
Get the cup from underneath the instrument table and bring it to me, okay
() Mmmm mmmmm
84
He gives Rick the old trademark Coogan thumbs up
Rick halfheartedly returns the gesture
Yeah, right
Get movin'
Stuey checks to make sure nobody's watching him
They're not
He removes the spring from a pocket pen and picks the lock
Stuey searches the floor, and spots the Pepsi cup
He'll have to crawl through several pairs of legs to reach it
At , our plans for your Gene Machine include everything, except shoes that is
Ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha
Gee, 'd love to see your plans
We'd love to show you
(to his assistant) Bill, if you'd be so kind
, a slick and dashing  marketing executive, strides confidently up to the podium
Stuey has to duck the fast approaching legs
Bill steps over him, not even noticing he's there
Bill takes Elijah's "Freak World" graphic off an easel, and replaces it with his own
Finding no place to deposit Elijah's, he simply drops it on the floor
Elijah looks a little hurt
What does today's businessman want
How about a receptionist with six arms, five mouths, and a knockout figure
That'd sure speed things up, wouldn't it
With a big smile, Bill reveals an illustration of a multi- limb secretary (in a sexy dress) talking on three different phones, taking notes, and typing, all at once
Stuey heads towards the Pepsi cup
He brushes against the back of Hertz's legs
Hertz looks over at Elijah beside him, who smiles politely
Hertz smiles back, invitingly
Maybe there's a few things we don't know about him
85
In the factory, how 'bout a worker with twelve busy hands, no mouth to talk back, and no genitalia or digestive system to distract him from his work
( ) Sure
It's what we all dream of
The  guys all nod along
Except for the workmen, who exchange worried looks
Elijah's still not sure what to make of it all
Meanwhile, Stuey has the Pepsi cup of sludge in hand, and he's crawling under the table towards the door
He brushes up against the back of Elijah's legs
Elijah looks over to Hertz, who gives him that smile again
Elijah looks away quickly, panicky
(') Well, with this Skuggs-based Noxon technology, it's not only possible, it's just the beginning
Of course, what happened to our expensive spokesman Ricky Coogan was an unfortunate coincidence, but profits from these new markets could total in the billions
All the executives turn to Hertz
He cracks a smile
Ricky who
The executives laugh heartily
Stuey glances across the room to the door
He has to make a break for it, so he does
Hey
Hold on
Stuey freezes
He's right out in the open, in plain view
Still, nobody seems to see him
They're still watching- Bill's presentation
Secretaries
Worker drones
Where's the fun
Where's the spark
Where's the unspeakable evil
Bill laughs pleasantly
Ha-ha
was just getting to that
86
Bill launches back into his speech with more intensity than even the best infomercials
Meanwhile, Stuey inches towards the door, moving as imperceptibly as possible
We'll impact every field
-- creams, nosejobs in a bottle
Military--human death machines that make Schwarzenegger look like a pansy
And why stop at consumer products
Hell, we can design a whole new consumer
few well placed drops in the water supply, and bingo
It's a new master race, and we own the copyright
An entire planet of freaks owned and operated by us
Every part of their bodies comes from an supplier, every thought they think is  policy
From now on gentlemen, it's  uber alles
uber alles
The  guys clap and shout approval
Elijah's impressed too
He leans over to Hertz
This guy's good
We lured him away from
&
Stuey is finally out the door
Of course, now they spot him
Look
The troll
After him
Stuey is outside the lab
Inexplicably, (actually it's just because he's so stupid) he's still moving inch by inch
He calls to Rick through the tape on his mouth
Mmm
Mmmmm
Rick sees the image of Stuey inching away from the lab
87
Take the tape off your mouth, idiot
They didn't tie your hands
Stuey realizes this is true, and pulls the tape off his mouth
got the cup, Rick
Great
There's no time to waste
Are you being followed
Yeah
But if  don't move, they won't see me
Two big  security guys are standing watching Stuey's odd behavior
They pick him up and carry him away
Riiiick
Rick sees this all in his holographic image
It fades
What a geek
He turns to the other freaks, who've woken up and are gathered around on the floor
Rick shakes his head
Stuey got caught
There's no way to get the ointment before the show
So, that's it then
We're all to die
And by your hand no less
No
It won't be me
It's some inhuman monster Elijah used me to create
As for me, the real me, 'll always be your friend
Before have to rip your heads off, 'd like to say goodbye to each of you
(He turns to Worm
) Worm
'll miss your brains, the smell of your pipe, and the funny way you always go on talking until everyone wants to strangle you
He pats the Worm on the head tenderly, and turns to Cowboy
88
Hi, Rick
Cowboy, 'll miss your good humor, your down-home wisdom, and of course, the frothy milkshakes were udderly delicious, heh-heh
He smiles and playfully tugs Cowboy's udder
He turns to the Bearded Lady
Bearded
Lady
dunno
We'll always have Paris
Bearded lady is kind of confused, Rick shrugs
Nosey,  never really liked you
He moves on to Frog Man
Frog Man,  think death is probably the best thing for you now
Frog Man nods in agreement
Rick rpaches JulieErnie
Ernie
Julie
have mixed feelings
(He turns to Ernie) On one hand, 'll remember you as the best friend a jerk like me ever had, and a low down repulsive slimeball
He turns to Julie
swells up
(') On the other hand,  really respect you, and more than that, , uh, well,  wish we'd had the chance to boink
Oh, Rick
They embrace
Rick calls out to the assembled group
Today  make the proudest boast a man can utter: "Ich bien ein Freak
" 89
They're all ready to cheer, but they're confused by his bad German
Rick has to explain himself
Uh, 'm a freak
Oh
They all get it
Beat
Then they cheer
: - huge banner reads " : "
We can hear the sound of the crowd inside
There's a typically smallish crowd in addition to the executives who occupy the front seats
The security goons are strategically situated throughout the tent, and two of them sit on either side of Stuey in the second row
Elijah is onstage
And now the moment you've all been waiting for
Ladies and gentlemen, meet the lucky young man who's about to be become the monster with the mostest
Here he is, the Beast Boy
Toad pulls a rope and the curtain opens, revealing Rick strapped to an operating table
On stage left there's a large cage containing all the other freaks
Including the unconscious, half-naked Milk Man who Rick knocked out in the freak house
The Milk Man domes to, looks around in a panic, grabs the bars of the cage, and screams-- '
Rick searches the cheering audience for Stuey, who waves the Pepsi cup full of glop in the air
Rick hears Stuey's voice echo in his head telepathically
(
0
) Rick
Over here
Stuey's waving cup is blocking the view of a big, annoyed sitting behind him
Elijah quiets the crowd and holds up a beaker of ointment
90
With this remarkable ointment of my own design,  will now turn this half-finished ghoul into the ultimate super freak, dedicated to evil
Elijah puts on some rubber gloves and prepares to glop Rick, who squints under the spotlight, still searching for Stuey
He calls out telepathically
(
0
) Stuey
Where are you
Stuey stands up on his seat and waves the cup, totally blocking the biker's view
He telepathically replies
(
0
) Here  am, Rick
( ) Goddammit, kid
Would you sit down
The biker grabs the cup and dumps it over Stuey's head
The "good ointment" runs down all over Stuey's body
All eyes turn to Stuey, who falls down and disappears onto the floor screaming
Oh no
What the hell
Suddenly an        leaps to its feet and snarls down at the biker
The biker pulls a switchblade and jams it into Stuey monster's leg--the blade crumples on his armor-like hide
Stuey grins and
He drives the biker into the ground like a railroad spike
He leaps onto the stage and stalks Elijah
,
Rick and the freaks in the cage cheer stuey Monster on
Uh-oh, that kid looks pissed 91
Eye and Eye rush the stage, Uzis firing
The bullets bounce off Stuey's hide
He doinks them with his big monster fingers and sends them flying through
across the compound, and
Into the Giant Head's eye sockets, where they spin around and come to a stop, cockeyed
The head's foundation crumbles and it keels over backwards
Elijah calls out to Toad
Stuey Monster roars at Toad
Toad smiles weakly
Toad catapults through it, follows the path of Eye and Eye across the compound and
Lands head first into the neck of the Giant Head
He gets up with the Giant Head stuck on his own head, making him look like one of those big headed caricatures
He runs blindly across the yard and into
Eye and Eye zing out of the sockets, and Toad's tongue sticks ten feet out of the Giant Head's mouth
It's the biggest Tex Avery cartoon take ever
looks worried
He scoops up some "evil ointment"
Looks like it's time to roll out the big gun
( ) Sayonara, kiddo
Any last words
Rick considers it
He can't think of anything
Nahh
92
Suit yourself
He raises the ointment over Rick
Rick has an idea for a last word
Wait
Wait
(Elijah pauses
Rick ) Nahh
Elijah glops Rick
His skin starts to smoke
Stuey Monster stalks Elijah onstage
Rick is smoking and shaking violently on the table
turns to his  cronies in the audience
He looks bored
What a waste of twelve bucks
Let's get the machine and go
The other executives nod
starts to transform
His ears spring out into huge monster ears, kinda like in Pinocchio
His mouth grows into a massive, Big Daddy Roth style monster mouth
His upper head does the same
His body follows suit
He bursts' out of the straps and grows into a drooling
He snarls at Stuey Monster
,
The crowd and the other freaks look on, tense
Stuey Monster instinctively whips out a Ricky Coogan publicity photo and a pen
Rick
Rick
Could you sign this
Rick Monster snarls and bashes Stuey Monster in the face
Stuey Monster jams the pen through the photo and snarls back
93
Even Julie is screaming "Fight
Fight," beside herself with bloodthirsty glee
Ernie smacks her
The crowd goes nuts as the monsters trade a series of cliche pro-wrestling moves
Stuey bashes Rick
Rick bashes Stuey, etc
Give him the skull cracker, ya big goon
No way
The skull cracker is an illegal move
Stuey grabs Rick's hair and marches him around the stage
The crowd is taking sides, screaming out advice, and foaming at their mouths
Let's get this over with
Hey Hertz, tell your goons to (he turns to Hertz and is ) What the hell-
stands in front of the a group of   who are using forklifts to move the Tasty Freekz Machine towards the exit
He notices Elijah and taps his executive
( ) Ahem
At this point in time we at regret that we must leave this performance prematurely
What are you saying
What we're saying is
get stuffed, yokel
figured  couldn't trust you corporate greaseballs
Elijah turns to an alarm box on the wall which reads " " He breaks the glass and pulls the lever inside
94
trapdoor on the stage opens and a large chemical tank rises out of it
Elijah jumps into the seat of the gun turret nozzle atop the tank
He aims the nozzle at the  group
Let me proudly introduce the latest in our product line, Noxon 25--now available in a convenient pump
Bullshit
The Everything Except Shoes corporation releases no new products unless  give the order
think it's time  branched out a little
He presses the plunger and the nozzle spews a torrent of yellow glop on the  people
They scream in agony as their bodies melt together into one big mutating blob
Alistair Cooke stands up in the audience--he's got a head bandage and a crutch from being trampled at the last show
Ahhh
Head for the hills before he gets all of us
The crowd goes berserk and rushes the exits, trampling poor Cooke like a roach
flips Stuey onto the ground and starts stomping on him
Stuey is knocked out cold
Rick leaves him on the floor and stalks the freak cage murderously
No
We're your friends
Oh
He rips some bars off the cage and is about to spear JulieErnie with a jagged steel bar when Stuey Monster grabs his leg and trips him
Stuey summons all his remaining energy to wrestle Rick, delaying him, for the moment, from slaughtering the freaks
Meanwhile, Elijah is watching as 95
solidifies into
made of living flesh
It's got eyeballs where the eyes should be, a tongue where the tongue should be, but it's helpless and immobile
Elijah looks at it with pride
He does his best Ed Sullivan : Now that's a really, really big shoe
Ha-ha-ha-ha
Hmmm,  think 'd like a pair of those
He swivels the nozzle turret towards the cage full of freaks and is about to glop them when Rick stands up above Stuey, blocking Elijah's trajectory at the freak cage
Rick raises the jagged bar above Stuey, ready to drive it down through his chest
(to Rick monster) Would you hurry up and waste the troll, please
got a lonely shoe over here
Rick Monster nods and drives the spear down when we
: & Rick's silhouette (which matches his ten foot monster incarnation) is immersed in the story
And then
Sorry to interrupt Rick, but you've been talking for almost ninety minutes, and we've just got to go to a commercial
Sorry
We'll be right back after this, folks
: 96
fine array of different kinds of cheese on a chopping block
You like cheese
You like being a man
That's why you like
swipes all the cheese off the block and slams down an aluminum can labeled "
" Macheesemo
Real cheese for real men
Now in a handy aluminum dispenser
The hand crushes the can and gooey yellow cheese squirts out the top
: & We hear a music bite from "Le Freak
" And now back to the exciting conclusion of Ricky Coogan's incredible story
Well, let's see, the other freaks were lined up in Elijah's sights, and  was about to shove a pipe through Stuey's skull, when all of a sudden,  heard a voice
: - Rick stops the spear inches from Stuey's chest
Their eyes meet
Kill him
Kill him
Elijah's bloodthirsty goading fades away, and Cowboy's voice reverberates in Rick's head
97
(
) reckon that troll could help you if you just let him into your heart
your heart
your heart
The voice keeps echoing
tear wells up in Rick Monster's eye
He looks over at Cowboy, who is actually calling out to him from the cage
Your heart
your heart
your heart
Rick Monster loses his murderous glare
He breaks into a warm smile, throws the pipe away and helps Stuey Monster up
They hug
The rest of the Freaks cheer wildly
Atta' boy Coog
( ) Hey, ain't that somethin'
The Worm is gushing sentimentally
He tries to hide his tears
Tosh
(Sniff) Sentimental claptrap (Sniff) Shameless, maudlin--Baaa
He can't hold it in anymore
He bawls like a baby
Meanwhile, Elijah is hopping mad
Cut the lovey-dovey bullshit, and start mutilating each other
He aims at Rick Monster and presses the fire button
The Glop starts to flow, but before it can make it out of the tip, Rick grabs hold of the nozzle, and twists it around to face Elijah
Raarrrrrrgh
Elijah manages to duck just in time
stream of yellow Noxon 25 glop flies over his shoulder, and lands in the full of carbolic acid that sits off to one side of the tent
The acid and the Noxon mix together and bubble up menacingly
Elijah hops down out of the gunner's chair and squares off against Rick Monster
98
Meanwhile, Stuey Monster has released the other freaks from the cage
They watch the confrontation from a distance
Elijah rolls up his sleeves
Rick growls and advances slowly
You think  made you strong
've cranked my  up so high, you won't know what hit you
'm a wrecking machine
Aaaaaaa
He rushes at Rick and delivers a flurry of punches to his mid section
They have absolutely no effect
Rick brings one heavy fist slamming down on Elijah's head, stopping him cold
() Ow
think you crushed my spinal cord
can't feel anything in my fingers
Maybe you'll feel this
Rick rears back to kick him
Qait--if you kill me, you'll never find the antidote
The freaks all perk up
Rick's skeptical
What antidote
time release serum-- baked it into a delicious batch of macaroons
slow smile grows on the Freaks' faces, especially Rick's
If you ask me, you skimped on the coconut
Rick boots Elijah between the legs, sending him flying through the air
He lands on the    over the bubbling Noxon/Acid
Dazed, he looks at the bullseye target, and back at Rick
Summoning up his last ounce of bravado, Elijah makes a last stand
99
Come on, Coogan
Come oooon
You haven't got the guts to kill me
Go on
dare ya'
Rick ponders for a second
He looks over to Julie
Then
Yap
Yap
Scrappy
Scrappy the dog rushes in
He leaps up and presses the bullseye, dropping Elijah into the hideous mixture
Elijah struggles in agony
His body bubbles and mutates in the thick toxic soup
He sinks lower and lower into the gunk, until he and his cries are buried for good
Scrappy leaps into Rick's arms and licks his face
Yap
Atta boy, Scrap
The tent flaps fly open and a half dozen rush in with guns drawn
Freeze,
Another   investigates the dunk tank, sees Elijah's hat floating on top of the bubbling ooze
Looks like they took care of Skuggs, chief
The chief nods
They put away their guns, and approach Rick and the rest of the jubilant freaks
Nice work, Ricky
You'll get a medal from the Vice President for this
Great
But how did you-- 100
We've been following Skuggs for years
Scrappy just filled in some of the details
Yap
Thank heavens you brought him to justice, Rick
God only knows how far his sick plans would've gone
Hey chief, look at this
The  guy has peeled the decal off the Pepsi machine, revealing that it's actually a Coke machine
The chief is sickened to the core
Is nothing sacred
Suddenly, the agents are distracted by a terrible scream
They turn to the dunk tank and are shocked by what they see
Oh, my Lord
No
It can't be
We   over to reveal a   climbing out of the dunk tank
The blob separates into two distinct entities with their backs to us
They turn around and
my God it's
it's
Or at least a damn fine mutant imitation of them
Call him/them  and
They both have glowing red demon eyes and speak in Elijah's voice
Thought you killed me, huh
What the hell are you looking at
Two pieces of deadmeat
101
The  guys open fire
We show only the horrified reactions of the freaks as they look on
: Rick, Regis, and Kathie Lee are still in silhouette
And that's my story
() It was so exciting
And long
My God
It makes War and Peace sound like a warm up act
(
) Okay
We got light
It's fixed
Well, it's about time
The lights come on--no more silhouettes
Ricky looks perfectly normal, his old self
His weird silhouette was caused by a potted plant and some strange hanging mobile behind him
That's better
'll say
( ) How 'bout it, folks
Let's hear it for Ricky Coogan
The audience applauds and hoots wildly
Can we bring out the other freaks now
The audience cheers as the rest of the Freaks walk out from the wings, and stand off to the side waving to the audience
They all look clean cut and happy
They wear -shirts with their former identities printed on them
" was ," " was ," " was the  " etc
Except the Worm, who's still a worm
His -shirt says, "'m Still  "
102
Ridiculous
Just because a man doesn't like macaroons
Nonsense
Suddenly a squirrel runs across stage, followed by Juan
He pounces and catches the furry little bugger
Gotcha
Damn, it's about time
- (happy to see him) Hey guys
Jeez
You look great
They all hug
That's just great
What a story
And what an ending
Elijah transformed by the goop
And he really looked like--
Exactly like you two,  swear
Same faces, same outfits, except they had these really big, hideous feet
He looks down at Regis and  's feet--they're big, hideous monster feet
Suddenly their eyes glow bright red-- It's Elijus and Elly Lee
They speak with Elijah's voice
Show's over, Ricky
'm gonna drink your blood
Elly Lee pulls a machete and is about to force it down on Rick's throat when
Elijus and Elly Lee's eyes go funny
They look at each other, spit up some blood, wave to the audience one last time, and collapse to the floor
Julie stands behind them, smoking gun in hand
She rushes to Rick
They embrace
Rick
It's finally over
103
Yes
Yes it is
(
) Rick
Rick
Rick and Julie turn and see Stuey, still a ten foot tall monster, running towards them
He's carrying a garbage bag dripping blood
Stuey
Look
found the real Regis and Kathie Lee
Rick and Julie look at the bag, mortified
Stuey chuckles
(') No, this is just my lunch
Rick and Julie sigh with relief
Stuey pulls out a similar leaking bag and holds it up
(matter of fact) This is Regis and Kathie Lee
Rick and Julie nod casually--"Oh
" Awwww
Suddenly Elijus and Elly Lee pop up from behind the couch, bloodied, but still fierce
They're about to stab Rick and Julie when
Five more shots ring out and they fall dead--again
Ernie stands off to the side with a smoking gun
Oh, like that wasn't totally predictable
Well, now it really is over
Sappy      wells up
Thank God
You know, this adventure has taught me something
() 104
(') When man starts impinging on the subtle perfection of the earth's natural order, the only thing he'll create is havoc
Right, Coog
learned somethin' too
That men and women truly are equals
That the human spirit transcends gender and physical appearance, and thus it is immune to the petty degradations men may devise
believe it was Moliere -- Julie's had enough
She socks Ernie square on the jaw
Oh, shut up
(She turns to Rick) Let's go fuck
Rick gives her the thumbs up
They turn to the audience
/// Good night, everybody
The audience cheers
The   from the soundtrack album kicks in as we
As the credits roll, and everybody continues to smile and wave at the cheering audience, Elijus and Elly Lee attack again
Ernie hands the gun to Stuey, who shoots them dead
Well, dead-ish
Seconds later, after some more waving, they attack again
This time Nosey and the Bearded Lady stab them to death, sort of
little more waving, before Elijus and Elly Lee make another pathetic attempt
They can barely stand
Cowboy clubs one with a mic stand
Worm head-butts the other
few seconds later, Elijus's bloodied hand gropes its way over the top of the studio couch
Stuey has to prop him up while members of the audience are invited down to punch him in the chops
Ernie stands off to the side, charging everyone five bucks per blow
As we fade, everyone's having a go flipping, throwing, kicking and impaling rag doll replicas of America's favorite morning show hosts
