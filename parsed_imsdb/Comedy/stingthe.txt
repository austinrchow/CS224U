href <b>// --> </b> The Sting Second Draft Screenplay by : white on black  appears in the lower left hand corner of the screen: , 1936 : - It's a bleak, windy morning, the kind that clears the streets of all but the winos (who carry their own heaters), and the point-men for juvenile gangs
We pick up a solitary figure, Joe Mottola, coming down the street and entering what appears to be an abandoned tenement
He pauses a second to dust his white-winged alligator shoes on the back of his pants leg
Sharply dressed and surrounded by the aura of one who is making money for the first time and broadcasting it on all bands, he seems an incongruity in this part of town
We follow him up a flight of rickety stairs to a second floor flat
He knocks on the door, is admitted by a cautious doorman
- Suddenly we are plunged into a room of chattering, clamoring people
This is a spot for the numbers racket, a place immune from legal interference, where any sucker can bet on a number between 1 and 1000 in the hope of getting the 600 to 1 payoff that goes to those few who guess right
The bettors are queued up in several lines before a long table, where they place their bets and are given receipts in return
Others wait at a cashier's window to pick up previous earnings or to ask for credit
Mottola moves through the crowd to a back room where betting slips are being sorted and money counted under the watchful and somewhat impatient gaze of a Supervisor, an older man named Mr
Granger
The Yankee-White Sox game is heard on the radio in the background
Mottola, noticing that his entrance has aroused little interest, saunters over to the Phone Girl and gives her a little pinch on the cheek
The girl slaps his hand away, obviously having been through this before
Beat it, Mottola
Granger glances up and exchanges a token nod with Mottola, who plops down in a folding chair next to the radio
The phone rings
8720
Yes, hold on a second
(calling over to the Supervisor) Mr
Granger, Chicago on the line
Granger is a little apprehensive about talking to Chicago, but takes the phone anyway
Yeh
: -  - flabby, bald man named Combs is on the other end of the line
Visible beyond the door and interior window of his office is a large room, cluttered with tables, typewriters, clerks and adding machines
This room is the clearinghouse for all the transaction of the numbers game
All the betting slips and income from the spots are brought in here and processed
Granger, this is Combs
Why haven't we heard from ya
Everybody else is in
We had a few problems with the Law this morning
The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good
Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya
Hell yes
He does this every year
There's nothing to worry about
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can don't wanta be here all night
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy
Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week
(not impressed) We cleared 22 here
Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side
How do ya expect the eight lousy spots 've got to compete with that
(reading off a sheet of paper on his desk) They did 14 grand in Evanston, 16
5 is Gary, and 20 in Cicero
Looks like you're bringing up the rear, Granger
- Granger burns inside
One of the girls who's been sorting and counting hands him a slip of paper
just got the count
We'll put the take on the 4:15
We'll be waitin'
Combs hangs up, smiling to himself, proud of the way he gave the needle to Granger
: - Granger storming over to a safe and jerking open the door
(snapping) Mottola
Mottola hustles out of his chair
(handing him a bundle of bills) Take this up to the city on the 4:15
They'll be waitin' for it at the clearing house
And don't stop for no drinks
You can get a cab down the street
Mottola takes the money and slips it into his inside coat pocket with all the dramatic flair of the true flunky
No one would ever guess that he was just an overdressed messenger boy
Mottola emerges from a side entrance into a narrow alley
He walks briskly down to the end and turns left into a large alleyway; this one connecting two streets
The alley is deserted save for one scruffy, slovenly dressed young stranger coming toward him from the opposite direction
The man carries a battered suitcase and seems to be in a hurry
Suddenly, Mottola hears shouting coming from somewhere behind him
He turns around to see a small, weathered looking thief come racing around the corner and down the alley toward him, frantically pursued by a gray-haired black man
Limping noticeably, the black man manages a few cries for help and then stumbles and falls
The stranger yells at Mottola to cover his side of the alley, and then readies himself for the arrival of the thief
Mottola just stands there, not the least interested in the exercise of justice
Just as the thief is about to run on by, the stranger throws his suitcase at the little man's legs, sending him sprawling and separating him from the wallet he's been carrying in his left hand
The stranger makes a dash for the wallet and kicks it back to where Mottola is standing
Almost by reflex, Mottola picks it up
The thief scrambles to his feet and starts back toward his new-found enemy, brandishing a knife
Both the stranger and Mottola brace themselves for an attack
The thief, realizing that there are two people to fight, begins to think better of it
He is not a young man, nor particularly strong
(shaking his fist at the stranger) You fuckin' nigger-lover
'll get you for this someday, sucker egg
Mottola and the stranger exchange glances of relief as the thief flees out onto the street and disappears
The black man, meanwhile, has struggled to his feet and is staggering toward them
He collapses against the alley wall after a few steps
The stranger rushes over to him, followed somewhat absently by Mottola
The wallet
You gotta go after him
He's got all the money
Don't worry, we got the wallet
What happened
He get ya with the knife
The stranger opens the Black Man's coat to reveal a bloody wound at the top of his leg
(trying to move) Give it to me
Please
gotta know it's all there
You just sit tight, old man
We're gonna have to get you to a doctor
(starting to leave) 'll call a cop
No, no cops
Mottola has given him his wallet, which the black man now opens, disclosing a fat bundle of bills tied by a rubber band
Mottola and the stranger are amazed by the amount of money
(a little uneasy) You wanted by the law or somethin'
Naw, it's okay
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood
No wonder you got hit
(trying to get to his feet) Thanks
'm obliged to ya, but gotta get goin'
(his leg gives way under him) You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg
gotta
Look,  run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here
got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure  been holdin' out on 'em
They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash
don't get it there 'm dead
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now
got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me
(hesitates) dunno
That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends
He won't know you're carryin' it
'mon, you gotta help me out
(makes up his mind) Sorry, pal
'll fix you up, call you a doc, but  ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya
(desperate to Mottola) How bout you
'll give you the whole hundred
What makes you think you can trust him
He didn't do shit
Hey, butt out, chicken liver gave him back his wallet, didn't
(to black man) How far is this place
1811 Mason
Put it in Box 3C
You won't have no trouble
There's five thousand dollars there and here's a hundred for you
(taking the bundle of bills from the black man, plus the $100 bill) All right
'll make your drop for you, old man
And don't worry, you can trust me
Mottola puts the bills in his inside coat pocket, right next to the numbers money
The stranger, who has now finished bandaging, watches him do it
If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there
(suddenly afraid again) What do we do
You got a bag or somethin
No
How 'bout a handkerchief
Here
The stranger goes into the right coat pocket and pulls out a wrinkled handkerchief
Let me have the money
Mottola takes out the Black Man's five grand and hands it to the Stranger
He puts it in the handkerchief
You better stick that other in here too, if you wanta keep it
(pleading) Just hurry, will ya
Mottola pulls out the numbers money and puts it in the handkerchief too
The stranger ties it all up
(demonstrating by slipping the bundle down into crotch) All right
Carry it down in your pants here
(pulling it back out and tucking it in Mottola's pants) Ain't no hard guy in the world gonna frisk ya there
Thanks
(to the black man) So long, partner
Don't worry, everything's gonna be all right
The Black Man nods gratefully, but there's still a trace of worry on his face
Mottola trots off down the alley and out onto the street, glancing around cautiously for signs of trouble
He walks hurriedly down the sidewalk toward the cab stand in the distance
Suddenly the little man with the knife appears out of a doorway about 15 yards behind him
Mottola notices him and quickens his pace, finally breaking into a dead run
We follow him as he dashes headlong down the street, opening a big lead on the guy with the knife
He reaches the taxi zone
He hops in a cab and slams the door
- He jumps in, closes the door, and breathes a sigh of relief
Where to
Which way is Mason
About 20 blocks south
Okay, go north
The Joliet Station -- Fast
Mottola settles back in his seat and starts to laugh
What's so funny
just made the world's easiest five grand
He takes the bundle out from inside his pants in order to gaze upon his new-found fortune
He unties the handkerchief
It's full of toilet paper
Mottola looks like he's just been shot
: -  - hightailing it down the street, two newly solvent con artists on the lam
It's hard to run they're laughing so hard
The stranger chucks his suitcase in a trash can and pulls the real handkerchief out of his pants
Jesus, what a bundle
Did you know he was that loaded
Hell no,  just cut into him woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes
As they split off, music begins, and we go into a Done to a driving Chicago blues, the sequence is designed to establish somewhat the milieu of the stranger, known to friends and enemies alike as Hooker
We see the following: -   - Hooker is getting a radio and well-worn suit out of hook
It's like seeing old friends again
All pantomime
'  - shabby little place he rents above a cigar store
We pick him up in a jerry-built outdoor shower, which he's rigged up on the fire escape
The rinse water drips down through the landing into the grimy alley below
(singing) 'With plenty of money and you-oo- oo, Oh baby, what  wouldn't do-oo- oo
' jauntily carrying a magnum of champagne and some flowers, obviously on his way to see someone special
Hooker stands in the wings holding the flowers and champagne, watching his date for the evening, a 6'3" stripper named Crystal, do her routine
Crystal finishes up and comes off the stage
(tired) Hi, Hooker, you gettin' married or somethin'
Come into a little dough
You wanna get outa here tonight
Can't
got a 10 o'clock show need the five bucks
'll spend fifty on ya
Crystal looks at him a second and starts to giggle
We're pretty sure she's gonna get outa here tonight
' Little more than a reconverted brick basement, the place contains three shoddy, homemade roulette tables
Hooker, accompanied now by Crystal, nods a greeting to the doorman and proceeds to a table where there are already several other people laying their bets for the next spin
Hooker knows the wheel man, an old-timer named Jimmy
(glad to see him) Hooker
How ya doin', Jimmy
(collecting bets and paying off the winners) Ain't seen you in months, boy
Thought maybe you took a fall
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all
It's all over now
You gonna have a go here
(pointing to the betting board) How 'bout a ten spot on the line here
The 4-9 been lookin' good today
Lotsa action on 28th Street down there, too
Pay ya 10-1
As Jimmy finishes his spiel, he starts the wheel spinning and drops in the ball
Betting is allowed to continue until the ball drops from the outer ring into the center
(taking out his wallet) Three grand on the black
Jimmy is stunned
The others at the table, used to dollar bets, look at Hooker like he's some kind of foreign dignitary
(worried) You sure you wanna start off that big
Bet like that could put a real dent in us
feel lucky tonight
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just
Three grand on the black, Jimmy
Jimmy wants to argue some more, but the ball is getting ready to drop into the center
We see Jimmy quickly press a hidden lever under the table with his foot
The ball falls and settles into red 27 with a motion that is not quite right
The others at the table fail to notice, but Hooker is not fooled
He stares venomously at Jimmy, who knows that Hooker is on to him
Sorry, Hooker
(making an attempt at levity, in order to explain) Good thing that ball came up red
Guy could get in trouble around here, losin' a bet that big
Jimmy reaches for Hooker's money
Hooker stops him by putting his hand on it
Spin it again
Jimmy doesn't know what the hell to do
He gives Hooker a little head motion to indicate a small window high up in one of the walls
Behind it, we see a pair of eyes
Suddenly, Hooker understands why Jimmy had to cheat him, but it doesn't change his demand
Spin it anyway, Jimmy
Jimmy is beside himself
If he doesn't spin again, Hooker may expose him
If he does spin, and loses, his management will fire him
He pleads to Hooker with his eyes, but it's no use
Jimmy spins the wheel and reluctantly drops in the ball
This time there is no foot on the lever, and it settles into black 15
Hooker stares at the ball a second and then looks up at his terrified friend
Don't worry, pal
knew it was my night
Hooker pushes the money over to Jimmy and walks out of the room
He's lost $3,000, but he's still working on a lucky night
: Hooker and Crystal out on the street
(irritated) Thanks for the evening, Hooker can still make the 10 o'clock
If you wanna spend 50 bucks on me again, mail it
She walks off down the street
(going into his pocket for more money) Hey wait a minute
(he comes up with 30) Aw, the hell with ya
: - late model Ford roars up and screeches to a stop in front of the plant
Out bursts a carefully-groomed, tight-lipped young man named Greer, who hustles into the plant
We follow him through a maze of machinery to the service elevator and up to the third floor where we find ourselves in the clearinghouse room we saw earlier
-  - The working day is over now, and everyone has gone, except for Combs, who sits somberly in his office
They found Mottola
He was drunk in a dive in Joliet
Never got on the train
(aggravated) don't wanta hear about his day, Greer
What happened to the money
He lost it to a coupla con artists on his way outa the spot
How much
Twelve thousand
Combs sits in quiet thought for a second
Finally: All right
Better get on the phone to New York
See what the big mick wants to do about it
(pause) gotta pretty good idea, though
: - An agitated young man, Floyd, weaves his way through the craps and roulette tables, and hustles up a staircase to a second floor room with a drawing of a snarling tiger on the door
Below the tiger, the word "" appears
There is a large man, of thuggish demeanor, guarding the door, but Floyd gives him a small hand signal and walks right by him
: In the center is a beautifully-carved wooden table, on which sit a faro board and a dealing box, tended by a stone-faced Dealer, who calls the progress of the game in a continuous abacus-like device that keeps track of the cards which have already been played
On the opposite side of the table, completely absorbed in the rhythmic appearance of the cards from the dealing box, sits Doyle Lonnegan
Although is clothes and accessories are those of a wealthy man, there is a coarseness to both his movement and speech which bespeak lower class origins, for which he now has nothing but contempt
Floyd enters the room and approaches him cautiously, trying hard to make as little noise as possible
Doyle, can  see you a minute
(not looking up from the table) 'm busy, Floyd
It's important
We had a little trouble in Chicago today
One of our runners got hit for 12 grand
(calmly) Which one
Mottola
You sure he didn't just pocket it
No, we checked his story with a tipster
He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th
They workin' for anybody
don't know
Could be
We're runnin' that down now
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus
Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back
Get some local people to take care of the other two
(impassively) We gotta discourage this kinda thing
: - Hooker, still in his suit, but looking a little worse for wear, knocks on the door of one of the apartments
young black woman, Louise, answers the door, holding a baby
Howdy, Louise
(admiring Hooker in his suit) Goddamn, Johnny Hooker, you're a sharp hunky in them linens
If you wasn't so pale, 'da sworn you had class
Hooker steps inside and walks right into a big hug from an older black woman, Alva
Alva has a hat on, obviously just about to go out
Beyond her we see the Eirie kid and the Black Man (known from here on as Luther Coleman) playing a game of mah jong on the dining table with a man whose back is to us
An 11-year-old boy is listening to the radio
Turn that down, Leroy
Oh, Johnny, Luther said you was somethin' to see today
'll never be as good as that mark, Alva
Well, we gonna hear all about it when we get back from church
Leroy, get your jacket on, boy
Leroy goes to get his jacket
Louise is finished putting the baby to bed
You goin' to church now
They been havin' late bingo down there
'm gonna call on the Lord for a little cash, while he's still payin' off
Luther, you look in on that child from time to time, will ya
Luther nods that he will
Alva, Leroy and Louise leave for church as Hooker strolls over and tosses two packets on the table
Luther doesn't pick his up, but the other man does
We now see that he is the thief in the opening sequence
He is called the Eirie kid and he is delighted at his share
Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but  didn't figure this much
Which way did he do, Eirie
Straight north
He was gonna take it all and run
(laughs) The bastard
He can blow his nose all the way
They laugh again, but Luther doesn't share their enthusiasm
He watches Hooker who becomes uncomfortable under his gaze
You're late
Where you been
(flopping into a chair) had some appointments
(not fooled) How much did ya lose
(after a pause) All of it
(pissed) In one goddamn night
What are ya sprayin' money around like that for
You coulda been nailed
checked the place out
There weren't no dicks in there
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp
didn't teach ya to be no pimp
What's eatin' you
've blown money before
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all
You think my play is bad
think it's the best
Hooker sinks back, embarrassed that he misread Coleman's intentions
It's the only reason  ain't quit before now
(bewildered) What
'm gettin' too slow for this racket
done the best 'm gonna do
You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself
What are you talkin' about
We just took off the biggest score we've ever had
We can do anything we want now
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con
You're wastin' your time workin' street marks
Hey look
You think 'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'
Just cause we hit it big
Luther,  owe you everything
If you hadn't taught me con,  wouldn't know nothin'
(a little embarrassed) Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker
You know everything know
You got nothin' more to learn from me
But you played the Big Con
You said it was nothin'
game for flakes and mama's boys
And 'm tellin' ya now, you're a fool if you don't get into it bigger fool than  was
(pause, holding up the money) been lookin' for this one all my life, Johnny
Now  got a chance to step out at the top
Hooker knows it's no use
(after a long silence) What the hell you gonna do with yourself
Aw,  got a brother down in
, runs a freight outlet
can go halfsies with 'em
It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal
Hooker just nods
Straighten up, kid
wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready
(flipping Hooker a piece of paper) got a guy named Henry Gondorff want you to look up
There ain't a better insideman alive
He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know
You'll take a cut of what  make, won't ya
'm out, Johnny
If that's the way you want it
That's the way  want it
: - It's late at night now
Hooker and Eirie wander along the street together, not really ready to go home, but with no other ideas either
Hooker, obviously preoccupied, idly strikes a match on a street lamp as he passes and lets it burn out
He does this several times
How do you like that Coleman, huh
After three years
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do
He knew he was holdin' ya back
We were partners
If it weren't for Luther 'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's don't need anything more than  got
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance
There's a depression on ya know
There's always a depression on
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much
like griftin'
You could buy yourself some things
Clothes, or a nice car
don't look any good in clothes and  don't know how to drive
What else ya got to sell, Eirie
Forget it
They walk on a few more feet, when suddenly a police car pulls up alongside them and two men jump out
The first, a uniformed policeman, grabs Eirie around the neck
Hooker makes a break for it, but the second Figure, a burly detective named Snyder, tackles him in the middle of the street, drags him back into the alley and plasters him up against a brick wall
The two have met before
Hi there, Snyder
Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh
Somebody lose the dominoes
You scored blood money today, Hooker
You need a friend
(knocking Snyder's hand away) Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll
Snyder gives Hooker a swift knee in the thigh and follows it with an elbow across the head
Hooker flies into a row of boxes and garbage cans
(getting up slowly) You got the wrong guy, pal
been home with the flu all day
(rising to a fuller height) You can stake out my toilet if you want
Bang
Snyder, infuriated by Hooker's irreverence, slams him to the ground again
The policeman is no longer holding Eirie but is almost daring him to make a move
Eirie wants to go to Hooker's aid, but he knows the policeman will beat him to a pulp
(pulling Hooker out of the heap and smashing him against the wall again) 'll tell ya what you did, smart boy
You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies
You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th
If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect
(startled by the information) You're crazy
'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan
He'll swat you like any fly
'll square it with the fixer
Nobody can buy you a prayer, if put the finger on ya
Snyder lets go
Hooker sinks back against the wall
He says nothing; he's waiting for the price
figure your end of the score was at least 3 gees
want 2 no matter what it was
(lying) My end was only one
(not taking the fake) Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere
Hooker is beat and he knows it
All right
He reaches into his coat, pulls out a stack of bills and counts out $2000 to Snyder
Eirie looks on in amazement; he didn't think Hooker had it
(pocketing the money and motioning his partner to put his gun away) You're a smart egg, Hooker
No use dyin' for 2 grand
Snyder and his policeman friend get in their car and start down the street
Hooker and Eirie walk nonchalantly in the other direction
thought you blew all your money
did
That stuff  gave him was counterfeit
They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it
Snyder and his partner disappear around a corner
Hooker suddenly takes off like a shot
- He runs into a drugstore and goes to the phone booth
There's already a woman in it
Hooker rips open the door and throws her out
Hurriedly, he begins to dial
(standing outside the booth) What the hell you gonna do when Snyder rushes his finger right to Lonnegan
You're committin' suicide, kid
(waiting for the ring) Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now
If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else
He never gets anything first
Damn, there's no answer at Luther's
Listen to me, Hooker
What ever you do, don't go back to your place tonight, don't go anyplace you usually go, ya hear me
Get outa town or somethin', but
Hooker, still getting no answer, slams the phone down and blasts out of the booth
- Eirie chases him frantically, calling him to come back, but he's giving away too many years and there's no stopping Hooker at this point
: -  - Pumping down the street
'  - Hooker races into Luther's brownstone, charges up to the third floor
'  - Hooker runs up through a small group of people on the stairs
He bursts into Luther's room, the door of which is already open
The room shows signs of a struggle, a turned-over chair, a broken lamp, but there is no Coleman
Hooker goes slowly to the window
He looks down into the courtyard and then suddenly sprints back out the door
As we hear him scrambling down the stairs, the camera dollies to the window and looks out
- There on the concrete below, face down, is the body of Luther Coleman
Hooker races out to it and kneels down
(shaking the body) 'mon Luther, get up
You gotta get up, Luther
In the distance, sirens are heard
Heads are out of the windows and some people are starting to gather in the courtyard
(') Goddamn you, Luther, will you get up
(pounding on the body) 'm not waitin' for you, Luther
'm not waitin' anymore
Get up, you son of a bitch
Goddamn you, Luther, goddamn
The sirens are close now, and Hooker tears himself away from Luther and runs
The others gather to look at the body
: - : - We open on Hooker sleeping in some remote corner of the station, covered with newspapers for warmth, and barely distinguishable from the clutter of junk surrounding him station security officer, on his morning sweep, wanders by and delivers a terrific blow to the soles of Hooker's feet with a nightstick
Hooker jolts awake with a cry of pain, as the officer diffidently moves on toward another sleeping victim
Tired and sore from his night in the station, Hooker struggles to his feet and attempts to take stock of the situation
He tries to smooth the wrinkles out of his suit, but it's futile
quick check of his wallet finds it as empty as he'd remembered it
: -   - Hooker walks in and goes to the toy section
He looks through several small novelties, till he finds what he's looking for -- a little tin replica of a policeman's badge
He looks around for station detectives, and seeing none, slips the badge into his pocket
: -  - Hooker rinses out his mouth, towels off his face and slicks his hair back with water
It's a drop in the bucket, but it seems to revitalize him a little
: -  - We see Hooker removing a sign from a door, but the angle prohibits us from reading it
- He drops the sign in a waste can and walks out into the crowded passenger lobby
After scanning the area carefully for a minute, he goes up to a conservative young business man, who's busy reading the schedule board
(flashing open his wallet to reveal the little tin badge and then closing it again quickly) Excuse me, sir
Treasury Dept
'd like to ask you a few questions
(flustered) What for
haven't done anything
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station
Have you made any purchases here today
(reluctantly) Yes, a ticket to Chicago
Then 'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good
Can  see your wallet and your ticket, please
(handing them over) But  got a train to make
(taking out the money and returning the wallet) It'll only take 20 minutes or so
You can pick it up at the window down the hall
But what about all these other people
(blowing up) We'll get 'em
Give us a chance
'm not the only agent in here, ya know
We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh
(pointing to his suit) You think 'm wearin' this rag here 'cause  like it
Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge
(pouring it on) been here since three this morning, Charlie, and  never knew there was so much ugliness in people
You try to help 'em and they spit on you
shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin' false notes
The Businessman is totally shamed
'm sorry, really  am, but my train leaves in ten minutes
All right, 'll give ya a break
(pointing to a hall) Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left
Go on in there and wait at the window
'll take this
(he holds up the money) in the back and run it through right away
We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes
Thank you
You don't know how much appreciate this
(with a little wave) Think nothin' of it
The man goes off down the hall, more than grateful to be given a break like this
Hooker heads for the "back"
We follow the Man down the hall to the unmarked door
He strides on through to find himself face to face with a wall of busily flushing urinals
: -  - Boarding the 8:10 for Chicago
: - The Man wandering up and down the hall, wondering how he could have missed that room
- The street runs along side an elevated train track
We pick up Hooker coming down the street, eating a hot dog he bought with the money he just earned in the train station
He appears to be looking for an address, referring every now and then to the piece of paper Luther gave him the night before
Finally he stops in front of an old three-story building which contains a carousel on the bottom 2 floors and what appear to be apartments on the third floor
He peers inside the big, sliding glass doors and seeing no sign of life, goes around to the side to look for a way in
35 year-old woman, Billie, appears in her bathrobe on the second floor landing and descends the stairs to get the morning paper
She's eating an apple
Although she has just gotten up and looks it, she has the presence of one who is probably quite striking at other hours
The sight of Hooker fazes her not at all
Excuse me, 'm looking for a guy named Henry Gondorff
You know him
(starting back up the stairs) No
Luther Coleman sent me
Billie stops and comes back down the stairs
It's the first time she's stopped chewing
(checking him out) You Hooker
Yeh
Why didn't you say so
thought maybe you was a copper or somethin'
She goes to a side door and unlocks it
It's the room in the back
He wasn't expecting you so soon though
Hooker's not quite sure what that means, but there's something about Billie that makes him know that you don't ask
- Hooker walks past the now motionless carousel to the room in the back and knocks on the door
No answer
He gives the door a little push and it swings open
'  - The room inside if small and cluttered, consisting of a bed, a sink, and a bathroom, all covered by a layer of books, dirty clothes and beer bottles
Draped over a chair, fully dressed, but completely passed out is the one and only Henry Gondorff
(to himself) The great Henry Gondorff
: - Water blasting out of the fixture
We see Gondorff, still fully clothed, sitting in the bottom of the shower, the spray streaming off his face
An imposing figure, with deep set eyes and full beard, he just sits there stoically, looking like a soggy lumberjack
Hooker, sitting on the floor between the toilet and the sink, watches listlessly
Finally -- Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya
You sober
can talk, can't
Hooker makes no move to get up
Gondorff struggles to his knees, turns off the water, and slumps back against the wall
The two men just look past each other a second
Down in the bottom
Glad to meet ya, kid
You're a real horse's ass
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something
already know how to drink
Gondorff wipes his face with his hand
His mood softens a little
(quietly) 'm sorry about Luther
He was the best street worker  ever saw
He had you down as a big-timer
What happened
Aw,  conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal
real lop-ear
He thought he was gonna take over General Electric
Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me
You mean you blew it
(pause) Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth
He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either
(Gondorff looks at him coldly) You played the Big Con since then
No,  lammed it around for a while while things cooled off
Philly, Denver, Baltimore, nuthin' towns
Hooker's disappointment is obvious
But don't kid yourself, friend, still know how
Hooker nods, unconvinced
(getting up from the floor and emptying the water out of his pockets) You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat
(tired) picked something up on the way
(sensing something) Lonnegan after you, too
don't know
Haven't seen anybody
You never do, kid
We go to Hooker
He hadn't thought of that
-   - Lonnegan, in plus fours and argyles sits on a bench as other members of his foursome tee off
Floyd comes up to him
We got word from Chicago
They got one of the grifters last night
The nigger
What about the other one
They're still looking for him
Who's got the contract
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole
Hackers
They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed
They figure maybe he skipped town
You wanna follow 'em up
Lonnegan regards Floyd patiently and then pats the bench beside him
Floyd sits gingerly
You see the guy in the red sweater over there
We cut to one of Lonnegan's foursome, a short, squat little Irishman in a red sweater
He was a good-time, friendly manner and a winning Irish smile
We like him immediately
Name's Danny McCoy
No Neck McCoy we called him
Runs a few protection rackets for Carnello while he's waiting for something bigger to come along
Me and Danny been friends since we were six
Take a good look at that face, Floyd, cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us, you'll have to kill him and every other hood in Chicago who'd like to do the same thing
You understand what 'm sayin'
Yes sir
Good lad
Lonnegan is called to the tee by one of his foursome
He exchanges a friendly smile with McCoy and belts the ball down the fairway
: - Gondorff, dried off now and in a new set of clothes, is pulling up the shades of the large facing windows of the carousel building
The morning light pours in, illuminating fully for the first time the ornate merry-go-round and its massive oaken horses
Hooker watches him go about his business
Billie calls down from the mezzanine which surrounds the carousel
You feeling all right this morning, Henry
Fine, Billie
You mind opening the round a little early today
We got some business coming in before hours
Gondorff waves okay
(to Hooker) Great little countess, that Billie
Runs a good house up there, too
One of the few left that Luciano doesn't own
Gondorff walks around on the carousel, checking straps, bearing and poles
Hooker follows him
(getting impatient) Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not
(on his back, checking underneath one of the horses) You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it
wanna play for Lonnegan
(getting up) You know anything about him
(exploding) Yeh, he croaked Luther
What else do  gotta know
Gondorff just sits tight and waits for him to cool off
(waving Gondorff off, embarrassed at his own outburst) Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side
(going over to start the machinery) And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York
There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya
'll take him anyway
(whirling on him) Why
(like steel) 'Cause  don't know enough about killin' to kill him
It's the right answer
Gondorff didn't know it himself until now
You can't do it alone, ya know
It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good
We'll get by without 'em
This isn't like playin' winos on the street
You gotta do more than outrun the guy
(incensed) never played for winos
(going right on, ignoring Hooker's remark) You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money
And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more
You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya
Right down to my socks, turkey
If 'da been half as scared a that lop-ear,  wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em
Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death
Then you'll do it
If  can find a mob that'll risk it
But no matter what happens,  don't want you comin' back to me halfway through and sayin' it's not enough
cause it's all you got
Hooker nods
Gondorff switches on the carousel and steps back to admire his handiwork
The carousel makes a grinding sound, does a few lurches and stops cold
: Music begins and we are into a short: Detailing the arrival of the others three members of Gondorff's "mob
" Throughout, Gondorff wears the fedora hat which is his trademark
We begin with -- tall, good-looking man, Kid Twist, making his way through the railway station
Impeccably dressed and carrying a small suitcase, he combs the terrain carefully with his eyes
Finally he catches a glimpse of the thing he's been looking for
It's Gondorff, standing by a newsstand
Gondorff makes a quick snubbing motion on his nose as if flicking off a gnat
This is known among con men as the "office
" Twist returns the sign with a barely discernible smile as he walks on by
Con men rarely acknowledge each other openly in public, but it's obvious that these two are glad to see each other
: - Hooker in, having his hair cut and his nails manicured
Gondorff gives instructions to the barber
: - Hooker is modeling a new suit in front of a mirror
He doesn't look too pleased, but Gondorff peels out a bankroll anyway
: - pair of white spats stepping off a bus
We follow them into a: Where we tilt up to reveal
Singleton, the most flamboyant of the bunch
On his way to the check-in desk, he silently exchanges the "office" with Gondorff, who is sitting on a lounge reading the paper
: - Hooker being shown into a small apartment room by an old woman
It consists of a bed, a table and a sink
Hooker nods his acceptance to the woman and gives her a bill
He takes another look around the room and decides to go out somewhere, but first he wedges a small piece of paper between the door and the jamb, about an inch off the floor
: - We hold on a slight, bespectacled teller, Eddie Niles, in the process of counting a large deposit
Niles is all business; if he's ever smiled, no one knows about it
He glances up for a second and sees Gondorff "officing" him from across the bank
Without a word he shoves the money he's been counting back into the hands of a startled customer, abruptly closes up his window, flips his identification tag on the manager's desk and walks out of the bank
: - This room has obviously been relegated to the status of the storage room
It contains the water heater, mops and brooms, old bed springs, etc
In the middle of the room a space has been cleared for a table, around which are seated Hooker, Gondorff, Niles, Singleton and Twist
Gondorff is in his -shirt, but still wears his hat
Kid Twist is in a suit as usual
The room is illuminated by a single bare bulb hanging from the ceiling
(showing Hooker photographs of three men) These are Combs' favorite torpedoes
Riley and Cole
We recognize Riley and Cole as the two guys who got into Mottola's cab
They do most of the small jobs, but Lonnegan might not wanna use 'em on you 'cause they're kinda messy
No class
We go to Hooker
He's real grateful
Billie, wearing an evening dress, enters the room and begins gathering up the empty beer mugs on the table
We got reason to believe Riley was the guy who hit Luther
But if you see either one of these two, find yourself a crowd, or take 'em someplace you know you can handle 'em
But most of all let us know
If they got a hit on you, we gotta fold up the con
You're too exposed
You got that
Hooker nods, but we know he hasn't really got that
You sure it'll be one of these two
No
They're just the only ones we know of
Billie has finished  gathering the mugs, and leaves the room with them
We follow her down the hall and into the: Carousel music filters up from the arcade below
The room has a bar along one wall and the rest of the space is taken up by tables and couches
It's a comfortable place, but not opulent
Some of the girls sit patiently on the couches, others play canasta at the tables
Most of the men are at the bar, fortifying themselves for the task at hand
Billie comes over to the bar
(to the bartender) Set me up five more beers, will ya Danny
As Danny goes to fill the mugs, Billie's eyes fix on a man at the end of the bar
We move to reveal Snyder, intently scanning the room, as if he'd lost a dancing partner in the crush
Not finding what he wants, he comes down the bar to Billie
You the owner here
That's right
(flipping out his badge) Lieutenant Snyder
Bunco
Joliet badge, Snyder
Don't cut much up here
(trying to ignore her remark) 'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap
Thought he mighta come in here
Don't think so
know everybody in the place and  always bounce the lamsters
All right if  look around your lobby
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go
Billie grabs a bottle of beer, pours some in a shot glass and pushes it over to Snyder
He ignores the gesture
(with controlled force) don't really need your permission
We go to Billie
She knew that when he came in
: The discussion continues
Hooker, a bit out of his depth here, listens and stays silent
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry
He's not gonna sit still for a standard play
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'
What did ya find out about the train, Eddie
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning
He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars
$100 minimum, straight poker
Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York
Fancies himself a gambler, huh
Lotta plungers ride that train just to play him
(breaking into a smile) See
, he's slowly down already
: Snyder has completed his inspection of the "lobby" and found nothing
Danny, meanwhile, has set up the five beers on a tray
Which way are the rooms
Who told ya this guy was in here
Nobody
just know what kinda women he likes
'm gonna check all the joyhouses till  find him
Maybe  could help ya if ya told me his name
think 'll keep that to myself
Which way are the rooms
Right through there
But  wouldn't go in there if  were you
(picks up the tray) (snidely) What are ya gonna do, call the cops
don't have to
You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall
(she exits with the drinks) Snyder is stopped cold
He calls after her
Keep your nose clean, lady
He can't spend all his time here
: Billie comes over to Gondorff and whispers in his ear, while the others talk
His eyes flick momentarily to Hooker
think we ought to play him on the Rag
It's the tightest game we got, and it's not all over the papers yet
No good,
You're not gonna con stocks to a banker
Lonnegan's too smart for that
What are you going to do, con the payoff to a gambler
Twist is right
It won't work
Gondorff has nodded to Billie and now rejoins the conversation
She serves the others beer
We'll use the wire
Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies
The wire is ten years outa date
That's why he won't know it
'm not sure  know it
We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here
You think  can get in that poker game, Eddie
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool
also gotta win
He looks at Hooker
There is a challenge in their book
Gondorff smiles broadly, then casually, to them all
By the way, any of you guys been passing off any green goods lately
We go around the table
No reply
Billie, if that Dick comes in again, stall him till  can get a look at him
And let me pay ya for these beers
What are you talking about
It's on the house
(pulling out a $5 bill) Naw,  want ya to have this
He hitches up Billie's skirt, and puts the bill in her garter
Don't look at it till ya go to bed though or it'll turn to paper
Billie smiles and leaves the room
She walks halfway down the hall and stops
She can't wait
Lifting up her skirt, she finds that the five has indeed turned to paper
As she breaks into laughter and continues on down the hall, we: : : - Actually little more than a service area between two apartment buildings
Niles, Kid Twist, and a middle-aged black man, named Benny Garfield, enter the alley with an old man and follow him down a stairwell to a subterranean basement
faded sign above the door says Stenner's Billiards
We follow them inside to a: - An office comes off it at one end
Judging from the fluorescent lights overhead and the scattered cue racks which still hang tenuously on the walls, the place, indeed, used to be a pool hall
Niles and Garfield go all the way to the back, while Twist stays near the front with the old man
Looks all right
It's big enough and off the street
don't know
This is kinda short notice
'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday
Got to
Gondorff's ridin' the mark in from New York on the Century
Garfield thinks it over a little
He's taking another look at the place
We go to Twist and the old man by the door
We'll take it
(pointing through the door) You manage the building at the end of the alley
(with pride) For fifteen years
'll need a room over there that faces this way
How much a week
Only rents by the month
Two hundred and fifty for the two of them
(pulling out his wallet) This is the last time  expect to see you down here
(watching the bills being counted into his hand) Never heard of the place
We go back to Niles and Garfield
Been a while since  stocked a wire store
Not many mobs playing that anymore
All we need is the bookie setup for now
We'll worry about the telegraph office later
All right, 'll rent ya everything got in the warehouse for two grand
That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear
You supply the guys to move 'em
If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand
don't know where the hell 'm gonna get 'em though
'mon, you can do better than that
We ain't no heel grifters
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya
It's gonna take hours just to clean it up
(pause) Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item
Where am  gonna be if he gets hit
Just give us what ya can, Benny
We'll send a truck down
Twist has rejoined them by now
(to Garfield) You wanna work flat rate or percentage
Who's the mark
Doyle Lonnegan
Flat rate
: - We pick up Doyle Lonnegan, accompanied by two bodyguards and Floyd, making his way through the station
He stops at a cigar counter to buy some cigarettes, and we reveal Gondorff and Hooker sitting on their suitcases on the other side of the room
(eyes fixed on Lonnegan) Guy in the blue pinstripe and grey fedora
Hooker looks and finally spots him in the crowd
We go back to Lonnegan, as he moves off from the cigar counter, toward his train
Hooker watches him with the intensity of one gazing on a religious object
He's not as tough as he'd like to think
(picking up his suitcase) Neither are we
: Lonnegan and his retainers getting on the train
Two cars down the line, we see Hooker and Gondorff boarding also
On his way in, Gordorff takes the conductor aside
hear there's a friendly poker game on this train tonight
You know anything about that
little
You think you could get me in that game
don't know
There's usually a waiting list
Gondorff flashes a $50 bill
(loosening up a bit) That'll get you first alternate, sir
Gondorff pulls out another fifty
(taking the money) 'll see what  can do
: - Kid Twist enters and threads his way through the maze of tables to a door at the back of the building
large bull of a man is stationed there, obviously to discourage those who don't have credentials to enter
Twist is not such a man
(going right on through) How ya doin', Lacey
(innocently pleased for one so menacing) Good to see ya again, Twist
- Inside is another room, this one much better lit than the outer one
There are only three tables in here, around which are seated the elite of the Con World
Twist is enthusiastically greeted by Duke Boudreau, a large, rotund man whose stylish dress and authoritative manner mark him as a powerful figure in this group
Twist
When did you get back in town
Coupla days ago
'm workin' a big one with Gondorff on the North Side
The two men sit down together, apart from the others
Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store
need a twenty man boost right away
got twenty or so in here tonight
Take your pick
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky
We can't afford to rank the joint
(to one of his assistants) Get me the sheet, Jake
Let's see who's in town
: silhouetted figure appears in the entrance doorway
The word "chill" races from table to table and the place falls still
The bartender pushes a button behind the bar and a buzzer goes off in the back room
Boudreau gets up from his table and opens a small viewing port in the door
The silhouetted figure is now walking slowly past the silent tables
It's Snyder and he's checking out every face in the place
Twist, you know this guy
(taking a look through the viewing port) No
Never saw him before
He's a dick, though
Snyder walks all the way to the back, and then retraces his route
About halfway back, he stops at one of the tables, recognizing a grifter he knows
It's the Eirie Kid
Hello, Snyder
What are you doin' up here
'm on vacation
You seen your friend lately
Yeh, he packed it in and enrolled in detective school
Snyder, in no mood for jokes, grabs Eirie by the hair and slams his face into the table
Eirie just stays there; he knows it doesn't pay to assault a detective
Twist is watching all this intently from the viewing port
You see him, you tell him to pay his debts before  get him
Eirie raises his head slowly, but says nothing
There is a slight trickle of blood from his nose
Snyder turns and walks slowly out of the bar
When he is a safe distance down the street, the chatter and drinking resume
: Twist gives an all clear signal and returns to the table where he and Boudreau were talking
Boudreau reads from a list of names
Twist listens with a certain preoccupation
He's still thinking about the little confrontation he just witnessed
Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the Big Alabama are in from New Orleans
Fiskin and the Boone Kid from Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and Limehouse Chappie from New York
Those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from
Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00
We're gonna run through the route tonight
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up,  can't do ya no good downtown
Gondorff is Federal
Don't worry about it, pal
: - Ripping through an open stretch between New York and Chicago
: - Singleton is walking down a passageway and stops at a door and goes in
'  - Gondorff is rapidly shuffling cards to four empty places
He is alone
He looks up as Singleton enters
You in
Yeh,  think so
gave the kay- ducer a -note
You find out the deck
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza
(handing him two sealed decks) got you one of each
He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's
Nice work,
Singleton slips out as Gondorff unpeels the packs
- We pick up Lonnegan coming out of his compartment, flanked by only one bodyguard and Floyd
He starts through the passenger section toward the compartment where the poker game will be held
Suddenly a drunken woman comes staggering around the corner and bumps into him
They grapple a moment and Lonnegan pushes her away in disgust
(sloppy drunk) Keep your mitts off me, ya big lug
If 'da wanted you handlin' me woulda asked ya
Lonnegan ignores her and proceeds down the passageway
As the woman proceeds in the other direction between passengers, we see it is Billie
She drops something on a seat beside a passenger
hand reaches to pick it up
It is Lonnegan's wallet and it is Hooker who picks it up
Hooker waits a moment, then stands and goes in the direction Lonnegan has taken
He passes by the open door to the card room, hesitating only slightly to hear the greetings exchanged inside before the door is shut
Then he continues on into the next car
He turns into Gondorff's compartment
: '  - Gondorff is still practicing
He looks up as Hooker enters and tosses him the wallet
She got him clean
He hasn't missed it
Gondorff nods, takes the money out, counts it
Fifteen grand
Looks like he's expecting a big night
He takes out his own wallet and puts the money in it, and tosses the empty wallet back to Hooker, and resumes his shuffling and dealing
Hooker sits back silently and watches him
He's waitin' for you in the card room
Let him wait
As he deals, on the second pass he attempts to cut from the bottom, muffs it completely and sprays half the deck on the table
Hooker regards him steadily as he gathers them back up
Gondorff finally meets his gaze
You just worry about your end, kid
If we ever get to it
: - specially outfitted compartment with a table and chairs in the middle and leather cushions around the outside for kibitzers
Lonnegan and 3 other players are already there and seated
They're getting slightly impatient
(to the Conductor) Where the hell is this guy
don't know
He said he'd be here
: ' Gondorff is standing in front of the mirror dressing
He grabs up a clean white shirt and rumples it up in his hands
He then picks up a half-full bottle of bourbon
Hooker gives him a disapproving look
Gondorff smiles and pats some on his face
: Everybody's itchy now
All right, let's start without him
Mr
Clemens, give me the cards
The Conductor hands him a sealed deck
As he begins to open it, Gordoff comes into the room, coatless, rumpled, unshaven and looking slightly tipsy
The others at the table, all men of high school or financial standing, are somewhat put off
Sorry 'm late boys
was takin' a crap
This bit of grossness does little to improve his image
(making the introductions; referring first to Gondorff) Mr
Shaw is a bookmaker from Chicago
Mr
Shaw, meet Mr
Clayton from Pittsburgh, Mr
Jameson, Chicago, Mr
Lonnegan, New York and Mr
Lombard, Philadelphia
Gondorff nods and takes a seat, none too gracefully
Straight poker, gentlemen
100 dollar minimum, table stakes
We assume you're good for your debts
(shuffling the cards) Mr
Shaw, we usually require a tie at this table
If you don't have one, we can get ya one
Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr
Lonneman
(irritated) Lonnegan
He begins to deal, obviously not pleased that his evening seems to be peopled with drunks
: - truck is now parked at the end of the alley, and several workmen are busy unloading it
One group carries a large blackboard; others have boxes of glasses, ash tray stands, furniture, etc
Take several cuts
: - Now a blaze of activity
We take several cuts of workmen papering the walls, tacking down carpet, putting in new light fixtures, painting signs, all under the supervision of Niles
From now on, we will refer to the pool hall as the store
Back in the office, Kid Twist is "interviewing" one by one, a group of con men lined up outside the office door gray-haired old buzzard, Curly Jackson, approaches the table which is serving Twist as a desk
Curly is practically in rags and has several days growth on his face
He wears a little beret which he takes off to address Twist
Name's Curly Jackson
worked for Gad Bryan outa Baltimore
You ever played the Wire, Curly
Used to rope for it long ago can shill, mark board, anything you want
don't run with riffraff and  only drink on weekends
(affecting an English accent) Me specialty is an Englishman
Twist is taken with the man, despite his appearance
All right, Curly, you're in
We got a rack of suits over there
Get yourself a nice tweed one
(exiting) That's all right
got all my own stuff
: Gondorff and Lonnegan have most of the chips
Lonnegan is slightly ahead
Gondorff has made a token attempt to wear the provided tie, having tied it in a knot around his neck, but not having bothered to put it under his collar
He has a shot glass and a bottle next to him, from which he has been drinking heavily
He and Lonnegan are the only ones left in this hand
(throwing chips in) Raise 500
(likewise) See ya and raise three
(more chips) See and raise five
Five and call
Lonnegan lays down his hand, a solid two pair
Gondoroff turns out three tens
Lonnegan is beat
Tough luck, Lonnihan, but that's what you get for playin' with your head up your ass
Couple more like that and we can all go to bed early, huh boys
Lonnegan burns, and the "boys" have no comment
: - The work is still progressing
We see two workmen installing a ticket tape machine in a secluded area of the store
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire
He's got eyes at every track in the country
You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em
Does
know how to use this thing
All he's gotta do is read
We go to Kid Twist, still conducting interviews in the office
young, rather sullen man, Buck Duff, steps to the table
Buck Duff
was in Maxwell's boost in Troy
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up
Wasn't no problem a mine
He was a con man, wasn't he
He was a tear-off rat
He got what he deserved
No sense helpin' pay his bills
(like ice) Shove off, Duff
Duff stands there a second and then slouches away from the table
He stops however, by the door
The next man up is the Eirie Kid
Twist knows he's seen him somewhere before
(nervous as hell) Names's Joe Eirie
Twist waits for more, but it's not coming
You played for any particular mobs
No
You know the Wire at all
No
never played no Big Con before
But Luther Coleman was a friend a mine
thought maybe there was something  could do
(pointing to Eirie slightly swollen nose) You get that nose in Duke Boudreau's tonight
Eirie nods a reluctant "yes
" You got moxie, Eirie
Get yourself a suit
Eirie is so happy, he can barely blurt out a thank you
Buck Duff, enraged that Twist would hire a total amateur, turns in disgust and strides vengefully out of the store
: The room is dense with smoke now, and the players are feeling the heat
Gondorff has his white shirt open, revealing a stained -shirt underneath
The bottle next to him is almost empty
He sneezes and wipes his nose with the tie Lonnegan gave him
The chips are now about equally divided between Gondorff and Lonnegan
The others are losing badly
Raise 300
Pass
(throwing in his last few chips) Raise 200
Two and call
Jameson lays down two pair
Gondorff has a flush
Gondorff rakes in the chips, which now put him ahead of Lonnegan
Well, 'm out
Don't worry about it, pal
Lemongan here wouldn'ta let you in the game if you weren't a chump
(getting to his feet) 've had enough of your lip, Shaw
Gondorff grabs the whiskey bottle next to him, breaks it against the table and waves the jagged end in Lonnegan's face
(barely able to stand up) Just take it easy there, Larrabee
Jameson and the conductor step in between
Let's take a break for a couple minutes and cool off
Lonnegan storms out of the room, followed by Floyd and Bodyguard
We pick up Lonnegan coming down the passageway to enter the smoking room
(to his assistant) 've had it with that bum, Floyd
Stack me a cooler
(trying to settle him down) You've only been playin three hours, Doyle
(not to be pacified) don't care
Load me a deck
Set it up for threes and nines
'll cut it in on his deal
(taking a deck and beginning to sort it) What do ya want the others to get
Nothin'
They gotta be outa there early
'm gonna bust that bastard in one play
: - pair of hands shuffling
We pull back to reveal that they're Gondorff's
He passes the deck to Lonnegan to be cut and turns to pen a new whiskey bottle
Lonnegan takes the deck and in one lightning motion substitutes a new deck, while making it look like he's cutting the old one
Gondorff picks up the deck and begins to deal
As the hand is picked up, we see that Gondorff has four threes, Lonnegan four nines, and everybody else has nothing
(opening the bidding) Fold
250
Raise 1,000
Raise 500
Gondorff looks at Lonnegan very carefully for a second
Lonnegan meets his stare
(slowly) Raise 2,000
The spectators shift a little
It's the biggest bet of the night
See and raise 1,000
(taking it to him) Raise 5,000
Lonnegan fingers his remaining chips
He knows he's won, but he wants to bleed it for every bit of suspense
(going for broke) See, and raise the rest
Lonnegan pushes in the rest of his chips
Gondorff, who is only required to match Lonnegan's total, throws in all his too
It's a showdown
Call
Lonnegan puts down his four nines
Gondorff just stares at them a second, lets out a deep sigh and lays down four jacks
Lonnegan is aghast
This just can't be
He glances at Floyd, who can do nothing but sit there with his mouth open
(raking in the chips) Well that's all for me tonight, boys
'm gonna leave ya some cab fare
The other players look at each other in disgust, and reach for their wallets, all of which are well stocked
(to Lonnegan) You owe me 15 grand, pal
Lonnegan, with a stare that could kill, reaches for his wallet
Suddenly the stare goes soft
He tries a few more pockets
No soap
(getting up to get it) guess  left it in my room
(blowing up) What
Don't give me that crap you little weenie
How do  know you ain't gonna take a powder
(waving his wallter, which is full of Lonnegan's money) You come to a game like this, you bring your money
Lonnegan, having had all he can take, goes for Gondorff, but is restrained by the conductor
All right, buddy, 'm gonna send a boy by your room in five minutes, and you better have that jack, or it's gonna be all over Chicago that your name ain't worth a dime
Gondorff stalks out of the room
We pick him up coming down the passageway to his compartment
' The drunkenness has vanished
We follow him into his cabin, where Hooker is waiting anxiously
How'd ya do
(modestly) Well we got some workin' money anyway
Gondorff tosses his winnings on the table
(big smile) Okay, kid, you're on
But  gotta tell ya, its a hard act to follow
: '  - Lonnegan sits in a chair smoking, obviously still upset
Floyd paces in front of him
know  give him four threes
We can't let him get away with that
What am  supposed to do
Call him for cheating better than me
There's a knock at the door
Floyd goes and opens it
It's Hooker
My name's Carver
Mr
Shaw sent me
Floyd motions him in without a word
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver
How does he do it
(very matter-of-factly) He cheats
Lonnegan says nothing
He doesn't like smart asses
He looks Hooker over a second, as if considering whether to have him wasted or not
(reaching into his coat pocket) He'll have to take a check
(pulling out a check) couldn't find my wallet
Yeh, he knows that
(startled) What do you mean
(pulling out Lonnegan's wallet and tossing it to him) He hired a dame to take it from ya
Lonnegan just holds the wallet
He can't believe it
You were set up, Lonnegan
Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months
He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya
(the heat rising) could have you put under this train for this, errand boy
(cool as hell) So could Shaw
Then why the rat
Cause 'm tired of bein' his nigger
(pause) want you to help me break him
Lonnegan looks at Hooker long and hard, as if the intensity of his gaze could separate truth from fiction
Lonnegan hadn't expected this, but now that it's here, it better be on the level
The silence is suddenly broken by the noise of the train braking into the station
(to Hooker) 'mon, 'll give ya a lift home
Hooker hesitates, not sure whether to accept or not
What's the matter
You gotta get back to Shaw
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar
Can't see him till morning anyway
All right, then
: '  - Driving through the city, the driver and Floyd in front, Hooker and Lonnegan in back
Hooker glances out the window from time to time, just to make sure they're really going to his place
Why me
Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from
need somebody respectable
but not completely legit
What 'm gonna do isn't very legal
(insulted) 'm a banker, friend
That's legit in this state
All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place
'll supply all the money and the information
Lonnegan is listening, but you'd never know it
If you help me out, 'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself
That's worth fifteen grand to ya
Maybe a couple million
We go to Lonnegan
He's still not talking, but that last phrase has registered
' The car pulls up in front of Hooker's place
You're dreamin', kid
(getting out) 660 Marshall Street
Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested
(diffidently) If 'm not there by quarter of, 'm not coming
Hooker nods and walks up the steps to his apartment building
Lonnegan's car speeds away from the curb and on out of sight
Hooker breathes a sigh of relief
He's passed his first test; or has he
We follow him up the stairs to his room
' He's just about to unlock the door, when he notices the little piece of paper he left in the door is on the floor
Without the slightest hesitation, Hooker leaps over the bannister and races back down the stairs
Two gunmen, Riley and Cole, burst out of his room and fire at him over the railing, but he's already too far down
Riley and Cole give chase
: Riley and Cole barrel out of the building and onto the sidewalk
There is an empty bus stopped at a light, but they find no sign of Hooker
As the light changes, we cut to the other side of the bus, where we see Hooker crouched on the rear wheel housing, hanging on to a vent
He's a little shaken, but most of all, he's still alive
We hold on him, as the bus moves off
(
) Everything go all right
(
) (lying) Yeh, it was easy
: - Hooker and Gondorff are sitting alone in the back office while the work goes on outside
Their conversation continues
No signs of trouble
What do ya mean
You know, somebody tailin' ya torpedo or somethin'
(wanting to get off the subject) No, not a thing
Gondorff has his doubts, but lets them ride
: We concentrate on some of the fine details, i
e
Garfield explaining how the ticker will read out to Singleton and Billie; Curly Jackson showing a younger con man how to mark the odds board properly
(
) How 'bout Lonnegan
(
) gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to
(
) And
(
) He threatened to kill me
(
) Hell, they don't do that and you know you're not gettin' through to 'em
We concentrate on Niles, who's making up the "boodles" or fake bankrollls
He puts a real $100 bill on the bottom, then two inches of cut green paper on top, and then another $100 bill on top of that, so that it looks like he has a whole stack of $100 bills
The bundle is then bound with a sealed label, like those used in banks, that says $10,000
We see that he has already made several of these bundles
(
) Then he drove me home
He tried to put himself away as legit, so went right into the pitch
(
) Did he hold you up on anything
(
) Naw, he just sat there and listened
don't know if he bought it or not
: Twist in the middle of the room giving a route to the Eirie Kid
He shows him where to get his drink at the bar, where to sit and finally how to leap up and throw his racing form down in disgust
(
) That's all right
Once they start listening, they're in trouble
Just don't give him more than he asks for
If you rattle his imagination a little, he'll come up with all the right answers himself
But all he's gotta do is catch you in one lie and you're dead
: They both look tired
You think he'll show
Did he say he wouldn't
No
(softly) He'll show
: : At first it appears to be deserted, but we move to reveal a figure in an upper window of the apartment building which forms one side of the alley
It's Kid Twist
His eyes roam the street, for what, we do not yet know
: - Probably prosperous at one time, it has since declined, its large fountain and eating area bow host to two bums and Hooker, who sits alone in a rear booth near the telephone
Dressed in a tuxedo, he nurses a cup of coffee, and anxiously alternates his glances between the clock and the empty street outside
It's 12:52
: - The place is full of people, although we avoid long shot so as not to give away the room as a whole yet
Instead, we concentrate on the tense, waiting faces of some of the more familiar people: Gondorff and Niles in tuxedos behind a barred cashier's area
Gondorff mutilates a piece of gum in his mouth
Niles just stares out into space cracking his knuckles
Eddie, cut that out, will ya
The boardmarker walking nervously back and forth in front of his odds board, checking every letter and number
He stops to cross a  on one of the horses' names
It was already crossed, but he does it again anyway
Billie and Singleton, in an area hidden from the rest of the room, watching the print-out on the ticker machine
The clicking of the ticker is the only sound we hear in the store
Curly Jackson in front of a mirror, pasting a fake Van Dyke on his chin to go with his tweed suit and monocle
couple of Billie's girls adjusting their waitress outfits and primping their hair
Each has a tray full of drinks beside her
The Eirie Kid silently retracing his "route" to make sure he has it down
Despite the crowd, there is no talking and little movement, save for the constant swirling of smoke from several cigars and cigarettes
The group is like a theatre company waiting to go on opening night
: It's 12:56 and Hooker is worried
He looks up to see two large men, obviously racket goons, come in the front door, and take a seat facing him in the next booth
They stare at him impassively, waving the waitress away when she comes to take their order
Hooker knows they're Lonnegan's men, but is somewhat unsettled by the fact that Lonnegan is not with them
Suddenly, a voice
Carver
Hooker turns around to find that Lonnegan is seated in the booth directly behind him
His bodyguard is in the one behind that
You should always look to the back too, kid
(sliding out of his booth and into Lonnegan's) was afraid you weren't gonna come
We haven't got much time
(curtly) Get on with it then
(pointing to telephone) Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse
(pulling out a wad of bills) All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony
There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time
We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet
This is just a test
The big one comes later
Be careful with that though, it's all  got
And you were gonna pay me back
am after this race
Lonnegan says nothing
He's not sure he likes a man who's stupid enough to bet his last dollar on a horse race
gotta get back before Shaw misses me
Good luck
Hooker hustles out across the street and into the alley
Lonnegan watches him through the window and then settles back in his seat to wait for the phone
As Hooker descends the stairwell into the store, he gives Kid Twist the office
Twist turns away from the window and looks at his watch
12:58
: Lonnegan waiting by the phone, idly pinging a knife on the salt shaker
It's 1:40
man enters the store and walks over to use the phone
We're waitin' for a call
The man looks at Lonnegan a second, and then at his four goons
He decides maybe he'll make the call later
: Kid Twist again
Billie enters the room with a piece of paper
Kid Twist looks at it a second and then picks up the pohne and begins to dial
Lonnegan again
He's getting impatient now and lights a cigarette, and then the phone rings
He answers it quickly and we hear: Bluenote at 6 to 1 on the nose
The receiver clicks down at the other end
Lonnegan hangs up and goes out the door, followed by his entourage
We follow him across the street and into the alley, where he signals one of the bodyguards to check the place out
Kid Twist pushes a button on his window sill, and a buzzer goes off inside the store
The previously inert figures there spring to life
Lonnegan's bodyguard descends the stairwell and knocks at the door, where he is greeted by Hooker in the capacity of host
He looks the place over and motions an okay to Lonnegan
As Lonnegan enters, we see the room for the first time in its entirety
Overnight it has been transformed into a swank private club, with bar, cigarette girls, upholstered furniture and chandeliers
Look at that
He's got four apes with him
That's what  like about these guys,
They always got protection against things we'd never do to 'em
Everywhere there is activity
bank of telephones buzzes incessantly
Sheet writers scurry from phone to phone, taking bets of tremendous size from prominent people
Yes, Mr
Ruth, 20,000 on Dancing Cloud
We reveal that the phones are controlled by a master switch, which one of the recruited con men operates from behind a partition
The boardmaker, wearing headphones suspended from a sliding wire, hurriedly chalks up races and odds on a huge blackboard
From the loudspeakers we hear the words "last flash
" The odds on Bluenote settle down to 8 to 1
Lonnegan makes his way through the throng toward the betting line
His bodyguards fan out to various positions in the room
The betting crowd itself (known as the "boost") consists of close to twenty people, none of whom, of course are what they're pretending to be
There are brokers with pasty faces, sportsmen, tanned and casual, and financiers with goatees and highly tailored clothes
Large amounts of money are changing hands at the betting window
Boodles are in sight everywhere
Lonnegan slips into the betting line, feeling somewhat estranged from the general merriment around him
There are two men in line ahead of him
The first, Curly Jackson, slaps down several bundles of cash in front of Niles, who's the cashier, and places a $20,000 bet on War Eagle
Gondorff appears at the cashier's window and catches sight of Lonnegan
Never get enough, huh pal
'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan
(piercingly) The name is Lonnegan
(to Niles) Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie
He's got the name for bettin' money he don't have
The man in front of Lonnegan puts $5,000 on Dancing Cloud
He makes the bet on credit
Lonnegan steps to the window
Two-thousand on Bluenote
(writing out a ticket) Is that all
(pissed) That's all
Bluenote's race is now up on the board
The race caller comes on the loudspeaker
Ladies and Gentlemen
This is Arnold Rowe, your caller for the second race at Belmont in New York
mile and 1/8
Four year olds and up
And they're off
We see that the caller is Singleton, and that he's calling the race from a concealed booth next to the cashier's cage
Around the first turn it's a War Eagle first by a length, Jail Bate second by one and a half, Dancing Cloud third by a half on the outside, followed by Lucky Lady, Mojo, Wits' End and Bluenote
Lonnegan goes to the bar, orders a drink, and settles down at one of the tables
It happens to be the one the Eirie Kid is at
Gondorff and Niles watch it from the cashier's cage
(worried) That's not where we want him to sit
Eirie tries to ignore Lonnegan at first, but realizes he better make some conversation
'mon War Eagle
(to Lonnegan) That Dancing Cloud's a hell of a finisher
War Eagle's gonna have to open up a little more on 'em
You know anything about a horse named Bluenote
Naw, he's never done much
Probably in here just to round out the field
War Eagle's where you wanna have your money
Eirie excuses himself and heads for the bar
Into the clubhouse turn, it's War Eagle by two lengths, Dancing Cloud has moved up to second by a half, Lucky Lady is third by three followed by Jail Bait, Mojo, Bluenote and Wits' End
The heretofore chaotic energy of the parlor is now focused on the race
Several of the patrons begin to yell for their horses
Lonnegan remains seated
He seems bored with it all
Hooker comes over to clear some empty glasses from his table
(out of the corner of his mouth) You really picked a winner, kid
Give 'em a little time
Into the backstretch it's War Eagle still by a length, Dancing Cloud closing on the inside, is second by two, Lucky Lady is third by one and a half, followed by Bluenote, Jail Bait, Wits' End and Mojo
Lonnegan perks up just a little
Bluenote, at least, has moved up
The rest of the people in the place are really rooting now
Few of them remain seated
Hooker arrives at the bar, with the glasses he cleared from Lonnegan's table
Eirie is already there, fortifying himself with a scotch
You're doin' great, Eirie
He loves ya
Eirie nods, somewhat unconvinced, and heads bak to the table
Into the far turn, it's Dancing Cloud now by half a length, War Eagle is second by two, Bluenote is third by a half and moving fast on the outside
Lucky Lady is fourth by four lengths, followed by Jail Bait, Wits' End and Mojo
Lonnegan is getting more intent now
Coming down the stretch, it's Dancing Cloud by one length, War Eagle and Bluenote are neck and neck by two
Now it's Dancing Cloud, Bluenote and War Eagle
(shouting now) Dancing Cloud and Bluenote head to head
The place is going crazy
Even Singleton is standing up to get the necessary excitement in his voice
Dancing Cloud, Bluenote
Dancing Cloud, Bluenote
It's Bluenote by a nose
Dancing Cloud is second by two, War Eagle third by three and a half
Time for a mile and 1/8, 2:01 and 6/10 seconds
Most of the patrons collapse into their chairs like spent lovers
Eirie slams his racing form to the floor
Nobody had Bluenote
(tearing up his ticket) Bloody awful
Who in blazes is Bluenote
(to Eirie, very self-satisfied) War Eagle's where you want to have your money, huh
Eirie doesn't reply
He can't believe Bluenote won
Lonnegan looks to Hooker
Hooker gives him a wink
For the first time, Lonnegan permits a smile
: ' Niles is counting out $16,000 to him (all of which Gondorff won the night before)
Gondorff looks somewhat perturbed
Lonnegan picks up the money and tauntingly waves it at him
(getting his name right this time) Don't bother to come back with a piker's bet like that again, Lonnegan
We got a $5,000 minimum here
(to Hooker) Show this bum out
Hooker hesitates a second
Go on, ya goddamn ninny
Gondorff gives Hooker a hard shove in the back with his foot, sending him into a table and sprawling to the floor
(indicating Lonnegan's bodyguards) And tell him not to bring his garbage men in here no more
This is a class joint
Hooker, pretending to be humiliated, gets to his feet and escorts Lonnegan to the door
Lonnegan stops, gives Gondorff a derisive smile, and walks out
Once he's gone, the general clatter and hubbub in the room cease, like it had been turned off by a faucet
Most of the boost sit down and relax
Curly Jackson rips off his Van Dyke
It's been itching him
He's gaffed, kid
He should start coming to you now
: '     - Combs sits passively on the edge of his desk glancing across the room every now and then at Riley, who is slumped uneasily in a folding chair, looking like a defendant at the Inquisition
Both remain silent, like two men in a waiting room
Suddenly, what they've been waiting for arrives
Lonnegan comes into the office, flanked by his bodyguards
Skipping the usual pleasantries, he walks right over to Riley
All right, Riley
What the hell happened
(not looking at him) We missed him
You weren't hired to miss him
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there
We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall
Somebody musta wised him up
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that
don't know
He took it hard
All right, get outa here
You're outta work
Riley gets up and drags himself out the door like a whipped dog
We'll put Salino on it
need somebody careful
Salino
Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this
It ain't no heavy gee we're after
The guy's a five and dime grifter
Then why ain't he dead
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all
They'll get him next time
Use Salino
It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it
Combs gives up
The second time's the charm
And tell Cole  wanta see him when he gets in
He's not comin' in
Not to get bounced off a job anyway
He had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house
Made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops, but didn't hit nothin'
Combs keeps his mouth shut
There's no way to talk to Lonnegan when  he's like this
(cooling a little) This is Salino's job now, Vince
If Cole wants to muscle in on it, that's his business
But he's breakin' the rules and when Salino finds out about it,  can't feel sorry for what's gonna happen to him
: '  - The finest the period had to offer
We pick up Hooker coming down the hall to Lonnegan's suite
He is admitted by the Bodyguard
Lonnegan, wearing a smoking jacket, is seated at a table counting a pile of money
There are two other assistants standing behind him
They don't look friendly
Well, what did  tell ya
You're a lucky man, all right
Lucky, hell
could do it every day
Why don't ya then
'Cause it's better to do it all at once
(leaning close) We're puttin' down 400 grand next week
At 5-1 we make 2 million
Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us
You got a system, Carver
You stayin' in or not
'm in
(drawing up a chair, barely able to contain his enthusiasm) It's foolproof
We got a partner downtown runs the central office of the Western Union
Race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies
All he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner
Then he releases the results to the bookies and we clean up on a race that's already been run
It can't miss, unless the Western Union Dicks get onto it
Lonnegan is amazed
He sits back a second, then comes forward again and pushes a pile of bills over to Hooker
Hooker smiles and begins to count the money
You got the 400 grand yet
Not yet, but
(stopping suddenly) Hey, there's only a grand here
(more like a command) think we oughta place another bet tomorrow
(getting angry) What is this
That's my money
You tryin' to muscle me
(controlled) If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more
Hooker's in a jam and he knows it
(after a pause) gotta talk to me partner first
We can't afford to expose our game too much
Let me talk to him
(flatly) No
You want your money back
Try and get it in a court of law
(softening a bit) 'mon, don't be a sorehead
'll make it worth your while
Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out
Hooker says nothing for a minute, and then reluctantly nods his head
Four o'clock tomorrow
Pick me up at Dewey Lyle's
: '  - We pick up Hooker coming out of the hotel and going off down the street
As he does so, we pull back all the way across the street and through the interior of a parked car to reveal the silhouette of a man seated at the wheel
We move to his right hand, which rests on the steering column
It's covered by a black glove and the middle finger is missing
His trigger finger, however, taps lightly on the wheel
: - One of the old, wooden kind -- accordian doors with glass panes in the upper half
Hooker dials rapidly
Twist
told him the tale
He wants to see ya
All right, when
Tomorrow, after 4:00
Stay inside, 'll come in and get ya
And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money
Okay, Tootsie
Hooker blows a mock kiss through the phone and hangs up
He turns to leave the booth, when suddenly he sees something that stops him cold
There looking through the glass is the smirking face of Detective Synder
Hooker is immobilized
Snyder puts his hand inside his coat and slowly draws out his gun
He points it right at Hooker's face and then violently smashes all the glass in the upper half of the door with the barrel
Fragments of glass spray into the booth, a couple of which imbed themselves in Hooker's cheek
Hooker quickly whips open the door, trapping Snyder's hand in the accordian and jarring loose his gun
Hooker sprints out of the booth as Snyder scrambles for his pistol and gives pursuit
-  - We follow the two men up alleys and sidestreets as they race through the dregs of the city, two panting shadows moving through places that only get light at night
The wind blows drops of blood off Hooker's cheek as he runs
Snyder still has his gun, but would rather inflict pain than death
Hooker makes for a condemned building and scrambles up the stairs, steps giving way under him as he goes
On the fourth floor, he ducks into a room and quickly locks the door
We pan the room to reveal that the whole back side of the building is gone
Hooker runs toward the ledge and leaps through the air, landing on the fire escape of an adjacent building, some 15 feet away
He kicks in a window and goes off down the hall
We cut back to Snyder furiously kicking in the locked door
He finally crashes through, only to find an empty room and a beautiful panorama of the city and its nearest Hooverville
: - Winding his way through the slum area of town, dashing along backstreets, over fences and through vacant lots, making good his escape
From our angle, he looks like a rat in a maze
(
) Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before
(
) thought 'd lost him
: '      - Hooker sits sullenly at the table
Billie stands over him putting some ointment on his face to close the cuts
Gondorff looks on
Their discussion continues
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it
What else haven't ya been tellin' me
Nothin'
told ya everything there is
Then why'd ya move outa your room
It was too noisy
You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker
Hooker doesn't reply
He knows Gondorff's on to him
You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you
All we need is a couple days, Henry
couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em
You just won't learn, will ya
Hell, you come in here,  teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet
(pause) You're just like all them new jerks
Lotsa nerve and no brains
And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'
couple days; that's all 'm askin'
can stay clear that long
(trying to be angry and failing) Christ, they'll probably miss you and hit me
: : - Located across the street from Hooker's apartment building
Hooker sits down alone in a booth, with a plate of ham and eggs he's hardly touched
The two cuts on his face have pretty much stopped bleeding
big fan above the counter area drones away lethargically, it's air stream insufficient to either cool the place or drive out the smell of onions and grease
waitress, Loretta, emerges from the kitchen and ambles slowly over to Hooker's table
Slim and raven-haired, she manifests an indifference bred from years spent delivering things to people who are rarely grateful for what she brings
Only a light scar on her left cheek hints at another side
You done
Yeh,  guess  shoulda had the meat loaf
(deadpan) It isn't any better
Where's June today
(figuring up the bill) She don't work here no more
'm fillin' in for a couple days
till  can get a train outa here
Where you goin'
(putting the check down and walking away) don't know
Depends what train get on
Hooker looks for some sign that she's putting him on
He doesn't get it
He takes out some money, drops it on the table and walks out
: - truck with the words
, stenciled on the side, is parked out front
Two men, wearing overalls and painter's caps, walk into the office to the reception counter, we see that they are Twist and Singleton
(to the receptionist) Excuse me
We're here to paint Mr
Harmon's office
(obviously not expecting them) Mr
Harmon's office
Hold on just a second
She goes to get Mr
Harmon
: - Hooker is standing on the curb outside the diner, obviously waiting for somebody
Lonnegan's car pulls up and Hooker hops in the back
What happened to your face
Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th
She got me with her ring
Lonnegan laughs
: - Mr
Harmon is looking over the authorization papers that Twist and Singleton have given him
He can't find anything wrong with it
Brigham signed it all right can't understand why he didn't tell me
Ah, he's like all them supervisors
They think they're too good for regular people
He says he was in here a while ago and the place was a mess
Harmon looks around, hoping it's not true
We'll try and hurry so we don't keep you out of your office too long
Why can't  work with you in there
Look pal, we gotta cover the floor, the furniture, everything, so we don't spill on nothing
Now if you wanta sit in there with a tarp over your head, you're welcome to it
All right, how long will you be
Hour or two at the most
We do good work
Harmon is resigned
Twist and Singleton pick up their gear and march into the office
Once inside, we notice that the office has an exit door which opens to an outside alley
Twist immediately removes his overalls, revealing the suit and tie he's wearing underneath
He takes out a picture of himself, a woman and three small children, and puts it on Harmon's desk, replacing a similiar picture of Harmon's family
Singleton, meanwhile, has spread a few tarps and begins to paint the walls
: - Lonnegan's car pulls up and stops across the street
We'll go to the side door
We follow Hooker and Lonnegan across the street to the side entrance which opens into: ' Hooker knocks and Twist, of course, answers
Les,  got Mr
Lonnegan with me
He wants to see you a second
(irritated) What the hell's the matter with you
We coulda met at a club or somethin'
thought it might be good for him to see the setup
(hushed) Well we can't talk in here
They're having the place painted
Twist walks over to the intercom on his desk
He leaves the door open so that Lonnegan can get a good look at the office, Twist's picture in it, the painter, etc
Lonnegan's not missing any of it
(talking into the intercom) Miss Barnes, 'm going home a little early today
Tell anyone that calls that they can reach me here in the morning
Thank you
: Harmon's secretary at the other end of the intercom
Mr
Harmon is with her
They look at each other a second and Harmon decides he better see what's happening in his office
He opens the door to find it empty except for a pile of painting equipment and one haphazardly painted wall
: - Dark and somewhat foreboding, its peeling dragons and shoddy lanterns compete for space with the many slot machines and arcade games that line the walls
Hooker, Lonnegan and Twist sit at one of the more secluded tables
They are not eating
Can't do it
There're telegraph inspectors all over the place got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and 'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees
We'll get somebody else to do our betting
could come up with 750 grand in a day if  had a reason to
But who says you will
got a guy can depend on
He's liquidating everything he has for this
You wouldn't even give Carver his money back
need more proof, that's all
Anybody can get lucky once
(stubbornly) On a 6-1 shot
The hell with ya
We'll keep the deal we got
If it works again tomorrow, 'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day
We split 60-40
(feebly, beginning to break) We were getting 50 from our guy
With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet
Either way you end up with 40
Twist hesitates
week's a long time, friend
Anything can happen
All of it bad
He's right, Les
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money
We risk our whole operation for nothing
'll say when we make our bets
Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya
And what do we know about your guy
He says a week, but who knows if it's a month
Lonnegan here's a banker
He can get that dough with no questions asked
Twist says nothing for a minute, then: All right
Be at the booth at 1:00
'll give you all three places this time, Lonnegan
That better be proof enough
Hooker and Lonnegan smile at each other like life-long friends
They get up to leave, and we frame the shot with a coffee cup large in the foreground
As they go out the door, a black-gloved hand with four fingers enters the frame and puts a nickel down next to the cup
: - : - Snyder finishes a donut and a cup of coffee, puts down a dime for the lot and exits
We follow him down the street: To a corner newsstand, where he stops to buy a morning paper
As he peruses it, he's approached by two large, clean-cut men in white skimmers
Are you Lieutenant William Snyder
don't know, what's up
The Captain'd like a few words with ya
Ya got a couple minutes
(completely floored) Yeh, sure
The two men show him to a waiting car
: - Snyder stands in the middle of a dusty old machine room, surrounded by four or five Federal Agents
Visible around the room are several folding cots and portable lockers
The agents have obviously been quartered here temporarily
They all wear white skimmers, save for one, a portly man, Captain Polk, who paces the room smoking
There is something long- suffering about him, as if he wondered how he ever got in a service that thought white skimmers were classy
What is this
got work to do
Sit down and shut up, will ya
Try not to live up to all my expectations
(not in the mood to screw around) We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker
Snyder doesn't answer
Do ya know him or don't ya
Yeh, but  don't know where he is
Well we do
He's chummin' around with a Big  named Henry Gondorff
Ring any bells
Sure
Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here
We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold
All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us
Why don't you pick him up yourself
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him
If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing
Wouldn't that be too bad
You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got
(enraged) Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot
spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off
But it's not gonna happen this time
We're not even gonna let the police know we're here
If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya
And you better take it, cause  can make ya work for us without it
What the hell good is Hooker to ya
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us
He'll never do it
(self-satisfied) think he will
: - Lonnegan sits by the phone, watching the clock and sipping a cup of coffee
: - Specifically, the small room from which Singleton does his race broadcasts
Singleton, himself, is hunched over the ticker machine, reading the print-out
Billie sits at the microphone table with a pencil and pad, ready to write
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters
Single Action second, Fasanella third
What's the line on Visitation
(checking further up on the print-out sheet) 7 to 2
That ain't bad
He'll probably fall down
Gondorff appears at the doorway
How ya doin'
(eyes still glued to the ticker) Nothin' yet
got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'
Best we had was Cat's Eye in the second at Del Mar, and he was only 5-2
Not many longshots comin' in today
(excited) Billie
You ready
Billie prepares to write on her pad
Yeh, go ahead
At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third
(reading up the sheet again) Line on Single Action
3 to 2
Hell with it, that's no good
Billie crumples up the piece of paper she's been writing on and chucks it in a wastecan
We don't need big odds on this one, Take anything you get at 3-1 or better
Gondorff leaves the room, as Singleton turns back to his vigil at the ticker
(a little weary) Okay, the Fairfield Stakes at Santa Anita
Mile and a quarter for 3 year olds and up
: Everyone is in his place as before
Today, however, Curly Jackson is playing the part of the aging sport
Well scrubbed and clean shaven, he cuts a dashing figure in his blue blazer and white pants
We go to Gondorff in the cashier's cage
He's talking to Niles, who's busy handing out fake bankrolls to members of the boost
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie
How much cash we got
Not enough to cover a bet that big
Get a couple extra guys in the line, then
We'll give him the shut-out
Niles nods
: - Lonnegan is still waiting
He takes the 20 grand out of his coat pocket and thumbs through it, just to make sure it's all there
: - Singleton and Billie at the ticker again
Billie looks a little sleepy
Singleton is obviously involved with the progress of a race
Okay, Billie, here we go
Billie snaps to and prepares to write as Singleton reads
At the wire it's Wrecking Crew the winner by five, Grand Theft second, Wingless third
(reading up) Wrecking Crew was
4 to 1
(ripping the sheet out of the ticker) That's our boy
Billie and Singleton hustle out of the room
We follow Billie through the store and across the alley to the building from which Twist keeps his lookout
: Gondorff, holding the ticker sheet Singleton has given him, emerges from the office and starts giving instructions to the boost
All right, Furey, your horse is Wingless
Paltrow, the Big Alabama and Phillips'll take Grand Theft
Rodgers and Eirie have Wrecking Crew
Jackson -- His Dandy, Cowan -- Change of Heart, Fiskin and Chappie -- Made to Order
(pointing to the Eirie Kid) Eirie, he gets a bang outa seein' you lose, so we oughta use that on 'em
If you play the birds of a feather routine we worked on, it should steam him up pretty good
You think you can handle that
(a little nervous) Yeh, sure
, you guys in line take your time, and  wanta see lotsa joy on Wrecking Crew
: '  - Billie enters and gives Twist the piece of paper she wrote the race results on
He picks up the phone and starts to dial
: - The phone rings and Lonnegan answers it
Wrecking Crew at 4-1, Grand Theft to place, Made to Order to show
Lonnegan smiles and hangs up the phone
: - Lonnegan's in line at the betting window
There are four people in front of him this time, and they are moving rather slowly
The "Last Flash" call is heard on the speakers
(getting impatient) 'mon, let's hurry up there
The man at the head of the line turns around and gives Lonnegan a chilling look, as if he were beneath contempt
He puts down $25,000 on Grand Theft
The next man in line plunges down $30,000 on Wrecking Crew
Just as Lonnegan is about to step to the window, Gondorff gives a quick signal to Singleton
The speakers come on
Ladies and Gentlemen, this is Arnold Rowe, your caller for the $100,000 Fairfield Stakes at Hollywood Park in Los Angeles mile and 3/8 for three year olds and up
And they're off
(counting out his money) Twenty-thousand on Wrecking Crew
'm sorry, sir
We can't take bets after the race is started
He points to a sign above the window, which says exactly that
Lonnegan grabs up his money in disgust
Don't take it so hard, pal
You probably woulda lost it
Lonnegan wanders over to the bar in a funk
And around the first turn it's Wrecking Crew by a half length, Grand Theft second by one, His Dandy is third by one half, followed by Change of Heart, Back Flip, Made to Order and High Ground
The assembled patrons are once again thoroughly involved in the race
Eirie comes up to Lonnegan at the bar
Who you got
(half-heartedly) Wrecking Crew
Me too
Maybe it's our day
Lonnegan nods and wanders away
Hooker comes over to him
What happened
didn't get the bet down in time
(pissed) Oh, Jesus
: Gondorff and Niles, back in the office
(looking out at the floor) Looks like he's sulking
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever
: Coming for home, it's Wrecking Crew by six lengths, Made to Order is second by two and a half, High Ground is third by a length and Grand Theft is coming fast on the rail
It's Wrecking Crew, Made to Order and Grand Theft
Wrecking Crew wins it by five lengths, Grand Theft is second by a nose, Made to Order is third by two
Time for one and 3/8 mile, 2:11 and 4/10 seconds
Eirie explodes in a joyous frenzy
He grabs Lonnegan by the shoulders and shakes him
We won
We won
You hear that won 30,000
You hear that
Yeh, Lonnegan heard that
Lonnegan shakes loose, grabs his coat and heads for the door
- He finds Hooker waiting for him outside
Tell your friend 'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow
We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better
And make sure  can get to that window this time
How am  gonna do that
(coarsely) don't know, figure something out
Lonnegan storms across the street to his waiting car and drives off
Hooker relaxes into a smile
He's already figured something out
: '
- Hooker sits at the counter finishing a plate of meat loaf
Loretta is down at the cash register, leaning on the counter, looking idly out into space
Hooker glances over at her every once in a while to see if she might be interested in striking up a little conversation
She's not
He finishes his meal and comes down to the register to pay his bill
Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee
(ringing it up) Sixty-five
Hooker gives her a dollar
She goes to the register for change
What time you get off work here
2:00
You doin' anything tonight
(handing him his change) Yeh, sleepin'
Hooker figures that's enough of that
He pockets his change and starts out the door, when suddenly he stops short
Across the street in a doorway is the silhouette of a man
It's Cole
He's pretending not to look at the diner, but Hooker isn't fooled
He goes back to Loretta at the register
You got a back door to this place
No
What's wrong with the front
(urgently now) Look,  don't have time to fuck around
There's somebody out there don't need to see
You got a fire escape or anything
No
All right, do me a favor
Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there
What the hell for
Just do what  tell ya and everything'll be jake
Cracks of concern begin to appear in Loretta's marble
What does this guy want
(evenly) He'd like to kill me
Loretta just looks at him a second
Realizing that this is no joke, she turns and walks slowly but steadily to the bathroom
Hooker waits until she's out of sight
Hooker goes to the front door and steps outside
Cole looks up at the sound of the door
Hooker makes a big show of spotting him, and runs back into the diner
Cole, his cover blown, draws his gun and races across the street in pursuit
Arriving just in time to see -- Hooker go into the bathroom, he charges in after him, only to find the place empty
He goes quickly from stall to stall, on the chance that Hooker might be hiding in one of them
He comes to one that's closed, and seeing a pair of woman's legs under the door, rejects that, and moves on to the next one
We cut inside the stall to reveal Loretta sitting on the toilet with her skirt hiked up
Right behind her, crouched on the back of the seat, is Hooker
Cole has finished his rapid inspection now, and having found nothing, looks around for Hooker's probable escape route
He sees the open window and climbs out to find himself in a small air shaft, from which he knows Hooker could not escape
Hooker, seizing the time, bursts out of the stall and runs back out through the diner
Cole sees him, but too late to get off a shot
He climbs back in the window and gives chase
We pick up Hooker barreling down the street with Cole a hundred yards or so behind
Hooker makes a sharp cut into an alley, and we see immediately that it's a hopeless dead end
Inexplicably, he makes no attempt to run back out
Cole draws up and cuts into the alley, anticipating the kill which should be easy now
He prepares to sight down his victim, when suddenly he realizes there is no victim in sight
Hooker, miraculously, has vanished
Cole scans the alley frantically for some trace of him
There are no windows or doors at the street level
Not even a drain pipe
Just brick wall
It's impossible
Hooker has disappeared into thin air
Cole slams his gun into his shoulder holster with a curse, and starts back out of the alley, when all of a sudden he stops in utter terror
His mouth drops open and he chokes out the words: Salino, hey look
didn't mean to move in on
Before anything else can come out, two bullets rip into his chest
He falls to the concrete, coming to rest on a manhole cover, which we notice is slightly ajar
We: : Beneath the manhole
We see Hooker making his way through the slop, having gained another reprieve, but unaware that with two down, there is still one to go
: '   - Hooker comes in the front entrance and goes to the elevator, one of the old-fashioned kind with the iron grid on the inside
He's still a little rattled and waiting for the elevator is making him restless
It finally arrives, and he steps inside, closing the grid behind him
As he starts to push the button for his floor, he realizes for the first time that he's not alone
He looks to the corner to find Snyder, holding a gun on him
This time there's not much doubt that he'll use it if necessary
: - Snyder brings Hooker into the crate room where Capt
Polk and the other Agents are waiting
Polk, as usual, has his coat off, revealing his shoulder holster
Hello, Mr
Hooker
Captain Polk, (shoving a chair over to him) Have a seat
Hooker remains standing
(ignoring it, drinking from a cup) You want a drink or something
No
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff
Don't think  know him
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb
You wouldn't wanna lie to me
Lt
Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town
Lt
Snyder doesn't know shit
Capt
Polk almost laughs, but he checks it
You got nothin' on me
We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up
Grand larceny, extortion
(with special emphasis) Counterfeiting, anything you want
Hooker says nothing, but it's not from defiance now
He's beginning to get the picture
Look,  got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here
All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump
We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird
No questions, no court appearance, nothing
No
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers
You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight
'll make parole
Like hell
You won't even get a review till you're seventy
And if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin' there later
Hooker wants to come back with something, but can't find it
Don't be a sap, kid
You could save us a little trouble
But Henry Gondorff is through whether you help us or not
There's nothin' left to do now but save yourself
Hooker's thoroughly whipped
He sits down for the first time
(softly) Will you wait until the chump is played
Hell yes
We don't care about the mark
He deserves what he gets
(with heat) mean completely played
Until he's beat and the score is taken
You come in before we beat him and 'll kill him
You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight
(barely audible) Just as long as  get to finish the play
: '  - Gondorff and Hooker are playing gin rummy and drinking
Gondorff makes little comments as he plays, but Hooker is quiet and withdrawn
The carousel is not in operation and a heavy silence hangs over the place
What's the matter, kid
You're not sayin' much
Just a little nervous, that's all
Luther always told me to bite my toenails when  get nervous
You see yourself doin' that and you realize it ain't worth it
Hooker smiles feebly
Billie appears at the door
Things are a little slow tonight, Henry
wanna open the round for the girls
Gondorff takes out a set of keys and tosses them to her
She leaves to go start the merry-go-round
Gondorff settles back into the game
Take it easy, you won't lose him now
We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody
Believe me, 've seen enough to know
(softly) How many guys you conned in your life, Henry
Two or three hundred  guess
Sometimes played two a day when was in Shea's mob
We had it down to a business
(pause) 'Course Chicago was a right town then
The fix was in
The dicks took their end without a beef
All the Wall Street boys wanted to make investments for us
Even had marks looking us up, thinkin' they could beat the game
(pause) Yeh, kid, it really stunk
No sense in bein' a grifter if it's the same as bein' a citizen
Gondorff chucks his cards on the table
He's through for the night
better do some packin'
'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow
Then why you doin' it
Seems worthwhile, doesn't it
Maybe it's just for the cave-in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting
That's good enough
Hooker gets up to leave
Henry
Yeh
(apologetically) appreciate your stickin' your neck out
wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther
Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid
(pause) Revenge is for suckers
been griftin' 30 years and never got any
Hooker just nods and walks out the door
We follow him past the Carousel which is now full of giggling prostitutes in various stages of undress
Their childish frolicking is charming from a group usually so jaded, but it's lost on Hooker tonight
: - It's late now and the street is deserted save for an occasional derelict or streetwalker on her way home from a night's work
We pick up Hooker coming down the street toward his apartment building
He walks slowly, almost reluctantly, as if he didn't care whether he ever got there or not
As he nears his building, he notices Loretta coming out of the diner across the street
He stops and watches as she looks up and disappears into an adjacent building that advertises rooms for rent
After a few seconds, we see a light come on in one of its second story windows
Hooker just stands there a second, debating with himself, trying to figure out a reason for doing what he's going to do anyway
We follow him across the street to Loretta's building and: ' He goes up the stairs to the room where the light came on
He passes a couple of derelicts on the way
He knocks twice and Loretta answers in her bathrobe
She is more than a little startled to see him
Looks like he missed ya
Yeh, this time anyway
Loretta notices an old busybody peeping out at them from her room across the hall
Good night, Mrs
Hillard
Mrs
Hillard quickly closes her door
(shuffling a little) , ah
thought you might wanna come out for a while
Maybe have a drink or somethin'
You move right along, don't ya
(with more innocence than confidence) don't mean nothin' by it
just don't know many regular girls, that's all
And you expect me to come over, just like that
If  expected somethin',  wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall
Loretta looks at him carefully
She knows it's not a line
(with less resistance now) don't even know you
(slowly) You know me
'm just like you
It's two in the morning and  don't know nobody
The two just stand there in silence a second
There's nothing more to say
She stands back and lets him in
: '  - record spinning lazily on an old phonograph
We hear Robert Johnson's "Come On In My Kitchen
" Gondorff is sitting up in bed, with his hat on, lost in thought
Billie is curled up asleep next to him
There's a packed suitcase next to the bed
Billie wakes up and turns over a second
'mon, Henry, knock off
You've done everything you can
Gondorff nods his agreement like a zombie and goes right on thinking
: ' Hooker and Loretta are asleep against each other, their bodies illuminated every few seconds by the light from a neon sign across the street
We dolly to the window and move in on another window in the building next door
There's no light on in it, but we can discern the basic outline of a face behind the curtains, which are slightly parted to afford a view of Hooker's room by a black-gloved hand
" said come on in my kitchen Cause it's gonna be rainin' outdoors
" Music ends
: : We open on Hooker in bed, the morning sun streaming in on his face
He awakens slowly, looks at the ceiling for a second and, remembering last night, turns to the side to find that Loretta is no longer there
Still drowsy, he gets out of bed and looks around the room for a note or some evidence of her continued presence
He opens an empty closet, then opens empty drawers
Finding nothing, he suddenly hits on another possibility, and looks in his wallet
The money is still there
Almost disappointed, he slumps down in a chair, as the harsh reality of what will happen this day floods back in on him
Music begins and we: : - We see the black-gloved hand opening a small wooden box
Wrapped inside is a shiny black revolver, at this point in two pieces
The hand reaches in and takes them out
: - Hooker is poking at a plate of waffles and sausage
The waitress on duty is not Loretta and Hooker has noticed
: '  - Gondorff is standing in front of the bathroom mirror, putting on his tuxedo
He goes to his dresser, pulls out a very small gun and tucks it in his cummerbund
: ' The hand swirls a pipe cleaner inside the barrel of the revolver and picks some lint out of the chamber
He then screws the barrel onto the body
This is all seen in closeup
: ' Hooker now has his tuxedo on
He takes two small rubber bladders out of a drawer and puts them in his pocket
: '  - Lonnegan paces nervously around the room, looking at the clock
Obviously waiting for something, he's getting extremely impatient
: ' We watch the hand carefully loading bullets into the chamber of the revolver
: - Gondorff emerges from his room carrying his suitcase
He stops and looks up at the mezzanine where Billie is standing
They smile sadly at each other and give a simple wave, having done this too many times to get sentimental about it now
Gondorff walks out of the building
: ' Hooker is busily stuffing all his possessions in a paper bag, lumping clothes with food, records and toilet articles
: ' Lonnegan goes to the door to admit Floyd and two assistants, one of whom carries a large brief case
Lonnegan takes the brief case to a table and opens it
Inside is a half million dollars in cash
: ' We see the hand putting a silencer on the revolver
The gunman puts the revolver up to his eye to check the alignment and for the first time we see the face that goes with the hand
It is fully as menacing as we had imagined: Broad, flat nose, thick cracked lips, narrow eyes and cauliflower ears
: ' Hooker is on the phone now
We see that he's talking to Captain Polk
Snyder listens also
' Hooker finishes the conversation, hangs up and goes to take one last look at himself in the mirror
Finding everything in order, he grabs up his sack of possessions and leaves the room
' We pick him up emerging from the building, and follow him around the corner to a secluded alley which he generally takes on his way to the store
As he walks along, he notices Loretta coming toward him from the other end
She's wearing a coat, obviously on her way somewhere
As she comes closer, we move to reveal the gunman appearing suddenly in the alley behind and to the right of Hooker
The gunman quickly takes out his revolver, braces it in the crook of his hand, and takes careful aim
Loretta sees him
The gunman fires
Loretta falls dead on the asphalt
Hooker spins around in confusion
The gunman moves quickly toward him
Hooker starts to back up but the gunman stops when he gets to Loretta
He kicks her over to reveal a gun under her body
She was gonna kill ya, kid
Hooker is stunned
He can't believe it
(dragging the body over behind a trash can) Her name's Loretta Salino
Lonnegan's people set her up in the diner
'mon, let's get outa here
Hooker wants to stay and try to figure it all out, but the gunman drags him away
: - Polk, Snyder and several federal agents are busy putting on their shoulder holsters, and checking their weapons
(to Snyder) Whoever Gondorff's playin' for is bound to be a wheel
As soon as we're inside,  want you to get the guy outa there as fast as possible, before the reporters show up
We can't afford to embarrass any big shots
Snyder nods
: '  - Lonnegan, carrying the brief case personally, is seen getting into his limousine
Four assistants get in with him
: - Gondorff enters the store carrying his suitcase
Several of the boost are already there
Gondorff clasps his hands to generate a little enthusiasm
He's obviously up for this one
: - Hooker sits in the back seat with the gunman right next to him
He's still very uneasy with this man
She coulda killed me last night
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room
She was a professional
Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang
Who are you
Gondorff asked me to look after ya
How do  know you're tellin' the truth
Don't have much choice, do ya
We go to Hooker
No, he doesn't
: - We pick up Polk, Snyder and the other federal agents coming out of the warehouse in their white skimmers, and piling into cars
: Niles is busily spreading "boodles" all over the cashier's area
Singleton checks his microphone
It works fine
He checks it again
: He holds the brief case in his lap, his fingers tapping lightly on it
: Hooker and the gunman enter and go over to Gondorff, who breaks into a wide smile
Hooker returns it halfheartedly, still ill at ease about what has happened
: There are four or five driving in a column
Snyder and Polk ride together in the back of the lead car
: - Lonnegan's limousine pulls up outside, and the bodyguards pile out
: Gondorff, Hooker and the others waiting, the tension expressed in their faces
- Lonnegan sits tensely in the usual booth
He keeps both hands firmly planted on the brief case
The phone rings and Lonnegan goes to it
Music ends
Place it on Syphon at 8-1
Lonnegan hangs up with the look of the financial killer
Eight to one odds is more than even he could have hoped for
We follow Lonnegan across the street and into the store
The bodyguards remain outside
The store is buzzing with activity
Money and booze are everywhere
The sheet writer and the boardmarker can hardly keep up with the action
Lonnegan walks quickly to the betting line and finds to his relief that there's only one man ahead of him
The man puts $25,000 on King's Image
Lonnegan steps to the window, swings up the brief case, and opens it for Niles to see
(straight-faced) Five hundred grand on Syphon
Niles is struck dumb
He's never seen that much money before
(playing the flustered clerk) Hold on, 'll have to get the manager
Niles goes and returns with Gondorff
What's the problem
(pointing to the brief case) He wants to put a half million on Syphon
Gondorff looks at the money a second and then looks up at Lonnegan like he's gotta be crazy
(uneasily) can't lay that off in time
We lose a bet that big, it could break us
(challenging) If ya win it could make ya, too
(to Niles) What are the odds on Syphon
Eight to one
Gondorff looks at Lonnegan long and hard
half mill on an eight to one shot
You're dumber than  thought, Lonnegan
You're more gutless than  thought
The words "Last Flash" are heard on the speaker
Gondorff looks at Lonnegan with utter contempt
He turns to Niles
(chopped) Take it
Niles hurriedly writes out a slip for 500,000 dollars
Lonnegan, allowing himself a sly smile, picks it up and retires to a nearby table
He flashes a little okay sign to Hooker who acknowledges it with a nod
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Arnold Rowe, your caller for the San Antonio Handicap at Pimlico in Baltimore --  mile and 1/16 for three-year-olds
And they're off
Lonnegan takes a deep breath and leans forward in his chair, the larceny boiling in his veins
Hooker looks to Gondorff
Gondorff gives him the "office
" Hooker has to smile
And around the first turn it's King's Image by a neck, Syphon is second by one, Key to the Vault third by one half, followed by Mr
Moonlight, Red Ridge, Moneyman and No Charge
Unexpectedly, Kid Twist bursts in through the entrance
Barely able to control his enthusiasm, he hurries over to Lonnegan's table and sits down next to him
Sorry, but  just couldn't wait
Did everything go all right
(motioning for him to keep his voice down) Take it easy
Everything's all right
put it on Syphon, on the nose
(in utter horror) On the nose
said place
Place it on Syphon
That horse is going to run second
Lonnegan looks like he's just been stabbed
He vaults over the table to the teller's window and grabs Niles
You give me my goddamn money back
You hear me
There's been a mistake
'm sorry, sir
The betting's closed
Lonnegan begins to shake him violently
You give me my money back
There's been a mistake, do you hear me
Gondorff leaps to Niles' aid when suddenly there is a crash at the entrance door, and Polk, Snyder and eight federal agents burst into the room, guns drawn
The place falls silent except for the loudspeaker, the members of the boost afraid to move
Gondorff and Niles look at each other wondering how this could have possibly happened
(motioning to Hooker) All right, Hooker, you can go
Hooker's eyes go to Gondorff, who looks back at him in utter disbelief, the betrayal raging in his features
Hooker, unable to meet his gaze, lowers his head and starts to walk out
Almost unnoticed, there's a flash of movement at Gondorff's belt
small gun
shot
Hooker clutches his back and falls dead on the floor, the blood spurting from his mouth
Polk, reacting instantly, pours four shots into Gondorff, who goes down in a heap
Pandemonium breaks loose
The members of the boost race for the door
Lonnegan is totally stunned
First he lost his money and now he's involved in a murder
Snyder rushes over to him
'mon
We gotta get you outa here
Snyder drags him through the crowd and out onto the street where an
car is waiting
His bodyguards have long since fled at the sight of the
men
My money's back there
We'll worry about that later
Snyder gets in beside Lonnegan, and the car speeds away
: The pandemonium has now ceased
Those who could escape have; the rest are lined up against the wall in frisking position
Gondorff and Hooker lie on the floor dead
The loudspeaker drones on
Singleton is still calling the race from his booth, apparently oblivious to what's happened
And the winner is King's Image by four lengths, Syphon is second, by two, Moneyman third by two and one half
Time for 1 and 1/16 miles, 1:21 and 2/10 seconds
Polk walks slowly over to Hooker's body and bends down
He's gone
Hooker opens his eyes and slowly drags himself up off the floor, spitting out a little rubber bladder, filled with blood, that he's had in his mouth
Gondorff does likewise
Niles, Twist, Singleton and the rest of the boost begin to laugh and shake hands, as do the Federal Agents
(to Polk) Nice con, Hickey
thought you were Feds myself, when you first came in
No problem, Henry
Snyder went for it all the way
(laughing) You shoulda seen the rag he lit under Lonnegan
Gondorff turns to the others
Okay, let's take this place apart and get outa here
You can get your splits from Eddie at Boudreau's tonight
Gondorff walks over to Hooker, who's wiping the blood off his face and hands
You beat him, kid
(softly) You were right, Henry
It's not enough
But it's close
You wanta wait for your share
Naw, 'd just blow it
Gondorff nods, and walks slowly to behind the bar
He comes out with his suitcase in one hand and Hooker's paper bag in another
He throws the paper bag to Hooker, who stops by the door
Eirie Kid is standing there
Hooker gives the "office" to Eirie, who beams and gives it back
Then Hooker and Gondorff leave
We hold on them, two ragtail grifters again as they walk off down the street and disappear around the corner
