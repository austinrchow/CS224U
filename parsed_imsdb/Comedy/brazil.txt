Brazil - the screenplay Brazil Screenplay (Draft) 1
1 beautiful golden sun is setting
The sky is on fire
The starts to move downwards
large neon sign rises into shot
It rests on top of a skyscraper and fills the frame
The building is neither past nor future in design but a bit of both
Slowly we pan downwards revealing the city that spreads below
glittering conglomeration of elevated transport tubes, smaller square buildings which are merely huge, with, here and there, the comparatively minuscule relics of previous ages of architecture, pavement level awnings suggesting restaurants and shops
Transparent tubes carry whizzing transport cages past us
an elevated highway carrying traffic composed primarily of large transport lorries passes thru frame
As we descend, the sunlight is blocked out and street lights & neon signs take over as illumination
Eventually we reach the upper levels of a plush shopping precinct

2 Xmas decorations are everywhere
are busy buying, ogling, discussing, choosing wisely from the goodies on display
are going by laden with superbly packaged goods
the shop windows are full of elaborately boxed and be-ribboned who-knows-what
In one window is a bank of  sets - on the great majority of the screens is the face of
- the Deputy Minister of Information
He is being interviewed
No-one bothers to listen to
Deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings
Bad sportsmanship
ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues
They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win
If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling - In fact, killing people - - In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life
We   from the shop to concentrate on the shoppers
's voice carries over the rest of the scene
Mr
, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy
David
in a free society information is the name of the game
You can't win the game if you're a man short
Fur bedecked shoppers pass in front of what appears to be banks of snow but as we pan along with them the "snow" turns out to be fire-fighting foam
It oozes out of a shop front that is a charred twisted mass of metal frames
are busily sealing the opening with plywood sheets,  pay no attention to this
Xmas carols are being played by a Salvation Army style band calling themselves Consumers For Christ
Santa Claus's grotto is busy, all is well with the world
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister
Seven percent of the gross national produce
understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers
People want value for money and a cost-effective service

3 screen with  still talking
That is why we always insist on the principle of Information Retrieval Charges
These terrorists are not pulling their weight, and it's absolutely right and fair that those found guilty should pay for their periods of detention and the Information Retrieval Procedures used in their interrogation
to reveal a rather clinical office
The  rests on a desk
is sorting out his in- tray
Several Christmas cards are amongst he paperwork
He comes upon a Christmassy package which he rips open, to discover a shiny, metal "executive toy"

The  is disturbed by the buzz of the  as it whirrs around the fluorescent light
He rolls up some paper and forms and gets up to swat the insect

13 The  gets up and balances a chair on top of his desk
He climbs up onto it attempting to swat the still buzzing about the room just out of reach
Beneath him an automatic type-writing machine rattles away compiling a typed list of names under the heading "Information Retrieval, Subjects For Detention & Interview"
The machine is being fed from a spool of paper which is being rhythmically chopped by an automatic guillotine which neatly leaves each name on a separate sheet, with the title above each name, each sheet following its predecessor into a holding basket
In - we see the names on the sheets of paper building up in the holding basket: , Simon
, Martin
, Benjamin
, William
, John
Every name begins with
Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists
On yes
Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six
'd say they're nearly out of the game
The  is tottering on one leg on the chair on the desk as he strains to swat the
Swish, swash, oops, Gottcha
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year
Beginner's luck
The 's career comes to a halt
squashed flat on the brilliantly clean ceiling
or has it
As the clambers down from the rickety heights, the 's carcass comes unstuck from the ceiling and drops silently into the typewriting machine which hiccoughs, hesitates and then types the letter "" and hesitates and then continues so that the next name is , Archibald
The  fails to notice this and the machine continues smoothly , Thomas
, Peter
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister
Thank you, David
and a very merry Christmas to you all

14 past foreground outdoor Xmas decorations we in on one of several massive residential tower blocks that loom over what appears to be a poorer part of the city 15
15 and  are on the , the end credits rolling over them to the beat of a Mozart theme tune
we reveal that the  is in a conventional sitting room, conventionally decorated for Christmas; out the room is oddly encumbered by huge metal conduits that snake unpleasantly across and through the walls
Smaller conduits radiate from the main one connecting the various services that Central Services (the name emblazoned on the metal) supply to this household
conventionally poor but proud family occupies the room
is reading Dickens' Christmas Carol to   who is about six
plays quietly with a toy machine gun and some action men dressed in security gear
is putting the final touches to a neatly wrapped Christmas present which looks identical to the "executive toy" we have just seen in he ' office
Faintly from outside comes a burst of laughter
tilt of the  indicates that the laughter is coming from the floor above
16
'                                   16 The flat is very bare and basic
The laughter is coming from a cheap portable television showing "Sgt
Bilko
From '  we look through an open door of a bathroom straight at a mirror propped up by the bath, to enable the person in the bath to watch the
The person in the bath is  , washing the grime off herself while she watches Bilko in the mirror
From her  in the mirror, the
screen is suddenly obscured by part of the body of a  in uniform
(scared) Who's there

'                                 17 The   as before

There, that's enough for tonight
He won't come Xmas Eve if you don't get plenty of sleep
Father Christmas can't come if we haven't got a chimney
You'll see
The  exchanges goodnight kisses with her parents and leaves the room
How will he get down from upstairs
It's a secret
We follow   out of the sitting room into

There is little or no light there, and she sees a bulky figure apparently lowering himself into the room from the direction of the ceiling
(unalarmed) You've come
As she moves, the light from the hallway shows us the figure of what looks like a commando on a night raid, slowly sliding down a pole in he middle of the room
The pole at the top end disappears through a hole in the ceiling
Things become immediately clearer 19
-                          19 Crash
It's a raid
Battle-dressed   smash trough the door
Another , swings from a rope, kicks in the window from the outside and enters that way
Most alarmingly of all, a shower of plaster comes down from the ceiling in which a fairly neat round hole appears and through the hole comes a fireman's pole down which slide The whole thing is short, brutal and violent
is grabbed violently and stuffed into a baglike canvas device that covers him from head to waist
metal clamp goes round his neck, a metal bar slides up the back of the bag
His hands are handcuffed to the metal bar
In seconds he has become a canvas parcel
Meanwhile, has been carried out of her bedroom and dumped into the lap of her screaming mother
has his toy machine gun knocked out of his hands by a  who we see is identical in dress to the action men   has been playing with
He rushes to his mother as guns are viciously trained on them
are kicking open the doors of other rooms and generally doing a good job
An , wearing plain clothes, now enters from the front door and during the turmoil is reading aloud from an official document
It goes something like this: hereby inform you under powers entrusted to me under Section 47, Paragraph 7 of Council Order Number 438476, that Mr Buttle, Archibald, residing at 412 North Tower, Shangri La Towers, has been invited to assist the Ministry of Information with certain enquiries, the nature of which may be ascertained on completion of application form //486/ fourteen days within this date, and that he is liable to certain obligations as specified in Council Order 173497, including financial restitutions which may or may not be incurred if Information Retrieval procedures beyond those incorporated in Article 7 subsections 8, 10 & 32 are required to elicit information leading to permanent arrest - notification of which will he served with the time period of 5 working days as stipulated by law
In that instance the detainee will be debited without further notice through central banking procedures without prejudice until and unless at such a time when re-imbursement procedures may be instituted by you or third parties on completion of a re-imbursement form //907/
and more of the same, most of which is part of the audible wall paper while the chaos reigns
As the front door slams behind the captive relative peace returns, broken by  's anguished sobbing
(proffering a pen and a thick book of pink receipts to Mrs Buttle) Sign here please
(dazed
She signs weakly) What
where have you taken him
(taking the book) thank you
(he hands her another book, this one of blue receipts) (indicating place to sign) Same again please
Just there
(checking first book of receipts) Press harder his time
Good
(signing again) What is this all about
(tearing out sheet from pink book) That's your receipt for your husband
(taking blue book from her) Thank you
And this is my receipt for your receipt
(he turns to leave along with troopers) 's shocked face appears looking down through the hole in the ceiling
The faces of the workmen  and also appear, above and behind her
Mrs Buttle, are you alright
The helmeted   in Buttle's flat drop to defensive positions and swing their machine guns up towards the hole in the ceiling
All three faces retreat
20
'                                   20 (starting back from the hole with Bill and Jill) Eh
Eh
Eh
We're Department of Works
Department of Works up here
Careful with those bloody things
,  and  are hustled aside by a who clears the fireman's pole from the hole
We can see the  in the room below leaving man has untied a rope hanging out of the open window
He coils the rope up neatly and the    leave the flat
(to Jill as they watch this highly efficient operation) Don't take any notice, love, it's their training makes them like animals
Best in the world, though
Who are you
Don't you worry love, we'll have everything shipshape in a jiffy
That's it
Nothing to worry about
It's Buttle downstairs who can worry, eh
There must be some mistake
Mr Buttle's harmless
We don't make mistakes
So saying, he drops the manhole cover, which is faced with same material as the floor, over the hole in the floor
To his surprise it drops neatly through the floor into the flat below
Bloody typical, they've gone back to metric without telling us 20a
'                                20a stands stunned in the middle of her decimated flat
The  wail
Slowly   collapses - slumping to the floor with the receipt in her hand: we tighten into   of "Receipt"

'                                21 We come in on a   of a pink version of the being stamped and impaled on desk spike as we   to reveal an infinite expanse of regularly arranged metal desks, each desk with a built-in
console, and each (except one) occupied by a
Every desk is snowed under with pieces of paper much like the receipts seen in the previous scene
More pacers are delivered to each desk intermittently by way of pneumatic tube bustle about with even more paperwork
From the back of the room we get a view of the screens which show graphs, tabulations, figures
All of this activity is supervised from an elevated walkway by
Satisfied that all is well with his clerks he turns and walks towards his glass enclosed private office at the top of the room, his name lettered on the opaque glass door
goes through this door and as he closes it behind him, all activity in the  pool ceases
each adjusts his
screen with the flick of a switch, and all the screens change to something which looks very like "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"
22
'                            22 also has a
console
He sits behind his desk, reaches for his In-tray, and without looking at the console he turns his screen on
He looks through a number of files in his In-tray
He is surprised to hear a say, "Turn around real slow, amigo"
turns around real slow, his expression relaxes, he thumps his console with a large fist, and the screen obediently flicks to a display of figures
He picks up a file which we see as marked "Buttle, Archibald"
He opens the file and starts punching the keyboard of the console
The
starts bleeping in an alarmed way
is puzzled
He punches more figures
The screen starts to flash "Error, error, error"
sighs with frustration
He presses an intercom
(into intercom) Mr Lowry, will you step in here please
He returns his attention, puzzled to the file
Nobody comes into the office
gets up and walks over to his door and opens it
Beyond the door the room full of is obediently concentrating on the bleeping and whirring consoles
From  '  we see that in the centre of the room is an unoccupied desk
Does anyone know where Lowry is
Nobody knows
closes his door again
moment later it seems to him, and to us, that he has heard the crash of six guns blazing away at each other
He re-opens the door
The only sound again
He goes back to his desk
He punches a few keys
The machine starts emitting even more alarming beeps, then horse whinnies, then "Admit you're whupped, you drygulching scum"
explodes with anger, and presses the intercom again
(Shouting into intercom) Where the hell is Sam Lowry

23 brilliantly clear sky
From on high an odd bird- like figure swoops down on the
As it comes closer we can see that it is, in fact, a  wearing strange wood and metal bird wings
In the bright sunshine their flapping movements create a brilliant, flashing effect
Along with the wings,   (for this is he) wears an outfit that combines the best of Flash Gordon and a fighter pilot
He sweeps past the  and then, banking, rises
An ethereal voice can be heard calling "Sam
Sam
Sam"
He hovers, looking beyond the  to something wonderful face of stunningly beautiful , she is the idealised twin of
Her long hair swirls across her face partially obscuring it and making her appear slightly mysterious
The    from her as soft billowing material sinuously undulates about her
It rises and falls like waves carried on the wind
As the through this sea of gossamer we can see that the  is being held aloft by and in it
vast landscape stretches below her
The sun frames her in the sky
She and  are engaged in a beautiful sensual aerial ballet
Romantic music fills the soundtrack
swoops up and away
The  floats in the distance as rises in the foreground
She beckons to him begins to flap back towards her
But then the dreamy quality of this scene is interrupted by threatening rumble
looks down
The ground far below him suddenly erupts as a massive, monolithic stone skyscraper bursts through the surface and soars upwards with a mighty rush
to the  in
The monolith rises up into partially cutting her off from view
Before  can do anything, another stone skyscraper breaks through the ground and rushes upwards
Then another and another
There is nothing  can do
The  is being cut of from him by these gigantic faceless structures
And then she is finally lost from view somewhere in the depths of this strange stone metropolis
lies closer
The stone skyscrapers appear to be solid
No windows
No doors
Nothing whatsoever to interfere with their clean, harsh, rectilinear design
As he flies among these towering blocks he sees no sign of the , only sheer walls rising high above him
Below him the walls plummet vertiginously into the darkish streets
No sound but the creaking flapping of his wings can he heard in this dead place
Coming round a corner he sees something in the distance
far below him a dark procession is wending its way through the narrow passages
away from him
of the procession making its way past the
Black-robed and cowled, the sinister figures look like heavily armed monks
These are the Together they are straining at several heavy hawsers that rise in long arcs up to a huge metal cage floating above and behind the procession
Binding the cage are metal straps to which ropes are attached
Inside is the  - still enveloped in gossamer which billows as if there were a breeze in constant attendance

There at the end of the passage between two stone skyscrapers stands
barring the way
to swords being unsheathed
Cowls being thrown back
Underneath are rotting, broken dolls' faces
All the faces are the same except for the manner in which they have decayed
They smile - slobbering, sickeningly
Suddenly the robed bodies change shape - some rising up to become long, others expanding sideways to become bulbous, others shrinking
From the folds of cloth come evil weapons

Nothing can stop this boy
The pile of black-robed bodies grows with each swing of 's sword

And then, suddenly, they are all dead, but a heap of blackness to commemorate 's prowess
The  is beaming as  makes his way toward the hawsers holding the cage
But then a noise behind him makes him turn
There, behind him the pile of black shapes begin to rise
The ropes become a mass of flapping black cloth
This evil churning cloud coalesces and lifts off the ground
The horrible flapping apparition emits a terrifying maniacal laughter as it flies away is about to rush after it to halt its escape but is stopped by the sound of a telephone ringing
He looks around - confused

Oh
Mr Kurtzman
You're up late
Oh, is it
There is an electronic box of tricks by his bed, incorporating an alarm

The alarm goes off
This sets of a series of other things
The window shutters roll up letting in the morning light
Both taps turn on in the bathroom

Yours too, sir
Don't worry sir - 'll be there

Noticing one of his film posters is loose he pushes the pin in firmly
In the kitchen a coffee maker starts up
In the sitting room the television switches on
Back in the bedroom a cupboard door springs open and a rack slides out with 's clothes neatly hanging - ready to be put on comes out of the bathroom, having turned off the bath taps, and starts to get dressed
In the kitchen the coffee- maker has finished making s small pot of coffee
pours a quick cup and is gone at the door
Throughout all this we have had a chance to get a glimpse of 's flat
It is functional, soulless and, though neat, has not been assembled with a loving hand
Most of the furnishings are built in

Certain of the wall panels have Central Services logos on them with the admonition "Do not obstruct or remove" below

The lobby is a vast impressive space containing reception desks, fountains, statues etc
Prominent are the security measures, which include automatic mobile cameras, video screens and groups of   who search all who enter

Long time no see
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem
Problem
- No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, 'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better,  feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded - You sound worried

Over this has been talking
What's the matter
Sorry
Nothing
(snapping out of it) See you - 'm going to be late
(looking at his watch) You are late
Even later
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed - Yes,  know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins

As  heads off to the lift, he passes a group of standing around a temporary  monitor
Several of them are dressed in white lab coats
They are being explained the benefits of a new surveillance system by a salesman type
His assistant is operating the controls
On the monitor we can see  standing in the queue for the Information desk
The  appears to he tracking in on her
at top of queue with several forms in her hand
strange prototype radio controlled camera on a wheeled base is whirring and clicking as it approaches her
Throughout the next sequence it pokes around  in an annoying manner - thrusting itself at her face, trying to see what is written on the forms, peering over her shoulder

The radio-controlled camera noses right up to 's face as she turns
She swats the annoying thing with her stack of forms as she storms off
The camera overbalances and crashes into the desk - sparking and spluttering

Oh, good
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer is still punching keys

When  say several inches that's just what  mean
Not only are her jowls being stretched like silly putty but they are also being wrapped around to the back of her neck to demonstrate how tight and smooth her face can be made by  who is prattling on over this freak show
Now, when you come in tomorrow, Mrs Lowry, we'll make a little tuck here and there

You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me

He was very close to me
Still is
He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval
You'll like it when you get there
You're not listening, mother
warning buzzer goes off as 's handbag goes thru security check

It's a present for my son
She takes the toy back and hands it to
hope you like it
It's very exclusive
What is it
It's something for executives
At this point the   arrives on the scene
Madam Lowry, how exquisite to see you again

The waltzing strains of the string quartet accompanying them
to group of tables with diners
At one of them sits a wealthy-looking   with a rather plain-looking in her 20s

most perceptive choice, Madam, if may say so
(to Sam) Monsieur
(brusquely) steak, please
Rare
(to his mother) Mother,  need to
(piqued) Monsieur
Quel numero
(handing back menu) don't know which numero
(writing on pad) Numero, trois
is a bit embarrassed here
gives  a withering look
stalks away
(trying to restart things) Alma, you wicked thing
(indicating bandages) you've started your treatment
You noticed
(enthusiastically) must tell you all about it
(to his mother) Mother, will you listen to At this moment the food arrives
elaborately lifts off the silver covers and with a flourish distributes the plates of food
Each order looks identical - a big splodge of brown lumpy stuff
The only differences between the lumps are the Identifying photographs on sticks stuck in each
The beautiful colour photos match the photos which were on the menus
(showing off that he remembers who's ordered what) Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce
(he sets it in front of Sam's Mother) It's too exciting
've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr
Chapman
Numero deux, duck a l'orange
(he sets it in front of Mrs Terrain) The acid man
Really, Ida, just because his techniques are revolutionary don't go around calling Dr Jaffe the knife man
Numero une, crevettes a la mayonaaise
(he sets it in front of Shirley) 'm sorry Alma,  didn't mean to sound so
That's all right Ida
it's just that he's such an artist
To him, cutting is so crude
so primitive
Numero trois, steak
(He sets this in front of Sam) Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit
Merci
Acid on the other hand, can be used for such wonderfully subtle shading, such delicate nuances - just like a Rembrant etching
and it's so much quicker
Why, if it weren't for a teensy-weensy complication - the doctor said it could have happened to anyone -  would have had these bandages off yesterday
(to Sam, after attracting her mother's attention and receiving a nod) Salt
They are just about to dip into their respective splodges when there is a terrific explosion - a huge hole is blasted out of the wall to the kitchen
Chaos erupts around the carnage as  try putting out the flames with extinguishers
, bloody and dying, are moaning
The  not actually affected by the blast look up for a moment and then, with a few raised eyebrows, go back to their meals
What were we saying
(picking bomb debris out of his brown lump) This isn't rare
By the way,  saw a wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemists
Gift tokens
Medical gift tokens
Oh, that sounds marvellous
Yes, they're good at any doctor's and at many of the major hospitals - and they're accepted for gynecological complications including Caesarian section
, in the act of taking in another forkful of his unappetising meal, drops his form in disgust Look - please - 'm sorry - but honestly, mother, this is - quite agree
- It's impossible
raises her arm to gain the attention of the who is frantically trying to deal with the emergency
The activity in the background has increased throughout the conversation
The fire-brigade has arrived with sirens blaring
Ministry  have charged in and are arresting Stretchers have been bought in for the injured and these are being rushed past our little 's table
The   comes to the table, his  now blood- spattered
am sorry, Madam
don't know what to say
this very rarely happens to us - 'll do what  can straight away He hurries away
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists
What
Now
It's my lunch hour
Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things  was dying to tell you Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval
(angry and surprised) Mother
Oh that's wonderful
Congratulations Sam
You can show those fucking murderous bastards a thing or two
(shocked and embarrassed) Shirley
Stop this
(leaping to his feet) 'm not being promoted
'm not going to Information Retrieval
(he scrumples promotion notification which he has been holding and throws it on the floor) If  want you to stick your oar in, mother, 'll tell you where to stick it
is shocked
He recovers his composure slightly
Embarrassed, he bends, and picks up the ball of paper which he starts smoothing back into Its flat state
(back to her uncertain form) Pepper
Look - 've got to get back - As  goes,   reappears with a group of  - those remaining unarrested - whom he has organised to gut up a folding screen around the table
This cuts of the sight if not the noise of the  of the explosion
Sam
you haven't had dessert
'm sorry
don' t want dessert don't want promotion
don't want anything
Don't be childish, Samuel
Of course you want something
You must have hopes, wishes, dreams
Their voices have been rising towards a shout in order to rise above the volume of the growing chaos around them
(shouts loud) ,
29
29 as his dream-self rises  , his wings straining as he tows the floating cage imprisoning the
They are rising up and away from the monolithic stone skyscrapers that stretch away below them
'm taking you to a safe place place where they will never be able to get at us
ever
An eyeball is scanning the sky
we see it is but one of thousands, tightly packed side by side forming a landscape that extends as far as we can see
As  and the  in her cage come into view it becomes apparent just how big these eyeballs are - they are gigantic - about 10 feet in diameter
All of them follow  as he comes to rest on a platform high atop a column that rises from the centre of this bizarre place
There's no way they can approach us without being seen
You're safe here
He anchors the hawser holding the cage and takes off his wings
Just as he starts climbing up to the cage a terrific cracking noise is heard
freezes
dead straight crack is bisecting the sky from somewhere beyond the horizon - running right up the sky and over the camera
follows it as it continues over the  and down to the opposite horizon
Another crackling noise is heard
Another crack appears
Then another
And another
All these cracks are emanating from a vanishing point over the horizon
Soon the sky is covered with these cracks from horizon to foreground
Then cracks begin appearing at right angles to them
Very quickly the sky is covered with a mammoth grid
Once it is complete, another noise is heard
Something like massive blocks of stone sliding against one another
One of the squares formed by the grid pattern begins to slide upwards as if being pulled out from the back side of the sky
square hole is left in its place
We can see the sides of the hole as it extends upwards into blackness
As soon as this first block of sky is withdrawn, another begins to slide up and away
is frozen in position as this terrifying spectacle goes on above him
The eyeballs are madly looking this way and that
The grinding noises are deafening as block after block of sky is removed
With each successive loss the light decreases
The  is crying out for  to save her
Frantically  tries to haul the cage down to the platform but it's too late
Where the sky was is now pitch black
Only one block of sky remains
Slowly that final bit of sky is pulled up and out of shot
Total blackness
maniacal laughter can be heard
beam of light is switched on
has a searchlight in his hand and is searching the darkness
The laughter continues
Suddenly the beam catches something black and moving
it's the same black, flapping cloth that appeared at the end of the previous dream
The horrible flapping thing comes thundering down on
He is engulfed in the black awfulness
30
'                                   30 is in bed, grappling with the bedclothes
He is dripping with sweat and screaming
The room is oppressively hot
He gets up and looks at the thermostat
It reads 99
He fumbles with it, but to no avail
It's stuck
to  coming into the sitting room
He rushes over to the window and tries to open it
But it wasn't designed to be opened
Screws hold it firmly shut
heads to the kitchen He finds a knife which he uses to unscrew the window
He swings the window open and takes a deep breath
terrible greeny-brown smog pours in through the window
Desperately  shuts the window and madly tightens up the screws
Swinging a newspaper, he tries clearing a path through the clouded atmosphere
He makes it to the front door and staggers out into the hall gasping for air
to telephone being lifted from its cradle
Pull back as  with opened telephone directory in front of him dials
He is seated in his kitchen
In front of his open refrigerator
The phone rings at the other end
(into phone) Hello - Central Services - 'm at 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover - and 've got trouble with the air- conditioning Thank you or calling Central Services
am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident- This is an emergency
Thank you for calling Central Services
am sorry, due - Yes, but
've got to have a heating engineer Thank you for calling Cen - slams the phone down
to  sitting in front of the refrigerator
The door is open and he has wedged a chair into the gap in a desperate bid to keep cool
He is nodding off
As his head slumps against one of the shelves, a jar of pickled onions falls to the floor
The onions scattering everywhere
31
31 The milky white spheres tumble everywhere
But they are not onions, they are the giant eyeballs burtling through space
is clinging desperately to one
He grabs the pupil for a better handhold and it opens like a hatch cover
manages to pull himself inside
Once out of the intergalactic maelstrom,  turns to survey the cramped and dark space inside the eyeball
It seems to be bisected by a dividing wall, from which a thin sliver of light is escaping
Pushing on the wall in the area of the slit, is able to move a section
More light shaftes into the tiny space from around the edges of what appears to be a small hatch
scrunches down and really puts his shoulder to the hatch
with a metallic rasp it gives way and  crashes through
to other side of opening as  topples through
He catches himself in the nick of time as the camera zooms back revealing his close call with disaster
He is high on a vast wall of what looks like filing cabinets
The hatch he came through was the front of one of the millions of files-drawers composing this wall
As he scrambles back into the opening we can see that the wall drops away for hundreds of feet, disappear into a steaming mist
Other walls of files enclose this vast space
From where  is it looks like the view from the 50th storey of the Time Life building in
These millions of files are being tended by  arising themselves up and down, as well as sideways, on modern skyscraper window-cleaners' platforms
The attendants are seen putting  in different period costumes into drawers
's attention is distracted by a sound overhead
Looking up he sees a window washer platform being lowered in his direction
Leaning over the side is a  , who happens to look like (as seen on )
Ah ha
there you are, Sam
What
How do you know my name
We know everything here
This is the Storeroom of Knowledge
(climbing onto the platform) Then perhaps you can help me
've lost someone who
(interrupting) We know that too
You've come to the right place
The platform carries them along the files
Oh, yes
We've got everything here
Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning
every experience, every thought neatly filed away
(incredulous) What
You mean you've got
Well not exactly
But, if you help us we'll help you
The Forces Of Darkness have won the day
but, tomorrow is another one What do  have to do
You must save the day
The platform has stopped
The  pulls out a drawer
He reaches inside
The  pulls out a wonderful sword and helmet
This is the Sword Of Truth
and this the Helmet Of Justice
As  begins to strap on the weapon the  brings out a cape
And this
completes the outfit
He puts the cape around 's shoulders and helps him step into the drawer
moment's hesitation and then  outs the helmet on and lies down in the drawer
It fits just like a coffin
As he lies back the  pushes the drawer in
It won't be pleasant but, trust me
As the drawer is pushed in  suffers a sudden bout of claustrophobia
Looking up at the diministing opening he is surprised to see - not the face of the   - but a terrifying  's masked helmet struggles to prevent the drawer being closed
32
'                                    32 is grabbing the walls of the fridge
Water from the defrosted freezer compartment drips on his head
He wakes up
Before he can really take in where he is the phone rings
He staggers over to it
Hello
hello
Hello
Mr Lowry
Who's that
(pause) sound at the kitchen door turns 's head - and ours - just in time to half see a quick blurred movement, but then a rapid voice in his ear-piece brings his head back
Put the phone down and your hands up
(into the phone) What
Who is this
realises that the voice is also in the room behind him
He turns round and sees
is middle- aged, a short tough figure dressed in dark clothes suggesting a cross between a cat burglar and a night-raid commando
In one hand he holds a gun pointed at
The other hand is holding a telephone receiver which  is in the act of placing in the large capacious bag at his feet
puts down his phone, and his hands up
Nice and easy now
Keep your hands where  can see them
What is this
(indignantly) Who the hell are you
, keeping the gun on , goes to different doors, leaning backwards into bedroom, bathroom and closet
suddenly relaxes and pockets his gun
Harry Tuttle
Heating engineer
At your service
Tuttle
Are you from Central Services
Ha
But
called Central Services
They're a bit overworked these days
Luckily  intercepted your call
What
By now,  are pouring with sweat
heads across the room and swiftly begins to undo a wall panel
Wait a minute, what was that business with the gun
hands  the panel and plunges his arm into the space behind it
little precaution, sir
've had traps set for me before now
There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle
Are you saying this is illegal
By now  has managed to pull out some sections of flexible ducting from the welter of mechanical offal behind the removed panel
It is all very complicated and greasy and it looks as though there is a lot more where that came from
is amazingly neat and deft as he works
real pro
As he works he hums a wee tune
yes Well, yes
and no
Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff
Could you hold these
(he hands Sam a bunch of wires that he has detached) but, with all the new rules and regulations
unncgh, c'mon, c'mon they can't get decent staff any more
so
they tend to turn a blind eye
as long as 'm careful
(he hands Sam a torch) Mind you, if ever they could prove 'd been working on their equipment
well, that's a different matter
up a bit with the torch, sir
Sorry
wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services
Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm - The pace
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork
(indicating the torch) Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir
Hold it there
Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and  couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6
Bloody paperwork
(mildly) Well  suppose one has to expect a certain amount Why
came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone
Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form
'm the last of a breed
Ah ha
Found it
(he holds up a small charred gadget) There's your problem
Can you fix it
No
But  can bypass it with one of these He pulls another gadget from his bag
Fine
The door bell
grabs for his gun
Are you expecting anyone
No
Wait here
He goes out closing the immediate door and goes to the front door which he opens
He is confronted by two officious little men in boiler suits who are standing outside his door
Their names are  and is 's echo
Yes
Central Services
ervices
Uh - what
-
You telephone, sir
elephoned sir
Trouble with your air-conditioning
ditioning
(gulps) No, not at all
mean, it's all right
It's fixed
Fixed
Fixed
They don't like that
mean it fixed itself
Fixed itself
ixed itself
Machines don't fix themselves
fix themselves
He's tampered with it, Dowser
ampered
with it, Spoor
Look, 'm sorry about your wasted journey tries to close the door but  prevents this
(to Dowser) think we'd better have a look
have a look
No you can't
He is pushed aside
followed by , heads for the door behind which is
is paralysed
approaches the door as if it is dangerous
He turns the handle quietly and gives the door a little nudge
The door begins to swing slowly open
suddenly finds inspiration
Just a minute
and  turn round as the door continues to swing open
When the door is open, behind their backs  is seen holding his pistol in a two-handed grip, his knees slightly bent
freezes like that, pointing his pistol through the open door
Have you got a 27B/6
looks very angry
Veins stand out on his forehead and he goes into what looks like some sort of fit knocks him to the ground
(to Sam) Now look what you've done to him
Have you got one or haven't you
Not
as such
moans and begins to get back on his feet
But we can get one
(worried about Dowser) It's all right, Terry, it's all right, everything's all right
(ushering them to the door) 'm sorry, but 'm a bit of a stickler for paper work
Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures
We'll be back
Be back
(Closing the door on them) Thank you
turns back to  who is coming forward pocketing his gun
Thanks, Lowry, you're a good man in a tight corner
returns to work, fitting in the new by-pass gadget and tightening the nuts, and happily humming ""
Listen
um
don't want to get involved in any of this
But  work at the Ministry of Information, and happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer
You wouldn't by any chance be - (pleased) My friends call me Harry
Information Retrieval, eh
Interesting
What do they want you or
Time to go
finishes the job and throws his tools into the bag
Thank you very much
How much will it
On the house
You did me a favor
Check the corridor
goes to the front door, opens it and looks out
All clear
slips out and heads off down the balcony corridor
Hey that's a dead end
But  merely undoes a pre-arranged rope and swings Tarzan-like off the end of the balcony and across a multi- story void to a neighboring block
is amazed - not to say - stunned
33
33 is at his desk among all the desks
Documents are being delivered right, left and centre through the vacuum tubes
All the  are busy
The screens are devoted to their proper use
All this activity is explained by the fact the  's door is wide open
At the next desk is another  much like , his
think Kurtzman getting is suspicious
What have we got on today
Casablanca
appears in his doorway
(calls out) Mr Lowry
Would you step in here a moment please
We go with  as he closes the office door behind him, we are now in
34
'                               34 is pacing anxiously
walks into the office
During the brief opening and closing of the door we just manage to hear the piano player in "Casablanca" singing, "
a kiss is just a kiss
"
is too worried to notice
He is holding a piece of paper gingerly as if it were contagious
He waves it frantically as  enters
(hysterically) Thank God you're here
We're in terrible trouble
Look at this
Look at this
He thrusts the piece of paper at Sam
(taking the paper) cheque
The refund for Tuttle
(startled) Tuttle
mean, Buttle
It's been confusion from the word go
He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can
've never seen a Ministry cheque before
We've got to get rid of it
There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque
Send it to somebody else
Send it to Buttle
It's his cheque
've tried that
Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative
Security has him down as excised
, Admin have him down as completed Hang on
sits down at the console and punches keys
He does this very efficiently, muttering to himself and generally demonstrating an expertise which obviously leaves way out of his depth, until - He is dead
Dead
Oh no
That's terrible
We'll never get rid of the damned thing
What are we going to do
Try next of kin
(a revelation) Next of kin
punches more keys
There we go
Mrs
Veronica Buttle
What's the number on the cheque
(reading it) 27156789/074328/
has been efficiently punching this in
Into memory
Now
Central Banking Buttle, Veronica
Deposit rips off a print out, rapidly stuffs it and the cheque into a cannister and then into a vacuum tube
job well done
(fervently) Please don't come back
Please don't come back
Unfortunately 's prayers are not answered and the
vacuum tube returns almost immediately
opens it up
From the computer screen comes a voice "Play it again, Sam" -  and  look at the screen
We get a quick glimpse of Humphrey Bogart before the screen reverts to numbers
Problem
She doesn't have a bank account
(hysterically) Well, that's it
may as well go and hang myself
This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization
That was Simmons doing
And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch
The bastards
(he thumps his hand hard on the desk top) Ow
(He picks up the offending cheque) Perhaps we can lose it
behind the filing cabinet
or destroy it
burn it
eat it
Under this tirade  has begun to hum "" - not entirely sure what inspired him
You'd never get away with it
Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund
It's Christmas
There is one more option
(depressed
Not really believing it) What
Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop
is dumbfounded by the audacity of this
That's brilliant
takes over
In no time at all he has battered away at the keyboard, slammed a cannister into a vacuum tube and received almost immediately a cannister containing a sheaf of different coloured papers
'll do it for you
Authorise the cheque
What's the address
scribbles it down for him
Here
What do  do next
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport
Of course, of course
Leave it to me
How do  authorize a cheque
(separating the and blue sheets) Here we are
Pink and blue receipts
All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque
takes out his pen and tries to sign the papers but his hand is giving him trouble
(exhausted after all the emotion) Oh God
think 've broken a bone
What a pathetic thing  am
(taking the pen from him) Here
signs the cheque and receipts
big   shows that he is scribbling 's signature
pockets the papers and the pen
That's it
You are good to me Sam
(leaving) Don't mention it
See you later
35
35 to  at the wheel of the little car, beetling along in a seemingly endless, tube-like tunnel, menaced fore and aft by huge buses, lorries and other carriers which literally lift the little three-wheeler from the road surface and shake it by the scruff of its tiny neck
to  in interior of the Messerschmidt
He is singing along to an obscure arrangement of ""
(plays music for a moment which then fades out) We interrupt this programme to bring you news of a terrorist bombing at the

36 to exterior view of Messerschmidt still merrily progressing in arterial tunnel
to very tiny exit sign: Exit 49
to  peering at sign
to Messerschmidt taking the exit just as a huge lorry roars by
37
37 Beautiful utopian block of high-rise flats gleam in the sunlight
Pulling back we reveal it to be an architect's model in a protective perspex case standing in the centre of a decorative fountain that has long ceased to work - graffiti and junk are now the only decorations
In the background is the grim reality of the massive housing tower
's Messerschmidt is just puling up in the shadow of the building which is grey, decrepid, vandalised
Huge conduits, pipes, and tubing frame the scene
gets out of the car under the cool and none-too-friendly gaze of a few
Self-consciously,  looks around him, then at the paper in his hand
little group of  sit pitching pennies against a wall
goes over to them
(super polite) Excuse me
Can you tell me
But before he can finish, the smallest, tiny  looks up
Eff off
, uncomfortably, effs off
He is watched, at some distance, imapassively by the little
As  enters the buildings one of the kids gets out a can of something and approaches the car
Another is fiddling, with a box of matches
38
38 to  hesitantly walking into the semi-derelict lobby of the big block of flats
Graffiti, vandalism are in evidence everywhere
He walks up to the lift
Pushes the button
Nothing happens
He pushes again
This time the lift door shudders and sparks
tries to pull the doors apart
They jam open with a three-inch gap between them - still shuddering and grinding
In the sparking light, can make out an interior crammed with garbage, junk, old furniture, dead cats
Yechhhh
Resignedly, he turns towards the stairs
39
39 to  coming breathlessly out of the stairwell
On the wall next to it is the number 37
Walking down the corridor he looks at the number and starts to knock, but then notices that the door is cracked open
tries to knock on the door, but it keeps edging open and he settles for knocking on the door frame a bit feebly
Mrs Buttle (silence) Uh, Mrs Buttle
(silence) stands not knowing what to do
pushes the door a bit more open gingerly and puts about 65 per cent of his body into the hall of the flat
to 's  of darkish hall
Mrs Buttle
40
40 to  entering extremely tacky sitting-room shrouded in half-darkness
This is the same flat from which the was taken at the beginning of the film: the hole is still in the ceiling
becomes aware of a woman sitting absolutely still at a small table by the only (still broken) window in the room
Are you Mrs Buttle
The  nods very slightly without looking at him
My name is Lowry - Sam Lowry
'm from the Ministry of Information
(no response) 've come to give you a cheque
takes the cheque out of his pocket and puts it on the table to tempt   into a flicker of interest but she fails to notice it - or him for that matter pushes the cheque a little way towards   but she does not respond
(indicting cheque) It's a refund
'm afraid there was a mistake
Mistake
(encouraged) Yes
Not my department
'm only records
It seems that Mr Buttle was overcharged by Information Retrieval
don't think they usually make mistakes
but, er
suppose we're all human
looks around and sees the hole in the ceiling
Oh
what happened to the
He gets nothing back
Actually, my bringing this here is rather unorthodox
Usually any payments are made through the central computer
but, er
there were certain difficulties, and rather than cause delay, we thought you might appreciate this now
it being Christmas
My husband's dead, isn't he
Er
assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error
If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, 'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms
What have you done with his body
Um
starts to cry
Look, 'm very sorry, but 'm afraid don't know anything about it
'm really just delivering the cheque
Er
If you wouldn't mind signing these receipts (producing blue and pink receipts) 'll go and leave you in peace
picks up the cheque and gives it to together with the receipts
tears them up and throws them in his face
Uh
He hadn't done anything
He was good
What have you done with his body
looks around for an escape and sees a standing in the doorway
The  is looking at him with a blank tearful face
Suddenly the  launches himself at with terrible ferocity
is knocked against the wall
mirror falls off the wall and smashes on the floor
The  is all over  kicking and pulling his hair
's reaction, however, is to try and pull the  away from
By the time she succeeds,  is on his hands and knees, in pain
The  is crying and shouting, and   is loudly trying to quieten the From ' , a piece of broken mirror lying on the floor reflects the hole in the ceiling
with 's head and shoulders framed in the hole
The moment is unreal for  in his dazed condition
The vision seems unreal too
is staring at  out of the piece of mirror and
she's very much the  from his dream now
Are you alright
(mumbles) It's you
it's you
Mrs Buttle, are you alright
grabs at the image, i
e
at the mirror, shifting the angle so that the vision disappears
He looks for the vision on the floor but can't find it
Then he begins to realise the reality of what he has seen
He stands up, dazed and battered
has been looking up at the ceiling
looks up at the ceiling but there is now only the empty space of the hole
Wait
Stop
Come back
is shouting
rushes out of the flat
41
'                               41 looks both ways and heads for the stairs
42
'                              42 runs up the stairs to the floor above and finds himself in - 43
43 He runs along the corridor but has omitted to count the doors downstairs and now doesn't know which door to knock at
He hesitates
He rings the bell on what he hopes is the right door
The bell doesn't work
He bangs on the door
The door opens a crack
malevolent eye looks at him
Girl
fair hair
The door shuts firmly
rushes to the next door
44
'                                     44 bursts into 's flat
He sees the hole in the floor
The place looks derelict
He hears an explosion and looks out of a window to see his car in flames
is apparently retreating from it across the forecourt

The Messerchmidt, however, is in flames
doesn't know which way to turn
Spotting an old mattress lying by the building he grabs it and throws it over the car in an attempt to smother the flames
The group of  watch him silently
Suddenly with a great roar, 's lorry comes round the corner at speed
sees that  is at the wheel
runs after the lorry
(shouting) Wait
It was nothing to do with me
The lorry roars away
dashes back to his smoldering three-wheeler
He flings himself into it and starts it up
He also roars away, except that he doesn't move
all three wheels have been removed
He turns round in despair and sees the group of  regarding him expressionlessly
They include the little
Defeated, he slumps down against his charred vehicle shadow passes across his face
Looking up he sees standing over him
Go away
Her name is Jill

Jill Layton
(getting up) You're a very good little girl
What are you doing here
'm waiting for my daddy
(uncomprehending) He will be pleased when he comes home

After a few yards, the thought strikes him: he turns back to look at the little   who stands alone patiently in the vandalised wilderness

47 It is the end of the work day
The  are busily getting their coats and leaving the office
As the last one goes
comes out of his private office with his hat and coat on
He turns out the office light
He sees  isolated in the empty room, still working at his computer console
Totally absorbed in what he is doing
Oh
Sam
've had the transport pool onto me
You don't know anything about a personnel transporter gone missing do you
doesn't seem to hear him
On the computer screen is a front and side view picture of
Her name and code number is at the top of the screen
is punching up personal dossier information like "age", "height", "weight", "colour of hair", "colour of eyes", "distinguishing marks" etc
(preoccupied) "personnel" transporter
They've got it wrong
had a personal transporter
'll do the paperwork tomorrow - punches up a few more categories for 's dossier
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque
delivered it
Can  forget it
Yes
punches a few more buttons on the computer
What a relief
(on reflection) shall probably have nightmares
At this point the word "Classified" superimposes itself over most of the screen and "/3" starts agitating at the bottom Damn
Blast
What's the matter
You don't happen to know how  can get around an /3 do you
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified
know that
All enquiries to Information Retrieval
Which is hopeless, of course
They never tell you anything
But come the time they want something from us
Throughout this verbal wallpaper  has been punching keys cancelling the  overprint
He then punches in the code for a hard-copy print-out
's two-view computer portrait rolls out as  ponders his options
(cutting off Kurtzman) 've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't
Yes
(realising what he's suggesting) You can't
You've only just turned it down

What
Shit
It's what you wanted isn't it
Yes
No
don't, know
picks up 's print-out and glances at it
He grimaces and drops it back on the desk with a shudder
Come on, before they turn the lights out
nods
He turns off the machine
He stands up and follows  towards the door
The door is some distance away, and before they get there all the lights go out
bumps into a desk and curses

Passengers disembark and head for various doors along the corridor

Looking as if he's trying to make up his mind about something he heads for his own front door

The place is in a state of turmoil
Servicing panels are off the walls
Conduit, ducting, pipes, unknown mechanical horrors spew from the wall as if the place was disemboweled

is not visible but there is a great deal of clunking and banging going on somewhere behind the wall
What the -
How did you -
Emergency procedures

Get out of here
For reply  whips a small tape-recorder out of his bag and plays back 's original phone call to Central Services, claiming "an emergency"
shuts off his machine, puts back into his bag and comes out with what looks like a quite thin phone hook with carbon paper between each page
indicates the bottom of page 1
Sign here please

Now where's he got to

This is the panel which  had removed and replaced
few of the flat's intestines have come out with

What have you got there

Yer nostril
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage

and  and the other workmen gather up their tools - put them in the bag, grab everything else that belongs to them and are leaving
grabs the form-book out of 's hands, rips out the last page, thrusts that page at , shoves the book into his bag
The begin leaving the flat
Hang on
Wait a minute
You can't just go and leave it like this
(mock innocent) Why not
All you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you
ven't you
(leaving) You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services - sod you, stupid twit
They go, slamming the door behind hem, leaving  in the ruins of his flat
stands in the maimed sitting-room
Wall panels are off
Tubes, ducting wires etc
spill out into the room like greasy intestines
more or less collapses onto a couch
He stares at the ceiling
The room is gently hiccoughing and belching around him
He stares at the print-out of 's face
Slowly it dissolves into the 51
51 's face fills screen
The camera pulls back to reveal that she is separated from us by a tangled forest of conduit/ducting-like vines
is struggling through the vines, which grab at him, entwine and entangle him
Finally bursting free he reaches out for the  hovering before him, But as he embraces her she dissolves in smoke and he plummet into a void beneath his feet
52
52 to  plummeting down through dense clouds, his cape twisting around him
Somehow he manages to wrestle it clear of his body
Gripping the corners he whips the cape up and over his head
The wind catches it and fills it out until it acts as a parachute slowing 's descent
Suddenly the clouds thin out and  can see below him
53
-        53 is heading down towards a barren landscape
Strange mounds dot the barrenness - they ooze smoke and the occasional flame
Near one of the mounds are two long lines of shrouded  being forced into two giant cages, suspended beneath two great misshapen balloons
The black-robed    () surround the , relentlessly herding them towards the cages
The entire scene is strangely coloured by unearthly light
The sky is blood red and where the sun should be is a black disc
descends on his cape-parachute
to  in their grey shrouds, shuffling towards the jaws of the brutal cages
They are defeated, destroyed, without hope
The  prod and whip them forward
One of the  raises his spear to force a stumbling  to his feet but stops with the spear raised above his head
He has seen something
Other turn to see what it is
to  landing on the beach - a short distance away
The  stop and look up
We see their faces clearly for the first time
One of them is Others are   saw in the flats, and the
recognises them
He is slightly taken aback
look of determination crosses his face
He draws the sword
is frozen in place
starts forward
But he is stopped by a violent tremor as the earth begins to tremble and shake
looks terrified
With a mighty roar a crack opens up in the ground between  and the
Brilliant rays of light shaft upwards from the opening
And then, with a maniacal shriek, the large black flapping thing shoots out of the crevasse and streaks high into the sky
hesitates and turns to look down into the light
There, under several meters of the earth's crust are fluffy white clouds darting about in a beautiful blue sky
is delighted but as he looks up he is frozen in his tracks by an enormous  that straddles the crevasse
This terrifying  stands over 12 feet high
He is encased in a frightening concoction of ancient Japanese armour which seems on closer examination to he made of computer parts
His face is hidden behind a horrific steel mask
It is the    that was pushing the drawer closed in the Storeroom Of Knowledge
In his hand is an evil-looking spear
is unsure which way to turn
The   are being loaded into the cages with more speed
He turns to face the
As  steps forward the  stands ominously still
Then very slowly he raises his spear in an almost religious gesture
He vanishes
As he does the light from the day is cut off
Looking down,  sees that he crevasse has vanished as well
Maniacal laughter from the flapping black thing makes  look up to see the ballooned cage packed with   rise up from the ground and begin to float away escorted by the Black flapping Thing
rushes after it grabbing one of the trailing ropes
But as he is hoisted into the air it is severed by the
He tumbles to the ground
Looking around he sees that, for some reason, the second ballooned cage is still tethered nearby
rushes over to it and begins chopping the tethers away
The cage bobbles ungainlily as  cuts the last restraining rope
Grabbing hold he is pulled upwards, but before he can reach the cage something clutches his leg halting his progress
As he struggles his other leg is caught
He is being pulled back by two giant hands
Looking down he can see that from the top of one of the smoking mounds a head and two giant arms protrude
The face looks like
desperately clings on to the rope as he struggles with the restraining hands
Don't go
It's a trap
She's not what she seems
kicks and strains but the hands hold firm

'                                    54 wakes up
His feet are entangled in some wiring and ducting
He is still in his devastated sitting room
As he untangles himself the door bell rings
It takes a moment for  to recognise it as the door bell
Annoyed and still disturbed by the dream he gets up and goes to the door
He opens it
In bursts a  dressed in a silly bell-boy costume with lots of glitter, net stockings and big-bowed tap dancing shoes
She launches into a terrible song and dance routine
(singing) Mrs Ida Lowry requests the pleasure of your companyyyy at her apartment tonight, from eight thirtyyyy midnight to celebrate the completion of her recent cosmetic surgeryyyy The guest of honour will be Mr Conrad Helpmann, Dep
Under Minister of State for Public Information, by singing telegram
and the  stand looking at each other uneasily for a moment
Er
Thanks
It's reply paid
Oh
(he sings uncertainly) Thank you very much, mother, but actually - You don't have to sing it
Oh, right
The  begins to dance again - but this time in a rather strange strangled fashion
(he looks at his watch) Aren't you a bit late
- the party started half an hour ago
Yes,  know
It's the backlog, everybody complains
Was it all right otherwise
Yes, it was
very nice
thank you
Do you mind if  use your bathroom

'                             55 rings the doorbell to his mother's flat
He is wearing
an unstylish tuxedo and bow tie - obviously his only dress outfit
The door is opened by a who's about to speak when an attractive 40-year old woman's face appears over his shoulder and addresses over the threshold
Sam, 'm so glad you came
Do come in
56
'                                 56 steps inside, where the flunky proceeds to search him
The place is full of sleek people - smartly but less formally dresses than
It is an elegant baroque room - lavishly appointed but still violated by the ubiquitous Central Service ducts that thrust through antique tapestries and gilt mirrors with little regard for aesthetics or the interior decorator's feelings
(bewildered) Mother
Is that you
(taking his arm - looking slightly askance at his clothes) Of course
Isn't it wonderful
The bandages came of this afternoon
Come and join the fun
Everybody's here

Yes he is - he wants to talk to you

Glad to help

It's as though he's there speaking to me - "'ere  am,

We see that  has traced the letters  in the powder

And  promised your mother 'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval

Too late

The lift doors close
looks up and down the corridor hearing nothing
Silence
Then he, and we, begin to hear a sound
It is a curious whirring murmuring tummeling sound, and it seems to be growing closer
Suddenly a scrum of  swings into view around a corner at the far end of the rather long corridor
At the centre of the scrum is a   with a magisterial expression and an air of eternal bustle
This is
He is surrounded by the  who are competing for his attention with bits of paper and bits of sentences
is snapping out decisions
Satisfied drop out of the scrum at intervals, disappearing one at a time through one of the many doors which line both sides of the corridor
The scrum doesn't get any smaller because new  dart out of other doors and join the milling
The whole circus is coming by  at the rate of knots
The sound it makes breaks down into something like this
1 (waving pager) Mr Warren, this order
2 (waving same) Mr Warren
3 (ditto) About this invoice
Victim's list (dealing on all sides) Yes
No
send that back

okay
put half as terrorists, the rest as victims yes
yes
no
definitely no
doesn't have the nerve to jump into this
The scrum sweeps by and fades away along the corridor, and finally disappearing around the corner at the other end follows
Silence has descended again
61
61 gets to the corner of the corridor and finds a similar corridor at right angles
He hesitates and continues
Then he starts to hear the sound again
It is coming up from behind
has circumnavigated the building
The same sort of business is being enacted at the same pace
As the scrum reaches  he gathers his nerve and jumps right in beside , and keeps going

Ah, here we are

The door says:  /015

Congratulations, /015, welcome to the team
whirls off in a flurry of paperwork and leaving  standing dumfounded at the entrance to his office
to 's  of the office
It is about four feet wide
small blacked-out window high on the far wall is bisected by what looks like a recently constructed side wall
The room is bare except for a chair and a desk which is also bisected by the new wall
Pneumatic tubes hang from the ceiling

'                                    62 looks lost
disoriented
He doesn't know where to begin because there's nothing to begin with
He squeezes in behind his desk and for want of anything else to do starts arranging his "in" and "out" baskets
There in his "in" basket is one of the ubiquitous executive toys - gaily wrapped with a card from  - Merry Xmas & Welcome
can't quite believe
He returns to lining up his pencils, placing a couple of bocks (phone books) against the wall on the left extreme of his desk turns his attention away from the books when suddenly they both fall over with a "plop"
Puzzled, he stands the books up again, turns his eyes away and "plop"
Same result
Intrigued, a bit exasperated,  carefully, and before his very eyes, the desk begins to disappear into the wall, and "plop", the books topple over
Puzzled,  grabs hold of the desk and begins to try to pull it back through the wall
The desk moves back an inch or so, but then stops, somehow held stubbornly
grits his teeth, reallllly pulls, grimacing a bit, but the desk won't budge
Intrigued,  gets up, goes around his desk and heads for the door
63
63 Cut to  coming out of his office, turning right and walking to the next door, the nameplate of which reads: /048
As is his custom,  opens the door without knocking

Here is an office much like his
It's the other half of his room bisected by the partition wall
The other half of his desk is occupied by a slimy looking, round-headed little   wholly occupied with trying to drag a bit more of the desk into his office
He is unaware of
Hello
startled, lets go of his desk and vents his irritation on  whom he mistakes for someone else
No, you can't have any more chairs
There's only one left in here now, and  need that to sit on
(realizing his mistake) Oh
er, sorry
Who are you
Sam Lowry
(becoming unctuous) Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha
(he advances toward Sam with hand out to shake
Shaking hands) My name's Lime
Harvey Lime
Welcome to Expediting
Ah
(he pauses - looking around) Would you mind if  borrowed your computer console
What
'll bring it back in ten minutes
You want to take my console into your office
Yes
(after a moment's consideration) 'll tell you what
You tell me what and 'll do it for
'm a bit of a whizz on this thing
(indicates computer console) hesitates, but sees that there's no other way
(taking print-out on Jill from his pocket) Alright
There's someone  want to check out
woman called Gillian Layton
(leering) woman eh
see

But  need an address or a place of work or something (continuing to leer) This is your dream girl, is it
(taken aback) What
(recovering) Look, let me use the console for a few minutes
(trying to be jocular) You must be joking - (entirely unconvincing) When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me
Now, let me have that sheet
He takes Jill's print-out sheet from  and begins to punch the keys laboriously with one finger
Nothing happens
Sod it, it's broken
You haven't switched it on
Oh - yes
Look you're putting me off, standing there
Go back to your office and 'll give you a knock when 've finished

Go on

'                                    64 is sitting in his office listening to the protracted one finger exercise which is going on next door
He stares dumbly at the shining, absolutely useless, executive toy
65
-        65 The  skims along over an icy sea
This is ' as he wings his way over the water with his new gleaming wings
In the distance rises a strange massive ship
As he gets closer we can see that the snip is listing heavily to one side
In fact it is barely afloat
Closer still, it becomes apparent that the ship is made of stone
Dark, evil, grey blocks of granite form not only the hull, but the super-structures and smokestacks
It looks like a massive medieval fortress gone to sea
The screen is engulfed in stone
The  heads up the side of the ship
Higher and higher we climb - past course after course of mammoth stones
Reaching the first deck, we continue upwards
There appears to be no entrance
is looking frustrated and angry
But then he spots an opening
few stones have come loose - one of them juts out forming a ledge
As the cage passes,  jumps and managed to gain a foothold on the outcropping
Squeezing thru the gap in the rocks, he makes his way thru a dark passage
Emerging from the opening he finds himself teetering over an enormous abyss formed by the outer hull and the inner stone core of the ship
Great stone ribs curve downwards thru the darkness broken only by narrow shafts of brilliant light streaming from occasional cracks and fissures in the stone core
For a brief moment gets a glimpse of blue sky thru one of the openings but his attention is distracted by a distant moan
Huddled far below him at the bottom of the dark abyss are hundreds of grey shrouded
Their moan blends with the creaks and groans of the stones as the ship slowly wallows back and forth
Suddenly a great boom resounds throughout the ship
is unsure where it comes from
And then another boom reverberates about him
He has to steady himself as the ship quivers from the noise
Another book
He clutches at the wall
66
'                                   66 's head is leaning against the wall of his office

As he leaves his office he looks back to see the desk creep through to 's office a little bit more

He looks at the other side of the paper but there's nothing there
Is this all you got
It's a start isn't it
(disbelieving) But  already knew this
Best to take it slowly where some women are concerned
sits on 's chair and deftly punches the computer keys
Hey - that's my desk
(working quickly) Gillian Layton - Suspect /5173
Truck driver
All enquiries, reference officer 412/ - Room 5001
(switching off the machine and getting up) That's what  wanted to know
Thank you very much

68 heads off down corridor
&
appear
Ah, Lowry, glad  caught you
(he continues to deal with expediters in between dealing with Sam) No, send it back for
Are you settling down
want this order rescinded
There's a query on a personnel transporter you took out from the pool
Tell them no, tell them yes,
or was it a personnel carrier you took out from transportation
Send that up to Security
Some kind of eight-wheel- half-track, was it
Tell him want to see him
Send round the paperwork, Lowry
Arrange a conference on that one
Anyway, tidy it up, Lowry, there's a good chap - get a new suit
Did you want the lift
The cavalcade is passing the lifts
backs away into the open lift
The cavalcade passes on out of sight
The lift contains a  with a bucket and mop
She remains in the lift as  joins her
69
69 presses the button for the 50th floor
The lift doors close on him and the
From somewhere far away there is the groaning shriek of a man in pain
glances around the lift
There appears to be an air conditioning vent in the ceiling
glances enquiringly at the  who merely smiles at him
Another scream is heard
What's that
The  smiles again
Doesn't that disturb you
The  fiddles with something in her ears and pulls out a pair of wax earplugs
Beg your pardon
The lift arrives
70
50TH                              70 The lift arrives
steps out
The  remains in the lift
The doors close
heads down surgically clean white-tiled corridor
Passing a white-coated  monitoring what appears to be electric meters,  comes to a door with 5001
Above the door a red light is glowing
knocks
The red light goes out and a green light comes on
enters
71
500l                                      71 Inside there is a connecting door to he next door room but the only person in the immediate room is a pleasant- looking  typist, wearing headphones, chewing gum and typing with great facility
approaches the  who, busily typing, twinkles a greeting (mimed) and silently mouths the words
It won't be long now
(she carries on typing) nods, and stands quietly by her
He can hear tiny sounds coming through her headphones
He looks down at the piece of paper in the typewriter
He reacts a bit strangely, perhaps even winces
We see he close up of the words being struck crisply on paper
, Oh God
No, don't
, please
can't stand (quietly, still typing) Can  help you
She is looking at  helpfully, holding one of the earphones away from her ear
From this earphone we can just hear quietly
Oooooooh
aaaaaahhh
please
arrrrrghhhh no
please
Oh God, No
No, stop,  don't know
'm looking for Officer 412/
The  nods smiling
She puts back the earphone and carries on typing
'm sure he won't be long now
She types a little more but suddenly stops
thought so
She takes off the earphones and takes the paper and carbonums out of her typewriter and starts collating all the different copies
Through the frosted glass door leading into the next area, can see a  come through a double door and turn left, making a silly 'hi' sign to the  as he exits from sight
She is charmed
Almost immediately after them, a white-coated  exits, but to the left
You can go in now
72
'                                  72 goes through the glass door and is about to push open the double doors in front of him
He is halted by a noise from the  - she indicates that he is to go to the left
He does so and enters an office
An antique desk with a large collection of executive toys and other tastefully reassuring furniture fill the room which is a rather oddly shaped
distorted as it by the curved wall of the much larger room that  was stopped from entering
Nevertheless the feel of the room is confidently successful
buzzing noise draws 's attention to the wash basin in the far corner
The Information Retrieval is standing by a sink massing his temples with old-fashioned scalp vibrators
His back to us
Excuse me
Are you officer 412/
The  makes no sign of having heard this
He continues vibrating his temples
(a bit louder) Er, excuse me
Getting no response  walks over to the
As he passes the desk he notices a strange mask lying face down on the desk top
It seems strangely familiar - but as it is a negative concave image  isn't sure
He continues over to the
(louder) Excuse me
He touches the  on the shoulder, who jumps with a start
He spins around and turns out to be none other than
He is amazed to see
(surprised) Jack
(recovering slightly) What a surprise
(even more surprised) Are you officer 412/
looks confused
He pauses, and then removes ear plugs
(shaking Sam's hand) Sorry about that
Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations
Thanks
Are you officer 412/
For my sins
Are you settling in alright
Yes, thanks
Terrific
'm really glad you dropped by
Unfortunately,  don't have any time right now 've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight
(diffidently) Ah
What
don't want to take up your time now, but  was hoping you could give me some information on somebody
It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you
Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock
If you give me the number of the case, 'll have the dossier here waiting
(he pulls card from his pocket - pushes it towards Sam) My tailor,
well worth the investment
(taking print-out sheets from his pocket) 've got numbers all over these - 'm not sure which is the one you want
(looking at the print-out picture of Jill over Sam's shoulder) Layton
Oh shit
What is it
You clever bastard
might have guessed
You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail
Am
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one
If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense
How do you mean
How much do you know
Not much
Enough though, eh
(getting sucked into this exchange) Not really, no
goes over to the sink and turns on the taps full blast, splashing the water noisily into the basin
Let's not fence around
This is the situation
Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215
B58/732, that's
Buttle isn't it
Christ
You do know it all
No, no,  don't
'm just beginning Honestly
Sorry, carry on
Well, your
Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an
Tuttle
mean, it's a joke
Somebody should be shot for that
So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake
You got the wrong man
(a little heated) did not get the wrong man
got the right man
The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man accepted him, on trust, as the right man
Was  wrong
Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us
Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done
You killed him
(annoyed) Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file
Don't think 'm dismissing this business, Sam
've lost a week's sleep over it already
'm sure you have There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication
We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for
So how
What 've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking
What has Tuttle done
We suspect him of freelance subversion
(dumbly) He's a freelance subversive
He's a compulsive heating engineer maverick ex-Central Service repair man with a grudge against society
Now, fortunately, we're nearly out of the wood,  think
At least we will be when  get this Layton woman under arrest
turns off taps and goes behind screen
(agitated) What's she done
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you
Er
no
Very smart
Er
but  would've found out anyway
Yes
'm impressed
(playing the game) Tell me about Layton
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us
terrorist
comes from behind the screen with a look confirming just what  fears, and hands him a suit
Ah
thanks
begins to put the suit on
(hesitantly) But surely,  mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and
(picking up photograph of wife and kids from his desk) Look after that suit, eh
Barbara chose it for me
Right
Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it
(preferring to let his drop) Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family
Why
Why
Hell, not for any reason
{baffled) don't follow you
Out of kindness
(utterly baffled) Kindness
What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry
(deciding to abandon this line of country) So what are you going to do about her
Get her out of circulation - 've put her on the detention list
(thinking fast) You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department
(taken aback) Well,
Good point
What do you suggest
Let me try to get to her
'll deactivate her
What does that mean
don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury
Trust me
You do trust me, don't you
Of course
We went to school together
You're my oldest friend
And you're mine
You're the only person  can trust
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us
Right
Just between as and the Security Forces
They weren't at school with us
But, 've already put her on the search and detain list
Take her off the list
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested
Say it was a mistake
We don't make mistakes
Well, 'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does
Let me borrow her dossier for a while
Er
alright
For Christ's sake don't lose it
Here, you'd better sign for it
presents  with something to sign
He then gives him the dossier
Thanks, Jack
'll be in touch
Do you know what you're doing
(about to say no, then pauses) Trust me
(admiring Sam's new look) Sam
we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval
Merry Xmas
(he hands Sam another executive package) 73
73 steps out of Room 5001, newly suited with old suit over arm
are guiding a  down the corridor ahead of him
Suddenly, the  breaks away from his  and begins to cannonball down the corridor directly at
is flattened against the wall as the rockets by
to  strolling past
to  running full tilt to the end of the corridor, smashing into the wall, bouncing back, getting up (now cross-ways in the corridor), bouncing off that wall, then the wall behind him, then
74
74 Slightly unnerved,  gets in the lift, pushes the button for his floor - the 30th - and immediately begins perusing 's dossier
The lift descends
But unnoticed by continued past his floor without stopping
It stops at the Lobby Mezzanine
looks up and realizes he is on the wrong floor
Angrily he pushes the correct floor number but before the doors close he hears an angry woman's voice echoing through the massive lobby
He looks in the direction of the porters desk
There stands  arguing with the
But you've stamped this form before
Why won't you stamp it now
You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it
Why should we stamp it twice
is frozen
He can't believe what he sees
The lift doors close
is too slow to stop them
Madly he pushes the buttons - to no effect
The lift descends
(At this point we had better describe the lift
It is a cross between the old metal grille lifts with accordion grille doors and the super-sleek modern lifts that rise and fall in glass tubes so that one can have panoramic views of dramatic architectural spaces such as the lobbies of the Ministry
) can see  and if  were to look up she could see descending
He is shouting and rattling the bars of the lift cage but no sound escapes to catch her attention
sinks below the floor of the lobby desperately trying to stop the demon lift
From his  we see disappearing from view still arguing with the
75
75 The lift comes to rest
is still trying to get it to respond and return him to the lobby
are waiting as the doors open
From 's  he sees them hang a sign on the door and walk away
He bangs the buttons for another moment with no result
He looks out of the lift and is able to read the sign - " "
Frantically he looks around for another lift
All the others are on distant floors - then he spots one off to one side, its doors standing open
Rushing over to it he leaps inside and reaches to push the floor number - but there are no numbers on the buttons, only letters
Before he can sort this out a voice shouts at him
Hey, you - get out of there
approaches looking tough and mean
What do you think you're doing
that's the Deputy Minister's lift
Sorry, 'm in a hurry
Hold on, sonny
let's see your fumbles through his pockets desperate to get back to the lobby before  leaves
He has forgotten he is wearing his new
badge
The  can't see it because 's dossier is covering it
Shit
it's here somewhere
My name's Lowry, Sam Lowry - Expediting can't this wait
No, sir
(getting out book of forms) 'm going to have to file a report on this
Now
what date is it today
gives up trying to find his
card
(frantic) Sorry, it'll have to wait
He runs off - dropping suit - towards some stairs he has spotted
Stop
Come back
He starts to run after
also give chase
75a
75a scrambles up the stairs
in pursuit
76
76 The original  rushes over to a guard desk and inserts key into cover of what is clearly an alarm button
77
77 still running
78
78 is still arguing with
(sweetly) You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you
If you say so
You think these are tits don't you
Ah
bet you'd like to touch them
Oh
Well don't
You're looking at twenty pounds of high explosive
And if you don't stamp this form 'm going to blow the place up
thumps the desk with her fist
79
79 The  throws the alarm switch
80
80 Alarm bells start ringing and from secret doors heavily armed  leap out, their guns trained on  as she appears to be the only person around
(shouting) has only the form in her hand - which she dutifully drops
She is terrified by the suddenness and size of the response to her hitting the desk
The  close in
rushes out of the door leading to the stairs
He can't believe the sight that greets him
He responds instinctively, Let her go
He rushes over to the Porter's desk just as the behind him come through the door
He doesn't have a clue what he is going to do but, as he reaches the group of they snap attention
Confused he looks around and then realizes his
badge, is on his lapel and the are responding as trained
The  chasing him screech to a halt when they see the others snapping to attention
Everyone looks confused, embarrassed, hesitant to make the next move
breaks the silence
Well done
uh
excellent work quick thinking
'll take charge of her now
Realising he has 's dossier, he shows it to everyone - her print-out pictures are on the front page
It's a classified matter
'll include your fine handling of the situation in my report is suddenly aware he is still holding the executive toy present - he hands it to the
(grabbing Jill) Come with me, please
He hustles her towards the door
81
81 marches  out of the main door and down the front steps of the Information Retrieval building
As he struggles with her some of the papers in the dossier slip out unbeknownst to  and leave a trail of litter behind them
Who are you
Let go
Don't look back
Act naturally
How can  act naturally, when you've trying to break my arm
to the  of the Ministry of Information front door They are looking down the steps at the retreating backs of  and  who are jostling each other
The see  elbow  in the ribs
(wincing) Ow
That hurt
Good
Come back here
Oh, God
no
He turns around, knowing that the game is up
But instead of one of the  shouting - it's an   angrily glaring at him and pointing to a "Keep your city tidy" sign above a litter bin
(screaming) Can't you read english
You illiterate foreign pig
You come here from your own filthy country and think you can mess our streets up
You should be fried alive, you dirty verminous
etc
etc
sees the trail of dossier litter blowing about the pavement
He lets go of  for a moment to grab at the papers
The  continues screaming at him, her little Pekinese dog (who incidentally wears a plaster over his bum hole) yaps at his ankles, ripping 's new trousers
is torn between trying to regain the pages of the dossier and following  who has disappeared round the corner
He gives up retrieving the paper and rushes after back to the  , who have been observing all this bizarre activity, we see one of them reading one of the pieces of paper
Hey, you shouldn't be reading that it's classified
82
82 is behind the steering wheel of her lorry which is just starting to move off
frantically runs towards the lorry, leaps on the running board and pulls himself up into the cab
83
83 (climbing in) Well done, that's it
Let's go
Vrmmm
Vrmmm
looks up and down his side of the street anxiously before realizing that  has switched off the engine and is sitting glaring at him
They are stopped, right in front of the Ministry building
(frantic) What are you doing
For Christ's sake
Get moving
Who are you
Desperately  pulls roller blind down over window
(hurriedly) Sam Lowry
Hello
This sounds insane, know, but 've been dreaming about you
Even before  saw you you were in my dreams
Weird isn't it
mean don't know what it means
but it might mean something
mightn't it
hope so
Anyway you're in danger and  think we should get out of here, now, quick
Come on
Still  does nothing
pulls down roller blind over
window
(desperate) Bloody hell
Do as  say
(hard, icy cool) No
(beginning to lose his bottle) Please
continues to sit, glaring
delves into his pockets and drags out a handful of cards and papers, most of which fall onto the floor
He then remembers that the badge he's looking for is pinned to his jacket
He thrusts it forward at
(beside himself with panic) Alright
Alright
Alright
'm Information Retrieval Officer - (he checks the number somewhere
On the badge
) /015, and 'm arresting you for - your own good
Now start up and get moving before  hand you back to them
(indicating
building) Them
Us
Them
don't know
just get going
starts up and moves off, very cool, in her own time
By now  has got the shakes
(indicting the papers that Sam has dropped) Don't litter my cab
(picking them up) Oh, sorry
84
84 high shot of the lorry, moving through the city among traffic
85
85 is preoccupied with driving
She is smoking a cigarette
occasionally glances at her
This is amazing
for me
being here with you
mean, in my dreams you
don't want to hear about your fucking dreams
Oh
But
Look, 'm sorry  shouted at you
(mainly to herself) Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval
don't know
(realizing that this includes him) Hey, that's not a very nice thing to say
blows smoke in 's direction
(waving the smoke away) You know, smoking's bad for you
It's my fucking life
(winding down the window) Yes, of course
Sorry
(lighting up another cigarette) know you
saw you through the floor, didn't
Yes
Ceiling
Why did you run away
didn't run away
left the flat
Why
didn't like it
Why not
It had a hole in the floor
Where are we going
Where are you taking me
What
Where are you taking me
Ah
Er
It looks as if you're taking me
It does doesn't it
(slightly worried) Where are you taking me
86
86 We   and lift off to see that the beautiful countryside through which we've been travelling is in fact a solid wall of giant bill-boards, advertising all sorts of wonders like pine scented lavatory paper, sea spray flavored cigarettes - you name it - These advertisements form an unbroken corridor down which the road travels
From a bird's eye  we see that the land behind the hoardings is blasted and blighted with garbage etc
87
( )      87 The power plant is an extensive, brutal, Dante's Inferno of a landscape made mainly of steel
towers, chimneys, huge pipes, buildings which look like bomb shelters
It is still daylight but the whole scene is murky and forbidding because of the swirling steam and smoke
In the murk can be seen sinister-looking  in protective clothing and hard hats
This is the world which is now entered by 's lorry
The lorry halts at a despatching hut near the crane and jumps down from the cab
stays inside, looking around
Something catches his eye
to facade of house
Window boxes with flowers and shrubbery surrounded by a white picket fence provide domestic charm, however, in the doorway stands a  with protective clothing and something like a gas-mask over his face
He is waving to someone
Slowly the house rises out of frame
In a   we can see the house is suspended from and a giant crane that swings it through the air - air filled with stead, smoke, evil-smelling fumes
It is lowered onto the back of a lorry and we can see that the house is one of many prefabricated houses used in the construction of the power plant
88
88 watches  walk away from the lorry and enter the despatcher's hut
He looks around uneasily and then he start examining the inside of the lorry and opens a compartment which seems to be full of maps, rags, etc
He gets grease on sleeve of his suit
In the space behind the seats he finds the pieces of luggage which  had carried away from the flat
He starts to examine this cautiously and is startled by the sudden opening of the cab door
Don't act guilty
Act like me
'm just getting on with my job
Or, are you just getting on with yours
gets into the cab and closes the door and drives to a forward looking position
What's going on here
What does it look like
'm collecting empties
The lorry stops and  gets out
From '
, the house suspended from the crane starts moving through the sky towards the lorry
He glances back to see  slip a package out from behind the seat
She glances surreptitiously over her shoulder and slipping the parcel inside her jacket she walks away
89
89 climbs down from the cab trying to keep an eye on He ends up standing next to a rusty Kodak Photospot standard
The picture on it - though faded by pollution - is of the beautiful valley that has now been replaced by the murk and mess of the power plant
has made her way over to a rather   lurking around the corner of one of the metal structures
They appear to be exchanging parcels
is worried by this suspicious behaviour - reinforced as it is by a Ministry poster on the side of the building that illustrates, almost identically, the action we have just seen along with the warning: "
"
to the house being lowered and secured onto the lorry
90
90 is starting up the lorry
is glancing over her shoulder at the suspicious parcel which is tucked behind her
They move off
The last view of the power plant is of a group of  all in protective clothing and masks happily playing a game of volleyball
91
AFTERNOON91 What's in the parcel
What parcel
nods knowingly in the direction of the parcel
don't know
Christmas present
picks it up
It's heavy
heavy Christmas present
He glances at her suspiciously
Open it if you don't trust me
hesitates and puts the parcel down
'd rather trust you
gives him a quizzical look and smiles slightly, in spite of herself
She turns away so that he won't notice
92
92 What are you doing in Information Retrieval
Looking for you
No, really
Really
mean, it doesn't suit you
(looking at his jacket) Suit me
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does
What do you mean
Would you rather have terrorists
We've got both
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval
They couldn't be worse for the Buttles
is at a loss
Why don't you say, no system is perfect
Well, no system is
Say, all wars have innocent victims
Well, all wars do - Who is this war against, Sam
Well, terrorists of course
How many terrorists have you met
Actual terrorists
Actual
terrorists
Well
it's only my first day
bursts out laughing
joins in
They are both laughing hysterically as they approach the Central Supplies depot
93
93 The impression is that the place could be an abandoned airfield out to the use of a vast open air warehouse whose contents is arranged in a grid pattern of "streets", all the streets being lined by stacks, piles, ranks, jumbles of goods and objects which seem at first to be arbitrarily grouped, some of them (like the stacks of prefabricated houses) standing in the open others protected under simple areas of roofing
Each group of Assorted Supplies lies inside the squares of the grid of streets
The streets are eerily lit by lights just being switched on, and each square is also lit by harsh localized lighting
The effect is a nightmarish gigantic Aladdin's cave of black shadows and garishly lit mountains of stuff
94
94 's lorry starts down one of the "streets"
(as they pass a clock in ""s) Look at that - right on time
What
thought you were free to come and go as you please
Well, almost
unfortunately  do have to punch in by 5
00 every day
(slightly surprised) Every day
Turn around
What
They'll be there waiting
Who will
Security
You're joking
No
Please
They're going to arrest you
thought you arrested me
Yes
but, this is real
Now, stop
(he grabs for the emergency brake) (pushing his hand away) Cut it out, Sam
(grabbing at the steering wheel) Will you please turn back
(shoving him back) Get away
(lunging for the steering wheel) Turn
(unable to control him) Stop it
damn you
throws the lorry into a gut-sucking skid
95
95 The lorry skids around a corner and roars down a side street of containers
96
96 and  are fighting for control of the lorry
You're mad
You're out of your mind
At that moment the air is split apart by the wail of sirens
and  look back
97
97 From inside two strategically placed wooden containers stacked amongst the piles of containers marked "" burst forth two Security vehicles
Wood flying, lights flashing, wheels smoking - they squeal away in pursuit
98
98 was right
Step on it
Let go
We've got to stop
Now you're the one that's out of your mind
Sam
we can't outrace them
You'll kill us
They struggle for control of the lorry
99
99 The lorry rumbles down the street of containers lurching from side to side as the battle in the cab wages back and forth
Containers are smashed open and their contents spill out only to be further damaged as the pursuing Security vehicles crash through them
The lorry escapes from the streets of containers and cannons through the main gate and out on to the streets of the city
100
100 and  are still struggling violently for control of the lorry
is terribly inexpert as a driver but he behaves like someone possessed
Through the rear view mirrors he can see the Security vehicles catching up with them
He starts fumbling with he multiple gear levers
Don't touch those
101
101 The lorry roars down a street of terraced houses and then screeches around a corner
102
102 pushes 's hand back and grabs for the lever that he thinks is overdrive
But rather than gaining speed there is a terrible lurch as the house and trailer disconnect from the cab
103
103 The house slides off the trailer which is skidding sideways and crunches to the ground just as the Security vehicles round the corner
104
104 From behind the  we can see that the house has settled across the roadway at right-angle to the other houses, making it appear to be a normal dead end street
So shocked is the  that he fails to stop in time and the car smashes into the house
105
105 Hot on the heels of the 1st car, the 2nd vehicle skids and then smashes into the house which collapses and then explodes in flames
106
'                                 106 sits paralysed with shock
The lorry has come to a halt
is desperately trying to get him to move
Come on, let's go
Let's get out of here
Oh God
What have we done
We
Don't blame me
It wasn't supposed to happen like this
(looking behind) Shit
The house is on fire
"And your children all gone
" What
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone"
Do you think anyone's hurt
Yes
(tapping him on the forehead) Come out,  know you're in there 107
107 Security vehicle in full banshee howl roars through the streets
We roar along with it as it rounds a corner and skids to a halt at a safe but striking distance from 's lorry
Heavily armed   pour out and take up firing positions behind parked cars or whatever other cover is available
Searchlights are played on the lorry
The    appears with a loud-hailer
Come out, we know you're in there
You cannot possibly escape
Throw your weapons from your vehicle and come out slowly with your hands on your heads
Obey my instructions and no harm will come to you
But if you force us to shoot we'll shoot to kill
During the above speech a   on a tricycle "roars" around a corner behind the
He rides into a gap between them, rolls his tricycle over and "takes cover" behind it
He points his toy rifle at 's lorry and takes shot
In reaction to the noise made by the kid's rifle the    dives for cover and the open fire and pepper 's lorry cab with holes
few of the   then rush forward and fling open the cab door
The cab is empty

His uniform is covered with dust, oil and shit from the street
He just misses seeing the back of the  as he disappears round the corner on his tricycle

/               108 To the lush sound of musak we glide through the glittering sensuous, supportive world of ladies undergarments
As we slip past girdles, bras, panti-hose for a variety of exotic occasions we come upon  and  pushing a shopping trolley
In the trolley is the "suspicious" parcel which  was given at the power plant
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie
Are you still following me
Please, Jill
love you
Go away
There are plenty of other safe places
Why don't we go back to my flat
Leave me alone
You've got to trust me
It sounds silly but  know we were meant to meet
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me
vas just trying to help
decided to trust you
Maybe  was wrong
Whose side are you on really
Who are your friends
Who was the man who gave you the parcel
What's in it
It's the only thing you saved from the lorry
It must he something very special
saved you from the lorry and you're not very special
It's a bomb isn't it
(exasperated) Oh
Jesus
grabs the parcel from the trolley and tries to start tearing it open
'm going to open it
(grabbing parcel and trying to take it from him) No you're not
They start an ugly little struggle for the parcel
's suit gets slightly ripped
Their tug-of-war is interrupted by a voice off camera
turns to see   and  a short distance away
is heavily bandaged and sitting in a wheelchair which  is pushing
It's me and Shirley
From the '   looks as if he is wrestling with a dummy, or with himself if he is beside a full length mirror
The mirror or something obscures and  exchange puzzled looks and proceed toward
Ah
hello, Mrs Terrain
lets go of the parcel and pushes away
She moves off
(after Jill for Mrs Terrain's benefit) think that'll hold it
(to Shirley) Hello Shirley
Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present
How are you
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says 'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle
Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother
(Trying to keep an eye on Jill who is disappearing from sight) Er, yes
Shirley and  come here regularly love romantic lingerie
She unwraps a set of red and black, fur trimmed things with strategic holes in them
(coyly) Picture me in these
At this moment there is an almighty explosion from the far corner of the store
It is the corner that we last saw moving towards
races towards the smoke, dust covering his suit
He finds bras, knickers, broken shop dummies, bleeding  and   all over the place
On the edge of this devastated area he sees struggling out from under a pile of negligees and plaster dust
He rushes over to her
(frantic) Are you alright
Yes
(anxiety giving way to anger) You don't deserve to be
You should be dead, or maimed like them
How could you
(indicating the wounded) What a bloody stupid thing should
have made you open it in the lorry She has dug the parcel out of the debris and has ripped it open
Under the brown paper are a dozen brightly coloured
Christmas packages - yes you guessed it - executive toys
She throws the parcel and its contents hard into 's chest
He topples back-wards - tangling himself up with the severed limbs of a shop dummy
There's your bomb
Our annual bribes for official ass-holes like you
sits in the debris - ashamed and relieved
Liquor oozes from the broken bottle all over 's suit
He is at a loss for words
's attention is attracted by moans coming from the badly hurt
She goes to help them
(to Sam) Come on, make yourself useful, there are people hurt
goes around trying to make the  comfortable
follows her
He takes off his jacket with his Information Retrieval badge on the lapel and uses it to make a pillow for one of these
By now sirens are wailing, water sprinklers are functioning, and there is general pandemonium
run into the area and begin arresting everyone, including the  and
tries to drag off the  whom  is attending
Hey stop
she's hurt
The  gives  a thump in the side of the face with his gloved hand

'
The  looks up and as he does so he is transformed into the   from 's dream
He towers over the , the  and the debris of the blasted lingerie department
grabs for a weapon and comes up with one of the arms (now detached) of the shop dummy
It makes a passable club

He tumbles end over end - unable to stop his crashing descent
With a thud he hits the bottom
Stunned, bruised and battered he tries to get up

Is she here

He is dazed and mumbling
the only  in the wagon apart from who have removed their helmets and are relaxing while travelling back to base
(scratching his head) These helmets don't half make your scalp itch
Ooh, don't mention it
(beginning to scratch his head) And they make you sweat
Half the time  can't see where 'm going - there's a great Niagara of perspiration coming down
'm lucky, 've got thick eyebrows
That keeps it up and channels it out to my ears
stirs and groans Who's he
Someone from Information Retrieval they're always hanging about in lingerie
is coming to his senses
He takes in the situation, sees all the  and staggers to his knees
Jill

He is bruised and battered and has a black eye
His suit is torn and bloody
is gripping him by the throat and giving him a lecture
Behind , crowding the doorway, are the  who circulate around him and are the cast of the  high energy circus
is with them
This is a black eye for the department, Lowry
And  don't care how you behaved when you were at Records
Information Retrieval is an executive branch
We're proud of our reputation and we protect it
One of his  thrusts a paper into his hand - he glances at it
Damn it, Lowry, that convoy of troop carriers is still not accounted for thought  told you to deal with it
He slams the form down onto the desk which is covered with other forms
And what the hell is this mess
An empty desk is an efficient desk
He has picked up some of the forms
Good God
queries from Security, searches from Central Banking about a cheque, clarification notices from Accounting concerning unreturned receipts, another demand from the Motor Pool
Mr Warren
have to find out about
Shut up
don't know what's going on here, Lowry, but don't think you can intimidate us with your friends and relatives in high places
Now shape up
He dumps the papers and folders onto 's desk and storms off with his , leaving a gleeful  in the doorway
(grabbing Lime as he starts to slip away) Lime,  need to use your computer Sorry, a bit busy at the moment
(he indicates Sam's smothered desk) You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself

But,  has locked his door
bangs on the door
Shit

'    DAY112b storms back into his office
Reaching a peak of frustration, he stuffs all his paperwork into the pneumatic tube and sends it off into oblivion
Within seconds it returns
sends it off a second time
It doesn't return a second time, periodically something passes through the tubes causing them to move
's pneumatic tubes continue to pulsate, pressure building up
At this point 's desk begins, as before, to creep through the wall
He grabs it violently
He pulls it
There is a scream from the other side of the wall smiles
Th pneumatic tubes give a final convulsion and then there appears to be a muffled explosion outside 's office door
It shakes the whole building
goes to his door and opens it

'                       113 Every door in the corridor has been opened by the occupants of the room
All the occupants stick their heads into the corridor, all gazing with  at the variously coloured blizzard of paper which has errupted through the whole length of the corridor ceiling, from which protrudes the intestines of the pneumatic system

Come off it, Jack
Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested
'm sorry, Sam, 'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked
(exasperated) She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong
Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon
Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block
'd keep my eyes open if  were you, Sam
Bye
(catching up with Jack) You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league

Goodbye

115 It could all be coincidental
There are no coincidences, Sam
Everything's connected, all along the line
Cause and effect
That's the beauty of it
Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them

Bye bye

Jack, she's innocent
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we

Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over
117
117 is leaving the Ministry of Information Retrieval
The lights in the foyer are blazing behind him, the street lamps are lit
He is exhausted and depressed and anxious about the safety and whereabouts of Jill
He begins to retrace their first journey together, down the Ministry front steps and around the corner to where Jill's truck was parked
117a 117a stands in the passageway where 's lorry was first parked
The only hint of its once-upon-a-time presence is a small splodge of oil by the kerb
stands lost and beaten under a street light
He slumps down to the pavement unsure his next move
The street light is reflected in the pool of oil
As he stares at the reflected light it expands and becomes a patch of blue cloud-filled sky
turns to look at the actual street light
It has become a crack of blazing light coming thru the inner wall of the great stone ship
117b
-DAY117b ' 'm here Sam
Don't give up
is pushing thru the
The light from the crack shafts across the space in which they find themselves imprisoned, striking the opposite wall
There in the bright pool of light are 's wings - beautiful, shimmering silver
But, nailed to a large stone cruciform - like a crucified eagle
rushes towards them and begins to pull them loose, But before he can, a great cracking noise reverberates thru the ship and a black shadow falls across  and the wings
Looking round he saees the inner wall has split open to the level of the floor - but, blocking the opening is the draws his sword and rushes toward the
The  stands ominously still
Then very slowly he raises his spear in front of himself in an almost religious gesture
Poof
He vanishes
is confused
Suddenly a  shouts a warning and  spins round just in time to avoid a slash of the spear by the gigantic who is now standing directly behind him parries a couple more thrusts of the spear and then strikes with his sword
At thin air
The  has vanished again
can't figure it out
But he hears something whoosh and instinctively dodges as the  who is once again behind him brings the spear crashing down
Again  manages a few parries as he is forced backwards
He trips and falls to the ground
The spear goes into the ground
Before the  can wrench the spear loose,  slashes at him with his sword
But again the  disappears spins around
The  is a short distance from him rushes him
Again he vanishes
This time he reappears next to the spear and tries to free it
But  attacks again and the  is forced to do his vanishing act before he can recover the spear
is becoming exasperated with his behaviour, and as the  reappears he shouts at him to hold still, at the same time throwing his sword at the big fellow
The sword pins the 's foot to the ground before he can disappear
Instead of blood pouring from the wound, fire issues forth
takes advantage of the situation and manages to wrench the spear from the ground
The  is unable to escape as  charges, but manages to dodge a bit
However the spear catches his arm and opens a gash
Again fire pours out
As the big  tries to stop the fire,  charges again
This time he succeeds in striking dead centre
The  gasps as fire gushes from his chest
He staggers and crashes to the ground
The wounds continue to bleed fire
gets his breath back and approaches the fallen Reaching down he removed the 's mask
Fire rushes forth from all the facial orifices
But the thing that makes him catch his breath is the face itself
It's his
's
While he stares in amazement the fire begins to melt the face
In a moment it is unrecognizable
stands there stunned
Somewhere in the distance a bell tolls
118
118 's face is reflected in the puddle of oil
He is staring wide-eyed
church bell tolls in the distance
is definitely spooked
He scrambles to his feet
He's got to get out of here
He heads off down the passageway but is brought quickly to a halt
There, in the shadows, is  smoking a cigarette
He hesitates and reverses direction but, before he manages 2 paces a familiar voice comes from behind him
You're late
spins around
Stepping out from the shadows is  - cigarette in her mouth
(stunned) Jill
What are you do

how did you
Are you alright
Yes
What happened to you after
Your face
are you hurt
No
No

patrol car approaches
Quickly  grabs  and goes into a kiss to explain their presence
The car hesitates for a moment and drives on
(through kiss) They're gone
(through kiss) Are you sure
(through kiss) Yes
They resume passionate kiss
After a moment (urgently) 'mon, we've got to get you off the streets
They head off clutching one another

and are the only passengers to emerge
They can't keep their hands off one another
This is young love at its freshest and most exciting
looks up and down the platform cautiously but there is no-one in sight as the train clatters off again into the darkness
and approach 's front door
He puts a key in the door and tries to open the door but has some difficulty
Something creaks
He gives the door a heavy shove and the door opens and a shower of white powdery ice falls on his head

'                                  120 enters, followed by
His breath immediately starts come out of his mouth like clouds of steam
The flat looks as though it has been disembowelled and then deep frozen
Icicles are hanging down from everywhere
The flat looks like a scrap dump
Every wall has spilled out its disgusting steel and rubber entrails, filling most of the available space and making progress through the flat difficult
Half a dozen  are at work
They are impossible to identify because they wear arctic clothing and look more like spacemen
Their voices however belong to  and
For God's sake, what's happened
Thermostat's gone
And then some
And then some

grabs the clipboard and smashes it over 's head
The board is so cold that it snaps in two
The paper on it also snaps in two

Don't you like parties
'mon
We've got to get out of here
As  and  begin to move down the corridor they see a cigarette glow brightly in a dark recess

are operating cleaning machinery
approaches the   who is playing with the executive toy  gave him
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office
'm afraid  can't, sir
You have to go through the proper channels
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information
'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir
Thank you, Dawson
crosses the foyer, checks to see that Dawson is no longer watching him engrossed as he is with the executive toy, and slips past the lift which, at that moment, disgorges a leg-bandaged, be-crutched  who hobbles across the lobby without seeing , who slips down the stairs which he knows lead to Helpmann's private lift
125
125 creeps along the corridor to the lift door - avoiding a     who are singing carols in close harmony

They are all incredibly big and brutal looking

It's your breathing
Take a breath on the end
of the previous line, after Noel
Right, one, two, three
The  begins singing again

of 's face concentrating
He hears, we hear, a reprise of   talking to  in 's bathroom

No-one is there
Tentatively he knocks on the connecting door into the office
No reply
He slowly opens door
Mr Helpmann
Are you there
Hello
The office is empty
looks around - not sure what he wants to do
He notices his 's picture on 's desk
He is just about to leave when his eye is caught by an elaborate computer console in a side room
It occasionally chatters away
Paper print-outs fill a large bin
Hesitantly  approaches it
Looking around to make sure the room is still empty he punches the On key and the machine lights up
He cautiously pushes a couple more keys
The teleprinter machines have paused but one starts chattering now
He looks at the one which is busy
shows us the message coming through:  -  - -  15 -  -  //
This is followed by a code number
The teleprinter falls silent
returns to the keyboard and switches it off
He turns to leave
The teleprinter starts chattering again
stops and goes back to it and looks at the page again shows us:  -    - The computer spool revolves back and forth for two or three seconds and then stops
ponders this for a moment and then heads back to the keyboard and swtiches on the machine
He has he answer

'                                127 enters the flat
is nowhere to be seen
The lights are out but, from the partially opened bedroom door beams a shaft of bright light
Music pours forth
it is ""
(cautiously) Jill
Getting no answer he goes to the door and peers through
There is  but, transformed
She is wearing one of 's 's wigs which billows in the air blown by a fan
She is also wearing a diaphanous nightdress borrowed from the extensive wardrobe and is dancing slowly
She looks like the
stands open-mouthed notices him and smiles
What do you think
is it me
(still stunned) You don't exist any more
've killed you
Jill Layton is dead
He holds out a print-out
She reads it and slowly looks up
Care for a bit of necrophilia
They rush together
128
-      128 The screen is filled with brilliant white clouds rushing about a beautiful blue sky
They course this way and that
Pulling back we reveal that this patch of sky is inside a mammoth glass-like cube held aloft by four stone columns
The absolutely amazing scale of this cube is revealed as sweeps up into shot - his wings gleaming in the light
He is a tiny speck but, overjoyed -he has found the day
far below him the   gather beaming with happiness
Diving back to the ground -  unsheaths his sword and holding it aloft rushes to the base of one of the great columns
The    who have been lurking in the shadows slink back
, with one mighty swing, strikes the column - the noise reverberates as cracks begin to race up and through the column
It is disintegrating
As it crumbles the mammoth cube begins to topple
Everyone steps back
Down it plummets
And smashes into a million pieces
The bright blue sky escapes in all directions
The  ' iron collars and chains fall from their necks as they stand, surrounded by a beautiful blue sky
They look up to the sun
is exultant

'                             129 Pull back from the sun through a window
The light falls on 's smiling sleeping face
Showly he wakes
He little by little remembers where he is and reaches over for
She isn't there
Sam panics
Merry Xmas
She is sitting at the foot of the bed grinning at him
She crawls over to him - they start to embrace
Everything is going to be all right

All goes black

screams
It echoes through the blackness

130 In absolute inky darkness,  and the  move through space and time marked only by voices and sounds encountered on the way
This sound-sequence fades in and out a few times, indicating that the journey is longer than the real-time period of the blacked-out sequence

Distant howl of pain

Footsteps again

The   peers in for a moment and then steps back to reveal two   sitting at a desk
They are looking up at /us
93//608, you are charged with the following: Passing confidential documents to unauthorized personnel - viz dossier/Gillian Layton
Destroying Government property - viz an indeterminate number of personnel carriers
Taking possession under false pretences of said personnel carriers
Forging the signature of the Head of Records, Third Department
Attempting to misdirect Ministry funds, in the form of a cheque to
Buttle, through unauthorized channels
Tampering with Central Services supply ducts
Employing unqualified suspected persons for this purpose
Attempting to conceal a fugitive from justice
Obstructing the forces of law and order in the exercise of their duty
Giving aid and comfort to the enemies of society
Bringing into disrepute the good name of the Government, and the standing within the community of the Department of Information Retrieval
Attempting to disrupt the Ministry of Information Retrieval's internal communicating systems
Wasting Ministry time and paper
We would advise you that a plea of guilty will save you and the tax payer money, and will always be looked upon more favourably than a plea of not guilty
All you are requested to do at this stage is to sign this form
waves a sheet of paper
We hear 's voice
Where's Jill
Not interested
What have you done with Jill
Right
Next
The   appears briefly and zips up the hood again plunging us back into darkness
We get more muffled shouts, heavy breathing and subterranean son et lumiere
Another   opens the flap on 's hood
We see another
(more hysterical) Where's Jill
What's happened to Jill
93//608, you've got quite a list of misdemeanours here, haven't you
All this is going to take time and money, and 'm afraid, according to your bank statement and credit rating here, you're likely to be in deep financial trouble by the end of it
Now, either you plead guilty to say, seven or eight of these charges, which'll bring the costs down to within your reach, or you can borrow a sum to be negotiated, from us, at very competitive rates
We can offer you something at say, eleven and a half per cent, over thirty years
But you will have to buy insurance to qualify for his scheme
All you have to do is to agree to sign the appropriate boxes on these forms
Yes or no
'm not guilty
Not guilty you stupid bastar
closes the flap
Once again darkness and confusion
until another   opens the flap again to reveal another
(examining forms) Now, since you've elected to plead not guilty on all these charges, you'd be well advised to take some sort of insurance cover
Preferably comprehensive, or if you'd prefer, something more specific - say, against electrical charges over f70
00
And for food and accommodation costs of say, 800
00
Detention can be a very expensive business
Now, before we bore you with the small print perhaps you'd like to tell us whether you'd like to sign this insurance acceptance form or not
Think carefully before you decide
Thinking ahead in financial matters is always the wise course
The flap is closed and opened again very quickly - are revealed
This process repeats again and again - getting faster and faster
The ' faces seem to become a changing blur
Their voices overlap in a growing cacophony
The desk and the other items in the room remain static
To add to this disturbing effect the begin to gather in the room behind the As they increase in number they begin to press forward unseen by the
Soon they fill the view through the flap
We're here to save you and the tax payer money
Would you like to pay the premium for a single room with a shower and a soft bed
For a small charge we can keep visits from friends and relatives down to to a minimum
Plead guilty, it's easier, quicker, and cheaper for everyone
We're doing a survey
Aimed at providing a better service

We can see the towering filing cabinet skyscrapers of the Storeroom of Knowledge in the background

Sam, what are we going to do with you
Can you hear me, Sam

But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me
This is all a mistake
Don't you understand
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but
'm not a terrorist
You must know that

Get me out of here
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about

The bag blacks everything out

133 The bag comes off
finds himself strapped into an Information Retrieval chair
The  tracks back frighteningly fast revealing that he chair stands in an unbelievably vast room
The walls curve up and out of sight
The floor doesn't seem to be a floor at all - strange light undulates beneath
The whole effect is one of total disorientation and overwhelming size
is desperately trying to take it in
Next to the chair is a porcelain tray of evil and frighteningly ambiguous instruments
Worrysome electrical connections and meters are near at hand
As the  leave  to take up their positions near the distant door they hand over documents to the white-coated

He picks then up quickly and replaces them

He then picks up a nasty looking implement and advances on

Jack, 'm innocent
Help me
Bastard
This is all a mistake
Jack, please take that mask off

He lifts up his mask to reveal sweaty face, contorted with fear and anger
You stupid bastard

How could you do this to me
Help me, Jack

How do you think  feel
You shit
Jack
(pulling down mask) Shut up
This is a professional relationship

You can't
No, don't
's eyes widen in terror
From his  we look up at approaching
The ceiling above and behind  is suddenly and
loudly penetrated by the Ceiling Hole Machine, and in an instant without benefit of "fireman's pole", the commando-like figure of   gun in hand, leaps through the hole
is immediately followed by similar looking  with balaclavas, guerilla-type clothing, and very efficient guns
is cut down
So are the   who have opened the door from the corridor and are shooting into the room
raps out into a walkie-talkie Detonate
From somewhere near at hand there is a large explosion which rocks the room
is already unstrapping
Let's go

Together, the   burst out through the door into the large empty forecourt
137
137 The forecourt is suddenly illuminated by huge arc lights
Machine gun installations open fire
The  are totally exposed
They are cut down left and right
Desperately they battle their way across the open space
Time running out
, knowing the way, leads towards a shielded spot
Will they make it
As the last is cut down  and  dive for cover
massive explosion
Then another
And another

looks up
Christ
The building is being blown to bits
Certain windows are lit
They spell out
With a final massive haemorrhage the building erupts in a geyser of masonry, steel, paper and dozens of
consoles and visual aid apparatus including, in large chunks, 's masterpiece
But also tons and tons of paper
Every file in the building has burst its seams and ejected its load skywards
The night sky is full of white rectangular wisps
Ashlike they flutter down over the city
looks around and can't see  anywhere
He shouts for him
But the remaining  have spotted and  runs

138 runs madly through paper-littered passages 139
NIGHT139 Eluding his pursuers,  dives into a crowded, garishly lit, shopping centre
Once among the protective company of he mindlessly shopping ,  slows down and proceeds casually
The  go about their programmed business paying no attention to the paperwork swirling about them
Searching the ,  spots  making his way towards him
is having a bit of trouble walking against the steadily increasing wind
As he proceeds across an open area a blown piece of paper
catches on his foot
He tries shaking it off
It remains firmly stuck
While he is struggling with the piece of paper another, larger piece catches his other leg
He begins to lose his temper trying to dislodge the flying debris
Another hits him and twists around his arm
Still more paper blows against him
He is having difficulty staying upright
Twisting this way and that he tries to free himself, but more and more paper covers him
He is practically obscured from view
can't believe what he is seeing
continue about their business, apparently unaware of ' terrible plight
Apart from who loses control of her shopping trolley - and watches it career down the steps of the shopping precinct
By now  is totally encased in this cocoon of litter
He is now just a ball of paper writhing about on the ground
has to do something
He rushes out from his hiding place and tries to pull the litter off
The pieces come loose with surprising ease
The wind carries them away as  frantically tears at the pile
But there is no sign of
Nothing
The last few pieces of paper flutter away leaving  standing there with a couple of posters in his hands
He realises that he is suddenly very visible
All the shopping bustle has stopped
They are all staring at him
spots shouldering their way towards him
He turns tail and dashes off
140
'                               140 The drawing room door burst open as  dashes in goes straight through and into the bedroom
The room is empty of all terrestrial human life forms
hollow wind blows the curtains
141
'                            141 The room is in chaos (and there is a hole in the ceiling)
turns and sees a silhouette in the doorway
He rushes forwards
142
'    142 But it's  the porter who is at the door watching running towards him
(piously) sad loss
Your mother was with her at the end
The doctor said there was no pain
grabs  round the neck and shakes him
Where is she
143                                         143 comes running around corner
He is suddenly bathed in a strange blue light
He halts and looks up
There opposite him is a large blue neon cross above the entrance to a chapel of dully modernistic design
Holy music from an electric organ can be heard
rushes up the stops and through the door
144
-   144 to  slipping into the chapel (in tight spot) and suddenly being confronted by  the Maitre
Ah, yes, Mr Lowry
It's so good you could make it
Right this way
, dumbfounded, follows
to  being lead into the middle of the cold, modern chapel which, possibly for the occasion, has been tarted up with some red velvet curtains that help make it a bit theatrical
large flower-smothered coffin rests on some sort of raised stand in front of the altar, a  stands in the pulpit, and a fair sprinkling of  sit in stepped seats on three sides of the room
The coffin is closed, but a length of bandage has escaped the lid
Standing amidst the floral tributes is a large, rather idealized, colour portrait of   looking not so much young as beautiful
Among the  are and  and others in their operating gowns
To enlarge on the scene, we see   snuffling in her hanky and a few others chatting amongst themselves, the standing in his pulpit waiting to get on with it, etc
to  trying to take all this in, stopping in the middle of the room
Don't forget   sobbing
(stopping and looking back at Sam) Mrs Lowry
Mrs Lowry is
In the background the  begins speaking, and we hear his voice throughout the following action
' (in background) At these times of giving and receiving let's remember the greatest gift of all: not a gift to be spurned, not a gift to be opened and carelessly set on one side, not a gift to be taken back and changed, but the gift of eternal life
Mrs Terrain has just received that most wonderful of all gifts
She came to us physically new, she goes hence from us not so physically new
But the spirit never grows old
And in the domain of the Eternal Giver, Mrs Terrain shall dwell in bountiful joy forever

Oh
(starts to follow Spiro) (coming up to back of woman) Madam
to  turning, half in flirtatious conversation
It is 's , but miraculously another twenty years younger and
a parody of 's Dream Girl
Sam
(uncertainty in her expression) (staring dumbly, not knowing what to say) Mother
What
what's
you've got to help me
(embarrassed, unsure) Not now
please (belligerently) Ida, is this fellow bothering you
(getting up) 'll - But before we can find out what he'll: : to entrance to Chapel as a squad of  come crashing in
begin to scatter, screaming
The spot  who dashes away from his  and heads for a door behind the altar
In his panic he crashes against the coffin which topples over spilling its contents
a hundredweight of offal
covers his mouth and dashes through the door
145
-                       145 to , really dashing madly, tripping over things, hurting himself, getting up running
He is in a maze of machinery
Every way he turns his path seems blocked by either  or  from his dreams
The walls of the maze become more simplified as he goes deeper into it
More rectangular, higher
We see a top shot of the maze with  separate from the pursuing but they are closing in on him from all sides
The maze extends as far as we can see
turns left and right through it, always there is a chance of turnings
Until
he rounds a corner and for the first time there is nowhere to go
The maze leads straight ahead to a dead end
At the end of the maze is a great pile of detritus from the consumer society
Televisions, washing machines, hair dryers, junk
can do nothing but try to dig through this pile
Maybe he can defend himself with something here
He scrabbles away
Looking back he sees the massed , ,    heading toward him
No escape
He digs, harder, faster
Junk flies everywhere
He actually reaches the end wall
Back to it, he turns to face the foe
But as he moves against the wall his hand touches something
door knob
He turns
It's a door
The knob turns easily
The door swings open
dives through it
146
146 finds himself in a strange little house empty of furniture except a few fitted cupboards and a fitted bed frame
He tries to lock the door behind him but there is no key
He puts his weight against the door to keep it shut
From outside there is the general noise of pursuit but this fades and resolves itself into a fairly quiet uniform engine-sound
lets go of the door carefully
He looks around but there is only one window and it is shuttered
He carefully opens the door a crack and he sees- ' :  rapidly receding street
147
147 's truck, with the house on its back, is driving dangerously through he streets
It lurches round the corner
148
148 - The lurch throws  to one side
He picks himself up, and, fighting the centrifugal force, works his way to the shuttered window which is at the front end of the house, in the wall opposite the door
undoes the shutters and finds himself looking at the rear window of 's cab
He sees the back of the 's head
The  is wearing 's cap
He sees the back of the 's cab
He bangs on the glass of the cab
The  raises her head so that the face is visible to  in the driving mirror
He sees that it is , in a flat cap
She smiles at him
sobs with relief and love
149
149 The lorry, travelling slowly now, approaches then breasts the rise beyond which lies
looking more than ever

We  towards it through a

150 Through the windscreen we see the dawn coming up ahead
The reverse shot shows us  driving and  next to her
They glance at each other
151
151 The lorry, travelling slowly now, approaches and then breasts the rise beyond which lies We  towards it through a 152
152 Half hidden in the heart of the valley is the truck with the house on its back
Creepers and wild roses have grown up over the truck and some of the house
curl of smoke rises from a makeshift chimney which has been attached to one of the walls
small piece of ground around the truck has been cleared and made into a pretty garden with a vegetable plat
There is also a pretty cow, and some chickens
appears locking like  carrying a basket of eggs
153
153 is in the bed, just waking up
He opens his eyes, locking calm
Off screen we hear the door opening
(off screen) Morning
Sleep well
nods his head slightly, on the pillow

154 high shot
Everything in the garden is definitely lovely
The music tells us
The music swells and the camera slowly pulls back, and back
It's a happy ending
And then, in the foreground,    appear looking straight at the camera
It is   and
They both shake their heads
He's got away from us, Jack

155 Sam is sitting in the  chair
He is strapped in
His eyes are open but miles away
His face is wreathed in a benign and very happy smile
'm afraid you're right, Mr
Helpmann
He's gone
wide shot of the room shows us  and  turn away and leave
is left alone
He is humming
The camera pulls back and back
The Information Retrieval room with  in it floats away into the most beautiful glorious sky ever
's humming into a full orchestra, and we hear
"Brazil, where hearts were entertained in June, We stood beneath an amber moon, And softly murmured 'Some day soon' We kissed and clung together, Then, tomorrow was another day
The morning found me miles away, With still a million things to say, Now, when twilight beams the sky above, Recalling thrills of our love, There's one thing 'm certain of, Return,  will, To old Brazil
