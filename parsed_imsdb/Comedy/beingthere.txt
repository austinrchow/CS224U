href <b>// --> </b> Being There - December 16, 1978 Draft : - ,
- An afternoon in late November, the leaves have left the trees, and the early darkness of a winter dusk approaches
The garden is long and narrow, guarded on either side by a high brick wall
At one end stands the rear of a three-story brick townhouse; at the other, a one story brick building
is heard in the distance
, handsomely dressed in a well-tailored suit of the 1920's, works in the garden
gardener's apron protects his suit from the earth as he turns the loam along one of the walkways
He works slowly,-precisely, obviously engrossed in his surroundings
This man is called
Chance stops working for a moment, takes a pocket watch from inside his coat, checks the time
He looks to the darkening skies, returns the watch to his pocket
As Chance starts toward the one story brick building, he takes a spotless rag from his apron pocket and wipes the dirt from the tines of his pitchfork
- The sound of the music increases as Chance enters the garage from the garden
gleaming 1921   is revealed as he walks through the garage and leans the pitchfork against a wall
Chance takes a neatly folded cover from a shelf, carefully puts it over the car
When he finishes covering the car for the night, Chance picks up the pitchfork, leaves the garage through a side entry
- The Potting Room is filled with the tools of the gardener, everything arranged in an orderly fashion
Rows of small pots are on tables, young plants sprouting from some of them small, 1940's table model black-and-white  rests on a shelf
It is playing, tuned to the
Attached to the front of the screen is a wheel containing colored gels
The wheels spins, creates an early form of color
As Chance enters, his attention is on the television set
He watches it as he oils the tines of the pitchfork and puts it away
Chance turns off the  and leaves the room, but the sound of the Boston Pops continues
'  - room adjacent to the Potting Room
large screen remote control color television set dominates the room
It is on, tuned to the Boston Pops
In contrast to the new , the rest of the room is sparsely but tastefully decorated with expensive furniture of the twenties
There are no books, magazines, newspapers or reading matter of any kind to be seen
Chance comes in, watches the  with a detached gaze as he removes his apron
He changes the channel with the remote control as he puts his apron and the pitchfork rag into a laundry bag
He takes off his suit jacket, hangs it in the closet where it is accompanied by several others, all of like quality
Chance changes the channel once again
- Chance, wearing a different suit and carrying the laundry bag, crosses from the rear building to the main house
-  / - The interior of the main house has the mustiness of age, the warmth of oak
White dropcloths and sheets cover all of the furniture
Chance enters, walks through the hallway
-   - large dropcloth is over the dining room table and chairs
It is neatly folded back at one end, leaving one chair and place setting uncovered
small portable color  is next to the place setting
Chance enters, puts his laundry bag on a covered table near the doorway
He sits at the dining room table, turns on the , and carefully unfolds his napkin, puts it on his lap as he watches the screen
, an elderly black maid, enters with a tray of food and Chance's clean laundry
(sets dinner before Chance) Evening, Chance
(slowly, perfect diction, no accent of any kind) Good evening, Louise
Louise sets Chance's clean clothes on the small table, picks up his laundry bag
The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance
(begins to eat) see
'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by
Chance, his manners impeccable, concentrates on the  as he eats
buzzer , Louise looks upstairs
(') Back up those stairs - damn
That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again
(still watches ) Is his back feeling better
Louise gives Chance a look
Gobbledegook
You and your gobbledegook
You're gonna be the death of me yet, Chance
(she turns to leave) Unless those stairs are
The Good Lord's liable to snatch up two unwillin' souls at the same time if keep on trampin' up those stairs
don't want none of that
Louise disappears through the doorway
Chance continues to eat and watch
'  - Chance is asleep, lying on his back
His eyes slowly open, and, with no change of expression, he sits up and turns on the  with the remote control
Chance gets out of bed, goes to the dresser and takes his pocket watch out of a drawer, checks the time
He crosses to the closet, his eyes never straying from an early morning show on television
He puts on a bathrobe and leaves the room
- Chance enters, turns on the  with the spinning color wheel, then waters a few of the pots with a sprinkling can
He turns off the  and exits
- Chance comes into the garage, takes the cover off of the touring car, folds it and puts it on a shelf
He leaves the garage
'  - Chance returns to his room, changes channels on the television, takes off his robe and hangs it back up in the closet, then goes into the bathroom
- light snow is falling
The door to the small building opens, Chance peeks out, then goes back inside
few seconds pass and Chance reappears, this time with an umbrella
Smartly dressed in suit and tie, he crosses to the main house
-  / - Chance opens the door, shakes off and closes the umbrella before entering
He hangs the umbrella on a doorknob, then heads for the dining room
- Repeating his ritual, Chance enters the dining room, sits, turns on the , carefully spreads his napkin on his lap
He watches the screen for a moment, then turns, expecting Louise
She doesn't appear, so he turns back, watches
After a few beats, Chance hears Louise's footsteps hurrying down the stairs
She comes into the dining room, visibly distraught
Chance looks up, smiles
Good morning, Louise
(out of breath) He's dead, Chance
The Old Man's dead
(flatly, turns back to ) see
Must of happened durin' the night, don't know
Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than  get paid to do
Then just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head
(nodding) Yes
've seen that done
Then  got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and think  woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert
He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over
' Lord, what a mornin'
(watches news, flashes of season's first snowfall) Yes, Louise, it's snowing in the garden today
Have you looked outside and seen the snow
It's very white
beat of silence from Louise, then anger
Dammit, Boy
Is that all you got to say
More gobbledegook
(Chance smiles, is silent) That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you
(with a smile, accepting death) Yes, Louise
have seen it often
It happens to old people
Well, ain't that the truth
Yes
It is
Louise throws back the cover from a chair next to Chance and sits, softening a bit toward him
Oh, Lord, Chance -  don't know what  was expectin' from you
'm sorry for yellin' like  did
No sir,  just don't know what was expectin'
(Chance doesn't react, watches ) 'spose 'd better gather up some breakfast for you
(a turn to her) Yes, 'm very hungry
(rises, looks upstairs) Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', guess
(she starts out, stops by the door) what are you goin' to do now, Chance
(gazing at ) 'm going to work in the garden
Louise gives Chance a long look, then turns to leave
(as she goes) 'll get you some eggs
Chance nods in approval, then changes the channel on the
- '  - An enclosed stairway
Chance enters, proceeds up the stairs
-   - Chance comes out of a doorway adjoining the main staircase
He moves off down the hall
-  '  - The furniture in this room is not covered with sheets but the Old Man is
There is a polite knock at the door, then Chance enters the room
As Chance moves slowly to the Old Man's bed, we sense a feeling of respect from Chance, as well as a bit of curiosity
Chance stands by the side of the bed for a moment, then he reaches down and gently pulls the sheet back from the Old Man's face
He touches the man's forehead, lightly, briefly, then replaces the sheet
Chance moves to the  (like the one in his own room) and turns it on
He sits in an easy chair next to the Old man's bed and watches a movie from the early forties
Chance puts an arm out, rests it on the Old Man's covered body
With the other, he changes the channels with the remote control
He returns to the channel with the forties movie and seems to become absorbed in a scene in which a gentleman tips his hat to a lady
The scene seems to have 'sunk into' his mind
- It has stopped snowing
Chance, wearing a hat, the gardening apron over his suit and boots, putters in the garden
Louise comes out of the main house
She is dressed warmly, a scarf over her head, a heavy coat
Chance sees her, tips his hat to Louise exactly like the man he saw on television
Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'
(a pause) gotta go now, Chance
(resumes working) Yes
You're gonna need somebody, someone's gotta be around for you, boy
(he keeps working) You oughta find yourself a lady, Chance
(she smiles slightly, with caring) But  guess it oughta be an old lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a young one any good, not with that little thing of yours
(she reaches out, puts a hand on his shoulder) You're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you
(he smiles, keeps working) Goodbye, Chance
Louise gives his shoulder a squeeze, turns and moves toward the house
(as she goes) Goodbye, Louise
Louise waves as she enters the townhouse
Chance tips his hat once again as she disappears
-   - Louise enters the hallway, picks up a couple of suit cases waiting by the door
She stops as she sees   in white carrying a stretcher down the main staircase
She notices the ease with which they bring the Old Man's body down the stairs
He used to be a big man
'Spose he wasted away to about nothin'
(a beat - then she talks to the body of the old Man) guess 'll be goin' off to find me some folks, Old Man
'm not batty enough to stay around this neighborhood any longer
The stretcher bearers move to the front door
Louise steps in front of them
(') (to stretcher bearers) Wait up
'm goin' out that door first
Louise takes one more look at the covered body, then opens the front door, leaves
'  - The  plays offstage as Chance washes up in the bathroom
He finishes, comes into the bedroom, takes a pair of house slippers from his closet, turns off the television and leaves the room
- Chance, carrying his slippers, crosses through the layer of fresh snow to the townhouse
- Chance, wearing the slippers, enters and sits at his place
He turns on the , puts the napkin on his lap
He watches for a moment, then turns, looks for Louise
She does not appear so he resumes watching
He changes channels, views a wildly exciting  game
At a peak in the excitement, he again switches channels
Chance watches  News coverage of the  of the United States greeting foreign dignitaries at the White House
on television reveal that the President uses a two-handed handshake when meeting his guests
Unconsciously, Chance grips one hand with the other, the scene on  seeming to have 'sunk into' his mind
-   - key is heard in the lock
The door opens and and   enter
Franklin, an attorney, is in his late thirties, carries a large briefcase
Hayes is younger, attractive, also an attorney
She totes a briefcase, has the look of a modern, liberated woman
Hayes appears to be surprised at the interior of the house
(looks around) This is another world, Tom - never would have believed it
Yeah
He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties
Fox hunting
Before was born
Would you take me on a tour
Gladly
(he smiles) The safe is in Mr
Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one
Franklin puts a hand on Hayes' shoulder as they,go off down the hall
- Chance still watches , waits for Louise to serve him
Franklin and Hayes appear in the doorway of the dining room
They are both surprised to see Chance
Why
Hello, we thought we heard something
(moves to Chance, hand outstretched) 'm Thomas Franklin
Chance remains seated, takes Franklin's hand warmly in both of his like the President did on
Hello, Thomas
'm Chance, the gardener
(a beat) The gardener
(thinks it's a joke, laughs) Yes, of course
Mr
Chance, this is Ms
Hayes
Hayes moves to shake Chance's hand
Mr
Chance, 'm very pleased to meet you
(doesn't rise, again shakes with both hands) Yes
Chance turns back to the  and Hayes and Franklin exchange looks
(after an uneasy pause) We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate
(a smile, totally at ease) Yes, Thomas -  understand
Another period of silence
Franklin and Hayes seem perplexed
Are you waiting for someone
An appointment
Yes
'm waiting for my lunch
Your lunch
You have a luncheon appointment here
Yes
Louise will bring me lunch
Louise
The maid
(a look to Hayes) But she should have left earlier today
(smiles at Hayes) see
(a beat) You've quite a sense of humor, Mr
Chance - but all kidding aside, may  ask just what you are doing here
live here
You live here
(a look to Hayes) We don't have any record of that
Yes
It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas
(a beat) How long have you been living here
Ever since  can remember, since was a child
(doubting) Since you were a child
Yes, Thomas
have always been here
have always worked in the garden
Then you really are a gardener
Yes
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr
Chance
Oh
Thank you
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr
Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents
No
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed
Compensated
How were you paid
was given meals, and a home
What about money
never needed money
Franklin steps to the , turns it off
Mr
Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook
No,  do not have any of those
Then how about medical records
Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist
have no need for a doctor or dentist
have never been ill have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, have never had any visitors
Joe
Who's Joe
(turns  back on) Joe Saracini
He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house
That was in 1952
1952
(changes channels) Yes
remember when he came
He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book
Some pictures
Yes
Of men and women
Oh
Mr
Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden
He would read and rest there
Come now, Mr
Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine
Yes, Thomas, that is correct
Then he stopped visiting my garden
(a beat) We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr
Chance
You have me,  am here
What more proof do you need
Franklin and Hayes exchange looks
-  / - Chance puts on his snow-boots as Franklin and Hayes continue their questioning
Have you served in the Army
No, Thomas
But  have seen the Army on television
How about taxes, Mr
Chance, surely you must have paid taxes
No
Chance picks up his slippers and leads the attorneys outside
- Chance describes his garden with pride as they walk toward the rear building
(points) Those trees were very young when first arrived
Are you related to the deceased, Mr
Chance
No,  don't think so
And  have planted and shaped all the hedges, and in the springtime you will be able to see my flowers
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr
Chance
No
(points to wall) That's where Joe fixed the bricks
They arrive at the rear building and Chance opens the door to the garage
Franklin and Hayes follow him inside
- Franklin and Hayes are taken aback by the touring car
(admires car) Do you drive this, Mr
Chance
No, Thomas
have never been in an automobile
(amazed) You never been in a car
Chance is silent for a moment, he blushes slightly
Well
From time to time  did sit in it
Just in here
It hasn't been outside since the Old Man hurt himself
(he turns) live in here
Chance moves toward his room, Franklin and Hayes follow
'  - Chance sits on the bed to remove his boots as Hayes and Franklin inspect the room
The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control
(he turns it on with the remote) He has one just like it
Mr
Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased
Yes,  understand
Chance puts on his slippers, crosses to the closet, opens the door
It is filled with men's wear
am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits
They all fit me very well
can also take his shirts, shoes and coats
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style
Yes
have seen styles on television
(getting back to business) What are your plans now, Mr
Chance
would like to stay and work in my garden
Chance turns to watch
Franklin takes Hayes to a side of the room
(quietly) What do you make of all this
really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple
In a way, he's quite charming
(looks at Chance) Yeah
It's very bizarre -  don't know what to think
Well
He's either very, very bright or very, very dense - he's hard to figure
(he unzips briefcase) Let's just keep everything legal
Franklin takes out some papers, approaches Chance
Mr
Chance, assuming what you say is the truth,  would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate
(does not understand) 'm fine, Thomas
The garden is a healthy one
There is no need for a claim
Good
That's good
Then if you would please sign a paper to that effect
Franklin hands the release to Chance but Chance does not take it
No, Thomas
don't know how to sign
Come now, Mr
Chance
(smiles) have no claim, Thomas
But you won't sign, correct
Correct
Very well, Mr
Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on
But  must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon
If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out
Move out
don't understand, Thomas
think you do, Mr
Chance
However,  will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave
(he gives Chance his business card) Call me if you change your mind about signing
(turns to Hayes) 'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite
(a smile to Chance) Good day, Mr
Chance
(returns smile) Good day, Sally
Chance watches as they leave, then puts Franklin's card on a desk without ever looking at it and turns to stare at television
-  - large attic filled with the Old Man's possessions of the past
Chance enters, turns on an old black-and-white  with a magnifying lens attached to the front
As it plays, he selects a fine leather suitcase from several, takes a hand made suit from a long rack
'  - The  is on as Chance packs his belongings
- Chance, very nicely dressed, comes out of the rear building carrying his suitcase
He stops on occasion to inspect his garden as he walks toward the townhouse
-   - Chance is reluctant to open the front door
After some hesitation, he gathers up his courage, opens it and steps outside, closing the door behind him
- Chance stops short on the front steps; the townhouse is situated in a decaying ghetto
The snow is a dirty grey, houses adjoining have their windows shattered, are smeared with grafitti
Chance tries to return to the safety of the townhouse, but the door is locked
He stands on the steps for a moment, then moves to the trash laden sidewalk
He stops, ponders which way to go, finally makes up his mind and moves off to his left
- The buildings are crumbling, rusted out cars line the street
group of Black people huddle together in threadbare stuffed furniture on the sidewalk, a fire burning between them for warmth
Chance rounds the corner, walks up to them
He stands by them, smiles
They stare back, no sign of friendship in their faces
Chance nods politely to them, then walks away down the sidewalk
- ,
- group of eight to ten hard-core ghetto youths hang out on a corner
Other passersby give them a wide berth, they are unapproachable
Chance nears the group, approaches
(friendly) Excuse me, would you please tell me where  could find a garden to work in
They turn to him as one, silent, amazed that this White trespasser would intrude on their jiving
(') (after a beat) There is much to be done during the winter,  must start the seeds for the spring,  must work the soil
One of the Black youths, , interrupts Chance
What you growin', man
The leader of the gang, , shuts up Lolo with an elbow and moves menacingly forward
(nose to nose with Chance) What you doin' here, boy
had to leave my garden
want to find another
Bullshit
Who sent you here, boy
Did that chickenshit asshole Raphael send you here, boy
No
Thomas Franklin told me that had to leave the Old Man's house, he's dead now, you know
Dead, my ass
Now get this, honkie - you go tell Raphael that  ain't takin' no jive from no Western Union messenger
You tell that asshole, if he got somethin' to tell me to get his ass here himself
(edges closer to Chance) You got that, boy
Chance smiles at Abbaz and reaches into his pocket
Yes
understand
(he takes out his remote control  changer) If  see Raphael  will tell him
Chance points the changer at Abbaz and clicks it three times, tries to change the picture
Abbaz immediately pulls out a switchblade, whips the blade open
(holds knife at Chance) Now, move, honkie
Before  cut your white ass
Chance, disappointed that the changer did not work, returns it to his pocket
Yes
Of course
(as he leaves) Good day
Abbaz, Lolo and the gang watch him go, then begin to buzz with excitement: "Who the fuck died
" "Why'd he pull that changer on us, man
" "The Old Man died, must be Papa Joe
" "He's some weird honkie, man
" - ,
- Bulletin board affixed to a storefront in Chinatown
Chance gazes at the notes pinned to it, written in Chinese
Smiling, he turns from it, walks on through the area
- ,
- street lined with adult book stores, -rated movies and strip joints
An elderly Black woman approaches carrying a bag of groceries
Chance steps in front of the woman, stops her
'm very hungry now
Would you please bring me my lunch
The woman looks up to Chance, becomes very frightened
She turns and half-runs into a sleazy bar for safety
Chance watches after her for a moment, then continues along
- ,
- Chance stands looking through a chain-link fence watching some teenage boys playing basketball
He bangs on the fence, calls to them
have seen your game
have watched Elvin Hayes play it many times
They call him "Big
" The boys ignore him, Chance walks away
,
- Chance walks down the center meridian of a divided street
He seems oblivious to the automobiles passing on either side
In the background can be seen the Washington Monument
,
- Chance seems stumped on which way to go
He looks up one street, then the other, has no idea where they lead
He turns, looks behind him and sees a large statue of Benito Juarez pointing
Chance smiles and goes off in the direction that Benito points
- Tourists are gathered around gaping through the fence at the White House
Chance is turned the other way, inspecting the branches of a dying tree
Chance moves to a  standing nearby
Excuse me
(points to tree) That tree is very sick
It should be cared for
The Policeman looks at the tree, then at Chance, figures a man dressed that well must be important
Yes sir
'll report it right away
Yes
That would be a good thing to do
Good day
Good day
The Policeman takes out his walkie-talkie as Chance walks away
- fashionable area
Expensive shops, well-kept streets and sidewalks
television store has caught Chance's eye
He stands by the display window, looks in at a dozen or so color TVs, all turned on, playing various channels
video camera points outward from a corner of the window and is focused on the sidewalk to allow potential customers to see themselves live on an Advent
Chance is intrigued by his own image
He poses, lifts one arm, then the other to make sure that it is really him on television
He moves forward, smiles, then moves slowly backward, notices himself become smaller on the screen
He steps back off the curb, frowns as his likeness disappears from frame on the Advent
Standing between two parked cars, Chance takes out his remote control, clicks it at the Advent
Four or five other sets in the window change channels, but he does not reappear on the giant screen
As he does this, the car to his,left, a large, American-made limousine, backs up
The car bumps Chance, pins him against the car to his right
Chance cries out in pain, drops his suitcase, his changer, and bangs his hand on the trunk of the limo
The chauffeur, , and the liveryman, , immediately jump from the car, run back to Chance
'm very sorry, sir
David and Jeffrey reach out to help, but Chance is wedged solidly between the two cars
(in pain) can't move
My leg
(rushes back to limo) My Lord
This is terrible, sir -   hope you're not badly injured
No
'm not badly injured
But my leg is very sore
David pulls the car forward, freeing Chance
few bystanders begin to gather as Jeffrey helps Chance to the sidewalk
Can you walk
It's not broken, is it
(leans against limo, holds leg) It's very sore
David gets out of the car, comes back
Perhaps  should call an ambulance
interrupts
Somebody ought to call the police
(looks over, smiles) There's no need for police, it's just my leg
During this, the rear door of the limo opens and steps out
Eve is in her late thirties, has the look of a traditional New England lady
She watches as Jeffrey tends to Chance
don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious
(obviously hurting) agree
Let's have a look, do you mind
Of course
would like to look
Chance bends, raises his trouser leg
red-bluish swollen bruise, three inches in diameter, is forming on his calf
It's starting to swell, is it painful
Yes
Eve moves closer to Chance, looks at the bruise
(to Chance) Won't you let us do something for you
Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital
(smiles at Eve) There's no need for a hospital
Why, there certainly is
You must see a doctor,  insist on it
Please, let us take you
Eve turns to get back into the limo
David goes with her to hold the door
'm terribly sorry, Mrs
Rand, never saw the man
Oh,  don't think it was anyone's fault, David
Thank you, ma'am
Chance is hesitant about getting in the car
Jeffrey offers a helping hand
Please, sir
've never ridden in an automobile
(a beat) assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver
Please, won't you let us take you
(looks at the car, then decides) Yes
You can take me
Very good
Jeffrey assists Chance into the rear seat of the limo
(as he gets in) My suitcase
Yes sir
'll take care of that
Jeffrey closes the door, goes back to pick up Chance's suitcase, does not notice the remote control
As Jeffrey puts Chance's bag into the trunk, we see the personalized license plate " l
" - Chance and Eve settle in the back seat
As they talk, David starts up the limo, Jeffrey joins him in front and the limo pulls out into traffic
hope you're comfortable
Yes
am
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident
Of course, they can be very frightening, and  must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before
Yes
He's a very careful driver
Why, yes, he is
Is your leg feeling any better
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore
see
(a thought) Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor
(doesn't understand) Your family doctor
Yes
My husband has been very ill
His doctor and nurses are staying with us
Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated
agree
Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you
(leans forward) David, we'll just go on home
Jeffrey, would you call and let them know
Yes ma'am
Eve presses a button, the glass partition closes
As the window rolls up behind him, Jeffrey dials the limo telephone
There is a moment of silence
Eve, still a bit on edge from the accident and feeling a bit uncomfortable with a stranger in the car, presses another button
The limo's bar moves out, revealing a row of decanters and glasses
Would you care for a drink
Yes
Thank you
As Eve pours cognac into a monogrammed crystal glass, Chance notices the limo's  set
(') would like to watch television
(a bit surprised) Oh
Certainly
She hands Chance the cognac, turns on the
(') Oh, by the way - 'm Eve Rand
Hello, Eve
Chance takes a sip of the cognac, is not accustomed to alcohol, coughs
There is another moment of silence
May  ask your name
(with a slight cough) My name is Chance
Pardon me, was that Mr
Chance
(still indistinct) No
'm a gardener
Oh
Mr
Gardiner
Mr
Chauncey Gardiner
You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you
No, Eve
'm not related to Basil and Perdita
Oh
Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years
We visit their island quite often
Chance reaches out to change the channel on the , suddenly realizes he doesn't have his remote control
He starts going through his pockets, searches for it
(') Did you lose something
Yes
lost my remote control
Oh
Well, 'm very sorry
Another pause, Chance reaches out, changes channels on
(') 'll feel so relieved after Dr
Allenby examines your leg
After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer
(Chance still watches ) Is there anything special you would like to watch
like to watch
This is fine
Chance watches the news
Eve sips on her cognac as David eases the limo out of the city of Washington
-   - The limo approaches, then turns into the entrance-way of the Rand Estate
Two guards stand on either side of the open gate, salute as the car passes through
- The drive runs alongside a stream, then turns and crosses a large meadow
The limousine passes, still no sign of the house
It is a very, very long driveway
- Chance is glued to the , switches channels, again watches the news
Eve takes his fascination with television as a sign of intelligence
can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events
Yes
admire that in a person
As for myself,  find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times
Chance nods, changes the channel, watches a Mighty Mouse cartoon
Eve looks at him perplexed, then takes it for a joke and smiles
- Two uniformed valets,  and , await the limousines by the front door of the Rand mansion
Wilson stands behind a wheelchair
As the limo parks, Perkins and Jeffrey assist Chance into the chair
Wilson turns to Eve as she gets out of the limo
Good evening, Mrs
Rand
Good evening, Wilson
shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am
Dr
Allenby is standing by
Thank you, Wilson
That will be fine
Perkins and Jeffrey carry Chance in the chair up the steps and into the house
Eve and Wilson follow
-   - Once inside the house, Wilson takes over wheeling Chance lady, , is waiting to take Eve's coat
Thank you, Greta
(to Wilson) 'll be with Mr
Rand if 'm needed
Yes, ma'am
(to Chance) 'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr
Gardiner
(looking around mansion) Yes,  think he should examine my leg
Eve watches as Wilson wheels Chance around a corner
- The doors open, Wilson pushes Chance into the elevator
As Wilson pushes a button and the doors close on them, a strange look comes over Chance's face
(looks to Wilson) 've never been in one of these
Wilson thinks that Chance is talking about the wheelchair
It's one of Mr
Rand's
Since he's been ill
Chance looks around the elevator
Does it have a television
(laughs) No - but Mr
Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself
see
Chance again checks out the elevator
(') How long do we stay in here
How long
don't know, see what the doctor says
The elevator stops on the third floor
-  - hallway adjoining a large, glass-enclosed room
Eve passes through the hall, enters the room
'   - Eve enters into a hermetically sealed area, set up with all the latest hospital emergency gear; oxygen,  machine, ray machine, transfusion equipment, sterilizers, etc
, wearing a silk bathrobe, lies in a king-sized bed in the center of the room
nurse, , is attending to her duties in the room, looks up as Eve comes in
Good evening, Mrs
Rand
Good evening, Constance
Ben Rand perks up as he sees Eve crossing to him
He is in his sixties, maintains an inner strength and dignity despite the sapping effects of his illness
(with weakness) Eve
Eve kisses him, holds his hand
Oh, Ben -  miss you so when 'm out
How are you feeling
Tired
And 'm getting tired of being so tired
Other than that, 'm doing very well
No headaches
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what 've been told
(holds his hand against her cheek) You heard
may be a shut-in, but  do not lack for news
'm sorry you had to go through all that
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling
We were fortunate that Mr
Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable
Reasonable
Good, 'd like to meet a reasonable man
Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner
(sits on the side of the bed) Do you feel well enough for that
(smiles) Hah
Tell me the truth, Eve - if wait until  feel better, will ever meet the man
There is silence from Eve
Rand squeezes her hand, turns to Constance
(') Constance
want new blood tonight, 'm getting up for dinner
But, Mr
Rand
Don't argue, tell Robert  want new blood
(turns to Eve) Ask him to dinner
Rand pulls Eve's hand close, kisses it
- An enormous bedroom, filled with 18th Century antique furniture
dabs Chance's ass with a piece of cotton soaked in alcohol, prior to an injection
Chance stands with his pants to the floor, looks to the television which is not turned on
The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr
Gardiner
understand
've seen it done before
Now, you'll barely feel this
It won't hurt at all
Allenby administers the injection, Chance reacts from the pain
You were wrong, it did hurt
(a chuckle) But not for long
As Allenby puts a band-aid on Chance's ass, Chance spots a remote control for the  on the bedside table
He reaches out, picks it up
(') It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone
Yes
think so, too
However, with injuries such as this,  have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after
see
Chance turns on the
(a look to the , then to Chance) You can pull your trousers up, now
Oh, fine
(as Chance pulls up pants) Just to take the proper precautions, Mr
Gardiner, 'd recommend we take you downstairs and -ray your leg
(no reaction from Chance, Allenby takes a long look at him) By the way, Mr
Gardiner, would like to ask you something straight out
(doesn't understand) Straight out
Yes
Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's
(after a beat) Claim
Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me
Thomas
Who's Thomas
Thomas Franklin, an attorney
An attorney
(turns back to ) Yes
(suddenly very cold) Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one
(gives Chance a look) Oh,  see
(warms up) Well, then
You're a very funny man, Mr
Gardiner
You caught me off guard,  must admit
(changes channels, sits on bed) Thank you
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr
Gardiner
In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible
Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs
can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere
Yes,  could stay here
Thank you
Fine
Would you like me to speak to your personal physician
No
Allenby waits for Chance to say more, he does not
Finally, Allenby picks up his bag, heads for the door
(stops by door) 'll send Wilson up to take you for -rays, Mr
Gardiner
Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort
(clicking changer) Yes,  will
Allenby gives him a look, then leaves
Chance watches an old movie of a man lighting a cigar
The man enjoys the cigar, blows out smoke
The scene seems to 'sink into' Chance's mind
-  - Eve sits next to a roaring patio fireplace with a steaming cup of tea
Allenby comes outside, joins her
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here
wanted some fresh air, Robert
How is Mr
Gardiner
rather large contusion, but don't feel there is any serious damage
'd like to keep an eye on him, though -  suggested that he stay here for a couple of days
Stay here
Is that necessary
Not necessary, but preferable don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man
Yes, he is different
Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington
How true
Mr
Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think
At times, yes
But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident
Actually,  found him to have quite a sense of humor
Good
It might be pleasant for a couple of days
(Eve puts down her tea) Robert
Is there any improvement
No, Eve
'm sorry
Eve is silent for a moment, looks out to the darkness
Sometimes when  see Ben could swear that he's getting stronger
Something that he might say, the way he moves, or a look in his eyes - makes me feel that this is all a nightmare and that he'll be better soon
It's just so hard to believe what's really happening
Allenby reaches out, holds Eve's hand
-    - The elevator door opens, Wilson guides Chance in the wheelchair into the hallway
(looks back to elevator) That is a very small room
(laughs) Yes sir,  guess that's true smallest room in the house
(glancing around) Yes
It seems to be
Wilson takes this as another joke, chuckles as he wheels Chance toward Rand's hospital room
'   - and another nurse, , stand by as Rand is being given a transfusion
Rand lifts his head as Wilson wheels Chance into the room
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr
Gardiner
(looks around room) see
Wilson pushes Chance to the -Ray machine, where the technician, , a Black man, waits
As Wilson and Billings help Chance onto the -Ray table, Chance's face brightens up
(') feel very good in here
Sure you do
This ward is air tight,  have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up
Yes
like that very much
(lining up Chance's leg) This won't take long, Mr
Gardiner
Please hold still when  ask
Chance stares at Billings, reacts to him being Black
(to Billings) Do you know Raphael
No sir,  don't believe  do
Oh
have a message for him
Yes, sir
Black man gave me the message
Well,  still don't believe  know the man, Mr
Gardiner
Now, hold still
Rand looks over as Billings takes the -Ray
Aplastic anemia, Mr
Gardiner - aplastic anemia
Chance smiles to Rand
(') Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells
Not a damn thing they can do about it
Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions
And what makes my blood boil, what little  have left, that is, Mr
Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease
Here am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease
(still smiles at Rand) Yes
You look very sick
Hold still, please, Mr
Gardiner
(a laugh) am very sick, and, as you can see by all this paraphernalia,  am very wealthy
think  would rather be wealthy and sick than poor and sick
(looks around the room) understand
've never seen anything like this on television
Please, hold still, Mr
Gardiner
You too, Mr
Rand, you must stay quiet
Rand lays his head back
We're prisoners, Mr
Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology
agree
(flat on his back) You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr
Gardiner
(also flat on his back) Yes
am very hungry
So am , my boy - so am
- , a waiter, and , a waitress, enter into the Rand dining room carrying trays of food
The dining room is immense, a 70-foot ceiling, huge fireplace
Allenby, Eve, Rand, and Chance (both in wheelchairs) sit around the table
Rand speaks slowly, with obvious weakness
know exactly what you mean
Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the
All they want to do is regulate our natural growth
It's happening across the country
To everyone, 'm afraid
The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence
Of course
By kid-lawyers
Eve turns to Chance
Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr
Gardiner
No
It won't do that
Would you like us to notify anyone for you
No
The Old Man died and Louise left
There is a moment of silence
Oh
'm very sorry
Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask
Do you need a secretary
No, thank you
My house has been closed
Oh
When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down
Yes
Shut down and locked by the attorneys
What'd  tell you
Kid-lawyers
The Damn them
hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you
No
like it here
That's good, Mr
Gardiner
Or may call you Chauncey
(agreeable to being called Chauncey) Yes
Chauncey is fine
And 'm Ben
(smiles to Chance) And please call me Robert
Yes, Robert
will
So tell me, Chauncey, what are your plans now
Chance looks around the room
Does this house have a garden
Allenby gives Chance a look
Do we have a garden
Hah
Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens
see
would like to work in your garden
(laughs) Oh,  know exactly what you mean sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles
am a very good gardener
gardener
Well put, Chauncey excellent
Isn't that what a businessman is
gardener person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community
Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard
Thank you, Ben
The garden that left was such a place
Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands
planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow
(weakly) Bravo
But  don't have that any more
(points to ceiling) All that's left for me now is the room upstairs
Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for God's sake don't give up on yourself
You have to fight
You can't let those bastards keep you down
don't want to hear any more from you about the 'Room Upstairs'
That's where 'm going soon
There is a long pause
Chance looks up, then smiles at Rand
It's a very pleasant room, Ben
(laughs) Yes, 'm sure it is
That's what they say, anyway
Another period of silence
The servants bustle around the room as Allenby studies Chance
'   - Allenby opens the door
Rand enters in his electric wheelchair followed by Chance being pushed by Wilson
don't know what you've heard about me, Chauncey, but 'm sure you know everything there is to know
Cigar
Rand holds out humidor to Chance
Yes, thank you
(takes cigar) No Ben
don't know everything about you
Rand smiles as he takes a cigar for himself
No, of course you don't
Excuse me for being so presumptuous
No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it
That is so true
You're different, Chauncey
Quite different than most men
Thank you, Robert
Rand lights his own cigar, then hands an ornate lighter to Chance
(picks up pool cue, weakly strokes the balls) You know, Chauncey, there are thousands of American businessmen, large and small, that share your plight
've been concerned with the situation for some time now
Chance, not knowing to bite off the tip, tries to light the cigar like the man on
It will not light
(') So 've been thinking about beginning a financial assistance program, Chauncey, to help out American businessmen that have been harassed by inflation, excessive taxation, unions and other indecencies
Allenby watches Chance trying to light the cigar as Rand speaks on, shooting pool as he talks
'd like to offer the decent 'Gardeners' of the business community a helping hand
After all, they are our strongest defense against the pollutants who so threaten our basic freedoms and the well-being of our middle class
Tell me, would you have any thoughts on such a program
Chance puts the unlit cigar in the ashtray, smiles at Allenby, then answers Rand
No, Ben
(a smile) Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey
Well,  can understand that
When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time
Just give it some thought, work with the idea, 'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days
could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore
Oh
(looks to Allenby) Robert, take a look, would you
Some pain is to be expected
(bends to Chance, looks at leg) And  think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest
(checks watch) It's late, 'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed
(puts down pool cue) We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician
agree
Allenby laughs as he takes Rand's cigar from him, snuffs it in the ashtray
-  - Wilson stands behind Chance in the wheelchair
Chance glances slowly and inquisitively around the elevator
When his eyes meet Wilson's, the valet breaks out in laughter
(laughing, trying to apologize) Sorry, sir -  just couldn't contain myself
knew you were going to come out with another one of your jests about the elevator
Excuse me, sir
The elevator stops, the door opens
-    - Wilson wheels Chance out of the elevator
(looks back as the door closes) Hmmm
Elevator
(laughs again) Yes sir - elevator
Wilson stops laughing, becomes the stone-faced servant once again as he notices Eve coming out of her bedroom
Wilson stops wheeling Chance, stands stiffly at attention as Eve and Chance talk
Chauncey,  wanted to tell you how dreadful  feel about the accident today, but that 'm delighted that you are staying with us
Thank you, Eve -  like this house very much
And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just
Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us
Ben is very ill, Eve - 've seen that before
Yes
know, Chauncey
like Ben very much
He reminds me of the Old Man
He does
Yes
Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies
Eve is not prepared for such a question
Why
No,  don't think so
That's good
Chance smiles at Eve and there is a moment of silence before Eve steps back into her bedroom
Good night, Chauncey
Good night, Eve
Eve closes the door
Wilson wheels Chance down the hallway toward the guest room
- Eve comes out of the house, Jeffrey holds the door for her as she gets into " l
" Jeffrey gets in and the limo pulls away
Chance comes out of the front door, walking with a limp
His first view of the Rand grounds in the daylight, he is taken by the extent of the greenery
An attendant, , hurries to Chance
Did you want a car, sir
Yes
would like a car
Yes, sir
Lewis goes to his post, picks up a phone
As Chance looks at the surroundings, Allenby and Wilson, with Chance's wheelchair, come out of the house
(frowns as he sees Chance walking) Chauncey, there you are
What are you doing on that leg
It's fine today, Robert
Shame on you, Chauncey - you should let me be the judge of that
(motions to Wilson) Please, sit in the chair
Wilson pushes the wheelchair to Chance, he sits
(') (checks leg) swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, 've got my hands full
(looks at calf) Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably
(pokes a spot) Any pain here
Yes, Robert
But it's not bad
limousine pulls up to the front of the mansion, waits for Chance
(continues examining) Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible
How about here, Chauncey, any soreness
Hardly any, Robert
Lewis, the attendant, interrupts
Your limousine, sir
Oh, thank you
(reacting to limo) Were you going somewhere
No, Robert
(a beat) Oh
(checks leg) My God,  only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers
Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, felt
He's due here soon, believe
Yes, Robert
know about the President
(mildly surprised) Oh
You've heard
Yes
Ben called me
He wants me to meet the President
(stands) He does, does he
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey
How do  know when it's ten o'clock
long look from Allenby, then he looks at his watch
It's five of, you'd best get on in there
Thank you, Robert
Wilson begins to push Chance
(') would like to walk today
Hell yes - walk
You're meeting the President, aren't you
(gets out of chair) Oh, really
Allenby, a bit puzzled, watches as Chance goes into the house
-  - Chance limps aimlessly through a hallway
He stops, admires a large tapestry on the wall
servant, , notices Chance appears confused, approaches him
May  help you, Mr
Gardiner
(with a smile) Yes
would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital
(a pause) Sir
Yes
There is another long pause
Did you wish to see someone, sir
Yes,  would like to see Ben
Oh, Mr
Rand, of course
Right this way, sir
Chance follows Smythe down the hall
'   - Rand is in an easy chair, dressed for his meeting with the President
The two nurses are working at the disinfecting table
Rand smiles as Chance is shown into the room by Smythe
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you
Yes, Ben
My leg is not very sore
Well, that's good news, my boy
You're looking much better today, Ben
Hah
It's all make-up, Chauncey
asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, didn't want the President to think  was going to die during our talk
understand
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is
All we know is the terror of it
But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what  admire in you, your marvelous balance
You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man
Thank you, Ben
(looks at Rand closely) The nurse did a very good job, Ben
The nurses turn, look at Chance
- Wilson is at the head of eight servants lined up on the front steps
Two black   pull up and park in grey business suits get out
One of them, , goes directly to Wilson
Good morning, Mr
Wilson
Good morning, Mr
Woltz, nice to see you again
Thank you
How have you been
Fine, thank you
(hands Woltz paper) We have an additional guest with us today, Mr
Chauncey Gardiner
(reads list) see
(turns to other men) Okay, let's go to work
The eight servants pair up with the eight men in suits and go into the house
-    - Allenby gets off the elevator, stands and thinks for a moment, then heads off down the hallway in the direction of Chance's room
'   - Chance watches television as Rand speaks
Yes, when  was younger  had thoughts about public office
But found, Chauncey - that  was able to contribute more as a private citizen
of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but 've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power
It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country
The temptations are strong, and 've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but  have tried to stay open to voices of the people
have tried to remain honest to myself
(changing channels) see, Ben
Maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position, Chauncey
Maybe one day
- Two black limousines followed by a station wagon with small holes in the side pull up in front of the mansion
As men from the first limousine and the station wagon jump out and take positions around the driveway, Lewis hurries to his post, picks up his phone
-
'  - The nerve center of the Rand Enterprises since he has become ill
Four or five desks, all the latest electronic office equipment, three 's with video taping facilities, countless telephones
, Rand's senior secretary, is at her desk, answers her phone
(into phone) Yes
Oh, very good, Lewis, thank you
Mrs
Aubrey hangs up, picks up another phone, pushes a button
'   - Rand smiles at Chance as the phone rings
He's here
(into phone) Yes, Mrs
Aubrey
(listens) Fine
Show the President to the library, we'll be along in a few minutes
Rand hangs up the phone, turns to Chance with a twinkle in his eyes
(') It's an old habit that goes along with power -- keep them waiting
Teresa brings Rand's wheelchair to him
(') (stands, very weak) Not now, Teresa
'm seeing the President on my own two feet
But, Mr
Rand
(puts an arm around Chance for support) Shall we go, Chauncey
Yes, Ben
That's a good idea
Rand walks slowly, clings to the limping Chance tightly as they leave the room
- Secret Service Men are seen in the background as Rand stops outside Mrs
Aubrey's office, leans in
Mrs
Aubrey, have you received the papers on the Caracas agreement
Yes, sir
They're ready for you to sign
Excellent
(turns to Chance) good woman, Mrs
Aubrey
(seeing her for first time) agree, Ben
They shuffle off down the hallway
Chance smiles at the Secret Service men that they pass
-    - Woltz and Wilson wait by the library door
Woltz takes a small metal detector from his pocket as Rand and Chance approach
Good morning, Mr
Rand
Woltz, how have you been
(passes detector over Rand's body) Just fine, thank you, sir
(turns to Chance) And you must be Mr
Gardiner
Yes
(passes detector over Chance) Just a formality, Mr
Gardiner
(as he finishes) Thank you very much
Wilson knocks lightly, then opens the library door, Rand and Chance enter
- Rand and Chance come into the Library and the President goes to Rand with both hands outstretched
Ben
(very weak) Mr
President, how good to see you
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific
(barely able to stand) 'm not convinced of that, Mr
President, but your visit has raised my spirits
Well, 'm delighted to be here, my friend
've missed you
(guides Rand to chair) Here, sit down, get off your feet
As Rand sinks into the chair, Chance approaches the President with both hands outstretched
Good morning, Mr
President
(smiling) Hello
Chance and the President exchange a two-handed handshake
Rand, still weak from standing, catches his breath and introduces Chance
Mr
President, 'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr
Chauncey Gardiner
Mr
Gardiner, my pleasure
You look much taller on television, Mr
President
(a beat) Oh, really
(smiling) You will find that my house guest does not bandy words, Mr
President
The President gives Chance a look, then laughs
Well, Mr
Gardiner, that's just fine with me - 'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion
Be seated, please, Mr
Gardiner
(sitting) Yes,  will
(also sits) Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to
Chance perks up at the mention of his name, interrupts
Yes
There is a beat as the President looks at Chance quizzically, then he continues
just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben
Yes,  did
Well
Overall - pretty good
But, Mr
President,  think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game
Well, Ben
sympathize with your position, Mr
President,  know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos
That's too big a risk,  can't take the chance
(again perks up) Yes
Once again, the President gives Chance a puzzled look
-    - Perkins accompanies Secret Service Agent  as he checks out the third floor
Riff knocks on each door, looks inside, then moves in
'  - Allenby is searching through Chancels clothes looking for some sort of identification
There is a knock at the door, Allenby pulls back from the closet as Riff opens the door, looks inside
Oh
Hello
(entering) Good morning
'm Riff, Secret Service
Yes
Of course
Perkins watches curiously as Riff passes the metal detector over Allenby's clothing
- The President is worried about what Rand is telling him
He paces, smokes a cigarette
Chance smiles through it all
There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where  see it, Mr
President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point
We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible
It's that serious, huh
'm afraid so
The President now looks nearly as bad as Rand
He sits, turns to Chance
Do you agree with Ben, Mr
Gardiner
Are we finished
Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives
(a beat) As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden
(a pause) In the garden
That is correct
In a garden, growth has its season
There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter
And then spring and summer again
(staring at Chance) Spring and summer
(confused) Yes,  see
Fall and winter
(smiles at Chance) Yes, indeed
(a beat) Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr
Gardiner
think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr
President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy
Yes
That is correct
(pleased) Well, Mr
Gardiner,  must admit, that is one of the most refreshing and optimistic statements 've heard in a very, very long time
The President puts out his cigarette, rises
(') Many of us forget that nature and society are one
Yes, though we have tried to cut ourselves off from nature, we are still a part of it
Like nature, our economic system remains, in the long run, stable and rational
And that is why we must not fear to be at its mercy
(he smiles at Chance, who is absorbed in looking around the room at the books) envy your good, solid sense, Mr
Gardiner - that is precisely what we lack on Capitol Hill
(glances at watch) must be going
(holds out hand to Chance) Mr
Gardiner, this visit has been enlightening
Chance rises and shakes the President's hand
Yes
It has
You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you
Yes
will
Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you
(turns to Rand) Is Eve around
'd like to say hello
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event
She'll be sorry to have missed you
'm sorry, too
Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben,  want to thank you for your time and thoughts
Nonsense, Mr
President -  thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man
Now, Ben,  won't have any of that
Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life
The President clasps Rand's hand
You're right, Mr
President  don't like feeling sorry for myself
Take care of yourself, Ben
You take care too, Bobby
(as he turns to go, a smile to Chance) Mr
Gardiner
The President leaves the library and Chance sits back down
(as the door closes) He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he
Yes, Ben - he is
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all
'm glad he came, Ben
It was nice talking to the President
- An aide, , waits by the front door of the Rand mansion
As the President comes out, he speaks quietly to Kaufman
Kaufman, 'm going to need information on Mr
Chauncey Gardiner's background
(makes note of name) Gardiner, yes, sir
And put it through on a Code Red - want it as soon as possible
No problem, Chief
They head toward the waiting limousines
-  - Rand has an arm around Chance, hangs on for dear life as the two of them walk through the hall
Behind them, Wilson and Perkins push empty wheelchairs
(very weak) You know, Chauncey, there's something about you
You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly
You don't play games with words to protect yourself
feel  can speak to you frankly
You know what  was talking to you about last night
(blankly) No, Ben
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program
think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking
'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time
understand
(stops outside his door) And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision
know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment
Thank you, Ben
And now, Chauncey, 'm afraid you must excuse me - 'm very tired all of a sudden
Wilson and Perkins leave the wheelchairs, assist Rand into his hospital room
(as they go in) 'm sorry that you are so sick, Ben
The door closes, Chance limps off down the hall
-  - Chance, with a limp, walks down a pathway in the garden, admires the greenery
In the background, coming from the house, we see Eve
(approaches Chance, calls) Chauncey
(stops, turns) Hello, Eve
Your leg must be getting better
Yes
It's feeling much better now
Good
'm glad to hear that
(they walk together) How did you like meeting the President
Fine
He's very nice
Yes, he is
'm sorry  didn't get to see him
They walk along in silence for a moment
Chance sees a huge greenhouse not far from them, heads toward it
Eve turns to him, hesitates, then questions
(') Chauncey
Last night you mentioned an old man, that died
Yes
Was he a relative
Or an intimate friend
(looking at greenhouse) He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since  was young
Oh,  see
Your mentor, perhaps
(quizzically) Mentor
Eve takes his uncertainty as a reluctance to discuss the Old Man
Forgive me, Chauncey -  didn't mean to pry
You must have been very close to him
Yes
was
'm sorry
(getting more to the point) And what about Louise mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also
Yes
liked Louise very much
She was his maid
(relieved) Oh, his maid
Stupid me, thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with
Oh, no
She brought me my meals
(pleased) Of course
Eve edges slightly closer to Chance
Chance edges slightly closer to the greenhouse, is fascinated by it
What is that
Our greenhouse
(pleased) Oh,  like that very much
Yes, so do we
Chance peeks through one of the windows
'  - Rand is in bed
Eve, Chance and Allenby are seated around him, the two nurses standing to one side
They all watch the President's address to the Financial Institute on
Chance inhales deeply, enjoys the oxygen in the room
Rand is looking weaker
Every so often, Allenby casts a concerned glance his way
' And there are so many of you that have proclaimed that we are on the brink of the worst financial crisis in this nation's history
And there are so many of you demanding that we put into effect drastic measures to alter its course
Well, let me tell you, gentlemen,  have been conducting multiple-level consultations with members of the Cabinet, House and Senate
have conducted meetings with prominent business leaders throughout the country
And this very morning  had an in-depth discussion with your founder and Chairman-Of-The-Board, Mr
Benjamin Turnbull Rand and his close friend and advisor Mr
Chauncey Gardiner
Rand perks up a bit at this mention
Allenby manages a smile, once again looks at Rand, checking his condition
Eve looks proudly at Chance, who continues to enjoy the oxygen
'  (') Well, gentlemen,  found this to be a most rewarding conference
To quote Mr
Gardiner, a most intuitive man, 'As long as the roots of industry remain firmly planted in the national soil, the economic prospects are undoubtedly sunny
' Rand starts coughing, breathing heavily
Allenby and the nurses rush to his bedside
Allenby shoots a quick look to Eve and Chance
(motioning toward door) Excuse us, please
Eve and Chance leave the room as Allenby administers aid to Rand
' Gentlemen, let us not fear the inevitable chill and storms of autumn and winter, instead, let us anticipate the rapid growth of springtime, let us await the rewards of summer
As in a garden of the earth, let us learn to accept and appreciate the times when the trees are bare as well as the times when we pick the fruit
-  - Eve and Chance sit in silence on the patio
Eve's eyes are swollen, red, she has been crying
She turns to Chance, reaches out, touches his hand
(hesitates) 'm
(pause) 'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey
(pause) With us
So am , Eve
Allenby comes out the door, his mood is serious, professional
Eve turns quickly, awaits his news
(sits alongside Eve) Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben
(anxious) But he's
He's resting comfortably now
There's no cause for alarm, yet
Mrs
Aubrey comes out of the house
Mr
Gardiner,  have a telephone call for you
Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post
(not moving) Thank you
Would you care to take it, sir
Yes
Chance still does not move
Eve mistakes Chance's not moving for concern for herself
She puts a hand on his shoulder
'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs
Aubrey
(rising) Yes, Eve
You'll be all right
Chance follows Mrs
Aubrey into the house
Eve watches him go, then turns to Allenby
He's such a sensitive man, so considerate
-
'  - Mrs
Aubrey leads Chance to a phone at one of the desks
The three television sets are on, attract Chance's attention
(picks up phone, looks at TVs) Hello
- '  - , a Black man in his fifties, wears a rumpled wool jacket, smokes a pipe
Hello, Mr
Gardiner
This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post
-
'  / ' Hello, Sid
'm sorry to disturb you, Mr
Gardiner,  know you must be very busy
(looking from one  to the other) No
'm not busy
Then, 'll be brief
covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr
Rand, the President and yourself
The President is a nice person enjoyed it very much
Good, sir
And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh
What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation
think you should ask Mr
Rand that
Of course
But since he is ill 'm taking the liberty of asking you
Yes, that is correct
think you should ask Mr
Rand that
Courtney doesn't understand but continues his questioning
see
Then one more quick question, Mr
Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business
have nothing more to say
Chance hangs up the phone, watches the TVs
Courtney listens to the dial tone, then puts the receiver down
(to himself) Typical - no wonder he's so close to Rand
-  - Chance comes out of Mrs
Aubrey's office, notices the service elevator
Hmmm
Elevator
He gets in the elevator
- Chance looks at the row of buttons, presses one
He smiles as he feels the elevator move
-  - One of Mrs
Aubrey's secretaries, , waits with an arm load of paperwork for the elevator
The door opens, Chance smiles at her as he steps out
(surprised to see him) Why, hello, Mr
Gardiner - are you looking for someone
No
Jennifer gets in the elevator, the doors Close
Chance looks around the basement, puzzled
He had expected to be on the third floor
'  - Mrs
Aubrey is at her desk, buzzing her inter-house phone
As Jennifer enters, Mrs
Aubrey hangs up in frustration
can't find Mr
Gardiner anywhere
He's in the basement
What's he doing in the basement
don't know, Mrs
Aubrey
Mrs
Aubrey grabs a notepad, leaves the office
-  - Mrs
Aubrey comes out of the service elevator, hurries through the basement
She checks: The boiler room
The electrical room
The photographer's studio (Eve is sitting for a portrait) The gym (Allenby is working out) -    - Chance stands in the middle of the two-lane bowling alley, totally confused
Mrs
Aubrey enters, he smiles at her
Oh, Mr
Gardiner, 've been looking all over
Oh, yes
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called
Yes,  have seen that show on television
Of course
They would like you to appear on the show tonight
The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested
Yes
would like to be on that show
Fine
They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice
(Chance nods, there is a pause) Can  help you
Are you looking for something
No
like this attic very much
Mrs
Aubrey gives him a look, leaves
- 1 passes through the clouds
1 - The President sits on a couch in one of the compartments on the jet
Before him, stand six of his , Kaufman included
Gentlemen,  quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown
Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to
(interrupts) He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's
For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin
Yes, Mr
President, we attempted to contact Mr
Rand, but he was too ill to
(again interrupts) do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed
You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man
Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt
(he stands) 'll be in the office at seven in the morning and  would like to have it at that time
(he starts for door) 've got to take a leak
Right, Chief
As the President goes to the Men's Room, two of the aides reach for telephones
'  - Chance wears a velvet bathrobe, watches
Perkins lays out a suit, shirt, tie, etc
on the bed
believe these garments will be quite appropriate, Mr
Gardiner
(eyes on ) Yes
They are fine
There is a knock at the door
Excuse me, sir
Perkins answers the door, it is Eve
(entering) Chauncey
(rises) Hello, Eve
Chauncey,  just wanted to wish you well
know you'll be smashing
Thank you, Eve
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes
How is Ben feeling
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight
We'll both be watching
That's good
like to watch, too
know you do - you and your television
(a pause) Good luck, Chauncey
Eve impulsively steps forward, kisses Chance on the cheek
Chance smiles at her, and Eve, slightly embarrassed, turns and leaves the room
Chance sits back down, watches  as Perkins attends to his clothes with a whisk broom
-   - Courtney heads a meeting of his four staffers
One man, , a research assistant, sits behind a stack of paperwork, has a downcast expression as he listens to Courtney
Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact
The scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of First American
But before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background
(turns to Kinney) Kinney, what did you come up with
(after a pause) Nothing
(sighs, taps pencil on table) Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got
(another pause) realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner
We have no material on him - zilch
The room is quiet except for the tapping of Courtney's pencil
- The  1 limousine parks in front of the station
As Jeffrey opens the door for Chance,   steps to the limo
Mr
Gardiner, 'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening
' (as they shake hands) Hello, Morton
Hull takes Chance into the station
- '  - Constance, Rand's nurse, enters Chance's room, goes to the closet
-  - Chance is intrigued by the surroundings as Hull guides him through the corridor
Of course, Mr
Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis
see
Do you realize, Mr
Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years
Yes
It's a very good show
'm glad you like it, Mr
Gardiner
Hull takes Chance into the - room
- '  - Constance is in the closet, searching through Chance's pockets, finding nothing
She takes out a small knife, cuts a label from one of the jackets
Quickly, she examines one of Chance's shoes, copies the name of the shoemaker in a notebook
Constance hurries to the dresser, continues her search
- / , the makeup man, comes through the corridor carrying a glass of water
He turns into the makeup room, goes to Chance who sits in front of the lights
Hull sits next to Chance, briefs him on the show
Chance has his eyes on a  monitor, watches the guest preceding him on "This Evening
" (gives Chance water) Here you go, Mr
Gardiner
Thank you
'm very thirsty
Yes, sir - it's hot under those lights
Colson applies finishing touches to Chance
Now, if the host wants to ask you a question, he'll raise his left forefinger to his left eyebrow
(Chance watches ) Then you'll stop, and he'll say something, and then you'll answer
On the ,  , the host, wraps up his talk with his guest
(a last-minute dab) Okay, Mr
Gardiner, you're all set
Hull leads Chance out of the makeup room
Colson closes the door, then carefully picks up Chance's water glass, wraps it in Kleenex, puts it in his overcoat pocket
- " "  - William Dupont introduces Chance
Ladies and gentlemen, our very distinguished quest, Mr
Chauncey Gardiner
The  plays as Chance comes onto the stage
An audience of about three hundred applauds Chance as he appears
Two cameras move with him as he walks, with a smile and a limp, to center stage
Dupont shakes Chance's hand, Chance holds Dupont's hand with both of his own
(') Mr
Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening
Yes
(showing Chance to chair) 'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President
(sits) You're welcome
(also sitting) always find it surprising, Mr
Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown
Yes
That is surprising
(a beat) Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on
(doesn't understand) hope so
Yes
Of course, you know, Mr
Gardiner, that  always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests,  hope you don't object to that
No
don't object
Fine, then let's get started
The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy
Which view
Applause and laughter from the audience
Dupont accustomed to parrying with his guests, asks again
Come now, Mr
Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not
Yes
was there with Ben
know that, Mr
Gardiner
Yes
(a beat) Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow
Do you go along with this belief
Yes,  know the garden very well have worked in it all my life
It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons
The garden needs a lot of care
do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds
The audience applauds Chance's apparent metaphor
Dupont waits for it all to subside, then asks another question
'   - Rand is in bed
Eve sits in a chair next to the bed, squeezes Rand's hand in excitement as they both watch Chance on television
Teresa, the nurse, watches in the background
(over ) Well, Mr
Gardiner, that was very well put indeed, and  feel it was a booster for all of us who do not like to wallow in complaints or take delight in gloomy predictions
- '  - The President and First Lady are in bed together watching the show
Gloomy predictions
That insolent son of a bitch
(over ) Let's make it clear, Mr
Gardiner, it's your view that the collapse of the Stock Market, the dramatic increase in unemployment, you feel that this is just another season, so to speak, in the garden
The First Lady cuddles close the President, ruffles his hair, tries to cheer him up
- "  " - Chance answers
In a garden, things grow - but first some things must wither; some trees lose their leaves before they grow new leaves
- small, dark room
videotape machine is running
Also, a machine is turning that records the harmonics of Chance's voice
run the equipment, watch as a needle charts Chance's voice onto paper
(over ) Then they grow thicker and stronger and taller
Some trees die, but fresh saplings replace them
Gardens need a lot of care and a lot of love
'  - Franklin, the attorney that evicted Chance, comes out of the bathroom brushing his teeth
His wife, , is in bed absorbed in "This Evening
" Franklin sits on the end of the bed, watches the show
(over ) And if you give your garden a lot of love, and if you work very hard and have a lot of patience, in the proper season you will see it grow to be very beautiful
More applause from the
Franklin leans closer to the set
(puzzled) It's that gardener
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner
No
He's a real gardener
(laughs) He does talk like one, but  think he's brilliant
(over ) think your metaphors are quite interesting, Mr
Gardiner, but, haven't we seen seasons that have been devastating to certain countries
'  - The President and First Lady continue to watch
(over ) Such as disasterous winters, prolonged droughts that have wiped out crops, hurricanes that have all but swept away island communities
Doesn't a country need to have someone in charge that can see it through such crises
That bastard
The First Lady moves closer to him
'  - The , its volume low, plays in the background as Constance, with a pair of tweezers, plucks a hair from Chance's pillow, puts it into a small vial
(over ) Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons
The bad as well as the good
(over ) Yes
We need a very good gardener
- Dupont continues his questions
Do you feel that we have a 'Very good gardener' in office at this time, Mr
Gardiner
At the end of the question, Dupont glances over Chance's shoulder to look at the monitor
(a beat) understand
Chance turns to see what Dupont is looking at, sees the back of his own head on the  screen
realize that might be a difficult question for you, Mr
Gardiner - but there are a lot of us around the country that would like to hear your thoughts on the matter
Chance is still turned to the monitor
Oh, yes
It is possible for one side of the garden to be flooded, and the other side to be dry
- '  - Allenby watches Chance on television
The camera that covered Dupont in close-up has now pulled back, includes Dupont and Chance, both looking into camera
Allenby is concerned, he is unsure of Chance
(over ) Some plants do well in the sun, and others grow better in the cool of the shade
- group of    sit in the lobby, watch "This Evening" on an old black-and-white
(over ) It is the gardener's responsibility to take water from the flooded area and run it to the area that is dry
It is the gardener's responsibility not to plant a sun-loving flower in the shade of a high wall
During the preceding speech, Louise, the maid from the Old Man's house, chatters
Gobbledegook
All the time he talked gobbledegook
An' it's for sure a White man's world in America, hell,  raised that boy since he was the size of a pissant an' 'll say right now he never learned to read an' write - no sir
Had no brains at all, was stuffed with rice puddin' between the ears
Shortchanged by the Lord and dumb as a jackass an' look at him now
Yes, sir - all you gotta be is white in America an' you get whatever you want
Just listen to that boy - gobbledegook
There is a chorus of "Amens" as she finishes
- Chance continues
It is the responsibility of the gardener to adjust to the bad seasons as well as enjoy the good ones
If the gardener does his job, everything will be fine
'   - Audience applause is heard over
Rand claps weakly along with the  sound
Eve and Teresa also clap
(smiling) Splendid
Just splendid
Rand looks up as Constance comes into the room
(') Damn, Constance, get in here
You shouldn't miss any of this
Constance hurries to Teresa's side
Rand turns to Eve
(') 'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached
(Eve smiles) And so are you, aren't you, Eve
(a beat) Yes,  am, Ben
(reaches out, takes her hand) That's good
That's good
(over ) Well, Mr
Gardiner, from the sound of our audience, 'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others
(over ) Thank you
- Dupont asks another question
'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, 'd like to ask one final question
What sort of gardener, sir, would you be
(with confidence) am a very serious gardener
'  - More applause over the
The President pales
Oh, Jesus
He rolls over in bed
The First Lady reaches out, puts a comforting hand on his shoulder
'  - Franklin holds a phone to his ear with one hand, shuts off the  with the other
Okay, 'll see you in twenty minutes
Franklin hangs up the phone, scurries around getting dressed
His wife, Johanna, sits grimly in bed
(coldly) Business, bullshit
Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney
've got to talk to her about this Gardiner
(turns over in bed) Good night
Look, Johanna
(cuts him off) said good night
Franklin gives up, hurries from the room
-  - Colson, carefully carrying his overcoat, walks with Chance through the corridor
delighted Hull walks behind them
Marvelous
Just marvelous, Mr
Gardiner
What spirit you have, what confidence
Exactly what this country needs
Chance smiles at well-wishers as they continue on through the corridor
'  - The First Lady is snuggled up close to the President, caresses his body
After a moment, it becomes clear to her that he is not up to the occasion
Darling
What's wrong
, can't
just can't right now
'm sorry, dearest
just can't
The First Lady looks at him for a beat, then turns, lies on her back and stares at the ceiling
- An 'in' meeting place for the upper-middle Washington,
crowd
Thomas Franklin and Sally Hayes sit at a table, drinks in front of them
It didn't make any sense to me at all
didn't know what the hell he was talking about
He wasn't making a speech to us, Tom - he was talking to the masses
He was very clever, keeping it at a third grade level - that's what they understand
Yeah
Well,  don't understand what was up his sleeve when he pulled that stunt with us
What was he doing
And why
Who knows
Maybe the government had something to do with it
You know, Sally -  really feel like 've been had, and you know what that means, don't you
It means that any political future had is right down the toilet
The  begins to slowly move away from the table, the sound of Franklin's voice continues
(') Jesus, the thought of spending the rest of my life as an attorney, that is really a downer
And, Christ, Sally,  almost forgot Johanna is starting to think something's going on between
Franklin's voice fades into the background hubbub
The voice of Kinney, the research assistant from the Washington Post is heard as the camera settles on a table occupied by Sidney Courtney and his staff
Sid, be reasonable - 've been everywhere, there's no place left to check
Try again
Sure, try again - where
There's nothing, it's like he never existed
Try again
Sid, it's useless
said - try again
Kinney stands, shoves his paperwork across the table
Up yours, Sid
You try again, quit
Kinney takes his drink with him as he leaves the lounge
- The household staff is lined up on the front steps, applauding Chance as he steps from the limousine
Chance accepts the plaudit, though does not understand the reason
As he nears the steps, Perkins and Wilson step forward
An outstanding speech, sir
May  take your coat, Mr
Gardiner
Yes
Thank you, Perkins
Perkins nods, takes Chance's overcoat, allows everyone to enter the house ahead of him
Alone on the steps, Perkins quickly searches through the pockets of the coat, finds nothing
'   - Rand is in bed
Eve sits on the edge, looks warmly to Chance who stands nearby
Allenby prepares an injection for Rand, and occasionally glances curiously at Chance
Chance breathes deeply, enjoys the oxygen
(with some effort) You possess a great gift, Chauncey, of being natural
And that, my boy, is a rare talent, the true mark of a leader
You were strong and brave, yet did not moralize
hope the entire country was watching you tonight, the entire country
Allenby crosses to Rand, needle in hand
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me
Turn over, please
(holds up hand) In a minute, Robert - in a minute
Chauncey,  would like to ask a favor of you
Certainly, Ben
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union
think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve
Yes
would like to escort Eve
Good
Together, the two of you should create quite a stir -  can already hear the gossip
(with a blush) Ben, really
(reaches out a tired hand to Chance - Chance holds it) Thank you, Chauncey
Thank you very much
(takes back hand) All right, Robert, 'm all yours
Eve and Chance quietly leave the room
Allenby watches Chance go, then readies Rand for the injection
-    - The elevator door opens, Eve and Chance come into the hallway
Chance looks back at the elevator for a beat, then the two walk quietly down the hall
(stopping by bedroom door) You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you
No, thank you
Oh
Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night
Sophie insists an Black Tie
see
(a pause, softly) have very few friends, Chauncey
And Benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older
Eve gives Chance a long look, then kisses him on the lips
She steps back, smiles
(') Good night, Chauncey
Good night, Eve
Eve goes into her bedroom, closes the door
Chance heads for his room as though nothing had happened
-     - Kaufman and the five other Aides nervously await the President's arrival
The door opens, the President briskly enters the room
Good morning, gentlemen
(as one) Good morning, sir
The President leads the way into the Oval Office
- As the President goes to his desk, Kaufman hands him a folder
The President sits, reads it quickly, it is very brief
(to Kaufman) This is not what  requested
No, sir
This information goes back three days
want the standard file, you know that
Right, Chief
So
Where the hell is it
We
uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr
Rand's home
and, uh
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent
'd like to hear that data, Kaufman
Yes, sir
Kaufman takes a clipboard from the man at his right
(') (reading) Suits hand-made by a tailor in Chicago in 1918
The tailor went out of business in 1929, then took his own life
His shoes were hand-made in 1928
The cobbler has long since been dead
Underwear, all of the finest cloth, factory destroyed by fire in 1938
The man carries no identification; no wallet, no driver's license, no credit cards
He carries one item along with him, a fine Swiss pocket-watch crafted at the turn of the century; so far they have been unable to ascertain where or when purchase was made
He has never dyed his hair
Computers have analyzed Gardiner's vocal characteristics; it is impossible to determine his ethnic background, they feel his accent may be northeastern, but they will not commit to that
Fingerprint check proved negative, no identification possible
(a pause) That's it, Mr
President
The President stares at Kaufman for a beat, then speaks into his intercom
(into intercom) Miss Davis - 'd like my eggs poached this morning, please
quick "Yes sir" from Miss Davis over the intercom
The President leans back in his swivel chair, looks at Kaufman
(') So what does all that add up to
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power
But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity
We, uh
don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir
But we'll keep on top of it, Mr
President - we'll come up with the answer
(with sarcasm) would appreciate that
The Aides quickly leave the office
'  - Chance is in bed, a bed tray on his lap, eating breakfast pile of the morning's newspapers lies at the foot of the bed, untouched
The  is playing, Chance watches as he eats
There is a knock at the door
(without turning from ) Come in
Eve enters, wearing a robe over her nightgown
Chauncey
Have you seen the papers
No, Eve
don't read the papers
(moving to bed) Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech
And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's
like the President
He is a very nice man
(sits on bed) know
(a moment) So are you, Chauncey
(another moment, Chance watches ) Do you mind my being here, like this
(a bite of toast) No, Eve
like you to be here
Eve smiles, moves a little closer to Chance
You know, Chauncey
want us to be
(with difficulty) want us
You and  to become
close
want us to become very close, you know
Yes, Eve
know that
Eve suddenly begins to cry, sobbing quietly at first, then losing control, the tears flowing freely
To comfort her, Chance puts his arm around her shoulder, nearly tipping his breakfast tray
Eve responds to his touch, draws closer, holds Chance tightly
Chance does his best to avoid spilling his breakfast, keep an eye on the , and to comfort Eve
She gives in to her desires, begins to caress Chance, running her hand over his body
She kisses him, his eyes, his neck, his lips, his ears
Chance does not return the lovemaking, and Eve eventually catches hold of herself, stops
She lies quietly beside Chance for a time, regains her demeanor, then speaks
'm grateful to you, Chauncey
would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that
(Chance,confused, turns to her) But you're so strong -  can trust myself with you
'm glad, Chauncey - 'm glad that you showed so much restraint
Yes, Eve
'm very glad that you didn't open
know you are, Chauncey
(a pause) You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love
(another bite of toast) Yes
That could be true
(sits up) guess  may as well be honest about my feelings, Chauncey, as know you are  am in love with you
love you and  want you
And  know that you know it and 'm grateful that you've decided to wait until
Until
Eve cannot bring herself to finish the sentence
She rises, straightens her robe and moves toward the door
(') (stopping by door) do love you, Chauncey
knock at the door startles Eve
She turns, opens it to , the seam tress
Maggie carries one of Rand's tuxedos
(') Oh, come in, Maggie
(entering) Yes, ma'am
Chauncey, Maggie will alter Ben's tuxedo for you now
Fine
Eve leaves
Maggie stands by patiently as Chance eats his once-warm scrambled eggs and watches"Mr
Rogers Neighborhood" on
- '  - Allenby is at his desk, searching through the Washington, telephone book
He finds a number, dials
(into phone) Mr
Thomas Franklin, please
(a wait) Is Thomas Franklin in
(a beat) Yes, this is Dr
Robert Allenby, would you please tell Mr
Franklin that  would like to talk to him
It concerns Chauncey Gardiner
'   - Teresa and Constance work in a corner of the room
Rand is in bed, very still, deep in thought
' - The  1 limousine pulls up to Sophie's house
Jeffrey opens the door for Eve and Chance
He wears Ben's tuxedo, Eve is in a formal gown
The press is waiting, a couple of reporters, 5 photographers and a mini-cam crew from local station gather around Eve and Chance
#1 Mr
Gardiner, what did you think of the Post's editorial on the President's speech
(smiling for photogs) didn't read it
#2 (surprised) But air - you must have at least glanced at it
No
did not glance at it
#3 Mr
Gardiner, the New York Times spoke of your 'Peculiar brand of optimism,' what was your reaction to that
(continues to pose for pictures) did not read that either
#3 Well, how do you feel about that phrase, 'Peculiar brand of optimism
' do not know what it means
#2 Sorry to persist, air, but it would be of great interest to me to know what newspapers you do read
do not read any newspapers watch
There is a moment of silence as the reporters digest this
The  Reporter smiles, questions Chance
Do you mean, Mr
Gardiner, that you find television's coverage of the news superior to that of the newspapers
(flatly) like to watch
(pleased) ) Thank you, Mr
Gardiner, for what is probably the most honest admission to come from a public figure in years
Few men in public life have the courage not to read newspapers none have the guts to admit it
You're welcome
Eve and Chance walk toward the front door, leaving the newsmen to talk among themselves
've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey
You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it
Thank you, Eve
The front door is opened for them by an attendant
' - The Black Tie reception is in progress
The house is crowded, possibly a hundred guests, mostly foreign ambassadors and other such dignitaries
Eve and Chance enter, are greeted by , a State Department official
Mrs
Rand, how good to see you
Mr
Watson
(looks to Chance) And you must be Mr
Gardiner, correct
Yes
Chauncey, this is Mr
Dennis Watson of the State Department
(they shake) Hello, Dennis
pleasure to meet you, sir
Yes
It is
, an older woman bedecked with jewelry, approaches, embraces Eve
Eve, child
How nice of you to come
Hello, Sophie
Sophie steps back, looks at Chance
And look who you brought with
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner
(hugs Chance) Oh, 've been just dying to meet you, Mr
Gardiner
Chauncey, this is Mrs
Sophia Rowley
(being hugged) Hello, Sophia
(steps back, admires Chance) Sophie, please - call me Sophie
Sophie pulls them both into the party, leaving Dennis looking after Chance as he walks away
(') (as they go, to Chance) You just have to let me introduce you to some of the exciting people here
Why, Pat Boone and his daughter may drop by later
They disappear into the crowd
-   - The President is hunched over his desk, absorbed in constructing a model airplane, a World War  flying fortress bomber
The First Lady sits nearby, plays solitaire on a small table
The President glances to her, then back to his work
(gluing the wing) How are the kids getting along
Oh
Well,  just talked to Cindy this morning
She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag
'  guess she wants her privacy
Huh
'm glad they're along with her, if you know what  mean
How about Jack
Well,  think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling
He's getting to that age, you know
He really misses you
Yeah
'll have a talk with him as soon as
at the door interrupts the President
(') (calls out) Yes, come in
Kaufman enters
Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments
Oh
What
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background
So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time
Good
Anything else
Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance
We're around-the clock now, sir - 'll keep you posted
The President nods, Kaufman leaves
The President puts some more glue on the wing
' - Sophie pulls Eve and Chance to   and his Skrapinov smiles as he sees Eve
Mrs
Rand
How delightful
Skrapinov kisses Eve's hand
It seems like ages, Mr
Ambassador
(a nod to his wife) Mrs
Skrapinov
Mrs
Skrapinov returns the nod as Sophie introduces Chance
Mr
Gardiner, let me introduce you to our guest of honor, His Excellency Vladimar Skrapinov, Ambassador of the Soviet Union
Chance warmly shakes Skrapinov's hand with both of his own
(stumbles over name) Hello
His
His
Ambassador Skrapinov, this is Mr
Chauncey Gardiner
Delighted
Delighted
And this is Mrs
Skrapinov
Chance smiles at Mrs
Skrapinov as The Ambassador puts an arm around him
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss
agree
(to Eve) How is my dear friend Benjamin feeling
He's doing as well as could be expected, Mr
Ambassador
He still speaks of the stimulating discussions he's had with you
Ah, Yes
Please give him my regards
Of course
(tugs at Eve) Come on, Eve
Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you
(to Chance and Skrapinov) Would you two excuse me for a moment
Regretfully, Mrs
Rand -  shall yield the pleasure of your company to others
Yes, Eve
shall yield too
(smiling) 'll be back soon
Eve and Sophie leave
Skrapinov leads his wife and Chance to their table
(as they walk) 'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr
Gardiner
had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and  listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy
'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President
(quietly) Tell me, Mr
Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness did not want to upset Mrs
Rand by discussing it in detail
Ben is very ill
Yes, so 've heard, a shame
As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation
We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover
(arrive at table) Be seated, please, Mr
Gardiner
Chance sits between Skrapinov and Mrs
Skrapinov
(') (moves chair close to Chance) Mr
Gardiner,  wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often
Yes,  agree,  think so too
To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business
On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy
Yes,  understand
And  have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together
An interchange of opinion
We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far
(an engaging smile) We are not far
(motions at nearness of their chairs) our chairs almost touch
(laughs) Bravo
Bravo
Our chairs are indeed almost touching
And we want to remain seated on them, correct
We don't want them snatched from under us, am  right
Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom
Boom
And we are both down before our time, you see
And neither of us wants that, do you agree
certainly do
Yes
Tell me, Mr
Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables
ask this because there is something
there is something Krylovian about you
Do you think so
Do you think so
So you know Krylov
Skrapinov pauses, then leans close to Chance, speaks softly in Russian
Chance, having never heard this language, raises his eyebrows and laughs
Mrs
Skrapinov remains impassive
(') (amazed) So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you
Mr
Gardiner,  must confess  had suspected as much all along -  know an educated man when meet one
Oh, good
Yes, it is very good
Yes, it is
(beat) Would you tell me your name again, please
(slaps Chance on the back) Ho
Ho
dash of American humor
Vladimar Skrapinov
Yes
like that name very much
And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner
(in Russian) How poetic
Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning
And Gardiner, a bit of the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers beautiful name, my friend
As he speaks in Russian, Eve comes to the table, taps Skrapinov on the shoulder
(') (immediately rises) Mrs
Rand
You have returned to us
Only to steal Mr
Gardiner away, if might
(to Chance) Everyone wants to meet you
Yes, Eve
That would be good
(shakes Chance's hand) We must speak again, Mr
Gardiner, many times
Thank you
As Eve and Chance leave, Skrapinov turns and nods to a standing a short distance away
The man, , hurries to the table
Yes
What have you found
(in Russian) We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov
(holds up hand, looks around) Quietly, please
Mr
Gardiner, for one, understands our language
(in English, softly) Sorry, Comrade Ambassador
What do you mean there is nothing
That's impossible
There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's
It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government
Mrs
Skrapinov strains to overhear the conversation
But
Where was this man Gardiner before last week
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the
nor the
has met with success
see
Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance
Clearly, yes comrade
Hmmm
Take this down
(Karpatov takes out notepad) want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes
"' Very good, Your Excellency
Karpatov leaves the table
,
- The same lounge as before
Sidney Courtney sits at the same table as earlier, only this time with the editor of the Washington Post,
Courtney puffs on his pipe as he speaks
It's strictly rumor at this stage, Lyman - just something in the wind
Something rather big in the wind, 'd say
So whose files were destroyed
The 's or the 's
don't know
Like  said, it's just rumor so far, but we should start nosing around, see if we can talk to some people
The  begins to slowly   from their table
But why
The question is why
Why would they destroy Gardiner's files
What is it about his past they are trying to cover up
(his voice fades) criminal record
membership in a subversive organization
Homosexual, perhaps
The  of Stuart's voice dissolves into Thomas Franklin's as the   on Dr
Allenby and Franklin sitting at a table nearby
And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener
He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and
Well,  didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act
have no idea
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased
Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions
Hmmm
You say he showed you his garden
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it
see
(leans close to Franklin) Mr
Franklin,  must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr
Gardiner to yourselves
There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential
So please, not a word
Of course, Doctor,  understand
Fine
Thank you, Mr
Franklin
Certainly, glad to be of help
Allenby rises, leaves the bar
'  -   - Eve and Sophie are talking to a small group
Chance moves away to get an hors d'oeuvre and is approached by , a publisher
Mr
Gardiner, 'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books
(a two-handed handshake) Hello, Ronald
Mr
Gardiner, my editors and  have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us
Something on your political philosophy
What do you say
can't write
(smiles) Of course, who can nowadays
have trouble writing a post card to my children
Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers
can't read
Of course not
No one has the time to read
One glances at things, watches television
Yes
like to watch
Sure you do
No one reads
Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days
(mild interest) What sort of bed is it
'   - Rand is in bed
Sitting nearby are two attorneys,  and Mrs
Aubrey stands to one side and Constance and Teresa prepare an  for Rand
(speaks slowly, with effort) Everything
said everything and that's exactly what  mean
But, Mr
Rand, the holdings are so extensive,  would like to be more precise in
(interrupts) What could be more precise than everything
Allenby enters the room, stands by the door, unnoticed
(turns to Townsend) Everything to Mrs
Rand
(drafting a will) Right - everything
You two don't have to lecture me on the complexities of the situation, no one knows that better than myself
But you must understand that  have an endless faith in Mrs
Rand's abilities -  know that she will select the right person for guidance when she has the need
She has shared my life, gentlemen, she has given me far more pleasure than any of my so called assets
Life has suddenly become very simple for me now - may be older than my years, and you might think me to be somewhat feeble
But  am still in love, gentlemen, thank God for that
Allenby silently leaves the room
'  -   - Dennis Watson, of the State Department, talks with Chance in a corner of the living room
Dennis whispers something into Chance's ear and Chance gives him an innocent smile
Dennis is encouraged by the smile
We could do it now, we can go upstairs
(no reaction from Chance) Please, it's time for us
Come upstairs
(blankly) like to watch
Watch
You mean just watch me
Doing it alone
Yes
like to watch very much
Well, if that's what you want, then want it too
(takes Chance's arm) We can go this way
want to tell Eve
Tell Eve
You mean Mrs
Rand
Yes
(pulling Chance) Oh, you can tell her later
She'll never miss you in this crowd
Dennis leads Chance out of the crowded room
- '  - light from the adjoining bathroom filters into the darkened bedroom
The President and the First Lady are in bed
They each lie on their backs, a distance apart and are silent
(after some time) Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling
No, that won't do any good
(another pause) Is it me
Is there something 've done
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you
(another pause) It's your damn job
It never happened when you were a senator
It's not that,  just
The inter-White House phone rings, the President reaches for it
(') (into phone) Yeah, Kaufman - what is it
' (over phone) Chief, we have a break in the case
Our man at the Washington Post says they are working on a story that either the  or the  destroyed Gardiner's files before anyone could get to them
What
Why
' (over phone) can't say at this time - neither agency will admit to a thing
(getting out of bed) Okay, get both Directors over here, 'll be right down
The President hangs up the phone as the First Lady stares at the ceiling
'  -   - small room exquisitely decorated in pale lilac tapestry
The lights are very dim, and Dennis, who we cannot see, is lying on the floor
Dennis' clothes are draped over a chair
Chance sees a very small pocket television on a desk
He turns the  on
' (softly) Can you see well
(squints at small screen) Yes, very well, thank you
' Do you like it
Yes
It's very tiny, but it's good
' (disappointed at it being 'tiny') Are you sure you like it
Yes,  do, it's very good
' (excited) Really
Really
Chance reacts to the change in tone of Dennis' voice, turns to look at him on the floor
Hearing the groans and heavy breathing, Chance thinks Dennis is ill
Do you need a doctor
could call Robert
' don't want Robert
see
' (through the groans) Your foot
Give me your foot
Dennis reaches out with his free hand, grabs Chance's foot, pulls it to himself
(some pain) Thank you
But my leg is still a little sore
Chance watches as Dennis goes through some spasms, then his body relaxes
Chance is concerned for Dennis' health
(') Are you sure you're not ill
We hear a contented sigh from the man on the floor
' - long, black limousine with a Red Star on the door pulls away from Sophie's house
- , a high-ranking  officer, and two of his underlings are in the limousine, along with Skrapinov, his wife and Karpatov
Novogrod and his men wear heavy clothing, fresh from Moscow
They all drink vodka
(Dialogue in Russian, English subtitles) The rank-and-file in the  feel he is , but others feel he is a man who knows how to destroy files
That could be possible
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat
coup d'etat
Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov
We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government
Big business
could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship
Thank you, Colonel
(raising his glass) Let us toast to the success of the coup
They all raise their glasses
Na zdorov'e
The men and Mrs
Skrapinov drink their vodkas
'  - The reception is breaking up
Eve, wearing her coat, searches for Chance in the crowd
She sees him, taps him on the shoulder from behind
Chauncey, where have you been was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman
No
was with a man
We went upstairs
Upstairs
Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion
He was very ill,  stayed with him for a while
It must be the punch, and it is stuffy in here --  feel it a little myself
You're an angel, my dear - thank God there are still men like you around to give aid and comfort
Eve and Chance leave the reception
-   - The President sits behind his desk in a bathrobe, his hair mussed
Standing before him are  , the Director of the
, and  ,
Chief
Kaufman stands to one side
All are red-eyed, tired, and frustrated
never gave such a directive, Mr
President
Nor , sir - it would be out of the question
Gentlemen,  didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations,  just want to explore the possibilities
Now,  have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent
Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient
Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed
Now, 'd like some answers
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man
We can rule that out
Very well
Can we rule out inefficiency
There is silence in the room
couple of looks, but silence
(') see
What about question three
Is it possible to erase all traces of a man
Highly unlikely, sir
In fact, the boys around the Bureau feel that the only person capable of pulling it off would be an ex man
(a look to Honeycutt) don't think that's entirely true, Grover
(to Baldwin) And what do the boys around Intelligence think
Well, Mr
President
They don't quite know what to think
(rising) Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations
(goes to door) Good night
The President leaves the Oval Office
-    - Eve and Chance walk down the hallway
(holding his hand) feel so close to you, so safe with you, Chauncey
(stops at her bedroom door) And Benjamin understands that, dearest
He understands and accepts my feelings for you
Yes, Eve
Ben is very wise
(opens her door) Come in, Chauncey - please come in
Thank you
Chance enters, Eve closes the door behind them
'  - Eve turns on a soft lamp, Chance goes directly to her , turns it on
can sense that you've been through a lot, Chauncey
But one day, when you feel like it, you'll tell me all about your life
(Chance watches an old movie) But, even if you tell me nothing, even if it's too painful for you to reveal your past
As she talks, Chance watches a love scene on
The hero gives his lady a passionate kiss and embrace
The scene seems to 'sink into' Chance's mind
He abruptly turns, takes Eve into his arms and kisses her full on the mouth
Just as abruptly, he turns away and changes channels on
(breathless) Oh, Chauncey
do love you so much
She takes Chance in her arms, kisses him wildly
They fall to her bed in an embrace
As she holds him, kisses him, runs her hands over his body, Chance watches television, neither resists nor responds to Eve's caresses
Suddenly she stops, lets her head fall on Chance's chest
(') You don't want me, Chauncey
You don't feel anything for me
Nothing at all
Chance sits up on the bed, then, feeling her sadness, gently strokes her hair as he looks at
(') just don't excite you at all don't know what you want
don't know what you like
like to watch
(not understanding) To watch
To watch me
Yes
like to watch
(uncertain) Is that all you want
(a hesitation) To watch me
Yes
It's very good, Eve
But 've never done
(another hesitation) You mean
When
When
When  do it
When  touch myself
Eve slowly gets up from the bed, nervously paces the bedroom as Chance watches
She makes a decision, moves to Chance, kisses him
(') (getting aroused) Oh, Chauncey
She steps back, slips off her dress
She does not undress any further, instead, leans close to Chance
(') One of those little things you don't know about me yet, darling - 'm a little shy
She smiles, gets in bed and pulls the covers over herself
Chance divides his attention between Eve and the , watching both with an equal detachment
Eve begins to respond to her own touch, finds a heretofore undiscovered pleasure with her own body
Chance changes the channel as she reaches orgasm
As Eve's body trembles, Chance yawns, gets up from the bed
(going to door) Good night, Eve
low purr is heard from Eve as Chance leaves
'   - Allenby, Constance and Teresa are readying a transfusion for Rand
There is a feeling of urgency as they work
Rand, very weak, strains to speak to Allenby
No more, Robert
No more needles
(sits on the side of the bed) It's not good, Ben - 'm sure you can feel it
know, Robert
But, strangely enough,  don't feel too bad about now
feel all right
guess it's easier
knowing Chauncey is here
to take care of things
Teresa is about to swab Rand's arm with alcohol but he pulls away
(') No,  don't want any of that
Please
please, just get me Mr
Gardiner, Teresa - please
he'll head it up
Teresa looks to Allenby, he nods to her
Teresa puts the cotton down, leaves the room
-  - light snow is failing
Eve is in a fur coat, holds a steaming cup of coffee
Chance stands next to her, an umbrella in one hand
He holds his other arm out, catching the snowflakes as they fall
And  feel so free now, Chauncey
Until  met you,  never felt acknowledged by a man
(Chance gazes out at the falling snow) always had the feeling that was just a vessel for a man, someone that he could take hold of, pierce, and pollute
was merely an aspect of somebody's lovemaking
Do you know what  mean
Chance turns to her, says nothing, presses the cold snowflakes to his face
(') (presses close to him) Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it
You set me free
reveal myself to myself and  am drenched and purged
That's very interesting, Eve
Teresa appears in the doorway
Mr
Gardiner
Mr
Rand would like to see you
Yes
would like to see Ben
Chance gives Eve a warm smile, then follows Teresa into the house
'   - Allenby, with nothing more he can do to prolong Rand's life, sits on the bed close to him, grips his hand tightly
Teresa shows Chance into the room and Allenby motions to the nurses to leave
As they do, Chance, once again breathing the oxygen with a smile, goes to Rand's bedside
(slowly) Chauncey
Chauncey
Yes, Ben - are you going to die now
Allenby winces
(a weak smile) 'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy
Oh,  see
(reaches out to him) Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey
Let me feel your strength
(holds Chance's hand) Yes, that's good
hope, Chauncey -  hope that you'll stay with Eve
Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey
(smiling) flower
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey
there's much to be looked after
Yes
would like to do that
've worked very hard and enjoyed my life
've known success
and 've felt love
My associates, Chauncey - 've talked with them about you
They're eager to meet you
very eager to meet you
'm very fond of you, Chauncey
And  understand Eve
Tell her that
tell her 'm madly in love with her
Rand slumps down, dead
Allenby checks his pulse, turns to Chance
He's gone, Chauncey
Yes, Robert
have seen it before
It happens to old people
(covers Rand's face) Yes,  suppose that's true
Chance reaches out, uncovers Rand's face, gently touches the man's forehead, feels the coldness
Allenby eyes him as Chance stays with Rand for a moment, then replaces the sheet
(turns to Allenby) Will you be leaving now, Robert
In a day or two, yes
Eve is going to stay
The house will not be closed
(a moment, a look) You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr
(a beat) Chance
Yes
love Eve very much
see
(another beat) And you are really a gardener, aren't you
(brightens) Yes, Robert -  am
(a smile at Allenby) 'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert
Chance leaves the bedroom
Allenby watches him go, then sits back in a chair, his head spinning
- cloudy, cold day patches of snow are on the ground
The Rand servants are lined up in front of the mansion, listen to funeral services for Rand on a pair of loudspeakers , reveal the services being held on a hill overlooking the mansion
Fifty mourners are gathered around the Rand family mausoleum
Chance stands with Eve and Allenby
The President of the United States stands before a microphone
Millions of people across the world have heard of the passing of Benjamin Rand; but, unfortunately, only relatively few will feel the pain and sadness at such a loss
To most, Benjamin Rand was a legend; to those of us gathered here today, Benjamin was a beloved friend
My personal association with Benjamin dates back many years, and my memories of our friendship will stay with me forever
As the President speaks, Chance turns and walks away
Eve and Allenby watch as he goes into the trees surrounding the area
(') initially came in contact with the Rand name in 1943
1 was a young lieutenant in the Air Corps, a navigator flying missions over Europe
That plane that  learned to know so well was manufactured by the Rand Aeronautics Corporation
(a beat) Benjamin Rand was an industrial giant, known to be powerful and uncompromising, and yet, on a personal level, we have all felt his warmth and humor
(a beat) would like to share with you a few quotes, and a few feelings from our dear friend
(holds up paper, reads) ' do not regret having political differences with men that respect;  do regret, however, that our philosophies kept us apart
' ' have no use for those on welfare, no patience whatsoever
But, if  am to be honest with myself,  must admit that they have no use for me, either
' ' was born into a position of extreme wealth,  have spent many sleepless nights thinking about extreme poverty -   do not know the feelings of being poor, and that is not to know the feelings of the majority of people in this world
For a man in my position, that is inexcusable
' 'Life is a state of mind
' 'When  was a boy,  was told that the Lord fashioned us from his own image
That's when  decided to manufacture mirrors
' - Ah auditorium with row upon row of empty seats
Huddled together at one end of the hall are six important businessmen, speaking in hushed tones
, a powerful industrialist, speaks
But what do we know of the man
Nothing
We have no inkling of his past
, a corporation chairman, joins in
Correct, and that is an asset man's past can cripple him, his background turns into a swamp and invites scrutiny
Another executive,  , agrees
To this time, he hasn't said anything that could be used against him
, a Texas oil millionaire; Well, 'm certainly open to the thought - it would be sheer lunacy to support the President for another term
No one will go along with that
Look at the facts, gentlemen, the response from his appearance on 'This Evening' was overwhelming; he has excited and awakened the people of this country at a time of despair
, a banker; He's personable, elusive, yet seemingly honest
He's riding a crest of popularity that builds with every statement
As far as his thinking goes, he appears to be one of us
firmly believe, gentlemen, that he is our only chance - Mr
Chauncey Gardiner
- Chance, his umbrella under his arm, walks through the woods
'  - The services are over
Eve, Allenby talk with the President and the First Lady
It was very moving, Bobby - thank you so much
We're all going to miss him, Eve
(glances around) Where's Mr
Gardiner
He walked off
Chauncey is so sensitive
He was overcome with grief
can certainly understand that
Of course
'm so sorry for you, Eve
Thank you, Nancy
'll call you soon
The President and First Lady head toward their limousine
- Chance walks deeper into the woods, absorbed in the greenery
He stops by a tree, brushes some snow from a branch, moves on
'  - The majority of mourners have left
Eve and Allenby walk slowly to the  1 limousine, look around for Chance
Do you think we should look for him
don't think so, he should be along soon
wish he were here
Eve keeps looking as they walk to the limousine
- Chance happens on a tree with a cracked limb, hanging to the ground
He stops, inspects the break, runs his fingers along the split in the bark
He looks to the ground, notices that an end of the limb has fallen on a seedling, bending it double
Chance pulls the limb away, then kneels beside the seedling
He removes an expensive paid of suede gloves, and, with gentle fingers, brushes the dirt and snow away from the seedling
Chance glances up to the remaining limbs of the larger tree which could fall and threaten the emerging tree
He unfolds his umbrella, places it over the seedling in a way to give it protection, yet to still allow it to receive light from the winter sun
Chance stands, puts his gloves back on and continues his walk, disappearing into a remote section of the woods
'  - Jeffrey stands holding the door for Eve and Allenby, all the other cars have gone
Eve is worried, gets into the car
- Chance walks through the woods, his pace faster than before
'  - The limousine still waits for Chance
- Eve is deeply concerned for Chance
We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him
You really care for him, don't you, Eve
do - we do - both of us, Ben and feel so much for Chauncey
think we'd better go look for him
(he taps on the glass partition) David
David starts up the limousine
- Chance walks with determination through the woods
- Allenby and Eve search for Chance as David drives along a narrow road through the woods
Jeffrey, sitting in front, suddenly calls out
Look
About 100 yards ahead of them, Chance crosses the road, continues on down a hill
There he is
Chauncey
David stops the limousine at the point where Chance crossed
Eve hurries out of the car
- Chance is about twenty yards down the side of a hill
Eve calls to him
Chauncey
Chauncey
(stops, looks up) Hello, Eve
Eve runs, half falls as she goes down the hill
Oh, Chauncey
She gets to him, holds him tightly
(') Oh, Chauncey, darling
Where have you been
We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over
Yes
've been looking for you, too, Eve
She hugs him one more time, then she leads him back up the hill to the waiting limousine
Allenby gets out of the car, greets Chance with a handshake and an arm around the shoulder
Then the three get into the limousine
