We hear   and Then we read: 1959 : : - walks along the dimly lit basement
Heavy wiatei coats hang from hooks on the wall
In the b
g
, there is constant traffic of pecple coming and going from the rest rooms
From above we hear the  SOtJV Fenwick is in his early 20s and dressed in the " " style of the late fifties
Sports jacket, button- down shirt, chino pants, and Bass weejuns
We sense that he is a little lost in himself, confused
He looks out one of the windows that views the parking lot
Then without any outward anger, he punches his fist through a window pane
Seconds later he breaks another window with his fist
Fenwick, picking up the music beat from above, struts to the sound as he approaches another bank of windows
He calmly breaks another window pane with
his fist
coming out of the bathroom in the b
g
sees Fenwick's actions and then heads up the steps
: - The crowd is gathered around the bandstand listening to the local group, the   , playing their popular hit The song is played toward the end of the even- ing because of its risque Lyrics
Hot nuts, hot nuts, get from the peanut man
(' ) Hot nuts hot nuts, get em any - way you can
As the crowd swings the verse back to the Band Leader
The Guy who spotted Fenwick breaking windows approaches Boogie is something of a "Dandy," flashiar in dress than others in his crowd
Although he isn't particularly good looking there is something about his attitude that is very appealing to girls
Boogie aster hearing the Guy heads downstairs
- Fenwick casually breaks another window with his fist
His hand is bleeding
Boogie approaches
What's up, Fen
Just breaking windows, Boog - What for
It's a smile
He breaks another window with his fist
' mon, don't be a sWuck
know that glass is made from sand, but how come you can see through it
He breaks another window
Boogie grabs him
Leave the windows alone
What's the matter with you
It's a smile, that's all
'm cracking up
() 'm warning
you, Fen, break another window and you're gonna get a fat lip
He lets Fenwick go
() Where's your date
Gave her away
What
Gave her away
David Glazer said she was death
So,  said if you like the way she looks, take her
What are you, the Salvation Any
Charged him five bucks

They walk away () Ycu really are nuts, you know that

CAP_7RA    who is in a corner with one foot up on a chair
He smokes a cigarette and taps his foot _ lightly to the music
Eddie takes Sinatra very seriously
ShBEVI ; approaches Eddie
Where's Elyse
Talking with your wife about the fucking wedding plans
Gettin' cold feet
They've never been warn
Boogie is talking with , the young eleventh grader that Fenwick had the falling out with
She is an attractive petite girl with large breasts
How can you take Glazer over the Fen
'Cause

That's the kinda guy he is
(C0NTINL_D) tD :

Diane is in the car
Fenwick is telling her scnething and she laughs Boogie and ; t, follow
Behind them, Shrevie and his wife BETh follow in a 1950 Hudson Hornet
Fenwick floors his car and disappears around a bend
The other cars do not keep pace'
' Elyse feels that Eddie is getting very sensitive about the wedding
k:_ow
We were talking about it
() : _ _ _ _ She thinks that since he never talked it over with Billy beforehand, it kind of bothers him even more
The closest of the close
You t-_
ow Billy's flying in this morning
didn't hear about it
Thought he was just coming in for the wedding day
We didn't want to mention it
Surprise for Eddie
Shrevie's car follows in the taillights of Boogie's car
Fenwick's car is nowhere in sight
Elyse's mother is very upset with Eddie
They picked out a yellow and white motif for the wedding
You know, like we did, tablecloth, napkins, maids-,of-honor
Anyway, Eddie objected
He wanted blue and white because that's The Colts' colors
Refused to give in
SHREV7E Yeah, so
Well, you know how stubborn Eddie is
SHP_- Could be worse
It could be black and gold
Steelers' colors
Shrevie notices Boogie's taillights come or
He slows down
Something is wrong up ahead

The headlights of the car shine brightly against a tree

t's
ficult to see exactly what has happeried
Jn the darkness of the road
Boogie, Modell, Shrevie and Beta exit the cars and walk toward the accident
As they approach we see Fe_zwick lying halfway out of the car covered in blood
Diane cannot be seen
( ) Stay here
The three guys move apprehensively toward the car
Fenwick's face is covered in'blood, so touch so that it-can hardly be recognized
(-,
eac ting to the sight of Fenwick's ) Oh Jesus
Boogie kaeels nest to Fenwick
-After a beat,
Fenwick explodes with laughter
You son-cf-a-bitch
Fenwick screams in laughter
() You asshole
Then Boogie laughs
The rest of the guys join in
Not Bech
She is not acused
Fenwick crawls cut of the Triumph
:-
{ really got you guys, didn't
Didn't
Been carrying a ketchup bottle around for weeks
Diane steps out of the woods
She laughs nervously

Boogie starts back to his car
The others fe] low
enwick pleads with them
Boogie with his back to Fen -wick is amused, delighted that he's got Fenwick or
a nu:rber
(with the authority of a school teacher) Fenwick, you to ed that car over
You must put it upright yourself
You need some discipline in your life

Shravie starts his car
' ' You guys t eal ly are sick, you n k ow that
That's 'cause you got no sense of humor
He pulls away
Sr (; out the window) See you guys later at the dine=
: Exi
- - The diner is one of the typical late S0's metal and glass structures
Almost deco in design
Cars are parked in front, including Shrevie's Hudson Hornet
CAXR4 to a car parked over in a corner

Around one side, the aluinun siding ' guys in their 30s and 40s
Some    , only there on the waekends, and the, Boogie-
irevie c_cwd
(The guys in their early t,
enties
) One thing is quite apparent
There are no girls present, except =
h at is the unspoken rule
Eddie, Shrevie and Modell sit in a booth
They all eat french fries and gravy
You can't compare Mathis to Sinatra
No way
They're both great singers
Yeah, but you can't compare them
Sinatra is the lord
He's big in movies, everything
(`::) : If Mathis wasn't a blue, he'd be a big movie star
That's true
There's hardly any blues in movies
Just sidekicks
'mon, they could've put Mathis in 'From Here to Eternity
' They had blues in the war
' Mathis didn't come around until after that movie
Are you telling me Mathis could've played Maggio
Is that what 'm hearing
Who do you make-out to
Sinatra or Mathis
For that, Mathis
'm married
We don't Wake-cut
They laugh

He sits dcw-n and joins the guys
How'd it go

Fenwick nods
He sticks out his pinky
Eddie gabs it with his pinky
Therefore it's the truth

The guy's canvassing the neighborhood, and  notice he's stopping at the brick houses
He's trying to sell aluminun siding to the brick house owners
( ) Sure enough, he comes back to the car
He's got a lead
Fools rush in, right
To the guys, this type of story is fascinating

Billy, in his early 20s a:_d wears the typical button-down shirt, crew neck sweater, chino pants, and the Bass weejuns
He starts down the steps and heads toward the terminal

Not until she takes the test
Boog, what are you talking about
Eddie's going to give Eylse a football test
If she fails, the marriage is off
Are you shitting me
You know Eddie and the Colts
Very serious
The test has something like a hundred and forty questions
True and false, multiple choice, short answer
Oral cast
He doesn't want any cheati:,g
What happens if she fails
He's going to call
it off
Is that what  hear
( ) "i ' ; rte swears to 1

Elyse keeps delaying
Heavy pressure
Her plan could be, though, to stall until the last minute
Then if she falls, it doesn't matter
It's a fait accompli

Fait accompli, my ass
He walks

tell you, it was a real surprise
No call
Just a note
Why do you figure, all of a sudden

Elyse turns into -- - Iceland and Eddie's not the type to look elcev

When the Stripper does something they especially like they pound the table with tr
Le mallets
Billy and Eddie both have beers and chasers in front of then
Billy sips the chaser and his body actually shakes from it for a few seconds
There is no reason to actually like this, you know that
An acquired taste No matter-how long - drink- whiskey still don't like it
He takes another sip, and once again shakes
Then he sips the beer
() Now beer's another story

Remember the first time we became aware of breasts on girls
Arlene Stowe
Showed up for the new school year and there they were
Seventh grade
We gave little Joel Cher-- a nickel -apiece to find cut is they were real
Told him to be slnbcle
He walked over, reached uc and grabbed
::rned to us and yelled, 'They're real
' The whole thing with girls is painfu
And it keeps getting acre painful
instead of easier
Billy downs his beer and orders tT,o more
Remember 'copping a feel'
Boogie was the first
Said it was great
So, when  tcck out Ruth Ray figured  had to do it
Ruth Ray, eighth grade
: Right
Sat on the couch in her club cellar for hours, trying to figure out a way to get my arm arc:,tzid her
Finally,  learned the 'move
'  yawned and put my arm around her shoulder
He demonstrates on Eddie
- () Then came the big task of getting my hand down to her-breast
By the time  worked un the nerve to move down,  realized my arm was asleep
Figured out there wasn't enough time to take it back, ge6 the feeling again, acid start over
Had to be in by eleven
Time was running out
So,  move toward- the breast -with my arm - ----- asleep
My first copping a feel was like this
- He bangs his limp arm against Eddie's chest
He bps it again
() Next time  saw the guys they said, 'Did you cop a feel
' said, 'Yeah
' 'How was it
' 'Great
' Eddie laughs and Billy joins in

- - Bocgie pulls into te diner parking lot
Fenwick and Shrevie race over to the car
Boogie opens the door
17; Bong, you should get outta here
Tank's Inside
Boogie gets out of the car and slams the door shut
He looks coward the diner and thinks a moment
() : tiny Con ycu wait until he splits
He'll just keep looking for me
He starts toward the diner
() Hand's dealt
Might as well play the cards
The guys hang behind
Boogie continufts on
Inside the diner we see Tank moving along the aisle toward the door, Boogie heads for the door
Just as he reaches it, Tank steps outside
- Boag
' Tank
-- Lucky can
That so
Yeah
The Bagel just raid off your debt
Boogie looks at him, trying to size up the situation
Wcnderirg if he's r=ning a nurbey for scale reason
We're even
Straight
'hat's the story
Tank starts past Boogie
Tank tu :s
Boogie slams his fist into his stcWach
Tank drops to one knee in pain

: () still owed you that
He enters the diner
Fenwick and Shrevie are amazed by what just happened
: - Boogia approaches Bagel wL_o sits at a booth alone
He -- Thanks, Bagel

Then h,

() Your mother feels you're just wasting your t4---e in law school it's not for you
Probably right
Ccee to work for me
There's a lot of money to be made in the home improvement business
You'd be very good at it
Boogie thinks about it
Bagel chews on his bagel
Well,  was only really using law as a come=on for the girls
They like that
But, what the hell
( ) can always lie
The waitress passes
(CCNTIB3UED) 95
() Enid, some french fries and gravy
Call the two thousand an advance

for awhile
Then, 'll have to move on to bigger things
, Always a dreamer, eh, Boog
If you don't have good dreams, Bagel, you've got nightmares
He flashes him a smile

- Billy and' Eddie are still dri^king at the bar
They are not drunk, just ve-cy happy
'll tell you one chinz that happens when you get mcrried
You have to give up your old friends
Billy listens to the music, slapping his thighs, crying be get the band to pick up the beat
(  ) idle wi Fe wants you to get new friends
'Cause me and you have secrets she'll never know
And new friends can never be as good, 'cause we've got a history
It won't change, only if we let it
Billy keeps ,slapping his thighs, but the dr

'LcD : f nti- Yirg
This is getting me crazy
Billy goes toward the small stage
(
) () Come on, guyst Pick up the beat
They don't respond
Eddie sits at the bar amused
Billy claps his hands to a strong rhythm, but of course, the guys pay no attention
Billy goes up on the stage and pulls a cover off a small piano in the corner
He sits down and runs his fingers down the keyboard, then starts to play
It bas a nice, pleasant sound to it
The dr er and the saxophonist stop, not knowing what to do
The Stripper also stops
The club bouncer at the front door turns toward the stage, notices something is wrong and makes his way forward
Billy's "piano playing becomes more intense
Stronger
He drives the keys hard
Full tilt rock ane roll
The sound becomes infectious
The sailors and other customers pick up the beat
One after another they start to pound the tables with the wooden mallets
Eddie moves toward the stage banging empty beer battles together
The saxophonist joins Billy
Then the dry--

The Stripper stands by the side of the stage watching
The music builds
Billy's fingers pound the piano
Eddie jL ps up on the stage and starts dancing around
He grabs the Stripper and they jitterbug
The sailors and other customers are cn their feet, banging the mallets Cr
the tables for all they are worth

The Lemon heightens
Billy kicks back the stool a la Jerry Lee Lewis
The crowd cheers
The bouncer cheers along
The saxophonist struts the stage playing his heart out
The dr'er drives the bass dr

His hands sweep back and forth across the skins
Eddie's feet are flying
Enthusiasm over grace

The tempo is fierce

He watches Ann ride, then pulls up his collar on his wool overcoat and rides off
Boogie rides after Ann
Although he is not a goad rider, he pushes to pick up ground
Finally, he pulls alongside
Ann slows her horse and Boogie does the same
Nice morning

He smiles, lets him go and rejoins Eddie, having missed only a few steps
No one is quite sure what has happened
Quickly the attention is back to the wedding procession

We can both celebrate that
You can love him just as much, spend time with him or her

You know what  realized just yesterday

But 've been intimidated by that as well
've always held -

- When we kissed, held back
The same when we made Luve in New York
keep thinking have to be special, like normal passion wasn't proper
as if it were just too ordinary and we were beyond that

There's a sad look in his eyes
