Written by Charles Brackett, Billy Wilder & Walter Reisch Based on a story by Melchior Lengyel 1939 : : to a   of the desk
In the background is a revolving door leading to the street
Through the revolving door comes a strangely dressed individual, obviously one who doesn't belong in such surroundings
It is Comrade Buljanoff, a member of the Russian Board of Trade
Despite the spring climate of Paris, he still wears his typical Russian clothes, consisting of a coat with a fur collar, a fur cap, and heavy boots
Buljanoff glances around the lobby, obviously over-whelmed by its magnificence
The Manager, puzzled by Buljanoff's strange appearance, approaches him
(politely) Is there anything  can do for you, monsieur
No, no
He exits toward the street
The Manager returns to his customary duties, when suddenly a second Russian, similarly dressed, pushes his way through the door and gazes around
It is Comrade Iranoff
The Manager, definitely mystified by now, approaches him
Yes, monsieur
Just looking around
Iranoff exits
Again the Manager returns to his duties, when suddenly he sees that a third man, dressed in the same fashion, has appeared in the revolving door
It is Comrade Kopalski
Kopalski doesn't leave the revolving door at all but as it turns, drinks in the whole spectacle of the lobby
The Manager is by now dumfounded
taxi stands at the curb
Buljanoff and Iranoff are waiting beside it, Iranoff holding a suitcase
Kopalski, returning from the hotel, joins the group
Comrades, why should we lie to each other
It's wonderful
Let's be honest
Have we anything like it in Russia
(agreeing with him) No, no, no
Can you imagine what the beds would be in a hotel like that
They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times
maid comes in -- a French maid
(with a gleam in his eye) Comrades, if we ring nine times
let's go in
(stopping him) Just a minute -- just a minute -- have nothing against the idea but still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus
Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades
And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath
(stepping back into the taxi) don't want to go to Siberia
Iranoff and Kopalski follow him reluctantly
don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris
Don't be a fool
Go in there and ring three times
" He wouldn't say that
What he would say is "Buljanoff, you can't afford to live in a cheap hotel
Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you
Do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all
Phooey, Buljanoff
" (weakening) still say our place is with the common people, but who am  to contradict Lenin
Let's go in
All three start to leave the taxi, as we : --   -- Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski are approaching the Manager, their only suitcase carried by two of them
Are you the manager
(eyeing the three suspiciously) Yes
Pardon me for introducing Comrade Iranoff, member of the Russian Board of Trade
(bowing with strained politeness) Monsieur
This is Comrade Kopalski
Monsieur
am Comrade Buljanoff
Monsieur
May  ask how much your rooms are
(trying to get rid of them) Well, gentlemen, 'm afraid our rates are rather high
Why should you be afraid
The other two nod their agreement
The Manager has noted the single suitcase
(haughtily) might be able to accommodate you
Is there some more luggage
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this
'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe
That's even better
But, gentlemen,  am afraid
He's always afraid
The other two exchange a look of agreement again
(a little annoyed) just wanted to explain
The apartment may suit your convenience but  doubt that it will fit your convictions
It's the Royal Suite
The mention of the Royal Suite startles the three
Royal Suite
(To the manager) Just a minute
The Three Russians take a step away from the manager and go into a huddle
(in a low voice) Now Comrades,  warn you
if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble
(defending his right to a good time) We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe
That's a perfect excuse
There was no other safe big enough
The other two welcome the suggestion with relish
That's right
Good, very good
Suddenly Buljanoff grows skeptical again
Of course, we could take out the pieces and distribute them in three or four boxes in the vault and take a small room
That's an idea, isn't it
For a moment all three see their bright plans crumble
Then Iranoff comes to the rescue
Yes, it's an idea, but who says we have to have an idea
Buljanoff and Kopalski see the logic of this and their faces light up
That's right
that's right
(turning to the Manager) Give us the Royal Suite
The Manager leads the three toward the elevator
The and   to the suitcase carried by two of the Russians
: -- We hear from the outside the turning of a key, the opening of a door, then the turning of the dial, and then we see the safe door open
Through the open door we now see the Royal Suite
The Three Russians are standing in front of the safe
One of them puts the suitcase into it
-- Shooting from the interior of the room toward the safe
The Three Russians are standing around it
As Buljanoff and Iranoff close the safe door, Kopalski walks out of the shot
The   for a few seconds on Buljanoff and Iranoff, then   to the center of the room, where a waiter is setting a breakfast table
He is the former Count Rakonin, a Russian exile employed by the Hotel Clarence
Rakonin is looking with great interest toward the safe, and as he does so we hear Kopalski's voice talking into the telephone
' Will you connect me with Mercier
yes, the jeweler
Rakonin pricks up his ears and looks toward the telephone
--  -- want to speak with Monsieur Mercier personally
Hello, Monsieur Mercier
This is Kopalski of the Russian Board of Trade
We arrived this morning
Thank you
-- As he sets the breakfast table, his interest in the telephone conversation increases
' Yes, everything is here
The necklace too
All fourteen pieces
What
No, Monsieur Mercier, the court jewels of the Duchess Swana consisted of fourteen pieces
Why don't you check on that
Naturally, we have all the necessary credentials
As the voice continues, we : -- Rakonin hurries down the stairs, buttoning his overcoat around him
He exits through a door to the street
: Rakonin is getting into a taxi
(to taxi driver) Eight Rue de Chalon
: the House Number "8" above the doorway of a Parisian apartment house
Camera pulls back to medium shot of the whole entrance
Into it is striding a typical Parisian playboy
He is Count Leon d'Algout
-- ' The door is being opened by Swana's maid
Leon enters like a man thoroughly at home
Good morning, Count
Good morning
Her Highness is still dressing
(as he walks toward Swana's door) That's all right
-- ' Swana sits at her dressing table in a negligee
Leon enters with the easy air of an old friend
He kisses her lightly
Hello, Leon
Good morning, Swana
During Swana's long speech he sits down, not paying much attention to her patter, lights a cigarette, and glances through a magazine
It's really a wretched morning
wretched
can't get myself right
wanted to look mellow and  look brittle
My face doesn't compose well
all highlights
how can dim myself down, Leon
Suggest something
am so bored with this face
wish  had someone else's face
Whose face would you have if you had your choice
Oh, well, guess one gets the face one deserves
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana
However many questions you ask you never expect an answer
Don't you find that restful
Why didn't you come last night
Darling,  was busy looking out for your interests
Did you win
(enthusiastically) We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market
our worries are over
You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers
You will be in a position to give it to me
(with humor) Oh, Leon, you are so good to me
(She kisses him) We can be rich if you say the word
had dinner with the Guizots last night
(contemptuously) Those newspaper people
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press
Now listen, Swana
sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne
"The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"
(protestingly) Oh, Leon
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past
Was it for this that  refused to endorse Dr
Bertrand's Mouthwash could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs
and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid
understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity
They are willing to pay any price
They have a circulation of two million
Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou
Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages
can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments
Leon knows on which note to play for Swana's benefit
Well,  am the last person to persuade you, but don't do it blindly
if this is your decision, you must be prepared to face the consequences
(With the expression of a man ready to give his all) will have to go to work
Swana rises and goes over to Leon
His method has been highly successful
My little Volga boatman
Stop threatening
don't deserve this
(Embracing him) Are you my little Volga boatman
Now, Swana
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman
(anything to stop her) Yes, 'm your little Volga boatman
(walking back to the dressing table) Well
two million readers know exactly what they want
Chapter One: " Childhood behind Golden Bars
Lovely Little Princess Plays with Rasputin's Beard
" Leon sits down next to her, growing enthusiastic
've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific
"Caviar and Blood
" Swana escapes over the ice
couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin
(thinking of another idea) Darling, this would be wonderful
Just once
weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik
(straining her memory) Was
No
not by a Bolshevik
Too bad
Brings our price down ten thousand francs
There is a knock on the door
Come in
The Maid enters
Count Rakonin asks the privilege of a few words, Your Highness
Count Rakonin
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil
You know him
Oh, yes
Tell him  won't be able to see him for a half an hour
The Count says if it could be as soon as possible
It is luncheon time and he is just between courses
The Maid exits
Swana walks toward the door of the living room
-- ' charming room, which manages to create a little of the atmosphere of Old Russia
Rakonin stands, his overcoat still buttoned about him, waiting nervously
Swana enters, leaving the door ajar
Rakonin approaches her with the respect he would have paid her at the Imperial Court
Your Highness
How do you do, my friend
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but
What is it, Rakonin
Did you lose your job
No, madame, something of the utmost importance
it concerns your jewels
My jewels
remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar
had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace
still see you bending before His Majesty
You wore your diadem and a necklace
your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels
(puzzled) Why do you bring this up after so many years
They are here
Your jewels
Here in Paris
Alexis
Do you know what you are saying
This morning three Soviet agents arrived
overheard a telephone conversation with Mercier, the jeweler
Your Highness, they are going to sell them
-- From the door of the bedroom appears Leon, his face alert
Did  hear something about jewels
Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news
-- Swana goes to the telephone
(into phone) Balzac 2769
(to Leon) My lawyer
Leon steps to her side, highly interested
am sorry
have to leave
(to Rakonin) Thank you so much, my friend
will get in touch with you
Count Rakonin leaves
(into phone) This is the Duchess Swana
want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon
it's very important
please get him right away
Hello, Monsieur Cornillon
The most incredible thing has happened
My jewels are here in Paris
Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them
Yes
yes
we must act immediately
Call the police
Have them arrested
Well, then, get an injunction
But do something, Monsieur Cornillon
(apparently the answer is some objection from Cornillon) But they are my jewels
There must be some way of getting them back
(just as nervous as Swana) What does he say
(to Leon) Shhh
(into phone) But how can there be a question
Are you my lawyer or theirs
All right, 'll let you know
She hangs up, rises, the legal situation whirling around in her brain
What did he say
(discouraged) It looks pretty hopeless
there may be a chance
that's all
The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake
He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money
That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers
(taking her in his arms) Darling, calm down
Why do you need a lawyer
Haven't you your little Volga boatman
Swana looks up at him, hope dawning in her eyes, as we : spread out on a table in the Royal Suite
Camera pulls back to a
We see Mercier, the jeweler, examining the jewels with an eyepiece screwed in his eye
Around him stand the Three Russians
Mercier, a middle-aged man of the greatest suavity and elegance, but a shrewd trader none the less, looks up
Very good
superb
excellent
it would be foolish to belittle the quality of the merchandise but your terms are impossible
My counteroffer is the absolute maximum
But, Monsieur Mercier
(continuing) Gentlemen, 'll let you in on a little secret
we are only undertaking this deal for the prestige involved, and, quite frankly, we are expecting to take a loss
Iranoff draws Buljanoff aside and whispers in his ear
(whispering) Capitalistic methods
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss
The telephone rings
(answering phone) Hello
this is Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski
Who
Count d'Algout
No, no
it must be a mistake
we can't be disturbed
(continuing) assure you no one else could meet the figure named by my syndicate
at least under the present economic conditions
We can wait
(pompously) Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money
Yes
Gentlemen
let's put our cards face down
Right now there is a Russian commission in New York trying to sell fifteen Rembrandts
There is another in London mortgaging the oil fields in Baku
You need money and you need it quickly
think my offer is fair and does not even take advantage of your situation
- -- , , (to Mercier) Just a minute
The Three Russians step to one side
(in a low voice) He's cutting our throat
But what can we do
We have to accept
Comrades
Comrades
Don't let's give in so quickly
After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia
All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes
There is a knock at the door
Iranoff walks toward it, unlocks it, opens it a little
In the door appears Leon
We don't want to be disturbed
My name is Count d'Algout telephoned
If you want to see us you must come later
just want a word with Monsieur Mercier
But you can't
Leon pushes his way in
He approaches Monsieur Mercier
The Russians get between him and the jewels and during the following scene put them back into the safe
Monsieur Mercier
May  introduce myself
am Count Leon d'Algout think  had the pleasure of meeting you in your beautiful shop
was admiring a platinum watch with diamond numbers
Oh, yes, yes
(glancing at the jewels) Glorious, aren't they
Now, monsieur, you have no right
(very charmingly) Just a moment
(to Mercier) hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier
It might bring you into serious difficulties
Who are you
What do you want
What is this
These jewels are the property of the Duchess Swana of Russia, and were seized illegally by the Soviet Government
am acting for Her Highness, the Duchess
Here is my power of attorney
He hands it to Mercier, who reads it
(excitedly) You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense
These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State
We'll leave the problem of their ownership to the French courts
Meanwhile  have filed a petition for an injunction to prohibit you from either selling or removing the jewels
Here is a copy
The Russians take the copy of the injunction, read it flabbergasted
As they do so, Leon turns to Monsieur Mercier
thought it my duty to warn you would hate to see you get in any trouble, monsieur
Thank you
(he turns to the Russians) Gentlemen, this introduces a new element into our negotiations
Until this claim is completely settled
We can call our ambassador
give you my word
They were confiscated legally
Please try to understand my position
am not with-drawing
My offer stands and as soon as you produce a clear title, approved by the French courts, the deal is settled
Until then, good day
He bows and starts toward the door
Leon accompanies him, opening the door as though he were the host
(intimately) hope you will forgive me, Monsieur Mercier
(in a low voice) On the contrary
consider myself very lucky
Good day
He bows
(bowing) Good day, monsieur
Mercier leaves
Leon closes the door and turns back into the room to the three outraged Russians
(jauntily) Well, gentlemen
how about a little lunch
Get out of here
Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen
All is not lost
You may have a chance
(bursting forth) We may have a chance
Yes
a very slim one
want to be fair
don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case
We haven't anything to discuss with you
We'll talk to a lawyer
All right -- go ahead
you talk to the lawyer and 'll talk to the judge
That won't help you
You can't intimidate us
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case
You think because you represent the former Duchess
The Duchess
The former Duchess
In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman
warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand
What can she say
But how will she look
The fashions this spring are very becoming to her
Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French
Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little
You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you
suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels
Oh, no, no
am not a highwayman, 'm just a nuisance
All 'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us
what is in your mind
Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition
What proposition
just said let's have a little lunch
(picking up the telephone) Room service
-- : shooting toward door leading to the Royal Suite
Two waiters are wheeling in a table on which is a block of ice filled with caviar and a collection of the most delicious hors d'oeuvres
They enter the room
After the door is closed we hear from within loud  of approval from Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski
The   on the door
After a few seconds a very good-looking cigarette girl enters the room and from within we  even louder  of approval
Next a waiter enters carrying champagne and another with glasses on a tray
As they are going into the room, the cigarette girl comes out and runs excitedly down the corridor
Camera pans with her away from the door as she starts down the staircase
-- Some of the waiters come out, others go in, carrying further delicacies
-- Up the staircase pants the cigarette girl, followed by two other cigarette girls
Camera pans with them as they rush toward the door of the Royal Suite and enter
From within we terrific greetings
The      as we
The electric lights are lit and a band of five Hungarian musicians enters carrying typical Hungarian instruments, including a cimbalom
-- The orchestra is playing; the Three Russians, very high by now, are dancing with the girls
One of them is wearing the cigarette tray of one of the girls
It is a harmless but loud and hilarious party
Apart from all the hullabaloo sits Leon at the desk, a telegraph blank before him
Hey, Sascha
Serge
Misha
The three come to him, all in the gayest, most agreeable mood
Yes, Leon
(pawing him) What is it, my boy
About this telegram to Moscow
Why should you bother
'll write it for you
Leon
Leonitchka
(he embraces Leon) Why are you so good to us
(he kisses Leon) (kissing Leon too) Leon, my little boy
(joining them) Oh, Leon, you are so good
(freeing himself as best he can) What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade
Razinin
(writing) Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow
You wouldn't like Razinin
He's a bad man
Sends people to Siberia
We don't like Razinin
(again pawing Leon) We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon
The others join him and kiss Leon
Yes, we like Leon
little Leonitchka
This brings on a new frenzy of Russian affection
Leon frees himself and rises
How does this strike you
Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow
Unexpected situation here
Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal
After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution
Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski
If we say that, Leon
we'll be sent to Siberia
And if we have to go to Siberia
(still looking over the telegram) 'll send you a muff
Oh, why are you so good to us
Yes, you are so good, Leon
Again they overwhelm Leon with an avalanche of Russian affection
At this moment Rakonin enters with some new bottles of champagne
The Russians immediately leave Leon and direct their affection toward Rakonin, embracing and kissing him
Comrade waiter, dear waiteritchka
Why are you so good to us
You good waiter
After Rakonin has turned over the champagne to the Russians, Leon takes him aside
Take this telegram to the telegraph office at once
Yes, monsieur
He leaves the room
-- Rakonin comes out with the telegram
The   with him as he hurries down the corridor, reading it
The on an insert of the telegram as we : : Pan down past the roof of an official building to a of a window
Behind it stands Razinin, reading the telegram
He is a violent, militant Bolshevik
The telegram fills him with rage
As he crumples it, and stares into space, his expression bodes ill for Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski
: -- : shooting toward door of elevator
The elevator comes up and stops, the door opens, and the Three Russians step out
They are very smartly dressed and look like any urbane gentlemen coming from the races
Two of them have racing glasses
As they walk toward the Royal Suite, Lady Lavenham, an elderly English aristocrat, comes out of her room
Good afternoon, messieurs, mes Comrades
Good afternoon, Lady Lavenham
And how is Lord Lavenham
and little Lady Beatrice
Very well
Did fortune favor you at the races
Comme ci, comme ca
understand
nothing to write home about
(alarmed) Who wants to write home about it
It's just a saying
How about joining us Saturday night for dinner
We're having a few friends
Are we free, Buljanoff
Possibly
We'll manage
Then let's say at nine
Black tie or white tie
Oh, let's make it white
Certainly
Au revoir
Au revoir
As they walk into the Royal Suite, Buljanoff tosses off an urbane comment
Nice people
As the three enter, the telephone rings
Buljanoff and Kopalski go into the living room
Iranoff answers the telephone
(into telephone) Yes, Leon
(a little bit annoyed) What is it, Leon
You can't hurry such things
You must give Moscow a little time
There's nothing we can do about it
why don't you drop in later
Au revoir
He steps into the living room
As Iranoff enters Buljanoff rushes toward him
Misha
Misha
What is it
telegram from Moscow
It must have been here all day
(joining them and reading telegram) Halt negotiations immediately
Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power
Your authority cancelled herewith
Razinin
It is Thursday
It's six o'clock already
They rush into the bedroom
always said it would be Siberia
: -- Manager at desk
Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski rush from the direction of the elevator
Iranoff pauses at the desk
The others go on to the door and wait for him there
(to Manager) Special Envoy is coming from Moscow
He'll occupy the Royal Suite
Move our things to the smallest room you've got
Yes, monsieur
Right away
instantly
From the door Buljanoff and Kopalski call impatiently
Iranoff
'm coming
As he starts toward the door, we : -- The train has already arrived as the Three Russians hurry down the platform
Neither do they know the name of the Envoy Extraordinary, nor his appearance, and they are searching the crowd for some clue
This is a fine thing
Maybe we've missed him already
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like
Iranoff points to a bearded man with a knapsack
That must be the one
Yes, he looks like a comrade
They follow the man, but just as they are ready to approach him he is greeted by a German Girl
Both raise their hands in the Nazi salute
Heil Hitler
As the two embrace, the Three Russians stop in their tracks
No, that's not him
Positively not
By now the platform is almost empty
As the Russians in the foreground look around helplessly, we see in the background a woman who obviously is also looking for someone
It is Ninotchka Yakushova, the Envoy Extraordinary
The Russians exchange troubled looks and go toward her
Ninotchka comes forward
As they meet she speaks
(to Iranoff) am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff
am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff
am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy Extraordinary, acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin
Present me to your colleagues
They shake hands
Ninotchka's grip is strong as a man's
Comrade Buljanoff
Comrade
Comrade Kopalski
Comrade
What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade
If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers
(sternly) Don't make an issue of my womanhood
We are here for work
all of us
Let's not waste time
Shall we go
The Russians are taken aback
As Ninotchka bends down to lift her two suitcases, Iranoff calls: Porter
Porter steps up to them
Here, please
What do you want
May  have your bags, madame
Why
He is a porter
He wants to carry them
(to Porter) Why
Why should you carry other people's bags
Well
that's my business, madame
That's no business
that's a social injustice
That depends on the tip
(trying to take Ninotchka's bags) Allow me, Comrade
No, thank you
Ninotchka takes both suitcases and walks away with the Three Russians, whose nervousness has increased with every word from the Envoy Extraordinary
How are things in Moscow
Very good
The last mass trials were a great success
There are going to be fewer but better Russians
The hearts of the Three Russians drop to their boots, as we : -- Ninotchka, followed by the Russians, comes through the lobby, observing every detail of these unfamiliar surroundings
Suddenly she stops
In the showcase of a hat shop in the lobby is displayed a hat of the John-Frederic's type
What's that
It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat
Ninotchka shakes her head
Tsk, tsk, tsk, how can such a civilization survive which permits women to put things like that on their heads
It won't be long now, Comrades
She walks out of the shot toward the elevator, followed by the Three Russians, as we : Ninotchka enters, followed by the Three Russians, who by now are frightened to death
This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova
hope you like it
(glancing around the tremendous room) Which part of the room is mine
You see
it is a little different here
They don't rent rooms in pieces
We had to take the whole suite
Ninotchka begins to unpack her things and puts her typewriter on the desk
How much does this cost
Two thousand francs
week
day
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff
cow
Two thousand francs
If  stay here a week  will cost the Russian people seven cows
(with an outburst of emotion) Who am  to cost the Russian people seven cows
We had to take it on account of the safe
For ourselves
we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters
Ninotchka takes Lenin's picture from her bags
am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this
(she puts the photograph on the desk) Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow
We did our best, Comrade
hope so for your sake
(she sits at her desk and starts to type her report) Let us examine the case
What does the lawyer say
Which lawyer
You didn't get legal advice
We didn't want to get mixed up with lawyers
They are very expensive here
If you just say hello to a lawyer
well, there goes another cow
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess
am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture
will not repeat your mistake will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative
Ninotchka continues to type
The Three Russians watch her nervously
Each click pounds on their consciences
(looking up) Comrade Buljanoff
Yes, Comrade
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's
(with fright in his voice) With two f's, if you please
Ninotchka goes on with her typing
Suddenly she looks up at Iranoff, who becomes self-conscious and fixes his tie
As he does so he sees that Ninotchka's glance is concentrated on the spats which he was wearing and in his hurry forgot to remove
He knows it is too late to do anything about it except to stand one foot behind the other, as Ninotchka types faster, the clicking of her keys twice as loud
Ninotchka picks up the telephone
(into phone) Will you send me some cigarettes, please
(suddenly getting up) Comrades,  am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State
(with utmost gravity) You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry
Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time
Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it
Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people
And you three comrades
We did it with the best intentions
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions
Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess
Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy
Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris
Yes, Comrade
You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property
Is there anything  can do, Comrade
You might get me an accurate map of Paris
want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city
Yes, Comrade
The buzzer rings
Come in
The three Cigarette Girls enter
(gaily) Hello
Hello
Cigarettes
Ninotchka looks up astonished
Seeing her, the Cigarette Girls freeze
The Russians stand by quietly
(looking at the Russians) Comrades, you seem to have been smoking a lot
: --  --   -- : shooting past the desk toward the revolving door
The telephone rings and the Desk Clerk answers
Desk
yes, Monsieur Kopalski
(he writes down the message) you are expecting Count d'Algout
uh huh
but he is not to go to the Royal Suite under any circumstances
He should go to your new room, 985
Thank you, monsieur
(he hangs up the receiver) few seconds later Ninotchka, naturally completely unaware of the telephone conversation, passes by
She carries a map in her hand
Good evening, madame
Good evening
She exits out the door
, Ninotchka emerges, unfolds the map
- -- in the hands of Ninotchka
The   down to a - of the little drawing of the Hotel Clarence on the map
The  then   from the Clarence toward the opposite side of the street, but before we reach the opposite side we see that in the center of the street is a little isle of safety
The  proceeds  to the opposite side of the square and we : The Real Location Corresponding to That Seen on the Map and seen from the same
It is evening, and along the street comes Leon on his way to the hotel
The   with him as he crosses the street
He reaches the isle of safety and there passes Ninotchka, who has come from the other side
They pass on the little isle without noticing each other
Suddenly we hear the whistle of a traffic policeman and both Ninotchka and Leon have to step back to the little isle
-- on the little isle
Wanting some information Ninotchka turns to him -- completely impersonal
You, please
Me
Yes
Could you give me some information
Gladly
How long do we have to wait here
Well -- until the policeman whistles again
At what intervals does he whistle
What
How many minutes between the first and second whistle
That's funny
It's interesting never gave it a thought before
Have you never been caught in a similar situation
Have
Do you know when  come to think about it it's staggering
If add it all up  must have spent years waiting for signals
Imagine
An important part of my life wasted between whistles
In other words you don't know
No
Thank you
You're welcome
Ninotchka gets out her map, starts to unfold it
Can  help you
You might hold this for me
Love to
(engrossed in her geography) Correct me if  am wrong
We are facing north, aren't we
(bewildered) Facing north
'd hate to commit myself without my compass
Pardon me
are you an explorer
No
am looking for the Eiffel Tower
Is that thing lost again
Listen
if you are interested in a view
am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint
Technical
couldn't help you from that angle
You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off
How long does it take a man to land
Now, isn't that too bad
The last time  jumped  forgot to clock it
(looks at map) Let me see
Eiffel Tower
Your finger, please
He takes her finger and points to the map with it
(skeptically) Why do you need my finger
Bad manners to point with your own
Here
the Eiffel Tower
And where are we
(shifting her finger back to the hotel) Here
here we are
here you are and here  am
feel it
am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points
Must you flirt
don't have to but  find it natural
Suppress it
'll try
Ninotchka starts to fold her map
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence
have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society
It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that
Russian
love Russians
Comrade
have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years
Your type will soon be extinct
She walks away from him coldly
Leon stares after her, fascinated
-- : Camera moves with Ninotchka as she enters
She approaches an Attendant
Please
can you tell me the exact width of the foundation on which the piers are resting
and the depth
You don't have to worry
The thing is safe
am not afraid
want to know
Leon, who apparently has taken a taxi and prepared himself otherwise, enters the scene, reading from a book
(reading) The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square
(he tips his hat and interjects) hope you'll forgive me but  thought you'd
(interrupting) Go ahead
The  goes with Ninotchka and Leon as they walk toward the steps
(continuing) Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side
The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees
That's a strange angle
Yes, very strange
By now they have reached the staircase
They start up
(continuing to read) Ascending to the tower is a staircase consisting of eight hundred and twenty- nine steps
(this disclosure frightens Leon as he realizes the climb ahead of him
He reads on as they walk up) and an additional two hundred and fifty-four steps to the very top
(now Leon stops but Ninotchka proceeds on out of the picture
Leon calls after her and reads from his book in a loud voice) There is an elevator included in the price of admission
Ninotchka continues to climb
--  ( ' ) Ninotchka, paying no attention to him, walks up the stairs, two at a time
-- He looks after Ninotchka, then makes up his mind and returns down the stairs
--  , shooting toward the elevator door
The elevator with several passengers is just about to leave when Leon hurries into it
The door closes and the elevator starts to ascend quickly
: -- The   includes the elevator door and a beautiful background view of Paris
The elevator door opens and Leon emerges leisurely
He is just about to step to the top of the staircase, when suddenly, to his great amazement, he sees Ninotchka, who stands at the balustrade overlooking Paris
She has climbed the tower faster than he despite the elevator
Dumbfounded, Leon approaches her
Ninotchka turns, very matter-of-fact
You gave me some very valuable information
Thank you
(looking at the dazzling view) And thank you for getting me up here
've never seen this before
Beautiful, isn't it
Yes, it is
'm glad  saw it before becoming extinct
Do not misunderstand me
do not hold your frivolity against you
(she looks him up and down) As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture
feel sorry for you
You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles
It glitters
Night View of Paris with Its Lights Ablaze, as seen from the Eiffel Tower
do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity
What a city
There are the Grands Boulevards
blasted out of the heart of the old streets
The Arc de Triomphe
made to greet Napoleon's army
The Opera
And Montmartre
Montparnasse
La Boheme
and now 'll show you the greatest attraction
(he steps to a telescope and, taking some money from his pocket, drops a coin in the slot) It will cost me a franc but it is worth it
(he adjusts the telescope) The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique
Here, look
(she looks in telescope) What do you see
see a house that looks like any other house
What's remarkable about it
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within
There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality
So that is your house
Well, let's say  live in it
Such a pleasant place
all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway
(straight from the shoulder) Does that mean that you want me to go there
(feeling that he has offended her) Please don't misunderstand me
Then you don't want me to go there
(in a pickle) Now  didn't say that either
naturally nothing would please me more
(simply) Then why don't we go
(looking at him) You might be an interesting subject of study
will do my best
They walk toward the elevator as we : ,   -- ' In the foreground stands a console on which is a telephone
Gaston, Leon's elderly, dignified butler, is answering the phone
(into phone) No
Count d'Algout is still out
Yes, as soon as he returns 'll tell him
Yes
'll tell him Monsieur Buljanoff
He puts down the receiver as Leon opens the door with his key
Ninotchka and Leon enter
Ninotchka, during the following scene, is studying every detail of the apartment with the eye of a technical expert
Good evening, Gaston
Good evening, Monsieur
Is this what you call the "butler"
Yes
(takes Gaston's hand) Good evening, comrade
(to Leon) This man is horribly old
You should not make him work
He takes good care of that
He looks sad
Do you whip him
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water
(to the completely flabbergasted Gaston) The day will come when you will be free
Go to bed, little father
We want to be alone
Leon opens the door to the living room
Ninotchka enters
Just as he is about to follow her, Gaston addresses him
(in a low voice) Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone
Go to bed
,   -- ' Leon enters the room
Closes the door
Ninotchka is examining the room
Well, may  offer you a drink, or how about something to eat
Thank you
've had all the calories necessary for today
Leon feels a little uncertain as to how to approach this creature
What do we do now
We take off our hat and coat
(he takes her things) We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable
We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening
We look at each other
We smile
(Ninotchka doesn't respond) Well
we don't smile
How about some music
Is that customary
It helps
It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp
As  am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand,  shall turn on the radio
(the observer) should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five
Not too big and not too small
What 'd call the typical room of an average man
Or shall we say a little above average
Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study have nothing to conceal
Just look around
That's my desk
Those are my books, and here am
Where shall we begin
will start with you
That's great
'm thirty-five years old
Just over six feet tall
weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped
And what is your profession
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased
That's a full-time job
And what do you do for mankind
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak
You are something we do not have in Russia
Thank you
Thank you
That is why  believe in the future of my country
begin to believe in it myself since 've met you
still don't know what to make of it
It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka
You pronounce it incorrectly
Ni- notchka
Ni-notchka
That is correct
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit
Your general appearance is not distasteful
Thank you
Look at me
The whites of your eyes are clear
Your cornea is excellent
Your cornea is terrific
Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that 'm falling in love with you
You are bringing in wrong values
Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process
lot of nonsense is talked and written about it
Oh,  see
What do you use instead
acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all
What can  possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you
You don't have to do a thing
Chemically we are already quite sympathetic
(bewildered, and yet completely intrigued) You're the most improbable creature 've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka
You repeat yourself
'd like to say it a thousand times
Don't do it, please
'm at a loss, Ninotchka
You must forgive me if  appear a little old- fashioned
After all, 'm just a poor bourgeois
It's never too late to change used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself
My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but  preferred the bayonet
(bewildered) The bayonet
Did you really
was wounded before Warsaw
Wounded
How
was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade
Would you like to see my wound
(dumfounded) 'd love to
(she pulls the blouse off her shoulder and shows him her scar) Tsk, tsk, tsk
Polish lancer
was sixteen
Poor Ninotchka
Poor, poor Ninotchka
(readjusting her blouse) Don't pity me
Pity the Polish lancer
After all, 'm alive
More and more puzzled and fascinated, Leon sits down close to her
What kind of a girl are you, anyway
Just what you see
tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution
You're the most adorable cog  ever saw in my life
Ninotchka, Cogitska, let me confess something
Never did dream  could feel like this toward a sergeant
clock strikes
Do you hear that
It's twelve o'clock
It's midnight
One half of Paris is making love to the other half
Look at the clock
One hand has met the other hand
They kiss
Isn't that wonderful
That's the way a clock works
There's nothing wonderful about it
You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration
can't possibly think of a better reason
It's false sentimentality
(trying desperately to make her mood more romantic) You analyze everything out of existence
You analyze me out of existence
won't let you
Love is not so simple
Ninotchka, Ninotchka, why do doves bill and coo
Why do snails, coldest of all creatures, circle interminably around each other
Why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates
Why do flowers open their petals
Oh, Ninotchka, Ninotchka, surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion
a general warmth in the palms of your hands
a strange heaviness in your limbs
a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing, more exalting, than thirst
He pauses, waiting for the results of his speech
You are very talkative
That is too much for Leon
He takes her into his arms and kisses her
Was that talkative
No, that was restful
Again
Leon kisses her again
Thank you
Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka
My impossible, unromantic, statistical
The telephone rings
(continuing) Glorious, analytical
The telephone is ringing
Oh, let it ring
But one of your friends may be in need of you
You must answer
Leon exits out of shot to answer telephone
-- Leon enters, sits down, takes the telephone
(into phone) Hello
Yes
'm sorry but couldn't make it
ran into a friend from the army
What
The deal is off
Are you crazy, Buljanoff
- -- She is startled by the name
-- special envoy arrived
What
That sounds better
'll be glad to see her any time she wants
Oh, she doesn't want to see me
What do you know about that
Why
Well, 'll get in touch with her myself
What's her name
(he takes a pencil and a piece of paper) What
Yaku
How do you spell it
Heavens
those Russian names
(he starts to write it down) Oh,
Camera pulls back and Ninotchka enters the shot
She takes pencil from Leon's hand, writes out the name, and leaves again
At first Leon is not aware of the full significance of her action
Then it dawns on him
(continuing) Yakushova
Ninotch
At last the situation is entirely clear to him
(into phone) All right
Thank you
He hangs up and stares at Ninotchka
She is putting on her jacket
(camera panning with him as he walks over to her) Ninotchka
He takes her arm
must go
Ninotchka, or shall  say Special Envoy Yakushova
Let's forget that we ever met
have a better suggestion
Let's forget that the telephone ever rang
never heard that you are Yakushova
you are Ninotchka
my Ninotchka
(firmly) was sent here by my country to fight you
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning
There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy
(uncompromisingly) As a representative of Moscow
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves
It is out of the question
If you wish to approach me
You know  want to
Then do it through my lawyer
(desperate) Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this
'm crazy about you, and thought 'd made an impression on you
You liked the white of my eye
Ninotchka looks at him for a second, then pulls herself together
must go
She starts for the door
But, Ninotchka,  held you in my arms
You kissed me
kissed the Polish lancer too
before he died
As she goes out, we : -- ' : (Note: We have to invent some brief scene to indicate that three days have gone by
From this we) : The butler opens the door
Swana enters, her manner showing her complete familiarity with the place
Good morning, Your Highness
Good morning, Gaston
Count d'Algout is still asleep
(as she walks toward Leon's room) That's all right
' The curtains are drawn
The night light is still on
Leon, a dressing gown over his pajamas, is sound asleep in a big arm chair
As Swana enters, she sees him with some alarm
Leon
What in heaven's name
Huh
Is anything wrong
Are you ill
No
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend
just couldn't sleep
got up and went back
and then got up again
These last few days
whew
Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously
Much as 'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money,  won't do it at the expense of your health
Particularly as we know we won't get much
(tenderly) You look so pale
pale but interesting
There is a knock at the door
Come in
Gaston enters with a breakfast tray
Your breakfast, monsieur
don't feel like any breakfast
Nonsense
How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength
Shall  draw your bath, sir
Make it ice cold
Not in your condition
(to Gaston) Make it tepid, Gaston
tepid and tender
And lay out his gray suit
(to Leon) Afterwards 'll drive you through the Bois
Slowly
in Waltz time
blue shirt, perhaps
Blue
Let's offset his mood
Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie
Very well, Your Highness
Gaston disappears into the bath-dressing room
Swana makes Leon sit down and seats herself beside him
Now
here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs
Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs
Probably not
They have such unfeeling eyes
We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt
Darling,  haven't seen you for three livelong days
seventy-two hours
(irritably) Oh, please, Swana
don't know whether 'm standing on my head or my heels
Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when 'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her
You haven't seen her yet
No, and believe me 've tried everything
must have telephoned her a hundred times
've sent her telegrams, 've sent her flowers
asked her to dinner
offered her seats for the Opera
That proletarian
In the old days we'd have had her flogged
That wouldn't have done any good
Not with her
(forgetting himself) She's the most incredible creature 've ever seen
You just told me you hadn't seen her
Well
er
caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik
What does she look like
You can't imagine
That bad
(Leon nods) Old or young
Timeless
When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris
She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli
What a woman
What a woman
There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes
You saw all that in one glimpse
(getting up) Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open
(he walks over to the bathroom) Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you
Leon exits into the bathroom
As he does so a bell rings
Gaston
There is no answer
After a slight pause she herself goes to answer the bell
: --   -- ' , shooting toward the door
Swana goes to the door and opens it
The Three Russians stand outside
Seeing Swana, they are a little intimidated
How do you do
Swana suspects that for the first time she is being confronted by representatives of the Soviet government
Yes
We want to talk to Count d'Algout
My name is Kopalski
Oh
you are the three gentlemen from Moscow
Yes
(icily) You may wait
She closes the door
--    ' The Three Russians, very impressed, stand looking at the door which has just been closed
That's her
Imagine
The niece of the Czar opening the door for us
Once in Petersburg  was driving down the Nevsky Prospect in my cart and Her Highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction, and when  couldn't make way quick enough she spat in my face
Now look here, Buljanoff
You never were in Petersburg, you never owned a cart, and she never spat in your face
Who are you trying to impress
At this moment the door is opened by Leon in his bathrobe
Hello, boys
Leon
Come in, come in
They enter
-- ' Leon and the Three Russians enter
What's new
(excitedly) Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate
She is going to fight that injunction
She's going to make a precedent of it
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites
She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer
(eagerly) What did she say about me
(after a moment's consideration) think she covered you with the parasites
Leon is disappointed
And Leonitchka
What she said about us
And they might believe her in Moscow
What do you mean they might -- they will
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today
well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no
Leon is so engrossed in his thoughts that he overlooks the hint
Well, boys, 'd like to help you but what can  do
Yesterday  waited six hours in the lobby
She doesn't leave her room
She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books
All right, then make an appointment with her so  can see her
We can't
but you are so ingenious, Leon
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we
No, no
Didn't we put up a strong resistance
Oh, yes, yes
You must help us, Leon
if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia
Or it might be the firing squad
Or we can't go back to Russia
An idea dawns on Iranoff
What's wrong with that
Kopalski and Buljanoff seize on the same idea
Yes
We could stay with Leon
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends
Boys, boys
don't forget Russia is your mother country
Three sons walking out all at once
that's too much for any mother
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you
Swana's voice comes from the next room
Leon
Just a minute
Leon goes back to the other room
'  --  , shooting toward the door of the living room
Swana stands putting on her gloves
'm leaving, dear
'm lunching at Fouquet's if you can make it, and
Leon, remember, a man should think it over twice before he decides to become a mother
She kisses him lightly and walks out
--   --    -- It is piled deep with law books and papers
Ninotchka sits at it, conferring with two Lawyers
(uncertainly) seem to remember some additional injunctive provision dealing with the property of foreigners residing in France
(with the precision of a machine) You are referring to paragraph 59b, section 25f of the Civil Code
The Lawyers exchange a glance of surprise at her knowledge
One of them takes up one of the law books and as he starts to look up the case, Ninotchka speaks
Page eight hundred twenty-four
Again the Lawyers exchange a glance of astonishment
And do not fail to read the three footnotes
While you are studying it will eat
(She picks up the telephone) Food please
Rakonin is answering the telephone
(into phone) Room service
Just a moment please
He beckons to someone out of the scene
Leon enters the scene and takes the telephone
(with an assumed French accent -- into phone) Room service speaking
--  -- (into phone) Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty
What
There is a strike in the kitchen
Good
Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause
hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables
What
You won't serve me either
Now look here, Comrade,  think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people
-- -  -- (into phone) So
You want to make a strike breaker out of me
am surprised at you, Comrade
Is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch
All  can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that Royal Suite
He hangs up the telephone with a triumphant smile
: Ninotchka emerges from the elevator and starts toward the street
As she passes the showcase of the millinery shop again, she stops and looks at the same hat
Again she shakes her head sadly
Tsk, tsk, tsk
She walks toward the street, as we , : taxi is parked at the curb
Ninotchka comes from the hotel and goes to the taxi
-- The Driver puts his hand on the handle of his cab's door expectantly
Where to, madame
Can you recommend a restaurant
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood
If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's
(interrupting) Where do you eat
At Pere Mathieu's
Where is that
It's just a place for workmen
Where is it
Eight blocks down in the Rue de Poivrel
He opens the door of his cab
Thank you
She turns and starts away in the direction he has indicated
The Driver looks after her astounded
The   from her to the car which stands behind the taxi
It is Leon's smart roadster
Leon sits at the wheel
He too is looking after Ninotchka, astonished
He gets out of his car and starts in the direction she has taken
As he does so, we : --     ' Pere Mathieu's is a workman's restaurant set a few steps below the level of the sidewalk
few typical French workmen are going in for lunch
Ninotchka enters the scene, looks around for a second, then goes in too
--  ' It is a pleasantly simple place crowded with workmen sitting at lunch
An electric piano is playing
Pere Mathieu, greeting all his guests like a typical restaurateur, sees Ninotchka enter
This way, madame
Are you alone
By the window perhaps
(He leads the way) Or a nice little corner table
This will do
(She sits down) think this is the first time you have been to my little place
Your face is new to me
Now, what shall it be
Raw carrots and beets
(horrified) Oh, madame
This is a restaurant, not a meadow
He hands her a slate on which the menu is written
Here is what we are offering today
Please make your choice
am sure you will find something to tempt your appetite
Suddenly Ninotchka stares in the direction of the door
-- Leon has just entered
The  follows him as he makes his way casually in Ninotchka's direction affecting not to see her
He seats himself at the table directly opposite Ninotchka and pretends to be overwhelmed with surprise as he sees her
Why, hello
It certainly is a small world
(to Ninotchka) Well, madame
Shall we start with soup
Fish soup today
got up at five to fish them from the Seine
(calling over to Pere Mathieu) Crayfish soup for me
(to Leon) Very well, monsieur
(back to Ninotchka) Then, may  suggest an omelet with mushrooms
Bring me something simple
never think about food
(horrified) But, madame
If you don't think about food what do you think about
The future of the common people
(sagely) That also is a question of food, madame
'll bring you a nice little lunch a la Pere Mathieu
(he exits) Leon leans toward Ninotchka with mock humility
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that
You hurt his feelings
It was just like telling a musician you don't like music
That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx
You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him
Do you know how
(He changes to the chair at his table which is closest to her table) By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life
don't like your following me
didn't follow you
Then how did you get here
always eat here
This is a place for workmen
(laying it on thick) But my dear child,  am most at home among working men
hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence
This is my natural element
After all, what are any of us
Workingmen
At least, those of us who are worth our salt
Hyah
He waves off scene to a truckman
He is in the middle of an enormous gulp of food
He registers surprise, winks at his companion, and then, deciding to humor a drunk, waves back energetically at Leon in greeting
: -- Leon has been so successful with the truckman he tries it on another
Hyah
Another truckman responds with equal exuberance
-- Leon, intoxicated with his success, waves to the whole room
Hyah, fellows
He gets a wonderful response from all
They realize that a swell drunk is among them
(boastfully) They are all my friends
They're a swell bunch
Pere Mathieu enters the shot and serves a plate of soup to Leon and one to Ninotchka
(trying his bluff on Pere Mathieu) Ah, my friend
'm happy to see you again
'm always glad to meet a new customer, and  hope this first visit will not be your last
He exits out of shot
Ninotchka, her suspicion confirmed, looks at Leon
Just an old man
His memory is getting weak
What are you after
Must one always be after something
Your tactics are useless
My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business
If you win the suit, fine
If we win the suit, better
You do me an injustice
(He moves over to her table, leaving the soup at his table) When we went to my apartment did have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal
But you have now, and  know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death
Death
Death
Always so glum
What about life, Ninotchka
Do Russians never think of life
Of the moment in which we are living
The only moment we really have
Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka
Nothing is worth it
Please
relax beg you, Sergeant
smile
(astonished) What
Will you smile
Why
Just smile
At what
At anything
At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life
At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance
If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me
Why
Because we are an odd couple
Then you should go back to your table
No,  can't leave you
won't
Not yet
Not until 've made you laugh
at least once
To get rid of him Ninotchka emits a joyless sound which approximates a laugh
Ha
Ha
Now go back
That's not a laugh
mean a laugh from the heart
Now let's see
'm going to tell you a funny story
Just a moment
've got it
Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America
On which boat
(thrown off by her methodical thinking) Well, er
let's drop it
don't think you would care for that one
Probably not
Do you like Scotch stories
have never heard one
Two Scotchmen met on the street
and  don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter
Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy
McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr
McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr
McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs
McGillicuddy
" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs
McIntosh
"
wish they had never met
(disarmed) So do
(after a little pause) Now, here's a great one
Ha
Ha
Ha
(he looks at Ninotchka and her expression stops him) Well, maybe it's not so good
Let's forget it
How's this
Two men are looking at the moon
One says to the other, "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon
" "Yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million
" "Whew
" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon
" Ha
Ha
Ha
There is no response from Ninotchka
(starting to get sore) suppose you don't think that's funny
No
It seemed funny to me when  first heard it
Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke
Maybe it's with you
don't think so
Maybe you haven't any sense of humor
Well, 'll give you one more chance
Now listen
He gets up and speaks in a threatening voice audible to the entire room
When  heard this joke for the first time  laughed myself sick
Here goes
man comes into a restaurant and sits down and says, "Waiter
Get me a cup of coffee without cream
" After five minutes the waiter comes back and says, "'m sorry, sir, we're all out of cream, can it be without milk
" They have overheard the story and all burst into laughter
Ninotchka continues to eat her soup without a shadow of a laugh
(furious) Not funny, huh
No
So you don't think that's funny
It is funny
Everyone else thinks so
Maybe you didn't get it
He sits down again
(threateningly) 'll tell you that joke again
man comes into a restaurant
Did you get that
Yes
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter
Did you get that too
Yes
Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait
He says to the waiter, "Waiter
Bring me a cup of coffee
" So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "'m sorry, sir, we have no coffee
"
(he realizes he has made a mistake) Wait a minute
wait a minute
'm all mixed up
(he starts over again) man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter
Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "'m sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk
" He gets up and goes over to his table furiously
Ah
You have no sense of humor
That settles it
You have no sense of humor
None
No humor
In his excitement he leans on the shaky table
It topples forward
Simultaneously his feet shoot from under him and he sits violently on the floor, the contents of the table crashing about him, hot soup in his face
terrific roar of laughter arises; the whole restaurant is rocking with laughter
For a split second Ninotchka makes an effort to control the irresistible impulse to laugh but loses the battle and herself roars with laughter
(indignantly) What's funny about this
Ninotchka's laughter is uncontrollable
After a moment Leon gets up and sits next to her
As he dries himself with his napkin he sees the humor of the situation and starts to howl with laughter too
The ice is broken at last
On their mutual wild hilarity, we : -- : conference is in session -- Ninotchka, her two Lawyers, and the Three Russians
Ninotchka sits at the desk, leaning back in the chair, looking into space, and apparently weighing every point which is brought up
One of the lawyers is reading from a document
(reading) In addition to the arguments above enumerated for lifting this injunction, we wish to cite the decision of the High Court of Paris, rendered in the case of Princess Marishka against the Government of Montenegro on the fifth day of August, 1897
Comparing the facts in that case with our present set of facts we feel that the Treaty between the Republic of France and the
should prevail over all
Suddenly Ninotchka laughs
Everyone looks at her astonished
Ninotchka gets up
'm sorry, gentlemen
The other day heard such a funny story
(she laughs again) It still makes me laugh
It is very funny
(a little embarrassed) am sorry
Oh yes
about this injunction
(very businesslike) The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month
(not thinking of the injunction) That's two weeks from Thursday
We did our utmost to have it set ahead
(her attitude completely different from her former business conferences) know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court
We're helpless, aren't we
Yes
It is unfortunate
Well, there's nothing we can do about it
Why get excited
The Three Russians as well as the Lawyers are puzzled
The Russians exchange hopeful glances
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration
Au revoir, madame
Au revoir
The Lawyers leave
Left alone with the Russians, Ninotchka is unable to conceal her happiness entirely
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris
(with exaggerated efficiency) Too bad we have to waste all that time
acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities
Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you
(a little bit dreamily) Oh yes, Power and Light
Thank you
There's something else which  know will appeal to you
visit to the Paris sewers
They tell me it is extremely instructive
Huh
Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff
You all look so wintry, Comrades
And why do we always keep the windows closed
(she opens the window) Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here
Look at the birds
always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries
Now  know why
We have the high ideal but they have the climate
well, Comrades,  don't think  need you any more
If there is anything we can do for you
No, not a thing
Would you like to go out
Thank you, Comrade
Have you any money
The Russians stammer a negative answer
Smiling benevolently, Ninotchka goes to the table, takes several bills from her handbag, and goes back, extending a fifty-franc bill to Kopalski
Well, here are fifty francs
(overwhelmed) Thank you, Comrade, thank you
Bring me forty-five back
(terribly disappointed) Naturally, Comrade
The Three Russians leave
Ninotchka waits a moment
Then hurries to the door and turns the key
Camera follows her as she goes into the bedroom
She proceeds to the door leading to the corridor and turns its key
She goes to the table and takes a little key from her handbag, goes to the bureau and unlocks the drawer, opens it, and, just as she is about to take out something, her eye falls on the night table, where she sees the picture of Lenin which she brought with her from Moscow
She walks over to it and turns its face against the wall, then goes back to the bureau and takes from the drawer the very hat which twice aroused her disapproval when it was displayed in the millinery shop in the lobby
She moves over to the large mirror, puts the hat on her head, is uncertain whether it is right side to fore, and changes it
She looks at herself, aghast at seeing a complete stranger
She sits down, still staring in the mirror, then leans forward and rests her chin on her hand
As she sits studying the new Ninotchka suspiciously, we -- ' : It is evening
Leon is walking nervously up and down
Gaston is puttering over the drink table
(consulting his watch) What time have you, Gaston
Eight forty-two, sir
guess it is eight forty-two
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir
am, Gaston
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady 've noticed a distinct change in you, sir
(complacently) Have you
Decidedly
Yesterday  was greatly amazed when  came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir
And Gaston,  was happier all day long
felt 'd contributed something
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which  hope you won't, please remember the order
Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor
Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet
it should be set to music
May  add, sir, that it was with great amazement that  found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table
That is a socialistic volume which  refuse to so much as dust, sir
view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady
can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position
You being my servant
Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me
No, sir
Isn't there any revolt in you
Sometimes when  order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants
(emphatically) No, sir
Oh, you're a reactionary
Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout
from now on it's going to be share and share alike"
(outraged) Emphatically not, sir
The prospect terrifies me
Now, don't misunderstand me, sir,  don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that  should split my bank account with you
that you should take half of my life's savings
that is really too much for me
The door bell rings
Gaston starts for the door
With a gesture Leon stops him
Go to bed, little father, go to bed
Gaston leaves through the other door as Leon exits toward the entrance hall
-- ' Leon enters the scene
He opens the door
Outside stands Ninotchka wearing her new hat timidly as well as a completely new outfit which she has bought, apparently to match the new hat
It takes Leon a few seconds to digest her new splendor
He takes her hand and leads her in, closing the door
He looks at her again and kisses her hand
don't look too foolish
Foolish
If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when  caught up with it  would say, "Just a moment, you charming little dress,  want you to meet Ninotchka
you two were meant for each other
" Ninotchka feels more comfortable
Leon leads her into the living room
-- ' They both enter
Ninotchka pauses a second and looks around
You remember this room
've never been here before
wonder whom you're thinking of
Oh,  know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south
Today
now this might shock you
went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"
and here  am
You see
Life can be so simple
For twelve francs, seventy-five
Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence
The son-of-a-gun made a detour
(charmingly) But he got you here
At this moment the clock starts to strike
They both look toward it
-- The hands register nine o'clock
Leon wants to take her in his arms
She resists a little
(reprimanding him) It's nine o'clock
That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame
" (getting more and more in the spirit of her change of appearance) Well, first  should like to take off my hat and jacket
(Leon takes them) Then could we have some music
wonderful idea
Radio or records
Not radio
Let's have music that's just for ourselves
Leon turns on the victrola
(with great feeling and sincerity) 'll play it softly because  have things to tell you about which can't shout
He walks back to Ninotchka, who by now is seated in an armchair
He sits on the arm of the chair
He tries to make a declaration of his love
He stammers several words
Well, my darling
we
It is no use
In a sudden outburst of emotion he takes her in his arms and kisses her
(as they come out of the kiss) You see  couldn't shout that
(with great feeling) Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago
wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them
Now, Leon that's wrong
know they're not funny, they're silly
They're stupid
And still laugh
and when  look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski  know they are scoundrels and  should hate them -- then  realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow  tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat
and if this keeps on
am  too talkative
(radiantly) No
go on
Leon,  want to tell you something which  thought  never would say, which  thought nobody ever should say, because  thought it didn't exist
and, Leon
can't say it
They kiss again
As the kiss ends they look at each other for a second
Ninotchka gets up and goes toward the desk, sits in the desk chair, opens her handbag, which lies there, and takes from it a little mirror and a lipstick
Before she uses it she looks at Leon with guilty happiness
Leon looks at her with great tenderness and walks over to the desk and stands looking at her as she makes up her lips
What a gesture for a sergeant
As soon as she is finished, Ninotchka slips the mirror and lipstick back into her handbag and, as she does so, glances at the top of the desk
Leon,  would like to ask you something
Anything, Ninotchka
If you don't want to answer, you needn't
But if you do, you must tell me the truth
promise
swear
(seriously) Did you make any change in this room
don't think so
When  was here before  noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame
thought what a waste of silver
That's all that interested me then
Now  would like to know
what happened to the woman
Leon too is completely serious by now
For answer he quietly opens the drawer of the desk
Ninotchka looks in and takes from the drawer the photograph
As she looks at it she rises
The Duchess
Leon nods gravely
(looking at the picture) She is very attractive
She has great elegance
(she looks back at Leon) She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she
(after a little pause) Ninotchka,  love you
suppose she is very entertaining
It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous
Ninotchka, you're jealous
Ninotchka nods sadly
(with great feeling) Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself
couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer
couldn't breathe, couldn't stand it
My darling
As he takes her in his arms, we : , : Duchess Swana enters with a party consisting of General Savitzky and five other smartly dressed people of the world
The Headwaiter hurries to greet Swana
Good evening, Your Highness
Good evening, Louis
You seem to be very crowded tonight
Can you manage a table near the floor
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please
Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon
(puzzled) Count d'Algout
It is only a small table but it will be no trouble to put in some extra chairs
Swana has grasped the situation by now
No, that's another party
In order to save the situation one of the ladies makes a suggestion
Why don't we go some other place
It's so crowded here
(delighted at her luck) No, no
This is glory
At last 'm going to have a look at that female Bolshevik
Can you give us another table
Only one in the rear, 'm afraid
That's perfect
Camera moves with the group as the Headwaiter leads it toward a table
You mean Leon's bringing the Bolshevik you told us about
Isn't it divine
wouldn't have missed this for the world
(very gay, in anticipation of a triumph) Now, we must be very discreet
If she sucks her soup and drinks out of her finger bowl,  don't want anyone to laugh
(everybody in the party giggles) We must not embarrass little Leon
He is going through enough for my sake
We mustn't add insult to injury By now they have reached the table in the rear
Is this satisfactory
Thank you, Louis
They sit down
The Headwaiter bends over General Savitzky, an elderly Russian aristocrat, who sits next to Swana
Is it to be dinner, monsieur
Possibly later
We'll just start with champagne
(to the party) 'm only afraid that the doorman may spoil our fun
If only he lets her in
Swana laughs and everyone joins in her laughter
Your Highness
Yes, General Savitzky
want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels
They are very interested in the case
Swana suspects her countrymen
Are they indeed
Thank you
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune
General, please
if you hear any rumors that  am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source
As she is lighting a cigarette a guest suddenly looks toward the entrance and sees Leon
Look
There's Leon
Joyfully Swana looks toward the entrance, as does everyone else at the table
Oh yes
Where
There
Oh
How exciting
-- Suddenly, through the door of the cloakroom comes Ninotchka, radiant in a beautiful evening gown
' Swana's expression freezes as she sees Ninotchka
The rest of the guests stare in an embarrassed silence, save for one bird-brained little guest, named Marianne, who feels it her mission to save the situation
Isn't she something
neighbor nudges her warningly
Swana withers her with a glance and rises
Shall we dance, General Savitzky
Swana and the General leave for the dance floor
The guest who has nudged her turns to Marianne
Are you crazy
How could you make such a remark
Swana isn't stupid
What did  say
just said "isn't she something
"  didn't say something what
-- ' Leon and Ninotchka are seated and a Waiter stands by them presenting a bottle of champagne to Leon for his approval
(to Waiter) Is it dry
Yes, monsieur
(to Ninotchka) Is that right or do you prefer it sweet
wouldn't know
The closest  ever came to champagne was in a newsreel
The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship
It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship
or an evening
By now the Waiter is filling their glasses
Ninotchka lifts her glass and looks at it
It's funny to look back
was brought up on goat's milk,  had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne
(gaily) From goats to grapes
That's drinking in the right direction
Ninotchka takes her first sip of champagne
Leon drinks and watches her
The first sip proves a painful surprise
Ninotchka's face is that of a child who has been fed a bad medicine
Ugh
um
oh
(slowly the delight of champagne dawns on her and her face breaks into a smile) It's good
She drinks the whole glass at once
Leon looks at her in amused surprise
He drinks too
The Waiter fills their glasses again
From what  read  thought champagne was a strong drink
It's very delicate
Do people ever get drunk on this
There have been cases
but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast
(he raises his glass again fondly) To us, Ninotchka
They clink glasses and drink again, looking at each other
, including part of the dance floor
As Leon and Ninotchka lift their glasses again, Swana and General Savitzky start to dance by the table
Swana stops, pretending complete astonishment
Hello, Leon
What a surprise
You of all people
How are you, my dear
Leon gets up
Ninotchka watches the scene tensely
(embarrassed) Hello, Swana
How do you do, General Savitzky
How do you do
(to Leon) You're looking magnificent, Leon
(to General Savitzky) isn't he, General Savitzky
Yes
Leon knows that Swana wants to embarrass him but is embarrassed nevertheless
Thank you
Is this your new dress suit
Yes, Swana
Didn't  tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you
(patiently) Yes, Swana, you did
It's a dream of beauty
He never takes my word for anything, but was right, wasn't
Yes, Swana
(forcing an introduction) Am  interrupting
Not at all
Your Highness, may present Madame Yakushova
How do you do
How do you do
And General Savitzky
How do you do
How do you do
've some wonderful news for you, Leon
It's about Punchy
do you mind if  sit down
(realizing that he cannot prevent it) No
please
Swana sits down
(to General Savitzky) General, would you mind making my excuses at our table
'll be back in a few moments
Certainly
He bows and leaves
-- Well, Leon, we can be proud of our Punchy
He had a triumph at the dog show
During the following speech, Ninotchka's expression does not change
She knows exactly the game Swana is playing
(continuing) He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge
Ha
ha
ha
bought him the cutest sweater as a reward
You should see him strut down the street in it
He looks like a little boulevardier
(to Ninotchka) You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday
(to Leon) You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon
(fed up with Swana's tactics) Months, Swana
(to Ninotchka) Poor Madame Yakushova
here we are talking in mysteries
'm sure you wonder what it's all about
(dry and direct) Not at all
understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog
You made it very clear, madame
Dear me
must be losing my finesse
If 'm not careful 'll be understood by everybody
(acutely uncomfortable) There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there
'm going, Leon
(she rises, as does Leon, delighted to get rid of her) but before  leave  must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova
Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year
No, last year, madame
Swana sits again, as does Leon
Isn't it amazing
One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia
(cynically) It must be charming
'm glad conditions are so improved
assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances
Exactly
You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia
The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are
You're absolutely right about the Cossacks
We made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts
They had such reliable guns
Leon has grown more and more uncomfortable as the two ladies fence
Will you do me a favor
Stop talking about the good old days
very wise suggestion, Leon
'm afraid madame and  will never agree
(she plays her trump card) The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week
understand everything will be over by Thursday
Am  right
Ninotchka and Leon realize the malice and yet the truth of her words
You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday
(rubbing it in) It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris
(she turns to Leon) Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow
(she rises, Leon rising too) Good night
(Ninotchka nods without answering
To Leon) Good night, Leon
(coldly) Good night, Swana
Swana leaves the table
Leon sits again
The mood of the two has been changed by the problem of their separation, which has been brought before them
They sit in silence for a moment
Ninotchka speaks first
Now  think  need a glass of champagne
Leon fills their glasses
They drink
Then Leon takes Ninotchka's hand
(trying to break the mood) Quickly, please
tell me one of your funny stories
funny story
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names
Well, there were two Scotchmen
One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy
They met on the street
He stops
Go on
No, darling
'll tell you another story, a much better one
(with deep sincerity) The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit
There will be no Thursday for us
Not next week or any week
We won't let it happen
'll tear it out of the calendar
Is that a good story
(touched) Wonderful -- if one could believe it
You must, darling
(lifting her glass) To the loveliest story  ever heard
They drink
The orchestra starts a number
(afraid of where the conversation may lead) Shall we dance
They both start toward the dance floor
--   , At the second turn Ninotchka starts to feel the effect of the champagne
(tipsily) Oo
Darling
Something is the matter
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast
Oh, everything is so wonderful
It's getting farther and farther away
What, darling
Thursday
Yes
Don't worry
Everything will be all right
In the gayest mood, Ninotchka addresses the crowd on the dance floor
Comrades
Comrades
(embarrassed) Darling, darling
please
must talk to my brothers
Shhh
Shhh
Don't shush me
am People
want to make a speech
want to overthrow the Duchess
Leon starts to lead her off the dance floor
But, darling, you can't do that
Comrades
Good people of France
Now, Ninotchka
please
They are all Duchesses here
thousands of Duchesses
and  am going to tell them
By now they have almost reached the powder room
Quite right
yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down
(sweetly) No speech
(as though he were addressing a little child) No speech
love you, my little Leonitchka
And  adore you, Ninotchua
Ninotchka goes unsteadily into the powder room
Leon wipes his forehead in relief and goes to the bar, followed by the (to the bartender) Give me a double brandy
-- group of four to six women come out whispering excitedly about something which must have happened within
goes with them as they go to the Manager of the restaurant and crowd about him and whisper what has happened
-- The bartender gives Leon his double brandy and Leon tosses it off
The Manager comes into the shot and addresses Leon
(very excitedly) 'm very sorry, Count d'Algout, it is most embarrassing, but the lady you brought with you tonight is spreading communistic propaganda in the powder room
Leon stares at him for a second, then turns to the bartender
Give me another double brandy
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike
Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous
What can  do about it
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success
We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself
(horrified) You want me to go in there
'm sorry, sir, but  must insist
The Manager bows and walks away
Leon gulps down the second double brandy
The  follows him as he proceeds toward the powder room like a hero going into battle
Just as he is about to enter, a very dignified elderly lady comes out, is surprised at his attempted entrance, and glares at him
Leon loses his courage and     goes back to the bar to strengthen it with some of the Dutch variety
(completely exhausted -- to the bartender) Make it a triple brandy
As we : -- Rakonin, the waiter, opens the door
Ninotchka and Leon, both very tipsy by now, enter the room
Leon is carrying a bottle of champagne in a napkin
As he passes the waiter he speaks: (to Rakonin) All right
you can tell the Duchess
you can tell everybody
they know anyhow
it doesn't make any difference
now get out
Rakonin, who seems very interested in the situation, closes the door
Leon goes to Ninotchka
Both sit on a couch
(moving close to him) Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart
No
Nobody will find us
Ninotchka is lyrically tight
Through her there shines a great happiness
Are we going to build our little house
Yes
a little white house
Not white, darling
All right, we'll make it red
No, don't let's have it any color
no color
just a house house
let's form our own party
Right: Lovers of the world unite
(delighted) And we won't stretch up our arms
No
No
and we won't clench our fist
No
No
(tenderly) Our salute will be a kiss
Yes
a kiss
salute
She sinks into his arms and they kiss
(still in his arms) am so happy
No one can be so happy without being punished
will be punished and  should be punished
(she gets up) want to confess, darling
know
it's the Russian soul
(her gaiety mixed with sadness) Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess
am a traitor
When  kissed you  betrayed the Russian ideal
Leon,  should be stood up against the wall
Leon gets up
(sympathetically) Would that make you any happier
Much happier
All right
Still carrying the champagne bottle, Leon leads her to the end of the room and stands her against the wall
He takes the napkin from the champagne bottle and puts it over her eyes
The  moves with him as he goes away from Ninotchka, and as he walks he starts to open the champagne
The cork pops
-- , as she sinks gently into a chair
(happily) have paid the penalty
Now let's have some music
-- Let's turn on the radio
Radio
What is radio
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model
(getting up) Oh yes, yes
It has a little knob that turns
a little knob
it must be somewhere around here
yes
here
see
Confusedly Ninotchka starts looking for something, repeating, "a little knob
a little knob
" Followed by Leon she goes toward the safe, opens the concealing door, and both are delighted as they see the safe's dial
(triumphantly) Here it is
Leon nods approval and starts to turn the dial
What shall we get
The news
No, no news
We don't want to know what's happening in the world
We want to be left alone, don't we
Yes, sweetheart
all by ourselves
(remembering vaguely) Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven
Leon follows her instructions
(after a little pause, sadly) It's dead
Well, it has to warm up
you have to give it a chance
just like people
like you and me
first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party
salute
He takes her in his arms and again they embrace
(as though she were in heaven) Now twice to the left and stop at seventeen
Leon again follows her instructions
-- , shooting toward the door
Leon opens the door and both look into the safe
(disappointed) No music
(also disappointed) No, no music
Through her fog, Ninotchka becomes aware of the case containing the jewels
(bitterly) There it is
Thursday
you can't rip it out of the week
(helpfully) But  can throw it out of the window
(philosophically) It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street
(she pushes back the lid) There they are
they are terrible things, those jewels
but big
they are the tears of Old Russia
see that stone
Who cried that one
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great
For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market
Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married
You know that worthless butler of mine
that reactionary
Some day when come home to you  may say, "Darling, drove Gaston to the market and look what  got from him
" From the case of jewels he takes a beautiful diadem and holds it in front of her
(the economist now) First ten thousand serfs
now just Gaston
It is very encouraging
Leon takes her by the hand and leads her from the safe
Come, sweetheart
Let me put it on you
You will teach these jewels
For the first time they will learn how they can look
They belong to the people
(in a ceremonial voice) give them back to the people
(as formal and steady as possible under the conditions he puts the diadem on her head) make you Ninotchka the Great
Duchess of the People
Grand Duchess of the People
Ninotchka falls in with the spirit of this imaginary coronation
Is this the wish of the masses
It is their wish
Thank you, Leon
thank you, masses
(in a low voice) Can  make a speech now
Please
Ninotchka turns to an imaginary assemblage
Comrades
People of the world
The revolution is on the march know
wars will wash over us
bombs will fall
all civilization will crumble
but not yet, please
wait, wait
what's the hurry
(mixing reality with fantasy) Let us be happy
give us our moment
(turning to Leon) We are happy, aren't we, Leon
(fondly) Yes, sweetheart
(he holds her in his arms) (her voice getting dimmer and dimmer) So happy and so tired
She falls asleep in his arms
Leon gathers her up and carries her into the bedroom, the diadem still on her head
-- Leon carries Ninotchka to the bed, puts her down on it
She is now sleeping soundly
He kisses her once more and then turns, the   with him, and starts toward the door to the corridor and exits
As he closes the door with an uncertain hand, it slams
-- , as she lies on the bed On the night table beside her is a photograph of the stern- faced Lenin
The crash of the slamming door awakens Ninotchka for a moment
Completely content and happy, she turns around and sees the disapproving face of the photograph
(charmingly) Smile, little father, smile
The photograph of Lenin starts to smile in approval, as we
: -- : a clock shows that it is a quarter to twelve
: -- It is taken from an  which includes the door
The lights are still on, the curtains drawn, the empty champagne bottle and glasses litter the room
We hear the buzzer of the corridor door ring several times without an answer
moves through the door into the bedroom, never disclosing the bed
The lights in the bedroom are still lighted also and the curtains drawn
stops on the door from the bedroom to the corridor
The buzzer rings
Apparently the caller has moved from the living-room door to the bedroom door
Ninotchka is lying on the bed, still in her evening dress
The diadem is no longer on her head, but no special emphasis is laid on that detail in the camera angle
We hear the sound of the buzzer ringing again and again
Ninotchka half wakens and calls out something which sounds like "come in" without being fully aware of what she is doing
-- The door is opened from the outside by a maid, who lets in the Duchess Swana, dressed in a smart morning outfit
Swana looks around, surprised and amused at the state of the room
She walks over to the bed where lies Ninotchka, still not enough awake to face reality
Swana is delighted to have surprised Ninotchka in this condition
(ironically) Good morning
(awakening gradually) What
It is tomorrow morning
tomorrow noon, to be exact
hope you will forgive me
know it's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour
Don't you recognize me
am the Duchess Swana
By now Ninotchka is awake
She gets up and realizes to her acute embarrassment the condition in which Swana has found her
know how you feel, my dear
The morning after always does look grim if you happen to be wearing last night's dress
Don't be embarrassed by my presence, though
You couldn't have found anybody more sympathetic to your condition
remember once in Petrograd when  felt exactly as you do
had to bow from a balcony to the crowd
My dear, the masses have no understanding of the feelings of a lady before noon
Don't you find that true
During Swana's speech Ninotchka has found herself completely
think we can cut your visit short
Leon is not here
Of course not, my dear
didn't come here with any such suspicion
How ridiculous
(with a glance toward the living room) Nor did  come here to pick up his hat
-- ' , shot through the bedroom door into the living room where it lies on the table
--   -- By the bed stand Ninotchka and Swana
Swana starts toward the living room, Ninotchka following her
(as she reaches the threshold) How stale last night's gaiety looks
It has the taste of a dead cigarette
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night  am afraid you misunderstood my attitude
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough
(during the following speech, she draws the curtains and opens the windows) Do you mind if  let in a little fresh air and sunshine
'm sure it will make you feel better and  want you to be at your very best
In full possession of your faculties, at least
(regaining her usual firmness) Please come to the point
What is it you want
just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you
We have nothing to discuss
Now there you are completely wrong
If we sit down for a little chat, 'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean
" am delighted to have you here" have not reached that stage of civilization
That's all right
grow on people
must ask you to leave
Leave
That's exactly what  came here to ask you to do
Leave
don't mean this hotel and  don't mean Paris
mean France
There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty
(puzzled) Madame, if you
Don't worry
have already made reservations
It's perfect flying weather
They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time
(still not understanding) If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny
Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd
Ninotchka's words for the first time sting Swana out of her apparently superficial attitude
(bitterly) My palace in Petrograd
yes, you took that away from me
You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything  had
(with emphasis) but nothing more --  warn you
(simply) People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one
Not if you have their love
You hadn't
That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow
dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox
It is not enough to be witty, madame
People grow tired of being entertained
You made that mistake before
Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony
My dear, you don't know how impressive could be
Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels
The word diadem startles Ninotchka
She starts to remember the night before, and she looks toward the safe
, which is closed by now
-- Ninotchka stares in the direction of the safe as Swana chatters on
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight
(desperately) must insist that you leave
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow
In that case  can only say good-by
Abruptly she walks toward the bedroom
She enters the small room connecting the living room and bedroom and closes the door to the living room
She walks into the bedroom toward the bed and glances at it
The diadem is not there
After going back into the anteroom, she opens the outer door of the safe and pulls on the inner door
It has not been properly closed and opens at once
The safe is empty
Ninotchka stands staring in frozen horror for a moment, then rushes to the telephone by the bed
(into the telephone) Elysee 2763
--    , waiting for her connection In the background the door to the living room is opened by Swana
(standing in the door) wouldn't waken Leon
After last night  would say not before three o'clock at the earliest
told you to go, madame
Believe me, Leon can't help you
He doesn't know anything about the jewels
give you my word swear it
Ninotchka hangs up the receiver and stares at Swana
She walks toward her
,
In the foreground Swana, in the background Ninotchka, who is hurrying toward her
Where are they
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear
They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with
Where are they
Don't worry
Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open
Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian
(she draws back the fur scarf she is wearing, revealing a diamond star, one of the jewels we have seen) just put this on for sentiment
The rest are absolutely safe
assure you
But if you feel like notifying the police
You leave me no choice
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them
will have to face the consequences, but so will you
Don't forget they will ask how you got them
That's very simple to answer
They were given to me by my mother
They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you
She proceeds into the living room, followed by Ninotchka
They always belonged to the Russian people
They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back
(triumphantly) told you we had plenty to talk about
Shall we sit down
They both sit
(very matter-of-fact) Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way
Our situation has changed considerably
Before  had only a claim to the jewels
Now  have the jewels
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you
all right, then let's deal with legal facts
You know that France has recognized the Soviet
Unfortunately
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State
France is going to uphold that ownership
My lawyer agrees with you
He says France will uphold it in every court, but  will drag you through every court, don't forget that
And when say it will take two years  am, as always, conservative
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you
know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now
may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread
Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait
see
You have calculated in terms of hunger
No,  just wanted to be absolutely impartial
Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years
We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition
Ninotchka now realizes what she is after
Go on
am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow
(quietly) That's not the way to win him back
not Leon
think  know Leon quite as well as you
possibly a little better
Leave that worry to me
Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells
'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and  will also see you to the airport
That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova
Ninotchka knows herself to be faced with an inevitable decision
For a moment she cannot answer
The telephone rings
Ninotchka takes the receiver
(into telephone) Yes
(it is Leon) Oh hello
Much as she wants to talk to him she hesitates in the presence of Swana
Swana realizes the situation, gets up, and walks over to the window, where she stands looking out
- -- Good morning, Leon
(forcing herself to be gay so that he will not suspect anything) no, you didn't waken me
am fine, thank you
Yes, it was
marvelous
What
for luncheon
'm afraid  can't
am going to be very busy
(looking for excuses) well,  have a lot of things to attend to today
What
Well to tell you the truth  am a little tired and  would like to rest
(she forces herself to laugh) you may be right
perhaps it is the champagne
For dinner
Of course
seven o'clock here
(realizing that she will be gone by then) seven o'clock is all right
Where
That will be lovely
Yes
(there is a knock on the door) Come in
(into the telephone) Yes
(looking toward the door she sees something which makes her stop the conversation) Just a moment
(she puts the receiver on the table and walks toward the door) , shooting toward the living room
In the background we see Swana standing at the window
Ninotchka comes into the anteroom, closes the door in order to shut off Swana's view
Camera pans with Ninotchka as she walks toward the hall door where the bellboy is putting down a big flower basket
(to bellboy) You can leave it here
The bellboy exits
Ninotchka looks at the basket of flowers for a moment, then takes the envelope which is attached to the handle
She opens it and reads the enclosed letter
It must be a love note, for her eyes grow wet
She turns to the last page
"
and sweetheart,  have kept my first promise
sent poor old Gaston to the market this morning and if you will look deep into the flowers you will see what  got for him
" -- She puts her hand in the basket and takes out a bottle of milk
On the label we see a picture of a goat
She smiles sadly and goes to the telephone, which is on the console in the anteroom
(into telephone) Operator, will you switch the call please
Hello
Darling, your present just arrived
It's very silly and very wonderful
thank you
No,  won't forget
seven o'clock
(with great tenderness) Good-by, my darling
What
Oh
(softly) salute
She puts down the receiver
Camera pans with her as she goes to the door of the living room
She opens the door and goes in
Swana turns from the window
am sorry to have kept you waiting, madame
-- : shooting from a
We hear the  of an airplane just taking off
Camera pulls back so that Swana seems to be photographed from the airplane
Finally the  discloses the whole airport and Swana disappearing into the crowd
-- ' Swana's maid is opening the door for Swana, who enters in the highest spirits
Good afternoon, Jacqueline
Good afternoon, Your Highness
(hesitantly) Madame,
You didn't find my glove
All right, you're forgiven
Thank you, Your Highness
Count d'Algout is waiting
He's been here some time
Swana inspects herself briefly in the hall mirror, proceeds into the living room
-- ' Leon is pacing up and down
Swana enters
Leon, darling, how nice
Have you ordered tea or a cocktail
No thanks, Swana
Did  act stupidly last night
Should apologize
'm the one who should apologize should have talked to you before
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession
Yes
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman
Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain
It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule
And please don't look so guilty, otherwise 'll
This time, Swana -- just this once -- must ask you to listen
All right, 'll listen
know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, 'm not in the least subtle
Brutal frankness, if you insist
There are a hundred ways to approach it, but  feel it can best be said in one simple phrase
'm in love, Swana
And  thought it was something serious
How could you frighten me so
It must be serious, Swana
Not long ago 'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class
Now  can say it without stammering, without a blush
'm in love, Swana
Say it over and over again, Leon
Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you
have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal
've thought it over and 'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living
Leon
This has the ugly sound of regeneration
'm afraid that's what it is
The same old trouble, Leon
You're always late
Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time
And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again
(she glances at her wrist watch) By about five minutes
What is this, Swana
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service  think  can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow
Has done what
She's gone, Leon
Do you expect me to believe that
Swana picks up the receiver of the telephone and holds it out to him
Here's the telephone
If you call the hotel you will find that you have no seven o'clock appointment
It is flying past the Eiffel Tower
-- Behind the window we see Ninotchka looking at Paris for the last time
Camera moves over to the next window and we see Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski also giving Paris a sad farewell look
, from the air
The mist has closed in by now so that only the top of the Eiffel Tower is visible above it
- -- , looking down on the Tower , Airplane -- Ninotchka, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski Ninotchka turns from the window and leans against the back of her chair
The Russians follow her example
There is a moment of silence and sadness
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower
That's right
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor
While you eat, you look at the view
- -- She is trying to overcome all sentimentality, but as the following speech progresses she cannot escape the personal implication involved
Yes, it is an amazing piece of engineering
Still the most remarkable iron structure in the world
Leading to the top there is a staircase of over a thousand steps
but an elevator is included in the price of admission
: : Camera zooms down on a headline of an article
Mercier buys priceless russian jewels
Russian commission has left for moscow
-- Camera follows Leon as he walks excitedly and nervously along the boulevard
He turns into a Russian Intouriste Bureau, one of the travel bureaus maintained by the Soviet government in foreign countries to supply information regarding travel, give visas, etc
It is a typical travel bureau
Behind the counter are attendants and some people getting information and pamphlets
Leon enters, looks around, and sees a door which says "Visas and Passport Department
" He enters
, It is a room smaller than the previous one
Behind the counter stands a typical Bolshevik Official
In front of the counter is an elderly English lady
Leon takes his place behind her, nervous at having to wait
The Official stamps the English lady's passport and hands it to her
Well, everything is in order
hope you will enjoy your trip to Russia, madame
Thank you
Oh, by the way, 've heard so many rumors about laundry conditions in Russia
Is it advisable to take one's own towels
Certainly not, madame
That's only capitalistic propaganda
We change the towel every week
Oh
thank you
She leaves
Leon moves up to the Official
Yes, please
At this moment the telephone rings
The Official takes the receiver
(into phone) Yes
Comrade Cazabine
No, 'm sorry
he hasn't been with us for six months
He was called back to Russia and was investigated
You can get further details from his widow
He hangs up the receiver
Leon, thinking of Ninotchka, is horrified by this statement
Pardon me,  am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way
Not always
look at me
've been back twice
(he knocks on wood) (his alarm growing) Here's my passport
Please give me a visa
have to leave for Russia immediately
(reading passport) Count Leon d'Algout
a count
a nobleman
Don't hold that against me
please
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia
Business
What business
Private
There is no privacy in Russia
This whole thing seems very suspicious
What's the real reason
If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice
confess
(dismayed) Confess what
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians
On the contrary --  don't want to have anything to do with them
You believe in our cause
Leon, feeling that he has to go to the rescue of his girl, whips up an enormous enthusiasm for the cause
Oh
think it's great
Everyone works -- everyone contributes -- that's what  want to do -- work make my own bed -- you can call up my butler
don't believe in the right of the individual
like the Bolshevik ideal -- everyone being the same
You just like me -- me just like you --  use your comb -- you use my toothbrush -- oh, it's a great life
Please
give me that visa
At this moment Swana enters
Hello, Leon darling
(startled) Hello
(suavely) After our talk last night took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning
Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia,  thought  might be of some assistance to you
(to the Official) May  introduce myself
am the Duchess Swana of Russia
another Russia
The Official gasps in surprise
Now, please, Swana
(to the Official) Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him 'll be delighted
(bitterly) That does it, Swana
(he leads her toward the door) Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser
(stopping at the door) Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia  want you to know that  have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little chateau in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change
Thank you, Swana
You are very gracious
His words are unmistakably a final dismissal
She walks out
Leon looks after her for a second, then goes back to the Official
He tries to laugh off the incident
She must have her little joke
(the Official responds with a stony look) You're not going to take that seriously
The Grand Duchess Swana
active in the White Russian movement
Believe me,  have no connection with her any longer
swear haven't
But you had
Listen,  want to be absolutely frank with you
have no business in Moscow
think so too
want to see a friend of mine
a very dear friend
It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies
It's a girl
So it's love which drags you to Moscow
Yes
No visa
(fighting for his point) must get into that country of yours
Oh no
No visa
(more aggressively) That's impossible
Nobody has the right
You can't do that
If you don't give me that visa
(ironically) You're going to force us
huh
(growing violent) Now look here
you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out
Why should  take a chance
On what
How do  know you don't want to blow up a factory
What for
why
Or a tunnel or a bridge
Suspicions
nothing but suspicions
That's the trouble with you
If you don't let me in 'll stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from Russia
'll picket your whole country
The Official laughs in a superior way
'll boycott you, that's what 'm going to do
No more vodka
no more caviar
no more Tchaikovsky
no more borscht
Wait a minute, know something better than that
The Official leans forward sarcastically
What
With a knock-out blow, Leon sends him to the floor, then, leaning over the counter, he shouts
And you can tell the Kremlin that's just the beginning
He strides out
The Official's head emerges from the counter
As he adjusts his bruised jaw, he speaks
No visa
Establishing Shot of Russia -- First of May -- Stock Shot of May Day Parade on the Red Square : : March, march, march
Comrades of the World, never has there been such a May Day parade as this
Already for four hours the pavements of Moscow have resounded to the tread of a million boots
Thousands of gun- carriages have thundered past
Thousands of tanks, combined with our mighty air force, have demonstrated to a belligerent neighbor that we are ready and invincible
Now past me marches the great army of our civilians
Men and women of all ages
All servants of the State united in one thought and ideal
Group of Several Units Marching Workmen, soldiers, tanks, airplanes, etc
: Column of Women, dressed in typical Russian May Day parade fashion, marching and saluting
The    to a Ninotchka marching with the others
All her individuality is gone
She is one of many, a cog in the Russian machine
With a stern expression she is looking straight ahead when suddenly something attracts her attention and she glances to one side
Column of Male Workers is coming in the opposite direction
Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski are recognizable among them
-- , ,
All three are already pretty exhausted from the long march
Kopalski sees Ninotchka
He whispers it to the others
The three look toward Ninotchka and lift their shoulders with a gesture which says, "Look where we are now
" -- , answering them with a sad smile
After they have passed she stares straight forward again with the same stern expression
: --   ' It is an overcrowded house
People are walking up and down stairs, standing grouped in front of the various apartments; children are sliding down the banisters and playing games under the feet of the adults
Ninotchka trudges upstairs wearily
Camera pans with her as she goes into an apartment which is divided into several sub- apartments
Finally she opens the door of her own room and goes in
' It is a comparatively small room, which she shares with two other girls
As she enters only one girl is present
It is Anna, a cello player, who sits on the edge of her bed practicing on her cello
Apparently Ninotchka has not adjusted herself completely to the Moscow which she once thought so great
Good evening, Anna
Good evening, Ninotchka
Aren't you late
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade
During the following scene Anna puts her cello in its case and gets ready to go to her job
Ninotchka starts to arrange the table in the center of the floor for a party of four
Out of her cupboard she takes very primitive-looking dishes, a flower pot, glasses, and a kind of shawl which serves as a tablecloth
Didn't you march
Anna is apparently not a fanatical believer in the Bolshevik regime and takes a cynical and humorous attitude toward it
They didn't let me
am in disgrace
Last week at the performance of Carmen played a sour note
The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section
" Too bad
you missed an inspiring day, Anna
know
my heart is sad
but my feet are happy
When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square  sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata
Not bad at all
(she has noticed Ninotchka's preparations) Are you expecting someone
few friends
just a little dinner party
What are you serving
An omelet
(puzzled) An omelet
Aren't you living a little above your ration
Well, 've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage
It just goes to prove the theory of our State
If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet
(devilishly) That reminds me
have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin
At this moment a door to one of the adjoining rooms opens and Gurganov, a middle-aged man with a sour stool-pigeon expression, walks quietly through the room to another door, taking in the girls with one sly glance and giving the impression that not only his eyes but his ears are open
Anna breaks off her remark
(whispering) 'll tell you later
(after Gurganov has disappeared into the other room she continues) That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police
You should be more careful, Anna
And you too, Ninotchka
(amazed) About what
Ever since you have been back from Paris
haven't talked to anyone about Paris
haven't said a word
That's just it
It makes people feel queer
dont' want you to get in any trouble
have nothing to hide
You should
'll show you
She walks over to her cupboard and takes out a piece of lingerie and comes back to Ninotchka with it
When  passed through the laundry yard today  saw all the women huddled around this so  brought it up here
Things like this create a bad feeling
First they didn't know whose it was
Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion
Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline
It undermines our whole cause
(aware of the pettiness which surrounds her) see
You know how it is today
all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution
Thank you, Anna
'll dry it up here when  wash it next
should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear
(confidentially) Ninotchka, you know  am your friend, you can trust me
Did you bring back anything else
Ninotchka suddenly is transported to Paris in her memory
(with feeling) No,  left everything in Paris just happened to be wearing this
Tell me
what else did you have
(enjoying the thought) Well, a hat
What was it like
It was very silly
would be ashamed to wear it here
As beautiful as that
What else
Come, tell me
An evening gown
(puzzled) Evening gown
dress you wear in the evening
What do you wear in the morning
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day
Yes
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating
No, my dear, it is true
That's how they live in the other world
Here we dress to have our bodies covered
to keep warm
And there
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but
they don't freeze
(fingering the piece of lingerie) They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft
something you don't even see
You feel it, though
(hesitantly) Ninotchka,  wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends
What is it, Anna
You know  told you that Pavlov and are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers
Would it be asking too much
You want this
Just for the honeymoon
You can have it for good
It is my wedding present
Anna is for a moment speechless over this generous gift
She embraces and kisses Ninotchka
Ninotchka
Ninotchka
She kisses her again, takes her cello, and starts to leave
Am  going to play that cadenza tonight
Anna exits, closing the door
Ninotchka is left alone
Her thoughts are still in the other world, obviously with Leon
Mechanically she looks over the table to see if everything is all right, then she walks over to the radio (a primitive little machine)
As she turns the knob she smiles again reminiscently
As she does, the blare of a Russian speech brings her back to reality
Individuals
Yes, as atoms in the cosmos of Soviet Russia
Family
Yes
One great family of one hundred and sixty million, struggling, fighting, victorious Russian proletarians
Thus shall we pursue our way into the future, fists clenched, hearts encased in steel armed against bourgeois sentimentality and
Quickly she turns the knob and again there is a burst of Russian oratory
From the Exploiters for the Toilers
We are going full steam ahead through industrialization toward socialism
Let us put the Union of Socialistic Soviet Republics into an automobile and the muzhik into a tractor, and then let the capitalists try to keep up with us
The same thing happens for a third time
and thirty million peasants, eighty-five per cent of the population owned three hundred forty-three million four hundred and sixty-nine thousand acres of land, sixty-five per cent of the total area
And one hundred and fifty thousand nobles possessed thirty-five per cent of the country's natural wealth
Ninotchka turns off the radio
She closes her eyes for a moment and with a sad smile murmurs to herself
No music
At this moment the door opens, and Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski enter
There follow warm greetings between Ninotchka and the Three Russians
Ninotchka
Ninotchka
moment of silence follows
The four look at each other as people do who share a secret
(with great warmth) How are you, you three scoundrels
(wryly) Well, we're back home
(sourly) You know what they say -- there's nothing like home
That's right
and we might as well face it
(trying not to say what she feels) Come, now, you must not talk that way
You have to adjust yourselves
We must be brave
Brave
that's right
Let's be happy that we're all alive
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened
can tell you exactly
Now let's forget everything except that we're together
That's right
Let's do that
(falling in with her attempt) It's a real Paris reunion
If you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in Paris
Let's not close our eyes
There are many good things to see here too
(cynically) think  need my glasses
(reprimanding him quietly) little more tact
look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us
(in a loud voice, trying to make up for his faux pas) How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka
What a lovely room you have here
How many families live here with you
Only myself and two other girls
One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor
(impressed) Just three people in a room this size
Whew
(inspecting the room) And your own gas cooker
That's marvelous
(forgetting himself) Naturally it's not the Royal Suite
Sssh
Once and for all, we're in Moscow
(walking over to the window) Yes, there's no doubt of that
(sarcastically) Just look out of the window and there it is
And it's great
Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now
Iranoff and Buljanoff have joined them at the window
She's right
(under his breath) anyhow let's talk ourselves into it
Just see how happy the people look
from here
Can you blame them
at least the May Day parade is over
That's another thing
it's spring
The same spring we had in Paris
Just as good
Even the swallows are back
Yes, that's right
Maybe that's the same swallow we saw in Paris
It is, Ninotchka
It is
He must have been in Paris
You can see it in his whole attitude
He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it
If you asked him why he left France bet he couldn't name one good reason
should be a swallow
Right now would be sitting in front of the Cafe de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill
Now, comrades
there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry
(the realist) Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel
We will get that
we'll get everything
maybe a little bit later but we'll get it
We must be patient
Finally we got the spring, didn't we
We got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too
(consolingly) And if it is too late for you your children will eat it
(breaking the mood) Let's forget the future
let's stop being sentimental
let's start that omelet
That's right
(he takes a little box out of his pocket) Here's my egg
(he hands it to Ninotchka) Iranoff unties his egg from his handkerchief
And here's mine
He hands it to Ninotchka
Buljanoff reaches in his pocket and from his expression we see that a catastrophe must have happened
Comrades
'm out of the omelet
Don't worry
there will be enough
Come, Ninotchka, let's make it in real Parisian style
The group all go to the gas cooker and Ninotchka starts to make the omelet
The others stand around as though they were watching a great event
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes
des raisins de Madere, des framboises
(
with grapes of Madeira, with raspberries
) des petites fraises des bois
de la creme de Bretagne
(
with small wild strawberries
with cream
) so it blows up that big
what they call an Omelette Surprise
And the surprise is there's nothing in it
know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination
(he raises his voice) In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris
The door through which Gurganov disappeared opens and Gurganov comes out
(seeing him) Sssh
The conversation stops
Gurganov walks quietly through the room, again observing everything
He goes out at last
man like that
all he has to do is to walk through a room and the omelet drops
There is a dead silence
All are again aware of the reality which surrounds
They concentrate quietly on the frying pan
: The eggs are gradually taking the shape of an omelet
: Only the last scraps of the omelet are on it
Buljanoff's hand comes in with a big piece of bread with which he sops up every fragment that is left
: -- '  -- The curtains are drawn and the lamp lighted
All four are sitting around the table, in the center of which is a samovar
In front of each of them is a glass of tea
One of the Russians is playing a balalaika and all are singing gaily, "Paris
" Ninotchka is enjoying their companionship
After a little while the door to the corridor opens and Ninotchka's other roommate, the street-car conductor, strides in
She is a squareset, unfriendly woman in uniform
At sight of her one of the Russians nudges Ninotchka, makes the gesture of ringing up a fare, and accompanies it with an inquiring look
Ninotchka nods
The Russians change their tune quickly to the "Volga Boatman" in order not to awaken animosity
The street-car conductor goes to her bed and starts to take off her shoes and her coat, then draws the curtain
During the following scene we hear the splash of water and the sound of gargling
Again Gurganov crosses the room, this time accompanied by his little son
Suddenly the door is opened by Vladimir, a friendly old man
(calling into the room) Comrade Yakushova, here, the postman left a letter for you
He hands her a letter and exits
-- She takes the letter, glances at the envelope, and is stunned
She turns the envelope -- an expression of breathless wonder comes over her face
What is it, Ninotchka
It's from Paris
From Paris
bill
From Leon
From Leon
How is he
Come, tell us
open it
tell us
how is he
Ninotchka sits in the chair nearest the lamp
All three are looking over her shoulder
Ninotchka hesitates to open the letter, obviously wanting to read it all by herself
Realizing her feelings, the Three Russians walk to the far end of the room and sit down on a little bench, looking toward Ninotchka with childlike expectancy
In great anticipation Ninotchka opens the letter
She starts to read it
Suddenly her expression changes to one of terrific disappointment
She turns the letter over, glances at the second page, then puts the letter down on the table
The Russians have followed her expression closely
Slowly they walk over to her
(very sympathetic) Bad news
Look for yourselves
Iranoff picks up the letter
All three look at it
Insert of First Page of Letter, held in Iranoff's hand
In Leon's handwriting we read: "Ninotchka, my darling," The rest of the writing is blocked out, line by line, and across the page is a big stamp which says "Censored
" Iranoff's hand turns the page
The second page is also censored except for the final words, "Yours, Leon
" Iranoff puts the letter back on the table
They all understand and realize that Ninotchka wants to be alone
Well,  think it's getting late
Good night, Ninotchka
Thank you for a wonderful dinner
Ninotchka rises and shakes their hands
(with great warmth) Good night, my friends
The three start to leave but Buljanoff returns and whispers to Ninotchka
They can't censor our memories, can they
Ninotchka presses his hand
He walks quietly out with the others
Ninotchka, left alone, sits down
She is heartbroken
Her thoughts are too sad and too far away to be disturbed by the snoring which comes from the corner where the street-car conductor has gone to bed
: --    ' : shooting from the inside
Through the window the background of Moscow
It is winter and snow is on the roofs
The and discloses Razinin sitting at his desk, reading a report with a stern expression
-- ' Ninotchka enters carrying several folders
She walks to Razinin's desk and stands waiting for him to recognize her presence
She is a tired, stern girl
Razinin looks up
Good morning, Comrade
(very businesslike) Good morning, Comrade Commissar
Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces
Yes, it does
You mean you have finished the whole investigation
Yes
That's marvelous
You must have worked day and night
Don't you ever sleep
need very little sleep
We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange
have already started a survey of our most urgent needs
Well, Comrade,  am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else
(startled) May  ask why
Please
sit down
Ninotchka sits
Cigarette
Thank you
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff
No
haven't either, but 've heard about them
You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that  sent them to Constantinople; without that  never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal
May  ask what has happened
As soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance
If  told you what's going on in Constantinople right now you wouldn't believe it
Those three have been sitting there for six weeks and haven't sold a piece of fur
(he points to the folder) This anonymous report was sent me
They are dragging the good name of our country through every cafe and night club
Here
(he reads from the report) "How can the Bolshevik cause gain respect among the Moslems if your three representatives, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski, get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it didn't fly
" Ninotchka has to suppress a smile of amusement at the antics of her three old friends
Oh, they shouldn't do such things
Are you sure this report is correct
It gives details which couldn't be invented
Naturally  want to verify it and that's why  need you
(apprehensively) You want me to go to Constantinople
Yes
leaving immediately
(her one object to escape the mission) appreciate the confidence you show in me, but  must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission should hate to interrupt my present work
am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne
(austerely) That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova
am sorry,  don't want to overstep my position -- but please
don't send me
don't understand
(making a last effort) How can  make myself clear
It is difficult to express but 'd rather not go to foreign countries any more
Please, Comrade
let me stay here
let me finish my work
am in the rhythm of it now
don't want to go away
don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again
It throws one out of gear
Let me finish my work
have concentrated everything in it
Please
don't make me go
Please don't waste my time, Comrade
Do your duty
Good-by
will do my best
She exits, as we : , on a bright sunlit day, if possible with the circling shadow of an airplane
: --   , shooting from an airplane angle
crowd is awaiting the arrival of a plane
The  goes down to a   of Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski, standing in the crowd
All three are very elegantly and gaily dressed
They are in the happiest mood
One of them carries a large bouquet of flowers to greet Ninotchka
: Its style should suggest the locale
Ninotchka enters with the Three Russians, who are very happy to have her with them again
(indicating the room) How do you like it, Ninotchka
Isn't it wonderful
Tell us
tell us
Ninotchka protests, but during the whole scene it is evident that behind her protestations there is none of the force and conviction she displayed in a similar situation in the Royal Suite
But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows
You've done it again and  am responsible
How can you forget yourselves this way
You were sent here to make money, not to spend it
Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas
It is high time you got out of Russia
(not knowing what to do with the three rascals) must be stern with you
(delighted) That's our old Ninotchka
(agreeing with him) Yes, yes
Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin
(cockily) Good old Razinin
Is he still alive
How does he manage
But, Comrades
(with the happiness of being free again in his voice) We are not comrades any more
we are friends, Ninotchka
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer
We can say whatever we want
We can shout
we can complain
Look
(he opens the door leading to corridor) The service in this hotel is terrible
(he closes the door) See
Nobody comes
nobody pays any attention
That's freedom
(dryly) No, that's bad management
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment
must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka
There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it
" And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses
" With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats
(helplessly) Friends
friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff
(afraid of being left out) and Kopalski
(pleadingly) Don't make it difficult for me
This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you
That was our idea when we first came
All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but
we learned better
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp
Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves
into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights
All you have to do is say "open sesame
" don't know how  can get you out of it this time
How will it end
What will happen to you
(intimately) Shall we tell her
Yes
(proudly) Ninotchka,  hope you'll be our guest
Guest
We have opened a restaurant
we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski
" You mean you are deserting Russia
(singing the song of freedom) Don't call it desertion
Our little restaurant
that is our Russia
the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream
the Russia of piroshki
people will eat and love it
We are not only serving good food, we are serving our country
we are making friends
(completely bewildered) Who gave you this idea
What is responsible for all this
(with a gleam in his eye) There's something in Constantinople
something irresistible
it is in the air
it may come around the corner as you walk down the street
it may step out of a bazaar
it may wait for you in a corridor
it may hide in the shadow of a minaret
(pointing to the balcony) Right now it's on the balcony
Ninotchka looks toward the balcony and is dumbfounded as she sees Leon standing there smiling at her
He walks quietly toward her
(looking longingly at Ninotchka) They wouldn't let me in so  had to get you out
(still taken aback) So -- you're behind all this
should have known
Leon takes her hand and kisses it
The Three Russians exchange glances
The     --leaving Ninotchka and Leon as Russians walk discreetly out of the room and close the door behind them
-- Trying to keep me away from you
It couldn't be done
Naturally  couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but  found a way, didn't
Darling,  had to see you
wrote and wrote but all my letters came back
The one  got they wouldn't let me read
(carried away by emotion) It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon
" (with great feeling and sincerity) won't tell you what came between
'll prove it
It will take a long time, Ninotchka
at least a lifetime
Ninotchka is aware that she is facing a decision
She knows what she wants but still tries to evade a definite answer
But, Leon,  am only here for a few days
If you don't stay with me, 'll have to continue my fight
'll travel wherever Russian commissions are
'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis
The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants
'll depopulate Russia
Once you saved your country by going back
This time you can save it by staying here
Well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can  waver
No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian
