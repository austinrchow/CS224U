Screenplay by Richard Curtis -------------------------------------------------------------- Title 'She' plays through the credits
Exquisite footage of Anna Scott -- the great movie star of our time -- an ideal -- the perfect star and woman -- her life full of glamour and sophistication and mystery
- Mix through to William, 35, relaxed, pleasant, informal
We follow him as he walks down Portobello Road, carrying a load of bread
It is spring
(
) Of course, 've seen her films and always thought she was, well, fabulous -- but, you know, million miles from the world  live in
Which is here -- Notting Hill -- not a bad place to be
- It's a full fruit market day
(
) There's the market on weekdays, selling every fruit and vegetable known to man
- man in denims exits the tattoo studio
(
) The tattoo parlour -- with a guy outside who got drunk and now can't remember why he chose ' Love Ken'
- (
) The racial hair-dressers where everyone comes out looking like the Cookie Monster, whether they like it or not
Sure enough, a girl exits with a huge threaded blue bouffant
- (
) Then suddenly it's the weekend, and from break of day, hundreds of stalls appears out of nowhere, filling Portobello Road right up to Notting Hill Gate
frantic crowded Portobello market
(
) and thousands of people buy millions of antiques, some genuine
The camera finally settles on a stall selling beautiful stained glass windows of various sizes, some featuring biblical scenes and saints
(
) and some not so genuine
- (
) And what's great is that lots of friends have ended up in this part of London -- that's Tony, architect turned chef, who recently invested all the money he ever earned in a new restaurant
Shot of Tony proudly setting out a board outside his restaurant, the sign still being painted
He receives and approves a huge fresh salmon
- (
) So this is where  spend my days and years -- in this small village in the middle of a city -- in a house with a blue door that my wife and bought together
before she left me for a man who looked like Harrison Ford, only even handsomer
We arrive outside his blue-doored house just off Portobello
(
) and where  now lead a strange half-life with a lodger called
'  - Spike
The house has far too many things in it
Definitely two- bachelor flat
Spike appears
An unusual looking fellow
He has unusual hair, unusual facial hair and an unusual Welsh accent: very white, as though his flesh has never seen the sun
He wears only shorts
Even he
Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt
That's right -- 'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and just want to be sure 've picked the right t-shirt
What are the choices
Well
wait for it
(He pulls on a t-shirt) First there's this one
The t-shirt is white with a horrible looking plastic alien coming out of it, jaws open, blood everywhere
It says ' Love Blood
' Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note
Point taken
He heads back up the stairs
talks as he changes
suspect you'll prefer the next one
And he re-enters in a white t-shirt, with a large arrow, pointing down to his flies, saying, 'Get It Here
' Cool, huh
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind
Wouldn't want that
(and back up he goes) Okay -- just one more
He comes down wearing it
Lots of hearts, saying, 'You're the most beautiful woman in the world
' Well, yes, that's perfect
Well done
Thanks
Great
Wish me luck
Good luck
Spike turns and walks upstairs proudly
Revealing that on the back of the t-shirt, also printed in big letters, is written 'Fancy a fuck
' - (
) And so it was just another hopeless Wednesday, as  set off through the market to work, little suspecting that this was the day which would change my life forever
This is work, by the way, my little travel book shop
small unpretentious store
named 'The Travel Book Co
' (
) which, well, sells travel books -- and, to be frank with you, doesn't always sell many of those
William enters
- It is a small shop, slightly chaotic, bookshelves everywhere, with little secret bits round corners with even more books
Martin, William's sole employee, is waiting enthusiastically
He is very keen, an uncrushable optimist
Perhaps without cause
few seconds later, William stands gloomily behind the desk
Classic
Absolutely classic
Profit from major sales push -- minus $
r(J347
Shall  go get a cappuccino
Ease the pain
Yes, better get me a half
All  can afford
get your logic
Demi-capu coming up
He salutes and bolts out the door -- as he does, a woman walks in
We only just glimpse her
Cut to William working
He looks up casually
And sees something
His reaction is hard to read
After a pause
Can  help you
It is Anna Scott, the biggest movie star in the world -- here -- in his shop
The most divine, subtle, beautiful woman on earth
When she speaks she is very self-assured and self-contained
No, thanks
'll just look around
Fine
She wanders over to a shelf as he watches her -- and picks out a quite smart coffee table book
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying
You'd be wasting your money
Really
Yes
This one though is
very good
He picks up a book on the counter
think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps
There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab
Thanks
'll think about it
William suddenly spies something odd on the small  monitor beside him
If you could just give me a second
Her eyes follow him as he moves toward the back of the shop and approaches a man in slightly ill-fitting clothes
Excuse me
Yes
Bad news
What
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop
So
So,  saw you put that book down your trousers
What book
The one down your trousers
haven't got a book down my trousers
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse
tell you what -- 'll call the police -- and,  what can say
-- If 'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, really apologize
Okay -- what if  did have a book down my trousers
Well, ideally, when  went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it
See you in a sec
He returns to his desk
In the monitor we just glimpse, as does William, the book coming out of the trousers and put back on the shelves
The thief drifts out towards the door
Anna, who has observed all this, is looking at a blue book on the counter
Sorry about that
No, that's fine
was going to steal one myself but now 've changed my mind
Signed by the author,  see
Yes, we couldn't stop him
If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune
She smiles
Suddenly the thief is there
Excuse me
Yes
Can  have your autograph
What's your name
Rufus
She signs his scruffy piece of paper
He tries to read it
What does it say
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail
' Nice one
Would you like my phone number
Tempting but
no, thank you
Thief leaves
think  will try this one
She hands William a $
r(J20 note and the book he said was rubbish
He talks as he handles the transaction
Oh -- right -- on second thoughts maybe it wasn't that bad
Actually -- it's a sort of masterpiece really
None of those childish kebab stories you get in so many travel books these days
And 'll throw in one of these for free
He drops in one of the signed books
Very useful for lighting fires, wrapping fish, that sort of things
She looks at him with a slight smile
Thanks
And leaves
She's out of his life forever
William is a little dazed
Seconds later Martin comes back in
Cappuccino as ordered
Thanks
don't think you'll believe who was just in here
Who
Someone famous
But William's innate natural English discretion takes over
No
No-one -- no-one
They set about drinking their coffees
Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it
Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually --  once saw Ringo Starr
Or at least  think it was Ringo
It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy
Topol
That's right -- Topol
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol
No, well
he was quite a long way away
So it could have been neither of them
suppose so
Right
It's not a classic anecdotes, is it
Not classic, no
Martin shakes his head
William drains his cappuccino
Right -- want another one
Yes
No, wait -- let's go crazy -- 'll have an orange juice
- William sets off
- William collects his juice in a coffee shop on Westbourne Park Road
- William swings out of the little shop -- he turns the corner of Portobello Road and bumps straight into Anna
The orange juice,  in its foam cup, flies
It soaks Anna
Oh Jesus
Here, let me help
He grabs some paper napkins and starts to clean it off -- getting far too near her breasts in the panic of it
What are you doing
He jumps back
Nothing, nothing
Look,  live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up
No thank you
need to get my car back
also have a phone
'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again
in the non-prostitute sense obviously
In his diffident way, he is confident, despite her being genuinely annoyed
She turns and looks at him
Okay
So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards
Eighteen yards
That's my house there
He doesn't lie -- it is eighteen yards away
She looks down
She looks up at him
'  -  - They enter
She carries a few stylish bags
Come on in
'll just
William runs in further -- it's a mess
He kicks some old shoes under the stairs, bins an unfinished pizza and hides a plate of breakfast in a cupboard
She enters the kitchen
It's not that tidy,  fear
And he guides her up the stairs, after taking the bag of books from her
The bathroom is right at the top of the stairs and there's a phone on the desk up there
She heads upstairs
- William is tidying up frantically
Then he hears Anna's feet on the stairs
She walks down, wearing a short, sparkling black top beneath her leather jacket
With her trainers still on
He is dazzled by the sight of her
Would you like a cup of tea before you go
No thanks
Coffee
No
Orange juice -- probably not
He moves to his very empty fridge -- and offers its only contents
Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest
Really, no
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them
No
Do you always say 'no' to everything
Pause
She looks at him deep
No
(pause) better be going
Thanks for your help
You're welcome and, may  also say
heavenly
It has taken a lot to get this out loud
He is not a smooth- talking man
Take my one chance to say it
After you've read that terrible book, you're certainly not going to be coming back to the shop
She smiles
She's cool
Thank you
Yes
Well
My pleasure
He guides her towards the door
Nice to meet you
Surreal but nice
In a slightly awkward moment, he shows her out the door
He closes the door and shakes his head in wonder
Then
'Surreal but nice
'  What was thinking
He  shakes his head again in horror and wanders back along the corridor in silence
There's a knock on the door
He moves back, casually
Coming
He opens the door
It's her
Oh hi
Forget something
forgot my bag
Oh right
He shoots into the kitchen and picks up the forgotten shopping bag
Then returns and hands it to her
Here we go
Thanks
Well
They stand in that corridor -- in that small space
Second time saying goodbye
strange feeling of intimacy
She leans forward and she kisses him
Total silence
real sense of the strangeness of those lips, those famous lips on his
They part
apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment
Disaster
Don't worry about it
thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint
Suddenly there is a clicking of a key in the lock
Oh my God
My flatmate
'm sorry -- there's no excuse for him
Spike walks in
Hi
Hi
Hi
Spike walks past unsuspiciously and heads into the kitchen
'm just going to go into the kitchen to get some food -- and then 'm going to tell you a story that will make your balls shrink to the size of raisins
And leaves them in the corridor
Probably best not tell anyone about this
Right
No one
mean, 'll tell myself sometimes but
don't worry --  won't believe it
Bye
And she leaves, with just a touch of William's hand
Spike comes out of the kitchen, eating something white out of a styrofoam container with a spoon
There's something wrong with this yogurt
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise
Well, there you go
(takes another big spoonful) On for a video fest tonight
've got some absolute classic
'   - The lights are off
William and Spike on the couch, just the light from the  playing on their faces
Cut to the  full screen
There is Anna
She is in a stylish Woody Allen type modern romantic comedy, 'Gramercy Park,' in black and white
- Anna's character -- Woody Anna -- is walking around the gallery with her famous co-star, Michael
They should be the perfect couple, but there is tension
Anna is not happy
Smile
No
Smile
've got nothing to smile about
Okay in about 7 seconds, 'm going to ask you to marry me
And after a couple of seconds -- wow -- she smiles
'   - Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her
Yes, she is fairly fabulous
- The next day
William and Martin quietly co-existing
An annoy- ing customer enters
Mr
Smith
Do you have any books by Dickens
No, we're a travel bookshop
We only sell travel books
Oh right
How about that new John Grisham thriller
No, that's a novel too
Oh right
Have you got a copy of 'Winnie the Pooh'
Pause
Martin -- your customer
Can  help you
William looks up
At that moment the entire window is suddenly taken up by the huge side of a bus, obscuring the light -- and entirely covered with a portrait of Anna -- from her new film, 'Helix
' '  - /  - William heads upstairs and pauses
Spike coming down, wearing full body scuba diving gear
Hey
Hi
'  - The two of them fixing a cup of tea in the kitchen
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that
Ahm -- combination of factors really
No clean clothes
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes
Right
Vicious circle
And then  was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and  thought -- cool
Kind of spacey
'  - The two of them on the rooftop terrace, passing the day
William is reading 'The bookseller
'  The terrace is small and the plants aren't great -- but it overlooks London in a rather wonderful way
Spike still in scuba gear, goggles on
There's something wrong with the goggles though
No, they were prescription, so  could see all the fishes properly
Groovy
You should do more of this stuff
So -- any messages
Yeh,  wrote a couple down
Two
That's it
You want me to write down all your messages
William closes his eyes in exasperation
Who were the ones you didn't write down from
Ahm let's see -- ahm
No
Gone completely
Oh no, wait
There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again
Right
No one else
Absolutely not
Spike leans back and relaxes
Though if we're going for this obsessive writing-down-all-messages thing -- some American girl called Anna called a few days ago
William freezes -- then looks at Spike
What did she say
Well, it was genuinely bizarre
she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name
Which was
Absolutely no idea
Remembering one name's bad enough
'   - William on the phone
We hear the formal man at the other end of the phone
And then intercut with him
Hello
(
) May  help you, sir
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation
'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you
- 'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir
No, that's right --  know that
She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake
' (cont'd) Imagine if you will the stupidest person you've ever met -- are you doing that
Spike happens to be in the foreground of this shot
He's read- ing a newspaper
Yes, sir
have him in my mind
And then double it -- and that is the -- what can  say -- git 'm living with and he cannot remember
Try 'Flintstone
' (to Spike) What
think she said her name was 'Flintstone
' Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you
'll put you right through, sir
Flintstone is indeed the magic word
Oh my God
He practices how to sound
Hello
Hi
Hi
(
) Hi
We hear her voice -- don't see her
(caught out) Oh hi
It's William Thacker
We, ahm  work in a bookshop
(
) You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call
No, 've never played anything cool in my entire life
Spike, who 'll stab to death later, never gave me the message
(
) Oh -- Okay
Perhaps  could drop round for tea or something
(
) Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but
okay, let's give it a try
Four o'clock could be good
Right
Great
(he hangs up) Classic
Classic
- William jumps off a bus and walks toward the Ritz
He carries a small bunch of roses
- He approaches the lifts
At the lift, he pushes the button and the doors open
As he is getting in, William is joined by a young man
His name is Tarquin
Which floor
Three
William pushes the button
They wait for the doors to close
- The lift lands
William gets out
So does Tarquin
Rooms 30-35 are to the left
35-39 to the right
William heads right
So does Tarquin
William is puzzled
He slows down as he approaches room 38
So does Tarquin
William spots, so does Tarquin
William points at the number
Are you sure you
Yes
Oh
Right
He knocks
bright, well-tailored American girl opens the door
Hello, 'm Karen
Sorry -- things are running a bit late
Here's the thing
She hands them a very slick, expensively produced press kits, with the poster picture of Anna, for the film 'Helix
' - - few seconds later -- they enter the main waiting room
There are a number of journalists waiting for their audience
What did you think of the film
Marvellous
'Close Encounters' meets 'Jean De Florette
'  Oscar- winning stuff
They both turn to William for his opinion
agree
'm sorry
didn't get down what magazines you're from
'Time Out
' Great
And you
(seeing it on a coffee table) 'Horse and Hound
'  The name's William Whacker
think she might be expecting me
Okay -- take a seat
'll check
They sit down as Karen goes off
You've brought her flowers
William goes for the cover-up
No -- they're
for my grandmother
She's in a hospital nearby
Thought 'd kill two birds with one stone
'm sorry
Which hospital
Pause
He's in trouble
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away
Oh sure
Of course
Mr
Thacker
Saved by the bell
- You've got five minutes
He is shown in through big golden doors
Karen stays outside
- There Anna is, framed in the window
Glorious
Hi
Hello
brought these, but clearly
There are lots of other flowers in the room
Oh no, ho -- these are great
fair amount of tension
These two people hardly know each other -- and the first and last time they met, they kissed
Sorry about not ringing back
The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect
No, it's a stupid privacy thing always choose a cartoon character -- last time out,  was Mrs
Bambi
At which moment Jeremy, Karen's boss, comes in
fairly grave, authoritative fifty-year-old  man consulting a list
Everything okay
Yes, thanks
And you are from 'Horse and Hound' magazine
William nods
Is that so
William shrugs his shoulders
Jeremy settles at a little desk in the corner and makes notes
pause
William feels he has to act the part
They sit in chairs opposite each other
So 'll just fire away, shall
Anna nods
Right
Ahm
the film's great
and  just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more
horses in it
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space
Obviously
Very difficult
Jeremy leaves
William puts his head in his hands
He was panic
'm sorry --  arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- didn't know what to do
No, it's my fault,  thought this would all be over by now
just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing
seriously don't know what got in to me
just wanted to make sure you were fine about it
Absolutely fine about it
Re-enter Jeremy
Do remember that Miss Scott is also keen to talk about her next project, which is shooting later in the summer
Oh yes -- excellent
Ahm -- any horses in that one
Or hounds, of course
Our readers are equally intrigued by both species
It takes place on a submarine
Yes
Right
But if there were horses, would you be riding them yourself or would you be getting a stunt horse person double sort of thing
Jeremy exits
'm just a complete moron
Sorry
This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life
Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you
And what happens next in the dream
It's a challenge
Well,  suppose in the dream dream scenario
just
ahm, change my personality, because you can do that in dreams, and  walk across and kiss the girl but you know it'll never happen
Pause
Then they move towards each other when
Jeremy enters
Time's up, 'm afraid
Sorry it was so short
Did you get what you wanted
Very nearly
Maybe time for one last question
Right
Jeremy goes out -- it's their last seconds
Are you busy tonight
Yes
They look at each other
Jeremy enters, with another journalists in tow
Anna and William stand and shake hands formally
Well, it was nice to meet you
Surreal but nice
Thank you
You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress
You and Black Beauty
Tied
- William exits fairly despondent and heads for the door
Tarquin is in the corridor calling on his mobile phone
How was she
Fabulous
Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers
William can't think his way out of this
Yes
That's right
Bitch
He turns to go, but is accosted by Karen
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others
The others
- Mr
Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound
' forty-year-old actor with great presence warmly shakes William's hand
Pleased to meet you
Did you like the film
Ah
yes, enormously
Well, fire away
Right, right
Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film
did
Any bit in particular
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and 'll tell you if  enjoyed making it
Ahm right, right,  liked the bit in space very much
Did you enjoy making  that bit
- Same room same seat, minutes later, with a monolingual foreign actor and an interpreter
Did you identify with the character you were playing
Te identicaste con el personaje que interpretabas
No
No
Ah
Why not
Por que no
Porque es un robot carnivoro psicopata
Because he is playing a psychopathic flesh-eating robot
Classic
- And now William is sitting opposite an eleven-year-old American girl
Is this your first film
No -- it's my 22nd
Of course it is
Any favourite among the 22
Working with Leonardo
Da Vinci
Di Caprio
Of course
And is he your favourite Italian film director
- William emerges traumatized into the corridor
It is full of camera crews
And there is Karen
Mr
Thacker
(so weary) Yes
Have you got a moment
'    - They knock on her door
(
) Come in
William enters
certain nervousness
They are alone again
Ahm
That thing  was doing tonight -- 'm not doing it any more
told them  had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist
Oh well, great
Perfect
Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner
Okay -- fine
But no, 'm sure  can get out of it
No,  mean, if it's fine with you, 'll, you know, be your date
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party
If that's all right
'm sure it's all right
My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something
Okay
Okay
' /  - Bella and Max are in the kitchen
He's bringing a girl
Miracles do happen
Does the girl have a name
He wouldn't say
Christ, what is going on in there
The oven seems to be smoking a little
Then the bell rings
(cont'd) Oh God
It's bad timing
Max shoots out of the kitchen
'  - Max heads for the door impatiently
He opens it and turns back without looking at William and Anna standing there
Come on in
Vague food crisis
William and Anna move along the corridor to the kitchen
' /  - Bella is there
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected
He's cooking guinea fowl
Don't even ask
Hi
Hi
Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of
Bella -- this is Anna
Right
(pause) Okay
Crisis over
He rises from his stove position
Max
This is Anna
Hello, Anna ahm
(He recognizes her -- the word just falls out) Scott -- have some wine
Thank you
Door bell goes
'  - Max opens the door -- it is Honey
Hi
She does a little pose, having worn a real party dress
Yes, Happy Birthday
They head back along the corridor
Look, your brother has brought this girl, and ahm
' /  - They enter the kitchen
Hi guys
(sees Anna) Oh holy fuck
Hun -- this is Anna
Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter
Hiya
Oh God this is one of those key moments in life, when it's possible you can be really, genuinely cool -- and 'm going to fail a hundred percent
absolutely and totally and utterly adore you and think you're the most beautiful woman in the world and more importantly genuinely believe and have believed for some time now that we can be best friends
What do you think
Ahm
think that sounds -- you know -- lucky me
Happy Birthday
She hands her a present
Oh my God
You gave me a present
We're best friends already
Marry Will -- he's a really nice guy and then we can be sisters
'll think about it
The front door bell goes
That'll be Bernie
He heads out into the corridor to the front door
'  - Max opens the door
Hello, Bernie
'm sorry 'm so late
Bollocksed up at work again,  fear
Millions down the drain
' /  - They enter the room
Bernie -- this is Anna
Hello, Anna
Delighted to meet you
Doesn't recognize her -- turns to Honey
Honey Bunny -- happy birthday to you
(hands her a present) It's a hat
You don't have to wear it or anything
' /  - minute or two later -- they are standing, drinking wine before dinner
Bernie with Anna on their own -- William helping Max in the kitchen
You haven't slept with her, have you
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment
'No comment' means 'yes
' No, it doesn't
Do you ever masturbate
Definitely no comment
You see -- it means 'yes
' Then on to Bernie's conversation
So tell me Anna -- what do you do
'm an actress
Splendid
'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though  have done some amateur stuff --
Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that
'Ooh -- careful there, vicar
'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting
mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they
Well, they can be
see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year
It's no life
What sort of acting do you do
Films mainly
Oh splendid
Well done
How's the pay in movies
mean, last film you did, what did you get paid
Fifteen million dollars
Right
Right
So that's
fairly good
On the high side
have you tried the nuts
Right --  think we're ready
They all move towards the kitchen
(to Bella) wonder if you could tell me where the
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right
'll show you
moment's silence as they leave -- then in a split second the others all turn to William
Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott
Anna Scott
Yes
The movie star
Yup
Oh God
Oh God
Oh Goddy God
The horror of his remembered conversation slowly unfolds
Honey re-enters
don't believe it
walked into the loo with her
was still talking when she started unbuttoning her jeans
She had to ask me to leave
'  - little later
They are sat at dinner
Bella next to Anna
What do you think of the guinea fowl
(whispering) 'm a vegetarian
Oh God
'  - Moving on through the evening -- they are very relaxed, as they eat dinner
few seconds watching the evening going well -- Anna is taking this in -- real friends -- relaxed -- easy, teasing
And there's a cake
Honey wears Bernie's unsuitable hat
Anna watches William laughing at something and then putting his head in his hands with mock shame
'  - Coffee time
Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what 've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers
Shame
'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact,  think it's something we should take pride in
'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here
little pause
Then William turns to Bernie
Bernie
Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- work in the City in a job  don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me
haven't had a girlfriends since
puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will
Nonsense
fancy you
Or  did before you got so far
You see -- and unless 'm much mistaken, your job still pays you rather a lot of money, while Honey here, she earns nothing flogging her guts out at London's seediest record store
Yes
And  don't have hair -- 've got feathers, and 've got funny goggly eyes, and 'm attracted to cruel men and no one'll ever marry me because my boosies have actually started shrinking
You see -- incredibly sad
On the other hand, her best friend is Anna Scott
That's true,  can't deny it
She needs me, what can  say
And most of her limbs work
Whereas 'm stuck in its thing day and night, in a house full of ramps
And to add insult to serious injury -- 've totally given up smoking, my favourite thing, and the truth is
we can't have a baby
Dead silence
Bella
Bella shrugs her shoulders
Bernie is totally grief-struck
No
Not true
'est la vie
We're lucky in lots of ways, but
Surely it's worth a brownie
William reaches for her hand
Max breaks the sombre mood
Well,  don't know
Look at William
Very unsuccessful professionally
Divorced
Used to be handsome, now kind of squidgy around the edges -- and absolutely certain never to hear from Anna again after she's heard that his nickname at school was Floppy
They all laugh
Anna smiles across at William
So  get the brownie
think you do, yes
Wait a minute
What about me
'm sorry
You think you deserve the brownie
Well
a shot at it
You'll have to prove it
This is a great brownie and 'm going to fight for it
State your claim
Well, 've been on a diet since  was nineteen, which means basically 've been hungry for a decade
've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment
Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this
Really
Really -- and one day, not long from now
While she says this, quiet settles around the table
The thing is -- she sort of means it and is opening up to them
my looks will go, they'll find out can't act and 'll become a sad middle-aged woman who looks a bit like someone who was famous for a while
Silence
they all look at her
then
Nah
Nice try, gorgeous -- but you don't fool anyone
The mood is instantly broken
They all laugh
Pathetic effort to hog the brownie
' / / - Anna and William are leaving
That was such a great evening
'm delighted
He holds out his hand to shake
She kisses him on the cheek
He stumbles back with joy
And may  say that's a gorgeous tie
Now you're lying
You're right
told you  was bad at acting
Max loves this
(to Bella) Lovely to meet you
And you
'll wait till you've gone before  tell him you're a vegetarian
No
Night, night, Honey
'm so sorry about the loo thing
meant to leave but  just
look, ring me if you need someone to go shopping with
know lots of nice, cheap places
not that money necessarily
(gives up) nice to meet you
And Honey gives her a huge hug
You too -- from now on you are my style guru
Anna and William head out
Bernie tries to save some dignity
Love your work
They move to the door and wave goodbye
'  - William and Anna step outside
From inside they hear a massive and hysterical scream of the friends letting out their true feelings
William is a little embarrassed
Sorry -- they always do that when leave the house
The house is in Lansdowne Road, on the edge of Notting Hill
They walk for a moment
bit of silence
Floppy, huh
It's the hair
It's to do with the hair
Why is she in a wheelchair
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident
You know, 'm not sure
don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it
They walk in silence for a moment
Then
Would you like to come
my house is just
She smiles and shakes her head
Too complicated
That's fine
Busy tomorrow
thought you were leaving
was
- little later in the walk
What's in there
They are now walking by a five foot railing, with foliage behind it
Gardens
All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them
They're like little villages
Let's go in
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in
You abide by rules like that
Ahm
Her look makes it clear that she is waiting with interest on the answer to this
Heck no -- other people do -- but not me --  just do what  want
He rattles the gate, then starts his climb -- but doesn't quite make it, and falls back onto the pavement
(casually) Whoopsidaisies
What did you say
Nothing
Yes, you did
No,  didn't
You said 'whoopsidaisies
' Tiny pause
don't think so
No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they --  mean unless they're
There's no 'unless
'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets
Exactly
Here we go again
He fails, and unfortunately, spontaneously
Whoopsidaisies
They look at each other
It's a disease 've got -- it's a clinical thing
'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long
Step aside
She starts to climb
Actually be careful Anna -- it's harder than it looks
But she's already almost over
Oh no it's not -- it's easy
few seconds later
Anna jumps down into the garden
Come on, Flops
William clambers over with terrible difficulty, dusts himself off, and heads towards where she stands
Now seriously -- what in the world in this garden could make that ordeal worthwhile
She leans forward -- and, for the firs time since the first time -- she kisses him
This time a proper kiss
tiny pause
Nice garden
- They walk around the garden
It's a moonlit dream
We see the lights of the houses that surround the garden
They come across a single, simple wooden bench
'For June, who loved this garden -- from Joseph who always sat beside her
' We cut in and see an inscription carved into the wood
She doesn't read the dates, carved below -- 'June Wetherby, 1917 - 1992
'  She is slightly chocked by it
Some people do spend their whole lives together
He nods
They are standing on either side of the bench, looking at each other
The camera glides away from them, up into the night sky, leaving them alone in the garden
Music plays
'   - William in a towel rushes downstairs, having just had a shower
He shoots past Spike
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks
Have you seen my glasses
No, 'fraid not
Bollocks
(still searching -- with no help from Spike) This happens every time  go to the cinema
Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere  look, glasses
But the moment  need them they disappear
It's one of life's real cruelties
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer
Oh shit, is that the time
have to go
'  / - He sprints downstairs, now fully dressed
(not meaning it) Thanks for your help on the glasses thing
(sincerely) You're welcome
Did you find them
Sort of
- Mid-film
We move across the audience
And there is in the middle of it, we see Anna, watching the screen, and next to her, William, watching the film keenly, through his scuba- diving goggles
- very smart Japanese restaurant
We see Anna and William sitting, near the end of their meal
So who left who
She left me
Why
She saw through me
Uh-oh
That's not good
We've been aware of the conversation at a nearby table -- now we can hear it
Two slightly rowdy men
No - No- No
Give me Anna Scott any day
William and Anna look at each other
didn't like that last film of hers
Fast asleep from the moment the lights went down
Again -- Anna reacts
Don't really care what the films are like
Any film with her in it -- fine by me
No -- not my type at all really prefer that other one -- blonde -- sweet looking -- has an orgasm every time you take her out for a cup of coffee
Anna mouths 'Meg Ryan
' Meg Ryan
William and Anna smile -- they're enjoying it
Drug-induced,  hear --  believe she's actually in rehab as we speak
Whatever, she's so clearly up for it
Anna's twinkle fades
You know -- some girls, they're all 'stay away chum' but Anna, she's absolutely gagging for it
Do you know that in over fifty percent of languages the word for "actress" is the same as the word for "prostitute
" This is horrible
And Anna is your definitive actress -- someone really filthy you can just flip over
Right, that's it
He gets up and goes round the corner to the men
There are in fact four of them, the two meeker men, Gavin and Harry, hanging on the other guys' witty words
'm sorry to disturb you guys but -- Can  help you
Well, yes,  wish  hadn't overheard your conversation -- but  did and just think, you know
He's not a very convincing or frightening figure
the person you're talking about is a real person and  think she probably deserves a little bit more consideration, rather than having jerks like you drooling over her
Oh sod off, mate
What are you, her dad
Anna suddenly appears at his side and whips him away without being recognized
'm sorry
No, that's fine
love that you tried
time was 'd have done the same
They walk on and then
In fact -- give me a second
And she walks straight back to their table
Hi
Oh my God
'm sorry about my friend -- he's very sensitive
No, look, 'm sorry
Please, please -- let's just leave it there
'm sure you meant no harm, and 'm sure it was just friendly banter and 'm sure you dicks are all the size of peanuts
perfect match for the size of your brains
Enjoy your meal
The tuna's really good
And she walks away
Gerald turns to Lawrence
You prick
- They are walking
shouldn't have done that shouldn't have done that
No, you were brilliant 'm rash and 'm stupid and what am  doing with you
don't know, 'm afraid
don't know either
They have arrived at the end of the arcade
Here we are
(pause) Do you want to come up
(he hoes) There seem to be lots of reasons why  shouldn't
There are lots of reasons
Do you want to come up
His look says yes
Give me five minutes
He watches her go -- and stands in the street
Music plays
/'  - William coming along the hotel corridor
He knocks on the door
Hiya
There's something slightly awry
He doesn't notice
Hi
He kisses her gently on the cheek
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing
(pause) You've got to go
Why
Because my boyfriend, who  thought was in America, is in fact in the next room
Your boyfriend
He is duly shocked
She's trying to be calm
Yes
(
) Who is it
Jeff drifts into view behind
He is a very famous film star and looks the part -- well built, very handsome
Unshaven, he has magic charm, whatever he says
Over a t-shirt, he wears a shirt, which he unbuttons as he talks
Ahm
room service
How you doing
thought you guys all wore those penguin coats
Well, yes -- usually -- 'd just changed to go home -- but  thought 'd just deal with this final call
Oh great
Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here
'll see what  can do
Still, not sparkling
Absolutely
Ice cold still water
Unless it's illegal in the  to serve liquids below room temperature: don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims
No, 'm sure it'll be fine
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash
Right
And he does just that
Scoops up the two used plates and heads to the bin
Really -- don't do that -- 'm sure this is not his job
'm sorry
Is this a problem
Ah -- no
It's fine
What's your name
Ahm
Bernie
Jeff slips him a fiver
Thank you, Bernie
(to Anna) Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise
Nice surprise
He kisses her
Liar
(to William) She hates surprises
What are you ordering
haven't decided
Well, don't over-do it
don't want people saying, 'There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend
" He wanders off taking off his t-shirt
better leave
Anna just nods
-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with
To be honest, don't realize
'm sorry
don't know what to say
think goodbye is traditional
- William walks away
- William walks down the arcade outside the hotel
He is stunned
- William sits alone on a bus
We see him through the side window
As it drives away, we see that the whole back of the bus is taken up with a huge picture of Anna
'  - He gets into his room and sits on the bed
- Space Anna, in the very hi-tech environment and a serious moods, fastens the last clasps on her uniform
She takes a helmet type thing, and places it on her head
- Cut round to the Coronet cinema where this film is showing
It's not full
The camera moves and finds, sitting on his own
William
Just watching
We see a momentous flash of light from the screen explode, reflected in his eye
'   - William is looking out the window, lost in thought
Spike enters
Come on -- open up -- this is me -- Spikey -- 'm in contact with some quite important spiritual vibrations
What's wrong
Spike settles on the arm of a chair
William decides to open up a bit
Well, okay
There's this girl
Aha
'd been getting a female vibe
Good
Speak on, dear friend
She's someone  just can't -- someone who
self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if 've taken love-heroin -- and now  can't even have it again
've opened Pandora's box
And there's trouble inside
Spike nods thoughtfully
Yeh
Yeh
tricky
tricky knew a girl at school called Pandora never got to see her box though
He roars with laughter
William smiles
Thanks
Yes -- very helpful
'  - Only two tables are being used
William and his friends are on their first course
Bernie reads an "Evening Standard," with a picture of Anna and Jeff at Heathrow Airport
You didn't know she had a boyfriend
No -- did you
Their looks make it obvious that everyone did
Bloody hell,  can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because  don't read 'Hello' magazine
Let's face facts
This was always a no-go situation
Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods
Buggered
Every time
But don't despair -- think  have the solution to your problems
Really
They all look to him for wise words
Her name is Tessa and she works in the contracts department
The hair, admit, is unfashionable frizzy -- but she's as bright as a button and kisses like a nymphomaniac on death row
Apparently
' /  - The kitchen
William is looking uneasy
doorbell rings
Now -- try
William nods
Max heads off to the door
We stay with William -- and just hear the door open and a voice come down the corridor
(
) got completely lost -- it's real difficult, isn't it
Everything's got the word 'Kensington' in it -- Kensington Park Road, Kensington Gardens, Kensington bloody Park Gardens
They reach the kitchen
Tessa is a lush girl with huge hair
Tessa -- this is Bella my wife
Oh hello, you're in a wheelchair
That's right
And this is William
Hello William
Max has told me everything about you
(frightened) Has he
Wine
Oh yes please
Come on, Willie, let's get sloshed
She turns to take the wine and William has a split second to send a message of panic to Bella
She agrees -- it's bad
' / - Max walks over to the table
Honey, Bella, William and another girl
Keziah -- some woodcock
No, thank you  -- 'm a fruitarian
don't realize that
It is left to William, who has been set up here, to fill the pause
And ahm -- what's a fruitarian exactly
We believe that fruits and vegetables have feelings so we think cooking is cruel
We only eat things that have actually fallen from the tree or bush -- that are, in fact, dead already
Right
Right
Interesting stuff
(pause) So these carrots
Have been murdered, yes
Murdered
Poor carrots
How beastly
'  - Time for coffee and chocolates
Beside William sits the final, perfect girl
She is Rosie, quite young, smartly dressed, open-hearted
It is just Max and William and Bella and her
Delicious coffee
Thank you
'm sorry about the lamb
No --  thought it was really, you know, interesting
Interesting means inedible
Really inedible -- yes that's right
They all laugh
It's going very well
'  - William is with Rosie by the door -- just about to say goodbye
Maybe we'll meet again some time
Yes
That would be
great
She kisses him gently on the cheek
He opens the door -- she walks out
He shuts the door quietly and heads back into the living room
'   - Max and Bella wait excitedly
Well
She's perfect, perfect
And
William makes a gentle, exasperated gesture, then
think you have forgotten
(he looks at them) what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are
always miniscule
Look at me -- not counting the American -- 've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters
That's not fair
No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend
(pause) Still loves you though
In a depressingly asexual way
(pause) never fancied you much actually
They all roar with laughter
mean  loved you -- you were terribly funny
But all that kissing my ears
Oh no -- this is just getting worse
am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch
Do you want to stay
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman
Music starts to play to take us through these silent scenes
'   - Max lifts Bella off her couch and carries her upstairs
Mix through -- William sits on the couch downstairs -- eyes wide open -- thinking
' /  - Morning
Max, all in his suit for the city
Bella kisses him goodbye
William sees this from the kitchen
She is also dressed for work -- and moves back into the kitchen to pack her briefcase with law books from the kitchen table
'  - William emerges from the house, a little ruffled from a night away from home, a heads off
- William walks past the newsagent, heading for home
We see, though he doesn't, a rack of tabloid papers, all of which seem to have very grainy, grabbed pictures of Anna on their front page
Headlines --'Anna Stunna'-- 'It's Definitely Her
' and 'Scott of Pantartica
' '  - William is shaving
The bell goes
He heads out to answer it
/
'  - William arrives at the door and opens it
There stands a dark- glassed Anna
Hi
Can  come in
Come in
She moves inside
Her hair is a mess -- her eyes are tired
Nothing idealized
- The two of them
They were taken years ago --  know it was
well,  was poor and it happens a lot -- that's not an excuse -- but to make things worse, it now appears someone was filming me as well
So what was a stupid photo- shoot now looks like a porno film
And well
the pictures have been solid and they're everywhere
William shakes his head
don't know where to go
The hotel is surrounded
This is the place
Thank you
'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be
She's very shaken
These are such horrible pictures
They're so grainy
they make me look like
Don't think about it
We'll sort it out
Now what would you like -- tea bath
bath would be great
'  - Spike enters through the front door
William doesn't hear him
Spike is reading newspapers with the Anna pictures in it
Christ alive
brilliant
fantastic magnificent
He heads up the stairs
Opens the bathroom door, walks in
'  - Spike heads for the toilet -- undoes his zip
You must be Spike
She's in the bath
Spike turns in shock -- and sidles out of the bathroom
'  - Spike calms himself down
He then opens the bathroom door again -- and looks in
'  - Anna is still lying low in the bath
Hi
Just checking
- Spike comes back out into the corridor
Looks to heaven
Thank you, God
'  - William and Anna at the kitchen table, eating toast, dringking tea
'm really sorry about last time
He just flew in --  had no idea -- in fact, had no idea if he'd ever fly in again
No, that's fine
It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star
It was a thrill for me
(she smiles
Pause) How is he
don't know
It got to the point where couldn't remember any of the reasons loved him
And you
and love
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer
have thought about you
Oh no no -- no
He doesn't think she has to talk about this
Just anytime 've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster
appreciate that absolutely
(changing subject tactfully) Is that the film you're doing
Yes -- start in
on Tuesday
Would you like me to take you through your lines
Would you
It's all talk, talk, talk
Hand it over
Basic plot
'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster
Well done you
- little later
They're in the thick of the script
'Message from command
Would you like them to send in the HKs
' 'No, turn over 4 's and tell them we need radar feedback before the 's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12
15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes  made in that speech or 'll pelt you with olives
'Very well, captain -- 'll pass that on straightaway
' 'Thank you
'  How many mistake did make
Eleven
Damn
'And Wainwright
' Cartwright
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is,  promised little Jimmy 'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that  may be a little late
' 'Certainly
And little Johnny
' My son's name is Johnny
Yup
Well, get a message through to him too
Brilliant
(the scene's over) Word perfect 'd say
What do you think
Gripping
It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping
You think  should do Henry James instead
'm sure you'd be great in Henry James
But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too
Yes --  mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover
' And  think the book is the poorer for it
Anna smiles her biggest smile of the day
He is helping
' Anna and William
Sat down at table
There's a picture hanging on the wall behind
can't believe you have that picture on your wall
It is a poster of a Chagall painting of a floating wedding couple, with a goat as company
You like Chagall
do
It feels like how being in love should be
Floating through a dark blue sky
With a goat playing a violin
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat
Spike enters with three pizzas
Voila
Carnival Calypso, for the Queen of Notting Hill -- pepperoni, pineapple and a little more pepperoni
Fantastic
don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did
(pause) have some parsnip stew from last week
If  just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect
'   - Later in the evening
William and Anna on their own
They're sipping coffee
few seconds of just co-existing
Anna looks up
You've got big feet
Yes
Always have had
You know what they say about men with big feet
No
What's that
Big feet -- large shoes
He laughs
'   - few hours later -- eating ice-cream out of the tub
The thing that's so irritating is that now 'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity
Definitely
'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek
In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation
' You have a stunt bottom
could have a stunt bottom, yes
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own
Definitely
Ths is important stuff
It's one hell of a job
What do you put on your passport
Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom
Actually, Mel does his own ass work
Why wouldn't he
It's delicious
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom
Both
'   - They are walking up the stairs -- and stop at the top
Today has ben a good day
Which under the circumstances is
unexpected
Well, thank you
(awkward pause) Anyway -- time for bed
Or
sofa-bed
Right
Pause
She leans forward, kisses him gently, then steps into the bedroom and closes the door
'   - William downstairs -- on a sofa -- under a duvet
Eyes open
Thinking
Pause and pause
He waits and waits -- the ultimate 'yearn
'  But nothing happens
William gets off the sofa decisively
Sits on the side of it
Then gets back in again
Pause, pause, then
in the darkness, a stair creaks
There's someone there
(to himself) Oh my God
(then
) Hello
Hello
wonder if  could have a little word
He drifts round the corner, half-naked
Spike
don't want to interfere, or anything but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it
Maybe
And she's in your house
Yes
And you get on very well
Yes
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to
slip her one
Spike
For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip
Right
Right
You think it's the wrong moment
Fair enough
(pause) Do you mind if  have a go
Spike
No -- you're right
'll talk to you in the morning
Okay -- okay
Might be too late, but okay
Back to William thinking again
Dreamy atmosphere
And then
more footsteps on the stairs
Oh please sod off
Okay
No
No
Wait
thought you were someone else
thought you were Spike
'm delighted you're not
The darkness of the living room
We see Anna in the shadow
'   - few moments later
William and Anna stand in the middle of the room
He kisses her neck
Then her shoulder
What a miracle it is just to be able to touch this girl's skin
Then he looks at her face
That face
He is suddenly struck by who it is
Wow
What
And then gets over it straight away
Nothing
And kisses her
'  - The middle of the night
They are both asleep -- a yard apart
In sleep, her arm reaches out, touches his shoulder and then she wriggles across and re-settles herself, tenderly, right next to him
He is not asleep and knows how extraordinary this all is
'  - The morning
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that 'm allowed to see you naked
You and every person in this country
Oh God yes -- 'm sorry
What is it about men and nudity
Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them
Well
No seriously
mean, they're just breasts
Every second person in the world has got them
More than that actually, when you think about it
You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair
But
they're odd-looking
They're for milk
Your mum's got them
You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about
(pause) Actually,  can't think really -- let me just have a quick look
He looks under the sheet at her breasts
No, beats me
She laughs
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me
' Do you feel that
Who was Gilda
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me
(pause) You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been
(very touched) Oh
She looks at him carefully
Then leaps out of bed
'll be back
'  - William on the bed
The door opens
It is Anna with a tray of toast and tea
Breakfast in bed
Or lunch, or brunch
She heads across
She smiles and sits on the bed
Can  stay a bit longer
Stay forever
Damn,  forgot the jam
The doorbell goes
You get the door, 'll get the jam
/
'  - William heads down the corridor and opens the door
Outside are hundreds of paparazzi -- an explosion of cameras and questions, of noise and light
The press seem to fill the entire street
Jesus Christ
He comes back inside, snapping the door behind him
Anna is in the kitchen
What
Don't ask
She heads back the corridor, with no suspicion
You're up to something
She thinks he's fooling around
She opens the door, the same explosion
In a split second she's inside
Oh my God
And they got a photo of you dressed like that
Undressed like this, yes
Jesus
'  - Anna is on the phone
Spike is blithely heading downstairs to the kitchen in just his underpants
Morning, daring ones
He does a thumbs up to William -- very excited about what he knows was a 'result
' (on the phone) It's Anna
The press are here
No, there are hundreds of them
My brilliant plan was not so brilliant after all
Yeh,  know,  know
Just get me out then
(she hangs up) Damnit
She heads upstairs
wouldn't go outside
Why not
Just take my work for it
The moment William goes upstairs, Spike heads for the front door
'  - From outside -- we see this scrawny bloke in the frame of the doorway, in his grey underpants
thousand photos
Spike poses athletically
'  - Spike closes the door and wanders along to a mirror in the hall- way, muttering
How did  look
Inspects himself
Not bad
No bad at all
Well-chosen briefs, 'd say
Chicks love grey
Mmmmm
Nice firm buttocks
'  - William enters
He's unhappy for her
She's almost dressed
How are you doing
How do you think 'm doing
don't know what happened
do
Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where  was
She's packing
That's not true
Really
The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- know where Anna Scott is
She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill
'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear
(dropping in) went out in my goddamn underwear too
Get out, Spike
(he does) 'm so sorry
This is such a mess
come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now 'm landed in it all over again
For God's sake, 've got a boyfriend
You do
It's a difficult moment -- defining where they stand
As far as they're concerned  do
And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu
know,  know -- but
just -- let's stay calm
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity
Everyone you ever bump into will know
'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures
' That's spectacularly unfair
Who knows, it may even help business
Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott
She heads out
/  - Now stop
Stop
beg you -- calm down
Have a cup of tea
don't want a goddamn cup of tea want to go home
The doorbell goes
Spike, check who that is
and for God's sake put some clothes on
Spike leans merrily out of the window
Looks like a chauffeur to me
' / - They move from the kitchen into the corridor
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner
Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal
That's not true
And wait a minute
this is crazy behavior
Can't we just laugh about this
Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter
What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan
Well, there are
And we don't need to go anywhere near that far
My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life
All 'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective
You're right: of course, you're right
It's just that 've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes
Our perspectives are different
mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins
Excuse me
Well, you know -- it's just one day
Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow
You really don't get it
This story gets filed
Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos
Newspapers last forever
'll regret this forever
He takes this in
That's the end
Right
Fine
will do the opposite, if it's all right by you -- and always be glad you came
But you're right -- you probably better go
She looks at him
The doorbell goes again
She opens the door
Massive noise and photos
Outside are her people, including Karen, a chauffeur, two bodyguards
And then the door is shut and they're all gone
Silence
' / - Spike and William sitting there
Pause
Was it you
suppose  might have told one or two people down the pub
Right
He puts his head in his hands
It's over now
- As full, sad music plays -- William begins to walk through Notting Hill
This walk takes six months
as he walks, the seasons actually and magically change, from summer, through autumn and winter, back into spring
First it is summer -- summer fruits and flowers -- a six-month pregnant woman -- Honey with another leather-jacket boyfriend
As he walks on the rain starts to fall -- he turns up his coat collar -- umbrellas appear
Followed by winter coats -- chestnuts roasting -- Christmas trees on sale and the first hint of snow
Then he comes to Blenheim Crescent, which is startling snowscape, for the hundred yard, right across Ladbroke Grove
By the time he reaches the purple cafe, the snow is melting and in a few yards, it is spring again
He passes Honey again -- arguing with her boyfriend, walking away tearful
Then turns past 'the pregnant woman' -- now holding her three-month baby
The camera holds on her
- grey day in the bookshop
Martin and William
As ever feeling that things in there ever change
Ten seconds pass
Honey rushes in
Spike, still feeling in disgrace, comes in with her but lingers in the doorway
Have we got something for you
Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life
Blimey
What's that
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York
You can ring her
You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her
Well, thanks, that's great
It is great, isn't it
See you tonight
Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy
And she rushes out
William looks at the piece of paper, folds it and then places it gently in the garbage bin
'  - Bella bangs a spoon on a wine bottle
All the friends are gathered in the restaurant
have a little speech to make --  won't stand up because  can't
be bothered
Exactly a year ago today, this man here started the finest restaurant in London
Thank you very much
Unfortunately -- no one ever came to eat here
tiny hiccough
And so we must face the fact that from next week, we have to find somewhere near to eat
Tony's brave face breaks
The dream is over
just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally
The more  think about things, the more  see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us
get fired
No
Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course
(he owns up) was total crap
They're all rather stunned
So we go down together
toast to Bernie -- the worst stockbroker in the whole world
They toast him
Since it's an evening of announcements 've also got one, Ahm
've decided to get engaged
Total bewilderment from the others
've found myself a nice, slightly odd looking bloke who  know is going to make me happy for the rest of my life
Special cut to Bernie -- the shot shows he had special feelings for Honey
Wait a minute -- 'm your brother and don't know anything about this
Is it someone we know
Yes
will keep you informed
As she sits down, Honey leans towards Spike and whispers
By the way -- it's you
Me
Yes
What do you think
Well, yes
Groovy
Any more announcements
Yes --  feel  must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months
have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth
There's an understatement
There are dead people on better form
But  wish to make it clear 've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy
'  - Two hours later
They've had a very good time
There's been a chocolate cake
Lots of alcohol
Tony is playing 'Blue Moon' on the piano, and Bernie joins him, singing
At one table Bella and Honey sit -- beer and wine on the table
'm really horribly drunk
Elsewhere, Max an William are relaxed together
So -- you've laid the ghost
believe  have
Don't give a damn about the famous girl
No, don't think  do
Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath
He puts down a copy of the 'Evening Standard' with a picture of Anna on its cover
(immediate gloom) Oh God no
So not over her, in fact
- Cut to the wide sweep of Hampstead Heath
William entirely alone
He marches up a hill
goes over the crest of it -- and sees a huge film crew and hundreds of extras in front of the radiant white of Kenwood House, with its lawn and its lakes
- Now closer to the house, William approaches a barrier -- where he is himself approached
Can  help you
Yes --  was looking for Anna Scott
Does she know you're coming
No, no
She doesn't
'm afraid  can't really let you through then, sir
Oh right
mean,  am a friend -- 'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically
can't let you through
At that moment -- thirty yards away, William sees trailer door open
Out of it comes Anna -- looking extraordinary -- in a velvet dress; full, beautiful make-up; rich, extravagant hair
She has a necessary cluster of people about her
Hair, make-up, costume and the third assistant who has collected her
She walks a few yards, and then casually turns her head
And sees him
Her face registers not jut surprise, certainly not a simple smile
His being there is a complicated thing
Cut back to him
He does a small wave
She pauses as the whole paraphernalia of the upcoming scene passes between them
The movie divides them
But then she begins to walk through it, and followed by her cluster, she makes her way towards him
When she reaches him, the security guard stands back a pace, and her people hold back
She doesn't really know what to say
This is certainly
ah
only found out you were here yesterday
was going to ring
but
didn't think you'd want to
The third assistant is under pressure
Anna
She looks around
The poor third is nervous -- and the first is approaching
(to William) It's not going very well -- and it's our last day
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy
But
wait
there are things to say
Okay
Drink tea -- there's lots of tea
She is swept away, four people touching her hair and costume
Come and have a look
- As they make towards the set
Are you a fan of Henry James
This is Henry James film
- complicated shot is about to happen -- with waves of extras -- and a huge moving crane
They end up next to the sound desk
This is Harry -- he'll give you a pair of headphones so you can hear the dialogue
Harry the sound man is a pleasant, fifty-year-old balding fellow
He hands him the headphones
Here we go
The volume control is on the side
That's great
William, the headphones on, surveys the scene -- the cluster is a full 100 yards from the action, to allow a gracious sweeping wide-shot
He watches Anna
She is with her co-star in the Henry James film -- let's call him James
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today
We have to
've got to be in New York on Thursday
Oh, stop showing off
He studies an actress a few yards to the left
God, that's an enormous arse
'm not listening
No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed
said 'm not listening -- and  think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet
Back by the desk, William is listening and laughs
That's his girl
Anna prepares
So  ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say
'Tomorrow will be soon enough
' And then
right
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up
Oh
no one
no one
Just some
guy from the past
don't know what he's doing here
Bit of an awkward situation
- Cut back to William -- he has heard
Of course
He takes off the headphones and puts them gently down
Thank you
Anytime
William walks away
The moment of hope is gone
He couldn't have had a clear reminder
'   - William is emptying Anna Scott videos into a box
What's going on
'm going to throw out these old videos
No
You can't bin these
They're classics
'm not allowing this
Right -- let's talk about rent
Let me help
We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives
- The next day
William is hard at work, doing the accounts in a dark small room with files in it
Martin pops his head in
have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself
But it's not for the shop
It's for you
Okay
Tell me, would  have to pay a wet rag as much as  pay you
They head out, Martin behind him, incomprehensively rubbing his hands -- he's in a very good mood
- William enters -- and there stands Anna -- in a simple blue skirt and top
Hi
Hello
You disappeared
Yes -- 'm sorry --  had to leave didn't want to disturb you
Well
how have you been
Fine
Everything much the same
When they change the law Spike and  will marry immediately
Whereas you
've watched in wonder
Awards, glory Oh no
It's all nonsense, believe me
had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is
(she's nervous) Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so 'm just off -- but brought you this from home, and
It's quite a big wrapped parcel, flat -- 3 foot by 4 foot, leaning against a bookshelf
thought 'd give it to you
Thank you
Shall
No, don't open it yet -- 'll be embarrassed
Okay -- well, thank you
don't know what it's for
But thank you anyway
actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd
but, when it came to it,  didn't know how to call you
having behaved so
badly, twice
So it's been just sitting in the hotel
But then
you came, so figured
the thing is
the thing is What's the thing
Then the door pings
In walks the annoying customer, Mr
Smith
Don't even think about it
Go away immediately
Mr
Smith is taken aback and therefore completely obedient
Right
Sorry
And he leaves
You were saying
Yes
The thing is
have to go away today but  wondered, if  didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit
or, a lot maybe
see if you could
like me again
Pause as William takes this in
But yesterday
that actor asked you who  was
and you just dismissed me out of hand
heard -- you had a microphone
had headphones
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England
Martin edges up
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone
Can you tell her 'll ring her back
actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color
Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin
Martin is left with Anna
Can  just say,  thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film
Is that right
Yes
've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life
can't say  know Patrick all that well
Oh dear
He wasn't friendly during the filming
Well, no -- 'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost
' She's kind in here, not sarcastic
Oh right
Right
Sorry
Always been a bit of an ass
William returns a little uneasy
Anyway
it's lovely to meet you
'm a great fan of yours
And Demi's, of course
Martin leaves them
Sorry about that
That's fine
There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict
She's awaiting an answer
Anna
Look -- 'm a fairly level- headed bloke
Not often in and out of love
But
He can't really express what he feels
can  just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that
Yes, that's fine
Of course
you know
of course
'll just
be getting along then
nice to see you
The truth is
He feels he must explain
with you, 'm in real danger
It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, fear, not recover if  was once again cast aside, which  would absolutely expect to be
There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films
You'd go and 'd be
well, buggered, basically
see
(pause) That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it
live in Notting Hill
You live in Beverly Hills
Everyone in the world knows who you are
My mother has trouble remembering my name
Okay
Fine
Fine
Good decision
Pause
The fame thing isn't really real, you know
Don't forget -- 'm also just a girl
Standing in front of a boy
Asking him to love her
Pause
She kisses him on the cheek
Bye
Then turns and leaves
Leaving him
'  - The restaurant is in the middle of being deconstructed
The pictures are gone off the walls -- a kettle on a long extension lead is on the bare table behind
They're all sitting there
What do you think
Good move
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special
saw her taking her pants off and  definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there
Good decision
All actresses are mad as snakes
Tony -- what do you think
Never met her, never want to
Brilliant
Max
Absolutely
Never trust a vegetarian
Great
Excellent
Thanks
Spike enters
was called and  came
What's up
William has just turned down Anna Scott
You daft prick
Bella is casually looking at the painting that sits beside William
It is the original of the Chagall, the poster of which was on his wall
This painting isn't the original, is it
Yes,  think that one may be
But she said she wanted to go out with you
Yes -- sort of
That's nice
What
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is
pretty great
isn't it
It was sort of sweet actually --  mean, know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also
that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her
They take in the line
It totally reverses their attitudes
pause
Oh sod a dog
've made the wrong decision, haven't
They look at him
Spike does a big nod
Max, how fast is your car
'  - Max's car arrives in the street outside
They pile into the car
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices
And we intend to use them
Where's Bella
She's not coming
Sod that
Bernie -- in the back
He shoots out of his door, rushes round and grabs Bella out of the chair
Come on, babe
/
/   - Max's car is shooting up Stanley Crescent
We are inside and outside the car
Where are you going
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner
Crazy
Go along Bayswater
That's right -- then Park Lane
Or you could go right down to Cromwell Road, and left
No
Suddenly the car slams to a halt
Stop right there
will decide the route
All right
All right
James Bond never has to put up with this sort of shit
- The car turns illegally right across Piccadilly the wrong way down a one-way street and ends up outside the Ritz
William sprints into the hotel
Bernie follows
Bloody hell, this is fun
- Is Miss Scott staying here
It is the same man
No, sir
How about Miss Flintstone
No, sir
Or Bambi
or,  don't know, Beavis or Butthead
Man shakes his head
No, sir
Right
Right
Fair enough
Thanks
He turns despondent and takes two steps when the Ritz Man stops him in his tracks
There was a Miss Pocahontas in room 126 -- but she checked out an hour ago believe she's holding a press conference at The Savoy before flying to America
William is very grateful
He kisses the Ritz Man
Bernie's also gratuful
He kisses him too
We have lift off
Japanese guest assumes this is the way to behave and the Ritz Man gets kissed a third time
- The car speeds through London
It gets totally stuck at a junction where no one will let them in
Bugger this for a bunch of bananas
He gets out of the car and boldly stops the traffic coming in the opposite direction
Our car shoots past him
Go
They leave him behind
Honey leans out the window and shouts
You're my hero
Spike waves wildly -- he loses concentration and is very nearly hit by a car
- They pull to a stop
William leaps out
Go
- William rushes up to the main desk
Excuse me, where's the press conference
Are you an accredited member of the press
Yes
He flashes a card
That's a Blockbuster video membership card, sir
That's right
work for their in- house magazine
(mimes quotation marks) 'Movies are our business
' 'm sorry, sir
Honey shoots into shot, pushing Bella's chair
He's with me
And you are
Writing an article about how London hotels treat people in wheelchairs
Of course, madam
It's in the Lancaster Room
'm afraid you're very late
(to William) Run
- William runs, searching
At last finds the room, and enters
- Huge room -- full of press
Row after row of journalists, cameras at the front,  cameras at the back
Anna clearly gives press conferences very rarely, because this one is positively presidential
She sits at a table at the end of the room, beside Karen: on her other side is Jeremy, the  boss, firmly marshalling the questions
Yes
You -- Dominic
1 How much longer are you staying in the then
No time at all
fly out tonight
She's in a slightly melancholic and therefore honest mood
Which is why we have to round it up now
Final questions
He points at a journalist he knows
2 Is your decision to take a year off anything to do with the rumours about Jeff and his present leading lady
Absolutely not
2 Do you believe the rumours
It's really not my business any more
Though  will say, from my experience, that rumours about Jeff
do tend to be true
They love that answer, and all scribble in their note books
Next question comes from someone straight right next to William
3 Last time you were here, there were some fairly graphic photographs of you and a young English guy -- so what happened there
He was just a friend --  think we're still friends
Yes, the gentleman in the pink shirt
He is pointing straight at William, who has his hand up
Yes -- Miss Scott -- are there any circumstances in which you two might be more than just friends
Anna sees who it is asking
hoped there might be -- but no, 'm assured there aren't
And what would you say
No, it's just one question per person
No, let him
ask away
You were saying
Yes,  just wondered whether if it turned out that this
person
(to William) His name is Thacker
Thanks
just wondered if Mr
Thacker realized he'd been a daft prick and got down on his knees and begged you to reconsider, whether you would
reconsider
We cut to Max, Bella, Bernie and Honey, all watching
Then back to Anna
Yes, 'm pretty sure  would
That's very good news
The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted
Anna whispers something to Jeremy
Dominic -- if you'd like to ask your question again
1 Yes -- Anna -- how long are you intending to stay here in Britain
Pause
Anna looks up at William
He nods
Indefinitely
They both smile -- suddenly the press gets what's going on -- music -- noise -- they all turn and flash, flash, flash photos of William
Max and Bella kiss
Bernie kisses a total stranger
Spike finally makes it -- he's bright red from running
What happened
It was good
Honey hugs him
It's a new experience for Spike
Cut to William's face -- flash after flash -- still looking at Anna
They are both smiling
/
- Anna and William at their wedding -- they kiss and walk into the crowd
Honey, a bridesmaid in peach satin -- she is surrounded by at least four other bridesmaids, all under five
Nearby, Tony standing, glowing, beside his fabulous, pyramidical wedding cake
William's mother is not quite happy with how he's looking
She tries to brush his hair
Max, dressed in the most devastating Bond-like white tuxedo is dancing with Anna -- thrilled
He does a rather flashy little move
Cut to Bella who is watching and laughing
Martin, in an awkward tweed suit, is jiggling to the beat of a song, entirely happy in the corner
- huge premier -- screaming crowds -- Anna and William get out of the car, she holding his hand --  looking ultimately gorgeous -- he in a black tie that doesn't quite fit
He's startled
- pretty green communal garden
Children are playing, watched by mothers, one of whom holds a new baby in a papoose
very old couple wander along slowly
small tai chi group moves mysteriously
And as the camera glides, it passes a couple sitting on a single, simple wooden bench overlooking the garden
He is reading, she is just looking out, totally relaxed, holding his hand, pregnant
It is William and Anna
