young hand comes into frame, holding a pencil
For a few moments, we hear only the soft scratching of pencil on paper, as credits are written in a series of dissolves
The hand carefully erases and corrects an error or two along the way
And then the sound of an old friend
the warm crackle of a vinyl record
as we now hear Alvin and the Chipmunks' "Christmas Song
" 2
-- 					2 lone palm tree rises up into a yellow afternoon sky
Behind it, the sparkling blue of the Pacific Ocean and the city of San Diego
dry, hot Southern California day
Even the wind is lazy, and a little bored
3
- 				3 Santa Claus wears shorts and sandals, ringing a bell as he collects for the Salvation Army
This is Christmas in the Southland
No snow, no winter wonderland
Just a pleasantly thick heat and an unchanging season, as music continues
Turning the corner, walking into frame is  , 35
She is a tall woman, consumed by the fevered conversation she's Having with her pale young son , late pre-teens
They stand apart from the other shoppers
All around them is the highly-charged salesmanship of the season
silver glittering fake Christmas trees
She hurries her son through the commercial juggernaut, continuing their lively intellectual conversation, when something stops her
Workman is affixing letters to a store-front
He has already placed the
now he's finishing the
Elaine is strong, but always pleasant, always clear about her purpose in this life
Excuse me, 'm a teacher
There is no word in The English Language -- "Xmas
" It's either Merry Christmas
or Happy Holidays
The Workman nods thanks, with faux appreciation, as Mom turns away
The Workman shares a look with William, who shrugs - that's my Mom
: 1969 4
-   -- 				4 This is the new professional-class
It's a mini-condo community
Rows of Spanish-styled three-bedroom houses with common walls
Move in on one of these homes, the one without Christmas lights
At the door is a furtive 15 year-old Girl
She checks her cheek, straightens her hair
She hides something under her coat, and gathers the proper nonchalance to enter
Music fades
5
-- 						5 We now hear the dialogue between this lively Mother and her son, as she cooks a pan full of soy-based health-food cutlets
The meal simmers unappetizingly in the pan
Across the kitchen we see William
He's a great listener, with a calm and curious face that takes everything in
- so Livia - -- killed everyone off so her son Tiberius could inherit the throne
(thoughtful pause) Just like Nixon
William nods, intrigued
He has a good disposition
The world of knowledge engages him, and he loves what it brings out in his Mom
There is a small clatter at the front door, as the girl we've just seen enters, barely brushing some chimes
She silently curses herself
(cont'd) Anita, is that you
' Hey Mom
already ate
Mom moves to the living room to greet William's sister
William peers into the next room
6
-- 						6 She's almost to her bedroom down the hall when mom catches her
We now discover , 16, up-close
She is an alluring young Natalie Wood, with a suspicious and sunny smile
You sure
'm making soy cutlets
The words "soy cutlets" sends a small shiver through the girl
'm fine
Already ate
William stands in the doorway now, watching, monitoring, as Mom moves closer to his sister
She sees something curious about her daughter
Wait
You've been kissing
(too quickly) No  haven't
(peering at her lips) Yes
yes, you have
No  haven't
Yes you have
can tell
(boldly) You can't tell
Mom steps closer and examines the lips even more carefully
To her, everything is a quest for knowledge
Not only can tell ,  know who it is
It's Darryl
Anita is stunned silent
She turns slightly to look at herself in a hall mirror, searching for clues, implicating herself immediately
(cont'd) And what have you got under your coat
This is the booty Anita didn't want to give up
Mom picks at the corner of an album cover now visible under her jacket
She withdraws the album
It's Simon and Garfunkel's Bookends
(busted) It's unfair that we can't listen to our music
(weary of the issue) Honey, it's all about drugs and promiscuous sex
Simon and Garfunkel is poetry
Yes it's poetry
It's the poetry of drugs and promiscuous sex
Look at the picture on the cover
Mom's fingers at the edges
We examine the insolent faces on Richard Avedon's classic album cover
Even Simon and Garfunkle look guilty under her scholarly inspection
(cont'd) honey, they're on pot
First it was butter, then sugar and white flour
(beat) Bacon
Eggs, bologna, rock and roll, motorcycles
Nearby, William squirms as he watches the gently escalating conversation
Anita glances at her brother
He silently urges her to downshift
She can't
(cont'd) Then it was celebrating Christmas on a day in September When you knew it wouldn't be "commercialized
" That was an experiment
But understand - What else are you going to ban
Honey, you want to rebel against knowledge
(cont'd) 'm trying to give you the Cliff's Notes on how to live in this world
(simple and direct) We're like nobody else  know
These are the words that sting Mom most
'm a teacher
Why can't  teach my own kids
(pats chest) Use me
Darryl says you use knowledge to keep me down
He says 'm a "yes" person and you're trying to raise us in a "no" environment
(immediately, can't help it) Well, clearly, "no" is a word Darryl doesn't hear much
Anita gasps
Ever the peacemaker, William weighs in
Nearby is a poster - "No More War
" Mom -- Everything  say is wrong
can't live here
hate you
Even William hates you
don't hate her
(to William) You don't even know the truth
William looks vaguely confused
Sweetheart, don't be a drama queen
Anita takes a breath and then out of her mouth comes the strangled-sounding words of a kid swearing at her parent for the first time
Feck you
All of you
Hey
Anita runs down the hall to her room
Elaine turns to William, relating to him more as a fellow parent than a child
(cont'd) Well, there it is
Your sister using the "f" word
think she said "feck
" (sputtering) What's the difference
(encouraging) Well
The letter "u"
Shot moves in on the kid, as we hear the opening strains of The Moody Blues' "Nights in White Satin
" 7
/  -- 			7 Music continues
Shot moves along a row of very mature-looking male teenagers, examining themselves in the bathroom mirror
There's the kid with a very mature-looking moustache, the  kid proudly sporting full-blown hormonal acne (he slaps on some Hai Karate ), the guy to whom puberty has already delivered the face of an adult, complete with long jutting sideburns
and then a blank space at the mirror, as the shot moves down, down, down to find William
He is so much younger, without a zit in sight
Puberty is so very distant on his horizon
8
--  -- -				 8 Song continues as we see William's perspective of these much- older looking kids
Girls now are visible, and they are even more mature than the boys we've just seen
They flirt and glow, arms trailing across the shoulders of the boys
Whispering in each other's ears, none of them looking down
It's a troubling experience, to be this close to the alluring world of older teenagers
and to be so invisible to them
(
) Are you really in our grade
9
-- 				  9 (louder) Are you really in our grade
William turns to see tall, adenoidal
The most mature looking kid we've seen yet, he challenges William in a loud theatrical tone
It is a voice right out of Guys and Dolls, which incidentally is the school play in which Tobin had just starred
William answers in a respectful voice
He is desperate for acceptance
Yeah
Hey guys
Check it out
William doesn't have any pubes Others now begin to gather around, examining William
He has never been more naked
# 1 How old are you man
He's not a man, he's a little baby kid
He Doesn't even get zits yet
# 2 How come you don't have any hair down there
(in loud, funny voice) Where are your pubes
Their voices echo off the tiled walls
Now everyone is watching the hairless William
He is confused by their meanness
# 2 Yeah
Where are your pubes
All eyes are on him, waiting for a response
The kid's mental wheels turn frantically
And from somewhere comes an attitude, a swagger, and somehow the perfect line arrives from what could only be a merciful deity
(cool, dismissive) had 'em
shaved 'em off
It is a new persona for the kid -- the witty guy
And it works
Guy #2 cracks up, then others
William's new accuser is suddenly surrounded by the impressed gales of laughter of these older boys
Others turn away, on to other things
Tobin stares at William, and then also turns away
10
-- 						10 William jumps into the backseat of the white Ford Country Sedan station wagon, carrying books
("See ya pubes
")  Mom continues driving William and Anita home from school
(cheerfully, by rote, to William in back) Put on your seatbelt
don't want you flying through the windshield
Anita examines her own un-fastened seatbelt, which Mom hasn't noticed
We got our annuals today -- (cheerful, automatic) "Received" your annual
(looking at his photo) look so much younger than everyone else
Enjoy it while you can
Camera drifts from Mom to Anita, who can take it no longer
Mom
It's time
(pleasant, pointed) Can this wait until we get home
Mom, pull over
Tell him the truth
Tell him how old he is
Mom pulls over, and stares straight ahead with deep irritation
(as in "be quiet") He knows how old he is
The other kids make fun of him because of How young he looks
Nobody includes him
They call him "The Narc" behind his back
They do
What's a "Narc
" (bleeding for her brother) Narcotics Officer
Well what's wrong with that
(ever the peacemaker) Come on you guys
It's no big deal
'm 12
It's okay
She skipped me a grade, it's okay
Big deal
'm a year younger
They're 13, 'm 12 -- (beat) Aren't
Their silence is eloquent
(confessing, in a rush) also put you in first grade when you were five and never told you
(trembling) So
'm
how old
heavy quiet
She and his sister ignore him, as they now debate the subject with each other
You lied to him
You make such a big deal about the truth and you lied
(that one hurts) He never asked
What -- like he's going to ask if he's as old as he thinks he is
Don't you realize, this is going to scar him forever
Honey
sweetheart
don't be Cleopatra
We have to be his mother and his Dad
You put too much pressure on him
(apprehensive) How
old
And when he rebels in some strange and odd way, don't blame me
am
(matter of fact) skipped you an extra grade
You're eleven
(horrified, voice crackling) He looks at his body, the information affects him physically
New sounds come from way down deep inside
Mom now begins speed-rapping, trying to stem the leak
She starts the car
So you skipped fifth grade
There's too  much padding In the grades taught elementary school
5th grade - unnecessary
Nothing happens in the 5th grade
All Teachers know it, no one talks about it
(still in shock) - leven
And you skipped kindergarten because taught it to you when you were four
(still horrified, looking at his body) This explains
so much
You've robbed him of an adolescence
Adolescence is a marketing tool
He's got no "crowd"
no friends
Okay
Anita reaches out to her brother
With the compassion of a saint, she offers this: Honey,  know you were expecting puberty
You're just going to have to shine it on for a while
Deeply embarrassed, William shrinks down in the seat
Mom monitors his face constantly
She is raw and sincere
and yes, inspiring: Who needs a "crowd
"  You're unique
You're two years ahead of everybody
Take those extra years and do what you want
Go to Europe for a year
Take a look around, see what you like
Follow your dream
You'll still be the youngest lawyer in the country
Your own great grandfather practiced law until he was 93
Your dad was so proud of you
He knew you were a pronominally accelerated child
What about me
(heartbroken, can't help herself) You're rebellious and ungrateful of my love
Well, somebody's gotta be normal around here
(blinking, still can't believe it) Eleven
11
'  -- 					11 William finishes the last of many candy bars
mound of wrappers sit just below the mirror
He examines his face hopefully for zits
Nothing coming
We begin to hear Simon and Garfunkel's "America
" 12
- 						12 Anita stands in the living room
The song continues playing on the stereo
want to play you a song that explains why 'm leaving, and try to listen
We can't talk
We have to listen to rock music
13
-- 						13 William watches sadly
Anita's good-looking boyfriend , a dead ringer for young Stephen Stills, loads her suitcases into a large turqouise Chevy
The suitcases are adorned with plastic stick-on flowers
All coolness is leaving William's life
Mom watches nearby, worried and helpless
(Their house is more austere, less "fun" than the other front lawns
) Take good care of her in San Francisco, man
Darryl gives the kid a sub-human look
He's invisible, too young to converse with
How can she leave such a loving family
Anita turns and heads towards them
She focuses on William, placing her hands on his young shoulders
Her face is very close to him now, as she delivers this sage prediction of the future
One day you'll be cool
He nods stoically, hopefully
He is utterly lost
She leans forward and whispers in his ear
(cont'd) Look under your bed
It'll set you free
Anita shakes hands with Mom, and exits
As the car takes off: She'll be back
In the distance we hear the whoop of her daughter
-
Maybe not soon
William watches wistfully
He moves away from his mother
She pulls him closer
Shot moves in on his slightly fearful face
14
'  - 						14 Anita looks back at the receding American Gothic-image of her mother and brother
Sister waves to brother
She feels for him
Music now shifts to The Who's "Sparks
" 15
-- 						15 William locks the door
He reaches under his bed
It's a black leatherette travel bag, with tartan design
He unzips the bag -- it's filled with albums
He flips through the amazing, subversive cache of music
Cream's Wheels of Fire
the seminal Bob Dylan bootleg Great White Wonder
the Rolling Stones' Get Yer Ya Ya's Out
The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds
Abraxas by Santana
Jethro Tull's Stand Up
The Mother's of Invention's We're Only In It For The Money
Led Zeppelin
Crosby, Stills and Nash
Miles Davis' Bitches Brew
and The Who's Tommy
with a note taped to it
(
) "Listen to Tommy with a candle burning and you will see your entire future
" The heady effect of all these albums registers, as we see him lighting a candle
:  1973 blue school notebook, with ballpoint pen renderings of the names of groups like the Who and Led Zeppelin, complete with carefully drawn thunderbolts
Also, the name
16
-- 					16 William, now 15, sits in class with book, Adventures in Journalism
His hair is shoulder-length
dedicated teacher, , walks the aisles
Music continues
17
- 						17 William presses the food machine button, pulls an orange from a vending container
He still looks younger than most of the students
and these days, especially the girls
18
-- 						18 William sits apart from all the others, under a tree
He reads intently, happily, as he eats the orange
It's a copy of Creem Magazine
Music continues
Camera moves across the photos, catching the expressions and fashions of the rock heroes of the day
Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull, eyes wide and hair flying as he plays flute
Neil Young, enigmatic with perfectly patched Levis
The Southern Rock Royalty of The Allman Brothers Band, posing and laughing in front of massive stacks of amps
Marc Bolan of
Rex, his ringlet-hair backlit by stage lights
David Bowie in skin-tight Japanese one- piece attire, onstage with The Spiders From Mars
Pete Townsend of the Who, slashing windmill-style at his guitar
Drift down to a by-line - by Lester Bangs
19
- 						19 William walks through the parking lot after school
Everybody now congregates around the new arrival of their lives - their own cars
Arms suddenly clap William on the back, friendly faces smile strangely, laughing
He takes a few steps and looks up to see
a school official is hurriedly removing something from the high-school marquee
- which reads:        ( ) All are laughing
He laughs with them, and turns as his face goes slack
He shrugs, marches on
20
-- 			20 The song we've been listening to is ripped off the turntable by a highly-active man in a red promotional t-shirt proclaiming the greatness of The Guess Who
He is a ferocious, lumbering, music- driven presence, and he fills this small radio studio to the very brim
This is  , 25, the rarely-seen God of a then new art-form -- Rock Journalism
Disc-jockey with long- long hair watches helplessly
William views all this through a glass window
He stands on the corner of a downtown side street, halfway up a steep incline
He is the only person on the streets this early Saturday morning
Reveal that he is watching a live radio show, audible to us through the small p
a
speaker overhead
- Quite an honor to have the World's Greatest Rock Critic
and editor of Creem Magazine, back Home in San Diego for a few days -- Lester Bangs
What is this hippie station
Where's Iggy Pop
Don't you have a copy of Raw Power
- Lester, isn't it a little early for this
Bangs searches for the album -- vinyl flying everywhere now, with no regard for album jackets
Found it
21
-- 						21 William watches intently
Bangs thuds the needle onto a copy of Raw Power
We're rewarded with a blast of Iggy and the Stooges' "Search and Destroy
"    closer shot on William now watching the whirlwind of anarchy inside
Lester does an Iggy Pop impression, acting out a story for the d
j
that we cannot hear, never noticing the kid soaking in everything from the other side of this double-glass window
22
--  -- 				22 Bangs walks with William on this sharply inclined San Diego street
It's early, the streets are silent
Bangs is about fifteen beer pounds overweight
His jeans are loose, his paleness and messy moustache an emblem of the long days and nights spent writing
In there somewhere is a good-looking guy
His hands are thrust deeply into his pockets, and he takes big sweeping steps
So you're the one who's been sending me those articles from your school newspaper - 've been doing some stuff for a local underground paper, too
What are you like the star of your school
They hate me
You'll meet them all again on their long journey to the middle
The kid nods, they walk
(cont'd) Well, your writing is damn good
It's just a shame you missed out on rock and roll
did
Oh yeah
It's over
Over
Over
You got here just in time for the death rattle, the last gasp, the last grope
Well
At least 'm here for that
Bangs looks at the much smaller kid, shaking his head
It's too late for newcomers
But if the kid's age is an issue, he doesn't mention it
Like a machine-gun: What do you type on
Smith-Corona Galaxis Deluxe
You like the new Lou Reed
(automatic) The early stuff
The new stuff, he's trying to be Bowie, he should be himself
'm not a big Lou man
Yeah, but if Bowie's doing Lou, and Lou's Doing Bowie, Lou's still doing Lou
(standing his ground) If you like Lou
Take drugs
No
Smart kid
used to do speed and sometimes Nyquil and stay up all night writing and writing, like 25 pages of dribble about, you know, the Guess Who, or Coltrane, just to write, you know, with the music blasting
Me too
The writing part
For a moment, the serious demeanor dissolves and the oddest thing happens
Bangs laughs
It's an odd and charming laugh, the kind a tough guy keeps well-hidden
It surprised the kid, who smiles back
Bangs stops at the corner, and offers a pleasant but very final nod of the head
Well, alright
It's been nice to meet you
'll see you around
Keep sending me your stuff
Okay
See you
can't stand here all day talking to my many fans
- But neither have anywhere to go on this early downtown morning
They stand for a beat, hands in pockets, on this deserted street
They are alone together, there's nobody else in sight
23
-- 							23 William listens intently as Lester eat a sandwich
His face is an open book filling with words
-- so anyway, you're from San Diego and that's good
Because once you go to
, you're gonna have friends like crazy but they'll be fake friends, they're gonna try to corrupt you
The publicists
The bands
You got an honest face, they're gonna tell you everything
But you  make friends with the rock stars
The kid takes out a green collegiate notebook and gestures -- can  make a note
Bangs nods
(cont'd) Cannot make friends with the rock stars
(savage bite) That's what's important
If you're a rock journalist, a true journalist -- first you will never get paid much
But you will get free records from the record company
The kid's eyes widen
Bangs, in direct conflict with his brutal writing style, is looking suspiciously like a compassionate softie
(cont'd) And they'll buy you drinks, you'll meet girls
they'll try to fly you places for free
offer you drugs
know
It sounds great
But they are not your friends
These are people who want you to write sanctimonious stories about the genius of the rock stars and they will ruin rock and roll and strangle everything we love about it
Privately, William thrills
We
Our
It all sounds great to him
He listens to the grouping of the words, every one of them
He madly scribbles
(cont'd) They are trying to buy respectability for a form that is gloriously and righteously - The kid leans forward as Lester finds the right word
(cont'd) dumb
And you're smart enough to know that
And the day it ceases to be dumb is the day it ceases to be real
Right
And then it will just Become an Industry of Cool
Industry
of
cool
And that's what they want
And it's happening right now
'm telling you, you're coming along at a very dangerous time for rock and roll
The war is over
They won
99% of what passes for rock now
is much more compelling
It's over
think you should turn around and go back and be
a lawyer or something
but can see from your face that you won't
can pay you thirty-five bucks
Gimme a thousand words on Black Sabbath
(attempting cool) An assignment
Yeah
And you should build your reputation on being honest
and unmerciful
(writing in notebook) Honest
unmerciful
And if you get into a jam -- call me
stay up late
Bangs reaches across the table, and William watches as he scribbles his number on the back of the kid's green collegiate notebook
The notebook has just become valuable
They sit together, listening to the beautiful and compelling silence
24
-- 						24 Mom drives William to the San Diego Sports Arena
She looks out the window at the adrenalized concert-goers
She feels protective not just of her son, but an entire generation
William goes over his questions for Black Sabbath
Look at this
An entire generation of Cinderellas and there's no slipper coming
William looks out the window at the sign:  -   - with special guest Stillwater
You can drop me off here
Black
Sabbath
Just remember - you wanted to be Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird
The kid doesn't answer
He silently goes over his questions
(cont'd) As long as  know this is just a hobby, 'll go along with it
All  have to do is listen
That's what Lester Bangs said
(dryly) 'll be waiting right here at eleven 'o clock sharp
If you get lost, use the family whistle
He unhooks his seatbelt, stuffs his questions into an orange canvas shoulder-bag and exits
Elaine watches her son disappearing into the stony rock-concert crowd
It's a windy night
Everything about this image troubles her
She fights with herself, and then uses the family whistle immediately
He turns
(cont'd) (sweetly, too loud) Don't take drugs
Fifteen concert-goers turn around instinctively, at the sound of a Mother, and then identify William as the object of her concern
All around him, we hear: Don't take drugs
He winces, nods and moves forward
Music echoes from the open windows of many other cars
25
-- 		 25 The kid tromps down the steep incline leading to a small steel backstage arena door
He rings the buzzer
The door wheezes open to reveal the keeper of the San Diego Sports Arena's backstage list
Famous to all those who attempt to enter, this is
He is a wiry, humorless man for whom powerlessness is the theme of his life -- except for those few hours he controls the list
Scotty is only forty but everything about him screams that he's an angry sixty
Hi
'm William Miller and 'm here from Creem Magazine to interview the band Black Sabbath
Scotty, immediately suspicious, moves to a nearby podium and snaps through three clipboard pages
He moves back to the door and grabs the handle
Not on the list
He shuts the door with finality
The kid stands silently for a moment
He looks over his shoulder, at two chattering Groupies watching his dilemma from the top of the ramp
They look at him sympathetically, but he turns away
William rings the buzzer again, withdrawing a copy of Creem from his bag
The door opens
Sir, 'm a journalist, and here's a copy of the magazine
The magazine hangs in mid-air
You're not on the list
Go to the top of the ramp with the girls
Slam
William stands there for a moment
Unsure of what to do next, he looks back to the top of the ramp
Rejected by him just moments earlier, the groupies now feign disinterest
Bracing himself, William rings again
The door opens slowly this time
Scotty stands peering at him
(in a rush) What-happens-after--go-to-the-top-of- the-ramp with-the-gi - Slam
Lock
26
-- 				26 William inches into the realm of the girls at the top of the ramp
The wind whips
It's just him, and two Groupies in their evening best
They now pretend to barely notice the young journalist who has been banished to stand with them
Chattering excitedly, with sophistication far beyond her 17 years, is
She sports long unruly black hair
Her partner hangs in the shadows, adjusting shoes
Estrella turns to the kid with great disinterest
Who are you with
(embarrassed to be alive) Me
'm with myself
No, who are you with
What band
'm here to interview Black Sabbath
(beat) 'm a journalist
'm not a
you know
Estrella stares at him
Moving into the parking lot light, introducing herself, is a luminous girl in a green faux-fur trimmed coat
This is
There is an inviting warmth and real interest in the way she asks: you're not a what
(enthralled) Oh
'm just
not a
you know
Not a "what"
(charmed) You know
"groupie
" The two girls are deeply insulted by the word
Ohhh
Sorry,  - We
Are not
"Groupies
" Estrella indicates Penny with great reverence
This is Penny Lane, man
Show some respect
-- sorry
Penny steps closer, focusing completely on the kid
Behind her, concert-goers throw a few woo-woos their way
She seems not to hear them
"Groupies" sleep with rock stars because they want to be near someone famous
We are here because of the music
We are Band Aids
She used to run a school for Band Aids
We don't have intercourse with these guys
We support the music
We inspire the music
We are here because of the music
William is nodding like a doll in a dashboard window
Listening
Marc Bolan broke her heart, man
It's famous
It's a long story
'm retired now
'm just visiting friends
She was the one who changed everything
She said "no more sex, no more exploiting our bodies and hearts
" Right
Right
"
just blow-jobs, and that's it
Okay
Well, see, now  get the difference
Shot drifts off him and picks up, out of the darkness, another breathless girl teetering on tall shoes
She is in the vicinity of 16
Her black hair is cropped short and died red, just like the cover of Bowie's Aladdin Sane
She is , the voluptuous one, from Riverside
(the usual greeting) It's all happening
It's all happening
Polexia
Did you tell Sabbath we were going to be here
talked to Dick with Stillwater, talked with Sabbath
They're all dying to see us
It's all happening
This is our journalist friend
Journalist Friend, meet Estrella Starr, and Polexia Aphrodisia
And you are -- William
Silent beat
His name lands like a thud
Here comes Sabbath
Ozzy
Tony
It's us
long black limo with darkened windows swishes past, beeps twice
The metal backstage gate rises and the limo rolls inside
And then silence again
The girls do not discuss being rebuffed
(cont'd) think  saw Sapphire in there
(can't hold it in any longer) Okay
was with Ian Hunter all night at Rodney's Last night
Wanna see his spoo
saved it in a baggie
She opens her purse and shows the girls something inside
William edges away
(peering into purse) 'm really happy he's doing so well
(regarding what's in purse) Yeah
know he's such a talented guy
mean, look at him
Who deserves it more
(looking in purse) Nobody -- he's so sweet
(with compassion) Don't you just root for him, you know
To go that little distance between good and great
Wait
That's not his
would know his
very odd look on his face, William now cranes for a discreet look
What's in that purse
-- Out steps , 19, a tall girl with taller platforms
Heavy eye-makeup
Her accent is Texan, with odd traces of English
In one hand is a half-drained bottle of champagne
In the other, a fistful of backstage passes
Does anybody remember laugh-tah
(as they turn) Come and  '
The girls scream and happily head down the ramp to Sapphire
Penny looks back and grabs William with a well-placed arm hooked around his
He joins the clacking sea of legs moving down the ramp
Sapphire slaps passes on the girls
As Scotty (The Keeper  of the Backstage List) watches, Penny now slips William forward for a pass
Oh no
Not this one -- (off William) Who brought Opie
The kid looks over his shoulder
Who's Opie
He's with us
(hand blocking William) He wasn't with you
(to Scotty) Are you going to turn this into a Thing
All of you can wait outside
Top of the ramp
don't want to cause a Thing
'll wait
(privately, to William) 'll go take care of this
Sadly, they leave him behind
The thundering arena sound of the collecting crowd, the p
a
system blasting Yes' "Roundabout"
purposeful roadies carrying guitar cases
the glimpse of backstage rock and roll
everything he wants to be a part of is on the other side of this door
And then it shuts
He stands alone
At the top of the ramp, a tour bus unloads
It reads -- 73
Moving loudly out of the bus is the opening band
This is Stillwater
Four road-weary band members, and their road manager
Voices booming
, 27, presses the buzzer with the nose of his guitar-case
It's obvious from moment one
This is the star of the band, the charismatic one
He's tired
They're late
William recognizes him instantly, as the guitarist stretches
The buzzer goes unanswered
The kid is invisible to him, as the others now arrive behind Russell
Tour/band manager  , 27, follows, loudly banging on the steel door
He has the flaxen-haired look of a former hippie, but he carries the emblem of a real pro -- the newest silver Halliburton briefcase covered with backstage passes
His direction is always - forward
Let us in, we're Stillwater
We're on the show
William is surrounded by them now
They stand together under the single lightbulb, familiar faces, a live-action album cover the singer, his shiny black hair hanging in sheets around his head
the quiet drummer, his long arms hanging limply at his sides
His is a face made for the background the compact bass-player
Dick now kicks at the door with his foot, as William produces a copy of Creem Magazine
(to Dick) Hi, 'm a journalist
write for Creem Magazine
Once again, the magazine hangs there
He can't give it away
The enemy
rock writer
(struggling forward) 'd like to interview you or someone from the band
(busy, running behind) 'm sorry but could you please fuck off
William blinks a little, takes it in stride
Russell sizes him up, moving in the background
Okay
Okay
could do that
You guys never listened to our records
You're all just frustrated musicians
Do you know what your magazine about us
What was it - "the singer's incessant cater walling distracts From an assault with no clear purpose
" (in background) That was Rolling Stone
Yeah
Okay
Fuck off anyway
We play for fans, not critics
Stung, William shrugs
It's been a terrible night, but at least thrillingly so
Russell
Jeff
Ed
Larry
(can't help it) really love your band
think the song "Fever Dog" is a big step forward for you guys
think you guys producing it yourselves, instead of Glyn Johns, was the right thing to do
And the guitar sound was incendiary
(gestures with fist) Way to go
He turns and leaves, beginning his long trek back up the ramp
Russell looks at the others
That kind of love is hard to give up
(good humored, yelling) Well don't stop there
Yeah, come back here
Keep going
They wave him back, as the backstage door opens again
The kid moves back down the ramp
They herd him in with them, through the door
Scotty quickly spots the kid and squares off
Russell notes the kid's swirling emotional state, shoves him forward
Not this one
He's with us
He's not with you
He's not with them
He's not on the list
He's not coming in
And this is my arena
And furthermore - Russel craves the confrontation and moves forward closer to Scotty
(cont'd) - have a good time tonight
Welcome to San Diego
27
-- 					27 The band moves quickly down the hallway, with William moving to keep up
young and grizzled red-haired roadie,  , catches them on the way
The band swarms around him
Red Dog
We're playing here tomorrow night
(aside, to the kid) This is Red Dog, the Allman Brothers Band's number one roadie
Russel clamps an arm around Red Dog's neck
How're the guys
Havin a ball, man
When we have a party, we have an Allman Brothers Band party
Everybody boogies
Everybody gets off
It's family, man
We all got These now
(flashes new mushroom tattoo on forearm) We'll see you guys in Boston, right
(specifically to Russell) Dicky and Gregg send you their love
Camera catches flash of envy on the face of Jeff Bebe, as Stillwater sweeps forward into a small dressing room
28
-- 					28 Dressing room activity swirls around him, as William simply listens
He holds a small microphone
His stoic look gives away little of the full body rush he's experiencing
As the other band members drift across frame, Russell Hammond, a true rock and roll believer, speaks as he straps on his guitar and gets ready for the show
To the kid, every word is reckless gem
and it's okay, because rock and roll is a
and a way of thinking and it's not about money and "popularity
" Some money would be nice
Jeff sprays some shaving cream into his palm, and rubs it into his scalp - poor man's mousse
- but it's a voice that says here am
and   if you can't understand me
Russell smooths the strings of his guitar with a small cloth from his guitar case
The kid notices all these close-up details of rock
(cont'd) And one of those people is gonna save the world and that means that -- all of us together
The kid's eyes dance
He checks to make sure he's getting the recording
He listens intently
And the chicks are great
But we didn't do it for that
We are here because we needed to fuckin be here, not just 'cause we needed to away from Troy, Michigan, but what it all comes down to is that thing
The Indefinable Thing, when people catch something from your music, the thing you put into it
'm talking about
what am  talking about
(elegantly) The buzz
And the chicks, the whatever, is an off-shoot of
And like -- you saying you liked "Fever Dog
"   That is the fucking buzz, man
All we get are these fucking old-ass interviewers who don't understand, don't , don't appreciate why we are here, which is the fuckin'
William nods, holds his microphone steady
Russell tunes his guitar, ripping through unamplified guitar licks as he speaks
Jeff hustles to reclaim his own connection to the interviewer
The next album will be even better
More texture
But
it's not what you put in, is it
It's what you leave out
Listen to
listen to Marvin Gaye
Russell's face grows rapturous as he discusses this piece of music
(cont'd) song like "What's Going On
"  That single "woo" at the end of the second verse - you know that woo - that single "woo
" (proudly) know that, "woo
" (he does it) That's what you remember
The silly things, the little things
there's only one, and it makes the song
It's what you leave out
That's rock and roll
William nods, says nothing, keeps the microphone pointed
Activity surrounds him
(impressed) We used to talk more about this stuff
Okay
See, this is maybe the most honest we've ever been in an interview because you know our music
You're the first press guy we've made friends with
We don't normally talk like this to them
And you're supposed to be The Enemy
What are you - 18
Yeah
There you go
Still young enough to be honest
(walkie talkie crackling) Ten minutes 'till showtime, anyone who isn't in the band -- out
Russell takes a last swig of beer
roadie whisks his guitar away
(cont'd) All this luggage is going to
William is swept out in the chaos of the pre-show ritual, past the pile of luggage by the door
It's a colorful heap of suitcases, featuring colorful laminated band tags, each with a number
29
--  --  			29 William sits on the backstage steps, writing feverishly in his notebook
Behind him, two steps higher, Penny Lane scoots into place
found you a pass
(amped, distracted) Thanks
got in with Stillwater
(as he writes) The guitarist, Russel Hammond, he just thoroughly opened up
He is by far the best and most honest interview 've ever done
(she nods) 've only done two, but you know
He's number one
You're learning
They're much more fun on the way up
William nods, still scribbling
She eases down into place on the step next to him
Her proximity cause him to look at her, his eyebrows rising
She smooths them down with two single fingers
(cont'd) How old are you
Eighteen
Me too
(beat) How old are we really
Seventeen
Me too
Actually 'm 16
Me too
Isn't it funny
The truth just sounds Different
(confesses) 'm 15
You want to know how old  really am
(immediately) No
She looks upstairs, soaking in the sound of another band tuning up
Music is her religion
(cont'd) How did you get started in all this
It's a long story
(quick study) Right
Right
We live in the same city
We should be friends
She takes his backstage pass form his shirt and puts it on his thigh - the cooler location
Nearby, the dressing room door opens, and the Stillwater exits
Excitement level rises as they mass in the hallway with instruments
We hear the amped voice of Russell growing nearer
The Enemy
He approaches, as William stands
Penny watches, hanging out of Russell's eyesight
Standing in the supercharged hallway, the kid is anxious to introduce his new friends
Russell, this is Penny Lane
(stepping into view) Pleasure
Penny Lane
Like the song, right
Have we met
And do not let go, for too long
There is history in their shake
Their eyes tell all
Shot takes us to William, who puts two and two together
It isn't hard
They clearly know each other
Well
Well,  guess you've
you've met
Penny Lane
God's gift to rock and roll
You're back
(privately) Marc Bolan
Please
Other band members pass, adjusting clothes for show time, waiting in the hallway
and now singing the Beatles song "Penny Lane
" Come on, let's go
(noting kid's shyness) Both of you
30
-- 						30 House lights go down
Cheers rise
Dick's flashlight dances on the ground just in front of them, guiding their way in the dark to the stage steps
- get in the huddle
Russell pulls William into the band's huddle
Their band ritual, psyching together, arms on each other's shoulders in a circle
They sing a dew lines of the classic "Train Kept -Rollin'" (or "Go See Cal" from the Cal Worthington ad) They all touch feet, and then break, heading for the stage
Russell directs Penny to his side of the stage
The kid follows
Plugging in, still in darkness, Russell hits a practice chord -- thwack
He steps on effects pedal
Applause
(Adlib onstage private patter, between members, goading each other -- the stuff no audience ever hears)  Twenty feet away, Dick prepares to address the crowd from the darkened stage
It is his favorite moment of the evening, the highlight of his job
From Troy, Michigan
Please welcome -- (importantly) Stillwater
Light hits the stage, and the band launches into their opening song, "If You Say Nothing
"  Audience response is strong
Shot lingers on the face of William as he soaks in the most undeniably exciting moment of any concert, the first thirty seconds
Jeff the singer grabs the microphone and launches into some vocal pyrotechnics
Russell looks over to Penny and William, at stage right, grinning, pretending to trip on his cord, an elegant show-off move of a musician who is now where he belongs
before seriously stepping forward for the first guitar lead of the night
The kid looks over to see Penny watching Russell
31
--  -- 					31 Cases are shut and rolled toward the trucks
Stillwater heads for their bus
Jeff the singer says goodbye to Estrella Starr, like a sailor leaving port
Russell lingers behind, saying goodbye to William, loading his own equipment
Black Sabbath passes with entourage, heading to the stage
(privately) So
You want to come up to
, we'll be at the "Riot House" all week
"The Riot House
" The Continental Hyatt House
It's on Sunset Strip
(attempting cool) Right
Right
All the while, just over the kid's shoulder, Russell scans the backstage crowd of hangers-on
Looking perhaps for Penny Lane
Let's blow this burg
(exiting) Well tell your friend Miss Penny Lane to Call Me
Tell her "It ain't California without her
We want her around like last summer
"   Say it like that
Got it
(returns, whispers) Oh, 'm under the name - Harry Houdini
(exiting, to William) The Enemy
Yeah
Come to
, we'll take some more
Russell joins Jeff, exiting and laughing
good show is still in the air
Later Jeff
See you, Dick
Larry
Ed
(and now the roadies) Mick, Gregg, Red Dog, Scully, Frosty, Estrella, The Wheel
Laterrrr
We'll see you down the line
William is deliriously happy, hands upraised
He turns to see Penny
(calming him) Hey
Hey
Be cool
You just missed Russell
He says he's at the "Riot House" all week and to call him
He's under the name Harry Houdini
Do you know about the "Riot House
" think 've heard of it
He had a message for you
He said, "It's not California without you
We want you around like last summer
" (consults notebook) Actually he said "ain't
"  "It ain't California - " get the gist
How well do you guys know each other
She smiles privately
(cont'd) got it
No problem
Long story
Alright
gotta go
Elsewhere in the arena, Black Sabbath is performing "Sweet Leaf
"  The kid could care less
He has bonded with Stillwater
He heads for the door
Penny walks with him
He's loving it
They pass a still-scowling Scotty, flashing passes, as they exit out into the ramp area
32
-- 					32 Penny takes out an eyeliner pencil, writes her number on the back of his green notebook
Call me if you need a rescue
We live in the same city
think  live in a different world
They stand in the night air
The parking lot is largely silent now, save for the thudding bass sounds of Black Sabbath
In the distance, we hear Elaine's insistent whistle
Speaking of the world
've made a decision
(a very serious secret) 'm going to live in Morocco for one year
need a new crowd
He nods
He is a rapt audience for this flashy girl
(cont'd) Do you want to come
Yes
In the distance, we hear the family whistle growing louder
It's a plan
You've got to call me
Okay
It's all happening
It's all happening
He nods cooly
He waits until she turns, and the sprints through the parking lot, to the distant family whistle
: : 33      							33 William's fingers work the clunky keys, pressing rewind
We hear a snippet of the intense and lively Stillwater interview, full of overlapping and barely discernible voices
Meticulously, he untangles the voices, especially Russell's, as he transcribes
'  - The work of a journalist, as William sits at his Smith-Corona Galaxis
There is a knock at the window, and William scoots back in his chair to see a familiar face
It is Darryl, his sister's old boyfriend
William opens the window
Hey Darryl
Hey
Darryl climbs in the window, looks around the room that was once the site of his previous glory
(cont'd) So she's a stewardess now
Yeah
She and Mom are still sorta
'd say "not speaking," but  don't know if they ever did
Your sister
stewardess
(nods to himself) The things your sister and  did inside these four walls
That's okay
don't want to know
It's my room now
We flew the friendly skies - Okay - don't want to put you in the middle of anything
We don't have to talk about it
No
You seem cooler
Yeah
'm thinking about going to Morocco
Lemme know if you need a little help with your Mom
little might not be enough
She still freaks me out
(nods, an old issue) Yeah - She's famous
Listen - Go ahead and do what you were doing
just wanna hang in here for a moment
Cool
Alright
William nods and continues his work, self-consciously, as Darryl sits on his bed and soaks in the memories of the room
long moment passes
Darryl pats his thighs, and rises
Okay, man
Okay, man
34
-- 					34 William slips on corduroy jacket, over a tie-dyed shirt
Well, it's definitely a look
Mom appears more nervous than her son
worry about the drunk drivers
Mom
'm 15
(beat, vague panic) Right
Yes, you're 15
"And here's that money owed you
" She reaches in a small box near the door, gives him twenty bucks
It's their routine
(cont'd) Your dad's favorite joke
don't do it as well
thought it was pretty good
Keep the small bills on the outside
And call me if anyone gets drunk
will call you if anyone anywhere gets drunk
Good
(anticipating her, like a parent) And don't take drugs
(stoic) Ha ha
Very funny
See -- sense of humor
Have fun at the dance
'm glad you're making friends
They move to the door, and he steadies her, as if to remind her she's not going
He opens the door
She's a wreck, and she knows it
Mom
Yeah - (loving but firm, as if to a dog
) Stay
Oh
okay
-love-you-bye
He opens the door

She's not getting any better at it either
She folds her arms tightly across her chest

'  -- 					35 Penny waist by her car, down the hill, sporting a different more elegant look
She cups her hands and yells up to him
He hikes down the hill, squishing down the water plants, almost falling, the first time we've seen him happy in his own skin
36
--  				36 Miss Penny Lane's yellow Vega makes the big swing onto Sunset Boulevard
She sings along to the obscure words of Led Zeppelin's "Dancing Days
"  William takes it all in from the passenger seat
Huge billboards advertise not cigarettes or beer, but albums
It's a wondrous piece of geography for any rock fan
Shot moves in as William, watches, takes it all in
He moves his head outside the window to see fully
Her windshield is cracked along the side
The Continental Hyatt House
Also known as The Riot House
(does tour guide voice) Every band stays here, all the ones that matter
The Who
Zeppelin
Alice
Bowie
English bands
American bands
We all know each other
Twenty- four hour room service
Like us, they were outsiders
They were so outside, they're inside, and insiders never even knew it, because they're outsiders and they are inside a place outsiders will never be
And why are we even talking about it
If you're really an insider, you're never gonna say it
You know what  mean
(beat, working it out) Yeah
Yes
She makes a swift turn into a secret parking spot near the hotel
And we're not gonna hang out with Russell
You can, but not me
What is it with you and Russell
37
-- 					37 Neil Young and Crazy Horse's "Cinnamon Girl" ricochets across the Strip
It's blasting from cars tuned into
Penny now wears her green faux-fur trimmed coat
She grabs William's hand, steadying her hat at the same time
They dart across the busy street
She stumbles a little on her platforms
He steadies his taller date
They are a good team as they pass one of several humming tour busses parked out front
38
-- 					38 Penny blasts into the Continental Hyatt House, William on her arm
The lobby of this bastion of seventies rock is more alive than most clubs
It's a swirling mass of Roadies carrying Halliburton briefcases plastered with tour stickers, mingling Rockers, and more than a few Groupies with lower-ambitions and taller-platforms than Penny Lane
The feeling is communal, illicit, intoxicating
The secret community of rock
Penny attracts a hailstorm of friends and comrades
It's all happening
(grabbing him like a shield) And 'm about to use you as protection
# 1 Penny Lane
(aside) These guys are with Alice Cooper
'm going to pretend  don't know them
# 2 Penny
Does Alice know you're here
'm just showing my very dear, very wonderful friend around
He's a very important writer - he knows Lester Bangs
(English accent) 'm responsible for his moral conduct while he's abroad
# 3 (arriving, mock drama) Penny Lane
God's gift to rock and roll
'm retired
(uses English accent) And don't argue with me
# 3 Again
(moving, English accent) Have we met
Effortlessly touching an arm here and there, charming all - she had four men suddenly circling her
(cont'd) 've made a decision
'm going to go traveling in India
Then 'm going to learn how to play the violin
Then 'm going to go to college for one year
William looks at her, perplexed and a little hurt
What about Morocco
# 2 (exiting, not buying it) There's nothing they could teach you in college, darling
(whispers) Call Alice
He's under the name Bob Hope
# 1 heard you were with Russell from Stillwater
Please
throw the little ones back
Lusty laughs circle William
Overlapping this dialogue is the appearance of our friend Polexia
(in tears, in pieces, emotional) Ian Hunter is a fucking asshole
Polexia
Opie
She hugs him like a long-lost friend, knocking the air out of him
And now overlapping this action, appears Superfan , 14
His eyes are forever moist, but he's oddly formal and never feels worthy of the rockers he idolizes
Tonight he wears a custom homemade t-shirt with iron-on block letters
It features the four Led Zeppelin symbols and the words: " "   felt-tip pen is still in his quivering hand
Nunez walks with them, backpedaling as he says: It's all happening
just saw them on the seventh floor
Mr
Jimmy Page
Mr
John Paul Jones
(displays squiggle on shirt) Mr
Robert Plant signed my shirt in the elevator
Five minutes ago, he touched this pen
Please don't smear it
And Bonzo's gotta new motorcycle in the hotel
Ric is a Zeppelin fan
Yeah,  picked that up
He tours with them, but not "with" them
They're on the 12th floor, but there's guards there
So you gotta go to the tenth floor and go up the back steps
This is my very dear, very close, very wonderful friend William Miller, he is very close with Lester Bangs
It's all happening
See you in Cleveland
Ric rushes back to the elevators
'm retired
Doesn't anybody believe me

He shouts over the din
Harry Houdini, please
As he waits, he discreetly pockets the matches, hotel pad and pencil next to the housephone

/'   -- 			40 William, Polexia and an ambivalent Penny walk the hallway, looking for the room
William looks in the passing open doors, each one a different window into another world
Okay
Time to put on the lampshade
Up ahead, the door to their smallish hotel room is open
Inside, a band party in full swing
clunky early-model boom box segues from James Brown's "Make It Funky" to Led Zeppelin's "Gallows Pole
"   Russell Hammond is the center of this party, jabbing out the chords, playing along on guitar
Much singing echoes all around
It's a hotel-room Hootenanny, and all members of the band are present
Penny Lane takes a breath and enters, with arms extended and pointing in opposite directions
She does a flawless stewardess imitation, with proper hand gestures, to a loud party ovation
(cont'd) "Ladies and Gentlemen
Please extinguish all smoking materials and notice that the captain has turned on The No Smoking sign
Your seat and tray tables should be locked in their full and upright positions
" / She is instantly and overwhelmingly, the life of this party
Russell joins William
(impressed to see him) Alright
(happy to be there) Alright
Russell places a beer in William's hands, and exits
(continuing) "In the unlikely event of a water landing, the seat below you will serve as a -" (give up) Oh, the hell with it
They all applaud her, laughing
William watches her with wonder, as she turns his way and winks
Jeff approaches the alluring Polexia, and goes to get her a beer
Meanwhile, Polexia sidles up to William
She sees him watching Penny at the other side of the room
(privately) Act One, in which she pretends she doesn't care about him
shot travels to Russell, strumming the guitar that is always a part of his body
Russell is watching Penny Lane surreptitiously
(cont'd) Act Two, in which he pretends he doesn't care
and goes right for her
Russell moves towards Penny
(cont'd) Act Three, in which it all plays out the way she planned it
She'll eat him alive
(worried) We've got to stop them
Stop them
You were her excuse for coming here
need ice
Penny disappears out the door, across the hallway
Russell follows a moment later
The kid's eyebrows rise
Polexia regards the kid with affection, adjusting his collar and peeling a hair off his jacket
just worry about people using her
You know
'Cause she brings out the good side in everybody else, but what do they do for her
Life kills me
Do you have any pot
Not on me
Do you smoke
No
(attempting to fit in) But
grow it
grow it
Polexia looks at the kid, laughing at his poor job of lying
You're funny
You know, if you were only taller, English, rich, a guitar- player and older
'd be someone else
Yeah
Good point
Jeff appears with her beer, and she whispers in the kid's ear before she exits with Jeff Bebe
(cont'd) Bless me father for  may sin tonight
The kid watches, as the boom box plays an obscure favorite of Russell's, Eddie Giles' "Losin' Boy
"  There is the sound of a motorcycle somewhere down the hallway
41
-- 						41 The ice machine makes new cubes with a grinding noise
Penny puts ice in her glass
Behind her, Russell moves into frame, hands delicately riding the sides of her body
motorcycle roars by, just outside the door, as Penny moves away from Russell's exploring hands
(with real indignation) How does it end
What
You know - the story about the girl who dumps the guy who has an ex-ex wife -- the one we don't talk about -- and gets a hundred
okay, five letters from him, and then doesn't even leave a pass in San Diego
Wake up
'm retired and  never believed you anyway
You're too talented and too good-looking to be trusted and everybody knows it
(smiling, loves it) You're retired like Frank Sinatra is retired
She makes a scoffing noise
He moves to the ice machine, with a glass of his own
(cont'd) Miss Penny Lane
Let me tell you what rock and Roll will miss the day you truly retire
He tosses cubes in his glass, one by one
After the first cube: (cont'd) The way you turn a hotel room into a home
(cube) The way you pick up strays wherever you go
Like Pied Piper
(cube) The way you know the words to every song
Every song
Especially the bad ones
Mostly the bad ones
(cube) That green coat in the middle of summer
(cube) The real name you won't reveal
(cube) And
'd keep going, but my glass if full
(quietly) Damn
He kisses her powerfully, hands at his sides
She fights to keep her hands off him
Bonham's motorcycle rips by, just outside the door
Come to Arizona
Never
We leave Thursday morning

And pack light this time
Jesus
They kiss
The motorcycle speeds by again, just outside
42
-- 						42 The hallways are crowded, as William looks at the closed door of the ice room
He leans against the wall, alone now
Trying to look like he belongs
Behind him, most of the band has disappeared into other rooms, leaving only hangers-on in their places
43
-- 				43 Music
We pan across cubicles bustling with laid-back fervor
These are the San Francisco-based main offices of Rolling Stone Magazine
We have arrived for the waning days that this magazine could still be called, with a straight-face, an "underground" publication
Their mounting success crowds the edges of every frame
Camera catches the Annie Leibowitz portraits that hang on the walls -- Lennon, Jagger, Rod Stewart, James Taylor
We find editor  -, 29,  in his cramped cubicle
Sitting nearby is curly-haired and mustachioed Star Staff writer,  , 32, who smokes his cigarettes with a long holder
Felton reads one of William's articles, chuckling
- William Miller
: '  -- William is on the phone in his own small room
This is he
Crazy
William, this is Ben Fong- Torres
'm the music editor at Rolling Stone Magazine
We've got a copy of your stories from the San Diego Door
This is the same William Miller
William instantly, nervously alters his voice to sound older
Yes it is
(rifling through tearsheets) Voice of God, howling dogs, the spirit of rock And roll
this is good solid stuff
(immediately, suddenly deeper) Thanks
thanks
You should be writing for us
Any ideas
(voice now to deep) How about Stillwater
Crazy
New album
their third
starting to do something
Ben shuffles through papers, looking for a tour itinerary on his promotional-material laden-desk, automatically plotting the piece aloud
(cont'd) (pleasant, terse) Stillwater
Hard-working band makes good
Get 'em to respond to the critics who dismissed the first two albums as workmanlike
Guitarist is the clear star of the band
Crazy
Let's do three- thousand words
You'll catch up to them on the road
We'll set up billing -- don't let the band pay for anything
(affecting casualness) Sounds good
We can only pay -- lemme see, three- thousand words -- seven hundred dollars
The kid's eyes widen
(cont'd) Alright, a grand
What's your background
You a journalism major
(deeply) Yes
What college -- '  -- Elaine now gets on the extension
Honey,  need you to do that thing that fixes the garbage disposal -- She hangs up

--  				44 The great Lester Bangs stands in the promotional album-clogged bedroom of his Birmingham, Michigan, home/office at Creem Magazine
There is nothing in frame that does not deal with music
In the background, a scratchy and chaotic Coltrane record
Beware Rolling Stone Magazine
They will change your story, they'll re- write it and turn it into swill
Beware
But besides that, what would be wrong with it
(laughs, entertained) You have starry eyes, my friend
(beat) Look
Do the story
It's a good break for ya
But remember this -- The kid listens intently, and makes notes
(cont'd) don't do it to make friends with people who are trying to use you to further the big business desire to glorify worthless rock stars like Stillwater
And don't let those swill merchants re-write you
(still copying) swill merchants
Now
What are you listening to

'  -- 					45 William knocks on the teacher's lounge door
Teacher answers, protective of their sanctuary
(urgently) need to talk to Mrs
Deegan, from Journalism
Mrs
Deegan appears in the doorway
46
'  --  				46 The sun is still shining
It's late afternoon, as Elaine Miller exits her car and arrives home
She sees a few extra cars in the driveway, is immediately suspicious
47
--  				47 Elaine arrives to find William, Mrs
Deegan and Darryl awaiting her in the living room
It's a 1973-style intervention
They wear sunny, compassionate smiles
Whatever it is, the answer is no
Elaine, we need to talk to you
Nothing is wrong
am a teacher
You're a teacher
We speak the same language
Mom sits down
She is fully engaged and worried, her natural state
(cont'd) Now 'm not a jump-up-and-down person, but something wondrous has happened to William
And you have every reason to be happy
(knows her) and calm
Carefully gauging Elaine's face, the teacher continues
(cont'd) William has been gifted with a shining opportunity in the world of journalism
Through a love of music, and at an oddly-young age, he has received a major assignment from a national publication called Rolling Stone Magazine
Mrs
Deegan produces a copy, and places it on Elaine's lap
It sits there like the plague
(cont'd) Now you are rather famously not a fan of rock music, but such are the ironies of life, that happens to be the very topic of William's assignment - (cheerfully) - rock music
band
(warily, to Darryl) Honey, what are you doing here
Moral support
Mom looks evenly at her son, seated opposite her in this small living room
What's involved
Well
It's a great opportunity
He'll be well-paid, and published nationally -- (quickly) -- and he'll go on tour with a rock band for four days
No small planes
he travels on a bus
Is it time for me to say something
Sure
No
And in anticipation of that response - No
-- William has prepared -- (rueful) "Lo, that which  have feared has come upon me
" (lightening fast) "He who jealously guards his fears, quietly yearns to bring them about
" Mrs
Deegan admires their high-strung intellectual parrying, makes an impressed noise
(with compassion) No
have raised him to be an honor student, which he is
We have agreed on all our goals
We raised him to be a lawyer, we moved here to be near the finest law school in the West
Plus, he has finals coming up, and in one week he graduates with all his friends He's got no friends
Darryl
Please
Nearby, having anticipated all of the above, William nods to Mrs
Deegan, and stands
Elaine, may  present to you
your own son
William takes a lawyerly stroll, turns to face his mom
Lady of the Jury
(beat) wish to disprove the prevailing false belief that rock music is based on drugs and sex
True, perhaps at one time
but rock music is different now
It is now performed by hard-working intellectuals, with
with blazing intellectual pursuits, and  am going to play for you a piece of music designed to show you that my thesis is correct
This is going to be hell
Across the room, Darryl takes his position near the stereo
The song is based on the literature of Tolkien
and it's mystical attempt to elevate humanity has been successful throughout the world
this song will change your life
Mom stifles a cough
William nods to Darryl, who reverentially drops the needle with a thud
Mom is trapped, as we listen to silent static
and then
the opening notes of Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven
"  William gives his Mother the album cover's inner-sleeve with lyrics
(cont'd) We ask you only to listen
Camera passes across their serious and expectant faces
The intro in not short
We listen, just watching their faces, as Elaine becomes increasingly impatient
When is it going to start -   Soon
Immediately, overlapping, the vocal begins
("There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
") : 48         					48 Sprinklers click across the lawns
("
and it makes me wonder
") 49
-- 					49 Mom adjust herself in the chair, listens politely, checks her watch
She looks at William
50
- 						50 Sprinklers continue
("If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
") 51
-- 					51 Mom listens fitfully
The song continues
: 52
--   				52 Sprinklers shut off
Music is now blasting
("To be a rock, and not to roll
") 53
-  				53 Mom's face remains stoic to the bitter end
("
and she's buying the Stairway to Heaven
" )  The song ends
Silence
All look to Elaine
They wait on her response
We hear the turntable arm return to its cradle
What am  supposed to say
You say it's Tolkien, fine
They sound like nice kids
Is it meant to elevate humanity
"Sure, let's elevate humanity
After we sell you drugs and sex
"  All  have is my honesty
That's what  believe, and that's what  know
(flipping through magazine) Oh
Here's a nice ad
She holds up the magazine
And ad reads, in large bold type: (cont'd) You've clearly ganged up on me, and still say no
No no no no no no no
She shuts her eyes, and blurts out something against her better judgement
(cont'd) ' -
William nods gratefully, and exits frame
Hold on the empty chair, as drums herald the beginning of the Allman Brothers Band's "Trouble No More" from Live at Fillmore East
who feels a very particular kind of loneliness
It's the loneliness she got married, and then raised a family, to escape
54
-- 					54 An empty Heineken beer bottle rolls up and down the aisle, taking us to William
William picks up the bottle and places it in the seat back pocket in front of him
He has joined the circus, and the feeling of being here is a lot more lonely and forbidding than he expected
The bus struggles to make it up the hill, back rows shuddering loudly, as music continues
'mon, Doris
Darling Bus
You can make it
55
-- 					55 The Stillwater Tour Bus rumbles down the desert highway
The destination banner reads -   --  73
Music continues
56
- 							 56 William strains for a look at Russell five rows up
He plays slide guitar, working out a part
Next to Russell is Penny Lane
Penny raises an early-model Polaroid camera and - flash - takes a picture of a nearby sleeping Jeff Bebe
Gotcha
Jeff grumbles from the depths of a hangover
Penny stuffs the shot in her pocket
William watches, his private heart pounds
Polexia appears and sits next to him, noticing his shyness
Do you have any pot
No
'm a journalist
Well, go do your job then
You're on the road, man
It's all happening
Get in there
Go talk to 'em
Challenged, William rises and approaches Russell
He fixes the charismatic guitarist in his sights
Shot takes him down the aisle to the jamming star guitarist
He crouches in the aisle and talks to Russell who immediately seems moody
His mood is in the air
(very professional) Russell
Do you think we might be able to find some time to talk when we get to Phoenix
want to interview everyone separately
and  felt we'd start with you and me
Nearby, Jeff now listens in, feeling immediately jealous
Absolutely
Russell turns away
The kid squats uncomfortably in the aisle, babbling on
Because 've got a thing in a couple days
What
(self-conscious) It's a
thing where
uhm
you go there to graduate
School
(sharply) never graduated
And look what happened
You're here interviewing me
Good point
Laughs from everybody listening nearby
It's a good line
William makes a quick jot in his notebook
(cont'd) No no no
Don't put that in Rolling Stone
My bio says  graduated
We'll come up with something better later
Just enjoy the ride
Russell eyes the notebook suspiciously before turning away
Penny notices William's discomfort, laughing warmly, all while grabbing a Coke and giving one to nearby bassist Larry
How did you know  was thirsty
He didn't even realize he was thirsty, but he is
He nods thanks to Penny, the perfect road companion for all
And then Penny gives the other Coke, her Coke, to William
He accepts it too, and starts back to his seat
He's been blown off, and he knows it, but before he exits Penny grabs his arm and whispers in his ear: may need to stay in your room tonight
Russell's in a bad mood
He's very Bob Dylan in Don't Look Back today
He's trying to write
William nods cooly -- they are comrades -- and returns to his seat
large joint passes in front of him, across him, to Polexia, as everyone cheers Doris the Bus rumbling up another hill
(inhaling deeply) Want some
No thanks
wall of pot smoke is exhaled, right into his face
It surrounds him like a cloud
The bus shudders, as Russell continues playing slide up ahead
57
'   - 				57 Elaine sits in her living room, filled with her books
Large Department store photos of her children on the wall
She feels her own loneliness, and his too, as she dials a phone number
Has William Miller arrived yet
He hasn't
Could you give him a message as soon as you see him
- 58
-- 							58 Several hours later on this ride
Outside, night and desert
Inside, a few cigarettes, a joint of two glow in the darkness of the bus
The end of the Led Zeppelin classic "Whole Lotta Love" plays from the bus stereo, full blast
Everybody is free and anonymous in the dark
They sing at full-volume
William looks out the window in wonder
/ "Way down inside
(woman) woman
you need
" The ten-ton guitar chord of Jimmy Page
/ (cont'd) "Loooooooooooooooooooooooovvve
" John Bonham's drums thunder through the bus, everybody still singing as they dip down into the city ahead, Phoenix
William watches the living documentary around him
He writes furiously in the green notebook, scribbling in the dark, trying to steady his writing on the bumpy bus
Behind him, someone is beating along to the song on his seat
He never want to leave this world
59
-- 				59 All enter the lobby like warriors, in a pack
The hotel chairs are spotted with curious hangers-on, decked out and lounging
Dick is already stationed, as always, at the front desk
The sad state of hotel service grates on a road dog like Dick
He is forever teaching others their jobs
Jeff, Tony
Keys
keys
keys
room list
(re: luggage, to hotel bellman) If it doesn't have a number on it, it ain't ours
He gives key and a stack of messages to Russell, and turns to William who he makes feel more important
Penny is nearby with her suitcase and tackle box purse
William watches Russell's guitars whisked away - they are luggage-numbered 1, 3, and 4
(cont'd) The Enemy
Here you go, here's the key to your palatial suite, room list, plus let me give you a luggage tag
You're Number 42
Is this Mr
Miller
You have a message from Elaine
Thanks
(confidentially) She's a handful
know
William cooly takes the folded message, doesn't look at it, and tries to pretend this embarrassing moment didn't happen
Jeff exchanges a look with Russell
Nearby, the walking commotion arrives, clacking through the lobby
It's Sapphire
Last night's clothes are now today's
She holds a travel case, and hanger with some odd blouses
Finally, you're here
They kicked me out of my room
Fuck Ozzy
She hugs Penny Lane
Estrella appears, happy to have help with Sapphire
who approaches William
Come by in a few minutes
We'll do the interview
The kid exits and goes to join Penny, who is still comforting Sapphire
Russell looks through his messages
The guitar, now in a case, never leaves his hand
Jeff Bebe approaches, regarding William standing with Penny and the girls
Intrigue is swirling in the lobby
'm worried, man
Naw, we can trust him
He's a fan
But it's Rolling Stone
He looks harmless, but he does represent the magazine that trashed Eric Clapton, broke up Cream, ripped Led Zeppelin, and wrote that lame story about the Allman Brothers Band that bummed Duane out before he died
Don't forget the Rules
This little shit is the Enemy
He writes what he sees
(beat) But it would be cool to be on the cover
Leave it to me
We'll get a good story
Plus our girlfriends read this magazine and - (looking at Band-aids) -- you know
You made your point
'll take to him
Penny speaks confidentially to him
If she is slightly bossy, it is only because she's good at logistics, emotional and otherwise
Can Sapphire stay in your room tonight
She had a big fight with Ozzy, and Polexia's not working out with Jeff Bebe
(to Sapphire and Polexia) You just have to remember
these guys are jealous, insecure, talented, egocentric, and manipulative geniuses
they're lead-singers
They can say " love you" to 20,000 people
but any fewer is a real problem
(girls nod, comforted, she continues to the kid) Jeff Bebe has so much jealousy over Russell that he can't express
Plus, he never slept last night
You keep Sapphire and 'll stay with Russell
William covers his disappointment over losing Penny as a roommate
Cooly: Sure
'll take her
Me too
Sure
Estrella arrives with travel bag, equally homeless, looking hopeful
(cont'd) If there's room - Penny squeezes him
He feels cool
but the girl he really wanted to stay in his room now joins Russell, disappearing into the elevator
He looks down at the message in his hand, and opens it
It reads: '
He snaps it closed quickly, before anyone can see
59A
's  -- 						59A Russell plays acoustic guitar, a notebook cradled on his lap
Trying to write
It's coming slowly
Shot moves off him, past a flickering television, onto Penny who silently and intently watches Russell as if he's a rare and beautiful bird
He looks over at her - she turns away quickly
He goes back to work
Tries to catch her watching him again
She turns away just in time

radio
William on the bed, a thick local phone book on his lap
His hotel room
He watches self-consciously as the girls go about the ritual of inhabiting a room on the road
Sapphire flutters a paisley scarf over the room lamp
Polexia puts a towel along the crack of the door, blows out the glowing embers on too- many sticks of incense, and moves to the phone
Estrella has joined them as well, complete with a bag full of shoes
Instantly, we have atmosphere and not much room left in this, the smallest room in the hotel
William thumbs through the phone book with fascination
All these people
(wondrous, off phone book) And they all live in Phoenix
(on phone) Hi Dad
can't talk long
'm here in Paris
'm staying in another Youth Hostel with no phone and no address for mail
(still wondrous, from phone book) Alex
Lowbatz
(emerging from bathroom) was the one who told him what to tattoo on his fingers,  was the one who made his shirts
was there when his wife left him
Charles
Swoop
(on phone) 578
She's reading from a European tour book
Paul and Debbie Finger
(looking out window) Oh my God
Simon Kirke of Bad Company is by the pool
The girls mobilize by the window
William is increasingly aware that he is an outsider in his own tiny room
He tries to organize his stuff in the corner
'
Is anybody here as worried about Penny and Russell as  am
(the perfect daughter) She winks at William, who looks away
(to Polexia and William) Ooo, watch out - whoever you look at when you say that - that's who you really mean
Polexia hands up and throws a pillow at Sapphire,  the kid watches these girls like a tennis match
60A
'  -  				60A Russell puts down his guitar
You know
We should talk about what we don't talk about
We don't have to
No,  -  went to Catholic school believe in guilt and
you know, if there's any to be had,  pretty much want to roll around in it
don't believe in attachments
No boundaries
Just the music
'm just saying, it's okay to talk about it
Penny stands and turns
She speaks the word
Leslie
Russell nods
The name is out in the open
(cont'd) Leslie
Leslie
Leslie
Leslie
Leslie
Leslie
Leslie
Leslie
(somehow satisfied) Alright - now we're talking
But she continues, saying the name in a multitude of different ways, in different accents, and with different degrees of indifference and passion and lust and play-acting and mock- drama
As he listens and studies this ethereal creature for meaning
Is she mocking him
In love with him
Taunting him
Seducing him
Leslie
Leslie
Leslie
Lesssssslie
Leslie
Leslie
Leslie
Leslie
Leslie

And finally she sits next to him

Have  helped you get that off your chest
They kiss

'   -  				60B The girls continue their settling-in process
Opie, can  order room service
The nickname "Opie" re-opens a nagging wound
Polexia hangs up, and begins to dial again
Okay
You guys
Wait
Put down the phone, Polexia
(she does, sadly) First, this is my room
Come on, you're a fan like us
You're on our side of the line
Second
'm not Opie
Alright
Opie is a little boy
'm here to do a job
am a professional
(flipping luggage tag) Ooooooo, sorry, Mr
42
Third
(has their attention now) this phone is a big, big deal
In a minute,  have to go interview Russell
Do not answer this phone if it rings
have family members with severe anxiety Problems
She will not understand
(wounded) But what if Ozzy calls Sapphire
And gave Jimmy Page this number
Or a guy who looked like Jimmy Page
William looks at their troubled faces, full of too much-longing and too much make-up
Okay
have a solution
Answer the phone
But if anyone without an English accent is on the phone
(winging it) Just hang up
Or say it's the wrong room
They nod
It's a good plan

We hear Penny's giggle
Then the door opens, and it's Penny looking ravishing
In the background, Russell sits shirtless at the table
He playfully pelts the kid with crumpled up wads of hotel stationery
Don't worry
Some to the radio interview
No, 'm fine
'll just interview Jeff Bebe some more
(as in "you're on of us") She shuts the door quickly
It hurts a little
He picks up the wadded pieces of paper, stuffs them in his pocket
He leaves the door and helps himself to some soap and pencils and matches from the nearby maid's cart
Then he returns to Russell's door
He can't help but listen to the muffled sounds of laughter, just for a moment, escalating
He flips the sign over:    -
62
- 					62 Humble Pie
"Thirty Days in the Hole
"  Russell and band enter the radio station, passing through the now-empty front office
As always, Russell sets the tone
He's feeling good
Stillwater takes over -- they feel mighty, like the Beetles, as they climb across chairs, rearrange wall hangings and gold records  and head down the small hallway to the control room interview
Rolling with the flow are William and Penny in her green coat
He tries to distance himself from her -- still a little stung by the earlier hallway rebuff -- but she will have none of it
She privately shares every great passing moment with him
He tries not to succumb to these charms
It's hard
Music segues to Stillwater's own "Fever Dog
" 63
- 					63 Stillwater's own record spins, and it sounds good to everyone in this room
Russell takes a seat near the open mike
Jeff Bebe is quick to take the other seat, arranging himself to be just as close to the microphone as Russell
William watches all as he sits at the dark back of this control booth
Stillwater sits with late-night progressive disc-jockey , 25
Quince takes a long hit from a joint and does not pass it
The entire Stillwater band is now collected in the studio and ready for the interview
William can't avoid looking at Penny Lane, who looks great tonight
She catches him, and he barely looks away in time
Polexia, newly reconciled with Jeff, notices
The very mellow disc-jockey eases up to the microphone, as the finale of "Fever Dog" is just ending
The guitar of Russell Hammond
"Fever Dog"
The band is Stillwater
(beat) Watch with your mind as they materialize
Band members gets closer to the microphone, preparing to speak
Quince lowers his head, shutting his eyes and getting into the music as the song plays out

Estrella answers
William's room
-- Ben Fong-Torres is calling from Rolling Stone
Can  please speak to him
This is Ben Fong-Torres at Rolling Stone
Estrella panics,  hangs up quickly, as if the phone has just caught fire

65

The same song is still ending
Look at the dogs, wearing the funny hats
Juggling just for you
Freaks and family
Penny shoots William a look
Do you believe this guy
(cont'd) It's Quince, with Stillwater
Here
Live
It's the Night Circus
The band scoots closer to the microphone, ready to talk
Quince continues, looking meaningfully at the band
They are waiting
eager for a chance to speak
(cont'd) Every minute a baby is born somewhere
Life
Death
Hermetically sealed bags of human emotion
Bags of love
bags of kindness
(suddenly, turns) How'd you get together
As Jeff eagerly speaks, Quince lowers his head and listens
feels
the words of his guests
Well
not to get into a "me" thing
this is Jeff talking
but  did start the band, some time, actually, ago
This is back when we were the Jeff Bebe band, and  placed an ad in a magazine called Peaches looking for a guitarist and Russell Hammond answered
Quince nods, head bowed, swaying slowly
(with deep understanding) Peaches
Jeff watches Quince's head lower
It's hard to know when to talk with Quince
The depth of his mellowness is tough to get in rhythm with
think he was a gift from God, actually
Nobody plays like Russell Hammond
(sorta moved) Well, shit
Thank you
He instantly realizes he's slipped, on the air
(cont'd) Ooops
Better hit the delay button
All eyes turn to Quince, whose head stays down, grooving to some inner beat
He says nothing
The band looks at each other
We become increasingly aware that Quince may now be asleep
Long silence
William shares an amazed look with Penny
Quince is definitely asleep
Russell leans forward and continues talking quietly, with hilarious sincerity
(cont'd) Okay - we're talking now, right
Why the fuck do you wait until and interview in Arizona to say something nice about me
Why don't you say it to my fucking face sometime
Because  tell you every time  think you nailed something
Everybody pays you compliments
It's not my fucking job to kiss your fucking ass all the time
Well then who's fucking job is it
Because my ass is dying for a kiss
And  know yours is too
It's my fucking job
You're all geniuses
And let me just add this thought - smegma
Penny covers her mouth as offers a look of absurdity to William
He offers one back, as laughs are stifled throughout the room
William shares a look
Quince is still deeply asleep, as the usually quiet tony leans forward to speak
Feces
He cracks himself up, silently
Quince snaps awake, fully in- stride
The dong is called "Love Thing
" Your mind is Starting to take effect
They're all here to see you swallow fire
You scream soundlessly
on the Night Circus
It's Quince, with Stillwater
"Love Thing" takes over, as Quince swivels in the chair
(cont'd) thought that went well
66

Right now

They just got back from the radio station
Is this Maryann with the pot
Silence
(cont'd) Hello
No this isn't Maryann with the pot
This is Elaine

Estrella physically recoils
(cringing) thought you were English
Could you please give him a message
Could you tell him to call home immediately
And could you also tell him - (at full power) know what's going on
Alright
Okay
But 'm just going to say this, and 'm going to stand by it
(can't help herself) You should be really proud of him
'Cause know guys
and 'll bet you do too
And he respects women, and he likes women, and let's just pause and appreciate a man like that
You created him out of thin air, and you raised him right, and we're all looking out for him
And that's more than 've ever said to my own parents, so there you go
(silence) This is the maid speaking, by the way
68
-- 						68 Russell and William sit in two large red-leatherette seats in the hotel lobby
William shuffles through many pages of questions written in small script
His tape recorder microphone sits balanced on the chair
(very professional) Now that you're starting to be successful, you had twenty-six years to write your first Album
and you'll have maybe four months for the second
Do you worry that the pressure of the business will get in the way of the original joy of making your music
Or Russell blinks
The all-consuming issues of his life are right in front of him
Whoa
(laughing) need three more beers and my guitar before  can answer that question
Let's take a walk
69
- 					69 Russell walks the outskirts of the pool area with William
William follows him through the sliding glass door to his room, facing the pool
Russell grabs his guitar
They stand for a moment, unheard by the others, and regard the living portrait twenty yards in front of them
The off-limits after-hours pool area has been overtaken by the Stillwater tour members
Jeff Bebe sits in a chair nearby
Dick laughs at a joke
Always the life of the party, Penny Lane dispenses stolen towels from a maid cart
And she is the first to slip into the pool for some after-hours, against-the-rules swimming
Effortlessly, she turns a collection of people into a party
They regard her, well out of earshot of the others
For a minute  thought you were actually a real journalist
which is
you know, it's great
(beat) Shut that thing off, and 'll tell you the truth
William shuts his tape recorder off
It's off
Look
trust you
'm going to lay this right on you
Just make us look cool
will quote you warmly and accurately
That's what 'm worried about
See - some of us have girlfriends back home
Some of us have wives
And
some of the people you meet on the road are really amazing people
They both watch Penny Lane, sparkling, fresh from the pool
She places hotel furniture into the shallow end and inviting all, even other curious hotel guests, to join them in the pool
(cont'd) Like you
And some of the things that happen are good for just a few people to know about - as opposed to, say, a million people
Dawn is breaking for William
Ohhhh
Oh
Yeah
You know what  mean
Right
Yeah
See, you're dangerous
Most people are just waiting to talk, but you listen
Right
Right
So your question you asked me
think about It every fucking night
The "business
"   hate it
(quietly) grew up with these guys, okay can't play all that  can play, 'm past these musicians, do you understand
do
The more popular we get, the more can't walk on them, the bigger their houses get, the more pressure
you forget, man
You forget what it was like to be real, to be a fan
You can hear it in a lot of bands who've been successful - it doesn't sound like music anymore
It sounds like
like lifestyle maintenance
(suddenly confessional) used to be able to hear the sounds of the world
Everything, to me, used to sound like music
Everything
Now don't hear it
You know what 'm trying to say
(ruefully) Yeah
Man, it feels good to say this stuff out loud
But what am  doing
'm telling secrets to the one guy you don't tell secrets to
(feeling included) No, that's okay
We'll do the interview tomorrow
This is good
So there's the "friend" and then there's the "interview guy
" Yeah
So tonight it's "friend"
and when we wake up tomorrow - " interview guy
We'll figure it out as we go, buddy
Hey - for whatever it's worth - you guys are really good
Russell laughs at the kid's easy naivete
He hands his guitar to the kid, and joins the party
William watches, part of the crowd
somehow feeling a little compromised
He doesn't care

On stage, Ed soundchecks his drums
How would you describe your role in Stillwater
What is the chemical that you add to the chemistry
'm the bass-player
(pressing for some poetry) Right
And when you take that away
what would be missing
Stylistically
What chemical
(not getting it) The bass
Larry doesn't give him much
71
- 						 71 It's raining
The pre-show huddle breaks up, William a part of them
Penny Lane adjusts Larry's look
She takes the scarf from around his neck and ties it around his leg
He looks instantly better
William watches in the darkness as Dick takes the microphone
The best part of his day has arrived
In his important voice: Good evening Phoenix
(applause) From Troy, Michigan
Please welcome, Stillwater
Lights come up, as the band launches into "Fever Dog
"   Jeff begins singing
Russell reaches to adjust the microphone for a back-up vocal and is hit with something unexpected
sharp electrical shock
It's just a slight pop in the loud din of music, but within a moment something is clearly wrong
Russell holds onto the microphone stand with a surprised look, conducting high-voltage for two seconds and then he snaps his hand off the metal
His face is white, he takes off his guitar and walks off-stage, collapsing a couple steps later
72
-- 						72 Dick is waving wildly for the band to board the bus, which has been pulled up into the backstage area
He guides a sagging Russell, assisted by Penny Lane, into the bus
Get in, get in
William boards the bus, as the extremely agitated arrives to confront Dick
Are you the manager of this band
That, and more
Get in
You didn't even play a full set
Dick whirls and unleashes an anger we've not yet seen, gesturing with the silver briefcase that does not leave his hand
Your shoddy stage set-up almost killed our guitarist
You trashed the dressing room - you didn't play your thirty-five minutes
You didn't fulfill your contract - Everybody in
Get in the bus
'll report you to every promoter in the country
'm gonna talk to Frank Barcelona
'    '
hope you have a good lawyer
He swings into the bus, as the bus revs
'
73
-- 							73 Russell sits, pale, next to Penny at the front of the bus
He examines his singed hand, shaking it a little to emphasize the positivity of her words
Don't worry
It's happened to all the greats
Thank God you didn't hold the mike stand with both hands, you'd still be holding it
This is a good thing
It's a good, good, good thing
William sits nearby, watching Russell, making notes out of eye- sight of others
The ever-wary Jeff, unseen by William, cranes to see that he's writing in his notebook
Dick swings into the seat across from Russell
The bus door shuts, as the promoter is still yelling
Doris is slow to gain speed, as Estrella appears, running alongside
She knocks on the window next to William
forgot to tell you
Your mom says to call home immediately
She says she knows what's going on
(receding) See you guys in Topeka
'll catch a ride with Sabbath
William nods with embarrassment, waves to her, as the bus races toward the now closing gate
(casually, to Russell) Wanna buy a gate
Before Russell can answer -
Doris barrels through the steel-gate, snapping it like a chopstick to great cheers inside this bus
(cont'd) You just bought a gate
(to the bus) 'mon Doris
Get us out of town
The bus struggles up a slight incline, everybody rooting for Doris, as she eases out of the parking lot and onto a thoroughfare
What did it feel like to be electrocuted
It burns
It feels like a dose of lead shooting through your body
and then you see God, and he says, "How bad do you want to be legendary
" And god damnit
let go
(shaky grin as all laugh warmly) Rock and roll
Jeff watches this charisma with thinly veiled envy
The kid scribbles in his notebook
We hear Led Zeppelin's "That's the Way
" 74
-  						74 Song continues
Almost everybody is asleep
William takes the camera and snaps a Polaroid of a sleeping Penny
She wakes up
Give that to me
She grabs for it, they have a brief play-fight
He grabs some other Polaroids from her pocket
He hustles to the back of the bus, pockets the photo, and settles down to watch the passing landscapes
She chases him down the aisle
Music continues as she sits down next to him
Out the window, a long-distance running team of Girls keeps pace with the bus for a bit
They wave
Penny watches them over sunglasses, waves briefly to the real world
(cont'd) (breathing heavy, owning the world) When we go to Morocco,  think we should wear completely different clothes, and be completely different people
What will our names be
She snaps a Polaroid of a nearby sleeping Silent Ed, pockets the Polaroid
She regards Russell up ahead, also sleeping
Her attention has already wandered from Morocco
What do you think of Russell
like him
You're coming to Cleveland, right
Cleveland, Ohio
Oh no no no
gotta get my interview with Russell before Greenville
And you've got to help me
Okay
Friends
remember
Penny is still watching Russell
You should give him a break
There are real problems in the band
Off the record
Gravely noting the word "problems", the kid joins Penny in watching Russell, who is splayed haphazardly, sleeping restlessly up ahead
What problems
Okay
got it
think your name should be Spencer, and mine will be Jane
can't keep up with you
No one can
What's your real name
She looks at him briefly
She puts her arm around him
It's intoxicating, but he doesn't quite know how to act
With her free hand, she gestures with a hanger
As they regard Russell sleeping nearby: Here's the thing about Russell
He's my last project
only do this for a very few people
And  think we should do it together - he is almost great
We've got to take him there
You and me - we can do it
Deal
Because the other guys are good - but he could be great
He's my last project
He looks at her
She imitates his face back to him
(cont'd) It's all happening
75
-- 				75 William sits interviewing Silent Ed by some equipment cases
What do you love about music
Ed looks at him thoughtfully
It is an eloquent moment
He thinks
He shrugs
The kid tumbles with more questions
These interviews are not going well
76
- 						76 William, looking concerned over the state of his interviews, walks into the backstage bathroom
He makes a few surreptitious notes in his notebook before noticing that Jeff is standing there, clearly just finishing a quick hit of cocaine offered by a Local Hanger-On
Seeing the kid, he immediately hides the coke spoon
Hey
Hey
William pretends he sees nothing as he turns to the urinal, and shot stays on Jeff, who looks a little high and a little worried
77
- 					77 William is on the pay phone with his Mother
The show booms in the background
know
know
know
(beat) know
Mom
Mom
Mom
78
- 						78 Stillwater on-stage
great show
Russell on fire
79
- 					79 William on the phone
Estrella leans on him, fixing her shoe
Right now -- Topeka
Then Greenville
Then home
He winces slightly, holds the phone away from his ear for a moment
(cont'd) 'm sorry  didn't call yesterday
It's not like you can just carry a phone around with you
80
'   -- 				80 Mom sits in her school office, a miniature version of her home - a fortress in which she is surrounded by books
The sun is going down
She can't resist a sentimental moment
guess  just miss you, and  don't understand why 've driven both my kids so far away from me
By all practical rules don't  get you for three more years
He is touched by her vulnerability, more visible now than ever, as music continues in b
g
(cont'd) Was  not fun
81
-- 					81 William has his finger in his ear
The din if Stillwater's set now blots out all other noise
It is not the time to answer this question
missed the last thing you said
Mom takes a pause
Penny now enters, watching
(angry, louder) William now notices Penny standing nearby, picking at a salad from a paper dish
Looking at her, he lets loose with what he believes is a private confession
Penny smiles knowingly, collecting his affection like another backstage pass, and turns away
Camera stays on William
He is suddenly and deeply embarrassed
He's just told her that he loves her and she knows it
He hangs up, traumatized
82
-- 				82 Russell's hair is slicked with sweat from a show just finished
He is shirtless with a towel around his shoulders
Luggage for the next city is stacked by the door
Fire away
'm ready
'm on the "You" Train
Take me there
The kid plugs in his microphone
Russell listens as he springs his first question
Do you have to be depressed to write a sad song
Do you have to be in love to write a love song
Is a song better if it really happened to you
Like, "If You Say Nothing"
where did you write that and how did it come about
Russell admires the many questions
Says nothing
He looks at his hand, thinks
When did you get so professional
In the background, Penny Lane irons Silent Ed's shirt
Grinning, she cuffs his shoulder
To the shirtless silent drummer, waiting for his shirt
'm almost done with my shirt
Ed watches her appreciatively, drumming silently on a rubber pad
Penny kisses Russell, who swings her onto his lap
In the corner, Jeff watches them all with a vague feeling of being underappreciated
And now Dick enters with a large cardboard box
Russell, your dad showed up again
And on a lighter note
(importantly) Gentlemen
Your first t-shirts have arrived
There is an immediate buzz in the room, as Dick yanks open the box filled with new white t-shirts
He untangles the first fresh shirt, and displays it proudly
silent beat as all examine it - their first t-shirt
Faces fall
Ed stops drumming
There has been a mistake
It is a fuzzy band photo with the group name emblazoned below
Only Russell, who stand out front, is colored- in and emphasized on the shirt
He turns away, making a noise
Jeff stares at the t-shirt
He's just about in tears
There is a long silence and then
Ed resumes drumming on the rubber pad
(cont'd) It's the record company's mistake
And they will pay
Shirts gone, band happy
He drops the offending shirt into the trash, as if it were contaminated, and exits with the box
William watches as the two men, Russell and Jeff, move to opposite sides of the room
Russell puts on a shirt, so does Jeff
The vibe is thick
Russel turns to see Jeff staring at him
Can we just skip the vibe and go straight to us laughing about this
(bitterly) Yeah
Okay
(trying for a joke) Because  can see by your face - you want to get into this - How can you tell
'm just one of the out-of-focus guys
Here we go
William watches as Russell fishes the t-shirt out of the trash
(cont'd) Here
Take it
You  this shirt - it lets you say everything you want to say
Well, it speaks pretty loudly to me
It's a t-shirt
Russell turns away
'm always gonna tell you the truth
Are you doing coke again
Oh yeah
All the time
The kid looks down
(cont'd) This is big stuff, man
From the very beginning -- we said -- 'm the front man and you're the guitarist with mystique
That's the dynamic we agreed on -- Page, Plant
Mick, Keith
But somehow it's all turning around
We have got to control what's happening to us
There's a responsibility here - Excuse me, but didn't we all get into this to avoid responsibility
Forgive me
(continuing, on shirt) But this is the slow-moving train of compromise that will kill us
Russell makes a disgusted noise
Penny Lane exits discreetly, looking back at William
(cont'd) can't say anymore with a writer here
You can trust him,  you can say whatever you want
(eyes suddenly moist) works as hard or harder than anybody on that stage
You know what  do - connect
get people off
look for the guy who isn't getting off, and make him get off
(beat) Actually, that you can print
(continues to Russell) And yet, why do  always end up feeling like 'm a joke to you
feel nothing but love for you
We're a family
He looks at the t-shirt and starts to cry
Embarrassed, he grows angrier
(cont'd) You want to pretend this isn't going to be a very big band
Well it is
You call yourself a leader of this band, but your direction allowed the t-shirt, when you allowed Dick to manage us, 'cause he's your friend
don't you see
The t-shirt is everything
It's everything
Is it my turn
Because  think we should, for once, say what we really mean
Oh, this is the part where you quit - (stiffening) Right
'm so predictable
No   gotta tell the truth --  want you to like me
But sometimes  feel like you collect people who love you and then very skillfully
you make them feel bad that they're not good enough for you
Stick to singing, brother, 'cause you ain't gonna make it as a shrink
Deal with it
And let me just say what nobody Else wants to say to you - What
Your looks have become a problem
82A
- 						 82A Russell walks swiftly past a happy silver-haired man, who holds court with beer in hand
He dresses too young for his age, late fifties
He is
Son
(dutifully) Hello Harry
Dad introduces a woman much younger, who eyes Russell hungrily
He got all the good genes, huh
Meet Deirdre
We're getting married in July
83
-- 						83 Russell walks fast outside the arena
William hustles to catch up
The two men walk in long silent strides in the cold night air, beyond the backstage area
Fans begin to recognize and follow at a discreet distance
You okay
You alright
Russell doesn't answer
(resolute, wound up) From here on out, 'm only interested in what's real
The kid nods
They walk
(cont'd) Real feelings
Real people
That's all 'm interested in
From here on out
What is
You're real
Thanks
wave of warmth comes over Russell
You know, you know all about us and don't know shit about you
(struggling to be personal) What's your
your family like
Tell me
Well, my dad died of a heart attack and my sister believes that my Mom is so intense that she might have contributed to it
Plus - (immediately) Okay, that's good
That's enough
It's good to talk about it
Really good
Russel now sees some hero worship in the kid's face, and it makes him nervous
(cont'd) Hey, man, maybe we should go back
If they want me, they can find me
William turns and sees nobody following but fans
So listen
have to go home tomorrow
know this is a bad time to finish our interview
Hey, man, you know what
Write whatever you want
trust you
big square Chevy van slows down
- hands his head out the window
- (battle-cry) Woooooooooo
You're Russel from Stillwater
On my better days, yes
am "Woooooo, Russell from Stillwater
" - Wanna go to a party at my friend Aaron's house
know you're a big rock star, but do you want to hang with some people looking to have a good time
Russel regards the van full of kids
More fans crowding around
The kid behind the wheel unknowingly says the magic words
- (cont'd) We're just real Topeka people, man
He has said the magic word
A84
'  - 					A84 Russell arrives at the party in the rural outskirts of Topeka
William nearby
84
'  -- 					84 William watches as Russell slugs from a Jack Daniels bottle
They sit in the bedroom of a mindblown fan, 17 year-old
He has long frizzy brown hair, tied in a spray behind him
Many from the neighborhood are now pouring into the home
(eyes glowing) You
Aaron
Are what it's all about
You are real
Your room is real
Your friends are real
You are more important than
than
all the silly machinery
And you know it
In eleven years it's gonna be 1984, man
Think about that
Wanna see me feed a mouse to my snake
Yes
# 1 Can  have your belt
Take it
Russel whips off his belt, gives it to the fan
joint goes by, headed for Russell
William intercepts it and passes it on
(cont'd) Aaron
Where's your bathroom
want to live here
want to eat your food, and live in your city and fuckin rock like  used to
want to learn everything there is to know about your city and your town
And your way of being real
(stunning realization) used to be you
Down the hall by the washing machine
What
The bathroom
Okay
Good to know
Russell rises and squeezes past fans and heads down the hall
85
'  - 					85 William follows Russell protectively
# 1 , 14, turns and watches Russell pass
We linger on her face for just a moment, full of wonder
We should probably head back sometime
Russell ignores him
# 2 (holding red cup) Watch out, there's acid in the beer that's in the Red cups
Russell looks at the cup in his own hand
It's white
Then, with his other hand, he grabs the red cup and drains it
William winces
They move on
Topeka
Check it out
Russell enters the bathroom
William stands guard
With a finger outstretched from each hand, he lectures the fans massing in the hallway
Please don't give him any more acid
86
--  --   			86 William watches as a wobbly Russell Hammond, in sunglasses now, goes through Aaron's record collection
He places the albums over his face, like masks
Faces
Stones
Sa-weet Baby James
None of these people are gonna be around in twenty years
Plastic begets plastic
Black plastic
Partygoers are strangely fascinated by the rock star in their living room
: 87
-- 					87 William waits anxiously to use the phone, keeping an eye on Russell
Russell is now strangely twisting/dancing with four girls in the living room, as more cars arrive outside
He's here right now
Go ahead and put it Out over the radio, tell people to bring food And beer and chicks
We're at Rural Route # 4 - No no
Nope
No
William takes the phone and hangs up
Keeping an eye on Russell in the next room, he dials from a tour itinerary sheet
(cont'd) Dick Roswell, please
(beat) Dick
got him
He's okay
've been Looking after him
He's on acid, though
can't Really tell
How do you know when it's "kicked in
" 88
'  - 					88 Russel stands on the jutting corner of the house rooftop
The unlit, unheated greenish family pool beckons to him below
It's kicked in
(bellowing to the heavens) Russell cackles at the joke of it all
William yells up from down below
Hey Russell - Don't jump, okay
And you can tell Rolling Stone Magazine my last words were - He spreads his arms, and tries to think of last words
(cont'd) -- 'm on drugs
The kids cheer
William looks around, remains cool
Yells upward in the cold night air
think we should work on those last words
Critic
No, 'm not - Okay  got it
got it
got it
got it
This is better
Last words (spreads his arms, his greatest realization) It gets a skimpy reaction from the partygoers
(cont'd) (immediately) 'm on drugs
They applaud again
Just come on down
(matter-of-fact) Okay
He jumps from the roof into the cold, algaed water below
He sinks immediately
One kid jumps in, then another, then more
Everybody wants to save Russell
89
'  --  			89 It's getting lighter
Cars line the street
And now, finally turning the corner, is Doris the Bus
90
-- 						90 William watches the effects of personal charisma
Wet partygoers surround Russell, bottle of Jack Daniels still in hand,  wrapped in towels
Now a bond has passes between them, all of them
Algae drips from the corner of Russell's face and neck
Thanks for saving my life
won't hold it against you
Twenty different kids thank him for the opportunity
("Glad to do it," "Right on," "Damn straight
") 91
/ -- 				91 Door opens
Dick enters
Finding the guitarist in the kitchen, he clicks into time-tested road-managerial maintenance
Easing Russell out of his towel, slipping his own jacket around him, from Russell's hands
(privately) They've been crying for you like a bunch of whimpering pussies -- (woozy) The band is over
This is my family now
Right on
He's staying with us
(soothing) Definitely
It's all over
We'll just ride on to Greenville, listen to some great music, finish the tour, and leave those ungrateful fools behind
And then we'll come back here, where you'll live
know what you're doing
and like it
(noticing William) Look at him
He's taking notes with his eyes
(beat, to Dick) How do we know he's not a cop
William laughs painfully, as Russell moves in, eyes flaring with sudden paranoia
(cont'd) He could be selling information
(to Russell) Easy
He's your Guardian Angel
Russell turns away
William shrugs with style, but his lingering look is filled with hurt
Dick guides Russell to the door, grabbing the kid and talking very directly to him as they move
(cont'd) Don't worry
He only means half of what he says
Which half
Good question
(very direct) have a lot more
Just help me get my interview so  can go home from Greenville
have to go home
(pulls him back) have to go home
Hey
You saved the tour
That's good enough for now
Frustrated but feeling important, William hands him some of Russell's wet clothes
William deftly retrieves Russell's shoes and smoothly plucks the guitarist's sunglasses from the partygoer who also wears his belt
They move to the door in a pack
We hear the beginning of Elton John's "Tiny Dancer
" Dick faces the crowd and addresses them in his "important" stage voice
(cont'd) Ladies and Gentlemen, the evening is over
We hope you've enjoyed yourselves, and we'll See you again in 1974
Good evening
William gives Russell his sunglasses to face the sunlight
Russell stumbles out of the house to great cheers
The Quiet Girl breaks free to catch Russell on the way out
'll never forget you
Dick pats William's arm one more time -- good work
They leave Aaron's house as legends
92
--  - 5 					92 "Tiny Dancer" continues on the bus stereo
Russell sits up front, swathed in a large robe, alone and silent
The others have given him a wide berth
He feels silly, and they know it, and he hates that they know it, which makes him feel foolish
He sits silently
William watches him from four rows back, next to Penny
She kisses the top of his forehead, a hero's welcome
He yawns
The song's vocal begins
There is only more silence
Then, after a beat, we hear a voice or two, fighting the quiet and singing along
Then others
waking up
joining in
Then Jeff
Russell hears them and starts to sing along too, louder now, without turning around
It's a voice everyone wants to hear
Like it or not, this is his family
: 93

He is paler than ever, in a room clogged with vinyl, happily listening to the MC5 in the background
How's it going
: 95
'   - 					95 It's a small wooden-walled hotel room in Greenville
Polexia tries on clothes
William barely notices as he talks to Lester on the phone
Rolling Stone is calling me
don't have my key interview
don't know what to say
(pacing, assembling thoughts with his hands) You're flipping out
That's good
Alright
This is how you blow their minds
He'll ask you - this is Ben Fong-Torres, right
- he'll ask you how the story's going
Here's what you do - let's fry his mind
Tell him "it's a think piece about a mid-level band struggling with their own limitations in the harsh face of stardom
"  Ha ha
This is fun
William scrambles to make notes
(madly copying) think
piece
Longhand small script on yellow legal tablets
96
-- 					96 William sits in the tub, without water
It's his makeshift office, he's surrounded with scraps of notepaper
He writes savagely, and now, savagely throws it away
97
-- 					97 In the bedroom, Sapphire, Polexia and Penny watch The Midnight Special
Sapphire looks at a room service menu
It says the food is hearty and adventurous
(yawns) Greenville
'm bored
Penny yawns too, it's catchy, and rises to visit the bathroom
(cont'd) Hey let's deflower the kid
Now Sapphire yawns, looks in her purse
Who his the quaaludes from me
98
-- 					98 Penny enters to see William writing in the tub
She sits on the toilet to pee
Flustered: Wait
'll leave
He gets up, knocking his carefully organized notes onto the floor
He is brimming with things to say
More than he is even able to communicate
(cont'd) You know,  think this is going backwards for me
Backwards
(flustered) don't know
just thought we could hang out, maybe do some stuff back home, regular stuff, get to know each other better
and then 'd see you pee
mean, that's the way  usually do it
You're one of us
It's no big deal
'm not one of you
Oh
If you go to Cleveland, Bowie's going to be there at Swingo's, the greatest hotel in America
'll introduce you to him, and his security guy Dennis
William stops at the door
Don't you have any regular friends
Famous people are just more interesting
He looks at her
Even sitting on the can, she's elegant and totally focused on him
(carefully) Well,  would be worried that they were using me
And not that anybody's using you, but - She swoons a little, touched and moved
Boy, if this was the real world and some guy talked to me like that - Let me finish
(continuing) 'm not famous
but you could always use me
If anything happens
And would never use you
Even if  got famous
So you know, you always have that from me
in the real world
If you ever have to go back there, for anything
She looks at him curiously, as the door blasts open
Sapphire and Polexia head for William
Your time has come
Did he call
(realizes their intention) What are you -- stop it -- we're talking here
Pants him
Opie must die
They swarm him, dragging him kicking into the bedroom
99
-- 					99 Steely Dan, looking pale and somehow snappy, perform "Do It Again" on The Midnight Special
The girls force William onto the bed, and envelope him
Their sexuality is fun, untroubled
Shot moves past bodies crossing frame, onto William's face
Across room, sitting and watching
Just relax
Take a vacation from yourself
Leave this to professionals
Estrella and Polexia kiss each other playfully
William looks confused
Across the room, Penny laughs, turns up the , blows him a kiss
Penny's eyes
Across the room
His eyes
His sexual awakening may be downtime amusement for them, but to him it's an embarrassingly  intense moment he shares only with Penny Lane -- across the room
She turns away, smiling, disappears into the next room
On the television
: 99A
-  -    - 		99A Post-sex pajama party
Sapphire, Estrella, and Polexia girltalk about their first rock and roll conquests
Penny is conspicuous by her absence
William is under the sheets, listening, feeling different, now a man and somehow one of the girls too
: 100
--  					100 William is awake
Sunlight floods in from the corners of the window-shades
He is surrounded by the fallen cavalry of the night before
Sapphire and Polexia
The phone rings, and Sapphire instantly snaps it up, still asleep
Lost in her dreams, she offers the sexiest hello ever
(half-English accent) Hello
Hi, Ben-Fong-Torres from Rolling Stone
William snatches the phone
(lowers voice) Hello
101
-'  --  			101 Ben Fong-Torres is up bright and early
Hello William, this is your editor at -- He offers the name of the magazine with a swirl that implies high-level importance
(cont'd) Rolling Stone
How's the story
-- William snaps into his very professional tone of equally grave importance
'm getting good stuff out here
Sounds like it
Next to him, Polexia yawns herself awake
Man,  need some - He clamps a hand over her mouth
(jocular but tough) Now listen
Get it together
We're both professionals,  don't have to tell you this
You're not out there to join the party -- we already have one Hunter Thompson
You're out there to interview and Report
You got me
This isn't Creem Magazine, it's Rolling Stone
We need this story in four days
Now  want to know how it's shaping up
It's a think-piece about a mid-level band grappling with their limitations in the face of the harsh glare of success
(pause) like what we're saying
Let me try and get you a thousand more words
It's in consideration for the cover, but don't tell the band
(conflicted) Crazy
The kid hangs up, now shouldering even more pressure
He unclamps Polexia's mouth
- coffee
Me too
Greenville is so boring
(to William) Any other city in the world and you'd still be a virgin
'm going out to find Russell
Will you take the laundry
(to the girls) What am  to you
Tell me right now
What
Am
To
You
102
- 						102 Circles have sprouted up under William's eyes
The orange bag strapped over his shoulder, he lugs a huge bag of laundry
He consults room list
variety of noises and smells drift from the band rooms
He sees Room Service arrive at Dick's door, and it's Estrella who opens the door
(Dick in the background
)  She smiles sweetly to William -- good morning -- as the door shuts
Houdini
Houdini
He arrives at Russell's door
Two exclamation points have been Sharpie-markered to the words Do Not Disturb on the sign is gaffer-taped to his door
He looks through the crack, at the bottom of the door
Carefully and politely, he knocks
Instantly: (
) Pissed, the kid flips off the door
He sits down on a chair directly across from the room
Push in on William, who is more pent-up than ever
He tries hard not to cry, taking gulps of air as a maid cart swishes past, revealing
he's failed
He cries
super-energized Russell Hammond looks into William's sleepy face
William's eyes open
His own sleepy face is evident in Russell's sunglasses
The bag of laundry is still at his feet
(cont'd) We'll do the interview in Cleveland
No
can't
You've got to help me
have to go home
Come on man, we'll have more time there
Don't be tense
He begins rubbing the kid's shoulders
He's waking up
There's Penny, also rubbing his shoulders
It is degrading
and somehow cool too
(to Penny) You said you'd help me
(massaging) Come to Cleveland
(massaging, hypnotically) Come to Cleveland
Come to Cleveland
can't
Can we help it if we like having you around
William is a bundle of nerves and exhaustion now
Embarrassed and frustrated
(cont'd) Cleveland, my man
You can't miss out on the Rock Mecca of the midwest - you're with us
It's all happening
Rock and roll
(weary) Rock and roll
We hear David Bowie's live version of "Waiting for the Man
" 103
-- 						103 They sit together, hair askew, in sunglasses, resting against the headboard
Carefully, Russell identifies his thoughts
feel
like his parents
Penny runs a worried hand through her hair
know
wonder how that happened
You ever notice that all our sentences begin with "
" hadn't, no
'Cause we should work on that
He looks at her, plays the guitar a little
104
- 						104 Night
Doris rocks toward Cleveland on a muggy summer night
The windows of passing houses offer rich Edward Hopper glimpses of lives and people William will never meet
105
'   - 					105 William watches from his bus bunk at the back, head on elbow
Looking up, he sees the rhythmic motion of bodies on the mattress above him, as music continues
William gets up, nods hello to the Roadie and his Date on the bunk above
He moves down the aisle
to the seats near the front
sleeping Russell sits upright, hugging his guitar
Penny asleep next to him, Polaroid in her hand of
Russell sleeping
The kid moves on
He sits with the Bus Driver, whose  crackles with chatter from other tour buses headed to Cleveland
- Cleveland signs
Music rises
Heads pop awake
Cleveland
106
-  				106 Like a slow-moving shark, Doris pulls into empty downtown Cleveland
The streets are empty
They pass the Agoura Ballroom, where a man with a long stick arranges the letters Stillwater on the marquee
Applause in the bus
107
'   -  / 		107 Russell and band enter like warriors, in a pack
William sags with the heavy bags in hand and over his shoulder
Here, in the middle of the midwest, is an explosive rock mecca, just as promised
The feeling of belonging invades all those in this lobby
Fans and other touring rockers mingle together
Outside in the real world, everyone else is going to work
It's Bowie
The lobby ignites, as William stands near Penny and Russell
Bowie races from a limousine through the lobby and into the elevators
He is shrouded by a jacket
Just the top of his electric red hair travels the lobby, as he's hustled by security man Dennis in the elevator
And out of the chaos comes
108
- 						108 Jeff Bebe and Polexia smash against the wall of the Swingo's hotel room, making love
109
- 						109 Russell and Penny Lane smash against their own wall
109A
- 						109A Dick squats at the front of the stage, and talks to a few fans in the front row of this crowd
110
- 			110 wild Cleveland crowd in the building
The cities on this tour are getting bigger, and so are the audiences
And there is a whiff of business now too
Men in satin tour jackets and some Disc-jockey types cruise the backstage
Hysterical Fan is led screaming to the nearby medic room
Few even react - it's Cleveland - as the shot finds William, tired and yawning, on the backstage pay phone
He is absolutely ready for the worst
Hi Mom
'm in Cleveland
He listens stoically
Larry and Ed watch nearby
: -- Moms sits in silence
(cont'd) (rehearsed) 'm fine
'm fine
'm flying back on Monday Morning
'll only miss one test
'll make it up
Russell listens in, holding his guitar, laughing
Tell her you're a slave to the groove - you can't help it
(covers phone) No
Russell grabs the phone, talks to the silent mother on the other end
Hi Mom
It's Russell Hammond,  play guitar in Stillwater
It's my fault
How does it feel to be the mother of the future of rock journalism
(beat) Hello
Silence
Penny passes and stands near William, smoothing her pass
They watch a new pack of groupies prowl the road-crew
They are more glam, more trashy and less selective
They glare insolently at Penny Lane
This is the future
(cont'd) You've got a great kid -- nothing to worry about
We're taking care of him
And you should come to a show sometime
Join the Circus
Listen to me
Your charm does not work on me
'm onto you
Of course you like him
Yes
He worships you people and that's fine with you, as long as he helps make you rich
(a nerve is struck) Rich
don't think so - Listen to me
He's a smart, good- hearted, 15 year-old kid, with infinite potential
Russel looks over at the kid, eyes narrowing as he processes the truth
He's 15
(cont'd) This is not some apron-wearing mother you're talking to
know about your Valhalla of Decadence, and  shouldn't have let him go
He is not ready for your world of compromised values, and diminished brain cells that you throw away like confetti
Am  speaking clearly to you
Yes, ma'am
If you break his spirit, harm him in any way, keep him from his chosen profession -- which is law, Something you may not value but do -- you will meet the voice on the other end of this telephone
And it will not be pretty
Do we understand each other
Yes
yes
(always the teacher) didn't ask for this role, but 'll play it
Now go do your best
"Be bold and mighty forces will come to your aide
"  Goethe said that
It's not too late for you to be a person of substance
Get my son home safely, 'm glad we spoke
She hangs up
Russell hangs up, oddly affected and shook up
Some people get her
Some don't
Russell is still recovering
William feels embarrassed by his mother, once again
111     							111 William with the band
He yawns, as the band breaks
Cleveland awaits
We follow Dick, who guides the band onto the stage platform, still in darkness
Already, stomping and applause is mounting
Russell turns to William before taking the stage: Your Mom kind of freaked me out
She means well
Still rattled, he takes the stage
We see the unbridled enthusiasm of the faces on the front row
wave of cigarette lighters stretch out before them
(importantly) From Troy, Michigan
Russell thwacks a couple chords
Audience thunders
He turns to other members, feeling chills
It's in these moments that everything else disappears
They bow and wave, still in darkness
each member seems to have his own fans
Dick lets all this play out before finally adding
(cont'd) Would you please welcome to Cleveland
More applause
This is very very very very fun
(cont'd) Stillwater
Lights come up
full blast of audience love hits them right in the face, as they begin "Fever Dog
"  The band charges headlong into their set, as various fans are squeezed up out of the crowd and onto the stage
Who is in the middle of playing, as he smoothly whips off his guitar, and uses the instrument to send a Frenetic fan back into the crowd
He slips back under the strap, laughing
More stage climbers spring up where that fan came from, and Russell now watches as Jeff Bebe dodges a fan and comes over to Russell to lean on him
Russell turns to share the moment with Penny, dancing with arms in the air at the side of the stage
112
-- 					112 William in the dressing room, eyes red with exhaustion, finally interviewing Russell
He holds the mike stoically
So when you play a great show like tonight
Dick enters with great urgency
Okay
need everybody's attention
The kid shuts his eyes
He knew this would happen
(cont'd) Alright, well, the rumors are true
The record company has sent a big-time manager here to try and talk you into replacing me
His name is Dennis Hope
know you've all heard of him
He's got all the big bands
He's right outside
He wants five minutes with you right now
think we gotta do it
(pissed) Then bring him in
William shuts off his tape recorder
(arrogant) Bring him in
We'll send him out on a rail
(to William) We'll finish on the way to Boston
You can fly home from Boston
William nods, exhausted, as Dick opens the door
In walks a small general of a man in a baseball t-shirt, well-trimmed beard and bowl cut
He holds the super-new Halliburton briefcase
He is  , 25
man from the midwest, with a vision of the future of rock and roll
Already in his head are all the things that will come to pass
Higher ticket prices
Merchandising deals
Greater distribution and accounting of album sales
He shrugs hello to the band
(completely unthreatening) Hi
We already have a manager
He's been with us from the beginning
Hope appreciates the lack of small talk
He strides the room with the joyful enthusiasm of a kid who wants to build a fort
Russell watches, dismissive, holding his guitar
Respectfully
We all have our roots
believe in bands holding onto their roots
But those roots need to be augmented
'm gonna tell you the truth -  may enrage some and enthrall others
don't really give a fuck
Your manager here needs a manager
Example
If you hadn't run out on the contract in Phoenix, you could have sued over Russell's hand
but you left, negating the contract, forfeiting the deposit, and you effectively traveled a long way to pay that promoter
to electrocute you
Russell looks at his hand
(cont'd) We can all work together
Your damages have put you way into the hole for this tour
Right now you owe the record company more than you've got
But your record's selling, there's money to be made
So 've brought a plane in, we can add more shows to make-up the difference
Respectfully
(immediately) We travel by bus
Doris is the soul of this band
That bus has been our home since we were the Jeff Bebe Band
Dick watches his loyal band with admiration
Hey man -- it's travel on a pogo stick if  thought we'd make more money
You can play more dates with a plane
112A
-  -  				112A Penny Lane stands on stage facing the empty arena
The roadies have packed up and moved on
She is alone in the poetic and trash filled structure that was just hours ago filled with people
(Behavior to come) : 112B
-- 					112B The band meeting continues
(passionate) Hey man, it's not about the money
It's about Playing music, and turning people on
The band agrees
(delicately) Yes, of course
Clearly
Respectfully
But on the distasteful subject of money
Just know
You're making it -- right now -- and it's all -- He gestures to infinity
(cont'd) -- out there
'm just talking about bringing it -- Bringing his hand together in a fist, he returns it, close to his heart
(cont'd) -- back here
The band looks at Dick, who manages not to be speechless
But why should we pay you for something we can do ourselves
(immediately) Do you know how to keep from getting charged for the ice below the floorboards of Chicago Stadium
Do you know how to do a headlining tour, do you Claire Rothman at the Forum
Do you know Bobbi Cowan, Lisa Robinson, Jim Ladd, Frank Barcelona
(look around, amazed) This is Cleveland
Where's Kid Leo
(basics) Do you know how you get a record not pressed but played
Do you know didn't invent the rainy day, man just own the best umbrella
He laughs
It's fun
Band members are now listening, curiously spellbound
(cont'd) Because as much as you may believe that it will last forever, it does not last forever
your biggest fan right now soon they're going to go to college, gonna wanna buy clothes, spend that money some other way, and you know what
(the final insult) They'll tape your record from a friend's copy
Russell stops fingering his guitar
Shot moves across the faces of the band members
Pain
(cont'd) You've got to take what you can, when you can, while you can
And you've got to do it now That's what the big boys do
The band squirms, but listens
(cont'd) Because if you think Mick Jagger will still be out there trying to be a rock star at age fifty, you're sadly sadly mistaken
Now he's reaching them
Their slackened roar-weary faces stare back at the young dynamo
(flustered) Yeah, well
we'll think about what you said
(casually) No no
You don't understand
'll think about it
'm not auditioning
came here to decide whether  want to represent you
So 'll stand outside for a moment, and think about whether want to stay
He leaves the room with a pleasant shrug
Stunned silence
William watches their body language
No one wants to talk first
Their faces read as -- who was that guy, and how can we talk him into staying
113
-- 							113 William watches as the band stands inside the new plane
Dennis Hope looks on
This is not us
This is too much
He looks around for support
Grim nodding faces
(cont'd) (impressed at seat) This is too much
William watches as Russell reclines
Russell grabs Penny, and she falls into the seat next to him
We hear the loud oncoming sound of the plane in flight, as Dennis cooly asks for Penny's seat
Do you mind
114
-- 					114 Doris the bus stays behind in the parking lot, abandoned near a field
The new plane lifts off in the background, as the bus sits alone, as if crying steel tears
Bus Banner reads simply:
Reprise ending of Whole Lotta Love
115
115 The girls sit on the jumper seats at the back of the plane, with William
116
-- 				116 William trudges the hallway with tape-recorder and notebook, trolling for Russell
He passes Boston travelogue posters on the walls
few room doors are open, he looks for any sign of the guitarist
William veers into Dick's room, where a poker game full of Roadies is in progress
The room is thick with exotic smoke
They are a bunch of road-hardened snobs, smoking cigars and other items, famous to themselves, listening not to rock and roll
but Sarah Vaughn
Anyone seen Russell
The Enemy
Door widens to reveal Russell
Hey
Welcome to the Road Crew Poker Party
This game's been going of for two years
That's Mick - he's with The Who
That's John - with
Geils
And that's Richard with the Eagles
and you know The Wheel
Hey
Grumbling roadies continue playing
Like an old pro, the kid turns down a Cola-can hash-pipe
This hand is down to Dick, and a roadie named  from Humble Pie
Side proposition
For fifty dollars and a case of Heineken,  will put into the pot
three Lovely Ladies, Including the famous Penny Lane
the Band-Aids, who need to exit our tour before New York
It's a deal
Show 'em
Dick lays down three tens
Reg lays down three Kings
Dick loses
Three Lovely Ladies
now in the custody of Humble Pie
Alright, so we owe you fifty dollars and a case of Heineken
Embarrassed, Russell notices the kids face
He leans over, and speaks confidentially to him
Look
Nobody's feelings are getting hurt here
She already knows Leslie's coming To New York tomorrow
They all understand
This is the Circus
Everybody's trying not to go home
Nobody's saying goodbye
No,  got it
These are the Rules that come with every electric Guitar and every amplifier
They're not just written anywhere
Rock and roll, brother
No attachments
No boundaries
But the kid feels bad, and Russell knows it
(cont'd) Quit looking at me like that
116A
- 						116A The kid is still stuck on the road
He is in hell now
Wearily, with deep circles under his eyes, he shuts his eyes for a moment
Another band is moving through
Keep this hallway clear
117
/  -- 			117 William and Penny sit on opposite ends of a blue locker-room bench
It's a small dressing room, crowded with roadies, guitars and men in stages of half-dress
Piles of luggage headed for New York sit by the door
The door suddenly opens and Dick arrives with champagne and a cake decorated with a sparkler
It is placed in Penny's lap
It reads: Unforgettable Penny
Age Unknown
Boston, 1973
They gather now as the cake sits before a surprised and enchanted Penny Lane
Happy Birthday from us
William watches her face as she reads the message on the cake
It hasn't sunk in yet
Russell produces a piece of hotel stationery
He reads a poem
So Penny our friend has gained another year
But long ago, she threw it in gear
She rocked the south The East and West
Could you please get off this endless tour Where we're Black Sabbath's fucking special guest
Laughter
(cont'd) She says she's retired Though we've heard that before
She chose us
And in Penny Lane we trust She is a fan of this band
Much more so than us
William watches her face
Still enchanted, she hands out slices of the cake
(to the point) Sorry the plane isn't bigger
It hits her
She looks at William for a clue
His truthful face does not look away
Now she knows
She turns to the others -- the plane isn't bigger
Shot moves in on Penny as she blinks just a little, cutting into the cake, still mugging for everybody, covering it all with a layer of sweet giddy laughter
Shot comes to rest behind her, her head turning to connect with band members
Each of them look away, nobody maintaining eye contact with her except the one she now doesn't look at
William
She blows out the candles, vamping Marilyn Monroe-style, and sucks off the frosting seductively, to cheers
Russell watches, as we push in on Penny
She notices all the luggage is gone, only her two cases remain by the door
118
--  			118 William exits a backstage Portosan
Penny catches him by the grilling area where catering is preparing for the outdoor event
Their laminated passes swing from around their necks
Thuding in the distance, Stillwater plays for a cheering outdoor crowd
The sound of summer insects in the air
So it wasn't a birthday party, it was a farewell
William doesn't answer
He looks at her, blowing some hair out of her face
(cont'd) You think you can fool me
read you
know what you're thinking
What's that
(touched) You're worried about me and Russell
Yeah
gotta work on that
You're so sweet
God -- if there was more of you in him
Don't tell me this stuff
want to like him
(concerned for him) Did you miss your test or something
He shakes his head
It's so beyond a test
(cont'd) know 'm not on the plane, and 'm not going on some other band's bus
mean,  could go with the Sabbath road crew, but that would be pathetic
The girls are all going with Humble Pie
If you could find out from Russell -- (quietly) Penny - (a decision) Forget it
'm flying to New York myself
have a bunch of partial tickets
know his ex-wife, current girlfriend's going to be there - William's eyebrows rise
She examines his face for clues
-- 'm not sure that's a good idea
(overlapping) What
What are you saying
What do you know
Did Russell say something
don't know anything
know he wants me there
He gave me a cake
He wrote me that sweet poem
(loud) Wake up
Don't go to New York
What are you telling me
She looks so achingly beautiful to him
Because you're not who you said you were
thought you were retired
You're right
'm not who  said was
'm just like you
love music, so this is my family
Some people like tractors, and they hang out with tractor people
What's the worst that could happen if  go to New York
(little girl) " get my little heart broken
" Oh no
Never you
You eat people alive
She tears some leaves off a tree
He looks at her, unable to formulate a response
(accusatory) 'm sorry  told you so much
You have some way of making everybody tell you all their secrets
That's a good one
Tell me too much and make it my fault
He continues walking, she follows
They have ventured outside the backstage area, onto adjoining Boston farmland
The show booms in the background
Come on
You've seen what's happened
Russell and  fell in love
How much, don't know
but this is the first time 've fallen for someone, really fallen
since Iggy, and 'm not happy about it
(beat) You slept with Iggy Pop
She says nothing
(cont'd) (sputtering) Why don't you just tell me now, who else -- so when  go to the record store,  know who to be jealous of
Because right now, it's looking like the whole store
He's upset
She stares at him
(teasing, defiant) You'll remember me forever
was there when you lost your virginity
(upset at the memory) So was Steely Dan
It was a crowded room
She laughs, can't help it
Then: You make me laugh
think 'm gonna cry
(continuing) thought we were going to Morocco
There's no Morocco
There's never been a Morocco
There's not even a Penny Lane
don't even know your real name
If  ever met a guy in the real world, who looked at me the way you just looked at me
When and where does the real world occur
am really
confused here
Fuck
All these Rules And all these sayings
and nicknames
You know -- you're too sweet for rock and roll
Where do you get off
where do you get "sweet
"  'm not sweet
'm dark and mysterious and pissed-off and could be very dangerous to all of you
'm not sweet, and you should know that about me
am The Enemy
You're not any of those things and that's what  love about you
William stands there in disbelief, unable to look at her
You fall in love to keep from falling in love
don't want to go home
Well,  have to go home
And you never helped me
Yes  did
That disc-jockey in Arizona got a better interview than me
and he was asleep
He starts walking back to the stage
She follows
They are two very young kids thrashed by the seas of rock and roll
His frustration increases
She just doesn't get it
Applause in b
g
She grabs his shirt
Look
You should be happy for me
You don't know what he says to me in private
Maybe it is love
As much as it can be with someone who -- (blurts) -- sold you to Humble Pie for fifty dollars and a case of beer
was there
He is instantly sorry
Her world privately crumbles, but she tries to remain stoic and carefree
What kind of beer
119
-- 					119 Sapphire, Polexia, and Estrella bump along to the music and the road
They strain to maintain dignity in these decidedly third-class surroundings
There's only one small blurry window
Who did this to us
120
'   -- 				120 Mom on the phone
Then don't come home
Don't do this to me
If you're going to miss graduation, don't come home
She hangs up
121
-- 					121 William on the phone
Speechless
122
-- 					122 Elaine faces her Humanities class
She stands in an amphitheater-style, inner-city college classroom, decorated with colorful unorthodox artifacts from her home
These earnest city college students listen to her
But she cannot continue
There is a thundering upset inside her
'm sorry
can't concentrate
(beat, confesses, unhinged) Rock stars kidnaped my son
123
-- 						123 Music
Russell and band bounces down in
Russell listens to music on headphones plugged into large boom box
124
-- 						124 William watches, facing the band from the jump seat of their limousine, heading into New York
Up ahead, Manhattan looms, beautiful and scary
"New York
Just like  pictured it
"
skyscrapers and everything
" (to William) We showed you America
We did everything but get you laid
Beat
They look at each other curiously
How much does the other guy know
125
-- 						125 Russell and band spill out of limo
The New York cluster of hardcore Stillwater fans wait outside
They hold collector's sleeves covering albums to be autographed, and fresh magic markers in hand
William in tow crawls out of the limo last
Dick goes to work, pulling luggage from the trunk
serious- looking Fan () approaches Russell with an autograph card
'm from the Church of Lenny
We bow to his will and all that it represents - The King of the King of Kings
Make it out to -
To Lenny
Russell nods -- of course
He signs, as Dick approaches with a well-placed word in his right ear
She's here
William turns, expecting to see Penny
Instead we see the long-limbed, athletic, pretty and collegiate
She holds a Nikon camera, and snaps their picture
Leslie
Your room is completely stocked, far away from any noisy ice machines, elevators or maid quarters
The air- conditioning is already on
And here is your security key -- by the way, you look stunning
(taking treatment for granted) ThanksI'llseeyoulater
Nearby, the young journalist studies the tour's subtle shift in welcoming Leslie
Dick's New York side is almost military
Bags in five
Cars leave for the party at six
William studies Leslie, everyone saying hello to her, everyone knowing the subtext
Nobody saying a word
William pulls his heavy bag out of the back of the limousine
The bag breaks, and the contents spill out onto the New York sidewalk
Bars of soap, ashtrays, hotel keys, crumpled paper, the contraband t-shirt, "Do Not Disturb" signs, notes, towels and thick telephone books from every city
(cont'd) You know
There are lighter souvenirs
(embarrassed) Well --  kept thinking  was going home the next day -- did too
Fifteen years ago
All help him with his spilled souvenirs
Russell shares a private look with the kid
Nearby Leslie greets other band members
Ric
It's Super Zeppelin fan Ric Nunez
(whispers) It's all happening
Zeppelin is at the Plaza
So's four other bands
They're partying up there right now
Sapphire, and Miss Penny Lane too
She wants you to call her
(William reacts) They're all staying under the name Emily Rugburn
William takes in the information, while regarding Ric's new custom  shirt, which features the words to Zeppelin's "The Rain Song
" (exiting with Leslie) After the party
'll come to your room -  promise
We'll talk
This is Leslie, by the way
Leslie, this is our wayward friend from Rolling Stone
The Enemy
They shake, she smiles randomly
126
-- 				126 William checks in
William Miller
Sir, you have an urgent call from a Mr
"Ben Fong-Torres
" He's holding for you, right now
William takes the phone
The Clerk watches curiously as the kid adopts a new persona
(deep voice) Hello
'  --   -- On a rainy day in San Francisco, Ben Fong-Torres stands in the copy-strewn office of the young editor/publisher
Several other editors are also present in the background, including David Felton with cigarette-holder in mouth, and a prep-school Fact-Checker named
Congratulations
It's gonna be a cover
Neal Preston will shoot 'em next week in
we need you back in San Francisco tomorrow
We'll finish the story here
William is overwhelmed with many emotions, fear topping the list
(cont'd) You can tell the band
Allison, our fact checker, needs you to transmit whatever you have of the story, tonight, now, along with your notes
There is a mojo at the Daily News they'll let us use - Mojo
mojo
It's a very modern machine that transmits pages over the telephone
It only takes eighteen Minutes a page
126A
-- 					126A The sound of feet on pavement
William looks at addresses, hustling to the Daily News office
126B
-- 				126B William tears pages from his notebook and feeds them into the large and clunky earliest model fax machine -- "The Mojo
"  We hear David Bowie
"The Jean Genie
" A127
'   -- 					A127 William weaves, exhausted, into the Stillwater press party at this legendary New York nightspot
The Doorman, who checks i
d
s, sees the kid and expresses great doubt
He's okay, he's with us - Hope shoves him past the Guard, and sends him into a very mature new world
127
'   -- 					127 The famous hub of New York rock and roll
strong whiff of decadence mixes with youthful naivete
Not a hippie in sight
William walks through, looking for familiar faces
Overhead we hear Stillwater
"If You Say Nothing
"  The party is filled with scenesters, long silver-haired glamsters, some British journalists, and many hunched young skinny bodies in leather jackets
Russell grabs him by the arm
Ah ha
There you are, ya little fucker
Come on -- have some good news
-- 'll piss to that
Follow me
A128
' 						A128 They enter the small bathroom
Russell bolts the door, faces the urinal and pees
His own music throbs in the next room
Dennis Hope took me aside, and wants to manage Me solo
Says to lose the band by February
Should  do it have no perspective anymore
William pees in silence
(cont'd) At what point do  just take the hint
Nobody Loves this band
People like us, do they love us
do
(then pissed) Oh - get this - somebody told Penny Lane  sold her for beer
The network of these chicks
Like  would do that
It's Jeff who told her, right
Not you, right
None of these guys can just calm down and be a fuckin adult
Now she's here, freaking out
Leslie can smell it
(exiting) Wait
've got something to tell - But he finds himself trailing Russell to the back room bar
128
'  -  -  				128 Leslie in the bathroom
Penny enters and watches her discreetly
They stand together, side-by-side at the mirror
Leslie looks once, turns and then turns back at Penny
She knows
129
-- 						129 William sits with the band
Over Jeff's head, Penny hangs nearby, at the outskirts, drinking and dancing
They share a look, feigning casualty
You guys -- you guys -- (beat) You're gonna be on the cover of Rolling Stone
Stunned and overwhelmed, the band waits a beat, lets it sink in
and goes wild
Russell, stunned too, looks at the kid
It's big news
Jeff stands immediately, eyes moist, glass raised
(tears welling, instantly) The cover of Rolling Stone
And we made it together
They don't just put somebody with one little hit on the cover of Rolling Stone Fucking Magazine, man
We made it
The band nods solemnly, importantly
(cont'd) (continuing) Damn it -- 'm gonna enjoy this
The first time  bought that magazine The Beatles were on the cover
Four of them
Four of us
Together
They begin singing the then-current Dr
Hook and the Medicine Show hit, "The Cover of the Rolling Stone" to William
Who is that girl
She's creeping me out
She's not with any of you, is she
/ She's with me
And now Leslie has confirmation
symphony of looks, as Dick gets to his feet and moves to confront Penny
Penny Lane's eyes fill and she runs out
Russell stands
and sees William also stand
William turns and follows her
Russell stands watching, and does not leave
We hear Elton John's  "Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters
" 130
'   -- 					130 William exits as a crush of Partygoers arrives
He doesn't know where she is
He takes off to examine the cabs stuck in traffic
Song continues
He looks in the backs of cabs
None of them her
Music continues
He runs down the streets, looking for her
Alone in New York City
131
-- 						131 William on the house phone
Emily Rugburn, please
132
-- 					132 William approaches Suite 702
The door is open
He hears new band voices, and sees new faces
# 1 intercepts him
Hi
'm a friend of Penny Lane's
# 1 Aren't we all - Musician types are leaving
Where is she
Room Service arrives
Some appetizers and a large expensive bottle of champagne on ice
Can somebody sign for this
William does
(cont'd) Thank you Mr
Rugburn
Two more Musicans (English) exit the back room party
The room is clearing out
She's sick
Let's get out of here
# 2 She used to be so much more together
William watches all, champagne in hand, and finds her in the backroom
She's addled and nearly passed out
What happened
'm not good at goodbyes
She sags
He grabs the phone
(cont'd) You're the last of my old-time friends
Polexia went to England with Deep Purple
can you believe that
Even Sapphire's out someplace else
All she left was her quaaludes
Oh -- wonderful
(into phone) Front desk
Please send a doctor
Room
what room
703
702
Both rooms, either room
This is Mr
Rugburn, Yes
My wife's had an accident with some quaaludes
Yes - 'll do that
The room has emptied out
Just them, and the remnants of a movable party that has moved elsewhere
(cont'd) Wake up
He struggles to get her on her feet
She tips over on her strappy platform shoes
He struggles to untie them
133
-- 						133 The School band plays "Colour My World
"  School  at the podium
And now
out graduating class
Jane Abbott
peppy student bounds up and grabs her diploma
Elaine Miller watches dolefully in the audience
134
-- 						134 William holds Penny in his arms
Finally she is close to him
135
-- 					135 Victor Sanchez
Warm applause for another student who grabs his diploma
He takes off his mortar board to flash an American flag bandana
He raises his diploma in victory
136
-- 						136 William holds Penny Lane, and keeps her moving
It's a sagging, messy slow dance
"In the unlikely event of a water landing
" "
you will be required to wear a safety vest
" Keep going
"Please place all stowable luggage in the overhead compartments
out in the seat in front of you
" (prompting) "Seat and tray tables
" "And seat-backs and tray-tables should be in their full and upright and locked positions
" 137
-- 					137 And now
out "Pending" Graduates
(pause) William Miller
not present
Elaine applauds her son, stoically
It is a dagger through her heart
sympathetic look from a nearby Mother continues the pain
138
- 						138 They move slowly, she's fading
"In the tragic event of a water landing
" 139
- 						139 The Principal shares a few thoughts: And to the class of 1973, we say -- (beat) Don't forget to remember yourself as you are today
Full of hope
and the dream that everything is possible
Remember this, twenty years from now, when we all own home computers and we all travel in shiny electrical cars that move swiftly, high above the city
(beat) They key to the future is keeping today alive forever
Elaine's head lowers slowly in a sea of happy parents
The day will never end
Mrs
Deegan slips into the seat next to her
First
Release the guilt
(Elaine nods) Second - Please let there be only two, because can't get past Number One
Second
Leave a little room for the other teachers in this world
He's out there looking for mentors
He's got twelve of them
They're lined up
He's just tired of me
A140
-- 						A140 William holds Penny
She is very woozy
"
you will be required to
" (gives up) 'm tired
She is very groggy, as he holds her
Well
Now that  have your attention
And you may not remember this later, just want to make it clear that
Hey
(she blinks, barely awake again) know you've heard this before
And have never said this to anybody, not really - well, nobody who didn't legally have to say it back to me, but - (tries to be casual) love you
And  have a hard time sharing you with all of rock and roll because  - why am  nervous
- You'll never remember this -
- (she blinks) love you, and 'm about to boldly go where
Many men have gone before
He kisses her
doctor and nurse come crashing into the room
They push past William and pull Penny into the bathroom
He sits on the edge of the bed, looking into the bathroom, as they work on her
We hear Stevie Wonder
"My Cherie Amor
" 140
- 							140 Doctor places a tube down Penny Lane's throat
bored nurse holds a water-bag, lowering it to ground level
' Her feet sticking out, wriggling
He watches, as music continues
Her amber-colored stomach contents look like a Jackson Pollack portrait of the era, with three partially dissolved pills
Doctor hands enter frame and remove them
Music continues
141
-  					141 The Doctor re-appears, and sits down next to William, as the Nurse exits
The Doctor withdraws a three-page report form
Your wife will be okay for now - Thank you Doctor
However, she says you're her brother
(eyes report) She's a little confused
The ice shifts in the champagne bucket nearby
The Doctor sizes up the situation
Nice champagne
don't have a driver's license
With me
Tomorrow's my wedding anniversary
'd prefer to take care of this without facing the dawn at the police station
So if you can find a way to get this girl - your wife - back home to her parents, 'd let you pay me anything you can afford
Because you don't appear to be related to the famous Rugburns of Rhode Island
His eyes flick to the champagne
The kid takes a hint, reaches over to the champagne
Happy Anniversary
The Doctor puts the champagne in his bag
She won't be good company, but keep her awake for another four hours
142
-- 				142 Song continues
William and Penny drag themselves through the airport
He guides her to the ticket counter
Penny wears her green coat, large sunglasses
He sorts through her many partial tickets
They are both so tired
She shakes off her coat -- she's suddenly very hot -- and he grabs it and loops it through her bags
She's irritable, and ready to go home
143
- 					143 (baring her soul) When  was 14, my Mom and her boyfriend took me to a Rolling Stones concert - and  freaked out and  rushed up to the front of the stage and then a thousand people had the same idea at the same time and  was getting crushed
And  couldn't breathe and that thought flashed through me - almost like a car accident -  thought  might die
And it was in the middle of "Midnight Rambler" and Keith Richards saw me
And he came over, and came to the front of the stage, and he pulled me out
And they took me backstage and they gave me coke with ice and a - and a lemon
And  never went home
What about your Mom
She always said - "Marry Up
" Marry someone grand
That's why she named me Lady
(horrified) She named you Lady
Lady Goodman
No
You never really get used to it, either
Well -- this -- this just explains everything
He wishes it did
She rubs her stomach
It's a rocky morning
(cont'd) See you back in the real world
See you back there
She kisses his forehead, and takes off down the accordian leading to her plane
She drops her coat again, bending down to retrieve it
Hey Lady
Four Woman turn, but not Penny
She disappears
144
- 						144 Penny Lane settles into her seat on the airplane
She notices William watching from the terminal window, and waves
Please extinguish all flammable items, and return all seats and tray tables to their full and upright locked positions
She mouths along with the words
There is no one to share the joke with
And then a few blurry memories come back to her
She gestures to him
understanding him more fully
as he disappears
145
- 					145 William walks alongside her plane, moving from terminal window to terminal window
Catching her glance again, he's picking up steam
What's she saying
146
- 							146 She keeps watching as he runs alongside, still keeping up with her plane
She now fully remembers, and places her outstretched fingers on the window
She mouths the words:   'll see you back home
He us running through her fingers
Who can run no further
147
-- 						147 Russell and William are in mid-interview
The kid's microphone is out
It's a little bit of a rough flight
William wears the same clothes
Why didn't you come back to the party
Bob Dylan showed up
He was sitting at our table for
had to be an hour, right
Just Rapping
Bob Dylan kept looking for you
was going to introduce you
The kid feels pain
What happened to you last night
It's a log story
sharp jolt of turbulence
Russell begins pounding on the card table in rhythm
(singing Buddy Holly) "Peggy Sure
Peggy Sue
" Please
"Pretty pretty pretty pretty Peggy Sue
" moment of laughter, and then bam
Jeff's drink rises and suspends briefly in mid-air
The plane takes another mighty knock
We shouldn't be here
Doris, we miss you
Fear is creeping in around the edges
William, already an uneasy flier, looks down
' This is Craig, your pilot
It appears we've caught the edge of that electrical storm we were trying to outrun
Buckle up tight now
We're gonna do our best to getcha out of this
The rocking of the plane worsens, as all buckle up
"Electrical storm
" (strapping in for a roller coaster) Rock and roll
The sky darkens abruptly
William looks up, increasingly nervous, stares straight ahead
The plane suddenly drops and stabilizes
Everyone is silent but Russell
(cont'd) Wooooooo Baby
moment later, an ashen-faced - emerges, balancing himself with hands on the ceiling of the shuddering plane
- We're gonna try to land in Tupelo
We're going to have to cut the inside lighting for the next several minutes
We found a field to land in
The kid notices Silent Ed is rubbing a small crucifix
field
can't breathe
Push in on Russell
We hear a series of unfamiliar electrical sounds
The plane screwballs through the sky
- It might be a rough set-down
We should be fine
(cracking at the edges) But what we do say in a situation like this is - We would pass but before the plane
disassembled
However, God help us, if there's anything you want to say to each other, any secrets, anything like that, now would be a good time
But just hang in there
We'll get you out of this
He returns to the cockpit
The weather worsens, as the hail suddenly pelts the plane, and it comes down hard
Inside lights shut off
William stares straight ahead, as the cockpit door swings open - total chaos visible inside - and then shuts again
And everyone thinks it's so glamorous out here
(oddly detached) He just told us we're gonna die
(insecurities running wild) We're gonna crash in Elvis' hometown -- Shut up
-- we can't even die in an original city
'mon Dennis, get us a better city
Nervous laughter
Another sheet of hail hits the plane
Oh my God
Just shaking
Nearly in tears
Hyperventilating
If something should happen
love all of you
don't think we have to do the secrets thing
The plane shakes
Now lightening strikes very close flashing wall of electricity rolls through the plane and evaporates with a burning smell still in the air
In the darkness: once hit a man in Dearborn, Michigan
hit-and-run
hit him and kept on going
don't know if he's alive or dead, but 'm sorry
(gripped with fear) Oh my God
The plane wildly rises, and falls
It stops for a moment strange smooth patch
love you all too, and you're my family
Especially since Marna left me
But if  ever took an extra dollar or two, here and there, it was because knew 'd earned it
slept with Marna, Dick
did too
waited until you broke up with her
But me too
also slept with Leslie, when you were fighting
You
slept with Jeff
Yes, but it didn't count
It was the summer we decided to be free of all rules
(to Jeff) And you say you "love me
" (the truth) don't love you, man
never did
Please
Enough
of us love you
You act above us
You
Finally
The truth
You just held it over us, like you light leave
like we're lucky to be with you
And we had to live with it
had to live with you, and now  might die with you and it's not fucking fair
William watches, catatonic
(to Larry and Ed) You hate me
You too
Larry stares at him
Ed says nothing
(cont'd) All this love
All this loyalty
(incredulous, giddy) And you don't even like me
And 'm still in love with you Leslie
Bam
The plane is pulling sideways, and dropping altitude
don't want to hear anymore
Shut up
Shut up
Shut up
(to Jeff) Whatever happens, you're dead
Don't be self-righteous, Russell, not now
You were sleeping with Penny, that groupie
Last summer, and up until yesterday
Why don't you tell Leslie
Russell tries to get up and attack him
The force keeps him in his seat
He yells
Loud
(freaking out) quit
The turbulence worsens
William finds his mouth saying emotional words he cannot control
"That groupie
"  She was a Band-Aid
All she did was love your band
And you all -- you used her, all of you
You used her and threw her away
She almost died last night, while you were with Bob Dylan
You're always talking about the fans, the fans, the fans
She was your biggest fan and you threw her away
And if you can't see that, that's your biggest problem
Russell and Jeff stare at each other
The plane is rocking very very hard
Leslie is crying
'm gay
They all turn to the silent drummer
(It's his first spoken dialogue of the movie
) Then
The plane pops out from below the clouds
Sunshine spikes through the embattled windows of the plane, as they float downwards to the city of Tupelo, Mississippi
very very uneasy silence fills the plane
No one can look at each other
Out bursts the Co-Pilot, giddy with victory
- Thank God above, '
' '
Shot of all the occupants, ending with Russell
Suddenly, the alternative seems far more attractive
We hear Rod Stewart's "Jo's Lament" as music plays over their still-shocked faces
148
-- 				148 Music continues, as they walk together like ghosts in a long and very pregnant silence, ignoring the kid
Everything is different now
The kid peels off and throws up in a dumpster
We continue with the band, unhappily moving forward
William hustles back to catch up
They ignore him
There are much bigger thoughts in play
No one wants to speak
Well,  think we can build on this new honesty
Boom
Russell attacks him, and they're pulled apart
The band continues moving forward, arriving at a fork in the airport terminals
William stops
This is where he must part company
He stands at the mouth of the next terminal, as the band continues, unaware he's split off
He watches their backs, they've forgotten him
Then Russell turns, sensing something missing
William
All now stop and turn
Still shell-shocked, they summon a pre- occupied but heartfelt goodbye
William waves
Music continues
William's finger finds San Francisco
149
--   -- 					149 The kid checks the address as he arrives at the  Building, and its next-door neighbor, the San Francisco headquarters of Rolling Stone Magazine
He still wears the same clothes from last night in New York
150
-- 				150 William arrives at the front desk, gets the once-over from  a friendly , a paragon of new cool
Leave your package at the desk
'm not a messenger
'm one of your writers
William Miller
He is zombie-tired, with heavy duffel case and his orange bag
151
-- 					151 William walks down the center aisle
Editors and writers look at him, standing at the front of their cubicles to see this exhausted 15 year-old writer
At the end of the aisle, like a human finish line, stand Ben Fong-Torres
You're William Miller
The secret emerges not with a bang but with a slight and tired nod of the head
Yep
(putting it all together) Oh baby
Ben leads him into the office of Jann Wenner, the editor- publisher
152
'  -- 					152 William sits
Editors are feverishly discussing the next issue
The big concerns of a national magazine are in the air
Everyone is focused and quick
The conversation is machine- gun like
Jann Werner turns to the kid
We can't run this piece
The kid's eyes travel to his story -- a stack of fuzzy-looking sheets on the table
You obviously saw more than you wrote about
After eight days on the road with these guys
Didn't anything happen
And where are you in this piece
What did you want to write
Because this reads like what they wanted you to write
What happened to your highly-touted think piece on limitations of a middle- level Band in the face of success
William sits speechless
It's sinking in
Failure
Conversation continues at a fast pace: We can push up Chet's Who cover - Good 'cause it's going to take me three days to get through this research
It's all handwritten, on little slips
Plus, they all refer to woman as "chicks
"  mean, as a woman  have a problem with that
know it's a side issue
(sympathetic, loquacious) It's a "puff piece
"  you fell for 'em
It happens
relationship forms
You want them to like you
(wistful, chewing cigarette holder) Happened with me and Charlie Manson
He was a very charming
lively
charismatic
Felton catches himself swooning
The other are staring at him
He snaps out of it
(cont'd) mass-murderer
Please let me finish it
Give me tonight to work on it
Chet's piece is all fact-checked and ready
(to William) Get some sleep
We'll do another story sometime
We'll get you a kill fee
His research is all on little bits of paper
Did  say that
Ben
You told me to send what  had
It's not finished
That's being charitable
Ben looks at the kid, then at Jann
Jann scans the kid's face for a beat, nods
Let him use the big office
It's where Hunter used to write
William rises, gratefully
He shakes Jann's hand
(pointed re: his age) You can type
Yes
It took it in grade school
153
-- 						153 William sits in the "big" office
It's a small white tank
After all the sound and fury, there is only the hum of a large electric typewriter
His research, transcripts and some band photos sit nearby
He takes a bite of a candy bar, a sip of coffee
He looks at the phone
'  -- Crazy jazz is playing
Lester Bangs on the phone
Aw, man
You made friends with them
See, friendship is the booze they feed you
They want you to get drunk on feeling like you belong
: -- William in the empty Rolling Stone office
(ruefully) Well, it was fun
They make you feel cool
And hey met you
You are not "cool
" know
Even when  though  was, knew  wasn't
That's because we are uncool
And while women will always be a problem for guys like us, most of the great   art in the world is about that very problem
Good-looking people have no spine
Their art never lasts
They  get the girls, but we're smarter
can really see that now
Yeah, great art is about conflict and pain and guilt and longing and love disguised as sex, and sex disguised as love
and let's face it, you got a big head start
'm glad you were home
'm always home
'm uncool
Me too
(leveling) The only true currency in this bankrupt world if what we share with someone else when we're uncool
(distraught) feel better My advice to you
know you think those guys are your friends
You want to be a true friend to them
William takes a deep breath
Looks at the research cassettes and notebooks
The empty page
Be honest and unmerciful
(beat) You're doing great
Call me later is you want
'm always up
154
-- 			154 Ben Fong-Torres and David Felton look at William's new manuscript with great interest
Read me the opening line
(reads aloud) " am flying high over Tupelo, Mississippi, with America's hottest band, and we are all about to die
" Mmmmm
(as if sampling wine) Dark
Lively
Yeah, and it gets better
(impressed) Did this all really happen
William sleeps restlessly nearby, mouth agape, sitting upright in a plastic chair
(jealously reaches for manuscript) Give it to me
'll call and check the quotes
155
-- 						 155 The band rides in a new tour bus
The palpable tone in the air is --
Look
Let's just piece together our information
because the fact-checker asked us all about different parts of the story
What did he write about
What's he using
It
All
He's using it all
So what
So what
(beat) We come off like amateurs
some average band
trying to come to grips, jealous and fighting and breaking up - we're buffoons
Maybe we just don't see ourselves the way we really are
He was supposed to be our friend
(ruefully, remembering) told him to write what he wanted
All eyes look to Russell
(to Russell) By the way, he has you on acid, screaming " Am  Golden God" from a fan's rooftop
(immediately remembering) Oh my God
They used him to fuck us
(still back at "Golden God") didn't say "Golden God
"  Or did
We never took him seriously, and now it's serious
liked him as a person
He was never a "person
"  He was a journalist
Russell nods
He looks at Silent Ed, drumming soundlessly on a rubber pad
You
You had the right idea all along
Ed silently nods thanks
(nervously) How about the plane flight
It's all in there
But don't worry, it's all unspecific who say what
No names are mentioned in the more embarrassing sequences, it's just completely obvious who's who
We're fucked
Silence
forgot he was there
Well, they haven't talked to Russell - he can always deny the key stuff to the fact checker
Then they can't print it
(brightening) Is that true
It's war, my friend
If you'd met me earlier, he would have never been on the around
Dennis hands Russell the phone
(cont'd) He'll live
156
-- 					156 William is still being congratulated by his new peers
We see him woozy but beaming, as Allison the Fact Checker comes out of her office, waving the manuscript
She works her way through the cluster of editors
The band just denied 90% of the story
It's a fabrication
Everyone looks at William, who is speechless and confused
Their congratulations stop on a dime
The fact checker can't resist twisting the knife a little
(cont'd) You weren't honest
And worse, you wasted our time
Did you talk to Russell
Russell Hammond is the one who denied it
(darkly) Crazy
(one last shot, to William) We're going with the Who -
The kid has been sandbagged
The machine of a big-time magazine whirs into action on another story, as the cluster moves down the hall
' He's just some fan
what did you expect
William sits there, as only David Felton stay behind, brandishing his cigarette-holder
He sits down next to the kid
Well,  believe you
He looks at the kid, decides to offer a personal parable
(cont'd) Jim Morrison once came to my house and drank a beer
The beer is still on my mantle
'm 35 years old with Jim Morrison's beer as a shrine
wanted to be Earnest Hemingway
Instead have Jim Morrison's beer
(shrugs, he's learned to live with it) If you didn't make your story up, good for you
If you did make it up
good for you
The kid looks at him, too tired and still in shock
(cont'd) Say something, so  know you're alive
Goodbye
He exits
Powerful  word
Strong
Final
157
- 					157 Russell Hammond sits down on a plastic chair with a paper-plate filled with buffet-style food - steak and baked potato
Preoccupied, and several seats away from other crew members
He drinks a glass of milk
Out old friend Sapphire takes the seat next to him, holding a skimpy paper plate of vegetables
feel bad
Well, at least you feel
That puts you in a higher class of asshole
They eat in silence
Sapphire looks around
The new breed of groupies eye her, as they cruise Russell on the periphery
They're bolder, flashier
She eyes them back with seniority
What did  do
Well - you can do what the big boys do
(he looks at her) Nothing
Yeah
The girls still circle Russell nearby
He's unaware
You believe these new girls
None of 'em take birth control, and they eat all the steak
She looks sadly at her plate of vegetables
An ever-sharp mind in last night's clothes, she commands Russell's respect
(cont'd) They don't even know what it id to be a fan
To blindly love some silly piece of music
or some band so much that it hurts
please,  they're all just after the money
Shoo -- (in their direction) Go rob a bank
It's more honest
Is Penny okay
The Quaalude Incident
Yeah, it wasn't pretty
She could have died
always warned her about letting too many guys fall in love with her
guess  was wrong
(shrugs) On of 'em saved her life
Russell nods
Well, it's finally over with Leslie
'm going to call her
Let her retire
(he doesn't respond) You want to lock her up in a house in Michigan
Please
(he doesn't respond) Write her a song someday
She deserves it
Something about that girl brought out the best in a lot of
(looks around backstage) pretty average people
She deserves it
Russell stares into his crew meal, nodding a little
(cont'd) (forward thinking) because something tells me twenty years from now, we'll remember her
and not much else
Russell smiles to himself, knows it's true
Dick passes, placing hands on Russell's shoulders, massaging a little
Have a good vacation
hope the band stays together
Before it all went down the shitter, it was starting to get really good
Dick claps Russell on the back, and moves on
He turns to Sapphire
'm not going to blame myself
do make people happy
They just shouldn't get to know me
'cause it appears to spoil everything
Don't be so easy on yourself
What gives you the right to get this personal with me
Let's not reminisce
158
-- 				158 William moves like a zombie through the airport, and collapses in a seat
He sits still in the crowded flow of human traffic
cluster of Flight Attendants pass
One stops, a stylish young woman wearing a tall bubble-shaped  hat with swirling colors
William
He looks at her
He feels like he's on Mars, and she looks like a Martian
(cont'd) You guys this is my brother
(ad if meeting a celebrity) "The Narc
William looks woefully at them, like a dog who's been hit by a car
You guys, 'll deadhead back later think 'm needed
Nice to finally meet you
You have a good day
Anita looks in her brother's face
You look awful, but that's great
You're living your life
You're finally free of
her
Yeah
Hey
'll take off work
Let's have an adventure together
You and me, finally
Anywhere you want to go
Anywhere in the world
159
'  -- 					159 William whistles the family whistle
Sister and brother trudge up the steps
This is not my idea of a good time
Just get me to my bed
(resigned) 'll deal with her
William whistles again
Mom meets them at the door
She looks at her trashed son who has finally come home
For the first time, she hugs Anita first, and it's not lost on Anita
It's a clumsy neck-hug, neither wanting to commit
The kid passes to his Mother's left, with suitcase, intentionally nudging her into his sister
Anita takes this as an aggressive act of love, and hugs her mother back
Tears stream down Mom's face
Their cheeks touch
Mom pulls away, and sees her own tears on Anita's face
Thinking that she's also crying, she grabs a tissue for them both
160
'  -- 					160 The kid stands in the hallway listening, shaking his head, poised to enter his room, unseen by them
(so worried) What are we going to do about him
don't know
Whatever happened to him, just wish it could have happened to me
The magazine killed his story
Now they really hug, Anita gulping back real tears
William watches them bonding over the oddest thing - his failure
William goes into the bedroom, the final three feet to sleep, and shuts the door
hand places a hotel sign on the door - Slight push in
He collapses with all his clothes on, almost instantly asleep
His walls, just as he left them, boast a pantheon of rock heroes
with a very lonely Abraham Lincoln (or Atticus Finch)  in the center
161
-- 					161 The elevator doors ding open, and out walks Russell Hammond
The Secretary has just finished answering the phone, "Straight Arrow Publishers
"  She puts the caller on hold
Hi, 'm Russel Hammond
You're here regarding
My life
162
- 					162 Russell stands with the editors, observing the fine portraits on the walls
He's behind enemy lines, and he knows it
Everything in the room fascinates him
don't care what happens
don't care if you put us on the cover
But you sent us a kid and
and he was a fan
And we all made friends with him - absolutely, to get a good story
But then we actually liked him
We thought he's
show us our lives in some mythic way and  guess
we're not mythic
We panicked
You denied most of the story
Yeah, well, here's the problem with the truth
It's too true Well, we appreciate the visit
The last time an artist came here, it was Buddy Miles and he punched me
'm not punching anybody
am personally, as of 2 pm yesterday, on a voyage of self-reinvention
This is about William Miller
(counting off fingers) He lives with us, he lost his virginity, he saw us at our worst, appreciated our best, he saved two lives, including mine
he smuggled about a half-pound of pot into Boston, and we never even told him - Nearby, David Felton looks at another editor, raising an eyebrow
(cont'd) -- we told him too much, we told him everything
He almost died with us over Tupelo
if the band survives him, it'll be a miracle
but you know, he tried to keep up, and that's a journalist to me
It's too late
We're going with a different cover
(immediately) Thank God
But Russell looks around at the numerous portraits if dead legendary rock stars, fixing on the one photo closest to all of them, a very vulnerable-looking Janis Joplin
second thought
(cont'd) You tell me it's too late
But  could go back to my hotel room and
and tonight and something tells me you'd find a way to put me on the cover of the next issue
Am  right
He looks at their faces
They cannot disagree
(cont'd) 'm learning the game
(beat, shrug) We fucked up
We made friends with him
Next time we'll all be more professional
Maybe so
(beat, an odd thought) But God forbid, the day comes when selling yourself is as important as the music you make
(rueful, to Hendrix on the wall) You might have died at the right time, my friend
Thank you for visiting
Good luck
Do what you want, but the story is true
at the entrance
Raises his hand
(cont'd) Good evening
162A
- 						162A Russell stands outside, a traveling man with no where to go
Oddly, and in a way that surprises him, the world begins to speak to him again
little noises everywhere, turning into a music of its own
It's a beautiful and compelling "silence
" He thrusts his hands deep in his pockets, and takes a breath of life
His head filling again with the music of the world, he begins to walk down the street
Very naturally, and quite randomly, he is noticed by young passersby
They can't help it
He looks like a star
They can't quite figure out who it is, but it's someone, and they begin to follow him down the street
Unbeknownst to him as he walks along, deep in thought, a small crowd begins to form
following him
163
- 					163 quiet kitchen
Anita has been cooking
substantial breakfast has been placed on the table
Sausage, orange juice
and now Anita sets down a plate of pancakes, with syrup and butter, in front of her mother
William watches his mother facing an old enemy - white sugar
They're called pancakes
Who knows when we'll be together again
Splurge
It's what most people call breakfast
Mom looks at her children, and takes a breath
went through your records
And found a song to play for you
She goes to the stereo and puts on a record
The two children eye each other - what's coming next
(Song to be chosen) The two kids eye each other again
Self-consciously avoiding their gaze, Mom sits and toys with her breakfast
It's a song she clearly wants them to hear
It's a song from the heart
They look at her, amazed
Elaine looks up, regards her family
Somehow they're back at this table
They continue eating breakfast

Someone reaches in to cut the cord, as the magazines puff up into view

The title: Stillwater Runs Deep
Just another stack of magazines waiting to be places in the racks
