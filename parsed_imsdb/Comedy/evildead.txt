Scene #12, Interior, Day, Dining Room - Something evil is lurking deep withing the wooded moun- tains of Tennessee, and the camera takes its point of view
Rising from a swampy bog, the mud slides from view allowing it to see early morning mist hanging about the forest
Creeping silently past trees, gliding over small shrubs, it moves onward through the woods until a mammoth oak rests directly in its path
The tree is uprooted by this unseen force, and falls with a deafening crash
- Near by, a stretch of highway curves along the base of a mountain
The road winds off into oblivion beyond other peaks
From behind view, the rumble of an engine can be heard
It is a large logging truck headed south
Moving away, the truck becomes smaller until finally it disap- pears in the distance
From where the truck emerged, a dilapidated gold 1973 Oldsmobile comes into view
- Inside, five people can be seen
They are couples and ,  and , and , 's sister
Both  and  wear "Michigan State" -shirts, and are students along with the others at that univer- sity
is driving and  sits next to him up front
,  and  are in back
They listen to an old "Baby Moses And The Thrillers" song on the radio, and  is slapping the dash board as if it were a drum
(Singing with the music)
Together, forever
Ash, where are we
'll tell ya in a second
Now we're still on seventy-five just past the county border
- Once again, the camera takes the point of view of the dark and brooding force which stops atop a forest ridge to peer downward
Its view focuses upon the 1973 Olds- mobile speeding along the narrow highway below
- traces a route on the map with his finger
Which would put us
which would put us
Jesus Christ, just tell us already will ya
zeroes in on the map with his finger
Right
is growing impatient
Right
Yes
Here
Suddenly, the radio stops, and the steering wheel jerks from 's hand
- The car screetches out of control into the opposite lane
large oncoming tanker truck with its horn screaming races toward the car on a collision coarse
- Scotty, watch out
- The truck races closer
- Their steering wheel is locked
Turn
10 - At the last possible instant, 's wheel again can be controlled, and the car swerves sharply back into its own lane
11 - The truck speeds harmlessly past them
12 - Damn it Scott, what the hell was that
You trying to kill us
Don't yell at me, it's your lousy steering wheel
The damn thing jerked right out of my hand
can't understand it
just had this thing in for a tune-up
Radio's dead too, ace
And  just had 'em tune up the whole thing yesterday
Well, then take it back 'cause the damn thing don't work
Only thing that works on the whole car is the lousy horn
honks the horn
13 - Several local  walking down the highway respond to the horn by waving
14 - yells out the window at them
Aw, go to hell, 'm not waving at ya
He looks in the rear view mirror
The  are still wav- ing in the distance
turns back to drive
Jesus Christ
turns around in the front seat and holds up a pint of Scotch
Well, 'd like to make a toast
To Scott who almost killed us
Aw, eat shit and die will ya
and the others laugh
Okay, okay- then to a wild week-end in a wonderful cabin with good friends, (She glances at ) provided we live that long
cooly drinks from the Scotch and passes the bottle back to  and
pours  a drink in the bottle cap and keeps the bottle
They raise their drinks
and With good friends
They toast, drink and react to the strong liquor tries to hide his reaction to the Scotch in front of , since  had reacted so calmly
passes the bottle to  who stops him with a polite "No, thank you," then back up front to
Hey Scotty, what's this place like anyway
Well, the guy that's renting it says it's an old place, little run down, but it's right up in the mountains- totally secluded
(He takes a drink from the bottle) Best part is, we get it so cheap
Why are we getting it so cheap
don't know, might be in real bad shape
You mean nobody's seen this place yet
Not yet
Might not be too bad
No
Actually, it might be very nice
Yeah
It's probably a real pit
can't believe that we're renting a place for a week-end that nobody's seen
(Mumbling to himself) Jesus Christ, not this again
(Turning to ) You know, mom and dad would never let us go up to a place like this if they knew- -Which is exactly why they don't know
'll tell you who  am gonna call
The guys that fixed up this car
15 - The car approaches an exit along the highway
16 - glances at the map again
Hey,  think this is where we get off
17 - The car turns off the main highway and follows several back roads until it approaches a narrow dirt lane that winds upward along a twin set of mountains
18 - glances up to the peaks
These mountains seem familiar
What do they remind you of
Some- thing majestic
Adventure
Yeah, more like adventure
Any adventure in particular
Shelly's sweater
and  laugh out loud
laughs quietly, and  lets out an embarassed giggle to herself
(Teasing) Oooh, you're gonna get it Scotty, when you least expect it, you're gonna get it good
19 - Finally, the car arrives at a wooden bridge extending over a great chasm
Carefully, the vehicle crosses
20 - It is late afternoon when they eventually arrive at their destination
The small wooden cabin is surrounded by thick dark woods
shuts off the car but it contin- ues to sputter and backfire
21 - reacts to his car
sent 'em a check for the tune-up
but 'm just not paying for it
This place is perfect
The woods come awfully close to the house don't they
So what's wrong with the woods, they can't bite ya
It's just a little claustrophobic that's all
Well,  think it's beautiful
Me too, it's gonna be a bomb week- end
22 - moves to the front door of the cabin where he finds a small ring of keys concealed on the shelf above the door
unloads the car to the others
It's supposed to be one of these on here
After trying several keys, he is able to unlock the door
23 -
The interior of the cabin is completely dark opens the door and stands silhouetted in the doorway for a moment, then enters to find the light switch
The illumination reveals floors, walls, and ceilings made of cedar
There are two small bedrooms, a kitchen, and the main room which contains a stone fireplace set into the wall
An old grandfather clock stands silently in one corner, partially hidden in the shadows
door in the rear of the cabin leads to a small work shed containing a work bench and an assortment of tools upon the wall
Located centrally in the main room is a trap door leading to the cellar
This catches 's eye
Hey, this place has a dungeon
puts down a case of art supplies, and moves over to  by the trap door
He unlocks a chain securing the trap door with one of his keys and hands the ring to
Put these back will you
leaves with the keys, and  tries to open the hatch but cannot
They nailed it shut
Good,  don't like cellars
Probably just some garbage down there anyways
Cheryl, they don't nail garbage in cellars
mean it's not going to try and get out or anything
Well, what's down there
Well, could be any number of things
Old baseball cards, mushrooms, dead bodies- Hey, look at this
is standing in the corner next to the old grand- father clock
She repositions a balance weight, and it begins to tick
Ta daaaaaa
The others applaud and whistle
smiles
24 - The cabin is seen from the outside
Twilight has come
25 -
sits alone in the living room near the window
She is drawing sketches of the old clock
As she works, the ticking stops unexpectedly
puts down her pencil and looks up to the clock
It stands silently in the cor- ner with its hands frozen in position
There is a rust- ling from the woods
looks out the window but can see only the trees
Something is moving outside, yet re- mains hidden within the forest
gust of wind fills the room
glances down at her hand
It turns a pale white and begins to shake and jerk about uncontrollably
She stares on incredulously as her hand, guided by some unseen force picks up the pencil and begins to sketch a figure upon her pad
The wind gales through the open window but dies down slowly as her hand completes the drawing
Whatever was at the edge of the woods has now retreated further into them
Her hand loses the pale cast and is now under control once more
picks up her pad of paper
The likeness of a book with some form of ancient writing on its cover has been sketched
She looks to the woods which are now silent
snapping of wood is heard from the cellar
quickly turns to the trap door still nailed shut in the floor
Pos- sibly just a mouse, but she fixes her gaze upon it
Another sound, almost like faint breathing comes from the cellar
26 - /
and  enter from the kitchen
is drink- ing a beer and moves over to
He stands between her and the trap door
What're you drawing Cheryl
He picks up the piece of paper
looks over his shoulder to glance at it
don't know
Is it a bible
No, no it's no bible
(She glances again at the cellar, knowing some- thing is down there)  don't know what it is
Well, this one of the clock's not bad
picks up the sketch and walks over to the clock with it a few steps away
She stands comparing it to the real thing with her back to  and
She is only a few inches from the trap door, and wants to call out in warning when  kneels in front of her to speak secretly
(In a whisper)  got it right here
He taps something in his shirt pocket
is looking past him paying no attention
She watches only 's feet, waiting for whatever is in the cellar to grab them
looks at the drawing in comparison
Cheryl, this is really good
like how you did the numbers in that wood- ish style
produces a small box from his shirt and opens it quickly to show
It contains a gold pendant on a necklace
takes a step closer to the clock
She is now standing almost upon the trap door
Although nailed shut, it opens slightly, pulling the nails with it
gasps
is pleased with her response
(Still in a whisper)  knew you'd like it
Quickly, he places it back in his shirt and touches his lips with a finger to indicate the secrecy of his sup- rise
returns with the sketch and places it back on 's small drawing table
It's really good Cheryl
Very close to the origional
(In a relieved whisper) Yes, very close
'm gonna check dinner
returns to the kitchen and  turns to
You better get washed up
'll see ya in there
He winks, then follows  into the kitchen again looks at the cellar
Slowly, from her point of view, the camera moves in toward the trap door, wait- ing
waiting
27 - blender screams as it mixes up a drink in the kitchen
shuts it off and carries it to the dining room
28 -
She joins the others who are now seated at the dinner table and serves the mixture
sits between and
He leans over to
(In a whisper) Dead bodies in the cellar, dead bodies in the cellar
Will you stop it
Scott, leave her alone will ya
turns toward
Will you relax, 'm just kidding around
She can take a joke- He stops talking as he hears the trickling of water
He turns to see  finish pouring a glass of water in his lap
The others laugh
is silent for a moment, then begins chuckling to himself
He turns to
(Jokingly) 'll get ya
With a napkin, he blots the water from his pants
'll get ya for this Cheryl
stands with his drink and raises the glass
'd like to make a toast for all here this evening
As a greek friend of mine once said, "Nis-hat-nis-fert- dis-ruben-tu-tar-im
" Which means
Party down
The laughter is stifled by a loud snap and cracking of wood heard from the main room
What the hell
All stand from the table and hurry to the main room
29 -
The nails that held down the trap door have been ripped out, and although still in tact, the hatch is wide open
They stand silently in front of it, looking blank as to what could have done this
is slighly more nervous than the others
is the first to speak
(Slowly) What is this
Whatever it is, it's still down there
don't like cellars, let's close it up
(She does not want to deal with it) It's probably just some animal
An animal
An an
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha- that's the stupidest thing  ever heard in my life
Jesus Christ
locates a flashlight and peers into the hole
He traces the old wooden steps into darkness with his light
Maybe it is just some animal
Yeah, probably right
It's probably just some animal
Uh
Cheryl, why don't you make sure
He hands the flashlight to  who quickly gives it back
Scotty, 'm not going down there
Okay, okay you cowards, 'll go
Scotty don't
You're crazy if you go down there
Why don't you wait until morning
Look, 'll be all right
What melodrama
What courage
kiss my brave hero
kisses  and with flashlight in hand, he descends the narrow steps into the cellars blackness
, your virgin queen eagerly await the precious moment when you will ascend
Virgin queen
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha- He disappears below the floor
, ,  and wait above
(Calling down) Hey Scott, see any- thing
There is no answer
Hey Scott
Scott
He's just kidding around
There is silence
Isn't he
No sounds come from the cellar
Linda, get me a flashlight
That's the only one we brought up
spots a lantern on the fireplace mantle
Then get that lantern
brings it over
opens the kerosene valve, lights the wick, and descends into the basement
30 - Down below,  moves quietly past the old stone walls and wooden beams which support the main floor above
In front of him stands an old door which leads to another section of the cellar
Cautiously, he moves toward it
Before he can touch it, the door swings open slowly with a moan
moves through the doorway and deeper into the cellar
Condensation from water pipes above turn the cellar into an echo chamber as drips fall into shallow pools on the dirt floor below
As  scans with his light, he spots a shadow move out the corner of his eye
Scott
breaks into a cold sweat as he moves away from the area where the shadow passed
He backs sqarely into a pair of arms which grab him
Ahhhhhhh
It is only  behind him
What the hell are you doing down here, jerkin' off
How come you didn't answer me
When
Just now,  mean upstairs
didn't hear you
Oh well, did you find anything
Uh-uh
What's this
sweeps his light to another corner and reveals several items atop a small table
Beneath a dusty cloth, he finds a book which appears to be covered in some sort of animal hide, with an ancient form of writing on the cover
Along with this book,  and  uncover a reel to reel tape recorder, an ancient dagger, and other parapanalia including a box of rifle shells
31 - It is evening as darkness surrounds the small cabin
32 -
The group sits huddled around the fireplace talking quietly about school
The same bottle of Scotch is passed around
is rewinding the tape recorder, and once this is done, he turns it on
The voice of an old man is heard
turns to the others who are talking
Shhh, listen to this
My name is Julian Knowby
am a pro- fessor of ancient Egyptian mythology in Dextin university's ancient history department
This is the tape  found downstairs
(Continuing)
am recording this entry from a small cabin in the south- ern mountains of Tennessee
Here,  am staying with my wife for a few weeks so that  may continue my research un- disturbed
Since May, a group of assoc- iate professors and myself have been excavating the ruins of Ca'n Dar believe  have made an important find in that area, and thus the reason for this log
With it,  can keep an ac- curate record of translations from my latest find; the first of six, the others still lost, volumes of ancient Sumarian burial practices and rites
Basically, it is a book of do's and don'ts dealing with the deceased en- titled "Naturan Demanto" roughly trans- lated "Book Of The Dead
" It is bound in human flesh, and inked with blood of the deceased
Jeez, 'd hate to find out what they used for pens
(Continuing)
This particular volume deals with demons and demon resurrect- ion
These are of the Katardi family, meaning those forces believed to inhab- it the jungles and woods of man's do- main
The first few pages that  have translated warn that these demons are dangerous, everpresent, and exist primarily through this book
As legend has it, only the sacred high priests of the Ca'n Dar tribe could posess these books, for they alone could properly control the resurrected de- mons
It is only through the act of reciting the resurrection passage that these demons would be able to posess the living
For many years, it was thought that this legend- turns off the machine at this point
Hey, what'd you do that for
It was just getting good
just don't want to hear any more that's all
(Singing) Cheryl's scared, Cheryl's scared
Scott, leave her alone will ya
Jesus Christ
He moves to the tape recorder and fast forewards it for a bit then stops
She's acting like a baby- it's no big deal
He turns the machine on
The passage continues
Tantir-ah-mis-trobeen-ha-zar-ta 33 - As the tape plays, all natural sounds from the forest die out, and the autumn colors in the trees fade to a gloomy grey
34 -
Tantir-man-ov-mis-hazen-sober
All eyes except 's turn to the window
35 - Outside, clouds roll in from the east, thunder booms in the distance, and as the wind picks up, it begins to rain
36 -
Kanda
37 - section of ground deep within the woods begins to crack, and opens
Smoke seeps out from within, as if some evil force was now being unleashed
38 -
(In a whisper) Shut it off
Kanda
39 - The winds howl, and blackbirds fly from their nests, screaming
40 -
(Louder now) Shut it off
, hearing her for the first time, turns from the window to
She is overwhealmed with fear
Kanda
41 - bolt of lightning strikes very near and its thunder crash is deafening
42 -
can no longer control herself
She screams and covers her ears
Shut it offffff
The window shatters when a branch from a nearby tree tears through it
runs to the tape recorder and turns it off
is crying now, and runs to her room
turns to
Scott, you knew not to play it, mean
mean you knew it was upset- ting her
You just don't know when you're carrying something too far
(To ) 'mon
(Back to ) Big deal, it's just a joke, shit
and  head for their bedroom
mumbles to himself along the way
You'd think she's three years old or something
slams the door behind him
sighs
He moves to the broken window and reaches through it to close the outside shutters
He's really been bothering you hasn't he
walks to a chair near the other window
No
It's not Scott
Scotty's okay
It's just that ever since we came up here, things have been a little too tense
(He sits) All these crazy things going on
And look at that window- we're gonna have to pay for that window now
It'll be better tomorrow
Things'll smooth out, you'll see
hope so
He looks at  lovingly for a long moment
What'ya say we stay up for a while and listen to the storm
Deal
Lemme check on Cheryl
'll be right back
From across the room, she is seen opening 's door a crack
asks if she is all right, and gets a muffled reply
In the foreground,  removes the small box he showed to  earlier and places it in his hand
He glances behind to
She closes 's door and walks back to find  sound asleep with the box in his hand
She reaches for the box and  opens his eyes to watch
looks at him, but his eyes are closed again in time to still appear fast asleep turns her attention back to the box
watches again wide-eyed as she removes it from his hand
Quickly, turns to him but as expected,  is sleeping like a baby
She begins to turn back toward the box and  opens his eyes, but  turns back again in time to catch him with his eyes wide open
Ah ha
(Laughing) Stealing from the blind eh
It's for you
begins to open the box
It better be good
The gold necklace is revealed inside
Oh Ash, it's beautiful
kisses
He removes the necklace from the box and holds it around her neck
(Fastening it around her neck)  was going to give it to you before we left, but things got so hectic, this is the first chance 've had
Do you like it
moves to a mirror
It's beautiful
really love it
(She turns to ) 'll never take it off
43 - Lightning strikes as something in the woods examines the small cottage
Through the outside window,  and can be seen embracing
This force watching them moves around the house to another window
The silhouette of  and  undressing can be seen
The force continues around and arrives at 's window
Inside, she brushes her hair in front of the mirror for a moment, then sets down her brush and moves to the window
She stops to uncrumple the sketch drawn earlier, looks at it, then out to the dark woods
44 -
can faintly hear some kind of sound
It is the same sound she had heard earlier from the cellar noise almost like that of something breathing
45 - The evil entity rounds the corner of the cabin as walks through the rooms to the front door
She can be seen stepping out the door
It closes behind her
Wind shaking the tree branches sends dead leaves fluttering about
(Calling to the woods) Is anybody out there
There is no answer
steps away from the cottage toward the woods
46 - The breeze animates her nightgown and it too seems alive
stops
know someone's out there heard you
heard you in the cellar
Suddenly,  becomes chilled
She folds her arms around herself and stands at the woods edge, listening
There is only darkness and sounds of the evening wind blowing through the trees
steps into the forest a few feet then stops
cry deep within the woods can be heard
She freezes
Whispering in the distance grows somewhat louder and a soft wail is heard- like that of something long since dead, dredged up to roam the earth again
is about to turn back toward the cabin when a rustling comes from a group of trees about twenty yards behind her
She stops
No sound
Nothing moves
Several yards to her left a twig snaps suddenly
She turns but there is silence again
The winds die down, leaving a deathly stillness throughout the woods
Then, all at once, the entire forest becomes alive in a flurry of chaotic noises and movement
Snake-like vines wrap around her ankles and slither up her legs
Tree branches near by begin to claw and rake at her
The force is now moving through the woods toward her
is able to break the vines and run toward the cabin
She emerges from the woods and into the clearing
The force is still following
47 - reaches the cabin door but it is locked
She begins pounding upon the door
Help, help, let me in
Open the door
The evil entity now emerges from the woods
Ashly
Linda
Open up
spots the small key ring above the door where had returned them earlier
One by one, she fran- tically jams one key after another into the lock, but still cannot find the right one
The force comes closer with each key
Please, someone please
Help me, help meeeee
The evil entity is almost upon her, but her actions are so frantic that the ring falls to the ground
She bends down to pick them up, but a hand grabs her arm
It is who has opened the door from the inside
She pushes him in the door and slams it tightly
48 -
What the hell happ- (In hysterics) It
it tried to kill me
,  heard a noise and
and ran and the trees
the trees
What are you- He is cut off by  approaching with the others
Cheryl what's wrong with you
Did something in the woods do this to you
No, no, no
the woods themselves- The trees- they're alive
She hugs  tightly and cries in hysterical sobs
They're alive
Ash, why don't  take her into the bedroom so she can lie down a little- (Cutting her off) -'m not lying down
'm not staying here
We're leaving this place, we're leaving this place right now
Wait a minute, 'm sure as hell not going anywhere
Cheryl- Cheryl, there's nothing out there
Trees do not attack people
Ashly, will you drive me into town or not
(Looking at his watch) Right Now
(He realizes how desperate she is) Sure, sure 'll drive you into town
But if you'll just listen to what you're saying, you- don't care how it sounds
want to leave this minute
You can bring back my things when you go
Okay- if you don't want to stay, can't make you
puts a coat around  as  helps her to the door
49 - and  move to the car
helps  in then then gets in the drivers side
50 - 'll stay some place in town tonight
tries to start the car
There is no response
becomes somewhat worried
tries again
The car will not turn over
look of dread comes across 's face
51 - and the others join the two outside
52 - It's not gonna start
again tries the engine
know it's not gonna start
It's not gonna let us leave
keys the engine and it turns over this time, start- ing up with a roar
, worried by 's condition glances over to her
Confused and upset,  turns away from  and looks out her window
They drive off into the night through the wooded mountains toward town
glances at  who is studying the forest in- tensely for any sign of movement
The concern for his sister is made obvious by the expression on his face
Their car approaches the narrow bridge area and slows down
Why are you slowing down
brings the car to a halt
What is this
's gaze is fixed directly ahead, and his mouth opens slowly
He flips on the high beams which stab through the evening mist
53 - The bridge over the chasm has been torn away
is silent as  walks to the ravine's edge to examine any remains
54 - (Mumbling to herself) No, no, no, no, no
it's not going to let us leave, it's not going to let us go
it's not gonna let us gooooo
55 - An axe is raised into the air, then brought down smash- ing upon a log, splitting it in two
is chopping wood outside the cabin
Behind him, through a window, sits with a cup of tea in her hand watching him
sets his axe down, gathers the wood and moves away
shifts her gaze from  to the woods beyond
The camera moves in toward  then past her to  and  who can be seen playing cards on the floor
is seated near the fireplace with the tape recorder in front of him
He plugs an earphone in so only he can hear it
enters the cabin and passes in front of  to drop his wood to one side of the fireplace
He throws a log in, and heads back outside
56 -
From inside,  speaks
Cheryl, wanna play some cards
(Turning with a smile) Uh-uh
turns to face the window again
Hey, tomorrow morning, we'll find some way around that cliff into town okay
Okay
Outside the window,  chops more wood for the nights fire
turns on the tape recorder to listen with the ear plug
March 12th
Suzanne came after me and almost murdered me
My own wife
At first  thought it was a mental or physical disorder because of what had happened to her eyes, but  was only fooling myself
knew what it was
Outside the window,  continues to chop and gather wood
, still engaged in cards with , holds up one in particular
Okay, guess this card
How am  going to know what card that is
Guess, 'm going to see if you're psychic
The card is a two of clubs
Okaaaay
is it a queen
Right
Really
Yeah
Hey Ash,  guessed the card right
(indifferently) Truly amazing Linda
He is listening intently to the log as it continues
Three days have passed since that thing has been down there
was hop- ing to weaken it without food or water
Nothing worked
Finally, in desperation  dragged her out to the shed and dismembered her so that what- ever it was could not get up again
Cheryl, did you see that
remains with her back to them staring out the window
Try this one
She removes a nine of clubs from the deck and holds it up
Okay, lemme think, uh
She puts her hands to her head in a curved funnel form- ation as if to direct her thoughts to the card
Um, it's a seven
Oh my God, what suit
Diamonds, no wait
mean hearts
That's right- seven of hearts
Hey Ash, did you see that
guessed two cards in a row
(Still not paying attention) How do you do it Linda
He is concentrating on the tape
This is when  saw the dark figures moving about in the woods
should have never tampered with the "Book Of The Dead
"  now know that what- ever it is  have resurrected through this book, is coming for me
You know,  always thought  had some sort of extra sense
You know, like e
s
p or something
What's this one
She holds up the queen of spades
Another seven
don't believe it
(Still looking outside) Queen of spades
looks at her card then back to
She holds up another card
Four of hearts
The card is a four of hearts
bites her lip in fear and reaches for another card
and  listen in silence
Eight of spades
picks up the card
is correct again
Two of spades- jack of diamonds- jack of clubs- Faster and faster she calls them off
Even before can flip them to keep up
Suddenly,  turns toward the group
Her eyes are bone white
's deck of cards slip from her hand and scatter across the floor
's body is hoisted up to its feet and jerked about like a white-eyed marionette
She speaks in a voice un- like her own
Why have you disturbed our sleep, awakened us from our ancient slum- ber
You will die
Like the others before you
We will take you one by one
All of you ha-ha-ha-ha-ha- She screams in a low gruff voice and collapses to the floor
Oh my God, Shelly, get Scott in here
does not respond
Hurry
She exits through the front door
moves to and lifts her head gently
appears unconcious but behind her, she reaches for a pen
Did you see her eyes
'm scared
What's wrong with her
begins to speak when  and  enter
What happened to her
's hand clutches the pen tightly
Look at her eyes
's hand reaches for 's eyes to inspect them, but they blink open
The pen in her hand races upward, then slashes down, ripping into 's achilles tendon
screams fiercely and with a blur, the bloodied pen is raised again
grabs 's arm stopping her, but with a powerful swipe, she swings her remaining arm at  who is sent sprawling across the cabin floor
then clutches  and, almost lifting him, sends his body reeling across the room into a book- case which topples over, trapping him beneath its weight
stands screaming as  now advances toward 's face with the bloody pen
He struggles to pull himself out but cannot
is almost upon him when grabs her from behind
Effortlessly, she tosses him off and moves toward  again
climbs to his feet and grabs the axe
raises the pen above 's face, and  gives her a sharp jab in the jaw with the wooden handle
stumbles past and falls backwards, head first into the cellar
She begins to climb out but  slams the trap door shut upon her hand
It won't close
starts to push the trap door open from below
climbs on top and is almost thrown off until he viciuosly rams the butt of his axe down upon her protruding hand
Demented screams and moans are heard from below as 's hand is finally pulled back and  manages to secure the chain across the hatch
57 - Later that evening,  is seen in her bed, sleeping
covers her with a blanket, kisses her, and walks to the door, closing it quietly behind him
58 -
joins  and  who sit near the fire in the main room
From the cellar, strange moans, sobs and laughter emerge, then horrible rasping sounds from 's breathing
Through the next sequence of dialogue, her breathing becomes louder then somewhat quiet
She'll be okay Ash, she just took a bad bump
(Quietly) Yeah
and  listen to the strange noises from below as  looks out the window to the woods beyond
We've still got a few hours before morning
don't know if  can wait that long
You have to
We all have to
Then, once it's light out, we'll try to find a way to get around that chasm
(Covering her ears) Why does she keep making those horrible noises
don't know
And what about her eyes
and  are quiet
What about her eyes
(Desperately) For God's sake what happened to her eyes
patiently sits in the cellars darkness with a streak of light across her eyes from the crack in the trap door
Her head is slightly tilted as she watches and listens to what is said above
From her point of view we hear  speak to
Everything's gonna be all right
's lips part slightly and a thick blackish yellow liquid drools out between her teeth
She grins
59 - Outside, the forest is very dark
The unseen force moves from the wooded area, pushing over small trees and shrubs as it advances
The cottage comes into view and the evil entity glides up to it
The figure of a girl in the cabin window can be seen looking out
The force stops and moves behind a bush
60 -
Inside,  is studying the woods
Scotty,
think there's some- thing out there
joins her at the window and looks out
61 - From within the woods, this force watches  peer out, but he can see nothing
Through the window he says some- thing to reassure  and moves away
62 -
Inside,  can be heard in mid sentence
Is to get some rest
Ash and can stay up with Cheryl
Okay
Everything's gonna be okay
Come morning- you'll see
heads to her bedroom
walks back to the fireplace and sits
He slices twigs from a branch with the Sumarian dagger and tosses them into the fire glances at the Book Of The Dead, then to the old clock
It stands silent
63 - Again, the evil entity watches from outside
It sees leave one room and turn the lights on in another
She begins to undress near the window
The force now moves from behind its cover and rushes at tremendous speed to  who is looking out her bedroom window
She sees it and sheer terror covers her face as a scream stifles itself in her throat, but it is too late
64 -
noise is heard from 's bedroom
drops the small stick he was whittling and looks up
He places the dagger on the floor and walks toward 's room
Shelly, are you okay
She does not answer
approaches her door and turns to
Keep an eye on Cheryl for a minute
65 -
enters the darkness of her room and sees nothing amidst the shadows
Shelly
He looks over to her window
It is open, and wind blows upon the curtains
66 - steps into 's bathroom and sees that the shower curtain is drawn
Cautiously, he moves up to it
Shelly
He pulls the curtain back to reveal an empty tub turns back to the bedroom when  steps into the doorway, posessed
With a scream, she latches upon
Her eyes have gone bone white and she claws at 's face and clothes with her nails
67 -
Screaming,  stumbles through her bedroom with still upon him biting at his throat
68 -
They stagger into the main room where  manages to knock  off himself and into the fireplace
She remains motionless as her head smolders upon the hot coals
rushes to her, grabs an arm and pulls her out
's face and hair on one side of her head are seared and blackened
She blinks her eyes open, turns her charred head to , and speaks in a rasp
Thank you
don't know what  would have done if  had remained on the hot coals burning my pretty flesh
You have pretty skin- give it to us
Cackling,  clutches 's neck and begins throttl- ing the life out of him with a vice-like grip
He tries to break the hold but cannot
also tries but with a backhand blow,  knocks him into a cabinet, smash- ing it to bits
garbled cry for help escapes from 's frothing mouth
reaches down, picks up the Sumarian dagger, and holding  by his throat with one hand, she raises the dagger with the other
, slightly injured, crawls to his feet grabs her raised arm and although choking, swings his camping knife from its side sheath and slices deep into 's raised wrist, almost severing it
murky black ooze pumps from the wound
She emits an ear splitting- howl and tightens her grip on 's throat
He drops the hunting knife
watches terrified, unable to move as  raises her dangling hand (Still clutching the dagger) to her mouth and bites it off
The useless part falls to the floor with the dagger still firmly in its fist
, now almost dead, grabs her severed hand clutching the dagger and in a last attempt, swings it around ramming the blade into her spine
screetches along with  in the cellar, the old grandfather clock gongs and lightning strikes all at the same instant
reaches around with her remaining arm to clutch at the severed hand and knife protruding from her own back
thick black ooze pours from the wound as she bends backward screaming stands in horror, clutching the axe, unable to move
Black ooze runs from 's mouth as her body writhes about spasmatically upon the floor
Gradually, the move- ments cease and she is dead
As  slowly stands to his feet, 's arm grabs his leg
Ahhhhhhh
Some force reanimates her, even though the body is dead
No
no
no
Hit her
's body is hoisted up, jerking about to its feet, and laughing madly
Hit it
screams this as he backs toward  who stands with the axe, paralyzed
Gurgling black ooze, advances toward them with one remaining arm grabs the axe from , pushes him away and slams it into her
Lightning flashes, thunder booms, and screams from the cellar
brings his axe down again and again in a frenzy
Then, after the final chop, there is silence
's body remains on the floor for quite some time- until  can cope with the fact that she is dead and something must be done
Uh
Scott
Yeah
What is uh
what are we gonna do
Bury her
You
can't bury Shelly
She's a friend of ours isn't she
Ash, she's dead
moves away from
Shelly's dead
We're gonna bury her now
bites his lip and looks about blankly
69 - Finally, the body is dragged outside and buried near the work shed
Harsh floodlights from the house make the task look very stark and barren
70 -
and  return inside
heads to 's room to check in on her
71 -
He peers in to see  sleeping peacefully
72 -
quietly returns to the main room
is load- ing new batteries into a flashlight
saw an old hiking trail when we were driving up here
Now  don't know if it goes all the way around that gorge- -Or if it's even still in tact
Or if it's even still in tact
But uh,  guess 'll find out
Take good care of Linda
will
Do you have everything
(Putting on a small back pack) Yeah- all set
Listen
Scotty
'm sorry about falling apart like that when- Don't bother, really
He steps out the door
If  find a way out of here, 'll mark it and then come back
Then if 'm not back here in a few hours
if for some reason
well, if  don't come back, grab Linda, leg and all, and just get her the hell out of here
They shake hands
You're a good man
Good, 'm the best
73 - smiles a good-bye to  and watches him move off into the night
He lingers for a moment by 's grave, then slowly disappears into the woods
74 -
closes the door and turns back to the main room
He sees 's eyes through the crack in the cellar
She has been watching all of this through a space be- tween the trap door and floor
walks past her to 's room
75 -
He opens the door and a crack of light falls across her
wakes up
Who's there
Ash
It's me Linda
Ash,  had a bad dream about Linda
You did baby
Yeah
She's all right isn't she
Yeah
Fine
Is Shelly okay too Ash
can no longer hide his fear and anxiety
He speaks in a whisper so as not to let his voice quiver
Yeah, sure
She's sleeping that's all
Ash,  love you
(She turns over) Get some rest
closes the door behind him and the fear from a few hours ago engulfs him once more
76 -
moves into the main room and stops dead in his tracks when a voice in the cellar speaks
You lied to her
You lied to Linda
Shelly's not sleeping
She's dead
Don't you know the difference
You killed her
You and Scott cut her up with the axe
She's dead ha-ha-ha-ha- ha-ha- picks up the axe and slams it down upon the trap door
is silent from below for a moment, then the hatch opens an inch or so
(The length of the chain securing it) 's white eyes can be seen again
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha- takes the axe and steps outside
77 - He begins to chop wood, taking out his emotions upon the logs with each blow
's blood can still be seen on the blade of the axe
78 -
From her dungeon,  watches  chop wood in the window
The shadow of his axe rising then striking is seen over her white eyes
79 - Exhausted,  puts down the axe
He looks off into the woods but there is no sign of
He returns to the cabin
80 -
begins her taunting again
Soon all of you will be like me and then who will lock you in the cellar
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha- begins to violently ram her fists against the trap door
walks by her to 's room
81 -
She is still asleep
Quietly, so as not to wake her, pulls back her blanket exposing the bandaged leg
He re- moves the wrappings and looks at the wound
As he does this, it infects with a blackened coloration at an in- credible speed
looks up to see if  is still sleeping and sees that she has been watching him with white eyes and an evil grimace upon her face
She lets out a low growl
82 -
jolts backwards out of her room to escape through the front door
He steps outside and stops to look back in
He can see the main room, but finds it difficult to see in 's room, being lost in the shadows
Something ragged and bloody grabs him
It is 's mutilated body ripped and torn to shreds
He is still alive looks behind him through the door to 's room
He can barely make out  who sits on the bed watching him with glaring white eyes
helps  to the couch so he can sit
is in agony and can barely speak
Ash,  think 'm dying
Jesus, can't feel my legs
Uh
uh Scotty you're gonna be okay
You're gonna be just fine- you'll see
He throws another log on the fire
You'll see
He looks off into 's bedroom again, but she is gone
She is now sitting in the corner of the main room where is, watching him
begins to cough with hor- rible rasping sounds
It's, it's not gonna let us leave
Cheryl
Cheryl was right
we're all gonna die here
We're not gonna die
All gonna die
All of us
grabs  and shakes him violently
We're not gonna die
We're not gonna die
We're getting out of here
Now listen to me- is there a way around the chasm
passes out
Scotty
Scott
slaps
He stirs awake and mumbles
Jesus Ash
don't want to die
So
so lonely to die like this
You're not gonna leave me are you
Are you Ash
(Imitating )  don't want to die
So lonely to die like this
You're not gonna leave me are you
Are you Ash
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha- Scott, is there some way around the chasm
Ash, 'm scared-
can't feel my legs
Scott, listen to me please, for God's sake
Is there a way around the chasm
There is
one way, the trail
but the trees, they know
don't you see- they're alive
They're ali-ahhhhhhh
His sentence is cut short as he cries out in sharp pain
Blood dribbles from his nostrils and he doubles over grabbing his stomach
begins to laugh
looks to her, or rather what posesses her with hatred
Shut up
She continues to laugh
in the cellar joins in the laughter
walks to  and slaps her but she continues
He grabs a hunting rifle from a rack on the wall, loads it with shells, flips off the safety and places the barrels against 's head
God forgive me Linda
The laughter stops and her eyes return to normal
It is  again
puts down the rifle
Ash, oh Ash, help Me
Please
She hugs him tightly
Don't let them take me away again, please, please, please
(Crying and holding her tightly) won't,  won't-  promise
's voice is heard from the blackness of the cellar
Ashly
Ashly, help me
Let me out of here
'm all right now
releases  and moves cautiously to the cellar
remains behind nervously fumbling with her necklace
'm all right now, Ashly
'm all right
Come unlock this chain and let me out
Cheryl
There is no reply from the cellar
looks through the crack but sees only darkness
He reaches for the chain and begins to unlock it, but sensing something wrong, he stops
Cheryl
He puts his ear to the floor listening for the slight- est sound
's arms rip through the floor boards and grab 's head
He breaks away and her hand reaches for the chain but cannot quite grasp it
Slowly it withdraws beneath the floor
( little too sweet) Ash, what are you doing
This is your sister Cheryl
Don't you recognize me
Her voice drifts off, and the evil leughter resumes from the celler
(Crying and yelling to the cellar) You bastards
Why are you doing this
Why
There is silence for a moment
Laughter from behind him begins again
It is
Her eyes are white once more, and she laughs at
Oh
Linda
With newly found courage,  angrily grabs  by the legs and drags her outside
83 - It's useless, useless, useless
In time we'll come for him, then you ha-ha-ha-ha-ha- leaves her in the woods and runs back to the cabin, closing the door behind him
84 -
is coughing again
Ash, Ash, please
don't want to die- but
but  can't stand this pain
It hurts Ash
Gimme something
Gimme something to put me out
Scott,  can't
-  know it's bad
But  can't be alone now,  can't
'd lose my mind
Please Ash, please
You'll get better- you'll see
's laughter is faintly heard outside
moves to the window and pulls back the curtain
is no longer in the woods but sitting at the edge of the clear- ing, watching  with her glowing white eyes
Yeah, tomorrow, soon, you'll be better and we'll both get out of here tomorrow
There is no tomorrow
You- you've got to kill her and cut- cut her up- your sister too
No, that was only with Shelly
You had to with Shelly
You- Linda loves me
You're delirious-
'll get you some water
places a glass to Scott's lips
Now, now the sun will be up in an hour or so and we'll get out of here together
You, me, Linda, Shelly- n-no not Shelly, she- we'll all go home together
Wouldn't you like to be going home
You'd like that 'd bet, wouldn't ya
There is no answer from
The water runs out of his mouth
Scott
is dead
's laughter is heard again walks to the window and pulls back the curtain
There is nothing there
He turns and she is there
With the Sumarian dagger,  rips into 's shirt, cutting his arm
He screams and watches in horror as she runs her tongue over the dagger, licking the blood from it
She turns her attention toward  again but he grabs her and they struggle
backs  up against , knocking his body to the floor
's gnarled arm reaches up through the broken floor boards and grabs at 's foot
He manages to turn 's arm so the knife is behind her back
Forcefully, pushes her over the body of  and she falls back- ward upon the dagger, impaling herself upon it
The blade tears into her back and rips through her stomach
Lightning flashes, thunder roars, and  screams in a deep growl once, then all is quiet
drags 's corpse past the crumpled body of , past , who watches all of this from below, through the back door and out to the work shed
85 -
He lifts her up onto the work bench and secures her body to it with a number of chains which hang from nails along the wall
He rips down a tarp hanging on the wall to reveal a chain saw
He starts it up and moves toward her
Buzzing madly, the saw is lowered to a position several inches above 's neck
looks into 's face
Her eyes have gone back to blue
He turns off the saw
(In a whisper) Linda
He drops the saw and breaks down crying over 's body
86 - An evening mist drifts out of the woods and cloaks the shed as  carries 's body outside for burial
He lays the body upon the ground and picks up a shovel
Harsh floodlights from the corners of the cabin create strange shadows on the ground as  digs 's grave
She lies on her back during the digging
One of her eyes opens
It is white
drops the shovel and looks at her
She appears to be dead
87 -
Inside the cabin,  begins slamming her fists against the trap door in the cellar again
She wants out
The screws holding the hatch in place begin to loosen
88 - places 's corpse in the grave, oblivious to 's pounding
He begins to cover her with dirt
89 -
has ripped out all but one screw which holds the trap door in tact
90 - glances to the grave and sees 's necklace on top of the dirt mound
He reaches down to pick it up when 's hand shoots up from beneath the grave and grabs him
She pulls herself up out of the grave scream- ing and clutches 's leg with a black and bloodied hand
He twists around, trying to free himself, but she will not let go
By now,  is almost completely out of the grave
With her fingernails, she rips into 's leg, tearing his skin
Screaming, he picks up a large log nearby and swings it roundhouse into her face again and again, breaking the wood into smaller bits
She grabs the log with him clinging to the other end, lifts him up and throws  log and all, away from her hits the ground with considerable force and for the first time begins to comprehend the power of this thing he is dealing with
Thick black ooze pours from 's nose and mouth as she turns toward  sprawled on the ground
Stay back
His hand gropes for the handle of the spade advances toward him, laughing
Linda please, if you can still hear me
Keep away
His fingers tighten on the wooden handle
With a scream, she lunges toward him
From the ground,  swings the spade upward, lopping off her head
The head falls into the mud, but the body falls upon him, grabbing and jerk- ing about spasmatically
Thick black ooze pumps from her neck and  manages to pull himself out from underneath the body
He backs away in disgust and falls
He picks himself up again and sees 's necklace upon the ground
stashes it in his pocket and staggers back to the cabin
91 -
Inside, he looks to the main room beyond 's body
Oh
It is a moan from deep inside him
The trap door is open and  is gone
walks over and kicks it shut
slight breeze sweeps through the front door causing 's bedroom door to creak open
picks up the rifle again and cautiously moves to the door
92 -
He enters
The room is dark and the closet door bangs back and forth because of the breeze
moves toward it, grabs the handle and slowly opens the door
Only clothes are inside
He turns toward the other end of the room and  pops up in the window right by him
He swings and fires, shattering the window backs away and spots the open front door
The door
He makes a mad dash through 's room
93 -
In the main room,  races for the door
94 - Outside,  is almost upon the door
95 - arrives in time, but  has already started reaching in
He slams the door on her fingers and rams his gun butt down upon them
Horrible screams are heard as  withdraws her hand
is able to slam the door and bolt it
He runs to the back entrance lead- ing to the shed and locks it also
On his way back to the main room, he pumps his rifle in preparation
It is his last shell
(To himself) More shells
Where did see that box of shells
96 - From the basement, the trap door lifts open and decends
The bottom step, now rotten, breaks under his weight, and  sprawls to the floor
Slowly, he picks himself up and walks through the dividing stone doorway beneath the water pipes to a small table
On it, he finds the box of shells and quickly loads them into the gun
He ascends the steps and enters the main room once more
97 -
The sound of ticking catches 's attention
He looks up to see the old grandfather clock slowly winding back- wards
He watches and waits tensely
Turning carefully, tries to monitor all the windows
The ticking grows louder
shadow passes in the window before him and he fires, shattering the glass into a million pieces
Wind whips through the cabin swirling glass and leaves to the floor
waits, leaning against the front door for something to happen
He is tense and more determined than ever to survive
He whispers to himself
'mon, c'mon, get it over with, why are you torturing me like this
Placing his hand to his side,  discovers something in his pocket
He lifts it to his eyes
It is 's necklace
Linda
(He whispers) The ticking stops
He tilts his head for the slightest sound
All is silent
From behind, two arms rip through the door and grab him
tears away and falls to the floor
The necklace is tossed away in the confusion
's hands pull away and she looks through a hole in the door
From the floor,  raises his rifle and fires at her head
98 - Clutching at her face and screaming horribly, is jolted from the door
99 -
places a dresser and chair against the holes in the door
Behind , 's corpse sits up and opens its white eyes
It stands and moves toward
He turns with the gun, but  knocks it out of his hands
Desperately,  grabs a table lamp and shatters it across 's head, then jams the exposed socket into his face, shocking him
staggers back several steps, then continues after
100 - Outside, Cheryl is now pounding against the front door
101 -
picks up a small table upon which are the Book Of The Dead, and the professors journal
He throws it at This does not affect him, and he advances closer
The Book Of The Dead lands near the fireplace and edges of the paper darken from the heat
picks up and begins to throttle him as if he were a rag doll
The front door begins to give under 's pounding brings his hands to 's eyes
With a crash, breaks through the front door and begins to push the dresser away
Pages from the Book Of The Dead are smolder- ing now
jams his fingers into 's eyes and slips from the grip
clutches his eye sockets and his back begins to smolder
now sees the book
Its pages burn at the edge
topples the dresser and enters the room
Her face is partially torn away from the shot gun blast
rushes to throw the book onto the burning logs, but , smoldering also, gives him a backhand blow across the head, and he is sent sprawling to the floor
She grabs a fireplace poker with her crushed fingers and turns back to  who is crawl- ing toward the fireplace
When almost in reach of the book,  grabs his leg and begins to pull  back- ward
approaches with smoke pouring from her clothes and slams  across the back with her poker
screams
glitter catches his eye
It is 's necklace
Grabbing it, he tosses the end with a clasp toward the book
It slides off the cover
pulls him back once more as  swings the necklace in a last desperate attempt
raises the poker for the final blow
The necklace drapes over the book and as is dragged, the clasp hooks the cover and pulls the book with him
With a yank, he seizes the book and tosses it upon the blaze
and  freeze
The Book Of The Dead burns in a bluish green flame
Smoke pours from  and as distant demonical screams are heard from the woods
The fireplace poker slips from 's hand and sticks into the wood scarcely an inch from 's head
The bodies of  and  then begin to cave inward upon themselves, collapsing to the floor in smoldering heaps
Finally, nothing is left but the burnt clothing and a blackish grey ooze on the floor where their bodies once were
The old clock begins to tick again, normally
slowly climbs to his feet to stand above the fuming debris
Open- ing his hand, he looks down at 's necklace
The force retreats from him, out the door, slowly returning to the darkness from which it emerged
Gradually, the natural sounds of the forest swell and trees lose their gloom as Autumn colors return
The first rays of sunlight gleam over the woods beyond the cabin
Daybreak has finally come
