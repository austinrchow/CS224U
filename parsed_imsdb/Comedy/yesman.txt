Written by Nicholas Stoller Based On the Book "The Yes Man" by Danny Wallace First Draft February 2, 2007 ' - It's New Year's Eve at Rudy's, a hole-in-the-wall dive
People stream into the bar to celebrate
Outside, (30s) and his soon-to-be ex-girlfriend  are having a quiet intense discussion
You don't do anything more
You used to be fun
Now you hardly ever even leave your apartment
'm here, aren't
That's because it's New Year's Eve
You have to be here
Besides, it's not only social stuff
You used to have dreams
You wanted to go to business school, you wanted to work for the World Bank
So  discovered b-school's not for me
People grow
Growing is " is not for me so 'll do
" You went  is not for me and so  guess 'll sit on the couch for the rest of my life
() Well, look, this sucks, but understand where you're coming from
This is the problem
You don't even care that 'm breaking up with you
Of course  care
But  also understand
You shouldn't just understand
You should be mad
Or upset
Or sad
Or something
2
We're at different places in our lives
get it
Your girlfriend of two years breaks up with you right before New Year's Eve and all you can say is " get it
" It is completely within your right to call me a bitch
That would be inappropriate
(tearing up) can't believe 've been dating someone so emotionless
'mere
It'll be
Carl hugs her
' - Rudy's is a dive bar
Dartboard, pool table, scuffed wooden floors, Miller Lite sign, etc
The patrons are all The New Year's Ball is
Among the patrons is our hero Carl, his best friend , Peter's girlfriend , their party friend  and his ex- girlfriend, Kath who's still a little red-eyed
Three, two, one
happy New Year
Everyone   and
(cont'd) () Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind
Should auld acquaintance be forgot and days of auld lang syne
Well, that was fantastic
Good night, guys
You're going, already
3
We haven't even finished the song yet
saw the ball drop and hugged all of you
Aliens didn't invade
Our computers are still working
What else could possibly happen
Rooney might throw up
It's true
'm very close
see that happen like every night
Good night and Happy New Year
Carl leaves
His friends look concerned
How did he take the break-up
() Like a robot
Two years, and nothing
'm so sorry
'  - Carl goes into his apartment
He lies down in his bed and closes his eyes
His alarm goes off
Carl   off
It's now
'  - Carl gets dressed
He puts on a nametag for Southwest Bank
' Carl walks down the street, fast
He passes a who's name we'll learn is  passing out flyers for a band called "The Flying Buttresses
" 4
Wanna rock out tonight
don't rock out
He walks into Dunkin Donuts
The Dunkin Donuts Cashier hands Carl his coffee
Would you like an Italian-inspired coffee flavoring
No thanks
How about the double doughnut special
No
- Carl sits at his cubicle, flips on his email
(reading the email) Dear Trusted Foreigner, Allow me to introduce myself
am the deposed King of Nigeria and  wish to propose a confidential transaction
(to the computer) Allow me to delete you, my liege
, his needy boss, comes up to him
My teller reporting for duty
'm not a soldier
You're a soldier on the front line of finance
() () 5
(cont'd) So, Carl, 'm having a party this Friday
It's a funny hat party
May  entreat you to come
Carl looks at his calendar
It's totally empty
(clearly lying) 'm out of town
- Carl stands in the middle of the floor staring into the middle distance
approaches him
Hey,  need to speak to a loan specialist and there's no one on the floor
Sorry
Today 'm officially a greeter
Beat
But there's no one around
Someone might come
And if 'm not here, they won't be greeted
You're really not going to help me
Until 'm relieved as a greeter, my hands are tied
The Bank Customer sits down in the sectioned off waiting area as Carl stands in the middle of the floor
It is very awkward
No one comes in
Carl slowly moves so a column blocks the customer's view of him
Now that Carl's behind the column, he has a clear view of the entrance of the bank
Through the floor to ceiling windows, he sees the handsome     , , tear up in a Mercedes
He steps out of the Mercedes with a hot girl on his arm
He and the girl walk into the bank
Carl stares at them, jealously
6
Hey, there
'm Chris Parker
The new president of Southwest Bank
Just wanted to come by and personally introduce myself to every branch manager
That would be me
Norman Calhoun
Chris turns to Carl
'm Carl Kendall
Just a teller
was "just a teller
" And now 'm "just president of the largest bank in the Southwest
" (to Norman) You need anything, you let corporate know
You hear
Definitely
Chris Parker and his   leaves
Carl watches them, clearly jealous
(cont'd) Nice work if you can get it
Am right
(clearly jealous) Yeah, if you're into fake breasts and German engineering
Check and check
The Bank Customer comes around
Can you help me now
No, but this gentleman can
Carl indicates Norman
Norman goes to help the customer
7
Carl stares up at the clock
The clock finally 5:00PM
Think about my party, Carl
Will do
' Carl microwaves a Lean Cuisine
' Carl watches Survivor while eating Lean Cuisine
'  / Carl lays down and closes his eyes
The alarm again
to reveal it's morning
Carl walks into Dunkin Donuts
Would you like an Italian -- No thanks
How about -- No
Carl ignores the girl handing out fliers
8
Valentine party
Just wear something red
Can't
Carl stares as the clock clicks to 5:00
He's out the door
' Carl warms up a frozen pizza
' Carl eats the frozen pizza and watches Big Brother
'  / Carl lies down
The alarm
: -- No

Carl refuses the pamphlet
-- Dress as your favorite animal -- Sorry

It's now just a blur of images of Carl at Southwest Bank, shaking his head `no', eating Lean Cuisine and watching reality television
'  / - Carl's lying on his bed
The phone is ringing
He gets up and answers
Hello
(
) (on the phone) Carl
It's Peter
Where are you
'm in bed
Why
What happened
Did someone die
10
(
) (on the phone) No
It's just -- we're at Rudy's
Celebrating New Year's
Carl looks at the alarm
It's 11:15
It's already 11:15
don't think can make it
Oh, c'mon, Carl
No one's seen you for like forever
Please swing by
No
: (cont'd) Tell everyone Happy New Year
Carl lies down and hangs up the phone
Carl watches his alarm clock   12:00AM
He closes his eyes and goes to sleep
Carl's eating lunch at a picnic table outside
Several bank employees smoke cigarettes near him
An oddly hyper guy named  approaches Carl
Carl Kendall
Alex Eberts
What's up, buddy
Alex hugs Carl
Too much
How've you been can't believe you're still working here
Where've you been
Norman's been heartbroken since you quit
11
Where've  been
You mean, where haven't  been
This year
Dude
have lived
climbed Mt
Kilmanjaro
ate bat in Laos shot a cow with a bazooka
'm not proud of that last one but  did it
How's the bank
Same old same old
See
That's the problem
That's everyone's problem
You've got one life
Why waste it on the same old same old
Alex hands Carl a pamphlet for a "Just Say Yes" seminar
(cont'd) know this will sound queer, but you have to hit this seminar
It changed my life
It will change yours
Unless you like the bank
You kidding
Every day it's impossible not to throw rocks at the place
() Since you don't work here anymore, you want to throw a couple
Yes
Alex starts  rocks at the bank
What're you doing
Stop that was kidding
Norman comes out
What do you think you're doing
(recognizing Alex) Alex Eberts
Is this an alumnae prank
love pranks
Hey, Norman
12
Alex continues throwing rocks at the bank
(into a walkie-talkie) We have a situation
couple portly security guards come out and wrestle Alex to the ground
He manages to escape and run from the bank
Go to the seminar, Carl
You won't be sorry
' Carl walks into his apartment
He hits  on his answering machine
(
) (over the answering ) Carl, it's Peter
know you don't do things anymore, but it'd mean a lot if you'd come by Rudy's tonight
Lucy and  are celebrating our engagement
'  - Carl's watching Hell's Kitchen and eating a frozen pizza
There's a knock on the door
The "Just Say Yes" pamphlet balled up on his desk
He's using it as a napkin
Carl the television show
He stands up and opens the door
Peter
What are you doing here
This is an intervention
You've missed your last event
What're you talking about
Our engagement party
'm sorry
'm just really busy
13
You're watching Hell's Kitchen
That's not even -list reality
So  don't want to go out tonight
Maybe  have to wake up early tomorrow
You don't know
It's bigger than that
You and Kath broke up over a year ago and you still aren't dating anyone
What
So
'm like a sexual camel
only need it once every couple years
don't mean to be harsh but everyone's moving forward
It's like you're still wearing a Timex while the rest of us each have entry level Rolexes
You wear a Rolex
Thanks for noticing
It's an Oyster Perpetual Yachtmaster
Sapphire crystal, self-winding
Four Gs
But that's not the point 'm trying to make
So  don't have an oyster watch
All you and Lucy and Kath do is sit around and talk about real estate and Crate and Barrel
What's wrong with Crate and Barrel
They have adorable stuff at reasonable prices
Forget Crate and Barrel
Maybe 'm just getting more mature
don't need the lifestyle ever night
14
Lifestyle
You have to have a life to have a style of life
You never leave your apartment
You never meet anyone new
hate meeting people
You've become a complete cave dweller
am not a cave dweller
Just the other day, we all went to Summerfest and snuck backstage and you bet me  wouldn't steal something and so  stole a drumstick from that horrible Swedish hillbilly band
That's not very cave dweller of me
Just the other day
That was seven years ago
But that's not possible --  was already working at the bank by then
You had started there three years earlier
Why you've worked at that place for so long is beyond me
You had so much potential
You shouldn't be a teller
You should be the guy who tells the guy who tells the teller what to do
() 've been a teller at Southwest Bank for ten years
How the hell did that happen
(doing the math) Ten years
if  had had a child, he'd be toilet-trained by now
Actually, he'd be in fourth grade
15
(starting to panic) was making out with chicks by fourth grade
was a little man by fourth grade
() Whatever
don't need this shit right now
'm an adult man can live my life as  see fit
Can you please leave
Carl pushes Peter out the door
Carl sits down on the couch
He then unballs the "Just Say Yes" pamphlet
It features an Indian man smiling beatifically
: banner across a stage that has a photo of the same Indian man smiling beatifically
We   to find Carl among the crowd
Carl sits down next to a ,
, Is this your first time at one of Sanji's lectures
() Uh, yeah
() Have you been to this before
, Only like fifty-eight times
Sanji's a genius
Like seriously
he will blow your mind all over the goddamn room
He's like a mind grenade
don't know if  want that
, Oh you do not
But you need it
And that's why you are here
Cool
Do you want anything from the refreshment area
16
, You kidding
That processed shit will kill you faster than a pleasure cruise to Chernobyl
Carl heads over to the refreshment table
Once he's out of her sight, he sits down alone in a corner of the conference room
Ethereal music begins to play over the loudspeakers
People begin to sit
Carl sits down in the back
(
) Life
We are all living it
Carl laughs
No one else does
The lights get rosier
(
) (cont'd) Or are we
Change doesn't start on the surface
It's generated from consciousness
But where is consciousness generated from
Carl looks around
Everyone is nodding along with it
(cont'd) From the external
And the external is manipulated through our choices
And our choices start with one word
The music   to the opening beats of "Jump" by the Pointer Sisters
The rosy colored lights and
It is suddenly like a rock concert
(50s) The whole crowd starts
(cont'd) Yes
Instead of "Jump", Sanji's yelling "Yes
" (cont'd) Say yes
For your life
Yes
Change starts now
Yes
Yes
Yes
Say it with me
Sanji pumps his fist in the air as lame indoor fireworks The crowd
(cont'd) Are you ready to open the door to yes
17
Yes
am sorry, my friends
But cannot hear you
Yes
Shhhhhhh
The crowd quiets
(cont'd) Now is the time when we must greet our new members
Who here is new
Please, do not be shy
, He is
The woman   Carl
The spotlight   to Carl
He is annoyed
Come on up, Future Yes Man
That's
'm just auditing
You can't audit life
Now get on up here
'm cool right here
Then  will come to you
Sanji runs off the stage and joins Carl in the back of the conference hall
The spotlights follow him
(cont'd) What is your name
Carl
18
Let me guess, Carl
This was not your idea to come here, Carl
wouldn't say that
You can tell me, Carl
We are all alone, Carl
The crowd laughs
It wasn't exactly my idea
That's what  thought, Carl
And you think this is all bullshit, Carl, isn't that right, Carl
Honestly
Is there any other way
This whole thing seems retarded
But you are stuck in your life, Carl
Am  right
wouldn't necessarily -- You once had a dream
You wanted to own a boat
house
fancy car
You wanted to a doctor, a lawyer
a business man
Carl nods, surprised at Sanji's incisiveness
(cont'd) You wanted to be more than you are
And yet you have suddenly woken up to find life is passing you by
Am right, Carl
19
Sanji's suddenly getting to Carl
As Sanji talks to him, the moment between them becomes more and more intimate
It should feel like the rest of the crowd has disappeared
little
It's odd that ten years can pass just like that
Sanji snaps
(cont'd) Isn't it, Carl
It is
want you to do something for me, Carl
Tomorrow,  want you only to say yes
Can you do that for me
For one day, Carl
'm not sure -- Please, Carl
Do it for me and you will be doing it for yourself
If you don't have the best day in ten years then  am the uncle of a monkey
Will you do it for me Carl
Just for a day
Yes
Sanji grabs Carl hand and   to his feet
We and the crowd
Welcome to the world of yes
Fireworks and confetti go off
The Wiry, Anxious Woman Gives Carl a creepy thumbs up
'  - Carl's asleep
The phone starts ringing
Carl sleepily grabs the phone
20
Yello
(
) (on the phone) Carl, it's Peter
just wanted to apologize about barging in yesterday
You were right
It's your life to live
Don't worry about it
(
) (on the phone) Me, Lucy and Kath are all going out for brunch
You have any interest in joining
Oh, thanks for the invite, but
'
Will you do it for me Carl
Just for a day
We    '
(in slo-mo) Yes
Excuse me
(clearly not wanting to) Yes
will come to brunch
- Stackers is a cutesie brunch place
Carl walks up to Peter, Lucy and Kath
() Morning, Carl
This is a surprise
Why
21
Because 've never seen you at brunch
Like ever
You kidding
love brunch
- Carl, Peter, Lucy and Kath are still waiting with a big crowd of people to sit down for brunch
Why do people wait an hour for breakfast
It's so hot and bright and we haven't even had coffee yet
If you don't want to be here, you don't have to be
Of course  want to be here love waiting an hour for eggs
It's fun
Although  will point out that you have sunglasses which is probably making this wait a lot easier
Oakleys, polarized lenses, indestructible
Two fifty but worth every penny
The Waitress comes up
Lowell, party of five
group of four people get up to be seated
We were definitely before those Lowell people
hate when people jump ahead
Why does no one ever say anything
22
If you want to be sitting so bad, why don't you say something
Yes
will
Carl walks up to the Waitress
(cont'd) Excuse me, but we were here before those people
No you weren't
Yes, we were
have the list, dude
The list doesn't lie
Meanwhile, the customers the Waitress was going to seat are looking away, trying not to get involved
Well, this time the list lied
It's , Carl
It's just brunch
(to the people who are being seated) You all know that we were up before you
And you have to live with that knowledge through your delightful brunch
Peter pulls Carl away from the Waitress
What's going on with you
just want transparency in terms of the brunch seating order
One of the customers who was being seated heads over
23
Great
Now we're going to get into a fight
We talked about what you said
you're right
You guys were here before us
Sorry we didn't pipe up sooner
We cool, brother
() Yeah
We cool
Carl and the Brunch Dude punch fists and hug
- Carl and his friends are sitting at a table
Carl's slightly bored as his friends discuss real estate
It's a two bedroom duplex with harbor views
It'd be perfect for you Kath
Washer/Dryer in the building
() didn't realize you were looking to buy a place
thought you and would be renters to the end
She's a fancy lawyer making bank
It's about time she was buying
() Shut up
The Brunch Dude is seated near Carl
He gives him a thumbs up
Carl gives a thumbs up right back
(re: the menus) What're you looking at
Bacon and eggs
24
How unadventurous
don't want an adventure first thing in the morning
The Waitress comes over
just want to tell you about my specials
We have a double fruit burnt sugar waffle
Any of you interested in that
Beat
Yes
Alrighty
Then, on the savory side, we have a smoked whitefish omelet with hash browns on the side
Any takers
Beat
Yes
() You want both
Yes
The Waitress writes that down
Would you like toast with that
Yes
Any side
Bacon
Yes
25
Sausage
Yes
Turkey sausage
Yes
side of our famous maple pancakes -- Yes
Wow
Someone's really hungry
Yes
Coffee or juice
Coffee
And juice
We also have smoothies
Yes
Carl's friends look at him like a freak
Is that all
() Yes
(turning towards his ) What would you all like to order
His friends are all looking at Carl
26
Carl has six dishes in front of him
The Waitress comes over with a pepper mill
Would you like some pepper
Yes
The Waitress starts grinding pepper onto Carl's meal
It's starting to take a long time
She's grinding and grinding and grinding
Would you like more
Yes
She keeps grinding
pile of pepper's growing on his food
- All of Carl's food is covered piles of pepper
don't think 've ever seen a waiter tap one of those pepper mills
'm just addicted to the stuff
Chinese cultures say it's good for digestion
() You're all welcome to have some
That's
Do you want a bite of mine
() Yes
Carl takes a bite of Lucy's
He then sips his coffee
27
(cont'd) Uch
Brunch coffee
Why can't they make it black without all this frothy shit
Because you ordered a latte
Carl's phone rings
He answers it
(
) Hey, Carl
We're a little short on our Saturday staff
know this is going against ten years of precedent, but you have any interest in coming in today
don't think
there's any reason why  shouldn't
On a Saturday there's nothing  like more than the inside of a bank
(
) There really is something magical about this place
Carl walks into Dunkin Donuts
Would you like an Italian-inspired coffee flavoring
Beat
Yes
Sugar, Splenda or Nutrasweet
All of them please
The confused Dunkin Donuts cashier loads up Carl's coffee
We're having a special on Munchkins
28
Carl walks out of Dunkin Donuts, carrying a giant coffee and several boxes of Munchkins
He walks by Renee, the cute girl who hands out band fliers
Want a flier
Oh, it's you
Never mind
Of course 'll take a flier
Carl takes a flier
Renee's surprised Carl's taking a flier
(cont'd) () The Flying Buttresses
knew after a year and a half of wearing you down, you'd give in
'm Renee by the way
Renee holds out her hand
Carl
Carl
Cool
like to thank everyone personally who comes to our performances
It gives it a nice intimate touch
See you soon Carl
Carl turns away, nervous that he's accepted her invitation
He takes a sip of his giant coffee and grimaces
Carl   work, hyper from the giant coffee
Morning, Carl
Thanks for coming in and being part of the Saturday banking experience
Oooh, Munchkins
Are those for the office, you dirty devil
29
Yeah
just though it would be a fun way to lighten things up
(deadly serious) You didn't approve this with petty cash
spent my own money on them
Kidding
Munchkins are always approved
Although,  can't reimburse you
(over the intercom) Today is free Munchkin day
That's right
Free Munchkin day
Instantly Carl's cubicle is surrounded by fellow workers
Carl rules
/You're the best
/Finally  have a reason to live today
Carl's greeting
-   comes in
How may  help you
need to speak to a loan specialist
Beat
While loans aren't normally in my jurisdiction, 'd be happy to help you
- Carl's trying to keep up as the customer launches into intense finance-speak
30
want to refi my house and spend the capital on my personal business
see you've got a 5
25 7 year , but over at Chase they're offering 5
00 7 year
Can you refi lower, like at 4
85 par example, or am  going to have to bring my beeswax elsewhere
Yes
Yes
That's it
Yup
What's your business
Selling beanie babies online
Adorable
More like highly profitable
've crunched the numbers
The woman hands over a scrapbook that's been decorated with construction paper and pictures of beanie babies
Carl opens the scrapbook
It's filled with numbers
Let me just get final approval on this
Carl gets up and walks over to Norman
' Carl stands before Norman
You're a teller, not a loan specialist
No,  know, so if you think this is a bad idea for a loan that's fine but can you please tell her yourself
31
What's this
Her business plan
Norman grabs the business plan and starts reading it
Inta-maresting
My grandma loves beanie babies
Although unfortunately, we have a minimum loan floor of ten thousand dollars
She only wants five
That's silly
How're you supposed to start a tiny business if you can't get a tiny business loan
don't make the rules,  just break `em
() don't break them
just wanted to rhyme
If she wants us to loan her ten thousand or more, great
Otherwise,  think her only option is a loan shark
Carl sits back down
() So, what'd he say
Do you maybe have any interest in borrowing ten thousand
can't afford the payments on ten
You can't do five thousand
This is the fifth bank 've been to
Please
Of course we can
One moment please
32
Carl gets up
He heads over to the soda machine and buys a Diet Coke
He then heads over to Norman's desk
(cont'd) Diet Coke
Oooh, thank you
Feed the addiction, am  right
They clink Diet Cokes
Norman  his entire Diet Coke in one swallow
Carl then heads over to the photocopier
He watches Norman out of the corner of his eye
After a couple minutes, Norman gets up and
Carl heads back over to Norman's desk and Carl returns to the loan desk and
It's approved
The Bank Customer  Carl
Thank you so much
promise won't let you down, Mr
Kendall
On me
The Bank Customer hands Carl a panda beanie baby
Thanks, Marge
We don't like to make other customers jealous so can we keep this between you and
Of course
Aren't you just a dear
The Bank Customer leaves
Carl can't help but be touched
- Carl's at the loan desk
Norman comes over, looking grave
Carl, could  see you for a moment
Carl nervously walks into his office
33
' Carl nervously sits before Norman
Earlier today, you showed some initiative
And  loved it
What do you say to a permanent spot at the loan desk
That seems like a lot of responsibility
We need a loan specialist a lot more than we need a teller and greeter
Besides, you'd have a starting salary of 52
Grand
No, dollars
What is this Darfur
(waving to an African- American employee) Sorry, Patricia, that was inappropriate
(then, back to Carl) Of course grand
To celebrate, next Saturday, 'm throwing a party
Dress up as your favorite character from Heroes
() Save the cheerleader, save the world
Next Saturday
sounds great
Don't dress as Hiro
got dibs
Wouldn't think of it
Carl heads back to the loan desk, happy about his promotion
34
' Carl walks in the door
Peter, Lucy and Rooney, who's clearly been there for a little while, comes up to him
Carl Kendall
Out in the world
Are you some kind of ghost
Am having a religious vision
Believe it
Because this guy just got a promotion
Congrats, Carl
Well let's get you a beer
You want a 20 ouncer
'm just joking - Yes
Rooney looks at Peter and Lucy
normal-sized beer is fine with me
think 'm done actually
Two twenty ouncers and one tiny, little beer, barkeep
Please don't call me that
We're not in the middle ages
(to Carl) can't believe you're out here
'm giddy
feel like a child whose best friend has strict Chinese parents who never let him come out and play but now his Chinese parents are away for the Chinese New Year
You have any interest in pounding this shit
35
Why not
Rooney picks up his beer and begins pounding the twenty ouncer
Carl reluctantly pounds it as well
Rooney slams his on the table
Carl puts it on the table
What do you say we have another
Yes
You are a beast
Well, it's been fun watching you guys recreate freshman year, but Peter and  have some furniture errands to run
Carl's a little drunk now
Have a good day yuppifying your lives
We need a sofa, Carl
We're not buying a second home
Whatever, yuppy sellouts
It was good seeing you
You should come out more often
(kind of pleading) Please don't leave me here with him
Peter and Lucy laugh, not realizing that Carl is serious
They leave
' - Carl and Rooney are really drunk
36
have not been this drunk in years
The room is spinning in a bad way
Barkeep
Two more double pints s'il vous plait
That was the last `barkeep
'    am cutting you off
Well fortunately you're not the only game in town
Let's go to some place with class
' - Rooney and Carl are in a Senor Frogs
Where's the class
They wear uniforms here
'  comes over
' Jello shot
Yes
Carl and Rooney do jello shots
: -- Carl and Rooney downing more jello shots
-- Carl and Rooney drinking beers
-- Carl and Rooney are drunkenly staring at a nearby group of girls
(cont'd) That girl is hot
Or at least she seems hot
'm kind of too drunk to tell
Right now, honestly, you seem hot
37
am hot
' Another jello shot
Yes
think 'm done
Carl downs the jello shot
He stumbles a little
' Senor Frog's famous karoake contest is starting now
Sign up and sweep us off our feet
You gotta do karoake
Carl  over to the Senor Frog's
He's losing control and he likes it
Sign me up, bitch
' We've got our first victim mean, singer
: The opening notes of White Town's "Your Woman" Carl grabs the microphone and heads out into the crowd
(  : As you read this part,  recommend listening to White Town's "Your Woman

) (singing/talking with an odd English accent) Just tell me what you've got to say to me, 've been waiting for so long to hear the truth, It comes as no surprise at all you see, So cut the crap and tell me that we're through
Now  know your heart, know your mind, You don't even know you're being unkind, So much for all your highbrow Marxist ways, Just use me up and then you walk away, Boy you can't play me that way

Carl heads over to the   and begins
She thinks it's kind of funny
(cont'd) Well  guess what you say is true, could never be the right kind of girl for you,  could never be your woman
Carl gets really close to the Hot Girl's face and then pulls away for the bridge of the song
During the awesome bridge, Carl does some fantastic dance moves
Or rather, moves that you think are fantastic when you're drunk out of your mind
The Hot Girl laughs at his antics
(cont'd) Well  guess what they say is true, could never spend my life with a man like you,  could never be your woman
could never be your woman
could never be your woman
Carl lands on one knee in front of the Hot Girl
The crowd The Hot Girl's   gets up close to Carl
Everyone is very, very drunk
Were you just flirting with my girlfriend
(re: the Hot Girl) It depends -- is that your girlfriend
Yes
Then yes
Hey, c'mon
Be cool
He was just screwing around
Let me handle this, Crystal
(to Carl) So, you want to have sex with my girlfriend
39
Yes,  do
Very much
Are you starting a fight
'mon, Carl, let's go -- Yes,  am
Then bring it
will
Beat
Carl doesn't really know what to do so he slaps him across the face the way a woman would slap a man
What was that
Me bringing it
The Brutish Boyfriend  Carl in the head
(cont'd) 'm too drunk to feel
'm like Darkman
Carl  the guy
They get into a dirty, drunken tussle
Both of them are trying to hit the other one in the groin region
Bouncers    and
' Carl and Rooney are outside
Carl's nursing his wounds
They are very, very drunk
You popped that guy
He didn't know what hit him
You do not cross Carl Kendall
The Hot Girl  out of Senor Frog's

Hey

He likes to think he's my boyfriend but he's not
You're cute
The Hot Girl  Carl
(cont'd) (') Want to go some place private
Yes
'  - Light is streaming in through the window
Carl opens his eyes
He's in bad shape
He looks over to see the Hot Girl finishing getting dressed
My fiance called
He was like really sorry about last night have to go
Your fiance
Domingo
The guy who punched you in the face
thought you said you two weren't even dating
We were broken up last night

Carl runs to the conference room
The Just Say Yes seminar has been packed up
41
Carl walks up to the counter
Hi
is there a Sanji Gupta staying here
Room 125
Carl walks down the hallway
He knocks on Room 125
After a couple minutes of shuffling around, Sanji opens the door
'm Carl
The guy from yesterday
Of course, of course
Please come in
Carl comes into Sanji's hotel room
(cont'd) Would you like a cup of coffee
No thanks
just wanted to thank you for that inspiration
Fantastic
So how do you plan on continuing with your journey
You know, just living every day to it's fullest
And, like, learning to continue to experience life or whatever
Outstanding, Carl
Except for one : (suddenly intense) You are completely bullshitting me
42
just said 'm going to keep experiencing life
thought you'd be happy
You're like a cigarette addict, Carl
Except you're addicted to boredom
On the way in here, Carl, offered you a coffee and you refused
Perhaps that would have been the most delicious cup of coffee you would have ever had
Who's to say
Not you, Carl, because you said no
Anyone can quit smoking for a day
But for a lifetime
No
So what should  do
Sanji   a contract
Behold, Carl, -- the Maniyesto
Carl takes the Maniyesto
(reading the document) 1) Until New Year's Eve,  must say yes
2) The yes cannot distort the truth
() You cannot say "Yes, the world is flat" because that is an untruth
(reading the document) 3) If someone discovers you are a yes man, you do not have to say yes to them
4) To avoid yes, you cannot avoid contact
Therefore, you must always answer your phone, the door, your postal mail, your email, etc and so on and so forth
5) You must choose a yesponsor to keep you on the straight and narrow
(to Sanji) Who should that be
43
close friend who will not tell a soul
(reading the document) 5)  hereby void the "do you want" loophole
(to Sanji) What is that
If someone asks you "do you want to go to the art museum" and you do not want to, you may not use this lack of desire as an excuse to not go
And finally, a warning
() If you say `no', even once, even for a cup of coffee, be prepared to lose every single little thing you've gained
() So what do you say, Carl
() What do you say
say
yes
Carl signs the Maniyesto
And here
Carl signs again
(cont'd) And here
Carl signs again
(cont'd) And initial here
And here
Is this like a legal document
Kind of
And finally, my friend, please hold out your hand
44
Carl holds out his hand
Sanji   an iron brand that's been heating over a hot pot and  '
That should heal by New Year's
Until then, you are a Yes Man
Carl looks at his palm
In the center of the palm, Sanji's branded a `

For a whole year
Yesterday  got promoted and beat up and hooked up with this chick and  have a massive headache today and  still might throw up, but don't care because it was the best time 've had in like forever
Not to mention finding out that, despite what you might think, smoked whitefish in an omelette is delicious, even if covered in a thick layer of pepper
But for a whole year
You don't   understand

My girlfriends are being such bitches

Peter turns to Carl, smiling
46

Lucy hugs Carl
Carl looks over Lucy's shoulder at Peter and shakes his head

He walks by Renee and wordlessly takes a flier
Hey, give that back
You already took one
What's the hurt in taking another

Destroys the Earth
Also, they cost me ten cents a copy
Besides, are you even going to come
Of course

We do   of him with various people as he walks down the street
might have some stuff to pawn
/ will definitely check out your gun selection
/ would like to learn Korean
If you're interested, intro to Korean is starting right now
50
- Carl's sitting in a Korean class with several businessmen
(in Korean, with ) [Hello, my name is Carl
What is your name
] - Carl stands at the back of a basically empty dive bar, nursing a beer
There's a makeshift stage at the front of the bar
"The Flying Buttresses" are setting up their equipment, including a giant clear plastic harp
Renee steps up to the microphone
Hello Jake, Penelope, Carl and Rodrigo
We are the Flying Buttresses
Their four audience members cheer
The drummer bangs his sticks together and the band launches in
They are terrible
Like really terrible
Renee sings in a high-pitched voice that she probably thinks sounds like Tori Amos, but sounds more like a dog whistle
If you've heard the singer, Joanna Newsom, well that's who she's emulating
(cont'd) () Everyday, the unicorns they play/Among lingonberry fields/They silently bay/The king has no crown/Just a vest of grass/The queen loves the Jester/The Jester has the last laugh

The four people in the audience clap hard as she finishes
Renee takes a huge bow and motions to her fellow band mates
Carl, not knowing how to politely react to the horror show he just witnessed, claps along
Renee gets off the stage and walks over to the bar, right next to Carl
Nice, show Renee
One virgin mint soda coming right up
don't think  hit a high enough octave in Fairy Dream Song
disagree
think you hit some pretty high octaves
But  can hit like way higher
(as she speaks her voice goes higher and higher) Like check this out
think this tone might be more appropriate for my water nymph song
(speaking in a low voice) don't know -- 've known some water nymphs with big balls
(no reaction) From the high level of testosterone
An awkward moment where Renee doesn't react and Carl thinks he may have offended her
Suddenly she starts laughing spazzily hard
Carl smiles
52
've got to write a song about that
could call it
"Big Balled Water Nymph"
It's a working title
like it
can work with that
The drummer, a guy named , shouts down to Renee from the stage
Um, excuse me, but we have to clear the stage
gotta clear
() Unless of course, you want to help
Sure
love clearing stages
Carl helps a surprised Renee clear the stage
Carl has helped Renee fit the giant harp into the back of her ancient Volvo
Well, thanks for coming, Carl must bid good night

Renee gets in her Volvo and drives off
Carl walks off
You interested in learning Spanish
Carl takes the flier from the Flier Guy
Carl walks down the street, now holding a zillion fliers
Carl gets a tap on the shoulder
Kath standing there
(
) Thinking of learning a couple foreign languages
Hey, Kath
Would you like one

Maybe next week
There's someone you should probably meet
Carl, this is Seb
very tall, very blond, Nordic looking man approaches Carl
Seb
What is that
Swedish
Yes
54
Beat
Seb puts his hand on Kath's back
Carl notices this and is not particularly happy
(cont'd) 've heard a lot about you, Carl
Seb's phone rings

Seb returns
Well, it was nice meeting you, Seb

Through the firm
waiter arrives
Would you like to order some wine
// Yes

However, it is a quiet, angry drunk, not a fun-loving drunk
They are still sitting in silence
Seb turns to Kath and starts saying something quietly to her
Oh, this is good
() was walking past Pizza Hut the other day, and for a second  was sure the sign said "Pizza Hat
" And then  thought, wouldn't it be funny if there was a shop that sold hats shaped like pizzas
(beat, weakly) You know
Because it sounds like "Pizza Hut" only it's a hat shop
Look, Carl, why don't you just eat your fish and fuck off
Carl puts the rest of his meal in his mouth, gets up from the table and walks out of the restaurant
As he leaves, he smiles to himself
His phone rings
He sees it's Rooney on the Caller
Shit
Carl answers the phone
56
(
) What's up Carl
It's Rooney
What do you say we grab a couple brewskis
'  - Carl flips on his computer
He's trashed
He has a bunch of emails
He clicks on the email
(
) Dear   brother Carl, Thank you for your   last note you sent me
But we must   move quickly
must have your   bank details right now
Send them   to me
Your Associate, Omar, King   of Nigeria (while typing) Dear Omar, While  appreciate the gravity of your situation, perhaps a goodwill branch is in order
Could you perhaps loan me a million and take it out of my final cut
Then  will happily send you my bank details
Sincerely, Carl
Carl then flips on persianwifefinder
com comes onto the screen
Sa'laam, Carl
You have sixty-five winks
Allah Akbar
The screen is suddenly filled with pictures of Persian women
'  - - Carl's alarm goes off
Carl hits it and sits up
He grabs his head and then runs to the bathroom and throws up
- - Renee, along with several other amateur photographers in sweat suits, have gathered
They all have big cameras around their necks
Carl walks up to them
He does not look good
Good morning
57
Wow
You look tired
Well, it is five in the morning
Mammals are meant to be up at dawn
It's how we're built biologically
Where's your camera
Carl realizes he forgot his camera
thought 'd use my phone
Carl pulls out his camera cell phone
Awesome idea
So light
That's what  thought
Let's hit it
Renee, Carl and the group of amateur jogging photographers start jogging
Carl can barely keep up with them
(cont'd) Oooh, pretty
As she passes a flower, Renee snaps a photo of it
- The group reaches the lake as the sun rises
They all snap photos
Carl finds himself snapping photos on his camera
He accidentally snaps one of Renee with the sun behind her
She looks pretty in the photo
Alright
Enough standing around
Renee starts jogging again
Carl starts after her and then abruptly doubles over and throws up on the ground
Renee and the other jogging/photographers snap photos of him
58
- Carl sits across from an Iranian women
It was delightful meeting you, Carl
As it was meeting you Farinoush
Although  must say  was surprised to discover that you are in no way Persian
Nor are you six foot two
You should change that on your profile
Will do
Should  call you
Sorry,  want a tall guy
The Iranian Woman leaves, passing Lucy
Who was that
Farinoush Azzam
Great girl, but don't think we're right for each other

(ignoring her odd look) Let's talk wedding shower
So,  know it's just a wedding shower, so who cares really
And it's like so lame
But 've made an appointment at a stationery store
Are you going to totally kill me
59
(dripping with sarcasm) You kidding

Lucy gets up
Carl follows her
He does not look happy
- Lucy and Carl are looking over a book of stationery with the Carl can't concentrate
This one is nice
especially love it in cream
Ooooh, pretty
What do you think
Looks good to me
(sarcastic annoyance) Thanks for your opinion
It's always difficult to get the husband-to-be's opinion
(derisive laughter) 'm not marrying him
'm just helping throw the shower
Oh
What's the party going to be like
Sometimes it helps to know that before you pick an invitation
Nothing special
Just hors d'oeuvres and wine
Carl, meanwhile, is looking through the book of invitations
Look at this -- Bridal Bingo
What's Bridal Bingo
60
It's bingo, except you yell out embarrassing facts about the bride and whoever fills their card first wins
That sounds fun
'm not doing Bridal Bingo
How about a calendar shower
Can we concentrate at the task at hand
Do you even know what a calendar shower is
Maybe a calendar shower is awesome
Every guest gets assigned a month and brings a gift that the bride and groom can use during that month
That's kind of cute
think that's really cute
Carl's starting to get really into it
He turns the page and sees an invitation decorated with animals labeled "Knights in White Armor
" (cont'd) Look at this one -- "Knights in White Armor
" The bride and groom ride in on a white stallion
You have got to do that
Like it's not even a choice
61
That seems a little extreme
You only get married once
Your friend happens to be right
You're really good at this
You mind helping me with the wedding invitations

May  speak to you, Carl
' Norman sits across from Carl

What am  doing
You're loaning below our minimum
Carl doesn't know what to say
(cont'd) You thought  wouldn't notice the paperwork
'm not the regional manager because  ignore the details
'm sorry, but it's absurd that if you need a small amount of money you have to go to a loan shark
Only rich people can pay back loans over ten grand
bank's job is not to just help the rich
It's to help anyone with a dream achieve it
63
know
These microloans are pretty interesting
So 'll you spearhead a little pilot program at the bank
Thank you so much
If corporate finds out, you're the one who's getting fired
So keep it quiet
Carl mimes zipping up his mouth and throwing away the key
Rooney sits down across from Carl
What do you need a loan for
don't

My place is right around the corner

They are both drinking tea

Seems like a nice guy
69
She was upset you went on her date
He asked me to join them
think you're taking this too far
have no choice
'm a yes man
must say yes
If Seb asks me to join them on their date,  must
If some dude asks me for a loan have to give it to them even if it's clearly never going to be paid back
If a guy asks me into his bedroom,  must hook up with him
You hooked up with a dude
It's like hooking up with a strong woman
honestly don't see what the big deal is
(back on his yes rant) am guided by yes
Yes has become my superpower
And let me tell, yes is turning out to be a pretty sweet deal
Now if you'll excuse me 'm late for Korean class
You hate Korean food
That's no reason to write off an entire, vibrant culture
See you later, buddy
Carl heads off, the kitten under his arm
Carl walks around a photography gallery
Renee's photos are up
They are terrible photos, since they were taken while she was jogging
Their subjects are blurry
Some of them are half in the photo and half out
The featured photo is of Carl throwing up on the ground
70
You really are displaying that
That's probably my best photo ever
My collages aren't bad
But personally,  think  excel at pottery
Renee  to a ,   that looks like poo
Wow
That's really big
How do you have time for all this stuff
How do you have time to come to every one of my rocks shows even the one in Fairfield county that was seventy-five miles from here
almost skipped that one
You gave me the flier, so  had to go
At first  thought you were a weird stalker and  was scared
But now think you're just a really shy dude with a crush
And while it's been suspenseful to see when/if you'd ask me out -- Do you want to go out sometime
Yes,  would
By the way,  do other stuff besides follow you around
Like what
take Korean
In that case, what do you say we do Korean
71
- Carl's eating across from Renee
He can't stand the food
He grimaces with every bite, but manages to choke it down
Do you want any more squid hot pot
It's really good here
think 'm good
To have some more
Renee spoons a huge amount of squid onto both their plates
(cont'd) So, all this art you create
What do you want to do with it
What do you mean
Like, do you want to open a store
Where  can sell my photos and pottery
Of course not
They're terrible
Carl's surprised that she knows this
They're not terrible
Yeah, they're awful
think you're being hard on yourself -- 'm not asking for sympathy
My voice is way too high-pitched, my pottery looks like poo, and my photos are blurry and subjectless
But who gives a shit
Not everything needs a goal
The world is a playground
You know that as a kid but then somewhere along the way everyone forgets

People always talk about that, but you're actually doing it
Honestly, 'm terrified
() How about you
Do you like the bank
It's lame, but you know, it's pretty funny
My boss Norman always throws theme parties
So if it's lame why do you work there
Because
it's actually not lame
() just gave the answer 've automatically given for years
'm actually enjoying the bank for the first time maybe ever
started this pilot program that gives out microloans
What's that
Like say you need three hundred bucks to pay for paint so you can start a house painting business
Rather than paying a loan shark who charges you 300%, now you can come to Southwest Bank
Whatever
It's kind of dorky
73
That actually sounds really cool
The waitress comes over
(cont'd) 'm stuffed
But  would love to wrap this up
(in Korean, with ) [We are very fat
But can  please have this food made mobile
] So, what do you say we hit this crazy party
Funny, not crazy
My boss is white noise
White noise
You know, like totally boring
don't know anyone who's totally boring
Crack a person's shell -- there's always something creepy underneath
'  - Norman opens the door
He's dressed as the Japanese character Hiro from the show Heroes
Carl
Welcome
Or should  say, uerukamu
What's going on
wouldn't bother
74
You didn't tell her
This is a dress-up as your favorite character from Heroes
Do you watch
currently don't have a television
Norman stares at her
don't know what to do with that information
There are drinks, chips, dips, various and sundry noshes
entreat you to make friends
Let's get this party started
' It's very quiet
couple people mill about
We don't have to stay long
It's a party
Let's socialize
Carl and Renee walk up to a
'm Carl
This is Renee
Hey
'm Khatoon
It's complete silence
Beat
(cont'd) Do  know you from somewhere
don't think so
Are you listed on Persianwifefinder
com
Renee laughs
Carl fake laughs with her
75
(cont'd) Seriously, though, are you
So, how do you know Norman
Karate Club
Norman comes in with more chips
There are now about ten times as many snacks as guests
Baked Lays people
It is on
You're in a karate club
' Everyone's standing around Norman
They've laid several pieces of wood out over a coffee table
Norman
Norman
Norman
Norman   the wood in half
The guests cheer
Norman takes a big bow
(whispering to Carl) Told ya there was something weird under that white noise shell
Renee leaves Carl
You're totally on persianwifefinder
com
SultanCarl
Carl turns to Norman
(changing the subject) Khatoon, Norman
You guys should spar
Khatoon and Norman start to spar
Carl sits back, smiling
, a cynical guy who's slightly drunk, sidles up beside Carl
76
Well, isn't that cute
We've got a full match on
Hey, 'm Jason
They shake hands
'm Carl
What do you do
Work for the
Cool
hate it
Everyday  have to dash some poor guy's dream
'm a professional dream dasher
It can't be that bad
The other day,  turned down a guy who had literally been a professor at the University of Cuba
' Jason's sitting across from a
What
But 've already lived here for five years
've received a steady paycheck and paid taxes for five years
speak fluent English
can't go back
'm sorry but no can do
've passed the citizenship test ten times
bet you couldn't pass that test
You're probably right
Do you know the location of the Spanish-American war
77
Spain
No
America
No
() Spainerica
You are an insult to your country
So did you let him in
sent him back to Cuba
send them all back
If you hate your job so much, why do you do it
Because  have to eat
(to himself, in wonder) You're a no man
Excuse me
Beat
Carl makes a difficult decision
() 'm not supposed to tell anyone this except for my Yesponsor, but you can change your life
've changed mine
If  tell you how, will you promise not to tell anyone
78
(sarcastically whispering ) Yeah, sure, whatever
say yes
To everything
Say Yes More
It's that simple
Dramatic beat
Jason finishes his drink
That's the most retarded idea 've ever heard
Jason heads off
Renee returns
What did  miss
() Nothing
Do you want to go
' Carl and Renee walk into Carl's apartment
Ten kittens and puppies come running up to them as they enter
You work for the
just love pets
This is Veronica, King George, Owen, Carl jr
, Carl the , Carl , Bubbles, Greedo, Cat 1, Cat 2 and Cat 3
At the end there,  got kind of bored of naming them
They walk into Carl's living room/bedroom
'  / The room is piled floor to ceiling with boxes
Renee starts to go through the boxes
You don't need to do that
79
You have a lot of Mexican Viagra
have a congenital heart thing it helps
And it's cheaper than the stuff that's made here
You better not be a criminal
Because one time  dated this guy who jacked cars for a living and did not enjoy living on the edge as much as  thought  would
It's cheaper to buy in bulk
Is that a crime
hundred boxes of Mexican prescription drugs borders on something vaguely criminal
Beat
(cont'd) Well, are you going to make out with me or what
Yes
Carl grabs Renee and starts making out with her
They fall onto the bed
Rooney watching them
You must be Renee
have heard so much about you
Can  watch
Carl doesn't know what to say
Before he has to say yes
No, you can't watch
'  - Renee and Carl lie next to each other
You know what  would love massage
80
give great massages
Carl starts massaging her
Oooh
Yeah
Oooh, right there
Carl stops
(cont'd) Don't stop
Carl continues massaging her
: Carl's still massaging her
He stops
(cont'd) Can you please keep massaging
Carl starts massaging again
: Carl's massaging
His hands are really cramping up
She's asleep
He stops massaging
(cont'd) (while asleep) Please keep massaging, please
Carl starts massaging again, wincing while he does it
- Carl's sitting across from a
Carl's hands are like claws
line of people waits to speak with him
How much does a Schwinn cost
Three hundred fifty three dollars
It'll really help me get my one hour delivery business off the ground
've tried on foot only have a two mile radius
Done and done
81
Carl stamps the package
Norman comes over to the loan desk
Hey, the boys upstairs are here to speak with you
Really
Because  have a thing at one
He asked for you specifically
Ixnay on the small loans-ay
Carl looks over
He sees the President (from the beginning of the movie) sitting in the conference room
Carl gets nervous
- Carl walks into the conference room
The bank president, , motions to a seat
Carl Kendall
'm Chris Parker
President of Southwest Bank
actually met you when  was just a teller
(no recollection of it at ) Of course
(reading from a binder) Pet-a-Puppy day
Free cookie day
Free half hour on the bank's punching bag day
You've upped walk-in traffic by 35%
Not only that -- you've also taken charge of corporate day care
like a team player
Carl's phone buzzes
The caller  says
Thank you
82
But then  got suspicious
What drives a man in his mid to late thirties who's still at the absolute lowest level of our corporate family
Generous helpfulness
Or raging revenge
Generous helpfulness
Which is when  got the numbers from your loan desk
Carl turns white
Carl's phone buzzes again
The text says : "
" Uh huh
You've given out over 682 below minimum loans
One of them was literally for fifteen dollars and eighty seven cents
Janice Peabody's ant farm rental business
How do you explain yourself
've started a microloan project
figure that if someone needs less than ten grand why should they go to a loan shark when they can come to a legitimate banking institution
Because the paperwork makes any profit moot
Unless you're raiding our coffers
No
wouldn't do that
would if  could, so why wouldn't you
83
Chris laughs
Carl laughs
Chris abruptly stops laughing
So does Carl
Carl's phone buzzes again
The text says : "
" (cont'd) But then  looked closer at the numbers
85% of the loan recipients have been paying them off according to the bank's schedule
Not just that, but 72% of that group have returned as regular full loan customers
This is both a moneymaker and good for the community
That like never happens
Thank you
You're the kind of person we want in corporate
We're taking some clients on a golfing trip
You golf
Yes
You free tomorrow
Yes
Of course you are
better watch my back around you, Carl Kendall
Soon you'll be taking my job
See you on the links
Chris Parker grabs Carl's hand and shakes it
Carl  out of the office
Carl  up to the bakery
Lucy's outside
What happened
'm sorry -- bank meeting stuff
84
Lucy and Carl wander around a fancy bakery
've never heard of a Wedding Shower cake
You have to have one
Modern Bride calls them a necessity
Carl's phone rings
(cont'd) Sorry, Luce
Work stuff
(sotto into phone) Yeah,  can definitely be at the blood bank in twenty minutes
Carl hangs up
Lucy suddenly starts crying
(cont'd) Are you
'm sorry, it's just you've been so great at all this while my husband- to-be has been completely absent
Do you have time to grab a cup of tea
Carl and Lucy are each drinking tea
The only other people in the tea room are groups of women
Is he scared to get married
Is that why he doesn't care
You know Peter
He's a man's man
He cares, he just doesn't know how to show it
You know how to show it
wedding is a huge deal
'm so scared
85
You guys are perfect for each other
know that and yet 'm still so scared
Maybe if you're just honest with him about how you're feeling it'll be
He can be just so closed off
Carl's phone rings
Sorry, the bank, you know
(sotto into phone) The  conference is tonight
No, that's fine, 'll definitely be there
Carl hangs up
(cont'd) 'm sorry
You've been so good to me
've really come to depend on you want to pay you back
Not necessary
Peter tells me you might have some disposable income these days
For some reason, the bank keeps promoting me
If you want to look at some open houses, 'm happy to waive my fee
86
- Carl and Lucy walk into a luxurious apartment
Gourmet kitchen, floor to ceiling windows, giant media center
So this is at the very top end of what you could probably afford
Are you interested
Carl hits a button
Yes
Are you sure
mean, this is the first place you've looked -- Yes
've got to run
'm looking forward to meeting Renee tonight
What
We're all having dinner
Tonight
Remember
Right
Of course
Carl runs out
Carl giving blood while on the phone
(on the phone) just think if we're going to be rolling out a no interest financing campaign we should commit hard
He checks his watch
The  walks by
87
(cont'd) (covering the phone) Can you unhook me
have a really important meeting
If you're interested in donating plasma, feel free to sign up
Carl's listening to a lecture
Between 1996 and 2000 England's Ministry of Defence paid security cleared experts to research UFOs
This classified study was code named Project Condign
Carl's phone rings
People look angrily at him
He stands and   in the aisle
Carl   and  inside
His friends are all waiting
Carl pulls Renee aside
'm sorry 'm late
That's fine
It's only the very first time 've met your friends
It was work, it went crazy late
Carl takes a breath
He's about to pass out
What's with the "They're Out There" and " Gave" button
Carl's sporting buttons that say "They're Out There" and " Gave
" 88
Long story
(to the hostess) Miss, could  have an orange juice
Like fast
- Renee, Carl, Kath, Seb, Peter and Lucy sit around a table at a nice restaurant
As per usual, Carl has several different meals in front of him
He also has a martini, a glass of water, and a glass of orange juice
Carl's showing off to his friends
As he shows off, Renee looks irritated
(showing off, to Peter) Your wife found me a really great place
Built in Bose surround sound, a 100 inch  flat screen , roof deck with jacuzzi
Least  could do
At least he's involved with our wedding
(ignoring Lucy's tone) likey your suit-ey
Hugo Boss
Oh, this old thing
Prada, think
You think
We went to three different Prada stores to find the right fit
What do yo do for a living, Renee
paint
'm in a band
do volunteer work at a shelter teach
do balloon animal art
You know, a little of this, a little of that
You should check out her pottery
It's really big
89
It is big
How about you guys
Real estate broker
// Lawyer
Quiet beat
The conversation's not exactly flowing easily
If you'll excuse me
Peter leaves
The waiter comes over
Have you made a decision about the wine
Well, we're kind of in a celebratory mood
In that case, may  suggest a 97 Petit Rothschild
The Waiter points at a wine that costs $400 a bottle
Maybe we should wait for Peter to decide
He doesn't know crap about wine
Just pick one, Carl
Carl is sweating bullets
Why not
Let's celebrate
With six people, 'd recommend two bottles
- Everyone's drinking the wine
Carl's terrified of the bill
90
Do you rent or own
sublet
have this corner of a loft
It's a really nice corner though
If you're ever interested in buying, you should ring me up
hate owning things
Because when you own something, you suddenly are invested in that thing not breaking
And  break everything
've gone through three  in three years
How did you break them
smashed one with a hammer, dropped one off my roof and the third one just went on the fritz
So  set it on fire
Carl's friends don't really know what to say
The check comes
Carl grabs it before anyone else can
It's a $1500 bill
He drops several credit cards down on the table
It's on me
(quietly to the waiter) 'd like to split it between an Advanta Blue Business, Mastercard, a Diners Club and my South Dakota Bank Visa Check card
Carl's outside with Peter
Nice job with Renee
She's definitely odd, but that's not necessarily -- 91
just spent $1500 on dinner
What
Why
Because the waiter asked me if wanted the expensive wine and you weren't there to stop me
Don't get mad at me about it
You can just stop
No  can't
If  didn't say yes to the band flier,  never would have met Renee
If  hadn't said yes to taking charge of bank day care and then yes to becoming a loan specialist and then yes to the president's golf trip,  wouldn't be moving up
Each yes leads to the next one
If  stop, it could all fall apart
You've gone from a passive guy who always said no to a passive guy who always says yes
Just saying yes is not a legitimate life philosophy
don't know why  should be taking advice from a guy who's wife is pissed he's not involved at all with the wedding planning
'm involved
You told her you don't care whether the invite's cream or ivory
can't see the difference
(opening up) Honestly, 'm terrified
92
What
Why
It's marriage, you know
The biggest thing ever
But you guys have dated for years
know
You're perfect for each other
know
She's terrified too
Really
Of course she is
think you'll both be a lot less terrified if you're terrified together
But what if  really can't tell the difference between ivory and cream
Does that make me a bad husband
What matters is that you pretend you can see the difference
The girls and Seb come out from the restaurant with their coats on
There's a silent beat
(high pitched goodbyes) It was wonderful meeting you
/ loved it
/Let me know when you throw your next art thing
Everyone gets into their cars
Carl and Renee walk off
It was great meeting your friends
93
They're a little stiff
Beat
They are a little stiff
What do you feel like doing
'm actually going rollerblading with Ralph
Ralph
You know, crazy rollerblading guitar man
The guy who plays at the promenade
Any interest
No
It's ten on a Friday night
And that guy's crazy
Don't you want to go home and make out
Yes
' Carl and Renee are making while Carl surreptitiously checks his watch
Finally, Renee stops kissing him
() Just go
Carl and     rollerblade down the street while guitar man plays guitar
94
Which is why the merman is not to be trusted, especially with the fisherman's computer brain
That is really good to know
You want to come see the merman
() Yes
- Carl dashes in, covered in spots of paint
Chris appears
What happened to you
: : Carl's playing really intense, terrifying paintball with Norman and Rooney
: do this whole Habitat for Humanity Thing
love the concept of charity
It's awesome
group of   approach Carl and Chris
(cont'd) This is Carl Kendall
This is Jin Kim, Joo-Chan Park, Soo Lee and Seung Kim
Seung's the  of Korean Bank International
The Koreans shake Carl's hand
(in Korean, with ) [It is an honor to meet you
Do you like America
] 95
The Koreans all start speaking Korean at Carl
Carl clearly doesn't understand what they're saying
Chris and Carl follow the Koreans
You speak Korean
Just a little
You sneaky devil
knew  should watch my back around you
Is it a problem if 've never played golf before
You're a funny one, Carl Kendall
Remember, they have to win
In Asian cultures, there's a concept called Saving Face
You have to let them win
But if they smell for a second that you haven't tried your hardest, they'll commit hari kari
Metaphorically
Who knows
It's a delicate balance, Kendall
Like two little girls on a see saw with a crocodile beneath them
Make the wrong move, and the little girl will end up in the croc's maw
Carl stands with the Koreans
Seung Kim is speaking very rapidly at Carl
Carl has no idea what he's saying
Seung Kim laughs
Carl laughs along with him
Chris hits a beautiful shot
His ball lands almost on the green
The Koreans notice and nervously chatter
Chris approaches Carl
96
Alright, buddy
It's all you
Carl grabs a nine iron from the golf bag
Everyone seems very impressed
(cont'd) You must have quite a powerful stroke
do
(in Korean, to Carl) [Good luck, my friend
] (in Korean) [ shall need the luck
This is my first time playing
] Seung Kim laughs
(cont'd) (under his breath) Why does everyone think 'm joking
Carl gingerly places the golf ball on the tee
He looks towards the hole
(cont'd) That's really far
Carl lines up his shot
He swings back, then forward, and the club into the grass, knocking the ball off the tee
The ball rolls down a slight incline resting just a couple feet from where Carl hit it
(cont'd) (in Korean, to Seung Kim) [You're up, Seung Kim
] Carl walks back to where Chris is at
What was that
Just keeping them on their toes
Reverse psychology
Tiger Woods does it
97
Seung Kim raises his club back
He too dubs it, driving the club deep into the grass
His ball rolls just a couple feet past Carl
-- Carl hits the ball straight into a group of trees
-- Seung Kim, standing right in front of a pond, delicately taps his ball right into the pond
-- Carl keeps divoting the grass
He divots so many times that he has to move the ball out of the hole's he's accidentally dug
-- Seung Kim hits his ball out of the sand trap
It rolls back in
He tries again
It rolls back in
He's about to try again when Carl picks up his ball and tosses it over the lip of the sand trap
Carl holds his finger up to his lips: "Shhh
" -- Carl's about to hit the ball when his phone rings
He answers it
(cont'd) Of course not
The other golfers look really impatient
(cont'd) Male
() Apartment
() prefer light beer
() Three to five times a week
() Orlando
Carl holds up his finger
Only one moment
-- It's   getting late
Now both Carl and Seung Kim are hitting   their balls at once to save time
They are both running   and hacking at their balls across the fairway as if they're   playing a deranged game of field hockey
- Carl is counting up the scores
98
Chris, you hit a 90
Nice one
bogied the fifth hole
'm still pissed about that
Joo-Chan hit a 95
Nice work
As for Seung Kim
You hit 453
Seung glowers at Carl
(cont'd) And as for me,  hit
(doing some computations) 503
Yes
Seung Kim pumps his fist
'm sorry to say that team Korean Bank International has won
Seung Kim slaps five with his compatriots
- Carl, Chris and the Koreans are all hanging out
Carl is alone in the corner of the conference hall approaches Carl
(in Korean) [You are quite the golfer
] (in Korean) [ golf from crotch noodle
] Beat
She laughs
He laughs along with her
(in Korean) [ have a business proposition for you
My marriage is not a happy one
often find my needs are left unsatisfied
] 99
(in Korean) [ agree
The weather is sunny
] (in Korean) [ wish that was so
] (in English) Kiss me
Please
Carl doesn't know what to do
() Yes
She kisses him passionately
Carl breaks away from the kiss
Am  not sexy
Have you not heard of saving face
You're very sexy
Carl and the Korean Banker kiss more
Carl looks guilty
Carl's shaking hands with the Korean Bank Representatives
Chris shakes Carl's hand
'm promoting you to bank manager
(pulling Carl close) 've got my eye on you, boy
Don't you forget it
Chris laughs
Carl nervously laughs along with him
The Pretty Korean Banker walks by and waves at him
Carl waves back
He looks very guilty
Carl walks into the pottery studio, looking guilty
Renee is making a giant piece of pottery
What's up, chicken butt
(off his guilty look) () 100
(cont'd) Are you
Did everything go at golf
Carl considers whether he should say anything about the kiss
just got promoted to bank manager
Congratulations
Renee kisses Carl
(cont'd) Oooh, we should do some sexy pottery
Like you can rub the clay all over me
Carl goes to grab some clay
was kidding
Not as sexy as it seems
It gets in like everywhere
(awkward beat) What should we do to celebrate
Have dinner
How about Korean
Oh, no, you probably already had some today
() No, we just had American food, American fare
You've just been so busy -- it'd be fun to have a night just the two of us
wish we could just go to the airport and hop on the first flight outta here
Carl's eyes light up
Yes
101
- Renee and Carl are in line at the ticketing counter
(with an English accent) think we're going to London
(with a Spanish accent) Oaxaca, senorita
(with a Russian accent) Moscow, Russia, comrade
(with an unidentifiable ) Singapore
What was that
My Singaporean accent
Pretty good, right
They get to the front of the line
(cont'd) () We want two tickets on the next plane out of here
Two tickets to
Lincoln, Nebraska
Have a good time
Carl and Renee take the tickets
(acting positive) Lincoln, Nebraska
Here we come, baby
That'll be twelve hundred and thirty three dollars
Maybe we shouldn't do this
102
've been promoted
've got money to burn
Carl nervously hands the Airline Rep his credit card
- Carl's walking towards security when he runs into , the homosexual guy he hooked up with
Tony's handing out his books
Do you want to change your life through Mahayana Buddhism
Carl takes one of the books
(cont'd) Carl
Carl realizes who he is
Suddenly they are in the middle of an awkward ex-lover interaction
Tony
How've you been
You
never called
'm sorry
've been busy
Yeah, well, 've been busy too
Renee comes up and grabs Carl's arm
Hey, who's your friend
Tony looks at Renee and realizes that she's Carl's girlfriend
(cont'd) 'm Renee
'm Tony
'm an old, close friend of Carl's
103
Flight 2036 to Lincoln, Nebraska, now boarding
That's our flight
We should probably get going
It was nice meeting you
See you soon
(dripping with bitterness) Have fun
You abigail
Carl and Renee head off
Renee and Carl have the aisle and window on the plane comes up to Carl
Hi, there
Would you mind switching places with me
want to be across the aisle from my mom
Her  is indeed across from Carl
We're actually flying together
It would really mean a great deal
She's very scared of flying
Where's your seat
The   points at her seat
It's a couple rows up in the middle
Her middle seat's  by a  with a and an
(cont'd) This is an aisle
That's a middle
Renee looks at Carl like, why won't you just refuse
104
'm really scared of flying
Carl between the crying baby and the
Renee turns and waves to him from a couple rows up
Carl puts on a saccharin smile and waves back
- Carl and Renee are in the airport
So, now that we're here, what should we do
Well, clearly we should go there
Carl points to an advertisement for a telephone museum: "Come to the Frank
Woods Telephone Pioneer Museum
" Carl and Renee are looking at It's incredibly quiet
had no idea that the earliest switchboard operator headsets weighed ten and a half pounds
That is fascinating
It is
Not at all
Renee laughs
An    dressed as a telephone operator approaches
(in character) 'll connect you to the coast in an instant with Alexander Graham Bell's brand new invention -- the telephone
Just a haypenny per ten minutes
(out of character) () 105
(cont'd) This place is boring as shit
Check out the Lester
Larsen Tractor Test & Power Museum
Now that's an attraction
Ask for Billy
She hands Carl a brochure
Carl and Renee stand outside
We don't have to do this
We're here
We might as well
- Carl and Renee
Renee's taking photos as they / The driver
They're suddenly going crazy fast
Carl takes the wheel
The tractor They   and The  kills the engine
Renee, Carl and the Driver catch their breath
There's, uhh, no power steering
It's a tractor, not a Toyota
'm sorry about the barn
106
Been meaning to tear this sucker down anyway
Carl and Renee walk around a surprisingly pretty city park
think  might have whiplash from that tractor ride
Just don't sue me
Watch your back, Carl
mean it
'm very litigious
This day has been so randomly incredible
Would you
want to
travel around the world with me
() mean,  know we haven't really been seeing each other for that long, but  don't know
Yes
Yes
Definitely
think 'm falling, you know
Are you
Yes
They kiss
Before our flight, what do you say we grab a couple Nebraskan steaks
107
'm definitely falling for you

An comes up to him
Excuse me
Would you mind bringing this to my son
The Old Woman hands Carl an , -
Like you want me to bring it with me
On the plane
Fedex is so expensive and this needs to get to him today
(very nervous) Yeah
Sure
'd be happy to
He's a tall, blond fellow named Sheldon Winkleton
He'll be holding a sign in the terminal with his name on it
You are a dear
The Old Woman shuffles off
Carl looks at the box
Renee returns
got  Weekly, Star and, for a little culture, the National Enquirer
National Enquirer
They have movie reviews
What's in the package
Just a gift for some buddies back home
108
- Carl walks through security
He puts the package on the conveyor belt
They don't notice anything odd
Carl and Renee sit next to each other on the plane
'm sorry,  have to go to the bathroom
Renee heads to the bathroom
Carl takes the package out from under the seat in front of him
He starts to breathe really hard
He very gingerly opens the package
He pulls back the packing peanuts revealing
a box of homemade chocolates
Carl breathes a
Carl and Renee walk off the plane, Carl carrying the package under his arm
Carl sees a tall blond guy holding a sign that says "
" He heads towards the guy but before he can several   with , surround Carl
The dogs start
Put the package down
Put it down
Carl looks up to see "Sheldon" of the airport
(cont'd) Get on the ground
Both of you
The    the box open
Chocolates spill out over the ground
They crack open the chocolates to reveal What the hell is that
don't know
As Carl is dragged out by the cops, he passes Tony, standing near the exit, shaking his head
109
- Carl's sitting across from two  Agents, Good Cop Bob and Bad Cop Bob
'm Bob
And 'm Bob
Carl can't help but laugh
(cont'd) Do you find that funny
Carl sees his hand with "Yes" on it
Yes
'm sorry
Just let the girl go
She doesn't know anything
We'll see about that, Carl
Some old lady gave me a package in the Lincoln airport to deliver to her son, Sheldon Winkleton
That was really stupid of me and realize that now
don't know anything about anything
Just answer a few questions and 'm sure we'll get this all sorted out
Have you ever used illegal drugs
Carl stares at them
He should probably lie
Yes
Pot
Yes
But that's all
How about shrooms
110
Carl nods
But that's the only bad shit 've done
swear
Never cheated on a girlfriend
() Yes,  have
But  was in high school
was a mess
She had cheated on me -- The Bad Cop  his fist down on the table
You disgust me
The Good Cop restrains the Bad Cop
- The two cops  Carl
We see Carl freaking out through the one-way mirror behind them as they talk
He's a moron
But  think he's telling the truth
agree
No one ever admits to the cheating question
Carl's sitting on the steps
Renee comes out of the station
What the hell happened
can explain
So explain
Are you a drug smuggler
111
Look, when the nice lady asked me to take them on the plane, thought they were chocolates
You expect me to believe a nice lady asked you to bring chocolates on a plane
know how it sounds
don't think you do
Carl just looks at her
(cont'd) If you can't be honest with me, then you and the nice lady can have a fun life in Candyland
Renee starts off
Wait
'll explain better
She turns back around
Carl sits across from Renee
So you've just been saying yes to everything
Yes
() Pardon the pun
Oh
See
Do you get it now
It's nothing, just a glitch really
112
thought we had so much in common but if you just yes to everything don't know that we do
How do know if you even like Korean food
Beat
don't
Do you even want to travel around the world at all or do you want to work at that bank and buy a lot of Prada suits
() Yes
And yes
Something registers in Renee
When  asked if you were falling for me all you said was yes
She rises, shaking her head, and heads for the door
It wasn't a lie
Yes
It was
Carl's strapped to a giant plasma donation machine
It's horrifying
As he donates plasma, he could not look more depressed
It'll be over soon
don't care
Just take it all
Carl stumbles into the lounge outside Chris's office
113
Chris will be with you in a moment
Would you like something to drink
'  - Carl walks into Chris's office carrying a cup of coffee a Diet Coke, and a bottle of water
So  got a call from the police department
'm not a drug dealer -- Chris closes the door to his office
spent a couple years in prison myself
So  backdated some stock options
Excuse me for trying to help our bottom line, right
You got to do what you got to do to help Mr
And Mrs
Shareholder
We are their slaves
Totally
Honestly,  prefer for all my top guys to have been in the Big House
We've all eaten the slop
There's a trust there you can't break
Chris holds out his hand
(cont'd) So, what do you say to being a and expanding your microloan program bankwide
() Yes
Carl shakes Chris's hand
114
' Carl's office has  of other corporate parks
Despite the fancy digs, Carl's depressed
Chris pokes his head in
Carl's on the phone
(on the phone) That's right, we're dropping the minimum loan to one dollar, bank- wide
Could you look through these numbers and let me know which of our five branches have been lagging behind in profit
Chris dumps a folder on Carl's desk
thought  was just implementing the microloan program
You're a , buddy
You do it all now
Carl's taking a pottery lesson
He is sadly going through the motions of making a pot
He checks his watch and departs, leaving the unfinished pot spinning on the pottery wheel
The VPs are sitting around the board room
Carl comes in, late, still covered in clay
Sorry about that
Carl, 'm glad you could join us
So, to keep you all updated, we should be merging with Korean Bank International within the year
Everyone claps
115
(cont'd) As per our argument with , we'll be shoring up our bottom line
Carl Kendall's done us the honor of drawing up a preliminary list of the branches that are on the chopping block
Nice work, Carl
Carl looks horrified
' Carl's in the middle of a heated discussion with Chris
You can't close the Maple Branch
know that Maple's where you got your start, but if  don't lay those people off then  get laid off
It's a vicious cycle
You don't have to if you don't want to
(deadly serious) If we don't close these branches than  will buy our competitor instead of us and put us all out of business
If you want to be an executive and get to do fun stuff like your microloan project, then you also have to be the bad guy who lays people off
That's why we get paid the big bucks
To make the hard decisions
' Norman's crying
Rooney's getting worked up
The bank's all 've got
Every morning  restock the hard candy, polish the safe, write today's interest rates on the board
116
There are other banks
We have to protest the merger
Get some grassroots action going
Grass looks weak, but it grows everywhere
You don't even work at the bank
You should protest with us
Yeah
Protest with your employees
It will only make you more popular
Southwest Bank employees and Carl stand in a picket line outside the corporate offices
Hell no
We won't go
Hell no
We won't go
Chris gets out of his car and heads to the office
Carl hides his face from Chris so that Chris won't recognize him
Throw a rock at him
Yeah, throw a rock
Carl grabs a rock and     in Chris's direction
He then    in the opposite direction
He then   and runs into the back entrance of the bank
We  Carl as he runs up the service entrance to the corporate offices
117
' Carl then  into his office and sits down at the desk
He's covered in sweat and is breathing heavily
Chris pokes his head in
Some asshole protestor threw a rock at my head
Those dicks
wish using hoses wasn't such bad Chris leaves his office
' Carl sits across from Peter
think  made a mistake letting Renee go like that
What if 'm supposed to go on that trip
You own an apartment because of that job
People don't generally leave good jobs
But the bank doesn't feel right
Peter's phone rings
Peter picks it up
Hey, honey
think we should go with the tulips
know roses are more romantic, but they're also much more cliched
Babe, can you wait a second
(covering the phone) 'm going to be on for a while
Ask your guru
He's the one who sent you on this retarded quest in the first place
118
Sanji's
Carl gets to the front of the line
Hi, Sanji

Kendall
(no memory of Carl) Of course
Would you like to purchase my new book, "The Power of Yes: Life is Yessy"
Actually,  had a question for you
Well, this line is for book customers only
- Sanji's eating by himself
Carl comes up to him
'm sorry to bother you again -- Can't you see that 'm eating
have a really important question
have to choose between traveling around the world with a girl 'm really into or choosing a job that will make me pretty well off don't know which yes to take
How well off
don't know why that's important
should know all the data
lot,
119
This is    what  recommend
Every winter,     throw a two week long seminar    in Aspen
It's only ten grand a    week and it will open your mind up    -- don't want to go to a seminar just need help with this question
For you, eight grand a week have helped celebrities like Cher and Jack Welch
You will love it -- () You're a total con artist
am not a con artist
Have  not set you on the life path you desire
() 've put my life into the hands of a con artist
And because of you have this retarded yes branded on my hand for life
(yelling to the ) This man is a con artist
Don't listen to this man
He is a con artist
Carl runs out of the restaurant
' Carl returns home
Rooney's on the couch, wearing a headset playing Xbox Live
(into the headset) You are dead, AnalDestroyer832
Carl  the xBox cord out of the law
Out
120
What
Why
You've slept on my couch for four weeks
You're a grown man
Now sack up and get the hell out of here
Will you let me stay here please
Are you deaf
You have to say yes if  ask you
You knew

Lucy and Kath
Made out one time in the bathroom at Rudy's
Get the hell out of here
'  / Carl's in front of his computer
There are a bunch of emails selling Viagra
He angrily deletes them all
He gets a letter from the King of Nigeria
(
) Dear Carl, It is vitally important you send me your bank account information
The government will be closing in on my account in the very near future
Your good friend, Omar, Former King of Nigeria
Carl starts typing fast
As Carl writes the following email, we cuts of him and 121
(
) Omar, Let's cut the crap
You are not a king
You're probably just a teenage con artist jerking off somewhere in Russia
Write me again and  will find you and beat your stupid lying face in
Dick
Sincerely, Carl Kendall
Carl angrily flips off his computer
'  - His alarm goes off
Carl   off
It's now
'  - Carl gets dressed
He puts on his suit and tie
His apartment is noticeably nicer than the last time we saw it
Carl drives down the street in a
He He gets out of the car and passes a guy handing out fliers
You want to pawn -- No
Carl walks into Dunkin Donuts
The Dunkin Donuts Cashier hands Carl his coffee
Would you like an -- No
Carl hands the Cashier the money

' Carl sits in his office
Lucy walks in
Hey, Luce
What're you doing all the way over here
It's been hard to reach you
've been a little swamped
Everything
Yeah
Things are great
was wondering when you want to meet with the florist
Sorry, but 'm too busy these days
Don't have time to help with the party anymore
Good luck
You're just stopping, just like that
'm not the one marrying you
Maybe you should ask him for some help
He is helping
Here  was thinking we were actual friends
Lucy leaves, upset
Carl doesn't move
- Carl, Chris and the other VPs sit around the conference table
123
(with great importance) What is the best way for us to enter the teenage credit card market
Give away a free iPod
Yes
Include one with cans of Mountain Dew Code Red
Nice
Anyone else
Carl
Have you guys thought that teenagers don't have the financial knowhow to use a credit card
That's why they're such a ripe market
Any ideas on how to pick that low hanging fruit
Include a Mastercard with every xBox
like that
like that a lot
Chris   with Carl
(cont'd) Now remember, tomorrow's our official merger ceremony with
So wear your nice suits
'm talking to you, Feldman
All the VPs laugh
Carl fake laughs along with them

He hits play on his answering machine
124
(
) (over the answering ) Hey, Carl
Peter here
Long time no see
Sorry to hear you won't be planning our engagement party
Although  guess that makes you less gay than  thought you were
We'll be watching the game at Rudy's tonight, if you're interested
Carl  the message
He   Survivor and starts to absentmindedly sort through his mail
He throws away junkmail until he gets to a postcard that catches his eye
He reads the postcard
(
) Dear Carl
know this is kind of random, but  thought  should write you
We met at that party at Norman's apartment
was the guy who hated his life and hated you
just wanted to tell you that  took your advice
quit my job and have founded a home in Botswana for elderly orangutans
've never been happier
You told me to say "yes" and it has turned out to be incredible
Thank you
Yours truly, Jason Newmark Carl   the post card
On the cover of the card is a picture an orangutan
' Carl's alarm goes off
He opens his eyes
He's  the post card up next to his alarm clock
The orangutan seems to be staring into his soul
' Carl's writing a list of names
The post card lies on the desk nearby
His secretary pops her head in
' The executives are gathering in the conference room to officially greet the  Officials
() 125
'  (cont'd) (re: the post card) Cute gorilla
It's an elderly orangutan actually
(handing her the list) Could you please call everyone on this list and tell them to show up at Rudy's Bar & Grille this evening at 9PM
' Will do
Carl starts to head out and then turns around
just want to say, it was really great having you as my first secretary
' You're not firing me, are you
don't think 'm going to be working here much longer

So with this hand shake,  make official the acquisition of Southwest by Korean Bank International
Chris holds out his hand
(in Korean) [Although you have poop on your hand,  am willing to shake it so can steal all your money, you stupid Korean
] No
Excuse me
(perfect English with a British accent) We have a traitor in our midst
This man just called me a son of a dog and informed me that my hand is covered in fecal matter
He is clearly trying to sabotage the merger
You speak English
You think an international bank financier wouldn't speak fluent English
For whom do you work, traitor
Shanghai Bank
Chinatrust
For myself
Fine
Keep it secret
Unfortunately,  cannot approve a merger with a company so incompetent as to have a business saboteur this high up
Good day
