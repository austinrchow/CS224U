There's a huge traffic jam
Peter drives forward a bit at a time and he sees an old man with a walker on the sidewalk
The lane next to his is moving, so he switches lanes, only to have it stop and the lane he was on move
He switches back and then it happens again
The old man is now ahead of him

He grabs the steering wheel and shakes it in frustration
Motherf - shit - sonofa - ass

Bill drives into his special spot
(Reserved for Bill Lumbergh) He turns on the alarm for his Porsche (license plate:  ) and walks in
Peter walks in too
] Cut to inside
Peter pauses at the door and slowly reaches out to touch the metal handle
It gives him a shock and he enters
Cut to the cubicles
Peter goes into his
He picks up papers, turns on the computer and sits down
Corporate Counsels Payroll, Nina speaking
Just a moment
(repeats that over and over) Bill comes up to Peter
Hello, Peter
What's happening
Uh
we have sort of a problem here
Yeah
You apparently didn't put one of the new coversheets on your reports
Oh, yeah
'm sorry about that
,  forgot
, ' Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
've got the memo right here, but, uh, uh,  just forgot
But, uh, it's not shipping out until tomorrow, so there's no problem
Yeah
If you could just go ahead and make sure you do that from now on, that will be great
And Uh, 'll go ahead and make sure you get another copy of that memo Mmmm, Ok
He walks away
Yeah, yeah, 've got the memo, 've got - He picks it up but Bill's at another cubicle
Hello, Phil
What's happening
Peter tries to read his papers, but a loud radio (news) is bothering him
He stands up and sees it's Milton
Milton
Uh, could you turn that down just a little bit
Uh, they said  could listen to the radio at a reasonable volume from nine to eleven while 'm collating
But, no, no, no
know you're allowed to,  was just thinking, like a personal favor, y'know
,  told Bill that if Sandra's going to listen to her headphones while she' working,  can listen to the radio while 'm collating - Ok
So  don't see why - Ok
The radio,  can't - Yeah
All right
He sits down
enjoy listening to the radio at a reasonable volume from nine to eleven
Dom walks up
Hello, Peter
What's happening
(Big smile)We need to talk about your reports
Yeah
The coversheet
know,  know
Uh, Bill talked to me about it
Yeah
Uh, did you get that memo
Yeah
(holds it up)  got the memo
And  understand the policy
The problem is,  just forgot this time
And 've already taken care of it so it's not a problem anymore
Dom nods
Yeah
It's just that we're putting new coversheets on all the reports before now before they go out now
So 'd really appreciate it if you could just remember to do that
from now on
That'd be great
He walks away
Peter's phone rings and he answers it
Peter Gibbons
(listens) Yes
(listens)  have the memo
[Scene Another part of the room
Paper jams in the printer
] Oh no
Not again
Why does it say paper jam when there is no paper jam
,  swear to God, one of these days, , ,  just kick this piece of shit out the window
you and me both, man
The thing is lucky 'm not armed
Samir grabs the paper out, tearing off the bottom part of it
Piece of shit
Nina comes with papers
Sam
ire
Na
Na
Naga
Samir gets it
Uh-huh
Please
He sits in his and Michael's cubicle
Michael
- (Michael reaches for it) Bolton
That's me
Wow
Is that your real name
Yeah
So are you related to the singer guy
No, it's just a coincidence
How come no one in this country can pronounce my name right
It's Na- gee-een-ah-jah
Nagaenajar At least your name isn't Michael Bolton
Michael, there's nothing wrong with that name
There was nothing wrong with it
Until  was about nine years old and that no-talent assclown became famous and started winning Grammys
Well, why don't just go by Mike, instead of Michael
'
Peter comes up to their cubicle
What's up
Wanna go to Chotchkie's, get some coffee
It's a little early
gotta get out of here
think 'm gonna lose it
Uh oh
Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mondays
[Scene Chotchkie's
They're sitting at a booth thing
] Boy
tell ya, one of these days
One of these days it's gonna be like He mimics a machine gun
Brian, a waiter, does it too, in Peter's face
() ,  ,
Just coffee
Oh
Sounds like a case of the Mondays
He goes to take some more orders
What if we're still doing this when we're 50
It could be nice to have that kind of job security
Lumbergh's gonna have me work on Saturday, ,  can tell already
'm doing it because, because, uh, 'm a big pussy
Which is why  work at Initech to begin with
Uh,  work at Initech and  don't consider myself a pussy, ok
Yes,  am also not a pussy
'm gonna find out the hard way that 'm not a pussy if they don't start treating us software people better
That's right
They don't understand
could come up with a program that could rip that place off big time
big time
Yeah
Cut to Joanna, a pretty waitress
Cut back to the guys
Oh, there she is
Peter, you, you always talk about this girl
If you're so obsessed with her, why don't you just ask her out
Because 'm just another asshole customer
You can't just walk up to a waitress and ask her out
(cut to Joanna, and back to them) Plus, 'm still trying to work it out with Anne
Oh, that reminds me
'm not going to be able to play poker with you guys on Friday
Why not
Uh,  have to see this occupational hypnotherapist with Anne
Dude
An occupational hypnotherapist
Anne wants me to go
She thinks it might help
'know, sometimes  just think,  keep thinking that she's cheating on me
Yeah
know what you mean
Yeah
What is that supposed to mean
Nothing
Why don't you just tell Anne you're not into hypnosis and you want to play poker with us
Ah,  can't do that
She might get all pissed off at me
Besides, think the guy might be able to help
He did help Anne lose weight
Peter, she's anorexic
Yeah,  know
The guy's really good
An occupational hypnotherapist isn't going to help you solve any of your problems
And speaking of problems, what's this  hear about you having problems with your  reports
Yeah
Didn't you get that memo
Peter sighs
[Scene Outside Initech
Tom, another employee, runs across the street, towards Samir, Peter and Michael
] Hey
Hey, guys
Samir
Is that Tom Smykowski
What's he doing
Oh, probably working on another heart attack
Have you guys see this
He hands them a piece of paper
What
It's the staff meeting
So what
We're all screwed, that's what
They're gonna downsize Initech
Oh, what are you talking about Tom
How do you know that
They're bringing in a consultant - that's how  know
That's what this staff meeting is all about
That's what happened at Initrode last year
You have an interview with a consultant and they bring in efficiency experts
You're interviewing for your own job
Tom, every week you say you're losing your job and you're still here
'm going to be the first one they're gonna lay off
Just the thought of having to go to the State Unemployment Office and having to stand in line with those scumbags
[Scene Michael and Samir's cubicle
They're sitting there worrying
] Shit
Shit
You know there are people in this world who don't have to put up with all this shit
Like that guy that invented the pet rock
You see, that's what you have to do
You have to use your mind and come up with some really great idea like that and you never have to work again
don't think the pet rock was really such a good idea
The guy made a million dollars
'know
had an idea like that once
Really
What was it, Tom
Well, all right
It was a Jump
to Conclusions-mat
You see, it would be this mat that you would put on the floor and it would have different conclusions written on it that you could
jump to
That is the worse idea 've ever heard in my life, Tom
Yes, yes, it's horrible
this idea
Ah, look
,  gotta get outta here
'll see you guys later, if still have a job
He goes to his cubicle
Our high school guidance counselor used to ask us what you would do if we had a million dollars and didn't have to work
And invariably, whatever we would say, that was supposed to be our careers
If you wanted to build cars, then you're supposed to be an auto mechanic
So what did you say
never had an answer
guess that's why 'm working at Initech
No, you're working at Initech because that question is bullshit to begin with
(The printer is not working) If that quiz worked, there would be no janitors, because no one would clean shit up if they had a million dollars
Well,  would invest half of it in
Mutual Funds and give the rest of it to my friend, Saheib, in Securities
Samir, the point of the exercise is that you could figure out what you want to do
And then
(reads the printer's display) " load letter"
What the fuck does that mean
He knocks off the paper tray
[Scene Peter's apartment
He enters, tired, and sits down on the couch
He then turns on the
] (/,   ) -
' Lawrence, can't you just pretend like we can't hear each other through the wall
Oh
'm sorry man, is Anne over there or something
No
But if you just want to talk to me, just come over
Lawrence does so; it takes him like ten seconds
Hey man
Check this out, dude
He changes channels a bunch of times Pepsi commercial, a soap opera and another show
He stops on breast exam
Oh geez, Lawrence
'm sorry, man
thought you'd wanna see this
Doesn't this chick look like Anne
Yeah, a little bit
Hey, she hasn't been over here in a while
You two still going out
guess, yeah
,  don't know
Sometimes  get the feeling that she's cheating on me
Yeah,  get that feeling too, man
What do you mean by that
don't know , man,  just get that feeling looking at her, like - 'm sorry, man
Look, , , , , , 'm talking out of my ass
don't know
He gets up
It's ok
just had a rough day
Tell me about it, man
(sits on the couch) gotta wake my ass up at six  every day of this week and drag myself up to Vascalinas
Yeah, 'm doing the drywall up there at the new McDonalds
Let me ask you something
When you come in on Mondays, and you're not feeling too well, does anybody ever come up to you and say "sounds like someone's got a case of the Mondays"
No
No, man, shit, no, man
believe you get your ass kicked for sayin' something like that, man
Huh
We still going fishing this weekend
Nah
Lumbergh's gonna make me come in this Saturday
know it
Well, you can get out of that easily
Yeah, how
(Gets up) Well, when you work on an Saturday, he generally asks you at the end of the day, right
(gets a beer) So all you have to do is avoid him (peter offers him a bottle cap remover) That's all right, i got one (he gets on from his pocket) The last few hours of the day
And turn off your answering machine, you should be home free then
That's a really good idea
(sits on the couch) Lawrence, what would you do if you had a million dollars
He sits down
'll tell you what 'll do, man--Two chicks at the same time
Peter laughs
That's it
If you had a million dollars, that's what you'd do, two chicks at the same time
Damn straight, man
've always wanted to do that
figure if  were a millionaire,  could hook that up
Chicks dig guys with money
Well not all chicks
Well, the type that double up on a guy like me do
Good point
,
Besides two chicks at the same time
Oh yeah
Nothing
Nothing, huh
would relax,  would sit on my ass all day,  would do nothing
You don't need a million dollars to do nothing, man
Take a look at my cousin
He's broke and don't do shit
[Scene Peter's room
He's in bed and he keeps hearing voices

[Scene The staff meeting
Peter's watch reads Friday 12, 10:37
Everyone's standing outside their cubicles
There's a banner that says "Is This Good for the
"] So you should ask yourself, with every decision that you make (points to the banner) Is this good for the company
Am  helping the best way that  can for the company
Is that the guy
Yeah
Good
Well, uh, 'd like to, uh, welcome a new member to our team
Uh, Bob Slydell
Yeah
Uh, he is, uh, a consultant
Yeah
He is a consultant
(Tom shakes his head) He'll be helping us out a little here, asking some questions, making sure things go a little more smoothly
Yeah
Oh and remember, next Friday is Hawaiian shirt day
So, y'know, if you want to, go ahead and uh, wear a Hawaiian shirt and jeans
[Scene Milton's cubicle, under the banner
He's on the phone with Peter
] ,  don't care if they, if they lay me off either, because ,  told Bill that if he moves my desk one more time, then, then 'm quitting
'm going to quit
And  told Dom too because they've moved my desk four times
used to be by the window, where  could see the squirrels and they were merry
But then they switched from the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but  kept my Swingline
(he's holding his red Swingline) (Camera pans to Peter) They have my staples for the Boston and  kept the staples from the Swingline stapler
Ok, Milton
And if, if they take my stapler,  will,  will set this building on fire
Oh, that's great
will talk to you later
He hangs up and looks at his watch 4:45
Peter looks around and sees Bill
He ducks and peeks to see Bill talking with some workers
He quickly tries to save his files, but the computer is slower than he'd like
Bill is talking to other guys
Oh, come on
(it finished saving, but starts to save another file) Oh, for crying out -
He peeks over the wall again
The computer finally finished saving and he turns it off
He peeks over the wall but Bill's not there
He gets ready to leave and almost runs into Bill
Hello Peter
What's happening
Um, 'm gonna need you go ahead and come in tomorrow
So if you could be here around nine, that would be great
(starts to walk away) Oh, oh, yea
forgot
'm gonna also need you to come in Sunday too
We, uh, lost some people this week and we need to sorta catch up
Thanks
[Scene Outside the clinic

Swanson, ; Anxiety, Depression, Marriage, Weight Loss, Smoking, Insurance Cut to inside
Anne is with Peter
Opposite them are Dr
Swanson and two other patients
So 'm sitting in my cubicle today and  realized that ever since started working, every single day of my life has been worse than the day before it
So it means that every single day you see me, that's on the worse day of my life
What about today
Is today the worse day of your life
Yeah
Oh, that's bad stuff
'm sorry
Ok
But is there any way that you, you could just sock me out so there's no way that 'll know 'm at work
Right here
(points to his head) Can just come home and think 've been fishing all day or something
That's really not what  do, Peter
However, the good news is,  think can help you
want you to do something for me, Peter
(dims the lights)  want you to try and relax
want you to relax every muscle in your body, from your toes to your fingertips
Now  want you to relax your legs
You're going to begin to feel your eyelids getting heavy as you slip deeper and deeper into a state of complete relaxation
the air of concerns to you is disappearing
Deeper, way down, your concerns about your job melts away
Way, way down
Now when count backwards from three, you'll be in a state of complete relaxation
your worries, cares and ambitions will be gone
And you will remain in that state until  snap my fingers
Three
Deeper and deeper
Way down, way down

Way down

He faints out of the chair and everyone rushes to his aid
Oh my God, Dr
Swanson
Ooh
Ooh
Is he dead

She runs to get help
Peter just sits there and smiles
The hypnosis thing apparently worked
[Scene Peter's bedroom
Saturday morning, 8:00
His alarm clock beeps and he sits up
He looks at the clock and decides to go back to sleep

Just checking in case you called while  was gone
The phone rings
Peter answers it
Hello
Peter, what's going on
Huh
It's 3:30
Why aren't you at work
Because  didn't feel like it
Peter, what is wrong with you
First, you sit there while Dr
Swanson dies and you just walk out of the car and embarrass me in front of my friends
Don't blame this on hypnosis either
That's total bull

Another staff meeting
] From now on, you use the time sheets if you work on two or more job codes and you need the extra columns to fit it all in
Otherwise, use the old time sheets
Where's Peter
How come he didn't show up this weekend
,  don't know
it would really, really help us out

So, uh, any questions
[Scene Chotchkie's
Peter enters and goes up to Joanna at the counter
] Hi, 'm Peter
Hi
How can  help you
What are you doing for lunch today
Well, our specials are barbecued chicken - it's actually right over there on the board
(points) Excuse me
She goes to take orders
Hey
Look who's back
Table for three, to - Peter shoves him out of his way and goes over to Joanna
was asking what you were doing for lunch
Would you like to have lunch with me
Oh, are you serious
Yeah,  don't ,  don't think 'm supposed to do that
Oh
'll tell you what 'm gonna do
'm gonna go next door and get a table and if you'd like to join me, no big deal
All right
And if not, that's cool too
Ok
He starts to walk away
Uh, when you say "next door", do you mean Chili's or Flingers
Flingers
Ok
[Scene Initech
Bob Slydell and Bob Porter are interviewing Tom
] So what you do is you take the specifications from the customers and you bring them down to the software engineers
That, that's right
Well, then  gotta ask, then why can't the customers just take the specifications directly to the software people, huh
Well, uh, uh, uh, because, uh, engineers are not good at dealing with customers
You physically take the specs from the customer
Well, no, my, my secretary does that, or, or the fax
Ah
Then you must physically bring them to the software people
Well
no
Yeah,  mean, sometimes
Well, what would you say
you do here
Well, look,  already told you
deal with the goddamn customers so the engineers don't have to
have people skills
am good at dealing with people
Can't you understand that Cut to inside
Let's see
You're Michael
Bolton
He nods
Is that your real name
Yeah
Are you in any relation to the pop singer
It's just a coincidence

Yeah
Yeah
he, he, he's pretty, he's pretty good,  guess
You're   right he is
They laugh
So tell me
What's your favorite song of his
Hmm
, ,  don't know
mean,  guess,  sorta like 'em all
The Bobs laugh
feel the exact same way, but it must be hard for you,  mean, having the same name as him
celebrate the guy's entire catalogue
But anyway, let's get down to business, Michael
You, you know, you can just call me Mike
They stare at him
[Scene Flingers
Peter is saving a table and Joanna enters
] Hi
Hey
wonder if they will let me wear this in here
think it would be ok
Would you like to sit down
He motions to a chair
Ok

This place is really nice
Yeah, is it
Oh my God, compared to Chotchkie's
like the uniforms better anyways
like yours
Nah

The one underneath says
"We're not in Kansas anymore

Really

That's, uh, that's uh, my pieces of flair
What are pieces of flair
That's where you know, suspenders and buttons and all sorts of stuff
We're, uh, we're actually required to wear fifteen pieces of flair
quite stupid actually
Do you get to pick them out yourself
Yeah
Yeah
Although  didn't actually choose these
, uh,  just grabbed fifteen buttons and, uh,  don't even know what they say
'know,  don't really care
don't really like talking about my flair
Ok
So, where do you work, uh, Peter
Initech
And, uh, what do you do there, Peter
sit in a cubicle and  update bank software for the 2000 switch
) '
You see, they wrote all this bank software and to save space, they put 98 instead of 1998
So  go through these thousands of lines of code and uh, it doesn't really matter
, uh,  don't like my job
don't think 'm gonna go anymore
You're just not gonna go
Yeah
Won't you get fired
don't know
But  really don't like it so 'm not gonna go
)  '
No, no, not really
'm just gonna stop going
When did you decide all that
About a week ago
Really
Oh, yeah
Ok
So, so you're gonna get another job
don't think  'd like another job
)
'know,  never really liked paying bill
don't think 'll do that either
)
want to take you out for dinner and then  wanna go to my apartment and watch Kung Fu
Did you ever watch Kung Fu
Joanna gets a weird look on her face
love Kung Fu
Channel 39
Totally
You should come over and watch Kung Fu tonight
Ok
Great
Ok
Can we order lunch first
Yeah
Ok
[Scene Milton's cubicle

The guys laugh
anyway, sounds great, Bob
'll see you in a few
(they walk off) Hey, Milton, what's happening
Uh
sir
Uh, 'm going to have to ask you to move your desk
Now, if you could get it to go as far back against that wall as possible, that would be great
No, no, because  was,  was - That way, we'll have some room for more boxes and things we need to put in here
No
sir
Uh (sees the Swingline) Oh there it is
No
No
Let me just get that from ya
(picks it up) Great
So if you could get to that as soon as possible, that would be terrific
Have a nice lunch, Milton
Bye
He walks off
Ok
'll set the building on fire
[Scene Hallway at Initech
Peter enters in casual clothes
Milton walks up to him
] Peter
Michael
What the hell's going on, man
thought you were going to come in here and start shooting
just came to get my address book
'm not gonna stay
've got a number  don't wanna lose
What
Peter, you're in deep shit
You were supposed to come in on Saturday
What were you doing
Michael,  did nothing
did absolutely nothing and it was everything that  thought it could be
Well,  hope you have a better story than that for Lumbergh
You know, you're supposed to be having your interview right now with the consultants
Who
He writes down Joanna's number
What has gotten into you
Oh yeah
Right
Peter, Peter you, gotta postpone it man
Tell them you were sick
Make something up
Ah, no way
feel great
[Scene The interview room
] The next paper looks like a Peter Gibbons
Peter enters
Aha
All right
We were just talking about you
You must be Peter Gibbons
Uh huh
Terrific
'm Bob Slydell and this is my associate, Bob Porter
Hi, Bob
Bob
Why don't you grab a seat and join us for a minute
He does so
'see, what we're trying to do here, we're just trying to get a feel for how people spend their day
So, if you would, would you just walk us through a typical day for you
Yeah
Great
Well,  generally come in at least fifteen minutes late
use the side door, that way Lumbergh can't see me
Uh, and after that,  just sorta space out for about an hour
Space out
Yeah
just stare at my desk but it looks like 'm working
do that for probably another hour after lunch too
'd probably, say, in a given week,  probably do about fifteen minutes of real, actual work
Uh, Peter, would you be a good sport and indulge us and tell us a little more
Let me tell you something about  reports
' Cut to later
Peter is more relaxed
The thing is, Bob, it's not that 'm lazy
It's just that  just don't care
Don't, don't care
It's a problem of motivation, all right
Now, if  work my ass off and Initech ships a few extra units,  don't see another dime
So where's the motivation
And here's another thing, Bob
have eight different bosses right now
beg your pardon
Eight bosses
Eight
Eight, bob
So that means when  make a mistake,  have eight different people coming by to tell me about it
That's my real motivation - is not to be hassled
That and the fear of losing my job, but y'know, Bob, it will only make someone work hard enough not to get fired
Bear with me for a minute
Ok
Believe me, this is hypocritical
But what if you were offered some kind of stock option and equity sharing program
don't know
guess
Listen, 'm gonna go
It's been really nice talking to be of you guys
He shakes their hands
Absolutely
It's all on this side of the table, trust me
Good luck with your layoffs
hope your firings go really well
Wow
Cut to the cubicle's
Peter walks past them and into the hall
Hey, Peter, what's happening
Listen, uh - Peter walks right past him
[Scene Chotchkie's] Joanna
Would you come here for a moment, please
'm sorry
was late
was having lunch
need to talk about your flair
Really
have 15 buttons on
, uh, (shows him Well, ok, 15 is minimum, ok
Ok
Now, it's up to you whether or not you want to just do the bare minimum
Well, like Brian, for example, has 37 pieces of flair
And a terrific smile
Ok
Ok, you want me to wear more
Look
Joanna
Yeah
People can get a cheeseburger anywhere, ok
They come to Chotchkie's for the atmosphere and the attitude
That's what the flair's about
It's about fun
Ok
So, more then
Look, we want you to express yourself, ok
If you think the bare minimum is enough, then ok
But some people choose to wear more and we encourage that, ok
You do want to express yourself, don't you
Yeah
Yeah
Great
Great
That's all  ask
Ok
[Scene Conference room
Dom and Bill are talking to the two Bob's
] Right
So there's three more people we can easily lose
There's Tom Smykowski
He's useless
Gone
Sounds good to me
Here's a peculiar one
Milton Waddams
Who's he
You know, squirrely looking guy, mumbles a lot
Oh
We can't find a record of him being a current employee here
looked into it more deeply and  found what happened was he got layed off about five years ago and no one ever told him about it
But through a glitch in Payroll, he still gets a paycheck
went ahead and fixed the glitch
Great
So, um, Milton has been let go
Just a second there, Professor
We, uh, we fixed the glitch
So he won't be receiving a paycheck anymore
So it'll just work itself out naturally
We always like to avoid confrontation whenever possible
The problem is solved from here on, then
They laugh
Uh, we should move on to a Peter Gibbons
had a chance to meet this young man and boy does he have Straight to Upper Management written all over him
Ooh, uh, yeah
'm going to have to go ahead and sort of disagree with you there
Yeah
Uh, he's been real flaky lately and 'm not sure that he's the caliber person you want for upper management
He's been having some problems with his  reports
'll handle this
We feel that the problem isn't with Peter
Um-um
It's that you haven't challenged him enough to get him really motivated
There it is
Yeah, 'm not sure about that now
All right, Bill
Let me ask you this
How much time each week would you say you deal with these  reports
Yeah
[Scene Peter parks in Bill's usual spot and goes into the building
He takes a drill and removes the metal door handle
] Cut to outside, where Bill has to park in the handicap spot
Cut back inside
Peter tears down the banner
Cut to outside
Bill's Porsche is being towed away
They only manage to pull off the bumper
Cut to Peter and Joanna watching Kung Fu
They're about to kiss
Hey Peter man
Check out channel nine
It's a breast exam
Whoo
Cut to Peter's cubicle
Bill checks his watch because Peter's still not there
Cut to a lake
Lawrence, Peter and Joanna are fishing
Peter holds up a big fish
Cut to Initech
Peter enters with an Igloo cooler
Hello, Peter
Hey Dom
He slaps him on the back
Cut to Peter's cubicle
He puts the fish on his desk and starts to gut it
He throws its entrails on a stack of  reports
Cut to Peter and Joanna watching Kung Fu
Cut to Peter removing the screws in the cubicle wall
He pushes it over
It reveals a window and Peter relaxes
[Scene Peter's cubicle, now with only one wall
he's playing Tetris as Bill walks up
] So, Peter, what's happening
Now are you going to go ahead and have those  reports for us this afternoon
(Peter keeps playing) Uh, yeah
So  guess we should probably go ahead and have a little talk, hmm
Not right now, Lumbergh
'm, 'm kinda busy
In fact, 'm going to have to ask you to go ahead and just come back another time
have a meeting with the Bobs in a couple of minutes
Uh,  wasn't aware of a meeting with them
Yeah, they called me at home
That sounds good, Peter
Uh, and we'll go ahead and, uh, get this all fixed up for you later
[Scene Milton's cubicle
He's organizing papers
] Hi, Milton
What's going on
, , , ,  didn't receive my paycheck this week
Uh, you're gonna have to talk to Payroll about that
,  did and they, and they said - Uh, we're gonna need to move your desk downstairs into Storage
No
Uh, we have some new people coming in and we need all the space we can get
No
no
no
no
but
but
but
, ,  - And if you could could go ahead and get a can of psticide and take care of the roach problem we've been having that would be great
(He walks away
can't
Excuse me
believe you have my stapler
[Scene The meeting between Peter and the two Bobs
] It looks like you've been missing a lot of work lately
wouldn't say 've been missing it, Bob
They laugh
That's terrific, Peter
,, 'm sure you've, you've, you've heard some of the rumors around the hallway about how we're just going to do a little (finger quotes) housecleaning with some of the software people
Well, Bob,  have heard that and you gotta do what you gotta do
Well, these people here
First, Mr
Samir Naga
Naga
Naga
Naga-worker here anyway
The Bobs laugh
Mr
Mike Bolton
We're certainly gonna miss him
You're gonna layoff Samir and Michael
We're gonna bring in some entry level graduates for us to work in Singapore, that's the usual deal
Well, it's standard operating procedure
Do they know about this yet
No
No, of course not
We always find it's better to fire people on a Friday
It's statistically shown that there's less chance of an incident if we do it at the end of the week
Anyway, Peter, what we would like to do is put you into a position where you would have as many as four people working right underneath you
This is a big promotion, Pete
Huge
So you're gonna fire Samir and Michael and give me more money
Umm-hmm
Wow
[Scene Michael is messing with the printer
] Yeah
Yeah
That's it
That's exactly what  need
Just give it to me
Come on
Come on, you little fucker
Let's go
That's what  need
Let's do that
Let's do exactly that, you little, fu- Peter walks up to him
Listen
Well, what are you doing tonight
[Scene Peter's place
Michael, Samir and Peter are there
] There comes a place in a man's life and, uh, maybe that time for you is now, when it doesn't hurt to think about the future
Uh, no offense, there, Peter, but think about yourself, sport
You're the one who's been flaking out at work
Whatever that religious experience or whatever the hell it was, you better snap out of it, or you're gonna get canned
Yeah
, ,
Listen, that virus you're always talking about
The one that, that could rip off the company for a bunch of money
Yeah
What about it
Well, how does it work
It's pretty brilliant
What it does is where there's a bank transaction, and the interests are computed in the thousands a day in fractions of a cent, which it usually rounds off
What this does is it takes those remainders and puts it into your account
This sounds familiar
Yeah
They did this in Superman
Yeah
What a good movie
bunch of hackers did this in the 70s and one of them got busted
Well, so they check for this now
No, you see, Initech's so backed up with all the software we're updating for the year 2000, they'd never notice
You're right
And even if they wanted to, they could never check all that code
It's numbers up their asses
So, Michael, what's to keep you from doing this
It's not worth the risk
got a good job
What if you didn't have a good job
[Scene  bar
Michael and Peter are there
] Cockos
Samir and  are the best programmers in that place
And you, you haven't even been showing up and you get to keep your job
Actually, 'm being promoted
What
Yeah,  know, Michael
It's completely unfair
And  realized something today
It's not about me and my dream of doing nothing
It's about all of us together
don't know what happened at that hypnotherapist the other day; maybe it was just shock
It's wearing off now, but when saw that fat man keel over and die, Michael,  realized that we don't have a lot of time on this earth
We weren't meant to spend it this way
Human beings weren't meant to sit in little cubicles, starring at computer screens all day, filling out useless forms and listening to eight different bosses drone on about mission statements
told those fudge-packers that  like Michael Bolton's music
God
that is not right, Michael
For five years now, you've worked your ass off at Initech, hoping for a promotion or some kind of profit sharing or something
Five years of your mid-20s now, gone
And you're gonna go in tomorrow and they're gonna throw you out into the street
You know why
So Bill Lumbergh's stock will go up a quarter of a point
Michael, let's make that stock go down
Let's take enough money from that place that we never ever have to sit in a cubicle ever again
Your software works right
Of course it works
That's not the point
Look, even if it could work, don't know how to install it
don't know the credit union software loan
Yeah
But Samir does
[Scene Peter's apartment
Samir's there, along with Michael and Peter
] But that's not much money,  - That's the beauty of it
Each withdrawal is a fraction of a cent
That's too small to notice
Take a thousand withdrawals a day, space it out over a few years, that's a couple hundred thousand dollars
Just like Superman
Superman  - that's it,  have to leave now, ok
(gets up)  have to get my resume ready
Get your resume ready for what
Another job where they can fire you for no reason
That's right
If 'm lucky
Look,  don't know about you guys, but 'm tired of being pushed around
Aren't you
Yes, Peter, but 'm not going to do something illegal
Illegal
Samir, this is America
Come on, sit down
Come on
This isn't Riyadh
They're not gonna saw your hands off, all right
The worse they can do is put you for a couple of months into a while collar, minimum security resort
Shit, we should be so lucky
Did you know they have conjugal visits there
Really
Yes
Shit, 'm afraid
haven't had a conjugal visit in six months
So what do you think
This thing actually is pretty fail-safe, Samir
You came here looking for a land of opportunity
And this is the knock of that opportunity
Tomorrow's your last day at Initech
You have two options unemployment or early retirement
What's it gonna be
have a question
Yes
In, in these conjugal visits, you can have sex with women
Yep
You sure can
Ok
'm gonna do it
That's what 'm talking about
'm talking about America
Peter Let's discuss the plan, all right
All right
All right
It works like a computer virus
All right
So all we have to do is load it anywhere into the credit union mainframe and it'll do the rest
Ok, you guys give me that disk and 'll take it from there
Oh, but listen
Before we go any further, all right, we have to swear to God, Allah, that nobody knows about this, all right
No family members, no girlfriends, nobody
Of course
Agreed
Don't worry man
won't tell anybody about this either
Who the fuck is that
Uh, don't worry about him
He's cool
All right
Now here's how  see it all going down
[Scene Initech
Peter shakes the Bobs' hands
] Peter, congratulations
This is one heck of a promotion
And we'll go ahead and get some people under you right away
(They give a thumbs up
[Scene Samir and Michael's cubicle
They look at each other
Michael copies the virus and looks around
He gives it to Samir
Samir walks by Peter and gives it to him
He puts it into his computer and copies the file
He goes to Samir and Michael's cubicle
] Well, that was easy
Yeah,  guess it was
What did you do with the - Hey guys
Oh, hey Drew
did you guys hear about Tom Smykowski
The guy who got laid off
No, man, check this out
[Flashback
Tom's getting drunk in his kitchen
] /)  ,         , Cut to Tom in his car
/)
/) )
'
, '
, ,  ,
Are you ok, Tom
Yeah
/)  ,  '   ,
'm ok
Right
It seems to be working now
See ya later, honey
Love ya
He backs out
/)         , ' We hear a bang from behind the closing garage door
Cut back to Initech, present
Well, is he ok
Sort of
He broke both his wrists, his legs, a couple of ribs, his back
But check it out
He's gonna get a huge settlement out of this
Like seven figures
He's getting out of the hospital this weekend and he's throwing a big party to celebrate
'm thinking 'm gonna take that new chick from Logistics
might be showing her my  face
Oh
Oh
Oh
you know what 'm talking about
Oh
Yeah
Right
See you guys there
[Scene Peter's car
Samir and Michael are with him
] Wow, our last day at Initech
can't believe they had security escort us out
Not like we're gonna steal something
stole something
Oh yeah
guess we all did
No,  stole something else
What did you steal
We'll call it a going away present
[Scene  field
They drop the printer
Samir stomps on it four times and Michael, eight times
Peter hands Samir a bat
He hits the printer twice and Michael takes over
He starts to punch it
Samir and Peter pull him away, but he runs back to destroy the evil printer
] Cut to Peter's place
Samir's trying to break dance
[Scene Outside Peter's place
] Everything is going to be ok
Ok
The one  see is - can see this working
gotta go
gotta go
Joanna's coming over
Don't worry
You're worrying
All right
Monday morning we're gonna check the account balance and everything will be all right
Don't miss Tom's barbecue
'll see you there
Peter goes inside
)
[Scene Peter's place, morning
Joanna sees all the empty liquor bottles
] Hey, what were you guys celebrating last night
Um, 'm not really at liberty to talk about it
really can't
[Scene Peter's car
He and Joanna are going to the barbecue
] So when the subroutine compounds the interest, right, it uses all these extra decimals places that just get rounded off
So we just simplify the whole thing and we just round it down and drop the remainder into an account that we own
So you're stealing
Ah, no
No
You don't understand
It's, uh, very complicated
It's, uh, it's, it's aggregate so 'm talking about fractions of a cent that, uh, over time, they add up to a lot
Ok
So you're gonna make a lot of money, right
Yeah
Ok
That's not yours
Well, it, it becomes ours
How's that not stealing
don't think,  don't think 'm explaining this very well
Um, this Seven Eleven, right
If you take a penny from the tray - From the crippled children
No, that's the tray
'm talking about the tray
The penny's for everybody
Oh, for everybody
Ok
Yeah, well, those are whole pennies
Yeah
Right
'm just talking about fractions of a penny here, but we do it from a much bigger tray
couple of million times
So what's wrong with that
It seems wrong
It's not wrong
Initech is wrong
Initech is an evil corporation, all right
Chotchkie's is wrong
Doesn't it bother you that you have to get up in the morning and put on pieces of flair
Yeah, but 'm not about to go in and start taking money from the register
You know, the Nazis had pieces of flair but they made the Jews wear them
What
Look, we don't - ,  - we don't have to talk about this
Let's just go to the barbecue, all right
Ok
[Scene Tom's house
Samir and Michael open the front door
tom is in a full body cast and is hooked up to a bunch of stuff
] Michael
Samir
How are you doing
Hiya Tom
Hi Tom
Yeah, 'd like you to meet my lawyer, Rob Newhouse
(they shake hands) Rob, Michael
Hello Michael
Samir
Hello - Samir
Samir
(Peter and Joanna enter
Peter
How are ya
'm glad you could make it
Tom
Hi
This is someone 'd like you to meet
This is Joanna
Hi
Hi
Forgive me for not getting up
(He starts laughing and everyone joins in nervously) Ooh
Ooh
Uh, Peter, Peter, come here a minute
want to show you something
They go into the kitchen
There's a Jump to Conclusions mat
It says ; Jump Again ; Strike Out ; Could be ; Loose one Turn ; Yes
; No
; Accept it ; Go wild ; One step back ; Think Again ; Moot
On the bottom are footprints, under the word Start Well, what do you think
It's a prototype
Well, that's exactly as you described it
Uh, listen, ,  heard about your settlement
Congratulations
Well, thanks, Peter
y'know, 'm glad you're here because  wanted to talk to you
know how you get depressed about your job and all, and just wanted you to know that's how you feel
used to be the same way
Really
Sure
Oh maybe  didn't whine as much, but  hated my job as much as you and 've been doing good for over thirty years
Wow
Just remember If you hang in there long enough, good things can happen
mean, look at me
He laughs
Thanks Tom
Aw, sure
[Scene The backyard
Samir and Michael are talking to Rob
] Conjugal visits
Not that  know of
Now, a minimum security prison is no picnic
have a client in there right now
You see, the trick is, kick someone's ass the first day or become someone's bitch
Then everything will be all right
Why do you ask, anyway
Oh, no, we were just seeing - His cup flies out of his hand and ice cubes go everywhere
Cut to Peter and Drew
Hey Peter
Drew
That's something about old Tom Smykowski, huh
Yeah
Lucky bastard
(sees Joanna) Hey, isn't that the girl who works over at Chotchkie's
Yeah
Hmm, who's she here with
She's here with me
Really
Yeah
All right, Peter
Ooh
Ooh
Right on
Make sure you wear a rubber, dude
Why's that, Drew
Are you kidding me
She gets around, all right
She does, does she
Oh yeah
Like a record
Joanna waves
With who
Well, let's see
Lumbergh fucked her
Ah, let me see who else
Lumbergh
[Scene Peter's car
He and Joanna are leaving the party
] Oh, what if you get caught
Oh, , , ,  just don't know if this is such a good idea
)
,   ' What
What are you - Oh
All right, Lumbergh
Peter
What is wrong with you
That was like to years ago
What, do you know him
Yeah,  know him
know him
He's my boss
He's my unholy, disgusting, pig of a boss
Oh, he's not that disgusting
He represents all that is solace and wrong
And you slept with him
That is none of your business, ok
didn't ask you who you slept with before we were together
don't care
Well,  didn't think you would sleep with a guy like Lumbergh
Listen to you
Who do you think you are
How dare you judge
Do you think you're an angel or something
No
You're this petty, stealing, wannabe criminal
man
Well,  may be
But at least  never slept with Lumbergh
Ok
That's it
'm done
want to get out of the car
Stop
wanna get - Fine
He stops and Joanna gets out
Why don't you call me when you grow up
Oh, wait, that's probably never gonna happen so just don't call me, all right
Say hello to Lumbergh for me
She slams the door and he drives off
[Scene Peter's room
He's having nightmares again
] Lumbergh fucked her
Lumbergh fucked her
Lumbergh fucked her
Oh that's great
great
'm gonna see the -face again
Oh
Oh
Oh
Ooh
Ooh
That dissolves into Bill, naked, holding a foot in one hand a cup of coffee in the other
Why don't you move it a little to the left
That's right
Great
Oh, hello, Peter
What's happening
Uh, could you give me those  reports Mmmkay
Peter wakes up and breathes deeply
[Scene Chotchkie's
Stan approaches Joanna
] Joanna
Yeah
We need to talk
Do you know what this is about
My, uh, flair
Yeah
Or, uh, your lack thereof
'm counting and  only see fifteen pieces
Let me ask you a question, Joanna
Umm-hmm
What do you think of a person who only does the bare minimum
Huh
What do  think
Let me tell you what  think, Stan
If you want me to wear thirty-seven pieces of flair like your pretty boy Brian over there, then why don't you just make the minimum thirty-seven pieces of flair
Well,  thought  remember you saying you wanted to express yourself
Yeah
Yeah
'know what
do
do want to express myself
Ok
And don't need thirty-seven pieces of flair to do it
(gives him the finger) All right
There's my flair
And this is me expressing myself
(holds up her hand) There it is
hate this job
hate this goddamn job and  don't need it
She storms out
[Scene An  machine
Peter gets out a receipt that says he has $305,326
13] [Scene Peter's car
Samir and Michael have obviously seen the receipt
] Shit, shit, shit, shit
Son of a bitch
Shit
This is a - fuck
Son of a bitch
Shit
What happened
You tell me, Michael, it's your software
Yes, it's your software
Corporate accounting is sure as hell going to notice 305, 3 (grabs the receipt) 26
13
Michael
Oh shit
They, they probably won't notice it's gone for another two or three days
Michael
Michael
You said the thing was gonna take two years
What happened
You said the thing was supposed to work
Well, technically it did work
No it didn't
It did not work, Michael, ok
Ok
Ok
Ok
Ok
Ok
must have,  must have put a decimal point in the wrong place or something
Shit
always do that
always mess up some mundane detail
Oh
What is this fairly mundane detail, Michael
Ok quit getting pissed at me, all right
This was all your idea, asshole
All right
Ok
All right
Let's try not to get pissed off at each other, all right
We'll figure this thing out together, ok
And the first thing we gotta do is we gotta close that account down before it gets any bigger
[Scene Initech
It's Bill's 41st birthday
All the employees are singing the birthday song to him in a flat monotone
He blows out the candles and everyone claps
] Mmm
You look terrific
(etc All right, Kate, you wanna get everybody started there
(he gets a slice of cake) Mmm
That is terrific
That is just terrific
really, really appreciate it
slice is handed to Milton
Milton, don't be greedy
Let's pass it along and make sure everyone gets a piece
Can  keep a piece
Because last time  was told that - Just pass
He does so
But this, this, it, it, it's a little cake
Everyone gets a piece and Nina gets the last one
Milton has to watch everyone enjoy their piece
[Scene Peter's apartment
They're trying to figure out what to do
] Is, is there a way to just give the money back
What
We just hand them a check with the exact amount they're missing
,  think they'd figure that out
Well, we have to do something
May-maybe we launder the money
That's a great idea
Ok, how do we do that
don't know,  don't know
don't even know what it means
It's something  think,  think coke dealers do
Ok
Do we know any coke dealers
My, my cousin's a cokehead
We're in deep shit
Yes
We are in very, very deep shit
[Scene Milton's new "office" - the basement
Bill enters with a piece of cake
] Milton
Yes
What's happening
wanted to see you because - Say, you know what would be a great idea
No
no
Since you're already down here, it would be great if you could get a ca of pesticipe and take care of the cockroach problem we've been having in here
that's really not my job and  haven't received my - For now, why don't you get a flashlight and a can of pesticide and - Dom enters
Bill
We need you upstairs right away
Some major glitch in the accounting
lot of money missing
They go upstairs and Bill turns off the light
Excuse me
Excuse me
Ok, that's the last straw
[Scene Peter's place
Michael is looking up "money laundering" in the dictionary
] , , It doesn't really help us, Michael
Ok
We're looking up money laundering in a dictionary
Yeah, well, you guys can both eat my ass, ok
My girlfriend slept with Lumbergh, that's what  can't believe
Yeah, you didn't know that
It happened two years before you moved to Atlanta
You mean, Ron Lumbergh, the airshow guy
Yeah, who did you think she slept with, Bill
(He and Samir start laughing) If she fucked him, their children would have hooves
Ron's not related to Bill, is he
Someone rings the doorbell
Who is it
He hides the checks while Peter goes to the door
Don't panic
It's probably just the mailman
He opens the door
) '
Ok
That is why  am selling magazine subscriptions
No - was hoping you would help me out
Wait, wait, wait, wait
You used to be addicted to crack
Yes, but not anymore
Cut to later
They've got Steve in an armchair, trying to get him to help
Look, 'm sorry
do not know anything about money laundering
Look, we're not asking you if you know about money laundering, we're just trying to see if you can hook us up
He doesn't know anything, all right
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait a minute
You just give us the name of one drug dealer
could talk to him
have good networking skills
) '
You're a software engineer
Working must be, must be very hard for you
made more money selling magazine subscriptions than  ever did working at Initrode
Huh
You worked at Initrode
You can't tell anybody about any of this stuff  told you
mean, we know a lot of the same people
Actually, that all depends
He holds up his clipboard
Cut to later
Peter closes the door
What am  going to do with forty subscriptions to Vibe
wish we had never done this
What are we going to do
You know what can't figure out
How is it that all these stupid, Neanderthal, Mafia guys can be so good at crime and smart guys like us can suck so badly at it
We're new to it, though
If we had more experience - No
No
'know what  think
think we're screwed
There's evidence all over that building to link it to us
Even if we could launder money,  wouldn't want to
If we're caught while laundering money, we're not going to go to white-collar-resort-prison
No, no, no
We're gonna go to federal-reserve-pound-me-in-the-ass-prison
don't want to go to any prison
Why the hell did  do this
've never done anything wrong in my whole life
We weren't thinking clearly because you told us we were losing our jobs
And look at us now, we're, we're worried about going to prison
Don't worry about it
'll think of something
Ass
'm going home
You are a very bad person, Peter
Samir and Michael leave
Peter knocks on the wall

No, no,  got fired
What happened
flipped off my boss
And some customers - actually a line just happened to be standing there, so
'm going to go away for awhile
Uh, to jail
Yea, about that computer scam, you were right
it was a bad idea
'm going to take the blame for it,  decided
'm going to return the money and leave the confession under Lumbergh's door
Joanna,  wanna apologize
had no right to get pissed off at you, Lumbergh isn't my problem
It wasn't even the right Lumbergh
don't know why  can't just go to work and be happy, like 'm supposed to like everybody else
Peter, most people don't like their jobs
But you go out there and find something that makes you happy
Yeah
may never be happy with my job
But if  could be with you, think that  could be happy with my life
But if you could give it another shot,  promise, Joanna - Oh shut up
They hug and kiss
Hey, what's going on here
Get a room you two

Um, why don't you go and sit at your desk
Mr
Lumbergh should be here any minute
Mr
Lumbergh - Just go and sit at your desk
But - Oh
Ok, , , 'm going to set the building on fire
