-- treks across the rugged landscape
(
) Legend tells of a legendary warrior whose Kung Fu skills were the stuff of legend
The warrior, his identity hidden beneath his flowing robe and wide-brimmed hat, gnaws on a staff of bamboo
(
) (') He traveled the land in search of worthy foes
: The warrior sits at a table drinking tea and gnawing on his bamboo
The door  open
The   rushes in and surrounds him
(to warrior) see you like to
(beat) Maybe you should chew on my
The Boss punches the table
(
) The warrior said nothing for his mouth was full
Then, he swallowed
He swallows
(
) (') And then, he spoke
(dubbed hero voice) Enough talk
Let's
The warrior delivers a punch and the whole gang goes flying
(
) He was so deadly in fact that his enemies would go blind from overexposure to pure awesomeness
2
The gang members blindly flail about
'
swoon
And
How can we repay you
There is no charge for awesomeness, or attractiveness
appear and surround the warrior
: - The entire bar swells, packed to the rafters with ninjas
: - The roof  and a cloud of ninjas erupts into the sky
Like a tornado, the warrior spins and knocks them all down
(
) It mattered not how many foes he faced
They were no match for his bodacity
The warrior beats up a thousand ninjas, delivering his final blow while doing a split between two trees
The warrior stands amongst a field of vanquished foes as god- rays shine down upon him
(
) (') Never before had a panda been so feared
and so loved
() 3
(
) (') Even the most heroic heroes in all of China, the Furious Five, bowed in respect to this great master
We should hang out
Agreed
As the Five salute the warrior, he turns to see more bandits approaching
The Five strike an attack pose
The warrior brandishes a shiny green sword and leaps off the mountain into the sea of bandits
(
) But hanging out would have to wait
`Cause when you're facing the ten thousand demons of Demon Mountain, there's only one thing that matters
And that's-- In mid air, the Five talk to the warrior in a strange voice
Po
Get up
You'll be late for work
Whu
'  - Po lands hard on the floor
He tries to clear his head and wake up
'  (
) Po
Get up
We see his room is filled with various kung fu posters (including a poster featuring all of the Five) and souvenirs, and a wooden version of the Sword of Heroes (the green sword)
Po
He attempts to kick himself to his feet but alas, his belly is too worthy a foe
'  (
) (') Po
What are you doing up there
4
Uh, nothing
Po hops to his feet, imitating his Kung Fu action figures
(') Monkey
Mantis
Crane
Viper
Tigress
Rowrrrr
on the balcony of the neighboring house, a pig watering flowers stares at Po
Po tries to play it cool and then quickly ducks out of sight
'  (
) Po
Let's go
You're late for work
Coming
He takes a ninja star from his floor and chucks it at the wall
It bounces off
He throws the star again, but it bounces off again
He picks it up and heads downstairs
He trips and falls the rest of the way
- Po falls flat on his face on the kitchen floor
panda- shaped shadow looms over Po
Sorry, Dad
' Sorry doesn't make the noodles
Reveal that the shadow is actually caused by a basket being carried by a small
This is '
Po gets to work, which is not easy since the kitchen's not really made for a panda his size
'  (') What were you doing up there
All that noise
Oh, nothing
Just had a crazy dream
He gets back to work
5
' About what
Huh
' The dream
What were you dreaming about
What was
eh,  was dreaming about uh
heh
Push in on Po -- is he going to admit his dream
He hides his throwing star behind his back
(') Noodles
Dad stops chopping vegetables
' Noodles
You were really dreaming about noodles
Uh, yeah
What else would  be dreaming about
Po hands a noodle bowl to a customer, then realizes his throwing star is sitting in it
(') (to customer) Careful, that soup is
sharp
' Oh, happy day
My son, finally having the noodle dream
He throws his arms around Po
'  (') You don't know how long  have been waiting for this moment
When Dad pulls out of the hug, Po is now wearing a noodle apron
'  (') This is a sign, Po
6
Po looks at the apron nervously -- what has he gotten himself into
Uh
a sign of what
' You are almost ready to be entrusted with the secret ingredient of my "Secret Ingredient Soup
" And then you will fulfill your destiny and take over the restaurant, just as  took it over from my father, who took it over from his father, who won it from a friend in a game of mahjong
Dad Dad Dad, it was just a dream
' No, it was the dream
We are noodle folk
Broth runs through our veins
But Dad, didn't you ever,  dunno, want to do something else
Something besides noodles
' Actually
Po looks surprised
'  (') When  was young and crazy
Dad gets a wistful look in his eyes
'  (') thought about running away and learning how to make tofu
So why didn't you
' Oh, because it was a stupid dream
Can you imagine, me making tofu
(laughs at the thought) No
We all have our place in this world
Mine is here
And yours is-- 7
know
Is here
' No, it's at tables two, five, seven, and twelve
He loads Po's arms with bowls of soup
'  (') Service with a smile
sounds in the distance
Po looks out the window at the distant
- in towards Palace
End next to palace on an old red panda () playing a He is surrounded by the bushes and trees that nestle between the Palace buildings
Wider: We dolly around from behind the bushes
Stealthy dark shapes move in the foreground
Back on Shifu, still playing
He seems oblivious
Five figures explode from the undergrowth simultaneously, diving on Shifu
Shifu moves like lightning - the flute now wielded like a staff - he deflects, blocks, dodges, parries - the attackers go flying - They roll and pick themselves up, turning to face Shifu, who is now standing - poised - ready for their next move
Well done, students
if you were trying to disappoint me
He uses his flute to correct the Five's technique
(') Tigress, you need more ferocity
Monkey, greater speed
Each of the Five bows respectfully as their name is mentioned
8
(') Crane - height
Viper - subtlety
Mantis-- Shifu suddenly points the flute at a scared
Master Shifu
(impatiently) What
(startled) Aah
It's Master Oogway
He wants to see you
Shifu looks up, concerned
Shifu strides purposefully down the hallway, which is lined with palace geese
- Candles, incense, and smoke fill the room
The door bursts open, the candles flicker
Shifu enters
Master Oogway
You summoned me
He bows
Then looks up without unbowing
(') Is something wrong
Reveal Master Oogway
a wise, old tortoise
Why must something be wrong for me to want to see my old friend
So
nothing's wrong
Well,  didn't say that
Shifu looks up, concerned
Oogway opens his mouth
and blows out a candle
And another candle
And another
9
Finally, Shifu uses his Kung Fu to blow them all out
Oogway smiles knowingly
You were saying
have had a vision
Tai Lung will return
Shifu looks stricken
- Quick, impressionistic images of Shifu battling a large, shadowy figure (Tai Lung)
- Shifu is rattled
He looks at the claw marks that still scar the wall and quickly looks away
But he regains his composure
That is impossible
He is in prison
Nothing is impossible
Shifu makes a split decision
Zeng
He comes flying in
Shifu gets in his face
(') Fly to Chogun Prison and tell them to double the guards, double their weapons
Double everything
Tai Lung does not leave that prison
Yes, Master Shifu
The goose flies off, but
He hits a column
Then he is off
Back on Oogway, as he walks toward camera, away from Shifu
10
One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it
We have to do something
We can't just let him march on the valley, and take his revenge
He'll, he'll-- Oogway looks into the water of the moon pool
Your mind is like this water, my friend
When it is agitated, it becomes difficult to see
But if you allow it to settle, the answer becomes clear
Shifu and Oogway stare into the pool
Oogway settles the water, revealing the reflection of an intricately carved dragon clutching a  in its mouth
The Dragon Scroll
It is time
But who
Who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power
To become
the Dragon Warrior
Dramatic music as we push in on Oogway's face
Then
don't know
- Po is serving customers, but has trouble squeezing between tables
Oop
sorry
Hey
Watch it, Po
Sorry
Suck it up
11
He sucks his belly in, but this causes his butt to interfere with a bunny family's meal
Ugh
Oop
Sorry
thousand pardons
couple palace geese put up a poster on the wall and a palace pig hits a tiny gong
This gets Po's attention
He rushes up to the poster
(') What
Master Oogway's choosing the Dragon Warrior
Today
Customers jump up excitedly
(') Everyone
Everyone
Go
Get to the Jade Palace
Po urges the villagers out the restaurant
(') One of the Five is gonna get the Dragon Scroll
Customers rush to finish their food
(') We've been waiting a thousand years for this
Just take the bowl
Other customers are finishing their soup
One old lady customer slowly counts out coins and puts them on the table
(') This is the greatest day in Kung Fu history
Don't worry about it, just go
He starts to run
' Po
Where are you going
Po stops dead in his tracks, busted
To the
Jade Palace
12
' But you're forgetting your noodle cart
The whole valley will be there, and you'll sell noodles to all of them
Selling noodles
But Dad, you know, was kinda thinking maybe
' Yeah
was kinda thinking maybe
' Uh huh
Po wants to say something to his dad, but he loses his nerve
Could also sell the bean buns
They are about to go bad
' That's my boy
told you that dream was a sign
Yeah, ha ha, glad  had it
- Throngs of Villagers are streaming into the arena
couple run by
#1 Yippee
#2 'm a Kung Fu warrior
#1 Me too
Where's Po
a long, long, long, long flight of stairs
Po stands at the bottom with his noodle cart, looking up at the daunting task before him
Po struggles to pull his noodle cart up the stairs
13
The sun beats down on Po, but he presses forward
Climbing
Climbing
: - Po is still struggling up the stairs
Come on
Come on, ya-- Almost there
He stops, flopping onto his back to catch his breath
he's only made it up seven steps
(') What
No
Oh No
Two Pigs pass by
Sorry, Po
We'll bring you back a souvenir
Po watches as they run up the stairs
His eyes narrow
This is his heroic moment
No
'll bring me back a souvenir
Po tosses off his hat and apron and begins his ascent up the stairs
- Oogway reaches the bottom of the palace stairs and a Palace Pig bangs a gong
It is an historic day, isn't it, Master Oogway
Yes, and one  feared  would not live to see
Are your students ready
14
Yes, Master Oogway
Now know this, old friend
Whomever choose will not only bring peace to the Valley, but also to you
As Shifu contemplates what this could mean, Oogway starts walking off
Shifu quickly joins Oogway as they head towards the roaring crowd below
The pig bangs the gong
Let the tournament begin
- Throngs of Villagers are streaming into the arena
- Po gasps for air as he hoists himself over the last step, laughing victoriously
(out of breath) Yeah
The doors to the palace arena begin to close
(') Oh no
No no no
Wait
'm coming
Po runs to the entrance and proceeds to bang on the door
(') Hey
Open the door
inside drown out Po's pounding
He yells
(') Let me in
Inside, spectators' screams drown out Po's yelling
Po panics for a beat and then finds a window
He jumps and weakly struggles to pull himself up
Po struggles to peek through the window
15
- Citizens of the Valley of Peace
It is my great honor to present to you
Tigress
Viper
Crane
Monkey
Mantis
The Furious Five
The Five jump into the middle of the ring
The Furious Five
Po manages a brief glimpse of the Five before a gust of wind knocks Po to the ground and shuts the window
Warriors prepare
Po runs over to a crack in the wall
Peeky-hole
Ready for battle
Inside the arena, Po catches a glimpse of Crane as he spreads his wings
Yeah
Woo
The Thousand Tongues of Fire
One of the spectators walks in front of Po, cutting off his view
Whoa
Look at that
Hey, get out of the way
Po backs up to get a better look at Crane in the sky and accidentally falls down the stairs
Po climbs back up and drops his head -- he missed it
: Po tries karate chopping the door open
to no avail
He slumps to the ground
16
(') Ow
Po attempts a pole vault, but falls on his back
The pole whips around and hits him into the arena wall
Po rigs a catapult, only to get clobbered by it
The crowd Po sits atop the stairs
Alone
And finally
Master Tigress
Po snaps to attention
Po pulls on a rope tied to a tree
(
) (') And believe me citizens, you have not seen anything yet
(
) Master Tigress
Face Iron Ox and his Blades of Death
Tigress sets up to deliver her move
Po launches himself up above the fence, gets a peek at Tigress, then falls out of view just as she does her move
Po lands outside the arena in a fireworks tent
- Oogway senses something
He raises his hand and the crowd hushes
sense the Dragon Warrior is among us
Shifu motions for the Five to gather in the center of the ring
Citizens of the Valley of Peace
Master Oogway will now choose
the Dragon Warrior
17
- Po comes to
Huh
Oh no
Wait
He sees the fireworks and has an idea
(') Yeah
- Oogway closes his eyes and raises his hand as ceremonial start to play
- Po struggles with something, his back turned to us
Reveal he has tied a load of fireworks to a chair
He hops on and lights the fuse
'  (
) Po
Po's Dad rushes over and tries to blow out the fuse
'  (') What are you doing
What does it look like 'm doing
Stop
Stop
'm going to see the Dragon Warrior
' But  don't understand
You finally had the noodle dream
Po looks uneasy
lied
don't dream about noodles, Dad
He looks at the fuse
almost all gone
Po holds onto the chair for dear life, closes his eyes, and braces himself for liftoff
(') love kung fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu- 18
Po finally opens his eyes
He's still on the ground
The fuse was a dud
Po falls face first into the dirt
He looks away, embarrassed
Po's Dad holds out his apron
' Come on, son
Let's get back to work
Okay
Po sighs, starts to reach for the apron, then--
The rockets ignite, propelling Po into the stadium wall
' Oh
Come back
Po's rocket chair blasts him into the sky amid a shower of fireworks
Oooh
Aaahh
Po climbs up and up
until the rockets die out and the chair loses power
Uh oh
Oogway's arm sweeps down the line of the expectant Five
Po falls towards the center of the ring
The tension builds as the Five wait to see who will be picked
Then
Po lands and kicks up a huge dirt cloud, obscuring the ring
: He sees the Five looking down at him, appalled
Po comes round slowly, getting his bearings
He looks around and sees Oogway
Strangely, the old turtle is smiling
What's going on
Where
uh
What are you pointing--
He looks up
An awful realization starts to dawn
Po
He is desperately embarrassed
19
(') Oh
Okay
Sorry
just wanted to see who the Dragon Warrior was
He tries to shuffle his butt out of there, mumbling apologies
How interesting
Master, are you pointing at
me
Him
Who--
Po tries moving out of the way of Oogway's finger, but it keeps following him
You
Me
Oogway grabs Po's hand and holds it up for all to see
The universe has brought us the Dragon Warrior
: What
What
What
' The pig bangs the gong
The crowd goes wild
They cheer
They scream
Confetti falls
palanquin is carried past Shifu
20
Stop
Wait
Who told you to--
Po stands there, utterly stunned, his mouth hanging open
He is abruptly lifted up out of shot
Cut to the Palace Geese straining
Po is being lifted with great effort on the palanquin
He is carried off
Shifu elbows his way urgently through the thronging crowd to get to Oogway
(') Master Oogway, wait
That flabby panda can't possibly be the answer to
our problem
You were about to point at Tigress
That thing fell in front of her
That was just an accident
There are no accidents
Oogway smiles benignly as we hear an off-screen
The camera adjusts to reveal the palanquin has collapsed under Po
Shifu looks at Oogway
Oogway just smiles
squad of burly pigs rushes in and hoists Po, the palanquin, and the Geese onto their shoulders, and they head off for the Jade Palace
Stunned, Shifu watches them go
Behind him, the Five approach and bow
Forgive us, Master
We have failed you
Shifu spins around
No
If the panda has not quit by morning, then  will have failed you
Confetti flutters through the air as the celebration continues around them
: 21
-- huge prison is carved into the side of a frozen mountain
Fifteen stories of iron and rock
No windows
One door -- locked, bolted and sealed tight
Rhinoceros guards in armor patrol the perimeter
Zeng, the palace goose, flies into frame and a Rhino Sentry spots him in the distance
He lands, sliding on the ice and crashing into the gate
The rhinos point their spears at him
Wait wait wait
bring a message from Master Shifu
The doors creak open
The terrified goose peers in
: -- What
(reading) "Double the guard
Extra precautions
Your prison may not be adequate
" The Goose is quaking in fear
Stern Rhinos surround him, staring daggers at him
The Commander snaps the scroll shut
(') You doubt my prison's security
Absolutely not
(then) Shifu does
'm just the messenger
'll give you a message for your Master Shifu
Escape from Chogun Prison is impossible
The Goose is awed by the cavernous prison
22
Whoa
The goose looks over the bridge's edge
The prison goes down a long ways
The commander hits the goose on the back
Impressive, isn't it
feather from the goose drifts down the prison
Yes, very impressive
It's impressive
One way in, one way out, one thousand guards, and one prisoner
Yes, except that prisoner is Tai Lung
Take us down
Several guard rhinos winch the goose and the commander down
The commander grabs the chain and shakes the elevator, trying to scare the goose
What are you doing
The commander just laughs
The elevator finally lands, sending an echo throughout the prison
- number of doors unlock, one after the other
Finally, a drawbridge is lowered out onto an island
(') Oh my
Behold, Tai Lung
'll um
'm just gonna wait right here
23
It's nothing to worry about
It's perfectly safe
He shoves the goose out ahead of him
Oof
Crossbows
At the ready
Crossbows
They approach  , a giant, muscular snow leopard bound in a giant piece of tortoise shell armor and chains
He barely registers signs of life
The commander walks right up to him
Hey, tough guy, did you hear
Oogway's finally gonna give someone the Dragon Scroll and it's not gonna be you
The goose can't believe it
What are you doing
Don't get him mad
What's he gonna do about it
've got him completely immobilized
The Commander stomps on Tai Lung's tail
We hear a crunch
The goose flinches
But Tai Lung does not react
(') Awww
Did  step on the witty kitty's tail
Awww
Tai Lung doesn't move
His eyes stare coldly straight ahead
'm good
've seen enough
'm gonna tell Shifu he's got nothing to worry about
No, he doesn't
24
Okay, 'll tell him that
Can we please go now
The Commander starts to walk back to the elevator
The goose hurries after him
The goose's feather flutters into frame
We follow the feather as it lands right in front of Tai Lung
Tai Lung grabs the feather with his tail
- The palace doors open to reveal Po on the palanquin, hundreds of villagers behind him
(chanting) Dragon Warrior
Dragon Warrior
Po is ushered in and the doors close
He is alone
He runs back to the closed palace doors
Wait a second
Hello
Uh
think there's been a slight mistake
Everyone seems to think that 'm, uh
Po finally realizes where he is
(') Whoa
The Sacred Hall of Warriors
No way
Would you look at this place
He rushes up to a display of armor
(') () Master Flying Rhino's Armor
With authentic battle damage
He rushes up to a green sword, making sure not to touch it
(') () The Sword of Heroes
Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself just by looking--
He stares at a black sopt on the wall
25
(') () The Invisible Trident of Destiny
He admires a painting
(') () 've only seen paintings of that painting
Po runs around the room, amazed by all the ancient kung fu artifacts
Something special catches Po's eye
(') (loudly) Nooo
Ohhhh
He runs over to it
(') The legendary Urn of Whispering Warriors
Said to contain the souls of the entire Tenshu army
(calling into vase) Hellooo
Have you finished sight-seeing
Po
(to vase) Sorry
should've come to see you first
My patience is wearing thin
(to vase) Oh
Well,  mean, it's not like you were going anywhere
Would you turn around
Sure
Po turns and sees Shifu
26
(') Hey, how's it going
Po turns back to the vase
(') (to vase) Now how do you get five thousand-- (cutting himself off) Master Shifu
Po bumps the vase which falls and
(') Someone
broke that
But 'm gonna fix it
Do you have some glue
The vase debris screams as Po tries to pick up the pieces
(') Ow
Ooh
Splinter
Po fumbles around
Shifu looks irked
So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior
Hmmm
Uh
guess so
Shifu smiles and shakes his head
Wrong
You are not the Dragon Warrior
You will never be the Dragon Warrior until you have learned the secret of the Dragon Scroll
He points to a dragon on the ceiling with a single scroll in its mouth
(in awe) Whoa
(then) So how does this work
You have a ladder or trampoline or
You think it's that easy
That  am just going to hand you the secret to limitless power
27
No,
One must first master the highest level of kung fu
And that is clearly impossible if that one is someone like you
Someone like me
Shifu walks around Po - pointing out his weaknesses
Yes
Look at you
this fat butt
Shifu  Po on the butt with his staff
(') Flabby arms
Those are sensitive in the flabby parts
Shifu  Po on the arm with his staff
And this ridiculous belly
Shifu  Po in the belly with his staff
Hey
--and utter disregard for personal hygiene
(pointing at Shifu) Now wait a minute
That's a little uncalled-for
Don't stand that close
can smell your breath
Listen
Oogway said that  was the- Shifu pinches Po's outstretched digit
28
(') (gasp) The Wuxi Finger Hold
Not the Wuxi Finger Hold
(sly) Oh, you know this hold
DevelopedbyMasterWuxiInTheThirdDyna sty--
Oh, then you must know what happens when  flex my pinky
Po nervously eyes his finger locked in Shifu's grip and nods quickly
No no no
You know the hardest part of this
The hardest part is cleaning up afterwards
Okay
Okay
Take it easy
Now listen closely, panda
Oogway may have picked you, but when 'm through with you,  promise you, you're going to wish he hadn't
Are we clear
Yeah, we're clear
We're clear
We are so clear
Good
can't wait to get started
The doors open, revealing Po nursing his wounded finger
Shifu steps out of the way and Po's face goes into shock
The Five are performing death-defying kung fu moves in the training hall
Tigress smashes a swinging, spiked ball of wood
, as shards of wood blast into his face
Po is intimidated and overwhelmed
29
Shifu scowls at Po
Let's begin
He gestures to the gauntlet
Po's eyes go wide
Wait wait wait
What
Now
Yes
now
Unless you think the great Oogway was wrong, and you are not the Dragon Warrior
Oh, okay
Well--  don't know if can do all of those moves
Shifu walks away and Po half-heartedly follows
Well, if we don't try, we'll never know will we
Uh, yeah
It's just, maybe we can find something more suited to my level
And what level is that
Well, ya know
'm not a master, but uh, let's just start at zero, level zero
There is no such thing as level zero
Hey
Maybe  can start with that
Po points at a rather friendly-looking dummy
That
We use that for training children
And for propping the door open when it's hot
But if you insist
Relieved, Po turns to the dummy
The Five gather around him
30
Whoa
The Furious Five
You're so much bigger than your action figures -- except for you, Mantis
You're about the same
Mantis gives him a look
Go ahead, panda
Show us what you can do
Um, are they gonna watch
Or should just wait until they get back to work or something
Hit it
Ok
mean,  just ate
So 'm still digesting
So my kung fu might not be as good as later on
Just hit it
Po psyches himself up, doing some Jack Fu
Alright
Whatcha got
You got nothing cause  got it right here
You picking on my friends
Get ready to feel the thunder
'm comin' at him with the crazy feet
Whatcha gonna do about my crazy feet
'm a blur
'm a blur
You never seen bear style, you only seen praying Mantis
could come at you Monkey style
'm comin' at ya snikity-snake
Shifu and the Five stare at Po, perplexed
Would you hit it
Alright
alright
Po lightly hits the dummy and it rocks back into place
31
Why don't you try again
little harder
Po punches it again, knocking it all the way backwards
He turns to Shifu, smug
How's tha-- The dummy rights itself and smacks Po
Totally dazed, Po trips and stumbles his way through the obstacle course
The Five instinctively step forward to help Po, but Shifu holds up his hand to stop them
(') Ow, that hurts
spiky tethered ball sends Po flying into the jade turtle exercise, where it rattles him around
(to the Five) This'll be easier than  thought
Back to Po in the turtle bowl
Feeling a little nauseous
The turtle spills him out and he stumbles into the army of wooden dummies
(') Ow, those are hard
Ooh
think The last dummy whaps him in the crotch and everything becomes still
(') Oooohoohoo
my tenders
He struggles to get on his feet, takes one step and reaches out to a dummy arm
and immediately gets pummeled all over again
Po comes out the other side battered and bruised and finds he is standing on the floor that shoots out bursts of flame
We see reflections of fire on the Five and Shifu as Po gets singed
He comes crawling into frame
32
(') How did  do
There is now a level zero
: - The Five are walking to the bunkhouse, which sits high on a hill
There's no words
No denying that
don't understand what Master Oogway was thinking
The poor guy's just gonna get himself killed
(mocking) He is so mighty
The Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky on a ball of fire
When he walks, the very ground shakes
One would think that Master Oogway would choose someone who actually knew Kung Fu
Yeah, or could at least touch his toes
Or even see his toes
As the others walk off, we reveal Po, who unbeknownst to them has been walking behind them this whole time, hearing everything
He attempts to look at his toes but just sees gut
He lifts up his stomach, leans forward
leans
leans
and falls over
33
He gets up and watches them go inside
He sighs
Po peeks around the corner
Okay
He tip-toes into the hall
The floorboards strain beneath him
(') (whispering) Great
Po takes a gentle step
------
Po's foot goes through the floor
Po tries to recover
--
Po rolls his ankle and stumbles through a bedroom door
Crane is staring back at him
(') Oh hey
hi
You're up
Am now
was just uh
Some day huh
That kung fu stuff is hard work, right
Your biceps sore
Crane looks at his wing
Um
've had a long and rather disappointing day, so uh
yeah, should probably get to sleep now
Yeah yeah yeah, of course
(relieved) Okay, thanks
It's just
'm such a big fan
34
Oop
You guys were totally amazing at the Battle of Weeping River
Outnumbered a thousand to one, but you didn't stop, and then you just
-
Po does a spastic series of Kung Fu moves
We hear a , and reveal that he's kicked his foot through the paper wall
(') Ooo, sorry about that
Look, you don't belong here
Po looks stung to be hearing this from one of his heroes
know
know
You're right just - my whole life 've dreamed of- Crane stops Po before he embarrasses himself even more
No no no
meant you don't belong here
mean, in this room
This is my room
Property of Crane
Po is mortified, but covers
Oh, okay
Right right
Yeah, you want to get to sleep
Yeah
'm keepin' you up
We got big things tomorrow
Alright
You're awesome
Last thing 'm gonna say
Okay
Bye bye
Po shuts the door
Crane sighs
The door flies open
Po enters with an eager smile
(') What was that
35
didn't say anything
Okay
Alright
Goodnight
Sleep well
Po backs out into the hall and closes the door
(') Seemed a little bit awkward
Po turns and walks down the hall to find a vacant room
- Tigress opens the door behind him
Po winces
(') Master Tigress
Didn't mean to wake you
Just uh
You don't belong here
Uh, yeah, yeah
Of course
This is your room
mean
you don't belong in the Jade Palace
You're a disgrace to Kung Fu, and if you have any respect for who we are and what we do, you will be gone by morning
She closes the door on Po, who slumps sadly
Big fan
- dejected Po stands under a peach tree in the moonlight
Oogway approaches
see you have found the Sacred Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom
Po spins around, his face dripping with peach juice
36
(mouth full) Is that what this is
am so sorry
thought it was just a regular peach tree
understand
You eat when you are upset
Upset
'm not upset
What makes you think 'm upset
So why are you upset
Po sighs, there's no use trying to lie to Oogway
probably sucked more today than anyone in the history of kung fu, in the history of China, in the history of sucking
Probably
And the Five
man, you should have seen them, they totally hate me
Totally
How's Shifu ever going to turn me into the Dragon Warrior
mean, 'm not like The Five
've got no claws, no wings, no venom
Even Mantis has those
(he imitates a mantis' front legs) thingies
Maybe  should just quit and go back to making noodles
Quit, don't quit
Noodles, don't noodles
Po looks confused
37
(') You are too concerned with what was and what will be
There is a saying: Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift
That is why it is called the present
Oogway hits the tree with his staff as he walks away and a peach falls into Po's open hand
-- Using the goose's feather to pick the lock, Tai Lung free from his armor
An
The Commander runs to the ledge, the Goose right behind him
What's happening
The Goose looks over the edge and sees Tai Lung at the bottom of the pit
Tai Lung struggles with his shackles
Fire Crossbows
Tai Lung uses the incoming spears to break his shackles and then manages to kick the spears back up into the walls, creating a makeshift staircase
Tai Lung is free
must warn Shifu
The Commander shuts the Goose up
You're not going anywhere
And neither is he
Let go of me
(to guards) Bring it up
38
The winch turns and the elevator starts to rise
rhino guard tries to reach it, but just misses
#1 Wait
Bring it back
He's coming this way
He won't get far
(to guards) Archers
Leaping across the spears, Tai Lung catches the elevator as the volley of arrows flies down past him
The guards cut the rope and the elevator crashes back down to the bottom of the pit
Tai Lung swings up from the bottom of the elevator house and catches the guards by surprise
He grabs the chain and jumps over the edge and swings around, launching himself up to the next tier, disappearing into the shadows
Tai Lung lands on a bridge, fights his way through, finally reaching the top tier where the Commander and the rest of the Rhino army await
We're dead
So very, very dead
The Commander hushes the Goose
(to Goose) Heh heh
not yet we're not
Now
Archers set off charges on the ceiling
Massive stalactites crash down and the bridge begins to crumble
Tai Lung leaps across the crumbling debris and attempts one last huge jump towards the Commander
But he falls short, claws scraping and sparking against the rock wall
The Commander laughs maniacally
On his way down, Tai Lung looks up and sees a fuse burning down to the last group of explosives
He leaps across the raining debris up to the ceiling of the cavern
Grabbing a hold of the dynamite, Tai Lung falls and slings it ahead of him at the guards
Can we run now
39
Yes
-
The door blasts open and Rhinos go flying everywhere
The Goose hits the ground
The commander's horn prosthetic falls in front of him
Nuuu
Urggg
Tai Lung picks up the Goose by the throat
(') 'm glad Shifu sent you
was beginning to think  had been forgotten
With a creepy tenderness, Tai Lung smooths the Goose's ruffled feathers
(') Fly back there and tell them
the real Dragon Warrior is coming home
Tai Lung throws the Goose into the air and he flutters off
Lightning strikes
: - - of a gong being struck
- Shifu enters the hallway of the bunkhouse
The Five burst out of their rooms and land, ready for inspection
Good morning master
One door remains closed
40
Panda
Panda, wake up
He slides open Po's door
The room is empty
(') (satisfied) Hmm
He's quit
- Shifu walks with a bit more energy
What do we do now, Master
With the panda gone, who will be the Dragon Warrior
All we can do is resume our training and trust that in time, the true Dragon Warrior will be revealed
- Shifu enters the training hall, only to find himself face-to- face with Po's butt
Shifu and the Five are taken aback
What are you doing here
Reveal Po is in the middle of the floor, his legs spread wide apart
Po looks back over his shoulder to see Shifu and the Five enter the hall
Hey
Huh
Good morning, Master thought 'd warm up a little
You're stuck
Stuck
Whaa
Pfft
stuck
Yeah, 'm stuck
(to Crane) Help him
Crane approaches Po
41
Oh dear
Crane gingerly grabs Po's waistband and attempts to pull him up by flapping his wings
Maybe on three
One
Two- Crane pulls him up and Po flops onto his back
(') Threeeee
Thank you
Don't mention it
No really,  appreci-- --
You actually thought you could learn to do a full split in one night
It takes years to develop one's flexibility and years longer to apply it in combat
Shifu flings two boards into the air
Instantly, Tigress leaps up and executes a perfect split kick
Po is awestruck
As Tigress lands, the broken chunks of board land all around Po, knocking him on the head
Po collects a piece of splintered board as a souvenir
Shifu notices and steps forward
(') Put that down
The only souvenirs we collect here are bloody knuckles and broken bones
Yeah, excellent
He laughs excitedly and salutes Shifu
Let's get started
: 42
Shifu snaps his fingers
Viper and Po face off
Are you ready
was born ready-- Viper lashes her tail around Po's wrist, wrenches his arm back, flings him into the air and brings him crashing back down on his head
(') Eaghhh
'm sorry, brother
thought you said you were ready
That was awesome
Let's go again
(salutes) Shifu snaps
Monkey twirls a bamboo staff
He lunges at Po who takes a comical beating
Shifu snaps
Po and Crane prepare to spar atop the turtle bowl
Po falls in and is tossed around like a sack of soup
Shifu snaps
We see a series of shots of Po falling on his face at the hands of some invisible opponent, who turns out to be
Mantis
Shifu smiles
Flat on his back, Po manages a salute
Shifu has had it
've been taking it easy on you, panda, but no more
Your next opponent
will be me
Po looks excited
Alright
Let's go
43
The Five exchange worried looks
(to Po) Step forth
Po doesn't even finish the step as Shifu whirls him around and throws him to the floor pinning his arm behind him
(') The true path to victory is to find your opponent's weakness and make him suffer for it
(delighted) Oh, yeah
Shifu whips Po around again
To take his strength and use it against him
Again, this time Shifu holds Po by the nose
(') --until he finally falls, or quits
Po is totally inspired
But a real warrior never quits
Don't worry, Master,  will never quit
At his breaking point, Shifu flings Po into the air and then leaps at him with a flying kick
: - Po crashes out of the door and tumbles down the steps
The Five watch him fall
If he's smart, he won't come back up those steps
But he will
44
He's not gonna quit, is he
He's not gonna quit bouncin', 'll tell ya that
Cut  as Po continues to tumble
- Close on Po, who grimaces
(
) Aaaoo
whoohoo
EEEee
hee- hee
thought you said acupuncture would make me feel better
Mantis pops up from behind Po holding a handful of needles and sticks Po again
Trust me, it will
It's just not easy finding the right nerve points under all this-- Fat
Fur,  was gonna say fur
Sure you were
Who am  to judge a warrior based on his size
mean -- look at me
Po looks for Mantis
(
) (') 'm over here
But Mantis is now on his other shoulder
He jabs another needle into Po
Ow
45
Maybe you should take a look at this again
Viper is holding a diagram of acupuncture meridians (onto which someone has overlaid a drawing of a panda
) (re: diagram) Oh
Okay
Quick cuts to Monkey meditating in his room and Crane doing calligraphy in his
Po's yelps distract them
Ow
Don't
(laughing) Stop it, stop-- Yow
know Master Shifu's trying to inspire me and all, but if  didn't know any better, 'd say he was trying to get rid of me
Po chuckles
The others look at each other and chuckle awkwardly
know he can seem kind of heartless-- He violently jabs another needle in Po
(') But, ya know, he wasn't always like that
According to legend, there was once a time when Master Shifu actually used to smile
No
Yes
Cut to Tigress out in the hallway
She can hear them talking
But that was before
Before what
46
Tigress enters
Before Tai Lung
Crane's shadow is silhouetted on the wall
Uh yeah, we're not really supposed to talk about him
Well, if he's going to stay here, he should know
(trying to ease the tension) Guys, guys
know about Tai Lung
Tigress turns to Po
(') He was a student, the first ever to master the thousand
Tigress approaches Po and leans in towards him
(') (nervously trailing off) scrolls of
kung fu
and
then he turned bad
and now he's in jail
Tigress shakes her head at the panda's ignorance
He wasn't just a student
: Shifu peeks out of the Training Hall and finds a baby leopard cub on the steps
(
) Shifu found him as a cub
And he raised him as a son
Baby Tai Lung pulls on Shifu's whiskers
47
(
) (') and when the boy showed talent in Kung Fu
Baby Tai Lung punches the training dummy across the floor
(
) (') Shifu trained him
Shifu teaches Baby Tai Lung how to punch
(
) (') He believed in him
He told him he was destined for greatness
Hard cut to a full-grown Tai Lung demolishing a training dummy
(
) (') It was never enough for Tai Lung
He wanted the Dragon Scroll
But Oogway saw darkness in his heart and refused
Outraged, Tai Lung laid waste to the valley
He tried to take the scroll by force
And Shifu had to destroy what he had created
Tai Lung ransacks a village on his way up to the Jade Palace
He crashes through the doors, running towards a waiting Shifu and Oogway
Shifu leaps at Tai Lung to deliver a kick
(
) (') But how could he
Seeing only baby Tai Lung running towards him, Shifu pulls his kick short
Tai Lung counters with a devastating strike and Shifu crashes to the ground holding his broken leg
Tai Lung leaps for the scroll, but Oogway stops him with strikes at his pressure points
He falls to the ground in a heap
(
) (') Shifu loved Tai Lung like he'd never loved anyone before
Young Tigress in the training hall strikes the dummy in the same manner as Tai Lung
Shifu corrects her form
Nothing more
Young Tigress looks crestfallen
48
(
) (') or since
The sad, young Tigress cross-dissolves to adult Tigress
- Everyone is quiet in the moment
And now he has a chance to make things right, to train the true Dragon Warrior
And he's stuck with you: a big, fat panda who treats it like a joke
Po makes a googly-eyed face
Doieeeee
(charging at Po) Oh
That is it
Mantis pops up and halts Tigress
Wait
My fault
accidentally tweaked his facial nerve
Po falls face first to the floor, revealing his back is covered with needles
(') And may have also stopped his heart
- Shifu is sitting in meditation, fidgeting incessantly
Inner peace
Inner peace
Inner peace
He finally opens one eye
(') Would whoever is making that flapping sound, quiet down
49
Satisfied with the silence, Shifu nods and resumes his meditation
(') Inner
Zeng drops in from the ceiling
(') Oh, Zeng
Excellent
could use some good news right now
Uh
: - Oogway stands under the peach tree, deep in thought
Shifu rushes in, emerging from the mist, extremely agitated
Master
Master
Hmmm
(out of breath) have-- it's-- it's very bad news
Ah, Shifu
There is just news
There is no good or bad
Master, your vision
your vision was right
Tai Lung has broken out of prison
He's on his way
That is bad news
He turns to face Shifu and stares at him, eyebrow raised
(') If you do not believe that the Dragon Warrior can stop him
The panda
Master, that panda is not the Dragon Warrior
() 50
(') He wasn't even meant to be here -- it was an accident
There are no accidents
Yes,  know
You've said that already
Twice
Well, that was no accident either
Thrice
My old friend, the panda will never fulfill his destiny, nor you yours, until you let go of the illusion of control
Illusion
Yeah
Look at this tree, Shifu cannot make it blossom when it suits me, nor make it bear fruit before its time
But there are things we can control
Shifu kicks the tree and a peach falls to his feet
(') can control when the fruit will fall
peach falls on his head and Oogway chuckles
Shifu tosses the peach in the air, leaps up, and splits it with a chop
(') And  can control-- Shifu punches the ground, creating a hole and places the seed in it
(') --where to plant the seed
That is no illusion, Master
51
Ah, yes
But no matter what you do, that seed will grow to be a peach tree
You may wish for an apple, or an orange
but you will get a peach
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung
Maybe it can
If you are willing to guide it, to nurture it
To believe in it
Oogway covers the seed with dirt
But how
How
need your help, Master
No, you just need to believe
Promise me, Shifu
Promise me you will believe
will try
Oogway smiles, then glances up at the sky, then back down to Shifu
Good
My time has come
You must continue your journey without me
He hands his staff to a confused Shifu
What
what are you
Oogway backs away into the swirling fog
(') Master, you can't leave me
The petals surround Oogway as he approaches the cliff's edge
You must believe
Master
52
Shifu runs after him
Oogway is engulfed by peach blossoms
As the winds settle, Shifu is revealed standing at the edge of a cliff
Oogway is gone
We pan across to the bunkhouse
(
) So 'm like, fine, you may be a wolf, you may be the scariest bandit in Haijin Province
-- Reveal Po is cooking for the Five
He chops some veggies mid- air
but you're a lousy tipper
(incredulous) Really
So
how'd you get out of there alive
mean,  didn't actually say that, but  thought it
in my mind
Po flips some bowls and expertly lines them up on his arm
He ladles soup into them
(') (covering) If he
could read my mind, he'd have been like, "What
" (then) Order up
Po looks around expectantly and the Five (minus Tigress) dig in
(') Hope you like it
This is really good
(bashful) No, c'mon
() 53
(') You should try my dad's secret ingredient soup
He actually knows the secret ingredient
What are you talking about
This is amazing
Wow, you're a really good cook
wish my mouth was bigger
The others laugh
But not Tigress
Tigress, you gotta try this
Tigress looks up from her meal
It is said that the Dragon Warrior can survive for months at a time on nothing but the dew of a single gingko leaf and the energy of the universe
On the others for a beat
Then Po shrugs
guess my body doesn't know it's the Dragon Warrior yet
'm gonna need a lot more than dew
And, uh, universe juice
Po laughs
He picks up his bowl and takes a giant gulp
When he lowers the bowl, we see a noodle hanging from his face -- it looks like a moustache
Mantis snickers
(') What
Oh, nothing
Master Shifu
The rest start laughing
Po realizes he's wearing a noodle moustache
He plays it up
54
(imitating Shifu) You will never be the Dragon Warrior, unless you lose five hundred pounds and brush your teeth
The Five
(') (imitating Shifu) What is that noise you're making
Laughter
never heard of it
The Five keep
Po reaches over and grabs two empty bowls and holds them up like ears
(') (imitating Shifu) Work hard, Panda
And maybe, someday
you will have ears like mine
As the rest of the Five laugh, Tigress sneaks a moment to smell Po's soup
Leaning towards the bowl, she suddenly looks up and stops
The Five also look up and stop laughing
Reveal Shifu has entered behind Po
He is holding Oogway's staff
(') (normal) Ears
It's not working for you thought they were pretty good
Po looks at the stone-faced Five
Tigress jumps to her feet
It's Shifu
Of course it's Shifu
What do you think 'm doing
He finally notices Shifu standing there, doing a slow burn
Embarrassed, he places the soup bowls on his chest like a bra
(') Ooh
Master Shifu
Po slurps up the noodle moustache
Monkey can't help but snicker
55
You think this is funny
Tai Lung has escaped from prison and you're acting like children
What
He is coming for the Dragon Scroll, and you are the only one who can stop him
The bowls fall off
beat as this sinks in
then Po starts to laugh
And here  am saying you got no sense of humor
'm gonna stop Tai
Shifu just stares at him, deadly serious
(') What
You're serious
And  have to-- uh, Master Oogway will stop him
He did it before, he'll do it again
Oogway cannot, not anymore
They notice Shifu holding Oogway's staff
They know what this means
They are saddened by the news
(') Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior
The panda
Yes, the panda
Master, please
Let us stop Tai Lung
This is what you've trained us for
No
It is not your destiny to defeat Tai Lung
It is his
He dramatically points at Po
but Po is gone
56
(') Where'd he go
Shifu throws up his hands in frustration and heads after Po
: Super wide shot as Po runs away from the compound
Closer as he continues running
He checks over his shoulder, turns back
Shifu lands right in front of him
You cannot leave
real warrior never quits
Watch me
He tries to maneuver around Shifu, but is redirected back
(') Come on
How am  supposed to beat Tai Lung
can't even beat you to the stairs
You will beat him because you are the Dragon Warrior
He pushes Po back with the staff
Ow
You don't believe that
You never believed that
From the first moment  got here, you've been trying to get rid of me
Shifu pokes him again, this time causing Po to fall on his back
Yes
was
But now  ask you to trust in your master as  have come to trust in mine
You're not my master
And 'm not the Dragon Warrior
Po shoves the staff away and gets up
57
Then why didn't you quit
You knew was trying to get rid of you, and yet you stayed
Yeah,  stayed
stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head or said  smelled, it hurt
But it could never hurt more than it did every day of my life just being me
Po looks down at the Valley, then turns back to Shifu
(') stayed because  thought if anyone could change me, could make me
not me, it was you
The greatest kung fu teacher in all of China
But  can change you
can turn you into the Dragon Warrior
And will
'mon, Tai Lung is on his way here right now
And even if it takes him a hundred years to get here, how are you gonna change this
(indicate belly) into the Dragon Warrior
How
How
How
In frustration, Shifu yells out the answer
don't know
(then, resigned) don't know
That's what  thought
Shifu walks away, leaving the path open to Po
- Tigress stands in the moonlight outside the palace
She has seen what just transpired between Shifu and Po
58
She turns away, a look of resolve on her face
and
She flies through the air, finally landing on a rooftop in the valley below
She looks back up at the palace
This is what you trained me for
She takes off running
The other four are right behind her
Tigress
She keeps going and they give chase
Don't try and stop me
The chase continues through the village
We're not trying to stop you
What
We're coming with you
Then
the others join her
Tigress smiles
They leap off into the night
- Night dissolves to dawn
Shifu sits under the peach tree
He stirs, hearing    from the training hall
He goes to investigate
: - Shifu looks inside -- it's empty
The  continue from somewhere else -- the bunkhouse
: 59
- As Shifu turns the corner he sees Po's shadow as he performs some amazing Kung Fu
Entering the kitchen, Shifu finds Po is stuffing his face with food
Seeing Shifu, he stops mid-munch
In silence they eye each other
Shifu surveys the room -- broken lock, smashed doors, unhinged cabinets
Po belches
(mouth full) What
eat when 'm upset, okay
Shifu gets a glimmer in his eye
He has an idea
Oh, no need to explain
just thought you might be Monkey -- he hides his almond cookies on the top shelf
Shifu calmly exits and hides just outside the doorway, waiting to see if his hunch is correct
Shifu peeks back inside and finds Po perched atop the high shelves jamming more cookies into his mouth
Po notices Shifu walking back in
(mouth full) Don't tell Monkey
He glances back down at Shifu, whose disbelief turns to a wise smile
Look at you
Yeah,  know
disgust you
No no,  mean
how did you get up there
don't know
guess --  don't know
was getting a cookie
He looks at the cookie and then can't help but eat it
60
And yet you are ten feet off the ground and have done a perfect split
No, this
this is just an accident
He and Po stare at each other for a beat
Then
Po slips and crashes to the kitchen floor
cookie rolls over to Shifu
He picks it up
There are no accidents
Come with me
- Shifu leads Po through the mountains
know you're trying to be all mystical and kung fu-y, but could you at least tell me where we're going
Shifu just continues walking
: - Shifu is sitting beneath a tree
Winded and wheezing, Po slowly works his way up the hill
Po sets his gear down and looks around
Shifu breathes in the morning mist as Po approaches
You dragged me all the way out here for a bath
Po begins to pat his armpits with water
Panda, we do not wash our pits in The Pool of Sacred Tears
Po quickly stops
Realizing
61
(in awe) The pool of
This is where Oogway unravelled the mysteries of harmony and focus
This is the birthplace of Kung Fu
The camera cranes up to reveal they are standing on rock shapes that resemble a yin yang symbol
As the camera pulls further out, it pulls back through a vision of Oogway doing Kung Fu moves
-- Shifu leaps atop one of the rocks and looks down at Po
(') Do you want to learn Kung Fu
(awestruck) Yeah
Then  am your master
Okay
Tears of joy well up in Po's eyes
Don't cry
Okay
Po sniffs the tears back and smiles
- Shifu leads Po out into an open field
When you focus on Kung Fu, when you concentrate
you stink
Po scowls
62
(') But perhaps that is my fault cannot train you the way  have trained the Five
now see that the way to get through to you is with this
Shifu produces a bowl of dumplings
Oh great, `cause 'm hungry
Good
When you have been trained, you may eat
Let us begin
- Po's training unfolds -- deep breathing exercises, balance tests, push ups, sit ups, climbing, etc
Through it all, he never gets to eat, although he does indeed learn kung fu
- Shifu sets a bowl of dumplings on a boulder
After you, panda
Po stops short, suspicious
Just like that
No situps
No ten mile hike
vowed to train you
and you have been trained
You are free to eat
Po grabs one of the dumplings in his chopsticks
(') Enjoy
Po raises the dumpling to his mouth
Shifu snatches the dumpling away and eats it himself
Hey
63
said you are free to eat
Have a dumpling
Po reaches again as Shifu leaps across the table and kicks the dumpling into the air
Hey
Shifu eats it and Po scowls
You are free to eat
(upset) Am
(challenging) Are you
Po and Shifu ready their chopsticks
Po slams the table and sends the bowl of dumplings airborne
Back and forth, Po and Shifu spar, vying for the dumplings
Until there is only one left
Shifu tries every trick to keep the dumpling away from Po
He hides it underneath one of the bowls
He uses his chopsticks as weapons to smack Po's chopsticks away
He attacks Po with his bamboo staff
But Po skillfully manages to best Shifu for the final dumpling
Shifu smiles
Po has passed the final test
But then Po tosses the dumpling into Shifu's open hand
'm not hungry
master
Master and pupil bow to each other
: The Five race toward a rope bridge stretched between mountain peaks
64
Tai Lung appears at the other end of the bridge
He  and races toward them
Cut it
The others slash at the ropes securing the bridge to the mountain
Tai Lung is almost upon them when Tigress cuts the final rope
But Tai Lung is too close -- Tigress must launch herself into him
The two cats end up in the middle of the bridge just as it starts to tumble into the canyon below
The Five grab support ropes and hold on for dear life
Where's the Dragon Warrior
How do you know you're not looking at her
Tai Lung laughs
It echoes off the mountain walls
You think 'm a fool
know you're not the Dragon Warrior
None of you
The Five exchange quick, worried looks
(') (nodding confidently) heard how he fell out of the sky on a ball of fire, that he's a warrior unlike anything the world has ever seen
The Five exchange quick, confused looks
Po
So that is his name -- Po
Finally, a worthy opponent
Our battle will be legendary
Tigress charges at him
The battle begins
Tigress punches Tai Lung as he hangs from the bridge
But Tai Lung counters with a maneuver that sends Tigress slamming backwards through the bridge's wooden slats
Then Tigress gets choked by the bridge's ropes
Monkey turns to Crane and Viper
We've got this
Help her
65
Viper grabs Tai Lung, which causes him to let go of the ropes
Tigress plummets down into the gorge
but Crane manages to catch her
Viper punches Tai Lung repeatedly with his own fist
Tai Lung manages to get a paw around Viper's "throat"
Monkey
Mantis is straining to hold the rope by himself
Go
(then) Ack
What was  thinking
Monkey leaps into action, kicking Tai Lung in the chest and sending him crashing through the slats of the bridge
He gets back to his feet and starts running back to them on a single strand of rope
Mantis
Mantis whips his end of the rope, sending a sine wave shooting toward Tai Lung
The rope whips Tai Lung in the face and he gets tangled up
The Five see their chance
(') Now
Working as a team, the Five kick Tai Lung's butt every which way
Tigress finally slashes the last rope holding up Tai Lung
He plummets down
down
disappearing into the mist
Mantis whips his end of the rope, returning his buddies safely to the mountain
The Five look relieved
But the relief is short-lived
Tigress notices that the other end of the bridge is circling the far mountain peak
Her eyes go wide with dread
The rope whips up
But Tai Lung isn't there
With a crash, he suddenly appears behind the Five
Shifu taught you well
Tai Lung jabs a finger at Monkey, who instantly freezes
(') But he didn't teach you everything
66
Tai lung lunges toward the rest
- Shifu and Po walk through the palace courtyard
Po has an easy spring in his step
You have done well, Panda
Done well
Done well
've done awesome
He swings his belly around and knocks Shifu off balance
Shifu staggers back, regaining his dignity
The mark of a true hero is humility
After a moment's thought, though, he leans toward Po - (') But yes
you have done awesome
And he punches him playfully on the arm
Po smiles at him
As they , an indistinct figure appears in the clouds behind them
'
Crane carries the five to the palace grounds, crashing in a heap
Huh
Guys
Guys
Po throws his backpack aside and runs over to them
(') They're dead
No, they're breathing
They're asleep
No, their eyes are open
Crane struggles to lift his head
We were no match for his nerve attack
His head collapses to the ground
67
He has gotten stronger
Who
Tai Lung
Stronger
Shifu starts freeing the Five
First Viper, then Mantis, then Monkey releases suddenly from his paralysis - He's too fast
He delivers a Kung Fu punch to Po's head and then slowly realizes where he is
(') Sorry, Po
Shifu kneels before Tigress and works to free her
thought we could stop him
He could have killed you
Why didn't he
So you could come back here and strike fear into our hearts
But it won't work
Uh, it might,  mean, a little
'm pretty scared
You can defeat him, panda
Are you kidding
If they can't-- They're five masters
'm just one me
But you will have the one thing that no one else does
68
- - of the Dragon Scroll
Po stares at Shifu - then looks up at the Scroll
Then back at Shifu - You really believe 'm ready
You are, Po
They look at each other
This is a big moment
Oogway's staff hangs in a rack surrounded by candles
As Po and The Five stand by, Shifu carries the staff over to the reflecting pool
Shifu bows his head, then, eyes still closed, he raises the staff up above his head
Po and the others watch, expectantly
The peach blossom petals rise in a flickering, spinning cloud up from the pool
The gentle tornado rises up around the ceiling carving that holds the Dragon Scroll
The petals loosen the scroll from the dragon's mouth and it falls
At the last second, Shifu reaches out with the staff to catch the scroll on the end of it
He turns to Po, holding it out
(') Behold
The Dragon Scroll
It is yours
Wait, what happens when  read it
No one knows, but legend says you will be able to hear a butterfly's wing-beat
Whoa
Really
That's cool
Yes
And see light in the deepest cave
You will feel the universe in motion around you
Wow
Can  punch through walls
Can  do a quadruple back flip
Will  have invisibility-- Focus
Focus
69
Huh
Oh, yeah
yeah
Read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny
Read it and become
the Dragon Warrior
Whooaa
Po takes a deep breath
Then he grasps the tube and tries to pull the top off it
It doesn't budge
He strains at it
(') It's impossible to open
He strains again
He tries to bite it off
(') Come on baby
Come on now
Shifu  and holds out his hand
Po passes him the tube
Shifu pops the end off effortlessly and passes it back to Po
(') Thank you
probably loosened it up for you though
Okay, here goes
He glances at the Five
They look on in awe
Monkey gives him the `thumbs up
' Po starts to unroll the scroll, the golden light bathing his face
Across the scroll we see Shifu, excited that he is witness to history
On Po's face as he finishes opening the scroll
Then - (') Shifu looks concerned
The Five look concerned
Po looks utterly terrified
(') It's blank
What
Here
Look
70
Po tries to show Shifu the scroll
Shifu covers his eyes and turns his head away
No
am forbidden to look upon-- But he can't help himself
He takes a peek
Then he  if off Po
He turns it around, then upside down
He closes it and opens it again, astonished
(') Blank
don't
don't understand
Shifu turns away, contemplative
What can this mean
Okay
So like, Oogway was just a crazy old turtle after all
No
Oogway was wiser than us all
Po sits heavily on the floor, dejected
Oh, come on
Face it
He picked me by accident
Of course 'm not the Dragon Warrior
Who am  kidding
The Five don't argue
But who will stop Tai Lung
He'll destroy everything
and everyone
Shifu puts the scroll back in its container and seals it
He looks oddly calm as he turns around
No, evacuate the Valley
You must protect the villagers from Tai Lung's rage
What about you master
will fight him
71
What
can hold him off long enough for everyone to escape
But Shifu, he'll kill you
Then  will finally have paid for my mistake
The Five and Po look devastated
(') Listen to me, all of you
It is time for you to continue your journey without me
am very proud to have been your master
Shifu salutes them and turns away
Po is heartbroken
Crane steps forward and kindly puts a wing around Po, pulling away
Po resists for a moment, then lets the Five lead him off
: The Five arrive at the base of the stairs
We've got to get them out safely
Monkey picks up a small child
Come, little one
Let's find your mama
Viper, gather the southern farmers
Mantis, the north
Crane, light the way
They split up and begin helping the villagers evacuate
Po is left by himself
He makes his way through the bustling town
72
(skeptically) Look, it's the Dragon Warrior
Po approaches the Noodle Shop
Hey, Dad
' Po
Seeing Po, Po's Dad hurries over and wraps his arms around his son
Po bends down to reciprocate the hug, as Po's dad pulls away, having fastened an apron around Po's waist
'  (') Good to have you back, son
(listlessly) Good to be back
Po's Dad goes back to packing things up
' Let's go Po
So, for our next shop, it's time to face it -- the future of noodles is dice-cut vegetables, no longer slices
Dad starts to walk off, unaware that Po isn't following
'  (') Also,  was thinking, maybe this time we'll have a kitchen you can actually stand up in
Hmm
You like that
He turns and notices that Po hasn't moved
He walks to Po sympathetically
'  (') Po, 'm sorry things didn't work out
It just
wasn't meant to be
Po slumps against the cart
'  (') Po, forget everything else
Your destiny still awaits
We are noodle folk -- broth runs deep through our veins
73
don't know, Dad
Honestly, sometimes  can't believe 'm actually your son
Dad is taken aback
' Po,  think it's time  told you something  should have told you a long time ago
Okay
Dad pauses dramatically
' The secret ingredient of my secret ingredient soup
Po feigns excitement
Oh
' 'mere
The secret ingredient is
nothing
Huh
' You heard me
Nothing
There is no secret ingredient
Wait wait
it's just plain old noodle soup
You don't add some kind of special sauce or something
' Don't have to
To make something special, you just have to believe it's special
Po looks at his father with dawning realization
He picks up the Scroll
For a moment, Po stares at his reflection on the scroll, then he smiles serenely
He gets it now
74
There is no secret ingredient
Po turns back to look at the palace
: - At the top of the stairs, Shifu looks upon the Valley, awaiting his fate
With a gust of wind, Tai Lung appears before him
have come home, Master
This is no longer your home
And am no longer your master
Yes
You have a new favorite
So where is this
Po
Did  scare him off
This battle is between you and me
So
That is how it's going to be
That is how it must be
They fight
At last
Tai Lung punches Shifu clean through the doors of the Jade Palace
Tai Lung enters
rotted in jail for twenty years because of your weakness
Obeying your master is not weakness
You knew  was the Dragon Warrior
You always knew
Dissolve to
75
young Tai Lung looks expectant
Oogway shakes his head
(
) (') But when Oogway said otherwise, what did you do
What did you do
Tai Lung looks to Shifu who averts his eyes and the past dissolves into the present
(') Shifu takes a Kung Fu stance
You were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior
That was not my fault
Enraged, Tai Lung knocks over the Kung Fu artifacts and throws them at Shifu
(') Shifu dodges each attack
It was never my decision to make
Tai Lung pulls Oogway's staff from the shrine
It is now
They fight
Tai Lung pins Shifu down with the staff
(') Give me the scroll
would rather die
They struggle for a beat until finally, the staff splinters into a hundred pieces
Shifu looks back at the pieces and a flutter of peach tree petals fly by
Caught off guard, Shifu gets kicked by Tai Lung into a column
76
Shifu climbs the column to the rafters
Tai Lung follows and sends them both crashing through the roof
Lightning flash
Grappling in mid-air, Tai Lung gets his hands around Shifu's throat as they crash back through the roof
They kick apart
Shifu crashes to the floor and lands hard
Tai Lung bounces off the wall and throws a lantern to the floor
Flames go everywhere
Tai Lung's arms are aflame as he charges at Shifu
All  ever did,  did to make you proud
Tell me how proud you are, Shifu
Tell me
fiery punch sends Shifu skidding across the floor and crashing against the reflecting pool
The flames extinguish and Tai Lung extends his claws
(weakly) have always been proud of you
From the first moment, 've been proud of you
And it was my pride that blinded me
loved you too much to see what you were becoming
What  was turning you into
'm
sorry
Tai Lung stops in his tracks
Shifu waits
Tai Lung's expression goes cold
He grabs Shifu by the throat
don't want your apology
want my scroll
He holds Shifu up to the ceiling
Looking up, Tai Lung bristles when he sees the scroll is missing
(') Tai Lung slams Shifu to the floor
(weakly) Dragon Warrior has taken scroll halfway across China by now
You will never see that scroll, Tai Lung
Never
Never
77
Tai Lung is furious
He roars, ready to strike Shifu
Suddenly
(
) Hey
Tai Lung turns around to find Po standing in the doorway
(') (out of breath) Stairs
Tai Lung casts Shifu aside
Who are you
Buddy,  am the Dragon Warrior
(exhales hard) Huhhh
You
Him
(to Shifu) He's a panda
(back to Po) You're a panda
What are you gonna do, big guy
Sit on me
Don't tempt me
Haha
No
'm gonna use this
You want it
Come and get it
Po shows him the Dragon Scroll
From out of nowhere, Tai Lung appears and punches Po across the room, grabbing the scroll knocked from Po's hands
Finally
Po bounces off a nearby pillar and slams back into Tai Lung, sending him flying into a column
Po puts on a brave face and strikes a pose as Tai Lung recovers and charges
Po turns to run
Tai Lung quickly catches up and they both sail off the Palace steps
Po clings to the scroll as Tai Lung delivers a kick and sends him crashing onto the theater rooftops below
78
Po rolls down off a tree and uses the recoil to whip back and smash Tai Lung
He briefly skids across the rooftop and comes right back at Po
(') That scroll is mine
Down the Theater steps, Po and Tai Lung grapple for the scroll
Po is oblivious to the effects of crashing down stairs and in slow motion, his voluminous butt presses down on Tai Lung's head
As they crash through the Gateway the scroll is knocked loose
Tai Lung goes for the scroll but Po snatches it away using a noodle lasso
The scroll flies towards him and bounces off his head
Tai Lung leaps for it, but Po grabs his tail and pulls him back down onto a cart which see-saws Po into the air
In mid-air, Po slurps the noodle
Up and over the rooftops, Po lands in a grove of bamboo trees and into a nearby wok shop
The scroll rolls to a stop in the street
As Tai Lung makes his move on the scroll, Po turns the array of overturned woks into a shell game, sliding the woks around to hide the scroll
Lightning
Tai Lung knocks the woks away and exposes the scroll as Po uses his bamboo stilts to block Tai Lung
The leopard swipes out the stilts and brings Po down on top of him as the scroll rolls down the steps towards the river
Po gets thrown into a fireworks booth
As Tai Lung chases down the scroll, he turns back to see Po flying through the fireworks-filled sky
Po slams through Tai Lung and crashes into a rock wall
The scroll flies out of his hand and lands in the mouth of an ornamental rooftop dragon
He looks back at Tai Lung, who sees where the scroll has landed
Via the magic of cookie- vision, Po effortlessly scales the building
Tai Lung is shocked
The scroll has given him power
(then) NOOO0
He takes a giant leap and kicks the wall
The resulting shockwave collapses the building
79
Amazingly, Po skips across the falling roof tiles to reach the scroll in mid-air as Tai Lung leaps up behind him and unleashes a punishing blow that sends Po smashing into the ground
As Tai Lung lands, he delivers a final devastating punch
As the dust settles, Tai Lung is looming over Po in the impact crater
(') (out of breath) Finally
oh yes
the power of the Dragon Scroll
is mine
Tai Lung grabs for the scroll and opens it
His face falls
(') It's
Po stirs
It's okay
didn't get it the first time either
(disbelief) What
Po gets to his feet
There is no secret ingredient
It's just you
Tai Lung snarls and lunges at Po
Tai Lung attacks Po's nerve points
But Po begins giggling
(') Stop
Stop it
'm gonna pee
Don't
Don't
Tai Lung's nerve attack has no effect on Po
Frustrated, he delivers a double-fisted punch to Po's belly
80
The shockwave ripples through Po's entire body and Po's arms come back and strike Tai Lung, sending the leopard crashing back into a building
Po looks at his hands, amazed at what he just did
Tai Lung rises from the rubble and runs at Po again
But Po strikes back, using an unorthodox panda-style technique, even getting Tai Lung to chomp down on his own tail
Po gives Tai Lung a butt bump that sends him crashing into a building
Tai Lung emerges and attempts one more lunge at Po
But Po prepares
and Tai Lung is swiftly met by Po's
He is launched into the air
Po waits
and waits
until finally, Tai Lung appears in the sky and crashes to the ground
Tai Lung is battered, but still defiant
(heavy breathing) You
can't defeat me
You're just a big, fat panda
Po grabs Tai Lung's finger
Tai Lung's eyes go wide
'm not a big, fat panda
'm the big, fat panda
Po's pinky pops up
Tai Lung gasps
The Wuxi Finger Hold
Oh, you know this hold
You're bluffing
You're bluffing
Shifu didn't teach you that
Nope
figured it out
He flexes his pinky
(') Skadoosh
-
81
mushroom cloud appears over the Valley, sweeping past the Furious Five and the fleeing villagers
: - Villagers emerge from hiding
Po walks out from the mist looking very much like the warrior from the opening dream
Look
The Dragon Warrior
As he nears, we see that his hat is an upside down wok and his scarf is a torn apron
Villagers  the Dragon Warrior
Po's Dad emerges from the crowd
' That's my boy
That big, lovely kung fu warrior is my son
Thanks, Dad
Po hugs his dad
The wok falls off Po's head and rolls on the ground until Mantis appears in frame and stops it
The rest of the Five are with him
Po takes notice
(') Hey, guys
Master
Tigress bows deeply
The others follow
Master
(modest) Master
(then, remembering) Master Shifu
Po races toward the Jade Palace
He climbs the steps
Then more steps
82
- Po arrives breathless at the Jade Palace
Shifu is still lying in the scroll room, his eyes closed
Po rushes to his side
Master
Shifu
Shifu
Are you okay
Shifu weakly opens his eyes
Po
You're alive
(then, darkly) Or we're both dead
No, Master,  didn't die defeated Tai Lung
You did
Shifu smiles and shakes his head in disbelief
(') Wow
It is as Oogway foretold -- You are the Dragon Warrior
You have brought peace to this Valley
And to me
Thank you
Thank you, Po
Thank you
Shifu closes his eyes
He is still
Po starts freaking out
No
Master
No No No
Don't die, Shifu
Please
(eyes snapping open) 'm not dying, you idiot-- ah, Dragon Warrior
'm simply at peace
Finally
Oh
So, um,  should
stop talking
If you can
Po nods reverently as Shifu closes his eyes again
Master and pupil lie next to each other
The camera pulls up and back away from them
Po tries to remain still, but it's hard
83
He's about to say something, but he stops himself
He fidgets for a beat, then can't control himself any longer
Want to get something to eat
(sighs) Yeah
