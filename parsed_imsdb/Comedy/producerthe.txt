It's better
Please, Lambchop, it's better

Just a little

So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo

How can  drive when you drive me mad

Pull over

That's enough
We'll do the rest on Thursday

Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench

Goodbye, my angel

Hey, uh

(eagerly) Yes
Oh, Angelcake, you forgot to give me the check
Can't produce a play without money, ha, ha, ha

(opening her handbag and reaching inside) Of course, the check,  had it with me all the time
don't know what's happening to me
must be getting old
Is it all right
made it out to cash
You didn't tell me the name of the play

(to Bloom, quietly) Have you been there all this time
And did you see and hear everything
Then what do you have to say for yourself
Uh

What do you want
Why are you loitering in my hallway
Speak, dummy, speak
Why don't you speak
Scared
Can't talk

All right
Get a hold of yourself
Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are
(breathes deeply
Words tumble from his mouth as he exhales) 'm Leo Bloom, 'm an accountant, 'm from Whitehall and Marks,  was sent here to do your books and 'm terribly sorry  caught you with the old lady
(he has run out of breath) "Caught you with the old lady
" Come in, Mr
Tact
' So you're an accountant, eh
(timidly) Yes sir
Then account for yourself
Do you believe in God
Do you believe in gold
Why are you looking up old lady's dresses
Bit of a pervert, eh
,       , Sir,
Never mind
Never mind
Do the books
They're in that desk over there
Top drawer

How dare you condemn me without knowing all the facts
But sir, 'm not condem
Shut up
'm having a rhetorical conversation
(to himself) How humiliating
Max Bialystock
Max Bialystock
You know who  used to be
Max Bialystock
The King of Broadway
Six shows running at once
Lunch at Delmonico's
Two hundred dollar suits
Look at me
Look at me now
'm wearing a cardboard belt
used to have thousands of investors begging, pleading, to put their money into a Max Bialystock production
(' ,  ') Look at my investors now
Voila
(gestures at pictures) Hundreds of little old ladies stopping off at Max Bialystock's office to grab a last thrill on the way to the cemetery
' 14
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect
One Two
Do the books
Do the books
(sighing) Yes, sir
Thank you

(to himself) Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there

white Rolls Royce
That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it
(off screen) Koff, koff
ahem, ahem
harrumph
15
assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention
Am  correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people
have hurt your feelings
Good, what is it
Sir, may  speak to you for a minute
(looking at his watch) Go
You have fifty-eight seconds
Well, sir, it seems
(interrupting) You have forty-eight seconds left
Hurry
Hurry
(speedily) In looking at your books, 've discovered that
(interrupting) Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time
, Mr
Bialystock,  cannot function under these conditions
You're making me extremely nervous
16
What is that
handkerchief
It's nothing
nothing
, '
If it's nothing, why can't  see it
(shrieking in panic) My blanket
Give me my blue blanket
,  , Here, don't panic
(clutching his blanket) 'm sorry
don't like people touching my blue blanket
It's not important
It's a minor compulsion
can deal with it if  want to
It's just that 've had it ever since  was a baby and
and
find it very comforting
(to himself) They come here
They all come here
How do they find me
(recovering his dignity) Mr
Bialystock
Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you
17
This is hardly a time for levity
've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play
Where
What
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000
But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand
There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for
went to a Turkish bath, who cares
The show was a flop
What difference does it make
It makes a great deal of difference
That's fraud
If they found out, you could go to prison
Why should they find out
It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around
You can do it
You're an accountant
The word 'count' is part of your title
(aghast) But that's cheating
It's not cheating
It's charity
Bloom, look at me
look at me
'm drowning
Other men sail through life
Bialystock has struck a reef
Bloom, 'm going under
am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all  can offer is failure
Bloom, 'm reaching out to you
Don't send me to jail
Help
Help
18
'  , , Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear
(faintly) Help
All right
'll do it
'll do it
Thank you, Bloom
knew  could con you
Oh, it's all right
wha
Nothing
Nothing
Do it
Do it
(pouring over the accounts) Now let's see, two thousand dollars
That isn't much
'm sure  can hide it somewhere
After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped
Yes
Right
Good thinking
You figure it out
'm tired
'm gonna take a little nap
(crossing to couch) Wake me if there's a fire
Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get
-  ' 19
(musing to himself) Heh, heh, heh, amazing
It's absolutely amazing
But under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit
'
Yes
Yes
It's quite possible
If he were certain the show would fail, a man could make a fortune
'     , , Yes
' (at a loss) Yes, what
What you were saying
Keep talking
What was  saying
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit
(smiling) Yes, it's quite possible
You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how
How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit
20
,  , It's simply a matter of creative accounting
Let us assume, just for the moment, that you are a dishonest man
Assume away
Well, it's very easy
You simply raise more money than you really need
What do you mean
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale
What did  do
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play
So what
What did it get me
'm wearing a cardboard belt
Ahhhhhh
But that's where you made your error
You didn't go all the way
You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce
Exactly
And how long did it run
One night
21
See
You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest
But what if the play was a hit
Oh, you'd go to jail
If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha
So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop
What scheme
What scheme
Your scheme, you bloody little genius
Oh, no
No
No
meant no scheme
merely posed a little, academic accounting theory
It's just a thought
Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts
Don't you see, Bloom
Darling, Bloom, glorious Bloom, it's so simple
Step one:  We find the worst play in the world -- a sure flop
Step two:   raise a million dollars -- there's a lot of little old ladies in this world
Step three:  You go back to work on the books
Phoney lists of backers -- one for the government, one for us
You can do it, Bloom, you're a wizard
() 22
(') Step four:  We open on Broadway and before you can say 'step five' we close on Broadway
Step six:  We take our million dollars and fly to Rio de Janiero
(sings) "Ah, Rio, Rio by the seao, meo, myo, meo
" (afraid of the scheme, afraid of the dance, afraid of Bialystock) Mr
Bialystock
No
Wait
Please
You're holding me too tight
'm an honest man
You don't understand
(leading Bloom as he talks) No, Bloom, you don't understand
This is fate, this is destiny
There's no avoiding it
,
(the back of his head practically touching the floor) Mr
Bialystock, not more than five minutes ago, against my better judgment,  doctored your books
That, sir, is the ultimate extent of my criminal life
,      , 23
(to himself) Oh,  fell on my keys
(he shifts slightly to make himself more comfortable) 've got to get out of here
(angrily hovering over Bloom) You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar
Don't you ever want to become a butterfly
Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory
(his eyes widened in terror) You're going to jump on me
You're going to jump on me
know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea
(nonplussed) What
(by now he is shrieking) Poppea
She was his wife
And she was unfaithful to him
So he got mad and he jumped on her
Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug
Please don't jump on me
(shouting and jumping up and down next to Bloom) 'm not going to jump on you
(rolling away in terror) Aaaaaaaaaa
24
(hoisting Bloom to his feet) Will you get a hold on yourself
(up on his feet and running for cover) Don't touch me
Don't touch me
What are you afraid of
'm not going to hurt you
What's the matter with you
'm hysterical
'm having hysterics
'm hysterical can't stop
When  get like this, can't stop
'm hysterical
'
'm wet
'm wet
'm hysterical and 'm wet
' , (holding his face) 'm in pain
And 'm wet
And 'm still hysterical
No
No
Don't hit
It doesn't help
It only increases my sense of danger
What can  do
What can  do
You're getting me hysterical
Go away from me
You frighten me
(he indicates the sofa) Sit over there
25
(exasperated) Okay
'm way over here
Is that better
It's a little better, but you still look angry
How's this
(he smiles sweetly) Good
Good
That's nice
That's very nice
think 'm coming out of it now
Yes
Yes
'm definitely coming out of it
Thank you for smiling
It helped a great deal
(for want of something sensible) Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you
"  Heh, heh
(to himself) The man should be in a straight jacket
(to Bloom) Feeling better
Much, thank you
But  am a little lightheaded
Maybe  should eat something
Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know
They certainly do
They certainly do
Come, let me take you to lunch
That's very kind of you, Mr
Bialystock, but
26
(interrupting) Nonsense, nonsense, my dear boy lowered your blood sugar, but least could do is raise it a little
And  promise you faithfully, won't discuss that silly scheme to make a million dollars anymore

Don't you like Coney Island

What kind now, Leo

Achhh, those were the days
Vat good times ve had
Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing
You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer
Really,  never dreamed

Such filthy lies
But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they
Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie

Couldn't even say Nazi
He would say Narzis, Narzis
Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis
But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill

(his eyes flashing flirtatiously) Do you really think it brings out my eyes
(irritated) We can't tell a thing without your wig
As far as 'm concerned, you're only half-dressed
Ummmm

How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business
Please, please, that's what we're here for
(to Carmen, who is adjusting the wig) Be careful, that hurt
think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger
Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and
Yes
Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns
Two-three-kick-turn
Turn- turn-kick-turn
It's enough to make you throw up
At last a chance to do straight drama
To deal with conflict, with inner truth
Roger De Bris presents history
Of course,  think we should add a little music
That whole third act has got to go
They're losing the war
It's too depressing
We'll have to put something in there
(gripped by his vision) Aaahghhh
see it

Two-three-kick-turn
Turn-turn- kick-turn
That's genius
