href <b>// --> </b> "  -  " by Mike Judge and Joe Stillman The movie begins with scenes of people screaming in horror and running down the streets of a big city
The ground shakes from what seems like giant footsteps
There are pieces of building debris falling everywhere, people getting crushed, power lines coming down, etc
- complete pandemonium
It all looks very much like a Japanese animated King-Kong or Godzilla movie
We hear the footsteps getting closer and the ground shaking becomes more intense - more debris falling
Then we see a come into frame and smash a National Guard truck
As we pan up, we see the white socks, then the red shorts, the / - shirt, then we hear the familiar, "Huh huh huh
" - only it's a huge sound
this is a -   -
"Butt- Kong" continues his path of destruction - stomping on cars and buildings and saying, "This is cool
Huh huh huh
" Airplanes and tanks start firing at Butt-Head (Butt-Kong)
He looks irritated and says, "Cut it out butt-munch
" Butt-Head swats at the planes, sending them crashing to the ground and stomps on the tanks
Then, something catches his eye
Butt-Head reaches into a skyscraper and picks up a nice looking woman - a lot like the one from the King Kong movie
He looks down at her in his hand and goes wide-eyed, "Whoa
Huh huh huh
" The woman screams in terror as Butt-Head looks down at her and tries a few lame pick up lines
"Uuuuh
Hey baby
'm like, pretty tall
Huh huh huh
" He swats down a helicopter that is circling his head, "Dammit, 'm trying to score
" The helicopter goes down in flames
We   some guys sitting on a tank firing at him
They notice giant footsteps coming from the other direction and turn the tank around
Through their binoculars we see a - coming from the horizon
The giant Beavis is even more destructive than Butt-Kong (maybe he could be breathing fire)
Beavis starts trying to pick up on Butt-Head's woman
Butt-Head puts the woman down and he and Beavis begin to go at it, leveling the city with one of their stupid juvenile smack-fights
We - from three-hundred foot Beavis shaking Butt-Kong to Butt-Head asleep on the couch with Beavis shaking him
&'  - (
) Butt-Head
Butt-Head
Hey, Butt-Head
Butt-Head is dead asleep on the couch
Beavis shakes him
Butt-Head, wake up, wake up
Butt-Head comes around
- Dammit, Beavis,  was about to score
Huh huh
Yeah, but check it out
It's gone
- What's gone
The
Beavis is making  , in a state of shock
Butt-Head rubs his eyes and looks at the empty space where the was
- Uuuuuuh, huh huh
Uuh,
Out the window, we see two   carrying &'s  into their van
Still on the couch, Butt-Head looks over at the broken window
We see a  lying on the floor, and the front door left open
Butt-Head looks at the  , at the , the , then back at the   where the  was
He does this a couple of times - piecing it all together
- (
) Whoa
think  just figured something out Beavis
What
- This sucks
Yeah, heh heh
Beavis is still in shock
They both stare at the empty space where the  was for a beat, not quite sure what to do
Beavis is
He presses buttons on the remote a few times, as if it might help somehow
- This sucks more than anything that has ever sucked before
We must find this butt-hole that took the
- Bad neighborhood
70's music blares

Punks run in fear
Beavis hops out of the driver's seat, wearing bell-bottoms, chain jewelry and a 70's afro
Into a dramatic -, he takes off his glasses

Beavis whips out a huge gun
Freeze, butt-wipe
An attacker comes from one side

Another tosses a knife

In -, Beavis smiles for an  shot
Butt-Head does the same
Beavis, in a rooftop fight, kicks his opponent over the edge
beautiful woman, back to us, takes off her dress for Butt-Head
Butt-Head and the woman fall into bed
Suddenly
/
- From inside,  of equipment crashing
& come out wheeling a  on one of those carts
There are cables attached to it still leading back into the
room
As they push the cart we hear more equipment falling
- Dammit, it's stuck
They give it one big push and it finally breaks free
We see that the cables are tangled with cables from other TVs and VCRs, which all come crashing to the ground
- (
) Huh huh huh
That was cool
Yeah, heh heh
Let's just wheel this thing back to the house

Ah, excuse me boys

Huh huh
Yeah, heh heh
He's a anus
Heh heh

They lamely attempt to let it slowly down the steps
The cart is too top-heavy and goes tumbling to the bottom of the stairs, shattering the

sure hope we can get the 'fridge fixed before we leave
Now Marcy, we've been savin' for this trip our whole lives and we're gonna go come Hell or high water
Through the camper walls, we hear the faint sound of & /- "
" (
) What the hell is that noise

Beavis gets up, goes to the refrigerator and grabs a soda
The refrigerator is under the counter on which the  is sitting
Beavis takes a sip and then does a  , This crap is warm

Butt-Head is bug-eyed
Beavis has the shakes bad, arms folded like Dustin Hoffman in "Midnight Cowboy
" Nnnnooo
Oooooh nooooo
- What's your problem Beavis

Now
Butt-Head stops short
He looks up
His face is bathed in a golden, throbbing light
-'
: We see a flashing neon sign that says, ""
Pull back to show & are standing outside the Elite Motel Lodge, featuring "Color " and "Air-Cooled Rooms", with "Special Nap Rates

McVicker hears and looks up
McVICKER (
) Beavis and Butt-Head

Butt-Head closes the door, laughing, and starts to walk towards the next door
The muffled sound of a  can be heard followed by McVicker asking for another
- Huh huh huh
That was cool
Dammit

We're missing everything
- The only light in the room is a flickering
Sitting on the bed, talking on the phone is
He's a tough, mean looking red-neck - a Jack Ruby type
On the nightstand next to him is a three-quarter drunk bottle of bourbon and a manila envelope
On his lap is a big gun
Are you sure these guys can pull this off
It's gotta look like an accident
We hear a knock on the door and muffled & laughs
(
) Hold on a minute
That must be them now

(Hangs up phone)
Come in
& walk in
Muddy turns on the light
(sounding suddenly sedated) Aaaah

Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez

Beavis
That's alright

Huh huh
That's right

Butt-Head stares in shock
Actually, we just wanna watch
- Shut up Beavis
Uh, yeah

Butt-Head  Beavis and pulls him aside
- Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us to score with his wife
And he's gonna pay us
We can buy a new
Oh, heh heh really
Cool
Heh heh
- (to Muddy) Uh, huh huh

Okay, then let's get down to business
Muddy slaps down a picture of , his wife
Leather clad, biker, beautiful
(
) Here she is
Her name's Dallas
She ain't as sweet as she looks
She stole everything from me
Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her
- Whoa, huh huh
Cool
Muddy plunks down
She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags
Your flight leaves in a couple of hours
Now c'mon, 'll drive you to the airport
- Holed up
Huh huh huh
Holed
Can we watch some  first
Muddy picks up the gun and  the
No
- Muddy driving his loud four-by-four like a maniac, drunk with bloodshot eyes
& are in the back seat
He eyes them through the rearview
Meanwhile, a cat bounces off the windshield with a One more thing
Mah wife's got this leather satchel
It's black, about this big

It's real important
Sentimental value
Any questions so far
- Uh, yeah

(spastic) Yeah, heh heh

Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh
Huh huh
You guys are funny
Let's have a drink on it
Muddy swigs the last swallow from his bottle of bourbon
- In an overhead view, the four-by-four screeches up to the gate, fishtails to a stop, throwing & onto the sidewalk, and peels away
- We're gonna get paid to score
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen
Heh heh
- Beavis, this is the greatest day of our lives
Huh huh huh
- & enter the plane
They sit down in the first two seats on the right - in First Class
flight attendant,  approaches them
Hi
Can  help you find your seats
- Uuh, nah
These seats are
think your tickets have you seated in row fourteen, coach
So why don't you just go ahead and move back,
- That's
Someone else can have those
Yeah, it's not that important to me, really
Those seats are too small anyways
Doloris yanks them out of their seats and leads them down the aisle
in coach
Doloris stops by a row where an elderly woman, , sits by the window
Next to her: Two empty seats
Here you are
She gestures to the seats and leaves
Beavis climbs in the middle, Butt-Head in the aisle - still watching Doloris
- Hey Beavis
When she was leading us down here, huh huh, she touched my butt
Huh huh huh
Martha, her senses a bit dimmed from age, turns to &
Hello there
Are you two heading for Las Vegas
Yeah, we're gonna score
hope to score big there myself
'm mostly going to be doing the slots
Yeah, 'm hoping to do some sluts too
Heh heh
Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin
Whoa
heh heh
Hey Butt-Head, this chick is pretty cool
She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas
Heh heh heh
- Cool
Huh huh huh
It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered
Yeah, heh heh
'm gonna have money, and a big-screen  and sluts everywhere
Oh, that's nice
'  (
) (through
) Good morning
This is your captain speaking
Welcome aboard flight 151 non-stop to Las Vegas
We ask that you turn your attention to the front of the cabin for pre-flight safety instructions
& see Doloris, stepping nearby to demonstrate the seat belt
' To fasten your seat belt, insert the free end into the coupling
- Insert
Huh huh huh
Doloris demonstrates
& are dumbfounded
It's too complicated
- (
) Uh
They struggle to make their seat belts fit, getting each other's parts
(
) Hi, 'm Tammy
Can  help you with that
Butt-Head looks up
From his
we see a beautiful woman, , smiling, her hands reaching down
/   plays
on Butt-Head's lap as two female hands reach down and pull one strap from between Butt-Head's legs
Butt-Head looks down at his lap as Tammy leans over him
loud can be heard
Butt-Head stares blankly
(
) There you go
You're all set
- (stunned) love you
Suddenly Martha buckles Beavis' belt
Tammy goes
Wait,  wanted her to do it
- Huh huh
Soon, she will be mine
' Flight attendants, please prepare for take-off
The engines start to hum
The plane is rolling
Butt-Head struggles to get his seat belt off
He does everything but pull the handle
Beavis goes white with fear
The plane starts to shake
The engines rumble
Beavis starts to freak
Hey wait a minute
What's going on
Butt-Head bangs away at his seat belt
Beavis looks out the window and realizes they're in the air
(
) (screams) Aaaagh
We're gonna die
&: 'ya hear that
Something must be wrong
Oh my God
, people start screaming
The plane quakes, lifting up
-, furiously pulling: - Dammit
Huh huh
That chick wants me
Aggghg
We're gonna die
We're all gonna die
The plane arcs upward
Butt-Head finally gets the belt off as the plane is in full thrust
He rises and goes tumbling backward down the aisle
seeing Butt-Head flying, screaming in panic
In free fall: Butt-Head grabs the door to the hangable luggage
It all comes tearing out
Butt-Head flies up, hitting several overhead luggage racks, which open and spill their contents
Butt-Head lands in the galley, causing food to go flying and coffee to pour freely
as the plane starts to level out
People stop their screaming
-, underneath the rubble, poking his head out
He's directly across from the flight attendant station where Tammy is strapped in
- Uh, huh huh
could you, like, do that thing with my belt again
- All's in order
Flight attendants roll the beverage cart up the aisle
People read, relaxed
Martha is showing pictures of her grandchildren
Beavis is showing the picture of Dallas that Muddy gave him
'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down
You'll have to speak up son
have this ringing in my ears
My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations
've had two operations on my heart
Really
poop too much
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant
Uh
No, (louder)  poop too much
Then get tired
Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these
She hands him a box of NoDrowz
(
) They perk me right up
Heh heh, thanks
He pours the contents into his hand and chews them like candy
Then his eyes open wide
(
) (strange) Uh, tastes like crap
Heh heh
Mmmmm
Beavis starts wolfing them down
- Tammy passes out meals from a rolling cart
She works with Doloris
Butt-head stands behind Tammy, attempting to hit on her
- (to Tammy) So, uh huh huh, are you going to Las Vegas
Huh huh huh
Tammy ignores him and moves on, leaving Butt-Head there
-, looking down at something
to reveal he's looking at a  on a fat guy's tray
The guy's asleep
Butt-head picks up the beer
, nearby
The NoDrowz is starting to take effect
Beavis starts shaking, babbling, staring cross-eyed at his fist, etc
(pre-Cornholio stuff) Tammy reaches her next passenger
Hi, we're serving dinner
Our selections tonight are chicken piccata or seafood gumbo
(
) Piccata
Piccata
Picattatta tatta
Tammy moves forward, leaving Butt-Head standing there
In the background, we see Beavis starting to quake, on the verge of Cornholio mode
Does the gumbo have corn in it
: Turned, facing the cabin, -shirt pulled over his head in full Cornholio mode
am Cornholio
need picatta for my bunghole
You'll have to wait your turn sir
Are you threatening me
My bunghole will not wait
Beavis starts to wander down the aisle
Beavis enters
From the other side,  of screams
We hear several   being pressed
-
He approaches Tammy from behind
She ignores him
- Uh,  got a beer
Want some
Huh huh
The  are relaxed and settled in when the door to the cockpit slams open
Beavis is in the doorway
Bargarajjjaaaahhh
am Cornholio
The pilots
The copilot jumps up so fast he causes coffee to spill everywhere, including on the captain's lap
The captain then jumps up, hitting the controls and -
- In the back of the plane standing next to Tammy
He starts to take a sip of beer
The nose-dive of the plane causes Butt-Head to go - Huh huh
Butt-Head bounces all overthe plane and then gets tangled up in the curtain that separates first class and coach
It tears off, and he continues to fly forward
The captain is desperately trying to regain control of the plane
Butt-Head slams into the cockpit, landing on the control panel facing the captain
Get the hell out of the cockpit
- Huh huh, you said
The captain throws Butt-Head back behind him and pulls the plane out of the dive
- The plane lands
- The flight attendants, shaken, smile at a line of people deplaning
The people are white with fear, some covered with flecks of spilled food and other matter
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
They grow silent and still as & pass by
Beavis takes the - shirt off his head, coming down from Cornholio
- Huh huh huh
That was cool
/  - Arriving passengers are greeted
family is reunited
Two businessmen walk up to limo drivers holding cards with their names
reunited couple hugs
& look around in confusion
- Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas
Yeah, heh heh
thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff
People greet and walk away
The place starts to clear out
One limo driver is left standing
He wears sunglasses and holds a sign that reads: Beavis and Butt-Head
& look around
Except for the driver, they're alone
(
) Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign
- Uh
maybe he's blind
Huh huh, check this out
& go up to him
Butt-Head turns around, drops his pants and hangs a "
" at the guy
& Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh
Ah, excuse me
You wouldn't know where can find these guys, would ya
He indicates the sign
Butt-Head turns around and pulls up his pants
They look and try to read: - (reads) Uh,
No, uh,
(reads) Uh
Buuuuut
Boot
Someone named boot
- (realizes) Huh huh
This says Beavis
And Boot-Head
- That's Butt-Head
Don't you get it, Beavis
These dudes have the same name as us
Yeah, we should party
The limo driver rolls his eyes and walks away
This way, sirs
& follow the driver away
Beavis looks around
So where's those guys
'   - and , the two dumb-looking rough-necks that stole &'s are standing outside Muddy's motel room
Harlan knocks on the door
Where the hell is he
You sure this is the right place
Harlan looks through the window and sees the shattered
No one's there
Muddy's four-by-four  into the lot and skids to a stop next to Harlan and Ross' van
Muddy gets out, looking really drunk now
(
) You Muddy
(slurring) You the cops
Uh, no
Earl sent us
You know, to take care of your wife
Muddy grabs Ross by the collar
What the hell
What about those other
Huh
Muddy tosses Ross to the sidewalk and starts back to they four-by- four
Dammit
She did it to me again
Hey,  noticed your  was broken
You wanna buy a new one
Muddy gets in the four-by-four and starts it
'm gonna go to Vegas and kill all three a' them
Harlan and Ross seem momentarily confused
Muddy revs the engine, peels out backwards This causes &'s  and some other loot to spill out the back onto the sidewalk
Ross starts to pick it up
Just leave it
Worthless piece o' crap
Yeah, really
We gotta start stealin' from rich people
- Note:  would like this to be a well-known band (Red Hot Chili Peppers) doing their best imitation of a modern Las Vegas lounge act
think a song like "What Am  Gonna Do With You" by Barry White or something obnoxious like "Bicostal" by Peter Allan would be cool
Or maybe Sinatra's "You Make Me Feel So Young" would be best
The car passes by major hotels and tourist sights, finally pulling up to a big luxurious hotel and casino
/ - Establishing shots
Excitement
Gambling tables going on forever
playing the song we've been hearing
They should vaguely resemble the actual band doing the song
rows of slot machines
handling cards and chips
&, staring in utter awe
: They're staring at a huge Roman statue of a bare-chested woman
Their faces are blank
They're seeing God
Finally: - Beavis

Billboards and signs are lighting up
The whole strip is coming alive
Pure excitement

He tries to pull it up and can't
This remote's too heavy
Sir, it's attached to the
- Here, dumbass

They both struggle to pull it up
Finally, they fall over backwards
Annoyed, the bellboy leaves
/9TH  - The elevator arrives

There's several sophisticated people
From inside, a computerized   : Ninth floor, going down
& Huh huh huh huh huh huh
- Going down
Huh huh huh
The sophisticated people look repulsed
The doors close

Beavis pulls one of the playing chips out of his pocket and bites into it
Ow
These chips suck
- What a rip-off
Come on
We gotta find that chick
Beavis tosses the chip on a roulette table
The ball lands on 13
At the table, the

Staring
- Huh huh huh
That chick was talking about doing it
Heh heh
This is the best night of our lives

Tourists watch from tables - decidedly not rocking out

Good evening
Room service
How may help you
From the phone
& (on phone) Huh huh huh huh huh
The woman's disturbed
Hello
Hello
/ - & try to climb up and grab the gigantic boobs of the statue
Butt-Head falls, knocks Beavis off and they both hit the floor hard
&'   - Beavis is on the phone in the main room
Butt-Head sits on the toilet and speaks from the phone in the bathroom
- Uh, huh huh, 'd like to be serviced
in my room
& Huh huh huh huh huh huh

The song rings out
&'  - BEavis is picking up the night table by the remote attached to it and moving the whole thing
Butt-Head approaches a door next to the bed
- Uh,  wonder where this door goes to
Beavis comes over to check it out
Butt-Head opens the door
It's one of those double doors to the next room
Butt-Head tries to open the second door, jiggling it
Suddenly, the door opens
Someone reaches out and pulls & inside
It's , the girl Muddy sent them after
' /  - She has them pinned against the wall

That is a lot of money
Maybe if we close our eyes and pretend he's a chick
Butt-Head  Beavis, bringing him to his senses
From outside,  of a police siren
Dallas goes to the window
The place is being surrounded by police and plain black cars
(panics) Damn
You boys, you wait right there
Dallas goes into the next room and closes the door
& look at each other
They start to take their pants off
- Huh huh huh

She picks up the pants, getting an idea
You wait here
She takes the pants into the next room

Me first
- Huh huh
No way, dude
' /  - her black satchel
From it she lifts a delicate electronic device, the -5 unit, about the size of a credit card
An  light blinks
Using her switchbalde, she cuts a hole in the back seam of Beavis' pants, creating a natural pocket
She carefully slides the unit in

It hits the wall and
Beavis charges Butt-Head

He walks with his assistant,   and another agent

So, are you going to tell us where it is or am  going to have to have Agent Hurley over there give you another cavity search

Ooh is that a promise
Look Mrs
Scum, we know who you are
Tell her Bork

Married to Muddy Grimes
You run a mom and pop arms smuggling ring
He tosses her some photos of her and Muddy
Oh, you got my bad side
Bork hands Flemming another file
Flemming checks it
Three days ago you pulled a job at the Army Research Facility in Hadley, Nevada - where you stole
(reads) The -5 unit
Now we happen to know you had the unit with you when you checked in here, so why don't you be a good girl and tell us where it is
You gonna charge me with anything
(pause) didn't think so
You wanna let me go now or wait 'till my lawyer files a wrongful arrest

She smiles

So, like, where is she

Over 40 thousand cubic tons of concrete were used in the construction of the Hoover Dam

Talk ta me, Bork
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived
Did you give him a full cavity search
(confused) Ah, the witness
Yes
You can never be too careful Bork
Well sir,  didn't really think it was necessary
You see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam
Here, have a look
still of & laughing on the elevator
(
) They look like a couple of kids chief
Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of
Don't you read the papers
Suddenly the lights blink on and off
All three men look up
/  - We see a bank of  monitors, video of water, turbines, etc
Beavis is rubbing his butt against a switch on the console, causing the lights to blink on and off
- Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing
My butt's bothering me
- You should kick your butt's ass
Huh huh huh
Butt-Head looks at the bank of monitors - all showing water
- (
) Dammit, all they have is shows about water
That sucks
Heh heh
They need some shows about fire
Change the channel
- Uh
Butt-Head starts randomly hitting controls everywhere while Beavis rubs his butt against a computer keypad
:  "Main Water Release Valve"
Butt-Head turns it
An alarm sounds
Yeah, turn it up
Louder
Heh heh
- An alarm sounds
Giant doors open, causing water to start to flood through the gates

His hand is near the biggest switch for: "Master Station Control"

Ter
Huh huh
Masturbation, huh huh
Butt-Head throws the switch
Lights go out

Yeah, fire
Fire

- In succession, one set of lights after another goes out
The famous strip goes dark

The hell's going on

Whoooooops
- Marcy Anderson hammers the last peg in for their tent
Tom checks the stew on the fire and looks around

This here is God's country
Unspoiled and
rumbling interrupts him
He and Marcy turn to see: wall of water, heading for them
(
) Aaaaghhh
They're smashed by the flood
- Mass chaos
Traffic jams
Honking horns
People shouting
&   , about to get on the bus
- That was boring
Huh huh
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again

We can't leave Washington 'till we find that chick
Oh, we're a long ways from Washington Bob

People scream in the dark
Some steal chips and run

They got on that tour bus
It was probably heading west
Please
Muddy slams him against the wall and walks away
'm gonna kill 'em
- The doors close on the tour bus
It pulls out and drives away
- At her car, Dallas watches the bus from a distance, then lays down her binoculars, satisfied
You boys better show up
With a look at the Fed car behind her, she gets in her car and drives down a different road

Flemming's there with his agents
Flemming leans forward
You see what  see, Bork
see it
don't get it
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away
(realizes) Cut the power
Damn right
Bork, we're dealing with real pros here
My opinion, terrorists
What's the scoop on that stolen unit
Well, sir it's not good
(to an assistant) Roll the tape
The -5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus
The device that was put in back of Beavis' pants
(
) The deadliest known to man
It could wipe out five states in five days
It can be activated by simply entering the right code
Here's what happened when it was tested on a group of Army recruits
Army recruits coughing up black gunk, rolling around in pain on stretchers, dying
Grotesque (but funny)
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ
If this were to fall into the wrong hands
It gets worse
The unit wasn't finished
It has a flaw - the casing
If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus
murmuring through the room
Flemming rises and holds up a picture of &
Okay People, as of right now these are the most dangerous men in America
want these faces in front of every Fed and two- bit sheriff within a thousand miles
The orders are dead or alive
Let's just pray that nothing hits that unit

Ow
Cut it out Butt-Head

Get out of the way, Beavis, wanna sit by the window
Huh huh
Ow

You mean like this
Butt-Head keeps kicking
Okay, people, next stop, Grand Canyon

Old Faithful here is one of the largest
During an eruption the water can reach as high as two hundred feet
- So
(ignoring Butt-Head) It shoots out over twelve thousand gallons of water in a single eruption
That's not that much
- Yeah really
Let's get outta here Beavis
Huh huh huh
This sucks
& walk off as the flustered ranger leads the seniors to some benches where they wait for the geyser to erupt

The seniors watch in sheer awe
It's

Butt-Head moves to the side, tripping a motion detector which makes the urinal Whoa
That's amazing
Heh heh heh
They start moving from urinal to urinal, causing all to flush

The driver looks around impatiently
He checks his watch

Finally, Butt-Head pauses
- This is the coolest thing  have ever seen

Bork runs up
Chief, we got 'em

Butt-Head turns to the nun next to him

The nun looks disturbed as the bus takes off

Agents search the bus
Flemming walks nearby and is told: They're not on the bus
Flemming looks the seniors over

Everyone
Go deep on 'em
Hurley and two agents grab the nearest senior and drag him away

Damn smart
They're probably a hundred miles away by now

There's this talking snake and a naked chick and then this dude puts a leaf on his schlong
Heh heh heh
The nun next to Beavis is disgusted

It's a sperm cell with the face of Beavis on it
/ Yeah, heh heh
This is gonna be cool
Beavis/Sperm swims over to the egg
With its own tail the Beavis/Sperm starts picking its nose
/ (
) Hey, how's it goin'
Heh heh heh
Several other sperm charge in, knocking Beavis into the egg
His conception looks like a dumb accident
: Yeah, heh heh  scored
Animated bubbles appear around Beavis' head
(
) Hey Butt-Head, 'm starting to feel weird
think 'm freaking out
- Huh
Huh huh
Whoa, this is cool
Heh heh
It's like, everything looks all weird and

-: His face starts to warp and colors start shifting
(
) and
Whoa
and it's like there's all these weird shapes and it's sort of like,
it's like
like a
Tight on Beavis' face staring in wonder
/
It could even be so shameless as to actually have a chyron in the lower left hand corner
would like to have a band (White Zombie
) do a version of something like, "Fire," by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown
This is the song that begins, " am God of Hellfire and  bring you
fire
" The concept of this will depend somewhat on which band we get, but would like to see it get pretty wild and surreal
(If it's White Zombie, we could incorporate some of Rob Zombie's artwork
) '
: We see the sun above the horizon turn into a giant ball of fire
The ball of fire develops a face and speaks
am God of Hellfire and  bring you
(music begins) Fire
Whoa
This kicks ass
Out of the ball of fire steps a beautiful woman in a bikini
At first the video is mostly the God of Hellfire, chicks in bikinis and various images of &'s  in all its glory
As the video/hallucination continues, it becomes a psychotic mass of naked people, fire, TVs, vultures, & head-banging, weird stuff from my high school notebooks, etc
At one point we see the God of Hellfire in a Burger World uniform
As the song winds down, we incorporate Muddy's car into the surreal imagery
(We should also incorporate their , as well as maybe some of the characters from the show that aren't in the movie
) Then, we  Muddy's car actually pulling up to &'s near-dead bodies
The   as Muddy tosses water on &
they were not far from the side of a road all along
& Ahhhhghhhhgh

They rise and find Muddy hovering over them with a shotgun

Oh yeah

We're gonna meet her there and, you know, heh heh hmmm
Washington
That's where she was gonna meet up with ya
(realizes) Damn, she's goin' all the way
& Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh
Muddy lowers the gun a bit
You know,  just might need you after all
Aw right, in the trunk
You're gonna help me get mah unit back
Muddy pops it open
& climb in
Muddy closes the trunk on them and walks to the front of the car
- (
) Boy, it sure is hard to score
Huh huh huh
Muddy peels out
- Muddy drives by
:    snakes through a map to Santa Fe
: - Muddy's car drives by
Muddy hears & laugh from inside the trunk and turns up the radio to drown it out
:    snakes through a map to Oklahoma City
: - Muddy pumps gas
From inside the trunk: (
) Hey Butt-Head, look

Heh heh
- (
) Huh huh
Jack
Huh huh

81
'     - '
From within we hear: - (
) Hey, Beavis, check it out
'm jacking off
& Huh huh huh huh huh huh
Pumping up the jack, they cause the lid of the trunk to start to bend
Suddenly, it pops open
& are a sweaty mess
They gasp
- This sucks
Let's get outta here
They look out
The road behind them races past at 80 mph
Beavis stares dumbly
Uh, you first
- 'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground
It'll work
Okay
'll go right after you
Butt-Head shoves Beavis out of the car
(
) Ahhhhghghhghghgh
Beavis tries to run, but hits the road and flips over and over - and smashes his butt
(
) Owwwwww, my butt
His body stops in the middle of the road
huge truck, about to hit him, swerves and jackknifes over the side
Behind the truck, several cars screech to a halt, one smashing into the other
' Butt-Head looks at the road
- Huh huh huh huh huh
That was cool
'
It hits a pothole
-, shooting out of the trunk, he grabs onto the lid
He bounces against the road again and again
Finally, he loses his grip as the lid to the trunk closes
-, rolling along the highway
car, about to hit Butt-Head, screeches to a halt
Other cars behind it smash and pile up
On Tom and Marcy in their car
Boy, what  wouldn't give for five minutes alone with them two little bastards
The car ahead of Tom crashes into the car ahead of that
Tom crashes into it
And the car behind crashes into Tom
shows cars and trucks behind, crashing, piling up
massive pile-up
'  - Muddy doesn't notice the mess behind him
He drives on

Behind them, a  is on with the reporter continuing
Behind the reporter, & poke their heads into frame at 45 degree angles, looking like deer in the headlights

) Behind me, over 400 vehicles lay wrecked or stuck
No one knows what caused it, but police have not ruled out the possibility of terrorists
Bork notices & on  and taps Flemming on the shoulder
Flemming looks
Well, 'll be a blue-nosed gopher
(despairing) Where did these guys come from
Flemming looks at the big map which traces sightings of & across America
The question is, where are they going
He looks again at the
On the news, a story about

Flemming looks back at the map, and then back at the
What the hell
Bork
That bus we picked up
Where was it headin'

(realizing) Jesus jumped-up
Bork, can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital, or even worse, if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference

Dallas pulls up and gets out of her car
Suddenly, a voice: / 'Spectin' someone
Dallas wheels around
Muddy's got a gun on her
(
) Well, well
Look at this
The love of my life
Where have you been
Muddy moves towards Dallas
She steps back
Honey,  was gonna split it with you after sold it, right down the middle

Sure you were
But now you don't have to go through all that bother
Dallas moves seductively towards Muddy
Come on Muddy
Whatd'ya say we just forget about it and go get a room like old times
Muddy cocks his gun

) Say what

No honey we're gonna kill 'em
Dallas, still tied up, starts kissing Muddy
He gives in

Beavis pauses, still standing
Hey wait a minute

Why are we getting back on the bus
It's time to go son
We can't leave
We never met that chick
Dammit
We were supposed to get some
- Huh huh huh
Settle down Beavis
Oh yeah,

Not this time
Beavis is shaking, fed up
He delivers the speech of his life
(
) Dammit, this always happens

It's not fair
We've traveled a hundred miles 'cause we thought we were gonna score, but now it's not gonna happen
(yelling from his seat) Hey buddy, sit down

We're never gonna score

But not us
We're never gonna score
' The bus driver tackles Beavis

We hear the sound of a door opening
,
Well look what we have here
You two make me sick
Book 'em Bork
You don't have anything on us and you know it
Oh  don't huh
How about lewd conduct
Maybe indecent exposure
Here's what's gonna happen
One of you's gonna make a deal and get me the unit
The other can spend the next sixty years in jail
There you're wrong, boy
Me and mah wife are back together and you'll never
He stole the unit
Said he put it in some kid's pants
Why you damn little
He's cuffed and dragged away
- The driver sits down and drives on
Beavis is slightly beat up
Martha reaches into her purse, filled with prescription medications
Now Travis, it doesn't do a body good to get all worked up
Here
This should help you relax
She holds up a box of NoDrowz and squints at the label
Does that say Xanax
Um, um, yeah, probably
Heh heh
Beavis takes a couple, then starts wolfing down the whole box
'  - Flemming's on the radio
Bork checks a tour guide

Welcome to the White House

- What's your problem Beavis
The site for the White House was chosen by President Washington and Pierre 'Enfant
Beavis now has his -shirt pulled over his head and is pacing around and babbling
He's too loud now for Sandy to ignore
'enfentatta tiitatta for my bunghole

Beavis/Cornholio wanders off, muttering
/ In thees lobby, wheel there be

You don't understand
National security is at stake here

Two of them chat in Spanish

: We see Beavis/Cornholio wander down the hall (adjusting his glasses) Say, that looks like
Nah, it couldn't be
/     - Beavis comes around a corner and stops at a portrait of Nixon
Nixon doing classic victory pose - peace signs with both hands up
His hands also up in the Cornholio pose

The room is packed with reporters
Yes, the president does plan to speak today at the - conference

Secretary
Mr
Secretary
What about the rumors that a biological weapon has been stolen and smuggled out of the country at this conference
Mr
Secretary
Those rumors are entirely unfounded
While this goes on: Through a doorway in the back of the room, we see Beavis wander out of frame and then come back in

From the other end of the hallway we see Beavis/Cornholio enter, still babbling

He takes the picture of Dallas out of his pocket
the picture of Dallas
Anderson's camper

, nobody shoot
He could still have the unit on him
Keep your distance
We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it
Where are his pants
Who knows
Beavis reaches to scratch his butt
Agents step back, cautious
Flemming picks up a bullhorn and addresses Beavis
(
) This is Agent Flemming,

Tell us where the unit is

An agent comes out of the camper with the picture of Dallas
Bork grabs it and shows it to Tom
How do you explain this
Flemming approaches Tom
Sooo, using two innocent teenagers as pawns in your sick game, huh

This country owes you a debt
