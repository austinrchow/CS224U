Written by Peter Hewitt, William Osborne & Michael McCullers Animated scenes of the Thunderbirds on various rescues begin to play as some of the cast and crew names show up
From a secret island in the South Pacific, the courageous Tracy family run an organization called International Rescue
When disaster strikes, anywhere in the world, they are always first on the scene
They go by the name they gave their incredible machines, the Thunderbirds
(Counts down numbers and shows corresponding Thunderbirds) Five, four, three, two, one
Thunderbirds are go
Cuts to live action, Alan Tracy is looking out a school window
But in this family of heroes, there is one son left behind
So, gentlemen, we all know that A2 plus B2 equals
C2, that's right
But what happens when we bring in Leonardo Da Vinci's , and
(Teacher notices Alan looking out window and not paying attention to the lesson) Mr
Tracy
Alan
Alan
Alan's head jerks back from the window and to the teacher who is now standing in front of him
How kind of you to come back from outer space, Alan
trust re-entry wasn't too rough
(Chuckles sarcastically and continues sounding even more annoyed) Here on Earth we've been discussing the Pythagorean theorem
Did any of that happen to sink in
was just
Apparently not (she picks up his notebook which he has been doodling in) "Thunderbirds are go
" Well,  hope you aren't going anywhere special over spring break, Alan
Because  expect a 10,000 word paper on my desk the day you get back
That should keep you busy
Bells rings dismissing the students and Alan and Fermat walk out to their lockers
(mocking the teacher) "That should keep you busy
Yeah, well you can take your 10,000 words and stick them right up your
" Alan
Both boys turn around to see the headmaster approaching them while walking by with the teacher from before Headmaster
Mr
Tracy
Miss Garrett
You gotta be more careful Alan
Why can't  tell 'em 'm a Thunderbird Fermat
Because technically you're not a Thunderbirds yet
And if your identity was discovered, it would a d-d-di- it could be very bad
know,  know
It's the Thunderbirds
They're gonna be on
Let's go
They're gonna be on
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Where are they
In Russia, at an oil rig fire
Great
'm stuck at school and my brothers are on another cool mission
Wanna watch
Yeah
Boys go into a crowded room with a  on the news channel We are told this super-rig is now in danger of total collapse
And there is real concern for the lives of six men who remain trapped on board
An emergency call went out to the Thunderbirds just a few minutes ago
They should be here any moment now
(pauses and points at the sky while exclaiming excitedly) And here they are
The boys watching the  begin to cheer Thunderbird 2 this is Thunderbird 1
have visual, south column, they're trapped on an inspection platform
We'll take it from here
Come on
Come on
Scott, get out
That tower's coming down
Got it
blast of fire hits Thunderbird 1 and sends it a little farther away from the accident zone
Thunderbird 1 any damage
Negative, Dad
Come on, come on
Swing around
You can't get close enough, taking that approach angle
This approach angle's no good
Gonna have to swing her around
Watch the wind shear Thunderbird 2
Scotty,  was watching for wind shear when you were still wearing diapers
Come on, Dad
blast of fire comes toward Thunderbird 2 Whoa
Hold on
Who needs the diapers now, Dad
What do they do now
Probably drop the rescue platform from Thunderbird 2
Open 'em up
Here we go
Rescue platform's on its way
Virgil, how's it going
It's looking good, Dad
Come on
Jump
Okay, 've got a visual
Hold it there
Targets locked
Firing rescue lines
(Directed toward the crew members who he just fired the rescue lines toward) Come on, guys, hook 'em up
We gotta get you out of here
Alright, let's haul them out
Commencing reverse thrust
Okay, let's bring 'em home
Look out
(a couple of crew members bump into each other as they are hoisted up) Man they gotta get 'em out fast
That rig's gonna blow
Hang on
Boys watching the  gasp as the crew goes down back toward the water a little bit Whoa sorry, boys
Hold on tight
Here we go
Come on, Virgil
Hold on guys How you doing, son
Never better Thunderbird 1, commence knockdown procedure
, Thunderbird 2
(after pressing a bunch of buttons on his control panel) Lining up target
Fire
Bull's-eye
Outstanding shot
All right boys, let's take these babies home
As you can see the fire has been extinguished
The rocket fired from Thunderbird 1 has robbed it of the oxygen it needed to burn
Amazing
The Thunderbirds have done it again, Chuck
' The boys watching the  with Alan and Fermat begin cheering
That was great work, Lisa
Thanks a lot
(directed at Alan) Ooh,  wish  could be a Thunderbird one day
Thunderturd
The boys in the room "ooohh" and look at Alan for a response That's another good one, diaper boy
All the boys look at the Know It All Kid and laugh Tracy
(after finding Alan in the sea of boys he continues) There's someone here for you
Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, at your service
Alan darling, your father's been unexpectedly detained
And he's asked me to pick you up
Is that all right
Sure beats the bus
Definitely
Fantastic
Now, will any of these gorgeous young things be joining you
All of the boys raise their hands and shout for Alan to choose them
Just Fermat
Quite right
Lady Penelope, why are you in America
Are you on a mission for my father
Alan, shh
am an undercover agent, so please try to be discreet
(camera pans over to Lady Penelope's pink car with Parker, her butler waiting by the open door
) Here we are
Hi, Parker
Good afternoon, Master Hackenbacker
Hi, Nosey
Less of that attitude, or  shall be obliged to deliver the Parker Haymaker
Okay, bring it on, big guy
They are all in the car and Parker is driving away Try not to run over any children, Parker
Very good, milady
Come on, Parker, chop chop
Lady Penelope's begins to fly All right
Whoa
Yeah
the boys high five (reading a newspaper) Oh, look, Parker
Pink is the new black this season
'm very glad to hear it, milady
And hemlines are going up
That is good news, milady
Oh and apparently England won the football last night
Yes
Eng-er-land
(his hands go off the steering wheel and the car begins to move to one side) Whoa
Calm down, Parker
Yes, milady
Sorry, milady
San Francisco City Hospital California, parking lot
' Come on, baby
Out you jump
(Turns to her teenage son who has a pan stuck on his head) Wait till your father hears about this, panhead
They are walking toward the hospital entrance when she sees the lights of Thunderbird 2 Aliens
Even better
It's the Thunderbirds
, lock it up
Let's go
Let's move it
Hey, we need some help over here
Mission complete
Thunderbird 1 we are good to go
Mullion walks away from the others and fires a tracking goo at Thunderbird 1
Scene switches to a moving underwater submarine Tracking device, activated
Ah, the chariot of the gods
Having dallied with the mortals, they return to Olympus
And so  follow
Pardon me, milady
Approaching Tracy Island
And radar indicates we have some company
Thunderbird 1 and 2 pull up next to Lady Penelope's flying car and Scott waves at Alan before Alan turns to look at Thunderbird 2 where his father salutes at him
Thunderbird 1 then does a barrel roll around Thunderbird 2 before they both jet off toward the island, leaving Lady Penelope's car behind
Now, that's showing off
wish that was me
'm about to run post flight checks, Mr Tracy
Anything  sh-sh-sh- Anything you want to tell me
Brains,  noticed a build-up of vibration on Thunderbird 2, followed by illumination of the number 5 engine out light
Okay, Mr
Tracy, 'll ch-ch-ch-study the flight data and guidance processor
Dad
Alan
Let me look at you
He hold Alan at arm's length and then looks him over
He then looks over and sees his older sons approaching
Ah oh look out
Hey Sprout
ruffles his hair ruffles his hair Hey Buddy
Dinner's ready
Come and get it
Onaha, it smells delicious
am starved
So Dad,  saw the mission on
It looked dangerous
Saving lives is a dangerous business
But it's what we do
Do you think the fire was caused by thermal up draughts
mean that would explain the-- (Jeff cuts him off) Whoa, whoa, whoa, enough shop talk
want to hear about school
School's boring
Plus 've been thinking, maybe  could be home-educated now
That way,  could sit in on missions from time to time
What do you think
No short cuts, Alan
No school, no rockets
Say, why aren't you wearing your retainer
So 'm getting the reading telling me that the wind is blowing 60 knots, right up my keister
No kidding
Did you try readjust the flaps
Well that's the first thing  did, Sprout
It's not my first day in a Thunderbird you know
Try and keep up
Yeah and don't you have homework to do or something
Unless he's blown up this school, like the last one
Yeah, keep Alan away from the ships, he's a hazard
Okay, that's enough
Pass the salad
Man,  haven't seen that much fire since that volcano in Fiji
That wasn't Fiji that was Istanbul
No, no, Istanbul was the earthquake
Yeah well, nothing compares to Argentina
Dad, 'm not really hungry
Come on, Fermat
Let's go
But
'm not done
(sighs) Okay
After dinner Kyrano, have you seen Lady
By the pool
Of course
(answers her ringing cell phone) Parker
Scene changes to Alan and Fermat about to enter Thunderbird 1's silo
We're not supposed to go in there
We could get in trouble
Ah, you worry too much
Where'd you get the access code for Thunderbird 1 anyway
Fermat, my friend, what you don't know, can't hurt you
Scene changes back to Lady Penelope and Jeff by the pool 'll be right there
It seems the fire at the oil rig was no accident
Any suspects
Not yet, but 'll keep you posted
Thanks for bringing Alan home
My pleasure
Any excuse to visit paradise
Tintin
Hey, Mr
Tracy
Hello, Tintin
Good evening, Lady Penelope
Did you know Alan's home
(makes an annoyed face) Alan's back
(changes her tone to a more pleasant one)  mean, oh, Alan's back
(looks at Kyrano) Hey, Dad
When are those two going to get along
When Tintin decides the time is right
Girls always fire ahead of boys with that sort of thing
What sort of thing
(rolls her eyes) Romance
Alan and Tintin
didn't see that one coming
No, you wouldn't
Have a safe flight home, Penny
Thanks, Jeff
Scene switches to Fermat and Alan playing around in Thunderbird 1 like they are really about to fly it into a mission
Okay, Fermat
Run pre-flight checks
Right
Hydraulic systems are green
Commence main engine sequence
, Alan
Couldn't hurt to just fire up the instruments
No wait, Alan
That's the(Thunderbird 1 begins to start up and Fermat shouts) Wrong switch
Oh God
(There is loud beeping coming from the control panel and the boys can't shut down Thunderbird 1) Oh, could this day get any worse
Scene briefly changes to Jeff getting an alert in his office
(his face appears on a monitor in Thunderbird 1) Alan, my office
Now
(Thunderbird 1 shuts down) It just did
The boys walk out of Thunderbird 1 and are walking toward the silo door
Fermat is running his hand on the nosecone of Thunderbird 1
can't believe it
We're so b-b-busted
Fermat's hand touches the goo that Mullion fired at Thunderbird 1 earlier
Look at this
What is it
Looks like some sort of, gallium-electrolyte compound
We gotta get out of here
Scene changes to Alan walking into his dad's office
Dad,  know you're mad
shouldn't have been in the ship, but if you just give me a minute to explain- (Jeff cuts him off) You're damn right you shouldn't have been in there
But, nothing happened Dad
had it under control
Under control
Do you have any idea of the importance of secrecy in our operation
You fired up a Thunderbird without activating the anti-detection shield
You put everyone in danger when you act selfishly
You want to be part of the team, you have to play by the rules
You understand
(Alan just looks at him) Do you
Yeah,  understand
understand you don't want me to be a Thunderbird
You don't want me to do anything
You won't even listen to me when 'm trying to tell you something important
've heard enough
You're grounded for the rest of spring break
But, Dad
Bottom line, Alan
You need to grow up
Then let me
(he stalks toward the door before whispering,) Please
Jeff is starting at two old family photos on his desk when the video phone rings
Hey, John
was just about to turn in
What can  do for you
could sure use a pizza
You know a place that delivers
30 minutes or it's free, right
Anything else on your mind
Well, got a forest fire in Vladivostok, a typhoon heading for Singapore
What's happening on Planet Tracy
Alan's home for spring break
Yeah,  thought  could see a storm brewing in your region
Teenagers
Well, we've all been there
And Dad, you've done a great job since Mom died
Thanks, John
Keep an eye on that typhoon for us
And, uh, 'll call Vladivostok, see if they need help with that fire
, Dad
Sleep tight
Fermat is down with his father in the Thunderbirds hanger
Morning, Dad
Hey, son
There's something 'd like to sh-sh-sh- Here, take a look
The neural-net control system
It's great to have you back
bet you didn't think spring break was going to be this w- w-fun
Watch this
Brains uses the neural-net control system to lift up the phone in front of him
It also lifts up the Mole which is stationed behind his workplace
And that tiny phone lifts up, perfect
Dad
The neural-net control system short circuits
-n-n- Almost perfect
There's something  want to talk to you about
Oh
Right
Oh
, right
You're having problems with a g-g-g-chi-chi-chi-wo-wo-female
-no
No
Alan and  found some sort of gallium compound on the nosecone of Thunderbird 1
We should check that out st-st-st-immediately
That'd be g-g-g-swell
Scene skips to Alan skipping rocks at the beach
The camera follows one rock and it leads to a telescope coming out of the water
The telescope is connected to the Hood's submarine
The island is in sight
Transom,  need you
Yes, sir
Sir, our cloaking device has evaded their detection systems
We have a positive visual from the tracking solution on Thunderbird 1
Mullion
Sir
Sir, armed and ready
Shall  target the main structure
Why would  want to destroy what will soon be mine
One of the principle tenets of Eastern martial arts is to use your opponent's strength against him
The Hood uses his powers to keep Mullion in place (trying to move and realizing that he can't) This is ridiculous
It will be almost impossible to force the Thunderbirds to leave their island
On the other hand, it requires no effort at all to let them go
The Hood stops using his powers on Mullion and Mullion falls over
The Thunderbirds' purpose is to rescue
All we need do is give them the victim
(The Hood looks at Transom) Commence targeting
Straightaway, sir
Target acquisition of Thunderbird 5 is locked
Fire
Transom fires a missile at Thunderbird 5
Scene switches to John on Thunderbird 5 when suddenly alarms start to go off around him
What the
Thunderbird 5 to Tracy Island
Mayday
Mayday
Missile hits Thunderbird 5 and John is blow back into a wall from the explosion
The scene then switches over to Tracy Island
Brains and Fermat run into Jeff's office
Switching to Command and Control Center
(Brains uses a palm scanner to activate Command and Control) The submarine is briefly showed getting closer to the island
Jeff, Scott, Virgil, and Gordon come running into Command and Control
How bad, Brains
Thunderbird 5 major damage sustained
Possible m-m-m-Possible strike by m- Meteor
Yep
Thunderbirds are go
Scene change to inside Thunderbird 3
Check retros
Go
Go to maximum thrust
Scene switches to the submarine
There goes the cavalry
But who will rescue the rescuers
Scene changes to Alan on the beach looking up at Thunderbird 3 launching and heading toward Thunderbird 5
Tintin runs up beside him and looks up as well
Alan
Tintin
Thunderbird 5 has been hit
Thunderbird 5 has been hit
Thunderbird 5 has been hit
Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay don't panic
Don't panic
The children look toward the beach when they hear a noise and see the submarine beginning to surface
On the other hand
, , Run
The kids run and hide behind some trees and shrubs
Scene then switches to inside the submarine
We made land
(directed toward Transom) Cut them off
Activating communications blackout
Scene switch to Brains in Command and Control What the he-he-devil is going on
Mr
Tracy, do you copy
Thunderbird 3 please respond
Scene switch back to the kids hiding on the beach
How'd they find the island
Do you think it was what  did in Thunderbird 1
Do you think  ruined everything
No
That compound we found could have some sort of transmitting capability
We have to do something
My dad's in the control room, but how do we get there now
The vents
Let's go
We have to get a message to my dad
Scene switch to Thunderbird 5 'm losing all power
Repeat, 'm losing all power
Hold on, John
We're coming in
Gordon, prepare for immediate docking
You got it, Dad
Reverse main thrusters on my mark
Three, two, one
Easy
Watch the roll
Roll index angle minus two degrees
We're locked on
Nice work Tunnel hatch secured
Emergency packs boys
Let's move
We're in
Let's go
Jeff, Scott, Virgil, and Gordon are now in the damaged Thunderbird 5 with John
John
Scott, tackle that fire
Am  glad to see you guys
Easy, you're hurt
Virgil, take care of your brother
Gordon, give me a damage assessment
Scene switch to back on the island
The kids are running through the jungle while heading toward the vents and the Hood and his crew are heading toward Command and Control
Come on, hurry
Inside the Tracy house Transom has found the closed door to Command and Control center
Using an electronic device she finds out what type of door it is
One-inch steel plate, with sequential titanium locking mechanism
(Looks and door and pops his joints)  love a challenge
Scene changes to right outside the Tracy house as the kids are approaching the vents
Watch out for the guards
Get in, get in
Scene switches to Brains sitting nervously in the Command and Control room, whistling nervously to himself and reading a magazine upside down
On the other side of the door there is muffled banging from where Mullion is trying to break open the door
(Door bursts open and Mullion, Transom, and the Hood walk in) Who-o-o-o- What's going on
So, this is Mount Olympus
And these are the Thunderbirds
should have guessed
Jeff Tracy, the billionaire, ex-astronaut, of course
Isn't he the one who lost his wife in an accident
Avalanche wasn't it
How tragic
Scene switches to Alan, Tintin, and Fermat walking in the vents toward the one that leads to the Command and Control room
(Whispers) Just keep going straight ahead
(whispers) Okay
Scene switches back to Command and Control room
Professor Hackenbacker
We met at last year's international conference on nanotechnology
thought your thesis on neutrinos was extremely, stimulating
Transom, concentrate
Sorry, sir
The command control switch, is here
Fingerprint recognition system
Professor
Please
Activate the control switch
-n-n-n-n- You must be kidding
Professor, you and  share an interest in the science of the mind
The difference is,  was born with my powers
Trust me when  tell you, you've barely touched the surface
(Brains is forced to stand up and walked over to the Hood) Even the strongest minds can be broken
It would be a pity to break yours
Fu-Fu-Fu- No way
Activate the control switch, Prof
(Uses his powers to make  move) Like a puppet on a string
(laughs) Brains hand touches the activation pad
We have control
(To Brains) Get up
Sorry, Professor
Nothing personal
Scene briefly switches to the children's worried faces in the vents
Scene then changes back to Thunderbird 5, where the control panel is buzzing
We got a warning light on our  system
Attempt manual override
No, that's negative
Scene switches back to Alan, Tintin, and Fermat in the vents
That's it
Okay, this one
Scene switches to Thunderbird 5
Back to Thunderbird 3 now
(turns to help an injured John) John, we gotta move
The locking mechanism's jammed
Attention, Thunderbird 5
As you can see  have taken over your facilities
You no longer control your operational systems
Scene change back to the kids in the vent
They can stick their heads out of the vent and see into the Command and Control Room, but they are hidden behind a panel and the Hood and his minions cannot see them
They've taken over
Warm them up, Transom
Increasing temperature to maximum
The children are now looking into the Command and Control room
Kyrano and his wife, Onaha, are dragged in
Who's the bald freak
You
The Hood uses his powers on him and he falls down clutching his head
Dad
They've got m-my dad
Okay, you have our attention
Who are you
What do you want
Oh how rude of me
You can call me The Hood
Now, listen, Mr
Tracy
We won't be negotiating
'm going to use the Thunderbirds to rob the largest banks in the world, starting with the Bank of London
The world's monetary system will be thrown into chaos and the Thunderbirds held responsible
You'll never get away with it
Why the Thunderbirds
An eye for an eye, Mr
Tracy
An eye for an eye
Perhaps you've forgotten me, but surely you remember saving the life of my brother, Kyrano
Turns to the video phone that the Hood has been using to communicate with Thunderbird 5
'm sorry, Mr
Tracy
thought he was dead
(Laughs and then turns to the guards)Take them away
Yes, sir
The kids lift their heads back up into the vents Whoa
That makes The Hood my uncle
Every family has a black sh-sh- a black sh- (Sneezes and everyone in the Command and Control room looks around, while Brains pretends that it was him that sneezed
) (Turns to look at Alan) This room's murder with my allergies
The kids stick their heads back out the vent and look at what is going on in the Command and Control room
You left me to die that day
You may have broken my body but you've no idea how powerful my mind has become
And now you will suffer, as  suffered, waiting for a rescue that will never come
(Makes a motion for Transom to cut off the call with Thunderbird 5
) Wait
(Video link cuts dead and then the scene cuts to Thunderbird 5
) Scott, status report
CO2 levels are rising
Alright, wire the oxygen scrubber to the emergency batteries
Clean the air
How long will that give us
About four hours
Scene switches back to the kids looking into the Command and Control room
Fermat begins to start sneezing again
Tintin and Alan put their hands over his nose and mouth to try and muffle the sound
) Someone's there
(Mullion walks over to the ceiling, he is standing directly below where they are
The kids are trying to leave the vents when his hand shoots up through the ceiling and grabs Alan's ankle
He lets go after Tintin bites his hand and he gasps in pain
) The children are now talking loudly and everyone in the Command and Control room can hear them
Run
Run
No, jump
We can get through to the silos
The children scream as they fall down a tunnel leading to the silos
And the scene switches to the Command and Control room
Apparently, the island is not as secure as you thought
(he looks at the old photos that were on Jeff's desk
Children
Did you find any children
(Using the security cameras to see into the silos) Here they are
Thunderbird 2 silo, in the loading arm
Mullion and two other guards run off to get them (Speaking to Transom) Seal them in
Hold on
The doors
You guys, let's go
'mon Go
Go
The children reach the door that leads to Thunderbird 3's silo just as it closes
This way
(They run toward the still closing Thunderbird 1 silo door
) (After the door closes before they can get through it) No
They've got us trapped
What now
If we can get to the Thunderbird 1's silo, we can escape through the service tunnel
But we need a plan, Alan
'll use the Thunderizer on the door
guards are in the elevator heading down to come get them) You guys get the goons with the Firefly
Alan
This equipment is only to be used in an emergency
(Alan and Tintin give him looks) guess this qualifies
Yeah
Here they come
Fermat, can you drive this thing
Uh, no
Hey, watch it
took microbiology, not driver's ed
Set the pressure to maximum
Got it
(The guards walk out of the elevator and see Tintin pointing the Firefly at them) Retreat
(They fall over and have trouble getting up due to the slipperiness of the stuff fired at them) Let's move it
That's it
Time to thunderize
(After the door has a hole cut in it
) Yes
Come on, let's go
Get 'em
Where's Fermat
Fermat
Fermat
Coming
Hurry up
(the children are now in Thunderbird 1's silo) What were you doing back there, Fermat
had an-n-n idea
Just try and keep up, okay
'll open the tunnel
We gotta keep moving
(Alan types in a pass code) (To Tintin and Fermat) Go back
Yell when you see them coming
(tries another pass code) Alan turns away from the door for a moment and the camera can see The Hood on the other side of the door
Alan turns back and sees him
Alan
You can run if you want
Were you surprised to hear what your father did to me
It is frightening when we realize our parents aren't perfect
But perhaps you already suspected that about your father
Why did he build these magnificent machines
Do you suppose it was guilt
Because he let your mother die
(Alan shakes his head no) Open the door, Alan
(Alan continues to shake his head no) (The Hood chuckles at his refusal) Open, the, door
(He tries to use his powers on Alan but nothing happens) (Shouting to Tintin and Fermat) We can't go this way
He's there
The Hood uses his powers to open the door and Mullion and the other guards appear at the other doorway, leaving the children trapped
No
(he falls slightly) Ow
What are we gonna do, Alan
don't know
'm thinking, okay
(Alan looks at the control panel behind the Hood and sees a button that will open part of the floor under Thunderbird 1
Keep backing up
've got an idea
(Alan takes his rock launcher from the pouch it is in on the back of his pants
and fires it at the button, but misses
) That's your idea
It's not me you're angry at, Alan
It's not you 'm aiming at
(Alan fires another rock and this time hits the button and the floor drops out from underneath Tintin, Fermat, and Alan
Tintin, Fermat, and Alan scream as they fall
) Get them
Transom, fire up Thunderbird 1
And set it on broil
The kids look behind them while they are falling down the tunnel and see the flames coming from Thunderbird 1 behind them
Tintin screams even louder
The tunnel opens up and leads to the ocean
Back in Command and Control No sign of them
Of course not, the little brats went up like firecrackers
Pop, pop, pop
(laughs at Brains and Brains moves to punch him
) Don't, give him the satisfaction, Professor
This is taking too long
Pick out the equipment you need to get into those banks and load it into Thunderbird 2
No more delays
Yes, sir
Scene switches to the children trying to get onto the beach, they are getting knocked over by a couple of waves
Fermat is coughing and spluttering
How about a little warning next time you pull a stunt like that
Relax, Fermat
It's just a little water
could have drowned
You mean you can't swim
repeat,  could have drowned
Scene switches to the boys ringing out their shirts, they are both in their boxers
said  was sorry, Fermat
Just put this behind us, Okay
We gotta watch each other's backs
Nice drawers
Thank you
Boo
No, c'mon Tintin, stay there
You're worse than a couple of girls
Hurry up and get dressed
(To Fermat) Those are nice drawers
Scene switches to the children walking along one of the beaches
Data from Tracy Island is sent to Thunderbird 5 via satellite, right
Right
So, there's a miniscule possibility that if we reach the satellite station, we could Blow it up
No, we could hack in to it and give control back to Thunderbird 5
Good thinking, Fermat
Alright, let's do it
(Alan starts drawing the plan in the sand) Here's the plan
We're here, right
So, we go along the shore around the base of the mountain to the access road, here
And then up to the transmitter
So what do you think
Good
Except that we're here, not there, and the transmitter is there, not here
We have to go through the jungle
But that's f-f- off limits
It's gonna be dangerous
'm in
(All three of them put their hands together) We gotta get up there fast
All our folks are in trouble and if The Hood gets off the island Actually, he's not going anywhere for now
The guidance processor for Thunderbird 2
You can't take off without it
Fermat you're a genius
How'd you get this
Alan, my friend, what you don't know, can't hurt you
Scene switches to Lady Penelope's Country Mansion in England, where Parker is out cleaning a car when the car phone rings
Parker
Milady
We have an emergency
Scene switch to Lady Penelope's bathroom What a charming fellow
Someone knocks on the door
Come in
Parker enters Lady Penelope's bathroom, with tea, where she is up to her shoulders in bubble bath
Have a look at this, Parker
(There is a computer monitor near her feet
) He, and this woman, poor girl, both work for this man, known as The Hood
Sounds like an alias, milady
Quite right, Parker
Real name: Trangh Belagant
Assumed dead when his illegal diamond mine collapsed in the jungles of the Malaya
(takes a sip of tea) Oh, perfect, Parker
The Thunderbirds rescued over 500 mine workers, including Mr
Belagant's brother
Milady, that's Mr
Tracy's loyal manservant, Kyrano
How's my schedule, Parker
You have clay pigeon shooting with Lord Marlborough, a benefit gala for the Institute of the Blind, and incidentally there's a typhoon bearing down on Singapore
suppose that's urgent
Yes, milady
There was also a bridge collapsed in Buenos Aires and a volcanic eruption in Jakarta
The Thunderbirds haven't responded
No, milady
And the media is awash in speculation vis-a-vis their whereabouts
Parker turns on the news
Over to Lisa Lowe
Chuck, disaster after disaster around the world today and still no sight of the Thunderbirds
Typhoon Jago hit land in Singapore just one hour ago and thousands have been left homeless by a volcano in Jakarta
Only the Thunderbirds have the incredible machines think it's time to send the emergency signal, Parker
fear you're not wrong, milady
Lisa Lowe
Back to you, Chuck
Parker hits the top of the tea pot and a light pops out and begins to blink and beep
Back on Tracy Island a similar light begins to flash and bleep but Brains is unable to get up to get to it because he is tied up
Scene switch to the kids walking through the jungle
'm telling you, Fermat, it was like The Hood was inside my head back there
What do you mean, Alan
Maybe he can read minds or control minds or something
Don't be silly, Alan
Everything can be explained by science
'm just trying to figure out his weakness
Everybody has an Achilles heel, right
My Achilles heel is actually my Achilles heel
It's got a blister the size of a basketball
Tintin
Can we s-s- Stop
Yes
No
(sighs) Okay
(Helping Fermat up the hill) No more cheeseburgers for you, Fermat
Scene change back to Lady Penelope's house
Any word
Nothing, milady
Right
You will have to tell Lord Marlborough that 've broken my shooting arm
We shall send the Institute for the Blind a dozen guide dogs
And bring the car around
Yes, milady
The Thunderbirds appear to be in a spot of trouble
And  don't like that
Let's go, Parker
They get in the car and it takes off flying toward Tracy Island
Scene switches to Mullion and the Hood in the Thunderbirds hanger
Ready for launch
We'll use this to get into the vaults
Subtle, as usual, Mullion
didn't realize we'd be getting points for style
We're robbing banks, remember
The Hood uses his power on Mullion and Mullion gasps
Don't worry
You'll get your money
(Looks over toward Thunderbird 2 and speaks into headset) Transom, initiate pre-flight diagnostics
An alarm suddenly goes off in Thunderbird 2
What's going on
It's the guidance processor
What's wrong with it
There isn't one
Aaargh
Clever Alan
It's the children
They have it
No way
They're dead
No one could live through something like that
did
Get them, Mullion
Take whatever you need
And make sure you get the guidance processor before you lose your temper
Scene switches to the children in the jungle
Alan, don't you think Tintin is blossoming
Blossoming
What's that supposed to mean
Come on, Alan
You've a c-crush on her
You've got to be kidding
mean, she's
She's not that bad,  guess
(Reaches the top of the mountain) Okay, guys, take five
(Still finishing climbing up the mountain)Five isn't going to do it
Guys
Alan and Fermat reach the top of the mountain, they are both puffing and panting
Tintin smiles at them before she sees a scorpion on Alan's shoulder
Don't move
(Sees scorpion when he stands up next to Alan) Whoa What is it
Hexdrotilous scorpion
Is that dangerous
025 milligrams of its venom is fatal
So, dangerous is in fact an understatement
Tintin uses powers just like her uncle, The Hood, to lift the scorpion off of Alan's shoulder and lets it fall to the ground
Watch out
Tintin, what was that
Let's get going
Hey
She has the same powers as her uncle, The Hood
You think
Must run in the family
Did you do that
Just drop it, okay
Still think everything can be explained by science
Not girls
Scene cuts to Thunderbird 5 where there is an alarm and then an explosion near Scott and Gordon
Scott
Gordon
You all right
We're okay
The heat exchanger has blown
You don't say
Scene switches back to Mullion and two other guards searching the jungle for Alan, Tintin, and Fermat
Come on
Those brats are in here somewhere
Scene change to the kids at the satellite transmitter
How we doing Fermat
Don't rush me Alan
This is very d-delicate equipment
(The circuit board sparks
) Which is now b-b-broken
Can you fix it
Yea- Maybe, but 'll need something to solder with
We're in the middle of nowhere Fermat, where are you going to find something like that
(Tintin and Fermat see Alan's retainer and share a look) What
Alan yells as Tintin and Fermat pull out the metal part of Alan's retainer
Ow
Perfect
Gee Alan,  never figured you for a crybaby
'm gonna kill you
What'd he say
think it was some sort of apology
got it, yes
-y-you the man, Fermat
Okay, first step is to establish contact with Thunderbird 5
Scene switch to Thunderbird 5 Dad
It's Alan
Alan, where are you
Are you safe
'm at the satellite relay station with Fermat and Tintin
Fermat's gonna hack into the main computer system and give control of Thunderbird 5 back to you
We're standing by
Okay, we're almost there
Scene switches to Command and Control room with Transom and Brains
Goodness me, Professor
You're so good-looking without your glasses on
think you may find that's another thing we have in common
Pretty
(She leans in to kiss him, but an alarm sounds at the control panel) Oh now that's not fair
Just when things were starting to sizzle
(To the Hood as he walks in)  burst of transmission from the island's satellite station
Should  jam it
And give Mullion the coordinates
Scene switches to Mullion and the two guards in a car
Transom is communicating with him through his headset
Take the main track southeast, then head up Satellite Hill
Scene switches back to the kids at the satellite station
They're onto us
We're being jammed
Can you finish
'll try
(Through the video phone) Alan, what's happening
Hang in there Dad, one more minute, okay
It's not going to work Alan
The signal's too weak for data transmission
Dad, can you hear me
They're jamming the signal
We're going to lose you
Don't worry, 'll take care of everything, okay
That's a negative
It's too dangerous
Follow emergency procedure
Wait for Lady Penelope at the rendezvous point
Alan can you read me
(the screen begins to break up) Dad
Alan we're losing you
Alan
Dad
Alan throws the video phone No
Useless
It is now
'm sorry, Alan
This is hard on all of us
No, it's okay
'm fine
You don't have to be such a tough guy Alan
'm worried about my dad too
'd do anything to be with my parents right now
But The Hood knows we're alive now
We have to go
Even worse, they know exactly Tires screech and Mullion and the guards appear
Where we are
Mullion and the other guards watch the kids running down the hillside for a second
Come on
The kids fall down a ditch screaming and into a river
Great, more water
Tintin, can you slow 'em down
'd be delighted
Then do it
And meet us at the junk yard
Come on, Fermat
Scene changes to Alan and Fermat discovering a hoversled in the junkyard
This'll get us out of here
Scene change to Mullion hunting Tintin down in the forest
There
Come on
Tintin looks up and sees a bees hive
Straight ahead
Tintin uses a limb to hit the bee hive at Mullion and the other two guards
Mullion falls off the car and into a puddle while being stung by bees
The scene cuts back to Alan and Fermat in the junkyard attaching something to the back of the hoversled so that all three of them can fit on it
It's gonna make this thing hard to control you know
No problem
You really must be careful not to exceed four bars of boost or else said no problem
Guys, let's go we've got to get out of here
What is this
It's a hoversled
It's our ticket out, unless you've got a better idea
Yeah, let's wait for Lady Penelope, like your dad said
(Hands Tintin the seat to the hoversled) Here
Great plan
Let's sit and wait to get caught
say we do something
Now
Right, Fermat
Actually,  agree with Tintin
don't think this is s-s-safe
You don't think anything is s s-safe
Just because  s-s-stutter doesn't mean that 'm wrong
If we're a team, we should make decisions as a team
Do you guys want to sit here and take a vote
Or do you want to get out of here
Cuz 'm going
You can be a real jerk sometimes
Scene changes to Mullion looking up and seeing the kids escaping on the hoversled
(To the guards driving the car) Go
Go
(After looking behind her and seeing Mullion and the other guards in the car getting closer to them) Oh, no
Come on
Faster
Alan
You're going too fast
need more speed to get above the trees
Hang on
Tintin and Fermat fall off the hoversled screaming and at Mullion's feet
What'd  tell you guys
(looks down and sees Fermat and Tintin being captured
) Oh, no
Scene switches to Mullion walking Tintin and Fermat to a door in the Tracy house
What are you doing
Oh, no
Not the fridge
Fridge door opens to reveal Kyrano, Onaha, and Brains
Tintin
Hey son
Sweetheart, are you okay
'm fine, Dad
(Grabs Fermat away from Brains and has him sit down on a container) Cool off, kid
(he laughs evilly as he walks out of the fridge and closes the door on the way out) Scene switch to Park and Lady Penelope approaching Tracy Island
Tracy Island approaching, milady
Switching to aqua mode
Isn't life fun, sometimes
Rib-tickling, milady
Scene switches to Transom and The Hood in Command and Control getting an alarm that an aircraft is approaching Tracy Island
What is it
We have an unidentified craft approaching the island at high speed
Scene switches to Alan climbing over a hill and seeing Lady Penelope's car approaching
Lady
Scene switches to Thunderbird 5 Phew
Somebody roll down a window
It's getting a little hot in here
Re-entry into Earth's atmosphere in 37 minutes
Oxygen's out in 30 so we won't feel it
Stop it
Come on, Dad
The situation's hopeless
No, it's not
There's still time
We've got people on the ground working for us
Alan
He's just a kid
He's a Tracy
Scene switches quickly to Alan running through the forest and then to Lady Penelope and Parker walking up to the Tracy house This doesn't look good, Parker
No, milady
That bougainvillea is absolutely parched, and someone should do something about that hideous hammock
(After seeing Lady Penelope and Parker) Whom do we have here
Mullion
must warn you that  know judo, krai magna, and tae kwon do
And  know Parker
Milady
(After Parker punches him in the face) You've broken my nose
Yes, that was very much the intention of the maneuver
(After she tries to attack Lady Penelope and Lady Penelope pushes her over) Whoa
One tries so hard in life to sort things out on an intellectual-slash-conversational level
sometimes it's just not possible
Lady Penelope continues to fight Transom and Parker continues to fight Mullion, the Hood is watching them
(after Mullion threw him against a metal cabinet) Shall  bring the car around, milady
Parker, have a bit of a lie-down
(Sees Mullion behind Lady Penelope) Excuse me, milady
(punches him and after that has no effect he picks up a frying pan and hits Mullion) Transom goes back to fighting Lady Penelope and Mullion is fighting Parker
Ah, Lady Penelope
Of course he has his palace
Why not his princess
Flattery will get you nowhere
(after she blocks the metal bar that Transom was trying to hit her with) Ow
Have you any idea what a manicure costs these days
(Is pushing Mullion forward) Coming through, milady
The camera quickly pans a little bit outside to show Alan hidden behind some shrubs watching the fight
(After the Hood uses his powers to throw a sofa at them) Duck, milady
He's weak
Using his power makes him weak
(The Hood, having heard something looks over toward where Alan) You're formidable opponent Lady Penelope
More than a match for most men
That's not saying much, then, is it
(uses his powers to stop the punch that Parker was about to throw at him) suggest you let us pass
Don't try your parlor games on me you sad, little man
You've committed a serious crime trespassing on this island
And in about (looks at Parker's watch) four seconds, 'm going to get quite cross with you
(the Hood uses his powers to stop her foot which was about to come up and kick him
) (with his back still to Alan) How are you, Alan
(he uses his powers on Parker and Lady Penelope and they cry out in pain) (Alan moves to run back into the jungle)  hope you don't think 'm going to chase you
(he uses his powers on Parker and Lady Penelope and they cry out in pain again) You can make it stop, Alan
(Parker and Lady Penelope cry out again) You have something that belongs to me
Really, sir, don't mind me
This isn't the first time my head's been pulverized
And it's never done any real harm before
(The Hood once again uses his powers on them and they cry out in pain louder this time) (comes out of his hiding place) Stop
Stop
'll give it to you
(throws the guidance processor toward the pool) Fetch
(the Hood uses his powers to bring it over to him before it can hit the water) You made a match of it, Alan, 'll give you that
(to Mullion and Transom) Put them with the others
(Transom grabs Parker) (To Lady Penelope and Alan) You're coming with me
(Grabs Alan's arms and throws Lady Penelope over his shoulder) Put me down
This outfit is couture
Scene switches to Thunderbird 5
Don't go to sleep
John, look at me
Keep your eyes open
Scene switches back to the fridge where Mullion and Transom are taking Alan, Lady Penelope, and Parker
You need to cool off, milady
Lady Penelope
(To Mullion) Big oaf
(The fridge door closes leaving them trapped) Right, that's quite enough losing for one day
(To Fermat) So, how does it feel to be right all the time
Not b-bad, actually
'm so sorry, Fermat
We make quite a pair
It's hard for me to t-t-talk
It's hard for you to l-l-listen
Parker,  have an idea
Excellent, milady
Brains, how long do Jeff and the boys have
can't think
'm too c-c-cold
Scene switches to Transom, Mullion, and The Hood in Thunderbird 2 about to leave Tracy Island

The Hood's getting away
In position, milady
Here we go
Launch sequence, stage two
(Lady Penelope kicks her shoe at an icicle which falls and cuts through the ropes tying Parker's hands together
) Yes
Good shot, milady
(As they are untying everyone) Come on, Parker
Let's give the bad guys a good thrashing
Scene switches back to Thunderbird 2 launching Stage three
Scene changes back to the fridge
(trying to figure out how to open the door) This seems to be a six-lever mortise, milady
love it when your checkered past comes in handy Parker
Thank you, milady
Unfortunately, fear  shall need a piece of wire to access the mechanism
(Lady Penelope's hand goes up shirt to get her bra wire and everyone turns around) Will this suffice, Parker
Most certainly, milady
didn't actually need it, anyway
Of course not, milady
(Parker gets the door open) Quick
They're getting away Okay, everyone get to the control room
(Hands Parker his hat) Hat
Scene switches to everyone running into the Command and Control room Get in there quick, Fermat, and save my family
Then we'll get The Hood
Good luck
Looks like they slipped a backdoor key into the access codes
'll follow your lead, son
(Using the video phone to talk with Thunderbird 5) Thunderbird 5 come in
Thunderbird 5 come in
How long have they got before re-entry
90 seconds and counting 'm in

Thanks for waking me
Dad
Alan
Well done
Mr
Tracy, confirm access protocol
Confirmed
We are back online
Gravity is restored
Put Thunderbird f-f- your craft into geostational orbit immediately

Looks like we're good to go
Dad, are you all right
We're fine
We still have a job to do
Where's The Hood
He's in Thunderbird 2 Mr
Tracy headed for -- London
She's right
He's got the Mole on board
Looks like Thunderbird 3 lost a booster, Dad
We'll never get there in time
Let me go after The Hood
He'll destroy everything you've built everything the Thunderbirds stand for
Negative
'm sorry it's too risky
can do this
You know  can
What am  saying
(Puts his arms around Tintin and Fermat) We can do this

Thunderbird 2 lands in a park near the London Eye and causes panic
We're getting reports of some kind of incident in London involving the Thunderbirds
Lisa, are you there
Chuck, 'm here in Jubilee Gardens where Thunderbird 2 has made an impromptu landing, causing total panic in Central London
As far as we know there has been no emergency call from this area so it's unclear why Thunderbird 2 would be active here at all
don't know if you can see this Chuck but Thunderbird 2 seems to be unloading some kind of machine
Scene changes to inside the Mole with Transom, Mullion, and The Hood
Set a course for the vault
Sir, if we continue on our present course, we'll sever the monorail's subterranean supports
Shall  correct our position

'll go and fix it myself
What you mean swim
Get me as close as you can
How are we doing on that line Fermat
Just look out your window
Come on, Tintin, come on
Come on
Come on, Tintin
You can do this
(Tintin successfully connects the rope to the stanchion and swims toward Thunderbird 4's airlock) Opening the airlock

Commencing reverse thrust
That was amazing, Tintin
Thank you
Nice job, Fermat
Nothing to it, really
(To Tintin who is helping him lift the monorail out of the water with Thunderbird 4) Easy does it
Thunderbird 3 has landed and Jeff, Scott, John, Virgil, and Gordon are running over to the river bank to look for Alan in Thunderbird 4
There they are
(Everyone cheers) (After he and Tintin have gotten out of Thunderbird 4) Glad you could finally join us
Hey don't get cocky after one mission
We still have a dangerous situation

Scene changes to The Hood inspecting a diamond at the Bank of London
Ashes to ashes, diamonds to diamonds
Lady Penelope
What an unpleasant surprise
Don't be rude
can't tell you what a pleasure it would be to use my little finger to pull this big trigger
Now, don't move
Mullion
(uses his powers to knock the gun from Lady Penelope's hand) That's not cricket
'm sorry
The only part of sport ever liked was winning
How ghastly
Scene changes to Alan and Jeff in Thunderbird 1
Hey, Dad
That stuff The Hood said, about you leaving him to die
He was lying, right
No
See, you can't save everyone, Alan
It doesn't matter how hard you try or how brave you are
It doesn't even matter if it's someone you love, someone you'd give your life in a second to save
You just can't save everyone
What was Mom like
She was a lot like you
Come on, we've got a job to do
Scene switches to Lady Penelope being handcuffed at the Bank of London
Finish her off, Mullion
Shame on you

(When Parker turns away Alan runs after his dad
) Master Tracy
Look out, Parker
Alright, that's enough of that
(from behind Parker) Don't move
(Parker motions for the kids to run forward but Transom blocks them
Parker puts his hands up as if to punch her) Go on, then
No, sorry
can't hit a lady
Allow me
(she kick Transom and runs off, Transom chases her) (To Fermat) 've been waiting to get my hands on you brats
And 've been waiting to get my hands on you
They brawl for a few seconds before Mullion lands a good punch on Parker
Ow, now that was a punch
Parker, can we wrap this up
What did you have in mind, Master Hackenbacker
Strategically speaking, the best odds of success lie with the Parker Haymaker
concur
(they knock Mullion out) Scene changes to Jeff running into the room that Lady Penelope is being held captive in Penny
Jeff, no
Did you save them all this time, Jeff
Or did you leave someone behind
didn't make you what you are
It's not me you have to convince
(motions his head toward the entrance of the room where Alan is standing) Leave my son out of this- (the Hood uses his powers to throw Jeff into the cage that Lady Penelope is handcuffed in) Jeff
Dad
(Alan runs toward the closing cage door and reaches it right as it slams shut) Dad
Dad
'm disappointed in you, Alan
thought we were kindred spirits
Well, we're not
'm Jeff Tracy's son
You certainly are
(Alan runs at him) No
Alan no

Alan, stay back
You want so desperately to walk in Daddy's footsteps
(uses his powers to lift Alan off the floor and makes him start choking himself with his own hands) Let him go
Did you really think you could challenge me
Let him go, please
Let him go
Please
Let him go
(the Hood tightens his hold of Alan and then releases him) Alan
Are you all right
Alan, get out
Run
He's getting weaker
He can't last much longer
Neither can you
(Alan begins to climb up the Mole to reach the Hood) Alan, no
Look out
(The Hood starts the Mole with his powers and Alan has to jump and grab the railing of the catwalk) Alan
'm glad you could be here to see this, Jeff
(steps on one of Alan's hands until he cries in pain and lets go) Goodbye, Alan
(Steps on the other hand and Alan yells in pain) (Tintin runs into the room) No
Ah, (uses his powers on her) (She uses her powers on him as well) Oh
(The catwalk flips over making Alan safely on top and the Hood dangling above the still active Mole
Leave me, Alan
Leave me to die

One more week and you're gonna be swimming like a -f-f--d-d- Sha-sha- sha-Aquatic creature
Good job, Ferm
(To Alan as she spins around) So, what do you think
He's getting there
(Looks at Tintin) Whoa, Tintin
You're just really, um, blossoming
Ew
Did you say "blossoming"
(smiles at him) (rings a triangle) Gather around everybody
have an announcement to make
Tonight is a special night
We're all together because of three very special people
Fermat, Tintin, Alan
The world needs Thunderbirds and the Thunderbirds need you
(gives each of them International Rescue pins) Mr
Tracy
Thank you, sir
(Camera pans quickly over to Parker who is tearing up) Congratulations, Alan
No short cuts
You earned it
You all did
(To Onaha and Kyrano) 'm not usually an emotional man, but sometimes even the toughest nut must crack
(As all four of Alan's brothers walk over to ruffle his hair and congratulate him) Hey, way to go, sprout
That's my boy, Alan
That's my brother
(Fermat and Alan are thrown into the pool by Scott, John, Virgil, and Gordon who jump in after them) (answering his phone after it rings) Yes, Madam President

Weapons underground keeping our planet safe and sound If someone evils coming round they should be frightened (frightened) Cause now the boys are back in town
No strings to hold them down down
(Chorus) Don't be mad please, stop the hating just be glad that they'll be waiting, Friends we have aren't ever changing You know the lid's about to blow, when the thunderbirds are go
Kids are learning fast they know the t-birds kick some ass Be sure that there's no coming last cause you're on their side (their side) It always looks so cool when spaceships come out of the pool You know that you'd just be a fool to be a bad guy (bad guy) Cause now the boys are back in town no strings to hold them down down
(Chorus) Don't be mad please, stop the hating just be glad that they'll be waiting, Friends we have aren't ever changing You know the lid's about to blow, when the thunderbirds are go
Thunderbirds are go, (Chorus) Don't be mad please stop the hating just be glad that they'll be waiting, Friends we have aren't ever changing
You know the lid's about to blow, when the thunderbirds are go
Thunderbirds are, Thunderbirds are go Thunderbirds are, Thunderbirds are go Thunderbirds are, Thunderbirds are go Thunderbirds are, Thunderbirds are go
