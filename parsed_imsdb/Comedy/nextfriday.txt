"Next Friday" -- by Ice Cube -   - is laid out on the grass
(
) In the movies, when you beat up the neighborhood bully; you suppose to live happily ever after
But around here; that's when all the drama begins
Blue and red police lights flash over Debo's body
Two sheriffs walk    and stand over Debo
They flash their lights on him
(cont'd) (
) Last Friday;  got fired for the first time
got high for the first time got shot at for the first time and kicked Debo's ass for the first time
They get him to his feet; but he stumbles and falls in the bushes like a knocked out prize fighter
The sheriffs laugh at him
Debo looks dazed and confused
The sheriffs help him out the bushes and start to cuff him
(cont'd) (
) was the man that night; and Debo ended up going to jail for a couple of years
But he told Ezal he was getting out next Friday
He said, when he see me, he was gonna smoke me on the spot
They walk him
: (cont'd) (
) And today is next Friday
"New Line Cinema presents, etc
, etc
: - It's early Friday morning and the sun peeks over the  skyline
As the city starts to awake and the credits continue to roll; we see   of the real people who make up Los Angeles
It seems that they all move to the same beat
- Debo is released from the Twin Towers County Jail
Still in his orange jumpsuit, he walks right past us and down the street
Everybody clears his path
still '
Debo crosses the street passing an old man dancing and directing traffic
Debo stops, the man starts to dance in front of him
He stares for a second, then he's on his way
Still walking tall and hard, he trips over a crack in the sidewalk (losing cool points)
Three little black girls in plaid uniforms practice the latest dance steps on their way to school
Debo is walking towards them
They scream and take off in the other direction
He smiles
Briefly
Still walking; he stops at a corner
boy waits to cross with his low-rider bike
Metrolink train passes
After it goes by; we see Debo riding off on the boy's bike
He's on the ground holding his eye
Debo continues to ride through the city
He turns a corner or two and comes to a stop at Craig's house
'  - Mr
Jones' dog catcher's truck sits in front of the house
(like the Taco Bell dog) takes a dump on the lawn
It starts to  at Debo
He looks down at the dog and kicks him in the street
The
Debo focuses his attention on Craig's house
'  - The hallway is clear and quiet, until
(Craig's father), storms out of the bedroom
He struggles to put on his dog catcher's uniform
He stops at the bathroom door and knocks hard
Craig
Craig
Off yo' ass and on yo' feet; this ain't the time to beat your meat
Mr
Jones laughs at himself
(
) 'll be out in about 35-40 minutes
Hurry up; today is Fri-day
And we gotta hit the high-way
Mr
Jones continues on his way; dancing to the beat
- -     - Hands crack open a $20 sack of bud onto the magazine
pack of Zigzags fall
Papers are ripped from the package
the doctor of this delicate operation
(
) Soon as my pops found out what Debo said to Ezal, he wanted me to move with my uncle and little cousin in Rancho Cucamonga
Til' things calm down, or Debo went back to prison
Whichever comes first
He's sitting on the toilet (dressed: not using it) putting the finishing touches on his masterpiece
He licks, rolls and slides the ' into the fifth pocket on his Levi jeans
(cont'd) (
) feel like the biggest punk around here
wiped Debo's ass
He should be the one moving
He exits
'  - The front door opens
Mr
Jones walks out the door, yelling back into the house
Craig
Let's go
don't wanna hit that traffic
He steps off the porch backwards and into "fresh Chihuahua shit
"  He slips and falls on the grass
(cont'd) be got damn
Mr
Jones gets up
He brushes the grass off his uniform
He looks clean, but when he turns around dog shit is smashed all over his back and butt
(cont'd) Craig
Craig
Craig emerges from the house with his bags in hand
(irritated) Here  come
(still mad) Well bring yo' ass on
Craig slams the door and starts towards the truck
What's the matter
fell in some mud
Now hurry up
Mr
Jones gets in the truck
Craig jumps in
They back out and pull off
-  - -   - He's daydreaming about Smokey
(
) didn't wanna leave my neighborhood at all
Especially my homeboy Smokey
But he went to rehab last week
know 'mma miss him
Out of nowhere, Debo jumps in front of the truck
Mr
Jones slams on the
Craig
Get out the car, boy
This the rematch
Debo reaches for his shank
Craig turns to Mr
Jones
Daddy, punch it
Mr
Jones floors it and hits Debo
He falls over the hood, off the car and in the street
The yellow truck speeds off
Debo jumps up staggering with scrapes and bruises
You know 'mma find you
You can run ya' can't hide
- Craig screams out the window
You fake ass Suge Knight
Mr
Jones is a bit shaken up
That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something
That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now
(with attitude) Ya'll making me look like a punk
It ain't about being a punk, son
It's about this
Craig smells something in the air
(cont'd) My great, great grand daddy on my Momma side; had a saying
'See a fool -- leave a fool
'  Somebody else a get him
Plus,  don't want that fool shooting at my house trying to hit yo' ass
What's that smell
Mr
Jones sniffs
Must be your upper lip, 'cause  don't smell nothing
(holding his nose) do
What it smell like
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud
Mr
Jones grabs the air freshener from under the seat
He starts to spray too much
Craig's window won't roll down
(cont'd) What's wrong with the window
gotta get'em fixed
They don't roll down
All damn
Just hold your breath
- They exit the freeway and pass a sign that reads, "Rancho Cucamonga" (the city away from the city)
'  - Welcome to the suburbs
Where the "Smiley Happy People" live in peace and quiet
The neighborhood is full of green lawns and nice two story track homes as far as the eye can see
The yellow truck drives through the streets and pulls up to a cul-de-sac
Mr
Jones  the
Nice neighborhood, huh
It's alright
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing
still can't figure that one out
Why they got to have the loudest house on the block
Uncle Elroy's house is royal blue with gold trim
All the other houses are painted in earth tones
Ah, son, don't be no hater
You know your uncle ain't got no taste
Just don't let him rub off on you
Craig grabs his bags
You coming in
No, 'mma go on to work
don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth
Now listen to me, Craig
It's gonna be different living over here
Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit
Understand
Hey, Pops, 'm grown
Can't nobody get me in trouble no more
As craig gets out;  the front door flies open
It's - (22), Craig's crazy younger cousin
He yells back into the house
- Daddy, Craig is here
Day-Day walks out to the car and gives Craig a pound
What's crackin'
- You
Hi, Uncle Willie
Hey, Day-Day
Where's yo' big head father
- There he is
Just then,   (42) hits the door
Dressed in boxers and a -shirt
This is Mr
Jones' (very loud) little brother
Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'
Naw, it ain't like that
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson
Alright, 'll remember that
You know me
would've shot his big ass
(peeking into the ear) Hey, Willie, how's it going
Still steppin' in dog shit every day
Uncle Elroy laughs
Mr
Jones isn't amused
Make sure you look after my son out here
Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy
Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro
He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby
This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent
Ain't that right, nephew
Uncle Elroy hugs Craig by the arm
Craig, remember what  told you
'll remember
Mr
Jones pulls off
Uncle Elroy yells out to him
Send Betty my love
(to Craig) Boy you looking good
(grabbing his bags) 'mma take these in the house for you, man
and when you finish with this cat, come inside
got something to show you
Thanks, Unc
Uncle Elroy starts towards to the house
- You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last
Up at the family reunion
know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat
Day-Day laughs
- Yep
forgot about him cussin' out everybody
Damn that was fun
know, we had a good time
But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch
- know; this a long way from Watts
But what  like about living out here is that you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing
Just peace and quiet
Listen
They do
It is quiet, except for a few
- (cont'd) Shit sound good, huh
Just then, a maroon Cadillac low-rider on Daytons rolls up the block
It's the Jokers:  (28), '  (21) and (15)
They pull into their driveway
- (cont'd) Aw damn
In  : One by one they get out the car
They have a dog with them named "Cheeco
"  As they get to the front door they all look over at Craig and Day-Day
Day-Day looks away, while Craig keeps his eye on them
They disappear inside
Who is that
- Joker, he just got out of the pen
Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority
And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac
- Naw, them dudes is assholes
Especially that dog - Cheeco
Watch this little ass, he's sneaky
Plus,  got something better than a Cadillac
They walk over to his black  325i on chrome rims
This you
- (proud) Yeah, that's me
Just a little somethin' somethin'  picked up
Must be nice
wish we won the lottery
Come up on a million dollars like ya'll
- Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million
We bought this house and  spent the rest on this
It's the bomb, huh
This my baby
feel like a new nigga in this car
get mo' phone numbers rollin' this, than  ever did on the bus
(
) Hi, Day-Day
They turn to spot    (67), the old Korean lady who lives next door
She's sitting on her porch nursing a cup of coffee
- (speaking louder and slower) Hi, Mulan
Fuck you, Day-Day
Who's ya boy
- This my cousin, Craig
He just moved out here from
Craig, this is Miss Ho
Day-Day smiles at Craig
My name is Miss Ho Kym
Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass
Nice to meet you, Craig
Are you 'bout it, 'bout it
Excuse me
said
are you 'bout it, 'bout it -- rowdy, rowdy
Craig can't believe his ears
Yeah, 'm 'bout it
Well, then, it's all good
Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street
've been seeing a lot of activity
They all look over at the Joker's house
What kind of activity
Strange activity
think they running drugs off Tijuana
Day-Day don't believe me
- How do you know for sure

Don't hate, congratulate
- don't have time, Miss Ho, 'll see you later
Day-Day and Craig start to walk back to the house
See you later, Day-Day
Come by after work,  got the John Blaze shit for you
Nice to meet you
Peace out, Craig
'  - Day-Day and Craig enter the house
They still have the furniture from the projects
Craig looks around
He spots at a few hanging pictures
Man, this a cool house
- (picking up a picture) Thanks,  just wish my mother had a chance to see it
Mother's picture: she looks like Day-Day with a wig on
She's smiling and holding the winning lotto ticket
- (cont'd) But when she found out we won the money, she had a heart attack
You know the story
Yeah
sad moment
- Go on and make yourself at home
'mma go get dressed for work
Oh, yeah, where you work at
- Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center
'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you
'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig
Thanks for reminding me
Day-Day exits
Craig is left to look around, until something outside catches his eye
It's ' (20), Day-Day's six-month pregnant girlfriend
She's walking on the right side of his
With one hand she waves at Craig
with the other hand she's keying Day- Day's car with the skills of a retarded first-grader
Craig waves back, but something ain't right
Uncle Elroy steps in with  (39), his nymphomaniac girlfriend
She's wearing a sexy nightie that's a size too small
Craig,  want you to meet my old lady, Suga
Suga, this is Craig
Oooh, ba-by
She gives Craig a big, juicy hug and kiss, grabbing his ass in the process
(cont'd) (hugging and grabbing) You even cuter than your baby pictures
Thank you
(whispering in Craig's ear) You know, 'mma be your new auntie
We can keep it all in the family if you want to
Uncle Elroy un-hugs them
Okay, okay, that's enough
Go put on some damn clothes
(pouting) Elroy
Suga
Go ahead and get us something to smoke on
Okay
(winking) Bye, Craig
Nice to meet you
Suga walks out
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day
Viagra ain't working
My back keep going out
she don't never get enough
But check this out
got to lay some ground rules
(gets closer to Craig) Your my family and  love you
You're welcome to anything you want in my home
But  don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl
you feel me knocking
Yeah
Well, let me in
Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car
He looks
Oh, that's 'Wana
His ex
(yelling upstairs) Day-Day, the crazy bitch is back
Day-Day runs down the stairs to get a look
He's holding a piece of paper
- Aw, naw
He runs out the door
'Wana continues her job
Day-Day storms over, waving the paper
- Girl, you supposed to be 1000 feet from my house
What you doing over here
' What it look like 'm doing
You can't quit me, 'm pregnant
- That ain't my baby
Day-Day spots the damage
He loses it
- (cont'd) (in disbelief) Oh, my God
What you doing
Now he's a madman
- (cont'd) Bitch
You keyed my car
'mma kill you
Day-Day charges 'Wana
She has her pepper spray ready
' got your bitch right here
'Wana sprays his face orange
He stops in his tracks; grabs his eyes and screams like a woman
- Awwwww
(staggering) Awwwww
' expect you to return all phone calls and take me to lunch today
'll be back out here on my break
Nobody quits me
'Wana runs to her car
She speeds off
Uncle Elroy goes for the water hose
Craig grabs Day-Day
- can't see
can't see
Daddy
Lay down, Day-Day
Stop moving
Craig puts him on the grass
- She pepper-sprayed me, man
She pepper- sprayed me
know, be still
Before he can say another word, Uncle Elroy nearly drowns him with the water hose
Boy, you got you a little fatal attraction, huh
had two or three of them in my day
Day-Day is drowning
(cont'd) Craig,  hope you know how to deal with women better than this fool
Craig moves the hose
That's too much water
Now Day-Day is blind and choking
Help him to his feet
Let's get him to the bathroom
They get him up and into the house
- They rush Day-Day into the shower
- (confused) Hold on
What you doing
Uncle Elroy turns on the cold water
Day-Day screams
He tries to get out
They push him back in
Wet your eyes, boy
Stay in there for about 20 minutes
- 20 minutes
Yeah, 20 minutes
Trust me
've been pepper sprayed nine times
20 minutes
Uncle Elroy slams the door
Day-Day stands in the shower fully dressed and soaking wet
(cont'd) Let me show you my back yard
You know it's bigger than y'all back yard
They exit, leaving Day-Day in the shower
'   - Uncle Elroy and Craig start to walk around the back yard
In the
, we  giant weed plants everywhere
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig
never thought 'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs
But as soon as  got my check, was gone
Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house
You paid cash
Cash money
They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan
That's for suckas
They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago
got the only house on the block that's paid for
That's why 'm the king around here
They walk over to the pool
(cont'd) You like that pool
It's half-full with dirty water
An upside-down lawn chair floats in it
It's cool, but where's the water
Don't need water
We didn't have no pool in the projects
so none of us swim
'all never use it
Never
(humping the air) But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though
The Jacuzzi water has a purple condom floating in it
Uncle Elroy reaches over and picks it out
(cont'd) (shaking the water off the condom) You welcome get in it anytime you want to
Shit, you my brother's son
That's okay, Unc
can't swim, either
Good
- run-down crack house sits alone in the middle of the block
It looks deserted with chipped paint, overgrown grass and security bars everywhere
Inside we can hear a  in progress
(
) Ezal, 'm sick of you coming around here wit no money
Suddenly the door flies open and Ezal comes flying out on his ass
be damned
He gets up and brushes himself off
He heads back into the crack house
(cont'd) Now look here, man
'mma preferred customer and  can take my credit card somewhere else
Ezal is roughed up some more and flies through the picture window
rains down
(cont'd) Oh, my neck, oh, my back
Man,  quit
'm retired
Officially
Life shouldn't be this hard for a crackhead
Ezal lays there in pain
Out of nowhere, a bicycle comes Ezal looks up at the rider
It's Debo
Where did Craig move to
don't know, Debo
Debo rolls on top of him with the front tire
Ezal is smashed and in more pain
What you say
(hurting) He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day
Rancho Cucamonga
Yeah
Debo thinks about it
(cont'd) can't breathe
He rolls off of Ezal
Relief
Get on
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that
Get on
Ezal hops on the handlebars quick
They start to ride off
Just don't go over the curb
Debo rides over the curb and into the street
The journey begins
(cont'd) Watch my balls
-'  - Day-Day's room is junky
Clothes are everywhere
He's putting on his Pinky's Records and Disc -shirt
Craig comes in
You straight
- Yeah, 'm alright
Is my face still orange to you
Day-Day's face looks sunburned
Just a little
- can't taste nothing
What's the matter with your girlfriend
- Man, it's a long story
met 'Wana three months ago
She had a little pudge in her stomach but  didn't pay it no attention
Come to find out, she six months pregnant
Saying 'm the daddy
What
- Yeah,  broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since
She don't care about the restraining order or nothing
Restraining order
Where the hell you meet this girl
- went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way
Worst day of my life
Damn, you got a stalker
- That ain't the worst part
Her little sister, Baby
She's the one that gets real physical
But  got a restraining order on her, too
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby
- (very serious) You don't know Baby
He looks at his watch
- (cont'd) gotta get to Pinky's before  get fired like you
Day-Day exits
Craig is close behind
'  - As they walk out the front door, someone catches Craig's eye
It's  (23), the Joker brothers' fine sister
She's leaning against the lowrider, looking into her purse
She waves at them
(friendly) Hi
Craig and Day-Day are mesmerized
(waving back) Craig and Karla's eyes meet
She smiles
Who is that
- That's the sister
Yo know what
'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga
- know what 'cha thinking
thought the same thing
But it can't happen
Why
- Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy
And 'm just trying to keep the peace
We moved out here to get away from that shit
Day-Day walks over to his Beamer
Craig follows
- Big scratch on the side of Day-Day's car
- (cont'd) It ain't that bad, is it
Craig is still looking at Karla
- (cont'd) Craig
It ain't that bad, is it
Yeah, it's bad
And that scratch make it ugly
Day-Day is starting to get mad
(cont'd) It's long and crooked
make you not wanna even drive it
- Alright, alright
see what you talking about
Karla looks at her watch and starts to walk up the street
This is Craig's chance
Hold up, Day-Day
He trots after her
- Let it go
Karla is still walking
Hey
Hey
She stops and waits for him
(cont'd) 'm Day-Day's cousin, Craig
What's your name
Karla
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together
Where you going
To the Cucamonga shopping center
Oh yeah, why you walking
My brothers won't give me a ride
Day-Day is about to have a heart attack
He's looking back and forth between Craig and Karla, and the Joker's house where somebody is looking out the window
- (to himself) Just get the number and come on
Just get the number and come on
Back at the "Love Connection," Craig has Karla smiling
You want us to give you a ride
don't know
What you mean, you don't know
Just wait here
Craig starts to trot over towards Day-Day
Day-Day is frantically waving Craig to hurry
(cont'd) What are you worried about
Day-Day's eyes get as big as golf balls
- Cheeco
Craig turns to see the pit bull "Cheeco" running right after him
Cheeco, no
Craig runs right towards Day-Day's
- Oh shit, jump
They both jump on top of Day-Day's  with  coming up fast
He's  viciously
Joker, Li'l Joker and Baby Joker are across the street laughing
Karla is embarrassed
Craig is breathing hard but he's calm, but Day-Day is terrified
- (cont'd) Hey, Joker
Stop playing, man
Call the dog back
They continue to laugh
Craig pulls his belt off
He swings it and hits Cheeco in the middle of his forehead with the buckle
The   and runs back across the street
The Jokers aren't laughing anymore
Joker stares at Craig
Craig stares back
You can feel the tension
Joker kicks the dog
Get yo dumb ass in the back
Craig and Day-Day get off the top of the - Look at my roof
Big dents in the roof of his
- (cont'd) Man, why you do that
told you not to talk to that girl
Why not
She was cool with it
Day-Day gets into the car
- So
What you mean, so
- If you 'get into it' with them
's and start a feud, you can always go back to home
gotta live here
Just remember that
He slams the door, starts the car and backs up
Leaving Craig standing there
He sees Karla walking away
He looks over at the Jokers
They're still staring hard
Craig just looks away and walks into the house
'  - Craig steps into the house
Nephew, you got perfect timing
Uncle Elroy is sitting on the couch
He has a Phillies' Blunt (cigar) in one hand, a razor blade in the other
(cont'd) We about to start a little puff, puff give in this mothafucka
Are you down
Suga is sippin' on a glass of wine
She moves over, making room in the middle
(patting the couch) Come on, Craig
Sit down right here
Craig does
Suga moves closer, boxing him in nice and tight
Uncle Elroy licks the cigar
know you smoke weed, right
Why you say that
'Cause your lips is getting black
Uncle Elroy takes the razor and starts to cut the cigar the long way
(cont'd) All  smoke is blunts
Them fuckin' Zigzags don't do nothing for me
Uncle Elroy scrapes the cigar shavings into a nearby trash can (that's overflowing with cigar shavings already)
Suga presses against Craig
Would you like a glass of wine, baby
No thank you
It's too early
Uncle Elroy stuffs the open cigar full of weed
He's concentrating
Boy,  can roll a blunt better than them bitches in Havana
know Willie don't let'cha smoke in the house, but 'm ya uncle
don't care how high you get in my house
Long as you let me hit it
He licks and rolls
(cont'd) Look at that
It's perfect
Fire it up, Roy
Uncle Elroy grabs the lighter
Now 'mma show you the real "Puff Daddy
" He lights the blunt
Craig's watching, so is Suga
Uncle Elroy holds the smoke in for a very long time
Maybe too long
'cause his eyes start to bulge, and he starts to toke (cough with your mouth closed)
And toke
And toke
And toke
It looks like he's about to bust when he lets out a big puff of smoke
Then he starts to cough, and cough, and cough out of control
Craig and Suga are amazed at this display
Uncle Elroy falls to the floor on his hands and knees
Still coughing
He falls on his back and passes the blunt to Craig
(cont'd) (still coughing) It's the Bombay
Craig takes the blunt and puts it up to his lips
He hits it, holds it in and looks at Suga
Suddenly, his eyes bulge out and he starts to toke, and toke, and toke, and toke
He starts to cough out of control and he falls next to Uncle Elroy who's still coughing
Craig passes the blunt to Suga, who looks at it for a moment and then looks directly  the (As if to say, "Shiiiiiiiiiiiit
")
'  - 15 All three are passed out on the couch
Uncle Elroy is snoring with a little slobber hanging
Craig's knocked out with his mouth open
Suga's head is not secure and she's starting to bob
She bobs so hard that her head falls in Craig's lap
He wakes up and looks down
Suga
He looks over at Uncle Elroy who's looking over at him
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman
(confused and dazed) don't know
Suga
(face in lap) Huh
What you doing to my nephew
(lifting her head) Ah, baby
thought this was you
(to Craig) Craig, what are you doing to me
don't know,  think  passed out or something
don't remember
Passed out
Can't hang, huh
Boy, knew you was a lightweight
Passed out on one funky ass blunt
They don't make 'em like they used to, baby
Uncle Elroy staggers to his feet
(cont'd) Come on, woman
'm faded and feeling - rated
It's Mr
Nasty time
Mr
Nasty time
Mr
Nasty time
(grabbing his back) But take it easy on me, girl
Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here
Suga takes Elroy's hand
Make yourself at home
They both stumble upstairs leaving Craig all alone
It's too quiet now
He grabs the remote and   the
Flicks a few channels
He picks up the blunt and the lighter
public service announcement from King/Drew Rehab Center
It's
(
) Hi, my name is Smokey
And 'm a bud- head
But here at the King/Drew Rehab Center, they help you curve your crave for marijuana but still let you get your drank on
He lifts a 22 oz
bottle of Olde English
(cont'd) (
) It's too hard to stop everything all at once
So some days they let you smoke, but not drank
And other days you can drank, but not smoke
And if you're really making progress, the nurses will get fucked up wit you
Helping you kick the habit by smoking up all yo shit
So come down to the King/Drew Rehab Center and put down the joint, but
, man
Craig is high
He's looking at the  with a slight smile on his face
It seems like the walls are shaking
He looks over at Suga's glass and her wine is vibrating, like Jurassic Park
Plaster falls from the ceiling
He listens, it's Uncle Elroy and Suga making love
(
) Oh, baby, right there
Right there
bite the nipple, baby
Bite it
Bite it
Yeah, mothafucka -- yeah, come on, baby, get busy
His eavesdropping is interrupted by a loud  on the door
Craig is so comfortable, he doesn't want to move
The gets
(
) Delivery
Hold on
Craig gets up slowly and starts to clean the area
The (
) Delivery
said hold on
(
) Could you hurry up, please
it's kinda hot out here
Craig stops what he's doing and swings the door open
The  , a thirtysomething asshole with tight shorts and a buzz cut, is looking into the house
Can  help you
Nice house
Didn't expect you to answer
You must be one of those entertainers
What team you play for

Come on, jerky, you can tell me
Got a white wife, huh
Blonde bombshell type
Remember what happen to

You're not related to the Jacksons, are you
(in his face) Naw,  play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers
You want tickets
Okay, buddy
Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me
It's just a certified mail delivery
He hands Craig a letter
(cont'd) Sign here
Craig signs
What is it
Delinquent Property Tax Notice
hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go
Wife stays here, of course
He laughs and walks off singing the "Good Times" jingle
(cont'd) '
temporary layoffs
Good Times
hustling and surviving
Good Times
ain't we lucky we got'em
' Oh shit
Cheeco starts to chase him down the street
Craig looks at the notice
" --   9AM
" Oh damn
He  the
We  Craig upstairs  Uncle Elroy's room
He knocks softly
(cont'd) Uncle Elroy
No answer
(cont'd) Uncle Elroy, you got a tax notice
Still no answer
He turns the knob
It's open
'  - Craig steps into Uncle Elroy's freak palace
Black lights, candles, velvet posters - the works
There's even a leather fuck swing hanging from the ceiling
Uncle Elroy and Suga are asleep in a leopard-skin waterbed
Craig is amazed
He slowly walks over to the bed
Uncle Elroy is calling the hogs
Snoring
(whispering) Uncle Elroy
Uncle Elroy
He's about to shake him when Uncle Elroy lets out a big grunt
It startles Craig
He looks over at Suga
She's completely under the covers
Uncle Elroy rolls over on his stomach, then he rolls on his back again
Craig shakes him
(cont'd) Uncle Elroy, wake up
You got a letter today
No response
Craig tries again
(cont'd) Unc
Uncle Elroy jumps up like a hibernating grizzly
(half asleep) Come on here, Suga
He goes after Craig, who has to fight him off
(cont'd) like it rough now
Naw, naw
Unc, wake up
It's me
Wake up
Uncle Elroy grabs him in a bear hug and slams him on the bed
Craig finds himself caught between Suga and Uncle Elroy, but now everything is totally still and quiet
Uncle Elroy starts to snore again
He's asleep
The coast is clear now
Craig tries to make his escape
He crawls over Suga to get away
She grabs him and starts to kiss him
(half asleep) Ohhh, baby
Craig breaks away and tries to hurry out the room
On his exit, he hangs himself on the "fuck swing" and hits the floor with a thud
He scrambles to his feet, then he's out of there
Uncle Elroy and Suga lay asleep as if nothing ever happened
Craig tries to gain his composure
He gets an idea
- Debo is riding Ezal on the handlebars
We gotta stop or something, man
My ass is hurting
This handlebar is hard
Debo keeps riding
(cont'd) Debo
Debo
Now you stuck on stupid
He finally stops at a pay phone
Ezal jumps off and grabs his ass
(cont'd) My God
gotta walk it out, walk it out
Man, it's gonna take us a week to ride out there
Shut up
He still eats here every day
-   - Mr
Jones' dog truck sits in front
Here's the plan
You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr
William Jones
What urgent message
If you shut up 'll tell you
The urgent message is
Drop everything
Craig is in trouble
Come quick, don't call
That ain't gonna work
Debo slaps him in the back of the head
Just do it
don't know the number
Smack
Debo slaps him again
It's on the outside of the building, now pick the phone up
Ezal picks up the phone
He starts to dial
Hello
Yeah,  got an urgent message for a nigga named Mr
Willie Jones
Debo slaps him again
William
Yeah,  got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones
Drop everything, Craig is in trouble
Come quick
Don't try to call
Ezal hangs up the phone
(cont'd) Man, you better stop hittin' on me for do you like Craig did you
Let's go
Debo and Ezal run across the street to the dog truck
Debo opens the back and lets all the dogs out
They run for it
(cont'd) After  get in, close the door
Debo is a hard fit
Ezal stuffs him in there
You too big
Keep pushing
Finally he's in
Ezal gets in and slams the door shut
Just then, Mr
Jones comes running out the joint with a sandwich in hand
Oh my God
He gets in and speeds off
- Cars pull in and out of this 12 store strip mall where Pinky's is located
'    - Everything is pink inside this mom and pop record store
The latest    in the
few people exit the store with bags
Day-Day is scanning inventory
bud-head by the name of is on top of the counter with his skateboard
Yo, Day-Day
Check me out
He tries to jump off the counter and land perfectly on his board
Wrong
Off the board and on his ass
- Look, Roach,  know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited
But if Pinky catches you doing that -Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired
You feel me
feel you
've just been practicing that one move all week
(disappointed) thought that was it
An unhappy  walks in holding a  without the cover
#1 can't get jiggy with this shit
(getting loud) Where is the damn manager
- Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment
'm currently running the store
Can  see the
The customer throws the  on the counter
Day-Day picks it up
#1 No, give me my damn money back
Right now, and  don't have no damn receipt neither
- Okay, sir
but where's the cover
#1 don't have no damn cover
Craig walks in with the notice in hand
- can't give you your damn money back on this
#1 Bullshit
'll go postal in this mothafucka
- Well, you gonna have to go postal then
The customer  over a counter display and then turns to get away
- (cont'd) Hey
Craig bumps him and he falls into the Rap cassette rack
#1 'm sorry
Don't hit me
Don't hit me
He jumps up and slips on a few more cassettes on his scramble out the door
- and if you come back, it's gonna be worse
Roach can't believe what just happened
Did you see that
That was a
hit right there, huh, Day-Day
- Yeah, it was
How you get up here
walked
- You walked
Yeah, ya'll got a notice today
It came certified mail
He gives it to Day-Day
- Craig, this Roach
Roach, this is my cousin, Craig
What up, bro
Craig nods his head
tried to wake up Uncle Elroy but he thought  was Suga
Day-Day reads the notice
- You know what this is
Yeah, that's why  walked down here
What it say
Day-Day ignores Roach
- How can they do this
don't know
Did ya'll forget to pay it or something
What it say
- Ever since my momma died the bills are always late
See how much it is
Day-Day opens it
starts to
What is it
- Don't worry about it, man
Get the phone
Roach skateboards over to the phone
Pinky's
Day-Day reads on
- It says we owe $3,900
by tomorrow
Damn
how much money ya'll got left from the lottery
Day-Day goes for his bank book
He flips a few pages
- $247
Okay, plan
Day-Day is overwhelmed
Roach skates back over
That was a girl on a cell phone
She said she's outside in the parking lot waiting for you to take her to lunch
Day-Day looks at Craig
He runs over to the door
'Wana sits in her car with her play sister ' (her name does not fit her body)
- Oh my God
That's 'Wana
And she got Baby' with her
Day-Day locks the door and runs into the back
Craig and Roach follow
What's the matter
- 'Wana brought Baby' up here
That the big one, huh
- You damn right that's the big one
The  starts to  again
'Wana and Baby' are at the door
'Wana is on her phone
Baby' starts to knock
- (cont'd) Craig, go out there and tell 'em 'm gone
ain't trying to get in it
- You already in
The knocking gets louder
No 'm not
'll do it
- No
You can't handle a girl like 'Wana
It's got to be Craig
They observe the "Yes We're Open" sign
' That white boy said he was in there
' Day-Day, don't make me break this window
Craig is peeking out
He hesitates
- Watch out for Baby'
Craig walks out the back
He steps over the door
Unlocks it, and cracks it open
Day-Day ain't here
They don't believe him
' Who are you
'm his cousin
' You suppose to work here now or something
Yeah,  work here now
' We didn't come here for Day-Day
Yes you did
' No we didn't
We came to buy a
' Now move
Baby' kicks the door
Craig has no choice but to let 'em in
' Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here
don't know
think he went out the back
' Can  look for myself
Suddenly Roach is pushed into the front area
Hey, ladies
' Where's Day-Day
don't know, he must've left
'Wana looks at Baby'
thought ya'll wanted to buy a
' do
can you help me find the jazz section
Craig looks at Roach for directions
He nods over towards the front of the store
Right this way
You know damn well you don't listen to no jazz
Baby' checks out Craig as he leads the way
'Wana looks around
' If Day-Day comes back, tell him  came by and need to see him
Lamaze classes are Wednesday
Will do
'Wana starts to walk towards Craig and Baby'
' Come on, ', let's go
But first she doubles back towards the storage room
Where you going
' Ain't the rest room this way
gotta pee
Yeah
' Thank you
As she's walking in the back, Roach realizes his mistake
- Shit
Day-Day makes a run for it
She spots him ducking out the back door
' He's in there
Baby' knocks Craig out of the way
' Where is he
' He ran out the door
Baby' gives chase with 'Wana, Craig and Roach close behind
'    - Day-Day runs around the side of Pinky's Records store
He stops to see if anyone is coming
It's Baby' with the three others trailing
Baby' is chasing Day-Day all through the parking lot
Craig, 'Wana and Roach stop to watch
Haul ass, dude
Don't stop
and he is
You better stop running from that girl
- Fuuuuuuck --
He runs back towards his
The chase continues around his car
Baby' is starting to tire
- (cont'd) 'mma shoot yo' big ass
'Wana watches from a distance
Craig and Roach are close
(smiling) She moves well for a big girl
Just then, out of nowhere, Karla appears behind them carrying a couple of bags
She taps Craig on his shoulder
He turns around
Hello, remember me
Hell yeah,  remember you
'm sorry for what my brother did this morning
They're assholes
It's cool
You ain't got to apologize for your brothers
They're big boys
just wanted to give you this
She hands him a card with her number on it
(cont'd) If my brothers wasn't so over-protective, 'd have you call the house
But for now just page me when you get a chance
Most definitely
Better sooner than later
She picks up her shopping bags and walks away
Over at the chase: Baby' is winded
She bends over trying to catch her breath
- Baby', you're not going to catch me as usual
So what can we do to end it this time
What you want
Another Big Pun 'Cause  gotta get back to work
Baby' looks over at Craig
' Okay,  know what  want this time
- Anything you need
' Yo' cousin, Craig
Hook us up
- That's it
' Just tell him to come over here and talk to me
- And  can go free
' Go, fo'  change my mind
Day-Day carefully walks back over towards the store
'Wana pouts and walks towards Baby'
(If looks could kill
) Great moves, Day-Day
What happen
- We worked out a deal
All you gotta do is go over there and talk to Baby'
Craig looks over at Baby'
She's waiting
What you mean talk to her
(still smiling) You know what he mean, dude
'm gone
Craig turns and sprints into the store
Baby' looks concerned
Day-Day grabs Roach and they run into the store
' 'mma get you, Day-Day
You gotta come out sometimes
'Wana hands her a brick
' told you
Baby' screams and throws the brick through Day-Day's '    - - What was that
(looking out window) You don't wanna know
Day-Day is devastated
- Thanks a lot, Craig
know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters
- Big bitches need love, too, Craig
For sure
That's how  like 'em
Not me
- Are they still out there
Negative
they vamped
Day-Day starts to walk into the back storage area
(cont'd) Shouldn't we straighten up out here before Pinky gets back
Day-Day is like a zombie now
He doesn't answer, just keeps walking
Day-Day
No answer
Craig looks at Roach
They follow
Day-Day sits with the notice in hand
- Today ain't my day
Bummer, huh
And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day
Yeah it is
the best day before the weekend
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig
Day-Day is still sad
(cont'd) know how you feeling
And if  had my bong right now, 'd let you 'toke 'til you choke
'  Dude, right here
All out
No lungs
All  got is this
Roach pulls out a big, smashed brownie with green shit in it
What's the green stuff poking out
That's cron-don, sir
My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies
Wanna bite
Naw,  already ate
Come on, Day, try it
For moms
Day-Day shakes his head
Craig reaches into his fifth pocket
It ain't a bong but, wa-la
He has the joint from this morning
Wo
Roach snatches it
Hey
Craig snatches it back
Sorry, bro, reflexes
How did you do that
Black magic
Day-Day snatches the joint and puts it in his mouth
- Give me dat
'm the one with the problem
Roach pulls out a mini-skateboard that's actually a lighter
Weed doesn't solve problems
It eases the mind, and the soul
Enjoy
He lights the joint
Day-Day takes a hit
didn't think you smoked bud that much
- (letting out the smoke) don't
(taking the joint) do
- Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint didn't even pass it
(hitting it good) Sorry, dude
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out
- Ain't no windows in here
got an idea
He hands the joint to Craig
Gets up and closes the door
Then he grabs the vacuum out of the corner
(cont'd) This is a little theory of mine
it should work
He plugs in the  and  it
He puts the nozzle in Day-Day's face
- Blow
That ain't gonna work
Fuck yeah
Day-Day hits the ' and blows into the nozzle
It quickly sucks up the smoke
- (passing the ') It works
Still gonna smell it
No way
Watch this
Roach hits the joint harder than anyone else
Smoke starts to come out of his ears
Craig and Day-Day get a kick out of that
'    - pink limo pulls to a stop
The chauffeur gets out wearing his suit just a little too tight
He opens the door and a pair of pink boots hit the pavement
The (35), the asshole owner
Look, man, you hittin' them goddamn corners too fast
Slow down
almost spilled my Hennessy on this 300 dollar suit
He walks over to the door
He thinks it's open
It's not
(cont'd) be damn
He shakes the door
It's locked
He looks inside
No one's at the counter
Cassettes all over the floor
Pinky looks around making sure no one sneaks up on him
He reaches under his shirt and pulls out a Glock 9mm
Sticks his key in the door and steps in
-   - is upside down
All the blood has rushed to his head
He has Chinaman eyes and a big smile on his face
- Roach, what are you doing
--- Intensely
big cloud of smoke rolls out of his mouth and he falls and hits the deck
(cont'd) My spleen
Craig and Day-Day laugh at Roach
The  is still but the room is very smoky
Craig jumps in
(unplugging the vacuum) This vacuum don't work
Where's the restroom
- Out the door and to the left
thought the vacuum would work
Craig makes a left and grabs the knob
He feels something pressing on the back of his head (gun)
(whispering) Don't move or 'll blow your head smooth off
Craig throws his hands up
(cont'd) Now back up slowly
and don't say a word
He obeys
Pinky backs Craig into the store
(cont'd) Get on the floor
Craig gets down
(cont'd) Little mothafucka trying to rob me
'mma show you how  do 'em
ain't trying to rob you
Shut up
Fo'  pump this Glock in yo' ass
What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach
Man, Day-Day is my people
said shut up
Now who sent you
Nobody
If you say another word, it's over
'm not playing
Pinky starts to pat down Craig's pockets
(cont'd) You ain't got no gun, but where's the weed at
smell it
Craig says nothing
(cont'd) 'mma tie you ass up
Pinky backs up and steps on Roach's skateboard
The gun goes flying and so does he
Pinky falls on his ass
The 9mm lands in front of Craig
There's a big scramble for the gun
The mood is serious
- gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow
You could sell your Beamer
Day-Day gives Roach the evil-eye
(cont'd) My bad
- don't know
hope Craig got a good idea
We gotta ask him when he comes out
Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money
- Yoooo, that's it
You ain't as dumb as think you are, Roach
know
Pinky and Craig are still scrambling for the gun
The store looks like a tornado hit it
Twice
Craig comes up with the pistol
Pinky jumps on the ground
Don't kill me
Craig is exhausted
He stands over Pinky with the gun
Shut up
been trying to tell yo' ass that
Day-Day is my cousin
They're right there in the back
Whatever you say, man
didn't see shit
The safe combination is 34-5-27
Just take it all
Just then, Day-Day and Roach come from the back
- Craig, what the hell are you doing
Nothing
Day-Day, is this your cousin
- Yeah
Good
You fired
and, Roach, your fired too
Why me
smell weed
He looks up at Craig
(cont'd) And you
you lucky
was just about to get in yo' ass
Now give me my pistol back and get the hell out my store
Craig looks at Day-Day
Day-Day looks back at him
Nobody's high now
-   - Mr
Jones' dog truck is weaving in and out of traffic
-   - Mr
Jones is driving and eating at the same time
He finishes off the last few bites of his sandwich
Just hold on, Craig
'm on my way
- Debo and Ezal are smashed inside the dog cages
Debo
Debo
What
can't feel my legs no more
Me neither
How far is Rancho Cucamonga
don't know
'  - The Beamer pulls into the driveway
Our trio get out with very long faces
(
) In a strange way,  feel responsible for Day-Day getting fired
If  wouldn't have fought Pinky, and gave Day-Day the joint, he'd still have a job
Day-Day walks into the house while Craig and Roach stay out on the porch
'  -  - Uncle Elroy opens his bedroom door wearing a & mask and holding a tube of  jelly
He removes the mask
Day-Day hands him the notice
Uncle Elroy takes it with his greasy hands
Ah damn
Damn
- got fired too
What
He starts to beat Day-Day with a sex toy
-   - The dog truck exits the freeway
He pulls into a gas station by the freeway
He stops near the restrooms and jumps out, air freshner in hand
When he gets to the door, it's locked
Damn
He knocks
(cont'd) Say, man, hurry up
We got an emergency out here
No answer
Mr
Jones paces nervously
(cont'd) knew  shouldn't have ordered that extra hot sauce
'  -   - Craig and Day-Day are trying to think
Roach is practicing skateboard moves
He's not very good
- Man, sit down
- He knocks again
Say, man, what the hell you doing in there
Open the door
Just then the door opens and out walks
Don't nobody go in the bathroom for about 35, 40 minutes
Mr
Jones is stunned
Hey, you that boy
Jordan jumps in his car and he's gone
Mr
Jones is happy he's just seen Michael Jordan
(cont'd) (smiling) Ain't that something, Michael Jordan
He walks in the bathroom
Reality hits, it stinks up in there
Mr
Jones fronds
(cont'd) Oh, Michael, that boy better check his drawls
He starts to spray
'  -   - Craig, Day-Day and Roach are sitting on the porch thinking
- What we gonna do
don't know yet
know what 'mma do
Go home and face the music
My dad is gonna kick my ass for getting fired again
He gets on his skateboard
- Alright, Roach, see you around
Sorry about today, man
Yeah, me too
Later
He attempts to jump off the porch with his board and lands dead on his ass once again
His board continues to roll
- Man, sit down
can't think with you falling everywhere
His board continues to roll into the street
At this same time, Joker's low-rider rolls by and breaks his board in two
Roach runs to pick up the pieces
My board
The Joker Bros
back their low-rider into the driveway
They have no sympathy
Cheeco (the pitbull) is in the back yard
He's happy to see them
They stroll into the house with three Mexican girls with them
Joker spots our trio looking
What the fuck you looking at
- Nothing
You ran over my board
So what
It shouldn't have been in the street
They disappear into the house
Craig has a twinkle in his eyes and Roach walks over, pissed
Who the fuck is that, Day-Day
- Let it go, Roach, trust me
'm not letting nothing go
They killed my board
- Let it go
Craig is looking over at the Joker's house
Baby Joker walks out the front door
He walks over to the rider and  the Wait
Check'em out
Baby Joker pulls out a chrome hydraulic pump
He carries it towards the house
Cheeco starts to hump his leg
Get down
Baby Joker drops the pump, something falls out
(We can't see what it is
)  Baby Joker quickly puts it back
You see that
- didn't see nothing
Me neither
It's something in that hydraulic pump
- Yeah, air
Naw
bet'cha it's something better than air
- How you know
It could be anything
don't know, and it could be anything
But  just say we go take a look
say we go over there and kick their asses
can take the little one
- Are you out your mind
'm not messing with them
's boy
You must be crazy
Could be
Rather be crazy than homeless
Now all we need is a big pack of baloney
Day-Day and Roach look at each other
Baloney
'  -  - The private party is starting to heat up
Big Joker sits on the couch with a    on his lap
He's smoking on a perfectly rolled cone joint
Li'l Joker dances with the other girlfriend, as an     in the
The other senorita is pouring herself a drink
Karla walks into the room
thought you were taking me to see Mama
'll take you later
When
After you get all drunk and loaded
Hey
said 'll take your fuckin' ass later
Now get out of here
You're scaring our company
Karla storms out the room
Baby Joker walks in carrying the chrome pump
(cont'd) Get up
The Pretty Girl moves off Joker's lap
(cont'd) Take it in the room
Baby Joker carries the pump in the bedroom
Joker is close behind
He  the
The Girl dancing with Li'l Joker gets too nosy
#1 What was that
' What was what
#1 That silver thing
' didn't see no silver thing, and neither did you
'  - Craig, Day-Day and Roach are sneaking across the street towards Joker's house
Craig looks calm
Day-Day looks nervous
Roach eats on a piece of baloney
- This ain't gonna work
'm going back
Day-Day tries to turn around
Craig grabs him
It's about to work, just come on
(about to bite baloney) What about the dog
Craig slaps the baloney out of his hand
That's what the baloney's for
All three kneel down next to a parked car
Day-Day looks sick
- Man,  don't think  can do this, Craig
got the -'s
What's the -'s
- (holding his stomach) The bubble guts
'm so nervous it feels like 'mma shit on myself
Try an' hold it, man
Squeeze your ass cheeks together
- Butterflies, my ass
'm about to go home
Craig grabs Day-Day again
Look, Day-Day
If we don't go over there and take a look, this might be the last night you got a home
Now trust me
Day-Day realizes that Craig is right
He takes a deep breath
(cont'd) Now all we gotta do is find out where the little one put that pump
Take it and see what's in it
- You make it sound so easy
It is easy
You know why
'Cause they're not expecting it
Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco
Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look
Dude, dogs hate me
don't know why
Me and -9's just don't get along
Well get along with this one
(pushing Roach) Go ahead of us
Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight
Fuck, what's his name
Cheeco
Roach crawls away on his hands and knees
'  - Roach sneaks past Joker's lowrider
He slowly approaches the fence
No sign of Cheeco
Roach opens the pack of baloney and pulls out a slice
(nervous whisper) Here, Cheeco
Chee-co, here boy
That's a good boy
It's pitch-black behind the fence, still no Cheeco
- Craig makes a move
Come on, he should have'em by now
Day-Day follows
- Hurry up
He didn't have that much baloney
They sneak up to the side of the house
The  is the walls
Li'l Joker is dancing with all 3 girls
They're all getting high and feeling good
One girl has come out of her blouse
The others start to follow her lead
' (yelling towards bedroom) Hey, homes, you guys better hurry up
'mma get greedy
Craig and Day-Day are peeking through the window
Craig moves on
Day-Day is still watching
- (to himself) Look at those tig-ole-bitties Craig snatches him from the window
They walk over to the fence
You go first
- Naw, you go first
You go first
- No
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence 'mma throw you over
- ain't scared of you
We ain't little no more
Day-Day gets ready to fight
What
Craig jumps like he's going to hit him
Day-Day jumps back and almost falls
- hope to God that dog is happy
Me too
is having no luck
Cheeco is nowhere to be found
Roach starts to sing
My baloney has a first name
It's -h-e- e-c-o
We hear a   out of the darkness
Roach continues
(cont'd) My baloney has a second name it just like the first Cheeco
gets
(cont'd) Ooooohhhh  love to eat it everyday if you ask me what 'll say
We can hear    at Roach
(cont'd) Cheeco's got to be the dumbest fuckin' mutt in the whole wide
is running at Roach full speed
He jumps on the fence and starts to  with everything he's got
Roach drops the baloney
- hear the   and freeze in their tracks
Day-Day tries to run
Craig grabs him, again
Wait
- (loud whisper) Wait for what
of
Nothing coming
He's still over by Roach
picks up the baloney and stuffs the whole pack into his mouth
is
Roach is relieved
'  - The chrome pump is open and filled with money
Baby Joker's pulling out the money while Joker sits on the bed counting it
They stop when they hear
Want me to take a look
No, keep working
In the mirror behind Joker, we see a stick slide through the curtain
The curtain cracks just enough to see Craig's eye looking in
Just then, Li'l Joker bursts through the door with his shirt off and two half-naked girls on his arms
' Yo, man fuck that shit
Do it later
It's Friday, time to party,
Close the door
' Not until you come party with us, man
Baby Joker looks at the girls, then at Joker
Alright, put it in that drawer
Joker hands Baby Joker the money
He puts it away
They start to exit the room
'   - Craig is still looking
Day-Day is scared shitless
He's looking for Cheeco
- (whispering) What you see
That pump was full of money
saw where they put it
Stay right here, 'mma climb in and go get it
- Wait here
So Cheeco can bite my ass off
Tell me where it is 'll do it
No, man, just wait
Craig climbs in the window
Day-Day holds his stomach
- got the -'s
his meat supply is almost gone
He tries to think fast
Cheeco starts to look for more meat
Roach grabs the smashed brownie out of his pocket and throws it to Cheeco
He swallows it in one big gulp
He's looking for more
There is no more
Roach smiles
Good boy
Nice dog
'
Suddenly Cheeco falls back on his butt and lets out a slight moan
' Cheeco is looking up at Roach
He's seeing double, even triple
Cheeco lays down
It looks like he's faded
No lungs, baby
No lungs
'  - Craig is in
The bedroom door is cracked
Craig walks over and shuts the door gently
He locks it
Then he creeps over to the dresser
He pulls out the pump and sets it on the bed
He opens it, revealing all the bundled-up money packed in
He starts to stuff it in his pockets
'   - Day-Day is trying to keep his composure
- The  brothers are having a good time
Joker is getting nasty with one of the Girls
He pulls her by the hand
#2 No
Fuck that
Joker picks her up and carries her to the bedroom
She screams
He laughs
He goes for the door
It's locked
(cont'd) Who locked this door
Everybody looks confused
(cont'd) Who locked this fuckin' door
Joker starts to kick the door
'  - Craig hurries to put the pump back
He's about to go for the window when:
There's a  on the door
All Craig can do is go for another door on the other side of the room
The door flies open and Craig is out there just in time
don't want no doors locked around here
You hear me
Joker walks in and hits the lights
He throws the girl on the bed
#2 Oh, poppy,  like it rough
(taking off shirt) Good, 'cause that's how you gonna get it
'  -  - Baby Joker has his back turned when we see Craig sprint behind him and up the stairs
Baby Joker turns around
He thinks he saw something
He slowly starts to walk up the stairs
' Karla
'  - Karla is in her room working out
Craig runs in
He's shocked to see her
She doesn't see him, but he's frozen
Then she turns around and he startles her
What are you doing
Think fast, Craig
Huh
What are you doing here
hope you don't think 'm crazy, but just had to come in here and show you ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers
and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life
What
So you snuck in my room to tell me that
Yes  did
Excuse me
Her door flies open
Smashing Craig behind it
It's Li'l Joker
' Who you talking to
Craig looks nervous
Nobody
' heard a voice
No you didn't
Get out my room
Go back down to your little girlfriends
Karla pushes Li'l Joker out
'   - Day-Day is having a fit
#2 (
) Shut the window
(
) You shut the window
She does
- Oh shit
Day-Day takes off
He hops the fence in record speed
is laying on his back looking through the fence
He's calm and cool now
Roach is on his back looking through the fence
He hits a joint and blows the smoke into Cheeco's face
like  was saying
guy like me, and a dog like you, don't need this bullshit
We need to be in Maui renting jet ski to fat funks in flower shirts
You feel me, Cheeco is passed out
Day-Day sneaks around the corner
He whispers
- Roach
Roach, come on
Where's Craig
- He's inside the house
Why did he go in the house
- Don't worry about it
We gotta figure out a way to get Craig out of there
He's probably getting tied up now
'  - Craig is sweating
Karla is standing in front of him
You did all this for me
Most of it
just hate to see you in this situation
Thanks for noticing
It used ta be peaceful before they got out
Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown
Why didn't she put'em out
Easier said than done
We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us
'm sorry to hear that
Craig walks over to the window
(cont'd) Can  get out this way
Karla walks up behind him, looking very sexy
thought you came up here to see me
Craig turns around
did
Is that door locked
It's locked
Make sure
Karla turns around to check the door
You so nervous,  already locked this door
Craig drops a thick roll of money into her purse
She shakes the knob
(cont'd) See
All locked
She walks over to him
They're face-to-face
(cont'd) What's your hurry
got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me
(getting even closer) So what
Let's make'em wait
Craig looks  the
be damn
'  - Day-Day and Roach are at Joker's front door
- You wanna knock
Go for it
Day-Day knocks real soft
Too soft
(cont'd) No one's gonna hear that
The music's playing
- 'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock
This is a knock
Roach starts to kick on the door with his foot
It's very loud
- Joker storms in with the
Li'l Joker is in the corner with his girl, and Baby Joker is on the floor
Joker You fuckin' lover boys hear that
Hear what
The  continues
Li'l Joker and Baby Joker push the girls aside and jump up
Li'l Joker grabs a big knife
Baby Joker grabs a 9mm
Joker looks at the girls
Don't fuckin' move
They won't
The brothers run to the door
Roach is still kicking
- What's wrong with you, fool
Stop kicking their door
They might think we the police
The front door swings open and before we know it
Day-Day's got an  pointed in his face, and Roach is looking at a 9 close up
What the fuck you want
Day-Day's tongue doesn't work
- Uh
um
mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar
What
This look like a 7-11 or something
Get the fuck outta here
- (starts to leave) Alright, no problem
We gone
Hold on
man, you broke my fuckin' board and  don't appreciate it
Immediately Day-Day and Roach are snatched inside the house, and the door is
'  - Mr
Jones' dog truck pulls to a stop
He gets out and runs to the house
He
Uncle Elroy answers
Suga is looking over his shoulder
got your message
Where's Craig
don't know,  didn't leave you no damn message
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message
Hell naw, Willie
Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain
Somebody left me a message
Well where's Craig and Day-Day
don't know
Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them
'   - Craig is about to climb out the window
Next time, page me first
Okay
Craig climbs out the window
He loses his footing and free falls into some bushes
You alright
Yeah, 'm cool
See you later
He runs past a sleeping Cheeco and hops the fence
Free at last
He's about to run back across the street when he sees the dog truck
(cont'd) What is he doing here
Craig ducks back
'  -  - Day-Day and Roach are sitting on a couch looking nervous
The Joker brothers hold guns on them
The three half-dressed Mexican Girls look a bit scared themselves
- Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding
All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar
And some rolling papers
- and some rolling papers, that's it
We didn't mean to mess up y'all get together or nothing
(to the Girls) How y'all doing
They answer -- Fine
- That's good
My name's Day-Day and this is my friend, Roach
(waving) Hey
- Ya'll live around here
Shut up
Both of you right now
- (to Roach) Shhhh
Roach, shut the fuck up
don't believe this sugar shit
Something ain't right
Joker thinks for a moment
Then he turns to Baby Joker
(cont'd) (in Spanish) Go check on the money
Baby Joker obeys the order
' Here comes Karla, put the guns away
Keep your mouth shut
Karla walks back in
Hey, what's going on
Nothing
What you want
Are you going to take me to see Mom
Take your car
'Take your car
' Yeah, and hurry up
Karla doesn't believe it
Okay
She grabs the keys off the bar
(cont'd) 'll be back in a bit
'Bye
She's out the door
Joker turns to Day-Day and Roach
If everything's alright
We might let you leave, too
'  - The front door swings open
It's Uncle Elroy
Craig, where the hell you been
Mr
Jones pops up
So does Suga and Miss Ho Kym
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy
Craig, what the hell wrong with you
Where you been
Have you seen Day-Day
No
Thought he was with you
Daddy, Uncle Elroy,  need your help
He steps in the house and closes the door behind him
'  -  - It's the same scene as before
Two angry Mexicans, three half-naked Girls, plus Day-Day and Roach in the middle
Baby Joker returns
(in Spanish) Some of the money is missing
(upset) What
- What
(as he looks at Roach) What that mean
don't know
It means you Miyateas are staying with us
(to Baby Joker) Get the duct tape
(to Li'l Joker) You know what to do
Li'l Joker turns to the girls
' Put your clothes back on
The scared Girls start to dress
'  - Karla backs up the rider and she's out
The Joker house looks quiet
Then the door opens and three Girls walk out
' Sorry you gotta walk, but 'll call you tomorrow
The Girls take off down the street
The porch lights go out
'  - Craig, Mr
Jones, Uncle Elroy, Suga and Miss Ho Kym are peeking out the window
You see that
saw it
Me, too
You think they're in there
Yup
Why for
Them boys are real player haters
It's a long story
Right now we gotta do somethin'
You come way out here to get into more trouble
You could've stayed at home
Willie, shut up
Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes
(rolling up his sleeve) Don't get it twisted, Elroy
ain't lost none of my street skills
If ya'll don't come back not in ten minutes, 'mma callin' the po'lice
Craig, Uncle Elroy and Mr
Jones are about to go on a mission
Wait a minute
gotta go get my shit
Uncle Elroy runs upstairs
'  -  - Li'l Joker is almost finished duct-taping Day-Day and Roach
Baby Joker holds the
Joker paces the floor
Day-Day and Roach try to make peace by singing an old "War" song
Day- Day is serious
- & 'Why can't we be friends
Why can't we be friends
Why can't we be friends
Why can't we be friends
'
- (still singing) ' hope my cousin call the
' Joker throws a  against the wall
It  into a million pieces
Shut the fuck up
The singing stops
(cont'd) If you don't tell me where my money is, 'mma show you how close we can get
- Money
Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers
We was going to get high, and  was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid
That's all
Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro
It's Friday
Joker walks over to Roach and kicks him in the mouth
'm hearing a lot of talking, but 'm not hearing the right words
Maybe the other guy took it
- Why would he take it
He don't even know you
(thinking) Shut up
Where's that other miyatea
'  - Uncle Elroy catches up with Craig and Mr
Jones on the side of Joker's house
He has a big chrome
357 magnum
That's a nice piece of heat right there
Thank you
only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing
Two bullets
Yo' ass ain't changed
Back in the day, all  had was a stick
Come on
They sneak over to the fence
What about that ugly dog
got my mase
He's on the other side, sleep
They start to hop the fence
starts to awake
He tries to stand up and stumbles back on his face
He lets out
Craig is over the fence
Mr
Jones is over  But Uncle Elroy is having a little trouble
(cont'd) Need some help
Need to lose some weight
Shut yo' ass up
Uncle Elroy falls off the fence
(cont'd) Damn
Craig & Mr
Jones helps him up
They creep over to the window - the shades are pulled down
'm not sure, but  think they're in this room
'  -  - Joker is getting tired of the games
And Day-Day is pleading for his life
Tape his mouth shut
- Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community
By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations
Yeah, brown and white relations, too
Day-Day looks at Roach
- Boy, you gonna get us killed
Li'l Joker grabs Day-Day and tapes his mouth shut
He does the same to Roach
'm sick and tired of bullshitting with you guys
(in Spanish) Baby brother, go get the chainsaw
Baby Joker hands him the  and he's gone
Day-Day and Roach look terrified
Everything has turned serious
'   - Debo and Ezal are still asleep
Debo wakes first
Ezal
Ezal
Huh
We must be here 'cause we stopped
Good, let's get out
They both try to get out
But it's no way to get out from the inside
Hey, how you get out of here
don't know
They both start to go nuts on the door
The dog truck is shaking like crazy
'  - Baby Joker walks out the back door
He stops in the middle of the yard
Cheeco
Cheeco
Here, boy
No Cheeco
He continues to a shed in the back yard
He goes inside and picks up a chainsaw
On his way out the shed, he's slapped in the face with a "Big Ass Stick
"  Mr
Jones is working the handle
Baby Joker is out cold
Mr
Jones stands over him
Nigga, you got knock the fuck out
Yeah, pops
Damn, big bro
You swung that like Sammy Sosa
The skills are still intact
Now tie his ass up, Elroy
He does
'  -  - The terror continues
My little brother went out to get my chainsaw
'mma show you what happens to fools who don't tell me what  wanna hear
You ever see Scarface, mothafucka
Day-Day starts to cry
Roach tries to scream through the tape
Joker turns to Li'l Joker
(cont'd) Go see what's taking him so long
Li'l Joker obeys
We  Li'l Joker  the house and the back door
'  - Li'l Joker stands at the back door
' Junior
Junior
No answer
Suddenly he spots something over by the shed
It's Baby Joker all ties up
'  (cont'd) What the
He runs to the rescue
But right before he gets to him, Uncle Elroy jumps out the bushes and takes him
"Ronnie Lott Style
"  Mr
Jones steps in with the stick
Craig steps in with the rope, and it's over
Uncle Elroy's hurt
It's his back
(in pain) My back
What's the matter
slip my disc, again
Oh got damn
Craig goes to assist Uncle Elroy
Stretch it out
Don't move me
'  -  - Joker is pissed
Where are these fucking guys
He storms out the room
Day-Day and Roach try to escape
They flap around on the ground like a fish out of water
'  - The back door flies open
Joker appears with the -47 in hand
He spots Uncle Elroy in the middle of the yard bent over
He lifts the
What you doing here

What it look like
Looks like a dead man
Out of nowhere, Craig hits Joker from the back
He flies one way and the gun flies another
Now it's really on
Hand-to- hand combat
Craig vs
Joker
Right vs
wrong
Good vs
evil
You know how it go
Go to the body, Craig
Go to the body
'  -  - Day-Day and Roach have made it a little further to the door, but they still look like fish searching for H2O
Uncle Elroy stumbles in
He grabs a knife and starts to cut them loose
Boy, Day-Day, 'mma kick yo' ass for getting me into this mess and hurting my back
moved out here to get away from this kinda shit
'  - Fight's still on
Craig is giving Joker the ass-whipping he deserves when Uncle Elroy, Day-Day and Roach reach the back porch
- Get 'em, Craig
Bite his ear
What 'em
Watch 'em
Joker takes a few more shots from Craig, then grabs Craig around the waist and slams him to the ground
Craig is hurt
(cont'd) Get off yo' back, Craig
Craig struggles with Joker, who now has the devil in his eyes
Ya'll mothafuckas help me
Day-Day and Roach look at each other
They rush to Craig's aide
Joker spots them coming, he also spots the
In  , Day-Day and Roach dive on Joker
at the same time Joker dives for the
Day-Day and Roach land on top of Craig and our trio try to hurry to their feet
But as soon as they get up, they're looking down the barrel of an - 47
(smiling) Say hello to my little friend
Debo hits Joker from the back
Joker is out cold
No way, Jose
This one is mine
Ezal picks up the gun and hands it to Debo
(cont'd) Hi, Craig, remember me
Craig knows he can't fight a gun
Everybody is helpless
We can hear  getting  and
Suddenly, out of nowhere
The pitbull is back
And he's mad as hell
He runs through everybody and jumps on Debo, knocking the gun from his hand
Craig and Day-Day jump on Debo
Roach , and Cheeco stops his attack on Debo
Cheeco runs over to Roach and jumps in his arms
Roach's being licked to death by the pitbull
- Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach
He's a boy, dude
'  - Out front, three sheriff cars swoop into the driveway
The cops jump out, guns drawn
'  - Debo and Ezal are tied up next to the Jokers
Mr
Jones, we was just playin'
He made me do it
Mr
Jones don't wanna hear it
Craig runs into the house

The  are on our heroes, guns drawn
Wait a minute

'Til you get back on yo' feet
Thanks, Roach, but  can't accept that
We're moving back to Watts where it's safe

He walks past the cops and crosses the street
There he go
What the hell is he carrying

They greet Craig and all start to walk towards the house
