Even as the flames from the wing echo fiery reflections on his cheeks, even as the young mother seated next to him clutches her newborn and wails towards God, even as bags fall from the overhead compartment at half-speed and the beverage cart slides down the aisle, Andrew Largeman sits peacefully; unaffected
He calmly reaches up and turns his air vent so it blows directly on him
He looks up to it  as the light flashes on and off

He's dazed
His body is there, but his mind seems absent
He reaches to the middle of the frame, almost at us, and pulls open both doors of the mirror he's been staring into
His face and chest are immediately replaced with the two dozen orange prescription drug canisters that immaculately line the shelves of his medicine cabinet
He closes the mirror doors and stares at himself

He manages to avoid eye contact with all of them as he tries to find an address while checking a piece of paper
He boards an outdoor escalator and starts climbing thL- stairs
After a moment he looks to his right through a window into a gym where a man on a Stairmaster is walking alongside him
Large registers something: he isn't going anywhere
to reveal he's been walking up on the down side
He stands still and lets it bring him all the way down, where he moves to the "Up" one and rises towards the next level

The  seated next to Large leans over to him
We're whores
Large looks at him

And to that  say, "If you would do this

Large stares absently out the window as compete with the obnoxious ramblings of Large suddenly squints his eyes and clutches his neck in pain
- Large pulls his car into a parking spot, throws "The Club" on his steering wheel and heads towards the back door of the restaurant
But something catches his eye on the side of his car
: a gasoline pump nozzle sitting in his gas tank with a foot of tattered hose ripped off at the end
He stares at it, trying to remember the last time he bought gas
He looks both ways and covertly pulls the nozzle from his tank
He walks towards the back door of the restaurant and throws the nozzle in an open dumpater

He passes a  in a black wearing eye make-up to make him look Asian

You've got thirty-four and twenty-five seated and Taylor booked a pilot so he quit
You picked a bad night to be late
Large glides through the chaotic environment unfazed by any of the stress
He rounds a corner to a time card machine and swipes his card
The machine  and displays the word, "" in red
He crosses to a locker and quickly changes into a black tunic and pants
He moves through the kitchen which is whirling with over thirty people in white: chopping, frying, sauteing,
The Vietnamese chef wears a headset and   down the line
Large is met by a
She walks with him as he weaves his way through the kitchen

They come in everyday from Idaho or Florida or Milwaukee and do you know what they want even more than a guest spot on "Everybody Loves Raymond"
They want your job

This will never happen again
You have two tables
You are thirty minutes late; if ever say this again, your job will : She pulls off the top resume from the bunch she's grasping; revealing a headshot on the other side
(') Todd Slauson from Duluth, Minnesota
During all this, Large remains calm and unphased
He takes a stick of eye make-up from the pocket of the tunic and paints his eyes to appear Asian
(As do all the white, good-looking, male waiters
) He takes a small radio transceiver device from the pocket of the tunic and turns it on
He unwinds the ear piece, pulls it through the back of his jacket, out the neck and into his ear
Immediately we hear a  '  giving orders over the ear piece

) (accented, but monotone) Waiter number fifteen, your table number twenty-three is ready
Large takes a deep breath and pushes open the door into: -- very fancy Hollywood Vietnamese restaurant filled to capacity with a Friday evening crowd
The energy is completely different from the other side of the door ' plays, the room is very dim and lit by candlelight
(
) ( ) Waiter ten, you forgot the order of forty-one for table one-o-one
All waiters, eighty-six tuna special
Large remains dead-pan as he crosses to a table with six young, hot Hollywood types
What the fuck, man
What are you on break
Large doesn't respond

Lemme get three Kettle Red Bulls arid

The song finishes and the rabbi begins a series of Hebrew prayers
Large squints through the mourners to see his father shovel a handful of dirt onto the casket
Behind him stands  , 25, a beautiful young Black woman
two young men seated on a rusty tractor smoking cigarettes about thirty yards behind the ceremony

Everyone but Sarah smiles widely into the lens

Large site on a couch in the den next to his Aunt Sylvia, the singer from the funeral
Some young children play on the rug in front of them
Large stares off into space as she pets one of the children's heads and looks to Large for conversation
Did you know your mother redid the hallway bathroom
Large looks over, realizing she's talking to him
What
Sorry

Since  met her she never showed an interest in anything

You're gonna love the material used the leftovers from your Mother's design
Gorgeous
-- Large flips the light on to reveal the entire bathroom is done in the same floral pattern; everything: wallpaper, towels, curtains
He looks down at the shirt; it's the same pattern
He slides his sweater off to reveal his pale, thin chest
He stares at himself in the mirror for a moment
He tilts his head to the right and stares at his body
He pulls the shirt on and buttons up the front
As he does his entire chest and person disappear into the design of the room
He looks at himself in the mirror; it looks like his head and forearms are floating in mid-air
Large almost smiles as he makes his forearms dance around in mid-air
'  -- sits alone at his desk
Large enters
Hi

That was him
Dug the hole myself

It pains Large to even try to respond to that

But  mean like, are you gonna travel or like what are you gonna do
Shouldn't you like help starving kids or something

It's kind of funny,  guess had kind of planned on my whole life being about struggling to get money
But now that 've got more than  ever dreamed, 'm really not sure what to do with myself stare at walls a lot
Can you believe that shit, Large
This guy has one idea and he's a trillionaire
got a thousand ideas, but  gotta sit around and wait for all my relatives to die
They join the group
Mark blows coke off a large golf book
Dave has a young girl on his lap
Large begins to notice that the girls in the room, although quite attractive, are pretty young; 17-19
As he pans the room, he lock eyes with a They play chicken briefly to see who will break the stare first
Large does and looks to his right where someone has just passed him a joint- He hits it and passes it on
Here, bro
He passes Large the golf book
Oh no thanks, man
Really
But you're like a movie star and shit
No, no thanks
Well then here
Eat this
Jesse opens his palm to reveal a tiny hit of  with a on it

He looks around at everyone else in the room eating them; including the cute girls
guess 'll see youguyslater
He eats the hit
They laugh
Should we play a game
other than golf
They laugh
No, let's play Spin The Bottle
The idea is met with mixed reaction from the group
( ) 'm not playing Spin The Bottle; how old are we
or more importantly, how old are they
Jesse passes Large the joint
They're all legal
think
He smiles a toothy grin
, a young hot girl with a raspy voice takes control
Well we just ate all this fuckin' ex, what the hell else are we gonna do
The girl has a point
Okay, how 'bout this
He holds up a bottle of Tequila with a ribbon around
to neck
('} First let's finish Daddy's golf tequila
Then we can use this bottle
The group loves this idea- As they laugh and party the CAIa to Large's face as he feels the weed and the beginning of his trip
His eyes and face navigate the ha3mnv start
26 , - The party seems to fast forward around Large; the until it breaks with people calling his name
Large
He snaps his attention to the game
The bottle is pointed directly at him
Largeman, this is Dana
Large looks over to the sexy young girl whom he locked eyes with before
She smiles at him
Awkwardness fills the room
Hi
(snapping out of it) Oh, who's up
They all laugh
She gets up and slowly walks over to the couch
She smiles nervously
Large stares at her
we see in his eyes he's feeling more fucked up every instant
She stands above him at the couch, then straddles him with her knees on either side of his legs; sitting on his lap
The
Everyone is speechless
she slowly leans in
Eye contact
They kiss softly enjoying every second
Its incredibly sexy
They stop and look at each other
She kisses him on the cheek and gets up
Everyone reacts and some clap
This is gonna be a good night
Everything - and
barrage of images: people hooking up, girls kissing girls, guys feeling girls up, joints being passed, one girl crying, Mark showing off his golf swing, Large trying to take deep breaths, Jesse and Dave hugging, two-figures moving quickly under a blanket
Kenny in full riot gear letting people take turns hitting him in his helmet
: hands gripping each other, a nose on a neck, hands gripping a waist
Ecu s Largos face as his eyes swim in their eocketo s end the corners of his mouth lift with the idea of a smile
27 The motion of the room is sped to a blur until finally: comes out of the darkness
Morning sun streams through a window revealing Large's face, full frame, eyes still closed
Across his forehead in thick black marker the word "" is written
His eyes open wide
He has no idea where he is
His eyeballs swing left, then right
As Large site up pulls back to reveal we are '   -- Large site on the sofa covered in an afghan
White morning sunlight pries past the beach towels covering the windows to highlight the duet in the air
in the kitchen pops Large' s eyes open
He has no idea where he is
Large's  into the kitchen reveals limited glimpses of a person walking around; like a hunter's amateur video of his Bigfoot sighting
He can only make out pieces: a sword, boots, then a cereal box
Then quickly the figure turns into perfect view: a medieval Knight in full regalia
They make eye contact for a second and Large slams his eyes shut
When he opens them again the knight is gone
-- Large and Mark sit with , mark's mother and  , 25
Carol is mid-forties and always looks like she's got a cold or has just been crying
Tim is dressed as a Medieval Knight
Large and mark stare at Tim as he  down his cereal
Carol smokes a thin cigarette
Mark is shirtless
No one addresses the fact that it says "Balls" in black marker On Large's forehead
Silence but for the  of  and ' it's good isn't it
No one responds, so Tim nods to be nice
(') i always try to save a couple of marshmallows for the very end, but can never make it
() 2B My mind wanders and 'm left with flakes and pink milk
And yet each time  pour a bowl  tell myself that this time, this is gonna be the time 'm gonna save at least one
So, Tim, how long you been working at medieval Times
Three years
But 've only been a knight for two
You have to pay your dues

When  started he was making the coleslaw
It hasn't been the same since you got knighted

Don't be modest
Mr

Congratulations
It's not that big a deal, it's fixed

() So what are those, like fake teeth you got now
He only chipped one tooth
So what are you up to now, Mark, digging graves
Silence
on a plate
Mark's getting into real estate
Silence
Mark  open his Zippo lighter and lights a cigarette
(') Tim can speak Klingon
What
No,  can't
Yes, you can
30 What the fuck is Klingon
Like the Star
Trek guys
Yup
He can talk in their language
She's kidding
No, 'm not
He's being shy
Are you being shy
Don't be shy, Tim
Yeah let's hear it, man
It's just made up
The guy who plays the wizard at work is a Trekky
don't really
He's being shy
Say what you said to me last night
No
Yeah, Tim
Say what you said to her last night
Silence
Everyone stares at Tim
gotta get going anyway
() Say what you said to her last night
Kuntar peteeky maya
Al fook soo
They all stare at him
Then burst out laughing
You've got to be kidding me
It means, " like to mate after battle
" 31 () That's not what  said
Yes
No, that wasn't the one  said
This one means "kill Kirk" and also 'hallelujah" depending on the context
You must have gotten it confused with "Pleej artulyah
Hagtooth pleep
" Theylaugh
That was good, honey
You know what that means, Tim
No  don't know the whole language, just
well  do
It means get the fuck out of my house before  chop your fuckin' head off
Silence
Large stares at Mark in disbelief, then starts to They all start to join him except Mark
They stop laughing
Mark, he's a knight
He's just a fast-food knight
should get going anyway
He gets up to leave
But his sword gets caught between his chair and the table
They all watch as he fumbles to undo himself
He's like John Ritter at his finest
Large and Mark just laugh
(') Thanks for the cereal
By the way, it says "balls" on your face
Carol follows Tim out
Large slides to the microwave door's reflection
32 : My Mom did it
: '   -- Mark and Large sit captivated by    on Large's forehead is now merely smeared with black ink
Mark leans forward to pull a bong hit from a blackened, colored tube
He coughs out his hit and reclines his bare back against the torn pleather couch
Carol enters and stands next to them watching the
What's this
She finds a long, thin cigarette with lipstick on it in the ashtray and lights it
What the fuck is that shit, Mom
Where's this
Gimme a hit of that
Don't bring those fucking people here anymore, Mom
Or 'm leaving
'm serious
No Medieval Times people in this house
He passes the bong to his Mom
She smokes it, then sits down, forcing them both to slide over
Several cats surround her_ (`) 'm declaring it
Now
It's declared, now
Thank you
No more
Did you tell Large about the tapes
No, Ma
'm not doin' the stupid tapes
what are the tapes
Real estate tapes
You can make up to a hundred thousand your first year
You should have seen the boat this one Oriental had
() 33 Be even had his own game show in China he made so much money think Mark would be perfect at it
Mom, shut-up about those fucking tapes
It's a scam
It's not a scam
They show you how to do it
It's not hard, honey
Then  could retire and we could have our own game show
Carol and Large share a laugh
In China
In China is right
So
what, you like sell property
It's bullshit
You were just all baked,out and you thought it would be a good idea
Well 'm doin' it
'm savin' up for those tapes
'Cause  know what you could be if you just applied yourself
do apply myself, Mom; everyday, work my ass off burying dead people, okay
'm only twenty-six, 'm not in any rush
What's your rush for
Just let me be, all right
don't rush you
Well then 'm gonna do them then
Fine
Do'em
will and then  won't let you come on my yacht
Large, you're welcome anytime, but leave your friend behind
Large
She checks her watch
34 (') Shit,  gotta go to my meeting
Okay
She stands up and then leans over and kisses Mark on the top of his head
(') Okay
Love you
Okay, bye Large good to see you
Yeah
Good to see you too
She gets to the door, then crosses back to Mark
Don't sit in here all day you guys; took the batteries outta that carbon monoxide detector 'cause it was beeping all night
She slams the front door
She drives me crazy
She's gets all fried out and makes me feel like gotta impress her all the fucking time
And you know what
'm okay with being unimpressive;  sleep better
Large site forward abruptly
Oh not What time is it
'   - Large rushes in to the counter
female Hispanic looks up
Hi, 'm Andrew bargeman
'm sorry
i'mn a little late for my appointment
She looks at her watch
( ) okay, Andrew
'm going to need you to fill out this paperwork for me, and we'll call you when we're ready for you
Okay, thanks
Sorry
35 He site back down and begins filling out the form- The door opens and a blind woman with a seeing eye-dog enters
The Receptionist sees her and calls out: Hi Mrs
Lubin
Oh, hello there
Just have a seat and we'll be with you soon
Thank you
She site
Large turns back to his paperwork
He fills out a line before he notices the "seeing-eye-dog" has wandered over to him
Large looks at him
(cold, disinterested) Hi, how are you
The dog looks both ways before mounting Large's leg and proceeds to thrust his groin to and fro
Large tries to shove him off
He looks back at the blind woman who stares off in the other direction
Large is about to say something to her but he stops himself
(') (under his breath) Get off
Off
The dog thrusts away
(') ( ) Stop it
Heel
No thrust
Finally Large gives up and decides to just let it hump away- He tries to return to his paperwork
Someone Large turns to see a cute 20 year old  he hadn't seen sitting in the corner
She wears really big headphones
(') Got any suggestions
Kick his balls
- Ready for me
36 The girl and Large look to each other, the receptionist is gone
( ) Not yet Mrs
Lubin
The dog humps away
The girl comes over and sits one seat away from Large
(') () Kick his balls
don't want to hurt him
It's the only way to teach them have three Dobermans
If  didn't kick them in the balls regularly 'd never get anything done
Yeah, but  don't want to like destroy future generations of charitable dogs
Besides he's got to be close to finishing by now
Not yet, here comes the lipstick
They sit and watch him go
(') Oh, he's gonna be sore tomorrow
: the whole waiting room
Everything still but the dog's thrusting pelvis
Mrs
Lubin
Yes
We're ready for you
Okay
'mon Arthur
Arthur immediately responds to her voice and returns to her side to lead her into the office
feel so used
37 She laughs
(CON2'') Thanks for your help
Or at least your good intentions
recognize you
Oh, did you go to Columbia High
No, not from high school, from
Didn't you play the retarded quarterback
(Wishing she'd go away) Yeah
Are you really retarded
He stares at her
No
That's cool
Great job, man
You were-  mean  thought you were really retarded
You were just as good as that corky kid and he's really retarded
mean if there's some kind of like retarded Emmy you could win
You'd kick Corky's ass
got to fill this thing out, but thank you for
that
Oh, okay
Right on
My cousin's an actor
Jake Ryan Winters
doubt you'd know him
He was on "Sheena" once as some gnome or something think that's great though
Thank you
Oh that last scene where you make that speech to the whole stadium and your Dad gives you the thumbs up; that was - it was emotional mean  didn't cry, but  think my Dad did
() 36 couldn't totally see, but he got up to go to the bathroom and think  heard him sniffle
Could've been dander
Well thanks
Thank you
So are you doing anything else
No
Not right now 'm just
Any other retarded roles
'm sure you could definitely get more of those
No, 'm just auditioning and
,
can't believe you're not really retarded
Jake's not a very good actor
mean on "Sheens" you couldn't really tell 'cause he was in a hairy gnome suit, but he used to put on these really low-budge renditions of Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals in our attic when we were kids and they were awful
It sucks 'cause there isn't a whole lotta work for little people, you know
Anyway sorry  talk too much, fill out your forms
Large just stares at her
She's funny
What are you listening to
"The Shins
" You know them
No
Oh are you kidding me
You gotta here this one song, it'll change your life  promise you
Oh but you have to fill out your forms
Conundrum
() Well do it while you listen to - She hands him her hugs earphones
The Shins' "flew slang" is playing
39 He looks at Sam and she just Stares at him and nods smiling
After a moment, he takes the phones off and hands them back to her
The    from the headphones
That's cool
like it
So what are you doing here
What are you doing here
Waiting for a friend
You
'm uh
there's a_
Fuck, that was nosey, 'm sorry didn't mean to be nosey
That was so nosey
Its al=ight
uh get headaches
So  just wanna have that checked out
Cool
Andrew Largeman
Yes
We're ready for you
Okay
He stands
He turns to Sam
(' '  ) It was nice meeting you
You didn't
'm Sam
Andrew
() Cool
well, bye
Good luck with your head
40 Thanks
Don't worry Sam, we'll get to you next
Large turns to Sam
She looks away
'  - Large site alone in a barren office
He pans around the room staring at all the diplomas
His eyes follow them up from the base-board all the way up to the ceiling to reveal: there's actually one on the ceiling
The doctor enters
Mr
Andrew Largeman
Yes - hi
There's absolutely nothing wrong with you
Large stares
What
'm just kidding, how would  know that
Yeah
They shape hands
'm Doctor Cohen
What can we do for you today, Andrew
've been having these really intense headaches
They only last for a split second and then they're gone
It's like a lightning flash; almost like a surge of electricity and then it's gone
He looks at the chart
You're Gideon's kid
didn't even put the two together
41 Yeah
'm sorry about you're Mother
Yeah
Thank you
must have missed you at Shiva last night
Yeah
So how long have these headaches been going on
Well  think 've had them in some form since  was a little kid
But they've been getting more and more frequent over the last year
(looking at chart) How long have you been on the Lithium
Oh uh, 've been on some form of it since  was ten or so
And what about Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, Depakote; did any of that ever help you
No
mean  don't know
It's recently occurred to me that might not even have a problem
only 'd never know it, because as far back as  can remember 've been medicated
grew up on it
left them in
This is the first time haven't had it in my body since can remember
Well it'll leave your body pretty fast
'll write you a prescription
Actually
was thinking about taking a little vacation
42 Have you spoken to your psychiatrist about that
)h well, my psychiatrist is my Dad
So uh
he
think he'd prefer me to stay on it
He likes to think it makes me happy
And  let him think that because he's sort of consumed by the idea of making everyone happy
Well look, 'll examine you and give you a Catscan just so you won't worry that it's anything serious
But to be honest,  think the headaches are something else
Our bodies do very funny things when they're consumed with stress and anxiety
Things you'd never expect
found my ex-best friend's cuff links in my wife's puree and couldn't get an erection for a year and a half
() For example
But that doesn't really feel like it
mean  don't feel stressed or really anxious at all
Well with all the Lithium he's had you on it's amazing you can even hear me right now_ Oh, right
First of all,  do think you need to find a psychiatrist that isn't your father
That just's something that should have been remedied years ago
He knows better
Secondly, 'm not in a position to comment on whether or not you should stay on the meds or not; don't know your story
But my opinion, since you're paying for it, is that those drugs may help as a means to an end
But if you're not In any sort of therapy, sooner or later what's ever going on in your mind will find a way to peek it's little head out of the water
Just something to think about
() 43 ,beat) But, for now, let's have a look at you
: - : Large staring at the wall as he lies on a white slab covered from the waist down by a white towel
straps him to the slab ignoring the and  in black marker that cover his chest
to reveal Large and the slab being sucked
into the Catscan tunnel
-- Large drives out of the parking lot
There, seated at the bus stop is Sam bobbing her head to music- She wears a backpack and holds an odd looking helmet in her hand
He pulls up alongside her
Why were you really there
Charging
'm a robot
Do you lie a lot
What do you consider a lot
Enough for people to call you a liar
People call me lots of things
Is one of them "liar"
could say "no", but how will you know 'm not lying
Because `ll choose to trust
You can do that
99 can try
Who's bike is this
It was my grandfather's
It was the only thing he left to anyone in my family and he left it to me
And like it
This is the point where you ask me if 'd like a ride home
It is
Yup
Would you like a ride home
Fine, but  ' m not getting in that sidecar, Why not
Sidecars are for bitches
Anyone who gets in that thing is automatically your bitch
Thus, will ride on the back
She climbs on the back behind him
(re: the helmet) What are you like
a hanglider
They drive off
/--- thought my boyfriend was gonna pick me up on his bike, so brought it
But then he couldn't so
So what, it's like one of those tandem things
45 No, its a Ninja
Way faster than this thing
But what kind of helmet is that
You can use it on a motorcycle
Anyway, how's your head
should live through the day
Cool
Make a right here
They stop at a light
Are you doing anything right now
Can you elaborate on "doing anything"
Well,  just had this idea promised this guy 'd stop by his house that's right up here, but don't really wanna stay very long
So  was just thinking if you came with me  could say  have to take you home when 'm ready to go
Wow
well that's pretty damn random of ya, Andrew
know
'Nice to meet you
May  use you
' That's the Hollywood in ya  guess
No, it's not like that, c'mon
It'll be fun
promise
() 'll tell you what
We'll have like a signal
When you pull on your ear that's the code and then 'll say,, "Well 've got to get her home now
" And then we'll go
She mulls it over
4A Can we have code names too
If you'd like
okay
But don't try and like kidnap me or anything, because my step-uncle's a bounty hunter and could have you tracked and killed
Liar
The light changes and they drive off
' '   - The poorly maintained backyard of a mansion: pools, fountains
Jesse stands shirtless and unshaven holding an enormous bow and arrow aimed at the sky
The end of the arrow is on fire
joint hangs from his lips
Sam and Large look terrified
'Kay ready
He unleashes the arrow into the air and the three of them scramble around in terror trying to avoid wherever it will land
It plunges into the earth three feet from Sam's foot
Frozen, she yanks on her ear; hard
: '  -- Sam and Large stand on the front porch of her working class house
'll be fine
Am  the first boy you've ever brought home
() No
But  lied about my boyfriend driving a t
inja
He doesn't drive a bike
No,  don't have a boyfriend
() He might drive a bike; wherever he is
47 Well we're off to a great start
okay so sometimes  lie
'm weird, man
About random stuff too; and don't even know why  do it
It's like a tick
swear, sometimes hear myself say something and then think: "Wow, that's not even remotely true
So how am  supposed to know what's real
Well,  always feel bad and admit them when they're lies
() Can you trust that
Open the door
' :  -- She pushes the front door open and immediately three enormous Doberman Pinchers  and  all over Large
Down, Kevin
Mom
Kick their balls
Kick their balls
Anthrax, heel
Mom
Sam tries slapping them on their backs
, Sam's mother, comes rushing in clutching a hamster with a bloody nose
Everybody downl Who wants to eat
Do you want to eat
Well then get the fuck off him
Kevin
Steven
[ She smacks their asses and they eventually retreat to the other room
(' ) 'm so sorry, we just don't have the time to train' em
Who has time to train'em
When they were puppies it was cute, but now it's like having a herd of Clydesdales
It's just too much
() 48 Kevin's the baby, he really just follows the others but last week Anthrax and Steven killed a dove and left him on the front porch
Or maybe it was a pigeon, he was grey
'Member that, Samantha
Mom, this is
Andrew
Welcome, welcome
The place is a wreck, 'm so sorry
You look very familiar
He's the retarded quarterback
Shut up
Oh my God
You are the retarded quarterback
You were so good on that show
Now 'm really ashamed
Look at this place
And 'm wearing sweat pants
(to Sam, through her teeth, while nodding at ) is he really retarded
No
Oh, tell me, what's that Alan Thicke like
've heard he's a cocky son of a bitch
No, he's a really nice guy
Oh
Well, welcome, welcome
Samantha  told you to take the wheel out of the hamster cage
She holds up a dead hamster
forgot, Mom
Well you forgot and now Jelly's dead
Luckily  got peanut Butter out in time
( ) We have to get the only hamster on planet Earth that can't figure out a stupid hamster wheel
Now the rest of 'am can't even get a good sweat going
() 49 There's a shoe box on the kitchen counter
You can do the honors have to run to work
She sighs and absentmindedly pate her forehead with the hamster
(') It was so nice to meet you
Andrew right
Yes
Samantha put the clothes in the dryer and bury Jelly
She kisses Sam on the cheek and then she's gone
They stand there a moment to catch their breath
Then they both start laughing
Come on in
They walk into the
-- Big couches with tattered afghans on them
Christmas tree with the lights on in the far corner; a few unwrapped presents underneath
An enormous hamster labyrinth, a fish tank, three cats, a bird cage
So this is it
It's nice
No it's not
You don't have to say that just 'cause you can't think of anything else to say
'm not
It's really nice
It's very cozy
You guys are a little early on the tree, huh
Yeah, well we never got around to taking it down, so when it got to be fall again we just figured we might as well leave it
Are you freaked out
You're totally freaked out aren't you
50 No, not at all
like it
Wanna see my room
Yeah, sure
They cross to the staircase and are met by  (Ti-- bay) a handsome, young Black Man in a sweater carrying books
Titembay, this is my friend, Andrew
Andrew this is my brother, Titembay
Hi, nice to meet you
( ) Nice to meet you
'm sorry about Jelly
Oh, its okay
saved some mac and cheese for you
It's in the f ridge
Thanks
Anyway, 'm late for class, it was nice meeting you
Yeah, you too
They walk up the stairs
'  -- We watch the locks turn as Sam uses a key from the outside
Music posters everywhere
Warm, cozy
This is it
She puts on a , (the song: "'m Doing Fine" by Colin Hay)
(') Nothing fancy, but
( ) What
51 Uhh
It's Titembay right
Yeah, it's weird, huh
You're so freaked out right now, you're like running for the door
You can go, don't feel bad
Stop doing that
What
That whole thing you just did
Don't do that
want to be here, and  wouldn't be here if  didn't want to be, okay
Trust me, my family's way more fucked up then yours, okay
() Okay
Yeah
So, Titembay
Yeah, he's my brother
Is he adopted
Well kind of
My mom adopted him years ago from Sally Strothers
one of those: For the cost of a cup of coffee a day" kind of things
where she's like, "How can you sit there and not help the children
" And we just couldn't
We couldn't sit there and not help those children
So we sent him letters and pictures for years and then got really into ice skating and we kind of forgot about'em
Then one day the phone rang and it was Titembay and he was at the dry cleaners around the corner and he said that he was going to school at Rutgers and living in the dorms, but since he was used to living with his tribe he'd much rather live with his family
52 Wow
Yeah and he's been here ever since
He's an amazing guy, you gotta hear some of his stories
mean this guy struggled through so much because he wanted to learn
think of what he's accomplished and just feel so lazy
He's studying criminal justice at Rutgers right now and when he was a baby he was one of those kids with flies all over his face
Wow
mean that's great
It's a crazy story
That, my friend, is a true story
'm not that good- pause
Sam sits on the bed
She breaks the moment by pulling a small tattered piece of satin fabric off the bed
(CO13T') This is Tickle
Large sits down next to her
What is Tickle
Tickle is my favorite thing in the whole world
It's all that's left of Nannie
my blanket
And Tickle is all that remains
Yeah
Was there a hurricane or something
() Shut-up
No,  mean  had it since was born
it was the blanket they brought me home in from the hospital
It's like the Wailing Wall
53 What
The Wailing Wall
It's like the most holy place for Jews to go and pray in Israel
It's all that's left of this enormous temple that was destroyed by the Romans
Wow, so you're like really Jewish
Large laughs
(') Yeah, you are aren't you
No 'm not
mean 'm Jewish, but 'm not really Jewish
don't do anything Jewish
don't go to temple or anything
But  don't know any Jews who go to temple
The Jews  know only go on Yom Kippur
One day; the day of repentance
Did you know that most temples are designed with movable walls so that on the one day of the year when a everyone comes to repent they can actually make the room big enough to hold everyone
don't really believe in God
Just tickle
Oh,  believe in Tickle_ They laugh
nice moment
They hold eye contact (') We're not gonna like make out or anything
What
'm sorry,  just totally ruined the moment didn't
No,  wasn't
54 just mean we're not gonna like make out
Okay
hadn't planned on
didn't mean to put that out there, that was lame
That was so dumb
You know what do when 'm feeling completely unoriginal
She stands up and does really weird gestures with her hands
(') --- Large states
( ' ) make a noise or  do something that no one has ever done
And then feel like
unique again; even if only for a second
So no one has ever done that
Not in this spot, no
You just witnessed a completely original moment in history
It's refreshing
You try one
No
Come on
No
Trust me yours was good enough for both of us
Come on
What are you shy
This is your chance to do something that has never, ever been done before and will never be copied throughout human existence
If nothing else, you'll be remembered as the only person who ever did this
He stares at her
She's not gonna let up
Large lifts his index finger in the air and twirlsa it
55 ZzzZzz
Be stares at her
(') How was that
Oh, 've done that one before
She bursts out laughing
He smiles
( ' t3 ) So  got to bury this hamster before the dogs eat him
You warms help
'' : -- Rusty leaves fall on a backyard swallowed mostly by an empty above-ground swimming pool
Sam carries the shoe box as they walk around behind the pool to reveal About a dozen large rocks serve as tombstones for different pets
Wow
Yeah
mean this is
know
They stand in silence
(') It's not that we're bad pet owners or anything, it's just that we've had so many of them over the years
() Besides some of these are fish
() Not to say fish deserve less than other animals, but moat people just flush them, and we just don't believe in that
mean the idea of flushing something that had life in it
it just makes me sad, you know
() 56 You gotta honor something a little more than that, like "Congratulations, man, you had life
Here's your trophy; a little spot in the ground to hang out in
" () Anyway, 'm gonna put Jelly right here next to "Goliath", the Rotweiler Titembay backed over during his driving exam
She kneels down and begins to dig with a small shovel left nearby
Large sits down next to her and watches her dig brisk wind makes him hug his knees in for warmth
(') What are you thinking about
Now
Yes
Right now
No
second ago before  asked
Uh
Right now  was thinking was thinking that 've been going to a lot of these things lately
What, dates
No, not dates
This isn't a date
Is this a date
Funerals
Oh
Who else died
() Uh
that's why 'm home actually
() Yeah,  uh
haven't even really told you that yet, but uh
yeah my Mom just died
Sam stops digging and stares at him
(') God, it's weird to say that out loud: 'My Mom died"
And uh
eo that's why 'm home
now
57 () 'm so sorry
Oh, God 'm so sorry
() And here  am putting you through another one
mean not that Jelly's even comes close to your Mom's
Although we loved, Jelly-- But still
'm so sorry
didn't know
No, it's okay
It's okay actually
'm all right with it
Anyway think it's what she wanted so
, How did she die
Large thinks about that
( ' ) 'm sorry, 'm so nosey
Forget asked, 'm sorry
just need to shut--up sometimes
No, its okay
She uh
she drowned actually
Sam's jaw drops
(') My Mom was a paraplegic; she had uh
she was in a wheelchair
She was uh
taking a bath and then guess she slipped or something
That's what they say
don't know
But needless to say, she drowned
And so
that's how she died
Sam is speechless
Tears well in her eyes
When
This was uh
Hmm
Sunday
Oh my God
Tears roll down her face
(with a laugh) Why are you crying
58 don't know, 'm sorry, 'm not usually like this
It's just so sad
It's so tragic
Isn't it
It is
It's like real life tragedy or something
Look, let's change the subject, okay
Let's really bring the focus back to Jelly
mean what could be ruder than talking about someone else who died while you're in the act of burying a close friend
Sam places the box in the hole she's dug
What should we do
Well IIve only been to one of these things, (re: the other graves) you appear to be the expert
We usually say something
okay, well 'll go first
didn't really know you, Jelly
But from what  hear, you were a good pet
Had a little trouble with the wheel
its not funny
Jelly you were a great pet
Tears roll down her face
(') 'm so, so sorry  forgot to take the wheel out of the cage
'm so sorry about that
() Goodbye
hope that you liked me
Tears stream down her face as she shovels dirt onto the tiny shoe box

was just thinking- () was just thinking you spend you're whole life lusting for anything you don't have
You stress over money and your career, you set your clocks back, you exercise, you wait in line, you paint your house, get depressed, feel better, buy things, take your clothes to the dry cleaner, set your clocks forward and spend your whole life waiting for happiness to arrive in the mail
Then you die and people are really sad, they cry really hard
() and then they go eat lunch
Hetakes a bite of his bagel
Oh please be a little more interesting than that
() 60 Please don't be the brooding guy
That's so unoriginal
'd rather hold onto who  imagined you'd become
Miss me
No
Me
No
() She didn't like being alive
She got what she wanted
This should be a party
Instead we're supposed to mope
About what
She never did anything
She made you
some trophy
do have to say 'm impressed with the turnout
What, you didn't think people would come
Seems to me the only thing more depressing than a funeral is a funeral where no one shows up
Don't you ever think about who'll show up to yours
No
Right now 'm alive, so  think about living
It's one way to determine who your friends are
The people who'd show up at my funeral if it was held in their state, that's one level of friend
But my real friends, the people who really love me, they'd come if it was on the other side of the country
So where do  fall into that
You'd be there
Oh you think so
61 do
think you'd show up because the truth is, that you really did miss met you always thought of me as the brother you never had
But you've got too much pride to let me know that
You want to pout 'cause don't return your calls
you're way more talkative than remember
Today 've been more talkative than remember
What about mine
Funeral
Honestly
probably wouldn't travel for it- no
But don't worry, 'm sure you'll have a great turnout
Why do you say that
'Cause there's also the guy who lives his life to insure a good turnout
think that's how my Dad lives his-, like he's sort of writing his own eulogy as he goes and making life choices dependent on how it will sound in a speech
Are you implying that that's why 'm going to med school or something
'm just saying a lot of people - not necessarily you - a lot of people try and accumulate accolades that will somehow justify their lives
It's said we spend ninety-five percent of our lives trying to look good
Where do  sign up for not caring
62 How about sucking it up and really having it out with your Dad
That would be a tremendous step towards not needing to look good
Wow, that was so clever how you did that
Is he grooming you to be a psychiatrist too
Med school's one thing, but please don't become him
He's one of the most caring people 've ever met
well you would say that; you're the son and daughter he never had
Hell, you're the family he never had
Has he got you on Lithium yet
Wait till he does, you'll love him even more
He stands
bet my Mom a dollar you were coming home with a message
said after nine years, he's definitely coming home with a message
i looked for a message;  got bored and became an actor
He leaves
-- Large enters the kitchen where , 50's, Cynthia's Mom, is doing the dishes
He walks over to the counter near the sink and just stares off across the room
She dries her hands and moves to Large
She opens her arms
After a beat he steps into her embrace
He rests his head on her shoulder and closes his eyes
Neither says a word
: '  -- Morning sun blasts the entire room
Large site on the edge of his bed squinting at pictures: -- Large peeks his head around the doorway
63 Hello
() Dad
After shutting the door behind himself he' crosses to the dresser and lifts one perfume bottle out from a dozen
He smells the nozzle then brings the bottle with him as he edges towards
--- The bathroom is stark white
large Jacuzzi tub sits at the far end of the room
The faucet drips
as it wells with water and overflows to  onto the drain
Large crosses to the tub and tries to tighten the faucet to stop it from dripping
It continues to
He stares at the empty tub
(
) Hi
Large jumps around and puts his hand to his chest
Holy shit, you scared the shit out of me
He covertly slips the perfume bottle into his pocket
Just wake up
Yeah
Sleep all right
Yeah
fine
Mmmm
() haven't even really been in here for a while
've been using the one in the hall
Shower pressures awful in there though
It's by no means as good a bathroom as this one is
This one is- well we redid all this
Its uh
(beat, catching himself) This is hard
64 Yeah
Silence
The
They avoid eye contact
Janice will make you some lunch
Yeah
good
Well  guess it's breakfast for you
What time is it
Yeah
Silence (') Look,  wanted to ask you
mean if you don't want to talk about this its perfectly fine, but 'm just
No  can
know
figured you would want to
But we don't have to do it now mean you don't have to do that now
It's just at some point  would
have some questions
knew that you would
Silence
(') Occasionally she would hum
, your Mother
Always the same tune and never knew what the song was don't even know if it was a song or if she just made it up - It's funny because it always struck me as so out of character for her and every time she did it
just always liked it
But  never told her could hear her because  knew if ever did she would stop
() She took a bath every night
And she was always very quiet
() 65 The only thing  would ever hear when 'm in the bedroom was a little splashing of water when she was moving around
And every now and then, her humming
() so anyway, then usually she would call me when she was done, so could come and help her out
But this time, that night
she never called
And  just figured she was taking a longer bath or something, but when  called out to her, she didn't answer
So then  uh
When came in, she was there
So she didn't yell or
No
didn't hear anything
The was on pretty loud
always watch the weather report before  go to sleep
It's just weird
What
don't know, it's just that you'd think if someone was really drowning to death they would scream
mean really scream from the terror of it all, you know
They would splash and scream would think;  would have thought
would have too, but no
Nothing
(off Large's look) What
Don't take this the wrong way
What
'm not reading into this, 'm just thinking out loud so don't get - What
No
What
66 Its not that
'm just saying did they check mean has someone ruled that out
No
Because they know she drowned, Andrew
'm just saying the facts
No
And  suppose it doesn't even really matter
But 'd be curious to know
would like to know if that's what happened; just for me
mean would that surprise you
No
Yee
She made it very clear to everyone she knew that nothing was ever going to make her happy- know
Do you think  don't know
And c'mon let's be honest; she tried it before
Shut-up
lust shut your fucking mouth
Large is taken aback
(') ( ) If nothing else will you please just leave, her alone
She's gone
That's it
That's all you get
She died
We will never see her again
She tried very hard, but she just couldn't find it
She could never find it
And  think -  know that she's found it now
know that
And  know there's a certain amount of guilt that you must feel for the way things unfolded, but it's too late now
() 67 So 'm asking you, for me, not to do that
Don't
come here and do that
think  deserve to know the truth
You want to make her crazy
Why
Does that make it easier for you
Tears stream down Gideon's face, He sits down on the toilet and cries
(') It's like you want to torture yourself or something
Why would you want to think that
That that happened
Why would you ever want to think that
Large moves closer to his father who  with his head in his lap and his arms over his head
It takes everything Large has to reach out his hand and almost touch his father's shoulder, but he doesn't make it and his hand lands on the sink next to him
(') just want everyone to be happy again
() dreamt last night that  had special powers
If  squeezed my eyes shut and clinched my fiats closed tight enough, we'd all wake up in paradise

and that was my power

How could you leave all that Lithium
was totally gonna hit you up for some
This fuckin' guy
'm glad you're back, man, because this town is so messed up
Everyone's got there drug of choice like in "Brave New World"

Olivia enters with an enormous Parrot on her shoulder
Andrew would you like to see Sam's ice skating tape
Mom, no
Absolutely
She was so ahead of her time
She could have gone to the Olympics
No,  couldn't have
Yes, you could have
Don't blame it on the epilepsy, you had a gift
Large looks to Sam, but she avoids eye contact with him- 'mon let me see it
69 Let's just show him the "Florida Stars of the Ice" opening; the Gator costume
Mom
'm asking you seriously
Don't be shy
Just let me see it
Oh, she wants you to see it
How could you not want him to see how talented you are

They cross to the  room where they find Titembay wearing rubber gloves, seated next to an open tool box, dusting the coffee table for fingerprints and referring to an open text book
White powder reveals fingerprints (and pawprints) everywhere, including the  screen
Honey what are you doing
'm dusting for prints
Well do you think we could move the crime scene to the kitchen
want to show Andrew Sam skating
But someone's been pissing on my Gamecube and 'm about to close the case
It wasn't me your honor
The pawprints point to a canine
Andrew come sit down here next to me
Large sits next to Olivia on the couch between snoring Dobermans
He places his glass of water on the table
Sam stands in the doorway
can't believe you're showing him this
70 ,   comes up on the screen: a person in a full alligator costume wearing white gloves skates onto the ice
The lights come down except for a spotlight on the alligator
There she is
You're the alligator
You can tell by the hands
The alligator skates in and out of the white fingerprints on the  screen to classical music
We begin to see that Sam is a talented skater
In a very odd way, it's beautiful
Here comes the Double Axle

Isn't she good
Large, Titembay and Olivia
As they do, the  in the room   and
Titembay  twice to turn them back on

They're buzzed
It was the only thing  ever really liked doing; pretending to be someone else
() But 've been so out of it the only parts  ever get offered are to play handicapped people
72 She tries to hold it together, but she bursts out laughing
(') It's not funny
Oh c'mon
Don't ya see that it's a joke
If you can't laugh at yourself life's gonna seem a lot longer than you'd like
So what should we laugh at you about
lied again
have epilepsy
Which part are we laughing about
had a seizure in the law office where  work and they said their insurance would only cover me if wore "preventative covering"
Preventative covering
The helmet  was carrying
Large is silent
(' ) Oh come on, that's funny
'm the only person in the world wearing a helmet to work who isn't putting out fires or racing for
But what do you do
can't quit; their insurance is amazing
What can you do
You laugh
'm not saying don't cry a lot, but in between laugh and realize how silly taking anything very seriously is
And plus,  look forward to a good cry
just love the way it feels
haven't cried since  was a little kid
didn't cry at my mother's funeral
wanted to- ( ) tried
thought of all the saddest things  could think of; things in movies, this image from Life magazine that haunts me
nothing came
() 73 That actually made me sadder than anything; the fact that  felt no numb
What do you mean
(
) Vagina
Oh, no
Mark, Dave and Jesse appear with some others
"(') Hey, guys, this is Sam
This is Mark, Dave and you met Jesse
Hey
Nice to meet you

The Manhattan skyline twinkles far in the distance
Large, Sam, Mark, Dave, Jesse and a couple of high school girls from the bar stand in their underwear on the edge of the pool
One, two, three
Everyone jumps into the pool  except for Large
He stands there staring at the water
Hey
what are you doing
74 Largeman, get the fuck in the pool
oh, it's so warm
Can you swim
'Course  can swim
Large in the shallow-end doing the most pathetic doggy paddle you've ever seen
Everyone stares in disbelief
Dude maybe you should stay on the steps;  don't know
You look like a drunken beaver
They all laugh- Sam swims over to him sitting on the steps
She smiles at him
(in a whisper) never learned how to swim
Fooled me
thought you just had a cramp
() Or two
He smiles
(') (in a whisper) can't whistle if it makes you feel any better
There's a handful of normal kid things  kinda missed
There's a handful of normal kid things  kinda wish 'd missed
She floats on her back beside him
(') So how long are you gonna stay here
Probably till my fingers get wrinkly
75 (with a laugh) No,  mean in Jersey
Oh
think 'll probably head home the day after tomorrow
well,
That's not my home
Rer smile fades
(') You know that point in your life when you realize that the home you grew up in isn't really your home anymore
And all of a sudden, even though you have a place where you put your Shit, the idea of "home', is gone
still feel at home in my house
You'll gee when you move out
It just kind of happens one day and it's gone
And you feel like you can never get it back
it's like you feel homesick for a place that doesn't even exist
But maybe it's like this rite of passage, you know
And you won't ever have that feeling again until you create a new idea of "home" for yourself, for the family you start, for your kids
It's like this cycle
() Maybe that's all a family really is; a group of people who miss the same imaginary place

They are all pretty tipsy
Mark plays with a "Silent Velcro" sample
How 'bout some fucking furniture dude
76 bought a chair but  didn't like it
Where is it
Its keeping us warm
Silent Velcro
Lucky motherfucker
got an idea: loud tape, we'll make millions
feel like if  had showed up at school and presented the idea of silent Velcro they would have sent me away a whole lot sooner
They all laugh
So why did they send you away
She takes a sip of her beer
Whoa, listen to this girl
They didn't send me away
You're the one who said they sent you away
mean they did, but
they sent me to boarding school
"Sent me away" implies  went to some asylum or something
There were no straps involved
Why did they send you to boarding school
Large looks to Jesse and Mark
They sent me to boarding school because uh
they thought  might be dangerous
( ) Oh are you freaked out
You're so freaked out right now
77 () That's funny
() Why did they think you might be dangerous
'm dangerous and  didn't get to go to boarding school
was a kid and  was - they just
was a teenager and they were depressed and it just wasn't a good combo
But obviously something happened mean there must have been an event
You're like a little detective
know
You and Titembay should go into business together; solve mysteries out of a van
Am  being too nosey
No
No
just
it's fine
just haven't ever really talked about it
To be honest,  never really knew either
mean  heard stories
You wanna know
Yeah
Really, really
You're gay
No
Drumroll
was the reason she was in a wheelchair
() pushed her
() 78 () So there that is
Shut up
Fuck you
No, it's the truth
Why
It was a complete freak accident mean its one of those things that you replay a million times in your head and you see so clearly what a freak thing it was
Say whole life she was depressed for no reason
Look at this picture
He pulls the picture of he and Cynthia as children wearing chicken slippers out of his wallet
(') Look at her face
That's how, she
was every single day of her life
And one day
was nine years old and  just really hated, her for that, and  pushed her
() mean it was innocent
was just frustrated 'cause
You couldn't make her happy
Yeah
Fuck yeah
And any other time, she would have just yelled at me and sent me to my room, but this time, in that moment, the door of the dishwasher was open
The latch on it was broken and it would just randomly fall open
That fucking latch; it's funny how so much of my life hasbeendetermined by a quarterinchpiece of plastic
So she fellbackover the door and her neck hitthekitchen counter; paralyzing her from the waist down
Sam's eyes are wide in shock
Oh my God
79 Still want to compare fucked up families
But your Mom was in the wheelchair long before you left
Well  was nine
They sent me to therapy and my Father put me on these drugs that were supposed to "curb my anger"
And 've been on some form of them ever since
My Mother who was clinically depressed before the accident, sank even lower to the point where she just ignored everyone but our housekeeper, Janice and her daughter, Cynthia
And when  was sixteen my psychiatrist Dad came around to the conclusion that it might not be the healthiest environment for me to be growing up in
So he sent me to boarding school
And  haven't been home since
Until now
For her funeral
Until now for her funeral
'm off to a ripping start in this life, huh
Next time through  think 'll lay low out of the gate
He takes a sip of his beer
( ' ) The thing is though, when  think about it,  wasn't really abnormally angry at all
mean it all happened so quickly;  got prescribed all these drugs for anxiety and depression and anger so just kind of became what they are
It sounds like a punishment
think it was
So  left them in 'm taking myself off punishment
80 Please don't remind me
All he heard of that whole story was "left drugs in "
Fuck you

Where's the sauna
Mark and Jesse look at each other
They race towards her tripping drunkenly on towels and pushing each other out of the way
Sam smiles at Large
Her face glowswarm from the fire
What
You're "in it" right now aren't you
what do you mean
My Mom always says that when she can see 'm like working something big out she'll say, "Are you in it right now
" And  look at you, and you tell me this story and
you're
you're definitely "in it" right now
think you're right
'm "in it"
But 'm so glad 'm "in it" 'cause 'm working it all out, you know
haven't swallowed a pill in four days now and  can already feel this eerie clarity
It's probably the reason  just can't stop fucking talking; these
rusty cogs in my brain have started spinning
fast
Maybe that's why you've been getting those headaches
81 Alright can we just forget about all that stuff please and talk about good etuff
Good stuff
Yeah, glass half-full shit
What do you got
got a little buzz
That's what 've got
What do you got
got a little buzz going

No, but in the commercial they say that if  wanted to cut cans could
But with these knives can't

He backs away
You know me enough to know 'd travel for your funeral right was kidding yesterday; where ever it was

Yes
He backs away and mounts his bike
Cynthia turns to the stretcher and quickly uses her thumb to swipe a tear,welling in her eye
/ 22 --- Mark, Sam and Large enter the tacky lobby
Mark carries the gym bag
Large and Sam follow Mark down a corridor and into a vending machine room
He opens a door labeled "Private" into a kitchen area
They weave through the kitchen down another hall
-- They arrive at a locked door
Mark knocks
After a beat it's opened by an Asian teenager with bad acne blasting his walkman
The far wall is entirely covered with a blown-up mural of a New Jersey Driver's License used for making fake 's
The space where the face would go is missing, revealing an opening in the wall
They climb through
-- , '
' They squeeze down a long dark corridor filled with graffiti
They come upon a young teen staring through a peep hole in the wall
Mark taps him on the shoulder
He turns his head and nods in recognition
When he pulls away from the peep hole, the 94 (Yes, that really happens
) As he looks at Mark, Sam and Large, his forehead is filled with the image of a brushing his teeth
Mark leans into his ear
() Where's Diego
() Down the hall
There's a hooker in room 112
It's crazy down there figured 'd just chill with this
: Mark gestures for Large and Sam to follow him down the hall
The hall is strewn with young men staring into peep holes
As Mark, Sam and Large pass them, the Peeping Tom's each turn to see who it is
As they turn, each one has the image of what they're watching projected on their face
We hear the  of the the
-- An old couple slow dancing projected on another teen
: They arrive at the end of the hall where a group of six young guys are glued to the image being projected onto the wall opposite the peep hole
An old camera lens has been ducked taped to the peep hole causing the image to appear in perfect focus
The projection shows a very hot,   getting taken from behind by an
Her face is no more than three feet from the peep hole
The ' can be heard from the other side of the wall
Everyone's eyes are glued to the wall
Large notices one kid has duct tape over his mouth, while another is sweating profusely
Sam's jaw is dropped open

) 'm fucking you
'm fucking you
Large notices another kid lip-synching along with the Greaseball
Mark spots , a Hispanic guy, 32, wearing a bell-hop uniform and gestures him closer
() 'sup dog
She's fuckin' hot
() This is the most exciting day of my life
We've never had anything close to this

The Lip-Synching Kid mouths, "You are
" Dude we're kind of in a rush
You can wait, he's about to cunt
'm gonna fucking cum
Diegogestures, "Told you
" Cum on my back
The group responds in silent shock
Jaws drop, Diego grabs his hair with his fists
Just as they are about to climax, we : --- Mark, Diego, Large, Sam and others rush out into the outer room
They speak in quiet whispers
SHIT3 Wow
That shit was hot
got to go drop some knowledge on that ho
How do you know she's a hooker
of course she's a fucking hooker
Girls that look like her do not fuck guys that look like him unless it's for money, coke or fame
Julia Roberts married Lyle Lovett
Who the fuck are you
96 Oh, this is Sam and Large
No offense
( ) Why are you bringing these people here
He's the guy who needs that thing
Look  brought you the tank, so can you just tell us where to go now
Tank come with balloons
Am  a fucking birthday clown, Diego
No  don't have balloons
Suck it off the tap
And  need it back when you're done; the guy's holding my thirty-nine bucks
All right
Hold-up
Who here just saw some titties
They all stare
(') Raise your hand if you just saw some titties
They all raise their hands
(Including Sam
) (') Thank you
So everybody needs to calm the fuck down
we're in a hurry
All right
You know where Kiernan's Quarry is
'  -- They pull up on the motorcycle
(
) Down in Newark, right
(
0
) Yeah, its at the bottom of Hillside and Rivington
() 97 You can't really see it from the street, but it's there
Park your car at the gate and hop the fence
They do
(
) (') At the bottom of the quarry there's this Junkyard run by this guy named Albert
lie's the one that tracked down the piece you're looking for
'll call him right now and tell him to expect you
Okay, stop
What the fuck are we doing
Just be patient
Dude, we've been patient all day, but it's my last day in town and you haven't told me what the fuck we're doing
mean if you told me we were going on a six hour scavenger hunt for blow  would have passed
Blow
Please
If  was gonna give you coke we'd have gone to the high school football practice and we'd a been reeling five hours ago
Well  think we've corrupted this innocent girl enough for one afternoon
'm not innocent
(getting worked up) Yes, you are
And that's what like about you
And  don't want this fucking guy taking you to the bottom of a quarry in a sketchy-ass neighborhood to find some Pitbull's raping each other or
crack whore's huffing turpentine or whatever it is that you have us Wow
That's the most worked up 've ever seen you
98 He was protecting me
So
He likes me
Don't be cute
You're my knight in shining armor
Don't talk about knights in front of Mark
It's a sore subject
'm gonna kill that motherfucker
Pun intended
Beat as Mark gets it
He comes after him
You're dead
They play wrestle as Sam watches
'  -- The three of them reach the top of a small hill to reveal
Colossal old cranes and construction trucks loom in the distance like ancient dinosaurs frozen in rust and graffiti
The center of the quarry goes so deep they can't see the bottom
They stand on the edge
Rain clouds rapidly drift overhead
This glace is surreal
Wow
never even knew this was here
've heard about it
They were supposed to build a mall here think
Yeah  remember reading about it in the paper
() 99 They were digging one day and they broke through into this like natural phenomenon
It's like an underground Grand Canyon or something
So now they're in some huge legal battle over whether they can build here or not
Can you imagine the guy who's job it is to fight for the right to build his mall on some like geological phenomenon
They love their mall's here man
Okay let's just find this guy and get outta here
You're not gonna tell us what we're getting
It's a surprise, you'll see
Mark walks on ahead of them down a path that winds down alongside the abyss
1CTERNIAN'  -- Further down the path
Sam looks to Large
He uses an old mop handle he's found as a walking stick
As they continue along the path it begins to get continually cluttered with rusty junk
An old bedframe, a porcelain tub, remnants of a "Jungle-Gym", dirty broken toys
Further along down the path amidst the junk they see a perched on cement blocks that sits right on the edge of the cliff
It's windows glow warm and welcoming
Mark stands in front of the boat
This isn't what he expected
Rain begins to fall
guess this is it
So
knock
Knock and barter for "Dessert Storm Trading Cards"
Please don't tease me about my hobbies
don't tease you about being an asshole
They stand in the pouring rain staring at the boat
Mark steps up and pounds his fist on the wooden hull
100 After a moment, , a very gentle looking man in his mid- thirties with a newborn baby asleep on his shoulder appears on the deck
He smiles warmly- (in a whisper) Mark
Yeah
Are you Albert
(with a smile) Yes
Come on in out of the rain
Sam and Large look at each other, then follow Mark up an - frame ladder that sits next to the hull
'  -- They step inside and the door closes behind them
It's very cozy and warm
wood burning stove heats the room and throws warm amber light onto a small with deep cushy couches
You guys must be freezing
Make yourselves warm by the fire
'm just gonna go put her down
'll be right out
The three of them huddle by the fire
They speak in quiet whispers
must say, 've been continually impressed today with how each new place you bring us manages to be weirder and weirder
What do you mean, this is nice
ah nothing, just hanging out in an old boat at the bottom of a quarry in Newark
It's hardly the bottom, dude
Did you see that cliff
Albert returns with , an equally gentle and caring looking woman in her early thirties
This is my wife, Faye
Hi
Hello
101 Hi
Welcome
This is Mark and Sam and Large, right
YEAH_ Diego told me when he called
Please have a seat, make yourselves comfortable
Its really coming down out there, huh
Yeah, it just started pouring all of a sudden
Well in a bad storm  like to pretend this old boat's my own private "ark"
Unfortunately, if this is the apocalypse, 'm not quite sure it still floats
Would any of you like some tea
'd love some tea
Large and Mark look at her
No thanks
No
thanks
Faye crosses to a small kitchen
They all sit there politely nodding at each other
What is it that you do here
What is this place
Good question
We're calling it Kiernan's Fault
And no one's really quite sure what it is because they haven't been able to explore it
They're locked in a legal battle over who has the rights to the land
() 102 So one of these days it will either be a national park or a shopping mall
But while their locked in litigation,  was hired to make sure no one comes inside
Oh
Wow
What they don't know is that 'm a geologist working undercover for the preservation lobby
So, at night
go down
He's documenting it to support their case
Wow
So how deep does it go
No one really knows
've been in the furthest and that was about two miles down
But  like to pretend it's infinite
11 Faye brings them tea
It's kind of an odd job isn't it
Guardian of an infinite abyss
Yeah,  guess it is
We also trade and deal in antique jewelry suppose it's pretty odd for you that we live down here like this- No
Not at all
Never crossed my mind
But we think it's important
Why
What do you think you'll find
don't know
It's exciting
New frontiers are hard to come by these days
guess  just like the idea of discovering something
() 103 Doing something completely unique that no one's ever done before
Large looks to Sam
Yeah
"Albert's Abyss"
Who knows
Maybe
But  used to think that was all that mattered
No matter what it was, as long as could put my name on it
Like it would somehow justify the fact that lived; that  was here
" did that
That's mine
got this plate on my travels
" But you know what
That's all ego; none of that stuff really matters
If at the end of the day  get to be with her, if get to be with this person right here and the baby we created, then that's all  need
Just having felt that
If  die in an hour, know 've lived
Faye kisses his forehead
You know "my whole life 've had that same anxiety that if  didn't discover something or
save something or
Save something from being discovered
Yeah
That 'll have somehow wasted my time here
And that somewhere, whatever force created us, would resent me for it
Well  think that force would rather remind you that "breathing's all it takes to be a miracle"
He takes a deep breath
Large, Sam and mark stare at Albert; He's like a sage
Well i suppose you want what you came all the way down here for
Yeah, that would be great
104 It took me awhile to track this piece down
But  owe Diego huge
He pulls a small paper bag off the counter and hands it to Mark
Mark looks inside and nods his head
That's it
Thank you
They all stand
Well thank you for the tea
Yeah, thanks
Okay, good luck in the rain
Would you like some garbage bags or something
Yeah, that would be great
'  -- They open the door and venture into the,   in their garbage bag parkas
Good-bye
Albert stands with his arm around Faye in their warm doorway
As the three of them climb down the ladder and head up the path
Large turns back' around
(yelling over the rain) r, Hey Albert l Yeah
Good luck exploring the infinite ABYSS1 (with a smile) Thank you

Large leads them to an old yellow crane that's rusty arm hangs out over the 'edge
He climbs up onto it's base
; Large  as loud as he can, with everything he has, like he's emptying himself into the abyss
Sam and Mark look up at him and climb up alongside Large to join hint
The three of them, in their black parkas, with their hair drenched against their heads,  as loud as they can, with everything they have in the

release
perfect moment
: Sam locks eyes on Large
He stares back at her
They kiss
He wraps his hands around the back of her head and they kiss, in the pouring rain, on the edge of something
: '  -- The rain has stopped as Large's motorcycle pulls up in front of Mark's house
mark gets out of the sidecar
So  don't know if 'm gonna see you
know
Don't you wanna know what's in the bag
To be honest,  don't even care anymore
Mark pulls out the bag
It practically falls apart it's 80 wet from the rain
He pulls out an   with a square pendant on it
He puts it in Large's wet hand
'd be lying to ya if  told ya this was my plan all along
() But  got it back
That's got to be worth something, right
This whole day was about this
106 () And anyway you didn't want it down there with her
It's better for you to have it
Large shakes his head; he's shocked
Mark backs away, still wearing his garbage bag parka
(') Hey, if you ever need a Kato, you know where to find me
Large sits back down on the bike into Sam's wet arms
He stares at the pendant in his hand
What is it
It's my Mom's favorite necklace
: -- They sit, soaked from the rain in the empty bath tub where Sarah Largeman drowned,, cross-legged facing each other
Large wears the necklace around his neck
He plays with the pendant
-   : It's an antique game where you try to get three tiny lead balls to sit in three separate indentations
No
don't want to play this game
Why not
'm curious
She's sitting here, across from you and you can say anything at all
All the things you never got a chance to say
() No
() Well  don't want to push you just thought it might help
mean isn't that what you came home for
Re stops playing with the necklace and takes a deep breath
Okay
() would
() If she were sitting here
( ) () 107 if my mother were sitting here would tell her
Silence
The faucet  behind him
What
really don't wanna
() would tell her that 'm sorry
() 'm sorry that she wasn't happy
And 'm sorry  couldn't make her happy
And you know if  could have had anything  ever wanted to have happen in my life actually ever happen, it would have been that she would be happy
And
tiny tear wells in his lid and
spills over
Oh, my God, Large  think  see one
Shut-up
Yeah,  do
Don't move, we should save it or something
She finds a clear plastic cup
(' ) Here don't move, 'm gonna get it
She tries to coerce the- tear off his cheek into the cup, like a child capturing an inch worm
guess  could put it in my scrapbook, if  had a scrapbook
They wait
Is that it
think so
don't feel any more coming
Well if you do, let me know and 'll grab the cup, okay
108 Yeah
This was a good idea
Keep talking
It's funny; this thing reminds me of this really random memory of my mother
Its so weird,  haven't thought about this in so long, but this great memory  have where was a little kid and  was crying for one reason or another and she was kind of holding me and rocking me back and forth
And  could see the little balls in this thing just rolling back and forth
And there was just snot dripping down my nose
( ) And she just handed me her sleeve and told me to just blow my nose into it
And  remember thinking, even as a very little kid, "Wow
This is love
" More tears start to well and overflow from his eyes
He tries to stifle them with a
He cradles the pendant
(') This is love
And it just felt so
good to be there
So safe
And  didn't feel safe very often, but at that moment
Tears are now streaming down his face as well as Sam's
She holds the plastic cup in her hand
oh, Large 'm never gonna be able to get all these
They laugh
She moves closer, wrapping her legs around his waist to hug him close
She kisses his-'wet cheeks
(') 'm never gonna be able to get all these, am
It's so funny isn't it
But think that's the single most amazing moment  remember of my Mother
'Cause she wasn't sad and she wasn't being prodded to be happy, she was just there
To be your Mom
209 He node and tightens his lips; trying to hold in the faucet that his eyes have become; a monumental release
He almost looks like a different person
They stare directly into each other's eyes
He turns away; it's too vulnerable a place for him
(') Look at me
() Look at me
He does
And we see a vulnerable, lonely, little boy
(') (in a whisper) Let go
Listen to me
Just don't hang onto any of it anymore
You're holding on so tight and you just
you don't have to hang onto any of it anymore
Just let it all go
( ) just don't
Just let it all go
He cries with his elbow over his eyes
(') What do you feel
Describe it
That always helps me
My mom always says, "What's the word that's burning in your chest
" She touches his chest with her hand
(') What is it
He looks away
Soared
(') Look at me
He does
(') () What is it
(in a whisper) would say that it's Love
() It's this Love that  have
110 Yeah, it is
() And you've got so much of it in you
God, you do
You've got so many years of it in you, pleading to come out
This fucking hurts
know
But that
that is life
if nothing else
(pointing to his chest) That is life
St's real
And sometimes it burns
But maybe
it might be all there is
() Look at you
Look at you
You look like you just came back to life
He just stares at her
() who are you
() 'm your new friend, Sam
Holding up her sleeve
(') Tissue
They both laugh; a release
Fuck
feel like  just get so much thrown at me; like there's so much speeding by me in a day that feel like if  look up from the sidewalk, 'll get dizzy and fall down
So it's like  just
barrel through and don't look up, so 'll just never fall, you know
And that's really
and you know it's so sad to say this, but that's really how 've been living my whole life
Trying to barrel through
Yeah
111 Well it sounds like you were due to fall
Yeah
() Yeah  was
(beat
Then with a laugh
) Thanks Mom
(beat, realizing) That's funny
The definition's always confused me, but 'm pretty sure that's irony
He smiles
He wipes his tears away with his own sleeve
(') Come here
She comes in for a tight embrace
He kisses her gently on her cheek with his eyes closed, then rests his head on her - shoulder
How do you feel
On Large's face as he thinks about that question
Safe

You've been avoiding me
No,  just
maybe  have been
'm sure you can find plenty of things in your life to be angry about, but what  don't understand is why you're so angry at me
All ever wanted was for everybody to be happy again, Andrew
That's all ever wanted
But when were we ever all happy, Dad
mean you always say that, but when was that
When was this time that you have in your mind that you wish we could all get back to
'Cause  don't have it in my memory
Maybe if  did  could help steer us back there
But we should
() You know
you and  need to work on being okay if that's not in the cards for us
Well we might have a shot at it if you could just forgive yourself for what you did
113 What  did
What  did
You know what, Dad
'm gonna forgive myself for what  did right now:  was a little boy and somebody made a shitty latch
That's what  think now
And 'm not gonna
mean 'm not gonna take all those drugs anymore
Because they've left me completely numb
have felt so fucking numb to everything  have experienced in my life
And for that; 'm here to forgive you
Gideon site up against the headboard
(') You've always said you wanted us to have whatever it is we wanted
Well maybe what Mom wanted more than anything, was for it to all be over
And for me, what  really want more than anything, is for it to be okay with you for me to feel something again; even if it's pain
Going against your doctor's recommendation; that's a pretty weighty experiment to take on don't you think
(with a chuckle) This is my life, Dad
This is it
've spent twenty-six years waiting for something else to start
So no, don't think it's too much to take on
Because it's everything there is
() see now it's all there is
Perhaps the great tragedy of my life, will be that you both deserved more than  knew how to give
We deserved nothing more than you
And you deserved nothing more than us
Large puts his hand on the center of his father's bare chest
(') You and  are gonna be okay
You know that, right
() () 114 We may not be as happy as you always hoped we'd be
But for the first time let's allow ourselves to be whatever it is that we are
and that'll be better
think that'll be better

What are you doing
don't want to hurt you
No
Why
How can you
how could you
What's going on
What happened
We can figure out the long distance thing
Don't
this is a good thing, Large
Don't
you're gonna be
please don't do this
Shestarts crying
Sam
( ) You don't realize
This is good
This doesn't happen often in your life
We can figure this stuff out
wanna help you
We need each other;  haven't even lied in two days
Is that true
No
Look at me
Sam, look at me
This is not over
'm not putting a period at the end of this thing
'm putting like
an ellipses on it
Because 'm worried that if i don't go figure myself out, if don't go land on my feet and be okay on my own, 'm gonna fuck this up
And  don't want to do that
This matters too much to me
115 He checks his watch
(`) This isn't a conversation about this being over
It's about me needing time to
Look,  just fired my psychiatrist,  gotta go out and find a new one
He stares off
Decision time

'm gonna call you
As soon as  get there 'm gonna call you
She nods; heartbroken

She doesn't
(' t ) Look at me
She turns

And 've known you for four days
This is the beginning of something big
But right now  gotta go

As he pulls away she arcs her head to touch his lips for one more second

What are you doing
Remember that idea  had about growing and working stuff out on my own and then finding you when 'd figured myself out
The ellipses
Yeah the ellipses
Its dumb
It's an awful idea
And 'm not gonna do it
Because like you said, this is it
This is life
And 'm in love with you, Samantha
(with a laugh) think that's the only thing 've ever been really sure of in my whole life
'm really fucked up right now, but  don't want to waste any more of my life without you in it
Okay
Yeah
Because  think  can do this know  can
want to
We have to
Yeah
Tears stream down her face
She smiles her angelic smile
118 Okay
(beat, nodding) What do we do
He looks at her and smiles like we've never seen him smile; ; ;
( - ) What do we do
They pause for a moment, staring at each other, transfixed by adrenaline and spontaneity
Slowly Large leans in and they kiss amidst an almost desolate baggage claim area
