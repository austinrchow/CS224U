" " by Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman : - The room is dark
perfectly square mirror hangs crooked on a wall
Suddenly, out of the darkness, the reflection of a man's face comes into focus
He stares straight ahead, perhaps studying his own unrecognizable reflection
It's quite clear this is a portrait of sickness; the man's pallor is gray, his eyes are confused
There is something most definitely wrong
Tentatively, the figure steps away from the mirror, leaving the frame empty and dark
Like a ghost, the naked man (Harvey) stands over his bed staring down at his sleeping wife (Joyce)
In the eerie light, he's almost translucent
(faintly) Joyce
Joyce
Joyce springs up, alarmed
What's wrong, Harvey
What are you doing up
Harvey just stands there for a moment saying nothing
What is it
(delirious, out of breath) Tell me the truth
Am  some guy who writes about himself in a comic book
Or am  just -- am  just a character in that book
Joyce rubs her eyes
Harvey
If  die, will 'dat character keep goin'
Or will he just fade away
Joyce just stares at him, unsure how to answer
Suddenly Harvey collapses
Joyce leaps from the bed, nervous, hysterical
She gets down on the floor and shakes him
Omigod, Harvey
Harvey, wake up
' His eyes remain closed, his expression far, far away
: -  - 1956 - : surreal kaleidoscope of black, white and red
Similar to the mirror scene above, the colors slowly come into focus, revealing the chiseled features of a familiar face
But this time we see that it is not a real face, but rather a plastic mask of the
Comic hero --
:  , 1956 It glows eerily in the light of a porch lamp
child's pupils glare through the eye holes
The camera pans from  to the masked face of another caped-crusader:
Batman turns toward his loyal sidekick , who clutches a plastic, trick-or-treat pumpkin
Next, we find    as he reaches up to ring the doorbell
The camera finally rests on the last boy: an unkempt wearing no costume at all
Looking irritated and removed from the rest of the group, the  shoves his hands in the pockets of his shearling coat
He spits and rolls his eyes as a lady answers the door
The brick home is as working class as it gets
The lady at the door is a 1950's
(in unison) Trick or treat
Well, look at this
All the superheroes on the porch
Ain't that cute
The Lady drops a candy apple in each boy's container
(still yelling) We got Superman here, Batman, his sidekick , ohh, The Green Lantern even
She finally stops at the costumeless
He halfheartedly holds up a ratty, stained pillowcase
And what about you young man
What about what
The other boys giggle
The kid flashes them a "kick yer ass" look
Who are you supposed to be
The kid shrugs
'm Harvey Pekar (pronounced "Pee Car")
Harvey Pekar
That doesn't sound like a super hero to me
(mumbling) Pecker, Pecker
ain't no super hero, lady
'm just a kid from the neighborhood, alright
The Housewife stares at him, confused
Ahh, forget this
Frustrated, the kid throws his pillowcase down
He trudges off as the others watch in confusion
Why is everybody so stoopid
the schlumpy kid (aka  ) as he sulks down the street
: -  - 1975 - :  , 1975 grown-up version of   (now mid-thirties) stomps along the same Cleveland street
Unfortunately, 20 years have made this rust belt neighborhood a bit rustier
The "  " dons the same shearling coat, sports the same disheveled hair, and wears the same curmudgeonly expression
- This is not your typical super-hero stuff
Instead it features our man engaging in such daredevil feats as: -  1975 - --Riding the city bus
- --Working as a file clerk at the Veteran's Hospital
'  /  - --Trying to wash dishes
- --Waiting on line at the supermarket
- --Buying used records from a garage sale table
- --Eating junk food at a greasy spoon
'  - Harvey fixes a rip in his coat with Elmer's Glue
(Note: Each "Cartoon Harvey" looks similar but unique variation on a theme
This is because his cartoons are drawn by different comic artists
) Intermittently, bold cartoon credits flash across the screen: Followed by the explosive title: The high-energy music and upbeat titles -- in direct contrast to the sulking image of Harvey -- continue through the remainder of the credits
- We're now on ' back as he continues his forlorn journey
We move forward, past him, to peer over the hill at the factories below
(
) Okay
We're throwing a lot at ya here, so lemme step in an' help ya catch up
This is the story about comic books, an' a guy who made a whole life outta them
You could even say comics saved his life
This guy here, he's our man, Harvey Pekar -- all grown up and goin' nowhere
Although he's a pretty scholarly cat, he never got much of a formal education
For the most part, he's lived in shit neighborhoods, held shit jobs, and is now knee deep into a second disastrous marriage
So if yer lookin' for romance or escapism or some fantasy figure to save the day, guess what
Ya got the wrong movie
--  ,  ,   -- : -  - The    (not the actor who trudged through the credits) sits behind a microphone, supplying the "voice over" above
He clutches a movie script in his hand
The frame is spare, with a few well-chosen items to indicate that he's in a recording session
Although he is significantly older than the man who portrays him, the "Real Harvey" is every bit as much of a sad sack
maybe even more
He is large and slightly threatening with knitted brows and wild eyes
Yet there is something kind and vulnerable about him -- a teddy bear who could kick your ass
Off Camera,   the voices of the male and female directors (us --  and ) coaching the "Real Harvey" through his voice over
Harvey's irritable and contrary, saying that the whole Halloween incident never even happened
"But  don't care man
'm just doing this for the dough
" We learn that Harvey is a reluctant participant in a film being made about his life
, his third wife   -- an intelligent control freak obsessed with all things negative -- joins in the conversation
Pushing back her huge glasses, she reprimands Harvey like he is an infant: "Harvey you are talking too loud, Harvey you are being difficult
" Harvey just rolls his eyes
Joyce gets offended
It is clear they have had this argument a million times
As Joyce storms off
Harvey explains that his wife is trying to take over the movie
He laments that she is his third wife, and he has no luck with women
"Man, chicks just don't dig me
" That's why he marries anyone who will have him
"And  marry them fast before they get to know the real me
" : -  - 1975 - : 1975 sits on a table in his -shirt and underwear unwraps a tongue depressor
Harvey's voice is hoarse, raspy and barely audible
It sounds like it hurts for him to talk
Yet, he can't stop ranting
Doc, you gotta help me
My old lady's dumping me 'cause  can't talk
She says 'm a social embarrassment
Now that she's got her PhD, she's some hot shit academic star an' 'm nuthin' but a file clerk with nothin' ta say an' no voice ta say it
But me bein' a file clerk was fine when  wrote the damn check for her tuition -- #1 Harvey, stop talking please, and open wide
He points the tongue depressor at Harvey's mouth but he just keeps on going
just don't get it
We were doin' okay for a while
Then we took that stupid belated honeymoon
started losin' my voice on the plane
Can you believe that
On the plane, doc
#1 Bad timing,  guess
Now please say "Ah," Mr
Pekar
"Ahhh
" (without missing a beat) "Ahhh" ruined the trip
got crazy, started to worry my voice would never come back
mean, my wife didn't know me so long before we got hitched
What if she totally forgets what 'm like
Man, it's torture -- #1 Shhh
The Doctor shines a penlight into Harvey's mouth and looks around
#1 Uh-huh
He raises an eyebrow
Harvey catches this
Hypochondria overtakes him
(the penlight in his mouth) What
Is it bad, doc
The Doctor removes the penlight
#1 It's not good
Harvey jumps off the table
It's cancer
First  got marital problems and now yer tellin' me got throat cancer
Omigod
#1 Harvey, calm down
It's not cancer
You have a nodule on your vocal chords
Probably from screaming and yelling too much
And if you don't stop talking and give it a rest, you're gonna lose your voice completely
Relieved, Harvey calms down
He nods, agreeing to be good
Whew
Okay, okay
But fer how long
#1 few months
(loudly) Months
Suddenly Harvey's voice cracks under his effort to raise it
He sheepishly grabs his throat
#1 See
More of that and you'll do permanent damage
Now go home, keep your mouth shut, and hopefully we won't have to operate
Operate
Harvey gets nervous again
The Doctor throws him his clothing
: -  - 1975 - silent sequence
dejected  walks home alone along an empty lot
Day-old dirty snow clings to the ground
He wanders through a down-in-the-heels neighborhood, passing run-down stores and ramshackle apartments
-  - 1975 - Harvey approaches  -- a dumpy 20-something going on 60- something in ridiculous, mismatched polyester clothing
He is odd, awkward and talks with a monotone, robotic voice
In short, he is a super dork
Hi Harvey
You weren't in work today
Are you okay, Harvey
Harvey barely looks up
He nods his head "yes" and keeps walking
(yelling after him) 'm heading downtown to the White Castle
Wanna come, Harvey
Harvey leaves Toby behind and turns the corner
-  - 1975 - Two  argue loudly over a payphone
#1 (in Spanish) already told you, 'm waiting for a call
#2 Oh yeah
Since when is this your private office
#1 Since you can kiss my ass
Harvey stops in his tracks and stares at them, jealous of their ability to speak
:   #1's (to himself) Look at 'em yakkin'
How do they do it
Out of the corner of her eye,  #2 notices Harvey eavesdropping
#2 (yelling at Harvey) Ay, what are you looking at
Maricone
Startled, Harvey moves on
-  - 1975 - He passes a group of  playing in the snow
They scream, yell and laugh with abandon
(shaking his head) They all make it seem so easy
Then,
Harvey is awakened from his reverie by a snowball
The kids laugh loudly
He wipes away the snow and walks on
interrupts the scene
(
) Here's our man walking home from the doctor's
He's got the weight of the world on him
And fer what, really
'Cause his throat's a little screwy
Man, people in India are starvin' to death every day
His problems are nothin'
: - Totally dejected,  crosses over train tracks on his way home
(
) Still, he can't help feelin' paranoid, like some supernatural force is conspiring against him to rob him of his voice
'  -  - 1975 - Harvey sulks up the steps of his brick low-rise apartment building
He passes an   coming down the walk with her shopping cart
Harvey unlocks the door
(
) Maybe his old lady will go easy on him today, when she sees how upset he is
'   -  - 1975 - Harvey's second wife  -- a hippyish chic with long hair and a bad attitude -- pulls books off a shelf and selectively throws them onto the floor or packs them into a milk crate
An overstuffed suitcase sits beside her
She's obviously leaving him
enters the room
(whispering) Ay
What is this
Harvey's voice breaks up
Exactly what it looks like
(loud) Whattya mean
You mean yer dumpin' me
Fer what
(his voice really rips) Ah, shit
That last yell did it
Harvey grabs throat in pain, torn between his throat discomfort and trying to stop his wife from leaving
Look, your plebeian lifestyle isn't working for me anymore
Cleveland's not working for me anymore
gotta get out of here before  kill myself
But -- She gathers her bags and heads for the door
Harvey trails her, trying to reason
He opens his mouth, but nothing comes out
(mouthing, just a wheeze) Please
Wait, honey
Just listen to what  got to say
She turns and stares at him
Harvey tries to say something
But now nothing at all comes out of his mouth
Only wheezes air
He tries again
No sound at all
Finally  gives up, turns back towards the door and leaves
: - 1975 - At his cubicle in the file room, Harvey fills a cart with files
He's physically at work, but mentally in a daze
(
) Here's our man -- yeah alright, here's me -- or the guy playin' me, anyway, though he don't look nothin' like me, but whatever
So it's a few months later an' 'm workin' my flunky, file-clerk gig at the
Hospital
My voice still ain't back yet
Things seem like they can't get any worse
nurse pops her head in
Harvey hands her a file
Thank you, Harvey dear
He doesn't hear her, still stewing about
He shoves the last files in the cart and pushes it away
(to himself) Plebeian
where the hell did she get that shit
: -- We see rows and rows of endless files
Still in a daze, Harvey removes the files from the cart and puts them on the shelves
(
) Avoid the reeking herd
Shun the polluted flock
Live like that stoic bird, The eagle of the rock
Harvey turns around
Mr
Boats -- a portly, African-American maintenance worker wearing a bow-tie -- steps into Harvey's row
He has a tool box
Huh
Oh
Hiya, Mr
Boats
Harvey resumes shelving
You know what that means, son
Yeah
It's from an Elinor Hoyt Wylie poem
It means stay away from the crowds of common ordinary people an' do yer own thing
Mr
Boats laughs
Nope, it means don't compromise yourself for women
Ain't gonna do you no good
Get away from 'em as soon as you can
Well  ain't got no woman now
So 'm living like the stoic bird, man
The only way to live, son
Somehow this doesn't make Harvey feel any better about his life
-- Harvey carries an armful of files
Mr
Boats still trails him, lugging his tool box
Suddenly, Mr
Boats points out a young African-American wearing a pair of big headphones on his afro
He moves as if he's listening to music
Look at that fool over there
What's he wearing
Huh
That's an
-
radio he's listening to
They got 'em fixed up now like a pair of earmuffs
(inappropriately angered) Isn't that somethin
People have gone crazy
They'll buy any kinda junk
Probably listening to that loud rock stuff
Junk, junk, it's all junk
Well,  don't know
Rock music's got some good qualities
mean it ain't jazz or nothin'
Mr
Boats looks at him like he's crazy
Say, when you gonna bring me in some good records
Some Nat "King" Cole with Strings
don't got any of that, Mr
Boats
Mr
Boats stops and yells down the hall at Harvey
Yeah, you got it
You're keepin' it at home, though
You won't turn loose the good stuff
You just sell the junk
Harvey shakes his head as Mr
Boats finishes his diatribe
Mr
Boats turns into a room
(singing) Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Men have named you
: -  - Harvey sits on outdoor furniture
few props are featured in the frame indicating a garage-sale-like setting (including a record player)
Directly in front of Harvey are boxes of used records
shows us his prodigious record collection
Thousands of 's -- rare jazz, blues, fusion, klezmer, etc
-- are piled in floor-to-ceiling bookcases
He tells us about his love of jazz and how he started writing jazz reviews and music articles
He finds the first record that he reviewed and puts it on his turntable
As the music plays
Harvey talks about how he started buying and selling records
This leads into how he first met
: -  - 1962 - : 1962 (a little more hair but the exact same style) and a bunch of his  sift through old records at a junk sale
(
) In the early sixties  was with some buddies at a junk sale looking for some choice sides when  met this shy, retiring cat from Philadelphia named Bob Crumb
You know the guy; Fritz the Cat, Mr
Natural an' all -- they made a movie about him, too
One of Harvey's pals --  -- pulls a record out of a box
'mon, Harv
You dig Jay McShann
You gonna buy that or what
Harvey jumps up from his search to check out the
don't know, Marty
It's got a lamination crack in it
(checking out the price) quarter
Maybe  can get him down
You are one cheap bastard Harvey
Yeah,  know 'm tight, man, but live on a government wage
skinny guy with a big nose, glasses and a ratty trench coat taps Harvey on the shoulder
He is soft-spoken, a bit shy and very odd -- a young
You collect Jay McShann, man
Yeah, man
How 'bout you
Yeah but most of my records are back in Philly
greaser-type guy in a leather jacket, , joins them
Harv, meet my buddy Bob Crumb
He just moved to town
He's an artist at American Greeting Card Company
That's cool
You should see his comics, Harv
They are outta sight
(interested) Yeah
'm into comics myself
: '   -  - 1962 - disheveled mess that gives new meaning to the term bachelor pad
Records and books are strewn everywhere
(
) So Crumb showed me this comic book novel he was working on -- 'd never seen anything like it
marches back and forth holding Crumb's illustrated comic novel
sits on the floor nursing a beer and sorting through vintage comic books
Harvey's bursting with so much enthusiasm, it's almost aggressive
It's terrific, man
really dig your work
Crumb ignores Harvey's praise
(holding up a vintage comic) This   book is by Walt Kelly
It's pretty rare
Yeah
Can  get good bread for it
Nah
Not yet
Harvey flops down in an overstuffed chair
Stuffing flies out
He sips his beer
Listen man, let's get back to your book
What are you gonna do with it
(looking up) hadn't thought about it
It's just an exercise
Harvey flips through the book
It's more than an exercise
It's breaking ground, man
There's some wild shit in here
Crumb is immune to Harvey's enthusiasm
You're spitting on me, Harvey
: '   -  - 1962 - lies on the couch sketching while  reads more of scratchy jazz record plays
(
) Crumb and  hung out a lot back then
We had records and comics in common
' We see Crumb is actually sketching Harvey, slumped in a chair reading a book
Crumb makes Harvey look like a smelly, sweaty madman with ratty clothing
Crumb holds the sketch of Harvey up to show him
(laughing) Check it out, man
Pretty scary
Harvey glances up at his portrait, completely unselfconscious
Yeah, ya don't know the half of it
Harvey goes back to reading
Crumb back to sketching
(
) Eventually people got hip to Crumb's art work and he started hangin' out with a Bohemian crowd
After a while, he got sick of greeting cards and moved away to San Francisco where he got the whole underground comic scene off the ground
Crumb slowly evaporates from the room, leaving Harvey totally alone
45 (
) He'd come back ta Cleveland every few years, an' people'd treat him like a celebrity
The record spins and spins
: - 1975 - (Now circa 1975) On a sketch pad we see a deranged, tormented Harvey sitting alone on a park bench
He pulls at his hair, and looks as though he may murder the next person who walks by
:   1975 As the pencil adds shading to Harvey's face,  : (
) Once he came to visit when  was really feelin' bad
It was right around the time of my throat operation, an' right after my second wife left me
At first it was pretty weird
mean, here my life was falling apart an' everything was going great for him
was on my second divorce an' he was a big hit with the chicks
was a nothin' file clerk and he was this famous cartoonist
and
sit on a park bench together by a bus stop
distraught Harvey whines while Crumb just sketches
Harvey's voice is still raspy
dunno, man
On the one hand most women gettin' graduate degrees wouldn't give a guy like me the time a' day
An' she married me an' everything, so  gotta give her some kinda credit
But then she got so mean to me in the end
An' it ain't like  tried t'keep her captive or anything like that, y'know
Crumb may or may not be listening to Harvey
It's hard to tell
An' then on top of it  lost my voice for three months
still sound like shit, but before  had nothin'
Man, talk about hell
started forgettin' what  sound like, y'know
So started writin' stuff down -- stories an' things, my points a' view, ideas
even published a couple jazz record reviews
guess that ended up bein' a good thing
Uh-huh
But don't think  buy into this "growth" crap
Everybody talks about how bad experiences can cause ya t'grow, an' all that cliched stuff
've had enough bad experiences and growth to last me plenty
(a beat) Right now, 'd be glad to trade some growth for happiness
For a moment, they both just sit there saying nothing to each other, each man in his own private universe
Finally Harvey looks over to Crumb
So how long are ya stayin' in Cleveland
Crumb never looks up from his picture
dunno, man
gotta go visit this chick in New York
And 'm really busy with the comic book stuff
It's good bread and all man but 'm getting fed up with the whole scene
What are ya talkin' about
Yer makin' a good living doin' yer art
Sheesh
How many guys get that lucky in their life, huh
Yeah,  dunno
Ya know man, people are startin' to know the name "Crumb
" When you croak you're gonna leave something behind
Yeah, my ashes and some crappy doodles
It's not like 'm Blind Lemon Jefferson or Big Mama Thornton
'mon, man
It sure beats workin' a gig like mine -- being a nobody flunky and sellin' records on the side for a buck
Yeah, well that's true
Harvey nods in agreement, mulling this over
He's not at all offended
: - 1975 - : "
" hand reaches into the frame and opens the drawer
By rote,  fumbles with a large stack of "expired patient" files
He places each into the appropriate alphabetical "deceased" drawer
Attempting to grab another batch, Harvey accidentally knocks the entire pile onto the floor
Damn it
He crouches down to survey the mess -- a collage of "expired lives" laid out before his eyes
We move past dozens of anonymous names -- William Anderson, Louis Collins, Mark 'Amico, Tyrone Moore, Franklin Ray, etc
Each file has a red "Deceased" stamp
Depressed,  is transfixed by the files surrounding him on the floor
Suddenly he stops and picks one up
: It is marked, "
" He opens the folder and reads the stats
Born: 1920 in Cleveland Died: 1920 in Cleveland Occupation: Clerk : He swallows hard as he reads about Charlie's small, invisible and now vanished life
He tosses the folder back onto the pile
: '  - 1975 - : sits at a table with a pen in hand and a blank sheet of paper in front of him
Nothing seems to come to him
He flips through a pile of comic books -- everything from Comic Super Heroes to underground works such as Crumb's Mr
Natural and Zap Comix
No inspiration
Harvey throws them down in frustration
'm starvin'
: - 1975 - pushes a cart through the cramped aisles of a crowded supermarket
He pulls a few cans of Beef--Roni off the shelf and heads off to pay
Reaching the check-out area, he evaluates the situation
- : There are three lines to choose from
Two of the counters have long waits
The third is much shorter but there is an next in line
,     : The      remains Harvey at the supermarket deliberating over the check-out lines
However, the      now contains a appears over  ' head revealing his thoughts
It reads: "Pickin' the right check-out line is an art
There's a lot of things you gotta consider
" Harvey decides to get behind the Old Lady
Cartoon Harvey stands behind the Old Lady
new  reads: "It may be the shortest line but  am takin' a chance 'cause she's an Old Jewish Lady
" The  rings up the Old Lady's purchases -- a few kitchen glasses
(Yiddish Accent) Listen, goily, dese glasses are six for $2
00 because  couldn't carry twelf
But  vanted twelf so today 'm buying six more
But you should only charge me $1
50 for dem
It's ok, you can esk de meneger
Harvey rolls his eyes and stamps his foot impatiently
He knows he's in trouble now
(yelling) Frank
need a price check
, Instead of still comic panels with balloons, the Cartoon Harvey now rants directly into the camera
Man, Old Jewish Ladies will argue forever with a cashier about anything
Get behind them in a line an' yer gonna wait forever
The Human Harvey seems oblivious to his cartoon replica
He impatiently leans on his cart, waiting and seething
mean, 'm a yid myself, an' the women in my family are like that
But  never got used to it
may be cheap, but  got limits
The  finally arrives
The Old Lady haggles with him, too
Please
Let me 'splain von more time
The Cartoon Harvey turns to address the Human Harvey, who actually looks him in the eyes
It now seems Human Harvey can actually hear his cartoon alter ego
Wake up
You're whole life's gettin' eaten away by this kinda crap
What kind of existence is this
Is this all a workin' stiff like you can expect
Ya gonna suffer in silence fer the rest a' yer life
Or ya gonna make a mark
Huh
Huh
, Suddenly motivated by an odd notion, Harvey abandons his grocery cart and runs out of the supermarket
: '  -- Bursting with ideas, Harvey (wearing his undershirt and boxers) starts story-boarding his first comic with stick figures
: '  - 1975 - bleary-eyed , still clad in an undershirt and boxers, dozes off over a bowl of Corn Flakes
On the table next to some spilled milk are a stack of papers covered with scribbling
He clearly has been slaving over this work all night
: At the top is a quickly scribbled title, "Standing Behind Old Jewish Ladies In Supermarket Lines
" These are ad hoc versions of a comic book
The pages are divided like a tick- tack-toe board
Each square is filled with crude stick figure drawings and lots of writing
An alarm clock goes off
Harvey's eyes fly open
Shit
Work
Harvey yawns, then notices the pile of papers
He peruses them, proud of his work
He gets up and looks out the window
/
'  - '  - 1975 - It is yet another grey day in Cleveland
The neighborhood is run-down
Garbage is strewn everywhere
The following scene unfolds through the window: Two   lug an old, smelly mattress from a garage towards the garbage cans on the curb
Their conversation is distant, but entirely audible
#1 So how smart is she
#2 dunno
guess she's about average
#1 Average
Hey, man
Average is dumb
They drop the mattress in place
With the window framing these guys, the scene , looking just like a comic book panel
'  - Harvey turns around from the scene and ponders it
He moves back towards his pile of stick-figure drawings
Harvey scribbles the words " " at the top of the page
: - 1975 - The following scene is shot through the restaurant window
We see reflections of people walking by
tense  starts at  as he eats a burger and reads Harvey's mock-ups
Harvey doesn't touch his burger deluxe and nervously talks in his laryngitis-afflicted voice
See, ever since  read your stuff, man 've been thinking  could write comic book stories that were different from anything being done
(munching on a fry) Uh-huh
'm thinkin', the guys who do animal comics and super-hero stuff are really limited 'cause they gotta try to appeal to kids
And underground comics like yours have been really subversive or opened things up politically
But there is still plenty more ta be done with 'em, too, y'know
Pass me the ketchup
mean with pictures and words, it could be more of an art form
Like those French movies are
Or De Sica over in Italy, y'know
So  tried writin' some things about real life
Stuff the everyman's gotta deal with
Crumb finally looks up from Harvey's work
These are about you
Er, yeah
You turned yourself into a comic hero
Sorta, yeah
But no idealized shit
No phony bullshit
The real thing, y'know
Ordinary life is pretty complex stuff
Crumb reads more
Harvey waits anxiously
Finally Crumb starts to chuckle
These are really good, Harv
(insecure) Really
Ya think so
Crumb shuffles through more
Yeah
This is great stuff, man dig it
Can  take them home and illustrate them
Harvey is practically bursting
Wow
Harvey's voice breaks like a kid in puberty
He clears his throat
And something miraculous happens
When Harvey opens his mouth to speak his
You'd do that for me, man
That'd be great
can't draw a straight line
Hey, what's up with your voice, Harv
All of a sudden it sounds fine
(thrilled) don't know, man
guess you cured me
-    - bounds towards the snack room where a group of hospital workers and patients hang out
He bangs on the window to get their attention
When they look up, Harvey waves a comic book in the air
: -   - , - : Scrawled across the top in big red letters reads, "
Vol
#1"  man's finger points to the words, "All Stories by Harvey Pekar
Art by
Crumb
" The comic book sits atop a table in the dreary snack room
crowd of  , , , , etc
(under ten total) gather around a proud who shows off his work
For the first time, he seems almost happy
(beaming) See that
All stories by yours truly
with a portable  cranes to get a glimpse
Hot off the presses, huh
We got a regular Hemingway here
No way, Jack,  don't go in for that macho crap
#3 chimes in
#3 didn't know you could draw, Pekar
Nah
don't draw
just write the stories
buddy of mine and some of his friends do the art work
, the supernerd from the bus stop, grabs the comic book off the table and peruses it
Harvey, am  in here
You promised would be in here
Yeah
Yeah
You're in there, alright
Jeez, Toby
,
-- Harvey's philosophical co-worker -- pushes his way thorough the crowd
He snatches the comic out of Toby's hand
Let me see this
Mr
Boats, it's not polite to grab things
Next time -- Son, you done good
Ya know,  was up in Toronto a few weeks back an' saw the Red Chinese Ballet
As Mr
Boats talks, the crowd starts to disperse
Now that was beautiful
The way those people were dancing together
Those Chinese work hard
tell ya, they work hard -- Where is everybody goin'
Mr
Boats hands the comic book back to Harvey and turns on his heels
Through the window he notices moving down the hall
Where these sickly men rushin' off to
They ain't goin' nowhere for now
Maybe not for a long time
But damn if they ain't in a rush to get there
Harvey stands there, his moment of glory passed
But it's okay
He flips through his comic and smiles
: -
- 1975 - motley group of  hang out on a street corner in front of the Association of Polish Women
heads towards them
Hey look guys, here comes Captain America
Harvey rolls his eyes
(yelling out) You gonna hang with the boys now that yer a comic book star
Harvey turns red
He's embarrassed but part of him loves the attention
Cut it out
Man,  ain't nothin' yet compared to Bob Crumb
#3 Ah, listen to him
One lousy comic book and he wants to be Crumb
The  laugh
crouches by the wall, reading his trading cards
Hey Harvey, if ya wanna make comics for adults, ya oughtta put some dirty stuff in it
#3 Yeah, you can write about Marty's sex life
Harvey hangs with the guys but he doesn't engage
He seems to be observing them more than interacting with them
#3 Right Marty
heard ya went out with Bonnie yesterday
Yeah
Howdja do
Wudja git offa her
Ah, lousy
All's  got wuz armaround
The guys all stare at him for a moment
Then they crack up
: -  - : #2:  - - is bombarded with questions about his date with Bonnie
He complains that all he got was "arm- around
" The   holds the above comic book in his hand
The stage is set with a few items that indicate a comic book store
talks about a couple of "American Splendor" issues and how they impacted his life -- recognition as a writer, etc
He gives his philosophy about the comic book, etc
( #3, #4, #5, #6,
)
: '  -
- 1980' - sits alone in his cubicle
He doodles stick figures on a pad -- some ideas for a new comic
His posture's miserable
He rubs his temples like he's in anguish
(
) Here's our man eight comics later, a brand new decade, same old bullshit
Yeah sure, he gets lots of recognition for his writin' now
Sure his comics are praised by all the important media types tellin' people what to think
But so what
It's not like he makes a livin' at it like Bob Crumb
He can't go an' quit his day job or nothin'
Several shots of Harvey just thinking, scratching his face with a pencil, tapping his foot nervously
Each shot is separated by a second or two of black (an homage to Harvey's wordless panels)
Finally, he goes back to writing
(
) Who am  kiddin'
Truth is 'd be lost without my work routine
: '  - 1980' - Alone in bed, Harvey wakes up in a cold sweat from a nightmare
He looks horrified, short of breath
(calming himself down) got a job
got a job
: '  -
- 1980' - scratches his head
Harvey writes " got a job" in a balloon over the stick figure's head
(
) So -- to stave off desperation and feelings of uselessness --  resigned myself to a menial existence
But hey, maybe the guy who's had a happy life feels worse just before he dies than th' guy who had a sad one
Or, maybe not
dunno
Maybe  just needed a woman
Toby comes in, decked out in plaid and stripes
He has an empty messenger bag
Hi, Harvey
Do you want these gourmet jelly beans
gave up sweets for lent
Harvey turns around
He seems down, depressed
Huh
Sure, 'll take 'em
Toby watches Harvey eat a few
Hey, watermelon
That's pretty good
recommend the pina coladas
They are excellent and very authentic tasting
Toby heads down a file row and proceeds to take a few off the shelves, stuffing his bag
Harvey gets up and comes after him
Hey Toby, can you eat lentils during lent
Sure
don't see why not
You can't eat meat on certain days, but lentils should be acceptable anytime
Ya think there's any connection between lentils and lent
don't think so but 'll ask Sister Mary Fred at church on Sunday
Sister Mary Fred, huh
Is she cute
Sounds kinda mannish but who am  to be picky
Harvey, you're funny
She's a nun
So what
Maybe she became a nun because she couldn't get a guy
Harvey, she became a nun because she had a higher calling
Higher calling
That is such a crock of shit
don't know why you waste your time prayin' anyway
Well, Harvey,  like the ritual
And 'm a very spiritual person
You know, you should try believing in something bigger than yourself
It might cheer you up
Toby turns on his heels and walks off
(calling after him) What
Do  seem depressed, Toby
Toby doesn't respond
Harvey shrugs and digs deep into the jelly bean bag
He pulls out a fistful
' Jellybeans in every imaginable color
Harvey fingers a few and then picks a blue one
(
) Cut
: "" -  - few items from the previous scene are present on the sound stage indicating that it's a set of   -- The Movie
stands alone, his hand filled with Jelly beans
Okay, that was great
The bakery scene is next
steps out of the frame, revealing a craft service table behind him
At the table, the   and the load up on donuts
The two discuss the food on the set
Ironically, the Real Toby is actually more extreme than the Actor who plays him -- even more robotic, and completely incapable of eye-contact
The   discusses the finer points of nerdom and evaluates the Actor's nerd quotient
The Real Harvey explains to Actor Toby that nothing -- not even gourmet jelly beans -- would have cheered him up at that point in his life
He was too lonely and depressed
: '  - 1980' - Light pours through the curtained window
Naked and disheveled,  tosses and turns in bed
(
) My loneliness was unbearable, man
Weekends were the worst
Sometimes in my sleep, 'd feel a body next to me like an amputee feels a phantom limb
-- Extreme wide shot: a city-street overpass spans across the entire frame
The lone figure of Harvey sulks there in the middle, watching traffic pass below
(
) Sure my comics were bringin' me notoriety, but my personal life was in shambles
thought a little attention would make me feel better
It only made me feel worse
: -  - 1980' - It is a beautiful, sunny day
The trees are in bloom
There's the first scent of spring in the air
Kids play in the street
Music pours out of passing cars
Everyone seems to have a smile on his or her face except
He walks on the shadowy side of the street
- Establishing shot of  trudging into the bakery
-  - 1980' - couple of  order bread and cookies from surveys the donuts
#1 (yelling to Harvey) Next
(to the Counter Girl) Yeah
'll have two crullers, a jelly donut with powdered sugar
And you got any "day old bread"
woman with attractive Irish looks brushes past Harvey on her way to the door
This is  , roughly Harvey's age but there is a tired, weary look in her eyes
Hey, you're Harvey Pekar
Half in a daze, Harvey stares at the chick
Yeah
Alice Quinn
From school
Harvey studies her face
Suddenly, it clicks
Oh yeah
College
We had a couple lit classes together
Harvey pays and receives his items
They step back towards the door
What happened to you
You just disappeared after one semester
Harvey scratches his armpit
know, man
got good grades and all but there was this required math class
can't do math, an' that required class hangin' over my head made me crazy
Eventually the pressure got to be too much
Well, you're doing okay anyway heard all about your jazz reviews and your comics
This perks Harvey up
Ya did
Sure, you're famous
Meanwhile  got my degree but 'm just a plain old wife and mother
Harvey stares at her wedding ring
His face drops
Yeah
'm not doing as great as ya think
My second wife divorced me and  work at a dead end job as a file clerk
Sometimes  hang out with the guys on the corner but most of the time  just stay home by myself and read
Alice laughs
You're luckier than you think
My husband and kids make it impossible for me to cuddle up with a good book
: -  - 1980' - and  continue their conversation as they stroll towards her car
'm reading this book by Dreiser now -- That's one of my favorites
hope it don't end like so many a' those naturalist novels
With someone getting crushed ta earth by forces he can't control
Alice smiles
think you'll be pleasantly surprised
It's certainly not a Hollywood happy ending, but it's pretty truthful
Which is rare these days
This hits home with Harvey
He can't believe he's made such a connection with this woman
Alice stops in front of a beat-up station wagon
This is me
Nice car
don't have one yet
Can  give ya a lift somewhere
Nah
It's a nice day
'll just walk
Harvey looks down, a little sad
Well, we should have you over sometime for dinner
Sure, 'd be glad t'come
But if you really wanna do me a favor, introduce me to some a' your single girlfriends
bet they're all smart like you
'm no catch, though, so 'll take anything you can get me
Alice pecks Harvey on the cheek
'll work on it
She gets into the car
Nice seeing ya Harvey
Harvey watches as she drives off
(
) When  got home,  finished reading It was real good, way better than  expected
That Alice wuz right
'   -  - 1980' - The room is moody, dark and lonely
The shadowy figure of Harvey sits on the floor devouring
(
) Sure Lester -- the main character -- croaks in the end, but at least he's old and dies a natural dignified death
: Harvey again, now silhouetted in the door frame, still clutching the book and obsessed by his thoughts
(
) was more alone that weekend than any
All  did was think about an' Alice Quinn an' all the decades of people  have known
Harvey sitting on a chair in the corner of his room
His head is bowed
His shoulders slump over, as if he's struggling with something weighty
(
) The more  thought, the more  felt like cryin'; Life seemed so sweet an' so sad an' so hard t'let go of in the end
: Harvey sprawled across his couch
But he's not asleep; he's still obsessing
The book lies on his chest like a lover
of Harvey's troubled face
Beneath the pain, we see hope and determination
(
) But hey, man
Every day's a brand new deal, right
Just keep on workin' and sump'n's bound ta turn up
: -  - 1980' - An urban comic book shop on a dicey but bohemian street title over picture reads, ",
" - 1980' - , a depressive nudge with a perpetually peptic expression frantically searches the store for something
Her partner, a granola type named , finishes unloading a stack on the shelf
What happened to the new American Splendor
We sold 'em, babe
All of them
Yep
(accusatory) Damn it
put one aside for myself, next to the register
didn't even get a chance to read it
Whoa, sorry, Joyce
didn't know you were such a Splendor fan
Next time take it home
Joyce leans against the counter
She pushes up her glasses and looks really upset
Maybe 'll call the publisher
But they take so damn long
Shit
Why does everything in my life have to be such a complicated disaster
Joyce starts slamming things around the store
Finally Rand grabs his stuff
Okay, 'm gonna hustle before the vibe in here gets any worse
Rand leaves
Joyce barely notices, still brewing
: '  - 1980' - The mess in this room rivals Harvey's
few cats add to the clutter
Joyce lies on her disheveled bed and writes a letter
(
) Greetings from the second smallest state in the union, an endless plastics and nylon plantation controlled by giant chemical corporations
: '  -  - 1980' - takes his mail out of the box
He finds an oddly decorated envelope
(
) To make matters more dismal, there are no decent comic book stores in my town, which is why my partner and opened one ourselves
'  - 1980' - finishes reading the letter sitting on the toilet cat runs around him
(
) Despite our steadily faltering business, my partner managed to sell the last copy of American Splendor #8 out from under me
'm a big fan and  hate to wait for a new order
Is there any way  can get it from you direct
Sincerely, Joyce Brabner
Harvey scratches his head
He mutters to himself
man, she's got good lookin' handwritin'
'  - 1980' - -- We see Harvey in his bed writing
Dear Joyce, Thanks for the letter
Whattya do besides sellin' comics
: - 1980' - We see Joyce standing in front of a
(
) 'm a sometime activist and  teach writing to prisoners
try to help them build an interior life and make art out of their monotonous, suffocating routine
- 1980' - Harvey scribbles a letter while riding on the bus
(
) Sounds familiar
So you married or what
'  - 1980' - Joyce empties her can of cat food in a plate and slides it towards her kitty
(
) 'm divorced, thank god
'  - 1980' - Now we see Harvey (full screen) in bed in his underwear talking on the
He's clipping his toe nails
Look,  think you an'  got a lot in common
How am  gonna get you to come visit me in Cleveland
(
) Cleveland
You think that's a good idea
It's a great idea
You should meet me, 'cause 'm a great guy
Despite the way my comics read,  got a lot of redeeming characteristics
He clips off a big one
'  - 1980' - Joyce sits on her equally disheveled bed dunking a tea bag
Her hair is wet from a shower
don't know
Where would  stay
(
) With me
Don't worry, 'm not gonna put no moves on you or anything
'm not worried about that
(fumbling with a tea cup) Hold on,  just spilled chamomile tea all over my bathrobe
(
) So what are ya worried about then
Joyce sighs and lies down
variety of are across her bed
Different interpretations of Harvey stare up at her
(sipping) Well, the way all those different artists draw you,  don't quite know what to expect
mean sometimes you look like a younger Brando, but then the way Crumb draws you -- like a hairy ape with all those stinky, wavy lines radiating off your body -- it's kind of scary
(
) Those are motion lines
'm an active guy
Anyway, just come out here an' 'll try to be anyone you want me ta be
Joyce smiles for the first time
That's a dangerous offer
'm a notorious reformer
: -   - 1980' - nervous  walks off the plane into the arrivals area
She scans the crowd of friends, family, lovers and limo drivers waiting to meet the disembarking passengers
Where is Harvey
What will he look like
As Joyce surveys the unfamiliar faces, she imagines different versions of an animated, illustrated Harvey among the people
She double-takes as sees the
-- hairy, scary, smelly and picking his nose
Joyce rubs her eyes
Next she sees the   (Gary Dumm), but unfortunately he disappears fast
Disappointed, Joyce notices the realistic walking towards her
She smiles as he dissolves into: (
) Hey
Are you Joyce
Joyce turns around
The flesh and blood   stands before her -- not quite as bad as the Crumb version, not quite as good as the Dumm version, but still acceptable
She sighs with relief
Hi, Harvey
We finally meet in person
She politely offers her hand
Harvey shakes it, but he looks overwhelmed, worried and pessimistic
Hiya
Look, before we get started with any of this, ya might as well know right off the bat
had a vasectomy
Joyce lets go of his hand
She stares at him in disbelief
: - 1980' - The most awkward date in history
Seated in an ultra-yuppie restaurant filled with business lunchers, Harvey and Joyce hide behind their menus
While everyone else looks slick and successful, these two compete for the world's worst posture
What's wrong
Nothing
Somethin's wrong
Yer lookin' around everywhere
guess  never imagined you eating in a place like this
Me
never been here
thought you'd like it
But obviously ya don't, do ya
It's fine
What difference does it make
Harvey shakes his head, feeling more pessimistic
dunno
None,  guess
(beat) They sure got a lot of meat on this menu
You're a vegetarian
Kinda
mean ever since  got a pet cat,  couldn't eat animals anymore
Joyce grabs a bread stick
Hmm
support and identify with groups like , but unfortunately 'm a self-diagnosed anemic
Also, have all these food allergies to vegetables that give me serious intestinal distress
guess  have a lot of borderline health disorders that limit me politically when it comes to eating
Harvey just stares at her
Wow
Yer a sick woman, huh
Not yet
But  expect to be
Everyone in my family's got some kind of degenerative illness
cheery waitress bounces over
(sing song) Good afternoon
'm your server Cindy
What can  bring you two today
They slowly look up at her
: '  - 1980' - and  enter the apartment
The place is a mess, as usual
Look,  was gonna clean up, but why should  give you any false notions
The truth is  got a serious problem with cleanliness
could wash a dish ten times and it'd still dirty
They even kicked me outta the Army 'cause  couldn't learn ta make a bed
Joyce puts down her bag
've seen worse
She slumps down on the sofa as if she's been here a million times
She rubs her head
Harvey sits next to her
Harvey, go get me water and a few aspirin
Harvey just bounces back up and obeys
What, ya got a headache
No, but  want to avoid one
Harvey empties the aspirin bottle in his palm
For some reason, he's feeling more comfortable
Well lemme tell ya Joyce, it sure is nice ta have company
mean, despite all your problems, you seem like a great person
An' hey, sorry if my dating skills are kinda rusty, but 've just been through hell and back with women
mean that last one turned out to be a real nasty bitch
Harvey arrives back with the aspirin
He hands it to Joyce
had a nice time with you, too
Joyce swallows the pill
Harvey sits down next to her
Yeah
You had a nice time
Don't make people repeat themselves
It's annoying
Oh, sorry
They're inches away from each other
'mere
She pulls him close
Harvey plants a kiss on her
They slowly separate
Joyce's eyes are closed
She likes him
He kisses her again
They start making out, moaning a bit
But before it gets heavy -- Harvey
Yeah
Joyce opens her eyes
She looks uneasy
Which door's the bathroom
'  -   - 1980' - Harvey stands by the bathroom door, despondent
From inside we hear the sounds of moaning and flushing
Hey, Joyce
What's wrong
What is it
: '  - Joyce is doubled over on the toilet
She's looking green
Ugh
don't know
think that yuppie food did me in
: '  -   - feel terrible
Lemme at least do something for you
: '  - Joyce gets to her feet and puts her glasses back on
She picks up a can and sprays air freshener around the room
Then she looks at the can and realizes it's -40
Can  make ya something
How about some chamomile tea
Joyce puts the can down
Chamomile tea
What the hell's a guy like you doing with that
thought you drink soda pop for breakfast
(
) dunno
noticed you drank a lot of it when we started talkin' on the phone
So  stocked up on herbal teas for your visit
Joyce turns her head to the door
She's truly surprised by what Harvey's just said
And very moved
She smiles to herself
: '  -   - Harvey stands there waiting
The girl at the Food Co-op picked me out all kinds of herbal stuff
One of 'ems good for stomachaches
Grandma Bear's Tummy Mint,  think
Are you still there
Joyce slowly opens the door
She leans against the door frame like she's just been through a war
She takes off her glasses and cleans them off with her shirt
Harvey, we better skip this whole courtship thing and just get married
: '  - 1980' - Harvey and Joyce are in bed, lying in each other's arms
They look quite contented
Man, am  glad  talked you into comin' up here
Any more time alone and  mighta lost it fer good
Me too
So you don't have any problems with movin' to Cleveland
Not really
find most American cities depressing in the same way
An' yer okay with the vasectomy thing
She shrugs
-
- 1980' - approaches the building
Instead of dragging his feet like usual, he seems to be floating on a cloud
We haven't seen Harvey this happy since
well, since never
He stops by a junker car and peeks in the window, finding eating lunch alone
He has an entire White Castle smorgasbord spread across the front seat
Harvey knocks on the window
Toby rolls it down
Ay Toby
(mouth full) No you can't have any of my White Castle hamburgers so please don't even ask
Can  have a fry
Harvey reaches for a handful of Toby's fries
Okay, but just a couple, Harvey
'm not going to eat dinner until very late and this has got to hold me over
Harvey leans in, always amused by Toby
He steals another fry
(munching) Whattya got, a church function
No, 'm driving to Toledo to see a movie
Would you like to come
Nah
gotta fly to Delaware tonight
'm gettin' married
Oh
Why Delaware
The chick 'm marryin' is from Wilmington
Plus,  gotta help her move her stuff here
(a beat) Why you drivin' ta Toledo to see a movie
It's not playing at the Mapletown
(a beat) didn't know you had a girlfriend, Harvey
Yeah
We met last week
Harvey opens the car door and slides in with Toby
Toby, what movie could possibly be worth drivin' 260 miles round trip for
It's a new film called "Revenge of the Nerds
" It's about a group of nerd college students who are being picked on all the time by the jocks, so they decide to take revenge already saw it once
Wow, ya really dig this movie
like it a lot, Harvey
What are these nerds like
How would you describe them
Hmm
Nerds are smart but they look and act differently than other people
Like nerds might wear polyester button- down shirts and flood pants where their ankles and their socks are showing
Toby spills some catsup on his polyester button-down shirt
He stands up to get a napkin, revealing his flood pants
So what yer sayin' is you identify with those nerds
(rubbing out the catsup) Yes,  consider myself a nerd
And this movie has uplifted me
There's this one scene where a nerd grabs the microphone during a pep rally and announces that he is a nerd and that he is proud of it and stands up for the rights of other nerds
Then, he asks the kids at the pep rally who think they are nerds to come forward
So nearly everyone in the place does
That's the way the movie ends
So the nerds won, huh
(smiling) Yes
Harvey grabs the rest of Toby's fries and opens the door to leave
Wow
You got this movie an' 'm gettin' hitched
We both had a good month, huh
(finishing his last burger) Right
Harvey, how long are you going to be in Delaware because 'd really like to see this movie with you
'm only goin' for a week but then 'll have a wife, so 'll have to take her along
Is it a girl flick
Depends on the girl
What kind of girl is your new bride
Is she a nerd
don't know, man
Maybe
She's into herbal teas
Toby watches Harvey saunter off
He returns to his last hamburger
: - 1980' - brightly lit marquee reads, "
" The doors to the theater open and a crowd pours onto the street
,  and  are among them
Toby proudly wears a "Genuine Nerd" button on his striped shirt
agree with Toby
think it's a story of hope and tolerance
Yes
It's about time that the people who get picked on get to be the heroes
Harvey scrunches his face in disbelief
It's an entertaining flick an'  can see why you like it Toby, but those people on the screen ain't even supposed to be you
They're college students whose parents live in big houses in the suburbs
They're gonna get degrees, get good jobs and stop being nerds
Joyce hits Harvey
Harvey, what did  say about loud talking
Use your inside voice
(whispering loudly) Look Toby, the guys in that movie are not 28-year-old file clerks who live with their grandmothers in an ethnic ghetto
That's enough, Harvey
They didn't get their computers like you did -- by trading in a bunch of box tops and $49
50 at the supermarket
Joyce folds her arms in disapproval
Toby starts to laugh
You're funny Harvey
Harvey looks at him, disappointed
He shakes his head
Sure, Toby
Go to the movies and daydream, but "Revenge of the Nerds" ain't reality
It's just Hollywood bullshit
: '  -- '  ( ) Toby and Joyce continue to analyze the movie in the front seat as Toby starts the ignition
: ' Slouched, grumpy and alone on the back seat, Harvey's still annoyed by the movie
(
) Okay, maybe  was bein' so harsh on Toby onna count a' my own problems
'see,  wasn't even married a month and my old lady was already showin' signs a' trouble
Granted,  tend ta get married fast 'cause 'll take any woman that'll have me, but this time  really met my match
: -  - few items indicating film production are in the frame
At a table in the foreground,    discusses the character of Joyce with the  playing her
The actress just nods as the director goes on
We can see    sitting with    in the distance
Okay,  think the thing with Joyce is that as manic as Harvey can be, she matches him with depression
In that way they complete each other mean, she's obviously a very smart woman, but she has a lot of trouble functioning in a world she can't control
And she's totally obsessed with all things negative; y'know, diseases, dysfuctions, etc
and   listen curiously -- sometimes pleased, sometimes displeased -- as their personalities are dissected and boiled down to a few phrases
The   puts in her two cents about the actress playing her
She rants about what it's like to be portrayed in a movie, and having a character arc imposed on her life
She moves into talking about her relationship with Harvey, and the first years of their marriage -- how impossible it was to live with him
The   just rolls his eyes
: '   - 1980' - is on a cleaning rampage
She rummages through piles upon piles of records while  paces nervously
What about these 78's, Harvey
Can't you sell them to one of those collectors
Are ya kidding
No way, man
ain't getting rid of my 78's
Joyce throws down the records in frustration
Harvey runs over to check if they're scratched
(angry) Forget it then
give up
How can make more storage space, if you won't get rid of anything
'll get rid of stuff
Just not my good stuff
Everything's your good stuff
How am supposed to live here, if there's no room for me
Aw come on, baby
'll make room for ya
You just have to give me time
'm not so good at these kind of things
That's because you're obsessive compulsive Harvey
rings
Harvey slams it to unlock the front
'mon
don't wanna hear that psychobabble crap
don't care if you wanna hear it or not
You're the poster child for the 'll have you know that come from a very dysfunctional family
can spot personality disorders a mile away
interrupts their argument
Joyce storms away to answer it
: Joyce opens it to face a smiling  -- dressed as usual in a loud polyester fashion don't
He talks in his strange robotic voice and avoids all eye contact
Hello Joyce
Is Harvey home
Joyce turns to Harvey and points to Toby
Borderline autistic
This scene shrinks into a square up in the corner
The next few scenes ( ) further divide up the full screen like a comic book
- 1980' - leaps from behind an autograph table (where he's signing comics) to hop on the back of  , who offers him a piggy-back ride
Joyce turns to Harvey
Polymorphously Perverse
: -
- 1980' - picks up Harvey from work
enters the car, waving goodbye to the ranting
She points to Mr
Boats
Paranoid Personality Disorder
'   - 1980' - disheveled, tired-looking  flips through a novel and lets the machine pick up
Please leave a message
(Beep) (into phone) Hey Joyce, it's me
You're not gonna believe this but some  producer called an' he wants to do a play about my life
Call me
(Click) Joyce flips the page
(to herself) Delusions of grandeur
(return to full screen) : - 1980' - and  sit in a packed theater watching a play
Joyce looks exhausted
and a    share a couch on the sparse stage
See,  think comics can be an art form
With pictures an' words, a guy can do pretty much anything
That's true, Harvey
But  didn't come all the way from Delaware to talk about comics
The "Stage Actor Joyce" lunges over and plants a kiss on him
Harvey digs it but Joyce looks disgusted
We now see    clutching a tea cup, as kneels before a toilet bowl
Off to the side of the stage,    illuminates a  , who adds music to the scene
: - 1980' - and  walk through the terminal
Harvey brims with energy but Joyce looks exhausted
(
) If ya think readin' comics about yer life seems strange, try watchin' a play about it
God only knows how 'll feel when  see this movie
But truth be told, the play wasn't half bad, and we got a free trip outta it
Things were goin' pretty good for a change
Variety called me "The Blue Collar Mark Twain," and Doubleday was interested in publishing an anthology of "American Splendor
" : -   - 1980' - Harvey nervously taps his foot as he waits for the bags
Joyce leans against the carousel staring at a with a  in a Bjorn
hate checkin' bags, man
It always takes forever
He checks his watch
Joyce remains quiet and distant
Jesus, look at the time
The bus is gonna leave soon and there won't be another one for an hour
That means gotta shell out an extra thirty bucks for a cab
Harvey spots a bag that he thinks is his
Hey wait, there's our -- (a well-dressed man grabs it) Figures
That lucky Yuppie's gonna get on the bus in time
Suddenly, Joyce mumbles something to Harvey
'know Harvey, vasectomies are reversible
(ignoring her) Damn Yuppies get everything
(raising her voice) Are you listening to me
said vasectomies are reversible
Heads turn
What
Whattya talkin' about
don't want kids
An'  came clean about my vasectomy the first time  set eyes on ya', right here in this airport
More heads turn
know but things have changed think we can be a family
Family
What kinda family could we possibly be
ain't no good with kids
can barely take care of myself
'll take care of the kid and you
(dead serious) No way Joyce
Forget it
can't do it;  can't have no kids
Joyce folds her arms
dejected, defeated
The audience of eavesdroppers looks disappointed as well
: '   - 1980' - If the place was a disaster before, believe it or not, it's gotten worse
seems to have given up on her organizing
and everything else for that matter
hysterically searches through the mess for a record album
Joyce just lies listlessly on an open futon on the middle of the room; it looks as if she hasn't been up in days
Where the hell is that Ornette Coleman album, Joyce
got a review due tomorrow
Joyce rolls over
didn't touch it, Harvey
Would you let me sleep
But it's one o'clock
How late can a person sleep
Joyce sits up
This time she means business
It happens to be Saturday you selfish sonofabitch
And don't you go telling me what to do
'm the one who moved into your city, into your home, into your vasectomy and into your screwed- up life
The least you could do is allow me to live here my way
She rolls over and covers her head with the pillow
Harvey just stands there staring at her
: - 1980' - (
) tried everything but nothin' could get this woman outta bed
peruses the aisles
He pulls box upon box of herbal tea off the shelves
(
) mean she wouldn't get a job, wouldn't go out, wouldn't make friends, nothin'
: '   - 1980' - throws boxes of herbal teas at  as she sprawls listlessly on the futon
She just yawns and turns over on her side
(
) Joyce diagnosed herself as "clinically depressed
"  don't know what the hell she was goin' through but it was sure takin' it's toll on me
frustrated Harvey tries once more to cheer her up
(upbeat) We can go out for dinner tonight
How 'bout catching a bite at Tommy's
(mumbling) 'm not hungry
Harvey throws his hands in the air and walks off
give up
As he passes the answering machine, he notices it's blinking
Hey Joyce, we got a message here
Why didn't you pick up
Joyce doesn't respond
Useless
He presses the play button
:  loud "beep," then
Hi, this is a message for Harvey Pekar
My name is Jonathan Greene and 'm a producer for We'd like to talk to you about coming on the show to plug your comics
Please give me a call at 212-555-3333
(
) What the hell
Joyce sits up
Harvey's finger hits the "Replay" button
Hi, this is a message for Harvey -- : - 1980' - The impressive skyline glistens in the spring sun
(
) Joyce finally got off the futon
: -   - 1980' - Armed with shopping bags from Bleecker Bob's Record Shop, the Strand Book Store and Forbidden Planet Comic Book Emporium,  and  eat lunch on a park bench
Harvey chomps on a knish and watches oddball New Yorkers stroll by as Joyce nibbles on her hot dog
: -- Cut back to reveal Harvey, schlepping an ice bucket down a hall in his underwear
passes and stares at him
He enters a room with a "  " sign
- 1980' - The  have already wreaked havoc on their luxury hotel room
It looks like a tornado touched down on the New York Hilton
tries on outfits for the big show
He pulls a wrinkled -shirt over his head and models it for  who is spread out on the bed surrounded by piles of clothing, scissors and sewing supplies
She glances up at Harvey's getup and shakes her head no
Aw, c'mon
Who the hell cares
Harvey tosses his shirt over to Joyce, who snatches it and starts cutting it with a scissor
Hey, whattya doin
Merchandising
She resumes her mysterious sewing project; she seems to be making some kind of doll
: -   - 1980' - Backstage,  watches      on a monitor as  awaits his turn to go on camera
He has changed out of his wrinkled -shirt into a slightly more formal look -- a denim shirt and a ratty seersucker striped jacket
- (: ) 1980's   wisecracks
-   - 1980' - Neither Joyce nor Harvey look particularly impressed with the whole deal
People like this show
Harvey paces
'm gettin' hungry back here
They oughtta leave ya donuts or somethin'
nervous   wearing a headset peeks his head in
Dave's ready for you now, Mr
Pekar
Hey, you got anything ta eat
My stomach's growling
(checking his watch) There's no time to eat now
Harvey glances at the monitor just as Letterman announces his next guest
- Okay
Our next guest works as a file clerk in a Cleveland hospital
-   - 1980' - The stage manager grabs Harvey by the arm
Joyce stops them
Wait a minute
Where's the doll
He's got it at the desk
Will you relax about that already
Guys, guys, we're in a hurry here
The Stage Manager physically pushes Harvey out of the Green Room
Joyce turns back to face the monitor
- Letterman holds up a copy of a full-size glossy He also writes comic books which detail his day-to-day pains and pleasures, and this is an anthology of nine of those comics
It's entitled From off the streets of Cleveland, please say hello to Harvey Pekar
(only about 15 years younger)
' -   - Joyce watches as Harvey shakes Letterman's hand and takes a seat
- He smiles as the audience warmly greets him
It seems Harvey's grooving on this attention
But as soon as the audience quiets down, Harvey turns to his host and starts his offensive: 'm ready for those Cleveland jokes
Go ahead
Taken off guard, Letterman laughs
Alright settle down Harvey
Settle down
(the Audience laughs) Now let's explain to folks who may not be familiar with your work what it is you do here, exactly
You have comic books about you in your daily life in Cleveland
That's right
And are they embellished at all or is it pretty much factual
(patronizing) No
It's all true, David
All true
And you also have a regular job in Cleveland working at a hospital
That's right
Aiding the sick, yes
Aiding the sick
Well that's certainly noble work
Thank you
Thank you
-   - 1980' - (unimpressed) Such brilliant repartee
: - Now it seems to me Harvey that you have a very successful career here
This is being published by a major publishing company, Doubleday
Why do you maintain the day job
(defensive) To make a living
(big laughs) don't make a living as a writer
've been writing for many years, David
Maybe more years than you've been alive
Now, Letterman cracks up
: -   - 1980' - (Tony Randall
) comes in with some food
He stops by the monitor to watch a moment with Joyce
Yeah,  know that my youthful appearance belies, you know, my actual age
But, 've been around for a long time -- (to ) You know this guy
'm beginning to wonder
The Letterman Regular takes a seat as he watches the monitor
He seems more intrigued than Joyce
- But  have a feeling though, if you wanted to, you could probably get by on what you make selling your work
Because  know people are after you to write other things
You're publishing this anthology
This hits a sore spot
Harvey goes from politely condescending to cantankerous in one second flat
Who
What people
What people
What are you talking about
Where the hell do you get that stuff
Letterman cracks up
The Audience laughs even harder
'm no show biz phoney
'm telling the truth
Come on, man
The Audience can't believe this guy's holding his own with Letterman
-   - 1980' - (to Joyce) At least he's keeping up with Letterman
Pandering is more like it
Suddenly, Joyce walks over to the monitor and looks for the channel
She hits a button, but it only changes the frame of the show
Damnit
Excuse me, but what are you doing
'm trying to get some news
You know there's a big story about to break about the  selling arms to Iran and the Contras
That's a monitor
Ugh
Just forget it
Joyce gives up
She sinks back into her seat and pulls a book from her bag
The Letterman Regular stares at her like she's from Mars
- Harvey,  know you've got a job
've got a job
We're both very lucky
We both have jobs
Then what's the matter
Once again laughs and a big round of applause
Letterman pulls out Joyce's mysterious doll and props it up on the table
We've gotta go
Harvey  like you
'm on your side
enjoy the comic books
And here, quickly tell us about the little doll here
My wife made it
-   - 1980' - She suddenly perks up
Finally something good
(to Letterman Regular) Watch this
-   - It is an absolutely horrific but oddly evocative "Harvey Rag Doll
" His face is inspired by Crumb's drawings of Harvey but even more extreme
His little -shirt reads, "American Splendor
" The Audience is in stitches
They're made out of your old clothing
That's right
And what do these go for
Thirty-four bucks
(shocked) Thirty-four dollars
Thirty-four dollars for this
What are ya cheap
You cheaper than me
Would you pay thirty-four dollars for that
No but 'm not asking it
My wife is
: -   - 1980' - stares at the monitor, expressionless
The sticks his head in
He's a natural
He is
Good stuff
The Stage Manager grabs the Regular
'mon
Your turn
smiling  (the actor now) waltzes in straight from his command performance
Whad'ya think
Joyce taps her finger on Letterman's image on the monitor
Megalomaniac
: - 1980' - tries on a ripped -shirt for Joyce who lies on the bed
(
) It became clear pretty fast that was invited on the show just for laughs
But what the hell did  care
Letterman was an okay guy
Let him take pot shots at me, s'long as got paid an' got to plug my comics
: - :  series of actual  appearances on -   - 1980' - , whose different outfits reflect time passage, watches each time from the
- , in a ratty -shirt, spars with
Harvey, you are the embodiment of the American dream
The Audience laughs
(
) Funny thing is, somethin' about me and Letterman clicked for the viewers
He kept wantin' me back
-   - introduces his favorite guest
It is my pleasure to welcome back our next guest, the lovable Harvey Pekar
walks out with a box of donuts
He starts giving Letterman an earful right off the bat
(
) Here was this slick, ambitious guy with millions, winnin' over the country by makin' light of everything
And then there was me
messy loser with no dough who takes everything too seriously
Tell me Harvey, what do you do to get away from the pressure of being -- well, a file clerk
(laughter) Go ahead and laugh, folks
But he has more contempt for you than  do
: - 1980' - The burger joint has been transformed into a film set with lights, cameras and lots of trendy  types
(
) An it wasn't just me gettin' all the attention
As a result of my appearances on Letterman, my buddy Toby Radloff landed a gig on extolling the virtues of White Castle burgers
: Two   slave over  as he gets his hair and make- up done
wanders onto the set
He finally spots Toby in the corner
As he heads over to say hello, Harvey bumps into the -- a new wave fashion victim who looks like a lost member of
Christ
Watch where you're going
(muttering) Fuckin' yuppie or whatever kinda freak you are
(
) That day on the set with those jerks,  had an epiphany
It seemed that real, salt of the earth people like Toby an' me were bein' coopted by these huge corporations
We were gettin' held up and ridiculed as losers in the system
What can say, it was the 80's man
: , dressed in dark sunglasses and a turtleneck, stands in front of a White Castle
He delivers his lines in his trademark robotic style
There's an  logo on the bottom of the screen
Hamburgers are a safer addiction than drugs
Say no to drugs
Say yes to White Castle
: - 1980' - and  eat breakfast together
Harvey reads a Katherine Mansfield book as  reads a newspaper
(looking up from the paper) Harvey, 've been reading about these kids who grew up in war zones
Palestinians, Israelis, El Salvadorians, Cambodians
These kids are amazing and they're -- in a jogging suit walks up to Harvey, interrupting Joyce in mid-sentence
Hey, you're that guy from the Letterman show, right
(smiling) Yeah, that's me
That's so excellent
You and Stupid Pet Tricks are a riot
Harvey's not smiling anymore
This guy's a jerk
Yeah
Then why dontcha buy one of my comics, man
That's the only reason go on that dumb show anyway
Right, sure
Later, Harvey Pekar
The Yuppie rushes out
Asshole
Anyway,  want to do a political comic book about these kids
There's a conference in Jerusalem in a few weeks, and  can start by doing interviews there
Whoa whoa, wait a second
Jerusalem
can barely drag you off the futon to go to the Letterman show
'know why
'Cause  don't give a damn about the Letterman show want to work on something important to me
Something that matters
Joyce hits a nerve
(furious) Hey
You know  only go on the show for the extra bread
People start to look over
Harvey
you're yelling
Maybe if you got yer lazy ass up and got a job,  could work on something that matters, too, huh
Joyce doesn't dignify Harvey with an answer
She stares at him, her eyes well with hurt
He sighs, calming down
He looks around sheepishly
'm sorry, baby
-- 'm sorry
He grabs her hand
: '  - 1980' - Harvey and Joyce stroll across the lawn holding hands
They move towards a waiting cab
Harvey carries his wife's bags
(
) guess it was good ta finally see Joyce excited about somethin' of her own
Sure  was happy for her
But was still upset for me
They stop by the cab
This is crazy
Can't ya just do somethin' here in Cleveland
Harvey, you'll survive a few weeks alone
Alright
Be careful
love you, baby
They kiss
Harvey grudgingly puts her bags in the car
He watches as the cab pulls away
(
) It was later that night when  first found the lump
'  - 1980' - Wearing only his shorts, Harvey lies alone in the communal futon, flipping through a book
He reaches into his underwear to scratch his nuts
Suddenly he stops
He feels something odd
For a moment he just freezes
His eyes register panic
(
) was determined to put it outta my mind until Joyce got back
Easier said than done
: - 1980' - An enraged  fights with his co-worker
What do  care
Just gimme the chart already
What is your problem today
Look, Miguel
just don't wanna keep comin' back here for it, okay
Harvey, that patient's due t'be admitted a week from now
Why do you always have to be picking fights with everybody
(yelling) How many times do we gotta go through the same bullshit
Just gimme the fuckin' chart
Offended, Miguel storms off
We'll see what the doctor says about this
: '   - 1980' - Alone and slumped over his table,  draws comic ideas with stick figures
Nothing's coming to him
He looks like he's in anguish
Frustrated, Harvey crumbles the idea and throws it on the floor
He knocks over a chair
'  - 1980' - He tosses and turns in bed
No way he's sleeping
: '   - 1980' - is yelling into the telephone
It is a bad connection
(loudly into phone) Whadya mean
Another two weeks
Ya gotta come home some time
Hello
: -   - 1980' - Without Joyce, a surly Harvey waits in the wings for his introduction
He sneaks a peek as Letterman finishes up the "stupid pet tricks" segment
We hear dogs barking and audience laughter
(
) And there you have it, folks
Another enlightening episode of Stupid Pet Tricks
(
) was startin' ta lose it
Between the lump, the loneliness --  felt like everything wuz closin' in on me
And with Joyce over there savin' the world,  never felt more like a sell-out hack in my life
(
) 'know ladies and gentlemen, when Thoreau wrote that most men lead lives of quiet depression, he obviously had not met our first guest, who happens to lead a life of whining desperation
Harvey clenches his fists
(threatening) Okay, asshole
You'll pay for that one
Harvey takes off his shirt
He pulls another t-shirt out of the bag and changes
(
) Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back, Harvey Pekar
Harvey's new t-shirt reads "
" He takes off for the stage, fists clenched, a soldier marching off to war
: -   - 1980' - We're positioned behind the monitor, so we can only hear the show straighten up in the room
(
) Hey, Dave
You wanna know what my politics are
'm a strident leftist, Dave
(
) could have guessed half of that
(
) You coulda guessed all of it, man
So why don't we talk about your parent company,
, huh
Let's talk about anti-trust violations and nuclear reactors
Joe, put more sodas in the fridge, there
And let's clean up the counters
That Pekar guy's a pig
As the
's walk back and forth in front of the monitor, we hear the Letterman / Pekar banter grow louder
Suddenly   #2 stops and checks out the monitor
#2 Whoa
you guys
Check this out
'   - 1980' - and his  watch  raise hell on Letterman
Again, we can't see the screen
(
) You're a cop-out, Letterman
You're nothin' but a shill for
Toby's grandmother passes him a plate of cookies
(
) First of all, Harvey, what you are saying is not true
Second of all, this is not the place to say it
If you want to talk about this, go somewhere else, because you're not talking about it here
: '  - 1980' - Dressed in a bathrobe, Mr
Boats eats a lonely, late-night snack (cake and milk) at his kitchen table
12"  on the table has Harvey and Dave on
(
) Don't worry, Dave
won't come back unless you beg me
(
) You're not coming back at all
(
) What do  care -- (
) Because we've given you many, many chances to talk about things that would be of general interest to people -- (
) So what
Mr
Boats shakes his head
- 1980' - We see Harvey alone, slumped in the back seat of a Town Car, heading back towards his hotel
City lights pass over his troubled face
We still hear the show, as if it's now in his head
(
) -- And also to promote your little Mickey Mouse magazine
Your little weekly reader
But you've blown every chance you've got
You're a dork, Harvey
(
) Dave, you're fulla shit
You're fulla shit
: '  -  - 1980' - The cover depicts a snarling  yelling, " " at a smirking, self-satisfied
lies in bed reading the comic, chuckling
cuddles up against her
guess you did it this time
Who cares
He wasn't helpin' my sales anyway
(moving closer) Baby, don't go away anymore
just can't take bein' alone
Joyce puts the magazine down
If you met those kids over there and saw what they go through, you wouldn't ask that of me
But if you go again 'm really gonna lose it
It's not open for discussion, Harvey
need this in my life right now
She cuddles up close to him
But  do appreciate the fact that you missed me so much
'mere
She starts to kiss him
He kisses her back
Her hands wander down
Suddenly she feels something strange
Harvey, what is that
Harvey looks at her and gulps
: - 1980' - and  sit in the office holding hands, like two terrified high school kids
stands before them
They just got bad news
don't understand, does "tumor" mean the same thing as "cancer"
The doctor gently nods
Joyce covers her mouth
Harvey holds onto his head
He looks positively dizzy
The doctor starts to talk, yet the words don't seem to match his mouth
He looks dubbed
Strange phrases just weave together, echo and bounce off the wall, making no sense at all
we know the growth is malignant
What we don't know is how far it may have spread
Once we have the results of the biopsy, we can make more informed decisions about treatment
blah, blah, blah
The whole office seems to spin
: '  - 1980' - Joyce and Harvey sit on the stoop of their apartment house, in a daze
The words keep echoing around them
Harvey holds his head
#2 cat scan
diagnosis
cancer
cancer
cancer
How can  have cancer
don't feel sick at all
That's a positive thing
My cousin Norman died of lymphoma
He was twenty-nine
He was a brilliant oncologist
Stop it
You're not going to die, Harvey
You're not
Harvey turns to Joyce
What's going to happen to you, baby
Who's gonna take care of you if 'm not around
Joyce stands up, determined
Harvey, look at me and focus
We are going to get through this understand illness
know how to handle these things
But that's you
'm not strong enough
don't know how ta be positive can't do it
can't
Yes, you can
And 'll tell you how
You'll make a comic book out of the whole thing
You'll document every little detail
And that way you'll remove yourself from the experience until it's over
Despite Joyce's passionate pitch, Harvey shakes his head
can't do that
'm just not strong enough
just wanna die
Joyce folds her arm
Fine
'll do it without you
'  - 1980' - and  lay there quietly, both exhausted
Joyce turns over so her back faces Harvey
He puts his arm around her
' tear drips down her cheek
: '  - 1980' - Joyce is straightening up the apartment
The place actually looks halfway decent
Joyce opens the door
guy in his 30's named  -- Hells Angels tough guy meets sensitive artist -- stands at the door
He's accompanied by a seven-year-old girl,
Hey, 'm Fred
You called me about the comic book
Right -- the artist
Come on in
This is my daughter, Danielle
had to bring her along
hope you don't mind
Joyce leans down and addresses the girl, who holds a toy horse
Hi, Danielle
What's that you're holding
pony
It's immediately obvious that Joyce is great with kids
pony
What's his name
She's a girl
Clarissa
Oh,  see
Well, 'm Joyce
Nice to meet both you and Clarissa
They all walk towards the table which is covered with papers
'm really sorry to hear about Harvey
Is he here
He's going to work until next week, when he starts the chemo
That's why wanna get this project started now
Once he's stuck here,  know he'll take over
: '  - 1980' - Miserable and in a daze,  walks up to his front door
He looks like a man whose days are numbered
When he reaches the door, he searches his pockets for keys
Harvey's hand comes up empty
Shit
Harvey tries the doorknob, but it's locked
He steps back on the lawn and looks around
Could he have dropped them
He retraces a few steps
Damnit
Harvey yells up at the window
Joyce, open the door
lost my keys again
Joyce
'   struggles with her shopping cart through the door
Harvey pushes past her to get in
' Harvey knocks again
Nothing
Now he punches the door
Joyce
Open the fucking door
Suddenly the door opens
Loud music pours out
But it's not Joyce, it's , the artist
Hey, Harvey
Fred
Harvey just stares at him
Fred opens the door to reveal: and  dancing together with the stereo blasting
They're having a ball
: '  - 1980' - At the kitchen table,  looks over ' sketches
and  are now building a house of cards on the living room floor
Here are some ideas we batted around
Sheesh
Joyce doesn't know what she's doing
There's too many words in these frames
When are ya comin' back
Uh, she said something about next Tuesday, which is fine with me
Only thing is,  might have the kid again
My ex-wife's supposed to take her, but  don't have much faith in her showing up
She is in worse shape than me these days
Harvey looks away at Joyce and Danielle playing
They're oblivious to the world
Next week my treatment begins
Do me a favor
Bring the kid with you
: : '  completes a sketch of Joyce pushing Harvey in a wheelchair
The word "cancer" appears everywhere, floating all around the image
/ The following montage chronicles Harvey's illness by cutting between comic art depicting key events and shots of , and  creating the book
The montage is set to the simultaneously dulcet and discordant tone of Miles Davis' "Blue in Green" (or something similar)
: - 1980' - Close on Harvey's face as he's getting pushed down the hall in a wheelchair
: panel of Harvey entering the
machine
: '  - 1980' - We see Harvey, Joyce and Fred sitting around a table
Joyce fights to keep Harvey focused on the project
: 1) An enraged Harvey throws things around the house
2) Joyce on the bed crying, a cat licking her back
: '  - 1980' - balding Harvey depressed in the shower
He holds a clump of hair in his hand
: Harvey in the shower
The balloon above his head reveals his inner turmoil over losing his hair and his face swelling
Harvey in agony
Various positions of him in bed, on all fours, covered with a case of shingles
" feel like 'm on fire" appears over his head
: '  - 1980' - Joyce and Fred go over some more comic art
Joyce carries the idea over to Harvey (wearing a baseball cap), who can't get out of the couch
He looks it over and nods
Danielle brings Harvey a glass of water
: : Harvey crawling up the steps
"'m so weak  can't make it," he thinks
Harvey and Joyce in a hospital waiting room
He's slumped over, she has her hand on him
delirious Harvey surrounded by nurses and Joyce
"She's torturing me, she won't let me die,  wanna die
" : '  - 1980' - balding Harvey lies on his bathroom floor
His cat walks all over him
wanna die
just let me die
: : Joyce attempts to wake Harvey up
She curses at him
She slaps him
"Why are you doing this to me
" drawing of Joyce, doubled over, crying
" can't take this anymore
" ' : '  - 1980' - repeat of the opening scene
Like a ghost, a naked stands over his bed staring down at a sleeping
In the eerie light, he's almost translucent
(faintly) Joyce
Joyce
Joyce springs up, alarmed
What's wrong, Harvey
What are you doing up
Harvey just stands there for a moment saying nothing
What is it
(delirious, out of breath) Tell me the truth
Am  some guy who writes about himself in a comic book
Or am  just -- just a character in that book
Harvey
When  die, will 'dat character keep goin'
Or will he just fade away
Joyce just stares at him, unsure how to answer
Finally Harvey collapses
Joyce leaps from the bed, nervous, hysterical
She gets down on the floor and shakes him
Omigod, Harvey
Harvey, wake up
' His eyes remain closed, his expression far, far away
The sound of Joyce's voice fades until it seems like a distant echo
Then  from Harvey's comics begin to float over his head, his life literally passing before his eyes in comic book form
Slowly, the comic images and the unconscious Harvey evaporate, giving way to: We are now in a large, empty room similar to a blank comic book panel
healthy, fully dressed Harvey appears in the corner of the frame
He is very far away, barely recognizable
We slowly dolly towards him as he delivers a formal soliloquy to the camera: My name is Harvey Pekar
It's an unusual name -- Harvey Pekar
As Harvey speaks, one-dimensional comic book images from his life pass over the screen once again
This time in front of him, behind him, everywhere
We dolly in towards him
1960 was the year  got my first apartment and my first telephone book
Imagine my surprise when looked up my name and saw that, in addition to me, another Harvey Pekar was listed
Images of Harvey's childhood float by, followed by his young adult years
was listed as Harvey
Pekar
My middle name is Lawrence
He was listed as Harvey Pekar -- no middle initial
Therefore, his was a purer listing
We see Harvey age in the images: he's hanging on the street corner with friends, collecting records, hanging with Crumb
Then, in the seventies,  noticed that a third Harvey Pekar was listed in the phone book
This filled me with curiosity
How could there be three people with such an unusual name in the world, let alone in one city
Now, numerous images of Harvey's many years at the
Hospital float by: Harvey filing, Harvey arguing with his boss, Harvey and Toby, etc
Then one day, a person  worked with expressed her sympathy to me concerning what she thought was the death of my father
She pointed out an obituary notice in the newspaper for a man named Harvey Pekar
One of his sons was named Harvey
These were the other Harvey Pekars
The comic images fade out
Harvey is once again alone in the empty room
Six months later, Harvey Pekar Jr
died
Although 'd met neither man, was filled with sadness
"What were they like,"  thought
It seemed that our lives had been linked in some indefinable way
We slowly move in on his face
Extremely close
As close as the camera can get
But the story does not end there
For two years later another Harvey Pekar appeared in the directory
What kind of people are these
Where do they come from, what do they do
What's in a name
'  - 1980' - : We are close on ' face as he lays passed out and delirious on the floor
Over this
Who is Harvey Pekar
His face slowly fades to black
,
- 1980' - : :  , -, -
Scrawled across the top in yellow and red it read, "Our Cancer Year
" The drawing depicts Harvey doubled over on the front lawn, groceries in the snow, with Joyce attempting to help him up
hand flips the book open and signs the inside leaf
and a healthy-looking  sit at a table signing copies of their opus
About fifteen or so people mill about with copies
(
) Here's our man a year later
Somehow made it through the treatments, an' the doctors are optimistic guess Joyce was right about doin' the big comic book
We published the thing as a graphic novel -- our first collaboration -- and ended up with rave reviews
We even won the American Book Award
Go figure
: '   - 1980' - The place is still a mess but somehow it has a better vibe than it had before
This might be due to the presence of She sits crossed legged on the floor making jewelry out of beads
guides her
shuffles into the room
He watches for a moment as Joyce and Danielle play
: There is an awkward expression almost resembling a smile on her face
He interrupts them
Hey Joyce
Joyce looks up
Harvey looks like he's trying to hide something
What is it Harvey
That was the doctor
Joyce stops what she's doing and gulps
She hangs on Harvey's every word
He said 'm all clear
Tears well in Harvey's eyes
Joyce breathes a sigh of relief and Danielle jumps up and runs over to Harvey
She hugs him
: - 1980 - sits in the bleachers, watching  teach to ice skate
Harvey's got a box of pizza next to him
He picks up a slice and chomps on it
The cheese drips out of his mouth onto his shirt
(
) The weirdest thing that came outta my illness was Danielle
With her real mother runnin' around who knows where, an' seein' how well her and Joyce got on, Fred decided she'd have a better life with us
was scared at first but then  thought, what the hell
She's a good kid
So we ended up takin' her an' raising her as our own
: '  - 1980' - and  lie on the futon together
Harvey's comics are strewn around the room everywhere
Danielle flips through one
Ya keep readin' 'em backward
like reading them backward
(holding up a comic) Is that you
keep tellin' ya, all of 'ems me, man
You look like a monster
Yeah, well wait'll ya see what you're gonna look like
Me
Sure
Yer part of the story too, now
What story
The story of my life
Danielle makes a face
Yeah,  know 'm not as interesting as The Little Mermaid and all that magical crap
Maybe  want to write my own comic
Oh yeah
What about
don't know yet
But not about you
You have enough already
: -  -  - walks towards the bus stop to send  to school
He holds her hand
Ya know, you should write about things in your own life
Like school and
ponies
don't know, girl stuff
(to Harvey) Do you have to hold my hand
(wounded) What, are you embarrassed a' me know, 'm embarrassing
felt the same way about my father
Danielle looks up at Harvey like he's crazy
No Harvey
You're just squeezing it too hard
(shaking her head) Joyce is right
You are obsessive compulsive
Danielle drops his hand and rushes onto the bus with other kids
Harvey waves and watches as it pulls away
He turns and walks by himself down the busy Cleveland street -- -- a familiar image from the opening
He's still hunched over
He's still Harvey
(
) Yeah, so  guess comics brought me a lot
But don't think this is some sunny, happy ending
Every day is still a major struggle
Joyce an' fight like crazy, an' she barely works
The kid's got
and is a real handful
My expenses have gone up so much that 'm writin' freelance 'round the clock, just to make my bills
My life is total chaos
: -  -  - -- walks down the same busy Cleveland street towards his job
(
) With a little luck, 'll get a window of good health between retirin' an dyin'
The golden years, right
Who knows
Between my pension and the chunk of change  got for this movie, should be able to swing somethin'
Sure 'll lose the war eventually, but the goal is to win a few skirmishes along the way
Right
: -  - -- slumps at the desk now, flipping through a comic book
comes into the file room, carrying a cake with sparklers
He's followed by a group of Harvey's and  and
Harvey moves the comic off his desk so Toby can put the cake down
The festive cake reads "
" cuts the cake and passes slices to the group
pops a bottle of champagne
on a glass of champagne getting filled
The glass sits next to the comic Harvey was reading
' new edition of   is subtitled, " " It features an illustration of , and  surrounded by cameras, lights and crew
