| | Why is it 'work-in-progress' you might ask
Well for one, this    | | isn't a 100% accurate transcript: some words might be missing,    | | may not be right
Second, some lines may or may not have been     | | spoken by the right character
There are instances in the film    | | where a line is spoken but the character isn't on screen, which   | | makes things complicated
But 'd say this transcript is about    | | 98-99% accurate
Dialogue for each scene is seperated by a line   | | of equal signs (=)
| |                                                                   | | This transcript is open for corrections, additions if you have    | | any
What you ' do, however, is to edit it and take credit    | | for it

Mmm
Wow
Mmm-hmm
Wow
Yes, Marlin
No,  see it
It's beautiful
So, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view, you didn't think that we we're gonna get the whole ocean, did you
Huh
[sighs] Oh yeah
fish can breath out here
Did your man deliver or did he deliver
My man delivered
And it wasn't so easy
Because a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place
You better believe they did--every single one of them
Mm-hmm
You did good
And the neighborhood is awesome
So, you do like it, don't you
No, no
do,  do
really do like it
But Marlin,  know that the drop off is desirable with the great schools and the amazing view and all, but do we really need so much space
Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about
They deserve the best
Look, look, look
They'll wake up, poke their little heads out and they'll see a whale
See, right by their bedroom window
Shhh, you're gonna wake the kids
Oh, right
Right
Aww, look
They're dreaming
We still have to name them
You wanna name all of 'em, right now
All right, we'll name this half Marlin Jr
and then this half Coral Jr
Okay, we're done
like Nemo
Nemo
Well, we'll name one Nemo but 'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr
Just think that in a couple of days, we're gonna be parents
Yeah
What if they don't like me
Marlin
No, really
There's over 400 eggs
Odds are, one of them is bound to like you
What
You remember how we met
Well,  try not to
Well,  remember
'Excuse me, miss, can you check and see if there's a hook in my lip
' Marlin
'Well, you gotta look a little closer because it's wiggling'
Get away
Here he is
Cutie's here
Where did everybody go
[gasps] Coral, get inside the house, Coral
No, Coral, don't
They'll be fine
Just get inside, you, right now
No
Coral

First day of school
[gasps] Nemo, don't move
Don't move
You'll never get out of there yourself

All right, where's the break
You feel a break
No
Sometimes you can't tell 'cause fluid is rushing to the area
Now, any rushing fluids
No
Are you woozy
No
How many stripes do  have

Oh, you're okay
How's the lucky fin
Lucky
Let's see
Are you sure you wanna go to school this year
'Cause there's no problem if you don't
You can wait 5 or 6 years
Come on, dad
It's time for school
Ah-ah-ah
Forgot to brush
Ohh
Do you want this anemone to sting you
Yes
Brush
Okay, 'm done
You missed a spot
Where
There
Ha ha
Right there
And here and here and here
====================================================================================== All right, we're excited
First day of school, here we go
We're ready to learn to get some knowledge
Now, what's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean
It's not safe
That's my boy
So, first we check to see that the coast is clear
We go out and back in
And then we go out, and back in
And then one more time--out and back in
And sometimes, if you wanna do it four times-- Dad
All right
Come on, boy
Dad, maybe while 'm at school, 'll see a shark
highly doubt that
Have you ever met a shark
No, and  don't plan to
How old are sea turtles
Sea turtles
don't know
Sandy Plankton from next door, he said that sea turtles, said that they live to be about a hundred years old
Well, you know what, if  ever meet a sea turtle, 'll ask him
After 'm done talking to the shark, okay
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hold on, hold on, wait to cross
Hold my fin, hold my fin
Dad, you're not gonna freak out like you did at the petting zoo, are you
Hey, that snail was about to charge
Hmm,  wonder where we're supposed to go
Bye, mom
'll pick you up after school
Come on, you guys
Stop it
Give it back
Come on, we'll try over there
Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher
Well, look who's out of the anemone
Yes
Shocking,  know
Marty, right
Marlin
Bob
Ted
Bill
Hey, you're a clownfish
You're funny, right
Hey, tell us a joke
/ Yeah, yeah
Come on, give us a funny one
Well, actually, that's a common misconception
Clownfish are no funnier than any other fish
Aw, come on, clownie
Yeah, do something funny
Yeah
All right,    know one joke
Um, there's a mollusk, see
And he walks up to a sea, well he doesn't walk   up, he swims up
Well, actually the mollusk isn't moving
He's in one place and then the   sea cucumber, well they-- mixed up
There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber
None of them   were walking, so forget that -- Sheldon
Get out of Mr
Johansenn's yard, now
Whoa
All right, you kids
Ooh
Uuh, where'd you go
Where'd you go
Where, where'd you go
Dad, dad

That's where  would play What's wrong with his fin
He looks funny
Ow
Hey, what'd  do
What'd  do
Be nice
It's his first time at school
He was born with it, kids
We call it his lucky fin
Dad
See this tentacle
It's actually shorter than all my other tentacles but you can't really tell
Especially when  twirl them like this
'm H2O-intolerant
[sneezes] 'm obnoxious
[singing] Oooh, let's name the zones, the zones, the zones
Let's name the zones of the open sea
Mr

Come on, Nemo
Whoa, you better stay with me

All the rest are too deep for you and me to see
Huh,  wonder where my class has gone
We're under here
Oh, there you are
Climb aboard, explorers
[singing] Oh, knowledge exploring is oh so lyrical, when you think thoughts that are empirical
Dad, you can go now
Well, hello
Who is this
'm Nemo
Well, Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question
Okay
You live in what kind of home
An anemo-none
nemenem-menome-nememen-nenemone-- Okay, okay, don't hurt yourself
Welcome aboard, explorers
Just so you know, he's got a little fin

Ten, fifteen minutes
Dad, it's time for you to go now
Don't worry
We're gonna stay together as a group
Okay, class, optical orbits up front
And remember, we keep our supraesophogeal ganglion to ourselves
that means you, Jimmy
Aw, man
[singing] Bye, Nemo
Bye, dad
Bye, son
Be safe
Hey, you're doing pretty well for a first timer
Well, you can't hold onto them forever, can you
Yeah,  had a tough time when my oldest went out at the drop off
They just gotta grow up--the drop off
They're going to the drop off
Wh-what are you, insane
Why don't we fry 'em up now and serve them with chips
Hey, Marty
Calm down
Don't tell me to be calm, pony boy
'Pony boy'
You know for a clownfish, he really isn't that funny
Pity
====================================================================================== [singing] Oh, let's name the species, the species, the species

How far can you go
Uh, my dad says it's not safe
Nemo, no
Dad
You were about to swim into open water
No,  wasn't go out--but dad
It was a good thing  was here
If  hadn't showed up,  don't know-- Sir, he wasn't gonna go
Yeah, he was too afraid
No,  wasn't
This does not concern you, kids
And you're lucky  don't tell your parents you were out there
You know you can't swim well
can swim fine, dad, okay
No, it's not okay
You shouldn't be anywhere near here
Okay,  was right
You'll start school in a year or two
No, dad
Just because you're scared of the ocean-- Clearly, you're not ready
And you're not coming back until you are
You think you can do these things but you just can't, Nemo
hate you
There's--nothing to see
Gather, uh, over there
Excuse me, is there anything  can do
am a scientist, sir
Is there any problem
'm sorry
didn't mean to interrupt things
He isn't a good swimmer and it's a little too soon for him to be out here unsupervised
Well,  can assure you, he's quite safe with me
MARLINLook, 'm sure he is
But you have a large class and he can get lost from sight if you're not looking
'm not saying you're not looking-- Oh my gosh
Nemo's swimming out to sea
Nemo
What do you think you're doing
You're gonna get stuck out there and 'll have to get you before another fish does
Get back here

Brother Bloat, proceed
Nemo
Newcomer of orange and white, you have been called forth to the summit of Mount Wannahockaloogie to join with us in the fraternal bonds of tankhood
Huh
We want you in our club, kid
Really
If you are able to swim through
[whispers to Jacques] Turn on the Ring of Fire
The Ring of Fire, you said you could do it--
Bubbles
Bubbles
Let me--oww
// [chanting] Isn't there another way
He's just a boy
[wailing] From this moment on, you will now be known as Sharkbait
// Sharkbait
Ooh ha ha
Welcome, brother Sharkbait
// Sharkbait
Ooh ha ha
Enough with the Sharkbait
Sharkbait
Ooh
ba-ba-doo
Okay, Sharkbait's one of us now, agreed
// Agreed
We can't send him off to his death
Darla's coming in 5 days, so what are we gonna do
'll tell you what we're gonna do: we're gonna get him outta here
We're gonna help him escape
Escape
Really
We're all gonna escape
Gill, please, not another one of your escape plans
Sorry, but they, they just, they never work
24 Yeah
Why should this be any different
'Cause we've got him
Me
You see that filter
Yeah
You're the only one who can get in and out of that thing
What we need you to do is take a pebble inside and jam the gears
You do that and this tank's gonna get filthier and filthier by the minute
Pretty soon, the dentist'll have to clean the tank himself
And when he does, he'll take us out of the tank, put us in the individual baggies, then we roll ourselves down the counter, out of the window, off the awning, into the bushes, across the street and into the harbor
It's foolproof
Who's with me
Aye
Aye
Aye
Aye
think your nuts
/ [sighs] No offense, kid, but, um
you're not the best swimmer
He's fine, he can do this
So Sharkbait, what do you think
Let's do it
====================================================================================== 'm going to

You want me to leave
Well,  mean not

It's just that you know - just can't afford anymore delays and you're one of those fish that cause delays
And sometimes it's a good thing
There's a whole group of fish
They're
'delay fish'
You mean
[whimper]you mean you don't
like me
[sobs] No, of course  like you
It's because  like you  don't wanna be with you
It's a complicated emotion
Oh, don't cry

Well, 'm helping you

====================================================================================== You miss your dad, don't you, Sharkbait
Yeah
Well, you're lucky to have someone out there who's lookin' for you
He's not looking for me
He's scared of the ocean
Peach, any movement
He's had at least four cups of coffee, it's gotta be soon
Keep on him
My first escape, landed on dental tools
was aimin' for the toilet
Toilet
All drains lead to the ocean, kid
Wow

He just grabbed the Reader's Digest
We have 4

That's your cue, Sharkbait
You can do it, kid
Okay, you gotta be quick
Once you get in, you swim down to the bottom of the chamber and 'll talk you through the rest
Okay
Go on, it'll be a piece of kelp
[takes a deep breath] Nicely done
Can you hear me
Yeah
Here comes the pebble
Now, do you see a small opening
Uh-huh
Okay, inside it you'll see a rotating fan
Very carefully, wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it turning
Aaah
Careful, Sharkbait
can't do it
Gill, this isn't a good idea
He'll be fine
Try again
Okay
That's it, Sharkbait
Nice and steady

Heh, uh, dudes

Aw, it's awesome, Jellyman
Little dudes are just eggs, leave 'em on the beach to hatch, then coo-coo-ca-choo, they find their way back to the big 'ol blue
All by themselves

Hold on,  need to breath-- 3 Are you running away
4 Did you really cross the jellyfish forest
35 5 Did they sting you
One at a time
6 Mr
Fish, did you die
Sorry
was a little vague on the details
So where are you going
Well, you see my son was taken
My son was taken away from me
[gasp] No way
What happened
No, no, no, kids
don't wanna talk about it
Awww
Please
Pleeeease
[sighs] Well, okay
live on this reef, a long long way from here
Oh, boy
This is gonna be good,  can tell
And my son,   Nemo, see he was mad at me
And maybe he wouldn't have done it if  hadn't been so tough on   him,  don't know
Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat and when he was out   there, these divers appeared and  tried to stop them but the boat was too fast
So we swam   out in the ocean to follow them
They couldn't stop them
And then Nemo's dad, he swims out to the ocean and they bump into
three ferocious sharks
He scares away the sharks by blowin' them up
Golly, that's amazing
And then dives thousands of
feet straight down into the dark
It's like wicked dark down there, you can see a thing
How's it goin', Bob
And the only thing that they can see down there
is the light from this big horrible creature with razor sharp teeth
Nice parry, old man
And then he has to blast his way
So, these two little fish have been
searching the ocean for days
On the East Australian Current
Which means that he may be on his way here right now
That should put them in Sydney
1 Harbor in a matter of days
mean, it sounds like this guy's gonna stop at
36 2 nothing until he finds his son
sure hope he makes it
3 That's one dedicated father if you ask me
Mine
Mine
Mine
Mine
Mine
Mine
Mine

Mine
Oh, would you just shut up
You're rats with wings
bloke's been lookin' for his boy Nemo
Nemo
He was taken off the reef by divers and this
There, take it

Mine
Hey, hey, hey
Say that again
You said something about Nemo

Whooooooaaa

Last  heard, he's headin' towards the harbor
Ho ho
Brilliant
====================================================================================== [sighs] Is he doing okay
don't know, but whatever you do, don't mention --
It's okay,  know who you're talking about
Gill
Gill
Hey, Sharkbait
'm sorry  couldn't stop the-- No, 'm the one who should be sorry
was so ready to get out, so ready to taste that ocean
was willing to put you in harm's way to get there
Nothing should be worth that
'm sorry  couldn't get you back to your father, kid
All right
Hey, hey, hey, hey--
37 What the
Oooooh
Well, uh, that's one way to pull a tooth
He he he he he
Huh, darn kids
Well, good thing  pulled the right one, eh, prime minister
He he he he
Hey, hey
Psst
Oh, Nigel
You just missed an extraction
Ooh
Has he loosened the periodontal ligament yet--oh, what 'm talkin' about
Nemo
Where's Nemo
gotta speak with him
What
What is it
Your dad's been fighting the entire ocean looking for you
My father
Really
Really
Oh yeah
He's travelled hundreds of miles
He's been battling sharks and jellyfish and all sorts of-- Sharks
That can't be him
Are you sure
What was his name
Some sort of sportfish or something: tuna, uh, trout
Marlin
That's it
Marlin
The little clownfish from the reef
It's my dad
He took on a shark
heard he took on three
// Three
Three sharks
That's gotta be forty eight hundred teeth
You see, kid, after you were taken by diver Dan over there, your dad followed the boat you were on like a maniac
Really
He's swimming and   he's swimming and he's giving it all he's got and then three gigantic sharks capture him   and he blows them up
And then dives thousands of feet and gets chased by a monster with   huge teeth
He ties this demon to a rock and what does he get for a reward
He gets to   battle an entire jellyfish forest
And now he's riding with a bunch of sea turtles on   the East Australian Current and the word is he's headed this way right now, to Sydney
38 Wow
Ha ha ha
Oh, what a good daddy
He was lookin' for you after all, Sharkbait
[gasps] He's swimming to the filter
[gasps] Sharkbait
Not again
Sharkbait
No
You've got your whole life ahead of you
Oh no
We'll help you, kid
Gotta get him out
Gimme that thing
Get him outta there
Come on, kid
Grab the end
[gasps] Sharkbait
Sharkbait
Are you okay
No
Can you hear me, Sharkbait
Nemo
Can you hear me
Yeah,  can hear you
Sharkbait, you did it
Sharkbait, you're--covered with germs
Aaaaaaah
That took guts, kid
39 All right, gang
We have less than 48 hours before Darla gets here
This tank'll get plenty dirty in that time but we have to help it along any way we can
Jacques
Oui
No cleaning
shall resist
Everybody else, be as gross as possible
Think dirty thoughts
We're gonna make this tank so filthy, the dentist'll have to clean it
[belch] Good work
Ha ha ha ha
====================================================================================== All right, we're here, dudes
Get ready
Your exit's comin' up, man
Where
don't see it
Right there
see it
see it
You mean the swirling vortex of terror
That's it, dude
Of course it is
Okay, first: find your exit buddy
Do you have your exit buddy
Yes
Okay, Squirt here will now give you a rundown of proper exiting technique
Good afternoon, we're gonna have a great jump today
Okay, crank a hard cutback as you hit the wall
There's a screaming bottom turn, so watch out
Remember: rip it, roll it and punch it
It's like he's trying to speak to me,  know it
You know, you're really cute
But  don't know what you're saying
Say the first thing again
Okay, Jellyman
Go, go, go, go, go, go
/ Aaaaaaaaaah
Weeeeeeeeeeee
Whoooooooooooaaaaa
Aaaaaaaaaaah
Woohoooo
Whoooooaaa
Whoooo
40 Ha ha ha ha
That was

Hey, look

Most excellent
Now, turn your fishy tails 'round and swim straight on through to Sydney
No worries, man
No worries
Thank you, dude Crush
Bye
Bye, Jellyman
You tell your little dude  said 'hi', okay
See you later, dudes
Bye, everyone
Oh, Nemo would've loved this
Hey, ooh

How old are you
Hundred and fifty, dude
And still young
Rock on
Hundred and fifty
Hundred and fifty,  gotta remember that
Whoa
We goin' in there
Yup
Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney

We're gonna just swim straight
[singing] Just keep swimming, just keep swimming
Dory
====================================================================================== Boy, this is taking a while
Hey, how about we play a game
Okay
Uh, okay
'm thinking of something, uh, orange
And it's small
It's me
Right
Okay
orange, and uh, small
It's me
41 All righty, Mr
Smarty Pants
orange and small, and white stripes
Me
And the next one's just a guess: me
Okay, that's just scary
-w-wait,  have definitely seen this floating speck before
That means we've passed it before and that means we're going in circles and that means we're not going straight
Hey
Hey
We gotta get to the surface, come on
Let's figure it out up there
Let's go
Follow me
Wha--
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey
Relax
Take a deep breath
Now, let's ask somebody for directions
Oh, fine
Who do you wanna ask, the speck
There's nobody here
Well, there has to be someone
It's the ocean, silly, we're not the only two in here
Let's see
okay, no one there
Uhh, nope
Nada
[gasps] There's somebody
Hey
Excuse-- Dory
Dory
Dory
Okay, now it's my turn
'm thinking of something dark and mysterious
It's a fish we don't know
And if we ask it directions, it could ingest us and spit out our bones
What is it with men and asking for directions
Look,  don't wanna play the gender card right now
You wanna play a card
Let's play the 'Let's Not Die' card
You wanna get outta here, don't you
Of course,  do
Well then, how are we gonna do that unless we give it a shot and hope for the best
Hmmm
Hmmmm
Come on, trust me on this
All right
Excuse me
Woohoo
Little fella
Hello
Don't be rude, say 'hi'
Ha
hello
His son Bingo
Nemo
Nemo, was taken to, uh
Sydney
42 Sydney
Yes
And it's really, really important that we get there as fast as we can
So can you help us out
Come on, little fella
Come on
Dory, 'm a little fella
don't think that's a little fella
Oh
Oh, oh, big fella
Big fe--whale
Okay
Maybe he only speaks whale
--
Uh, Dory
what're you doing
-
What're you doing
-
Are you sure you speak whale
-----
Dory
Heaven knows what you're saying
See, he's swimming away
-
He's not coming back
You offended him
Maybe a different dialect
Dory
Dory, this is not whale
You're speaking like
upset stomach
Maybe  should try humpback
No, don't try humpback
Okay, you actually sound sick
Maybe louder, huh
Don't do that
Too much orca
Didn't it sound a little orca-ish
It doesn't sound orca
It sounds like nothing 've ever heard
It's just as well, he might be hungry
Don't worry
Whales don't eat clownfish, they eat krill
43 Swim away
Oh, look
Krill
Move, Dory
Move
Aah-aaah
Aaaaaaaaaah
====================================================================================== Look at that
Would you look at that
Filthy

Huh
That's a funny thing to promise

Well, you can't never let anything happen to him

Not much fun for little Harpo
