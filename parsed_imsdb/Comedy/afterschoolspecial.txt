-  -                     1 As we wind down the crowded hallway in this typical American high school
1A                                                    1A we hear all the sounds of a   , from the unenthusiastic screams of fake ecstasy to the cheesy music
1B
-  -                 1B The sounds echo in the empty hall
Behind the stage a light from an open door
(
) This is unwatchable
It's not even in focus
And geez, look, the boom mike is in the shot
This is really shoddy work
1C
- /    -                 1C The door leads into this room, as we continue on to a displaying a sweaty guy's ugly face
(
) Why do they always show the guy's face
It's like, can't we just assume he's enjoying it
We slowly   from the
(
) Because they're trying to make us feel like we're better looking than that guy, so we should be able to get chicks as hot as her
(
) How the hell do you know
(
) It's a basic rule of porno
Finally, we  our three heroes: , , and
They're watching the porno

- /  -                    2 before school with the sound turned way down, but you can still hear the porno
The three guys are sitting with their book bags on their laps to conceal any possible bonerage

(
) It all started on my seventeenth birthday with our usual morning routine: film appreciation
The school bell  and Deacon clicks off the
Deacon
What are you doing
was watching that
Come on, let's go
We're going to be late
(
) (') And when  say film appreciation,  mean film duplication
Fred steals them, Matt copies them, and  sell them
Matt walks over to the  and presses eject on five 's
The original plus four copies pop out
the original tape: "Ramalot Productions presents Dirty Darla #7," as Matt hands it to Fred and the copies to Deacon
They smile

-  -                    3 The guys are waiting in line for lunch
(
) Fred's the kind of kid who's basically given up on high school
He figures his glory days are way ahead of him
First,  go to Yale, then Harvard law, then when 'm making a hundred grand a year, 'll have a whole stable of hot chicks sitting around topless on my yacht
He smiles ears to ear, looking for approval
(to Deacon) Will that work
(to Fred) You are a complete moron
Deacon and Matt walk off
Fred calls after them
What

-  -                      4 The video monitors up and down the hallways display an image that reads "Fifteen Days Till Midterms
" Fred sees two   walking towards him
(
) Until that big payday, Fred's sex life consists of spanking it
That test was sooo hard
That's too much for Fred to take
He adjusts his pants, turns ninety degrees, and makes a beeline for: 5
'  -                                          5 Fred looks under the stalls to make sure no one's in there, then enters a stall and locks the door
He puts his book bag down, then places a protector on the toilet seat and sits down
He pulls a large wad of toilet paper off the roll
Then, from out of the book bag, Fred pulls a bottle of Moisty-Mate hand lotion
He smiles

-  -                      6 Fred is walking to class when he spots a  , rubbing a stain off of her shirt
Another   grabs her arm
We're going to be late
Are you coming
Fred perks up
7
'  -                                          7 Fred walks into the stall and grabs the toilet protector
(
) Fred averages two to five time a day, depending on how many girls he sees in the hallway
8
-  -                      8 Matt is videotaping the students (including
and Mark) running down the hallway to class
Fred watches
(
) Now Matt-- Matt's what you'd call a late bloomer
Secretary of the Audio Visual Club, amateur filmmaker, and complete dork
4
and Mark grab Matt's camera and film each other flipping him off
Matt grabs it back and the Twins walk away laughing
Fred shakes his head
What are you doing
All great directors start this way
'm documenting the essence of high school
Teenagers running to meet their destiny only to find it's just home room
It's very existential
So's my balls
See you later

-                                 10 Matt trudges into the locker room area, holding a towel to his bloody nose
(
) In the normal course of things, Matt probably wouldn't even have been our friend, but Fred likes having someone to boss around, and  think Matt's actually pretty cool once you get to know him
Just then, the burly '    comes out of the girls' locker room
She walks by Matt without noticing, and the door to the locker room closes slowly
Matt's attention is drawn to it
The door stops with a , a sliver of daylight still visible
Matt shakes his head and starts to walk away towards the boys' locker room
Then, he stops
He's torn
He's still too immature to really be interested, but he thinks he should be
He looks around quickly, then slowly approaches the door
He turns his head sideways, and places it up against the crack
10A   '                                                         10A The proverbial jackpot
Teenage girls changing
Bras
Panties
Towels
10B                                                         10B Matt's eyes widen
And then, they
He quickly scurries away
(';
) Well, at least he's got the key to the / room

-  -                    11 Deacon talks quietly to a
Dirty Darla #7 is a modern classic
This is grade- porn, my friend
Worth a lot more than twenty dollars
Sweet
He hands him the money and Deacon makes the exchange for the tape
The freshman clutches it like gold and scurries away
Deacon heads out down the hallway towards his locker
He sees a gaggle of teenage  gossiping
(
) People always talk about how tough it is being a teenage girl
mean, if  have to watch one more  movie about bulimia or self mutilation or vaginal dryness
Deacon reaches his locker and opens it
He sees some bouncing down the hallway
Deacon takes out some books for class
(';
) (') 'll tell you what's really hard
Being a seventeen year old boy
Imagine what it's like to have only one thing on your mind all day, every day, but to have absolutely no way of getting it
12
-                                         12 a textbook showing the anatomy of the vagina
to reveal Deacon, seemingly staring into space, but really staring at
(
) Testosterone is a drug more powerful than heroin
don't really have any evidence to support that, but the point is, a horny teenage boy will do almost anything for even a glimpse of sex
his  's erect  visible through her conservative bra and blouse
Aside from her flashing headlights, she's the kind of woman you wouldn't notice even if you were alone with her on a two-man luge
But that doesn't matter-- Deacon can't take his eyes off of them
6
(in the background) the increase in the hormone testosterone causes certain physiological changes in the adolescent male
(
) We're suffering
Suffering from a deep, debilitating addiction to something we've never even had
Teenage boys are like time bombs, ready to explode
Two  are whispering
1 Did you hear about Rachael
2 No, what happened
1 John Baldwin nailed her
Deacon bolts upright and spins around, concerned
Are you talking about Rachael Unger
1 Yeah
It was at Richard Rosenblatt's party
In the bathroom
(crushed) You're kidding
13
'  -  ()                        13 , Deacon's girlfriend at the time, is naked under Deacon's sheets after school one day
Deacon from the bathroom and is immediately surprised by her state of undress
Rachael
What are you doing
She sits up and strikes a sexy pose
We've been together for a year now, and thought it was time to take our relationship to the next level
Deacon is becoming very nervous
7
Now
You've been talking about this for months
didn't think you were listening to me
Suddenly, Rachael becomes a little self-conscious
Don't you want to
Of course  do
But, , um
don't have anything
She pulls out a condom
do
But he's still hesitating
(') Deacon, what's the problem
Deacon looks at her waiting there for him, his for the taking
An eternity passes
Then, have a math test tomorrow
14
-  ( )                        14 The Teacher    and Deacon snaps out of it
He turns away from the guys behind him as they continue to describe the John Baldwin incident
(
) " have a math test tomorrow
" The bottom line is,  just couldn't do it
don't know why,  just couldn't
And 've cursed myself every day since then
Deacon is suddenly
15
-  -                    15 very depressed as he trudges to his locker
Which is nothing compared to how he feels when he looks 8
and sees Rachael at her locker, hugging some people good-bye (including a good-looking guy who must be  )
Rachael looks down the hallway towards Deacon, but Deacon ducks away
Now he's even more embittered
16
-   -               16 Fred and Matt are walking towards their bikes after school
Did you videotape it
(sarcastically) Yeah
took my camera to gym class with me
You are the biggest moron  have ever known
Just then, Deacon comes up to them
Hey, guys
Here's the money
He hands out the proceeds from the operation, and Matt notices that Deacon is a little out of sorts
Something wrong
Deacon lets out a deep breath
Yeah
heard Rachael Unger did it with John Baldwin
Well, you had your chance
told you to seal that deal
Shut up, Fabio
don't see you sealing any deals
'm biding my time
Whatever
It just wasn't good timing
9
It doesn't get any better than that
You and Rachael were perfect for each other
And naked girls don't just appear out of thin air
(scoffs) " have a math test tomorrow
" Will you shut up already
(beat) Look, 've been thinking about this all day
We're juniors now
Upperclassmen
So
They reach the bike rack and start unlocking their bikes
So we have a responsibility to ourselves to start having fun and getting girls
This year is our year
(takes the chain off his bike) There's nothing holding us back any more
Over in the parking lot, , a studly senior, revs the engine on his truck
Two hot girls,  and , sit on his bumper, chatting
(') You see
That's exactly what 'm talking about
That could be us
That's not going to be us this year, or next year, or any year, ever
Why not
All we have to do is follow the simple lessons of Tony Montana in "Scar Face
" Ooh
Good movie
(with Cuban accents) "First you get the money, then you get the power, then you get the women
" So, we're going to become Cuban drug lords
10
Listen, the porno pirating operation is bringing in plenty of money
When  get my new car tonight for my birthday, we'll have the power to go wherever we want
Then, there's nothing stopping us from getting the girls
Fred and Matt look at Deacon warily
Is this a plan
Then, the hot girls and Jake drive past the guys
Bye, Sphincter
They laugh, then peel out with the radio blasting
Nothing's going to change, Deacon
You're still going to be the kid who shit his pants in fifth grade and no one will ever let you forget it
had a stomach virus, asshole
Just then, a super hot  drops her car keys and bends over to pick them up
Oh, that's just not fair
Fred adjusts himself
17                                                               17 18
'   -            18 Fred arrives dressed for work (name tag, shirt, etc
) and waves to , the scraggly owner of this small video rental store
Fred passes
, Mark, Wendy, and Kelly and a bunch of other on his way to the back section of the store
Fred makes sure Russ isn't looking and ducks into the porno section
Hurriedly, he pulls out "Half-Cyborg 5: Final Showdown" from his book bag
But inside the case is the tape for "Dirty Darla #7
" He makes the switch
Fred sighs a breath of relief, smiles, and walks out of the adult section
right into
11
Gotcha
Fred
(') 've been watching you
Russ grabs Fred by the shoulders and throws him up against the shelf, shaking him with every word
(') Those movies aren't for little monkey- boys
Aaaaaahhhhhhhh
The Customers stop to stare at the scene
Fred breaks free, and Russ chases after him
Come back here, you bastard
Russ runs after him and  at Fred's legs, knocking him and entire shelf of tapes over
The tape
Fred is still
Russ starts shouting at Fred so that everyone can hear crowd gathers around to watch the spectacle
(') What else you got in here
Russ rips open Fred's bag and pulls out items, looking for more tapes
Fred tries to stop him, but the old man has an iron grip and keeps him away
Fred cringes as Russ exposes porno magazines, kleenex tissues, baby wipes, the bottle of Moisty-Mate Firming Lotion, -tips, women's sexy underwear, surgical gloves
Wendy and Kelly are completely grossed out
(') (totally confused) What's this for
and a Barbie-type  with a pullstring
Russ pulls it
'm Candy
Let's play dress-up
The crowd is now seriously disturbed
Dude

Fred sits there, whimpering on the ground

And  signal exactly two hundred feet before the turn
Rule 108-1
The unimpressed Tester remains expressionless
Great
Now after the right,  want you to parallel park in the open space
Deacon complies
begin the parallel parking maneuver by pulling within three feet of the forward vehicle
now shift into reverse while turning the wheel two revolutions clockwise
The Tester rubs his brow

He passed

'  -                                           22 It's dark, but suddenly the lights come on
Surprise
Deacon pretends to be surprised
Wow
This is great
The room is sparsely populated with a few of Deacon's , his  and , younger brother  (14), and , a wheelchair-bound nerd with a face full of orthodontic headgear and braces
Were you surprised
13
Yeah
Really
Really
was
Happy birthday, Deacon
It's Lois Lane #2
Be careful
It's still in the wrapper
He hands Deacon a comic book, still in the plastic bag
Thanks
23
'  -                                        23 Half-eaten cake and ice cream, unwrapped presents
Matt videotapes the event
Are you ready for the big present
(laying it on thick) You mean there's more
Deacon can hardly contain his excitement
It's in the garage
Come with us
He follows them, looking back knowingly at Fred and Matt
24
'  -  -  ()                   24 The door opens, the lights come on, and Deacon's face drops
No new car
Instead, several large wrapped boxes
Deacon halfheartedly rips open the paper
It's a new computer system
You've been talking about it for months
But his Mom can see his expression
What
That's not what you wanted
No, it is
It's just-- 14
'll take it
Max
We can exchange it if it's not the right one
No,  just thought--  thought you guys were buying me that car  wanted
Max snickers
car
Why do you need a car
You can ask permission to use our car whenever you want, champ
They put their arms around Deacon and smile warmly
Deacon looks over at his parents' Aerostar Minivan
Everyone moves back into the house, except Deacon's parents, who linger
(') told you he didn't want a new computer
Like you know what anyone in this house really wants
25
'  -                                      25 The guys set up the computer
Deacon is really depressed
Now what are we going to do
At least you got this great party
Actually, we were expecting a lot more people
Fred elbows him
(') What
You invited more people
15
Well, we did send out flyers to like three hundred people from school
And no one showed up
did
Deacon looks back at Roger
Great
Uh, guys
No one showed up because they're all at Tom Cooperman's house
He's having a keg party
What
Why didn't  hear about this
That shit's not right
heard it from Rahim
He beamed me the 411 in study hall
beat
Deacon's anger turns to action
Let's go
Why
Yeah
Tom Cooperman kicked me in the balls in third grade, and  swear there is still a footprint on my nutsack
Come on, guys
Can  just get one thing that  ask for on my goddamn birthday
He's got a point
Fine
Watch your balls

'  -   -                              26 Deacon, Fred, and Matt stand on the porch, waiting
The door opens, and we see Coop dancing all the way to the front door
(ad lib) Grommets
Hey, Coop
Can we come in
Coop un-pockets a tiny piece of paper with a thousand names on it
He examines it for a long time
Sorry, son, that dog won't hunt
'all ain't on the list
He goes to close the door
Deacon stops it with his foot
Fred flinches
Coop
It's my birthday today, so cut me some slack, all right
Coop looks him over, then opens the door
(ad lib) Well, pickle my turnips, why didn't you say so
Happy birthday, friend
The guys look at each other, excited
They look back at Roger, five feet behind them at the bottom of the steps
Little help

'  -                                           27 People drinking, dancing, couples making out
Girls everywhere
And over near the keg is
17
(in a trance) Oh, my God
There's Naomi
She looks good
And there's , every teenage boy's fantasy, wearing a hot party dress and drinking a cup of beer
Someone lightly bumps her
her lips as the beer dribbles down her chin, and the world goes still
She playfully wipes the beer off her moistened lips and chin with the back of her hand
She turns her head and her hair floats in the air
are zombies, completely mesmerized by her
She spilled her beer
Yeah
Fred adjusts his pants
Deacon makes a decision
One that he'd normally never make
(') 'm gonna go talk to her
What have  got to lose
Your dignity
She's Rachael's friend
It's not like don't know her
Ask her if she has any unusual hats
Girls like that
Deacon gives Matt a dirty look
Hey, Naomi
Happy Birthday, Deacon
18
(pleasantly surprised) You remembered
Well,  got this flyer and-- Oh, right
So where's Jake
Like  care
(hopeful) So you two aren't going out any more
Duh
Deacon's mind is racing with possibilities when: (
) Freakin
It's Jake, back for another beer
(') Hey, did you hear about Rachael Unger
Before Deacon can answer
(') He shoots, he misses, right, ass- sphincter
Come on, Naomi
We're going in the pool
Screw off
'm talking to Deacon
Whatever
Whatever
Jake gives Deacon a dirty look, nods a "let's go" to
and Mark, and heads out back
(') What an asshole
As soon as Jake is out of sight, Deacon turns back to Naomi, but she's already gone, stranding Deacon

'  -   -                               28 Deacon wanders out back
It's   very dark and there are several people in the pool, including   Jake's good-looking friends, Kelly, Wendy,
, and
It's hard to tell in the dark water, but it looks like they   might not be wearing any clothes
Deacon sees this and   starts to walk away
Deacon
heard it was your birthday
Come on in the pool, man
No, that's okay
No, seriously
It's cool
(come hither) Come on, Deacon
Yeah
Come on
Deacon thinks about it
He takes the metaphorical plunge
All right
He slips off his shoes and takes off his shirt
He walks over to the shallow end
Deacon steps in with his shorts still on
Dude, what are you doing
Take off your clothes
What
We're skinny dipping, Deacon
He hesitates, not sure what to do
Oh
Okay
Sorry, 'll just leave you guys alone then-- --No, come on in
Join us
Wendy swims into
's arms
Her shoulders rise above the water and you can just make out the top of her breast
20
looks at her, thinks it over, and finally
slips off his shorts
He gets into the pool in his underwear, then slips them off, too, and throws them on the side of pool
Wow
This feels amazing
Someone splashes Kelly, she giggles, and the other kids swim around
Kelly swims by Deacon seductively and he smiles
(
) Coop's doing funnels
Come on
It's Jake, by the side of the pool with Deacon's clothes
The other people swim to the front, and get out of the pool
wearing clothes
Even Wendy, in a strapless bra
(rubbing it in) Sorry, dude
Hey, give me back my clothes
Freakin
can't see you
Maybe  need to turn on the
And he does
The backyard lights go on illuminating the scene
Deacon panics
People start looking at him, laughing
Then, the cheesy colored pool lights come on, flashing slowly
Deacon is humiliated
Jake bends down to whisper to Deacon
(') Did you really think Naomi was into you
Deacon doesn't respond
But it's not enough for Jake
He picks up Deacon's underwear with a stick and examines them
(') Oh my God
Skid marks
Aaaahhh, Deacon shit his pants again
No,  didn't
Give them back
Jake does a victory lap around the pool with Deacon's underwear on the stick
Everybody is laughing

'  -   -                                29 Deacon is still in the pool, shivering and shrivelled
Finally, the lights turn off in the back yard, and Deacon ventures out of the pool
He grabs an inflatable elephant pool toy and slips it around his privates
He slowly sneaks around the house

But it's no use

just as the  of a car pull into the driveway
Deacon
He desperately tries to cover himself with the rapidly diminishing toy being jerked away by the dog in a motion that makes it look like Deacon's getting a doggie hummer
gets out of the car
' What the hell kind of sick shit is this

Deacon is visibly bummed
You know how long it's going to take to save up for a car selling porno tapes twenty bucks a pop
Fred looks down
(') What
There's a small problem
22
What
got fired yesterday
Russ caught me and went berserk
Some sort of sting operation he's been planning for months
don't know
You're kidding me, right
Tell me you're kidding
No
And now  have to work twice a week at my dad's office
told you this Scarface plan was stupid
Great
So now we've got no girls, no car, and no money
And no porn
Tony Montana would be very disappointed
Deacon is once again
31
-                                            31 very depressed, as he sits, bored out of his mind in his biology class
Now turn your textbooks to chapter six, the Animal Kingdom
As you should know by now, biology is the study of life, in all its infinite varieties
Deacon continues to stare at her perpetually hard nipples
(') So to keep things a little fun around here, tomorrow we're taking a field trip to the zoo
Deacon buries his head in his hands
32
-   -                   32 Deacon is talking to the Dorky Freshman near the bike rack
23
Is this some kind of extortion racket
'll pay you double if you can get me something today
'm sorry
There's nothing we can do for a while
We don't have anything new
'm dying
just need something
Just then, Naomi walks by on her way to the parking lot
Hey, Naomi
What are you up to
Going home to cram for midterms
With a look, Deacon shoos away the freshman dork
Oh
could help you
mean, if you needed any help
That's okay
'll be all right
Deacon searches for something meaningful to say, desperate not to let the moment pass him by
Naomi cuts him some slack by asking, (') So where did Rachael go off to
She went to Paris with the French Club
(then, taking a chance) We're seeing other people
She laughs at his attempt at being nonchalant
But she's laughing with him, not at him, and Deacon can tell the difference
He relaxes
(
) Hey, sphincter
just as Jake drives up to them
Deacon is starting to really get pissed at Jake ruining the moment with Naomi
Look, can you please stop calling me that
think we're old enough to just let it go
All right
24
Oh, sure
Sorry about that
Shit-pants
He looks at Naomi
(') Hi, Naomi

She turns her back to Jake and his smile fades
He revs the engine and peels out
Deacon jumps out of the way, but his bike is  by the car
Oops
Sorry
He shifts gears and drives over the bike again
He laughs as he drives away
Naomi gives Deacon a pitying look and walks away
The moment is gone
Now Deacon is

But  thought we agreed-- need a car of my own
Well, honey

Witness the miracle of nature at its most primal

Let's make one

movie
Great
That's perfect
've already got an idea for a kind of sci-fi horror thing
It's like "The Shining" meets "The Jetsons
" No, you moron
porno film
Fred lights up
Even better
And check this out
The best part of all, is 've got an angle
27
What kind of angle
We can make pornos that cater to guys like us
You mean virgins
Yes
Adult films made by virgins for virgins
With good cinematography
And cute, nice girls
The kind you'd want to take to dinner with your parents
Right
No shots of sweaty guys' faces
And nothing up the butt
They look at him
(') What
don't like it when they put stuff up their butt
These have to be nicely edited
We should shoot on super 16 and transfer to video
No, Matt
We'll shoot it on your video camera
We're not getting any expensive equipment
How are we going to get the women to star in the film
And the guys
don't know
We'll surf the net
We'll figure it out
They look at each other for a beat
Finally, Fred and Matt crack up
28
(') What
That was really funny
Deacon just looks at them, pissed
'm serious about this
We can't make a porno movie
Do you have any idea how much trouble we'd get in
Do you have any idea how much money we'd make

Like how much
Enough for a car
Enough for more camera shit
To take girls out

For whatever we want
Beat
Beat

They're thinking about it
What about the moral implications
It's a free market transaction between consenting adults
What's the problem
We're not adults
He's got a point, Deacon
Guys, tell me the truth
Haven't you ever wondered
haven't you ever imagined what it would be like to make one
Not really
Deacon turns to Fred, who looks guilty
29
Okay
Sure
've thought about it
've thought about shaving Principal Taggert's ass, too
look, then Deacon gets up to seal the deal
Look
This is an opportunity we shouldn't let slip away
If we make this movie, it could be the best year of our lives
We'll go in boys and come out men
And at the end, we'll have the money, the power, and the women
But you losers would rather play it safe
Well, 'm not going to waste another minute
'm making this porno movie with or without you
And when show up at school in my new set of wheels, and you two limp dicks are begging me for my sloppy seconds, 'll just have to tell you, "Sorry, guys
That ship has sailed
You blew it
" Ringing silence
(sincerely) That was a really good speech, Deacon

That's it
Does that include the sex
Yes, Matt
So how do we get women for this movie
We place an ad in the Cleveland -Press for "body models

Are we supposed to have sex with these women
No, Matt

Okay
In a minute
Fred puts the samples down

Greitzer's signature on file, his credit card number, and his social security number

And we need porno names
What do you mean
It's a basic rule of porno
All people affiliated with the production of an adult film have porno names so their friends don't recognize them
Oh, you mean like "Johnny Hardmember"
Exactly
That's a good one

Ooh,  like it
Guys
Those kind of names are just for the actors

Ashley continues moaning and as Matt gets closer, the camera starts shaking
He can't keep his hands steady
54A    '                                         54A We'd love to get a look, but the camera is shaking so much, it's just a

) Oh
Oh
Oh
Okay,
She turns off her performance like a light switch
What
Did  so something wrong
Matt is quivering
Uh, no
You were great
think 've got what  need there
want to set up for Jake
need a bathroom break
Not now, Fred
Jake
Jake comes out of the bathroom dressed as the yearbook editor
Action
Jake opens a makeshift door to the office
(wooden) Oh, my God
What are you doing
couldn't help myself
Please don't tell the principal
Give me one good reason why  shouldn't
Cut
Perfect
Okay, then
Let's get to the, uh, sexual material
Jake pulls off his pants and starts to look a little nervous
He stands in the corner, trying to psyche himself up
Jake, you okay
Sure
No problem
52
And
But Jake is still standing there, not in the shot
He's starting to sweat
(') Action, Jake
Okay
Still nothing
Come on, Jake
We're filming
All right
Hang on a second
He has his back to them, but it's obvious his bread hasn't risen
Fred lets the boom mike sag a bit
My arm's getting tired
So's his
Action
Jake finally whips off his underwear and faces Ashley
That's it
Hey, it's not hard yet
can see that
Fred snickers and Jake gives him the evil eye
Um, okay
Ashley, maybe you can help him out
She grabs his joint and Jake freezes
He remains motionless, focusing every ounce of mental control on keeping the floodgates closed
Approximately one point three seconds later
Aaaahhhh
53
Wait
'm not set up for that shot
Can  put down the boom
Jake
What's happened
Jake, humiliated, runs to put on his shorts
This has never happened before
She got me too excited
Me
How did you
without even getting hard first
(copping an attitude) What do you want to hear
've got a tiny pee-pee
'm a premature e-jac-u-la-tor
Sometimes before  get a boner
Okay
Calm down, Jake
We can shoot this scene again
Just relax
We can splice it together
We'd have to do it like twenty times to get enough footage
'm out of here
And if you dickwads tell anybody about this, first 'll kill you, and then 'll bust you guys
He pops the videotape out of the camera, takes it, and leaves
Now what
The guys regroup, away from Ashley
The moment of truth: How far are they willing to go
Deacon
You do it
No way
Come on
This is your big chance
54
No
You do it
beat
Fred
What
Come on
You
have to run the camera
Oh, like you're the only one who can do that
(false bravado) Fine
'll do it
'll do it for the sake of the film
Hold this
He hands the camera to Deacon and starts taking off his shirt
The rest of them look at Matt with his shirt off
Matt
Stop it
No, 'll do it
He desperately wants someone to hold him back
(grabs him) Matt
They huddle again, worried about whether to go on with this
(') Look, guys
Maybe we should just pay Ashley and chalk this up to a failed experiment
Fine with me
No
We can get someone else

Who

Deacon, standing a little too close to him
(nonchalant) Good issue

Deacon

Don't you want to get it on with a sexy lady
Matt and Fred are sitting on the curb with some slurpies, bummed
And that guy had real screen presence, too
Just then, Coop pulls up in his van and gets out
Hey, dudes
The guys look at each other
: Moments later, after it's all been explained to Coop

For fixing grades for a girl
Yeah, and the cheerleader is in there and she's going to get grounded if she fails one more test
As they talk, Fred types away

-   -                 64 Deacon and his biology class are getting on a school bus
Nearby, Naomi is crossing the parking lot when she trips and spills her latte on her shirt
People start laughing, but Deacon instinctively rushes over to pick up her books
Are you okay
Yeah
Thanks
'm so embarrassed
She pats at the stain
(genuine) Really
didn't think you got embarrassed about anything
She smiles at Deacon, cheered up by the inadvertent compliment
The Bus  for Deacon
(') Well,  guess  should go
58
He turns to walk away, when Naomi makes a decision to give Deacon a shot
Deacon, wait
Block me for a second while change my shirt
What
Facing the other way
Oh
He turns around and she changes her shirt behind him
Deacon can't help but sneak a peek
haven't seen you around here in a while
Yeah, 'm working on this project at home
Cool
You can turn around now
He turns and sees her new shirt is not yet 100% on
(') Listen
Mark and
are having a party tonight
You want to meet me there
Really
Why not
Okay
Cool
The bus  for Deacon again

-                                             65 Matt and Fred charge forward on their 10-speeds through a park
They slide to a stop, falling off their bikes, but they're too excited to care
65A
-                                                 65A They rush up to Deacon, whose biology class is near the Beluga Whale tank
59
Deacon, come quick
Deacon steps away from his class for a moment
Matt, what's wrong
(
) Like all mammals, the whale gives birth to live young
Can anyone name another characteristic of mammals
Vinnie
Our site got linked by another bigger site
Someone must have seen our stories and liked them
And
We got a few more pre-orders and a ton of hits
How many
Guess
thousand
Twelve thousand
Holy shit
Deacon high-fives the other two
They're all stoked
We need to hurry up and make this movie
We should go over the schedule for tomorrow
And make sure the script is ready
Deacon's smile fades
Uh,  can't tonight guys
Why
Where are you going
60
It's this thing  have to go to
Is it a travelling carnival
No
Look, it's this party Naomi invited me to
Can we come
Fred picks up on Deacon's hesitation
This isn't good
Uh
Okay
guess that's cool
An awkward beat
(') want you guys to come
It's just, don't know
kind of had this vibe from Naomi
(still doesn't get it) We can just meet you there
Yeah
Okay
That's cool
Look, it's at Mark and
Slistak's house
'll see you guys there
've got to get back to class
Later
Deacon walks back to the group
(') What are you wearing to the party
We're not really going to the party, you moron
Why not
Because  said so
Matt starts getting agitated
61
But we told Deacon--  mean, we can't just not show up
What if Deacon is looking for us-- This is too complicated to explain to Matt, so Fred just gives in
All right
All right
Stop crying already
We'll make an appearance
Cool
66
'  -                                         66 Amid this raging party, Deacon has taken his rightful place with the in-crowd, standing dangerously close to Naomi without his usual sidekicks weighing him down
Finally
You know, Rachael's coming back from Paris in a couple of weeks
So
So, aren't you even a little interested in seeing her
No
There's someone else 'd rather see
He looks into her eyes, waiting to see if the limb he's out on is going to break
She smiles
It's working
Just then, Hey, guys
It's his sidekicks and they've got some seriously bad timing
Deacon shoots them an annoyed look
So what's this project you guys are working on
We can't really talk about it
(
) Yeah
It's private
Jake eyes Deacon intently
62
(') Why are you hanging around with this loser
What's your problem, Jake
What's yours
She storms away
Deacon follows her
67
'  -   -                            67 Naomi is out on the patio
What was that all about
He really pisses me off
Jake is such an asshole
Tell me about it
When we were going out, he was so mean to me all the time
think he's compensating for his little dick that never even gets hard
Deacon chokes on his drink
Well at least you were smart enough to dump him
mean, you deserve someone who will treat you
don't know
Really well
You know what you are
Deacon gets a little nervous
(') You're a nice guy
She kisses him on the cheek
Deacon looks at her, then steels himself to make a decision
He kisses her
She's surprised, but not unwilling
(') Deacon
63
've been wanting to do that for a long time
So why didn't you
Most guys would look away at this point, with a fabulous babe with pouty lips staring you down
But Deacon passes the test: he stands his ground and kisses her again
She likes it
, Jake sees them kissing
He doesn't like it
, Fred sees it, too
And for a completely different reason, he doesn't like it either
68
-                                             68 The set is finally ready: Ashley is lying on the bed in a robe, the lights and camera are set, and Matt and Fred are adjusting the video camera
The only thing missing is an actor
Deacon
Hey, where's Coop
He was supposed to be here a half hour ago
Maybe he got sucked into a black hole
He chuckles to himself
Good one, Spock
can't understand why you're not more popular with the ladies
Look, we're wasting time
Deacon, why don't you just go in there
Deacon balks at first, then looks over at Ashley, lying there
(') Come on
Okay
Okay
All right already
He pulls off his shirt and approaches Ashley with a pizza box from out of nowhere
And action
64
Matt starts filming while Ashley pulls Deacon near her
(
) Maybe  can pay for the pizza some other way
We hear Deacon's  opening offscreen as Deacon rolls his eyes and reluctantly delivers his line: And maybe  could throw in the sausage for free
Deacon shows no enthusiasm for what's happening down below
Fred, you get in there, too
Are you sure
Yeah, it'll be a great shot
Fred takes off his shorts and walks over to the other side of the bed
Ashley is offscreen, presumably lying on the bed
The two guys are facing each other
Hey
'up
How's it going
Deacon shrugs
(') Hey, did you see that show on Sci Fi about sun spots
Yeah
They said there's going to be a massive eruption next year
Fred starts laughing
(') What
You said "massive eruption
" Deacon starts laughing, too
65
Hey, quit the chatter
Sorry
Hey, why don't you guys kiss
What
You know
Make out with each other
What
All right
Fred goes in to kiss Deacon, who's thoroughly confused
Deacon holds him back with his hand
Wait
Why do you want us to kiss
(
) Because that's what guys do in gay porn
What
Deacon looks over at the camera
It's Ashley filming
He slowly looks down at the person he and Fred are having sex with
He can barely look
It's Matt
More sausage please
Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh
: 69
'  -                                    69 Deacon bolts up out of bed
Nightmare
Thank God
70
" " -                       70 Deacon enters and the scene looks very much like the dream: Ashley on the bed and Matt and Fred waiting around
66
The set is made up to look like a movie theater, complete with rows of seats, a bed sheet "screen," and a massive 5,000 watt light
Deacon is still a little agitated
Where the hell is Coop
There's no way 'm making out with Fred
Then Coop comes out of the bathroom and sees everyone staring at Deacon
What's going on
Deacon is talking about making out with Fred
No way
'm holding the mike and that's it
thought we were doing straight porn
If you guys want to do gay porn, you still have to pay me
Hang on
Relax
It was just this stupid dream  had
You dreamed about making out with Fred
No
Well, yes
And we were both having sex with you
But it was just a dream so let's forget it
Everyone is a little uneasy at this admission
Deacon quickly changes the subject
(') What's with the light
It's a "special effect
" If you want this film to look amateurish, you're going to have to get someone else to do it
Okay
Relax
Come on
Let's do it already
67
Action
Matt starts his cheesy "projector light effect" and Coop takes a seat next to Ashley
This summer tent-pole event-movie is making me so scared
Hide your head down here and 'll tell you when it's safe to come up
As she starts to go down, we turn our attention
and , away from the action
(snide; whispers) How's Naomi
Fine
(
) Not yet
This is the really scary part
(whispers) Hey
Can  ask you a question
Fred shrugs
The memory of the nightmare is wreaking havoc with Deacon's conscience
(') Do you ever think maybe we've gotten ourselves in a little over our heads with all of this
(
) Oh, baby
Not yet
Fred appears to be pondering the question deeply
His face slowly contorts to a look of seeming anguish
Then, Fire
The coiled cord to the massive light is burning a circular hole in the smouldering carpet
Unplug the light
Deacon moves to unplug it
68
Wait, it's hot
Too late
Deacon touches the cord, , and reels back, knocking the light over
It  onto the floor
The carpet bursts into
Run
Ashley and Coop run up the stairs
Fred isn't far behind
Quick, get the fire extinguisher
Where is it
Over there
He spots it in the corner and grabs it
Meanwhile the flames are growing
Deacon comes over and aims the extinguisher at the flames
He depresses the lever
Nothing
It's not working
Matt thinks about it for a second
Oh
Me and Fred used it when we wrote the foamy cat fight script last week
71
'  -                                          71 Matt and Fred are giggling and prancing around the room in bikinis discharging the fire extinguishers at each other
72
-                                              72 Deacon looks at him strangely for a beat, then runs into the 72A
-   -  ()                    72A He looks around frantically
Nothing
Then, he starts the It slowly starts to fill up
(
) Hurry
Deacon turns the dial to "large load," pauses and chuckles to himself
69
Large load
(
) Deacon
Hurry
Deacon snaps out of it and grabs the laundry detergent bottle
He scoops up some water and  into the other room
72B
-  ()                               72B He throws the soapy water onto the fire and Matt
The fire goes out, but Matt's not too happy about getting soaked
73
'  -  -  ()                    73 Coop is looking down the stairs to the basement
Fred is freaking out
Ashley is still topless but covering herself up, having just put on her panties
She goes to put on her shirt when (
) What's going on here
' are standing in the doorway to the kitchen with Max, whose arm is in a splint
Max stares at Ashley
She covers herself some more
Then, Deacon and Matt enter the kitchen from downstairs
Nice rack
Mom
Dad
What are you doing home
Max sprained his wrist at soccer practice
What is going on here
Well, 'm sure there's a reasonable explanation why there's a naked girl in our kitchen
Right, Deacon
Deacon isn't too sure
Well
, uh
Deacon's mind is racing
Then, 70
'm Deacon's girlfriend
Ashley
* His girlfriend
His girlfriend
* Yes, my girlfriend
And what were you doing with your clothes off in my kitchen
We were having a make out party
Where are the other girls
Their dates stood them up
Yeah
My date wasn't feeling well
Mine has mono
From too much making out
With me
What's that smell
We had a small fire, Mrs
Lewis
tipped over a candle
It was to set the right mood
fire
Let me see the damage
Dad, don't
Let me take responsibility
We'll pay to have it fixed
Deacon's Dad looks at Ashley again
He can't hide his pride
Damn right you will
Well, Ashley
didn't know Deacon even had a girlfriend
Maybe you can join us for dinner tonight
Ashley looks at Deacon
Deacon's Mom glares at Dad
71
think Ashley's busy tonight-- Okay
Oh, shit
Okay, then
74
'  -  -                            74 Ashley is eating dinner with the Lewises
Max keeps staring at her
Mr
Lewis steals a few glances of Ashley himself while continuing his work-related rant
So get this
Johnson comes up to me today and he's all like "where's the -90's
" 'm like, "Johnson, they discontinued the -90 like six weeks ago
" 've been telling this guy
Johnson sounds like a moron
Exactly
Mr
Lewis is psyched that someone is finally paying attention to him
Mrs
Lewis doesn't like the way he's looking at her
So, Ashley
If  could ask you a personal question, exactly how old are you
Nineteen
But  tell people eighteen
Deacon laughs nervously
Isn't that funny
The doorbell rings
(') 'll get it
Deacon open the door
It's Naomi
What are you doing here
72
thought 'd come by and surprise you
Maybe we could hang out in your bedroom
She looks at him seductively
Deacon looks over his shoulder
Now's not a good time
What's wrong
Nothing
Let's talk later
He tries to close the door, but she stops it
(
) Deacon, who is it
Too late
Naomi comes in
Hi, Mrs
Lewis
'm Naomi
'm Deacon's girlfriend
And with that she looks at Deacon, figuring she just made his day
It fails, however, to achieve the desired effect
His girlfriend
She looks at Deacon
Max pokes his head through
Deacon has two girlfriends
Shut up, Max
What do you mean
What's going on
Deacon's other girlfriend is having dinner with us
can explain
Naomi walks into the kitchen with Max
This is Deacon's other girlfriend, Ashley
73
His other girlfriend
Dad's beaming with pride
The two girls size each other up
Hi
Oh, my God
How old are you, you slut
Eighteen
thought you were a nice guy
Naomi storms out of the house
Deacon follows, then Ashley
You need to have a talk with him
He could be having --
need to give him a goddamn medal
(she storms off) What
Deacon watches Naomi go
Ashley consoles him
Let her go
Are you insane
've been fantasizing about Naomi Feldman since the seventh grade
Fantasy and reality are two different things, Deacon
Don't fall in love with who you think she is
You have to be sure you love the real person
So what should  do
Go after her then
Or don't
Whatever
He looks at Ashley for a beat, then goes after Naomi
75
-                                              75 Naomi and Deacon are arguing under a street light
74
She's a porno actress in your porno film
She had to pretend to be your girlfriend because she ran upstairs naked when the light caused a fire
And you've never had sex with her or even kissed her
Yeah, pretty much
He looks down
(') So,  guess this means you're not my girlfriend anymore
Not necessarily
She looks at him with newfound interest
(') want to come to the set tomorrow
No,  don't think that's a good idea
Why not
'm curious
've never seen a porno movie actually being made
Matt and Fred will get really mad
We're not supposed to tell anyone
Tell them 'm a
creative consultant
For the female point of view
No offense, but the female point of view doesn't really matter in these films

Okay

This After School Special shit is amazing
They're getting a ton of hits off their stupid stories and they don't even have any product
Are you sure those are the guys from the Pretty Kitty
It's the same guys
Bingo
just found out where they live

Oh, yeah

Greitzer
Yes
That's right
Then, a spark of understanding
Oh,  get it
Brilliant
You're not even a fuckin' kid
Mike pulls the gun out and puts it to Greitzer's head
Greitzer drops his glass of soda, raises his hands, and starts shaking, terrified
What are you doing
What am  doing
'm retiring you from the porno business
Permanently
Understand
Yes
Yes
Please don't hurt me
No more sweet young pussy, no more hot school-girl fantasies, no more goddamn pornos "for virgins by virgins

Greitzer's eyes dart over to the side, and for the first time, Vic steps into the house and sees:
It's Greitzer's little daughter's birthday party
Six-year- old  and their stunned  all stare at Vic
Greitzer's wife comes over, screaming and crying
' Please don't hurt my husband
Uh

Didn't you see that Beatles documentary on the History Channel
You're pulling a Yoko Ono on us
What
Fine
Whatever
Let's get started
'm sure she'll be really helpful
Coop comes out of the bathroom dressed as the Math Team Captain, complete with nerd glasses, pocket protector, etc
Oh, hey, Naomi
Hey, Coop
Are you helping these guys, too
(sheepishly) Sort of
Okay, people
Places everybody
Let's try to do this with a little heart, okay
And action
Everyone turns to their scripts and starts the rehearsal
This quadratic equation is so hard
Well, maybe we should just stick to long division
Coop drops his corduroys and Naomi gasps
She stares at Coop's "slide rule" for a beat, then snaps out of it
Wait a second
Cut
This is all wrong
She wouldn't be fantasizing about some geek
79
He's not a geek
He's the Math Team Captain
No, he should be really well-dressed, and maybe he's a foreign exchange student from Portugal
Um, and the director is the only one who's allowed to say "cut
" Who cares, Naomi
Deacon agrees with me, don't you
Matt and Fred look at Deacon
Dudes, come on
My nuts are getting cold
'm out of here
Shut up, Coop
This is important
(swings his arms out) And my nuts aren't
Coop's hand accidentally smacks Ashley in the nose as she's getting up
She
Are you okay
'm sorry, Ashley
She's pissed, holding her nose
Look
This is ridiculous
Who does dress rehearsals for a porno shoot
Oh, sure
Why don't we throw out the script while we're at it and "improvise
" 80
Guys,  appreciate the money
It's nice to get paid for sitting around doing nothing, but this isn't helping my career
've got no footage for my reel
She packs up
Where are you going
Sorry
She leaves
Ashley, wait
'm sorry
Ashley
Then, he blurts out something unexpected: (') (calling after her) love you
Coop exchanges an awkward glance with the guys: he's said too much
He goes after Ashley, with his pants still around his ankles and his bare ass in full display
He stumbles on his pants and falls on his face
He gets up quickly and continues after her, still with his pants down
Now what are we going to do
Your "girlfriend" ruined everything
Coop's the one that smacked her
Besides, if you losers knew anything about women, we wouldn't have this problem
Who asked you
don't have to take this
She storms off, leaving Deacon there to make a decision
He looks at Matt and Fred for a beat, then follows Naomi
Fred and Matt are crushed
80
-                                 80 Ashley is walking through the parking lot on the way to work
81
(
) Ashley
It's Deacon's Mom, in the adjacent lot
She walks over to her
Mrs
Lewis
What are you doing here
, um, 'm
'm going where you're going
To yoga class
Yes
Exactly
haven't seen you in class before
It's my first time
Well, that's great, Ashley
You're really going to love it
She escorts her towards the yoga class building
(') It's really easy, but if you can't keep up, just follow my lead
: 81
-                                               81 The entire class of slackjawed -  yoga students stare in disbelief
Even the instructor is amazed
is essentially folded in half, her legs pinned well beyond her ears
She's obviously been in this position before
82
-                                             82 The women are gathering their things after class, some still eyeing Ashley jealously
82
You're quite flexible, Ashley
Yeah, people tell me that all the time
You know,  could teach you some of those moves
Mr
Lewis would love it
Oh
Okay
Maybe later
Listen, Ashley want to ask you something
personal
About you and Deacon
Uh huh
You know Deacon is only seventeen
Uh huh
Right
So  was just wondering
You know
If you and Deacon
Well, if Deacon and you were
Um, no
Good
Good
That's very good
She gives Ashley a warm little hug
Listen, Mrs
Lewis
You don't have to worry about Deacon
He's a good kid
If you just let him make his own mistakes in life, he's going to turn out fine
83
'  -                                 83 Deacon and Naomi are under the covers, making out
So, do you have anything
Like what
You know
Protection
Oh
Oh yeah
Of course
83
She sees he's nervous
Don't you want to
Of course  do
Then what's the problem
Deacon looks at her waiting there for him, his for the taking
long beat
Then, It's my first time
That's okay
Just go slow
And he does
He's nervous at first, not sure what to do
But as she kisses him softly, suddenly we start to hear the slow fade in of   playing in Deacon's head
(Now that Deacon's actually having sex, it's involunarily triggering the only thing he knows about sex: porno movies
) The music grows louder when: (
) (in Deacon's head) Every two minutes, they change positions
He pauses, and cocks his head in confusion
He tries to shake Fred's voice out of his head, but he can't
(
) (') It's a basic rule of porno
Finally, he gives in to the porno music
He rolls Naomi on top of him
: They're doing it standing up against the door
(
) (') The door
Always a classic
: Deacon sweeps away all the stuff from her desk and lifts her up on it
Naomi likes it
(
) Fantasy and reality are two different things
: 84
Naomi's  presses up against the window
It slowly falls to the ground
(
) It's a basic rule of porno
: Back on the bed, Naomi is in a state of complete bliss, having had her first ever orgasm
(
) Fantasy and reality are two different things
But Deacon doesn't share Naomi's contentment
He looks troubled
83A
-  -                      83A The next night, Deacon is talking to Ashley backstage as she's getting ready to go on
don't know
It was weird
Is it supposed to be so weird
Of course it was weird
True love can only exist between two women
Deacon is stunned
(') Just kidding
don't know, Deacon
Do you like this girl
He hesitates a bit too long
Of course  do
Your heart is telling you that you don't
And  think it's time you start listening to your heart
Deacon still doesn't get it
(') Look
have to go on
Just do whatever you want
Or don't
Whatever
85
84
'  -                                             84 Vic and Mike wait at the counter for his video copies of volume 28
(cameo for the director, ) comes to the counter with a box
Thanks, Dave
Vic
He turns to leave just as another  (cameo for the writer, ) comes up to Dave with a pad of paper
Hey, Dave, there's a guy on the phone who wants to set up a new account
What's it for
Some outfit called After School Special
They turn back
What did you just say
Nothing
It's for another customer
Mike grabs him by the collar and pulls him over to Vic
Did you say "After School Special"
Mike grabs the paper, drops the guy, and he and Vic rush out of the store
After they're gone: Shit, man
You must be crazy
(calling after them) Better watch your back, homie
You might get smoked
85
&  -                                        85 Naomi is dragging Deacon into the store featuring posters of buff male models with nut-hugging boxer briefs
What are we doing here
86
What
thought you might want some new clothes
don't need any new clothes
And guess what
booked facials for us at the Serenity Spa
Naomi
Wait
Stop
He stops her
What's wrong
have to meet up with Matt and Fred this afternoon
already blew them off yesterday
Deacon, you don't have to hang out with those guys any more
Besides, you really need a facial
And  mean,  thought we could spend the day together
You know, after last night
But what about Matt and Fred
Well what about me
She pouts
She has him under her thumb
He takes her hand and continues into the store
86
-                                          86 Deacon walks in really late, but wearing a hot new Peachtree & Finch outfit
And his skin seems to glow
Matt and Fred glare at him from the far end of the couch
What's going on
Are we going to find another girl
(off their look) What
Matt and  have been talking
Yeah
About what
87
We want to make this movie
know
do, too
No, Deacon
We want to make the movie we wrote
We want to make it without you
Okay
know what this is about, guys
'm sorry about Naomi
That's not the problem, Deacon
Then what is it
thought this was about us having fun and doing something crazy together
But as soon as you got what you wanted, you blew us off
You don't understand
Fred cuts to the chase
Do you even like her
Deacon is about to tell them
Then, Fine
Go ahead without me
Fine
Matt and Fred get up and leave
86A                                                       86A 86B                                                       86B 86C                                                       86C 86D                                                       86D 86E                                                       86E 88

Deacon feels like shit
So, Deacon
How'd you think you did on your midterms
Fine
found a dead bird on the soccer field
Its head was missing
Deacon's Dad pushes away his plate and gets up
have to go back to the office tonight
Johnson screwed the pooch again
Whatever

'  -  -                                 88 Deacon's Dad gets into the Aerostar
He turns on the radio, which blasts a
He quickly changes it back to an 88A
-                                            88A He pulls in to the lot and parks

It's

Ash, you ready
You're up now

90B 90C   '  takes a seat right up front
90C (
) they work hard for their money, guys, so let's tip them good
All right
Now, on the main carousel, let's give it up for the naughty school girl
Applause
Ashley struts out through the cloud of stage , right up to Deacon's Dad
who's turned around, ordering a drink
He turns back to see
Ashley's back, as she swings around the pole
She struts by each of the men in the front row, reaching down to take dollar bills out of their hands
She walks over to Deacon's Dad
but he's tipping the waitress
She does another spin around the pole
and lands in a split, face to face with
Deacon's Dad, who happens to have a crisp dollar bill between his teeth
They immediately recognize each other and
long beat
Then: Hello, naughty school girl whom 've never met before
You, too, are someone whose kitchen 've never been in
Another beat, then she grabs the bill out of his teeth, and quickly moves away
91
'  -   -                      91 Dad walks upstairs, still a little stunned
You get everything done at work
Yeah
All set
Oh, guess who  ran into
Deacon's girlfriend, Ashley
90
Dad freezes
Where did you see Ashley
Over on Industrial Way
You were on Industrial
You know, she is so flexible
It's really amazing some of the positions that girl can twist herself into
What
She even offered to teach me
So  could move like that
Yeah, that would be great
mean, if you're into that
Maybe
like her
know she's a little older, but  think she's good for Deacon
You do
Just then, Deacon walks past them down the hallway towards his bedroom
Dad eyes him with a rare combination of fatherly concern and male jealously
92
'  -                                    92 Deacon walks past his desk and something catches his eye
He stops to look at a picture of himself with Fred and Matt from fifth grade
He looks really happy in the picture
Then, he sees a strip of photo booth pictures taken yesterday with Naomi
She's hamming it up for the camera, but you can tell from his expression, they don't belong together
He tosses the Naomi picture onto the desk
93
'  -   -                          93 Deacon stands by the water skipping rocks with Matt and Fred
So, what did you want to talk to us about
91
wanted to say 'm sorry
For what
For blowing you guys off
That's okay, Deacon
No, it's not
It's just sometimes  feel like the whole world is passing us by and we're just sitting still
don't know
Anyway, 'm sorry
You know, you can be a real dick sometimes
Then, Fred smiles
Deacon knows they're cool with each other
Naomi and  did it the other night
No way
You're kidding, right
No, it's true
How was it
Good
At first
But then  kept   thinking about   all the pornos
Trying to   hit the right   spots, positions
don't   know
After   a while it kind of seemed   like work
find that extremely difficult to believe
Deacon laughs
So what now
Do we make this thing
92
don't know
Maybe we should just call it quits
(
) Hey, guys
Ashley walks up to them
She looks hotter than ever, in a tiny midriff shirt and short shorts
What are you doing here
need you
What
need you to make this movie
For my reel
Well, actually we were-- Ooh, look
An eyelash
For the third time, time stands still as Ashley gently pulls the errant eyelash from Deacon's eye and offers it up to him
(') Make a wish
Deacon is too entranced to close his eyes, but he does take the opportunity to blow the eyelash off her hand
She smiles and brushes back a strand of hair from his brow
The guys are hooked
Up through the window, over on Deacon's computer, the
Website is running, featuring Roger's smiling face with the motto, "By Virgins, For Virgins
" The counter is on fire
94
-                                             94 Roger is getting his hair cut by a cute , his wheelchair next to him
few other women are in the back, whispering and looking over at Roger
An   plays on the radio
So, 'm thinking about getting into films
93
Okay
You have any tips on how to break in
Uh, no
Not really
Acting classes, guess
Really
didn't think there was a lot of acting in those films
Roger is confused
Well,  guess it kind of depends
You think you could get me an audition
For what
Come on
How long have  been cutting your hair
Since  was like eight
(whispers) know who you are
Don't worry
Your secret's safe
Come on
just want to make one film to see what it's like
Roger is still totally clueless
That's great
But how can  help you
Oh,  get it
You help me,  have to help you
That's how it works
Okay
She looks around
Then, she sprays a big dollop of hair mousse into one hand and places it under the hair apron
Roger panics
(') Relax
What're you-- Oh, God
94
His face contorts to match the aria playing on the radio, making it look like he's singing the soprano solo

" " -                               95 Coop and Ashley have brought some help: Plantain and the Bouncer
They're waiting around for the guys
The room is their most elaborate set so far, a hotel ball room, complete with themed prom banner, dance floor, stage, etc
No, no, it's a municipal bond fund
But what about the capital gains
Sure there's short term capital gains, but the dividends are tax free
State and federal
Deacon enters with Matt and Fred
Hey, guys
hope you don't mind, Plantain and Baxter want to be in the movie, too
Hey
Mr
Runningbear
Matt smiles meekly as we : : 95A
-                                            95A Moments later, cheesy prom  plays and a mirrored disco ball reflects light across the dance floor
As the couple dances across the floor, dressed in a prom gown and tux, Ashley looks into Coop's eyes
Ira,  have something important to tell you
What is it
This prom is making me so hot
'm ready to lose my virginity to you tonight
95
Coop gives the thumbs up to the Bouncer, also dressed in a tux, then starts making out with Ashley in an exaggerated tongue-lapping display
, Matt peeks out and looks at the other two guys with a furled brow
Deacon gives him a forced thumbs up

You're the best

Ashley says, "You're the sexiest teacher ever had
" The guys turn their heads sideways to figure out the bizarre position Ashley and Plantain have gotten themselves into

Matt calls "Okay, people
Places
Let's get it together
" Plantain puts the cigarette out on her heel, hides the tuna fish sandwich in her purse, and sprays the air with Weylon
Petunia's
My dress is ruined
'm so sorry, Miss Jorgensen
What are we going to do
She rips off her dress in one big swoop, revealing sexy underwear

Through the door: (
) never knew chaperoning the prom could be so "hard
" Fred gives up and throws the lotion back in his book bag
When he exits the bathroom, everyone is staring in his direction, then quickly looks away nonchalantly

Fred lowers the boom and it smacks the Bouncer in the head
Deacon applauds, trying to rally the troops, "Good scene
Good scene

One more time, same result
Suddenly Coop lets out a huge  and everyone starts laughing
Matt throws his hands up, frustrated

Hi, how are you
Good
Good
How was France
It was so fun
We just got back yesterday
The school totally screwed up my class schedule

Deacon looks her over
So, how's John Baldwin
Rachael goes white
Who told you about that
Everybody knows
Well everybody is a liar
never did it with John Baldwin
Deacon is stunned
You didn't
Jesus, Deacon
don't even know him
It's not like it was with us
It hits Deacon like a ton of bricks
97
- /  -                   97 Deacon and Fred enter and see Matt sitting by the computer
So
How does it look
It looks great
It's the best porno film 've ever made
So what's the problem
Are you done with it
Well,  cut together some footage to give to Ashley for her reel, but  don't think can finish this film
Why not
98
can't even watch it
Every time  turn it on,  keep thinking about that tuna fish sandwich and Coop farting all day long
That was pretty gross
That's just it
The movie looks great, but seeing everything else -- all the disgusting, nasty stuff -- that's what's taken all the fun out of it
And  just don't want to do it any more
Great
knew it
knew you couldn't handle this
Matt looks away
Take it easy, Fred
No,  knew that when it came down to it, Matt would wuss out
Matt snaps
You know what
Fuck you, Fred
You're the wuss here
At least  don't have to whack off every time  see a girl in the hallway
Fred shoves Matt
Shut up, Matt
Matt stands up and gets in Fred's face
No, you shut up
For once in your life, be a man and admit this movie was a mistake
Why don't you make me
The two square off, staring each other down
Until, No
Matt's right
This movie was a mistake
99
What are you talking about
This whole thing was your idea
Come on, Fred
Didn't you think this movie was going to be
don't know, sexy
Fred looks at the other two for a beat, not sure what to say
Finally, he smiles
How long have you guys known about the bathroom thing
Deacon laughs
If you didn't like making the movie, why didn't you say something
don't know
thought you guys were having fun
didn't want to be the wuss

The Aerostar's not so bad
What about the money and the power and the women

Hey, guys
Great party
Thanks

Vinnie says we need more ice
Hang on, guys

Hey, Ashley
Can  ask you a question
Sure
Do you think me and Matt will ever get girlfriends
Are you kidding
Come on, guys
You have it made
You're smart, funny, fun to be with
In a couple of years, girls will be dying to meet men like you
Really
Well, no
Popular, good looking guys always get the girls

can't believe these losers are having such a killer party
Coop is walking by and overhears the comment
Hey, you're not on the list, dude
What's with you, you pussy
Are you joining the retard team, too
Just then, Plantain enters and walks to the front of the line
The high school guys stop everything to stare at her
Coop
Plantain
Plantain kisses him, while nonchalantly grabbing his crotch
Come on
You don't need to wait in this line
Deacon and the guys are already inside
Coop puts his arms around her and walks away, not without looking back over his shoulder for a second at
standing there, dumbfounded
Then, the Bouncer escorts
away

Ashley stops
Let me tell you something about Deacon
That boy is amazing in bed

And you are
Ashley
Deacon's ex
Seriously
Seriously
Have your boyfriends ever given you an orgasm
No
think so
(off Ashley's look) No
Have you ever felt so completely satisfied in bed that you just wanted to sleep for a week
No
You're wasting your time giving those Neanderthals blowjobs
mean, they'll probably wind up unemployed wife beaters anyway
So, are Deacon's friends seeing anybody
Matt and Fred
don't think so
But if you're interested, you better move fast
Those guys know how to do this thing
She whispers something to Wendy and Kelly
They look shocked
Ashley walks off

Good,  guess
103
thought she was your fantasy girl
Yeah
She was
You're gonna dump her
don't want to

It's not like it was when  was with Rachael
Rachael and  used to talk about stuff
We just,  don't know, connected
Very good, Deacon
Deacon is confused
What do you mean
Oh, nothing
guess 'm just glad that you finally figured it out
moment of realization
Yeah,  guess  did
(beat) So  have to do this, don't
(joking this time) guess
Or not
Whatever
Deacon smiles
He finally understands that Ashley really does care about him
Ashley kisses him on the cheek and exits off into the horizon

There's something  want to talk to you about
What
've been thinking
Maybe we should see other people
104
What
Well,  mean, we don't really have anything in common
And we don't really even get along
You're breaking up with me
(beat) Can we still have sex
Listen to what 'm saying, Naomi
The only reason  went out with you was because  thought you were a nice guy
And now you're breaking up with me
Yeah
guess so
If you tell anybody about this
have a reputation
won't
You can tell people you dumped me if you want
Really
Sure
What do  care
You see
You are a nice guy
She kisses him on the cheek
Just don't tell anyone about the movies
All right
She smiles
(
) These guys are pornographers
It's Jake, on the bandstand with the mike
He's drunk
(') They're perverts
They make porno movies in their basement
105
But no one is paying any attention
No one's listening to you, Jake
Give it a rest
Jake gets down to confront the guys
Oh, really, skidmarks
know someone who will believe me
Your parents
The web site is in someone else's name
All our records are encrypted
There's no tracing it to us, jerk off
Oh, really
Well, good thing  took the tape of Ashley masturbating in your basement
When they see that, they'll see what kind of movies their perfect little Deacon is making
Did you make a copy of it
No
You sent the original tape to my parents
Yup
You know, Jake, you're a real dick
She punches him in the stomach
He doubles over and she uppercuts him
He flies backwards, crashing through a table
Jesus
You should probably avoid pissing her off

We've got a problem

Hey, Fred
