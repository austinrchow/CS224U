One, two, three mechanical kisses, counting toward seven o'clock

Meanwhile, little    float off the rooftop where a little   cranks her fog machine
The front door of the house pops open, and a appears and begins sweeping

Even at this early hour, he puffs on his trademark cigar
Gomez is all enthusiasm or all despair
At the moment, he radiates unfathomable woe
Think of it, Thing
He's been gone for twenty-five years
For twenty- five years we've attempted to contact Fester in the great beyond
The room is a dusty, cobweb-filled, long-unoccupied shrine to Gomez's lost brother, Fester
Gomez drifts in from the doorway
The room has remained untouched since Fester's disappearance as a teenager
The thick coating of dust and cobwebs adorns the mementoes of a rapscallion's youth - a football pennant from Alcatraz, headless sports trophies, a high school photo with all the other students keeping as much distance from Fester as possible
As he lovingly and morosely surveys the room: And for twenty-five years, nothing
Not a whisper, not a clue
'm beginning to think my my brother truly is lost
Gomez sighs
Thing  at his cuff, pulling him towards the B2

would kill for her
Either way -- what bliss
Low-voiced, incisive, and subtle, with Morticia, smiles are rare
The ghostly whiteness of her complexion is offset by the red of the pillowcase upon which her hair is spread like a diabolic halo
dark Garbo, sultry and remote, she's a ruined beauty
Morticia
(adoringly) Unhappy, darling

The walls of his room are covered with road signs he's collected -- "Bridge Out

Laughing, he crawls out of his human-size pajamas

She sits on a stool among the stored Addams' family objects, ,
The trap door is flung open,  pokes her head through
She's a giggly hag who looks like she was in the bathtub when the hairdryer fell in
Wednesday's pulled tooth swings at the end of the string
Thank you, Grandmama
In a foul mood, Granny tromps up into the attic
You kids are going to have to kill your own breakfast this morning
Wednesday opens a cigar box
Inside the box are assorted human and animal teeth, fangs and dentures, along with a collection of glass eyes
Wednesday drops her tooth in the box

En garde monsieur sole
He thrusts and parries, pantomiming a duel with the shaft of light
Gomez
Querida
Last night, you were
unhinged
You were like some desperate, howling demon
You frightened me

Though Tully comes here often and Margaret has been here before, they never cease to be startled by "Gate
" Tully has a puffy, once handsome face, and an embittered grey aura that is the mark of a middle-age misspent
High-strung and superficial, Margaret is more disap- pointed in Tully than he is in himself
Margaret passes through Gate first
Then, as Tully passes through, Gate slams on him, clipping him and catching the end of his coat
Tully fights Gate for his coat
Let me go
Ignoring Tully, Margaret continues stiffly up the walk
(to Gate) Gimme that
Stop it

It's not a good day

The crystal gloves in the chandeliers have been replaced by miniature jack o- lanterns
Skeletons, each wearing a top hat, hang from the sconces by the nooses around their necks
There are clusters of black and orange balloons, covered with cobwebs
Uncle Fester and Thing are draping the banisters and stairway railings with a garland made from crepe paper, dead branches and spanish moss
Skulls, each holding a candle, are scattered about, on the stairs and the furniture

Ghosts and goblins
Witches on broomsticks
Children begging in the streets

It lights
Pugsley giggles
Gomez stands up, having finished the pumpkin
He places it on a table, and lights the candle inside
The pumpkin glows

Everyone oohs and ahhs
You know, all the old sayings are true
