"  " screenplay by Charles Lederer Based on the play "The Front Page" by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur 1939 : Two telephone operators sit at switchboard busy plugging in and out answering calls
1ST This is the Morning Post
The City Room
Just a moment, 'll connect you
(plugs in call) 2ND Morning Post
Sports Department
Just a moment -- (plugs in call) to disclose the rest of the anteroom
To Camera left are the elevators -- at back wall directly behind switchboard are chairs and a table for visitors
Next to switchboard are stairs leading downward to the next floor waist-high iron grill with a gate in it separates the switchboard from the anteroom, a similar grill separating it again from the city room which stretches on beyond switchboard
At a table in the switchboard enclosure sits an office boy, about fifteen, doing a crossword puzzle
The big clock on the back wall shows that it is nearly one o'clock
as he bends over paper
We catch a glimpse of the squares of a crossword puzzle
as a reporter comes out of the City Room, clanging gate to behind him
The office boy looks up
What's a seven-letter word for --
Don't ask me
If  knew any seven- letter words, 'd be something better than a reporter
He catches a glimpse of the far elevator going down
Hey
Down
Down
as reporter runs in to the closed elevator door and pounds on it
It comes back, the door opens, and he gets in
The door closes, as elevator goes down
The near elevator comes up and discharges Hildy Johnson and Bruce Baldwin
Bruce carries an umbrella and wears a raincoat
office boy looking over his puzzle as Hildy and Bruce come into the scene
(with a smile) Hello, Skinny
Remember me
(looks up; then a glowing smile) Hildy Johnson
Hildy approaches the switchboard
(to operator) Hello, Maisie
The first operator looks up
Hello -- Hildy
You coming back
No, just visiting
Tell me, is the lord of the universe in today
He is -- and in a very bad humor think somebody stole one of his crown jewels
Shall  announce you
No, never mind -- 'll blow my own trumpet
, Hildy turns to Bruce
won't be more than ten minutes, promise you
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you
We hear a giggle off scene
He looks towards Bruce and Hildy and giggles
What did you say, Bruce
Bruce, embarrassed, looks at the office boy, then looks back at Hildy as they turn toward second gate leading into City Room
said -- uh --  said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce
heard it, but  just wanted to hear it again
can stand being spoiled a little
The gentleman 'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling
(grimly) 'd like to spoil him just once
Sure you don't want me to go in with you
My job, Bruce
started it -- and 'll finish it
suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember 'm here
'll come a-running, pardner
She starts to push open the iron-grilled gate leading into the City Room
Bruce quickly springs forward and opens it for her
Hildy smiles
Thanks, Bruce
She kisses his cheek and walks through
He looks after her
The office boy whistles
Bruce pays no attention, but stares after Hildy
- Hildy starts to walk through City Room
- as she walks the length of the City Room
It's a long walk, because it's a room that takes up practically the whole floor
The scene is a busy one
But, gradually, as Hildy starts down, one after another recognize her
There are cries of: "Hildy
" "Hello, Hildy", etc
, from the men as Hildy goes straight down the aisle
She never stops but waves her own greetings: "Jim
" "Hi, good-looking
" "Laura" "Hullo, Pop" "Nan
" "Eddie
" "Hello, Mac" "Pete
" "Frank" "Oscar
", and gets responses from each of them
One man is bent over his desk reading his copy -- he is standing up
Hildy slaps him as she goes by
He turns around: "Say, who did that
" As he sees Hildy: "Hello, Hildy
" Hildy: "Hi, Jake
" She passes a middle-aged woman, almost an Edna May Oliver type, seated at a desk pounding out copy and smoking a cigarette
As Hildy comes up to her she slaps the woman on the back
Hello, Beatrice
How's "Advice to the Lovelorn"
(looking up) Hildy
'll be a monkey's uncle
What are you doing here
Point of information -- what does a girl say on meeting her divorced husband
: (What does a girl do, etc
) (illustrating) My advice is duck and cross with your right
Hildy moves on
to the end of the room where she pauses before the frosted glass partition which separates Walter Burns' office from the rest of the City Room
' as she opens the door
Burns is shaving with an electric razor and Louie is holding the mirror up in front of him
shaving, Louie holding the mirror
little more round the chin, Boss
There is a sound of the door closing and Burns, without looking up, says: What do you want
Why, 'm surprised, Mr
Burns
That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife
(grinning) Hello, Hildy
Hello, Walter
(to Louie) Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king
Oh,  ain't doing that any more
'm retired
'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man
Editorials
Get going, Louie
got company
The door flies open and Duffy comes busting in
Walter
'm busy, Duffy
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve
What
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us
You're crazy
Where's Mac
He's on my phone
He just called me
They can't do that to me
He grabs the phone on his desk: Give me that call on Duffy's wire
Hello -- Mac
Burns
Where's the Governor
-- What do you mean, you can't locate him
(apparently pleading to the one man in the world who can help him) Mac, you know what this means
We're the only paper in town defending Earl Williams and if he hangs tomorrow we're washed up
Find the Governor and when you find him tell him we want that reprieve
Tell him elected him and  can have him impeached
Sure, you can do it, Mac -- know you can
always said you were the greatest reporter in the country and now you can prove it
Get going
Attaboy
He hangs up
(to Duffy, sarcastically) The greatest reporter in the country
First  gotta tell him what news to get
Gotta tell him how to get it -- then  gotta write it for him afterward
Now if you were a decent City Editor -- with Louie and Hildy in the b
g
Don't blame me
'm City Editor in name only
You do all the hiring around here
Yeah
Well,  do the firing, too
Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head
don't like to interfere with business, but would you boys pardon us while we have a little heart-to- heart talk
(together) Well -- But  gotta -- They look at Burns
Scram, you guys
They start to go
You won't miss anything
You'll probably be able to hear him just as well outside as here
They go
Mind if  sit down
Hildy sits
going out of the door
They cast an interested look back and linger a second
Over scene comes Burns' voice
' said scram
They close the door hurriedly
May  have a cigarette, please
Burns reaches into his pocket, extracts a cigarette and tosses it on the desk
Hildy reaches for it
Thanks
match
Burns delves into pockets again, comes up with matchbox, tosses it to Hildy, who catches it deftly, and strikes the match
How long is it
Hildy finishes lighting her cigarette, takes a puff, and fans out the match
How long is what
You know what
How long since we've seen each other
Let's see
was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda
Oh, about four months, guess
Seems like yesterday to me
(slyly) Maybe it was yesterday
Been seeing me in your dreams
(casually) No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter
You wouldn't know the old girl now
(with conviction) Oh, yes  would
'd know you any time -- He grows lyrical and, rising from his seat, is about to start toward her, as he continues: (together) -- any place, anywhere -- He sits
(half-pityingly) You're repeating yourself
That's the speech you made the night you proposed
(she burlesques his fervor) "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere
" (growling) notice you still remember it
'll always remember it
If  hadn't remembered it,  wouldn't have divorced you
You know, Hildy,  sort of wish you hadn't done it
Done what
Divorced me
It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself
It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted
Holy mackerel
Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for
Nonsense
You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'
Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today
It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge
We've got something between us nothing can change
suppose that's true in a way
am fond of you, Walter
often wish you weren't such a stinker
Now, that's a nice thing to say
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works
Well,  meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry
fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write: (she gestures above to indicate sky- writing) 'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple
Walter
It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it
Well,  don't want to brag, but 've still got the dimple -- and in the same place --  just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up
What home
What home
Don't you remember the home  promised you
Oh, yes -- we were to have it right after our honeymoon -- honeymoon
Was it my fault
Did  know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in
meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest did
All  know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom,  spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube
You don't deny that
Do you
Deny it
'm proud of it
We beat the whole country on that story
Well, suppose we did
That isn't what  got married for
What's the good of -- Look, Walter,  came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because 'm -- Let's not fight, Hildy
Tell you what
You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again
What
haven't any hard feelings
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way
Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what  came up here for
(rising, reaching for his hat) Sure, come on
We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything
(also rising) have a lunch date
just want -- You can break it, can't you
No,  can't
Sure you can
Come on
Don't tell me what to do
We're divorced -- 'm a free woman
You're not my husband and you're not my boss
And what's more, you're not going to be my boss
What do you mean by that
Just what  said
That's what  -- You mean you're not coming back to work here
That's the first time you've been right today
That's what  -- (still interrupting) You've had a better offer, eh
You bet 've got a better offer
Well, go on and take it
Work for somebody else
That's the gratitude get for -- know, Walter, but  -- (ignoring her) What were you when you came here five years ago
little college girl from a School of Journalism took a little doll-faced mugg -- You wouldn't have taken me if  hadn't been doll-faced
Why should
thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering
Listen, Walter -- (going right on) made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it
You need me and  need you -- and the paper needs both of us
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me
And so will you
It just didn't work out, Walter
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter
But no
You had to marry me and spoil everything
(indignantly) wasn't satisfied
suppose proposed to you
Well, you practically did
Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till  broke down
And  still claim was tight the night  proposed
If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it
But not you
(speechless) You -- you -- She grabs something and chucks it at him
He ducks
The phone rings
(to Hildy) You're losing your eye
You used to be able to pitch better than that
(he reaches for phone) Hello
Yeah
What
Sweeney
Well, what can  do for you
seated at his desk, talking into phone
What's the matter with you
Are you drunk
This is Duffy, not Sweeney
Burns into phone: Sweeney
You can't do that to me
Not today, of all days
Jumping Jehosophat
Oh, no, Sweeney
Well, suppose so
All right
If you have to, you have to
(he hangs up) How do you like that
Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day
What's the matter
Sweeney
Dead
Not yet
Might just as well be
The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby
Sweeney
(she laughs) Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he
don't care whether he did or not
He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital
Is there no sense of honor left in this country
(practically) Well, haven't you got anybody else
There's nobody else on the paper who can write
This'll break me, unless -- (he stares at Hildy; then a light breaks) Hildy
No
You've got to help me, Hildy
Keep away -- It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be
That's what 'm afraid of
"Any time -- any place -- anywhere
" Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us
Don't do it for me
Do it for the paper
Get away, Svengali
If you won't do it for love, how about money
Forget the other offer and 'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon -- All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more
Please
Will you just -- Great grief
What's that other paper going to give you
'm not working for any other paper
Oh
In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it
Trying to blackjack -- Look at this
(pulling her glove off her left hand) She gets glove off left hand and holds up an engagement ring for him to see
Do you see this
Do you know what an engagement ring is
He looks at ring, swallows, then: Burns and Hildy
tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing
'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as  can get
'm through
(himself again) Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business
You can't sell me that, Walter
Who says  can't
You're a newspaper man
That's why 'm quitting
want to go some place where  can be a woman
know you, Hildy, and  know what it would mean
It would kill you
(bitterly) journalist
Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen
know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what
So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on
No, Walter, 'm through
Where'd you meet this man
Bermuda
Bermuda
Rich, eh
Not what you'd call rich
Makes about five thousand a year
What's his line
He's in the insurance business
(looks up) The insurance business
(on the defensive) It's a good, honest business, isn't it
Oh sure, it's honest
But somehow, can't picture you with a guy who sells policies
Well,  can, and  love it
He forgets the office when he's with me
He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman
He does, does he
How did  treat you -- like a water buffalo
don't know about water buffaloes, but  know about him
He's kind and sweet and considerate
He wants a home -- and children
Say, sounds more like a guy  ought to marry
What's his name
Well, 'll give you a hint
By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs
Bruce Baldwin
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
as quick as that
The quicker the better
Well -- finally got out what  came in to tell you
(she extends her hand) So long, Walter, and better luck next time
(taking her hand) wish you everything  couldn't give you, Hildy
Thanks
Too bad  couldn't see this guy first
'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries
(laughing) Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now
Say, could  meet him
Oh, better not, Walter
Wouldn't do any good
You're not afraid, are you
Afraid
should say not
All right then, come on and let's see this paragon
(gets hat) Is he as good as you say
Better
Burns has his hat
They start toward the door
Then what does he want with you
(laughing) Now you got me
Nothing personal
was just asking
At the door, Burns walks ahead, opens door and walks out
' After all -- He stops as he realizes she's not there
The door opens
Hildy comes out
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me
(incredulous) No kidding
Reporters conversing
They stop as Hildy and Burns enter scene
as Hildy follows Burns through the City Room
This time, in contrast to Hildy's original walk through the room, the groups are silent as they watch the two
(trying to keep pace) And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady
(over his shoulder) What for
(shouting) And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her
(stops) Oh, 'm sorry
Burns, at this point, has reached the switchboard
He says, under his breath, to Maisie: (under his breath) Have Duffy call me in the restaurant in twenty minutes
Hildy, a little out of breath, catches up with him
At the iron gate that opens into anteroom Hildy jumps ahead, opens the gate and holds it for Burns
Allow me
(walking right through) Thanks
Hildy follows him out
as Hildy follows Burns in
Bruce is sitting on the bench
On the end of a bench sits an old, grizzled Western Union "boy"
Ignoring Bruce, Burns strides over to the "boy", seizes his hand, shakes it and says: can see right away my wife picked out the right husband for herself
Hildy behind him
Bruce registers amazement at this
The messenger is more amazed than Bruce as Burns keeps pumping his hand vigorously
There must be some mistake
'm already married
(you never saw a more surprised man) Already married
(turning to Hildy o
s
) Hildy, why didn't you tell me
She shakes her head at Burns' antics, but can't help smiling nevertheless
(again seizing messenger's hand) Congratulations again, Mr
Baldwin
But my name -- (as he enters scene) Mr
Burns
Burns turns slightly but doesn't release messenger's hand
Yeah
You'll have to excuse me -- 'm busy with Mr
Bruce Baldwin here
Just leave your card with the boy
Bruce takes hold of Burns' coat and shakes it to get his attention
Burns turns on him: 'm very sorry, but 'm busy
Look -- (he points o
s
) -- there's the boy
Take your card and leave it with him
He turns away again
Bruce, determinedly, takes hold of his sleeve and pulls at it
Mr
Burns -- (wheeling around) 've just told you  was busy with Mr
Bruce Baldwin
'm Bruce Baldwin
Burns, still pumping the dazed messenger's hand, stops at this, drops hand, and turns to Bruce: You're Bruce Baldwin
Yes
(accusing to messenger) Then who are you
(falteringly) My name's Pete Davis
Pete Davis
Well, Mr
Davis, this is no concern of yours and after this 'll thank you to keep out of my affairs
The messenger isn't quite sure what he's done but he slinks back to his seat as Burns turns to Bruce
She is beginning to get sore, but reluctantly again she is compelled to smile at Walter's behavior
(reaches for Bruce's hand but grabs the umbrella and begins shaking the handle up and down) This is a pleasure, Mr
Baldwin, and 'm sorry about the mistake
(he tries to shift the umbrella, calling Burns' attention to it, and offers his hand instead) Oh,  thought there was something funny
You see, Bruce, you don't mind if  call you Bruce, do you
After all, we're practically related -- (completely unnerved by this time, and you can't quite blame him) Mr
-- well -- no -- no -- not at all
You see, my wife --  mean, your wife -- that is,  mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man
(this is the final crusher) Oh
But  see, she didn't mean old in years
You always carry an umbrella, Bruce
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning
That's right
-- Rubbers, too, hope
man ought to be prepared for any emergency
Burns looks down
Bruce, in unconscious responses, helplessly lifts his foot up and we see the rubber
Attaboy
(taking Bruce's arm and leading him toward elevator) Come on, Bruce
(going along, but worried) Where are we going
Where are we going
'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you
(a helpless look back at Hildy) No -- she didn't
Just wanted to surprise you,  guess
(as the elevator is about to pass, he calls) Down
(practically shoving Bruce in) After you, Bruce
(as Bruce disappears inside he turns toward Hildy) Come on, Hildy, my treat
We don't see the passengers
Hildy comes into scene
suppose  can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling
(hurt) How do you like that
Here  am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks  get
He jumps into the elevator -- in a second he hops out
(very sweetly -- he almost sings it) Oh -- after you, Hildy
With a look of disgust Hildy gets in
Burns follows and the door slams on them
He looks after departed elevator and whistles
Then he grins all over
: - : Don't tell me it's you, Hildy
and discloses our three at a restaurant table
Nothing swanky -- a place like Jack Blake's in New York, say
(beaming at waiter) Nobody else
She extends her hand
The waiter takes it; they shake
How's everything, Gus
can't complain
(studying menu) Well,  can
'm hungry
Roast beef sandwich -- rare
And some coffee
Shall  put a little rum in the coffee
It's a nasty day
Good idea
How about you, Hildy
(discarding menu) Oh -- 'll take the same,  guess
And coffee
Little rum in yours, too
guess so
Bruce looks at her
She hurriedly changes her mind
No -- just coffee, Gus
(crestfallen) Just coffee
(to Bruce) And you, sir
(putting menu down) Oh, 'll take the same,  guess
And a glass of milk
(incredulous) Milk
(thinks he hasn't heard) Yes
(shaking his head as he writes it down) Milk
And don't put any rum in it, Gus
- Gus gives him a look and goes
- Burns surveys the others quizzically
(a sigh) Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh
How does it feel, Bruce
Feels awful good
Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married
(it's the Puritan in him) Taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow
He whistles
(rising to the bait) Oh, it isn't like that
(reassuring Mrs
Grundy) It will be perfectly all right, Walter
Mother is coming with us on the train
Mother
But your mother -- No
My mother
(he gets it and underlines it) Oh
Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind
(to Bruce) Isn't it sweet of Walter -- still wanting to protect me
She gives Burns that too-sweet look
(apparently taking this at face value) know  wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me
- (a little cookily) don't think she'll need you very much --  aim to do most of the protecting myself
He pats Hildy's arm -- she smiles at him
- , Well, 'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you
might have, Walter, but you were never there
Anyway, 'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things couldn't give her
You know, Hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that goes regardless of sex
But all she really ever wanted was a home
Well, 'll try to give her one
know you will, Bruce
Are you going to live with your mother
Just for the first year
(sighing) That'll be nice
home with mother
real honeymoon
In Albany, too
Ow
That "ow" is sotto voce, but it's the direct result of a kick under the table from Hildy
Mighty nice little town, Albany
They've got the State Capitol there, you know
Yes,  know
(he chuckles) Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath
She didn't even know  was in town
His laugh stops cold and he clutches for his shin again
Hildy just looks
Providentially, the waiter enters the scene
Well, here we are
He begins serving them
(trying to pick up again after a second) How's business, Bruce
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town
Most people there take it out pretty early in life
don't blame them
Gus, who has just managed to come between Hildy and Burns, lets out a startled "ouch"
Oh, 'm sorry, Gus
My foot must have slipped
(a pained expression belies his words) That's all right
sometimes wish 'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter
Still,  suppose it would have been the smart thing to do
Well,  honestly feel that way figure 'm in one line of business that really helps people
Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts
see what you mean
They fall to
- She sips her coffee and acts surprised
Gus, this -- - (winking) Good coffee, isn't it
- She smiles and winks back, and takes another sip
Gus starts to go
You've forgotten my milk
Oh
The milk
Yes
He leaves scene, shaking his head
Burns sips his coffee
He likes it
He lifts his cup to Hildy
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom
(lifts cup) Thank you
(looking for something to respond with -- apologetically) He hasn't brought my milk yet
bus boy comes into scene and stops before Burns
They want you on the phone, Mr
Burns
They would
Boy goes, Burns rises, starts off, comes back for his cup of coffee, which he then takes off with him
- (looking after him) You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow
(looking at him maternally) You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is
Oh, he's not the man for you
can see that
But  sort of like him
Got a lot of charm
He comes by it naturally
His grandfather was a snake
(shaking his head) If anybody had told me 'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet
That's what he did to me
Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor
Burns is listening, has coffee on ledge and sips it now and then
Get this -- get Sweeney off that yarn and out of town on a two weeks' vacation -- and right away
All right, Duffy, keep your shirt on
Hildy's coming back
No
She doesn't know it yet
But she'll be there promise you, Duffy
And tell Louie to stick around
He hangs up, smiles, and finishes the coffee
Then he girds himself for being crushed
He gradually begins to look sunk
He pulls out a small mirror to study his expression till he finally gets what he wants
He holds that expression as he comes out of the booth
Gus is entering the scene
Your milk, sir
He serves Bruce
And  brought you another cup of coffee, Hildy
Gus serves her and puts still another cup in front of Burns' chair
Thanks, Gus
She takes a sip and almost chokes
Too hot
(gasping for breath) No
It's strong
(quickly) But  like it that way
Gus goes, smiling
(looking off) Say, what's happened to Burns
He looks sunk, doesn't he
(beaming) He certainly -- hic -- does
Burns comes into scene, looking like a 1929 banker just before jumping off a roof, and sits down
Anything the matter
Just Sweeney again
One of my best reporters
What now
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord
They can't even find him
(he sips his coffee) tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation
(sipping hers) You said it
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow
Just what is the lowdown on Williams
It's simple
poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away
Because it happened to be a colored policeman
(for Bruce's benefit) The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town
Especially with an election coming up in a few days
Are you sure Williams is not all there
All you've got to do is talk to him
But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible
- (there's a sly expression on his face) How
' You could run an interview that would prove it
Remember the interview wrote with Jimmy Wellman
That saved his life
(slapping hands together) Yes, you could do it, Hildy
You could save that poor devil's life
You could -- but -- (the enthusiasm dies away) -- you're going away
forgot
How long would the interview take
Oh -- an hour for the interview
Another hour to write it
We could take the six o'clock train, Hildy
If it would save a man's life
No, Bruce, dear
Don't you see
This is a trick to get your sympathy
No, Walter, 've been waiting for something like this -- but  wasn't sure when you'd spring it
If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself
You're still a good reporter
Bruce and will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same
'm an editor
know what ought to be written, but  can't write it the way you could
It needs a woman's heart -- Why, Walter, you're getting poetic
(to Bruce) You see what  had to put up with
She never trusted me
You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands
Bruce gulps
How can you have any happiness after that
All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours
tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives
(breaking into applause) What a performance
Bravo
Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act
What do you mean, only an act
Haven't you got any feeling
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's
What do you mean
happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago
If he's got twins this morning,  claim it was done with mirrors
(laughs, throws up his hands) All right, Hildy, 'm licked
But 'll make you and Bruce a business proposition
We're not interested
(to Bruce) Maybe you'll be
You're a smart young man
You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000
00 insurance policy for me
What do you say
don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr
Burns
Wait a minute, Bruce
What's commission on a $100,000
00 policy
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars
But -- According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year
Listen, Bruce,  don't want Walter Burns to use me, but 'm perfectly willing to use him
How long will it take to get him examined
could get a company doctor in twenty minutes
Now you're talking
(turning on Burns) You keep out of this
Bruce, suppose you examine Mr
Burns in his office
'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building
You phone me as soon as Mr
Burns has given you his check
Then 'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train
(back to Burns) And no tricks, Walter
What tricks would  pull
Oh, nothing
Of course, you might cancel the check
Yes
Wait a minute
What would be his first payment on that policy
About twenty-five hundred dollars
Better make that a certified check, Walter
(indignantly) What do you think  am -- a crook
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly
No certified check -- no story -- Get me
All right
The check will be certified
Want my fingerprints
(rising) No thanks, 've still got those
Well, 'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn
It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too
Remember, Bruce, it must be certified
All right, dear
Wait a minute, Bruce
Have you got that money
(feeling his pocket) The five hundred
Sure
On second thought, would you let me have it
'll get the tickets
But -- Believe me, Bruce,  know what 'm doing
He'd get you in a crap game -- But  don't gamble, Hilda
know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns
Please, dear
(reluctantly) All right
(he pulls out his wallet) One -- two -- three -- four -- five
Five hundred
Be careful, honey
'll be careful, darling
You be, please
She kisses him, kisses her hand and pats it to Burns' cheek
So long, husbands
She goes
- leaving
She weaves just a bit
- They look after her
(smiling a little) never knew Hildy to be so determined before
You haven't seen anything yet
Bruce turns to look at Burns -- they look at each other
: :
-    - It is ringing
hand comes in to take the phone to show Endicott taking the phone
He has an eye shade over his eyes and five cards in his other hand
(into phone) Criminal Courts Press Room
This is Endicott
No, nothing new on the Williams case yet boss
Well, you bet 'm here plugging away every minute
(hangs up and studies his cards) Up a dime
to reveal the other players as they speak
Playing are reporters Murphy, Endicott, Wilson, Schwartz and McCue
(dropping his cards) By me
(also dropping) Droparoo
Schwartz knocks on table and drops cards
(reluctantly) 'll call
Three sixes
Is that any good
' It sure looks good from here
The boys all look up toward sound of Hildy's voice
framed in the doorway
She is carrying a bag and has changed her costume to a tailored travelling suit
She grins and comes into the room
They are all talking at once as Hildy comes into the scene
There are ad libs of "Hildy
" "Where'd you come from
" "Holy Mackeral, Hildy Johnson
", etc
Hildy raises her hand for silence
One at a time, boys
She enters to a desk, places her bag on top of the desk, takes her hat off and hangs it on a clothes tree in the corner, comes back to desk and opens the travelling bag
All through the above action she is talking rapidly
No, 'm not back for good
'm just covering the Earl Williams story for Mr
Sweeney who had a sudden attack of something but will be all right by tomorrow
No,  haven't made up with Walter Burns -- far from it
As a matter of fact, 'm leaving tonight for Albany and 'll be married tomorrow morning
The lucky man is Mr
Bruce Baldwin, a gentleman in the insurance business -- and when say gentleman,  mean gentleman
Are there any other questions
Hildy takes notebook and pencil out of bag, looks at the stockings she is wearing, sees she has a run and takes a fresh pair out of the bag
She sits down and begins to put on the new stockings
(grinning) Well, that about covers everything
Good
Now  want to ask you fellows a couple of questions
Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun
If you ask us, no
If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes
It's a simple story
Earl Williams works for the
McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years
He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty
year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job
(waving his hand toward Wilson) Take it away, Fred Wilson
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world
Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it
Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him
But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him
He gets scared and goes into hiding
(gesturing toward Schwartz) Come in, Dave Schwartz
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive
Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint
And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up
Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first
That is all
Thanks, boys
That's all  want to know
Hildy gets up, rolls the pair of stockings she has just discarded into a ball, crosses to Bensinger's desk and puts the stockings in a drawer
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk
know,  just want to give him a thrill
Hildy crosses back to desk and sits down
All right, boys, now that everything is settled, deal me in
Hildy glances toward clock on wall
The hands show 2:45
:  - Hands pointing to 2:45
She picks up phone nearest her on desk and starts to dial, picking up cards dealt her with one hand
(into phone) Hello, this is Hildy Johnson
Get me Walter Burns
(she studies her cards -- then, into phone) Hello, Walter
How's the old double- crosser
Telephone at his ear
Hello, my fine-feathered friend
Thought  might be hearing from you
What have you got to report
and we see that Burns is stripped to the waist
doctor is applying a stethoscope to his chest
We  the picture a second: Burns listening intently on the phone and the doctor listening intently to his chest
(into phone) Going all right, eh
(nodding) Fine
Doctor suddenly realizes what he's said and looks up
(putting hand over mouthpiece of phone) Doctor, will you please keep quiet a minute
How do you expect me to get any work done
to include Bruce, who has some papers in front of him at the desk
Bruce grins
How do you expect me to get anywhere if you're going to keep on that phone
If you'll just give me two minutes more -- (into phone) Well, they haven't finished with me yet but 'm hoping to get my shirt back
Oh, no
'm in the pink of condition
They found two new dimples
: - cards in her other hand
How about that check
All right, Mr
Burns, but remember, no checkee -- no story
Well, as soon as they decide whether you live or not will you have that new man of mine call me up
Yes, sir
(she hangs up) All right, boys
Up a dime
' Right back at you
(dropping his cards) You fight it cut
And up a dime
(studying a second) call
What you got
(displaying her cards) Three bullets
Any good
(throwing his cards away) Beats king up
Hildy rakes in the money
What are you going to do with all that money, Hildy
Yeah -- you can't spend it in Albany
Oh, 'll think of something
taking in door and including group
Bensinger, another reporter, comes in from the corridor
He stands out from the others because of his tidy appearance, and carries a book under his arm
Hello, Harvard
Got anything new on the hanging
(cockily) Why don't you fellows get your own news
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow
Hildy
He comes over to shake hands
Are you back
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney
'm going into business for myself
What doing
'm getting married tomorrow
Well, congratulations
Good luck
Why don't you use him for a bridesmaid, Hildy
Come on, Hildy, your deal
He opens a drawer, the one in which Hildy put her stockings
Say, who put these stockings in my desk
(he turns to the group) McCUE's   don't know, but  think they got rats in the building
(makes a gesture of disgust and picks up telephone) This is Bensinger
just saw the Sheriff
He won't move the hanging up a minute
All right, 'll talk to him again, but it's no use
The execution is set for seven in the morning
Get me a rewrite man
dealing the cards
Why can't they hang that guy at a reasonable hour, so we can get some sleep
(into phone) Jake, new lead on the hanging
This new alienist from New York -- Dr
Max
Egelhoffer -- is going to interview Williams in about half an hour -- in the Sheriff's office
- Murphy reaches for the phone
Without dropping his cards, he jiggles the hook
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams
Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him
(into phone) Gimme the desk
This Egelhoffer's pretty good
Yeah
What did he ever do for his country
Don't you remember
He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane
It created a sensation
He is referring to his notes as he talks: (into phone) Here's the situation on the eve of the hanging: He continues playing his cards: (into phone) This is Murphy
More slop on the hanging
(into phone) double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution
(into phone) Ready
The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes
(consults his hand) Up a dime
(into phone) The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty
(into phone) And to prove to the voters that the Red Menace is on the level, the Sheriff has written himself four more letters, threatening his life
know he wrote 'em on account of the misspellings
Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf
' What have you got, Hildy
Kings and sixes
(throwing down) That's good
(sweeping coins in) 'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'
Poetry
learned that at my grandma's knee
That's why  keep losing
My grandma was a modest woman -- nobody ever saw her knees, not even my grandpop
' The doctor has gone
Burns is adjusting his shirt
Bruce is sitting at the desk
don't know
This makes me feel funny
Why shouldn't  make Hildy my beneficiary
've got nobody else to leave it to
feel  ought to take care of her
Well, you'll take care of her
After all, if that doctor's right, 'm going to live for a long time yet
Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor
was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any
She had it coming to her, but she was too independent
Well, 'm independent, too
Figure it this way:  ought to be good for twenty-five years
By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything
But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries
Well, of course, if you put it that way
(everything he has on the ball) And remember this, Bruce
love her, too
'm beginning to realize that
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till 've passed on
Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after 'm gone
(a lump in his throat) Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us
It was all over for her before you came on the scene
For me -- it'll never be over
He turns away, wipes his eyes, and sneaks a glance to see how that goes over
It goes over big -- Bruce hurriedly wipes a tear away
as Duffy comes into the room
He advances toward the desk
(placing check on desk) Here's that certified check, Walter
(sotto voce) drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 'm a ruined man
(also sotto voce) Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five
(louder) Thanks, Duffy
Stick around
(picking up check he rises) He walks over to Bruce
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything
(also rising) Certified
'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you
He reacts to this sweetly solemn thought
as Burns walks Bruce toward door, his arm around him
Well, she'll know some day
That's all  ask
Oh, wait a minute
He releases Bruce, runs back and gets umbrella and brings it to him
Don't want to forget this, you know
Might start to rain again
Thanks
'll phone Hildy right away to get that story
They are at the door
Burns opens the door for Bruce
Louis is sitting at a desk, apparently engrossed in a newspaper
He is all alert, however
Bruce and Burns come into the scene talking
Well, anyway,  know Hildy's getting a good man
(embarrassed) Thanks a lot
They pass Louis
He looks up
Bruce, still embarrassed, looks down
Burns turns and signals to Louis
watching
Burns points to Bruce's back
Louis nods
Well,  got to get back
You can find your way out, can't you
Oh, sure
(he extends his hand) Well, thanks for everything
Don't thank me
should thank you
So long
So long
He turns and goes
Burns watches him
Bruce is going out, his back toward Camera
Burns watches
Louis comes between Burns and Bruce and follows Bruce out as we see Bruce going toward outer door
He rubs his hands in glee as he starts back for his office
She is raking in a pot
don't know why you boys are so good to me
(throwing cards down) Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy
Lend me two bucks, will you
Nothing doing
'm playing for keeps
There is a whirr and crash from the gallows
They start
wish they'd stop that practicing
The others drift into the scene and look out of the window
The trap is sprung by two or three earnest men
(turns away) Well, anyhow,  won't be covering stuff like this any more
What's the matter
Getting yellow
phone rings
McCue answers it
For you, Hildy
Hildy goes toward phone
Hildy Johnson
Oh, hello, Bruce
Have you got it
Is it certified
Certified and everything
Got it right here in my wallet
What
No, he's not here -- 'm in a phone booth
McCue is hovering near
Certified, eh
Who is it -- your milkman
(in phone) But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet
Well, you see -- (she is thinking rapidly) -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat
That brings you good luck for ten years
Say, 've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that
Where'd you get it
(to McCue) made it up just now, and who's asking you
(into phone) know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you
Yes, right now
All right
Wait a minute
He takes check out of wallet, folds it into lining of hat
All right
've done it
Now, are you satisfied
Fine
And here's a kiss for you
She blows a kiss into the phone
Immediately we hear kiss sounds all over
She looks up and glares
Then back to phone: Now, darling, you go back to the hotel and pack and you and Mother pick me up here about half-past five
Goodbye, dear
He blows a kiss into the phone and hangs up
Studying a paper, reads it for a moment
Bruce comes out of restaurant and starts out
After a second, Louis follows him
Warden Cooley sits at a desk near the grilled doorway that leads to the cells
He is studying a Racing Form
Hildy's hand reaches into the shot and flicks the newspaper
He looks up
to include Hildy
Hello, Hildy
What are you doing around here
want to interview Earl Williams, Warden
How about a little service
No more interviews
Besides, a doctor's coming over
Hildy reaches down out of camera range -- comes up with bill
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars
(looks at bill eagerly) think it is
(handing it over) thought so
Come on, 'm in a hurry
Cooley pockets the twenty and reaches for his key ring
There is a milling mob around a center of activity that the Camera can't find
as he sees this and strolls determinedly toward it
The cop comes in and breaks ranks
He pushes his way toward center and looks down
lying down, held by Louis
What's going on
This guy stole my watch
(lugging them both to feet) Have you got his watch
He's crazy
haven't any watch
saw him
He put it in his back pocket
haven't got -- Wait a minute
The cop reaches into Bruce's back pocket
Watch comes out
(to Louis) Is this yours
Yeah
That's it
What about it
never saw it before
Cop grabs Bruce
Louis grabs his other arm
Come on
He whistles
(to mob) Beat it
as they go through crowd
The look on poor Bruce's face, muddy anyhow, is something
Suddenly, Bruce cries: My hat
Get his hat, somebody
' lying top up, in a puddle
Hand reaches in and picks it up
as hat is passed to cop, who jams it down on Bruce's head
Another takem from Bruce
at the door of Earl Williams' cell
Hildy sits on a stool at the door, pencil and copy paper in hand
Earl Williams sits at the edge of his cot, facing Hildy
There is a bouquet of roses in a water pitcher by the cot
Our first impression of Williams is that he's a rational, well-poised citizen
It is only under Hildy's questioning that he gradually reveals himself
couldn't plead insanity, because you see 'm just as sane as anybody else
(puzzled and worried) You didn't mean to kill that policeman
Of course not
couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything 've ever stood for
They know it was an accident
They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs
What are your beliefs, Earl
They're very simple
believe in the Golden Rule
'm not the first man to die for preaching it
But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl
'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only
There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense
(writing) "Production for use only
" Well, maybe that's the answer
It's the only answer
Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems
Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked
Doesn't that make sense
(thoughtfully) Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl
' Just use things for what they were meant, that's all
Sure
(she studies him a moment) What's the purpose of a gun, Earl
gun
(he thinks -- then a revealing smile breaks out) Why -- to shoot, of course
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman
Sure
You see, 'd never had a gun in my hand before and  didn't know what to do with it
Well, when  get stuck,  know that there's an answer for everything in production for use
So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for
To shoot
So shot
Simple isn't it
(writing) Very simple, Earl
There's nothing crazy about that, is there
No, Earl, not at all
(she indicates the flowers) Who sent you the flowers, Earl
(reverently) Miss Mollie Malloy
She's a wonderful person
(pointing to picture pinned on wall) Isn't that her picture
(turning toward it) Yes
Isn't she beautiful
: ' If you should be pardoned, are you figuring on marrying Mollie
' Oh, no, she's much too good for me
' How'd you get in here
Sheriff Hartman has come into the scene
Hildy turns toward him
Same way you did
(pointing) Through that gate
gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission
All right, then, 'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner
Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say
Now, wait a minute
'm not afraid of anything
What were you going to write about Williams
Oh, nothing much
Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself
If you don't want me to run it -- (beaming) Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy
Go ahead, run it
And you can say treated him well, too
(turning toward Williams) 'Lo, Earl
How are you feeling
Fine, thanks, Sheriff
That's good, Earl
Oh, they've got another alienist to see you
He ought to be here any minute
Don't go to sleep, will you
won't
(to Hildy) Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging
(in a low voice so Williams won't overhear) No, thanks Sheriff
'm leaving town tonight
(just as loud as ever) You ought to stay over
You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy
That's awful kind of you, Sheriff
've got to get started on my interview
See you later
Don't forget about production for use
won't, Earl
(she goes) - The game is on
Bensinger, at his desk, is reading a book
The electric lights have been switched on
(raking in a pot) Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around
Who's this guy she's gonna marry
Baldwin -- his name is
give that marriage six months
Why
Hildy won't be able to stay away from a paper any longer than that
Did you see her eyes light up when she came in here
Like an old fire horse
She says she's gonna write fiction
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter
'll give ten to five that marriage won't last six months
Hildy's a newspaper man
She's got headlines in her veins -- the way we all have or we'd be out of these lousy jobs
Mollie Malloy appears in doorway
She moves slowly into the room
Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy
Hello, Mollie
How's tricks, Mollie
've been lookin' for you tramps
Kid, those were pretty roses you sent Earl
What do you want done with them tomorrow morning
(tensely) lot of wise guys, ain't you
(uncomfortably) You're breaking up the game, Mollie
What do you want
want to tell you what  think of you -- all of you
Hildy appears in the doorway and comes into the room
Keep your shirt on
(to Murphy) If you was worth breaking my fingers on, 'd tear your face wide open
Hildy goes to desk and begins typing away
What are you sore about, sweetheart
Wasn't that a swell story we gave you
You crumbs have been making a fool out of me long enough
(rising and coming over) She oughtn't be allowed in here
(flaring) never said  loved Earl Williams and was willing to marry him on the gallows
You made that up
And about my being his soul-mate and having a love-nest with him
looking up at her
You've been sucking around that cuckoo ever since he's been in the death- house
Everybody knows you're his sweetheart
She blows up
That's a lie
met Mr
Williams just once in my life when he was wandering around in the rain without his hat and coat on, like a sick dog, the day before the shooting went up to him like any human being would and  asked him what was the matter, and he told me about being fired after working at the same place for fourteen years, and  brought him up to my room because it was warm there
She is typing away, stops to look over at Mollie, then resolutely turns away, studies her stuff, and begins typing again
' Aw, put it on a phonograph
Just because you want to fill your lying paper with a lot of dirty scandal, you got to crucify him and make a stooge out of me
(to Mollie) Got a match
(heedless) tell you he just sat there talking to me -- all night
And never once laid a hand on me
In the morning he went away, and  never saw him again till that day at the trial
The boys laugh
She lashes out at them
Go on, laugh
'd like to know some curses bad enough for your greasy souls
Sure,  was his witness -- the only one he had
Yes -- me -- cheap little Mollie Malloy
'm everything the District Attorney said  was
And still  was the only one with guts enough to stand up for him
told the truth and the District Attorney knows it
That's why you're persecutin' me
Because Earl Williams treated me decent and not like an animal -- and  said so
(finally irritated) Go into your dance
This is the Press Room
We're busy
Why don't you go and see your boy- friend
(winks at the others) But you'll have to hurry up -- he left a call for seven
(through her teeth) It's a wonder a bolt of lightning don't come down and strike you all dead
From o
s
comes sound of the gallows
Mollie gasps
(suddenly uncomfortable) Don't get hysterical, kid
(begins to sob) Shame on you
-- (hysterically) poor little fellow that never meant nobody no harm
Sitting there alone this minute with the Angel of Death beside him, and you cracking jokes
typing away furiously, regardless of this
She ends a page
The sound of Mollie sobbing comes over the scene
Hildy inserts a fresh page
' If you don't shut up, we'll give you something to cry about
Hildy looks o
s
and rises determinedly
- She is still sobbing
Hildy comes into scene and puts her arm around Mollie
(gently) Come on, Mollie
This is no place for you
(she leads Mollie toward door) They're not human
They're newspaper men, Mollie
They can't help themselves
The Lord made them that way
(one look back as Hildy leads her out door) It wasn't the Lord
It was the devil
Hildy and Mollie exit
There is a pause
The boys look at each other uncomfortably
The phone rings
Wilson goes to answer
(picking up cards) You guys wanna play some more poker
What's the use
can't win a pot
(into phone) Who
Hildy Johnson
She just stepped out
She'll be back in a second
Who
Oh, Mr
Baldwin
Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in
All right
(he covers transmitter) (to others) Baldwin
The blushing bridegroom -- himself
What's he want
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited
Hildy comes back
Looks at them and stares contemptuously
Gentlemen of the Press
Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better
Phone for you, Hildy
(going toward it) Who is it
Oh, some insurance man
Are you in
(grabbing phone) Give me that
(into phone) Hello
Hello
Bruce
what
Where are you
You're where
How did that happen
(she listens unbelievingly a second) 'll be right over
as Hildy hangs up and darts out of room
The others watch in amazement
Boy, did you see her go
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub
told you Baldwin was in trouble
Probably went out without his hankie and wants Mamma to wipe his nose
still give that marriage six months
: at phone
Hello, baby, get me the Sheriff's offico, will you
Hello, Sheriff Hartman
This is Bensinger
How about that favor
You know what: once and for all, will you hang this guy at five
instead of seven
It won't hurt you and we can make the City Edition
' at phone
(indignantly) Once and for all, 'm not going to hang anybody except at the legal hour
What
Don't threaten me, Bensinger
'm not afraid of any newspapers
Yeah
Oh, shut up
(he hangs up; an afterthought -- he calls up operator) And, operator,  told you not to disturb me
don't care who calls -- don't want to be disturbed again till  tell you
(he hangs up -- turns to somebody o
s
and speaks) How do you like that, Dr
Egelhoffer
Want me to hang williams at their convenience
, showing Williams, Sheriff Hartman and Dr
Egelhoffer
They are the only occupants of room
Williams is seated facing a large standing searchlight
The newspapers
Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization
You said it
They're always after me for interviews
Me, too
(fencing) Of course,  sort of promised them would give out a statement when got through here
You don't mind
(not liking it) Well,  don't know if that's ethical
You see, all statements are supposed to come from me
(he'll bargain) We'll have to satisfy them
What would you say to giving them a joint interview
could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects
(he buys) joint interview, eh
That might be all right
We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor
Yes, shaking hands
don't take a very good picture, though
It doesn't matter
The publicity's the main thing
Yes,  suppose so
It all helps
(just a spectator up to now) Are you gentlemen all through with me
Oh, 'm sorry
forgot you were here
No, Mr
Williams, we still have some questions for you
Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights
The Sheriff puts out the lights and the Doctor switches on the searchlight, which shines in Williams' face
You know you are to be executed, Mr
Williams
Who do you feel is responsible for that
The system
But 'm not afraid to die, Doctor
'm dying for what believe
see
You realize, however, that you committed a crime
In a legal sense, yes
But not actually
Actually, 'm innocent didn't do anything
: 'm innocent
didn't do anything
never stole a watch in my life
to show us Bruce in police cell
Hildy outside
police lieutenant with her in b
g
know you didn't, Bruce
She whirls on lieutenant
(to lieutenant) Let him out of here, Lieutenant
(conciliatingly) But, Hildy,  can't
He's accused of stealing a watch
And they found the watch on him
And who accused him
Diamond Louis
One of the worst crooks in town
Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames
Now, Hildy -- Don't Hildy me
Are you going to let him out
can't
All right
You can't
But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs
And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty
can't let him out
You can let him out on bail, can't you
Five hundred dollars
You'll take fifty and like it
(wavers) Well, all right
But 'm liable to get into a jam
He starts to open cell door
You'll get into a worse one if you don't
: ( ) Hildy is combing Bruce's hair
He begins to look presentable
He fumbles in his breast pocket
What's the matter
lost my wallet
(stops) The check, Bruce
Bruce picks up his hat and gets check out of lining
That's right here
Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition
(taking check and putting it away) Yes, wasn't it
can't imagine who did it
can't think of any enemies  have
(looking at him fondly) 'm sure you haven't any
For a minute,  thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it
But then  realized he couldn't have been
Oh, no
How could you ever think of such a thing
Oh,  realized right away
He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy --  found that out
Yes, he is
Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when say next train, this time  mean it
Did you finish the interview
(to driver) The Criminal Courts Building
The driver nods
(to Bruce) No -- but 'm sure it'll be all right with Walter
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised -- Well, the story's practically finished
'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger
The cab stops
Hildy gets out and Bruce starts to follow
Hildy turns and pushes him back in the cab
at door of cab
Bruce in cab
No, you stay here
'm not taking any more chances
'll be down in three minutes -- and don't you dare move
Hildy turns and starts for stairs of Criminal Courts Building
: ' Schwartz is reading Hildy's interview to the other boys, who are grouped around
Bensinger is at his desk, a book open, but listening
(reading) "But the State has a production for use plan, too
It has a gallows and at seven
, unless a miracle occurs, that gallows will be used to separate the soul of Earl Williams from his body
And out of Molly Malloy's life will go the one kindly soul she ever knew --" (he stops) That's as far as Hildy got
But, ask you, can that girl write an interview
don't think it's very ethical reading other people's stuff
Don't give us that ethics stuff
You'll be the only one who'll swipe any of it
still say anybody that writes like that ain't going to give it up permanently to sew sox for a guy in the insurance business
Now  give that marriage three months and 'm laying three to one
Any takers
' 'll take that bet
They turn
Hildy comes into the scene
(going to her phone) It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies
(into phone; her voice assumes a silken quality) Hello, Post
Mr
Walter Burns, please
(embarrassed) Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily
(into phone) This is Hildy Johnson
(to Schwartz) Oh,  can give it up all right
Without a single quiver
'm going to live like a human being -- not like you rats
(into phone) Oh, is that you, Walter dear
Oh, didn't mean "dear
" That was just habit,  guess
Oh, be yourself, Walter
've got some news for you
Yes,  got the interview, but 've got some news that's more important
The others are listening, suspecting a scoop
Better get a pencil out and write it down
All ready
(then with a sudden change of pace) Get this, you double-crossing chimpanzee, there ain't gonna be any interview and there ain't gonna be any story
Huh
That certified check of yours is leaving with me in twenty minutes
And if  ever see you again, it's going to be just too bad
Eh
Oh, you don't know what 'm angry about, do you
If you come over 'll be very glad to tell you the story of Louie's watch dare you to come over, you -- you -- skunk in sheep's clothing
And bring that bodyguard of yours, too -- you'll need him
And  just want you to listen to one more thing
She gets her story out of typewriter, applies it to transmitter and tears it up
Hear that
That's the interview wrote
Yes,  know we made a bargain
just said 'd write it -- didn't say  wouldn't tear it up
Yes, it's all in little pieces now, Walter, and  hope to do the same for you some time
She hangs up
She reaches under her desk, pulls up bag, talking all the time
The others are too startled to do anything but listen
And that's my farewell to the newspaper game
'm going to live a normal life and have a home
She reaches into the drawer of desk and gets some stuff which she puts into bag
'm going to be a woman, not a newsgetting machine
'm going to have babies and nurse them and love them and give 'em cod liver oil and worry about their new teeth -- and the minute  catch one of them even looking at a newspaper, 'm going to brain him
Where's my hat
Someone points to her hat
She rises and goes toward it
Her bag is still open
Her phone rings
Schwartz answers it
(subdued tones) Hello, Mr
Burns
Yes, she's still here
(stopping midway to her hat) 'll take it
(she comes over to phone) What's the matter, Mr
Burns -- don't you understand English
-- Why, your language is shocking, Mr
Burns -- positively shocking
don't mind because  was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in
Oh, did you hear that, Central
We ought to report him, don't you think
Oh, fooey on you
She pulls the phone out of the wall, walks toward window and tosses it out of the window
She waits for the crash, turns back and says: Now where was that hat
Oh, yes
She starts toward it
' hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, 'm getting a little fatigued
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor
Just one thing more
'd like to reenact the crime, Mr
Williams
May have your gun, please, Sheriff
Hartman starts to take gun out, hesitates
don't know -- (insistently) Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice
Nothing's going to happen
Hartman hands him the gun
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were
You will be Earl Williams
And  will be the policeman
Follow me, Mr
Williams
Yes, sir
Egelhoffer hands the gun to Williams and then backs up a few paces
So -- now  say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest
' and you point your gun at me
(hesitantly) Well, it wasn't exactly that way -- (insistently) Point the gun at me
Williams does so
Then what did you do
Williams hesitates for a moment and then pulls the trigger
Hartman promptly dives under the desk as Egelhoffer topples over
(pathetically) Now can  go, please
There is a loud banging on the door and a voice calling: Hey, Sheriff
Open up
What happened
Williams, alarmed by voice, turns and starts toward window
Hildy is now wearing her hat and gloves
She picks up her bag and starts for the door
Goodbye, Yonson
So long, Hildy
Send us a postcard, kid
Who'll keep the lamp in the window for you
Goodbye, Hildy
Hildy has crossed to doorway, the
She turns and faces the room to make a last bravura speech
Well, goodbye, you wage-slaves
When you're crawling up fire escapes, getting kicked out of front doors, and eating Christmas dinners in one- armed joints, don't forget your pal, Hildy Johnson
And, remember, my husband sells insurance
She turns and starts on a bit of verse: "It takes a heap o' livin' to make a house a home
" She is interrupted by a terrific fusillade of shots in the courtyard
roar of excited voices comes up
For a tense second, everyone is motionless
There is another volley of shots
Wilson, Endicott and Murphy jump for the window
Get the riot guns
Spread out, you fellows
Etc
There's a jail-break
(at window, simultaneously) Cooley
What's the matter What's happened
Watch the gate
He's probably trying the gate
Outside, a siren begins to wail
(out the window) Who got away
Who was it
Earl
Williams
Who
Who'd he say
Earl Williams
It was Earl Williams
He got away
Etc
Holy ---
Gimme that telephone
(works hook frantically) Hurry
Hurry up
This is important
Searchlights hit the windows, sweeping from direction of the jail
Hildy stands paralyzed, her bundle in her hand
There is another rifle volley
Two windowpanes crash into the room
Some plaster falls
Gongs sound above the siren
The boys are jumping for their telephones
Another windowpane goes
(screaming) Look out
(out the window) Look out where you're aiming, will you
of reporters at their various phones follows: "Gimme the desk
" "Flash
" "Earl Williams just escaped
" "Don't know yet -- call you back
", etc
, are shouted into the phones by Schwartz, Wilson, McCue, Endicott, Bensinger and Murphy
After each man communicates with his paper, he dashes for the door
The last of the reporters is gone
- Her bag, almost unnoticed, falls to the floor as she moves back into the room, absently grabbing and trailing a chair
Ahhh -- She lets go of the chair and takes one of the telephones
Morning Post
Get me Walter Burns -- quick
Hildy Johnson calling
Very calmly she sits on the long table, her back against the wall and waits
- Walter
Hildy
Earl Williams just escaped from the County Jail
Yep
yep
yep
don't worry
'm on the job
She hangs up
There is another volley outside
Hildy sails her hat and starts peeling off her gloves as she jumps for the door
-    - There are the reporters joining armed guards who are leaping into squad cars ready for the chase
Cooley is beside the gate
As the reporters and guards pile into the cars, the gate opens and out they go
Hildy comes on a run from this door, hesitates a moment, then sees something o
s
and runs for it
- as it comes careening across courtyard toward gate
Hildy tears into scene, jumps for and makes the running-board, and hangs there as the car swerves up to the gate
- Hildy notices Cooley as the car, gathering speed, goes by him
She leaps from the running-board and lands clump on Cooley
- Cooley has been knocked to the ground by the impact of Hildy's leap
She is sitting on him
Cooley,  want to talk to you
(trying to get up) Hildy --  can't
'm busy --  -- Let me up, Hildy
Earl Williams has escaped -- He struggles
There's money in it, Cooley
can't Hildy
It means my job
It means -- (interrupting him) lot of money
(she opens her bag) Four hundred and fifty dollars -- She fingers the bills
How much
Four hundred and fifty dollars
Is it a deal
It's a deal
Let me up
Cooley gets up and dusts himself off
Let's see the money
(money still in her hand) First we talk
How did Earl Williams get that gun
Cooley looks around quickly
Come on, and 'll tell you
He jerks his head, indicating to Hildy to follow him
They move off as the gates are closed
: -    - The room is empty
All the telephones are ringing crazily
Endicott enters hurriedly, crosses to his phone
(into phone) Endicott talking
- (into phone) No -- nobody knows where he got the gun, but  think Mollie Malloy smuggled it in to him
He ran up the fire-escape, and went back in the infirmary window
Then he got out through the skylight
He must have slid down the rain-pipe to the street
' Gimme the Desk
including Murphy and Endicott at separate phones
No,  tell you
Nobody knows where he got it
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture
Call you back
He hangs up swiftly and goes out
No clue yet as to Earl Williams' whereabouts
Here's a little feature though: There's been an accident about a tear bomb -- Wilson enters and picks up his phone
(into phone) Wilson talking
Yeah -- tear bomb
Criminals cry for it
including Murphy, Wilson and doorway
The Sheriff enters, turning as he enters
As he turns back to someone in corridor: If the Mayor wants me, he knows where am
(into phone) This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad
What went off
(into phone) Four of Mr
Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital -- fine fair-weather friend you are
(remorselessly, into phone) The names are Merwyn
Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law -- After all 've done for you -- (continuing) Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side -- (into phone) Hello, Jim
Sidelights on Sheriff Hartman's manhunt
The Sheriff spins around -- another enemy
At this moment Hildy enters the room and crosses casually to her telephone where she stands waiting
(into phone) William Lungren, who is the Sheriff's landlord, and Lester Bartow who married the Sheriff's niece
You remember, the very homely dame
Call you back
He hangs up
(into phone) Mrs
William Tausig, age fifty-five, scrub lady, while at work scrubbing the eighth floor of the Commerce Building, was shot in the left leg by one of Sheriff Hartman's deputies
Hartman groans
There is a sound of machine-gun firing in the courtyard
There goes another scrub lady
(into phone) 'll go right after it
He hangs up and exits
(to Hildy) Any dope yet on how he got out
From all  can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him
'm very disappointed in you, Hildy Johnson
He turns and exits
' taking in Hildy and Murphy
How do you suppose Williams got that gun
As Hildy shrugs, there is another flurry of machine-gun fire
Murphy leaves precipitately
Hildy, alone at last, picks up the phone
(into phone) Give me Walter Burns -- quick -- She lays down the telephone receiver and crosses to the door which she closes, then returns to the phone
(picking up phone) Walter, listen
've got the inside story on how Williams got the gun and escaped
'  -    - at his desk, telephone to his ear
Exclusive
That's great
-    - It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley
'    - Never mind that
What's the story
- Never mind it
That's not my money
That's Bruce's money
'    - You'll get it
Now what's the story
(he raises his hand) 'll have the paper send the money right down to you
swear it on my mother's grave
- Wait a minute
Your mother's alive
'    - meant on my grandmother's grave
Don't be so technical, Hildy
What's the story
- Well, this expert Dr
Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime -- She starts to giggle at the thought
Well, 'm coming to it
It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it
Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman
'    - (laughing) No kidding, Hildy
(suspiciously) Say, this isn't a rib
- No, this is on the level, Walter
'm not good enough to make this one up
The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach
Who
No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly
They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover
'    - That's great work, Hildy
Huh
Oh, will you stop worrying about the money
'll see you get it in fifteen minutes
- It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band
' Hold on a minute
disclosing Louis and a blonde sitting on a divan in Walter's office
Burns' beckons the blonde: (his hand carefully over receiver of phone) Come here
There's a guy waiting in a taxi in front of the Criminal Courts building
His name is Bruce Baldwin
Can you do your stuff
've never flopped on you, have
Then scram
You've got about two minutes
She exits
(into phone) Sorry to keep you waiting
How much was it again
Four hundred and fifty dollars
Hang on a second
He puts his hand over the phone again and beckons to Louis
(to Louis) need four hundred and fifty dollars in counterfeit money
You know where can get it
It's awful funny --  happen to have some on me
(into phone) It's coming right over
'm sending it over with Louis
Thanks for the story and good luck on your honeymoon
Keep the thanks, but just see that the money gets here
She hangs up
The door opens and McCue enters and crosses to his phone
Hello, Hildy
thought you were gone
thought so, too
Hildy takes a look at the clock, rises and begins to pace up and down, pounding her hands together
(into phone) McCue speaking
Mrs
Phoebe DeWolfe, eight-sixty-one and a half South State Street, colored, gave birth to a pickaninny in a patrol wagon with Sheriff Hartman's special Rifle Squad acting as nurses
Well -- Phoebe was walking along the street when all of a sudden she began -- that's right
So the police coaxed her into the patrol wagon and they started a race with the stork
When the pickaninny was born the Rifle Squad examined him carefully to see if it was Earl Williams who they knew was hiding somewhere
Hildy is still pacing
McCue laughs at his own joke
(to Hildy) Did you get that, Hildy
No -- what
Hildy's phone rings
She answers
Hello -- Bruce
thought you were downstairs in a -- What
Arrested again
What for this time, Bruce
Mashing
Oh, Bruce, can't  leave you alone for three minutes even
Well, where are you
The 27th Precinct
All right, 'll be right over -- (she breaks off and looks down at her bag on the desk) 'll be over in twenty minutes, Bruce
(she hangs up) If  ever see Walter Burns -- (she picks up phone and dials viciously) Get me Walter Burns
Hildy Johnson
Well, he was there just a minute ago
Have him call me back
She hangs up
(to McCue) If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you
'll be right back
(she goes out) Okay, Hildy
(into phone) Well, we can't get any official statement -- The door opens and the Mayor enters
(into phone) Oh, wait a minute -- here's the Mayor
Maybe he'll give us one
turning away with a wave of his hand
Don't pester me now, please
got a lot on my mind
(into phone) His Honor won't say anything
He hangs up and exits out of scene
McCue comes in to him
Murphy and Endicott come in
(to McCue) Have you seen Sheriff Hartman
It's hard to say, Your Honor
The place is so full of cockroaches
Say, Your Honor, what effect's this jail-break going to have on the colored voters
Not an iota
In what way can an unavoidable misfortune of this sort influence the duty of every citizen, colored or otherwise
Your Honor, is there a Red Menace or ain't there
The Sheriff comes scooting in
(to the Sheriff) Hartman, 've been looking for you
He closes in on the Sheriff, followed by the reporters
So have we
What's the dope, Sheriff
Who engineered this getaway
Just a minute
We've got him located
Williams
Where is he
Where he used to live
You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out
The boys beat it, fast
Pete,  want to talk to you
ain't got time, Fred, honest
'll see you after
Did you actually give Williams that gun
(a wail) The professor asked me for it -- thought it was for something scientific
Pete, 've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf -- The Sheriff suddenly nudges him for quiet, and the Mayor, turning, sees: coming in and going to the phone
He is whistling
Hiya, Your Honor
(into phone) Schwartz calling
(to the Mayor) How about it, Your Honor
Any statement on the Red uprising tomorrow
What Red uprising
There'll be no Red uprising
(into phone) Gimme rewrite -- (to the Mayor) The Governor says the situation calls for the militia
You can quote me as saying that anything the Governor says is a tissue of lies
(into phone) Hello, Jake
Here's a red-hot statement from the Governor
He claims that the Mayor and the Sheriff have shown themselves to be a couple of eight-year-olds playing with fire
' Quote him as follows: "It is a lucky thing for the city that next Tuesday is Election Day, as the citizens will thus be saved the expense of impeaching the Mayor and the Sheriff
" That's all -- call you back
He hangs up and starts out
Nice to have seen you, Mayor
He exits, whistling
We've got to go somewhere private, Pete
've got to talk to you straight from the shoulder
They start out
As they start for the door it opens
As they exit Hildy enters, almost crossing them but not quite noticing them as she starts pounding her hands together and pacing up and down Press Room
as they start down the hall,
(beside himself) Now, listen, Fred
Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions
'll get results
'm doing everything humanly possible
've just sworn in four hundred deputies
Four hundred
Do you want to bankrupt this administration
(pleadingly) 'm getting them for twelve dollars a night
Twelve dollars
-- For those rheumatic uncles of yours
(gesturing) Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it
(with dignity) If you're talking about my brother- in-law, he's worked for the city fifteen years
They come to the door of the Sheriff's office
Hartman opens door and the Mayor enters, Hartman following
' Hartman closes door and turns to Mayor, who faces him portentously
Pete, you're through
(stunned) What do you mean -- through
mean 'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place
It's nothing personal
And, Pete -- it's the only way out
It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make
(David to Jonathan) Fred
Now, Pete
Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side
Fred,  don't know what to say thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature
wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete
Our families, Fred
've always looked on Bessie as my own sister
(wavering and desperate) If there was any way out
As a phone rings: There is a way out
've got Williams surrounded, haven't
What more do you want
(into phone) Hello
Yes
Hello
(wildly) Four hundred suppers
Nothing doing
This is a man-hunt -- not a banquet
The twelve dollars includes everything
He hangs up
That gives you an idea of what 'm up against
(hotly) We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'
Sheriff winces
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around -- know it
But they've got nothing to do with this case
Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em
But we're going to hang him, Fred
He can't get away
knock on the door
What do you mean he can't get away
He got away, didn't he
Knocking louder
Who's out there
() Is Sheriff Hartman in there
Sheriff starts for door
(relieved) Ah
For me
Sheriff opens the door
small, very colorless and ineffectual man named Pinkus is there
(as he opens door, disclosing Pinkus) 'm Sheriff Hartman
You want me
(coming in) You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff
(annoyed) What do you want
(taking a document from his pocket and proffering it to Sheriff) 'm a messenger at the State House
This is from the Governor
What's from the Governor
The reprieve for Earl Williams
(stunned) For who
(amiably) Earl Williams
The reprieve
-wait a minute
Getting his bearings
(bursting forth) The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere
Two days ago
And you fell for it, Pete
It frightens me what 'd like to do to you
(to Pinkus) Who else knows about this
The Sheriff, with shaking hands, opens and begins to read the thing
They were all standing around when he wrote it
It was after they got back from fishing
(to Sheriff) Get the Governor on the phone
(helpfully) You can't get him on the phone
He's out duckshooting now
Fishing
Duckshooting
How do you like that
guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan
(thrusting the document at the Mayor) Read it
Insane, he says
(shaking a finger in Pinkus' face) He knows very well that Williams ain't insane
Yeah
But  -- (interrupting) Pure politics
An attempt to ruin us
The phone rings
Hartman starts for it
(reading) Dementia praecox Oh-h-h
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this
What'll we tell 'em
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you
Ah, Fred -- (into phone) Hello
this is Hartman -- (apoplectic) And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that  want your resignation now
(from the phone) Sssh
Wait, Fred
(excitedly, into phone) What
Where
Where
Holy Moses
What is it
They got him
(back to phone) Wait a minute -- hold the wire
(to the Mayor) They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house
Tell 'em to hold the wire
did
(into phone) Hold the wire
Cover up that transmitter
Sheriff does so
Mayor faces Cooney
Now, listen
You never arrived here with this -- reprieve
Get it
(blinking) Yes,  did, just now
Don't you remember
How much do you make a week
Huh
(impatiently) How much do you make a week
What's your salary
(reluctantly) Forty dollars
(into phone) No -- don't out me off
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month
That's almost a hundred dollars a week
Who
Me
(exasperated) Who do you think
Pinkus is a little startled; the Mayor hastens to adopt a milder manner
Now, listen
There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office
The what
The City Sealer's office
You mean here in the city
(foaming) Yes, yes
(at phone) Well, wait a minute, will you
'm in conference
(a very deliberate intellect) No,  couldn't do that
Why not
couldn't work in the city
You see, 've got my family in the country
(desperate) But you could bring 'em in here
We'll pay all your expenses
(with vast thought) No,  don't think so
For heaven's sake, why not
got two kids going to school there, and if  changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade
No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one
And  guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors
(lured) Yeah
(into phone) Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen
Hurry up, Fred
Now what do you say
This puts me in a peculiar hole
No, it doesn't
(hands him the reprieve) Now, remember: you never delivered this
(rushing him to the door) You got caught in the traffic, or something
(opening door) Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you
But how do  know
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow
What's your name
Pinkus
(taking out his wallet) All right, Mr
Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut
Here
(he hands him a card) Go to this address
It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night
Just tell 'em Fred sent you
And here's fifty dollars on account
He pushes money into Pinkus's hand and pushes him through the door
Pinkus goes
(into phone, desperately) Will you wait, Olsen
'll tell you in a minute
The door opens again and Pinkus comes back in
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do
(turning hastily toward Pinkus) 'll explain it tomorrow
Is it hard
No
It's easy -- it's very easy
(pleadingly, into phone) Just one second -- That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be
(pushing him out the door) We'll fix that, too
(he closes the door after him) (into phone -- one more plea) Just -- one -- second
He turns to the Mayor with a gesture of appeal
The Mayor closes the door and turns to Hartman
(huskily) All right
Tell 'em to shoot to kill
What
Shoot to kill,  said
don't know, Fred
There's that reprieve if they ever find out
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered
Now, do as  tell you
(into phone) Hello, Olsen
Listen
(his voice is weak) Shoot to kill
That's the orders pass the word along
No
We dont want him
And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job
Yes, 'll be right out there
(hangs up) Well,  hope that's the right thing to do
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse
(mopping his brow) If we didn't have election Tuesday 'd have this on my conscience
Louie comes from the direction of the stairs and crosses toward door to Press Room
He pauses a moment, puts his hand in his pocket, pulls out some bills, counts them and opens the door
Hildy is still pacing, pounding her hands together and glancing every so often at the clock on the wall
Suddenly she crosses to her phone, picks up transmitter -- (into phone) Will you try -- ' Hildy
(wheeling towards door) Louie
She drops the phone and hurries towards him
Have you got my dough
Oh, sure
The boss sent me over with it
Four hundred dollars, wasn't it
Four hundred and fifty and 'll cut your throat if you try any tricks
All right, all right
You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you
Come on with that money
First you got to sign a receipt
(he pulls out a receipt) Where's the money
Keep your shirt on
got it -- right here
(he picks out money and counts) One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty
Now sign
(grabs money and signs) Here
Thanks
So long, Hildy
(grabbing him) So long, nothing
Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet
Huh
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena
You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet
Now, give me that wallet or 'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either
It'll be for life
Now don't get excited, Hildy
don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr
Baldwin's wallet
He takes Bruce's wallet out
(grabbing it) You know it is
didn't frisk him
He must have dropped it in Burns' office
didn't know whose it was
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr
Baldwin arrested again -- do you
(surprised) What -- already
Why, the dame left only a minute before  did
He suddenly realizes what he's said and sprints for the door
Hildy chucks something at him
It just misses as he ducks out of the door
Hildy casts a savage look after the departed Louie, takes another look at the clock and grabs a phone and starts to dial
(into phone) 27th Precinct Station House
Hildy stops short, arrested by a sound from the open window
She turns and sees Earl Williams, looking more inoffensive and exhausted than ever, indeed on the verge of collapse
He carries a large revolver
The search-lights that have been playing in the courtyard strike into the windows again
(pointing gun at her) Drop that phone -- Hildy drops the phone back on the hook
(supporting himself by holding on to edge of desk) You're not going to phone anybody where  am
(bracing herself) Put down that gun, Earl
He advances steadily toward Hildy, the gun aimed at her
You're not going to shoot me, Earl
'm your friend, remember
've got to write that story about your "Production for Use"
Yes -- that's right
Production for use
Hildy starts walking toward him, slowly
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you
Don't move
Hildy stops
Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer
You can't trust anybody in this crazy world
Say, 'll bet could shoot you from here
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you
You wouldn't want to kill anybody
No, no, you're right
don't want to kill anybody
All  want to do is be let alone
Hildy sneaks another step forward
Earl, there's just one thing  ought to clear up for the interview
What's that
Only -- you're getting too near
don't trust anybody
don't blame you, Earl
(another step forward) If  were in your place  wouldn't trust anybody, either
(suddenly) Keep away
He points the gun at Hildy, pulls the trigger and we hear a faint "click
" (weakly) guess  used all the shells
He drops the gun and clutches at the edge of the desk for support
Hildy lurches forward and she grabs the other side of the desk for support
And at this moment she looks more tired than he does
She looks at Earl and breathes heavily
Earl, you must never do that again
Oh, 'm awful tired
couldn't go through another day like this
(more her old self now) Well, maybe you think  could
as she retrieves the gun and jams it in her purse, jumps to the windows, pulls down the shades
' 'm not afraid to die
was tellin' the fella that when he handed me the gun
Hildy crosses swiftly to the door, locks it and puts out the lights, so that they are visible only faintly in the light from the areaway
Don't talk too loud
(babbling on as she moves about) Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand
Callin' me a Bolshevik
'm an anarchist
It's got nothin' to do with bombs
It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom
You see that, don't you
Sure  do, Earl
Hildy is looking around for a hiding place for him
wish they'd take me back and hang me
done my best
He abruptly crumples and falls to the floor
Hildy stands for a second, desperate
Then she picks him up and half carries, half drags him over toward a chair and places him in it
Then she makes a quick dash for her phone
(into phone) Hello
Gimme Walter Burns -- quick
Another phone there rings
Hildy answers it, propping the receiver of her own phone between ear and shoulder
(into second phone) Hello -- hel -- Oh, hello, Bruce
Oh, Bruce, please --  know  said 'd be down in fifteen minutes, but something terrific's happened
Hang on, Bruce -- (into first phone) Walter
Hildy
Come over here -- right away
Wait
(into second phone) Bruce, just a second, Bruce -- 'll explain everything
(into first phone) Walter
Get this: 've got Earl Williams
Yes
Here in the Press Room
Honest
On the level
Hurry -- need you
She hangs up and turns into second phone
Bruce, this is the biggest thing that ever happened
(lowers voice) just captured Earl Williams -- you know -- the murderer -- There is a knocking on the door, but she doesn't hear it
Bruce, 'll be down -- Well, Bruce, the minute  turn him over to the paper 'll be right down
Bruce, don't you -- Bruce,  can't now -- can't, don't you realize
There is a click from the phone
He has hung up
Hildy dejectedly hangs up the phone
There is the sound of knocking on the door
She springs up
taking in door
Hildy glares apprehensively, then crosses to it
(cautiously) Who's there
' It's me, Mollie Malloy
Let me in
Hildy carefully unlocks the door
Mollie bounds in like a wildcat and seizes her
Where are they gone
You know where they are
Wait a minute, Mollie
She manages to relock the door, then turns, leaning against it, facing Mollie
They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog
Mollie, they haven't got him
You gotta help me, Mollie
We've got to do something
What do you mean
There is a sound -- a groan -- as Williams starts to come to
(spinning around) What's that
Quiet, Mollie
There's somethin' funny going on around here
Mollie crosses to wall and switches on the lights
She sees Williams, sobs and rushes over to him
Mollie gets down on her knees and begins ministering to Earl
He opens his eyes
Hello, Mollie
Mollie begins to sob
Hildy comes over and says: Quiet, Mollie, quiet
(putting out hand to stroke her hair) Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about
How'd you get here, Earl
Down the drainpipe
didn't mean to shoot him
You believe me, don't you, Mollie
(coming up) Of course  believe you
forgot to thank you for those roses
They were beautiful
That's all right, Mr
Williams
(to Hildy) You're a woman
You got to help us
You got to get him out of here, some place where  can take care of him
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk
'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back
Let 'em take me
It's better that way
No -- 'll never let 'em
The door is tried outside
They'll get him
They'll get him
Ssh
Endicott at door is trying to get in
Who locked the door
(calling) Just a second, Mike --- (whispering to Mollie) Mollie,  got it
Hildy jumps in to the desk and opens it, turning to cry in a tense whisper to Earl: Can you get in this desk
Wilson is there too, now, and he and Endicott are pounding on the door
What's going on in there
, Mollie and Earl are with Hildy in front of desk now
They are speaking in whispers
What good'll it do
We'll get you out in ten minutes
Open up there, will you
, (crying) All right -- all right
(to Earl) Go on
(shoving him to desk) Please
They'll find me anyhow
There is further and louder pounding on the door
Earl gets in the desk
Hildy and Mollie pull the roll-top down over him
(calling) 'm coming
(to Earl) Keep dead quiet
Don't even breathe
(to Earl) 'll be right here
won't leave you
(giving door a terrific kick) Hey
(to Mollie) Mollie, drop down here
You've fainted
What's the idea
Never mind
Just play dead
Hildy rapidly unbuttons Mollie's waist and throws it back
The kicking at the door continues
Hildy rushes over to windows and pulls up the shades
Mollie is lying quietly on the floor with her eyes closed
Hildy rushes over to water cooler and gets a paper cup full of water
She throws the water in Mollie's face
(spluttering) Hey -- (fiercely) Shut up, you
Hildy crosses swiftly to the door
The door opens in Endicott's face and there is Miss Johnson, quite cool
Kind of exclusive, ain't you
We got calls to make, you know
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you
Smelling salts
What's going on here
They catch sight of Mollie, stretched out on the floor
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her
(as Endicott and Wilson enter room) Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out
've been trying to get her to come to
Mollie is shaking her head
She looks as though she's going to come to
Give me a hand with her, will you
Okay
(lifting Mollie) Up you go, Mollie
Hildy and Endicott lift Mollie and seat her in a chair
Wilson crosses to his phone
(into Phone) City Desk
Taking in Hildy, Wilson and Mollie and Endicott
She'll be all right
(crosses to his phone) The Desk
(into phone) Well, they surrounded the house, all right, only they forgot to tell Williams, and he wasn't there
Murphy comes in
(seeing Hildy, who has been fastening Mollie's blouse) Hildy,  thought you were gone -- Well --  was going, but Mollie fainted away and  thought  ought to do what  could
Some Hallowe'en goin' on outside
The whole police force standing on it's ear
Murphy crosses to his phone
McCue comes in
(panting) What a chase
(into phone) No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back
He hangs up
(into phone) Okay, later
He hangs up
(into phone) Murphy talking
Schwartz comes in
Any news
Yeah
was never so tired in my life
He picks up his phone
(into phone) Where
Harrison Street Station
All right, connect me
(into phone) Schwartz calling
Out with Hartman's deputies
'm in a drugstore
You can't call me back because 'm going right on with them
He hangs up -- puts his feet on the desk
Are you all right, now
Yeah, 'm feelin' fine
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life
(turning from phone) Yeah, hold the line
Hey, this looks good
An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar
Well - we've looked every other place
Want to go out on it
Aw, nuts with chasing around any more
spent a dollar-forty on taxis already
say we don't go out any more
Let Earl Williams come to us
fine bunch of reporters
Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it
It's easy for you to talk
You're retired
We're still working
Okay
(into phone) Forget it
(he hangs up) What's the matter with you boys
Afraid it might rain
If you want to go, 'll cover this end
Say, Hildy, if  know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us
Are you trying to scoop us or something
Something smells around here
If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun
(turning on Mollie) Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie
didn't do nothin'
(crossing to Mollie) Come clean, Mollie
Wilson, Endicott and Murphy follow McCue toward Hildy
Better let us in on it, Mollie
Aw, why don't you let her alone
She's ill
Oh, you two are pals now --  think you're right, Endicott
Mollie did give her some kind of story
tell you, it's a screwy set-up
We better hold onto 'em both
At this point Mrs
Baldwin appears in the doorway
Hildy gasps and starts for her
Mrs
Baldwin is in a very righteous mood
Well
as she comes in to her
Mother
Don't you mother me
Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy
Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow
Mother,  can explain everything
'll go with you in five minutes and -- You don't have to go with me at all
Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as 'm concerned
Stay with that murderer you caught
as they get this
Reactions as they glance at one another
' (continuing) Which one of these men is it
They all look like murderers to me
Where does she get that stuff
Shall we tell her what she looks like
Wait a minute
What murderer did you catch, Hildy
The reporters are looking intently at Hildy and Mrs
Baldwin
don't know what she's talking about
never said any such thing
'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me
The reporters move toward Hildy and Mrs
Baldwin speaking simultaneously
knew something stunk around here -- Who says she caught him --
What do you mean she caught a murderer --
etc
(desperately) But  never said anything like that
Yes, you did
She never told her that
said  was trying to catch one
(to Mrs
Baldwin) You got it balled up, Mother
taking in Mollie, with Murphy coming into scene to her
What do you know about it
How do you know she didn't
He grabs her cruelly by an arm
Let go
Endicott comes into scene
Hold on to her, Jimmy -- she's in with Hildy on this
Hildy tense with anxiety, her eyes on Mollie, off
Murphy comes viciously into scene to her and jerks Hildy by an arm
Who you holding out on
Come clean, or we'll make you wish you had -- as the rest of the reporters surround Hildy menacingly
(to Hildy) Hildy, are you gonna cross us for Walter Burns after the way you told him off
Give in, Hildy -- you can't get away with it
: Wait
You stool-pigeons
She don't know where Williams is
'm the one that knows
as they turn on Mollie
What do you mean, you know
They start for Mollie
Mollie begins backing slowly around the table, away from them, toward the window
Go find out, you heels
You don't think 'm gonna tell
who has remained riveted at desk
Let her alone
She's goofy
Hemmed in by the massed reporters, she makes a sudden lunge for the door
Look out
Close that door
etc
, etc
They split, some of them heading her off at door, others from opposite side of table, so that she runs back between window and table
You ain't gettin' out o' here
Now, where is he
Where you hidin' him
ain't gonna squeal
ain't goin' to
(leaning across table) Come on, you
Before we slap you down
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots
Where is he, before we beat it out of you
(backing) Don't you come near me, you kidney foot
Murphy continues to advance on her
The reporters start for her from the other side
Mollie snatches up a chair and swings it at the advancing circle of men
(wild and blubbering) Let me alone or 'll knock your heads off
Put down that chair
Get around -- get on the side of her
(still backing) No, you don't
(a scream) Keep away
Grab her
With a last, wild look at her encircling foes
You'll never get it out of me
(hurls chair at them) 'll never tell
Never
She makes a desperate leap for the open window and disappears out
Her scream of terror is heard as she drops : as the reporters rush in and look out, an assortment of awed and astonished exclamations rising from them
She turns away from the window and hides her face in her hands
Take me out of here
Take me -- (a moan) Oh-h -- She collapses to a chair
(turning) Get the cops, somebody
(turning) Come on, fellas
They start in a rush for the door
as the reporters rush out, and Hildy crosses, dazed to the window
Gee
The poor kid
the poor kid
Reaching the window, she looks out
' The form of Mollie on the pavement below moves slightly in the moonlight, as guards rush into scene to her
(of guards rushing in) Get a doctor
Take her to the infirmary
She ain't killed -- she's moving
Hildy turns, shaken, back into the room from the window and sees advancing to her across the room Walter Burns
Diamond Louie has entered with the Boss and stands leaning by the door
Mrs
Baldwin's face is still hidden by her hands
Hildy starts for Burns
Walter
-did you see -- (gesturing back to window) -- that
Yes
Where is he
(comes in to him) She jumped out of the window
know
Where is he,  said
[ ] looking up at them, off
What are you doing
' Shut up
won't shut up
That girl killed herself
Oh-h, you're doing something wrong
What's in that desk
- Burns slams closed the desk and steps to Louie
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up
See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way
What's that -- what's that
as Louie comes in to Mrs
Baldwin
Wait a minute, Walter
You can't do that
(extending his hand as if to shake hands with Mrs
Baldwin) My name is Louis Peluso
Unluckily for her she responds, only to find herself jerked to her feet and spun around so that one of Louie's arms is about her waist and the other hand over her mouth
Louie starts her to door
Tell 'em it's a case of delirium tremens
with them -- Hildy catching up
Now, let go of her, Louie
Listen, Walter, this'll get me in a terrible jam with my fiancee and  don't stand so well with him now
Don't worry, Mother, this is only temporary
At the door, Louie gets Mrs
Baldwin out and disappears with her
Hildy starts after them, when Burns' arm comes into scene, catching her
Where do you think you're going
Let go o' me
've got to get Bruce out of jail
Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me
(scornfully) Get Bruce out of jail
How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on
Hildy, this is war
You can't desert now
Oh, get off that trapeze
(indicating desk, off) There's your story
Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post
And take all the credit --  covered your story for you and  got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now 'm getting out
know  told you that twice before today -- but this time mean it
You drooling idiot
What do you mean, you're getting out
There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk
-- Once in a lifetime
Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants
know, but -- (interrupting) You know
You've got the brain of a pancake
That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution
Hildy
This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald
(quickly closes the door) (slightly bewildered) Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone
Don't get technical at a time like this
Do you realize what you've done
You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia
We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives
(the fire upon her) 'd like to think
Well, think it then, because it's true
We'll crucify that mob
We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive
Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him
(excited) get it
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart
You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall
You've put one administration out and another in
This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career
And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train
Still a doll-faced mugg
That's all you are
Let me get at that typewriter and 'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write
Attagirl
Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street
There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy
The radio'll be after you -- the movies
(slapping his fist against his open palm) By tomorrow morning 'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar
can see the billboards now
Light up with Hildy Johnson
Whoa -- wait a minute
We can't leave Williams here
One of the other fellows'll -- We're going to take him over to my private office
(turning) Where's our phone
That one -- how you gonna take him
They'll see him
as Burns gets phone and jiggles the hook
Not if he's inside the desk
We'll carry the desk over
(into phone) Give me Duffy
You can't take that desk out
It's crawling with cops outside
We'll lower it out of the window with pulleys
Quit stallin'
As Hildy seems abstracted: Hildy
(coming to) Huh
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you
Snap into it
How much do you want on it
All the words you've got
(turning) Where's some paper
Goes out of scene
(into phone) Hello
Hello
As Hildy comes in, going to desk, she turns to call back: Can  call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous
Call him a love-child, if you want to
(into phone) Duffy
Having opened the drawers of Bensinger's desk, she is tossing play manuscripts, syringes, patent medicines and old socks into the air, in a frantic search for paper
(calling to Burns) How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department
Give him the works
(into phone) Hello, Duffy, get set
We've got the biggest story in the world
Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive
Hildy has unearthed a package of Bensinger's private stationary
She rises with it
(to Hildy) Fine
(into phone) Now, listen, Duffy --  want you to tear out the whole front page
That's what  said -- the whole front page
Never mind the European war
We've got something a whole lot bigger than that
Hildy Johnson's writing the lead and 'll phone it over to you as soon as she's finished
(he starts to hang up, then thinks of something else) Oh, Duffy
Get hold of Butch 'Connor and tell him  want him to come up here with half a dozen other wrestlers -- right away
Tell him we'll run his picture on the sport page for two weeks straight
What
've got a desk  want moved
Never mind what desk
: as the taxi darts through traffic, narrowly avoiding cars, trucks, etc
, it comes almost head-on to an oncoming car
-  - Louie, worried, ducks unconsciously
Mrs
Baldwin faints across his lap
The taxi swerves just in time to duck the oncoming car
As it starts forward again a truck comes toward the cab, head on
- Diamond Louie pushes Mrs
Baldwin into an upright position, takes a look through the windshield, sees the truck and gives a big "takem" and faints across Mrs
Baldwin
The truck and taxicab crash and the screen blacks out
: - at typewriter, smoke rising from her cigarette
As the we see a fairly disheveled Hildy typing away furiously
' (Into phone) "The Blackest cesspool in American city life
" Hold on Duffy, 'll see if she's got any more
Burns comes into the scene, tears a page out of Hildy's typewriter
She inserts another one without noticing
Burns goes back to the phone as Hildy continues to type furiously
(into phone) Duffy -- Duffy
(clicking the phone furiously) Operator
Operator
Get me Duffy back
Somebody cut us off
as Bruce Baldwin enters
Hildy
What the devil do you want
Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now
We're busy
(suddenly, into phone) Where you been, Duffy
Stick around
What
What Chinese earthquake
The deuce with it
what's that
typing away madly
Bruce comes into the scene
Hildy
(looking up, very casually) Hello, Bruce
She resumes her typing, then suddenly realizes the situation and jumps up
How'd you get out
(the hands-off attitude) Not through any help of yours, Hildy
Bruce,  know, but  was in the biggest jam -- ' Hildy
As Hildy turns toward his voice, Burns, still with the phone in his hand, keeps talking to her
For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story
(resignedly) Okay, Walter
(sits down at her typewriter again) Hildy begins typing again
waited and waited and then  had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so  could get out on bail
(desperately) don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station
(she barely stops typing) We'll explain the whole thing to them
(resumes typing) know  got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours
Bruce, you know 'm mad about you and stop talking like that
(calling o
s
to Walter) Walter
(into phone) Take the President's speech and run it on the funny page
(turns to Hildy, o
s
) What is it, Hildy
' What was the name of the Mayor's first wife
You mean the one who drank so much
Tillie
Thanks
(she types furiously) Its top opens slowly and Williams' head sticks out
(screaming) Get back in there, you mock turtle
The desk-top falls, the fugitive disappearing within
turning around toward Burns
Did you say anything, Mister Burns
covering up, fast
No --  was just talking to one of the guys at the office
(indicating phone in his hand) (to Burns) Oh
(turns to Hildy) wonder what's keeping mother
She was supposed to come down and get you
Oh, she was here
Where'd she go
Out some place
She types away
Bruce grabs her and stops her
Hildy
Where's mother
Oh -- mother -- she --  don't know where she went
Did you give her the money
No,  was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly
Then suppose you give me the money
Four hundred and fifty dollars
Oh, yes
Here it is
She gets the wallet
Burns comes into the scene and pulls another page out of her machine
Here it is, Bruce
One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars
(drily) Thank you
watching this with a grin
Featuring the threesome
(to Hildy) And 'll take that certified check, too
've decided  can handle things around here
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going
Sorry, Bruce, but -- Just a second, Walter
Here, Bruce, here's the check
And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet
got it back
(taking it and surveying it coldly) You got it back, eh
There's something funny going on around here
Hildy
All right, Walter
She sits down and begins to type
'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy
And you can meet us at the station
Fine
She types away
(coming over to Bruce) 'll see she's there, Bruce,  promise you
(dramatically) If she's not there, mother and  are leaving anyhow
But Hildy continues typing and doesn't even get it
as he leads Bruce away toward door
know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her
She's only a woman, after all
Suppose she is --  have feelings, too
Do you know where 've been for the last couple of hours
Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it
Ts
Ts
Ts
And now  don't know where my mother is
She may be lost
'll find her, Bruce, if  have to put every detective in the city on the job
Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother
What does she look like
She's -- well, she's very motherly
That's about the best description know
(nodding) That's the kind of stuff they want
They go out the door
as they come out
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you
The money
Why
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around
(worried) Gee
Take a look, will you
He hands the money to Burns
Burns looks at it carefully and hands it back
Oh, this is all right, Bruce
just wanted to be sure
Say,  want to be sure, too
Hildy is typing furiously
Burns enters, grinning, locks the door behind him and goes to phone and picks it up
(into phone) Duffy
Good
Stick close
He turns and crosses quickly to look out the window
Burns coming in to window
(despairingly) Now the moon's out
He turns away, crossing to the desk, the with him
At the desk he taps three times, being answered by three taps from within
Fine
Three taps is me
Don't forget
You're sitting pretty, now
Got enough air
He raises top an inch or two and fans air in to Williams
Is that better
Now breathe deep
We hear an intake of breath from inside the desk
Attaboy
He closes the desk and turns back to the table
As he passes Hildy, who is still typing rapidly: (looking over her shoulder) That's the stuff
Lam it into 'em, Hildy
He jerks the sheet from Hildy's machine, crosses to his desk and picks up the phone
(into phone) Hello
Duffy, ready
Here we go
reading from the page he has taken from Hildy's typewriter
(into phone) "In the darkest hour of the city's history --" At the end of the hall are glass doors through which can be seen a turmoil of activity in the street outside -- newsboys, a crowd, and a mounted policeman or two
Bruce comes down the hall, his face set and angry
As he goes, he sees a sign set over a doorway in the hall
It reads: He stops and enters
- (into phone) Listen, did you impress it on Butch that  want him and his gang here right away
You did
Every minute counts
All right
(puts receiver down on table) Duffy's getting old
Where's Butch
' He's on the way
(over her typing) He'd better hurry
The boys'll be coming back to phone
(coming into shot to peer over her shoulder) Well, keep going
We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late
(looking up suddenly) Where's Bruce
Bruce
Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets
What tickets
Railroad tickets
Is he coming back here
Didn't you hear him
Of course he's coming back here
Keep going, will you
as Burns leaves Hildy and goes over to desk and picks up his phone again
(into phone) Duffy
- Finding the door locked, he knocks
- as another knock comes, they take it big
(calling) Who is it
- What's the idea of locking this
- That's Bensinger
That's his desk
(whispering) What's his name
The door knob is rattled violently
Bensinger -- of the Tribune
- Open this door
He starts for the door
'll handle him
to the door
The Tribune, eh
Watch me
He opens the door
(as he comes in) Ain't you got any more sense than to -- (sees Burns and is overcome) Oh, h-hello, Mr
Burns
Why, quite an honor having you come over here
(casually) Hello, Bensinger
Excuse me,  just want to -- He starts for the desk
Hildy's typing goes on, coming in over the scene
(starting for the desk, suddenly blocking his path) Quite a coincidence, my running into you tonight
Isn't it, Hildy
' Yeh
How do you mean
was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy
(essaying a pleasantry) Nothing -- ah -- detrimental,  hope
should say not
That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning
(deeply moved) Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr
Burns
(startled) The poem
The poem was great
(blinking at these words) Remember the ending
(and he recites) " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears
" (overcome) Heartbreaking
How would you like to work for me
What
taking in table, Hildy typing there
(to Bensinger) We need somebody like you
All we've got now are a lot of low-brows
Like Johnson here
He starts shoving Bensinger away from the desk, toward the table
Seriously, Mr
Burns
Clinging to him, Burns takes him to the phone
(into phone) Duffy
'm sending Bensinger over to see you
(looking up at Bensinger) Mervyn, isn't it
No
Roy
Roy
(with a little laugh at his own forgetfulness) Of course
(into phone) Roy Bensinger, the poet
Of course you wouldn't know
You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either
Put Mr
Bensinger right on the staff
(to Bensinger) How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy
Seventy-five
'll give you a hundred and a by- line
as Burns continues
(into phone) Let him have everything he wants
(puts down the receiver; turns to Bensinger) Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man
(acting it out) He hides, cowering
Afraid of every light, of every sound
hears footsteps
his heart going like that
And all the time they're closing in
Get the sense of an animal at bay
Sort of a Jack London style
Exactly
Leads him hurriedly to the door
got my rhyming dictionary in -- (indicating desk) (getting him to door) It doesn't have to rhyme
- as Bensinger turns there
Gee, 'm terribly grateful, Mister Burns
Do you suppose there might be an opening some time as foreign correspondent
parley a little French, you know
Burns shakes hands with him and opens the door with the other hand
'll keep you in mind
(going) Au revoir, mon capitaine
(never at a loss in any language) Bon jour
Continuing his French, he gets the door closed and relocked and turns for the table, singing as he does so: Mademoiselle from Armontieres, parlay -- Burns returns alertly to table, not noticing that Hildy has stopped typing, and sits staring moodily before her
(into phono) Duffy
Got this
- rat from the Tribune is coming over to get a job -- Bensinger, the guy  told you about
Handle him with kid gloves
Tell him to get busy writing poetry
No, we don't want him
Stall him along until the extra comes out
Then tell him his poetry stinks and kick him downstairs
He lays down receiver
taking in Hildy
She looks up at him
(to Burns) Double-crossing swine
You said it
But this'll teach him a lesson
He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this
Hildy doesn't bother to reply
She rests her chin on her hands and stares moodily ahead
Tear into it, will you
Don't sit there like a frozen robin
'm finished
Finished
He grabs the last sheet of paper out of her typewriter, kisses her and rushes over to the telephone
at phone
(into phone) Duffy
All right -- here we go
And got it out as soon as you can want this paper out on the streets in half an hour
(reading Hildy's copy) "So once more the Morning Post --" - Diamond Louie, bearing evidence of a mishap, his hat crushed, his face bruised and his clothes torn, comes running down the sidewalk and up the steps into the buildings
- Hildy is up now, pacing
Bruce ought to be back by now
Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you
(coming over to her) Hildy, you think  could
After this story
(taking a flask from his pocket) Here
You're just nervous
Hildy takes the flask and takes a drink
There is a knock on the door
Burns takes the flask from her, restores it to his pocket and goes to the door
Who is it
' It's me, Boss -- Louie
(opening the door) It's Louie
Louie slips in and Burns relocks the door
(seeing Louie's disarray) What's the matter
Hildy crosses to Louie
(frantically) Where's Mrs
Baldwin
What did you do with her
(almost afraid to speak) What happened
- You been in a fight
(still out of breath) Down Western Avenue
We were going sixty-five miles an hour
You know what  mean
Take that mush out of your mouth
Where's the old lady
'm telling you
- as he gets breath and blurts: We run smack into a police patrol
You know what  mean
We broke it in half
(moaning) Oh-h-h
was she hurt
Where is she
Tell me
Louie
'm telling you
Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops
They come rollin' out like oranges
(seizing him) What did you do with her
Search me
When  come to  was running down Thirty-fifth Street
-- You were with her
You were in the cab, weren't you
(exposing his bruised scalp) Was
The driver got knocked cold
Butter-fingers
give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops
What do you mean,  handed her
The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street
Now everything's fine
She's probably squawking her head off in some police station
- don't think she's talking much
You know what  mean
He winks reassuringly
(paralyzed) Don't tell me -- was she killed
(hopefully) Was she
Did you notice
Say, me with a gun on my hip and a kidnapped old lady on my hands, should stick around asking questions from a lot of cops
You know what mean
Hildy sinks into a chair
Dead
dead
That's the end
Burns comes into scene to her
It's Fate, Hildy
What will be, will be
(wildly) What am  going to say to Bruce
What'll  tell him
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything
(whacking her on the shoulder) Snap out of it
Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here
killed her
'm responsible
Oh- h
what can  do now
How can ever face him
Oh,  hope he never comes back
She buries her face in her hands
Look at me, Hildy -- (springing up) 'm looking at you -- you murderer
If it was my own mother, 'd carry on
You know  would
For the paper
(calling off to Louie) Louie, where'd it happen
'm going out
The Post phone rings
(grabbing Hildy) You stay here
'll find out everything
(to Hildy) Western an' Thirty-fourth
Hildy jumps for the outside phone on the desk
(into phone) Hello -- hello
(into phone) Gimme Western four-five-five-seven
(guarded) Who
(wildly) Hello, Butch
Where are you
(into phone) Mission Hospital
Gimme the Receiving Room
(into phone) What are you doing there
Haven't you even started
(into phone) Hello -- Eddie
Hildy Johnson
Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup
(into phone) Oh, for -- (yelling) Sebastian -- Butch
Listen, it's a matter of life and death
Listen
(into phone) Nobody
(jiggles hook) Morningside three-one-two-four
(into phone) can't hear
You got who
Speak up
what
You can't stop for a dame now
(into phone) Is this the Community Hospital
(howling into phone) don't care if you've been after her for six years
Butch, our whole lives are at stake
Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through
(into phone) Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson
Was there an old lady --
(into phone, drowning out Hildy) Butch
'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here
(indicates up to where) Now, you can't double-cross me
She does
All right -- put her on
'll talk to her
Hello
Oh, hello, Madam
Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty
What's that
You say that again and 'll come over there and knock your eye out
Hello
(turning, as he hangs up) 'll kill 'em
'll kill both of 'em
(into Post phone) Duffy
(to the universe) Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time
That's co-operation
(screaming into phone) Duffy
Shut up, will you
(into phone) You sure
Nobody
(into phone) Duffy
(listening) (into phone) Duffy
(listening) Well, where is Duffy
(throwing receiver to desk) Diabetes
ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease
(turning) Louie
(to Louie) It's up to you
(loyally) Anything you want, Boss
Beat it out and get hold of some guys
Who do you want
(starting for the door, followed by Louie) Anybody with hair on his chest
Get 'em off the street -- anywhere
Offer them anything -- only get them
(confidentially) We've got to get this desk out of here
He unlocks the door
You know me
The shirt off my back
You got plenty of money
Sure, boss
mean real money -- not counterfeit
always have both
He goes out
(calling after him) And don't bump into anything
He relocks the door
Lafayette two-one-hundred
(turning from door) That dumb immigrant'll flop on me know it
(bitterly) Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this
, Burns steps into scene
(confidentially) If Louie doesn't come back in five minutes we'll get it out alone
There's millions of ways
We can start a fire and get the firemen to carry it out in the confusion
He crosses to the desk and inspects it
(into phone) Ring that number, will you
(to Hildy, oblivious of her telephoning) Come here
See if we can move it
(into phone) Hello -- hello
Is this the Lying -- In Hospital
Did you have an auto accident in the last -- (interrupting) Will you come here
(into phone) Oh,  see
beg your pardon
When 'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you -- Yes
She jiggles the phone hook
(going to her) Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now
It -- it wouldn't be cricket
don't care what you say
'm going to find Bruce's mother
(she jiggles the hook madly) Oh-h
(she hangs up) 'm going out and find her
Grabbing her hat and purse, she starts for the door
, There is a loud knocking on the door
(coming into scene after Hildy) Don't open that
(at the door) Who says so
'm going to the morgue -- to look -- She unlocks the door
as Hildy flings the door open, only to find the Sheriff, accompanied by two deputies -- Carl and Frank -- and surrounded by McCue, Murphy, Schwartz, Wilson and Endicott
There she is
Say, Hildy
Hildy makes a decision and tries to push through them, but the Sheriff grabs her and pushes her back
Just a minute, Johnson
Let go o' me
What's the idea
What's your hurry
We want to see you
The deputies seize her
Take your paws off me
Hold her, boys
Burns comes into scene
(to Sheriff) Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this
You can't bluff me, Burns
don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of
(struggling) Let me go
(hysterically) Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law
Hang onto her
Keep her in here
as Hildy breaks loose and retreats back into the room before Hartman and the deputies
We know what you're up to
Probably goin' out to get Williams
The door was locked
She and Mollie were talking
don't know anything,  tell you
There's been an accident
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me
wasn't born yesterday
Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy -- Nobody's trying to put anything over on you
'm getting out of here and you can't stop me
(comes into scene) You're not going anywhere
(to the Sheriff) She's got the story sewed up, Pete
(indicating Burns) That's why Burns is here
We're on to you, Hildy
Let us in on it
- (purring) If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner
Otherwise, 'll have to ask you to get out
(pop-eyed; stammering) You'll ask me to what
Get out
(to deputies, off) Close that door
Don't let anybody in or out
- Come on, Pinky
Give 'em a little third degree
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky
Johnson, 'm going to the bottom of this
What do you know about Williams
Are you going to talk or aren't you
What do  know about Williams
All right, boys
Take her along got ways of making her talk
The deputies seize Hildy
She struggles
Look out, you -- (nervously) What's the use of fighting, Hildy
Hildy manages to get in a few resounding smacks on the deputies' faces
The reporters swarm around the struggling trio
There are shouts of: " got her
" "No, you don't
" "Aw, Hildy
", etc
In the struggle, Hildy suddenly drops her purse
It lands with a clank and comes open
gun is revealed on the floor
Hildy picks it up
Hey, she's got a gun
Look out, she's got a gun
The deputies and reporters start to close in on her cautiously
(trying to face in all directions) No, you don't
Walter
What is it
Here
She tosses the gun to Walter, but one of the deputies intercepts the throw
Gimme that
He takes the gun from the deputy
The Sheriff stands frozen, staring at the gun
(to Hildy) Where'd you get this
've got a right to carry a gun if want to
Not this gun
Burns comes into scene
(easily) can explain that, Hartman
When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams  thought it might be dangerous and  gave her a gun to defend herself
Oh, you did
Well, that's very, very interesting
This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with
What
What's that
Etc
(advancing on Sheriff) Are you trying to make me out a liar
(bitterly at Hildy) It's the last time  ever trust a woman, Hildy
Maybe Williams was gonna be her best man
That's pretty rotten, Hildy
Crossing your own pals
(shoving up to Hildy; trembling) Where is Earl Williams
Where you got him
(sympathetically) You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman
'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer
(outraged) What
With a bag of marshmallows
The Sheriff stands silent -- then hastily turns
Come on, Hildy
Where is he
This is a sweet trick, Hildy
thought we were friends
Etc
(to Sheriff) Look here, Pete
What about Mister Burns
Ask the Master Mind
What's he doing over here
(grabbing Burns' arm) Speak up
What do you know about this
(gently but firmly disengaging his hand) My dear Hartman
He moves casually to a post before the desk and maintains it
Can that
Where is he
(to Sheriff) The Morning Post is not obstructing justice or hiding criminals
You ought to know that
No
Well -- (turning to Hildy) Johnson, you're under arrest
(turning to Burns) You, too, Burns
(calmly) Who's under arrest
You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing
'll show you what 'm doing
Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post
'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff
We'll just start by impounding the Post property
(pointing to Bensinger's desk, addressing Hildy) Is that your desk
(jumping) No
(almost simultaneously) Yes
What are you afraid of Hildy dare him to move that desk out of here
Oh, you do, eh
(to deputies) All right, boys
Confiscate that desk
Several of the deputies start toward the desk
(trying to intercept deputies) Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, 'll put you behind bars
You will, eh
Well, we'll see about that
(to deputies) All right, boys
Take it
'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense
(to deputy nearest him) And you'll be an accessory
We'll take a chance on that, Burns
(to deputies) Go ahead, boys
(the deputies continue toward the desk) - Flanked by two policemen, Mrs
Baldwin, dishevelled, with her hat over one ear, is marching toward the Press Room, bound for vengeance
Bruce, considerably upset, is with her
As they reach the door to the Press Room, Mrs
Baldwin stops
You wait outside, Bruce
But, mother -- (firmly) No
You'll weaken when you see that little Jezebel
'm going to tell her what  think of her
She plumps her hat down more firmly on her head and marches into the Press Room followed by the two policemen
Bruce remains outside the door
Taking in door as it opens and Mrs
Baldwin, followed by the policemen, comes in
(leaping forward) Mother
(pointing out Burns to the officers) That man there
(hugging Mrs
Baldwin) Mother
Oh, 'm so glad to see you
Are you all right
Tell me
Mrs
Baldwin indignantly shakes her off
What's the idea here
This lady claims she was kidnapped
What
They dragged me all the way down the stairs -- Just a minute
Did -- did -- (points to Burns) -- this man have anything to do with it
He was the one in charge of everything
He told them to kidnap me
(amazed) Are you referring to me, Madam
You know you did
What about this, Burns
Kidnapping, eh
(round-eyed) Oh, trying to frame me, eh
never saw this woman before in my life
Oh, what a thing to say
was standing right here - after the girl jumped out of the window
Did you get the Mayor
He's coming over
(to Mrs
Baldwin) Now, Madam -- be honest
If you were out joy-riding, drunk, and got into some scrape, why don't you admit it, instead of accusing innocent people
(beginning to doubt her senses) You ruffian
How dare you say a thing like that
Please, Mother, he's just crazy
(to Sheriff) 'll tell you something more
'll tell you why they did it
(fidgeting) Come on, Sheriff
We've got to get bail
(continuing crescendo) was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them
They were hiding him
This is a bombshell
The room is electrified
Hiding him
In here
Murphy, followed by the reporters, comes into scene
Hiding him where
Mother
Where was he
Where'd they have him
Etc
at the desk
(with superb indignation) Madam, you're a cockeyed liar
And you know it
To emphasize his righteousness, he pounds on the desk three times, forgetting that that is his signal to Williams
Then, realizing what he has done, he gasps
Burns advances from desk, the others retreating before him
(anxiously) Come on, Sheriff, we've got to get bail
Three answering knocks come from the desk
They jump around to face the desk
(whispering) What was that
He's in the desk
-- For the love of -- He's in there
Etc
Aha
thought so
Stand back, everybody
Look out, Sheriff
He may shoot
Get your guns out
The policemen and deputies get out their guns
He's harmless
Don't take any chances
Shoot through the desk
He can't hurt anybody
You've got his gun
(panic-stricken) Oh, dear
Oh, dear
You grey-haired old Judas
Let me out
Let me out of here
She streaks for the door, flings it open and goes
The reporters tear out of scene to their telephones
(to policeman) You stand there
' City Desk
Quick
' Gimme the Desk
(to another policeman) You there
' City Desk
Hurry
' Gimme Emil
(to a Deputy, pointing with his gun toward the window) You cover the window
' Look out where you're pointing that gun
The Sheriff draws his men in around the desk, their guns drawn on it
' Lemme have the Desk
Quick
' Hold the wire
've got a flash for you
(to Hildy) Call Duffy
No, you don't
(to Sheriff, furiously) Do you want to get us scooped
' Emil
Hang on for a second
Now then, everybody aim at the center
And when  say three -- That's murder
(changing his mind) All right
Carl
Frank
One of you get on each side of the desk
Take hold of the cover
They do
Now then
We got you covered, Williams
Don't try to move
Now
Everybody quiet and ready for an emergency
'm going to count three
Hold it
Something coming up
One
Hold the phone
(into the phone) 'll have it in a minute
Two
(into phone) Right away now
(turning back to desk) Everybody ready
All right
Now then, up with it
Two deputies raise the cover
Williams is revealed, cowering in the desk, his hands over his face
The Sheriff rushes on him, jabbing his gun into him
Got you, Williams
(a wail) Go on -- shoot me
as the police and deputies come in to assist the Sheriff
The reporters are telephoning in, the police shouting -- all the voices mixing in, in incredible confusion, as the Sheriff rushes Williams to the door and takes him out
' Earl Williams was just captured in the Press Room of the Criminal Courts Building, hiding in a desk
(all talking at once) Grab him
That's him
Don't let him shoot
Stick 'em up
-- Etc
(into phone) Williams in a rolltop -- (into phone) -- nabbed Williams hiding -- ' -- found Williams' hiding place
' He offered no resistance
(into phone) Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered -- (into phone) -- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so -- ' -- trying to break through the cordon of police -- (into phone) Williams was unconscious when they opened the desk -- grabbing the Post phone
(into phone) Duffy
The Morning Post just turned Earl Williams over to the Sheriff
coming in the door with two policemen and leaping to get the phone away from Burns
, (into phone) Duffy
The Sheriff and police come into scene
(indicating Burns and Hildy) Put the cuffs on those two
The police handcuff Hildy and Burns
An anonymous note received by the Sheriff led to Williams' capture
More later
He hangs up
(into phone) An old sweetheart of Williams' doublecrossed him
Call you back
He hangs up
Where's that old lady
Hey, Madam
Where'd she go
Where's the old dame
Etc
, etc
They run out after Mrs
Baldwin, the Mayor entering just after they go
Burns and Hildy, handcuffed together, stand near the Sheriff
(into phone) Hello, girlie -- gimme Cooley
Quick
Hartwell, you're going to wish you'd never been born
The Mayor comes into scene
Fine work, Pete
You certainly delivered the goods
'm proud of you
(holding the phone) Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred
(happily) sight for sore eyes
(rolling in catnip) Aiding an escaped criminal
And a little charge of kidnapping 'm looking into
(into phone; suddenly) But that's the jail
There must be somebody there
Well
Looks like about ten years apiece for you birds
Does it
You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post
Your luck's not with you now
(into phone) Cooley
caught Williams single- handed -- we're going to proceed with the hanging per schedule
He wiggles the hook for another call
(to Mayor) You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag
(into phone) Give me the District Attorney's office
(to Burns) 'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary
(into phone) Hello, 'Arrasty
This is Hartwell
Come over to my office, will you
've just arrested a couple of important birds and  want to take their confessions
He hangs up
Burns makes a sudden lunge for the Morning Post phone and cries into it
(into phone) Duffy
Get Liebowitz
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you
This is the Morning Post you're talking to
(enjoying himself) The power of the press, huh
He laughs
Pinkus, the Governor's messenger, plentifully stewed, reels in the door
He approaches the Mayor and Sheriff who have their backs to him
(at the Mayor) Bigger men than you have found out what the power of the press is
President
Yes -- and Kings
(woozy; handing Sheriff the reprieve over his shoulder) Here's your reprieve
The Mayor and Sheriff spin around
(in a panic) Get out of here
You can't bribe me
What's this
Get out of here, you
won't
Here's your reprieve
What
don't want to be City Sealer don't like seals anyhow
They smell
Who is this man
(to an officer) Throw him out, Frank
(seizing Pinkus with her free hand) Who was bribing you
Burns also seizes Pinkus who is being pulled out of shape
They wouldn't take it
You're insane
(triumphant) What did  tell you
An unseen power
(to Pinkus) What's your name
Silas
Pinkus
You drunken idiot
Arrest him
The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that
It's a frame-up
Some imposter
Wait a minute
(to the officers) Let go there
(to Sheriff and Mayor) Murder, uh
Hanging an innocent man to win an election
That's a lie
never saw him before
(to Pinkus) When did you deliver this first
Who did you talk to
They started right in bribing me
Who's 'they'
(indicating the Mayor and Sheriff) Them
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr
Burns
He's talking like a child
Out of the mouths of babes
He's insane or drunk or something
Why, if this unfortunate man, Williams, has really been reprieved, personally am tickled to death
Aren't you, Pete
Go on, you'd kill your mother to get elected
That's a horrible thing to say, Miss Johnson, about anybody
(to Burns) Now, look here, Walter, you're an intelligent man -- (interrupting) Just a minute
(to Pinkus) All right, Mr
Pinkus
Let's have your story
Well,  been married for ten years and -- (interrupting) Skip all that
(loudly) Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete
That wasn't at all necessary
(springing to obey) was just going to
He gets the key from the officer
Walter,  can't tell you how badly feel about this
There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle
(unlocking the handcuffs) was only doing my duty
Nothing personal in it
They are set free
You guys better quit politics and take in washing
(looking over the reprieve) Sheriff, this document is authentic
Earl Williams has been reprieved, this Commonwealth has been spared the painful necessity of shedding blood
Save that for the Tribune
(to Pinkus) What did you say your name was -- Pinkus
That's right
He shows the Mayor a locket
Here's the picture of my wife
very fine-looking women
(mysteriously angered) She's good enough for me
And if was to go home and tell my wife -- understand perfectly, Mr
Pinkus, and as long as  am Mayor -- Which ought to be about three hours more, 'd say
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment
And your arrest
You'll each get about ten years,  think
Don't make any hasty decisions, Mr
Burns, you might run into a thumping big libel suit
You're going to run into the Governor
(trying to brush it off) Now, my old friend the Governor and understand each other perfectly
(eagerly) And so do
(with superb contempt) So do you what, you hoodoo
(to Pinkus, suavely) And now, Mr
Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve
The Sheriff, Pinkus and the Mayor go out of scene
(dreamily) Wait till those two future jailbirds read the Morning Post tomorrow
Walter turns to Hildy and they suddenly smile at each other
How was that for a tight squeeze
Don't tell me you were worried
Worried
was petrified
Weren't you
Uh-uh
As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us
Well, it's been a lot of fun
In a way
(laughs) mean -- working together
Just like the old days
The things we've been through, Hildy
We've certainly been in some swell jams
Remember the time we broke into the 's office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary
Yeah
What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory
Six scoop interviews
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician
We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we
(laughing) We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week
In the Shoreland Hotel
And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach
Don't remind me
That's how we happened to -- She breaks off
There is a moment's pause
Sorry, Hildy
didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee
That's all right, Walter
It's as much my fault as yours
(glancing at the clock) Bruce is making the nine o'clock train
told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself
Well, if it's my last story, 'd like it to be a good one
But -- guess  can't, Walter
Suit yourself, kid
This isn't for me to decide
Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning
Yeah
suppose  could
But, Walter -- He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy
Can't you give me another hour
don't know what to do, Walter
Flip a coin
All right
(takes coin from her bag) Heads  go -- tails  stay to write the story
Ready
gazing nervously at the hand holding the coin
Ready
She flips and catches the coin
She holds it tightly clasped in her hand, afraid to look
They stare at each other a second
(nervously) Well -- what is it
(almost breaking) What's the difference
'm going to write that story -- and you know it
She puts the coin away without looking at it
Burns rushes to her, tries to take her in his arms
Hildy
(furiously) Don't touch me
'm not doing it for you
(softly) Then why are you doing it
Because 'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me
: - Hildy typing away furiously
Copy Boy tearing sheets from her typewriter as she writes
Burns coming in and tearing sheets from typewriter
Linetype machines
Presses going
Headline:
: ' Headline:
Over this sound of newsboys calling "Extra
Extra
" to rest of story: "Impeachment Proceedings Launched Against Mayor For Attempting to Conceal Governor's Reprieve
" to the by-line -- By Hildegarde Johnson
to disclose Burns and Hildy looking at paper on Burns' desk
(enthusiastically) The greatest yarn ever written by anybody
My hat's off to you, Hildy
(grimly) Thanks
And what a way to quit
While you're still champion
That's the way to leave, Hildy
Yeah
Only -- only 'm not leaving, Walter
What do you mean
Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany
No, he won't
wired him that wasn't coming
Where'd you wire him
On the nine o'clock train
That's the one he took, isn't it
Sure
It's awfully clear now
Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace
couldn't do that for him, Walter
'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story
Is that job still open
Both jobs are open, Hildy
The paper -- and being Mrs
Walter Burns
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good
We tried it
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful
Only you expected it to be like other marriages
It can't be like other marriages -- we're different
We're a different world
Look at what we went through today
wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world
bet you wouldn't, either
fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir
And that other honeymoon in a coal mine
That's what makes it romantic
Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa
But us -- you never know where  am and 'm not sure where you are
That's Romance
Well, maybe 'd like to know just once
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right
We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls
(jumping) Niagara Falls
Walter, you don't mean that
Sure  do
And 'll tell you something else -- 'd like a baby
Walter
Sure,  can't last forever
want a son  can train to take my place on this paper
What would you do if it was a daughter
Well, if she looked like you -- Say
My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination
What's the matter with my brains
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist
Look, Hildy, 'm proposing to you
What do you say
Well, 'd like to be lady-like and think it over
don't want to rush you
Take a couple of seconds
Louie marches in with a judge, half-dressed
Louie has the judge in a tight grip
Hello, Judge
This is an outrage, Mr
Burns
Sending a gunman to kidnap me
Now, wait a minute, Judge
This isn't a kidnapping
You've got the legal power to perform a marriage ceremony, haven't you
What
Now don't argue, Hildy
(to Judge) How about it, Judge
Yes, but -- Then go ahead
Come on, Hildy
Nobody's going to rush me into anything
(as Louie sticks a gun in her ribs) You keep away from me
(but she's scared) All right, Judge
Reporters are standing on desks to watch through the glass partition of Burns' office
1ST 'll be doggoned
shotgun marriage
2ND Don't they usually keep the gun on the man
' reading the marriage ceremony
(continuing) " -- so long as you both do live
" will
That's what he said the last time
Don't believe him, Judge
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level
You're not fooling anybody
(continuing) "Hildegarde Johnson, will you have this man as your wedded husband, to live together in the ordinances and estate of Matrimony
" What would you do with a gun in your back
(poking her) Quiet
"Will you love him, comfort him, honor and keep him in sickness or in health; -- If  know where he is
" -- and, forsaking all others, keep thee only unto him, so long as you both do live
" will -- if he will
(to Burns) Have you got a ring
Burns starts searching his pockets, then, to Hildy: (he takes ring off) How about Bruce's
Walter, you can't do that
Sure,  can
Look at the policy gave him
(placing Bruce's ring on Hildy's finger) "With this ring  thee wed and with all my worldly goods  thee endow: And thereto  plight thee my troth
" Say, 'm surprised she got the ring back
' " -- pronounce you Man and Wife
" Burns throws his arms around Hildy and kisses her
Hildy, darling
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'
'm just a fool
That's what  am
know what it's going to be like
It'll be Heaven
Sure, Heaven
You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper
Hildy turns over copy of the extra lying on Burns' desk
She stops cold
Walter
:  -- "
" "Attempting to pass five hundred dollars worth of counterfeit money at the Union station, a man giving his name as Bruce Baldwin of Albany, New York, was arrested last night -- " Counterfeit money
That's the money you sent me, Walter
You -- you -- (starting to run) But, Hildy, listen -- Burns retreats from Hildy, she runs after him
He dashes through glass-paned door into adjoining office
Hildy throws her bag at him and it smashes the glass pane in the door
She is pursuing him around table similar to one in Burns' office
But, Hildy --  can explain -- You -- you
' think it's going to work out all right this time
