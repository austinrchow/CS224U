Written by Seth Macfarlane, Alec Sulkin & Wellesley Wild - As the Universal logo completes itself, we begin to slowly push in on the East Coast of the United States
The camera glides down through the atmosphere, through the clouds, closer and closer, until we begin to see large patches of snow covering the upper coastline
It's winter
We continue to push in, until we arrive at one small suburban neighborhood
Over the push-in, we hear the following narration, delivered by Patrick Stewart
(
) It has been said that magic vanished from our world a long time ago
And that humanity can no longer fulfill its desires through the power of wishes
To those who have lost the wondrous vision of childhood eyes, submitted here is the story of a little boy, and a magical Christmas wish that changed his life forever
/
- (
) It began in 1985, in a town just outside Boston
We see a    laughing and tossing snowballs at each other in the street
(
) It was Christmas Eve, and all the children were in high spirits
That special time of year when Boston children gather together and beat up the Jewish kids
Another little kid walks out of his house with a sled, and starts walking up the street
One of the snowball- throwing kids points at the sled kid
#1 Hey, Greenbaum
Uh oh
#1 It's Jesus' birthday tomorrow
You know what 'm gonna get him
what
() : #1 My fist in your fuckin' face
Why would Jesus want that
#2 Get him
The kids all chase Greenbaum up the street, and tackle him
Another boy,   (about 8 years old, shy and innocent-looking) approaches the melee
(
) But there was one child who wasn't in such good spirits
Little John Bennett
That one boy in every neighborhood who just has a tough time making friends
Hey guys, can  play
The kids all look at him
#1/#2/#3 Get outta here
/ Get outta here, Bennett
/ Get lost, Bennett
The Jewish kid, his face bloodied, looks angrily at John
Yeah, Bennett, get outta here
The kids go back to beating up Greenbaum, as John sadly walks back toward his house
'  - (
) John longed with all his heart for that one true friend that he could call his own
And he knew that if he ever found that friend, he would never let him go
John sadly sits by his window with his chin in his hands, looking outside
John'  - We see the other kids all playing in the snow: building snowmen, throwing snowballs, etc
At one point, a wheels up
The other kids welcome him with open arms, and he immediately joins in the fun
(
) Well, as it does every year, Christmas morning finally came
() () : (
) (') All the children were opening their gifts with holiday glee
- opens a present as her parents look on, smiling
Inside is a My Little Pony
She smiles with delight
- opens a present as   look on, smiling
Inside is a
Joe Hovercraft
The boy is overjoyed
- opens a present as his parents look on, smiling
Inside is a "Darth Vader head" action figure case
The boy opens it up, revealing that it's full of "Star Wars" action figures
The boy jumps around ecstatically
/
- - (
) And for little John Bennett, Christmas Day brought a very special new arrival
John sits amidst unwrapped gifts
We see him opening a present
Inside is a plush, adorable-looking teddy bear
The boy holds it with delight
Wow
hug him
' guess Santa paid attention to how good you were this year, huh
' ( ) Merry Christmas, John
John hugs the teddy bear
It makes a cutesy, high- pitched " wuv you" sound
John gasps with delight
() : He talks
John giggles happily, squeezing the bear to make it talk, as his mom and dad exchange a smile
(') 'm gonna name you Teddy
'  -   - John sits on the floor watching the 1980 film "Flash Gordon" on
He eats Twizzlers with Ted sitting next to him
Occasionally he gives Ted a "bite
" (
) John became instantly attached to Teddy
There was something about that bear that made him feel as if he finally had a friend with whom he could share his deepest secrets
'  - Hey Teddy
can  tell you something nobody knows
Teddy looks back at him, expressionless
(') Last week, my mom and dad took me to the park for a picnic
And they have this duck pond there, and
when nobody was looking,  pooped in my hand and threw it at a duck
Was that mean
He squeezes Ted, who once again makes the " wuv you" sound
(') ( ) love you too, Teddy
John gets into bed with the teddy bear, and snuggles with it
(') You know
wish you could really talk to me
Because then we could be best friends forever and ever
() : John drifts off to sleep
The camera moves toward the window, and drifts outside
It pulls back from the house slowly
(
) Now, if there's one thing you can be sure of
it's that nothing is more powerful than a young boy's wish
() Except an Apache helicopter
An Apache helicopter has machine guns and missiles
It is an unbelievably impressive complement of weaponry
An absolute death machine
Well, as it turned out, John picked the perfect night to make a wish
'  - The camera pivots around to face the sky
We see the snow falling from moonlit clouds
At the center of the clouds, there is a small patch of open air through which we can see stars
Suddenly, a shooting star whizzes by through the opening
'  - on the teddy bear's face as John lies sleeping next to it
: - The house and yard are covered with snow
'  - John slowly opens his eyes
He turns over to face Teddy, but we see that Teddy is no longer next to him
John bolts upright and looks around, frantically
Teddy
(beat, a bit more concerned) Teddy
() : John looks under the covers, but the bear is not there
He jumps out of bed and looks around the bed's perimeter, assuming that Teddy must have fallen off during the night
Finally, he checks underneath the bed we see John looking around
(') Teddy
John sits up again and freezes, looking right into the camera, wide eyed
'
: We see the face of Teddy staring right at him
Teddy blinks once
Hug me
John yelps and stumbles back, falling over
He stares at Teddy, breathing heavily
Did you
did you just talk
You're my best friend, John
() You're alive
Uh-huh
Whoa
Don't look so surprised
You're the one who wished for it, aren't you
Yeah,
did wish for it
Well, here  am
You mean
we get to be best friends
for real
For real
Forever and ever
() : Sounds good to me
huge grin spreads across John's face
He gets up, runs to Teddy and hugs him
(
) John was just about the happiest boy in the world
And he couldn't wait to tell everyone the good news
- John's Dad sits at the breakfast table, reading the paper as John's Mom prepares eggs and bacon, putting it on their plates
' Well,  think we had a wonderful Christmas this year
' One of the best
() And  particularly enjoyed the gift you gave me last night
John runs into the kitchen
Mom
Dad
Guess what
My teddy bear's alive
John's Mom and Dad look at each other and smile
' ( ) Really, sweetie
Well, that's exciting
No mom, he's alive
For real
Look
Teddy walks in and stands next to John
Merry Christmas, everybody
John's Dad scrambles to his feet, knocking plates off the table
John's mom screams
' Jesus
Fuck
() : Let's all be best friends
' Oh my god
' John, get away from that thing
Come over here, right now
-- ' John reluctantly walks over to his dad, who grabs him and protectively pulls him aside
'  (') Helen, get my gun
Dad, no
Is it a hugging gun
' Helen, get my gun, and call the police
'm sorry, Mr
Bennett
didn't mean to scare anybody
just wanted John and to be friends
Yeah, Dad
made a wish last night that Teddy was alive, and my wish came true
' ( ) My god, Steve
it's a miracle Christmas miracle
They stare at Teddy for a beat
(
) Well, it wasn't long before the story of John's little miracle was sweeping the nation
-  ( ) We see an 80's  behind the news desk graphic of the bear is over his left shoulder
Out of a Boston suburb comes what is, without a doubt, the most incredible story in the history of broadcast news
: -  ( ) We see an 80's
graphic of the bear is over her left shoulder
young boy's stuffed animal has magically come to life for as yet unknown reasons
Scientists are stumped as to how
AA18
-  ( ) AA18 We see a `70S   with a  that says "  "
He points manically at the graphic of the bear above his left shoulder
Look what Jesus did
Look what Jesus did
Look what Jesus did
-  ( ) and sit behind the desk
Between them, at the top of the screen, is a picture of the bear
(     ) The male newscaster turns sharply to her
(    ) He strikes her for an unclear reason
She buries her head in her hands, in shame
10 -  ( ) (
) Before long, Teddy had become a huge celebrity in his own right
We see   of "The Tonight Show" from the `80's, with Johnny Carson talking to Teddy, who is sitting in the guest chair (If appropriate footage is accessible, will include Teddy walking out on stage, shaking hands with Johnny and sitting down
) - '  - John and Teddy are in bed, under the covers with a flashlight
(
) But through all the fame, Teddy never forgot his very best friend, John
(
,  ) The thunder can't get us, right
(
,  ) Nope
We're thunder buddies
And the thunder knows it
We're totally safe
- we now see them
Teddy
Yeah, John
Do you promise we'll always be together
promise
Another thunder clap
(') Thunder buddies for life
Thunder buddies for life
() 11 : They hug as we   , dissolving through the covers
(
) And that was a promise that neither one of them ever forgot
Over the following, we continue to pull back from the room to the outside of the moonlit house
(
) So where are John and Teddy today
Well, let me put it this way: no matter how big a splash you make in this world, whether you're Corey Feldman, Frankie Muniz, Justin Bieber, or a talking teddy bear, eventually nobody gives a shit
: - We   the Boston skyline as the opening titles roll
various shots of the city throughout
to the streets below: several shots of the everyday bustle of the city, then we  : '  -  () Young John and Ted lie on the floor as they both grin at the camera, chins resting on their hands

" "'
" '  - Young John and Ted sit on the couch smiling and laughing as they watch the show
-  () Young John wears a hooded sweatshirt as he pedals his bike up the street
Ted sits in the front basket, like a People magazine from 1992 that reads, " ` 2's " Down below in smaller print it says "Plus, we talk to Ted the bear"
-  () Teenage John and Ted lean against a car
Teenage John looks indifferent and a bit jaded now
-  () John's high school graduation
() 13 : - The nightly news is in progress
news anchor addresses the camera
graphic next to her reads "    ", with an unflattering photo of Ted
-  () We see Ted getting hauled away by security
caption below reads "Ted caught with mushrooms at airport security"
He's putting up a bit of a fight, and gives the "finger" to the camera (the finger is pixilated)
'  -  ( ) We see 20 year-old John sitting on his bed, laughing
Ted sits by his side, also laughing at the incident
-  ( ) (Insert existing "Phantom Menace" bit) -  ( ) (Insert existing Chuck
Cheese bit) :   to the status indicator
It reads, "In a Relationship With Lori Collins
" An arrow clicks on her name, going to her page
On her wall, it reads "Lori has added 3 new photos in the album Mobile Uploads"
-  () Lori and John smile as Lori holds a big stuffed bear that John has won for her at a booth
Ted stands nearby, arms crossed, with a deep, disapproving scowl
-  () In the photo, presumably taken by John, Lori stands laughing as Ted stands behind her (standing on something) covering her eyes with his paws
14 -  () John and Lori are set for a trail ride
They are both on horses, wearing helmets
Ted, who also wears a helmet, but rides a smiling golden retriever
-  ( ) John, Lori, and Ted play miniature golf
Lori putts the ball, which rolls to the lip of the cup
She reacts, disappointed
Ted makes a graceful leg sweep, pushing the ball into the cup "accidentally"
Lori smiles
John smiles back at her
Ted winks
-  ( ) (Insert "Jeter sucks" bit) -  ( ) - John, Lori and Ted sit outside at a table, each holding an ice cream cone
They stare deadpan at the camera, each with a dab of ice cream on their noses, and a dab of ice cream on their upper lips
/
-   '  - '  - John and Lori paint the apartment walls
Lori sneaks up behind John, and paints his back
John turns around and grabs her
They scuffle playfully, and then kiss
We Ted, who stands on a little stepladder hammering a "Home Sweet Home" picture into the wall
He steps back, but realizes he has nailed his hand to the wall
He tugs, slips, and the ladder falls
Ted hangs there like an idiot
'  -  () John, Lori, and Ted sit on the couch
All three sit with their legs crossed, faux-pretentiously raising glasses of Jorian Hill Syrah to camera in identical poses, the wine bottle on the table in front of them
15 '  -  () We see a photo Ted has taken of himself
In the background are John and Lori, playing Scrabble
Ted is in the foreground, smiling at the camera as he holds up his letters
He has spelled out the word "", with an extra  and  to spare
'  - John, Ted, and Lori watch a horror movie on the couch
-  ( ) (Insert existing John/Lori swan boat footage
) /
'  - '  - a bong
Ted, who inhales, his snout inside the tube
Ted sits on the sofa, and for the first time, we see Ted in his present day form: he is ratty, patched-up, and worn-looking
He has a couple stains, some small spots of exposed stuffing, and there's evidence of some half-assed sewing
It's obvious he's been around for three decades
He and John, who sits next to him, are both clearly stoned as we join them
John, for his part, looks far too comfortable in the too- worn Red Sox -shirt he wears
He eats directly from a box of Fruity Pebbles
Reaching in for a last handful, he finds the box almost empty
He raises it to empty the remainder into his mouth, and accidentally pours Fruity Pebbles all over his face
It doesn't faze him much, though, as he brushes them off
It's quite obvious that this is a guy who has never really given up his childhood
and has never given up his teddy bear
Ted passes the bong to John
All 'm sayin' is Boston women are are, on the whole, a paler, uglier sort than women from the elsewheres of life
That's bullshit, what about Lori
She's hot
Lori's from Pennsylvania, not a Boston girl
() 16 : They're not that bad
John takes a hit from the bong over Ted's next line
The fact that you have to say they're not that bad means that they are that bad
They turn into drunk, half-white, half- pink monsters after 2 hours at any beach
Ted takes a hit from the bong
(') () Jesus, this is weak
It's not even gettin' me high
gotta have a talk with my weed guy
-- It's workin' for me
think it sucks, 'm gonna have a talk with him
Yeah,  don't know that you wanna go to a drug dealer with complaints
No,  know this guy a long time
've known him since 9/11
Remember,  was like, "Aw, shit
9/11
gotta get high
" (looks at his watch) Oh fuck, is it nine-thirty
Shit, gotta get to work
John gets up, and hurries into the other room to get dressed
Hey, you mind pickin' up a bird feeder on the way home
wanna start enjoying the beauty of birds
(
) Jesus,  don't know if  can drive
'll drive you,  feel fine
17 - We see two shots of John's car driving through the city: We see John in the passenger's seat putting Visine into his eyes, with only Ted's ears and eyes showing as he drives (his paws grip the wheel)
We then cut to an overhead pull-back shot as we move away from the car to reveal it crossing Boston's huge suspension bridge
-- - John's car pulls up the street and into the parking lot, scraping its side against the corner headlight of one of the rental cars
/ Aw, Jesus
/ Fuck
Ted's feet
There are wooden blocks attached to the pedals so that his feet can reach them
He slams on the brakes
John gets out, and looks at the damage
Aw, man
Is it bad
It's not good
--  - , the branch manager, an intense, middle-aged man, is standing in the doorway
John
May  speak with you, please
Shit
It's okay, go, go, 'll pull outta here
() Hi, Thomas
How are ya
Thomas dryly waves back
Ted pulls forward, scraping the car again
He abruptly pulls out into traffic, and another car swerves a bit to get around him, honking
Asshole
() 18 : () Easy, Jersey license
Ted drives away
'  - Thomas sits at his desk facing John
John, it's almost ten o'clock
know, 'm sorry, it wasn't my fault
What do you mean
() guess
wasn't really prepared for a follow-up question
John, all you have to do is not fuck up, and you get my job when  go to corporate next month
You will be the new branch manager
All you have to do is not fuck up, and all you're doing is fucking up
Not that  don't think you're too fucked up to handle not fucking up my job, but you happen to be the least fucked-up person in the whole office
The next least fucked-up is Alix, and you've been here three fucking years longer than him
But 'm telling you,  will promote the fuck out of him if you fuck up one more time
That is all
Fuck
Sir,  promise, you're not gonna regret promoting the fuck out of me
Good
like hearing that
Because in a month my life now could be your life: a cushy $38,000-a-year branch manager who's personal friends with Tom Skerritt
It's not a bad life, is it
--no
() 19 : Did you know 'm friends with Tom Skerritt
No
'll show you something  don't show too many people, because  don't want anyone treating me differently
Thomas takes out a framed picture of himself with Tom Skerritt
(') That's me and Tom Skerritt
( ) Wowwww
Goddamn right, wow
Now get outta here
'm gonna dock you for being late, and for the scratch on that car
Try and be a little more responsible tomorrow
will, sir
Thank you
won't let you down, Goose
What
Top Gun
So
Tom Skerritt
Oh
John exits
--   - John emerges from Thomas' office, and walks out into the front desk area
() 20 : We see his coworker, Guy (a burly Patrick-Warburton type), handing a car key and a rental envelope to a pleasant-looking couple
He looks tired, disheveled, and a little bruised
There you go, here's your key and rental agreement, and a complimentary map of Boston
Thanks for choosing Liberty, drive safely
/ Thank you
/Thanks so much
The couple exits
Guy turns to face John
Hey, heard you got busted
Jesus, Guy, you look like shit, what happened
don't know, man
got fuckin' wasted last night, and my phone says  texted somebody at 3:15 asking them to beat me up
And then at 4:30  texted the same person saying thanks
And you don't remember it
No
Same as last time
It
it just seems gay, doesn't it
don't know
Maybe, yeah
Do you think you're part of some, like, gay beat-up underworld
Like one of those gay beat-up clubs
don't know
dig chicks
don't remember any of it,  was so fucked up
might be gay,  don't know
You mind covering for me for a bit
'm gonna go lay down in the john
() 21 : Guy starts to leave, when , a foreign guy with a vague European accent, long dark hair, and a great tan walks up
Hey you buddies
Where's it hanging
/ Hey Alix
/ Hey, how was the club last night
Ah,  didn't get in because the bouncer was doucheface, but  made friends in the line
Oh, well, that's good  guess
We see , an unbelievably gorgeous salesgirl, enter from the back with a set of keys
Hi you guys
Over the following, Tanya puts the keys away, walks over to her station and sits
You look so pretty today
Aw, thanks Alix,  worked out this morning
can tell, you are less fat than you have been
Hey guys, does anybody know a nice restaurant
Like something where the napkins are cloth
For what
Lori and  have been dating four years tomorrow, and  wanted to take her someplace nice
Oh wow, congratulations, John
() 22 : You guys`ve been goin' out for four years
Yeah
' -- (-) --saaaane, my longest relationship was like six months, and then she farted in her sleep
'm like,  am outta here, man
Was gone before she woke up
Wow, you're
not very tolerant, huh
Lori ever fart in front of you
Yes
Really
Yes
Many times
You Italian
No
Oh
Why
dunno, just seems like-- never mind, take her to Benihana
Don't you think after four years, maybe she's probably hoping for something more than dinner
Like what
() 23 : Well, if  were her, 'd be expecting a proposal
Oh come on, nobody's expecting anybody to propose
Marriage isn't
mean, isn't love enough
submit that love is enough
You could put the ring in her ass and let her fart it out
/
'  - '  - John and Ted sit on the couch, in the same exact spots we saw them earlier, bookending the day
John drinks a beer as they watch
Ted lights up a bong and inhales
The blares the opening titles of the 1980 film "Flash Gordon
" As "Flash's Theme" plays: So bad, but so good
Yes, a study in contrasts
Oh,  love this part
( ) '
( ) ( ) '     / Fuck yeah, Flash
(then) Hey, before forget, let's nail down a plan for the Bruins game tomorrow night
can't, 'm taking Lori to dinner
() 24 : For what
Well, we've been dating four years tomorrow
Oh, fuck me
Nice
Lemme ask you something
you don't think she's gonna be expecting something
big, do you
() What, like anal
No, like
a circular gold thing on the finger
Oh, fuck that
It's four years
You and have been together 27 years
Ted jumps on John, and starts playfully punching him in the face
(') Where's my ring, Johnny
Where's my ring, asshole
Stop it
Jesus Christ, knock it off
He throws Ted off of him
(') mean, do you think she might be expecting me to make that kinda move
No, John
It's a bad idea
And it's the wrong time
What with the economy and
the credit bubble
the Supreme Court
mean, look at Haiti
guess  didn't think about that
- We see Flash Gordon facing Ming the Merciless
() 25 : ( ) Who are you
( ) Flash Gordon
Quarterback
New York Jets
This is the American fantasy, right here
professional  player is called upon to save the world
Tom Brady could do that
Tom Brady could do that
The front door opens and , an attractive girl in her mid to late 20's, enters holding several grocery bags
Hi guys
Hey, sweetie
Hey, Lori
John gets up and gives Lori a kiss
Ooh
think you just got me stoned
(: ) What do we got there
Turkey burgers
Oh
Okay
Are we having homos over for dinner or something
() No, just you homos
/ Whoa
() 26 : She's funny, John
You got yourself a regular Toni Collette
Wait, who's that
Is that good
She's a comedienne
Oh nice
Is she pretty
She's as pretty as she is funny
How was work
Good
How's your dickhead boss
Rex is fine
He only hit on me once today, so that's good
'm not saying this to be mean, but really hope that fucker gets leukemia
He's harmless,  can handle it
Hey Johnny, while you're up, grab me a beer, huh
(crossing to fridge) Oh yeah, a coupla' Charles Brew-Kowskis
Yes, a Brew-stoy-ovski would be nice right about now
We see Lori roll her eyes
She's heard this before
Jesus
Maybe a Mike Brew-ga-slow-ski
() 27 : Perhaps a Ted Kazyn-brewski
'know,  think  might also have a Martina Navra-ti-brewski
/ Ohhhh, that doesn't work
/Come on, don't ruin it, yeah, that doesn't work
Bullshit, what do you mean
It doesn't work, the name has to have a "ski" at the end of it
You just put "brewski" on the end of Martina Navratolova
thought we were just doing funny names
No, it's gotta have a "ski" at the end
Otherwise where's the challenge
If there's no "ski" at the end of the root word, then we would just be idiots saying nonsense
/
'  - It's raining, with an occasional roll of thunder
'  - Lori lies in bed holding an iPad, reading a gossip news site, with the  on
John comes out of the bathroom, and cozies up next to her
( ) Oh, look, they found those missing hikers
They did
What happened
It says they got separated and one of them had his foot trapped under a rock for five days
() 28 : You know, if your leg got trapped under a rock, 'd chew it off to get you free
() You would
sure would
() Is that cannibalism
No,  think it's only cannibalism if you swallow
Oh yeah, no,  don't swallow
She laughs
Really
That's not what  heard about you
It's not true, 'm a fuckin' classy broad
( ) can see that
() 'know, speaking of classy, Ciao Bella's a really expensive restaurant
If you want, we can go somewhere else tomorrow night
don't care, as long as we're together
You kiddin' me
Four years we been going out, 'm takin' you to the best place in town
been crappin' out room for it for two days,  know exactly what 'm gonna order
(leaning in to kiss him) You're disgusting
And you get to pick any bottle of wine
() 29 : Ooh
Any bottle of 2012 wine
Oh, are the new wines in
They are in and they
Are
Fresh
She leans over and kisses him again
He kisses her back
(') love you
love you, too
They continue to kiss, becoming more and more intimate
She starts to pull his -shirt off, when there is a thunder clap from outside
Ah, come on
(shaking her head) don't understand it, 35 years old, and you're still scared of a little thunder
am not
We hear another thunderclap
Ted runs into the room with no warning and leaps into bed, right between Lori and John
Thunder buddies for life, right Johnny
'mon, let's sing the thunder song
/ () , ' / : ,      / '   , ` ' '
Boomp
() 30 : Lori rolls over and goes to sleep with a groan
/
- Lori enters the building
- Lori gets off the elevator, where we see several signs that read "
" Lori goes to her desk, looking exhausted
Lori's office friends, , , and  approach
Wow
Baby, 'm not saying this to be nasty, but you look really tired
Oh, 'm okay
except  didn't have time for breakfast, the garage was full, spilled coffee on my leg, and  have a boyfriend who can't sleep through a storm without his teddy bear
don't understand why you keep putting up with him
Yeah,  mean, the guy's thirty-five years old and he's working for a rental car service
No, it's not that,  don't care about that
'd love him even if he was a janitor
mean, he's got a huge heart, we laugh together all the time, and it's just a bonus that he's like the hottest guy in Boston
Yeah but the hottest guy in Boston is like being the classiest Kardashian
just wish he could get his life together, you know
Our life
And he can't, and  swear to god, it's all because of that bear
() 31 : You should give him an ultimatum: it's you or the bear
can't do that, he'd be devastated
And mean
what if he chose Ted
Oh come on, you don't really think that
Not really, but what if
Well then
things happen for a reason
No they don't
That's just something girls say when something bad happens to them that they don't understand
Fuck off, Tracy
- Lori's boss  (asshole handsome, mid-30's, expensive suit) walks into the office, and approaches the gathering of female employees
Well hello there
Sorry if 'm interrupting any private girl talk about Channing Tatum's index finger but Lori need to see you in my office
Actually Rex,  have a lot of work  need to get to-- Oh, this is work,  swear
() Okay, fine
Lori follows Rex and gives the girls a "help
" look
He's such an asshole
() 32 : Out of control
Such a sleaze
You guys are so pathetic
You're shitting on Rex, and you both had sex with him
Short beat
/ Like once
/ was drunk
And so did you
Well,  didn't want one of you whores getting promoted before me
'  - Lori sits across from Rex, who sits at a large desk
So
what do you need to talk to me about, Rex
Rex takes a framed picture out of a drawer, and shows it to her
See that
That's me on the diving team in high school
We dove the shit outta that pool that year
If you look close, you can see the outline of my root
() You promised this was about work
Lori, what is wrong with you
Why don't you like me
'm rich, 'm good-looking, my dad owns the company-- have a boyfriend, Rex
think you know this
Yeah, the guy with the teddy bear, that's a cute relationship, but 'm talking about being with a real man, Lori
() () 33 : (') Someone who wears a blazer on an airplane
( ) 'm very busy
Well then, how do you have all that time to be in my head
Goodbye, Rex
Lori exits Rex's office
Rex casually gets up, strolls over to her chair, nonchalantly brushes his hand on the cushion where she was sitting, and nonchalantly smells his hand
/
,   - - John and Lori sit across from each other at a romantically set table
They've just finished their meal
John has the remains of a lobster shell on his plate
( ) That was perfect
approaches
Would you like me to wrap up your leftovers
Oh no, 'm fine, thanks
John holds up the front portion of the lobster shell, which has the face and eyes on it
Actually, could you wrap just this up for me
wanna scare the shit outta somebody
() Sure
() 34 : The waitress walks away
( ) What are you, five years old
Yeah, but  read at a six year-old level
Another  approaches with a bottle of champagne, two glasses, and some chocolate-covered strawberries
Senor
Senora, here is your dessert and champagne
Ooh, Cristal
It's a special night
We've been dating for four years
( ) And hey, all those rich black people can't be wrong, right
It doesn't seem like four years, does it
(affectionately taking her ) No, it doesn't
You had no business being out on that dance floor, but 'm glad you were
-  () We see Lori out on the dance floor, amidst a sea of dancing clubgoers
Nearby, we see John dancing with a girl, and doing it very badly
He's putting too much into it, obviously trying to impress her
The girl is gamely tolerating it, but is clearly not digging the moves
John thrusts his butt back in one move, accidentally bumping a girl behind him with enough force to send her sprawling on the floor
As the crowd reacts to this, we see that it is Lori
She starts to get up, when John turns and rushes to help her to her feet
Oh my god, are you okay
Oh god, 'm so sorry
() 35 : (a little stunned) Yeah, 'm
'm fine
Oh Jesus, 'm so so sorry
didn't see you
It was an accident
Well, yeah,
would hope it was an accident
Did you hurt your head
Um, yes
My head hurts a lot
Oh, man
Here, let me get you some ice
She sits down
He reaches into a nearby glass, pulls out a handful of ice, and wraps it in a napkin
He puts it against her head
She inhales sharply for a moment
(') Sorry
Does it hurt
(beat, noticing him for the ) No
No it's okay
(beat, noticing too) 'm
'm John
'm Lori
They smile at each other
-  (  ) Okay, here's a question that'll show how much you actually care about me
You remember we stayed and talked until the place closed, and then we went for late night eggs and waffles, and we stayed there til 5 a
m
watching a movie on the little  in the diner
Name the movie
() 36 : Octopussy
Gold star
But does that show that  care about you, or  care about Roger Moore
'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt
Thank you
And by the way, my dancing was not that bad
() Your dancing was bad
had some cool moves
So do people with Parkinson's
That's not how  remember it
Yeah, how do you remember it
-  () We see John leaning against the bar, wearing a white Navy officer's uniform, a la Ted Stryker in "Airplane
" as "Stayin' Alive" blasts from the jukebox
, who is up on the dance floor, done up like Julie Hagerty
John takes his hat off, and tosses it
coolly
He struts up to the dance floor, locks eyes with Lori
They circle one another for a beat
John suavely takes off his jacket, twirls it in the air a few times, and tosses it
He then strikes a "finger up" disco pose, with a bullet
He and Lori begin disco dancing simultaneously
He jumps up, locking his legs around Lori, who spins him around in circles, as we cut back to: -  (  ) Whatever you say, baby
() 37 : Hey, here's to four more years, huh
They clink glasses, and take a sip
(') Now  know we said no gifts, but-- No, we didn't
--But,  got you something anyway, in clear violation of the "no gift" rule
There was no such rule
John reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a small box
Lori looks excited
Lori, 've wanted to give this to you for a long time
John slides the box over to Lori
She picks it up
Oh, John
Lori unwraps the box and opens it
Inside is a pair of nice, but not-super-expensive-looking earrings
Those are the ones you liked, right
From that kiosk at the mall
Oh
Yeah
Check out the card
She opens up the card, which we see as John describes it
It says, "Happy 4 year anniversary
Love you
" (') See,  even wrote the words with different colored markers so you wouldn't get bored while you were reading it
() Great
Thanks
Well, um, here
This is for you
() 38 : Lori hands John a small box
He opens it up, revealing a very nice watch
( ) Oh wow, a Hamilton
He puts it on his wrist
remember you liked it when you saw Tom Brady wearing one in
Yeah,  mean his was analog, but this is so awesome,  love it
She reacts a bit to this
(') 'know, Lori
( ) Someday, there's gonna be a ring in there
But  wanna wait `til  can get you something really special, y'know just don't have the money right now
John,  don't need the Hope diamond, all want is-- know, but it's important to me that you have the engagement ring you deserve
And what with the credit bubble
the Supreme Court
mean, look at Haiti
Look, 'm only saying this because  love you, but that's not realistic
You're never gonna have any kind of a career if you're always partying and wasting time with Ted
Oh, Jesus, here we go-- John, please get him to find his own place, so we can get on with our lives
Look, can we talk about this another time, and just enjoy our anniversary dinner
() 39 : Yeah
Fine
Let's talk about it ten years from now
(rolling his eyes with a ) Lori, we can't talk about this every time we go out
Look, he's been my best friend since  was eight
And  was not a popular child
You have to understand, had no friends before he came along
He's the only reason  ever gained any fucking confidence
coulda wound up like that Asian kid at Virginia Tech, but didn't
`Cause of him
So, y'know, 'm not that psyched to just, like, kick him out
Well, it's good to know that a talking teddy bear is the only thing that kept you from gunning down your classmates, but John, you're not eight
You're thirty-five
And unless you're too blind to notice, he's not your only friend anymore
You have me
And  love you
love you, too
You know that
Look, 've put the best physical years of my life into this
mean, 'm cute now, but in a few years my body's gonna fall off a fucking cliff
Things'll be hanging and stretching in ways that might scare a man
need to feel secure in the fact that you won't leave me when that happens
Not only will  not leave you, it's gonna be even better
`Cause  can have sex with you, and press your arm fat against a comic book so  can see it backwards
She laughs
So does he
And, my boobs and vagina will all be in the same place, so that's a lot less movin' around for you
() 40 : can do it all with one hand
Exactly, and you can do whatever you want with the other hand
can write a novel
Maybe a bestseller
We can achieve critical acclaim and become rich just by screwing each other
They both laugh hard
Well,  hope these jokes have distracted you from the actual problems in our relationship
() We can't put the real conversation off forever, John
dunno,  got a lotta fuckin' jokes
'   - Their car pulls up
They start to get out
() Ah shit, hang on, my phone fell under the seat somewhere
Can you call it
Lori punches his number on her cellphone
After a beat, we hear The Imperial March from "The Empire Strikes Back
" That's my ringtone
(laughs, embarrassed) Oh, yeah
What is it
It sounds negative
() 41 : No, it's from The Notebook
He reaches under the seat, fishing for the phone, as she goes inside
(') () This is gonna take some doin'
All right, well 'll see you upstairs
He continues digging for the phone, as she walks inside
- Lori walks toward the apartment, but stops as she hears loud music coming from inside
She approaches the door cautiously and opens it, revealing
'  - Lori enters a haze of pot smoke, and a very much trashed apartment (empty bottles, wrappers, etc
)
Ted sits on the sofa with a small group of trashy-looking women
They're watching "Romancing the Stone," which plays very loudly on the
What the hell is all this
Lori
Hey, you're home early
The ladies and  were just watching "Romancing the Stone
" Got it on Blu- Ray
Came in a two-pack with "Jewel of the Nile," but  don't know that we'll end up watchin' that one
This place is a wreck
Who are these girls
Oh, where are my manners
Lori, this is Angelique, Heavenly, Cherene, and Sauvignon Blanc
love you girls
'know, somewhere out there are four terrible fathers  wish  could thank for this great night
The girls ad-lib "Hello," "Nice to meet you," etc
() 42 : Lori glances around the room, then  as she sees something in the corner
What is that
What's what
There is
a shit in the corner
On the floor
There's a shit
( ) Oh man, that's what Dierdre was doin' over there in the corner for so long
Remember, she was crouched over there and thought she was just makin' a call or '-- There is a shit
On my floor
Yeah, she's passed out in the bathroom now, she seemed like she was hopped up on somethin'
mean, mystery solved, -- What the fuck
Lori, if  can-- now this is just speculation, but
is it possible that this is not so much about the stool in the corner, and more about maybe tonight's dinner not measuring up to your expectations
What
The fuck
Lori is speechless with rage
At that moment, we see the lobster head poke in aggressively from behind the door
(
) () Ahaaaaa
() 43 : (
,  ) Who lives here
'm comin' to get whoever lives here
You owe me lobster money
( ) Hahaaa
That's my friend John
Not the lobster, the guy runnin' it
At that moment, John enters, holding his cell phone
Found my phone
He stops, seeing everyone there
(') What's goin' on
(then, noticing) Is that a shit
/
- - Ted and John walk slowly down the ramp circling the massive see-through tank, occasionally stopping to observe some of the more bizarre varieties of fish
John is oddly restrained
Something is on his mind
As they stroll, we see a nearby man keeping an eye on them
He seems much more interested in them than in the fish
This, we will find out later, is
God, there are some fucked up fish out there
Yeah
Jesus, look at that one
Mister tough guy fish
(tough guy voice:) "Hey
Whatsa big idea
Cold fusion
Well that is a big idea,  beg pardon
" Look at that guy
-y white guy fish
(tight-ass white guy voice:) " don't care for some of Conan 'Brien's humor
don't like Irish humor
And this food is too flavorful
don't care for flavor in my food
" () () 44 : (') (switching to goofy voice as a bottle-nosed fish swims ) "Oh hey, sorry 'm late, guys
Hey, where's everybody goin'
Any of you guys got a tissue
'm allergic to water
" Ted
you gotta move out
Ted turns and stares at John for a beat
Wh
what
It's
it's gotta happen
Ted sits down on a bench, a little stunned and dazed
What
what did  do
John looks heartbroken at this response
- Ted and John sit side-by-side on a bench next to the penguin habitat
Ted, my relationship is at a very delicate stage, and, y'know, Lori and may just need a little space right now
Plus a hooker took a shit in our apartment
Hey, look, that was a tough night for all of us
'  -  - Lori is staring at the
poop in the corner
She is trying to pick it up with a shoebox
In the background, we can see an almost panicky, grossed-out John peering out from behind the bathroom door
( ) Oh, god
() 45 : Aaaa, what
It's so gross
Don't tell me,  don't wanna hear about it
Did you get it
No
Oh my god
Tell me when you get it
,  got some on my thumb
You can never cook with that hand again
'm serious, learn to cook other- handed
Shit
'll get the next one, okay
- She's makin' you do it, isn't she
(giving up the bullshit) Yes
But, that doesn't mean we can't hang out
We'll hang out all the time
What about
thunder buddies for life, Johnny
know
Fuck
just don't know what to do here
know it sucks, but otherwise 'm gonna lose her
And  do love her, Ted
() know you do, Johnny
() 46 : 'll help you get on your feet out there, promise
And we'll hang out a lot, right
Fuck, all the time
(arms wide for a hug) Bring it over here
John hugs Ted
Ted hugs him back
We hear a squeak, and a high-pitched recorded voice saying " wuv you
" John and Ted pull away from each other uncomfortably
(') That was the-- the thing-- The old-- Yeah-- no,  know- that doesn't mean-- 'm not - gay
We've got to get you a job
/
- - John and Ted head toward the store
Ted is dressed in a coat and tie, and looks very uncomfortable
look stupid
No, you don't
You look dapper
look like Snuggles' accountant
They pause as John straightens Ted's tie
Look,  know it sucks, but you gotta make some money so you can pay for an apartment
don't wanna work at a grocery store
() 47 : Well, you have no skills
told you,  can totally be a lawyer
As  said, you would need a law degree from a law school
'm a special case
'm a fucking talking bear
They might make an exception `cause they're all like, "Aaa
This bear can talk and do stuff
Let's give him a job and maybe he'll give us a few laughs," but then they're surprised at what a stellar performance 'm turnin' in
And then they practically have to give me the Anderson case
Look, you get the job, and we'll celebrate after
John discreetly pulls out a baggie of weed
And if  don't get the job will we still smoke that pot
Probably, yes
(patting John on the leg) Yeah
Okay, good speech, coach
'  - Ted sits opposite , the grocery store manager
We see his name and title on a desk nameplate
Frank sits at the desk, staring at Ted
So
You think you got what it takes
Nope
(a beat, then) No one's ever talked to me like that before
You're hired
() 48 : Shit
- (Over music:) John and Ted walk across the Common, passing various park-goers
The occasional person notices and points with a "Hey, isn't that
" sort of look
They passes three cute girls who flag Ted down
Two pose with him as the third takes their picture with her cellphone
Ted poses for the photo with one hand on the girl's breast
She laughs hard
Ted waves goodbye, and he and John make their way over to a park bench
They sit
John takes out the weed, looks around for a beat, then starts to discreetly roll a joint
Well, 'm a former celebrity with a minimum wage job
This must be what the cast of Different Strokes feels like
Excuse me
John and Ted react, startled
John stuffs the weed in his pocket, accidentally dropping the buds in the rolling papers on the ground
a creepy-looking man glancing at them repeatedly
This is Donny, the fat kid we saw in the prologue
He has grown up into a thinner but no less creepy man
'm sorry to bother you, but my son and couldn't help but admire your teddy bear
his son, who looks exactly like fat young Donny from earlier
(a little uncomfortable) Oh
Um, thank you
'm Donny
And this is my boy, Robert
have to tell you, 've been fascinated by your story ever since  was a boy remember seeing you on the Carson show
You were just wonderful
the ground, where a pigeon is pecking at the dropped weed
() 49 : Yeah, that was ah
that was a good time
( ) wonder, is there any chance  could purchase the bear from you
For my son
/ Huh
/ Excuse me
() want it
Hey, 'm not an "it", pal
'm a "he
" (leaning down to his level) 'm sorry, little guy, but my bear isn't for sale
've had him since  was about your age
He's very special to me
Sit up straight when you talk to me
() Ew, why the fuck did he say that
Don't swear in front of my child
Now
We are very interested in the bear
If you'd like to work out some sort of arrangement, here's my address and phone number
He writes on a slip of paper and hands it to John
John smiles awkwardly and puts it in his wallet
Okay
Will do
Here it goes, in the really important pocket for really important stuff
Donny and Robert walk off
Donny turns and steals a glance back at Ted as they move off
Wow
Can you imagine what that little shit would do to me
() 50 : Oh man,  can totally see him just taking you down to the basement and really slowly de-limbing you while singing some creepy Victorian nursery rhyme
John tugs on one of Ted's arms trying to creep him out
He then breaks into a creepy falsetto
(') ,   / / Fuck you
Why do you have to take it so far
Now it's real
Fuck you again for that
'mon, let's go find a better place to get stoned
They exit
After a beat, the pigeon flies into frame, slamming right into a fucking tree
- John and Ted walk into the building
John carries two cardboard boxes, and Ted carries one smaller one
- There's a couch, a coffee table, and a couple of boxes
John and Ted put down their boxes, and stand just inside the doorway
Well
guess this is it, huh
Yeah, sure is
First night on your own
Yeah
First night in my beautiful new apartment
They say they're ain't hardly been no murders here
They awkwardly nod to each other, both knowing that John must leave soon
Okay
so
if you need anything
() 51 : know
Seriously, anything
know
'll be fine, Johnny
() know you will, buddy
They regard each other for a moment, then John slowly turns and walks off down the hall
He turns back to smile and wave
From John's , we see a diminutive- looking Ted give a wan wave back
He looks very alone as the camera recedes
'   - John sits on the couch, putting his tie on as he watches Lori comes over and sits down next to him
Hey there
Hey
Listen
just wanna say thank you
What you did with Ted was a big step, and know it wasn't easy, but  just want you to know that  love you for it
And, think this a new beginning for our relationship
Hey, anything for you
This is all part of the new grown up, adult John Bennett
So, get used to him
She gives him a kiss, and starts to undo his tie
'know,  don't have to be at work for another twenty minutes
(guiding her down onto the ) Ooh, that's perfect, 'm only gonna need one
() 52 : She laughs, and they kiss
You know what my favorite thing about you is
After four years, you can still surprise me
To step up and change such a big part of your life just to make your girlfriend happier
dunno,  bet you most guys couldn't do it
Most guys don't have you to motivate `em
'm sorry if  was pushy about it
No, you were right
Look, the reason love you so much is the same reason guess  take you for granted sometimes
It's `cause you're
inevitable
(huh
) Inevitable
Well, that's
romantic think
No, what  mean is, there's just no version of this universe where you and don't end up together
You're inevitable
That sounds like something Stephen Hawking would say to his girlfriend
But do you get what 'm saying
Yeah,  do
And  feel exactly the same way about you
They kiss
(') (smiling coyly, as she ) Ooh
Is that a Flash Gordon ray gun in your pocket or are you glad to see me
John pulls the Flash Gordon gun out of his pocket and shows it to her
She cracks up
53 /
- - Ted is at his station, finishing checking out a customer
Thank you, please come again, we have a lot more groceries
The customer exits
Ted sighs with boredom
He turns to , the large African-American woman at the next station
(') Hey Ellen
Yeah
Who's that over there
blonde girl bagging groceries a few aisles away (This is -)
That's the new bag girl
don't know her name, but she seems cute
Yeah
Very cute
You know what 'd like to do to her
Somethin'  call a Dirty Fozzie
Ted waves to the girl
She waves back
He makes a kissy face at her
She giggles and blows him a kiss back
He pantomimes hard, thrusting, standing-up sex
Her eyes widen for a beat, as she stares, then smiles
He grabs an Oh Henry bar, and pantomimes fellatio
The girl laughs hysterically
on Ted, as white liquid sprays all over his face from one side, then from the other
to reveal he's squirting two bottles of pump hand soap on either side of him
The girl laughs and shakes her head "no
" (') ( ) Okay, so that's where we'll draw the line
/  -- - 54 -- - John sits at his workstation, playing a  video game on his iPhone
Tanya approaches
Hey
How you holding up
Oh, 'm all right
Just
getting used to things, that's all
It's gonna be all right
'know,  went through something like this with my last boyfriend
Really
Yeah, we were dating for eight months, and  was really in love with him, and then he was deported back to Iran
So, get it
Oh
yeah
So
guess we both lost our furry little guy
Yeah
John's phone rings the theme from "Knight Rider
" He sees Ted's name pop up, with a photo of Ted smiling open- mouthed at the camera, with his arms outstretched and a bra on his head
John picks up
Hey, Ted
(
) Johnny
What are you doin'
You wanna come over and catch a buzz
could probably swing by after work
(
) Fuck that,  traded off yesterday, so got the night shift
'mon, 'm bored as crap over here, just swing by for a bit
() 55 : can't just ditch work, man
Look, 'm trying to get my shit together and be an adult here, y'know
For Lori's sake
'  - Ted sits in the tub, talking on the phone
He has suds in his hair, and there are a couple of little toy boats in the water
From here, we intercut back and forth from him and John
John
Five minutes
And then 'll kick you out,  promise
'mon,  picked up the "Cheers"  box set, and supposedly everybody talks shit about each other in the interviews
Really
Yeah, and apparently George Wendt confesses to a rape
() Sometimes adults get high
They do, John
Sometimes they do
You'll kick me out in five
(
) John,  have to kick you out
am extraordinarily busy today,  have so much teddy bear paperwork to get through, it is retarded
Five minutes and you're outta here
John turns and looks back at Thomas in his office
What do  tell Thomas
Just tell him you don't feel well
56 '  - John stands in front of Thomas, who sits at his desk
gotta duck out for a bit
Lori tried to break up a dog fight, and  guess she got hurt pretty bad
Oh my god
Yeah, she's-- that's the way she is, she sees trouble, she tries to help out, and guess one of these dogs clamped his jaws on her forearm, and he wouldn't let go until the fireman showed up and had to stick his finger in his ass
Jesus, John
Yeah, she's pretty shook up
Oh my god
() Up the dog's ass, right
Yeah, that's how they-- That's how they get `em to stop biting, sure
Yeah
Go go go, take care of it, let me know how she is
Oh gosh, thank you, sir
owe you one
You don't owe me anything, go
John smiles wanly, and exits
() 57 : (') (looking at his own finger) Jesus

'   - '   - - Ted Danson sits in a chair, being interviewed
Was there cocaine on the set of "Cheers"
Hm
Lemme figure out the best way to answer that
Um
are there naked dicks in gay porn
( ) Yes, there was quite a lot of cocaine mean, it was the eighties
And  was king
was king of the eighties
was Ted fucking Danson
And not only that, was Sam fucking Mayday Malone
Was popular
Gee, lemme think: are there naked dicks in gay porn
( ) Yes,  was quite beloved
Ted and John watching
They have a bong
You know, he's exactly who you want him to be
He is
He is
Someone the likes of which we should all aspire to become
- Woody Harrelson
Smallest dick 've ever seen on a man
John and Ted - (passing him bong) Here, try this stuff
told my guy to step it up, and he gave me this
What is it
() 58 : It's called Kennedy's Head
It's actually pretty mellow
That doesn't sound very mellow
No, it's-- it makes you cerebral
Like Kennedy
Kennedy was smart
That's what it refers to
Decisions under pressure
Cuban missile crisis
Go on, spark it up
John takes a hit off the bong, then glances around
'know, this place looks great
Yeah, it's all Ikea
Did the whole apartment for 47 dollars
How are the neighbors
There's an Asian family next door, but they don't have a gong or nothin', so it's fine
That's lucky
How's work
Sucks
Ah
You
It's actualy not bad

- - John, Ted, Lori and Ted's dolled-up and sort of trashy date Tami-Lynn (the bag girl from the grocery store) eat dinner
- See,  was all pissed off `cause me and my friend Danielle were supposed to go skydiving last year, but then she got pregnant from this asshole guy, and so we couldn't go and  was all upset, but then she had a miscarriage, and so we ended up getting to go skydiving, and it was so scary but it was so much fun
Hey, well
it sounds like everything worked out then
- guess god wanted me to go skydiving, y'know
Jesus
- Or Jesus, yeah, but whatever
Hey, isn't this great
The four of us here, having dinner together
Lori, how've you been
Haven't seen you in forever
Um, 've been good
Not much going on
My company's 20th anniversary is next week, that's something
(proud, to Tami-Lynn) Lori's a senior  at a big  firm
() 61 : It's not that big a deal
Company's turnin' 20, eh
So you can bang it but you can't get it drunk
Tami-Lynn laughs heartily at this, as does John
Lori isn't quite as delighted
( ) 'm surprised John didn't tell you already
Seems like you guys have seen each other every day since you moved out
Well, it's funny, usually the first item on our agenda is "what's goin' on with Lori
" So 'm surprised that one slipped through the cracks
We do, we talk about you all the time
Right
Oh my god, remember, Ted, last week we were talking about
how
neat all of Lori's shoes are
That was a lengthy conversation
And we were saying like, a lot of women look like unsteady horses when they wear high heels, but Lori has a sort of
regal
trot
canter
Oh my god yes
You canter
Lori stares at him for a beat, then: So, Tami, where are you from
Tell us about yourself
'm always
fascinated to meet Ted's girlfriends
() 62 : - What do you mean girlfriends
( ) Is there like a lot of `em or somethin'
No, no, that's not what she's sayin' at all, right Lori
No, right,  was-- all  was doing was asking
Ted's very
attractive, 'm just always interested in the
type of girl that can snatch him up
- Did you just call me a whore
What
No, -- - You just worry about your own snatch, how `bout that, honey
/ Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
/ What the hell happened
We're havin' a friendly meal here
- Don't talk shit to me
was just asking a question
- You're a friggin' snob
You think you're all cool cause you work at some fancy shit place
It's okay, Tami
( ) Nice, Lori
Real nice
What
It's not my fault she can't speak English
- Fuck you
Just `cause you're all in the business world and shit, you think everyone's supposed to like, suck your asshole
() 63 : Baby
Baby
Baby
Baby
Let's get outta here
We'll go back to my place for a couple vodka and strawberry Quiks
Okay
See ya, John
Ted and Tami Lynn exit leaving John and Lori at the table
What a cunt
(covering ears in pain) Ooh
hate that word
Huh
That word is so sharp
It's like an electric sword, slashing everything in its path
Well, you didn't exactly stick up for me
'm trying to walk a line here, want to be fair to you and to him, y'know
Yeah, well,  think you're being a little more fair to him
() Come on
'know, your boss called this morning and asked me how my arm was
() Oh
Yeah
Because of the dog fight  tried to break up
Ohh
() 64 : If  had to hazard a guess, 'd say that was some bullshit lie you made up so you could take off work and go to Ted's
Am right
() made you out to be a hero
John, Ted moved out so we could give ourselves a chance without him
You're not really giving anything a chance if you're blowing off work to get high with your teddy bear
It won't happen again,  promise
(with a bit of anger) Yes
It will
beat
She sighs
(') wanna break up
() What
'm just
'm done
This isn't gonna work
We're in two different places
Lori, look,  know-- You promised me you were gonna grow up and take our life together seriously
Hey, Ted moved out, didn't he
did that for you-- for us
And it wasn't easy
Jesus, he might as well still be living with us, John
You spend more time with him than you do with me
() 65 : Okay, look
've been getting stoned too much
know that
've been bumming around with Ted too much,  know that, too
Give me one more chance,  promise can fix it
Lori,  love you too much, please give me one more chance
() need a man, John
Not a boy with a teddy bear
know
Done
Man, right here in front of you
Look at these pecs
Man pecs
Look at the hair on my upper lip
Man hair
just farted
Man fart
Lori can't help but let a small laugh escape
She softens a bit
John
this really is your last chance
can't do this anymore
You won't have to
Trust me
love you
He kisses her
() Okay
Aw, sweetie,  love you so much
You won't be sorry,  swear
She smiles at him, then: Did you really just fart
Yeah, but  pushed it that way with my hand
Oh
Wonder where it'll hit first
on the restaurant
For a moment, nothing happens
() 66 : Then, a guy at a table on the right (sitting with a couple other men and women) screams into his napkin, followed by his dining companions
() Who did this to us
#2 () God dammit
'm here on business
/
- - Ted's boss, Frank, emerges from the back, writing on a clipboard
He looks up, and his expression turns to confused anger as he sees an unusually long line at Ellen's register
What the hell
He walks over to the line
turns and notices him
Hey, dude, you think you could open more than one register
There's like a thousand people here
There's supposed to be three registers open, for god's sake
He looks around, aggravated, for a moment, then storms off toward the back
He looks around the butcher's counter and produce area, then walk into the back storeroom
- Frank opens the door, and reacts with shock where we see Ted on top of Tami Lynn, who is almost naked
He is doing a very close approximation of banging her wildly
We see his furry bear butt pumping away, with its little tail on the end
Frank screams in shock and horror
67 '  - Frank sits at his desk, addressing Ted
You had sexual intercourse with a coworker in a storeroom filled with produce that we sell to the public
Yes
() That took guts
We need guts
'm promoting you
Oh
- We see the "" sign on the door
Ted exits, finishing off a bottle of beer
He walks around to the dumpster alley, and lines up for a Kareem-style sky hook shot into a trash can
He takes the shot: Kareem
The bottle smashes off the side of the can, and shatters
(') You suck, Kareem
We hear a soft footstep somewhere
Ted turns and looks around
There appears to be no one in the darkness
(') Hello
No answer
He looks around for a beat, and finds nothing
He turns
and finds himself facing Donny, who stands eerily lit by a single outdoor wall bulb
Hello, Ted
Gah
Uh
hi there
Are you all alone out here
() 68 : Uh
no
No 'm not
'm
you know, you're never alone when you're with Christ
You know, Robert and  could give you a very, very good home
'm
'm pretty happy where  am just got a shitty new apartment-- can offer you six thousand dollars in railroad bonds
They were left to me by my father
Well, gosh, you know, since  just returned from active duty in the Civil War, that sounds really appealing
Oh wait, no, that was a hundred and fifty years ago, and  don't give a shit
Tami-Lynn approaches
- Teddy, come on-- we're gonna have pop tarts and cigarettes with my mom before she goes to work
Yeah, 'm comin', sweetheart
( ) Yeah, my dance card is quite full, so 'm gonna have to decline
really wish you wouldn't
Yeah, sorry
But, ah
you know, 'd like to thank you for creepin' up my night, and
Jesus be with you
In Christ
Ted hurries off
, who looks eerily determined

'  - John and Lori walk up to the fabulously expansive house in Cambridge
It's a very impressive estate with no expense spared
(smiling at him warmly) 'm glad you're here
Yeah, me too
Is it cool if  kick your boss' ass
That won't affect your workplace chemistry, will it
Play nice
Please
Rex throws open the door
There she is
was worried you weren't coming
( ) Hi kiddo, how ya doin'
Where's your bunny rabbit
He's a bear
(ushering them in) Got it
"Hey, this house is fucking huge
"  know guys, try not to get lost
'  - The party is a very costly-looking event: uniformed servers walking around with trays of cocktails and hors d'ouvres, tables laden with lavish-looking food displays and floral arrangements, a 20-piece big band, and hundreds of guests
large banner reads "Happy 20th Anniversary, Plymouth Public Relations
" Oh, here come the ladies
Gina, Michelle, and Tracy approach
Everyone adlibs their hellos to John and Lori
waiter walks by with a tray of champagne
Lori and the girls each take a glass
() 70 : (') Say listen, why don't John and  give you gals a chance to talk tampax while we go grab a drink at the bar, huh
Sure
'  -  - Rex and John are walking up the stairs to the second floor of his house
Rex points out various items bought at auction
John is visibly unenthused
He does not like this guy, and definitely does not trust him
and that's a Wade Boggs autographed bat
Just barely outbid Phil Donahue for that at auction
Wow, cool
Yeah, cool
And those boxing gloves were worn by Joe Louis in his first fight
(passing an abstract ) This is art
Do you get it
(passing wall mounted pair of ) ) These were John Lennon's glasses
Worth about two million dollars
(passing photo on wall) ) That's me and Tom Skerritt
Oh, and check this out
Rex indicates a small, bronze-colored item on a stand
(') See that
Know what that is
( ) No
That's Lance Armstrong's nut
John quickly pulls his hand away
(') Something, isn't it
Had it freeze-dried and bronzed
() () 71 : (') Every now and then, when  feel like my life's gettin' me down and things are tough,  just come in here and look at it, and it reminds me that things aren't so bad
That some people have it worse than me
mean, he's only got one ball, and  have three
One of them, of course, being his
That's inspiring
You've led a rich life
've fucked the shit outta life
() So talk to me, Goose
How are things with you and Lori
Things are great, actually
That's good, that's good
You know
Lori would hate me for saying this, but
she's told me how you are at the office, and
as one gentleman to another,  just wanna say  really hope you fucking get Lou Gehrig's disease
Whoa, whoa, okay, look,  think  oughtta just clear the air here a little
just want you to know that
mean, yeah, 'm kind of a "fun-time boss" and whatnot, but
look man,  do that with everybody at the office
'm just a kook
have no designs on your girlfriend
We work together, and that's it
think you're a great guy and she's very lucky
John is a bit surprised, not unpleasantly so, to hear this
Well
that's good to hear
Well, that's how it is, so
there we go
Okay
() 72 : Yeah
They stand there for a beat, looking at Lance Armstrong's nut
John's phone rings the "Knight Rider" theme
John answers it
Hey, Ted
, who stands in the foreground with one finger in his ear
In the background, we see a party in full swing
(
) Johnny
You gotta get over here, man
Why
What's going on
(
) 'm havin' a little impromptu thing with some people, and John
Sam Jones is here
What
(
) Sam Jones
Flash fucking Gordon
Is here
Holy shit
How
'  - Remember  said, my buddy's cousin is friends with Sam Jones
My buddy's in town with his cousin and who's with `em
Sam Jones
'  - (
) Sam Jones is here, and John
(softly, into phone) his hair is parted down the middle
( ) Just like in the movie
() 73 : Get over here
Fuck
can't
'm with Lori
'm already on probation here
John looks down at the main area of the party, and sees Lori happily chatting with her co-workers
(') () just
can't
'  - John
There are moments in a man's life: Nathan Hale, " regret that  have but one life to give for my country
" Alan Hale, "Yes,  accept the role of the Skipper on `Gilligan's Island
'" '  - (
) John, this is your Alan Hale moment
For god's sake, come share this with me
(beat, then:) 'm coming
John hangs up
(') Rex
gotta go
'll be back in thirty minutes tops, but Lori cannot find out
She absolutely cannot know  was gone
If you can cover for me
we're cool on all that other stuff
got your back, my friend
Been there
She'll never know
This is one man to another
don't really know you, but 'm trusting you
As a man
This is serious
Can  trust you
() 74 : Dude
One man to another
got you on this
( ) Okay
Thank you
John races
and Rex raises his scotch glass to his mouth
() 'm gonna make traditional to your girlfriend
And then fuck her in the ass
All right
We have a game plan
'  - The "Football Fight" music from "Flash Gordon" starts playing, as John bolts
'  - John sprints out of the house and runs down the walkway
He leaps over a hedge toward the parking area
He slides across the hood of Lori's car, gets in, quickly starts the car, and backs out
() - various shots of John racing through the city on his way to Ted's
Finally, he pulls up to Ted's apartment
'  - John throws open the door
The place is as lively as it can be
The party is packed with people, including Alix and Tanya, John's co-workers from Liberty
There are also a large number of booze-swilling guys and hot chicks
Ted runs up, wearing a blazer
Johnny
Thank Christ you made it
() got ten minutes, where's Flash Gordon
() 75 : Okay, get ready, man
(to someone
) Hey, Sam
This is the guy  was tellin' you about
John turns to look in the direction Ted is indicating
The shot slows down into slo-mo as John's eyes widen, and he sees
- Across the room,
turns in slo-mo to face John
He is inexplicably still sporting the same hairstyle he had in the "Flash Gordon" movie
We hear the theme from "Flash Gordon
" We  back and forth from him to John: - He stands frozen in awe
- He smiles as he begins to walk toward the camera, in John's
- He continues to stare in frozen awe
- Still slowly walking toward camera in John's , but he is now dressed in the Flash Gordon costume
- He continues to stare in frozen awe
-  - Sam
Jones flies on the flying Jetski from the movie
John stands behind him on the back, with his arms around Sam's chest, as if on the back seat of a motorcycle
John has a huge, elated smile on his face
'  - John - He still stares in awe
- He smiles and offers an outstretched hand for a handshake
- Sam walks up to John with Ted by his side
John, this is Sam Jones
Sam, this is my best friend in the whole world, John
Hi there
Good to meet you
() 76 : (in absolute fucking awe) thank you for saving every one of us
You're welcome
Hey, let's do some shots, huh
With you
Yes
Oh my god, yes
Sam passes out shots of Southern Comfort
(raising his glass) Death to Ming
John and Ted look at each other, squealing with delight
Everyone then does their shots
(') Hey, you guys seem pretty cool
() You like to party
John and Ted don't answer for a beat
They look at each other nervously
It's clear neither one has any experience with this sort of thing
(') Aw, come on dudes
Don't tell me you've never done it before
(a little scared) Not
recently, no
You fellas better come with me
'  - John, Ted, and Sam emerge from the bathroom
John's eyes are wide and enthusiastic
Ted has a little bit of powder on his nose, and his ears are flattened back
And Sam is just playing it cool
Wow
Let's party like the `80's huh
() 77 : () Show us how, Flash
It's easy
We just gotta bang a lotta girls named Stephanie
Holy shit
(looking around intensely) All these people need to be talked to
'  - John and Ted sit staring at each other intensely across the table
Look Johnny, if we're ever gonna get serious about openin' a restaurant we gotta start plannin' it now
Italian
Italian, yes
What's the special on Tuesdays
Eggplant parm
Chopped salad half price
And it's a non-restricted place
Yeah--wait, whaddaya mean
Anybody can come
Of course
Mormons are welcome
() 78 : Well yeah--why wouldn't they be
Exactly, that's what 'm saying
But why even bring that up-- You don't bring it up
You just let `em in
Yeah, but why mention it
No one will
So why are we talking about it
You're talkin' about it, 'm just sayin' let `em in
Yes, let `em in
Exactly
Right
Good
Okay
No Catholics, though
'  - Ted stands opposite a group of party guests who sit on the couch
He holds a knife
No see,  can do this
#1 Shut up
() 79 : My teddy bear biology gives me superhuman reflexes
#2 Let him try it, man
#1 Fuck it, all right
Guy #1 puts his hand down on the coffee table and Ted starts doing the knife trick from "Aliens"
He gets it right for a few seconds, then stabs the guy right through the hand
The guy screams in pain
Well, you never shoulda trusted me, 'm on drugs
'  - John stands with a pair of fake bear ears on his head, doing an impression of Ted as a small group of partygoers (Ted included) watches, laughing hysterically
( ) Hey Johnny,  just had a great idea-- let's go get drunk and puke on cars from the overpass
Oh god, that was a fun day
( ) Johnny, you gotta get over here man, just tried this  all the kids are talkin' about, and 'm in trouble think  got sucked inside my chair
do not sound that much like Peter Griffin
'  - Ted sits on the couch drawing a pair of Garfield eyes on a topless girl
Below the eyes he has drawn the muzzle and the mouth, and above them the ears
() 80 : See
There
Proof
Garfield's eyes look like a pair of tits
- Okay, you were right
'  - Ted stands by the , singing a karaoke version of " Only Want to be with You" by Hootie and the Blowfish
Okay, Johnny, c'mon up here and do this with me
No no
Come on
No,  don't sing in front of people
, ' ' `
' ' ' ' '
' ' , '  - Sam, John and Ted stand by the wall
See there's this one part of the wall that's really soft, you could punch through it wicked easy
Sam punches the wall a couple times, and his fist goes right through
() 81 : // Holy shit
/ Ha
/ Wow
/ Etc
Immediately we see half an Asian face dart into frame through the hole
He screams in Cantonese, then, What the hell you problem
You break my wall
You break my wall  break you wall
The neighbor sticks a knife through the hole
John, Ted, and Sam scream
Sam and John jump around and scream as they frantically try to get the knife
Break his arm, Flash
Cut his arm off
Sam grabs the arm, and it darts back inside
'  - There's an angry pounding on the door
One of the party guests opens it, and the Asian guy runs in, screaming in Cantonese
He holds a wooden spoon in one hand, and a live duck in the other
John, Sam, and Ted run back out into the living room
The Asian guy runs toward them, screaming first in Cantonese, then: You break my wall
This my home long time
You break my wall
You bastard men
/ Dude, we're sorry
We're sorry
You bastard men
try to make duck dinner, now plaster everywhere
Chill out okay
We'll pay for it
Let's talk this out okay
What's your name
'm John
() My name Wan Ming
( ) Ming
() 82 : '  - We see the Asian man dressed as Ming the Merciless
You pay many dollar for wall
This bullshit
This all bullshit
Sam charges the Asian man, tackling him
They both tumble over the back of the couch, nearly knocking it over
The duck flies out of his arms, landing on the floor
It immediately goes after Ted, who screams
, who chokes the Asian man on the floor
John struggles to pull him off
Sam, no
Get off him
- who circles confrontationally with the duck, as in an Irish bar fight - The Asian man jabs Sam in the eye with the other end of the spoon, and Sam goes staggering backward, falling into John
They land on the table, smashing it in half
They fall to the floor on top of each other
You crazy
You crazy man
The duck charges at Ted and slaps him across the face a few times with its wings
The Asian man calls to the duck from the door
Come on, James Franco
The duck takes one last whack at Ted and waddles over to the Asian man, fluttering up into his arms
(') (to John and Sam) You pay for wall
He exits, slamming the door
'  - John sits on the couch as Guy enters, holding hands with another man
() 83 : Guy
Hey
What's goin' on
This is Jared
He's the guy who beat me up
We're in love
What
Yeah
Turns out 'm gay or whatever
Had no idea
'mon Jared, let's get a drink
He and Jared walk off
, who sits on the couch, looking zoned out and drained
Sam Jones approaches
How you doin' there, ace
You comin' down
Yeah
Yeah,  don't feel good
Give it a couple hours, you'll be golden, Pony Boy
Want a Xanax
John looks at the clock
His eyes widen in panicked realization
Holy shit
Holy shit, oh my god
What
gotta--  gotta go
Shit
John scrambles to his feet, and runs for the front door
- John opens the door and runs down the hall
He runs partway down the stairwell, and stops short as he sees Lori at the bottom, coming partway up the stairs
They stare at each other for a beat
She looks as hurt, angry, and betrayed as a woman can be
() 84 : Lori
He throws up all over the floor
'  - Lori storms out into the street
After a beat, John runs out after her
Lori
Lori wait
She hastily pays the cabbie who waits outside
John catches up to her and grabs her arm, but she shakes him off
She is clearly hurt, and on the verge of tears
(') 'm sorry
messed up
-- want you out of the apartment
tonight
Gimme my car keys
Can  please just explain-- No
was gonna-- have given up a big chunk of my life for you
was gonna stop in for like five minutes, and then Flash Gordon-- Just give me my keys, John
He reluctantly hands her her keys
She turns and walks toward her car
Lori
please
love you
She gets in the car and drives away with a screech
Angle on Ted, who is walking out the door
() 85 : Johnny, come on upstairs
Tami-Lynn's gonna make some  Cola from scratch
Fuck you
don't want to talk to you
What
Do you know what just happened
Do you have any clue
My life just ended
Oh come on, she'll go home, watch Bridget Jones' Somethin' Asshole, cry a little bit, she'll be fine, you'll talk to her tomorrow
() Are you even listening to me
Do you give any shred of a shit
Ted pauses, realizing John is serious
Well
`course  do, Johnny
Thunder buddies for life
Jesus, Lori was right
should have stopped hanging out with you a long time ago
'm never gonna have a life with you around
'm 35 years old and 'm going nowhere
All  do is smoke pot and watch movies with a teddy fucking bear
And because of that,  just lost the love of my life
Johnny, 'm
'm sorry
just
gotta be on my own, Ted can't see you anymore
John turns and walks away
Johnny, wait
Hey, listen
() 86 : Ted pushes his own stomach in
We hear his soundbox squeak out the words " wuv you
" John does not turn around
Ted looks after him, then slowly lowers his head sadly
He sits down on the sidewalk, dazed and defeated

- John sits on the bed and turns on the
He flips through the channels, seeing various clips of shows
Eventually, he shuts off the
He opens his wallet, and takes out a picture of Lori
He looks at it sadly
: - John and Lori play mini-golf
She putts, and the ball stops just short of the hole
John walks up to it, and "looks the other way" as he taps it in with his foot
She smiles warmly at him
: - John and Lori are on a swan boat ride, throwing bread to the ducks
They're both leaning over the side with their hands on the rail
His hand moves partway on top of hers
They look at each other, and share a slow, romantic kiss
: '  - Lori sits on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, her face wet with tears
the  screen, where a Bridget Jones film is playing
Lori, who is looking at the screen, but is really looking inward
: 87 - a partially full moon
to John and Lori, walking along the beach, holding hands
He kisses her on the cheek, then looks down, noticing something He leans down and picks up a dead horseshoe crab
He dangles it in Lori's face
She freaks out, and runs into the water
They both laugh
: '  - - We pull out to reveal Lori sitting at the table, with a couple of candles in front of her
John comes out of the kitchen wearing an apron, and holding an entire turkey with a candle in it
She smiles and puts her hands over her mouth with delighted hilarity
He sets the turkey down, and she gives him a big, laughing smile as she shakes her head
: '  - '  - The party is now over
Everyone has gone, and the place is a mess '  - He lies alone in his bed, flipping through channels with his remote
He turns and stares at a picture in a frame next to his bed It shows John and Ted as kids, standing in the snow, smiling at the camera
They stand next to a soapbox car that they have built and painted
: - 8-year-old John and Ted are at the top of a hill with the soapbox racer
Ted is in the racer, wearing a helmet
John gives the racer a push, and Ted speeds off down the hill
At the bottom, he smashes into a tree, shattering the racer, and sending him flying out of it onto the ground

John sprints after the dog

Ted has sauce all over his mouth and fur
John hands him a napkin and he wipes it off

Ted is there among them, stiffly playing the banjo and looking very animatronic
couple little kids walk up to watch
After a beat, Ted gets in their faces, scaring the shit out of them
They run away, crying and traumatized
John, who laughs hysterically
: '  - John and Lori paint the walls of their then new apartment
They start to playfully splatter paint on each other
Ted, who watches from the other side of the room, where he leans against the wall
He shakes his head in a "whatever" fashion, and walks toward the door
When he turns, we see there is a white stripe of paint going down his back
'  - Ted exits the apartment, holding a pack of cigarettes and a lighter
He pulls one cigarette out with his mouth and goes to light it

He reacts with a take, and sprints

You're asking me out the day after broke up with someone
Look, 'm gonna cut the shit here
Okay
This is the first time you've been single in all the years you've worked here
Just go out with me one time
And if you're miserable and you hate it, promise  will never even hint at the subject again
Please
Rex,  don't think it's smart
Look, 'm an asshole
know that
It worked for me in high school, and it's been like a reflex ever since
() () 90 : (') (sigh) Lori, the worst that can happen is you have a fun, casual date with a guy who only wants a chance to prove to you that he can be something more than a jerk
Besides, you're a huge catch and it's about time somebody treated you that way
Fine
guess it beats crying myself to sleep every night
Great
Pick you up at seven

- It's raining outside
- John sulks on the bed, leafing through a Tintin comic book
There's a knock at the door
Who is it
Johnny, it's me
Go away
Johnny, open the door, please
wanna talk
John ignores him
few beats go by, then the window slides open from the outside, and Ted tumbles in, landing on the floor, soaked
-- Ted shakes the water off himself like a dog
John flinches back, trying not to get wet
(') Jesus Christ
() 91 : Sorry
Look, Johnny,  know you're pissed, but just listen to me for five seconds
saw Lori out on a date with Rex
What
'm serious, John,  went over to your house to talk to Lori to try and take some of the heat off you, and  saw Rex picking her up
They were going to the Hatch Shell
You're un-fucking-believable, you know that
How stupid do you think  am
First of all, Lori would never go out with Rex, and second of all, if you think that by making shit like that up you're gonna make me choose some kind of loyalty to you over her-- Johnny, it's the truth
'm tellin' ya-- Get outta here
() You know, you're actin' like a cock, you know that
What
'm acting like a cock
Yes
You are actin' like a giant, - shaped-funny-lookin'-guy-in-a-porno cock
Huh
`Member that porno we saw with the guy with the -shaped cock--forget it
What 'm sayin' is that you're blamin' me for somethin' you did to yourself
John glares at him
() 92 : (') Lori was right about you
You can't take responsibility for anything that goes on in your life
Oh, and you can
don't have to, 'm a fuckin' teddy bear
'know somethin',  didn't tie you up and drag you to that party
wanted you to come because you're supposedly my best friend
Oh, yeah
Is that why you've manipulated me for years to stay eternally eight years old at the expense of the rest of my life
Whoa whoa, it's not my fault you didn't care enough about your relationship
You can't stand there and tell me you haven't always seen Lori as a threat to our friendship
It works out so much better for you when you and  are getting fucked up on the couch at 9 am, doesn't it
Wow
Listen to yourself
What am , Emperor Ming here, controllin' your mind
That's your choice, John
And you know, by blamin' me, you just make yourself look like a pussy
() You know
sometimes  think back to that Christmas morning when  was eight years old
and  wish 'd just gotten a Teddy Ruxpin

Teddy
Rux-fucking-pin

" John stumbles around the room, trying to pry Ted off
Eventually, he stumbles into the bathroom, and crashes through the shower door, shattering it
He and Ted exchange punches to the face
John lands a particularly hard one, which sends Ted flying across the room, and slamming into the wall
Ted hits the floor, and runs out of the bathroom
John stumbles to his feet
Ted scrambles across the bed, reaches into the bedside drawer, and pulls out a Bible
John staggers out of the bathroom, just in time to be pelted in the head as Ted throws the Bible at him
(') Fucking Jesus fucking Christ
god fucking dammit
Ted throws other objects at him, including beer cans and the phone
John and Ted stare at each other for a beat, each one breathing heavily (Ted is now on the floor)
John charges at Ted, sailing across the bed, and tackling him, knocking over the side table and lamp in the process
John and Ted scuffle on the floor, engaging in a realistic-as-possible fistfight
Each one gets a number of blows in
John throws Ted off him, and back onto the bed
Ted taunts him
'mon, motherfucker
John jumps at Ted, throwing a jab at him
But Ted dodges, and John's fist goes into the wall above the headboard
He struggles to pull free as he flails about with his other hand, grabbing at Ted
Ted dodges again, and scrambles up John's head, jumping up and grabbing the chain on the ceiling fan, turning it on, and causing Ted to swing back and forth
John pulls free, and stumbles backward off the bed
He notices a tall, free-standing lamp in the corner
He pulls the plug out of the wall, and uses the lamp to take a swing at Ted
Ted swings out of the way
John takes a second swing, but the lamp cord catches on the fan's motor
The lamp is ripped from John's grasp, it swings around through the air, and cracks him in the side of the head
John goes down, whacking his head a second time on the baseboard of the bed
He howls in pain as he lies on his stomach, clutching his head
Ted takes advantage of this
He jumps down from the cord, and pulls the antenna off the clock radio next to the bed
He jumps down to the floor, yanks John's pants partway down, and starts whipping his bare ass with the antenna
John yells in fury, and kicks blindly at Ted
He turns over, kicking ted in the face, and kicking the cabinet that the  is on
() 94 : The  wobbles, and falls off the cabinet, landing with a crash, right on his groin
John lies there, with the on his crotch and his pants down, and breathes heavily
Ted, still dazed from the kick to the face, crawls over to him
Both breathe heavily
John's breathing deteriorates into sobs
(') ( ) Why
why are you crying
My dick is in the
John continues to sob
Ted climbs down off the table and up onto the bed
He pushes the  off John, then lies down next to him
Ted starts to sob himself
'm so sorry, Johnny
'm so sorry
So am , man
love you
love you, too
John hugs Ted, who hugs him back
Listen
you gotta let me help you make things right with you and Lori
There is no putting things right
She hates me
No, John, we can get her back
Look, remember when you were ten, and you hit that squirrel with your  gun, and then when we saw it fall from the tree we both starting crying
Remember
And then we ran up to it and tried to give it
And it came back to life
John, we could do that again
Ted, we crushed its rib cage and blew out its lungs trying to give it
It died
() 95 : ( ) We can get Lori back
- huge crowd has gathered for the Norah Jones concert
They cheer as she sings "Come Away With Me," backed by a large string section
Rex and Lori, who cheer in the audience along with everyone else
They seem to be having a fantastic time
God, she's so brave Norah finishes the song
Thanks so much
We're gonna take a short break, but we'll be back in a few
The crowd cheers
- a dressing room sign which reads
We move inside the dressing room as Norah enters and pours a drink
(
) Hey, play chopsticks, you jazzy slut
(turning, recognizing) Teddy
How you doin', you fuzzy little asshole
She hugs him
Well, 'm not a hot half-Muslim chick who sold 37 million records, but 'm hangin' in there
Well, half-Indian, but thanks
Eh, ooga booga, whatever
Hey,  want you to meet a good pal of mine
Hey Johnny, come on in
() 96 : the doorway, where John enters, a little nervous
(') Norah, this is my friend John
(- ) Hi
Hi, Norah Jones
(shaking his hand) Ha
Whoa, relax there, sweaty
You ready to bring down the house
Yes ma'am
Thank you for the opportunity, Ms
-- Ma'am Jones
Jesus, you look fantastic
Well, you're probably not used to seeing me fully clothed
Me and Norah met in 2002 at a party at Belinda Carlisle's house and we had awkward, fuzzy sex in the coatroom
Actually, you weren't so bad for a guy with no penis
have written so many letters to Hasbro about that
- The crowd is cheering
Norah is back out on stage at the piano
Okay, 'm gonna give my chops a rest here and invite a friend of mine up to the stage
He's gonna sing a song to a very special lady in the audience who he loves very much
Let's give a big hand to John Bennett
() 97 : The crowd applauds dutifully as John walks out onstage
Lori and Rex
Lori reacts, shocked
Oh my god
John takes center stage, and looks down at Lori
Uh, hi
Um
This is for Lori Collins
Because  love her
This song always reminds me of the most important night of my life
The night we met
It's the theme song from the movie "Octopussy
" The band begins playing
"All Time High"
Inexplicably, Norah is playing the saxophone with a pair of shades on
(') / '  / ,   ' ,   /   ' / Lori and Rex
Rex is visibly derisive, but we see that Lori is softening
It's working
(') '  -  / ' '   /     / (fake voice, covering his mouth and looking away) You suck, get off the stage
(then, for Lori's benefit) Hey, come on guys
The crowd starts to take the cue
Get off the stage
/ Boooo
/ You suck
/ We wanna hear Norah
/ Come on
Ted in the wings
Ah, god
/ () 98 : a crazed audience member, who rushes the stage, racing toward John
You're an asshole
John flinches as he raises the mic stand off the floor at the last second, so the base is sticking out horizontally
The crazy guy runs right into it, bashing himself in the face
He goes down, unconscious and bleeding
Everyone gasps as the music stops
Jesus
few concert personnel rush out to check the guy
Someone call an ambulance
The crowd is now shouting angrily at John
But he is only focused n one spot in the crowd
He sees that Lori and Rex are gone
Almost oblivious to the rest of the frenzy, he sighs, heartbroken
couple of concert security personnel haul him offstage
- Rex escorts Lori to his car
That was insane
Did you see the way that guy's body hit the ground
It was like a rag doll
Yeah, 'd rather just not talk about it
You want to go get a drink after this feel like  could use one after seeing a guy almost die
Nope,  think 'd rather you just take me home
One drink, come on
Nope, not really feeling up to it
() 99 : Alright, alright,  get it
don't blame you
When you think about it, it was actually really unfair of him to embarrass you like that
Just to be clear,  am not embarrassed
Listen, John and  may have our problems but at least he tried
You know what don't feel like talking to you about this
She walks away
Where you going
Taking a cab
'm going home
As she disappears out of earshot, Rex closes his eyes and releases a fart
Finally
/
& '   - '  -  - Lori gets out of the shower, and begins towelling off, still reeling with disgust from her encounter with Rex
After a few moments, there's a knock at the door
Lori sighs with annoyance, and walks to the door, still in her towel
She looks through the peephole, but there's no one there
She opens the door cautiously, and looks out into the hall
There's no one there
(
) Down here,  swear to god 'm not lookin' up your towel
She looks down with a start, and sees Ted standing there
He's blocking his view with one hand
(') Not lookin' up your towel
Not lookin' at your funny business
() 100 : (pulling towel closer to her) Ted
What're you doing here
What do you want
need to talk to you
Look, if you're here to fight John's battle for hi-- Lori, do me a favor and let me talk first, and then you can say whatever you want
There's a beat
She reluctantly considers
'   -   - Lori, now in a robe, sits down on the couch, facing Ted
Look, John loves you very much
More than anything in the world
And he's fallin' to fuckin' pieces without you
He knows he screwed up big time, but you gotta believe me that is wasn't all his fault
If you'll just give him one more chance to be with you-- She rolls her eyes
(') Listen to me
If you'll just give him one more chance
promise  will leave and never come back
He'll be all yours
Just give him one more chance
Ted
that's a very nice offer, but don't want you to do that
This is about John and me and our problems
And don't think it can be fixed
Because of me
Look, you want him to be a man
And 'm the one who's keepin' that from happening
As long as he's got his teddy bear, he's still a boy
And care about him as much as you do
But 'm willing to give up the boy so you can have the man
() 101 : We can see Lori starting to soften a bit
(') Look, 'm givin' this the best shot  got here, Lori
'm beggin' you
'm no good at this emotional crap, but  gotta help my best friend
Please
Just talk to him
() 'll talk to him
Thank you
He's waitin' for me down at Charley's
So
maybe you could, y'know
go down instead of me
What
now
Please
You'll regret it for the rest of your life if you don't
Alright, alright, 'll go
'  - Lori emerges from the bedroom, dressed, and heads for the door
Ted is on the couch watching
(flipping on ) Hey, you mind if  stay and watch the Sox
The door shuts and she's gone
Ted gets up and walks into the kitchen
He opens the fridge
(') Jesus Christ, what a chick fridge
Yoplait, a cantaloupe, and a Brita water filter
He opens up a crisper drawer, and looks at a six-pack of beer bottles
(') Michelob Ultra Tuscan Orange Grapefruit
My god, America is imploding
() 102 : He shakes his head as he opens the beer, and walks into the other room
He settles down in a recliner, and watches the game
After a moment, there's a knock at the door
Ted sighs with annoyance, and gets up
(') Forget your keys
He walks to the door, and opens it up
(') You know, your beer suck-- He freezes, and looks up
We reveal Donny, the creepy man from earlier, with his son Robert
Hi, Ted
Fuck
Donny throws a sack over Ted, trapping him
/
' - Lori's car pulls up, and she gets out
' - Lori enters, and looks around
She spots John, who looks up from a menu
He is surprised to see her
She sighs and walks over to him
Lori
What-- what are you doing here
You can thank Ted
beat
John smiles slightly
(') How are you
Good, good
've, uh
made myself a nice little home at the Midtown Hotel up the street
'd show you around, but it's kinda classy
They require an undershirt and at least one visible cold sore for all customers
() 103 : ( ) Well
Shall  sit
Uh, yeah
She does
There's a beat
busboy brings them each a water
(') So, work's good
Everything good there
Yeah
Work's fine
How's Rex
There is no Rex
Oh
Good
() Well
guess we can't make small talk all day, so 'll say what  wanna say could sit here and tell you 'm sorry, it was a huge misunderstanding, and 'm ready to change
But  don't think you wanna hear any of that crap
'm not gonna try and get you to take me back
Why would you
've been a really shitty boyfriend for the last four years don't deserve you
didn't take our relationship seriously, even though love you more than life itself
All want is
just to end on good terms
Because  owe that to you
want you to be happy
and for us to be friends
(a little taken aback) Wow
Thank you
appreciate that
Well
That's pretty much it
He takes out some money, and puts it on the table, paying the check
He smiles at her and walks out
She sits there for a beat
104 '  - Donny's car pulls up
The house is a low-class, creepily shabby-looking Boston home (think Buffalo Bill in "Silence of the Lambs")
It's close to one end of the base of a bridge
'  - Donny carries the sack inside, and unceremoniously dumps Ted onto the floor
Ted looks around
It's just as shitty on the inside as on the outside
On the walls, there are a disturbing number of newspaper clippings, photo spreads, etc
Most are from press from Ted's media heyday, but some are photographs of Ted and John out in public that Donny clearly took himself
Whoa
Yes, as you can see, you've been part of our family for quite some time
Welcome home
Heh, you know what's hilarious,  got tons of pictures of you guys at my house
Daddy, is he all mine
He's all yours, my little winner
You've arrived at a lucky time, Ted
It's almost Robert's play hour
'm guessin' you guys don't have a PS3
'm guessin' you're more of a wooden horse with a wig kinda family
'  - Ted is led into Robert's room
It's a fairly sparse room with some toys strewn about
wooden rocking horse with a wig stands in the corner
Huh
Wig horse
Robert sits down on the floor, smiling at him
Donny stands in the doorway
() 105 : Now, remember, Ted, you belong to Robert now
So you will do as he says
'know, you think you're just gonna get away with a kidnapping
Nice fuckin' example you're settin' for your kid
(leaning in to Ted with ) Ted flinches nervously
Donny moves back
(') When  was a little boy,  saw you on television
And  thought you were the most amazing, most wonderful thing 'd ever seen
Ever
And  asked my father if  could have a magical teddy bear, too
And he said no
And  was heartbroken
decided that if  ever had a son,  would never say no to him
Maybe "no" to a Snickers bar every once in awhile wouldn't hurt
Me and Ted are gonna be best friends, daddy
Yes
You are
Happy play time
Donny shuts the door
Robert stares at Ted
Jesus fucking Christ
No
Daddy said no bad words
Yeah well, fuck your dad
Ted scrambles for the window and tries to open it
It doesn't budge
He takes a running leap at it, but just bounces off like a plush toy, and lands on the floor
(') Shit
() 106 : Robert stands over him
said a bad word one time, and daddy punished me for it
That's a great story,  felt like  was there
Daddy gave me an ouch
Now  have to give you an ouch
Robert grabs Ted with one hand, and gets a grip on one of Ted's ears with the other hand
Robert pulls on the ear as hard as he can, and rips the ear off
Ted screams as loud as he can
Robert looks at him, holding the ear
Okay
okay, kid
You win
We'll do it your way
You wanna play a game or somethin'
It's play time, let's play a game
Yeah,  wanna play a game
Good, good, hey, how `bout we play a little game of hide and seek
love hide and seek
'll hide
Well, now, Robert, your dad likes you to show good manners, right
Yes
Well, a well-mannered kid lets his guest hide first, don't ya think
There's a beat
Robert stares blankly at him, then: Okay, you hide first
Great
Fantastic
Okay, now you count to a hundred and then try to find me, okay
() 107 : Do  need to wash my hands before this game
You
well-- no, you-- god, that's a weird fuckin' question, no, just start countin'
Robert sits down, covers his eyes and starts counting
One
two
three
Ted grabs a chair and starts sliding it over toward the door
Okay, no peekin', now, or you'll get kid cancer
Ted reaches the door, climbs up onto the chair, and turns the doorknob
He opens the door, and exits out into the hallway
After a beat, he re-enters, grabs his severed ear, and exits again
- Ted nervously moves down the hallway toward the front door
He has it in sight on the far end of the living room, but when he gets closer to the living room doorway, he sees that Donny is sitting in an armchair, watching The Incredible Hulk (the old  show)
Ted darts back into the hallway before he's seen, but in the process, bumps into a small table with a lamp and a couple knick knacks on it
One of them, a small ceramic penguin, falls over, making a sound
Donny turns and looks in the direction of the hallway
() Robert
How's play time
'  - Robert's hands still cover his eyes
Good, daddy
108 - Ted, are you making friends with Robert
Ted looks panicky, not knowing what to do
After a beat, Donny leans forward as if he's about to get up
(') Ted
(
) Daddy, you're gonna ruin the game
() Okay
Ted breathes a sigh of relief, and walks the other way down the hall
He passes a door
He opens it, but it's just a storage closet
He's about to shut it, but notices a stapler amidst the odds and ends
He hastily begins stapling his ear back on
'   - Donny's hears something, and turns to look
We think he's about to get up, but he then settles back in
, who puts on last staple in
Satisfied, he exits the closet and continues down the hall
'  - Ted looks around, and spots a phone on the counter
He jumps up, grabs the handset, and jumps back down
He dials John's number
- John is walking back to the Midtown Hotel
After a beat, Lori's car pulls up slowly alongside him
She leans over
Hey
Hey
() 109 : Kinda late to be walkin' home by yourself
Oh, 'll be okay
If  get raped, it'll be my fault with what 'm wearing
Listen, John
there's something  wanna say to you, too
He pauses, then gets into the car and sits down next to her
She prepares to speak, but John's phone rings
He shuts it off without looking at it
Go ahead
'  -  / Ted nervously holds the phone to his ear
'  -  / John,  just want you to know that mean,  hope you don't think that-- John's phone rings
He looks down at it, annoyed
It reads "Unknown caller
" He silences it
(') , um
just feel like we should
keep talking
Because-- John's phone rings again
Exasperated, he answers it
Whoever this is, it's not a good time
&     : John
It's me
Can you hear me
Ted
Lori sighs, slightly annoyed
(') Listen,  gotta call you back
() 110 : No, John
Don't hang up, 'm in trouble
What do you mean, what kinda trouble
Lori turns, slightly curious, but still annoyed
They got me
That freaky guy and his freaky fat kid
What
'm in their house, John
You gotta call the police, they won't let me outta here
They tore my ear off
Wait, slow down
Where are you
Uh
'm not sure, it's uh-- Suddenly, a hand grabs the phone away from Ted
He gasps and looks up
It's Donny, who slams the phone back down in its cradle
(dark, brewing rage) You're not a very polite guest
Shit
'  -  / ( ) Ted
Ted
Hello
Ted
What's the matter, is he all right
don't know
Where is he
don't know, but he's in trouble
() 111 : Why
What happened
Can you call him back
No, it's blocked-- wait a second
John scrambles for his wallet
He opens it, and pulls out the address given to him earlier by Donny at the Common
He looks at it, then points out the window
(') Go
Take Columbus to Herald and get on the expressway
- Lori's car peels out and races off
'  - Donny stands over Ted
You've put us in a pickle here, haven't you
We have to go now
Yeah, good idea
Ted runs through Donny's legs, and out into the hall
He races for the living room and the exit, but Robert steps in front of the door, blocking him
(') Aaaa
Found you
Robert turns the deadbolt on the door, locking it
Ted turns and bolts in the other direction back down the hallway, but sees Donny heading for him
Ted ducks into the dining room, as Donny lunges for him and misses
-   - Donny pursues Ted around the table
Ted ducks under the table, under the chairs, etc
trying to escape Donny (and Robert, who has entered the room)
Ted slips past them and back out into the hall
() 112 : He races for the door, but the deadbolt is too high to reach
He runs into the living room, and pushes open a door
-   - Ted tumbles down the dark stairs into the basement, which is lit only by a single bulb hanging from the ceiling
He lands, gets his bearings, then freezes in shock, as he sees that the basement is loaded with ripped and mutilated teddy bears
Donny and Robert move in to frame behind him
We tried to make do with other teddy bears
But none of them were you, Ted
Ted whirls around in shock, as we cut to: - John and Lori race through the streets of Boston
'  - It's this creepy fucked-up guy who wants Ted for his creepy fucked-up son
They got him somehow
Which way
Shoot up 99
-  - The car makes a hard left
'  -  - John finishes punching numbers into his cellphone
() 113 : ( ) Hello, 911
need the police right away
This guy took my teddy bear
() Hello
-  - Lori's car speeds away
'  - Donny and Robert emerge from the house
Donny clutches the sack
We can see it move as Ted struggles to get free
Robert gets in the back seat of the car as Donny opens the way back door, and dumps Ted inside
'  -  - Ted tumbles out of the sack and into the way back
Donny slams the door
He gets into the car
Robert, seat belt
Robert buckles up
'  -  - Donny pulls away down the alley
'  -  - Ted scrambles to his feet
'  -  - John looks around frantically, then spots something out of the passenger's side window
'  - They pass the alley, where we see Donny's car heading out of the alleyway
( ) Whoa whoa, stop stop stop
The car slows down, and John sees Donny's car make the turn out onto the street
Ted is looking out the back
114 '  -  - Johnny
Robert and Donny both hear this
Donny looks in his side- view mirror, just in time to see Lori's car swing a - turn to pursue them
Donny speeds up, and races off up the street
Lori's car speeds up in pursuit
- We do several quick cuts as the chase blasts its way through the Boston streets, avoiding traffic and pedestrians
-  - Donny's car races through the tunnel
Lori's car pursues
'  -  - Ted continues to stare out the back
He then notices a crowbar on the floor in the way back
He grabs it, and takes a hard swing at the rear window
It does not break
Robert sees this, and scrambles to undo his seat belt
'  -  - Come on, we're losing him
Lori speeds up
'  -  - Ted takes another swing at the window
The glass does not break
Robert undoes his seat belt, and scrambles back
He grabs Ted, who drops the crowbar
He starts to pull Ted back over into the back seat, but Ted manages to wriggle free
-  - The chase continues
115 '  -  - Ted grabs the crowbar, and again takes a swing at the window
This time, it shatters
He drops the crowbar, and climbs up onto the edge of the window
'  -  - They see Ted in the window
Get closer
'm trying
'  -  - Ted gets one leg and one arm up onto the edge of the window, when suddenly he is whacked hard in the side of the head, sending him tumbling onto the floor
We see that Robert has struck him hard with the crowbar
(holding head in pain) Aaaaa
Shit
'  -  - They continue watch with held breath, as they keep up
'  -  - Ted shakes himself off, still a little dazed, and climbs back up
Robert climbs into the way back and grabs one of his legs
No
You're being bad
Ted reaches down and grabs the crowbar with one arm, and brandishes it threateningly at Robert
Back off, Susan Boyle
Robert backs off in fear
Ted climbs out onto the rear of the car, and positions himself to make the jump
He tosses the crowbar away into the tunnel
John and Lori speed up, getting closer to him, so he can make the jump
116 '  -  - Easy
know
-- know
-  - Lori's car moves closer to Donny's
There's a tense moment with some back and forth cutting
and then Ted makes the jump
He lands on the hood of Lori's car, and slides across, grabbing the windshield wiper to avoid falling off
He pulls himself back up
John and Lori breathe energetic sighs of relief
Johnny
Total
Hooker, right
John and Lori laugh
Yes
Fuckin'  right
'  -  - Donny sees what's happening in his side mirror
He puts his foot on the brakes, and the car screeches as it drastically reduces speed
John's car slams into Donny's causing Ted to go flying back through open rear window of Donny's car, past Robert (who is still in the way back) and tumbling into the back seat
God dammit
Ted gets his bearings, and notices the sack that Donny captured him in, lying on the floor
He looks up at Donny for a beat, then grabs the sack
Donny driving
Suddenly, Ted jumps up from behind, and throws the sack over Donny's head, bracing himself against the back of the front seat
Donny yells in anger, and pulls at Ted, trying to get him off
117 -  - Donny's car scrapes against the side of the tunnel, sending sparks flying
'  -  - Donny grabs Ted and flings him off his face, onto the floor on the passengers' side
Donny rips the sack off his head, and reacts as he looks out the front window
He's approaching the end of the tunnel, and there is opposing traffic moving in the other direction
-  - Donny swerves past the traffic, narrowly avoiding clipping one of the cars
moment later, John and Lori come racing out of the tunnel
However, a truck drives through the intersection, stopping them in their tracks
Shit
She pounds on the steering wheel, frantically willing the truck to get out of the way
Finally it does, and they continue on into the city
-  - Donny's car races through the streets, pursued by John and Lori, who are catching up again, but are still a ways behind
'  -  - Ted is still on the floor on the passenger's seat side
He looks around, and spots a "Club" underneath the seat
He glances at Donny, whose eyes are on the road
Ted grabs the club, and scrambles up the seat, taking a swing at Donny
Donny ducks out of the way, and tries to slap Ted away as Ted continues to takes swings at him
few of them land, eventually drawing blood
Donny smacks Ted away
Ted tumbles back onto the passenger's seat
Then, with determination, he grabs the Club again, scurries in front of Donny, and locks the Club onto the steering wheel with a snap
Donny's eyes widen as Ted scrambles into the back seat
Donny tries to turn the wheel, but can't
118 -  - Donny's car swerves out of control, veering up the street, and crashing into a lamppost, fishtailing as it impacts
The airbags go off as the car comes to a stop
Taking advantage of the situation, Ted scrambles out the back window
He catches his fur on a jagged shard of glass, slightly ripping his side
He hangs and struggles for a bit, then drops to the ground
He sways a bit
'  - We see that his vision is swimming slightly
That little rip has done something
He shakes it off, and runs up the sidewalk
, who scrambles out of the wrecked car, followed by Robert
They chase Ted up the street
Ted spots a garage with the door slightly open
He squeezes himself underneath, and disappears inside
- They screech to a stop behind Donny's car
They hurry out, just in time to see Donny and Robert duck underneath the door
They run up the sidewalk after them
- Ted runs down a ramp, looking frantically around for an escape route
He darts off to the left, sprinting up a ramp, followed by Donny and Robert
Ted stops at a red metal fence, and squeezes through, rushing up the stairs on the other side
Donny reaches the fence, but with his larger size he has to climb over the top, which slows him down a bit
- We catch them ducking in through the garage door, and running inside
They look around for a beat
, who turns and sees them (Donny has already made it over the fence) (
) John and Lori turn just in time to see Robert charging at them
(') You can't have my teddy bear
When Robert reaches John, John knocks him down with one punch to the face
Robert collapses
Lori and John look down at him
Oh my god
() 119 : Sorry, someone had to go Joan Crawford on that kid
() Come on
John and Lori run up the ramp, leaving a stunned Robert behind
When they reach the red fence, they look around, but it's unclear which way Ted and Donny have gone
John continues up the ramp (in the wrong direction) with Lori just behind him
- Ted runs as fast as his stubby legs will carry him
Donny is in pursuit, and getting closer
The chase moves past a concession area, and up a few flights of stairs
- Ted runs out onto the upper level, and stops
The camera 180  and ascends to reveal the expanse of down below
few lights are on, and one lone maintenance man sweeps the dirt
Donny emerges from the stairwell, which snaps Ted out of it
Ted sprints past the front row of seats, and comes to a dead end
He has nowhere else to go
With Donny closing in, Ted scurries out onto the ledge, and pulls himself up onto the lighting tower
He looks down
From ' , it's a long drop
Donny reaches out to grab him, but can't quite reach
Donny glances down at the drop for a beat, then pulls himself out onto the ledge to go after Ted
Ted climbs farther up the tower
- John and Lori emerge and continue to look around frantically
They run up the walkway
- Donny pursues Ted up the tower
- John and Lori emerge into the lower seating section, and run down the aisle, looking around with desperation
() 120 : (spotting the action on the ) Look
John turns and sees the drama playing out on the distant lighting tower
Oh Jesus
() Stay here
Wait, John
What are you-- He turns and runs back up the aisle, toward the concession area
- Ted is starting to gain ground, but he slips, and falls back down
He's about to pulls himself up again, when Donny grabs one of his legs
- John continues up the aisle as fast as he can move
- Ted struggles to pull himself from Donny's grasp, but he can't
'  - The small rip from earlier begins to tear again
'  - His eyes go wide, and for a moment, his face freezes with fear
'  - His vision swims a bit more
He knows this is not good
- John reaches the top of the lower seating area, and sprints past the concession bar, heading for the stairs
121 - The struggle continues
As Ted tries to pull himself free, the rip gets bigger
He reacts again, and again we see his vision swimming even more
- John runs up the stairwell
- The struggle continues
Ted tries to pull himself up, but he's visibly weakened and his hands are slipping
-  - John continues up the stairwell
- Ted manages to pull free from Donny
He uses all his depleted strength to pull himself farther up
- John runs past the top of the stairwell, and sprints over toward the lighting tower, just in time to see
- Donny makes one final reach for Ted
He grabs Ted by the foot again, and pulls hard
With one great , Ted tears into two pieces
As John watches in shock, Ted falls through the air in -, a shower of white stuffing descending with him
Lori watches with a hand over her mouth
The two halves of Ted land, along with the scattered white stuffing
Donny, still hanging, stares down at the fallen teddy bear
He starts pulling himself back over the ledge
We lead and follow John as he runs back down through the stadium with desperate numbness
Lori climbs over the edge of the seating area, and runs toward him as well
, who pulls himself back over into the upper seating area
He hears the sound of a cop siren, and peers over the edge of the stadium
Seeing a cop car pull up far below, he makes a break for it
() 122 : Down below, Ted's top half lies on the grass, looking around in a daze, like a badly wounded soldier for whom there is not much hope
John and Lori race to his side, and kneel down
Ted
Oh my God
(weak, slow breathing) Johnny
Ted looks glassy-eyed for a beat
John starts to frantically gather up the chunks of stuffing
Lori, get the stuffing
Get it all
Lori starts helping him, desperately grabbing chunks of the white cotton
Johnny
John leans back over Ted
You're gonna be okay, buddy
you understand
You're gonna be fine
() Jesus,  look like the robot from "Aliens"
No, look at me, buddy
promise, you're gonna be okay
don't think so
'm
'm in trouble
need
need to tell you something
What is it
Don't
don't ever lose her again
She's the most important
most important part of your life
() () 123 : (') Even more than me
She's your thunder buddy now
She's-- Ted closes his eyes
and dies as we pull away, and it starts to rain
'  - The rain is pouring now
Lori's car pulls up
She and John hurry out, John holding the remains of Ted
They race inside
'  - John and Lori burst in with the remains of Ted
They're both drenched from the rain
Lori frantically searches drawers for sewing materials
She finds a needle and thread, and John puts Ted on the table
Lori starts to sew him up as John watches intently
John
don't know if this is gonna-- Just try
Please
Just try
She continues sewing, until she is all finished
They wait
Ted still does not move
John and Lori lower their heads
- John sits on the couch, head in hands
Ted still lies on the coffee table
Lori enters with a blanket, and drapes it around him
She sits down next to him, bringing part of the blanket around herself
She places a hand on his shoulder
John
'm sorry
You did everything you could
'm
'm just so sorry
She gently puts an arm around him
There is a thunderclap outside
John does not react
(') (almost too softly to be ) You're not afraid
() 124 : (shortly after) as a white sofa blanket is placed over him
John and Lori shut off the lights, and exit
: ' / - John is asleep, but we see that Lori is still lying awake
She sighs restlessly, and gets up
She walks over to the window, and looks out
'  - - We see a cloudy sky, much like the one from that night when John was a child
As before, there is a small clear patch in the center
shooting star whizzes by through the opening
'  - Lori's eyes widen a bit in recognition
She stares at the shooting star for a beat, then closes her eyes and makes a wish
/
'  - '  - John wakes up, looks around groggily, then remembers
He gets out of bed, and walks toward the living room
- He pauses for a beat
and walks in
The blanket is where it was left
John slowly removes it
Ted is still motionless
John lowers his head sadly
Suddenly, Ted's eyes snap open
Ted
(- ) 'm alive, Johnny
Oh my god
() 125 : (- ) 'm alive
Your magical wish worked
You're back
(- ) Yeah
mean, when you sewed me up, you put some of the stuffing in the wrong places, so 'm a little fucked up
Will you take care of me forever and ever
John stares at him, confused
(') ( ) Nah, 'm just kiddin' ya,  thought it'd be funny if you thought  was fuckin' retarded
You asshole
John grabs him and hugs him
Lori enters
She sees what's happening, and a huge smile crosses her face
Welcome back, Ted
John turns to Lori, and realizes
It
it was you
You did it
(cover this line with addition:) It was your wish
(smiling, speechless) Son of a bitch
You wished for my life back
She smiles at him
No
wished for my life back
Because love you both
John goes to her, and kisses her passionately
You were pretty great out there at Fenway, Johnny
() 126 : Yeah, that's my big brave man
Oh my god, do you know how awesome it was punching a kid
felt so powerful mean if that's what it's like to hit a woman, watch out,  liked it
() love you
love you, too
() And,  want you to know that
'm probably never gonna be any more than a guy who rents cars, but
don't care
You're the only thing that matters in my life
(
) -- You and Ted
(
) Yes
And after last night,
don't ever want to lose anyone who matters to me ever again
'm not gonna wait any longer for my life to start
Lori
will you marry me
(beat, she smiles) That's all  ever wanted
John and Lori kiss as we pull away
(
) And so John, Lori, and Ted lived happily ever after, having discovered at last that all they really needed was each other
John and Lori were married in a beautiful ceremony in Cambridge, by a very special Justice of the Peace
127 - We hear the Flash Gordon Wedding March as we   Sam Jones standing in robes at the altar
Ted, in a tux, stands in the best man's position
John stands on the steps smiling and looking out as we cut to
Lori, walking down the aisle in a wedding dress, smiling warmly
to shortly after, as Sam Jones addresses the two of them, standing at the altar
now pronounce you man and wife
You may kiss the bride
John and Lori kiss each other
They turn and wave to the cheering crowd
Ted waves happily to John, who waves back
John and Lori run down the aisle joyfully, passing pews full of people from the movie: Lori's co-workers, John's co-workers, (Guy sitting with  , Alix and Tanya, etc
)
- John and Lori come running out of the church, as the crowd throws rice at them
They run to a waiting limo with a "Just Married" sign on the back
John gets in, and Lori turns to throw the bouquet toward Gina, Michelle, Tracy, and Tanya
Tanya catches it
She turns and smiles at Alix
Then suddenly, Tami-Lynn bursts into frame, punching Tanya in the jaw
Tanya goes down as Tami-Lynn tackles her, and the crowd tries to pull her off
the limo as it pulls away
Ted stands next to Sam
Jones, watching with a smile as his best friend heads off
'know Sam, there's only one way to end a perfect day
What's that
On three
What on three
