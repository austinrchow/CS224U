Withnail and Withnail and Camden Town, London
1969 The Flat
[ few shafts of sunlight sneak through the curtains and illuminate a sitting room
There are empty bottles everywhere
'', who is smoking a joint, gets up somewhat precariously and walks into a kitchen which is full of bottles and dirty washing up
He lights the gas on the stove and puts on the kettle
] ['' knocks on the door to Withnail's bedroom] : 'm having a cup of tea, do you want one
[He waits for a response
] : Do you want a cup of tea Withnail
Withnail: No
['' leaves the flat, slamming the front door behind him] --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Cafe ['' is reading a paper at a table in the cafe
The proprietor is cooking eggs in a frying pan full of grease
She takes one out, inserts it between two slices of bread and places it in front of an elderly woman who inspects it doubtfully and bites into the sandwhich
Yolk runs out of the other edge
'' turns his attention to his paper
The story is about a transexual, the headline 'Love made up my mind,  had to become a woman'
He looks around at the other customers
] [mentally]: Thirteen million Londoners have to cope with this, and bake beans and allbran and rape, and 'm sitting in this bloody shack and  can't cope with Withnail
must be out of my mind
must go home at once and discuss his problems in depth
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Flat [ stumbles up the barely lit stairs looking unwell
Withnail emerges from his room holding a bottle and glass and follows him
] Withnail: have some extremely distressing news
: don't want to hear it
don't want to hear anything
Oh God, it's a nightmare out there  tell you
Withnail [pouring some wine]: We've just run out of wine what are we going to do about it
: don't know
don't know
don't feel good
Look
My thumbs have gone weird
'm in the middle of a fucking overdose
My hearts beating like a fucked clock
feel dreadful,  feel fucking dreadful
Withnail: So do
So does everyone
Look at my tongue
grey yellow sock
Sit down for Christ's sake, what's the matter with you
Eat some sugar
[ goes into the kitchen which is by now full of steam and turns off the kettle
Withnail follows him around reading from a newspaper
] Withnail: Listen to this
"Curse of the superman
took drugs to win medals said top athlete Geoff Woade
" : Where's the coffee
Withnail [reading from the paper]: "In a world exclusive interview 33 year old shot putter Geoff Woade who weight 317 pounds, admitted taking massive doses of anabolic steroids, drugs banned in sport
It used to get him bad tempered and act down said his wife
He used to pick on me
But now he's stopped his much better in our sex life and in our general life
" [ pours water from the kettle into a bowl and goes back into the living room
Withnail follows him
] Withnail: My God, this huge, thatched head with its earlobes and cannonball is now considered sane
"Geoff Woade is feeling better and is now prepared to step back into society and start tossing his orb about
" Look at him
Look at Geoff Woade
His head must weight fifty pounds on its own
[Withnail stands infront of a mirror and brushes his long, greasy hair with a comb
sits on the settee and starts drinking the coffee from the bowl using a spoon
] Withnail: Imagine the size of his balls
Imagine getting into a fight with the fucker
: Please
don't feel good
Withnail: That's what you'd say but that wouldn't wash with Geoff
No
He'd like a bit of pleading
Add spice to it
In fact, he'd probably tell you what he was going to do before he did it
"'m going to pull you head off"
"Oh no, please, don't pull my head off"
"'m going to pull your head off because  don't like your head
" [he notives  drinking from the bowl
] Withnail: Have you got soup
Why didn't  get any soup
: Coffee Withnail: Why don't you use a cup like any other human being
: Why don't you wash up occasionally like any other human being
Withnail: How dare you
How dare you
How dare you call me inhumane
: didn't call you inhumane, you merely imagined it
Calm down
Withnail: Right you fucker - 'm going to do the washing up
[He strides towards the kitchen
jumps over the arm of the settee and stops him
] : No no you can't
It's impossible  swear it
've looked into in
Listen to me listen to me
There are things in there, there's a tea-bag growing
You haven't slept in sixty hours you're in no state to tackle it
Wait till the morning we'll go in together
Withnail: This is the morning
Stand aside
: You don't understand
think there may be something alive
Withnail: What do you mean
a rat
: It's possible, it's possible
Withnail [brandishing his comb]: Then the fucker will rue the day
[He rushes up the the sink
] Withnail: Oh Christ Almighty
Synous nicotine based
Keep back, keep back
The entire sink's gone rotten
don't know what's in here
[He picks up the kettle from the stove then throws it suddenly into the sink
] : told you
you've been bitten
Withnail: Burnt, burnt, the fucking kettle's on fire
: There's something floating up
Withnail [with a fork in his hand]: Fork it
: No no no,  don't want to touch it
Withnail: You must you must
The poop will boil through the glaze
We'll never be able to use the dinner service again
[He rumages about in a drawer
] Withnail: Here, get it with the pliers
: No, no, no, no, no, no
Give me the gloves
Withnail: That's right, put on the gloves
Don't attempt anything without the gloves
[ starts to move things about in the sink rather gingerly
] Withnail: What is it
What have you found
: Matter
Withnail: Matter
Where's it coming from
: Don't look
Don't look
'm dealing with it
Withnail: think we've been in here too long
feel unusual
think we should go outside
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Park [Withnail and  walk along a path in the park
] Withnail: This is ridiculous, look at me
'm thirty in a month and 've got a sole flapping off my shoe
: It'll get better, it has to
Withnail: Easy for you to say lovey
You've had an audition
Why can't  have an audition
It's ridiculous: 've been to drama school
'm good looking
tell you, 've a fuck sight more talent that half the rubbish that gets of
Why can't  get on
: Well  don't know
It'll happen
Withnail: Will it
That's what you say
The only programme 'm likely to get on is the fucking news
tell you,  can't take much more of this
'm going to crack
: 'm in the same boat
Withnail: Yeah, yeah
feel as sick as a pike
'm going to have to sit down
[ They sit at a bench in the park
] : You know what we should do
say, you know what we should do
Withnail: How should  possibly know what we should do
What should we do
: Get out of it for a while
Get into the countryside
Rejuvenate
Withnail: Rejuvenate
'm in a park and 'm practically dead
What good's the countryside
What time is it
: It's eight
Withnail: Fours hours to opening time
God help us
Have we got any embrocation
: What for
Withnail: To rub on ourselves you fool
We'll cover ourselves in deep heat and get up against a radiator
Keep ourselves alive until twelve
[He spits
] Withnail: Jesus, look at that
Apart from a raw potato that's the only solid to have passed my lips in the last sixty hours
must be ill
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Flat [ is writting in a notebook on the settee while Withnail wonders round wearing his overcoat and his underpants, smearing himself with deep heat
] [mentally]: Even a stopped clock tells the right time twice a day
And for once 'm inclined to believe Withnail is right; we are indeed drifting into the arena of the unwell
Making an enemy of our own future
What we need is harmony
Fresh air
Stuff like that
Withnail: Wasn't much in the tube
there's nothing left for you
: Why don't you ask your father for some money
If we had some money we could go away
Withnail [inspecting a bottle for dregs]: Why don't you ask your father
How can it be so cold in here
It's like Greenland in here
We've got to get some booze
It's the only solution to this intense cold
Something's got to be done
We can't go on like this
'm a trained actor reduced to the status of a bum
mean look at us
Nothing that reasonable members of society demand as their rights
No fridges, no televisions, no phones
Much more of this and 'm going to apply for meals on wheels
: What happened to your cigar commercial
Withnail: That's what  want to know
what happened to my cigar commercial
What happened to my agent
Bastard must have died
: September
Bad patch
Withnail: Rubbish
Haven't seen Gylgod down the labour exchange
Why doesn't he retire
[He picks up a paper
] Withnail: Look at this little bastard
Boy lands plumb role for top Italian director
Of course his does
Probably on a tenner a day and i know what for: Two pound ten a tit and a fiver for his arse
[He points accusingly at
] Withnail: Have you been at the controls
: What are you talking about
Withnail: The thermostats
what have you done to them
: haven't touched them
Withnail: Then why has my head gone numb
must have some booze
demand to have some booze
[He lunges towards the mantlepiece where there is a bottle of lighter fluid
] [standing up]: wouldn't drink that if  were you
Withnail: Why not
: Because  don't advise it
Even the wankers on the site wouldn't drink that
That's worse than meths
Withnail: Nonsense, this is a far superior drink to meths
The wankers don't drink it because they can't afford it
[He pours the contents of the bottle into his upturned mouth
] Withnail: Ah
Ah
Have you got anymore
[ shakes his head
Withnail presses forwards and  backs off
] Withnail: Liar, what's in your toolbox
: No we have nothing
Sit down
Withnail: Liar, you've got antifreeze
: You bloody fool
You should never mix your drinks
[Withnail laughs histerically, collapses to the floor and emits unpleasant vomitting noises
] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The Street [They walk towards a rather rough looking pub: 'The Old Mother Blackcap'
] Withnail: All right, this is the plan
We get in there and get wrecked
Then we'll eat a pork pie
Then we drop a couple of soamser fifties each; means we'll miss out Monday but come up smilling Tuesday morning
What's that appalling smell
: Perfume on my boots
had to scrub the with essence of petunia
---------------------------------------------------------------------- The Pub [Withnail moves somewhat precariously to the bar
The pub is a simple affair with a few men sat round at tables drinking
] Withnail: Two large gins, two pints of cider
Ice in the cider
: If my father was loaded 'd ask him for some money
Withnail: If your father was my father you wouldn't get it
Barman: : There you are lads
Withnail: Chin chin
[Withnail chinks his glass against the other, which  has not picked up yet, and downs the gin in one
follows suit but gags slightly
] : Ugh
What about what-his-name
Withnail: What about him
: Why don't you give him a call
Withnail: What for
: Ask him about his house
Withnail: You want me to call what-his-name and ask him about his house
: Why not
Withnail: Alright
what's his number
: 've no idea - 've never met him
Withnail: Well neither have
What the fuck are you talking about
: Your relative with a house in the country
Withnail: Monty
Uncle Monty
: That's him
That's the one
Get the Jag fixed up
Spend the weekend in the country
Withnail: Alright
Give us a tenner and 'll give him a bell
: Get a couple more in
'm going for a slash
[Next to the door to the gents is a rather large Irish man sat with his pint and his paper
] Big Irish man: Ponce [ ignores him and goes into the gents
] [to himself]: could hardly piss straight with fear
he was a man with 3/4 of an inch of brain who'd taken a dislike to me
What had  done to offend him
don't consciously offend big men like this
And this one's a decided imbalance of hormone in him
Get any more masculine than that and you'd have to live up a tree
[he reads the grafitti] ' fuck arses', Who fucks arses
[aloud] Maybe he fucks arses
[to himself again] Maybe he's written this in some moment of drunken sincerity
'm in considerable danger in here
must get out of here at once
[He walks back into the bar
] Big Irish man: Perfumed ponce
[Withnail is still at the bar
He has made considerable progress with his cider and is eating some snack
] Withnail: You'll be pleased to hear Monte's invited us for drinks
: Balls to Monty we're getting out
Withnail: Balls to Monty
've just spent an hour flattering the bugger
: There's a man over there doesn't like the perfume
The big one
Don't look, don't look
We're in danger, we've got to get out
Withnail: What are you talking about
: 've been called a ponce
[Withnail turns to address the room in general
] Withnail: What fucker said that
[The large Irish gentleman in the corner gets up and walks over to them
Now he is upright we see he is very large indeed and does not look friendly
] Big Irish man: called him a ponce
And now 'm calling you one
Ponce
Withnail (smiling): Would you like a drink
Big Irish man: What's your name McFuck
[As he says this he jerks the scarf from around Withnail's neck
] Withnail: 've a heart condition
've a heart condition
If you hit me it's murder
Big Irish man: 'll murder the pair of y'ers
Withnail: My wife's having a baby
Listen,  don't know what my f
[he starts to say friend but decides on a better course of action] acquaintance did to upset you but it's nothing to do with me
suggest you both go outside and discuss it sensibly, in the street
[They push past the man and rush to the door
] Withnail: Ahhhh, out of my way
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Bathroom [ is in the bath shaving
] : Speed is like a dozen transatlantic flights without ever getting off the plane
Timechange
You lose, you gain
Makes no difference so long as you keep taking the pills
But sooner or later you've got to get out because it's crashing then all at once the frozen hours melt out through the nervous system and seep out the pores
[Withnail enters with their lunch from the chippy] Withnail: The bastards
Justice suck
It's a miserable cheap cigar and the bastards won't see me
: Why are we having lunch in here
Withnail: It's dinner and Danny's here
: Danny
How did he get in
Withnail: let him in this morning
He lost one of his clogs
He's come in because of the perpetual cold
hope the buggers sales plummet
: 've got your savaloy
Here
don't want it
Withnail: Then stick it in the soap tray and save it for later
[He scrunches up the paper that was holding his chips and puts it in the toilet] : Don't vent spleen on me
'm in the same boat
Withnail: Stop saying that
You're not in the same boat
The only thing you're in that 've been in is this fucking bath
: Danny's here
Head hunter to his friends
Head hunter to everybody
He doesn't have any friends
The only people he converses with are his clients and occasionally the police
The purveyor of rare herbs and prescribed chemicals is back
Will we never be set free
---------------------------------------------------------------------- The Flat [ comes out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel
] : Danny
Danny: You're looking very beautiful man
Have you been away
St
Peter preached the epistles to the apostles looking like that
Have you got any food
: Mmm, As a matter of fact, got a savaloy
Danny: How much is it
: You can have it for nothing
[Danny sniffs the sausage
Withnail enters from the kitchen gluing the sole back on his shoe
He is wearing a rather expensive looking suit
] Danny: see you're wearing a suit
Withnail: What's it got to do with you
Danny: No need to get uptight man
was merely making an observation happened to be looking for a suit for the coal man two weeks ago
For reasons  can't really discuss with you the coal man had to go to Jamaica
Got busted coming back through Heathrow, had the weight under his fez
We wored out that it would be handycarma for him to get hold of a suit but he's a very low temperature spade the coal man, went into court wearing a kaftan and a bell
This doesn't go down at all well
They can handle the kaftan but they can't handle the bell
So there's this judge sitting there sitting in a cape like fucking batman with this really rather far out looking hat Withnail: wig
Danny: No man, this was more like a long white hat
So he looks at the coalman and says 'what's all this
This is a court man
This ain't fancy dress' and the coal man looks at him and says 'you think you look normal, your honour
'
Cunt give him two years
[ laughs a little
Withnail looks on unamuzed
] Danny: 'm afraid  can't offer you gentlemen anything
: That's alright Danny
We'd decided to lay off for a bit
Danny: That's what  thought
Except for personal use  concur with you
as a matter of fact i was thinking of retiring and going into business Withnail [Scoffing]: Doing what
Danny: The toy industry
[There is a stange looking contraption on the table involving a bottle
] Withnail: Thought you were in the bottle industry
Danny: No man, that's a side line
You can have that
Instructions are included
Yeah
My partner's got a really good idea for making dolls
His name's 'Presuming Ed'
His sister give him the idea
She got a doll on Christmas what pisses itself
Withnail: Really
Danny: Then you've got to change its draws for it
Horrible really but they're like that the little girls
So we're going to make one that shits itself too
Withnail: Shits itself
Danny: He's an expert
He's building the prototype now
[To ] Why's he behaving so uptightly
Withnail: Because a gang of cheroot vendors consider a hair cut beyond the limit of my abilities Danny: don't advise a hair cut man
All hairdressers are in the employment of the government
Hair are your aerials
They pick up signals from the cosmos and transmit them directly into the brain
This is the reason bold-headed men are uptight
Withnail: What absolute twaddle
Danny: Has he just been busted
: No
Danny: Then why's he wearing that old suit
Withnail: Old suit
This suit was cut by Hawke's of Saville row
Just because the best tailoring you've ever seen is above you fucking appendix doesn't mean anything
Danny: Don't get uptight with me man
Because if you do 'll have to give you a dose of medicine and if  spike you you'll know you've been spoken to
Withnail: You wouldn't spike me you're too mean
Besides, there's nothing invented  couldn't take
Danny: If  medicined you you'd think a brain tumour was a birthday present
Withnail: could take double anything you could
Danny [removing his sunglasses]: Very, very foolish words man
: He's right Withnail
Look at him
His mechanisms gone
He's had more drugs than you've had hot dinners
Withnail: 'm not having this shag-sack insulting me
Let him get his drugs out
[Danny gets a doll out of a bag
] Danny: This doll is extremely dangerous
It has voodoo qualities
[Withnail snorts
Danny takes the head off the doll and extracts a handful of pills
] Danny: Trade: Phenodihydrochloride benzelex
Street: The embalmer
Withnail: Balls
'll swallow it and run a mile
Danny: Cool your boots man
This pill's valued at two quid
Withnail: Two quid
You're out of your mind
: That's sense Withnail
Withnail: You can stuff it up your arse for nothing and fuck off while you're doing it
Danny: No need to insult me man
was leaving anyway
Have either of you got shoes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Monte's house [ battered Jag pulls up outside Monte's house and Withnail and  get out
There is a rather flash looking open-topped Rolls parked outside
The sound of a Schubert piano sonata comes from the house
] Withnail: Monte's car
[Withnail knocks on the door
Monte, a rather fat, effeminate, middle-aged gentleman, opens the door
He is holding a very large fluffy cat and a watering can
] Monty: Oh hello
Come in
[They enter and go into the lounge
] Monty: Sit down do
Would you like a drink
[They sit together on a sette
] Withnail: Sherry
Monty: [To withnail] Sherry
[To ] Sherry
: Sherry
Monty: Sherry
[Monty moves to the sideboard and pours the drinks
Withnail lights up yet another cigarette
] Monty: Do you like vegetables
've always been fond of root crops but  only started to grow last summer
happen to think the cauliflower more beautiful than the rose
Withnail: Chin chin
[He drinks the sherry
] Monty: Do you grow
Withnail: Geraniums
Monty: Oh you little traitors
think the carrot infinitely more fascinating than the geranium
The carrot has mystery
Flowers are essentially tarts
Prostitutes for the bees
There is you'll agree a certain je ne ses quoi oh so very special about a firm young carrot
Excuse me
Do help yourselves to another drink
[Withnail turns and reaches a bottle over from the sideboard
He takes a long swig
] : What's all this
The man's mad
Withnail: Eccentric
: Eccentric
He's insane
Not only that he's a raving homosexual
[There is a yowl from the cat
Monte storms back into the room preceded by the cat
] Monty: You beastly little parasite
How dare you
You little thug
How dare you
Ooohhhh
Beastly ungrateful little swine
[He deposits his considerable bulk on the other settee, facing the first
] Withnail: Shall  get you a drink Monte
Monty: Yes
Yes please dear boy
You can prepare me a small rhesus negative Bloody Mary
And you must tell me all the news
haven't seen you since you finished your last film
[ smiles wriley to himself
Withnail downs the drink he has prepared for himself, pours another and starts making the Bloody Mary for Monty
] Withnail: Rather busy uncle
and stuff
My agent's trying to edge me towards the Royal Shakespeare again
Monty: Oh splendid
Withnail: He's just had an audition for rep
Monty: Oh splendid
So you're a thespian too
[Withnail delivers Monte's drink and sits beside him
] Withnail: Monte used to act
Monty: 'd hardly say that
It's true  crept the boards in my youth but never had it in my blood and that's what so essential isn't it
Theatrical zeal in the veins
Alas,  have little more that vintage wine and memories
[He stands and looks at a photograph on the mantlepiece
] Monty: It is the most shattering experience of a young man's life when he awakes and quite reasonable says to himself: [He puts his hand on his heart]  will never play The Dane
When that moment comes, ones ambition ceases
Don't you agree
Withnail: part  intend to play, Uncle
Monty: And you'll be marvelous
[He starts quoting from Hamlet] We do it wrong, being so majestical
To offer it the show of violence
[As Monte rambles in the background  steps over to Withnail and whispers
] : He's a madman
Any moment now he's going to rush out and get into his tights
Withnail: Ok ok
Give me a minute
: The house or out
[Withnail stands and moves over to Monte
] Withnail: Could  have a word with you Monte
Monty: Oh forgive me dear boy, forgive me
was allowing memories to have the better of me
Withnail: Shall  get you a top up
[He moves to the sideboard again
Monte sits down and reminisces
] Monty: Indeed  remember my first agent
Raymond Duck
Dreadful little Israelite
Four floors up at the charring cross and never a job at the top of them
'm told you're a writer too
Do you write poems
: No,  wish  could
It's just thoughts really
Monty: Have you published
: No no
Monty: Where did you school
Withnail: He went to the other place Monte
Monty: Oh you went to Eton
[The cat reappears on 's chair
] Monty: Get that damned little swine out of here
It's trying to get itself in with you
It's trying for even more advantage
It's obsessed with its gut - its like a rugby ball now
It will die, it will die
[He storms around ineffectually
] Withnail: Monte, Monte
Monty: No dear boy you must leave, you must leave
Once again that oaf has destroyed my day
Withnail: Listen Monte
Can  just have a quick word in private
Monty: Oh, very well
[Later they are leaving the house
Monty shows them to the door
] Monty: Good night my dears
Withnail: Good night Monty
[Monty closes the inner door to the porch behind them
] : What's all this going off in private business
Why did you tell him went to Eton
Withnail: Because it wouldn't have helped if  hadn't
: What do you mean by that
Withnail [Showing him the key to the cottage
]: Free to those that can afford it
Very expensive to those that can't
---------------------------------------------------------------------- The car [They leave Camden in 's battered old Jag
Withnail, still in his suit, has a bottle and is clearly drunk
They pass some schoolgirls
] Withnail: Scrubbers
Scrubber: Up yours grandad
Withnail: Scrubbers
scrubbers
: Shut up
Withnail: Little tarts they love it
: Listen, 'm trying to drive this thing as quietly as possible
If you don't shut up we'll get stopped by the police
[The pass a notice anouncing an accident blackspot
] Withnail: Look at that, look at that
Accident black spot
These aren't accidents
They're throwing themselves into the road gladly
Throwing themselves into the road to escape all this hideousness
[To a pedestrian] Throw yourselves into the road darling, you haven't got a chance
[Somewhat later they join the motorway
] Withnail: At some point or another  want to stop and get hold of a child
: What do you want a child for
Withnail: To tutor it in the ways of righteousness and procure some uncontaminated urine
[He takes out the bottle and instructions provided by Danny
] Withnail: This is a device enabling the drunken driver to operate in absolute safety
You fill this with piss, take this pipe down the trouser and sellotape this valve to the end of the old chap
Then you get horrible drunk and they can't fucking touch you
According to these instructions, you refuse everything except a urine sample
You undo your valve, give them a dose of unadulterated child's piss and they have to give you your keys back
Danny's a genius
'm going to have a doze
[They drive on
Later, with the light fading, they leave the motorway
It becomes clear that the car has only one functioning headlight
Still later it is totally dark and raining heavily stops and attempts to transfer the single wiper from Withnail's side of the car to his own but it refuses to come off
He gets back in the car and in shutting the door wakes Withnail, who looks considerably the worse for wear
] Withnail: Are we there
: No, we're not we're here and we're in the middle of a fucking gale
Now you'll have to keep a look out your side
If you see anything tell me
Get hold of that map
Withnail: Where's the whisky
: What for
Withnail: 've got a bastard behind the eyes
can't take aspirins without a drink
Where's the aspirin
: Probably in the bathroom
Withnail: You mean we've come out here in the middle of fucking nowhere without aspirins
: Where are we
Withnail: How should i know where we are
feel like a pig shat in my head
: Now get hold of that map and look for a place called Crow Crag
---------------------------------------------------------------------- The cottage [They draw up in a yard and get out of the car
Withnail staggers around aimlessly as  gets the baggage from the boot
] Withnail: There must and shall be aspirins
: Give me the key and get out of the way
Withnail: If  don't get aspirin  shall die here on this fucking mountainside
[They enter the house
lights a match and finds a lantern which he lights
As the light comes up the inside of the cottage becomes visible
It is rather spartan
] Withnail: Christ almighty [ looks round a little more thouroughly
He notices a picture of Monty on the wall
] : Monty
[He looks accross to Withnail who is sat dejectedly in a chair
] : What are you doing
Withnail: Sitting down to enjoy my holiday : Right, now we're going to have to approach this scientifically
First thing we've got to do is get this fire alight, then we split into two fact finding groups
'll deal with the water and the plumbings, you check the fuel and wood situation
[ little later Withnail re-enters the cottage from a rather wet and windy night
He is holding a small stick
] : What's that
Withnail: The fuel and wood situation
There's nothing out there except a hurricane
This place is uninhabitable
[They sit close to the fire, which is rather small
] : Give it a chance
It's got to warm up Withnail: Warm up
We may as well sit round a cigarette
This is ridiculous
We'll be found dead in here next spring
[He attemps half-heartedly to light a cigarette
] Withnail: 've got a blinding fucking headache
Got to have heat
[He stands and smashes a chair against the floor
little later the fire is burning considerably higher
] Withnail: Problem's we've got to keep this bastard burning : Well we've got enough furniture for tonight
Tomorrow we get down that farm and get some logs
Withnail: This is a mistake  tell you
This is a dreadful mistake
---------------------------------------------------------------------- 's bedroom [ wakes the next morning and gets out of bed
He checks on Withnail who is still asleep
He steps outside and walks accross the yard to examine the view
It is quite magnificent
Later, he is dressed and walks down to the farm
The building is surrounded by an assortment of farmyard junk
He knocks at the door] Old woman: Who's there
: Me
[The door opens cautiously and an old woman peers out inquiringly
] Old woman: What do you want
: 'm a friend of Montague Withnail
He's lent us his cottage wondered if you could sell us some food
Eggs and things
[She looks blankly at him
] : What about wood and coal
[Again, he elicits no responce
Seeing she is wearing a hearing aid, he bends down and talks directly to it
] : 'm not from London you know
Old woman: don't care where you come from
[She slams the door
walks away
] : [to himself] Not the attitude 'd been given to expect from the Bates novel 'd read
thought they'd all be out the back drinking cider, discussing butter
Clearly a myth
Evidently country people and no more receptive to strangers than city dwellers
[He walks back to the house and addresses the door
] : Do you think you could tell me where  could buy some coal and wood
Old woman: You'll have to see my son
He runs this farm
: Where is you son
Old woman: Up in top field
You can't miss him, his legs bound in polythyne
---------------------------------------------------------------------- The cottage [ walks back into the yard outside the cottage, slips, and falls in the mud
He picks himself up and storms inside
] : Withnail you bastard wake up
[He bangs on the ceiling and moves to the sink to wash
] : Oye, wake up you bastard you've got to get wood
[Withnail enters, dressed already and wrapped in a blanket
] Withnail: Jesus, you're covered in shit
: tried to get fuel and wood, there's a miserable little pensioner down there wouldn't give it me
Withnail: Where are we going to get it then
: There's a man up on the mountain
Why he's up there, fuck knows, but he's up there with a leg bound in polythene, you can't miss him, he's your man
And have another look in that shed
Find anything
If you can't find anything, bring in the shed
[Later, they are sat down to a simple lunch
] : How come Monty owns such a horrible little shack
Withnail: No idea
: You never discuss your family do you
Withnail: fail to see my family's of any interest to you
've absolutely no interest in yours
dislike relatives in general and in particular mine
: Why
Withnail: 've told you why
We're incompatible
They don't like me being on stage
[He stands up and takes a foil from its bracket on the wall and strides up and down in actorly fashion
] : Then they must be delighted with your career
Withnail: What do you mean
: You rarely are
[Withnail points the sword menacingly, although there is a cork on the end
] Withnail: You just wait
Just you wait
When  strike they won't know what hit them
[He hears a noise from outside
] Withnail: Tractor approaching
[He goes to the window and knocks his head on the lantern hanging from the ceiling
] : Then get after it
That's the man
[They rush out of the cottage and pursue the tractor
] Withnail: Hey, stop
: Stop Withnail: Stop : Stop please
[The tractor driver notices them and stops
] Withnail: Stop please
Please stop
[They run up to the side of the tractor and address the driver, Mr Parkin
] Withnail: Are you the farmer
[To ] Shut up, 'll deal with this
[to Parkin] We've gone on holiday by mistake
We're in this cottage here
Are you the farmer
: Stop saying that Withnail, of course he's the fucking farmer
[To Parkin] We're friends of Montague Withnail, we desperately need fuel and wood
[The farmer shakes his head, bewildered
] : Montegue Withnail, you must know him
Fat man, owns the cottage
Parkin: Ay, seen the fat man
London type
Queer sort
Think his name's French or something
Withnail: French
Parkin: Ay, Adrian de la Touche
He hasn't been up year for couple of years
Last time  saw him, he were; he were with his son
: Yeah, that's him
Withnail: Listen, we're bona fide
We're not from London
Could we have some fuel and wood
Parkin: Ay,  could bring you up some logs later but 've got the cows and that to feed first
Withnail: When
: Shut up
That would be very kind of you
Erm, what about food
Do you think you could sell us something to eat
Parkin: could bring you up a chicken but you'll have to go to the village really
: That would be very kind of you Mr
Parkin: Parkin : Mr Parkin
What happened to your leg
Parkin: Got a randy bull up there
Give me one in knee
[They walk back inside
claps Withnail on the back
Back inside, Withnail removes his boots and places them in the oven attached to the fire
] : You want to get out the back don't you
Get some spuds up
Withnail: Sorry  can't
My boots are in the oven : You'd go if you had boots
Withnail: Gladly [Withnail emerges from the back door with polythene bags tied around his feet
He walks into the garden and after a little unearths a potato
] Withnail: 've got one
[Later, the potatoes are peeled and ready to be cooked
sits reading 'Journey's end' while Withnail dozes in front of the fire
hears the tractor once again and goes out to meet Parkin
He is there with some logs
] : Great
How much do we own you
Parkin: Pay us when you come down : What about this chicken
Parkin: 's on back [Back inside  has left the chicken on the table
It is alive and looks round questioningly
He nudges Withnail to wake him
] : Oye
Oye
Parkin's been
There's the supper
Withnail: What are we supposed to do with that
: Eat it Withnail: Eat it
Fucker's alive : Yeah, you've got to kill it
Withnail: Me
'm the firelighter and fuel collecter
: Yeah  know but  got the logs in
It takes away your appitite just looking at it
Withnail: No it doesn't 'm starving
How can we make it die
: You've got to throttle them
Withnail,  think you ought to kill it instantly in case it starts trying to make friends with us
Withnail: Alright, you get hold of ir
'll strangle it
: can't
Those dreadful, beady eyes
They stare you out
Withnail: It's a bloody chicken
Just think of it with bacon across its back
Right, 'll deal with this
You'll have to get its guts out
[Later,  is washing his hands in the sink having finished getting the chickens guts out
Withnail enters with a shotgun and points it at 's head
] : Never point guns at people
Extremely dangerous
Now what about this roasting dish
What are we going to cook it in
Withnail: You're the food and plummings man
've no idea
wish 'd found this an hour ago
'd have taken great pleasure in gunning this pullet down
[He pokes the chicken with the gun
It still has a few feathers
] Withnail: Shouldn't it be more bald than that
: No it shouldn't
Right, we're going to have to reverse the roles
We can bake the potatoes in the oven and boil this bastard over the fire
[He tries to push the chicken into a kettle but it is too large to fit
] Withnail: Lets get its feet off : No, it's going to need it's feet
[He removes the chicken and takes it to the fire
Opening the oven, he removes Withnail's steaming boots and points the the brick in the oven
] : Straddle them either side of that
[He sits the chicken on the brick
] --------------------------------------------------------------------------- phonebox [ is smoking stood outside the phonebox waiting for Withnail
] Withnail: 've already put two shilling pieces in
No  havn't got another
It's not my fault if the system doesn't work
[He emerges from the phonebox
] Withnail: Bitch hung up on me
[ fishes around in his pocket and finds a shilling for Withnail who goes back into the phonebox and dials
] Withnail: Hello
How are you
Very well
What
Why wouldn't they see me
This is ridiculous
haven't been up in a job for three months
Understudy Constantine
'm not going to understudy Constantine, why can't  play the part
This is ridiculous
No, 'm not in London, Penryth
Penryth
Well, what about
Listen,  pay you ten percent to do that
Well lick ten percent of the arses for me
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
How dare you
Fuck you
[He takes out his frustration on the phone, hitting it for a while then leaves the phonebox
] Withnail: Bastard asked me to understudy Constantine in The Seagull
'm not going to understudy anyone, especially that little pimp
Anyway,  loath those Russian plays
Always full of women starring out of windows whinning about ducks going to Moscow
[Returning from Penryth they walk accross a field
is carrying some shopping
] Withnail: What do you think to Desmond Wolf
: With respect to what
Withnail: 'm thinking of changing my name
: Too like Donald Woolfe [He hands the bag to Withnail and opens a gate
It is clearly marked 'Shut this gate'] : Here, changeover point
[Withnail slams the gate behind them but it doesn't fasten
They see Parkin on his tractor
] Withnail: Do you think he's happier than us
: No Withnail: suppose happiness is relative
never thought it would be a polythene bag without the hole in it
[Parkin turns the tractor towards them, stops and runs towards them
] : What's up with him
Parkin: Shut that gate, shut that bull
: You didn't shut the gate
Parkin: Shut that gate, shut that bull
[ bull appears and pushes the gate open
Withnail thrusts the bag into 's hands and vaults the wall
is left facing the bull in a narrow corridor between two walls
] Withnail: Grab its ring
Keep your bag up
Outvive him
Parkin: Hey, listen, show no fear
Just run at it : Well that can't be sensible can it
The bastard's about to run at me Parkin: Well he's randy
: Yeah, yeah
know he is [Withnail has his cigarettes out and is lighting up
] Withnail: Wants to get down there and have sex with those cows
: Shut up Withnail
Parkin: Just run at it, shouting
Withnail: Do as he says, start shouting
It won't gore you : coward you are Withnail
An expert on bulls you are not
[He shouts and throws the shopping in the air
The bull roars,  shouts again and runs at it
It turns and retreats to its field
] Parkin: Shut that gate and keep it shut
Withnail: think an evening at the Crow
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The fields [It is dark
The silloutes of Withnail and  appear on the skyline
] [narrating]: If the Crow and Crown had ever had life it was dead now
It was like walking into a lung
self-sustained nicotin-yellow and fly-blown lung
Its landlord was a retired alcoholic with military pretentions and a complection like the inside of a teapot
By the time the doors opened he was arseholed on rum and got progresively more arseholed until he could take no more and fell over at about twelve 'o' clock
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Crow and Crown [Withnail and  are stood at the bar
] Withnail: We'll have another pair of large scotches
[Raymond, the publican, gets the drink and takes the money for them
In opening the till he just avoids falling over
Withnail and  suppress laughter
] Raymond: Thought  was going for a minute but no man's put me down yet
Have you had any training in the martial arts
Withnail: Yes, as a matter of  have
Before  became a journalist  was in the terretorials
Raymond: Do you know, when you first came in here  knew you were a services man
You can never, never disguise it
Withnail: What were you in
Raymond: Tanks
Afrika Korps
little before your time
Don't suppose you've engaged
Withnail: Ireland
Raymond: Ooooh, a crack at the Mick
Withnail: We'll have another pair of large scotches Raymond: These shall be my pleasure
What are you doing up here then
Withnail: We're doing a feature for Country Life
Survey of rural types: farmers, traveling tinkers, milkmen; that sort of thing
Raymond: Have you met Jake
Poacher
Works the lake but keep it under your hat, hmm
[They take their drinks to a table
] : What's all this army bollocks
Withnail: We got a drink didn't we
[Rather later, the pair are the only remaining customers
Raymond, wiping down the bar, is clearly leggless
] Raymond: Time please gentlemen
: think he means it [The door clatters open and a man in a thick coat walks in, leans over the bar and helps himself to a beer
nudges Withnail
The man takes an eel from his trousers which wriggles around violently
He strikes its head on the bar and returns it to his trousers
] : Ask him if we can have one Withnail: What for
: So that we can eat it
'We're fed up with stew' [They approach the bar
] Withnail: Excuse me, could we have an eel
You've got eels down your leg Jake: You leave them alone
Nothing down there of interest to you
[He removes a pheasant from under his coat
] Help us out Raymond
He's been stuffed from arsehole to t' beak
: Ask him if we can have one of those
Go on
Withnail: Excuse me, we were wondering if we could purchase a pheasant off of you Jake: No
Withnail: Come on old boy
What's in your hump
Jake: Those pheasants are for his pot
There eels are for my pot
Now what makes you think  should give you something for your pot
Withnail: What pot
: Our cooking pot
Jake: Ah, he know
Here, give us a wheeze on that fag
[He takes the cigarette from Withnail's mouth and takes a draw
gives him the remains of a packet
] Jake: Might come up and see you lads in the week
Might bring you up a rabbit
Withnail: We don't want a rabbit, we want a pheasant
Jake: Now listen here you young prat
Haven't got no pheasants
Haven't got no birds
No more than you have
Withnail: Of course you have, you're the poacher
Jake: If  hear more words out of you 'll come up and set one of these black puddin's on you Withnail: Don't threaten me with a dead fish Jake: Half dead he might be, but 'll come up after you and wake you up with a live one
Withnail: Sod your pheasants
You'll have to find us first
[They make to leave] Jake: know where you are
You're at crow crag
've been wathching you
Especially you, prancing like a tit
You want working on boy ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Withnail: if i see that sillage heap prowling around here i'll take the bastard axe to him
bastards
you'll all suffer
i'm going to be a star
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Withnail: Vegtables again
'll be sprouting feelers soon : There's black pudding in it
Withnail: Black puddings are no good to us
want somethings flesh
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Withnail: think 'll call myself Donald Twain
Get down, get down
It's him, what does he want
: Better get down there and ask him
Withnail: Don't be ridiculous, he's got a gun
Bastard's phycotic, you've only got to look at him
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Withnail: this place has become impossible
Nothing to eat, freezing cold and now a madman on the prowl outside with eels
: alright you've made your point
we pack up tomorrow and get out
Withnail: where are you going
: 'm going for a slash Withnail: you can't go outside, i can't get my boots on when they're hot
: then i'll go alone Withnail: no you won't these are the sort of windows faces look in at
: alright then i won't have a slash Withnail: and in both our interests i think we should sleep together tonight
: don't be ridiculous he;s not going to come up here in the dark
Withnail: yes he is and if he catches one of us off guard he's got a much better chance of dealing with the other
: no ---------------------------------------------------------------------- : ha ha ha ha ha Withnail: what are you laughing about : i was dreaming Withnail: you frightened the piss out of me
move over : will you get out Withnail: no : alright, i'll have to sleep in your bed Withnail: then i'll have to come with you : alright you can stay but the gun goes Withnail: no, i have to keep the gun
i intend to stay awake until morning
: it's my bed and i demand presidence
mad fucking bastard ---------------------------------------------------------------------- : ah ah

Withnail: i heard a noise
: there is nothing get to bed
what was that
Withnail: listen listen : probably just foxes
perhaps its the farmer Withnail: at two in the morning
it's the killer
he's come to kill us
it's all your fault, you've even given him the fucking gun
've got to get in
He's trying to get in
: He can't, he'll go away
He's going away
Withnail: He's getting in thorough the window
He's sharpening the fucking knife : where's the matches
Withnail: in the kitchen
: alright
we'll have to tackle with him
you stay in bed and pretend to be asleep
when he goes for you i'll jump on his back
Withnail: no no, it'll be too late by then, i'll be knifed
we'll have to try and make friends with him
He's going to your room
it's you he wants
offer him yourself
we mean no harm
Monty: oh my boys, my boys
: monty
monty monty
Withnail: monty you terrible cunt
what are you doing prowling round in the middle of the fucking night
Monty: i had a punctured tyre
i had to wait an eon for assistance
i'm sorry if i frightened you
i'll sleep in the other room if i may : anywhere you like Monty ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Monty: ah, good morning
did you sleep well
: mmmm
you've been busy in here Monty: as a bee
do appologise for last night, it was perfectly inconsidereate of me
: that's perfectly alright monty
how did you repair the window
Monty: didn't break it
merely forced it a little
there was an empty wine bottle on the ledge
tomatoes
you better wake him, breakfast in fifteen minutes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Monty: The older order changeth giving way to the new and God forfills himself in many ways and soon,  suppose,  shall be swept away by some vulgar little tumor
My boys, we are at the end of an age
We live in a land of weather forcasts and breakfasts that set in
Shat on by Tories, shovelled up by labour
Now which of you is going to be a splendid fellow and go down to the Rolls for the rest of the wine
: 'll go
Withnail: 'll go
: No, 'll go -  need to see about digging the car out
Monty: But we have my car dear boy
: Yes, but if it rains we're buggered
mean
Monty: Stranded
Withnail: Leave this to me : 'll come with you,  could do with a walk
Besides
shall need you to work on the joint
hear you're a little wizard in the kitchen
Withnail: Yeah, you the food and plumbings expert
[He starts putting his polythene bags on
] Monty: What on earth are those
Withnail: We forgot to bring our wellingtons
Monty: You mean you've been up here in all this beastly mud and oomska without wellingtons
This afternoon 'll take you both into Penryth and get you fitted with some good quality rubber boots
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The kitchen
[Monty has an apron on and is holding another
] Monty: brought two of these in case either of you were any good in the kitchen
: 'm not
Monty: Oh, of course you are
Cooking's one of the natural talents
Garlic, rosemary and salt
[He hands  a large joint of meat in a paper wrapper
puts it down on the side
] : Look this is all very kind of you Monty but  really ought to be out there getting some work done on the car
Monty: You haven't time we're taking late luncheon at three
: We'll have to leave by three Monty
Didn't he tell you
We've got to get back to sign on
Monty: Sign on
At a labour exchange
: Yes, it's rather fashionable actually
All the actors do it
Even Redgrave
Monty: Couldn't you forgo for just this one occasion
've come a very long way to see you both
: Sorry can't
mean, 'd love to stay but he's more adament to get back than  am
[Monty slips the apron over 's head and ties it behind him
] Monty: Then we must choose our moment and have a word with him
'm sure together we could persuade him
Now, garlic, rosemary and salt can never touch meat until it's cooked
As a youth  used to weep in butchers shops
[ moves through to the lounge and looks in the bags of food on the table
] : can't find the rosemary
Monty: Can't find the rosemary
'm sure we could find it together
[He leans accross  in a rather comprimising fashion
] : perhaps it's in the other bag
Monty: Perhaps it is
Shall we look
[He reaches accross with his other arm cutting of any opatunity of escape
Withnail enters with the wine and puts the bags on the table
] Withnail: Sorry
Sherry's in there
[Monty exits to the kitchen armed with the sherry
] : What do you mean sorry
What's he doing here
We can't stay he won't leave me alone
Withnail: Alright, we'll get the dinner down then we'll leave
[In the kitchen Monty pulls the cork from the sherry and emerges with three different glasses
] Monty: 'm afraid we must drink from these
hope their shapes will not offend your palates
Withnail: Chin chin
Monty: To a delightful weekend in the country
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Penryth [Monty's car drives into Penryth and pulls up in the town centre
Withnail and  get out of the car
Compared to Monty and the car they look rather scruffy
] Monty: do think you could at least have shaved
What will people think, you look like a pair of farm-hands
Get away from the car
[He takes out his wallet and hands Withnail two fivers
] Monty: Now, you get the wellingtons
'm going to but some razors and shaving soap
'll meet you here in half an hour
[Monty drives off] Withnail: Couple of blooms
: One each
[He removes a fiver from Withnail's hand] Withnail: think a drink don't you
: What about the wellingtons
Withnail: Oh, bollocks to the wellingtons
We'll tell him there was a farmer's conference and they had a run on them
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Inside the pub [ is on the telephone while Withnail is at the bar
] : yeah, ok then
yeah
promise
[He puts down the phone and walks over to withail] : Hasn't heard a thing
They're still seeing people
Withnail: You don't want to go to Manchester anyway; play a bloody soilder
: don't know if  do
Bloody good little theatre that
Withnail: It's not much of a part is it
They'd make you cut you hair off
: So what, you'd loose a leg
: time please gents
Withnail: Alright we're going to have to work quickly
pair of quadruple whiskies and another pair of pints please
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [Withnail and  emerge unsteadily from the pub
] Withnail: Where is he
Utterly aresholed
: We're early
[ looks accross to some tearooms] : We want to get in there don't we
Eat some cake
Soak up the booze
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [They enter the Penryth tea-rooms
sits down at a table and starts buttering the bread rolls on the table
Withnail, still standing, points to the table and addresses an elderly waitress, Miss Blennerhassit
] Withnail: Alright here
Miss : No, we're closing in a minute
Withnail: We're leaving in a minute
Alright here
Miss : What do you want
[He sits down at the table and makes a rather perfunctory examination of the menu
] Withnail: We'll have tea and cake
[An elderly man comes across to their table
He is the proprietor] : Did you hear her
She said she'd closed
What do you want in here
Withnail: Cake and tea
what's it got to do with you
:  happen to be the proprietor
Now, will you leave
Withnail: Ah good, 'm glad you're the proprietor
was going to have to have a word with you anyway
We're doing a film up here, location see
We might want to do a film in here
: You're drunk
: Just bring out the cake
Withnail: Cake and fine wine
Miss : If you don't leave we'll call the police
Withnail: Balls
We want the finest wines availible to humanity
We want them here and we want them now
: The police, Miss Blennerhassit
[  breaks off from stuffing breadrolls but hasn't quite emptied his mouth at the start] : Don't do that Miss Blenerhassit
'm warning you Miss Blennerhassit, if you do - you're fired
We are multi-millionaries
we'll buy this place and fire you immediately
Withnail: Yeah, that's right, we'll buy this place and install a fucking duke-box and liven all you stiffs up a bit
: The police Miss Blenerhassit
Just tell them there are a couple of drunks in the Penryth tea rooms and we'd like them removed
: We are not drunks, we are multi-millionaires
: Come on Mabs, we'll keep them here until they arrive [She starts to dial] Withnail: You won't keep us anywhere
Miss : Police please Withnail: We'll buy this place and have it knocked down
: It's alright, 's alright
Our car has arrived
[He pulls back a curtain to reveal that indeed their car has arrived, in the form on Monty in the Rolls
They get up and  staggers out the door] Withnail: We're coming back in here
[He tries to lean on a convenient post but misses and staggers a bit
He points meaningfully at the various customers as he leaves, shutting his coat in the door
] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The cottage [Withnail and  are sat inside
There is no sign of Monte
has just finished shaving and is rubbing his face with a towel
] : Where is he
Withnail: Sulking up the hill
He says he won't come down for lunch without an appology
: Suits me, he can eat his fucking radish
[Unseen, Monte enters and addresses ] Monty: It's all you fault
: beg your pardon Monte
Monty: You lead him astray
Oh don't pretend you don't understand, know what you're up to
[Withnail stands up and offers Monte a glass] Withnail: Sherry
Monty: Sherry
Oh no, no, no, no
'll fall straight into his trap
He's so mauve we don't know what he'll do next
[ walks out in distgust as Monte sips the sherry
] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- the kitchen [ is at the sink peeling potatoes
Monte enters] Monty: 'm preparing myself to forgive you
think you've been punished enough
think we better release you from the legume and transfer you talents to the meat
[he takes him by the hand into the lounge] Monty: You shouldn't treat each other so badly
He's been working his fingers to the bone and all you do is sit in here drinking
Now, he's going to revitalize himself in here while you finish the vegtables
Withnail: don't know how to do them
Monty: Well of course you don't
You're incapable of indulging in anything but pleasure am  not right
[ merely smiles] Monty: You don't deserve such loyalty
Now come along, 'm going to teach you how to peel a potato
[He rolls up Withnail's sleeves and takes him unwillingly into the kitchen
Withnail swipes a glass of sherry off the table on the way there
] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- the dinner table [All three are sat around the table eating a good looking roast dinner
There is plenty of extra meat and a good supply of wine
] Monty: It's very stimulating getting back to a basic sort of lifestyle
Without effecened emotion and poisonous inhibition
: Except the problem do tend to take the edge off it
Monty: What do you mean
: There are no proper facilities Monty: All the glorious trials of youth dear boy
When  was a lad 'd rocket off on my tandem with Wrigglesworth and ride and ride
Find some old barn and fall asleep with the sweet perfume of hay on our lips
Withnail: Would it be in poor form to plagarise a toast
Monty: It depend entirely on the quality of the wine
In this case, it most certainly would not
Withnail: In that case, to a delightful weekend in the country
Monty: Oooh, we were expecting a volley of argument concerning Mr Redgrave
[ gives Withnail a look of daggers] : You're forgetting Jake
Monty: Jake can wait too
: Jake's not a friend Monte
'd hoped to avoid telling you this, but there's a madman on the loose outside
Monty: Is this true
Withnail: Well, there's this local type
Poacher
We got into a bit of a tiff and he threatened me with a dead fish
Yes, it was rather amusing acutally
When you came into the house we thought it was him and we thought that you cleaning your boots was him sharpening the knife
Monty: Oh, how delicious
: 'm going for a walk
Monty: Oh, wait for us dear boy, we'll all go
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Outside the cottage [ is leaning on the wall
Withnail emerges and walks briskly over to him] Withnail: Look,  know what your thinking but  had no alternative
The old beggers come a long way and  didn't want to put the wind up him
: You sensitivity overwhelms me
If you think you're having a weekends indulgence up here at his expense, which means him having a weekends induldgence up here at my expense you've got another thing coming
Withnail: Anyway, he sent me out to say the coffee's ready
: couldn't drink it
've got a crick in my mouth from grinning
Withnail: Well stop smilling at him
: can't help it, 'm so uptight with him
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The hillside
[The are walking through thick bracken listening to Monte expound on Oxford
] Monty: Longtemps, longtemps de teau cheveux
Oh, Bodelair
Brings back such memories of Oxford
[voice over] followed by yet another anecdote about his sensitive crimes in a punt with a chap called Norman who had ref hair and a poetry book stained with the butter drips from crumpets
Monty: Indeed  often wonder where Norman is now
Probably wintering with his mother in Guilford, a cat, rain, vim under the sink and both bars on
But old now, there is no true beauty without decay
Withnail: Legium pro Britania Monty: How right you are, how right you are
We live in a kingdom of (rains/reigns) where royalty comes in gangs
Come on lads, the sky's bruising, night must fall and we shall be forced to camp
: He's having my room
want the room with the lock
Agree to that or 'm off
Withnail: Alright, alright [They stride off back to the cottage
Before they get there, they see Jake at the door
Monte looks at him through the binoculars] : Good old Jake eh
And that's precisely the reason 'm off back to London
Come on, lets pack up and get off
Good old Jake, eh Withnail
Lets all have a laugh
Good old Jake
Monty: He's going away
[They walk down to the cottage
There is a hare tied to the door with a note attached
Withnail unfolds the note and hands it to Monte
Monty clearly has some difficulty in reading the note
] Monty: Here hare here
[The meaning dawns on him
] Monty: Here hare here
Withnail: Good old Jake
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The cottage
[They are playing poker with bottle tops and a few coins
An old gramaphone is plaing in the background
The game is stud with two down cards - Monty has the ace of spades and two small spades showing,  just queen high] Monty: Ace bets two and it's over to you
Withnail: You two and up two
: So that's four
Monty: That's four
[ puts in four
Monty deals the last set of cards
] Monty: Withnail: Denai surenum defit
[He deals  another queen to ] Monty: Oh, there she is
[He deals himself another spade] Monty: possible flush
Well, it's the two queens to bet
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [Still at the table, Monty winds up the gramaphone
] Monty: Another hand
[Withnail looks up and slumps in his chair
He is totally plastered
] Monty: think we'd better get him to bed
: No, he's down here
You're in my room, 'm in his room and he's down here
Monty: wouldn't dream of depriving the poor fellow of his bed
Particularlly in that condition
: It's what he wants
Withnail: No  don't  want to get to bed
: Come on then luvy, lets get you to bed then
good nights sleep will do us both some good
[He grabs Withnail under the arms and manouvers him out of the room
] : We'll 'll say good night then Monty
Withnail: want to be alone
[ staggers up the stairs with Withnail who mumers about wanting to be on his own
He drops him on the bed and dashes back to his own room to get his bedding
Before he can get back though Monty has come up the stairs and just finished locking the door
] Monty: He doesn't want to sleep with you
: Right then, You're in there and 'll take the couch
'll say night night then Monty
Monty: You already have
Twice
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [Downstairs  frantically aranges the blankets on the settee
Monty enters] : What is it Monty, 'm terribly tired  need to get to bed
Monty: But not that tired eh
Are you a sponge or a stone
: beg you pardon Monty
Monty: Do you like to sample all facets of life or do you shut yourself off from new experience
: voted conserative Monty: Loyalty isn't a matter of selection
: quite agree, it's more a matter of chosing to whom one is loyal
'm terribly tired Monty,  need to get to bed
Monty: You must mustn't you
Off you go then
'll sleep down here
It won't be the first time 've been left with the couch
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [ is in bed
He has barricaded the door by propping a chair against the knob
There is a determined pushing at the door from the other side which dislodges the chair and Monty enters
] Monty: Boy
Boy
know you're not asleep boy
But he is
've been into his room
He won't hear a thing
: No 'm not asleep
What is it Monty, what do you want
[ lights a candle
Monty sits down on the side on the bed
] Monty: tried not to come, oh how  tried not to
: There's something 've got to tell you Monty
Monty: There's no need to explain, he's told me everything
: What
What's he told you
Monty: About how you came to Chelsea and you arrest in the totenham court road
He told me about your probelms, how you feel
: Probelms, what problems
Monty: You are a toilet trader
Go with it boy, give into to it
It's like a tide
Don't let it ruin your youth as  nearly did over Eric
: 'm not homosexual Monty Monty: Yes you are
Of course you are
You're only saying that to deny your relationship with him
It's not his fault that he can't love you any more that it's mine that  adore you
Can't we allow ourselves this one moment of indiscretion
He need never know
: don't care what he knows, you must leave Monty
[ gets out of bed and goes over to the door
Monty beats him to it
] Monty: mean to have you even if it must be burgulary
[ races to the other side of the room
Monty advances
] : Monty you must listen
We're in an affair, we have been for years
But he's estranged, he won't allow himself to admit it
That's why he's rejecting me while you're here
On my life Monty, this is the first time in six years we havn't slept together couldn't cheat on him, it would kill him
Monty: Oh my dear boy, if 'd realised that 'd never have attempted to come between you
: know that Monty,  respected you for your sensitivity,  thank you for it
Monty: You better go to him : Oh,  intend to
This instant
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Withnail's room [Withnail is asleep in bed with the shotgun enters] : Withnail you bastard wake up
Wake up you bastard before  burn this bastard bed down
Withnail: deny all accusations
What do you want
: 've just narrowly avoided having a buggery
And 've come in here with the express intention of wishing one on you
That said, 'm leaving for London
Withnail: Hold on, hold on
Don't let you imagination run away with you
[He light up and coughs up some phlem] : 've just finished fighting a naked man
How dare you tell him 'm a toilet trader
Withnail: Tatical necessity
If  hadn't told him you were active we'd never have got the cottage
: wouldn't have wanted it, not with him in it
Withnail: never thought he'd come all this way
: Monty
He'd go to New York
Withnail: Calcualted risk
: What is all this calculated risk and tactical necessity
It's me, naked, in a corner
And how dare you tell him  love you
And how dare you tell him you rejected me
How dare you tell him that
Withnail: Sorry about that, got a bit carried away
Sort of said it without thinking
[ takes the gun] : Well let me tell you something Withnail, if he comes in my room again its murder and you'll be held resposible in law
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The cottage [Withnail is eating lunch at the table
is reading a note] : 'Perhaps it is just that the evesdropper should leave as his trade dictates, in secrecy and in the dead of night
do sincerely hope that you will find the happiness that has saddly always been denied me
Yours faithfully, Montegue  Withnail
' Poor old bastard
Withnail: Now  must say, that represents a level of hippocrasy in you that 'd previously suspected but not noticed due to highly evasive skills
: You'll suffer for this Withnail
What you have done will have to be paid for
Withnail: 'll say one thing for Monte; he keeps a sensational cellar
[There is a knock at the door
] : Who is it
: Telegram
[ gets the telegram and opens it
He shows it to Withnail] Withnail: Well done
: Well it doesn't mean to say 've got the part
They probably just want to see me again
Well, that settles it, we leave immediately
Withnail: What
: Get you stuff together, we leave in half an hour
Withnail: Don't be ridiculous,  need at least an hour for lunch
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The car [Withnail is eating the lunch from a plate on his knee
It is raining heavinly and 's side of the windscreen is impossible to see through] Withnail: You got a truck coming up in this lane followed by a slow right-hander
: This is insanity Withnail: Stay in this lane : What lane,  can't see any lane
Withnail: Bear right, bear right
: can't keep this up
And  must get some sleep
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The car [It is daytime again, and the rain has stopped
is asleep in the back on the car
The car jerks around and he woken
As he looks out the window, the camera moves with his view
The car is hurtling down the motorway swerving between the other cars
] : What's going on
Withnail: 'm making time
: Pull over, you haven't got a license
Withnail: No, 'm making time
Here comes another fucker
[They swerve infront of several more cars
Then  sees a police van behind them
] : On no
Withnail: It's perfectly alright, leave him to me
: You're full of scotch you silly tool
[The police van comes along side them and a policeman leans out pointing markedly to the roadside
Withnail pulls over, the van draws up in front on them and the officers approach the car
One knocks on the window and Withnail winds it down
] P1: Bit early in the morning for festivities isn't it sir
[There is a large pile of bottles on the passenger seat of the car] Withnail: They're not mine, they belong to him
P1: You're drunk
Withnail: assure you 'm not officer, 've only had a few ales
P1: Out of the car
Please
Sir
[Withnail makes no move so he opens the door
Withnail virtually falls out then stands against the car
The policeman offers him a breathaliser] P1: Would you fill this bag please sir
[Withnail shakes his head] P1: Are you refusing to fill this bag
Withnail: most certainly am P1: 'm placing you under arrest
Withnail: Don't be ridiculous  haven't done anything
Listen, my cousin's a
P2: Get in the back on the van
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Police station [Withnail is behind a screen
sergant is sat at a desk while other policemen wonder around] P3: Serg, what's that clown up to
[The sergent pulls a gap in the screen and sees withnail with the contraption Danny gave him
He grabs the tube and urine splashes everywhere
Withnail grins sheepishly] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The flat [Withnail and  enter their flat
They look through the post] Withnail: Where's our checks
: We didn't sign on
Withnail: That wouldn't make any difference to last weeks payments
[They hear music from upstairs
The door to the bathroom is ajar and in the bath is a large black man who looks at them inquiringly looks in his bedroom
The bed is occupied by Danny] : What are you doing in my bed
: Having a sleep
: Who's the huge spade in the bath
: Presuming Ed
: Well  want you out
You've got ten minutes alright
Coz  want to get in
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The lounge [All four are sat in the lounge] Withnail: How did you get in
: Inginuity man - come up the drainpipe
Would you like a smoke
Withnail: Yes : No thanks, 've got a call to make
[Danny starts pulling out rizzlers at a prolific rate] Withnail: What are you going to do with those
: The joint  am about to roll requires a craftsman and can utalise up to twelve spliffs
It is called a Camberwell carrot
: It's imposible to use 12 papers on one joint
: It is impossible to roll a camberwell carrot with anything less
Withnail: Who says it's a Camberwell carrot
:  do
invented it in Camberwell and it's shaped like a carrot
[Cut to Danny on the settee
The Camberwell carrot is complete and is indeed of prodidiuos proportions
As Danny lights it we see only the end but as he hands it to withnail we see the true size
It is enormous
] : These will tend to make you very high
[Withnail takes a long draw] : This grass is the most powerfull in the western hemisphere
It grows at exactly two thousand feet above sea-level
have it special flown in from my man in Mexico
His name's Huang
He's an expert
[ returns from his phone call] : Did you get the part man
[ takes a draw on the joint and splutters
He shakes his head] : No,  got a different one
They want me to play the lead
Withnail: Congratulations
: Where exactly have you two been
: trip to the countryside
: That is a very good idea
London is a city coming down from its trip and there's going to be a lot of refugees
[Presuming Ed laughs deeply] : Did you realise this gafs overrun with rodents
When  came in  saw one in the oven the size of a fucking dog
: That is a dog, belongs to the man downstairs
: Does his dog get in the oven
Withnail: No his dog doesn't come up here
: Then it was a rodent
Quite freeked me at the time
was going to cook onions
There was some bald gieser round here the other day reckoned you owed him 235 quid backrent
told him there was no question of paying rent on a property infested with rodent
Started coming on all bald with me
Withnail: You mean ratty
:  told him to piss off
: You bloody fool
He'll have us up in court again
: No he won't, it's not legal
Withnail: We can quote you on that  presume
: Law rather appeals to me actually
[Withnail laughs uncontrolably and drops to the floor] : Just high
: Stop laughing will you Withnail, this is serious
: No it ain't
looked into it
Studied the papers
: What papers
: Legal papers
[He shakes the papers out of a bag] : Look, he's got our checks
What are you doing with these
: was going to pay them in for you
: For christ'd sake Withnail, stop laughing will you
Look, this is a notice of eviction Withnail: Give it to my barrister
[Presuming Ed starts chanting and rotating a globe] Ed: Harriramma, Hariramma : Shup up will you, you're giving me the fear
Give us a downer Danny, 've gone and fucked my brain
: Sit down man, take control
You have a rush
It will pass
: Aren't you getting absurdly high
: Precisely the reason 'm smoking it
Withnail: couldn't 'm spaced
: Not as spaced as you rodents
: Don't talk about them
:  expect they're talking to each other
: Talking to each other
What do you mean
: 've dealt with them
Given 'em all drugged onion
: Why've you drugged their onions
: Sit down man, find your neutral space
You have done something to your brain
You have made it high
If  lay 10 mills of diazipan on you, you will do something else to your brain, you will make it low
Why trust one drug rather than the other
That politics ain't it
: 'm going to eat some sugar
:  recommend you smoke some more grass
: No way, no fucking way
: That is an unfortunate political decission
Withnail: What are you talking about Danny
: If you are holding onto a rising balloon you are presented with a difficult political decission - let go while you've still got the chance or hold onto the rope and continue getting higher
That's politics man
We are at the end of an age
The greatest decade in the history of mankind is nearly over
They're selling hippy wigs in wolworths
It is 91 days to the end of the decade and as presuming ed here has so consistently pointed out, we have failed to paint it black
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- : Right, 'm off now
Withnail: Already
: My father will pick up my stuff in the week and do something about the car
Withnail: But 've got us a bottle open
Confiscated it from Monte's supplies
53 Margaux
Best of the century : can't Withnail, 'll miss the train
Withnail: There's always time for a drink
: haven't the time
Withnail: Alright, 'll walk with you to the station
We can drink it through the park
[He grabs his coat and an umbrella and takes the bottle
] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Park [It is pouring down with rain
Withnail offer the bottle to ] : No thankyou, no more
Look, it's a stinker Withnail, why don't you go home
Withnail: Because  want to walk you to the station
: No, really,  really don't want you to
[They stop by the wolves
] : shall miss you Withnail
Withnail: 'll miss you too
[ departs
Withnail walks to the fence and leans against it
] Withnail: have of late, but wherefore  know not, lost all my mirth and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promotory; this most excellent canopy the air, look you, this mighty o'rehanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire; why, it appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours
What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, how like an angel in aprehension, how like a God
The beauty of the world, paragon of animals; and yet to me, what is this quintessence of dusk
Man delights not me, no, nor women neither, nor women neither
[The wolves are unimpressed
Withnail exits into the rain
