By Richard Curtis And Robin Driscoll - very grand room, with lots of wood and some very famous portraits round the walls
group of grave gentlemen and gentlewomen
They are the trustees of the National Gallery
, a very grand man, sits at the table head
To his right sits his assistant,
All are deep in thought fidgets with a pencil on the table
He raises his head as though about to speak
Everyone looks up expectantly
And
goes back to fidgeting
So does everyone else
: &
: - The scene is as silent and static as we left it Last
then: suppose we could just sack him
: ' Mr  comes out of his house, ready to face the world- He walks up the street, tutting slightly at     a ' ' sign he passes
The street is totally car-free except for a     very visible lime green mini policeman strolls by and glances down at a     pair of legs sticking out from under it, next to a toolbox
He moves on,      satisfied that someone is mending their car
approaches the car     and whips out the fake legs he left there
He then unlocks the big padlock     that secures the car door, pops the fake legs inside, fiddles with something     else in the back seat, and drives away at a frightening speed with a smug look     on his face
The Theme Music - big and dramatic - begins, as do the rest of the credits
gaily motors on - then unexpectedly the sweeping theme tune jumps, as if it has hit a scratch: the cinema audience should be worried there's a sound fault
comes to a street full of sleeping policemen ~ he goes at them at quite a lick - and every time he shoots over one of the bumps, the theme tune jumps violently
looks a little annoyed into the back seat - we now see the cause of the problem
Instead of having a car radio,  has an old record player strapped into the back seat, playing the theme tune
On he drives, through empty streets - then  - he's reached the glorious familiarity of Central London, Big Ben and all - but heels now in dreadful traffic
Heels not happy
He looks to the left and sees a very thin alleyway
He takes out a metal comb from his pocket and, using it like a bomber's sight- line-checker, measures the front of his car and the width of the alley
He ' satisfied - does a 90-degree turn - and shoots down the alley
It is such a perfect fit that sparks fly from the door handles as they graze the walls
But at the end of      the alley, the traffic's just as bad
notices he's outside Harrods
There's a tail-coated Security Guard at    the    'front door
watches him      stroll a bit down the street - and takes    his    chance
He turns and drives      straight through the double doors, into    the    store
and his car whizz through the ground floor, past perfume counters and leather glove racks
a Security Guard
As       he passes one of the counters, 's little car just shoots behind him
The       Guard continues through the Children's section there are giant elephants and      teddies, children's size cars, then two huge plastic tractors - and then,      stock still, strangely in harmony actually, the Lime Green Mini with  in      it
The Guard walks straight past
The moment he is gone,  shoots off again - but, damn
, spies another Guard and is forced to turn and drive down some very steep stairs indeed
The theme song goes  as the record player jumps
: 6 people waiting at a gilded lift
They hear a strange sound, and turn to see what it is
In fact, it's coming from inside the lift
When the lift doors open, out shoots the Mini through the double doors and back into the street
Out in the street,  is faced by an accident
There are flashing lights, a crumpled car, suggestions of hurt passengers
looks concerned
: An Ambulance roars through the traffic
It reaches its hospital, turns off, and there, right smack behind it is the Mini
Cut in to see , smiling broadly
He whizzes into Trafalgar Square, maybe even across it, sending pigeons and tourists flying, and parks directly outside the statuesque National Gallery
Of course, there's not another car there
Just the Gallery and the mini
: - gets out of the car, takes out his bag - thinks a little, opens it and takes    out a "Doctor on Call' sign
To re-enforce it, he puts a bone in the back    window and a skull of the front seat
Happy with the arrangement, he re- locks    the padlock and sets off smiling up the big, stairs to work
As he does so, pan up the building, and into the window of the room where that Board meeting was taking place
: - Look,  don't hate the man but
know, Gareth
It's the mental strain he inflicts on us all
How is Professor Bradbury grand gentleman,  , pipes up
'm Heels got the feeling back in his fingers - but his hands are still stapled together
Mmmm, and how far are we with the computer, Hubert
Timothy is loading the final catalogue data as we speak, Milord
An awful thing to say, but when the program's up and running our, Mr
Bean will become a little less than
useful
glimmer of hope
- wanders past three or four portraits and mimics the characters in them
He passes a guard
(not looking up from his book) Morning, Bean
The  sighs with boredom
He gets this from  every day
As Bean moves on, he treads on the heel of a tourist's shoe
It comes off-  moves on blithely
: - is passing the very special room where Leonardo Da Vinci's cartoon, 'The Virgin and Child', hangs, preserved by a very dim artificial light
There are silhouettes of a few tourists in the room reverently studying the work, listening to a female
dips into his pocket for his identity badge and in so doing brings out a coin
The coin drops and rolls into the special room
follows it into the darkness
(hushed) by Leonardo Da Vinci
As you can see, the special light in here goes some way to protect the drawing from photodisintegration caused by gamma
The camera stays outside the room with the picture in view
We hear the squeak of a tiny door open, then a click
The room is suddenly flooded in blazing white light
The onlookers gasp in horror
re-emerges from the room with his precious coin
As an afterthought he pops his hand round the doorway and turns off the light
He scuttles away
The   shakes her head in total exasperation
: - Maybe it would be simpler to pack all our paintings onto trucks and move the entire National Gallery somewhere else
And not tell him
Seconded
We could all move to France
All those in favour
They all raise their hands wildly
Come on - settle down everyone
: - stands in the elevator silently with four other       people
He gives himself a long squirt of breathfreshener
Then offers it to        the others, who politely refuse him
So he stands still again
Pause
then smells something unpleasant
He leans and has a little sniff of the        person to his left
All right there
Then he sniffs to his right, and reels        at what he smells
He again takes out the breath freshener, and forces it       upon , an elderly gentleman, who is mortified
At this moment the elevator stops -  and  get out and the camera follows  as he heads for the boardroom door and enters
He is another trustee
This dialogue is heard from behind the closed door
'm sorry 'm late
Why can't we just give him the boot for crying out loud
Steady on, old man
only
Not you, you idiot
: - , with cup of tea, walks along a corridor
He can't not interfere for tidiness sake
One empty room he switches off the light
Another he shuts the door
He passes a computer room, with an open door where a big man is busily typing in a programme -  looks at him snootily and heads on
He approaches the door to his office
sign reads: ' & '
There is a huge padlock on the door
takes out a big key and enters his domain
: -
enters
He's been here for years and made it his own
It's an odd little world
There's a framed picture of Shirley Bassey on his desk and Airfix planes hang from the ceiling
Also a large cosy armchair and a
pleasant Man in a suit, around 40, breezes in
Ah Bean, 'm looking for a painting by Van Hocht
Still Life
Circa 1670
Can do
nods
This is what  likes to do best
The camera follows as he turns sees the extraordinary sight behind him
His office is just a tiny    corner of a massive storage room, hundreds of feet high and long, the walls    completely full of rack after rack of stored paintings
At the end of     the room, we can see hundreds of sculptures: busts, modern abstracts, men on    horses, classical maidens, Rodins, the lot
It's like the giant storehouse    at the end of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark
sets off into it in his own eccentric way
He knows exactly where heels going
He climbs a ladder, like you find in a library - then pushes himself off, and whizzes the entire length of the room on slippery wooden runners
He has now reached the sculpture area, but    the painting heels looking for is on the other side
He crosses the room by     using the sculptures as a kind of artistic obstacle course
In front of him     is the Burghers of Calais, a Rodin statue of 5 prisoners in chains
He simply     walks across their 5 heads, like stones in a stream
He then comes to an abstract modern piece, which he uses as    a slide   and at the end of which, he crawls through the hole in the next modern    thing
He then begins to climb up various famous ancient statues, using the    mouths   as footholes, breasts as support, codpieces as steps and empty    eyes as   finger holes
After a problem getting his
foot caught in the jaw of a sculptured dog, he walks flat along a modern sculpture, then uses a sequence of classic sculptures as stairs - on the head of a little Degas ballerina, one step on to the bottom of a horse, two steps onto the head of the person riding the horse, three steps and now he's on the other side of the hall
He then triumphantly pulls out a painting
It's the one
, What would we do without you
The entire inventory of British Art stored in that one, curious brain of yours
beams
- Then we are agreed, gentlemen
He goes
Only if we're positive that the new catalogue database will render Mr
Bean's hitherto 'talents' obsolete
There's no question
Very well
Mr Bean is
art history
We can all stop taking the pills
reserved smatter of laughter, from relief more than anything
talks into an intercom on the table
Miss Hutchinson, would you send Mr
Bean up to the boardroom, please
(/ ) Yes sir
oh, and Lord Walton, the Grierson Gallery called again
Thank you
(To the room) One final thing
Once again we have been invited by the Grierson Gallery of Southern California to second one of our staff for a short visit
The Grierson has a fairly modest collection - but it does include the most famous American painting of all, 'Whistler's Mother'
Any thoughts
Cut to the trustees - they shake their heads and wrinkle, their noses, not very interested
106 year old   puts up his hand
Yes
Sir Rupert
And may  say sir, how honoured we are that you still grace us with all your time, wisdom, and infinite knowledge
Your invaluable thoughts, sir
Could you speak up please
didn't catch the question
: - Back in his office area  ceremoniously hands   the Van Hocht painting
He's very proud of himself
Thank you, Bean
You're a genius
laughs - delighted
exits and   enters, warily
Mr
Bean
Lord Walton would like to see you in the boardroom
gives a little pleasured squeak
How exciting for him
He follows out into the corridor
: walks along    the same corridor as before
Turns off another light
Then comes    to the room    where he saw the Programmer
The computer, showing a Van Gogh    portrait, is    on and no-one's there
, who hates wasted electricity, goes    in to switch    it off
We see the Van Gogh change to a pictorial representation of the Storage room - with an arrow pointing to where the Van Gogh is located
is clearly going to be replaced by this programme
Or not
searches for the plug, but it's under acres of desk - so he simply pulls a cable out of the back the computer
The entire system clicks off
At which moment the Programmer comes back in
What's happening here
Ahm
With a slightly guilty smile he picks up the cable again looks with puzzlement at the five available places to plug it in and just takes a random guess
And a disastrous one
There is a ugly electrical fizzle
The screens come on white, then pop out completely
Ah
Ahm
realises that he has done something wrong and quickly shoves the cable into another circuit
The Van Gogh appears happily on the screen
and both give out a sigh of relief
smiles and leaves quickly
But a second later the computer screen disintegrates and the Van Gogh slides down the screen like a water-colour in the rain
The  difficult to breathe
10 : - You have your voting slips, gentlemen
Please remember the Americans are looking for something quite high powered doctorate preferably
There is a knock at the door
enters
smiles
The rest of the faces in the room are looking dangerously close to smug
is very nervous indeed
(gravely) Ah, Mr
Bean
Please take a seat for a moment
have some news which will not, 'm afraid
The phone rings
answers
sits next to  and sniffs at him
's breath hasn't improved
(into phone) Yes
Put him on
Timothy
The computer
Yes
When
How
All    of it
Absolutely all of it
Did you back it up
How long will    it
Another six months
Fair enough
Come up here will    you, dear boy
He slowly hangs up
Everyone has got the gist of what has just occurred with the new computer- The energy drains from them all as they contemplate another six months with  still on the staff
coughs politely
As  was saying, gentlemen
The Grierson Gallery
South California
Great opportunity
Thousands-of miles-away though it is
Doctorate or (  ) no doctorate, perhaps All get the message at the same moment and hurriedly scribble on their voting slips
The slips get handed down the line to
We see that every single slip has '' on it
Mr
Bean
Wonderful news
You are going to America
(overwhelmed) Ooooh, how lovely
There is a knock at the door
The fat, bespectacled, puts his head round it
(beaming) Ah, Timothy
You're sacked
: - rounds a corner and walks     towards us, imitating a bowlegged cowboy
The Theme from Bonanza plays
He      whips out his pair of imaginary six shooters, spins them on his fingers and     returns them to-their imaginary holsters, making gun sound effects
He's very      happy
-He passes the Security Guard - he draws his gun on him - zero reaction     the Guard just raises his eyebrows and yawns
heads on through the gallery merrily - but suddenly, his good mood is broken, when he notices 3 schoolgirls entering a new exhibition, called The Ultra-Human Form
This worries him - and we soon see why -  heads in to the room where all the paintings are very graphic nudes, and the 3 girls are having a good giggle
quickly rushes over and with his hand covers the breasts of the painting they're inspecting
Two girls then move on to the next painting - which unfortunately also has breasts
stretches and just manages to cover them with his other hand
Now the third girl    heads on, so  can drop the hand on the first painting - but now has to try    to cover the breasts on the third painting, which is a real long stretch away
He can't quite make it, so he takes off his shoes, which gives him the extra    3 inches
Again, safe
Just
Now, all three girls leave the paintings - but, to 's chagrin, head over to a classical nude sculpture in the middle of the room
It's like the 3 Graces, 3 naked women back to back
thinks fast
He quickly whips off his 12 Belt and rushes over to the statue, where he succeeds in looping it round to cover all six nipples
Unfortunately the girls have already lost interest and head over to the other side of the gallery
To 's horror
Because at that moment we reveal what is on the other side of the room
epic painting in the style of the others - with literally 40 graphically naked people
sprints across the room, stands on a chair, and desperately tries to cover a particularly lurid example of a gentleman's manhood
At which    moment the teacher of the party and 40 other schoolgirls appear and scream in    chorus
thinks that it is the painting that has caused offence and is in    outraged agreement with them
He turns
Cut wide to reveal that they are    screaming because he's beltless trousers    have fallen down

The three are strolling towards the main entrance

Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world
Has a couple of doctorates no less
Great news

, Vice President, is a very pleasant, but slightly worried man, knocking on 40
Too nice for his own good
The three pass a lone   wearing a cheap vac-form   face mask
David can't help being just a little nice to him and finds himself left behind
He scampers to catch up
First, catching under the handle - then the couch, then Four other chairs - and finally the deep freeze
No-one's going to get in through that door
pushes the string    back inside the    letter box and slaps his hand in    satisfaction
He locks the     door's enormous    padlock, looks about carefully to    make sure no one's around,    and then hides    the key under a garden gnome on the    floor, standing amongst a    row of pathetic    pot plants
: The lady checking in  looks puzzled as she holds his passport
So he pulls the shockingly stupid face
0h yes, she sees, that's the guy in the picture
She hands him his ticket
- Here we go, sir
You've been moved to l st
class
Apparently your friends at the Gallery were so delighted that you're finally on your way
is very touched
: - enters the first class lounge
It's fairly empty, but  still squeezes himself between an old lady drinking a cup of tea, and a very grand looking American military man in a business suit
The Grand Man lights up a cigar
This doesn't please Mr "No Smoking
First, he waves the smoke away, in small, then big, then huge wafting motions
Then he tries, miming, to cut it up into segments and move them aside
The man pays no attention at all
puts a plastic mug over his face, like a gas mask and breathes heavily
The man looks at him - but doesn't give a damn now takes a paper bag - catches some of the smoke, and take it over and empties it into the dust bin
The Grand Man goes on smoking stubbornly
He then sees a magazine rack and leaves his cigar as he goes to get one
13 Sounds like a real coup, sir
getting this Doctor of
Various things
Thank you
However, as you know, this is not an inexpensive venture, and, financially speaking, we're in very serious crap right now
He can't quite hide his tackiness
)  holds the door for  - then sees an old woman coming towards him
He waits for her to go through, and due to his sweetness, is again left behind
He rushes to catch up
They are now passing the reception counter cum gallery shop
exchanges smiles with the cashier,
Very bubbly, not very bright
The shop is full of Whistler's Mother memorabilia - posters, cards, porcelain statuettes
So
'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel
Love to, sir, but no can do
No spare room
Period
David
Oh, look,  mean, it's kind of the last thing
mean, 'd really like to, but
things at home are kind of sensitive, so  couldn't really er
thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year
the  financial on the other hand
maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs
Yes
Great news
Fabulous
Triumphant
Course it might need a little smoothing over
When's he due
hands  a piece of paper
Tomorrow
You have a problem with that
No
Perfect
Looking forward to it
: The camera faces Mr  sitting in a Photo booth
His face is totally impassive for 1, 2, then 3 flashes
And then, just before the 4th flash, he pulls the biggest, maddest face you've ever seen
Flash
He gives a little Satisfied giggle

California time
pleasant suburban house
's car pulls into the drive
, his slightly Gothic 16 year old daughter, is kissing , her scruffy boyfriend
He sits astride a motor scooter
He has a bum-fluff moustache
gets out of his car and approaches them
Hi, Jennifer
How was school
(she doesn't break the kiss with Brad) oh really
That's good, great
Fantastic
We'll talk some more
The two continue kissing as  moves on
He's just about to head for the house when a swish convertible draws up at the curb
's wife, , has been given a lift home by her young attractive boss,
They are laughing in the car as  walks up
15 He is slightly disturbed to see  kiss  on the cheek before getting out with her port folio
smiles pleasantly on seeing
Hello, David
Hi, Charles
(To Alison) Wow - late
(brightly) had to do some last minute stuff
My fault
We've got a heavy load on at present
How about you, gallery going well
Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level think it
Don't ask him about work, Charlie
Life's too short
Alison is the same age as , but seems to have lasted the course better - she's confident, in good shape
The atmosphere is awkward
screams out
Her 8 year old brother,  has sprung from the shrubbery and lassoed her and
goes over to sort them out
Kevin
You stop that right now
Great kids
Good looking too
You think so
Well  'spose they're pretty, you know
okay, looks-wise
Take after their mother, huh
Ah
absolutely
is not very happy here
16 : - It is open plan and leads through into the lounge
and  enter
puts her port folio on the table and leads  onto a sofa
She puts her arms round him
Let's take a break, David
This weekend, why don't we just get into the car and drive to the coast
Find a motel
Like before the kids were born
Go to a fairground
Win me another Bambi
She reaches across and picks up a little ceramic Bambi on a table next to the couch
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin Sounds great
Excellent
Though-, Ahm
there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England
() Yeeees
And they asked me if we'd like to
you know
put him up for a while
There aren't hotels
Yes, there are hotels
They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family
Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff
() And what did you say
said 'd check with you
She looks at him piercingly
This clearly happens a lot
She knows when he's telling the truth
Pause
Then  said 'yes'
She puts Bambi carefully back on the table, gets up and moves to the kitchen
follows
Do we know anything about him
Ahm - he's male
He's English
He's a doctor of er
at least 2 things
think they would have mentioned if he was a     blind dwarf
Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all     the time
think we're looking at someone moderately normal     here
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'
Yes
Yes
(pause) Sometime
She shakes her head
It's the last thing we need
That's exactly what  said
before  said - Great, it's a sensational idea
" He knows he's made a mess here
Enter , their smart young son, strolling through
Hiya Dad ~ 'll need you upstairs for homework in about
(checks watch) oh, 20 minutes
Great, good
And  exits
18 Didn't kids do their own homework, like way back
Years ago
No
Course not
Just imagining it
isn't really listening
Much tension

m
time
black London taxi is parked outside a terraced house with its motor idling
Its driver looks fed up waiting
appears at a downstairs window, motioning to his watch that he will not be long
: ' - - is ready to leave his room
Battered old suitcase in hand, he checks the room from the doorway
Every conceivable thing that can be opened - cupboards, drawers, fridge -sports an oversized padlock
Even Bean's old
phone has one on its dial
looks across to his , who is lounging on a miniature chair, inside an up-sided cardboard box
The box is sits on an armchair
hand-written sign, taped to its roof reads: ' ' followed by three stars
19 smaller sign informs us that the hotel is: ''
is just about to leave but stops to consider
Taking a felt tipped pen, he adds two more stars on the hotel hoarding, as a treat
He then, slightly, incomprehensibly, begins to tie string it around various objects in the flat
The fridge - the corner of a chair, a couch leg
: ' '  ~ leaves his flat
lee notice a large official sign stuck on the door saying ' "
He now turns his attention to the pieces of string hanging out the letter box in his door
Grabbing the bunch of them, he pulls
back inside the flat
we now understand the string - as all the furniture starts to move across the flat
It works incredibly neatly the chair reaches the door 20 acts fast
He takes the cigar - and quickly dunks it in the old woman's cup of tea
He sits there, guiltlessly, as the Grand Man returns
Simultaneously, the man tries to suck the wet cigar, and the Old woman drinks the disgusting tea horrid experience for both
: -
Boarding time
enters the plane and turns    right, into the body of the plane
After walking right down the plane, he    is directed by a hostess back up to first
As he walks back, we notice the'    ridiculous contrast, from totally cramped accommodation with hundreds of   children and muzak, to the elegance, and space of First class
couldn't be more thrilled
There follows a sequence of short moments from this nightmare flight
1/ The Old Tea-Drinking Lady is being helped with her ,luggage
hostess slides it into the compartment above her head
Be careful
It's for my Grand-daughter
The next instant  comes up with his case
He opens the     same locker, and tries to fit his case in
Doesn't quite go - so he pushes     it violently
We hear crunching cracking sounds
Finally, it's almost there     -  slams the locker door
One final definitive, though muffled, smash
The   looks at  suspiciously
2/  sits down - and who should be his next door neighbour
The Grand Man, whose name is
smiles merrily
The affection is not mutual
Champagne comes    round instantly
takes it, along with a small bowl of nuts, and clinks    glasses with his unsmiling partner
tries to impress him by throwing    nuts up into the air and catching them in his mouth (a well practised art)
No response
then switches on the noisy overhead air blower
Then can't turn it down again
It's very stuck
He manages however to push it away from his face - straight into '
looks annoyed,  guiltless
21 Then ' has an idea
He takes a tissue out of his pocket, puts in his mouth, chews it into a spitball And rams it into the blower
Both of them are relieved
picks up his champagne to have his first proper sip
And whapp
The spitball, under high pressure, shoots into it, sending champagne spraying all over
Not a good start
3/-- is reading the in-flight magazine
There's an annoying sound
He looks sideways - it is the headphones of the   in the seat across the aisle
He's fallen asleep with his headphones on
looks annoyed
Then suddenly decides to cut his fingernails with a little pair of scissors he carries
He holds out his hand to snip the nail - and accidentally on purpose simply cuts the wire of the boy's headset
That's better
4/ Night
Wide shot of the plane - everyone is asleep except one pool of light
It's Mr  still up, reading
But even he is   wilting
His eyes close, and his body starts to waver towards sleep
Next to    him,  is in a total lying position - and unfortunately,   as  slowly tips over, his mouth comes into direct contact with '   flies
From across the compartment, a hostess sees what's happening
She's shocked, comes over and taps  on the ,,shoulder
He shoots up, and nearly strangles her in shock
She calms him down, shows him how to put his chair back - and leaves him to sleep
5/  still asleep
With  asleep completely on top of him
Completely
His hand is spread on ' face
' eyes open
He sees what's happened
His arm goes up and rings for the Hostess
6/ Morning has broken
is still trying to sleep -  is wide awake
The Hostess approaches, and the  of the   says her son isn't very well
decides to cheer him up
He mimes an aeroplane which makes the boy feel more ill
Then does a rather good lizard impersonation by sticking bits of paper to his tongue and eye-lids and fluttering them
He then brings out a scrunched up bag of Dolly Mixtures and does his trick of throwing a sweet in the air and catching it in his mouth
The boy is too ill to be impressed
tries to cheer him up with his imaginary gun pretending to be a cowboy and then a tough American Cop
Nothing
Then he has an extremely fun idea
He empties the Dolly Mixtures from the paper bag and pockets them
22 He then blows up the empty bag and is about to pop it to wake , when he sees it's got a hole in it
No fun
Meanwhile, the Boy has taken out his sick-bag
is delighted - yes, that's perfect
He turns away for a split second to scrunch up the useless bag, while, unseen to him, the boy vomits into his bag
turns, grabs the bag from him - blows into it, puts it right into ' face at arms length, and smacks his hands together
at just the right moment
: - The traditional exit area
random bunch of people are waiting - relatives, limousine drivers - and, rather strangely, three 30 year old women dressed in curly red wigs from the musical, 'Annie'
The  are at the barrier
has a cardboard sign with '
' written on it
People are streaming out of the Arrivals gate
is not happy
Actually no one is
looks particularly fed up
For all you know, he may be a very attractive young man
Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep
All Englishmen are ugly
What makes you say that
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish
Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh
Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors
Richard Burton was very good-looking
Welsh
Sean Connery
23 Scottish
Tom Jones
Welsh again
Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside
No-one's asking you to go to bed with him
glares at him
tired  has had enough of this waiting already
Bed sounds good though
Bed sounds great
: - , is off the plane
strides ahead of him, a huge wet patch in a semi-circle around his neck
comes to a moving walkways
He steps on to it sheepishly, thinking it's very daring and brave, gripping the handrail as though he was travelling at 100 mph
But soon he gains greater confidence
He stands up straight, both hands off the rail
There are a couple of  leaning against a wall, chatting notices their guns
Slipping into role-play mode, he reaches into his breast pocket, ready to bring out his imaginary shooter
The last security guard he tried this with just yawned ~ so  thinks it's safe
But this time, the turn and stare at him tensely
Flustered by their interest in him,  needs to get away
He turns,        but finds that he is walking in the opposite direction, on the spot
The read this as suspicious behaviour and move towards him suspiciously turns to gets himself going in the right direction
The  follow runs
The  give chase
: 24 '
- little   arrives at the barrier
The three red wigged clones from the musical, `Annie' swamp him with shrieks and kisses
The  are getting impatient
(bored ) Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived
Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly
vote for Bart
Shut up, Kevin
, seriously -  know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird
What do you think it is, Dad
Jen says it's a moustache,  say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting
You know the thing  hate most about children
Nope
You

They draw their guns
Two more  appear, coming from the opposite direction
is trapped
He drops his case
1 Police
Stop or we shoot
25 Passers-by scream and throw themselves to the floor
freezes on the spot, terrified
All four  have their guns trained on him in the shooting position
1 Carefully take out your weapon, holding the butt with two fingers only
Slowly place it on the floor and take three paces back
Dead slowly,  puts his hand into his inside jacket pocket and brings it back out made in the shape of a gun
He slowly transfers that imaginary item to the finger and thumb of his left hand
He bends down and places it on the floor then takes three paces back
He gives out a big breath after the effort of it all
The  just stare at him, gob-smacked
Little   from plane steers up from nowhere
She rattles her box of broken china and kicks  in the shins
Things are not going his way
: - Bright and clinical
Close on  sitting behind a       table; a very small man in very big trouble
Behind him, two uniformed        stand guard
large, black plain clothes detective sits opposite, smoking      a cigarette
This is He studies 's passport photo
It's the        baboon face
He holds it up to bean's face to make a comparison
pulls       the face to match the photo
Mr
Bean
Are you presently on any kind of medication at all
thinks deeply for a moment then shakes his head
You could certainly use some
: - ,  and  are slumped in seats near the barrier
walks up
What did they say
26 Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like
Did you really ask
'm not sure  got the right person but they were a bit busy
What's wrong with you, David
All you have to do is say, Excuse me, 've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and 'd really like some action from you before the end of the world
'll go
No, no
'11 try again
said, '11 go
She goes
shakes his head disappointedly al,-- his father slumps down on the seat
He overhears  flirting with an incredibly undesirable bloke in a leather jacket - white, with Rasta hair extensions, and about sixty rings in his nose
(This is )
So
where do your parents live
My parents are dead
is pretty confident that he knows who killed them
Yeah, so are mine
: 1 puts  in the back of a taxi with his case
He takes some dollar notes from his own wallet and hands them to the driver
27 1 Just get him the hell out of here, will ya
He slams the door and the taxi drives away
: -
- The  are all asleep in eccentric positions on the seats
's head is resting on 's leg
Kevin's cardboard sign with '
, written on it falls from his lap to the floor
: - The taxi draws up outside the house
gets out with his case
The is strangely friendly
Thanks man,  can't tell you how much  appreciate talking to ya
In this job you get so many jerks spilling their guts all over ya, with their stupid problems
But you, you're a great listener, ya know that
smiles politely
Taxi drives away
walks up to' the front porch, checks the house number on his piece of paper and presses the doorbell
No answer
Presses again
Still no answer
Now where have they hidden the key
He inspects things carefully
The camera sees what he sees
the     doormat, the flowerpot, the window-ledge and then he spots a little stone     frog
smiles
Key hiding is something he knows about - and people     are pathetically obvious about it picks up the  to reveal the front     door key
It glints in the porch-light
: - lets himself in
The pre-alarm buzzer goes off quietly
He has 15 seconds before the alarm goes off proper
He strolls confidently to where the alarm control unit obviously is
under the stairs
28 Close-up of flashing
Again,  looks carefully and finds the magnetic box, housing a little key, attached to the underside of the console
Just as the alarm goes off, for the splittest of a secondette, he turns the key in its slot
and is safe
finds the switch and turns on the hall light
He switches it off again then on
Then rapidly clicks it on and off repeatedly
Fun
: - Shot from across the street, with all the house lights flashing off and on madly
: - stands in front of the television, looking a little annoyed about the fact that the remote control in his hand is having no effect at all
He stabs at it randomly
: - The garage doors are swinging open and closed rhythmically
: '  - and  are asleep in the back
drives in silence, Alison next to him
Uneasy atmosphere
stabs at buttons on the car radio
It isn't working any more, David
know - '11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it
Stupid thing
29 No,
It's not working any longer -you and me
Pause
's now heard it completely
He takes his eyes off the road and stares at  a moment too long
car's horn snatches back his attention
Jesus
need some time, David
little time
It's not just you
It's partly me
But in general
it's
mostly me, right
Pause
Single shot of Alison and David
She doesn't answer
He is destitute
: - wanders down the stairs in his pyjamas
He sees a walkman - and puts it on happily
He moves to the rhythm
He locks the door, turns on the alarm and turns off the hall light
: - 's car turns into the drive just as the hall light goes off
(For the next few minutes, knife-edged timing 0 is all)
The  sleepily get out of the car and approach the house
brings out his door key
: - The exact moment the key turns in the lock, , still wearing headphones, disappears into a bedroom with a little ceramic sign on it saying: ' '
The exhausted family enter an apparently untouched house
turns on the stairs light, climbs to his room off the landing and closes the door on which a sign reads: ''
30 At that instant  walks out, looking for the bathroom with his wash bag
He looks up at the light
It should not be on
He frowns, turns it off and exits to bathroom
At which precise moment , zombie-like, is halfway up the stairs Thanks a lot, Kevin
goes into her room
The sign reads: `'
turns on the light and climbs the stairs
David heads into the kitchen
They exchange a sad look
She goes into their bedroom: the sign reads: ''
At which instant, , still wearing headphones, leaves the bathroom, and heads downstairs
: - The light is on
takes a deep breath
Bad night
He picks up an empty coffee jar, sighs and goes into the pantry a full one
enters
He opens the refrigerator and he studies the food on offer
Nothing he fancies
then
He sees a little plate of 3 strawberries
He eats     one, then two, then pops the third into his mouth
It tastes a bit off, so     he takes it out of his mouth, puts it back on the plate, closes the fridge    door, and exits
just as  comes out of the pantry
Close on 's     hand as it comes round the door frame and turns off the light
, on the     move, stubs his toe on a chair
He groans in pain, limps to the fridge
He spots the lone, already sucked strawberry and pops it into his mouth
: & '  - is watching
in bed with the remote control
enters with orange juice and puts it down by his side of the bed
The lights blown in the kitchen
'll fix it tomorrow
They're not a happy couple
She concentrates on the  even turns it up a little
: - turns on the basin's cold faucet
It gushes noisily
: & '  - Close on Letterman on the
The noise from it drowns out any noise from the bathroom
(The bathroom has two doors - one into  and 's bedroom, the other onto the landing)
: - can't hear the
because of his headphones
He takes out his toothbrush but notices an electric one on a shelf with spare brush heads
He's intrigue
He swaps the heads and enjoys cleaning his teeth with this clever modern implement
-He puts the   electric brush down and checks his teeth    in the mirror
He has forgotten to   turn off the brush and so it vibrates off    the sink and lands in the toilet
Bean fishes it out and places it back on    the shelf where he found it
He turns    off faucet, then exits, turning out the    light
enters and turns the light on again
He takes down the toothbrush and cleans his teeth
He calls through the bedroom door
That poor guy, Bean
He's probably still sitting at London Airport
He finishes his teeth then runs the hot faucet
He exits to bedroom as enters from hall with dirty socks
: & '  - is still watching
The volume is getting to
Alison, please
32 : '
~ is just finishing washing his socks in David's water
He rings the dirty water from them, and exits
enters in his under shorts
He checks his tired eyes in the mirror then washes his face in the basin water without looking
: ~ notices a framed photograph on the wall
It is of the  family
They are grouped outside their house
It is a very happy picture smiles at it
He takes it off the wall and takes it into a bedroom
As the door quietly closes we see the sign: ''
: & '  - Lights are out
and  in bed
The latter is facing away
need to make a confession
know you're awake
Please, it's important
(Long pause) (without stirring) Go ahead

smiles in spite of herself
She turns over and puts her arm around She gets up close to his face
There were three strawberries
One
33 Liar
0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know
smiles, sleepily, and goes to kiss him
She stops and sniffs
Thoroughly put off, she rolls over and closes her eyes
Ali
What's wrong
Your face smells like a foot
: - The next morning
Shot from across the street:  newspaper boy delivers
Birds sing
It's a lovely, peaceful, early morning
Then
a terrifying girl's scream pierces the quiet
: - The whole family charges out onto the landing
hurtles out of her room screaming
She barges through the family and locks herself in the bathroom
What is it
Jennifer
(0
) There's a man
there's a man
there's a man in my
Honey, calm down now
it's okay
(p

) There's a man
woke up next to a man
It wouldn't be the first time
34 Shut up, Kevin
(to Jennifer) Honey, you-re not making sense
It's okay
There's no one out here
Just open the door
Trust me
Pause
then a click of the bathroom lock
Jennifer comes out
Then there's another click
breezes out of Jennifer's bedroom, past the family, in his pyjamas, carrying a wash bag and a towel over his arm
He waves to them friendly, slips into the bathroom and closes the door
The family stare in amazement
: - The family, now dressed for work and school, are having breakfast at the kitchen table
After an uncomfortable silence: He makes Prince Charles look kind of handsome
He can't stay here, David
Okay
It's not a problem
Let's just sit
'11 talk to the gallery
David, 'm serious
know you are
Very serious
most of the time these days
Now what does that mean
My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and 'm supposed to think it's amusing
(looks at his tie) That tie's God-awful
Why do you wear it
is thrown
He looks down at his tie
looks grumpy
is eating happily
35 enters, dressed, carrying a plastic carrier bag
He acknowledges the family with a grunt and a smile
Ah, Mr Bean
Excuse me
He moves to the phone, checks his watch and dials quickly
: ' - -  - The ancient
phone starts to ring on a small table
(The following takes place in a matter of seconds)
On the table are two, large, shiny, hard backed books, wedged up    at one end and sloping away at right angles to one another
Each book has a     pair of rulers set, parallel to one another, in Play-Doh
They each form     a canal
Between one pair of rulers sits a small box of salt
Between the    other pair is a miniature bust of
As the phone continues to ring     and vibrate the table, these items judder along the canal, an inch at    a time
The box of salt teaches the bottom of the book and topples over the edge of the table
( The  bust' teeters on the edge of its book)
The salt lands in a plastic funnel, taped to the top of a bamboo stick
The bottom of the stick sits on the  2 button of a
remote control
Close-up of its infrared
as it flashes once
The phone stops ringing
: the
comes on at the start of a documentary about grizzly bears
voice-over begins a narration
: close on  sitting in his cardboard box hotel
Flickering light from the
plays on his face
: - Bean hangs up happily, then approaches the toaster, stuffs a pair of wet socks into it and pulls down the start lever
Satisfied, he now turns to the family
Now - can  help
They just stare, dumb-founded
36 : - and  arrive at the car and get in
heads out of the drive at a reasonable speed
suddenly yanks on the hand-brake
's head hits the windshield with a sickening thud
reaches for and fastens his seat belt
He looks to
gives  a pained look
What planet does he come from
He fastens his own seat belt while  wonders why it's all taking so long
: - It's a rather fancy building
Like a little Guggenheim  parks by a large, expensive, looking car
opens his door and it bangs-hard against the pristine body work
: - As  and  enter through the swing doors they meet , the very bubbly girl in charge of entrance tickets at the reception cum shop counter
Two dollars please
Annie, it's me
Oh, right, yeah
(to Bean) two dollars please
No, Annie, no
This is Doctor Bean
He's going to be working with us
frowns
That word 'doctor'
37 Oh, great
Usually we charge people two dollars to come in- but for people who work here, that would be 730 dollars a year, which is like, a lot of money, so we kinda like let them off
Hi
smiles at her
He doesn't like to say much does he
Right first time
can understand
Neither do
As  and  move on,  gives  a 1ittle wave
She waves sweetly back
She cocks her head to one side and watches him go
She likes Mr
a lot
: - and  arrive In the ground floor gallery
few visitors are viewing the paintings
The acknowledge , the huge, ex-army, Security Man, sitting on a small chair by a wall, reading a newspaper
The pass two oldish ladies inspecting a painting You'll notice, our clientele is not totally young
sometimes worry they're not really getting to grips with the art on a deep aesthetic level
Stay with the ladies as  and  head on
1 What do you think
2 0h yes - lovely - very nice
1 And what colour would you use for the curtains
38 2 Well,  thought the sort of blue in this one
(she points to a gorgeous blue Matisse) And  thought the curtains in the bathroom would be nice in this yellow
And-they head on to a Van Gogh with a nice yellow in it
stops to admire a painting
It is Pre-Raphaelite in style, depicting a woman reclined on a bed in a castle chamber
She is wearing a chastity belt fastened with a small padlock, her breasts are concealed under a draped flag
It is a tasteful and romantic picture
Beautiful
' ' by John Everett Millais, 1829 to 96
Know it
shakes his head
It's the padlock he's interested in he points at it and smiles
walks up
Excuse me
Mr Grierson called down
He's ready to see you upstairs
Thanks, Annie
walks off back the way she came, looking at  approvingly over her shoulder
Better go
Grierson hates people being late
Yes
Ahm
think '11
He gestures that held like to tidy up a little
Brush his hair, etc waddles off after  clearly in need of relief
watches him go
Why me
: -
is catching up with
She notices him following and coyly smiles to herself
She stops, turns round and grins
She thinks he has come to say something to her
39 stops dead in front of her - then turns sharp left into the men's washroom
's smile fades
: - comes out of a booth
He tidies his hair and tie in a mirror
He pushes down    the pressurised tap to wash his hands
It splashes terribly
The whole front    of his trousers are soaked
The last thing you want when about to meet your    new boss
Damn
There now follow a quick, complicated piece of business
1/  spots a paper-towel dispenser
He turns towards it at just the moment a man exits from a booth -  turns back to the sink to hide his trousers, as the man swiftly does his hands, goes to the paper dispenser, and takes the last towel
Damn again
2/     now puts    his hope in a rolling    towel
But it's rather high
He has to jump    to try to    reach the trouser
At which point Another Man enters
Jumping     has    been caught in a very    weird position
He pretends he has chosen    the Men's    Room as the place to    do his rather energetic exercise routine
3/ As the man leaves, he then tries to blow the patch dry with his mouth
Another Man enters
Again,  is 1 compromised - pretends it's even more exercises
That man also enters a booth
4/  suddenly notices the hand drying machine
He turns it on
healthy blast of warm air
Annoyingly, it's also rather too high
He tries jumping and bouncing to get his waist to the right height
It's not going to work
Brainwave
He climbs up on two sinks
Now the drier is blowing in exactly the right place
sways to let the air cover the whole area
It's working excellently
5/ At which moment, one of the men exits from         a booth and sees him in the mirror
is in an immensely compromising          sex-with-machine position
He pretends he's there to change the light bulb         above, which he takes out calmly and polishes
The man leaves,  smiles
But as he exits, 's face transforms - he's totally scalded his fingers         on the scorching bulb
40 6/  rushes to the sink, puts his fingers under the tap, pushes on the water - and soaks himself all over again
At which moment,  enters, exasperated
Come on
Let's go
exits uneasily hunched to hide his wet patch
They enter the corridor, and he spots a newspaper
: '  - and  enter
It's        a warm, formal
office
On the wall behind the desk is a full-size, framed       poster of Whistler's Mother
On a white background, at the base of       the poster, a caption reads: ' ,   '       '
Elsewhere, the walls are full of paintings
and  look up from a computer screen at  and , who is, rather weirdly, carrying a newspaper in fronts of his flies approaches David, and shakes his hand
Ah, David
Finally
(    ) And this must be our professor from across the sea
Yes, this is Doctor Bean
Actually 'm not
er
This is Bernard Schimmel
Bernie the Doctor
offers his hand
has to do a nifty handchange to free up the correct hand for the handshake
The newspaper stays firmly in place
Ah ~ the Tribune - mind if  just
He reaches out to borrow the newspaper
has to squeeze in right next to the desk and sit behind it, before he can hand the paper over   thus ensuring the continued invisibility of the wet patch
studies the paper for a second
Take a seat, gentlemen
although before we settle - feast your eyes on these
goes to a painting on a wall
and  follow ~  about one inch from 's back, walking in perfect rhythm
Arthur Rackham
Originals of course
Got four of them
Check this out
Venus and the Cat, Aesop's Fables
Isn't that something
He heads towards said illustration on adjacent wall - and  and follow, still totally glued together
strange sight
They're beautiful, sir
Maybe
Hell of a price, '11 tell you
Anyway - down to business
They head back to the desk - but Bean, in a momentary lapse of concentration fails to follow
He's now stuck on the wrong side of the room, unable to turn around
Bernie was just showing me his new ideas for a cross-gallery computer system
Dr Bean - would you like to look at this
Very exciting stuff
Ahm
is slightly surprised
But they persevere
What 'm doing, Dave, is developing the ultimate user-friendly,' interactive public guide to the gallery
Punching buttons on the computer, he reveals wonderful maps of the gallery, and when clicking on sections of the map, graphic explanations of each rooms contents
42 Meanwhile
Bean has spotted a fan on the other side of the room
He moves around the room, always facing straight to the wall
When he reaches the fan, he switches it on: unfortunately it's a rotating fan - so to keep the wind on his trousers,  has to do a strange, rhythmic dancing movement, following the arc of the fan
It's very good Bernie
But the particular glory of the system
is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery
Not bad, eh
What do you think, Doctor
Ah
Doctor Bean
turns, shocked to    have been observed
He looks down at his trousers and,
, they're    dry at last
He's delighted, and moves back across the road towards them,    hands in pockets, in a big, confident, groin- thrusting, dry-trouser    boasting walk
Well, thanks for dropping by
Enjoy your stay with our Vice President and his family
They're simple people
-
but warm, yes, Doctor
'm not actually
um
Settled in yet
know
Plenty of time
Bernie, perhaps you'd like to take Dr
Bean on a tour of the gallery
Absolutely
This way, sir
displays his crotch proudly one last time before he and  exit
tries to fathom the strange man who just left
He's a genius, right
43 Ah
He certainly has something, sir
Very pleased you've taken him in, David
At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player
Yes, although,  really
thank you
Yes, it's great to have him with us
The whole family's very excited
Glad to hear it
Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you
You're not going to
Sack him
David, what else can  do
This business is not, repeat, not breaking even
And David
notice anything this morning
frowns then sees
You've tinted your hair
It takes years off you, sir

: - End of the day
perks    up at the reception desk as , but especially , approaches    from the gallery area
She has a pile of tissues near-by and draws a    heart on one of them
She arranges it on the counter-top where  could    not fail to see it on his way to the exit
Goodnight Annie
Night
does not even notice her
As  heads for the exit,  suddenly sneezes
44 He reaches for 's love message and blows his nose on it
He drops the tissue in a bin as he exits
sighs her disappointment
: - (About 5 p
m
)  and  head for the parking lot
On the way, 's interest is drawn to the   we met before in his Clinton mask, performing his heart out in front of the Dead Cars sculpture
lingers
The  accosts a woman, pretending to brush dust from her clothes, comb her hair etc
The  is a bit of a pain in the ass really
The woman quickly moves on
is intrigued
The  mimes climbing a ladder
goes up next to him - and looks up
There's nothing there
He decides the  is a bit of a tricky
This is confirmed when the  pretends he's locked behind a pane of glass
simply pokes his finger through the imaginary glass wall, and hits the 's nose
:  watching bemusedly some way off
The  is however delighted someone is taking an interest at last
He takes a handkerchief from 's pocket, and gets  to guess which hand the hanky's in
It's not in the left
Not in the right
isn't the slightest bit impressed - he just reaches round and takes the hank-y from where it's tucked into the 's trousers - and heads away
As he moves off, the  touches h' on the shoulder
turns and the  starts a mocking gun duel
He draws his guns
is pretty unimpressed
The  turns his back and walks the 10 paces to draw
4 He turns
But now  decides to settles it once and for all
In a brilliant piece of big mime, he puts together the biggest gun ever seen outside an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie
He sets up a pedestal - opens a case ~ lifts out a hugely heavy gun - then the 7 bits that click on that gun
Then opens another case, and takes out the huge artillery shell to load it
The  is getting very frightened
Then  pulls up an imaginary stool to sit behind his mega-Gatling Gun
The  begins to run away twirls in his imaginary seat, and lines up his sights, following the terrified
45 Finally, in a  that almost knocks  out of his imaginary seat, he fires
10 seconds delay, and the  falls in a very dramatic death, 50 yards away
is happy - and heads back to the parking lot where , arms folded, leans against his car
gets into his car
opens the passenger door and thumps it loudly into the side of the expensive car next-door (same as this morning)
: - parks next to a beaten up convertible
Okay
'll get some steaks
Alison loves steak
Wine - good
Candy
No candy
Alison hates candy
We gotta do this right, Bean, or
(looks at Bean) Just stay out of trouble, okay
nods
gets out and heads for the mall
Nearby woman tramp ( ) goes   through a trash can
tries to control himself but weakens
He plays with all the buttons and switches on the dashboard; windshield wipers, lights
Then he notices a throbbing noise
He gets out of the car to investigate
swiftly locates the throbbing sound
The e-empty convertible has its engine running
notices the keys in the ignition
How stupid of someone
He turns off the engine and takes out the keys
There are several people returning to their cars with groceries
offers the car keys to them as if to say: "Are these yours
" [The following should take place at quite a speed, real drama
] Then suddenly,   dashes towards  from the direction ' of the Mall, weaving in and out of parked cars, with a small white carrier bag, assumedly full of money
He wears jeans, a black polo-neck and, much to 's delight, a   face-mask
As far as 's concerned, this is his old friend, the
throws the bag of money on to the back seat of the convertible and gets in - but he cant find the keys to start it
He frantically searches all his pockets
46 leans into shot
He holds out the keys, grinning
Gimme the keys
runs away with them
Or doesn't
He is in mime mode - And runs on the spot, getting faster and faster
The  approaches this obvious madman
He is quite a tough, scary, and scared individual
said, give me the keys
turns and holds out two hands, just like the  did to him
The perplexed  picks one hand
Wrong one
He then
pulls a gun and puts it hard to   in 's face
Passers-by scream and fall to the ground, the bag lady amongst them
Sudden harsh reality
But not to
He simply takes the gun, and waves it in the 's face, ticking him off for breaking the rules
,  -
gestures the  to turn around
He does, sure this sicko is going simply to shoot him in the head
But instead  puts his back to the 's back, and starts to count 1,2,3,4, 5, 6,7,8, 9,10 He turns and gestures to the  it's time to draw
By this time a crowd has gathered
But  haven't got a f
Ssssh
He points out a small child, watching from behind a trash can
: ~ is hurrying back to the parking lot, with a bag of groceries, and a big bunch of red roses
He stops dead in his tracks as he spots something
47 and  are sitting up on stools, in the window of a coffee shop
laughs at something that  says
Their body language suggests a certain closeness
is saddened
He hurries away
: ~ waves the gun at the
haven't got a gun
But  is pushing him to draw
Finally
Okay, okay, '11 do it
He draws
draws too
They fire
And  really fires
To his amazement
Onlookers scream
throws the gun away in startlement
The  lunges for it ~  kicks it away, trying to help him avoid such a dangerous implement
The  lunges at  who throws the keys away over his shoulder
The has to scrabble under a car for them-  thinks of final joke - and niftly swaps the 's bag, for one of the Old  's bags
few dollar notes spill out of it
When the  emerges with the keys,  's waiting to escort him to his car
He opens the door - then spots a tourist hiding and puts his arm around the  and gets him to take a photograph of them
removes the 's mask as the picture is taken
Forgetting himself, the  smiles for the camera
The , jolted back to reality by the sound of approaching Police car sirens, jumps in the car and drives away
waves goodbye to the convertible as a couple of Police cars screech up
jump out
approaches the scene with groceries and roses
What kind of hell has caused now
But instead of trouble, he sees the passers-by are getting to their feet, applauding  and whistling
They crowd round the explaining what a hero  has been
hands over the gun to a
He doesn't really understand what all the fuss is about
He notices the 48 wandering away with her bags
Should he tell her that he has swapped one of them for the '
No
He's getting too much attention to be bothered
comes up to
It is  1 from the airport scene
1 Excuse me
Mr

Cabbage
Sudden mutual recognition
: - Classic smoked filled room with street light cutting through half closed Venetian blinds
Two or three  slouched in the shadows
, the   huge    black detective from    earlier, sits opposite     at a table, smoking
He    is    looking at a photo
close-up reveals it to be a    full length one of    and    the  outside the    mall with the 's face    unmasked
eyes       for a while
is     terrified
taps the     photo
It's Eddie Guardino
Go pick him up
One of the  lazily leaves the room
leans forward on his elbows
Guardino fled the scene with 160 , in a white plastic bag
We got the car
We got the bag
And we got 20 pairs of stinking pantyhose
(drags on his cigarette) Anything you wanna tell me
looks at h4-m blankly
holds up the photo
'Fraid 'm gonna have to keep this
calmly takes the picture and tears it in half
He gives back the half and puts the other half, with himself on, into his pocket
glares at him
Mr
Bean
You lookin' to stay long in California
49 grins
At last
question he can answer
He nods, happily
Oh, yes
: '
- is talking to
is there
In the background, Jennifer plays with a computer game
is very animated
He was incredible
This guy is fearless
He has no fear
That's one - way of looking at it
You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'
Well, there is that
(  ) '11 give you a chance
Know anything about computers
Ahm
: '
'  - is playing an adventure game: ` 2' [This game exists
] The chuckle and make stupid noises that  can imitate
catchy piece of music accompanies the game
The computer monitor shows the inside of the 's house
moves the , and two little characters,  and , around the room by clicking on areas in the room with his mouse
and  are both wearing pointed goblin hats made from newspaper
50 It's so embarrassing
All the guys  know are on Goblins 3 and 'm still stuck with the lousy Wizard in Goblins 2
is interested in the computer because he likes the cute little
He gets his delighted face right up to the screen
He sings along with the catchy tune
is getting frustrated
Come on, winkle
clicks on a cuckoo clock in the 's room
The cuckoo pops out holding a key in its beak
It's gotta be here
Something to get the key away from the stupid cuckoo
scans the monitor screen: he spots a little frog at the bottom of the scene
His eyes light up
He takes the mouse and rapidly and repeatedly clicks on the frog
Click, click, click, click, click
The frog croaks and jumps off a little round stone
gets excited
How'd you do that
That was so obvious
grins and makes  pick up the stone
Then he clicks through to inside the wizard's house
He makes  throw the stone at the cuckoo which instantly drops the key from its beak
Beanie, you are waaaaay Cool
slaps  on the back
is delighted
Close on monitor, showing The Goblin game- : Another game
' Super Nintendo game on  in the lounge area
It is a Gothic game where he-man types attack Vampires and bats with swords
51 is in the kitchen - setting out the roses in a vase
The door opens - enter
Some tension
Hi, Hi
( ) Roses
Yes
And     have a wine for dinner that will kill you
Great
(     ) You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else
Did you
Sort of half
Meaning
was sort of half way through the sentence in which  would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake
Honestly David, you're so spineless
Pause
Jennifer looks around
She can't help but hear
Not a happy experience
Roses
Wine
He is asking her for softness
Pause
At which moment  enters wearing pointy hat
He helps himself to a melon from a bowl
He grins and exits
looks at  sadly
But no real change
Almost instantly,  is back
He rummages through a drawer and takes out some large elastic bands
And leaves
really do need some time on my own
Away from here
52 Look, Bean's history
swear to you, he's packing as we speak
And you can't leave
(      ) 've got Bambi
You never go anywhere without him
Please let's just talk
Okay
(     ) Put Bambi down, and we'll talk
He puts Bambi down on the side-table, on the flat surface of his  player
appears again behind her, now looking even madder
Pointy hat, large pointy ears made from melon peel, held in place by the rubber band stretched round his face ~ huge front teeth also cut from the melon
He grins gleefully
and  just stare
is followed by  who wears the same ears and teeth
Look, you guys, could you just give us a moment to
Jennifer - could you turn that damn thing down
It is quite loud
looks for the remote control
helpfully picks up a remote control from the sofa and points it across the room
No, that's not for the
That's for the
Too late
punches a button and the lid of the player launches the Bambi into the air
sees it
In slow motion he dives dramatically and just misses it
It smashes on the floor
raises his eyes heavenwards, shakes his head and tuts
He thinks is a real Butter Fingers
, upset, has found the  remote and unintentionally switches from the Vampire game to a  channel
It's very loud
gives  a tearful look, and shakes her head
: taxi drives away
Alison is in it
: -
and  are in their night clothes
They sit with David on the stairs ~ still looking at the door-Alison left through
wish     could use    that at school
"Hey, Teach, no hard feelings
It's    just things between us ain't what they used to be and     need a    little space, ya know
So '11 see you around in    a couple    of years, maybe"
It's a kind of an interesting swap
Mom for the Man from Ga Ga
She gets up and walks away
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it
It's you and Mom that need to talk
Sure
You're right
You know, Mr
Bean's okay
You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad
(  ) Of course he is
Are you
Yes,  am
must
: /'
heads for Mr 's room, and knocks cautiously on the door
54 (o
o
v) Enter
enters - Camera follows as  finds his way through 's washing hanging from strings across the room
is sticking things in a picture album
Hi, am  disturbing you
gives him an affable smile
In a pause before he quite gathers himself to broach the difficult subject,  asks a polite question
May
acquiesces
He starts from the beginning, with pictures of him as a kid
Always standing on his own
Picture of  with mop of frizzy hair, at 16
smiles
mimes stupid disco dancing
turns another page
It is a sequence      of pictures of  at famous locations - Big Ben, Stonehenge, Buckingham     Palace, 10 Downing Street
They are
idiosyncratic because all taken by him     at arms length with his Polaroid - so he never quite makes it squarely into     shot
whole page of Teddy
Then three pages of 's mini with dates, on labels, going way back
Then a whole page of garden gnomes
None of your folks here - Family
starts to look for something in particular
uses the pause to broach the awful subject
Look
the reason  came in here was to
well
since you've been here twelve all
has    found what he was looking for
It is the picture of the family that he    took from the landing on his first night here
What's left of the Polaroid    of himself, from the mall, that he rescued from , is stuck next to    it
He's even written - 'Bean & Family' - he doesn't realise there's anything    sad about it
But  is rather moved
Pause
55 Well, that's er
great
Look,  just came in
(no, he cant do it)
to say good night
Okay
nods
smiles and goes to the door
- waves good-bye a little rudely and gets back to the album
Even when we feel sorry for him, he's a little rude
walks away, shaking his head
Spineless
: '
The first morning without
"She's Gone" by Hall & Oats begins to play, a song full of yearning
feels the other side of the bed
No-one there
He walks into the bathroom and turns on the shower
Then walks back into the bedroom - She's gone - 've got to learn how to face it " He takes a towel from a cupboard and returns to the bathroom
He feels very alone
He removes his pyjamas and gets into the steam-filled shower
- she's gone - she's gone" - but the camera moves to reveal that he is not alone after all
has, simply entered the shower, and is now happily soaping himself, wearing 's shower cap
manly screams from the both of them
: -
sitting down at table, with , who is tucking in happily ~ eating a burger & bun with knife and fork
speaks after a longish pause
Bean can  ask you something
nods
Do you think you can ever really know someone
Even if you've known them, well, almost all your life
What do you think
56 thinks hard, then looks at his watch, makes his excuses and simple walks away
: at a pay phone
He dials carefully- : ' - 10 am
time
(The following takes place in a matter of seconds) Close on the
morning kids show blares out
huge wardrobe stands four feet away from    a wall
There is a string tied to one of it's door handles, stretching    out of shot
The wardrobe seems to be leaning backwards at an angel
It     rocks slightly and creaks
(Feature its padlock)
There is a folded ironing board balanced over a roll of hall carpet, see-saw fashion
One end of it is wedged under the wardrobe
's
phone rings on the table and it's vibrations cause the bust of to fall over the edge of the table
It lands on the end of the ironing board
The Wardrobe groans as it is set off balance and falls against the wall with a heavy thump
and raising of dust
The string tied to its handle becomes taut
: the
plug in its socket
This end of the string is tied to it
The string tightens and the plug is yanked out of the socket
The
screen goes blank
Shot of  in the cardboard hotel'
: returns, sits down and starts to eat again
David is still deep in thought
Well, they say there's only one way to get over this sort of thing
Take it day by day
Keep working
Keep to your normal patterns
That's the only hope
So let's just
take today shall we
57 nods
He is not on David's emotional level here
think the time has come from you to meet the grand Madame
She's all around you
how do you fancy meeting her in the flesh
Sure enough, all around are posters, and the silhouette of Whistler's Mother
nods, though fairly distracted by the slice of gherkin he's found in his bun and now picks out with his fingers
: -
and David en route to the painting
usually only let her out for the big summer exhibition - but' let's see whether what they say about the healing power of great works of art is true, huh
: - and  do the rest of the journey, in quick cuts - along corridors - in an elevator
sense of expectation and excitement
En route, they are joined by , the huge Security Guard
The three arrive outside a large oak door
ceremoniously unlocks the door, all the time glaring at  - who swallows hard
light turns green and a buzzer sounds
Then there is the door to the inner sanctum
stares at  as he unlocks it
Another light turns green and another buzzer sounds
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section
Nobody gets past Elmer here
Isn't that right
Not in one piece anyway
see Mrs Whistler as kind of
like my own dear mother
'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her
The Vice President here will vouch for that
58 You've known me five years Elmer
When do you get to calling me David
Not my place, sir
It would only be a matter of time before 'm calling you Dave
Then where would we be
By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and 'm "Coochie-Coo"
'11 be back in 15
He salutes, glares at  and walks away
and  enters the room
looks warily back at You think he's tough you should see the size of the hunk that works the night shift
: -
The room is very dark, only tiny lights in the corner
Stay there
Keep your eyes closed
One final lock, one final key
unlocks double doors in a wall with a plastic key card
Buzz - click
The camera holds on , his eyes tight shut
The lights go up on 's face, a magical golden glow
Right
Open now
Cut round - and there is this beautiful and very famous painting, lovingly shot
Music
Atmosphere
Glory
opens his eyes and looks at the painting
Mmmmm
Nice
'11 leave you with her for a few minutes
'm sure you'll want to give her a proper inspection
But whatever you do, don't leave the room
Megasecurity, okay
Catch you
nods
leaves him
is still for a while and then goes up and inspects it closely
59 He tuts disapprovingly as he spots dust on the bottom of the frame
He blows it away fussily
He steps back to admire the painting
There is dust up his nose and
- all over the painting
He takes out his handkerchief and wipes the spittle off in panic
Then looks back at the painting
Unfortunately, there now seems to be a big blue mark right across Mrs Whistler's face
checks his handkerchief
Yes, there's wet ink all over it
He finds the leaking pen in his pocket
0 God
He takes out his shirt, spits on it and tries to wipe the painting, but he can't make the shirt reach it
He takes the painting down from the wall and has another go
The ink just spreads right over Whistler's Mother's pure white collar
now looks round in panic
What the hell can he do
He goes to the heavy door    - and looks out into the corridor
He hears someone coming, hides and sees    a young girl from the catering staff wheeling a slightly squeaky trolley past,    covered with a white cloth
He goes back in - and has an idea
He goes to a little table in the corner and begins to take thing off it
: -
The    door opens, and     emerges, pushing what appears to be a trolley covered with    a white cloth
Although, if you look carefully, this trolley actually has    no legs
It is     the painting covered with the table cloth
To make it a bit    more convincing,     makes an apt squeaky noise
He proceeds along the thin corridor - and then sees another exactly similar trolley coming right towards him
'  problem
As they get close, suddenly pretends he sees something astonishing behind the on-coming man
(silently mouths) What the
When    the   man turns,  just twists his painting sideways and shoots past him
We   see the face of the deeply perplexed trolley-pusher when he looks back    and    is no longer there
He turns round to , who turns back to him    with   a totally blank and innocent look
sees an elevator and heads for    it
: 60 - Inside the elevator,  relaxes for a moment
He leans the painting against the wall and presses the third floor button
The bell dings
Second floor
manages to get the painting into trolley position before the doors open to a group of six very fat middle aged people
They all wear large badges declaring them to be members of a 'Diet Club'
They squeeze into the elevator along both sides of 's trolley
There is a very, very,   behind them who can't fit on
guess 'll see you up there, guys
The doors close
As the painting is wedged against the fat people's stomachs on both sides,  is able to let go of it and make a great show of checking his watch
He nonchalantly, drums the fingers of both hands on the top of the trolley'
The bell dings
Third floor
The doors open
flips the painting onto its side and strolls out of the elevator
The 'Diet Cub, members stare, after him
heads on, squeaking - and at last sees what he's looking for
men's room
: '  - enters, relieved
It is small, just a little sink, a towel and a toilet
About a yard wide - but the picture fits in
starts to wash the painting very carefully and lo
The ink starts to come off
Massive relief
Then, alas, someone tries the handle of the door
speeds up
knock
He peers out the keyhole
There are now 4 people waiting
is very worried
: 61 -
'  - Pause
Then out comes , drying his empty hands, miming, "Sorry, Sorry
"
We see into the toilet
nothing there
No sign of the painting
turns sharply left
: - is talking to  in the grounds
We can see the side of the whole gallery in shot as they talk
was hoping
Bean might take a look at my computer project today
Yes
'11 mention it to him
But
he's kind of his own guy, you know
Howls he getting on with the family
Ah
Fine
It's good
It's great
We will be slightly distracted by      the observation that Whistler's Mother, America's most valuable painting,      is at this moment balanced on a very thin ledge three floors up - where Bean      has put in, outside the Men's room window
bird and then a couple       more birds perch on it
And howls Alison
She's
well, she's good
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers
Nice guy
Good looking
Yes, isn't he
It's great when people who work together can become real friends
Isn't it
62 like to think that's what's happened with you and me
even though you're kinda my boss
Still maybe it won't always be that way, huh
doesn't quite see what  is getting at but smiles politely
Now we see 's plan -    he has emerged at a nearby window
He    can't reach the painting at first
So he stretches further and further out   the window
No good
Finally he has     to go out on the ledge
He shoos away    the birds, who then decide to settle on    him instead
Finally he gets a hand on    the painting
As he does so, he loses    hold
He just manages to grabs a window    before he falls
Look, 've left Bean on his own
Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy
Thanks, David
Always a pleasure
Period
is slowly managing to claw his way back towards the open window with the painting
It is an extraordinary piece of acrobatics
turns to go
By the way
Don't     know what you think, Mr Vice President, but 've been hinting    to the old man that someone's got to have the balls to take some    sort of emergency measures around here - or we're all in the crap house
What     do you think
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right
Not necessarily
That's where this
(     ) comes in
No, 've had a better idea than sacking people
You'll hear soon enough
grins and walks away
Bean does one final swing, and
: 63 -
small storeroom where Bean's wriggling bottom is just coming back through the window
He has the picture and is safe
He sets the picture down on a table
Darn
The birds have done their business on it
He maniacally rummages through various dusty cans and bottles on a shelf
He chooses a can, too rusty to read its label, takes off the lid and sniffs
This smells like the right sort of stuff
He pours the liquid on to a rag and rubs it on the face of Mrs
Whistler
The solvent effortlessly removes the ink stain
Whistler's Mother looks as good as new
is so, so, relieved
But then he notices something else happening
The liquid did not stop with removing the stain
It is now busy removing Whistler's Mother's face entirely
As Bean watches-in frozen horror, America's most famous painting turns back to a blank canvas
thinks for a second - and then has a desperate thought
Removing the pen that started all the trouble, he decides to try to draw back    on Whistler's Mother's 'face
He doesn't have much time
It shows
Where       once was a sublime oil painting, is now a biro line-drawing which looks    a little like Danny de Vito
Bean lifts it against the wall to check how it's worked
Unfortunately, there's a nail there
The picture tears, Bean panics - it tears even more
Total destruction
: -
Hurries down the corridor with his pseudo-trolley again, and a vaguely mad look on his face
He spots  at a drinks machine
She smiles sweetly (here comes her man)  takes a sharp left into an adjacent corridor is hurt
True love can be very hard
: - Close on the double doors (identical to those of the Whistler Room) enters with the Painting, under the 64 cloth
He closes the doors and rests a moment to catch his breath
He takes a step into the room and freezes
The    very fat 'Diet Club, people are seated at easels, paint brushes poised
The    very   is standing in the centre of the room in her underwear with    a Greek urn perched on her shoulder
All eyes are on , who exits very    quickly
: gets back to the right rooms and closes the door desperately behind him
He stands frozen for a second - and at that moment, a hand tries the door
leaps at it and stops
the handle turning
Then there's a knock moves the big table in front of the door - he's barricading himself in
There's a famous Rodin sculpture in there - he shoves it along to block, the door as well
When he's succeeded, he leans hot and sweaty against it - and a door on the other side of the room calmly opens and
walks in
Seems to be a problem with the door
() Where's the picture gone
Ahm
What
What
Pause
Pause
finally shows it
Not a pretty sight
Oh Jesus
Oh God
Oh Jesus God
Oh Mary Mother of Jesus
Oh Jesus of Nazareth
oh dear
What happened
Ahm
(setting himself up for an interesting, comprehensive answer)
65 Don't bother (panicking) Oh my god
He rushes to the door he just came in - and locks it
Wait a minute - why am  worrying about this
did it
just go out and tell them what happened - you're a madman from England and you did this terrible thing and it's not my fault
That's right, isn't it
nods, knowing he deserves his doom
Perfect - and then they say - who left him alone with the picture
" And  say - "me"
And they say "you're fired"
And say ' right'
And so  get fired and you go to jail and no one's any happier
shakes his head
And then they say, "firing David isn't enough - let's prosecute him for negligence
And they prosecute me and it turns out  was negligent and  go to jail, and my wife leaves me and my daughter becomes a prostitute and  end up on Death Row sharing a cell with Butch McDick, the infamous gay rapist - or worse,  end up in the same cell as you
looks hurt
No, no
Now, let's just be calm let's think about this calmly
(he tries - and fails
) Oh Godigodigod
Okay, now wait
Let's have another look at it
shows it to him
Jesus
'm already thinking back to 5 minutes ago as paradise
5 minutes ago - just walking along, shooting the breeze with my old pal Bernie
then he has a brilliant idea
He hangs the painting back up in the security cupboard and closes the doors
Then he removes from his pocket a small note book
66 He scribbles something on it, tears the page out, licks it and sticks it on the cupboard door
It reads `  '
Brilliant
Brilliant
Problem solved
is delighted
Apart from the tiny drawback that the first person who opens the cupboard will say -"Look, someone's totally destroyed Whistler's Mother- let's kill them"
is less delighted
No - the most important thing is tbat no-one sees it
Ever again
He locks the cupboard with his plastic card key- That's the first thing
Then
that's the first thing
Next
next is the next thing which is
obviously
ritual suicide
Look, let's get out of here
Try to act natural
The let themselves out and go into the corridor-  acting his version of `natural' - very liquid
: - They bump straight into  and
Ah, David
Showing Dr
Bean our good lady
Actually 'm not a
That's right - Whistler's Mother
Looking at his mother - not his father - not interested in his father, Couldn't give a flying doughnut for his sisters or brothers - just his mother
Yes
Well, good - think  may go and look at her myself
67 No
Er
pray tell me why
Because they've just cut her into tiny pieces, sir
That's why
and  die and go to hell until  laughs at his own little joke
laughs too
better continue my rounds, sir
He strolls away
The thing is, sir, 've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh
Exactly
She's in a surprisingly terrible state
Isn't she, Bean
Oh yes
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints
hudders at the thought of his paint-choosing
The colours are beginning to fade
However ~     if you give me just one little year  can restore the picture to its original    glory, the way it looked when Whistler's Mom first looked at it and said
0 Actually 'm not sure you've got the hair right, darling
" By the way, your    hair is looking great today, sir
68 Thank you David
However, flattery will get you nowhere
Truth is,  have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama
Bernie and  have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so
you have to sack me
understand, sir
'll go quietly
In fact 'll go right now
No
no, no, hold on
We cant sustain our loses - so 've decided
to sell Whistler's Mother
lets out a little yelp
Brilliant, huh
already have a prospective       buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies      in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal
Spread the       news
think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't      you
Yes, sir
Yes, sir
Congratulations
Marvellous thing
Bravo
leaves
turns to
Bean
Do you drink
shakes his head
Neither do
: - It is very late and very gloomy
Just a couple of loners staring into their drinks
The  is up one end of the counter, smoking and reading the sports pages
There is a
on above the bar, showing baseball
69 and  are sitting up at the bar
The latter has had far too much whisky and looks the worse for it
has a tall glass packed with fruit and paper umbrellas
We can guess how much he's had to drink by the way he has difficulty finding the straw with his mouth
almost, but not quite, slurs his words: It's just a matter of acceptance, isn't it
lose your job - lose you wife
'est la vie
You ever been married, Bean
He turns to  who has the end of a straw up his nose
guess not
He fills his glass from a bottle
You know,  don't get it
The New Artist     exhibition-this year - people might not all have liked the dead    sheep, but
the place didn't look that empty to me
It wasn't     full but  saw people just don't understand how the gallery can    be so bankrupt they have to sell the Whistler
He looks at  who now has peanuts in each nostril
notices the  looking at  strangely
He's English, okay
You wanna make something of it
goes back to reading
searches for his last train of thought, taking a huge swig from his drink
To hell with the figures
'm not a damn accountant
'm an artist
You know, me and Ali met in art school
cut quite a figure then
Far cry from the man you see before you now
Then, smoked Gitanes before  went to bed, to help me sort out the problems of the world
Now,  take a spoonful of laxative before go to bed to help me sort out the problem with my bowels
70 at that moment is keen to show  his nut trick
He throws a peanut high into the air - and catches it in his mouth
Then does two
Then does it with his eyes closed
Actually, it's rather impressive
Truth is,  disappointed her
turned out to have no spine
Spineless
kind of medical miracle
Mr Flippy-Floppy just don't seem to be able to fight - cant stick up for myself
Too nice
mean,  should never have let you come stay and should be handing you over to the police right now
Shall tell you something, Beanie
Bean has been interested all this, even looking to    check whether David does indeed have no spine
But now the baseball on the      is making it hard for him to concentrate on-this important confidence
He raises a finger, for to be quiet for a second
He blows a peanut     from his, nostril at the - it hits the button, and changes station to    a pleasant quiet-music station
Do you want to know what the reality of the situation is
nods his head, very curious, listening hard
This is it
Because you moved into my house, my wife has left me
She might have done it anyway - but you were the ten ton weight that broke the camel's spinal column
stares at  - something is getting in he's actually registering this
That's point one
And point two - is that you've destroyed Whistler's Mother, which was' the last hope for the place where work
So within a week, 'm going to lose my job as well
nods, seriously dispirited
71 So, you've totally and utterly destroyed my life
Do you understand
You've put me in a position where it would have been better if 'd never been born
He puts his hand on ' shoulder
looks down
Very sad
This is actually the first time in his life that he's realised that his actions have really effected the life of another person
looks up sadly
Sad music plays
: '  - is asleep in bed
The camera moves out into the hall and into 's room
' -
is lying, fully dressed, in the darkness, on his back
Thinking
Worried by what he's heard
Then suddenly an idea comes into his eyes
The music is like his brain He jumps off the bed
There follows a version of the classic tooling up for action sequence
But the 'tools' here are distinctly bizarre
picks up his suitcase, and in quick cuts, rushes through the house and collects
' - '
6 ' 4
Fully tooled, he snaps the suitcase shut
: 72 The building is floodlit by ground spots
arrives silently, with suitcase, on the skateboard
Soon his full plan will be revealed
The Gallery is empty, apart from the one Security Guard, , visible through the glass front of the building, drinking coffee, watching his 12 security monitors
swallows at the sight of  - he is a massive gorilla of a man
: -
is casually watching his screens, when suddenly, horror of horror, the huge silhouette of a person hanging
themselves from a tree outside appears, the shadow of the limp body thrown across the floodlit gallery wall frantically rushes out
And  subtly slips in
: -
is looking for the body amongst the trees
He finds nothing
Because he fails to notice the tiny   swinging gently in front of one of the ground-level floodlights
: - '
Inside,  is casually pouring the entire       contents of 's large laxative tin into 's coffee
He also swaps two        keys on the board of keys by the desk
He then takes the opportunity to put        the oven gloves on his feet, one shaped like a pig, one like a crocodile, so       he can move silently
returns
He sits down, and takes a long gulp of coffee
Pause watches
feels something uncomfortable in his stomach
He takes a key from his rack of keys, and sets off and rounds a corner- On a monitor screen, watches him break into a canter - as he passes through another monitor is at full sprint
giggles
is satisfied he'll be uninterrupted for a while
He goes to the key- rack, borrows two keys, and sets off on his mission
The next 3 minutes of film are a sequence of cuts between three scenarios: 73 :  - his next 10    minutes    are not happy ones
When he reaches the toilet, the key he chose    does not    unlock it
He has to sprint back, grab all the keys, and charge back    again to    the door
Then he has to try out every single key
We never see     him find    the right one
scenario - all the    activities of the night shown on the security monitors
sprinting     desperately through shot -  casually going about his business and, on one    occasion,  running right past , but not seeing him - he has other    things on his mind
scenario - we actually see 's Big Plan
He unlocks the merchandise shop
So he can see properly and have his hands free, he puts the y-fronts on his head, and wedges the torch into them, like a head-lamp
He then takes a poster of Whistler's Mother and replaces it with the rolled-up Tennis Ball Girl
He unrolls the Whistler and places the 4 encyclopaedias on its corners to hold it down
He separates the yokes from the eggs, mixes the whites with clear nail varnish and varnishes the-poster with it
Dries it off with the hair drier
,With the now stiff poster, he heads up elevators and escalators to get to the Whistler Room itself, all the time chewing gum frantically
Once there, he unlocks the final cupboard with David's plastic key, takes the Whistler down and removes the destroyed Mother from its gilded frame, and its wooden support frame
He uses the chewed gum to stick the new one down to the old frame
He then puts the very convincing forgery back into the security cupboard and relocks it with 's key card
The job is done
He scrunches up the old, torn picture, pops it in a dustbin, and heads off
: - zipping along on the skate board with his suitcase
: -
, trouserless, is sitting, reading a newspaper next to a noisy washing machine
: 74 '
- lies back in bed with quiet satisfaction
: '
wakes with a violent start
0 my God
Tell it vas a dream
The door swings open
It is Bean with a tray of coffee and toast
Morning
It wasn't a dream, was it
have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito
Well, Ahm
He laughs cheerily
What
: '
Bean is still chuckling
: Still highly amused,       guides  in the direction of Whistler's Room
David takes out his key to      open the room - but the door swings open is shocked
There stands       , looking straight at Whistler's Mum
In all its untorn, unsmudged,      undestroyed glory
75 think you're wrong, David
She looks as fine as she's ever looked
Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s
Ahm
Bravo
Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we
Don't want anything to go wrong
Quite right, sir
Grierson leaves
David gets close to the painting and peers
Wait a minute
just puts his finger to his mouth
Ssshhhh
He lets out a hug smile - he can solve the problems of the world, as well as create them
- skips down t-he stairs, carrying a trendy duffel bag, just as enters from the kitchen
Bye, Dad
Ah
Jennifer,  need you to watch Kevin
Jen
But  has already reached the front door
Be serious, Dad
It's Saturday
She exits
: 76 - is heading down the path
runs out of the house and catches up with her
Jen, you have to help me here
've got to go in to work, and with your mom away
really need you
powerful motorbike turns into the drive at speed and skids round to face the opposite direction
runs over to it
The bike's rider turns off his engine and removes his helmet
It is , the white Rasta from the airport, with the hair extensions and the sixty rings in his nose
(to ) You
He hands  a helmet
Don't worry, Dad
'll be home
Monday, after school
and  arrive at 's side to spectre
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver
(angry now) Jennifer
This is not - repeat, not
how we do things in this family
've told you never to get on one of those death traps
Please - talk to me
promise to be reasonable
has put on the helmet and is climbing onto the back of the bike
Great, Dad
You promised you'd get rid of him
(points at Bean) And as for: "how we do things in this family
We don't have a family till you get Mom back
77 She slaps  on the shoulder
kicks the starter lever
Nothing
Again
Nothing
Come on Sting
Sting
Sounds like something you put on a rash
is still kicking the starter
is desperate
Don't just stand there, Bean - do something
instantly takes on the hero's mantle and runs to the bike
is not far behind him
is still trying to kick start it
takes out a small screwdriver and twiddles with something on the engine
The bike sparks into life and does a wheelie before speeding out of the drive and down the road
stands, hands on hips, looking very-pleased with himself indeed
To  )    Right
Right
You get inside and look after Kevin
(not such    a good idea) Uh --- Right
Kevin
You get inside and look after
uh
(that would be a worse idea) Right
Get in the car
Both of you
Jesus
: - ,  and  at the reception desk
So, Kevin
How's it going
Badly
You wanna adopt me
smiles cutely at
is still rattled
Big day today, huh
78 Uh
yes
looks askance at
hurries up and takes  to one side
Great day
At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future
Yes, look,  wanted to talk to you about this
'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that
You're an innocent and an optimist David - that's why  love you
(he hugs him and laughs)
Jesus - what a terrible tie- Come on, the Governor's coming at 3
And before then  have a little surprise for you and the Boss
calls to
Annie
would you look after Kevin
And Kevin - you look after Bean
He heads off with
Back at the counter
,  &
My Dad told me all about you
Did he now
He says you've got a babe count of ten out of ten, and a brain cell count of about two and a half
Yeah, 'll go with that
'm kinda, like, dumb, intellectually
(to Bean) But 'm great in bed
is unsettled by this
He gives a shudder and heads for the gallery
79 Catch you later, babe
(goes after Bean) Come on, Beanie - there must be a computer here somewhere
hate paintings
They don't do anything
: '
,  and
looks very confident at a computer monitor
painting is in fact 'doing' something, on the computer screen, as the girls in a Toulouse-Lautrec painting actually dance the can-can
Well, congratulations
Isn't that great, David
Certainly is
We'll be able to start this afternoon
'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery
Now, that'll impress the Governor
Well, bravo
What with you and Whistler's Ma -  think 've got a winning team
slightly embarrassed not to be included in the winning team
He looks to the poster of Whistler's Mother behind 's desk
: '  - and  have found a computer,    also showing 's Gallery programme
The monitor shows the interior of the    ground floor of the gallery clicks, and up comes the same Toulouse    Lautrec picture
As  works the mouse,  hums the catchy tune from    ' 21
It's play time again
This is way cool, Beanie
He clicks again, and a tiny talking Toulouse Lautrec starts to explain the provenance of the painting
80 : is overseeing things
There's a burgundy rope, keeping people a bit away from the case in which Whistler's Mother is contained
brings in two large flower displays
enters
Jesus
Hurry up you guys
Am  the only person round here who actually gets things done
He exits
is growing in confidence - and getting nastier by the minute
pulls a face at
You arrange those flowers yourself
Sure did
They're pretty
Learn it in the army
No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life
: - The final touches in the preparation for the big visit to up-tempo, "we're getting ready" music
1
Gardeners gardening, window cleaners cleaning, polishers polishing etc
And someone empties a dustbin, in the midst of which we glimpse something which might be a scrunched up old Whistler painting
2
watches as someone plugs in a plug - and a huge video screen in the gallery flickers and starts up
3
at her counter, reading a book called 'The Art of Conversational
She shakes an imaginary hand and rehearses a keen conversation with an imaginary
81 4
, in the men's room mirror, trims his hair around his peaked hat with scissors
He has a row of war medals on his chest
He polishes them proudly with his sleeve
5
watches through the front glass - a red carpet rolls itself out from the gallery's main entrance to stop by the rear door of a black car
: - Close on the bottom    of the black cars rear door
It opens and a pair of legs, wearing black shoes    and charcoal trousers, step out onto the red carpet
As they walk purposely    up the carpet, the camera pans up their owner's body, to reveal that this is
It's a rehearsal
He is met with a hand shake by at the main    entrance
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds
'd like you to meet some of our staff here
(checks a prompt card)
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor
Right
Got it
: - Gallery staff wait, all wearing name badges
leads  to the reception counter
steps out from behind it and shakes 's hand
Good day, Governor Reynolds
'm Annie
Curtsy
Curtsy
Are you kidding
This is 1990s America
Women don't curtsy, they run the damn country
82 Alex, please
That's Annie, sir
takes  on to  who is next in line
This is Elmer, our longest serving
Hey
Let's junk the medals, Elmer
This is not a Veterans' reunion
We wanna make the Governor feel at home
Not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms
puts on a defiant face
shakes his head disapprovingly moves  to meet
They 'Shake hands
David Leary
'd like to echo my colleagues welcome to you and thank you for your patronage
rudely cuts him off
Okay, that'll do
The Governor's here in half an hour
We have to be totally ready then
No excuses
Period
Thank you Bernie
Well done
Now, If you'll excuse -  have a little smartening up to do myself
: '  - at the computer
He's actually quite enjoying himself now
In fact, he's rather hogging the thing
This is, after all, an animated catalogue - his area
83 'm just gonna go see if Annie needs me for anything
Truth is, she smells kinda nice
okay
(grins)
smiles and gives  a thumbs-up
returns the gesture and exits
Back to the computer,  clicks on an icon which takes him to the ground floor gallery
He clicks through various paintings and stops at the painting of the woman, in the castle, wearing the chastity belt
clicks and enlarges the painting to fill the screen
He happily hums the catchy tune from ' 2' and homes in on the tiny padlock on the chastity belt
Padlocks interest him
He clicks on the keyhole rapidly (as we have seen him do with the frog in  2)
Click
click
click
click
click
Suddenly, to 's surprise, the padlock starts to flash red
then the whole screen starts to flash
before going dramatically back to black
Now flashing in the
centre of the monitor is an icon of a tiny key
Beneath it, a row of six dashes appears (e
g - - - - - - - )
cursor is flashing over the first dash
is totally absorbed
He loves these kinds of puzzles
With one finger, he slowly types out letters on the keyboard (he has to search for some of them)
As he does so, they appear over each dash in turn: ----- message pops up: " "  tries something 0 else
----- The message again: ` '
The room door suddenly opens
Making jump
It's
He cannot see the computer screen from the doorway
How goes it, Bean
Ready for the Governor
smiles and nods nervously
He knows he's probably up to something he shouldn't be
84 We need you downstairs in ten minutes and not a second more
Period
Oh, And put this on
throws  a name badge with 'Dr
Bean' on it
nods exits
goes back to the code
He types in the first thing that comes into his head: ----- That damned message again: ` '
Then, as though something is dawning on him, he punches in: ----0- Up comes a message: " "
Close on 's face as light from the computer plays on it- He reads it carefully and with interest
We cant quite read his expression - but what he sees is a surprise and a puzzle
Long meaningful pause as his eyes scan the screen
: - enters -  is looking at Whistler's Mother, still puzzled
David
Lift off
: - The staff and various dignitaries are lined, looking out through the glass in anticipation
Through the glass we see a couple of Police Motorcycle Escorts pull up outside followed by a beautiful, old, classic Rolls Royce
: - The red carpet unrolls all the way to the Rolls, rear door
Close on the bottom of the driver's door
It opens and out step a pair of legs, wearing army boots and khaki trousers
85 The legs step sideways onto the carpet and approach us
Camera pans up to show us that   is dressed in his Veteran's uniform - chest of medals and forage cap
He is a grand figure
In fact - he's exactly the same grand figure Mr  caused epic problems To on the plane over
He gives his prized possession, the car, a little token polish with his sleeve before heading on
and his -  fall into step behind him
They are the Police presence today
and  greet  at the entrance
is wearing a striking brand new light blue silk suit
is frowning - not happy about that uniform
what a pleasure, Governor
Welcome
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint
Going on To my regiment/s reunion after
Not at all, Governor
Very striking
takes in 's suit
Interesting suit
(Beaming) Why thank you sir
off the peg
(crestfallen ) Yes it is
may  introduce you To Bern
He gestures to  but  cuts in and hands  a set of car keys
(To Bernie) Go park the old jalopy, will ya, son
's smile melts away
As they enter the gallery,  hopefully offers the car keys to  - who rewards him with a "don't be stupid" smile and follows the Governor
86 (wearing "Dr Bean" name badge) comes into the corridor by the front door, thus just missing
sees him and jumps on the chance to delegate
Bean - go park the Governor's car, will you
assents happily
spies  over his shoulder and frowns - its that mad English guy again
gets to the door and sees the Governor's car
Yummy
: - leads  to the reception counter, as  sneaks up to take his position again
is in the background trying to look professional, deferring to
steps out from behind the counter, curtsies and ,shakes ' hand
Good day, Governor
'm Annie
You know, you're a lot taller than you were half an hour ago
Well, that's great to hear at my age, Annie
Thank you very much
Governor Reynolds, does your wife, like, have to curtsy
Or does she 0 have a decent job
Er
Mrs
Reynolds is doing just fine
Just fine
He spots  and winks at him
smiles back
: has let himself into the car
It's one of the happiest moments of his life, as he inspects the gleaming panel and sits back in the gorgeous leather seat
87 He starts the car up - and heads up into the circular car park
He sweeps dangerously round a few turns - but just manages to keep the car in tact
Finally he reaches the top floor where there is one quite small space left
is a good driver in a car that is, unfortunately, one foot wider than the one he's used to
He takes out the comb he always used to measure space with his Mini, and measures the space
Yes
Seems large enough
He moves the car in
It isn't large enough
With a hideous scraping of metal against metal, the Rolls Royce squeezes in between the two cars, losing its wing mirror and door handle in the process
looks a tadge concerned
: -
has moved on to  who salutes crisply
returns the salute with pride
Nice set of medals there Elmer
Which beach they drop you on
Utah
Omaha
Couldn't tell you sir
was so drugged up with the killing didn't know where  was
Well, congratulations soldier
: -
sitting in the wedged car
He tries       the door - but it won't open a centimetre
He's totally stuck
He looks        up at a small window in the roof
If only he could get that open
He pushes      various buttons, which set of windscreen wipers, squirters, radios
He       pushes the cigarette lighter
Finally, he pulls a lever - and the bonnet      pops up an inch
At which moment we see the lighter shoot out, and on to the seat
is still looking round below the dashboard, when he notices a little fire in the seat beside him
Not good news
88 panics a bit, turns and half      climbs over into    the back   seat, when he spies a drinks cabinet
He has a       very good idea -    he finds   a cut crystal decanter of brown liquid, opens it      and uses it to    douse the   fire
Not a wise move with brandy
Before the       cut, we see the
of a major fire in the front seat of the car
: leads  towards the main gallery
He points up to the video screen they are passing, which shows the two of them walking along - as does every screen in the gallery
is impressed
He glances at  in passing
Nice tie, fella
grins to himself
: -
The front of the car isn't    what it was
There has been a big fire
It's out now - three decanters lie    empty
is not happy
Finally, he decides to go for brute strength
He     turns the car on again, puts it into reverse, and puts his foot down on the    accelerator
We see the car from above
Full throttle
Totally still
Totally still
And then
It reverses at 100 mph straight backwards, smashing violently into and destroying the back of the car behind _ as it happens, Bernie's car
- stops to admire a small painting - a twelfth century 'Crucifixion of Christ'
Ah, one of my favourites
It expresses a universal agony that the established Church so rarely acknowledges, don't you think
89 Jesus
no one's got feet like for crying out loud
Have you got feet like that
Dammed if  have
Let's move it, shall we
spots a slightly concerned
Everything okay, David
Yes
Ahm
was just wondering where my English house guest had got to
He's just parking the Governor's car
Great - keep him out of trouble
: -
is inspecting the car
He's not too happy with it
'
He tries to get the bonnet down, but it insists on staying up
He shrugs his shoulders and gets in to drive off again, having to wind down the window and drive by leaning his head out
This means that as he heads for the exit, he fails to see the system to stop people leaving without paying, a foot high barrier that appears out of the ground
When he hits it, the car stops dead
gets out,    leaving the car idling and goes to the booth where normally the attendant would    be - but everyone is in the gallery at the moment
Inside he pushes a couple    of buttons, and, hurrah, gets the one that drops the barrier
Less hurrah, he    has forgotten to put on the hand brake
As he moves    back towards the car, it glides slowly down the ramp on the outside of    the building, then accelerates, and finally, on a particularly sharp turn,    smashes through the wall, and flies off the building
We hear a crash - but    do not see where it lands
: - turns away from another picture
90 Can we go and see Mrs
Whistler now
My eyes are making my feet sore, as my wife would say
Sure, Governor
Please
This way
The party follows  as he walks through the gallery, towards the double doors, to take the lift to the Whistler Room
An excited atmosphere
: Everyone enters
Ladies and gentlemen - most of you have seen Whistler's Mother before, can  ask you just to step back
Thank you
It's part of his plan of caution - he knows there's something wrong - and wants as few people as possible to
see the painting close up
The crowd moves back
'd like the Governor to have, as it were, a private audience with his new friend
is flattered
Silence
inserts the plastic card key - opens the doors - and sure enough there in all its glory is Whistler's Mother'
Respectful silence
is delighted
He stands back to inspect her
Well, hello Ma'am
Yes - she certainly looks a million dollars to me - or should  say ten million dollars
Everyone applauds
Bravo - what do you say to a final glass of, though  say it myself, rather 'expensive' champagne
(grins smugly) 91 People start to file out
, ,  and  stay behind
spots  arriving
He hands the car keys back to  with a slightly dazed smile
eagerly takes his arm and brings him over
Governor,  don't believe you've met Dr Bean, our expert from England
They turn to each other - recognition from  "it's the man from the plane"
He does a very quick hand-shake and tries to make a getaway before recognises him
Ah, hello, sorry,
Ahm
sorry
turns
In fatal slow motion he trips over the cord that stops anyone getting too close to the great painting
He spins and falls in the direction of the painting
: the looks of horror on all the faces
: , reaching out to keep himself standing
We think he's going to tear the painting
He doesn't
He simply catches hold of the bottom of the ornate frame
It ,,snaps off
: a look of relief for an instant on all faces
: the truth - as the frame breaks off, there is the little white strip, saying,   ,   ' "- : a look of horror on all faces
:  looking like someone has just murdered his own mother
:  and - glowering at
: Governor  storming through the Gallery, with - and scampering after him
You were going to sell the State of California a poster - for ten million dollars
Who the hell do you think you are, Shorty
92 Look, Governor - just wait - it's may not be as bad as it looks : -
and  stand alone in silence, in front of the debris
is absolutely destitute
stares at him
just lifts his hands
Totally sad
What will, what can  say to him
Finally,  just puts his hands on his shoulder
Nice try, kiddo
cant quite believe he's forgiven
At which moment, there is a knock on the door
enters, holding 's hand
David
There's a call for you
It's your wife
Great
Classic timing
Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce
'll check my diary later
Then he notices the worried expressions on  and 's faces
She's calling from the hospital
and  both take this in
turns and runs towards the reception area
calls after him
She's on line three
grabs 's hand and they both run after
watches  go and sighs
Such
great buns
: 93 The party is in disarray
In the background,  is on the phone at the reception counter with  and
hovers, he suspects  - wants to question him
've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two
Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen
'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys
am sorry you feel that way
And 'm sorry you look that way, short-ass
That suit stinks and you obviously dye your hair
is seriously shocked and offended
Now, bring my car round the front please - 've had enough of this crap
Certainly, sir
He rushes off
Meanwhile,  slams down the phone and he,  and rush out of the building
,  and - give chase
: 's car screeches out onto the street and tears away
and - arrive, flustered, at their car
- is frantically searching for its keys
Come on man
Move it
car passes by them slowly
is driving
He shouts from his window
94 Hey, Cop, wanna ride
Jeese, where do they get you guys
The cops jump in his car while it is still moving
: - at the entrance
walks up sheepishly, holding up car keys
There is one other tiny problem, sir
: 's car speeds by
's car is not far behind it
: '  - is driving fast
Is Jenny gonna be okay
She was wearing a helmet
It could have been worse
But is she gonna be okay
(snapping) How the hell should  know
is hurt
'm sorry
What can  say - she's unconscious
And  mean - every night when we sleep, we're all unconscious, aren't we
She'll pull out of it
God though - why the hell do kids have to ride bikes
slams on the brakes
He nearly went through a red light
95 Damn
She's a good kid
Sometimes good people get a break once in a while
(manages a smile) chauffeur driven, open top limo, pulls up next to 's car
looks out of his window to see the  , from the mall robbery, sitting in the back
She is still wearing her filthy clothes
She raises a glass of champagne to  and smiles
waves back uncertainly
He's sure he's seen her before - a vague memory
: 's  is in the traffic queue about ten cars back
and - get out and start running down the line towards 's car
The lights are green
puts his foot down and the car screeches away just as  and - are within inches it
:  and - turn on their heels and head back to 's car
They are very unfit
They are just about to jump in the car when gun shots are heard from a near-by gas station-  turns and sees a
robbery in progress
man with a gun is about to run away
is torn, not knowing which quarry to pursue
Shiiiit
It's okay
'll tail 'em
You got it
and - draw their guns and run towards the gas station
In a moment of confusion - a shot rings out
We think in the corner of our eye that we see  fall to the ground, as  screeches away after 's car
: - Much hustle and bustle
is getting directions from a nurse at the desk
He beckons to  and  and strides, purposely towards a corridor
They hurry to catch him up, and Bean treat on the back of his shoe
turns and shouts at him
96 Just stay away from me
'you hear
He takes 's hand and storms away round a corner
is taken aback not knowing what to do or where to go
He is really feeling sorrow now
He's shaken
All part of his slow coming to feel things properly
: - and  turns a corner - and stop, frozen
There, sitting alone, on a bench, outside 's room, is
She gets to her feet
Their eyes meet
: - crowd outside the gallery, look off camera
The camera follows 's gaze and takes in the modern car sculpture
Where there were two cars face down in the earth, there are now three, the new addition being Governor's pride and Joy
The three cars form a tall pyramid
Close on ' face
approaches
Don't even think of saying one word to me, or '11 find a way of fitting all three of those cars right up your ass
nods - he's got the message
: and  are standing where they were before, three paces apart
is upset, tired and drawn
They're not calling it a coma
The doctor says she's
just kind of taking time out
(to Kevin) Hi, tough guy
(to David) It's a busy night
The doctor will be back in a while
doctor passes 97 Excuse me
1 'll be back in a minute
Okay, great
looks at him
We don't quite read the expression but somewhere under there we know she's thinking "yup, he's still ineffective
" At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you
Ah, well
: - is looking for his friends
doctor sweeps by him
nurse behind
Doctor Jacobson
Yes
We need you urgently in  Theatre
Damn
was just going to Number 4
It is urgent, sir
Okay
The doctor rushes away and drops his stethoscope as he
goes
sees it, picks it up and follows him he's trying to be useful
: 98 - is at the busy reception desk and has been talking with a nurse
No, no,  didn't realise the situation
won't disturb them now
is obviously moved to find out about
He moves towards the exit
He is surprised to see , the night-shift guard, dressed in civvies, sitting with outpatients
Buck
looks up, painfully, goes to say something, then dashes into a men's room close-by
shakes his head and leaves
: -
still following  , who goes through more swing doors and then suddenly disappears
sees a big "4" above a door and goes in, holding the Stethoscope
nurse accosts him instantly
She reads his name badge
2 Doctor
Bean
is fed up trying to correct people with this misconception
Actually
(huge sigh)
Yes, yes, yes
2 Just in time, sir
Allow me
She immediately slips the white coat onto , and the gloves, and the mask
- ,  and  are sitting on the bench opposite 's room
picks up 's   console from the bench notices this
answers his look
99 When the Police told me what had happened
it's stupid  know but  remembered all that stuff people do to get through to coma victims
Like playing them recordings of their dish washers and coffee grinders
That right
So  went home and picked it up
Good thinking
(pause) You still call it 'home'
looks at him seriously
Inside the operating theatre, a body is waiting in position
There are 3 attending nurses and an assistant doctor
They all look up to  as he enters, fully kitted up
Good evening Doctor
What we have here is a bullet wound in the lower thorax it seems to have ruptured the lung, and there's severe inner bleeding along the abdomen
2 He's coming round
Give him a  70, straight away
The victim starts to move - he looks up - we see his face for the first time
It is the police officer,
He is in great pain
As the sedative shot goes in,  takes off his mask, and smiles, with a little wave
look of total panic goes over ' eyes, as he loses consciousness
Shall  do the cut, sir
nods - he's not going to argue with anyone
The assistant cuts
is horrified, almost faints, then snatches the knife
He can't believe this maniac has just cut through another personas flesh
100 'm sorry
it's only  first week
hands the knife to the  testily
'm afraid we'll now have to wait for the -rays, Doctor, or we'll never find the bullet
Come on everyone sort out the support systems
turns to get on    with their particular jobs
is left with the body
pause
He gets      a little bored
Takes a sweet packet out of his pocket
Only one sweet     left
he takes it out lovingly, and then does what he always does - throws it    up into the air, to catch it in his mouth
Unfortunately, he forgets that he is wearing a mask
It hits the middle of the mask and bounces into the cut in the body
looks down annoyed
Checks round him - everyone's 'still busy
So he puts his hand in the body, really rummages around, finds the sweet, takes it out, and then realises he's in fact got the bullet between his fingers
Guiltily, he slips it back into the body, rummages a bit more, finds the sweet, wipes it, & pops it in his mouth
At which second the -ray arrives
Here we go, doctor
(   - ) the bullet is here - so we'll probably have to extend the cut to here
Think we all better be prepared for a long one here
This is tricky
tuts scornfully - 'you're wrong 1, reaches in again, feels around for a second, and triumphantly produces the bullet between his fingers
They all applaud
: -
exits from the theatre - still in gown and mask, followed by the assistant
The police - is waiting
- Any news on the chief
101 There certainly is
Dr Bean here just saved his life
-'s eyes water
He's choked
shakes his hand nervously, and heads on fast before he's found out
He turns the corner and suddenly sees and , still seated
sees him
0 my god
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along
Nothing ever really changes, does it, David
She turns her head away: the bond of the moments before is gone
looks very contrite
At that moment, another doctor walks by
Excuse me
2 Yes, your doctor will be with you in a minute
We have a lot to deal with here, sir
looks round, and shakes her head
kicks  in the shins
looks round, puzzled
There is a poster of the human skeleton points to the spine
looks but cannot fathom a relevant meaning from it
Another doctor comes along - the same one who they spoke to first
He's young, confident slightly arrogant
Excuse me, doctor
Really Ma'am, we'll get to you in due course
Okay
looks at the poster opposite again
Spine, ribcage, skull
Looks back at Bean gesturing to it
This time the penny drops
Spine spineless
102 Say that again, son
beg your pardon
said say that again, son - because the next time you do, 'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now
'm er
sorry if you've been waiting a long time
We have
In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and 'd really like some action from you before the end of the world
hint of a smile arrives on 's lips
She's heard that somewhere before
So,    why not haul    your
(checks) nice little ass into this room and    explain to me    and    my wife why our precious daughter is going to    be absolutely    fine    because of all the fantastic intelligence and    attention you    are    going to give her case
Okay, sir
Certainly
Good
turns to  - she does a little tilt of her Head `'
And he turns to , who points to himself,    and nods
n Come on
Yes, and Bean, for God's sake, keep out of the goddamn way, will you
nods enthusiastically and backs off
Smiling         Well, well
: 103 '  - Close on an
monitor, green lines on black screen

She has her arm in a cast and a small Band-Aid on her head
otherwise she seems undamaged
is sitting on the end of the bed playing the   game (the Gothic    Vampire thing, with bats and he-men, we saw on '  earlier)
It is    plugged into a
which sits on a trolley
It's quite a noisy game
is immersed in it
Let's get a coffee
Yes
Great
Kevin, '11 send Bean in to keep you company
exits
David follows
enters
He sees  for the first time
Sympathy shows in his eyes
Help me with this
It's a scientific experiment
We're gonna wake up Sleeping Beauty here with the tortured screams of Vampire bats
is determined to help
He sits down with
The game continues
The he-man jumps up and down, lashing out at bats with his sword
Lots of noise, but  sleeps on
: - By a drinks machine
finishes drinking from a plastic cup
Disgusting
She looks up at , who's looking at her
Slowly she gets close and puts her arms around him
She's a bit tearful
Everything's gonna be fine
(pause) About Charles
104 shhh
It was nothing
We're not
He just makes me laugh
When was the last time we laughed
Any of us
know
know
've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions
Olympic standard
Dad
They look down to see  has arrived
These guys just hijacked the
Me and Bean were trying to
hospital  passes, pushing the
on a trolley
Sorry, folks
We're short on these and there's another kid down the hall that could use
Wait a minute
(about to get tough again) Please
It's okay
Really
(to David) Wow - who put the fire in you, my' man
: '  - is still asleep
is sitting on the end of her bed
He looks at the   console thinking, "How can  get this working again
How can  help
" The only sound in the room is the beeping from the
machine, monitoring Jennifer's heart
has an idea
He yanks off the jack plug at the end of the Super Nintendo lead
Producing his small screwdriver, he starts to unscrew the console casing
: 105 - ,  and  walk back towards the room
Maybe  ought to think about getting another job
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch
She and  manage to share a smile
They're going to get through this
Suddenly, we hear noise from the vampire game, coming from 's room
registers this and is puzzled
Then  and  notice it
thought you said
: '  - The  appear in the open doorway
Their expressions turn from curiosity to horror
has plugged the   games system into the       back of 's monitor
couple of bats are flapping about the        screen but the most worrying thing here (shown in close-up) is the sight of a       he-man type, jumping up and down, lashing out, with his sword, at the passing       pulse light, showing Jennifer's faint vital signs
gasps
slowly moves into the room
Now, Bean
just put down that thing
nice and slow
you hear me
Come on now
But  is determined to keep going - it's his way of reviving Jennifer
approaches the opposite side of the bed and gets ready to pounce : a close-up of the monitor
The he-man chases the pulse light
dives across the bed just as he man swipes the pulse light with his sword
has landed on top of
The pulse light explodes and the monitor screen whites-out
wakes up with a start
106 Dad
Get off
What's happening here
Mom
covers her mouth, tearful, but she can't hold it back
She laughs
and  stare at
They can't help but join in the laughter
has no idea what's going on
is happy that everyone is happy
don't care what anyone says
Mr
Bean brought my sister back from the dead
He did it under laboratory conditions
My eyes do not lie
grins at him
Then at
: is fixing some coffee
enters
Here, let me do that
No, 'm fine
He just stands there
okay - you grind the beans, and He moves towards her - his arms slip round her waist
put them in the
( but she can't concentrate  don't believe this
'm being seduced by my own husband
Pause
They are just about to kiss when  enters
He's a bit impatient
Ahm - excuse me
(     ) You know
They jump apart
The moment is gone
Oh yes
Sorry
Though  think these are ready
107 takes out two single socks which have been neatly wrapped around a couple of drinks mats and put in the toaster slots
There
Is that how you like them
beams at her
He's impressed - and feels he's accepted
He leaves
He's not too bad
can live with him
'm afraid you don't know the half of it
Sit down
have a tale to tell
And not a happy one
: ' Looking in front outside, we see Alison sit down
We see, ,but do not hear David start to talk
Within seconds her hands go up to her face in horror
: '
With heavy hearts everyone is gathered to hear their fate
Pan across the familiar faces
, looking nervous and shifty
Dead silence as  stands, very solemnly
Colleagues - what can  say
Incidents such as occurred yesterday teach a man important lessons
On reflection,  realise it would have been a sin to sell Whistler's Mother to such an impertinent philistine as Governor Reynolds
And therefore,  blame myself for having ever let things get to such a pass that we felt we had realise our the staff - twelve got today, 've Schimmel as to sell her
suddenly problem here hasn't been it's been the leadership flabby, lazy- And so decided to appoint Bernie my new Vice- President
, looking smug next to , who is pretty shocked by this
108 He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century
Thank you, sir
Although, 'm afraid  don't quite see how we can
Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive interjection 'd expect from my new
How can we, you ask, survive without Whistler's Mother - our single greatest asset
Well, the truth is - we can't
So what am  saying
Will we find her again
Never - this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius
looks pleased - but then realises it's not a suitable emotion ~ so nods sagely
Insurance
Not a chance
Those bastards never pay
So, surely we're bankrupt
Surely your jobs are forfeit
Surely you're back on the unemployment lines, scraping a living as waiters and boys
Yes
Yes indeed
Except for one little thing
one little thing done by one little man
Dare  say, one helluva little man
Watch this
Everyone is totally at a     loss
stands and moves to the framed poster of Whistler's Mother on     the wall
He then produces a plastic key card and inserts it in a slot on     the side of the frame
buzz and a click
An electric motor starts to     whirrrr
The glass, along with the title strip at the bottom of the poster, slides gently down inside the picture frame to reveal that the poster is in fact the original oil of Whistler's Mother
Ladies and gentlemen
The  Whistler's Mother
There are gasps from the room
is open mouthed
beams as many applaud and  now joins in hyperactively
He's saved
The best security in the world is no match for a master criminal
But no master criminal is a match for me
Thank you all
Now if you would please return to your posts, my new Vice President, Bernard Shimmel would like you all to see the computer program we had prepared for yesterday until we were so rudely interrupted by events
The room is emptying
and  stand there,  stunned heads over
David, David, David
'm fired
Because  let a
copy of a painting the get stolen
Of course not
'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement
loss trust Bernie will be able to reverse
David But
will of course invite you an excellent reference - or Bernie will
looks across from the computer and smiles
has his eyes on
He is mortified by what's happening
notices but misinterprets his worried expression
Of course, Dr
Bean, we'll arrange alternative accommodation for you
believe Bernie has a spare room with en suite bathroom
glares at
is thinking 'No
don't want to stay with horrible
' How are you making out there
110 All fixed up, sir
Stick around, Davey boy
This is going to be quite a show
He presses an intercom
He's enjoying himself
Hi everyone - this is your new Vice President, Bernie Shistler
Would you please watch your video screens
You're in for a treat, guys
: All the staff in all the rooms, gallery, canteen, corridors, look up at various screens
Cut round rooms during this flashy demonstration
(/0) Here you can see our new interactive gallery guide
Every picture in the gallery will have its own story to tell
Van Gogh picture comes up on the giant video screens and then keeps changing, as  keeps talking
Just click , and here is a portrait of the painter - then his family then other paintings by him - then other pictures relevant to him in the gallery Everyone is delighted and impressed
And the beauty is, any idiot can use it
Dr Bean - would you like a try
: '  -
swiftly obliges and sits at the computer
Perhaps you'd like to bring up Whistler's Mother
But  has another plan
He begins to click boxes
: -
The Millais painting we have seen before, with the padlock, comes up on the video screen
(/0) Ah, Our visiting professor has chosen the splendid Millais painting - "His Mistress" : '
busy on the computer
Just click on the corner
again disobeys
He clicks on the padlock repeatedly - humming the familiar 'Goblins' tune
is looking very tense
Right let me take over now
turns and snarls at him - almost a bark
: - Everyone is glued to the screens
You've had long enough on it now
joke's a joke
That's it
Period
On the computer screens, the screen has gone black, just as it did when Bean was playing earlier, and the 6 dashes have appeared with the flashing cursor over the first of them
All watch, intrigued by what they see
: ' The blood drains from 's face
Still humming happily,  slowly types in the letters: ----0- You can stop right there, Mr
Those are confidential
112 Words and figures fill the screen
throws his hands up and sings a verbal fanfare: Daaa
Daaa
moves to 's side and the two stare at the screen, the meaning of its contents dawning on them
Close up of the screen as their eyes find the words: `  ' in the middle of columns of words, figures and dollar signs
: The same figures are being flashed all over on the huge screens
People watching and listening in awe
and  stare at it angrily
: '  ~ Excuse me, If  may just
(calmly) Shut up, Schimmel
Exactly how long have you been siphoning gallery money into your own private accounts
scrolls down the screen
Look at all this - publicity expenditure
catering
all completely fictional
back as far as June 93
don't think you really understand what you're looking at
Horse shit
You're dead, grease-ball
Period
He pushes a button, that sends a picture of what's happening in his office throughout the Gallery
My friends, good news
Mr Schimmel is not only no longer Vice- President
He actually no longer works here
But wait a minute - you can't let some moron from England turn you against me
deny any knowledge of this
He probably typed in all this stuff himself
Don't you find it all a bit suspicious that it's here at his fingertips
(pointing at Bean) There's your criminal, gentlemen
There's the Limey that set me up
Pause
All eyes turn to
people watching the big screens everywhere
Dr
Bean
Have you got anything to say to that
looks long and hard at
Yes- () It's exceedingly rude to point
And punches  sharply in the nose
Everyone in the gallery bursts into applause
: -
Half an hour later
Police cars draw up
is shoved in the back seat of one
,  &  watch
(to uniformed cop) don't know what your methods are these days, Officer, but 'd also ask him a few questions about the destruction of the Whistler copy
nods his head firmly
The car pulls away
Then breaks and reverses
The - gets out
~ Oh, yeah -  forgot
- opens the back of the car
He takes out a huge bunch of flowers
The chief said  was to give you these
is delighted
Then sniffs the flowers
What a nasty stink
Not his sort of thing at all
114 - drives
turns to
owe you a very serious apology, young man
It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this
sincerely hope that you do not
Well, no, sir, 'm sure
He looks sideways to Bean, who is frantically pointing to his spine gets the message, and changes his tune
Let me think about that, Thomas
We'd have to talk quite a salary hike
Of course
And a car
Mmmmm
Maybe two cars
car sounds sensible
And  need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family
Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me
've got a lot of time to make up
heads off
wants to follow, but needs to get rid of the stinky flowers
He turns to  and gives them to her to be rid of them
She beams with delight: after all, he  love her
heads off with  to the parking lot
As they go,  puts an arm round
Who shoos him away instantly
No sloppiness for him
: 115 -
The  family in a group
's arm in a sling
well, it's been
unusual
But thank you
She goes to kiss  - but he just sticks out his hand, and shakes it firmly
Then moves on to
Good-bye Mr Bean
Sorry  screamed that first time
He shakes her broken arm firmly
and she screams again
Come on          hurry or we'll be late
: ,     &     get into the car
It pulls away, as they drive off, sticks his    hand of    the window - and waves a last farewell to  and At last    a sentimental moment - romantic music swelling - like Liza Minelli at    the end    of "Cabaret"
Until the waving hand viciously cracks against the wooden front gate as the car squeezes past
: - The three 30 year old women, dressed in curly red wigs from the musical, 'Annie', hug and kiss their little   and send him off through the gates
They shriek and wave him good-bye
,  and  are there
Oh, and Grierson phoned Lord Walton at the National
Said good things about you
So expect a great reception back home, huh
delighted
Promotion is in his sights
He studies his watch
He's being polite but held really like to get going
116 Good-bye Beanie
It's Bean
surreal
And don't forget you're welcome to come back anytime
delivers a sharp nudge to his ribs
in the distant future
Bye, Bean
Thanks for everything
And take care, huh
know it's insane, but 'm going to miss you
nods abruptly, picks up his case, checks his watch and goes
He doesn't look    back
Kevin and David turn and walk away
does stop to look back over    his shoulder at , heading off in the distance
But  doesn't turn,    so  walks on
Then there is suddenly a tap on his shoulder
It's , ,as though he's magically jumped there
He gives  a big bear hug, a big grin, and then a little wave - and heads away
In the distance, he treads on the back of ,some one's shoe
: - Shot from high up
's lime green mini approaches, coming around Trafalgar Square, and drives up onto the pavement, in front of the gallery
It stops and  gets out
He looks up at the building, pleased to be back
: - pauses outside the revolving doors to clip his staff identity badge onto his top pocket
He enters in high spirits
: - enters the reception hall
It is totally deserted
He frowns, and heads on, puzzled
117 : 1 The place    is totally empty except for a  sweeping up litter in the middle of    the room
There are faded rectangles on the walls where all the paintings    should be
Only one very solid looking statue remains
is thoroughly    perplexed They've moved, guy
is utterly perplexed
He looks round the corner into another empty gallery, and shakes his head
: - looks up at the building and gives a disgusted grunt ,before getting into his car and drives off around Trafalgar Square
His brow is deeply furrowed
What will he do now with his life
: ~ The empty gallery  just inspected
Then, from out behind the one remaining statue, emerges
Then, from behind a pillar, Is he gone
Yes, my lord
Tell the others
Very well, my lord
: Pitch dark
door opens and the light from the corridor falls on the 150 gallery employees squashed into this one tiny room
It's the gent's loo
118 's head pops in
He's gone
Massive cheer, bowlers in the air, massive music
Roll credits
: '
Behind the credits, we see close-ups of  hammering away at large planks of wood on some wooden structure
He walks    away from it - without us seeing what it is and goes    to his Mini, where  sits on a pile of books in the front seat, wearing a    seat belt
Bean gets into the car, which is laden with suitcases, starts it    up and drives
straight into the huge crate he has built
rope tied to the back bumper pulls the lid closed behind him
: The crate sits on the back of a speeding truck
: The crate is now on the top of a forklift truck moving up the ramp on an American airline cargo plane
Close up on a large sticker on the crate: it reads: " , 23  , , And cut to the plane flying through clear skies
Though, for the Lear's of course there are no clear skies ahead
