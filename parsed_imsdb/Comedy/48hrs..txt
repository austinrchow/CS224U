"48
" -- Unknown draft/writers : - Endless green hills bisected by a ribbon of highway
road gang clearing brush by the side of the road
Twenty-five men in prison fatigues sweating through their mid-afternoon labor
Flank the working prisoners
Mountie hats, shotguns, sidearms, sunglasses; they look like they mean it
battered pickup appears
approaches
Suddenly, it coughs, shudders, stalls
big Blackfoot Indian named gets out and starts cursing and kicking the vehicle
Then he begins walking toward the road gang
is the Guard near the center of the work gang; he smiles at the oncoming man, pokes a prisoner beside him
Wonder what reservation they let him off of
The prisoner is  who looks up, grins at Brady
Yeah, there goes the neighborhood
Brady laughs as Billy Bear closes in on him
Say, buddy, my engine's overheating and  got 30 miles before the next station
Could get some water out of your cooler
Ganz leans on his hoe, speaks as Billy passes
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto
You got a real big mouth, convict
It's okay, chief
He's just joking
How about the water
Firewater, Tonto
Is that what you
Billy whirls, swings at Ganz
Both men roll to the ground
Hey
Jesus Christ
Seeing the commotion, they run toward it
As they struggle, Billy slips a pistol into Ganz' hand
That's a state prisoner, asshole
Back off
Brady pulls Billy away from Ganz just 'as one of the other officers arrives
Ganz suddenly whips out a pistol, shoots Brady at point-blank range
Before the other Guards can even react, Billy comes out with his own pistol, caps the Second Guard
Still forty yards away
In mid-draw, be howls as a bullet from Ganz breaks the nearby ground
He fires, then turns and runs for the prison bus
Smiling, fires twice
but the range is too great for pistol work
Watching
Then they all scatter in different directions
Hefts his weapon
Come on
He and the big Indian run to the pickup, climb in and roar away
The   making a call on the police radio
657, Unit 25 to  478t 657t Unit 25 to  478
Go ahead, Unit 25
Escape in progress
Two officers shot off rail crossing 31
Prisoners escaping
Two men, one six-four, 200 pounds, dark, an Indian, the other, Albert Ganz, five-ten
Several miles from the escape
big semi parked by the side of ttie road; back doors to the closed trailer open station wagon parked across the road
The pickup appears, approaches the semi, slows down and drives up the ramp into the van
Ganz and Billy jump out, shove the ramp up inside the truck and close the big doors
Ganz and Billy climb inside ancl roar off, back in the direction of the road gang
Takes off his hat, puts on a baseball cap and sunglasses
Get ready to duck
Ganz dives for the floor
Three police cars go by, sirens blaring, lights flashing
They pass the road gang
Ganz reappear, smiles
You know something
'm having a real good time
The station wagon blasts down the pavement
Becomes a small dot on the landscape
- the portal slams open revealing a man holding a huge pistol,jack cates, s
, a large and powerful man
He stealthily moves up a stairwell
He stops at the top of the stairs
Listens gun still ready
continuous sound of running water
Cates moves toward the bathroom
Rips the door open
The shape behind the shower curtain freezes
Cates, gun held level, moves forward
Rips the shower curtain open
Revealing a young and very beautiful woman,
Inspector Jack Cates,
And you're wanted
Elaine stares at him as Cates turns off the water
What am  wanted for
don't answer questions,  ask 'em
moment as she continues to stare at his pistol
don't think your gun's loaded
This is a
44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world
You gotta ask yourself just one question
Are you feelin' lucky
still don't think it's loaded
Elaine shakes her head and smiles, folds her arms over her breasts, shivers a little
Cates looks at the cylinder, spins it
Hey, you're right
You're hopeless
That's the way  see it, too
Be puts the gun down on the edge of the sink, embraces her
'm all wet
What's wrong with that
They both smile
Cates in bed with Elaine
She wears his shirt
guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today
What'd you do
Irrigated his face with the shot of  and  'd just poured him
Then  tried to deck the sucker
guess he got the message
Then  sit back and  think, mean, who's to say 'm not a dumb bitch
work in a bar, right
can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place
You are what you do
Positive self-image problem all over again
You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit
do think all psychotherapy is bullshit
But just because  think it's bullshit doesn't mean  don't know something about it
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, 'll take brutal indifference
Hey, you know what  really think
Tell me--'m dyin' to hear it
think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear
You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas 've ever had
think that if you need bigger and better things
then go for em
She smiles at him after this
It looks like they'll kiss
Their faces are close
Then she lightly moves back
You oversimplify every
He stops her in the middle of the sentence by kissing her, then pulls back
Some things are simple, right
Their faces are very close
but they don't touch for another second
Right
- Titles continue
Tugs churning across the bay
Quiet city streets
Parked cars covered with early morning dew
newspaper truck slowly grinds by, drops a bundleand moves on
- The station wagon pulls up to a young punk,  , on a motorcycle
Billy Bear smiles and leans out the driver's side window
You got somethin' for us, Henry
Henry produces some credit cards
Billy passes them to Ganz for inspection
How hot are they
Hot
Hey, they're not even room temperature
Ganz snorts derisively
How ya doin'
Can't complain
We got a lot to talk about
Yeah, old times
We'll follow you
Take it slow,okay
Sure, right
Ganz pockets the credit cards as Henry wheels away
want to drive awhile
ain't tired yet
Maybe after we get done with him 'm gonna buy us some girls
Whaddya mean, buy
Pros
Ganz stares at Billy
Pay money
Yeah, dummy
Money
never paid for it in my life
It's better when you pay
they let you do anything
They always let me do anything don't want to pay for it
never paid for it in my life
Just do what  say, okay
We'll pay for the girls and have a good time
Don't you trust me
Billy smiles
Sure,  trust ya
They drive off
-   - First light breaks over Telegraph Hill
quiet row of Victorian townhouses now converted into apartments
- Cates is sprawled across the double bed; Elaine is on the verge of falling off the edge
Cates' eyes snap open second later, his wrist watch alarm goes off
He turns it off, gets out of bed and begins pulling on his pants
Elaine sits up in bed, still wearing Cates' blue shirt
Cates picks up a robe as Elaine gets out of bed on the opposite side, throws the robe to Elaine
She takes off the shirt, swaps it for the robe and throws the shirt to Jack
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning
What makes you think  have any clean shirts at my place
He buttons his shirt and heads for the kitchen
Cates brushing his teeth at the sink, Elaine making coffee
You know, that's my toothbrush, Jack
He keeps brushing
Maybe you ought to buy me one
Maybe  would if  knew when you were coming back
He stops brushing, turns and looks at her
'm here
And 've been coming back for quite awhile
Let's not hassle, okay
And can  have a cup of coffee
Please
She pours some coffee, hands him a cup and saucer
Cates pours some whiskey into it from a flask
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning
Maybe  got a fairly crummy day ahead
Maybe that makes a nice excuse
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about
Cates picks his holstered
44 off a chair back and begins strapping it on
When you start with that attitude
it's like  don't know who you are
What do you want to know
What difference does it make
'm the guy in your bed the last three months
make you feel good
You make me feel good
What the hell else do you want from a guy
wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so  won't care for you
wish you'd give me a little more of a chance
He turns away, moves into the corridor near the stairwell
don't have time for this gotta go to work
She stands frozen
He turns back and looks at her; it's hard to apologize
(continuing) Look, 'm glad 'm in your life
and hell, with an ass like yours, figure anything might be possible
She is warmed up by the first part, amused by the second; she approaches
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless
That's the way  see it, too
Call me later
You sure you want me to
Yeah, for some reason, 'm sure
He moves closer, kisses her
Thanks for the coffee
think you forgot this
Hands him his wallet and badge
Guess people ought to know who am
He turns to go down the stairwell
Jack, wait
Here
She puts a scarf around his neck
(continuing) It's cold as hell out these mornings, and you know what the man said, the coldest winter ever spent was the summer  spent in San Francisco
They don't kiss
He nods appreciately, the scarf in hand as he turns and goes
-   - Cates comes out of Elaine's apartment building, crosses to his whipped and battered  64 Cadillac convertible, notices a parking ticket stuck under the windshield wiper
Son of a bitch
Shoves the ticket in his coat pocket, gets into the Caddie puts the scarf around the rear view mirror, starts the engine and guns away
Cates driving the convertible; he comes down a hill and turns toward the East Bay
- Henry Wong, seated on a park bench
Now very dead, a bullet hole in the middle of his forehead
Billy Bear is seated next to him on the bench reading the race form
Using the telephone at an outdoor booth a few feet beyond the bench
-   - and , a young couple, turn a corner
dark parody of all-American young marrieds
They are bickering as usual
liked that carpet we saw
We can't afford it
Don't remind me
Whaddya want me to do, go out and steal for the money
hated the color anyway; the color sucked
Suddenly, Billy and Ganz descend on Luther and Rosalie and pull them into their station wagon
Billy has Rosalie by the mouth, gagging her with his big paw
Ganz has his gun at Luther's neck
Surprise, Luther
Whaddya want
thought you were locked up- want the money, asshole, what do you think
The money that Reggie hid
don't know what you're talkin' about
You want that Indian to snap her neck
He mimes the gesture
snap
(continuing) Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me
Don't give me this, we were partners
Billy, go ahead, break it
No
Don't kill her
can get you the money
When
can't get it until Monday
Honest
You chickenshit punk
Honest
The place we stashed it opens Monday morning
can't get it till then
Monday morning, that's when it opens
After that, 'll get the money to you right away
Ganz finally takes the gun from the neck
always liked you, Luther
You were always a lotta fun to hang out with
Rosalie is rubbing her neck now that she's been released
Ganz gestures to Billy
(continuing) We're gonna keep her
Luther desperately doesn't like this
Come on, you can trust me
Please
You try to mess with us or go to the cops,  promise you, 'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe
He smiles at Luther, pinches him on the cheek, shoves him out of the car
Stands shivering as it powers away
- small hotel on one of the quiet streets behind Union Square
Pulls up across the street
Tha car arrives in front of the hotel
Nice place, huh
Rosalie is very nervous
What are you gonna do to me in there
Ganz gives her a casual smile
Maybe that's where 'm gonna cut your throat
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what  tell ya, you'll be okay
They move out of the car, head for the hotel
sits behind the desk in a mirrored entrance hall
She reads a lurid paperback
Morning traffic streams by outside as Ganz, Billy and Rosalie enter and approach the desk
We need some rooms for a couple of nights
Okay
She smiles at Ganz
Sure
We don't get many real customers, ya know
Most people only stay an hour or two
Passes a form across
Ganz signs it, Frizzy glances at his signature then takes a key from the rack behind
want her young
And tall
Nice legs
Legs are important
Then, real thin
Yeah
jeans- dress
a nice summer dress
You know  want her fresh
'll tell you why, because  been hoein' weeds and makin' license plates for a couple of years
Yeah, know you don't get it
Sees a couple approaching, he shoves the dead man down on the bench and spreads the newspaper over his head
The body now looking like a typical park bum who has spent the night
Billy walks over to Ganz
Hey, what about me
And  need one more for my pal
Yeah
Make her an Indian
No, not a turban, you know, a squaw
Billy smiles, takes the Polaroid
close shot of the dead man with the bullet hole in his forehead
Takes the photograph back from Billy and slips it into his jacket pocket
Walden Hotel
Third near Broadway
Tell them to ask for
uh
He takes the hot credit cards out of his pocket, the name embossed on the plastic
(continuing) Polson
Just be a couple of hours
Hangs up
The two men head for a green Plymouth
Number twenty-seven, Mr
Polson
Put them next door, okay
She gives him a slightly knowing look
Sure, hey, you got the whole floor to yourself
Ganz sends her back a sharp look
Keep your filthy ideas to yourself, lady
Ganz picks up his suitcase, walks over to the nearest stairwell
Billy and Rosalie follow
Bars starting to fill up with mid-day customers
black Chevy cruises past and stops further up the block
Two Plainclothesmen,  and , get out of the car
As they start toward the Walden
Pulls up near the two men
Cates climbs out of his car and walks over to them
Hey, fellas, what's happening
Radio said you guys had something on
Not much, Jack
Salesman named Polson had his credit cards lifted
Algren nods over to the parking lot opposite
(continuing) One of Polson's cards rented that green coupe
Not too much for a big rough tough gunfighter like you to do on this one
Cates smiles at the verbal positioning he's used to with his colleagues
Suspect packed or is this a laugher
Five and dime stuff
Polson said a kid with a switchblade mugged him and drove off on a motorcyle
Yeah, well,  guess you two are experts at taking boy scout knives away from teenagers
Yeah, we are, that means you can stay outta this one
We don't have any big need for the artillery Vanzant's turn to smile
Hey, 'm just offering to help out
like to watch real pros work
Help, huh
Sometimes your kind of help tends to leave the suspect in bad shape
Algren
mediator
soothes the competitive situation
Hey, relax
Jack, you wanna come inside, fine
You can stake out the lobby
Cates, a bit disgusted at the politics of this moment, nods
Fine, it's your show
The three men move toward the Walden
Frizzy Blonde still behind the desk
Still reading the lurid paperback
Unaware as Vanzant and Algren approach
She looks up as they flash their badges
Aw, you guys were in last week
You better ask around
'm not supposed to be hassled
got friends
Hey, park the tongue for a second, sweetpants, we just want to search a room
Not unless you got a warrant
Maybe you should of been a lawyer instead of a dumb skirt workin' behind a register
Frizzy turns to find Cates standing beside her
He nudges her aside
Starts going throught the register book
Aw, come on, what the shit is this
We're looking for a guy going under the name Polson
Frizzy sits back down in defeat
Okay, big deal
Get it over with
Cates finds the name
Mr
Polson, room 27
Is he alone
Naw, his sister went up an hour ago
Vanzant turns to Cates
Okay, like we said, you stake out the lobby
Sure
Great
Whatever
You're not missing out on Dillinger
This punk just stole some credit cards
Cates watches the two Detectives head for the elevator
Vanzant and Algren move down the hallwayStop at the far end
Both Detectives draw their pistols and approach a door
Summer dress and undergarments scatteredon the floor
, lies naked under the covers
She matches Ganz's earlier requirements
Smoking a cigarette, staring at the ceiling
Ganz remains on top of the blanket
Still in his shirt and pants watching
Three sharp knocks at the door
Ganz reacts as if he's received an electric shock
His hand goes under the pillow
Comes up with an automatic
Shoves it hard into Lisa's stomach
Hey
Shut up
What the hell's wrong
didn't do anything
Another knock
Ganz makes her move to the door
(continuing) What do you want
What's goin' on
Shut up
She grabs her dress and tries to pull it on
(continuing) Now ask who it is
Shoves harder with the pistol
(continuing) Come on, ask
She calls out
Who is it
Vanzant and Algren stand back from the door
Guns held ready
Police
open up
R00M Lisa looks from the door back to Ganz
Then at the gun held against her
She's petrified
Stall
What do you want
Police business
Come on, open up
smile on Ganz' face
Almost as if he's enjoying the moment
Keep stallin'
Alright, 'm coming
hold on
'll just be a minute
Vanzant and Algren waiting
Sounds of movement from within the room
Cates moves toward the foot of the stairwell
Looks across at mirror on the wall opposite
The entire lobby covered from this spot
Every angle, including Frizzy
Ganz gestures to Lisa
Just a second
Ganz belts her with his gun; she falls
Ganz goes through the connecting door
Slips into the adjacent room
' Another Hooker cowers in the corner, pulling on her clothes
She's a Mexican girl in a ridiculous 'Indian' outfit
Que paso
Que esta pasando
No entiendo
Shut up
Billy goes to where Rosalie is awkwardlytied to a chair with an electric dord
He pulls her to her feet as Ganz moves by
(continuing) When  say jump, girl, you better jump
(continuing) Vanzant reaches down, tries the knob
Locked
Algren moves back, preparing to kick the door down
Ganz opens the door behind the two cops
Raises his pistol and fires
Billy's shots follow immediately
Hits Vanzant
Algren rolls just as Ganz fires again
Wounded, he gets off three shots, then moves inside Ganz' room
Ganz and Billy run for the elevator
Exchange two more shots with Algren
The Mexican Girl begins screaming in Spanish
Cates draws his
44
Races up the stairs three at a time
Frizzy starts to frantically call the police
Cates stops at the landing
Vanzant's body sprawled across the hallway
Algren back in the corridor, still losing blood
Leans against the wall for support
Lisa staggers out of the room, screams
Algren points the gun toward the elevator
Indicating where Ganz and Billy have just fled
Cates starts back down toward the lobby
Ganz and Billy, guns ready as the carriage jolts downward
Rosalie is terrified, sobbing
Arrives at the halfway turn of the second staircase
He takes the next flight in two jumps
As the doors open, Ganz gestures for Billy and Rosalie to wait as he heads for the lobby
Cates literally flies into the lobby just as Ganz appears
He slams Ganz against a column, belts him across the neck with his pistol
Ganz screams with pain, drops his gun
Cates again slams him with his pistol, felling him
Slides across the floor
Senses something
moves just as Billy appears behind and fires at him
The bullet takes out a window
Cates dives over the desk
Another bullet chews up the wood
Frizzy has been standing beside her desk, screaming
Cates' move and the accompanying bulletspanic her
She dashes for safety
Cates gets to his feet behind cover
Sees Billy holding Rosalie by the throat
Frizzy begins to scream
He'll blow her goddamn head off
Cates doesn't miss a beat
He slowly levels his
44
Takes careful aim and starts to fire at Billy
No
No
Cates' shot narrowly misses Rosalie
The bullet smashes into a mirror above Billy's head
Cates keeps moving closer, gun pointed straight ahead
Billy pushes the pistol against Rosalie'temple
For the first time, Cates hesitates
They face each other across the length of the lobby
Struggles down the remaining steps into the lobby
He still holds his revolver
Dares not raise it towards Billy and Rosalie
Covers Algren from near the entrance
He's confused, doesn't know what to do
He keeps hold of Rosalie
His eyes catch Algren's
You
Drop it and we won't kill her
Algren tosses his gun to the floor
(continuing) Now, tell him to drop his Goddamn piece
Do it, Cates
No response
(continuing) Do it, Cates
Goddamn it, do it
Cates lowers his gun
Finally lets it drop to the floor
Kick it over here
Cates does; Ganz picks it up, smiles, looks at Billy
(continuing) Get the car
Then back to Cates as Billy runs out the entrance with Rosalie
(continuing) Your gun's just like mine
He's going to kill Cates
But first be glances at Algren
Then, almost casually, shoots him twice with Cates'
44
Algren staggers back
Dead before he hits the floor
Cates twists sideways just as Ganz fires
The bullet misses
Again Frizzy starts screaming and struggling
Ganz swipes the woman across the head with the gun
Her body slumps to the floor
Police sirens can be heard in the distance
Cates makes an attempt for Algren's gun
bullet splatters against the floor only inches from his outstretched fingers
The gun skitters out of reach
You lying son of a bitch
What are you talking about
We didn't kill her
Ganz smiles
With your own gun, cop
How does it feel
Cates leaps into a wooden phone booth
Ganz leisurely blasts away at the booth with both his and Cates' gun
Two bullets crash into the booth
Ganz moves to check inside the booth but sirens are ominously near
Ganz finally retreats out the entrance
Billy and Rosalie weave their way across street to the Cougar
They make a -turn
Ganz runs out
Car pulls out, then the police cars and vans begin to arrive
Chunks of wood on the floor
Shafts of light through a dozen bullet holes
Shattered receiver dangling from a cord
Cates, wedged tight into the very top of the cubicle
He drops to the floor
The police arrive
Swarm into the hotel
All eyes on Cates as he rushes to Algren
Too late
Cates realizes Algren is dead
He cradles Algren's head as he stares at the arriving Squad and Patrolmen
Cates walks in
Several Detectives gather around him
What happened
Read the report
Two cops blown away by a credit card booster
that don't figure
No shit
They were good cops
They were good cops who fucked up and got careless
snotty   paces
That's what you say, Cates
Yeah
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine
we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy
Cates looks at the Old Cop
It don't figure
need to borrow a piece
The   shrugs
looks in his desk
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure
Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap
guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible
Cates loses it for a second, lands on him with both hands, pushes him against a wall
The room goes quiet
Cates cools down
Just shut the fuck up
The other cops don't intervene
They just watch
Cates cools down, straightens up
walks by, or, rather, speeds by
Cates, 'll need to see you in five minutes, exactly five
The Old Cop hands Cates a gun, a traditional Army
45
Best  can do
'you read me, Cates
Haden continues moving away
Five minutes
heard you, your voice carries
As Cates is examining the gun, , a lab technician, enters and drops three 8 x 10's on the desk near Cates
They're still wet
Cates lifts the blow-ups, each one showing a different aspect of a spent bullet
(continuing) Lots of people getting shot with 44's lately
Last year, it was Saturday Night Specials
now it's heavy stuff
People must be getting madder about something
Cates starts pinning the blow-ups onto a large bulletin board on the wall
Nearby, at the same time (within Cates' line of sight, within earshot), Lisa, the Hooker, is being interrogated by a - who pulls the statement off the typewriter
Nearby, the Indian Hooker is being interrogated in Spanish
You're an accessory to Murder One, so you're going to have to do a whole lot better than what we got down here, honey
Gimme a break, huh
Look, got there
He was a trick just like any other for all  knew
That's all there is
He didn't feel like sitting and talking
He was in a big hurry to get laid
was with him about an hour
Cates has gotten interested in the last part of this
drifts toward her
comes through, begins distributing
printouts to Cates, the other nearby officers
We got a print from the hotel room
Guy's real name is Ganz, Albert Ganz
hitter from back East but he worked out here a few years back
Armed robbery
Broke out of prison two days ago and capped two of the guards
real animal
Wait'll you see this
Cates reads the printout, then smoothly,imperiously, he takes over the questioning of Lisa
Did he give you a return match
He wasn't interested
Maybe he didn't like your performance
Fuck you
'll take a raincheck
From the side, Ruth is pointing at the photos
This'll interest you, Jack
we've got something here from your gun
and these are from the first weapon Ganz used
don't get it
Here
She turns, produces the third photo
Pins it beside the one from the Walden Hotel
perfect match for the markings from the first gun he used
but not from the Walden Hotel
fired at least six hours earlier
at point blank range
right between the eyes
Found him on a park bench
She shows him two more pictures
Police forensics shots of Henry Wong
very dead on the park bench
(continuing) Ya know, there are some very bad people out there in the world
Look at it this way, Ruth
If there weren't, what would there be for us to do
Lisa continues with the Policewoman
Anyway
so  got there and took him down
He started watching television and then you sensational people started banging on the door
that's all
except
he's gonna give you guys a hard time
Cates looks up as he hears that remark
Notices , another Detective, entering with a long suitcase
What makes you think so
think he liked shooting cops a lot more than getting laid
Cates watches Kehoe unpack the box
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel
Every last bit of it
The big guy's room was empty
'll help you out
Cates and Kehoe start going through the suitcase
Kehoe produces a speed loader for a
44
This guy must have had a
44 like yours, Jack
Now he's got yours
Shit
Kehoe next produces several boxes of shells
This cat was real serious about his artillery
An Attendant comes through, hands Kehoe a file
He opens it, shows the file to Cates who reads the name under the mug shot
Billy Bear
Backup man from the East Bay
Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang
Kehoe opens the second file
Four mug shots are inside
Who are all these
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago
Wait a minute, wait a minute
who's this
Uhh
Wong, Henry Wong
He was in on the same job
Cates spins the file around so that both Ruth an Kehoe can see it, throws the forensic shots down beside it
Tell me that's not the same guy
Hey
Dick Tracy
Did Ganz have a grudge against his old friends
Haden comes out of his office
Get in here, Cates
Cates ignores him
think  wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking
Can we find them
Here's the file
Cates checks the file
One of  em's in the slam
Damn you, Cates
Get in here
Cates walks into Haden's cubicle
want to be left alone on this one
Algren was killed with my gun
Yeah,  read the report
Haden shuffles some papers, seems to ignore Cates
Hey, the bastard's got my gun want it back
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings
Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian
In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business
know, we all know the truth's a little different
Cates almost smiles at Haden
Yeah
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun
Yeah
It bothers me when cops get hurt while 'm makin' a play don't like it
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far
Besides, got a lead
Okay
You're not a team player
You gotta do things your own way
Fine
Nail this guy and make us all look good
But you better watch your ass
If you screw up, can promise you, you're goin' down
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude
He starts to go
Jack
Yeah
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces
We got enough dead cops on this one
'll keep it in mind
Leaves
Heavy vehicle and pedestrian traffic
Cates stands near a hot dog stand
Elaine joins him
Cates is eating a hot dog and studying a police file
Great place for lunch
Yeah, one of my favorites
You made the front page
He hands her a dog
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day
Jack, are you okay
Sure, okay, fine, no problem
See, there's this kid in jail
First thing  got to do is go up and see what he knows
He points to the file
thought you might come over to my place to recuperate
don't have to go to work until the day after tomorrow
They begin to stroll down the street
got nothing to recuperate from
There's a guy out there with my gun, and  want it back
She's not happy with this attitude
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun
Bullshit
'll tell you about bullshit
My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it
It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop
It's not a practical way to function
didn't get burned, two cops did
Listen, 'll tell you about personnel responsibility
like to get the job done right
And if don't get my job done right
'm for shit
Here it comes again
the sacred job
That's right
'm not like you
'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong
There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and 'm gonna get him
Because it's my job
And if you don't get that
get that
The job first
Everything else, especially me, second
get it
don't like it
Pause
No one asked you to like it
But that's the way it is
- Cates and a  on the upper deck approaching the door to the cell block
The Guard shouts upward
Open Nine
With a huge metal clatters the door to the cell block opens
- Cates and the Guard go through the door
Close Nine
They move forward together
(continuing) It's Number Twenty-two
You want company
No, no thanks
The Guard shrugs, stays by the door
He walks down the cell block
Inmates stare at him from inside the stark cells
They don't know who he is, but they can smell a cop
Cates stops at Twenty-two, looks inside
a bit startled
Obviously, Reggie Hammond has connections and taste
The paint is fresh; there's framed prints on the wall instead of pin-ups, and the overall feeling is that of a graduate school dorm rather than a prison
Cates turns, nods to the Guard at the end of the cell block
He throws a switch and the door opens
' Cates steps inside
Hammond is at a table wearing a Sony Walkman and writing in some detailed ledgers with a fountain pen
He's boogeying in his seat to the music
Sprawled on a bunk nearby is , another black inmate close to Hammond's age
Leroy is leafing through a copy of a skin magazine
He doesn't even look at Cates
Hammond
Cates steps inside the cell
(continuing) Hammond
No answer
Cates leans over, hits the override button on the Sony
(continuing) Hammond
Hammond jumps, grabs his ears in pain
He pulls the headset off and glares at Cates
You got a name, cop
Try Cates
And let's talk in private, okay
Sure, anything you want
He tosses the Walkman to Leroy who dutifully puts it on
Look, convict,  know all about you
Single
No fixed address
No known relatives
One previous conviction
Armed robbery
six months to go on a three-year sentence
You here to write my life story
Not likely, Reggie
Maybe  just need some help
Cates takes the forensic photo out of his pocket, passes it across the table to Hammond
He looks at it, hardly reacts
Henry Wong
My old pal
He's looked better
He passes the photo back
(continuing) Look,  got just six months before gettin' out of here
Six months between me and freedom after bein' here three years
And 'm not gonna do anything to screw it up, includin' pee in the prison yard, knock up the Warden's daughter or rat on my old partners
Cates swings the cell door back open
Too bad, Reggie
thought maybe you were a smart boy
But  guess if you were real smart you wouldn't be a convict
He smiles, decides to play his card
(continuing) can see a second-rater like you wouldn't be any help at all goin' up against a real hard case like Ganz
Hammond jerks his head around
Ganz
Pause
(continuing) Ganz the one who shot Henry
Cates,  asked you a question
Cates smiles
Yeah,  noticed
Ganz is in jail
He's gonna be there two years after 'm on the street
Didn't work out that way
He busted out with a big Indian
They capped two guards on a road gang
Nice meeting you Reggie
He turns, goes out
The door clangs behind him
Hammond jumps up and bangs on the bars, shouts at Cates' back
Cates, Come back here
Cates turns, saunters back, leans against the door
Yeah
can deliver Ganz
But you gotta get me outta here first
You're crazy
can help you, man, but you gotta get me out
got to be on the street
Get me outta here
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street
got a lot to protect
Bullshit
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz
'll think about it
Cates typing several of official looking documents while seated across from a rather dour-looking bureaucrat named
Let me borrow your pen, Bob
Handed over by Bob
You going to use your own name
Shit, no
He begins signing the documents
Jack, just remember one thing
If all this comes down, you don't know me
'm not gonna burn for you
And 'll tell you something else
If it all comes down, your ass is new-mown grass
Right
Hey, no sweat
He hands over the papers
Smiles
You got him for 48 hours
Bob studies the sheet
(continuing) You got a big career as a forger if you decide to go that way, Jack
'll ring security
-  - The  leads Hammond to a steel cage
Harmnond's now wearing a beautifully tailored plaid suit
The Guard shouts to   on the far side
Prisoner G21355
Hammond
Okay
Send him through
The gate slides open
The Guard geztures for Hairmond to enter
Hammond walks to the far side of the pen
The first gate closes, the second one opens
Hammond turns and walks over to Cates
The Guard comes up to Cates, double checks his orders then unlocks Hammond's cuffs
Gotta sign for him
Sure thing
He looks over at Hammond who smiles at him
Then looks at Harmond's clothes
(continuing) This prison gives out $400 suits
What are you talkin' about
This suit's mine
It cost $900
Hammond dusts off a sleeve
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers
Listen, it may be a little out of date
You know,  got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies
Cates hands some papers to the Guard
He's all yours
The Guard walks away as Hammond feels Cates' lapel
We could change this for something good
Get you lookin' sharp for pussy
Cates gives him a look
don't need to hear your jive already got that department taken care of
You got a girl
shit
the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me
Cates slaps a cuff on Hammond's outstrethand, then puts the other on his own wrist
(continuing) Hey, no way
Take off the bracelets or no deal
You just don't get it, do your Reggie
There isn't any deal own your ass
No way to start a partnership
Get this
We ain't partners
We ain't brothers
We ain't friends
'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead
And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met
Shit
'm already sorry
Cates yanks on the cuffs
They move away
- ' This your car, man
Yeah
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers
As they approach the car
Okay, let's get down to it
did my part and got you out
So now you tell me where we're goin'
Don't worry,  got a move for ya
An awesome move
guy named Luther
Ganz'll be paying him a visit
We go to him right away
Luther was part of the gang
What gang you talkin' about, Jack
can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'
Cates gets behind the wheel and kicks the engine over
don't give a damn
It happens to be my name
Then what're you complainin' about
At least nobody's calling you shithead
may call you worse than that
Cates drives off
-   - Cates' Cadillac purrs into view, entering a deserted street within a rundown neighborhood
Hammond seated next to Cates
Just up the street, the other side, over there
Now, don't bother knockin' on the door
Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me
Luther ain't the reliable type don't want you shot yet, Cates
not before you been a help to me
'm helpin' you, huh
Hammond smiles
Yeah
Didn't you know that
The Caddy pulls to a stop
Over there
232
Cates double-checks his
38
(continuing) You better let me borrow one of those
Cates smiles
Sure thing, asshole
Handcuffs Hammond to the door handle
Grabs the car keys
(continuing) You just hang on
And hope this big move of yours turns out to be something
Opens the car door
(continuing) ' Cates knocks at the door
Nothing
Knocks again
no response
From inside, he hears a faint noise but no response to the knock
Holding the
38 in one hand, Cates tries the knob with the other
The door opens
Cautiously, Cates steps inside
' Long corridor ahead
No sign of Luther
Moves down the corriaor, checks the rooms off to one sides
slips into the hallway behind Cates
Cates turns just as he gets to the kitchen
Luther holds a gun
Cates drops to a crouch and aims the
38
Luther whirls and fires at Cates
As wood and plaster fly out all round him, Cates makes a running dive for the floor
Luther runs out before Cates has regainehis feet
Luther rushes out the front door and heads toward the Cadillac
Watches as Luther heads down the sidewaltoward him
As he starts to pass by
Hammond steps out suddenly
Flattens him with the car door
Luther drops, stunned
Hammond, still restricted by being cuffed to the door handle, reaches and grabs his pistol
Hammond, Drop the Goddamn gun
Hammond looks up
He sprints across the pavement
Aims his gun at Hammond
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack,  need to talk to this man
'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun
got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me
Just throw me the Goddamn gun
Long moment
Then Hammond smiles and tosses him Luther's pistol
Luther groans
Cates puts his foot on Luther's belly and pulls himself into a standing position, cuffs him
Luther,  always told you the physical side of life wasn't your gig
Look at you, all messed up
Course you never were much in the snappy dresser department, were you
Cates now has Luther ready to be questioned
Come on, talk to him
Hammond turns to smile at Luther
What's happening, Luther
thought you were inside
Meet my travel Agent
Luther leans forward, looks straight at Cates
cop
sure ain't his fairy godmother
now 'm looking for Ganz
where is he
Haven't seen him for years
That's the truth
You just took a shot at me, asshole
think you do know where he is
Who gives a fuck what you think
Cates grabs the still open Cadillac door, slams it into Luther
He falls backwards
Cates looks at Hammond
Hey, this works pretty good
Thank you
Want to try it again
Luther sits up again, glares at Cates
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie
think  met her
Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her
don't know
Cates slams the car door agains him again
gotta tell you he's having a ball with this car door, Luther
You'd better think of somethin' to tell him
Luther besitates
flashes a look at Hammond, who sends him a silent fleeting reply
Maybe Cates sees this
Maybe not
He
he wants me to help him skip town
When
How
dunno
he's gonna call me
Another look at Hammond
(continuing) He's gonna call me on
Tuesday
Something's wrong with all this
Cates isn't sure just what
Not yet
He looks at Hammond
What do you think
think you better put him on ice, man
He's gotta take that call
if there is one
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him
Ain't you, motherfucker
Luther makes a play toward Hammond, who laughs, doesn't even flinch
(continuing) Luther, are you angry with me
Cates wrestles Luther into the back seat, turns to Hammond
don't know what the hell you're smiling about, watermelon
Your big move turned out to be shit
Just stares at Cates, keeps smiling
-   - Two Uniforms follow a sullen Luther, Cates and Hammond to the Cates speaks to him through the small window
Assault on a police officer with a deadly weapon
Carrying a concealed weapon
Resisting arrest, Disturbing the peace
Public nuisance
The Sergeant begins typing out an arrest form
(continuing) 'll think up a few more and file the report tomorrow
Cates looks back at Hammond as Luther is hauled away
(continuing) Come on,  gotta make a phone call
As they move through the honeycomb of office partitions
(continuing) You stay with me
Cates picks up the phone on the other side of the booking desk
Dials
waits for a response as   are led past by an Arresting Officer
Hammond gives them the eye
(continuing) This is Jack Cates
Any messages
' Elaine is on the kitchen phone, speakingwhite putting her coat on over her uniform for the evening
One look at the way it is cut and you know why she hates her job
Just one
Some lady called
Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes
But she still wants her occasional roommate
She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight
if it's humanly possible
Elaine, look, 'm in the middle of sone stuff right now
'm not gonna have time to come by don't know when  can get there
Her face falls
Making the offer was hard enough
Come on, Jack
you're making me work too Goddamn hard at this
Jack is very irritated by this turn of events
Listen, Goddamn it if you think 'm happy about it, you're nuts
just gotta take care of a few things, okay
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave
Cates says nothing
She hangs up angrily
Hammond is working on the girls
Excuse me, ladies, you seem to be in need of assistance
Look, we got enough problems, we don't need no tight-ass court- appointed lawyer trying to bullshit us
Sweetheart, 'm not trying to bullshit you
don't know whether or not you ladies heard but the city is coming down real hard on people practicing unlawful carnal knowledge
So what are you trying to say, fella
'm trying to say that you're not just walk in that courtroom and get gonna slapped with a $50 fine and be back on the street turning tricks tonight
You both are going to do some time
About 30 days each
Unless, of course,we talk real business
So where do you want to do it, honey
You wanna hop up on the counter
No, we can go to the back room
Cates walks over and pulls him by the shoulder
We're on the move
Let's go
As they walk toward a corridor
Do you know how close  was to getting some trim
And you fucked' it up
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you
And  didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt
stop moaning
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl
We eat when  say we eat
Bullshit
ain't moving  till get something to eat
You've been treating me like shit ever since  came out here
If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye
And want some food some place nice
Some good people, nice music
Yeah, 'm hungry too
know of a place
Let's go eat
Yeah,  want mandolins, flowers
They move off down the corridor
- Cates and Hammond at a candy machine
Cates drops in a quarter, throws Hammond a candy bar
There's your God-damn dinner
Now, let's go
They move toward a row of parked cars
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut
Hammond gets in the car as Cates readjusts Elaine's scarf on the mirror
Must of been your lady friend
Cates frowns at him
(continuing) You really do have onoe, huh, Jack
what's her problem besides you
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population
She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off
Anyway, what the fuck do you care
Cates climbs in behind the wheel of the Cadillac
No, man, tell me about her
In jail they got me surrounded by guys wearin' blue suits twenty- four hours a day
And  ain't built for that
Really
With the clothes you got on you look like you'd love it
Cates takes a belt from his flask
Now, where we goin', convict
Mission District
Gonna find us an Indian
Cates starts the motor, slams it into gear
Accelerates out to the street
Cates and Hammon booming along in the Caddy
Come on, Jack
want to hear about your girl
When were you with her last
You get what mean
Smiles
Cates smiles back at him, almost cruelly don't give out the details
Last night, two nights ago, three
Cates keeps smiling
Last night
You have a good time
Pained expression on Cates' face as he comes back to reality
Sure
Then we had a fight this morning
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you
Tell me a little about her
She got great tits
Cates gives him a hard look
get the feeling it's going to be real long night
They keep driving
-  - The Cadillac drives slowly past a bar called Torchie's
Stops at the end of the block
Well
It's a long shot, but
Billy used to tend bar here a few years back
heard him talk about it
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in
Just back me up like you've got a piece
Back you up
Now why would wanna do that
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up
But you can handle it all right, huh
Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats
Bullshit
Attitude and experience get you through
Cates and Hammond step out, glance toward the bar
been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers
All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge
You need five years training to handle a joint like
Hamnond's had enough of this debate
Hey, you wanna bet
got two problems
Number one, 'm not playin' games
Number two, you got nothin' to bet with
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while  get laid
Why
Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway
That's never been one of my problems
Now, stop stallin', man, or else admit all this professional stuff you're talkin' about is a crock of shit
'll tell you what happens if you lose
you tell the truth for once
What are you talkin' about
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail
And whatever it is, you're part of it
don't know what you're talking about
just wanna see Ganz nailed
The bet's off
Hammond thinks it over
Okay, if  lose, 'll tell you anything you want to know
Cates reaches into his pocket
'm gonna enjoy this
here, 'll even loan you my badge
thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes
He takes the badge anyway as they head for the entrance
' They step inside
Hammond reacts to
Longhorns mounted over the bar, Rebel Flags, Lone Star Beer, armadillo posters
Even the waitresses wear Stetsons
Rockabilly pounding from the jukebox
Cowgirl Stripper is doing the grind on a small podium
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers
My kind of place
always liked country boys
Cates smiles, finds a table in the corner
Cowgirl comes over to take his order
Takes a deep breath, moves toward the bar
Smiles at the good ol' boys
They don't smile back
He sits down at the bar
Yeah
Vodka
Maybe you better have a Black Russian
No, man,  think 'll have a vodka
Hamnond looks around the room
places a glass in front of him, picks up the dollar as Harmond flashes Cates' shield
You know a big Indian named Billy Bear
He used to work here
The Bartender shakes his head, gives him a scowl
Never heard of him
Hammond lifts the shot glass and throws it through the mirror behind the bar
Sudden silence throughout the room
Now how's your memory doin'
Fuck off
don't know what the hell you're talkin' about
Maybe  better ask around, see what your pals think
don't give a shit who you ask
The Bartender walks down toward Cates
Moves away from the bar
He stops at a booth occupied by , one a very big man
Hammond grabs him by the arm and pulls him up
Up against the wall, cowboy
The Punk breaks free, aims a massive haymaker at Hammond
Gets a right to the stomach for his trouble
(continuing) Now,  said get over there by that wall
You hear me, motherfucker
Looks at the others
(continuing) Move it, rednecks
On your feet
He grabs the next by the arm, yanks him up
(continuing) Over there
move your ass
Some of you rednecks seem a little hard of hearing, so 'll repeat it for everybody
need word on the whereabouts of an Indian that goes by the name of Billy Bear
It's a police matter and you all look like you'd just love to cooperate
Quietly sips his beer
The other occupants of the bar watch Hammond herd the four Punks to the end wall
when Hammond isn't looking, he dashes toward the exit, Cates puts out a leg
Sends the Cowboy crashing into a crowdedtable
Turns around at the noise
(continuing) That wasn't necessary, buddy got this under control
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer
The Redneck Punks are now spread-eagled against the wall
Hammond searches the first
He drops a wallet on the floor and moves to the second
switchblade, some credit cards and another wallet fall to the floor
The last Punk has only a roll of bills
Hammond holds the money up to his face
You're in trouble, big trouble, so you better start talking
Where'd a boy like you make a score like this
It's mine, what the hell
You must a rolled somebody
They don't let punks like you take jobs that pay this much
you sure you don't know a dangerous Indian, because unless you start talkin' may just have to start looking down your pants with a flashlight
What kind of cop are you, anyway
am your most terrible nightmare a bad nigger with a badge that entitles him to kick your ass
Hammond turns to the Bartender
(continuing) One of them is under-age
Another attacked a police officer
And you know  ain't found what  came lookin' here for yet
Walks back to the Bartender
(continuing) The tall one had a weapon
you want me to keep on makin' a list, or you got the picture yet
He reaches for a towel under a pyramid of bar glasses
Jerks the towel, the pyramid capsizes onto the floor
Huge crash as the glasses break into a million fragments
(continuing) Looks like you're on your way to bein' outta business, redneck
Now, let's see what can we fuck with next
The Bartender doesn't have the look of a happy man
Okay, okay
The Indian hangs out with a girl down the block
Right where Chinatown starts
She lives on top of the hardware store
Hammond turns, grins at Cates
As far as he's concerned, he's won the bet
Cates nods, slips out the door
don't give a damn about his girl
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place
It's the only thing  know
He looks desperate
(continuing) 'm tellin' ya, 'm giving you all know
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and  won't have to hassle you
Turns to go, then turns back
(continuing) But remember this, cowboy, there's a new sheriff in town
Smiles, turns and goes
-   ' - Hammond steps out of the bar
He crosses to Cates by the car
think you got something for me
Pause
(continuing) The gun you took off that redneck in there
Hammond smiles
You made that move, huh
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too
Hammond reluctantly takes out a
22 automatic, slams it down on the hood of the car
(continuing) Credit cards
Hammond hands them over with the knife
You already got a gun and you owe me a piece of ass
'll settle for the gun you just took
long moment
Then Cates slowly lifts the
22 automatic
You did a real good job
Guess you deserve a reward
Removes the clip
Throws it across the street
Hands Hammond the automatic
Motherfucker
He throws the gun away
sure am
Now let's go get us an Indian
They walk up the block
-  - Neon signs with Sino lettering
Walk down the street, spot a shop with a window display of tools
Look up at the darkened apartment windows
They walk to the end of the block
Stairwells lead to each apartment above the shops
Cates and Hammond move along the buildings
Arrive at the back of the hardware store
Quietly, they start to ascend the stairs
The metal steps extend onto a platform by the back door
Cates leans over the railings to look through the adjacent window
Between the drawn curtains, a flickering glimmer from a  set
On the tube, various poses from stridently exercising women
What the shit is that
Looks again
female form passes by, goes out of the room
There
Must be billy's girl
Come on
Cates gestures to the door lock
Hammond fiddles with it for several moments
The door swings open
They step into a darkened room
Cates takes the
38 from his pocket
He stops near the open bedroom doorway
He looks at Hammond and then both men step quickly into the room
Police
Nobody move
Hammond reaches for the light switch
Takes a heavy blow
Slumps against the door
Woman's voice screams out
(continuing) Stay where you are
The light goes on
Cates' gun points at a   () in a flimsy dressing gown
Saturday Night Special held between her palms, police style
() stands beside Hammond at the light switch
Larger and slightly older than the first, she wears a man's shirt
Holds a baseball bat in her right hand
You better drop it or he's gonna get another one
Hey, talk to here jack
don't feel like gettin' number two along side of the head
said police
Now drop the goddamn gun
Don't give me that police shit
You drop it
Pause
Okay, look, don't shoot
'm just reachin' for my badge
Cates takes out his badge-Shows it to Casey
don't like this bullshit
've seen fake badges before
'll tell you something lady, this guy is a real nervous cop - He's just liable to pull the trigger
Cates takes two steps toward Casey
Naw, 'm the calm type
know you don't want me to shoot you, and  know that you don't want to shoot me
He takes two more steps toward her
(continuing) Shooting a cop puts you away for a long time
Holds out his hand
You assholes better be real
She hands Cates the gun
Sally prods Hammond with the baseball bat
Just wait a Goddamn second here, let's see your badge
He snatches the bat out of her hands
Don't have one
knew it
Call the cops
Casey walks over to the phone
Tell them it's Cates, Detective 31st District
Then put your clothes on
If you don't answer some questions 'm taking both your asses in
After a moment, Casey puts down the phone
(continuing) Now, let's cut out the crap, which one of you sees Billy Bear
None of your business, cop
The son of a bitch isn't here, and he isn't coming back
You can do better than that
Turns to Casey
(continuing) How about it
used to go with him
don't know where the hell he is haven't seen him for two weeks
And  don't think  will
He owes me money
He's a Goddamn lowlife, the way he treated her
Sounds like a real stormy romance
don't much care what it sounds like to you, Cop
All  know is that  went a few laps around the track with him and  ended up with nothin' but the short end of the stick
Cates looks over at Hammond
Let's go
Wait a minute
Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us
How about it
been nearly three years in prison and
Fuck off
Come on
Hannond starts for the door with Cates
If you find that bastard, Billy, tell him to stay out of my life
don't need any more of his macho bullshit
- The two men walk among the bright neon lights
Neither of them very happy
This sucks
maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it
So, instead of me being where oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, 'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you
You wanna leave, man
Let me take care of Ganz all by myself
You
Don't make me laugh
You can't take care of shit
You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt
All you're good for is games
So far, what  got outta you is nothin'
'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night
Luther knew more than he told me and so do you
Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about
gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin'
long look at Hammond
Maybe  don't like the way you ask
Who gives a Goddamn what you think
You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass
You're not even a name anymore
Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues
They walk past
' - They two men walk toward the Cadillac
Okay, Reggie, 'm done playing around
want to know what's going on and 'm going to beat the living shit out of you until you tell me
Hammond goes into a street rap
You beat the shit out of me
Don't make me laugh, sucker
You don't know how 'd dance on your face
'll hit you so hard, so many times, you'll wish you'd never been hatched
'll turn your face into cottage cheese
'll make your girl think you been takin' ugly pills
She won't even know who you are, sucker
They stop by the car
Cates takes the gun out, lays it on the hood
Hammond stares at him
Cates next takes out his wallet, shows Hammond his badge, then lays the badge on the car fender
Smiles
guess the first thing  ought, to explain to you, nigger, is fight dirty
Hits Hammond a tremendous right hand full in the face
Hammond sags, grabs onto the car fender for support
Cates hesitates
and Hammond kicks out, sending the partially open car door slamming into Cates
Cates sprawls
So do
Hammond aims a kick at Cates' head
Cates blocks it with crossed forearms, grabs, twists
Hammond tumbles, rolls away from Cates
Both men struggle to their feet, circle each other
Hammond moves in only to receive twoquick blows from Cates, a bit sooner than he expected
Cates smiles
Hammond dances in and out
Cates' breathing becomes more labored
His windmill attack penetrates Cates' defense
Cates clears his head, charges, bull-like
His rush and greater bulk send both of them crashing into some trash cans and a brick wall
Hammond is faster
Cates is much stronger; Both men on their knees
They look at one another
Silently, they move to their feet
Hammond's back is to a wall
Cates keeps him there, negates the lighter man's agility
They slug away, each now arm-weary
Exchange a dozen blows
Finally, Cates steps back, arms at his side
Breath coming like a bellows
Hammond has to hold on to the wall; one more punch would put him out
Now, you bastard, you going to tell me what's going on
Puffing away
(continuing) Do  have to kick the shit out of you some more
They stand facing one another
Hammond smiles
black-and- white comes roaring up the street
Sirens howling, red lights flashing, it slides to a stop
jump out, guns drawn
All right, you two
Don't move
, no
it's okay
'm police
Yeah, sure
Get your hands above your head
He keeps his gun trained on Cates,and Hammond
My gun and badge are over there
And 'm too fucking tired to raise my hands
Hammond rubs the side of his face
Cates falls back against the patrol car
Still fighting for breath
The First Cop lifts Cates' wallet off the Cadillac and looks at his badge, shows it to the other cop
What the hell's going on here
Cates walks over, pockets his gun
've got a burglary call
Two women say a couple of hoods broke into their place posing as cops
was following a lead
We rousted them
Go up and sweet talk 'em
You can straighten it out
The First Cop checks out Cates' badge and
Why don't you do it
We got better things to do than straighten out your messes
So do
'll file a report tomorrow
The First Cop takes out his book, starts writing
He's pissed
gotta file a
Report tonight asshole
Goes with the territory
He grabs Hammond and they head for the Cadillac
- Cadillac parked behind the service area
Hammond looks' up at his bruised face in the mirror, then washes up
Cates is one step ahead of him
He rolls up a piece of the wet towel and inserts it over his bleeding gum
Too bad we got interrupted when we did
was getting ready to finish you off
Cates straightens up from the wash basin
Yeah, right
You want to try again
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time
They saved your ass, convict
One thing's for sure, Jack
That's how you'll tell the story
Cates dries off his face, starts out of the washroom
'll even put it in my report that way
The door closes behind Cates
Hammond leans back toward the mirror, nudges a tooth with his finger
Motherfucker
Cates leans on the Cadillac as Hammond emerges
Hammond starts for the passenger side
Wait a minute
Hammond stops
(continuing) You come clean or we're going to go again
Right here, right now
Pause
long moment; Hammond decides be has no choice
been waiting a long time for some money
How much
Half a million
Jesus
Hammond smiles his meanest smile
How's that for a number to give you heart failure
Guess you might start to get the picture after all
Mlaybe you're on the wrong side of the old law and order business
Cates is unmoved
Just tell me about the money
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale
It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen
was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job
Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun
He's after your money
You catch on real fast
Okay, Jack, let's talk deal
How much of my money you gonna let me keep
Cates just looks at him
(continuing) We split 50-50
Not likely, convict
You gonna let me keep any of it
Depends on how things work out believe in the merit system
So far you haven't built up any points
He smiles
Okay, from now on, 'm gonna be real good, Jack
Cates smiles back
Where's the money
In the trunk of a car
lot better than under a mattress, right
Cates smiles
Right, partner
Get this
We ain't partners
We ain't brothers
We ain't friends
If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met
Yeah
Right
They get into the Caddy
Boom away
The Cadillac moving through the city
Clock on the dashboard showing 4 a
m
Cates at the wheel
(continuing) Where's the goddamn car
You're a real case, you know that, Jack
Smiles
(continuing) This'll show you how smart  am
got it parked
For three years
Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone
You just drove by it
The Cadillac makes a screeching -turn,i swings into the curb
Cates leans out, looks at
Narrow, multi-storied, with a garage-like opening and signals
proclaiming 'Weekly-Monthly-Long Term
" Okay, now what
Hammond gets out of the car
Stands on the sidewalk
Stretches
Then gets into the back seats
Since you're wired on benniest you get to stay up and stare at the building
'm  tired, so 'm going to sleep
They take Sunday off
Place opens at seven o'clock Monday morning
Wake me up at a quarter till
Cates stares at the place
You son of a bitch
You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait
almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing
wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther
You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack
Shit
Beyond the skyline, grey streaks of dawn etch the sky
The Cadillac is pulled up facing the streets down the block from the parking sections Cates walks in through the lot entrance
Threads his way between the lines of parked vehicles Tired and haggard, he carries a paper bag filled with quick-order food
Hammond stretches on the back seat
Cates slams the door shut
don't want you sleeping on the job
Hammond yawns, eases himself into a sitting position
The place opens in five minutes
Ganz ought to be here soon
Cates tears the paper bag open
Passes a cup of coffee and donut back
He sips his own coffee, adds some whiskey from his flask
pops another bennie
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time
Not really
figured Ganz was put down for a long time
And knew Luther would never job me on his own
He's too chickenshit
Guess what
Luther just got in line
Hammond sits up
What
Musta got some primo bondsman
Jesus Christ
That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours
tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door
Luther walks up to the window where a bored  reads a comic book
Yeah
want to pick up my car
He passes across a faded form
Name
Hammond
The Attendant examines the form, surprised
This is three years old
Yeah, 've been busy
The Attendant opens a key file, begins rummaging in it
We don't wash 'em, ya know
How about chargin' the battery
That we do
And we put air in the tires
'll even sell you some gas if you need it
Great, just great
The Attendant finds the key, exits the booth
Luther follows to an elevated stack of cars
The Attendant throws a switch, the stack of cars begins to move
Luther drives down the exit ramp in a dated Porsche convertible
The car is covered with a uniform coat of dust, except for the windshield which has been wiped hastily clean
Luther waits for a break in the flow of traffic, drives out
Another street Luther turns onto a side street and then suddenly Cate's Cadillac appears
starts to tail the Porsche
Cates follows Luther through several turns
The Porsche jerks whenever it speeds up or slows down
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car
why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs
had no choice
Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac
The Caddy follows the Porsche
As they follow Luther
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed
Tryin' to save his girl, man
He's in another world
If  was his size and had Ganz on my ass, 'd  just leave town
'm tellin' you the man's in love
he wants to be a hero for his girl
Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid
The Caddy follows the Porsche
As they follow Luther
suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you
let women get to me
The quest for pussy is the meaning of life got my own personal philosophy about 'em
Keep women separate from guns, money and business
women are for spending money
They got nothing to do with helping you make it
That ain't philosophy
That's common sense
The Caddy follows the Porsche
As they follow Luther
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther
If they don't tell me what  need to know
Doesn't it get
Tiring
'm not in this 'cause it's fun
'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either do it 'cause it works-
You got a very depressing view of life, man
you gotta smile once in awhile
The Caddy follows the Porsche
As they follow Luther
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money
If he's hoping that then he's dumber than  think he is, which would be amazin', cause  already think he's real dumb
The Caddy follows the Porsche
As they follow Luther
long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain
that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy
The Caddy follows the Porsche
As they follow Luther, You know, 'd be embarrassed if let my wheels go the way you've done with this job
What you don't understand is, don't give a damn about how this thing looks
No class
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk
Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife
The Caddy follows the Porsche
As they follow Luther
We're getting too close
Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb
But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you
Luther pulls over to curb and parks
suddenly swings over several lanes of traffic and parks in driveway of parking lot
-  & '
He goes to the trunk
Rummages there
picks up a flaming red suit
That Goddamn suit is yours
Hammond winces
That was in style a couple years back, man
Right
if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set
Under the suit is a nondescript attache case
Luther takes it, closes the trunk
Beads down the sidewalk
That's the money, Jack
They jump out of the car, follow on foot
Luther hurries along the sidewalk
He reaches the corner, turns quickly
Following a little way behind
They pause at the corner, watching the pedestrian traffic move by
Then turn down the cross street after Luther
Follow him down a stairwell
- Escalators and open stairwells
Luther enters and pauses by the doorway
Commuters crowd the counters and congregate near the stairwells
More people are seated along hard plastic seats
But no Ganz
And no Billy
Luther moves further into the station
Cates and Hammond enter
They keep Luther fixed between them, 50 feet ahead
Luther seems to be wandering He walks through the shop area and back toward the escalator
Hammond remains near the arcade while Cates blends in with the commuters
Luther puts the briefcase down at his feet and leans against a counter
Next to him, a loud troop of Boy Scouts marches by
crowd of people from the train area below flows through the lobby obscuring Luther from Hammond and Cates for a moment
Cates steps out to get a better view and suddenly spots Ganz moving through the crowd toward Luther
Be looks over at Hammond across the station and motions
Then they both start moving in on Ganz, trying to intercept him before he gets deeper into the crowd
Ganz moves cautiously through the station
crumpled newspaper held absently in his hand
He scans the faces of the commuters and spots Luther
Fails to notice Cates and Hammond closing in on him from two directions
comes up
Starts chatting amiably with a Boy Scout next to Luther
Ganz hesitates in his approach
He motions Luther to move awaye, but Luther starts to panic when he sees Cates and Hammond closing in
Ganz reacts to Luther, turns and spots the two men
He makes an immediate break for open ground
The Patrolman sees Ganz start to run
The newspaper is thrown to the floor
Ganz swings Cates'
44 toward Hammond
Hey--you
Ganz whirls, his feet slipping on the marble floor
His shot at Hammond goes plowing into the ceiling
The crowd starts to panic and run in all directions
The Patrolman has al ready brought his own gun out
Levels it at Ganz
(continuing) Put it down
Suddenly appears, Rosalie at his side
Billy Bear's
44 blasts the Patrolman onto his back
Ganz comes up and scrambles through the screaming patrons
He, Billy and Rosalie head toward the escalator
Cates has already brought out his
38
Can't get a clean shot through the chaos
Hammond pushes his way through the crowd to Cates
Shoot the sons of bitches
Cates can't risk it
(continuing) You don't want to chance it, then give me the gun
moment
(continuing) Bullshit
Then i'm staying with the money
You stay with me
No way
Hammond starts after Luther
Cates turns, starts to aim at Hammond
Hesitates
Panic has overtaken everyone as they try to escape the madman with the gun
Ganz and Billy elbow and kick their way through the crowd, tugging Rosalie along
Cates, gun in hand, creates further-panic as he moves after Ganz
Ganz grabs a man beside him
Shoves him hard into the passengers in back
The man knocks over several more people creating a roadblock
Ganz vaults over the railing and starts for the trains
Cates loses a few more precious seconds grappling through the terrorized passengers
The usually jammed area looks like an empty stockyard
The patrons huddle in fear against any available wall
Cates bursts out of the stairwell
Red and green signal lights
The light goes red, a train roars up and the doors hiss open
Billy and Ganz fight through the passengers getting off the train, jump on board; Billy pulls Rosalie behind him
Running for the doors
Suddenly, a   appears, riot gun in hand
Freeze
No
No
There they are
Just put it down real slow
The train doors close
'm a policeman, you asshole
Don't even try
now drop it or - you're all done
He means it, points the riot gun even closer
The train in front of him moves away
Cates carefully places the
38 on the pavement
Then raises his hands in the air
Shit
- Witnesses stand in nervous little knots
Give versions of what happened to notepad-toting patrolmen
Hospital Attendants minister to various and sundry complaints
Cates sits on a passenger bench, obviously dejected voice comes echoing from behind
Cates
Haden, silhouetted against the light from the street
(continuing) What the bell happened
lost them, that's what happened
How did they get away
They ran
As fast as they could
Caught a train
Haden watches the Morgue Personnel wheel out the body of the Patrolman
Which one pulled the trigger
The Indian
was about 30 yards away
You couldn't get to him
Cates shrugs
(continuing) What a screw-up
Right
screwed up
fucked up
messed up
Anybody could have done better, especially you
bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds
Haden starts toward the street
Looks back at Cates
Don't duck the bullet Cates
Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play
didn't have the time
Too bad, it would've covered your ass
Now you're in the shit and so's the department
In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour
told you everyone was watchin' on this one
Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike
Cates looks at Haden for a moment
Turns and walks away
- Hammond across the street from Predmore
Standing in a phone booth talking into the receiver
He turns and looks acain at the hotel
Hangs up
Walks into a nearby bar
' Punk Dancers all over the floor
rock group blasting away
(" " - Vocal) At a back booth
() approaches carrying a small suitcase
How you doing, man
Not bad, not bad
Puts the suitcase down on the table
(continuing) You want to go outside
Naw, right here's okay
Dancers sliding and jerking in front of them
You sure
'm sure
Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass
Sosna pops open the suitcase
Lid shielding the contents from the patrons
got some real nice merchandise
All of it's clean
Suitcase arranged like q salesman's display case
Tightly spaced rows of handguns mounted in their holsters
like this one
Pockets a revolver with a deft move
(continuing) How about some ammo
It's loaded
got some shells in here
Opens another compartment
Hammond helps himself to two boxes
How much
This is clean shit
No serial numbers and never been used
Don't mess with me
How much
Five bills
Five
On credit
This ain't a credit business
You know that
Yeah,  know that, but this is me and we're old friends
haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it
Give it back
Try and take it
long moment
Fuck you
You got no right for this kind of play
'll got your money to you
No sweat
Hammonds heads for the bar
Stands next to a good-looking woman ()
Nods to the barkeep
(continuing) Vodka
With a twist
And  want to run a tab
Served up
He knocks half of it back, turns to the woman
(continuing) My name's Reggie Hammond
Big personality smile
So what
She turns away as he takes a drink
He looks at another pretty girl ()
Hi there
'm Reggie Hammond
'm with somebody
She turns away
This ain't my night
He drinks up
- Several Detectives are working at desks
Kehoe walks into the office
He moves slowly to Cates' desk and slumps down in a nearby chair
You look awful
So do you
been a long day
Long night, too, from what  heard Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong
Doesn't look like it
Nothing came in for me yet
No calls
Nothing
Kehoe's phone begins to ring
Cates watches hopefully
(continuing) Kehoe
Okay, hang on
Offers the phone to Cates
(continuing) It's for you
Ordinance
Cates' excitement vanishes
He takes the receiver
Kehoe begins to clean off his desk
Hello
Yeah, okay
'll be in tomorrow
That's right, you can depend on it
Okay
He slams down the receiver, leans back in the chair
(continuing) Bullshit red tape
'm heading out
How about you
Cates shakes his head
got to wait for a call
Okay
See you in the morning
you know, you ought to get some rest
He walks out the door
Cates stares fixedly at the phone on the desk
Hoping Hammond will call
Across the room another phone starts to ring
Cates stares at the  who answers
Yeah, he's here
Cates stiffens
(continuing) Cates
line twelve
Cates snatches up the phone, shouts into it
You motherfucker, where are you
In the Chronicle Restaurant and Bar, a well appointed establishment off Montgomery Street
'm at work, asshole
Where else
Elaine
'm sorry
was expecting somebody else
police business
No wonder you're so popular
No, it's 'm just surprised you called
So am
Jack, this afternoon
Hey, look, when
You first
Look, 'm sorry about
the way things have been lately
know haven't been acting real great
Behind Cates, Kehoe steps back into the room
Hey, Cates
Cates swings around
(continuing) almost forgot
That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him
What
Jack, are you still there
Yeah
He said he rousted a bar with you last night
Jesus Christ
Why the hell didn't you tell me before
'm not paid to take your personal calls
He was in some bar
off duty
Cates interrupts
The number
what's the Goddamn number
Jack
What was that
Find it yourself
It's on my desk
Cates speaks back into the receiver
Elaine,  gotta put you on hold
Jack, wait
Just a second, that's all
He hits the bold button, starts rummaging through the desk
Paperwork scatters in all directions
Kehoe watches him in silence for awhile then leaves
Cates begins to dial
(continuing) Hammond
you son of a bitch, where are you
Listens for a moment
' Hammond on the phone as the band rocks away
( - Track only) Hey, Jack, how ya doin'
What took you so long to call, man
been waitin'
'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore
Yeah, Vroman's
'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers
'll be there in a minute
You don't move your ass, right
Slams down the phone
Starts toward the door
Remembers
He dashes back to the phone, hits the other line
Hears only a buzz
(continuing) Oh, shit
' Band blasting away on another number ( - ) Hammond now in the middle of the floor dancing his ass off with a girl named
As the song ends
My name's Reggie Hammond
Tries his big personality smile
This time gets one back
'm candy
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, 'm gonna bust
You interested
Hey, what kind of talk is that
Oh
You're a schoolteacher
No,  go to a school to learn how to do hair
It's a government program
But really  want to be a model - and  am definitely not sellin'
(humorously) Goodbye
She stops him
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way
He gives her a kiss
You're in a hurry
Yeah, i been waiting three years
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'
No, baby, nothin' like that
Look, there's a place across the street
We can go right over there
What's the matter with my place
No, it's gotta be here and now
Believe me
Only  don't have the damn money for a room
The band starts up again
("    " - ) Yeah, well, even us non-pros expect the guy to pay for the room
Cates suddenly appears
steps between them
Yells above the band's noise
Where's luther
Be polite
Say hello
This is Candy
Hello
And goodbye
She looks at Hammond
He nods
Well, maybe 'll see you later
Here's hoping, baby
Candy leaves and melts into the crowd on the dance floor
What about Luther
What about Ganz
Cates shrugs
We missed
You missed
Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street
Made a phone call
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit
Let him get some sleep
He's going to need it
They move to the bar
(continuing) They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign
He's trading his girl for the money
All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind
So you took the rest of the night off
Hammond smiles
We don't have too many cheerleaders in prison
though might indulge myself in a little trim
Cates orders two drinks
Tell me something
Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split
Forget it
want Ganz as bad as you do and  got some other news for you
He opens his jacket slightly
Reveals a shoulder holster and accompanying
45
long moment
don't know why, but 'm going to let you keep it
Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because 'm too tired to argue
You sure that's the reason
Pause
Thanks for callin' in
and guess Maybe
Look, 'm sorry called you Watermellon nigger
those kinds of things
was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack
Yeah
Guess not
Hammond gives him a big smile
As long as you're feeling like Abe Lincoln, how about payin' me on our bet
We got time and all this pussy around here's drivin' me crazy
See that one over there, the one  was with
He nods at Candy across the way
Yeah,  see her
can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel
All need is some money for the room
(continuing) Big smile as Cates produces some cash
Hammond counts it eagerly
Looks around
Candy suddenly appears like a trout seeing a lure
She grabs the money
Hello, again
just struck it rich
think we can do a little business
As a matter of fact,  think we can have a party
Hammond smiles, leads her out of the bar
Hurry back
Cates watches them go, downs his drink
He fishes in his pocket for a coin, moves to a wall phone
Dials
- answers the phone as Elaine pours a drink
It's for you
Hands her the receiver
Hello
Hi, it's me
Fuck you
She slams down the receiver
-   ' - Hammond and Candy exit the rock club
line of young Punkers waiting to get inside
Hammond and Candy are in a tight clinch, a little giggly
So
what did you have in mind
Suddenly, Hammond sees Luther emerge from the Predmore across the street
Oh no, not now
Luther moves down the street with the briefcase
Hammond pulls Candy back inside Vroman's
'   - Rock group still blasting away
( - Vocal continues) Hammond and Candy reappear, knocking aside a waitress about to refill Cates' drink
That was quick
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long
Let's go
Why
Luther's on the move
Cates jumps up, runs out
Hammond looks at Candy
(continuing) 'll be back
Trust me
He kisses her
Runs off after Cates
She stares at him in disbelief
Luther checking over his shoulder for shadows, walks down the block
Turns into a narrow street
Luther waits, impatient
Checks his watch
Looks up and down the street
He double-checks the bus stop sign over his head
Just as a bus pulls to a stop, air brakes hissing
Gets in
Sees that the driver is Billy Bear
The bus starts up
Luther hesitates in the front
On the wide rear seat is Ganz
Rosalie beside him
Open your coat
Both sides
He shows he's not packed
Let her go
First, the money
Luther takes a step
(continuing) Just show me
Luther puts the case on a side seat, opens it for display
Commuters look up expectantly
One of two drift toward the curb
Jump back in alarm as the bus roars by
Ganz is satisfied
Luther closes the case
Rosalie, you okay
What are you talkin' about
said wouldn't hurt her
And then he shoots Luther
Right between the buttons
(continuing) never break my word
Laughs as Rosalie begins to scream
' Barreling down the street, ignoring red lights
Hammond shouts over the wind
Notice something funny about that bus
Yeah
It missed the last four stops
Cates pours on the gas
His eyes fall on the rear view mirror
white Caddy dances in the vibrating glass
Billy looks over his shoulder at Ganz
Ganz
Swerves into cross traffic, makes a big press forward
Comes abreast of the driver's side of the bus
Smashes a side window with the two handguns
Blasts away
Cates driving with one hand as he draws his gun
Looks up as glass shards sparkle down
He speeds up
he is neck and neck with the bus
Hammond has a clear shot of Billy Bear who gives a side glance at him; Hammond doesn't shoot
Cates slows down and fires
Billy is hit in the shoulder
Ganz runs up and fires again
Hammond is hit in the arm
Cates grabs Hammond by the shirt
Yanks him close
Throws the wheel over
Swerves as bullets pepper the passenger side
Stuffing flies out of Hammondis still warm seat
The right hand windows explode
Then the Caddy spins out
Roars away
Skids into a traffic sign, demolishing some newspaper machines
Cates curses, tries to start the car
The engine won't turn over
He looks at the distant bus
Goddamn
Goddamn
Goddamn
Pounds on the dash
What's left of the windshield falls in at the impact
- Cates at his desk
Hammond seated nearby, now with a bandaged arm
Haden in front of Cates, furious
bus, you goddamn whiskey mick cop, you lost a stolen bus
We got five deaths related to Ganz, all of 'em law enforcement related, and you blow it for a lousy nigger convict
Cates says nothing
(continuing) That's rights  called him a nigger
You bet  did
saw the report on that little piece of shit
If he spent one legal day in his whole life, it'd be a record
This is it for you
suspension, review board
you've had it
When it gets 'round you protect a con rather than nail a cop killer
Cates stands up
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop 've worked with
Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me
How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh
Cates stands
Moves to Hammond
Handcuffs himself to him
(continuing) Where the Christ do you think you're going
'm taking my prisoner back to jail
Hammond looks at Haden
Goin' a little hard on him, aren't you
Go fuck yourself convict
You know for a man, you have very pretty brown eyes
Cates and Hammond walk out
-   - Cates and Hammond walk stoically along a row of cars, arrive at Hammond's Porsche
Hey, how'd my car get here
had it impounded
Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam
Back to jail in my own car
Ganz got away
Got all my money
It just don't seem right
don't know about you, but could use a drink
'll buy you one
It'll be my good-bye present
Takes off Hammond's cuffs
Looks at them
Throws them away
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack
feel like  let you down
Naw, you didn't let me down
It was a long shot all the way
We gave 'em a good run at it
Yeah, but we didn't get 'em
They get in and drive off
- The Porsche blasts by
These men want a drink
- Cates and Hammond walk in
It's late, the place is almost empty
The Bartender is a woman with her back to them conferring with a waitress about something
It's late, they're closing
Don't worry about it
The barmaid turns around to take their order
It's Elaine
Hey,  don't believe it
Hiya, kid
ought to have you and your friend thrown out
Don't
We've had a hard night
can see that
Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit
What happened
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours
Hammond looks at her
He nudges Cates
Who the hell are you
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond
heard a lot about you
And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine
Gives her a big smile
'm not so sure  can say the same thing
You don't look like a cop
Well,  been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years
And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress
Shrink major, not a shrink
She pours three glasses of cognac
at the end of the bar pipes up
Hey, lady, a drink here
We're closed
Hey, what the hell
Elaine turns to him; it's short and sweet
Drink your drink, pay up and get out
You can't do this
It's against
Hey, just fuck off
My friends have guns
Cates holds up his pistol
The man's eyes widen and he turns his angry move toward her into a skedaddle out of the bar
Elaine finishes drying a glass and approaches
(continuing) You real down
've been better
Dead end
No Ganz, no Indian
He finishes his drink, puts down the glass
(continuing) gotta call the station
Looks back at Hammond
(continuing) Don't run off anywhere, okay
've already got enough to worry about
Moves away
Hard man to live with
How would you know
Hey, two days with him is enough
That's no bull
She looks at him carefully
They both grin
In the phone booth
Is there any report
No
Just tell me
nothing
Yeah figured
Okay, sure
Hangs up
Cates returns
Nothing
No sign of Ganz
No sign of the Indian
Airport's clean
Train station
Bus station
Docks
Shit
Ganz is going to be hard to track
Just a pure schizo
wires all crossed
totally without any pattern
kill anybody
The Indian
himself
anybody
How do you know
Jack, it's all over the papers
He's an obvious type
But this Indian
Hammond cuts in
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend
He was loyal, went all the way for you
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me
The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend
Have you two ace detectives checked that out
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet
They both looked mad enough to kill him
Yeah, too bad
They were real nice lookin' too
In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions was in bed with a girlfriend watching  last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is happen not to be a lesbian
Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him
So what
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over
They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out
She's got a point there, Jack
Smiles
Cates reflects for a moment
It's the only thing we got
He looks at Elaine
(continuing) Whaddya think
What do  know
'm just a bartender
Let's go, Reggie
He kisses Elaine
Do  get to kiss her too
If she's right, and if you don't screw up
They exit the bar
-  - Cates and Hammond hidden in a doorway which affords them a good view of the alley landing to Casey and Sally's apartment
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit
mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro
've got to play it rough with them
If they know anything, 'm gonna know it
woman appears, turning out to be Casey carrying a shopping bag
Hey, there she is
Whatever play  maker just back me up
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in
Sure, 'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine
You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps
Yeah, and  know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart
wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started
Partnership
Well, you got to admit we come a long way
Cates gives him a smile
Let's just do it
As Casey opens the door and starts toward the
stairs, Cates and Hammond come through the door and grab her
They are now on the ground floor stairwell
hear you've got visitors
Would you guys
No time for any of that crap any more, lady
'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast
Cates has her by the shoulder and arm; he twists her like a vise
He means it
She looks at Cates, knows Hammond's correct
Don't kill him
Please, just don't kill him
long moment
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls
You always were his girls
Yeah
Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be
You're gonna help us take him
No chance
He can live or die
You let us in and he's got a chance to make it
Otherwise, he gets ventilated
Casey's face is seared with pain at the thought of Billy dying
If you help use he's got a chance, lady
Billy's in the first room off the hall
With rosalie
He's makin' her happy tonight
You don't understand about the way it is with him, do ya
Where's ganz
In the back
Down the other corridor
Cates looks at Reggie
Looks like you're gonna get your chance
They move upward
- Cates is stealthily going to the end of the second corridor of the kitchen and living room area
That corridor turns at a sharp angle and goes to the back
Hammond is at the very front of that first corridor
at a door
he shoves it back
There is a bed and  Rosalie, undressed, is in it
Billy is seated on the edge of it
pants on, shirt off, pulling on his boots
Suddenly, Hammond is pointing a gun at him
Give it up, Billy
You got no shot at it
Billy stands
Don't let him hurt met Billy
You're not gonna let 'em hurt me, are ya
He won't hurt you
He ain't gonna do nothin' to you, he's just after me
'm tellin' ya, Billy, give it up
never was much for bein' rehabilitated
Billy looks at Hammond
With lightning sudden quickness, he reaches and produces a huge Bowie knife from behind his back
Billy smiles, laughs
then with a sudden, awful roar, he leaps at Hamnond who unflinchingly fires his pistol
The big slugs stop Billy cold and throw him back against the bed as Rosalie shrieks
Ganz, half-dressed, asleep, gun in hand, throws himself off the bed, pushes Sally out of the way
opens the door and starts firing furiously down the corridor
He grabs the briefcase and runs to the window
/ Cates has ducked the bullets
he is inching toward the door
He pulls it open
Ganz from the window fires another shot which almost gets him then vanishes down the fire escape
Sally gets to her feett yelling, runs at Cates as he appears and futilely tries to hit him
He throws her down on the bed as if she were a doll
He goes to the window
Ganz peels down the fire escapes hits the ground
He stops for a second
Then Cates appears, Ganz fires a shot then starts to run
Cates keeps coming
Hammond hears the gunfire, runs out of the room
Dives down the fire escape
Hammond enters to find it empty of Ganz and Cates, only Sally crying hysterically
He runs out
Ganz runs out the back alley
Cates pursues
Hammond runs down the stairs toward the front of the building
Ganz runs, turns out of an alley onto a street baked with neon light
Cates pursues
' Hammond runs out, turns down the adjoining street
Following Ganz, holding him in sight, but unable to get a shot off
Hammond running down a street near the one where Ganz is being chased
Cates fires at Ganz
Ganz ducks in a doorway
on his street hears the shot
he runs toward it, down a narrow alley between two buildings
Ganz hears footsteps approach from the opposite direction of Cates
They move very close to where be is crouched
it is Hammond coming toward him
Ganz suddenly rolls a garbage can in his path, dropping him like a stone
Comes toward where he expects to find Ganz
Ganz has his arm around Hammond's throat and his gun to his ear
Drop it
you come up against me, you're gonna lose
Hammond drops his gun
(continuing) Hey, cop, come on
l got something for ya
come on
Cates comes out of the doorway from which he's fired
and comes into the middle of the street, gun up
he puts it down when he sees Ganz with Hammond in jeopardy
The hand that's around Hammond's throat also holds the black bag
Cates walks forward, his gun down at his side
After  get outta this, cop
'm gonna live forever
don't think you're gonna make it
Whaddya mean
got your gun
got his money
got everything
Give up
He's crazy
He'll kill us both
Cates still walking
He won't try it
He's a fucking chickenshit cop
They're all fucking wimps, right, Cates
They are now closer to each other
Ganz holding Hammond and the money
(continuing) Okay, cop
give me your gun and 'll let him live
Come on, Cates, you're real good at giving up your gun
Cates keeps the same methodical pace
Sure
Suddenly, he crouches and fires twice
Hammond twists as Ganz also fires
Ganz is hit in the collarbone and driven ten feet backward
His grip on Hammond drops, Hammond dives to the ground, looks at Cates
Jesus Christ,  didn't think you'd really do it
You are crazy
Ganz' gun still in his hand, but his arm useless at his side
Cates is frozen in the crouch, ready to fire again
Ganz is in enormous pain holding his bleeding chest
look of childish disbelief passes over his face
got hit
can't believe it got shot
You're done
End of story
ain't gonna beg for my life
It ain't cool
He runs at Cates full-speed, screaming, roaring, then is stopped by two more bullets that tear fist-sized holes in his chest
Cates rises from his crouch
Takes his gun out of Ganz' now lifeless hand
Then goes over to Hammond
Yours
Cates raises the pistol
Mine
Pause
(continuing) You okay
Yeah
But  wasn't there for a second
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own
Hammond smiles
Just tryin' to get the money, Jack
Just tryin' to build up a few points on that merit system
Cates smiles back, picks up the black bag as they move off
' Cates in the tub, steam rushing from the water
Elaine sits on the porcelain edge as he splashes and soaps
How'd they take it back at headquarters
Usual bullshit
You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend
You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks
Especially compared to this
've been waiting a long time to hear you say that
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works
He reaches out, lifts his watch from his pile of clothes on the floor
(continuing) Three more hours
Where is he
Promised 'd turn my back while he
ah, never mind
Tell me
He's takin' care of the same business 'll be takin' care of - soon as  dry off
Elaine smiles, leans close
You're impossible
That's what  always say
'  - Minimal crummy hotel room accommodations
Hammond is kissing her at the door, finishing buttoning all his buttons
He reaches for a wallet, gives her several bills
Here you go, baby
Hey, don't do that
said wasn't a pro, remember
Hey, no, 'm tryin' to be nice
Buy yourself something pretty
'd do it, but  got to go
got this cop waitin' for me
They kiss
it's pretty romantic
She opens the door for him
She stands at the top of the stairs; as Hammond walks down, he calls back to her over his shoulder
'll be back in six months
Maybe 'll make an honest woman of you
He gives her a big sniile
(continuing) 'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco
how'd that be
Then we'll go dancin', okay
Now you're talkin'
See ya
He moves off, still smiling, holding the black briefcase
- on a picturesque hill above the Haight
Cates standing near the wheel of Hammond's Porsche
Hammond comes down the porch steps from the hotel
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops
Tell me how great you were with that chick
Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit
but  was fantastic
As a riatter of fact,  was so good,  may have my cock done in bronze
Cates holds up the black briefcase
guess this is what you want to talk about
All the pretty money that's inside here
Cates takes the case to the trunk, opens it, deposits the case, locks the trunk
Wait a minute, Cates
've been waitin' three years for that don't think it's fair, man
What about the merit system
You were gonnna give me a few thousand
There's nothin' to talk about
Another long exchange of looks
Then be hands Hammond the keys to the trunk
(continuing) It's your money
It'll be here in six months when you get out
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash
That's right
Not my style, Reggie
You are an awesomely weird cop
Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here
No, you don't
If  ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, 'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours
Spare met Jack
'm into legit investments from here on in
Cates gives him a very skeptical look, as they head for the car
Hammond gets in behind the wheel, Cates on the passenger side
Cates takes out a cigarette, starts to light it
Hammond takes the match does it for him
Thanks
No trouble, Jack
But, listen, suppose  stay a crook
Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me
They both smile
Hammond socks it into gear and they drive off into the far distance
