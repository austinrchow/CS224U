"  " Screenplay by Emma Thompson Based on the novel by Jane Austen -  - series of traveling shots
well-dressed, pompous-looking individual ( , 35) is making an urgent journey on horseback
He looks anxious
-  -  1800 - Silence
Norland Park, a large country house built in the early part of the eighteenth century, lies in the moonlit parkland
-  '  - In the dim light shed by candles we see a bed in which a ( , 52) lies his skin waxy, his breathing laboured
Around him two silhouettes move and murmur, their clothing susurrating in the deathly hush
( , 50) sits by his side, holding his hand, her eyes never leaving his face
(urgent) Is John not yet arrived
We expect him at any moment, dearest
looks anguished
The girls-- have left so little
Shh, hush, Henry
Elinor will try to look after you all, but make sure she finds a good husband
The men are such noodles hereabouts, little wonder none has pleased her
They smile at each other
is just managing to conceal her fear and grief But Marianne is sure to find her storybook hero
romantic poet with flashing eyes and empty pockets
As long as she loves him, whoever he is
Margaret will go to sea and become a pirate so we need not concern ourselves with her
tries to laugh but it emerges as a sob
An older () now enters, anxiety written on every feature
Your son is arrived from London, sir
squeezes his wife's hand
Let me speak to John alone
She nods quickly and he smiles at her with infinite tenderness
Ah, my dear
How happy you have made me
makes a superhuman effort and smiles back
She allows  to help her out
She passes   as he enters, presses his hand, but cannot speak
takes her place by the bed
Father
summons his last ounces of energy and starts to whisper with desperate intensity
John you will find out soon enough from my will that the estate of Norland was left to me in such a way as prevents me from dividing it between my families
blinks
He cannot quite take it in
Calm yourself, Father
This is not good for you
But   continues with even greater determination
Norland in its entirety is therefore yours by law and  am happy for you and Fanny
looks torn between genuine distress and unexpected delight
But your stepmother my wife and daughters are left with only five hundred pounds a year, barely enough to live on and nothing for the girls' dowries
You must help them
's face is a picture of conflicting emotions
Behind them is the ominous rustling of parchments
Of course You must promise to do this
brief moment of sincerity overcomes 's natural hypocrisy
promise, Father,  promise
seems relieved
Suddenly his breathing changes
looks alarmed
He rises and we hear him going to find the
Come
Come quickly
But it is we who share the dying man's last words
Help them
'   -  - Outside the house sits a very well-to-do carriage
Behind it waits another open carriage upon which servants are laying trunks and boxes
(
) 'Help them
' '   -   - is standing in mourning clothes and a traveling cape
He is watching, and obviously waiting for, a pert  ( ) who is standing by a mirror looking at him keenly
What do you mean, 'help them'
Dearest,  mean to give them three thousand pounds
goes very still
gets nervous
The interest will provide them with a little extra income
Such a gift will certainly discharge my promise to my father
slowly turns back to the mirror
Oh, without question
More than amply
One had rather, on such occasions, do too much than too little
pause as  turns and looks at him again
Of course, he did not stipulate a particular sum
-   - red-eyed  () plunges a beautiful muslin frock into a vat of black dye
-  '  - is rushing about, mourning ribbons flapping, putting her knick-knacks into a small valise
The room is in chaos
young  ( ) looks on helplessly
To be reduced to the condition of visitor in my own home
It is not to be borne, Elinor
Consider, Mamma
We have nowhere to go
John and Fanny will descend from London at any moment, followed no doubt by cartloads of relatives ready to turn us out of our rooms one by one do you expect me to be here to welcome them
Vultures
She suddenly collapses into a chair and bursts into tears
shall start making inquiries for a new house at once
Until then we must try to bear their coming
'  - and  are on their way out of London
Fifteen hundred then
What say you to fifteen hundred
What brother on earth would do half so much for his real sisters--let alone half-blood
They can hardly expect more
There is no knowing what they expect
The question is, what can you afford
-   - beautiful young  ( ) is sitting at the piano playing a particularly sad piece
enters
Marianne, cannot you play something else
Mamma has been weeping since breakfast
stops, turns the pages of her music book and starts playing something equally lugubrious
meant something less mournful, dearest
- and  are waiting as the  make the final adjustments to their carriage
The  hovers, waiting for a tip
hundred pounds a year to their mother while she lives
Would that be more advisable
It is better than parting with the fifteen hundred all at once
He displays some coins in his hand
removes one and nods
But if she should live longer than fifteen years we would be completely taken in
People always live forever when there is an annuity to be paid them
gives the coins to the
- ' - - comes to the foot of a large tree from which a small staircase issues
Margaret, are you there
Please come down
John and Fanny will be here soon
pause
is about to leave when a disembodied and truculent young voice stops her
(
) Why are they coming to live at Norland
They already have a house in London
Because houses go from father to son, dearest not from father to daughter
It is the law
Silence
tries another tack
If you come inside, we could play with your atlas
(
) It's not my atlas any more
It's their atlas
on  as she ponders the truth of this statement
'  - and  joggle on
Twenty pounds now and then will amply discharge my promise, you are quite right
Indeed
Although to say the truth, am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them money
They will have five hundred a year amongst them as it is-- --and what on earth can four women want for more than that
Their housekeeping will be nothing at all they will have no carriage, no horses, hardly any servants and will keep no company
Only conceive how comfortable they will be
- '  - The large contingent of  who staff Norland Park are gathered in gloomy silence as  addresses them
As you know, we are looking for a new home
When we leave we shall be able to retain only Thomas and Betsy
holds on  and , a capable woman
We are very sorry to have to leave you all
But we are certain you will find the new Mrs Dashwood a fair and generous mistress
- and 's carriage approaches Norland
(
) They will be much more able to give you something
'  - and  are about to get out
So we are agreed
No money but the occasional gift of game and fish in season will be very welcome
Your father would be proud of you
-   - The entire family, with the exception of , is present
is serving food in an atmosphere of stiff silence
Cutlery clinks
chews loudly
is rigid with resentment
maintains a cool, removed dignity
tries to play hostess
How is Mrs Ferrars
My mother is always in excellent health, thank you
My brother Robert is in town with her this season and quite the most popular bachelor in London
He has his own barouche
In the brief silence which follows this,  surreptitiously checks the hallmark on her butterknife
You have two brothers, have you not
Indeed, yes
Edward is the eldest Mamma quite depends upon him
He is traveling up from Plymouth shortly and will break his journey here
looks at  pointedly
notices
(to  ) If that is agreeable to you, of course
My dear John this is your home now
looks about, barely able to conceal her satisfaction
- '  - is sitting with a little pile of parcels
She puts a shawl into some paper and ties it with ribbon as thunders in, looking mutinous
Fanny wishes to know where the key for the silver cabinet is kept
Betsy has it,  think
What does Fanny want with the silver
can only presume she wants to count it
What are you doing
Presents for the servants
Have you seen Margaret
am worried about her
She has taken to hiding in the oddest places
Fortunate girl
At least she can escape Fanny, which is more than any of us is able
You do your best
You have not said a word to her for a week
(truculently) have
have said 'yes' and 'no'
-   - ,  ,  and  are at breakfast
enters
catches her eye and indicates with a slight motion of her head
makes a face
(very polite) Good morning, Fanny
is rather startled
Good morning, Marianne
is relieved
(to Fanny) How did you find the silver
Is it all genuine
rushes in before  gets any further
Pray, when may we expect the pleasure of your brother's company
Edward is due tomorrow
And my dear Mrs Dashwood, in view of the fact that he will not be with us for long, wondered if Miss Margaret would mind giving up her room to him the view is quite incomparable from her windows and  should so much like Edward to see Norland at its best
slams her cup down and throws a furious look at - '  - and  are removing 's toys
Intolerable woman
There is but one consolation if Edward is anything like Fanny, we shall be only too happy to leave
-  - very capable  ( ) canters up the gravel drive
on his face as he gazes up at the elegant facade
-   - Everyone except  is present
has just shaken bands with
He behaves with great respect to the and seems embarrassed by 's pro prietorial air
But where is Miss Margaret
declare, Mrs Dashwood,  am beginning to doubt of her existence
She must run positively wild
Forgive us, Mr Ferrars
My youngest is not to be found this morning
She is a little shy of strangers at present
Naturally
am also shy of strangers and  have nothing like her excuse
(dangerous) How do you like your view, Mr Ferrars
glances at her warningly but  replies with careful consideration
Very much
Your stables are very handsome and beautifully kept, Mrs Dashwood
Stables
Edward--your windows overlook the lake
An oversight, Fanny, led me to the wrong room
have rectified the situation and am happily settled in the guest quarters
and  look at each other in surprise looks furious
smiles warmly at
on
She is impressed
-  - is walking with , who looks at the pictures with interest
They are all exceedingly spoilt, find
Miss Margaret spends all her time up trees and under furniture and  have barely had a civil word from Marianne
My dear Fanny, they have just lost their father their lives will never be the same again
That is no excuse
-  - leads  in
She sniffs with distaste
have never liked the smell of books
Oh
No
The dust, perhaps
As they speak,  notices a large atlas retreating apparently all by itself across the floor
Someone is obviously under the table, pulling it out of sight
He registers it and immediately moves in such a way as to shield it from
He turns back, searching for something to divert her
hear you have great plans for the walnut grove
Oh yes
shall have it pulled down to make room for a Grecian temple
There is a stifled wail from under the table, which covers with a cough
How picturesque
Will you show me the site
And he ushers  out, flicking a quick glance over his shoulder at the fugitive's foot
-   - ,   and  are sitting round a table with a pile of letters
is handing one back to her mother
Too expensive
We do not need four bedrooms, we can share
This one, then
reads the letter quickly
Marianne, we have only five hundred pounds a year
will send out more inquiries today
There is a knock on the door
Hesitantly,  appears
Pardon my intrusion, but  believe have found what you are looking for
and   are puzzled by his elliptical manner but  immediately understands and rises, in smiling relief
-     - is standing outside keeping a discreet lookout
The door is half open and he can hear  trying to coax out
walks by with a  to whom she is giving instructions
pretends to examine the mouldings and she passes on unsuspecting
(
) Won't you come out, dearest
We haven't seen you all day
Mamma is very concerned
More silence
thinks hard
He makes a decision
-  - walks in loudly
Oh, Miss Dashwood
Excuse me  was wondering do you by any chance have such a thing as a reliable atlas
looks up at him in astonishment
believe so
Excellent
wish to check the position of the Nile
appears to be utterly sincere
My sister says it is in South America
From under the table we hear a snort
looks at him in realisation
Oh
No, no indeed
She is quite wrong
For  believe it is in--in Belgium
Belgium
Surely not
You must be thinking of the Volga
(from under the table) The Volga
Of course
The Volga, which, as you know, starts in
Vladivostok, and ends in
St Albans
Indeed
Where the coffee beans come from
They are having such a good time that it is rather a pity the game is stopped by the appearance from under the table of  who reveals herself to be a disheveled girl of eleven
She hauls the atlas up and plonks it in front of The source of the Nile is in Abyssinia
Is it
Good heavens
How do you do
Edward Ferrars
Margaret Dashwood
shakes 's hand solemnly and looks over her head at
They smile at each other, a connection made
-   - is reading a newspaper
sits across from , who thumbs through a fashion-plate magazine is at a desk by the window writing a letter we see the words 'of course we should like to leave as soon as possible'
Suddenly she hears a commotion outside
runs past the window brandishing a stick
follows, and proceeds to teach her the first principles of sword-fighting
They feint and parry,  serious and without a hint of condescension,  concentrating furiously suddenly turns, as though feeling 's gaze
She smiles but looks away quickly
-   - comes into the doorway and sees  who is listening to  playing a concerto
stands in a graceful, rather sad attitude, her back to us
Suddenly she senses behind her and turns
He is about to turn away, embarrassed to have been caught admiring her, when he sees she has been weeping
Hastily she tries to dry her eyes
He comes forward and offers her a handkerchief, which she takes with a grateful smile
We notice his monogram in the corner: (apologetic) That was my father's favourite
nods kindly
Thank you so much for your help with Margaret, Mr Ferrars
She is a changed girl since your arrival
Not at all
enjoy her company
Has she shown you her tree-house
Not yet
Would you do me the honour, Miss Dashwood
It is very fine out
With pleasure
They start to walk out of shot, still talking
Margaret has always wanted to travel
know
She is heading an expedition to China shortly
am to go as her servant but only on the understanding that  will be very badly treated
What will your duties be
Sword-fighting, administering rum and swabbing
Ah
tilts up to find   on the middle landing of the staircase, smiling down at them
tilts up yet further to find  on the landing above, watching  and with a face like a prune
-  - and  are still talking as they walk arm in arm in the late afternoon sun
All  want--all  have ever wanted is the quiet of a private life but my mother is determined to see me distinguished
As
She hardly knows
Any fine figure will suit a great orator, a leading politician, even a barrister would serve, but only on the condition that  drive my own barouche and dine in the first circles
His tone is light but there is an underlying bitterness to it
And what do you wish for
always preferred the church, but that is not smart enough for my mother she prefers the army, but that is a great deal too smart for me
Would you stay in London
hate London
No peace
country living is my ideal a small parish where  might do some good, keep chickens and give very short sermons
- and  are on horseback
The atmosphere is intimate, the quality of the conversation rooted now in their affections
You talk of feeling idle and useless imagine how that is compounded when one has no choice and no hope whatsoever of any occupation
nods and smiles at the irony of it
Our circumstances are therefore precisely the same
Except that you will inherit your fortune
He looks at her slightly shocked but enjoying her boldness
We cannot even earn ours
Perhaps Margaret is right
Right
Piracy is our only option
They ride on in silence for a moment
What is swabbing exactly
-   - Dinner is over
and  are examining plans of the Norland estate, looking for somewhere to build a hermitage
is reading out loud
embroiders and listens
and  make up the rest of the audience, the latter in a state of high impatience
No voice divine the storm allayed No light propitious shone, When snatched from all effectual aid, We perished each alone: But  beneath a rougher sea, And whelmed in deeper gulfs than he
jumps up and goes to him
No, Edward
Listen
She takes the book from him and reads the stanza with passionate brio
Can you not feel his despair
Try again
Rather mortified,  starts again, but not before receiving a sympathetic look from  which seems to comfort him a little
-   - is ruminating sadly
rushes in holding a letter
Mamma, look
This has just arrived
(reading from the letter) ' should be pleased to offer you a home at Barton Cottage as soon as ever you have need of it' why, it is from my cousin, Sir John Middleton
Even Elinor must approve the rent
looks at the letter again and thinks
Has Elinor not yet seen this
No  will fetch her
Wait
No
Let us delay
Why
think-- believe that Edward and Elinor have formed an attachment
Marianne nods, a little reluctantly
It would be cruel to take her away so soon and Devonshire is so far
makes her decision
She takes the letter and hides it in the pocket of her gown
looks on frowningly
Why so grave
Do you disapprove her choice
By no means
Edward is very amiable
Amiable but
But there is something wanting
He is too sedate his reading last night
Elinor has not your feelings, his reserve suits her
thinks for a little
Can he love her
Can the ardour of the soul really be satisfied with such polite, concealed affections
To love is to burn to be on fire, all made of passion, of adoration, of sacrifice
Like Juliet, or Guinevere or Heloise
They made rather pathetic ends, dear
Pathetic
To die for love
How can you say so
What could be more glorious
think that may be taking your romantic sensibilities a little far
The more  know of the world, the more  am convinced that  shall never see a man whom  can truly love
You require so much
do not
require only what any young woman of taste should a man who sings well, dances admirably, rides bravely, reads with passion and whose tastes agree in every point with my own
- '  - is in bed, deep in thought
enters in her nightclothes, carrying a book of poetry
She reads, teasingly
Is love a fancy, or a feeling
No It is immortal as immaculate truth 'Tis not a blossom shed as soon as Youth Drops from the stem of life for it will grow In barren regions, where no waters flow Nor ray of promise cheats the pensive gloom-- She jumps onto the bed
smiles somewhat suspiciously
What a pity it is that Edward has no passion for reading
It was you who asked him to read and then you made him nervous
Me
But your behaviour to him in all other respects is perfectly cordial so  must assume that you like him in spite of his deficiencies
(trying hard) think him everything that is amiable and worthy
Praise indeed
But he shall have my unanswering devotion when you tell me he is to be my brother
is greatly taken aback and does not know how to reply
Suddenly  hugs her passionately
How shall  do without you
Do without me
pulls away, her eyes full of tears
am sure you will be very happy
But you must promise not to live too far away
Marianne, there is no question of that is, there is no under standing between
trails off
looks at her keenly
Do you love him
The bold clarity of this question discomforts
do not attempt to deny that  think very highly of him that  greatly esteem that  like him
Esteem him
Like him
Use those insipid words again and  shall leave the room this instant
This makes  laugh in spite of her discomfort
Very well
Forgive me
Believe my feelings to be stronger than  have declared but further than that you must not believe
is flummoxed but she rallies swiftly and picks up her book again
'Is love a fancy or a feeling
' Or a Ferrars
Go to bed
blushes in good earnest
goes to the door
(imitating Elinor) ' do not attempt to deny that think highly of him greatly esteem him
Like him
' And she is gone, leaving  both agitated and amused
-   - is standing by the window looking out
We see her of  and  walking in the garden
enters, pauses for a moment and then joins at the window
pretends not to have been watching but looks down at the lovers and then smiles sweetly at her
We are all so happy that you chose to invite Edward to Norland
He is a dear boy and we are all very fond of him
does a bit of quick thinking
We have great hopes for him
Much is expected of him by our mother with regard to his profession Naturally
And in marriage
She is determined that both he and Robert will marry well
Of course
But  hope she desires them to marry for love, first and foremost
have always felt that, contrary to common wisdom, true affection is by far the most valuable dowry
Love is all very well, but unfortunately we cannot always rely on the heart to lead us in the most suitable directions
lowers her voice confidingly
You see, my dear Mrs Dashwood, Edward is entirely the kind of compassionate person upon whom penniless women can prey--and having entered into any kind of understanding, he would never go back on his word
He is quite simply incapable of doing so
But it would lead to his ruin
worry for him so, Mrs Dashwood
My mother has always made it perfectly plain that she will withdraw all financial support from Edward, should he choose to plant his affections in less
exalted ground than he deserves
It is impossible for   not to get the point
She is appalled and furious
understand you perfectly
She sweeps off
-  '   - , breathless with rage, is searching through her wardrobe for the gown which contains  's letter
Frocks fly hither and thither
Finally   plunges her hand into the right pocket and withdraws the letter
She looks at it, suddenly concerned and anxious
-   - The entire family is present
Everyone is watching , who has just made her announcement
Devonshire
He is devastated
is thrilled
looks at him with compassion and then at , who is trying to keep calm
My cousin Sir John Middleton has offered us a small house on his estate
Sir John Middleton
What is his situation
He must be a man of property
He is a widower
He lives with his mother-in-law at Barton Park and it is Barton Cottage that he offers us
Oh, a cottage
How charming
little cottage is always very snug
But you will not leave before the summer
Oh, my dear Edward, we can no longer trespass upon your sister's good will
We must leave as soon as possible
You will come and stay with us, Edward
should like that very much
Edward has long been expected in town by our mother
ignores
Come as soon as you can, Edward
Remember that you are always welcome
/
-  - has come to say goodbye to her
She strokes the soft face sadly
Then she senses someone and turns to find standing nearby
Cannot you take him with you
We cannot possibly afford him
Perhaps he could make himself useful in the kitchen
tries to smile
looks at her for a long moment and then comes closer
Miss Dashwood--Elinor
must talk to you
The use of her Christian name--and in such a loving tone-- stops 's breath altogether
There is something of great importance need
to tell you-- He comes closer still
The  breathes between them is on fire with anticipation but  looks troubled and has less the air of a suitor than he might
--about--about my education
(after a beat) Your education
Yes
It was less
successful than it might have been
laughs nervously
is completely bewildered
It was conducted in Plymouth--oddly enough
Indeed
Yes
Do you know it
Plymouth
Yes
No
Oh--well-- spent four years there-- at a school run by a--a Mr Pratt-- Pratt
is beginning to feel like a parrot
Precisely--Mr Pratt--and there, -- that is to say, he has a-- As  flounders, a familiar voice cuts through this unexpected foray into his academic past
Edward
Edward
They turn to find  powering down upon them, waving a letter
steps back, glancing almost guiltily at , who is as confused as we are
have been all over for you
You are needed in London this instant
Fanny,  am leaving this afternoon as it is-- No, no, that will not do
Family affairs are in chaos owing to your absence
Mother is quite adamant that you should leave at once
is determined
She obviously has no intention of leaving him alone with
turns to , frustration in every muscle, his jaw set tight
Excuse me, Miss Dashwood
drags  off, leaving  to gaze sadly after them
'  -   -  - The  are on their way
The mood is very sombre
Edward promised he would bring the atlas to Barton for me
looks at , pleased
Did he
Well,  will wager he will do so in less than a fortnight
looks at  with satisfaction
'  -   - The carriage rolls on
(
) Are we there yet
- In comparison to Norland, Barton Cottage has the air of a damp shoebox
it sits low and bleak in the grey lonely countryside
From one side we can see the ' carriage drawing up at the gate
From the other, a much grander vehicle, from which loud whooping can be heard, is approaching
-   - As the exhausted  alight, they converge with a ruddy- complexioned  in a redingote (  ) and a rotund, equally roseate  ( ) who have fallen over each other in their haste to get out of their carriage
Sir John
clasps her hands and starts to help her up the path, followed by ,  and , who is clearly fascinated by his bouncy companion
Dear ladies, dear ladies, upon my word, here you are, here you are, here you are
Sir John, your extraordinary kindness-- Oh, none of that, hush, please, none of that, but here is my dear mamma- in-law Mrs Jennings
Was the journey tolerable, you poor souls
Why did you not come up to the Park first and take your ease
We saw you pass--Like many people who live rather lonely lives together
and   talk incessantly, interrupt each other all the time and never listen
--but  would not wait for you to come to us,  made John call for the carriage-- She would not wait, you know
--as we get so little company
They reach the front door and 's smiling welcome
In the confusion of milling people and  carrying the lighter luggage,  contrives to slip into the house alone
We follow her but hear the conversation continuing in looks about the parlour, where a dismal fire is smoking
She starts up the stairs, expressionless
(
) But  feel as if  know you already-- delightful creatures
(
) Delightful
And you know you are to dine at Barton Park every day
(
) Oh, but dear Sir John, we cannot-- (
) Oh, no no no no no no no,  shall not brook refusals
am quite deaf to 'em, you know-- (
) --deaf-- enters a small bedroom
She sits on the bed
Then she goes to the window and opens it
Voices float up
(
) But  insist
(
) Let us only settle in for a few days, Sir John, and thank you-- (
) Oh, no thankings, no, please, can't bear 'em, embarrassing, you know-- closes the window and crosses the corridor to another bed room--similarly stark
She sighs and turns back down the stairs
(
) We will send game and fruit as a matter of course-- (
) --fruit and game-- (
) --and the carriage is at your beck and call-- joins the group, who are now in the parlour
--call--and here is Miss Marianne
Where did you disappear to
declare you are the loveliest girl ever set eyes on
Cannot you get them married, Mrs Dashwood
You must not leave it too long
But, alas, there are no smart young men hereabouts to woo them-- --not a beau for miles
The strain of exhibiting joy and gratitude is beginning to tell on   who is sagging visibly
Come, Mother, let us leave them in peace
But there is Colonel Brandon
is dragging her down the path
Excellent fellow
We served in the East India Regiment together
Just wait till he sees you
If we can persuade him out to meet you
Reclusive individual
But you are fatigued
can see that you are fatigued
Now he is pushing her into the carriage
Of course she is fatigued
Come along, Mother, we really must leave them to themselves
You must get your maidservant to make you up some camphor--it is the best tonic for the staggers
Send Thomas to us for the carriage when you are ready
They take off, waving wildly
goes down the path to watch them and turns back to her slightly stunned family
like them
(weakly) What generosity
Indeed
am surprised they did not offer us their clothing
-   '  - and  are getting undressed for bed
it's very cold
They keep their underclothing on and get in, shivering at the bony chill of the linen
-   - is pinning out laundry
-  - tries to climb an impossible tree
Her petticoats snag and tear
-   '  - looks out of the window at the wild countryside
Uncon sciously, one hand plays up and down on the sill as though it were a keyboard
-  - sits at a little desk counting money and making notes
enters to clean out the fire
She notices the money
Sugar is five shilling a pound these parts, Miss Dashwood
(lightly) No more sugar then
-  - on   looking out of the window, thinking
She remembers  's words: (
) Not a beau for miles
turns into the room to look at her brood and  are mending 's petticoats
on the mother's anxious expression--what is to become of them
- Establishing shot of  's house--a very comfortable- looking country seat with fine grounds
(
) Where can Brandon be, poor fellow hope he has not lamed his horse
-   - on an empty chair and place setting
Pull out to reveal the  at their first dinner with   and Colonel Brandon is the most eligible bachelor in the county--he is bound to do for one of you
Mind, he is a better age for Miss Dashwood--but dare say she left her heart behind in Sussex, eh
flashes an unmistakable glance of alarmed concern at her sister, which   notices
Aha
see you, Miss Marianne think  have unearthed a secret
Oho
Have you sniffed one out already, Mother
You are worse than my best pointer, Flossie
They both laugh immoderately
tries to stay calm
What sort of man is he, Miss Dashwood
Is he butcher, baker, candlestick- maker
shall winkle it out of you somehow, you know
She's horribly good at winkling
You are in lonely country now, Miss Dashwood, none of us has any secrets here-- --or if we do, we do not keep them for long
tries to smile
looks furious
is staring at   as if she were some particularly thrilling form of wildlife
He is curate of the parish,  dare say
Or a handsome lieutenant
Give us a clue, Miss Dashwood--is he in uniform
starts to change the subject, but  interrupts her
He has no profession
and   turn on her with screams of delight
,  and   look at each other helplessly
No profession
gentleman, then
(with daggers) Margaret, you know perfectly well there is no such person
There is
There is
And his name begins with an
looks hard at her plate
Margaret
is appalled at her youngest's relish for such a vulgar game
and   are cock-a-hoop
indeed
very promising letter
Let me--, , Fo, Fa
Upon my word, but  cannot think of a single name beginning with -- Forrest
Foster
Frost
Foggarty
suddenly stands up
and   are so surprised they stop talking
Everyone stares at
(controlled fury) Sir John, might  play your pianoforte
Of course, yes--my goodness
We do not stand on ceremony here, my dear
For once,  is grateful for her sister's rudeness as everyone rises and follows  out
-   - soldierly  of about forty ( ) is dismounting from his horse
From within we hear 's song begin
His head snaps up to the windows
An expression of pained surprise comes into his melancholy, brooding eyes
-   - Everyone watches  as she plays and sings
Behind them we see  entering
But he stays in the shadow of the door and no one notices him
on his face
He gazes at  with an unfathomable look of grief and longing
He breathes in deeply
Suddenly,  feels his presence and looks around at him
After a few moments, she turns back, slightly puzzled
The song finishes
Everyone claps
The ventures out into the light and   springs from his seat
Brandon
Where have you been
Come, come and meet our beautiful new neighbours
What a pity you are late, Colonel
You have missed the most delightful singing
bows to the company and smiles slightly
great pity, indeed
looks at him, even more puzzled
Mrs Dashwood, may  present my dear friend Colonel Brandon
We served together in the East Indies and assure you there is no better fellow on earth-- Have you really been to the East Indies, Colonel
have
What is it like
is quivering with fascination
Like
Hot
But   knows what  wants to hear
(mysteriously) The air is full of spices
smiles with satisfaction
Come, Miss Dashwood--it is your turn to entertain us
Oh no, Sir John,  do not-- --and  think we can all guess what key you will sing in
and   are bursting with their new joke
/ major
They fall about
'  - The  are returning home
row is in progress
(to Margaret) As for you, you have no right, no right at all, to parade your ignorant assumptions-- They are not assumptions
You told me
stares at
colours and attacks again
told you nothing-- They'll meet him when he comes, anyway
That is not the point
You do not speak of such things before strangers-- But everyone else was-- Mrs Jennings is not everyone
like her
She talks about things
We never talk about things
Hush, please, now that is enough, Margaret
If you cannot think of anything appropriate to say, you will please restrict your remarks to the weather
heated pause
like Colonel Brandon too
He's been to places
- In the background,  ,  and   pack the remains of a picnic into a basket
and examine a foxhole
In the foreground,  is cutting bulrushes for basketwork
Her knife is blunt and she saws impatiently
materialises at her side and wordlessly offers her his hunting knife
Oddly nervous,  takes it
She turns back to the rushes and cuts them with ease
The 's gaze follows her movements as if held by a magnet
'  -   - and  are cleaning their guns in companionable silence--a habit left over from army days
eyes roguishly
You know what they're saying, of course
No answer
The word is that you have developed a taste for--certain company
stays resolutely silent
is emboldened
And why not, say
man like you-- in his prime--she'd be a most fortunate young lady-- cuts across him
Marianne Dashwood would no more think of me than she would of you, John
Brandon, my boy, do not think of yourself so meanly-- And all the better for her
subsides
is clearly as angry with himself as he is with
- strides along in hunting gear, a gun slung under one arm, his dog trotting behind him with a duck clamped between its jaws
The bulrushes catch his eye and he slows, then stops
He stands for a moment deep in thought
Then he takes his hunting knife, cuts one and walks off contemplatively
-  - An outdoor luncheon is in progress
is talking to
Occasionally he looks over towards , who is playing bilboquet with   and nudges  hard and gestures to
(stage whisper) Besotted
Excellent match, for he is rich and she is handsome
How long have you known the Colonel
Oh, Lord bless you, as long as ever have been here, and  came fifteen years back
His estate at Delaford is but four miles hence and he and John are very thick
He has no wife or children of his own, for-- lowers her voice to a stentorian whisper
--he has a tragic history
He loved a girl once--twenty years ago now--a ward to his family, but they were not permitted to marry
is intrigued
On what grounds
Money
Eliza was poor
When the father discovered their amour, she was flung out of the house and he packed off into the army
believe he would have done himself a harm if not for John
What became of the lady
Oh, she was passed from man to man-- disappeared from all good society
When Brandon got back from India he searched for heaven knows how long, only to find her dying in a poor house
You have seen how it has affected him
Once  thought my daughter Charlotte might have cheered him up, but she is much better off where she is
is silent with amazement at this unexpected history
Look at him now, though
So attentive
shall try an experiment on him
Oh no, please, dear Mrs Jennings, leave the poor Colonel alone
No, no, it is just the thing--all suitors need a little help, my dear winks at  and rubs her hands as though about to perform a magic trick
(trillingly) Colonel Brandon
looks up
We have not heard you play for us of late
For the simple reason that you have a far superior musician here
He indicates , who smiles absently
Perhaps you did not know, Miss Marianne, that our dear Brandon shares your passion for music and plays the piano forte very well
looks at  in some surprise
Play us a duet
looks at   warningly but she ignores him
'll trow you know quite as many melancholy tunes as Miss Marianne
Her tone is so knowing that  frowns uncomfortably
Come
Let us see you both side by side
rises impatiently
do not know any duets
Forgive me, Colonel
She moves away
chuckles
-  - The  returning
is taking her bonnet off so furiously that she simply gets the knot tighter and tighter
Despite them selves,  and   are amused
Oh
Are we never to have a moment's peace
The rent here may be low but think we have it on very hard terms
Mrs Jennings is a wealthy woman with a married daughter--she has nothing to do but marry off everyone else's
pokes her head out from the dining room
There's a parcel arrived for you, Miss Dashwood
parcel
They all crowd into the dining room to find a large package on the table, which  is permitted to open
In the meantime  comes to the rescue with the bonnet and stands shifting like a spirited mare as patiently unravels the knot
It is too ridiculous
When is a man to be safe from such wit if age and infirmity do not protect him
Infirmity
If Colonel Brandon is infirm, then am at death's door
It is a miracle your life has extended this far
Did you not hear him complain of a rheumatism in his shoulder
slight ache'  believe was his phrase
smiles and  laughs at her
Then  opens the parcel to reveal--her atlas
The atmosphere alters immediately as   and  look at  in consternation
But Edward said he would bring it himself
There is a letter on top of the atlas
on the address 'To the Dashwoods'
picks it up, looks at , and opens 'Dear Mrs Dashwood, Miss Dashwood, Miss Marianne and Captain Margaret-- it gives me great pleasure to restore this atlas to its rightful owner
Alas, business in London does not permit me to accompany it, although this is likely to hurt me far more than it hurts you
For the present my memories of your kindness must be enough to sustain me, and  remain your devoted servant always
Ferrars
' silence greets this brief epistle
struggles to contain her bitter disappointment
But why hasn't he come
He says he is busy, dear
He said he'd come
is genuinely upset
quietly hangs up 's bonnet
Why hasn't he come
looks beseechingly at , who nods and grasps 's hand
am taking you for a walk
No
've been a walk
You need another
It is going to rain
shoves her bonnet back on and drags  out
It is not going to rain
You always say that and then it always does
We hear the front door slam behind them
There is a short silence
fear Mrs Jennings is a bad influence
She approaches
You must miss him, Elinor
looks very directly at her mother
We are not engaged, Mamma
But he loves you, dearest, of that am certain
looks down
She speaks slowly, choosing her words with care
am by no means assured of his regard for me
Oh, Elinor
But even were he to feel such a
preference,  think we should be foolish to assume that there would not be many obstacles to his choosing a woman of no rank who cannot afford to buy sugar
But Elinor--your heart must tell you-- In such a situation, Mamma, it is perhaps better to use one's head
She clears her throat, rises determinedly, picks up the accounts book and opens it
is silenced
- walks very briskly, dragging an unwilling behind her
- It has started to rain
Mists are gathering around the two figures walking against the wind
Is there any felicity in the world superior to this
told you it would rain
Look
There is some blue sky
Let us chase it
'm not supposed to run
runs off down the hill into the heart of the mist
stumbles after her, grumbling
We follow in her headlong descent and suddenly, dramatically, she trips and sprawls to the ground, letting out a sharp cry of pain
Marianne
Help me
She tries to get up, but the pain in her ankle is too great
She sinks back to the ground
is very alarmed
Margaret, run home and fetch help
The mists have thickened
They can no longer see where they are
Despite her rising fear,  squares her shoulders bravely and tries to sense the direction
think it is this way
will run as fast as  can, Marianne
She dashes off
As she goes into the mist we hear the thunder of hooves
Margaret's terrified expression
They seem to be coming from all around
She wheels and turns and then--Crash
Through the mist breaks a huge white horse
Astride sits an Adonis in hunting gear
squeals
The horse rears
Its rider controls it and slides off
He rushes to 's side
Are you hurt
(transfixed) Only my ankle
May  have your permission to-- He indicates her leg
Decorous, perhaps faintly impish
--ascertain if there are any breaks
nods speechlessly
With great delicacy, he feels her ankle
's eyes are out on chapel-hooks almost swoons with embarrassment and excitement mixed
It is not broken
Now, can you put your arm about my neck
does not need any encouragement
He lifts her effortlessly and calls to his horse: 'Bedivere
' It trots obediently forward
The  smiles down at
Allow me to escort you home
-   - Rain is thudding against the window from which turns, looking very worried
Marianne was sure it would not rain
Which invariably means it will
But we can see she is trying to conceal her anxiety from her mother
There are noises in the hall
At last
runs into the room dripping wet
She fell over
She fell down--and he's carrying her
-   - and  rush to the front door
They see the carrying  up the garden path, his scarlet coat staining the monochrome rain
Marianne
The  reaches the door
This is no time for introductions
In here, sir--this way
Margaret, open the door wider
Please, sir, lay her here
Marianne, are you in pain
They move into the parlour
-  - is carried in, surrounded by , and
It is a twisted ankle
Do not be alarmed, Mamma
The  deposits  on the sofa
They look straight into each other's eyes
Electric
can assure you it is not serious
took the liberty of feeling the bone and it is perfectly sound
raises her eyebrows at , who blushes to her roots
Sir,  cannot even begin to thank you
Please do not think of it
'm honoured of be of service
Will you not be seated
Pray excuse me-- have no desire to leave a water mark
But permit me to call tomorrow afternoon and inquire after the patient
We shall look forward to it
He turns to  and smiles
She smiles back gloriously
He bows, and sweeps out of the room
(hissing) His name
His name
silences her with a gesture and follows him out with all the solicitous charm she can command while pokes her head around the door to watch
is removing 's boot and trying not to laugh at her
-   - calls out after him
Please tell us to whom we are so much obliged
The  mounts Bedivere and turns to her
John Willoughby of Allenham--your servant, ma'am
And he gallops off into the mist--we almost expect Bedivere to sprout wings
on  's excited expression
-  - runs back into the parlour, jittering with excitement and anxiety
Mr John Willoughby of Allenham
What an impressive gentleman
He lifted me as if  weighed no more than a dried leaf
Is he human
hits
tends to her ankle
Tell me if  hurt you
(regarding Marianne's ecstatic expression) She feels no pain, Mamma
Margaret, ask Betsy to make up a cold compress, please
(leaving reluctantly) Did you see him
He expressed himself well, did he not
With great decorum and honour
And spirit and wit and feeling
And economy--ten words at most
From below stairs we can hear  wailing Wait for me
And he is to come tomorrow
You must change, Marianne--you will catch a cold
What care  for colds when there is such a man
You will care very much when your nose swells up
You are right
Help me, Elinor
comes back with the bandages
What has happened
We have decided to give you to the Gypsies
and  go upstairs
whispers to Will they be married before Edward and Elinor, do you think, Mamma
Margaret, you are worse than Mrs Jennings
- The rain has cleared
's horse munches grass contentedly by the side of the road
(
) Mr Willoughby is well worth catching, Miss Dashwood--Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself
-  - The  are having a frustrating time winkling information about  out of  , who is in turn only anxious to protect 's interest
has her bandaged foot up on the sofa and is fast losing patience
But what do you know of Mr Willoughby, Sir John
Decent shot--and there is not a bolder rider in all England
But what is he like
Like
What are his tastes
His passions
His pursuits
(mystified) Well, he has the nicest little bitch of a pointer--was she out with him yesterday
gives up
takes over
Where is Allenham, Sir John
Nice little estate three miles east
He is to inherit it from an elderly relative--Lady Allen is her name
Now they are getting somewhere
is about to ask another question when they hear a horse galloping up
Everyone is electrified
runs to the window and turns back in disappointment
It is Colonel Brandon
shall go outside and keep watch
runs out of the room
You are all on the lookout for Willoughby, eh
Dear me, poor Brandon
You will none of you think of him now
is admitted by
He is carrying a large bunch of hothouse flowers
How is the invalid
He hands  the flowers with a smile
Thank you so much, Colonel
She rather absently hands the flowers to , who goes for a vase
gestures at  with bluff insensitivity
Miss Marianne,  cannot see why you should set your cap at Mr Willoughby when you have already made such a splendid conquest
have no intention of 'setting my cap' at anyone, Sir John
Mr Willoughby--Lady Allen's nephew
's light tone betrays no emotion
comes back in with the flowers and puts them on the table next to Aye, he visits every year for he is to inherit Allenham--and he has a very pretty estate of his own, Miss Dashwood, Combe Magna in Somerset
If  were you,  would not give him up to my younger sister in spite of all this tumbling down hills
Suddenly  runs in screaming 'Marianne's preserver
' at the top of her voice
Everyone starts to move at once
is silenced
looks at , whose incandescent expression makes her feelings all too clear
Here is the man himself
Come, Brandon-- we know when we are not wanted
Let us leave him to the ladies
Marianne
Sir John and the Colonel are leaving
looks up, suddenly self-conscious
Goodbye, Colonel
Thank you for the flowers
sees them out
We hear 's voice outside
on 's radiant anticipation
-   - is shaking hands with   and How do you do, Colonel
How does he do
How do you do, more like
Go on in, they're waiting for you
looks at  for a moment
He bows bows
Then  and   exit
-  - leads in
greets him with outstretched arms
Mr Willoughby
What a pleasure to see you again
The pleasure is all mine,  can asstire you
trust Miss Marianne has not caught cold
You have found out my name
Of course
The neighbourhood is crawling with my spies
He suddenly produces a bunch of wild flowers from behind his back and offers them to  with a courtly, humorous bow
And since you cannot venture out to nature, nature must be brought to you
How beautiful
These are not from the hothouse
sees 's flowers
Ah
see mine is not the first offering, nor the most elegant
am afraid  obtained these from an obliging field
But  have always preferred wild flowers
suspected as much
takes the delicate flowers from
will put these in water
Our gratitude, Mr Willoughby, is beyond expression-- But it is  who am grateful
have often passed this cottage and grieved for its lonely state--and then the first news  had from Lady Allen when  arrived was that it was taken
felt a peculiar interest in the event which nothing can account for but my present delight in meeting you
He is merry, spirited, voluble--a breath of fresh air brings back 's flowers and places them next to 's on the side table
Pray sit down, Mr Willoughby
She indicates a chair but  sees a book lying on 's footstool, picks it up and--to her great delight-- sits down on the stool at her feet
Who is reading Shakespeare's sonnets
Everyone answers at once
// am
/ We all are
/ Marianne
Marianne has been reading them out to us
Which are your favourites
It is a general question but  gaily commandeers it
Without a doubt, mine is 116
Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments
Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove--then how does it go
'0, no
it is an ever-fixed mark
' joins in the line halfway through and continues
and   exchange glances
Clearly, their contribution to this conversation will be minimal
'That looks on storms'--or is it tempests
Let me find it
gets out a tiny leatherbound book
It is strange you should be reading them--for, look,  carry this with me always
It is a miniature copy of the sonnets
is delighted, and, mutually astonished at this piece of synchronicity, they proceed to look up other favourites, chatting as though they were already intimates
smiles at  with satisfaction
, amused, picks up her sewing
stares
and are oblivious to everything but each other
-   - is leaving
He has a flower from 's bunch in his buttonhole and is on his horse, looking about as virile as his horse
Everyone has come out to say goodbye, supported by  and
Till tomorrow
And my pocket sonnets are yours, Miss Marianne
talisman against further injury
Goodbye
Thank you
He gallops off
They all wave
follows him down the road for a while
Good work, Marianne
You have covered all forms of poetry; another meeting will ascertain his views on nature and romantic attachments and then you will have nothing left to talk about and the acquaintanceship will be over
suppose  have erred against decorum
should have been dull and spiritless and talked only of the weather, or the state of the roads
No, but Mr Willoughby can be in no doubt of your enthusiasm for him
Why should he doubt it
Why should hide my regard
No particular reason, Marianne, only that we know so little of him-- But time alone does not determine intimacy
Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other and seven days are more than enough for others
Or seven hours in this case
feel  know Mr Willoughby well already
If  had weaker, more shallow feelings perhaps  could conceal them, as you do-- Then she realises what she's said
Marianne, that is not fair-- am sorry, Elinor,  did not mean know
Do not trouble yourself, Marianne
turns back into the house
do not understand her, Mamma
Why does she never mention Edward have never even seen her cry about him, or about Norland
Nor
But Elinor is not like you or , dear
She does not like to be swayed by her emotions
-   '  - on Edward's handkerchief
We can see the monogram clearly
on  staring out of the window
Tears stand in her eyes but she presses the handkerchief to them before they fall
-   - After dinner
Tea has been served
,  , and   play at cards
In a far corner of the room,  is concentrating as she draws a silhouette
's profile glows behind the screen in front of her, She looks up and stops, gazing, bewitched, at his beauty
The lips move--a whisper: Marianne
Then, louder: Haven't you finished
He moves out from behind the screen, eyes full of laughter
They look at each other
-  - and   are at the accounts
and are on the other side of the room in the window seat, whispering together
Clearly, he is already part of the family
Surely you are not going to deny us beef as well as sugar
There is nothing under tenpence a pound
We have to economise
Do you want us to starve
No
Just not to eat beef
is silenced but sighs crossly
looks over to the lovers and sees  in the act of cutting off a lock of 's hair, which he kisses and places in his pocket-book
is transfixed by this strangely erotic moment
senses her gaze and looks over
She snaps her head back to her sums and is astonished to find that she has written 'Edward' at the top of the sheet
Hastily she rubs it out and writes 'Expenses'
is talking to the elderly
Other exit the church as 's curricle (the eighteenth-century equivalent of a sports car) goes flying by
sits by his side, the picture of happiness nudges the  and whispers
The stare after them and comment to each other
-   - and  are coming down the path together
is dressed to go out
The argument has evidently started indoors and is being continued here
If there was any true impropriety in my behaviour,  should be sensible of it, Elinor-- But as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks, do you not begin to doubt your own discretion
If the impertinent remarks of such as Mrs Jennings are proof of impropriety, then we are all offending every moment of our lives-- The conversation is halted by the arrival of on horseback
(dismounting) Miss Dashwood
Miss Marianne
Good morning, Colonel
come to issue an invitation picnic on my estate at Delaford--if you would care to join us on Thursday next
Mrs Jennings's daughter and her husband are traveling up especially
Thank you, Colonel, we shall be delighted
At that moment, 's curricle hoves into view and 's face lights up
(to Marianne) will of course be including Mr Willoughby in the party
Even  is a little embarrassed and recollects her manners
She smiles kindly at
should be delighted to join you, Colonel
The  helps her into the curricle, exchanging nods with , who is regarding him with some suspicion
Good morning, Miss Dashwood; good morning, Colonel
The Colonel has invited us to Delaford, Willoughby
Excellent
understand you have a particularly fine pianoforte, Colonel
The undercurrents of this conversation are decidedly tense
Broadwood Grand
Broadwood Grand
Then  shall really be able to play for you
We shall look forward to it
smiles her perfect happiness at him and he whips up the horses
They drive off, waving their farewells
looks after them for a silent moment, and then collects himself and turns to , who is less than satisfied with their behaviour
Your sister seems very happy
Yes
Marianne does not approve of hiding her emotions
In fact, her romantic prejudices have the unfortunate tendency to set propriety at naught
She is wholly unspoilt
Rather too unspoilt, in my view
The sooner she becomes acquainted with the ways of the world, the better
looks at her sharply and then speaks very deliberately, as though controlling some powerful emotion
knew a lady like your sister--the same impulsive sweetness of temper-- who was forced into, as you put it, a better acquaintance with the world
The result was only ruination and despair
He stops, and briskly remounts his horse
Do not desire it, Miss Dashwood
-  - People and carriages fill the drive, the sun shines and the atmosphere is pleasantly expectant
is organising the provision of blankets and parasols and is busy furnishing the  with their routes
There are three new faces a pretty, blowsy  ( ), a stony-faced  ( ) and an exceedingly good-looking ( ), who are standing with , , ,   and
is standing slightly apart, looking out along the road, impatient for
Imagine my surprise, Mrs Dashwood, when Charlotte and her lord and master appeared with our cousin Lucy
The last person  expected to see
'Where did you pop out from, Miss
' says
was never so surprised to see anyone in all my life
smiles shyly and looks at the ground continues sotto voce to
She probably came on purpose to share the fun, for there are no funds for such luxuries at home, poor thing
had not seen you for so long, dear Mrs Jennings,  could not resist the opportunity
Oh, you sly thing
It was the Misses Dashwood she wanted to see, not Delaford, Mamma
have heard nothing but 'Miss Dashwood this, Miss Dashwood that' for  don't know how long
And what do you think of them now you do see them, Lucy
My mother has talked of nothing else in her letters since you came to Barton, Mrs Dashwood
Mr Palmer--are they not the very creatures she describes
regards his wife with a less than enchanted expression
Nothing like
(laughing gaily) Why, Mr Palmer
Do you know you are quite rude today
He is to be an , you know, Mrs Dashwood, and it is very fatiguing for him for he is forced to make everybody like him-- he says it is quite shocking-- never said anything so irrational
Don't palm all your abuses of the language upon me
(to Mrs Dashwood) Mr Palmer is so droll--he is always out of humour
does indeed have the air of a man under siege
suddenly appears in his curricle
waves to him with a radiant smile
nudges and points to
Here he is
Now you shall see, Charlotte
drives up as close to  as possible, making her laugh
How now, Mr Willoughby
You must greet my daughter Charlotte, and Mr Palmer-- How do you do
And my little cousin, Miss Lucy Steele
Welcome to our party, Miss Steele
bobs demurely
inclines his head politely, leaps from the curricle and hands  in coos and chuckles at them
nudges
know Mr Willoughby extremely well-- not that  ever spoke to him but have seen him forever in town
Your sister is monstrous lucky to get him
Mamma says Colonel Brandon is in love with her as well, which is a very great compliment for he hardly ever falls in love with anyone
smiles politely
moves the curricle out to the front of the drive
points after them and laughs with
edges up beside
May  beg a seat beside you, Miss Dashwood
have so longed to make your better acquaintance
have heard nothing but the highest praise for you
is relieved to change the subject
would be delighted
But Sir John and Mrs Jennings are too excessive in their compliments
am sure to disappoint
No, for it was from quite another source that  heard you praised and one not at all inclined to exaggeration
speaks in a knowing, confidential undertone, as though not wanting anyone else to hear
At that moment a thunders up the drive towards them
Everyone turns to face the new arrival
What can this be
It is a  who has obviously had a long, hard ride
He asks for   and hands him a letter, which tears open
is puce with suppressed curiosity
My horse
Quickly
What is the matter, Brandon
must away to London
No
Impossible
Everyone gathers round , who is, naturally, mortified
brings up the 's horse
Imperative
There is a murmur of disappointment from the party is embarrassed and protests again
But Brandon, we are all assembled
We cannot picnic at Delaford without our host
Go up to town tomorrow
Or wait till we return and start then--you would not be six hours later
cannot afford to lose one minute
As he speaks, he is mounting his horse
His grave urgency silences all protest and he gallops off, leaving everyone stunned and, of course, deeply curious
Then they all start to talk at once
is still next to
Oh, Miss Dashwood,  cannot bear it
Just when  was to have the opportunity of speaking with you
- Having been denied their trip, the  and have set out an impromptu picnic
is wandering restlessly about
The weather is sublime
Frailty, thy name is Brandon
There are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure
think he wrote the letter himself as a trick for getting out of it
(indulgently) You are a very wicked pair, Colonel Brandon will be sadly missed
Why
When he is the kind of man that everyone speaks well of and no one wants to talk to
Exactly
Nonsense
Colonel Brandon is very highly esteemed at the Park
Which is enough censure in itself
(half laughing) Really, Willoughby
(imitating Mrs Jennings perfectly) Come, come, Mr Impudence-- know you and your wicked ways--oh
He gives a little shriek and waddles about the garden doing her walk
He comes up to  and puts his head on her shoulder
Come, Miss Dashwood, reveal your beau, reveal him,  say
Let's have no secrets between friends
Let me winkle them out of you
hits him on the nose with her teaspoon and he waddles off to
(as Mrs Jennings) declare, Miss Marianne, if  do not have you married to the Colonel by teatime,  shall swallow my own bonnet
laughs
drops the parody suddenly
As if you could marry such a character
Why should you dislike him
There is indeed an edge to 's raillery
He flicks an almost alarmed glance and then sweeps  to her feet and starts to dance around the garden with her
Because he has threatened me with rain when  wanted it fine, he has found fault with the balance of my curricle and  cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare
If it will be of any satisfaction to you, however, to be told  believe his character to be in all other respects irreproachable,  am ready to confess it
And in return for an acknowledgement that must give me some pain
(he is slowing down) You cannot deny me the privilege
(slower still) of disliking him
(and stopping) as much as  adore
He and  are standing looking at each other
The expression on 's face is heart-stopping has stopped eating and is staring with her mouth open
glances at   but she is gazing up at them with almost as many stars in her eyes as
Suddenly  breaks the mood by swinging away from and gesturing to the house
--this cottage
The tension is broken
starts to chew again
have great plans for improvements to it, you know, Mr Willoughby
Now that  will never consent to
Not a stone must be added to its walls
Were  rich enough,  would instantly pull down Combe Magna and build it up again in the exact image of that cottage
With dark, narrow stairs, a poky hall and a fire that smokes
Especially the fire that smokes
Then  might be as happy at Combe Magna as  have been at Barton
He looks at , who has gone to sit at her mother's feet
But this place has one claim on my affection which no other can possibly share
is so irradiated with happiness that she looks like an angel
Promise me you will never change it
do not have the heart
Or the money
-     - is seeing  off
Miss Marianne, will you--will you do me the honour of granting me an interview tomorrow--alone
Willoughby, we are always alone
But there is something very particular should like to ask you
There is something about his formal tone that makes her feel shy
Of course
shall ask Mamma if may stay behind from church
Thank you
Until tomorrow then--Miss Marianne
He mounts Bedivere and leaves
looks after him, her eyes shining
He is coming to propose
- district of extreme poverty, populated by the  of : , dogs, rats and  of all kinds
In the distance a tavern belches forth drunken  who sway and reel into the night
hooded  pulls up his exhausted steed at the entrance to a slum
He dismounts and looks up at one of the windows
The rags hanging there twitch as if someone is watching for him
He strides inside
- Stepping over a supine  at the foot of the stairs, the flings back his hood--it is , hollow-eyed and dropping with weariness
We follow him up the stairs to a door which is opened by an
- He enters a bare room partitioned with filthy rags hung from the ceiling and lit with stinking tallow lamps
At the window stands the slight figure of a
She turns
reacts with a tender smile which stiffens into an expression of deep shock
We see her silhouette
She is heavily pregnant
She bursts into tears and runs into his arms
- Amongst the small  listening to the sermon drone on, we see the excited faces of ,  and Do you think he will kneel down when he asks her
Shhh
(with satisfaction) They always kneel down
-   - The  return from church to find  grooming Bedivere at the garden gate
Their excitement mounts
-   - They all enter the cottage, talking nonsense loudly in order to signal their presence
giggles
Suddenly, bursts out of the parlour sobbing, and disappears into the room opposite
and  stand by the door in utter consternation, while  -  goes to
What is wrong, my dearest
shakes her head and waves them away
-  - ,  and   enter to find standing in a frozen attitude by the fireplace
Willoughby
What is the matter
--forgive me, Mrs Dashwood
am sent--that is to say, Lady Allen has exercised the privilege of riches upon a dependent cousin and is sending me to London
He cannot look any of them in the eye
When--this morning
Almost this moment
How very disappointing
But your business will not detain you from us for long,  hope
You are very kind--but  have no idea of returning immediately to Devonshire
am seldom invited to Allenham more than once a year
For shame, Willoughby
Can you wait for an invitation from Barton Cottage
My engagements at present are of such a nature--that is-- dare not flatter myself-- The atmosphere is thick with tension
flicks a glance at the three  staring at him in mute astonishment
It is folly to linger in this manner
will not torment myself further
He rushes past them and out of the cottage
They follow him to the door
-   - The  cluster round the door
Willoughby, come back
She is silenced by  as  seizes Bedivere's reins from , mounts up and rides off at a furious pace
-  - They all rush back into the parlour
Meg, dearest, please ask Betsy to make a cup of hot tea for Marianne
nods dumbly and goes
has her arms around
What is wrong, my love
Nothing
Please do not ask me questions
struggles free
Please let me be
She runs off upstairs and we hear her bedroom door slamming
There is a moment of stunned silence
They must have quarreled
That is unlikely
Perhaps this--Lady Allen--disapproves of his regard for Marianne and has invented an excuse to send him away
Then why did he not say as much
It is not like Willoughby to be secretive
Did he think Marianne was richer than she is
How could he
She gestures to the room and then looks at  with a frown
What is it you suspect him of
can hardly tell you
But why was his manner so guilty
What are you saying, Elinor
That he has been acting a part to your sister for all this time
is getting defensive
pauses to think
No, he loves her,  am sure
Of course he loves her
But has he left her with any assurance of his return
Cannot you ask her if he has proposed
Certainly not
cannot force a confidence from Marianne and nor must you
We must trust her to confide in us in her own time
(shaking her head) There was something so underhand in the manner of his leaving
You are resolved, then, to think the worst of him
Not resolved-- (cold) prefer to give him the benefit of my good opinion
He deserves no less
From all of us
She stalks out of the room and starts up the stairs follows her
Mamma,  am very fond of Willoughby-- goes into her bedroom and shuts the door is halfway up the stairs
She meets a wet-eyed  coming down with a cup of tea
She would not let me in
takes the cup and  runs out into the garden in tears
The sound of sobbing also comes from 's room, and now from  's as well
sits down helplessly on the stairs and drinks the tea
-  - The rain has settled in
The cottage looks cold and bleak
-   - carries another uneaten meal from 's room
She looks at the food and tuts in anxiety
-   '  - is sitting by the window looking out at the rain through tear-swollen eyes
's sonnets are on her lap
How like a winter hath my absence been from thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year
What freezings have felt, what dark days seen
What old December's bareness everywhere
-  - Smoke issues from every chimney in the place
-   - Dinner is over
sits listlessly by the window is hiding behind a newspaper
and are looking at a map and discussing routes through China
, ,   and   are at cards
is reading
Oh
If only this rain would stop
(from behind the paper) If only you would stop
and  laugh at him
'Twas you took her off my hands, Mr Palmer, and a very good bargain you made of it too, but now  have the whip hand over you for you cannot give her back
The heavy silence behind the paper attests to the unhappy truth of this statement
Miss Marianne, come and play a round with us
Looking out at the weather will not bring him back
(sotto voce) She ate nothing at dinner
Mind, we are all a little forlorn these days
London has swallowed all our company
and   start to gossip about the disappearances of  and
walks over and sits by , who politely puts aside the book
(low) Dear Miss Dashwood, perhaps now we might have our--discussion
Our discussion
looks around at   and lowers her voice still further, so that  is obliged to move her chair nearer
There is a particular question have long wanted to ask you, but perhaps you will think me impertinent
cannot imagine so
But it is an odd question
Forgive me,  have no wish to trouble you-- She looks away coyly as if deciding whether to speak
My dear Miss Steele-- (interrupting) Miss Dashwood, if only Mr Willoughby had gone home to Combe Magna, we could have taken Miss Marianne to see him
For we live but half a mile away
Five and a half
No,  cannot believe it is that far, for you can see the place from the top of our hill
Is it really five and a half miles
No
cannot believe it
Try
You have my permission to ask any manner of question, if that is of any help
Thank you
wonder, are you at all acquainted with your sister-in-law's mother
Mrs Ferrars
sits back in deep surprise
With Fanny's mother
No,  have never met her
am sure you think me strange for inquiring--if  dared tell-- (shouting over) If she tells you aught of the famous 'Mr ', Lucy, you are to pass it on
tries to ignore  , who is keeping a curious eye on them
Will you take a turn with me, Miss Dashwood
rises and takes 's arm
She guides her as far away as possible from   and
had no idea at all that you were connected with that family
Oh
am certainly nothing to Mrs Ferrars at present--but the time may come when we may be very intimately connected
(low) What do you mean
Do you have an understanding with Fanny's brother Robert
The youngest
No,  never saw him in my life
No, with Edward
Edward
stops walking
Edward Ferrars
nods
Edward and  have been secretly engaged these five years
is frozen to the spot
You may well be surprised
should never have mentioned it, had  not known  could entirely trust you to keep our secret
Edward cannot mind me telling you for he looks on you quite as his own sister
walks on mechanically
Disbelief has set in
am sorry, but we surely--we cannot mean the same Mr Ferrars
The very same--he was four years under the tutelage of my uncle Mr Pratt, down in Plymouth
Has he never spoken of it
(awareness dawning) Mr Pratt
Yes,  believe he has
was very unwilling to enter into it without his mother's approval but we loved each other with too great a passion for prudence
Though you do nor know him so well as , Miss Dashwood, you must have seen how capable he is of making a woman sincerely attached to him
cannot pretend it has not been very hard on us both
We can hardly meet above twice a year
She sniffs and produces a large handkerchief which she holds to her eyes so that the monogram is clearly visible
, seeing the copy of the handkerchief she has held so dear, moves quickly to a chair and sits down
You seem out of sorts, Miss Dashwood-- are you quite well
Perfectly well, thank you
have not offended you
On the contrary
has been watching
Now she rises, unable to contain herself
can stand it no longer,  must know what you are saying, Lucy
Miss Dashwood is quite engrossed
starts to bear down on them
whispers with real urgency
Oh, Miss Dashwood, if anyone finds out, it will ruin him--you must not tell a soul
Edward says you would not break your word to save your life
Promise me
on 's face
give you my word
looms over them
Well, what can have fascinated you to such an extent, Miss Dashwood
Tell us all
cannot speak but  glides smoothly in
We were talking of London, ma'am, and all its--diversions
Do you hear, Charlotte
claps her hands delightedly
While you were so busy whispering, Charlotte and  have concocted a plan
It is the best plan in the world
make for London shortly and  invite you, Lucy, and both the Misses Dashwood to join me
cannot hide her dismay
springs from her seat
London
Oh, can  go
Can  go
You know perfectly well you are too young, dearest
shall convey you all to my house in Berkeley Street and we shall taste all the delights of the season--what say you
Oh, please can  go
'm twelve soon
Mr Palmer, do you not long to have the Misses Dashwood come to London
came into Devonshire with no other view
exerts herself
Mrs Jennings, you are very kind, but we cannot possibly leave our mother
's calculating eyes turn to   with alacrity
Indeed, the loss would be too great
chorus of objections goes up, particularly from , who is both delighted and relieved to see with a smile on her face
Your mother can spare you very well
Of course  can
Of course she can
And look at Miss Marianne--it would break her heart to deny her
will brook no refusal, Miss Dashwood
claps her hands, her eyes ablaze with joy takes 's hand
Let you and me strike hands upon the bargain--and if  do not have the three of you married by Christmas, it will not be my fault
- /'  - We are in  and 's bedroom
is in bed
She is lying on her side with her back to
We are on her face

was never so grateful in all my life as  am to Mrs Jennings
What a kind woman she is
like her more than  can say
Oh, Elinor
shall see Willoughby
Think how surprised he will be
And you will see Edward
cannot reply
Are you asleep
With you in the room
laughs
do not believe you feel as calm as you look, not even you, Elinor will never sleep tonight
Oh, what were you and Miss Steele whispering about so long
on 's expression as she struggles with the impossibility of unburdening herself to her sister without breaking her promise to
After a pause-- Nothing of significance
looks at  curiously, then returns to her packing

waves back with such exuberance that she practically falls out
'  -    - is chattering about London to , who listens with new-found tolerance
is whispering into 's ear
have written to Edward, Miss Dashwood, and yet  do not know how much  may see of him
Secrecy is vital--he will never be able to call
should imagine not
It is so hard
believe my only comfort has been the constancy of his affection
You are fortunate, over such a lengthy engagement, never to have had any doubts on that score
looks at  sharply, but  is impassive
Oh
am of rather a jealous nature and if he had talked more of one young lady than any other
but he has never given a moment's alarm on that count
We can see from 's expression that she understands perfectly
The strain around her eyes is pronounced
Imagine how glad he will be to learn that we are friends

To be sure, my dear, you must just hand it to Pigeon there
He will take care of it
hands a letter to the sphinx-like
We can see a large  in the address
looks at inquiringly but  moves away from her
Lord above, you do not waste any time, Miss Marianne
glances self-consciously at  and follows upstairs
goes up to  and whispers
letter
So they are definitely engaged
Mrs Jennings says your sister will buy her wedding clothes here in town
Indeed Miss Steele,  know of no such plan
But  does not know what else to say
She marches firmly upstairs
'  -   - and  have changed from their traveling clothes and are having a cup of tea
At least,  is is pacing up and down in front of the window
John and Fanny are in town
think we shall be forced to see them
There is a faint knocking from somewhere
jumps
think it was for next door
looks out of the window
Yes, you are right
She sits down with a rueful smile
Suddenly a much louder rap is heard and they both jump
We hear a bustling downstairs
can hardly breathe
She goes to the drawing-room door, opens it, goes out, comes back in
We hear a 's voice
Oh, Elinor
It is Willoughby, indeed it is
She turns and almost throws herself into the arms of Oh
Excuse me, Colonel-- She leaves the room hastily
is so ashamed of 's rudeness that she does not at first notice 's mood of tense distress
Colonel Brandon, what a pleasure to see you
Have you been in London all this while
have
How is your dear mother
Very well, thank you
Silence
Colonel, is there anything-- But  interrupts her
Forgive me, Miss Dashwood, but have heard reports through town
is it impossible to--but  could have no chance of succeeding--indeed hardly know what to do
Tell me once and for all, is everything finally resolved between your sister and Mr Willoughby
is torn between discomfiture and compassion
Colonel, though neither one has informed me of their under standing, have no doubt of their mutual affection
stands very still
Thank you, Miss Dashwood
To your sister  wish all imaginable happiness
To Mr Willoughby, that he
may endeavour to deserve her
His tone is heavy with some bitter meaning
What do you mean
But he recollects himself
Forgive me, --forgive me
He bows and leaves abruptly

Where is dear Edward, John
We expect to see him daily

's sharp eyes dart hither and thither

steels herself
And who is 'dear Edward'
Who indeed

My brother, Mrs Jennings--Edward Ferrars

looks at

immediately assails
Are there any messages, Pigeon
No, ma'am
No message at all
No cards
(affronted) None, ma am
sighs with disappointment and starts up the stairs
looks archly at
note you do not inquire for your messages, Miss Dashwood
No, for  do not expect any, Mrs Jennings
have very little acquaintance in town
And she follows  firmly upstairs
watches her go, and   chuckles and turns to her
She is as sly as you, Lucy
'  -  - wakes up
The flickering of a candle has disturbed her
She sits up in bed and sees  sitting at the desk in her nightgown, writing another letter
Marianne, is anything wrong
Nothing at all
Go back to sleep
'  -   - , in her nightclothes and dressing gown, paces restlessly, her letter in her hands
slight knock at the door heralds a much-ruffled , wig askew
hands him the letter
He bows and goes, highly disgruntled

comes running downstairs
regards her drily
No messages, ma am
looks so dejected that   takes her hand
Do not fret, my dear
am told that this good weather is keeping many sportsmen in the country at present, but the frost will drive them back to town very soon, depend upon it
brightens
Of course
had not thought of-- thank you, Mrs Jennings
She runs back upstairs
calls after her
And Miss Dashwood may set her heart at rest, for  overheard your sister- in-law say that she was to bring the elusive Mr  to the ball tonight
- So many carriages have entered the crescent to deliver the that gridlock has occurred and people are forced to walk to the entrance
We see  , , and  alighting from their carriage and picking their way through the mud, their skirts raised above their ankles
nearly trips and is obliged to grab onto  in order not to slip into the dirt
- The great ballroom is crammed with  all determined to enjoy themselves despite the considerable inconveniences caused by noise, heat and overcrowding
are sweating profusely,  dab their brows, rack punch is being swallowed by the gallon, flirting is conducted at fever pitch and all conversation is inordinately loud
Only the have a modicum of space in which to perform their mincing steps
and her brood bump into the

then spots , who is conducting a desultory conversation with an overpowdered
She drags ,  and  over to her
There you are
Goodness, how hot it is, Mrs Dashwood
You are not alone, trust
Indeed not
John is just gone to fetch my brother--he has been eating ices
clutches at 's sleeve
Your brother
declare, that is good news indeed
At long last
And she beams her approval upon

has seen  threading his way towards them and waves at him
There is someone behind him
preens
bows to them
Mrs Jennings, may  present my brother- in-law
He turns to reveal a good-looking young  with a vacuous smile
Mr Robert Ferrars
My dear ladies--we meet at last
There is a general bowing and shaking of hands
is relieved
drops a low curtsy
So you must be the younger brother
Is Mr Edward not here
Miss Dashwood here was counting on him
looks  up and down
He exchanges glances with before he speaks
Oh
He is far too busy for such gatherings--and has no special acquaintance here to make his attendance worthwhile
looks at  in puzzlement
Well,  declare,  do not know what the young men are about these days-- are they all in hiding
looks down, agonised with embarrassment
Come, Mr Robert, in the absence of your brother, you must dance with our lovely Miss Dashwood
(not best pleased) It would be my honour
He turns to  and bows
And perhaps Miss Steele might consider reserving the allemande
curtsies again
escorts a most unwilling onto the dance floor
You reside in Devonshire,  b'lieve, Miss Dashwood
We do
In a cottage
Yes
am excessively fond of a cottage
If  had any money to spare,  should build one myself
Luckily for  the set changes and she is obliged to turn away from
She wheels round to face her new partner
It is
They both stop dancing and stare at each other aghast
traffic jam starts and they are forced to take hands and resume the steps
(stiff) How do you do, Miss Dashwood
does not know quite how to respond
am well, thank you, Mr Willoughby
She looks about for , instinctively wanting to keep her away from
How is your--family
(cold) We are all extremely well, Mr Willoughby--thank you for your kind inquiry
is shamed into silence
Then he sees
At the same moment the music pauses
looks up
In the brief moment of relative quiet, her great cry rings across the room
Willoughby
Everyone turns to look as  rushes towards him with both arms outstretched, her face luminous with joy
As the noise of the room builds again and  change their partners, we are aware that many are surreptitiously watching
reaches him but  stands with his arms frozen at his side
gives a little confused laugh
Good God, Willoughby
Will you nor shake hands with me
looks extremely uncomfortable and glances towards a group of very smart  who are watching him closely
Central to this group is a   who frowns at him proprietorially
shakes 's hand briefly
Behind her, is giving an animated commentary to  and , while  whispers in 's ear as they go past to join the set
(strangled) How do you do, Miss Marianne
Willoughby, what is the matter
Why have you not come to see me
Were you not in London
Have you nor received my letters
is sweating with tension
Yes,  had the pleasure of receiving the information which you were so good as to send me
(piteously) For heaven's sake, Willoughby, tell me what is wrong
Thank you-- am most obliged
If you will excuse me,  must return to my party
He bows, white to the teeth, and walks away to join the Willoughby
He is drawn away by his , some of whom look back at with a mixture of curiosity and condescension
almost sinks to her knees
supports her
Marianne
Come away
Go to him, Elinor--force him to come to me
has come up, full of concern
Dearest, do not betray what you feel to everyone present
This is not the place for explanations-- Come along, dear
They almost have to drag  away
turns back to the  party
and  have practically imploded with embarrassment and are distancing themselves as much as possible from the source
and  are dancing nearby
Will you come, Lucy
Oh, are we leaving so soon
If  might be so bold, Mrs Jennings, it would be our pleasure to escort your young charge home
How very kind
That is very handsome-- She rushes off to follow  and
We stay for a moment with  and  who have left the set
She actually sent him messages during the night
rises to show the  exiting past the whispering, sneering faces of the
'  -  - sits scribbling a letter at the desk
Marianne, please tell me-- Do not ask me questions
You have no confidence in me
This reproach from you
You, who confide in no one
have nothing to tell
Nor
We have neither of us anything to tell
because  conceal nothing and you because you communicate nothing
'  -   - silent breakfast
is red-eyed from crying and limp from lack of sleep
is dressed to go out, pulling on her gloves and bustling as usual
enters with a letter on a salver
He offers it to
She seizes it and runs out of the room
chuckles
There now
Lovers' quarrels are swift to heal
That letter will do the trick, mark my word
She goes to the door
must be off
hope he won't keep her waiting much longer, Miss Dashwood
It hurts to see her looking so forlorn
She leaves and  finds herself alone with , who loses no time in sharing her new-found happiness
What a welcome  had from Edward's family, Miss Dashwood-- am surprised you never told me what an agreeable woman your sister-in-law is
And Mr Robert--all so affable
It is perhaps fortunate that none of them knows of your engagement
Excuse me
rises and leaves
'  -  - finds  sitting on the edge of the bed
She does not acknowledge  but merely lifts the letter and reads out, with deadly calm: 'My dear Madam-- am quite at a loss to discover in what point  could be so unfortunate as to offend you
My esteem for your family is very sincere but if  have given rise to a belief of more than  felt or meant to express,  shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded
My affections have long been engaged elsewhere and it is with great regret that  return your letters and the lock of hair which you so obligingly bestowed upon me
am etc
John Willoughby
' Oh, Marianne
gives a great howl of pain and flings herself across the bed as though in physical agony
Marianne, oh, Marianne--it is better to know at once what his intentions are
Dearest, think of what you would have felt if your engagement had carried on for months and months before he chose to put an end to it
We are not engaged
But you wrote to him
thought then that he must have left you with some kind of understanding
No--he is not so unworthy as you think him
Not so unworthy
Did he tell you that he loved you
Yes
No--never absolutely
It was every day implied, but never declared
Sometimes  thought it had been, but it never was
He has broken no vow
He has broken faith with all of us, he made us all believe he loved you
He did
He did--he loved me as loved him
bursts through the door in her hat and coat, panting
had to come straight up--how are you, Miss Marianne
begins to sob uncontrollably
Poor thing
She looks very bad
No wonder, Miss Dashwood, for it is but too true
was told here in the street by Miss Morton, who is a great friend: he is to be married at the end of the month--to a Miss Grey with fifty thousand pounds
Well, said , if 'tis true, then he is a good-for-nothing who has used my young friend abominably ill, and wish with all my soul that his wife may plague his heart out
She goes round the bed to comfort
But he is not the only young man worth having, my dear, and with your pretty face you will never want for admirers
sobs even harder
Ah, me
She had better have her cry out and have done with it
will go and look out something to tempt her-- does she care for olives
cannot tell you
leaves
seizes the letter again
cannot believe his nature capable of such cruelty
Marianne, there is no excuse for him-- this is his hand-- But it cannot be his heart
Oh, Mamma
want Mamma
Elinor, please take me home
Cannot we go tomorrow
There is no one to take us
Cannot we hire a carriage
We have no money--and indeed we owe Mrs Jennings more courtesy
All she wants is gossip and she only likes me because  supply it
Oh, God
cannot endure to stay
will find a way
promise
- -   - ,  and  are drinking chocolate together
Apparently they never were engaged
Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds
Marianne is virtually penniless
She cannot have expected him to go through with it
But  feel for Marianne--she will lose her bloom and end a spinster like Elinor think, my dear, we might consider having them to stay with us for a few days--we are, after all, family, and my father
He trails off
exchanges an alarmed glance with
She thinks fast
My love,  would ask them with all my heart, but  have already asked Miss Steele for a visit and we cannot deprive Mrs Jennings of all her company at once
We can invite your sisters some other year, you know, and Miss Steele will profit far more from your generosity--poor girl
That is very thoughtful, Fanny
We shall ask Elinor and Marianne next year, then
Certainly
'   -   - 's carriage stands outside
livened opens the door and  steps out brandishing a new muff
'  -  - sits alone on the bed
Around her lie her notes to Willoughby, her lock of hair and the pocket sonnets
In her hands is the creased and tear-stained letter from Willoughby which she is examining over and over
'  -   - is seated at a desk writing a letter
There is a sudden rap at the front door
Footsteps are heard and as she turns, the maid enters with
rises to greet him
Thank you for coming, Colonel
He bows
is on edge
looks haggard with concern
How does your sister
must get her home as quickly as possible
The Palmers can take us as far as Cleveland, which is but a day from Barton-- Then permit me to accompany you and take you straight on from Cleveland to Barton myself
takes his hands gratefully
confess that is precisely what had hoped for
Marianne suffers cruelly, and what pains me most is how hard she tries to justify Mr Willoughby
But you know her disposition
After a moment  nods
He seems unable to remain still or calm and finds it difficult to begin speaking
Perhaps --my regard for you all-- Miss Dashwood, will you allow me to prove it by relating some circumstances which nothing but an earnest desire of being useful-- You have something to tell me of Mr Willoughby
(nods) When  quitted Barton last--but must go further back
short account of myself will be necessary
No doubt
no doubt Mrs Jennings has apprised you of certain events in my past--the sad outcome of my connection with a young woman named Eliza
nods
What is not commonly known is that twenty years ago, Eliza bore an illegitimate child
The father, whoever he was, abandoned them
This is strong stuff
's concern deepens
As she lay dying, she begged me to look after the child
Eliza died in my arms, broken, wasted away--ah
Miss Dashwood, such a subject-- untouched for so many years--it is dangerous
He paces about, barely able to conceal his distress
had failed Eliza in every other way-- could not refuse her now took the child--Beth is her name-- and placed her with a family where could be sure she would be well looked after
saw her whenever  could saw that she was headstrong like her mother--and, God forgive me, indulged her,  allowed her too much freedom
Almost a year ago, she disappeared
Disappeared
instigated a search but for eight months  was left to imagine the worst
At last, on the day of the Delaford picnic,  received the first news her
She was with child
and the blackguard who had-- stops and looks straight at
Good God
Do you mean--Willoughby
nods
drops into a chair, utterly shocked
Before  could return to confront him, Lady Allen learned of his behaviour and turned him from the house
He beat a hasty retreat to London-- Yes
He left us that morning, without any explanation
Lady Allen had annulled his legacy
He was left with next to nothing, and in danger of losing all that remained to his debtors-- --and so abandoned Marianne for Miss Grey and her fifty thousand pounds
is silent
is breathless
Have you seen Mr Willoughby since you learned
(nodding) We met by appointment, he to defend, to punish his conduct
stares at him, aghast
We returned unwounded, so the meeting never got abroad
nods and is silent for a moment
Is Beth still in town
She has chosen to go into the country for her confinement
Such has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter, and so imperfectly have  discharged my trust
pause
would not have burdened you, Miss Dashwood, had  not from my heart believed it might, in time, lessen your sister's regrets
moves to the door and then stops
He turns to her and speaks with effort
have described Mr Willoughby as the worst of libertines--but  have since learned from Lady Allen that he did mean to propose that day
Therefore  cannot deny that his intentions towards Marianne were honourable, and  feel certain he would have married her, had it not been for--for the money
She looks up at
Silence
'  -  - is sitting on the bed staring into space
is kneeling by her, holding her hands
Dearest, was  right to tell you
Of course
Whatever his past actions, whatever his present course, at least you may be certain that he loved you
But not enough
Not enough
'  -  - sits alone with her head in her hands
Suddenly hustles in looking pleased
Here is someone to cheer you up, Miss Dashwood
She is followed in by
leaves, busy as ever
plants an expression of ghastly concern on her face
How is your dear sister, Miss Dashwood
Poor thing
must say, do not know what  should do if a man treated me with so little respect
hope you are enjoying your stay with John and Fanny, Miss Steele
was never so happy in my entire life, Miss Dashwood
do believe your sister-in-law has taken quite a fancy to me
had to come and tell you--for you cannot imagine what has happened
No,  cannot
Yesterday  was introduced to Edward's mother
Indeed
And she was a vast deal more than civil
have not yet seen Edward but now  feel sure to very soon-- The  comes back
There's a Mr Edward Ferrars to see you, Miss Dashwood
There is a tiny frozen silence
Do ask him to come up
quite involuntarily sits down and then stands up again
is admitted, looking both anxious and eager
As is sitting in the window seat, at first he sees only
Miss Dashwood, how can -- But  cuts him off
Mr Ferrars, what a pleasure to see you
You
know Miss Steele, of course
turns slowly and encounters 's glassy smile
He all but blanches
Then bows, and clears his throat
How do you do, Miss Steele
am well, thank you, Mr Ferrars
has no notion of what to do or say
He swallows
Do sit down, Mr Ferrars
's eyes are sharp as broken glass
remains on his feet, looking helplessly from one woman to the other
You must be surprised to find me here, Mr Ferrars
expect you thought was at your sister's house
This is precisely what  had thought
He tries to smile but his facial muscles won't work
decides to fetch help
Let me call Marianne, Mr Ferrars
She would be most disappointed to miss you
goes to the door, thankful to escape, but prevents her by walking in at that moment
Despite her anguish, she is very pleased to see  and embraces him warmly
Edward
heard your voice
At last you have found us
is shocked by her appearance and momentarily forgets his own confusion
Forgive me, Marianne, my visit is shamefully overdue
You are pale hope you have not been unwell
Oh, don't think of me--Elinor is well, you see, that must be enough for both of us
gestures to  encouragingly but  seems unable to look at her
How do you like London, Marianne
Not at all
The sight of you is all the pleasure it has afforded, is that not so, Elinor
Again,  endeavours to ignite the lovers
tries to silence  with her eyes but to no avail puts their coolness down to the presence of , at whom she glances with a none too friendly air
Why have you taken so long to come and see us
have been much engaged elsewhere
Engaged elsewhere
But what was that when there were such friends to be met
Perhaps, Miss Marianne, you think young men never honour their engagements, little or great
is appalled by this remark but  does not notice it and turns back to  earnestly
No, indeed--for Edward is the most fearful of giving pain and the most incapable of being selfish of anyone ever saw
makes an uncomfortable noise
Edward, will you not sit
Elinor, help me to persuade him
Now  can stand it no longer
Forgive me but  must take my leave-- But you are only just arrived
rises, desperate for them both to go
You must excuse me,  have a commission to attend to for Fanny-- jumps in like a shot
In that case perhaps you might escort me back to your sister's house, Mr Ferrars
There is an extremely awkward pause
would be honoured
Goodbye, Miss Dashwood, Miss Marianne
He shakes hands with  and with , who is silent with dismay
takes 's arm and looks up at him proprietorially
After a stiff bow and a muttered farewell from , they leave
looks at her sister in astonishment
Why did you not urge him to stay
He must have had his reasons for going
His reason was no doubt your coldness
If  were Edward  would assume you did not care for me at all
'   -   - tranquil afternoon
'   -   - is sitting with , who is doing some pointless basketwork
hands  rushes
Poor Miss Marianne looked very badly t'other day
When  think of her, deserted and abandoned, it frightens me to think  shall never marry
Nonsense
You will marry far better than either of the Dashwood girls
How can that possibly be
You have ten times their sense and looks
But  have no dowry
There are qualities which will always make up for that, and you have them in abundance
It would not surprise me if you were to marry far and away beyond your expectations
wish it might be so
There is a young man-- Ah ha
am glad to hear of it
Is he of good breeding and fortune
Oh both--but his family would certainly oppose the match
Tush
They will allow it as soon as they see you, my dear
It is a very great secret
have told no one in the world for fear of discovery
looks up, curious to know more
My dear,  am the soul of discretion
If  dared tell
can assure you  am as silent as the grave
leans forward to whisper in 's ear
'   - We hold a long shot of the house for a moment of silence
Then from inside comes an almost inhumanly loud shriek
(
) Viper in my bosom
'   -   - is trying to drag  out of the house
and are trying to reason with her
loses her grip and falls backwards
flings herself into 's arms
falls over
- is running as fast as her fat little legs will carry her
'  -   - pants up the front steps
'  -  - and  are packing
Their mood is gloomy and uncommunicative
explodes into the room fighting for breath
Oh, my dears
What a commotion
Mr Edward Ferrars--the very one  used to joke you about, Miss Dashwood-- has been engaged these five years to Lucy Steele
lets out a gasp
She looks at , who nods at her in swift confirmation
Poor Mr Ferrars
His mother, who by all accounts is very proud, demanded that he break the engagement on pain of disinheritance
But he has refused to break his promise to Lucy
He has stood by her, good man, and is cut off without a penny
She has settled it all irrevocably upon Mr Robert
But  cannot stop,  must go to Lucy
Your sister-in-law scolded her like any fury--drove her to hysterics
She leaves the room, still rabbiting on
There is a silence
How long have you known
Since the evening Mrs Jennings offered to take us to London
Why did you not tell me
Lucy told me in the strictest confidence
looks at her in complete incredulity
could not break my word
Clearly, there is no arguing this point
But Edward loves you
He made me no promises
He tried to tell me about Lucy
He cannot marry her
Would you have him treat her even worse than Willoughby has treated you
No--but nor would  have him marry where he does not love
tries hard to be controlled
Edward made his promise a long time ago, long before he met me
Though he may
harbour some regret, believe he will be happy--in the knowledge that he did his duty and kept his word
After all--after all that is bewitching in the idea of one's happiness depending entirely on one person, it is not always possible
We must accept
Edward will marry Lucy--and you and  will go home
Always resignation and acceptance
Always prudence and honour and duty
Elinor, where is your heart
finally explodes
She turns upon  almost savagely
What do you know of my heart
What do you know of anything but your own suffering
For weeks, Marianne, have had this pressing on me without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature
It was forced upon me by the very person whose prior claims ruined all my hopes
have had to endure her exultation again and again while knowing myself to be divided from Edward forever
Believe me, Marianne, had  not been bound to silence  could have produced proof enough of a broken heart even for you
Complete silence
Then  speaks in a whisper
Oh, Elinor
bursts into sobs and flings her arms around , who, almost impatiently, tries to comfort her
-   - and   are on the doorstep
looks rather lost and pathetic, with her little bundles, hastily packed
The door opens and  precedes the , ushering them in with shrill cries of sympathy
(
) have heard that your friend Mr Ferrars has been entirely cast off by his family for persevering in his engagement to Miss Steele
'  -  - and  walk round the quiet square
Have  been rightly informed
Is it so
is greatly taken aback by this unexpected query
It is indeed so
Are you acquainted with Mr Ferrars
No, we have never met
But  know only too well the cruelty--the impolitic cruelty of dividing two young people long attached to one another
Mrs Ferrars does not know what she may drive her son to-- He pauses, frowning in remembrance
waits in suspense
have a proposal to make that should enable him to marry Miss Steele immediately
Since the gentleman is so close a friend to your family, perhaps you will be good enough to mention it to him
is completely taken aback
She takes a moment to reply
Colonel,  am sure he would be only too delighted to hear it from your own lips
think not
His behaviour has proved him proud--in the best sense
feel certain this is the right course
'  -  - is waiting
The  announces  and he walks in momentarily
They are alone for the first time in months and for a moment, neither speaks
Mr Ferrars
Miss Dashwood
indicates a seat for him but neither sits
Thank you for responding so promptly to my message
was most grateful to receive it
-- Miss Dashwood, God knows what you must think of me
Mr Ferrars-- He interrupts her, desperate to explain
have no right to speak,  know-- has to stop him
Mr Ferrars,  have good news
think you know of our friend Colonel Brandon
looks completely bewildered
Yes,  have heard his name
starts to speak rather faster than usual
Colonel Brandon desires me to say that, understanding you wish to join the clergy, he has great pleasure in offering you the parish on his estate at Delaford, now just vacant, in the hope that it may enable you--and Miss Steele--to marry
cannot at first take it in
sits down
Colonel Brandon
Yes
He means it as testimony of his concern for--for the cruel situation in which you find yourselves
Now  sits--in shock
Colonel Brandon give me a parish
Can it be possible
The unkindness of your family has made you astonished to find friendship elsewhere
looks at , his eyes full of growing comprehension
No
Not to find it in you
cannot be ignorant that to you--to your goodness-- owe it all
feel it would express it if  could, but, as you know,  am no orator
You are very much mistaken
assure you that you owe it almost entirely to your own merit-- have had no hand in it
But  clearly believes she has been instrumental in the offer
He frowns slightly before speaking with rather an effort
Colonel Brandon must be a man of great worth and respect ability
finds some relief in saying at least one thing that she truly means
He is the kindest and best of men
This makes  seem even more depressed
He sits silent for a moment but then rouses himself to action
May  enquire why the Colonel did not tell me himself
think he felt it would be better coming from
a friend
looks at , his eyes full of sadness
Your friendship has been the most important of my life
You will always have it
Forgive me
Mr Ferrars, you honour your promises-- that is more important than anything else
wish you--both--very happy
They rise
She curtsies
He bows
Goodbye, Miss Dashwood
leaves silently
stands stock-still in the middle of the room
'  - The ' carriage stands outside the house helps  in beside  before mounting his horse to ride alongside
waves goodbye from the steps
The carriage moves off
blows her nose, looks up and down the street in search of gossip and goes back indoors with a sigh
'  -    - is sitting back in her seat with her eyes closed
She does not look well
is behind his newspaper
What a stroke of luck for Lucy and Edward to find a parish so close to Barton
You will all be able to meet very often
That will cheer you up, Miss Marianne
do declare  have never disliked a person so much as do Mr Willoughby, for your sake
Insufferable man
To think we can see his insufferable house from the top of our hill
on 's eyes slowly opening
shall ask Jackson to plant some very tall trees
(from behind the paper) You will do nothing of the sort
'  -   - The carriage bowls along, with  riding next to it
(
) hear Miss Grey's bridal gown was everything of the finest--made in Paris, no less
should have liked to see it, although  dare say it was a sorry affair, scalloped with ruffles--but what do the French know about fashion
-  - The carriage stands outside the  residence, a resplendent affair with a great deal of land
is helping  and  out of the carriage
(
) am resolved never to mention Mr Willoughby's name again, and furthermore  shall tell everyone meet what a good-for nothing he is
(
) Be quiet
and  stand on the steps as the  debauch from the carriage amid a welter of
(sotto voce) do not think she drew breath from the moment we left London
It is my fault-- should have found some other way of getting home
There was no other way you said so yourself
We shall be home soon enough
Mamma will comfort you, dearest
am stiff from sitting so long
Will you tell Charlotte that  am going for a stroll
glances at the sky in concern
think it is going to rain
No, no, it will not rain
cannot help but smile at this return of the old You always say that and then it always does
will keep to the garden, near the house
walks off
watches her go anxiously
-   - , a rather baleful , looks on as holds up a screaming  in a frilly bonnet for everyone's inspection
We are very proud of our little Thomas, Colonel--and his papa has such a way with him
flicks a glance at   for whom holding a baby comes as naturally as breathing underwater
-  - walks purposefully towards the garden wall, beyond which lies a hill
-   - enters to find  alone with the now hysterical There you are, Miss Dashwood
Mr Palmer and the Colonel have locked themselves up in the billiard room
Come and meet little Thomas
Where is Miss Marianne
She is taking a little air in the garden
Oh, very good
That is the great advantage of the countryside--all the fresh air and
and all the fresh air
's conversational difficulties are drowned out by her offspring
-  - comes to a gate in the wall and turns the handle
It opens
She throws a glance back to the house and passes through
There is a low rumble of thunder
-   - is purple in the face but shows no signs of quietening
joggles him about inefficiently
(yelling) He is the best child in the world-- he never cries unless he wants to and then, Lord, there is no stopping him
- , calm and determined, walks towards the top of the hill
The wind whips and plucks at her hair and skirts
-   - , traumatised by her new acquaintance with the shrieking , goes to look out of the window
She frowns
-  - 's
is nowhere in sight
Storm clouds have gathered on the bill
-   - turns from the window
stops crying for two seconds
cannot see Marianne
There is a crack of thunder
starts again
- Rain has started to pour down
walks on regardless
-   - shouts over   to
She has probably taken shelter in one of the greenhouses
- has reached the top
Soaked to the skin, she stands with the storm raging around her, staring at the spires of Combe Magna, the place that would have been her home
Rain streaks her face and the wind whips her hair about her
Through frozen lips she whispers: Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove: 0, no
it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken
-  - is looking for
He enters a greenhouse
Marianne
- stares at Combe Magna, a strange smile playing about her lips
Then she calls to  as though he were near
The effect is eerie, unworldly
Willoughby
Willoughby
-   - ,   and  are waiting anxiously has been removed
is staring out of the window
One thing is certain--she will be wet through when she returns
Thank you for pointing that out, my dear
Do not worry, Miss Dashwood-- Brandon will find her
think we can all guess where she went
- runs up the hillside as though the devil were at his heels
-   - is handing  a cup of tea
turns back to look out of the window
She freezes
-  - 's  of  walking up to the house with cradled in his arms
It is like seeing Willoughby's ghost
-  - Everyone rushes out of the drawing room as the  enters with
He is exhausted and soaked
is dumb with cold and fatigue
She is not hurt--but we must get her warm
and   take  from  and go upstairs, with  in pursuit
-  - The great house sits in darkness
sense of foreboding
-   - is in her nightgown, knocking at a door answers in his nightshirt, astonished to have been summoned out of bed
think Marianne may need a doctor
-   - and  are sitting at the breakfast table
is pacing
The rain has stopped
You'll wear yourself out, Colonel
Do not worry
day or two in bed will soon set her to rights
You can rely upon Harris, Colonel have never found a better physician
Enter  with
(urgent) What is your diagnosis
It is an infectious fever that has taken far more serious hold than would have expected in one so young
would recommend the hasty removal of your child, Mr Palmer-- runs out of the room screaming
Mrs Bunting
Mrs Bunting
-   - is getting into their carriage with and
is on the steps with
He takes her hand and looks at her with real sympathy
My dear Miss Dashwood,  am more sorry than  can say
If you would prefer me to stay  am at your service
is touched to find this warm heart beneath his frosty exterior
Mr Palmer, that is very kind
But Colonel Brandon and Dr Harris will look after us
Thank you for everything you have done
nods, presses her hand, and walks down the steps to the carriage
-   - sits head in hands
His ghosts have come to haunt him
-   '  - is tossing and turning in the bed
is trying to take her pulse
He looks up at , who is watching anxiously
She is not doing as well as  would like
-   - exits the bedroom to find  outside
She jumps
What can  do
Colonel, you have done so much already
Give me an occupation, Miss Dashwood, or  shall run mad
He is dangerously quiet
She would be easier if her mother were here
Of course
Barton is but eight hours away
If  make no stop, you may see us early tomorrow morning
He takes 's hand and kisses it
In your hands  know she will be safe
-  - mounts his horse, turns to look at the house for a moment, and then spurs it violently forward
-   '  - is by the window, having watched 's departure
is by 's side
He turns to
Double the number of drops and will return as soon as  can
- The house stands in virtual darkness with only a dim light issuing from one of the upper rooms
- riding fast, his cape billowing out behind him
-   '  - 's eyes glitter with the fever
wipes her brow
Suddenly she speaks
Who is that
She is looking at the end of the bed
Look, look, Elinor
There is no one there, dearest
It is Papa
Papa has come
looks fearfully towards the end of the bed tries to smile with her cracked lips
Dearest Papa
The dead are coming for the dying
: -   '  - , her eyes red from watching, wipes 's temples
takes her pulse and looks at  anxiously
His silence is worse than any utterance
: -   '  - The room is very still
is pale as wax puts on his coat
looks at him fearfully
must fetch more laudanum
cannot pretend, Miss Dashwood, that your sister's condition is not very serious
You must prepare yourself
will return very shortly
He leaves the room
: -   '  - lies in the grip of her fever
sits watching her
Slowly she rises and walks to the bed
When she speaks, her tone is very practical
Marianne, Marianne, please try-- Suddenly, almost unconsciously, she starts to heave with dry sobs, wrenched out of her, full of anguish and heartbreak and all the more painful for being tearless
Marianne, please try-- cannot-- cannot do without you
Oh, please, have tried to bear everything else-- will try--but please, dearest, beloved Marianne, do not leave me alone
She falls to her knees by the bed, gulping for breath, taking 's hand and kissing it again and again
: -  - shimmer of light appears on the rim of the horizon
Somewhere a lark breaks into clear untroubled song
-   '  - sits slumped in a chair
lies motionless
rises with difficulty from the bedside and goes to the window
She is white as paper
The lark sings
Then, from behind, comes the faintest of whispers
(
) Elinor
turns with a cry
springs from his seat and examines
He then turns to  with a smile of relief and nods
At that moment the sound of carriage wheels is heard on the gravel
My mother
-   - helps  , who is weak with exhaustion and distress, out of the carriage
-  - hurls herself down the stairs
She reaches the door just as  and   enter and practically swoons into her mother's arms
Mamma
She is out of danger
-   '  - on 's face as   kisses her
There, there, my love, my Marianne
opens her eyes and smiles at her mother takes her gently into her arms
suddenly looks anxious
She is too weak to move her head
She whispers with urgent effort
Where is Elinor
am here, dearest,  am here
looks at her with deep relief
Behind the , stands at the door, unwilling to intrude on this intimacy
He wipes his eyes and turns away
sees and whispers to him
Colonel Brandon
turns back, his eyes full of tears
looks at him for a moment
Then, very quietly: Thank you
-    - The cottage nestles in the first buds of spring
piece of rope hangs down from the branches of a tree in the garden
It starts to wave about wildly and we see  emerging and climbing down
She has built herself a new tree-house
(
) What though the sea with waves continuall Doe eate the earth, it is no more at all
-  - is on the sofa by the window
She is pale, convalescent and calm
Different somehow
She listens intently as  reads her the poem
Nor is the earth the lesse, or loseth aught
For whatsoever from one place doth fall, Is with the tide unto another brought
We move back to find   and  at the other end of the room, sewing peacefully
He certainly is nor so dashing as Willoughby but he has a far more pleasing countenance
There was always a something, if you remember, in Willoughby's eyes at times which did not like
listens patiently as her mother rewrites history
We cut back to  as he finishes reading
'For there is nothing lost, but may be found, if sought
He looks up at
soul-breathing glance
She smiles as he closes the book
Shall we continue tomorrow
No--for  must away
Away
Where
(teasing) That  cannot tell you
It is a secret
He rises to leave
(impulsive) But you will not stay away long
on 's reaction
- and  are out on a walk
They go very slowly, leaning on 's arm
Their mood is loving, companion able
- and  walk on
Suddenly,  stops
There
She indicates a spot on the ground but  can see nothing and is momentarily alarmed
gazes at the ground and breathes in deeply
There  fell, and there  first saw Willoughby
Poor Willoughby
He will always regret you
But does it follow that, had he chosen me, he would have been content
looks at , surprised
He would have had a wife he loved but no money--and might soon have learned to rank the demands of his pocket-book far above the demands of his heart
regards  admiringly
smiles sadly
If his present regrets are half as painful as mine, he will suffer enough
Do you compare your conduct with his
No
compare it with what it ought to have been
compare it with yours
Our situations were very different
My illness has made me consider the past
saw in my own behaviour nothing but imprudence--and worse was insolent and unjust to everyone-- tries to stem the flow but  continues
--but you--you  wronged above all
Only  knew your heart and its sorrows but even then  was never a grain more compassionate
brought my illness upon myself-- wanted to destroy myself
And had  succeeded, what misery should  have caused you
embraces her
They stand with their arms round one another in silence for a moment
Then  breaks away and speaks with great good humour and energy
shall mend my ways
shall no longer worry others nor torture myself
am determined to enter on a course of serious study---Colonel Brandon has promised me the run of his library and  shall read at least six hours a day
By the end of the year  expect to have improved my learning a very great deal
- is sitting on the back of a local wagon, holding a basket of food
He jumps off near the cottage and waves a cheery farewell to the
-  - on the accounts book, covered in blots and crossed-out sums
Pull up to reveal  labouring over it
Her sickness has left her slightly short-sighted and she uses a pince-nez that makes her look like an owl
is sewing and   is snoozing
goes up and looks over 's shoulder
She frowns at the spider's web of ink
You'll go blind if you're not careful
brings in coals for the fire
rouses herself
Is Thomas back from Exeter, Betsy
Yes, ma'am--he brung back two lovely fillets for you
looks nervously at  like a child who has been caught out
Beef is far less expensive in Exeter, and anyway they are for Marianne
laughs and rolls her eyes to heaven
turns on her way out to remark: Sixpence a piece, Miss Dashwood
Oh, and he says Mr Ferrars is married, but  suppose you know that, ma'am
There is a stunned silence
Everyone looks at
Fetch Thomas to us, Betsy
leaves
They all sit very still
is about to talk to  about it but  stops her
enters
Beg pardon, Miss Dashwood, but they was the cheapest in the market-- It was a very good price, Thomas, well done
Would you be so kind as to build up the fire a little
(relieved) Yes, ma'am
There is a pause
Who told you that Mr Ferrars was married, Thomas
builds up the fire as he answers
He tells the story with pleasure
seen him myself, ma'am, and his lady too, Miss Lucy Steele as was-- they were stopping in a chaise at the New London Inn
happened to look up as  passed the chaise and see it was Miss Steele
So  took off my hat and she inquired after you, ma'am, and all the young ladies, especially Miss Dashwood, and bid me should give you her and Mr Ferrars's best compliments and service and how they'd be sure to send you a piece of the cake
Was Mr Ferrars in the carriage with her
Yes, ma'am-- just seen him leaning back in it, but he did not look up
screws up her courage
Did-- But she cannot continue
glances at her compassionately and takes over
Did Mrs Ferrars seem well
Yes, Miss Marianne--she said how she was vastly contented and, since she was always a very affable young lady, made free to wish her joy
Thank you, Thomas
He nods and leaves, confused by the silent atmosphere sits for a moment, then gets up and walks out
-  - is standing by the gate, looking out comes down the path to join her
She links arms with and they stand in silence for a beat
Your father once told me not to allow you to neglect yourself
Now  find that it is  who have neglected you most
No, Mamma
Yes,  have
We all have
Marianne is right
am very good at hiding
Then we must observe you more closely
pause
Mamma
Yes, my darling
There is a painful difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event and its final certainty
squeezes 's arm tightly
- horse and cart are jogging along
The cart contains a large object tied down and covered with canvas
The  whistles tunelessly
-  - is standing on the kitchen table while  and pin a piece of material around the bottom of her skirt to lengthen it
Suddenly there is a commotion upstairs
(
) Marianne
Marianne
Come and see what is coming
Everyone runs out of the kitchen
-  - and the  are carrying a small piano up the path
-  - They carry the piano into the parlour and to the ' joyful astonishment it fits perfectly
reads out the letter that has accompanied it
'At last  have found a small enough instrument to fir the parlour expect to follow it in a day or two, by which time  expect you to have learned the enclosed
Your devoted friend, Christopher Brandon
' hands  the letter and a broadsheet song
He must like you very much, Marianne
It is not just for me
It is for all of us
All the same, she looks conscious of the truth
-  - is up her tree
is pulling weeds is sitting on a stool working on 's dress and listening to the strains of the new song which  is singing in the cottage
All of a sudden,   rises, shielding her eyes with her hand
She walks down to the gate, looking out
Here is Colonel Brandon
Marianne
The piano stops
comes out and they all gather at the gate to watch for the rider
- Their  of a  in the distance
-   - do not think it is the Colonel
It must be
He said he would arrive today
You must play him the new song, Marianne
Suddenly there is a yell from 's tree
Edward
practically throws herself out of the tree onto the grass
It is Edward
The women look at each other in complete consternation
Calm
We must be calm
-  - Tense silence reigns
Everyone tries to busy themselves
enters
Mr Ferrars for you, ma'am
follows her in, looking white and agitated
(rising) Edward
What a pleasure to see you
Mrs Dashwood
Miss Marianne
Margaret
Miss Dashwood
hope  find you all well
He bows formally to each of them, lingering on , who is looking firmly at her lap
He looks anxious
Thank you, Edward, we are all very well
There is a pause while they all search for an appropriate remark
Finally  decides to have a go at polite conversation
We have been enjoying very fine weather
looks at her incredulously
Well, we have
am glad of it
The
the roads were very dry
decides to bite the bullet
(giving him her hand) May  wish you great joy, Edward
He takes her hand somewhat confusedly and accepts her offer of a seat
There is an awful silence
tries to help
hope you have left Mrs Ferrars well
Tolerably, thank you
There is another bone-crunching pause
--But  cannot seem to find any words
Is Mrs Ferrars at the new parish
looks extremely confused
No--my mother is in town
He plucks up the courage to look at  again and is evidently not much comforted by what he sees
meant to enquire after Mrs Edward Ferrars
colours
He hesitates
Then you have not heard--the news-- think you mean my brother--you mean Mrs Robert Ferrars
They all stare at him in shock
Mrs Robert Ferrars
has frozen
rises and goes to the window
Yes
received a letter from Miss Steele--or Mrs Ferrars,  should say-- communicating the
the transfer of her affections to my brother Robert
They were much thrown together in London,  believe, and
and in view of the change in my circumstances,  felt it only fair that Miss Steele be released from our engagement
At any rate, they were married last week and are now in Plymouth
rises suddenly,  turns and they stand looking at one another
Then you--are not married
No
bursts into tears
The shock of this emotional explosion stuns everyone for a second and then  makes an executive decision
Wordlessly, she takes 's hand and leads her and   out of the room
-  - The three  come into the garden, still holding hands
-  - cannot stop crying
comes forward, very slowly
Elinor
met Lucy when  was very young
Had  had an active profession, should never have felt such an idle, foolish inclination
At Norland my behaviour was very wrong
But convinced myself you felt only friendship for me and it was my heart alone that  was risking
have come with no expectations
Only to profess, now that  am at liberty to do so, that my heart is and always will be yours
looks at him, her face streaked with tears of released emotion, of pain and of happiness
- and   are stamping about in the garden trying to keep warm
has climbed into her tree-house
The branches rustle
He's sitting next to her
/ Margaret, come down
/Is he
(scolding) Margaret
Will you stop-- What's happening now
Marianne
(
) He's kneeling down
can't help herself
Oh
Is he
Oh
