She walks over to comfort him
Now, now class let's not make fun of Mordechai's spinning top
We need to all learn the importance of tolerance and understanding
Isn't that right Mordechai
Yes Mrs
Highsmith
So class, in honor of Mordechai's special day, 'd like for all of us to wish Morty a heartfelt Merry
She looks to Mordechai for confirmation on the word

In unison, the class attempts to repeat the words, but all suffer various degrees of pronunciation problems
(') Very good class
hope you've all learned an important lesson today
Just because Mordechai's people are different from us
just because they might appear strange to us with their furry hats, their beady eyes, and their long sideburns
not to mention their bizarre customs and unnecessarily guttural, funny sounding names
just because they control all of the worlds' money, yet are too cheap to buy their children anything better than spinning tops for presents, does not mean that we can't learn to respect and love them as our equals
She squeezes his cheek

Santa addresses Damian

Blitzen returns the gesture with a nod of acknowledgment

On the slide projector screen behind Damian, we see the silhouetted images of Blitzen and Rudolph goring Santa through the chest with their antlers
Damian cringes
Blood trickles from Santa's mouth, and with his last breath he utters the words
Et tu, Blitzen
Santa falls out of frame with a thud
Standing behind him with bloodied antlers is Blitzen
Damian walks over to the newly deceased Santa, takes his bloodstained Santa's hat, and put it on his own head

The Group Leader shakes his head in one last respect, and then turns away from the Hammer as he goes back to his class
On the back of his gi is written the word "-
" minion practicing Jew-do, the deadly fighting art

The two leave, and continue their walk down the hallway

The Chief stops behind the man and taps him on the back

Well it's good to see that you can be so nonchalant about the whole thing

Okay
You guys have seriously got to stop with that stuff
That's a lot of pressure to put on one Jew

You know, believe it or not, 'm allowed to make mistakes, too

Okay
Alright, 'm out of here
: - We see various shots of the Hammer's Caddy
The grill, the white wall tires, the fuzzy dreidel hanging from the rear view mirror, etc
Very 'Superfly
' - We start on an incredibly impressive looking building
Over this we see the words "  " typed out sequentially
The camera than tilts down to reveal a Popeye's Chicken
scouts the street with a pair of binoculars
- Instead of the usual two circles, we see the world through two cutouts of the African continent
The Hammer's Caddy pulls up
Oh shit
The teen runs inside
The Hammer's Caddy pulls up to a stop right at camera, giving us a full view of the license plate
It reads, "

The black teenager enters breathlessly
Hey, yo, we got ourselves a visitor

) Who is it
It's some pimped out Hebrew dude in a caddy
The men scramble for their guns, inserting clips, and removing safeties
The front doors bust open, and we  into the Hammer
All guns are trained on him
From behind the frontline of gunmen, , clearly the leader of the operation, pushes his way through
He walks towards the Hammer
You can feel the tension in the room
The Hebrew Hammer
My main Kike
Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim

The two embrace in a warm hug
The White Accountant looks up in shock from the card table
His nametag is clearly visible, and it reads, "
" He points at Mohammed
You
you just called him a Kike
He points to the Hammer
(') And you
You just called him a Nigger
The Hammer and Mohammed look to one another
They're having a hard time understanding his concern
Well it's okay when we call each other that
The White Accountant thinks it over for a second
Oh
The other Brothers put their guns down and go back to their pre-Hammer activities, and the accountant takes his place back at the card table
Mohammed puts his arm around the Hammer
So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the

You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa
Oh, most definitely
Got the brothers here in full alert mode
The Hammer looks over at the Brothers smoking weed, making out with their girlfriends, etc
Mohammed takes notice
(') Gotta always be cool under pressure
You know what 'm sayin
True dat
True dat
So, what's the word on the street
Word is that papa's got a brand new bag, and it's velvety red, and it ain't gonna be overnight Fed-Exed to Jerusalem
If you know what  mean
This clearly flies over the Hammer's yarmulke
Actually,
don't
What does that mean
Oh
It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up
Not if  can help it
You got any information for me
don't
But  know somebody who does

Inside, , a black elf, sits on a sofa

First that motherfucker kills his own pops, then he start talkin' 'bout bustin a cap in Hanukkah's ass
Next, the racist motherfucker kick my ass out the workshop, sayin' that there ain't no room for no little colored elves like me

Yo, if it wasn't for the arthritis in my joints, you best believe that 'd be
Jamal makes the sideways gun holding gesture, and mock pulls the trigger

Is there anything else you can tell me
His hangouts, his next move, anything
Jamal thinks for a second
Well, come to think of it, there is one thing
Before  left,  was packin' up my shit and  overheard the nigga talkin' to some business pahtnah or something
Sayin that he'd meet him today at some joint called Duke's
Round five o'clock if my memory serves
When he got off the phone and jetted,  scoped the room for some jewelry, cash, whatevers
You know, a severance package
Didn't find any duckets, but  did snatch this
Jamal pulls out a matchbbok from his pocket
The front cover reads, "' -

Shit fool, ain't no thang

Mohammed and the Hammer head towards the door
He's new
He's still got a long way to go before he understands the true meaning of Kwanzaa
Thanks again Mo, you always deliver the goods
You watch your back Hammer
Hanukkah might just be his first move
For all we know Kwanzaa could be next
There's a lot of brothers counting on you
If you fail
Okay, look

Although behind him hangs a banner reading, "' ," the interior is a run down sweatshop

) It's me
He's on his way
Excellent
Everything is going as planned
Santa puts the walkie-talkie down, and addresses somebody (') With the Hebrew Hammer out of the picture, Hanukkah will be nothing more than a confusing and hard to pronounce word
want to thank you very much Jamal for all of your help
We cut to the other side to reveal whom he's speaking to
Jamal, the same black 'elf' from the Kwanzaa Liberation Front sits at the table across from Santa
Pfff
Shit nigga, ain't no thang
Hey, yo Santy Claus, so does this mean that you gonna make me an official elf now
Can you believe this guy Tiny Tim
Santa looks over to
Unshaven, not so tiny anymore, and still on crutches, Tiny Tim's grown up since ' Christmas Carol
'  common street thug
'mon, did you seriously think that Scrooge would give free handouts to the Cratchit family forever
Tiny Tim shrugs his shoulders
(') Take a look around you Jamal
Do you see any colored midgets in my workshop

That's some cold shit
The  appear to be struggling with the speed at which the products move down the assembly line
The   steps out from the assembly line and addresses Santa
Utopian model of efficiency my ass
Ever since you took charge, this place has been more like a sweatshop
The other elves stop working and vocalize their agreement with the Head Elf
(') We know our rights Santa
You're in violation of the union regulations
We're going on strike
The other elves shout out their approval
Santa takes it all in stride
You know something, you're right
The Head Elf is taken aback by what seems to be a glimpse of compassion on Santa's part
Really
Yeah
This is a sweatshop
And since you elves aren't willing to do the work, made arrangements to have some Taiwanese children shipped over
And  might add, they're more than willing to work for peanuts
Santa performs the two fingered whistle
(') Come on in boys

As each child passes Santa, he hands them each a bag of At the assembly line, the Taiwanese boys move like lightning as they gift wrap boxes clearly labeled "," " ," and "

Defeated, they shuffle out of the workshop
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa
While  was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems,  came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet

Santa walks over to a - truck overflowing with large brown cardboard boxes marked '

Oh, that's the beauty of it

Heroin
Cocaine

Santa slits open one of the boxes with a large knife and pulls out a  generically labeled, "It's Wonderful Life

He steps up to the counter, where a   with a Manson-like swastika inked on his forehead studies him curiously
Manischewitz
Straight up
Usually we don't serve your kind
But since you had the balls to walk in here, Kike, 'll pour you one last drink before we lynch you
The bartender reaches for a bottle of cherry flavored Manischewitz wine
The Hammer interrupts him by clearing his throat
Actually, can  have the black label
The Bartender eyeballs him, and then grabs the bottle of Black Label Manischewitz
He grabs a glass from the rack, and begins to pour

The Hammer slams on his breaks, skidding to a stop just inches from the kid
It's Shlomo (remember the kid the Hammer helped with the Yarmulke earlier
), and he has a strange glazed look in his eyes
Shlomo holds a videocassette in his hand
The Hammer steps out of the Caddy, leaving his car door open
We hear the annoying beep, beep, beep door ajar sound
Shlomo, you okay
(Dreamily) Mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing, an angel gets his wings
Huh
The car door beeps again
The kid looks to it, and the Hammer follows his gaze
Mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing, an angel gets his wings
The Hammer is baffled
He looks down at Shlomo's hand and spots the videocassette

Now get going

As he dials, he verbalizes the number he's calling
555-55-555-55555
The Hammer struggles with the last number, but then quickly remembers

It rings once, and then we hear the other line pick up

Chief, it's me
Listen carefully

How'd you do with Santa
It was a trap
'm back at square one
Well, then 've got good news for you
We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today

Good thinking
We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected
Now that he thinks 'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen
One last thing Hammer
You take care of yourself

Right
Yeah, Got it
Will do
Okay, bye now
He hangs up and leaves

huge 'Citizen Kane'/Big Brother style poster with a menacing picture of Santa looms behind them
It reads, " :    '
" Santa's staging area is very Studio 54
Both Tony and Mikey are decked out in Addidas warm up pants, gold chains, etc
Tony, very Guido in his mannerisms, replies into his walkie
Nothing stirring here

Can  be next
Please, please
Let's get a look at you, shall we
The Gentile Girl pulls her Power Muff Girls -shirt down, allowing the two to get a better look at it

Very nice
Alright, now spin around
She twirls for the two

Alright
You're cool
Go on and see Santa, sunshine
pushy,     steps out of line and approaches the two
That's not fair
How come she gets to go next
We were here first
Oh really
Is that a fact
Well guess what buddy
You ain't gettin' in to see Santa today, so why don't you just turn around and high tail it home
The kid begins to sob uncontrollably
But 've been waiting to see Santa all year
Tony apes him
But 've been waiting to see Santa all year
The kid is a pathetic mess
(') You heard me
Get moving punk
: The Hammer and Esther scope out the area
The Hammer is disguised terribly, consisting of a baseball hat on top of his Shtreml, and a Jesus Fish -shirt worn over his black suit
Esther's visibly nervous
Any sign of Santa
He must be behind that curtain
Relax
We're undercover
We need to give off the appearance of calm
You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in
Act as a Gentile would
The two pass a samples booth
The    solicits the Hammer
Could  interest you in a free sample bacon cheeseburger
We get a  of the burger followed by a  of the Hammer
He's mortified, but he pulls it together
While  thank you, Gentile friend, for your generous offer of that deliciously unkosher snack,  sadly have to decline for  stuffed myself full of meat and milk product at a prior lunch engagement
The Sample Woman looks at him strangely as the Hammer and Esther walk on
You're good
The two take their place at the end of the line in to see Santa
Tony performs the two fingered whistle
Can  have everyone's attention please
In fifteen minutes, Santa's gonna have to leave
The kids all vocalize their disappointment
(') Ah, don't be like that kids
We gotta lot work to do if we're gonna get all those presents out in time
The kids aren't buying it
More boos and protests of disapproval
(') Hey
Hey
You want shitty ass presents for Christmas
You want Barbies with heads screwed on backwards
You want remote control cars without the batteries included
Then be my fucking guest
Tony spits and grabs his crotch as he turns back around to take his place in front of the velvet ropes
Esther surveys their place in line
It's about fifteen deep
What are we going to do
We're at least an hour from the front
'mon follow me
The two make their way up to the front of the line
They pass a man who looks eerily like ex-rapping god,
(To Hammer) Is that
No, couldn't be
Hey, hey
Not so fast
We have to get through
It's an emergency
Sorry pal, you're gonna have to wait in line just like all the other parents
Esther adjusts her bust
She's incredibly sexy in her tight fitting denim jacket
She smiles flirtatiously at the Elves
We're so sorry to have to cut, but our beautiful Gentile boy ran on ahead of us in line
She puts her hand on Tony's bicep and smiles once again
(') It would mean so much to Paul and  if you'd let us through to see Santa
Tony is putty in her hands
Well
umm, when you put it that way
Sure go on through
Tony unhinges the rope, and the two pass
The Hammer leans over to Esther
You're good
: , an adorable six year old sits on Santa's lap
Santa's assistants, two busty blondes named  and , flank his chair
And what do the Jewish people do during Hanukkah
They worship the devil and sacrifice small Gentile children like me in bizarre, sadistic rituals
That's right
Santa can tell that you've been a very good boy this year
Run along now Jimmy
Bambi and Tawni escort Jimmy out, and re-enter with Esther and the Hammer
Santa's confused
(') Sorry folks,  don't do couples
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt
Excuse me
Do  know you, friend
Take a look around you
Do you even know who am
The Hammer rips off his baseball hat and -shirt
Santa gasps
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah
The Hebrew Hammer
You're alive
The Hammer takes out his gun and points it Santa
What's your shpiel, Santa
Whoa, whoa there
'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend
Let's cut out all the unpleasantness
admit,  went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing
Let me make it up to you
How about a peace offering
(To Bambi and Tawni) Girls
Santa snaps his fingers, and Bambi and Tawni drape themselves on either side of the Hammer, rubbing his arms erotically
(') Bambi
Tawni
'd like for you to meet world renown Semitic super stud, Mordechai Jefferson Carver
Bambi speaks with a thick Southern drawl
Oh,  declare  just love Jewish men
They're so sensitive and well read
Esther is clearly jealous
The Hammer's enjoying the attention
He looks down at Bambi's breasts
We're talking , obviously augmented boobolas large crucifix chain hangs around her neck, nestled in between the mounds of silicone
We hear the requisite  as it sparkles
The Hammer is released from the sexual spell of the Gentile Seductress
Sorry Santa
like my women like my matzah
Unleavened
The girls move away from the Hammer
Esther smiles at the Hammer's resolve
(') This is where you go down
Suddenly, Tony draws the curtain back
Hey, hurry it up in there
We gotta bunch of kids
He sees the Hammer with his gun pointed at Santa's head
(') Oh shit
Esther pulls out her piece and points it at Tony
Back it up buddy
He does
The entire crowd of children can now see what's happening
Hushed, fearful whispers
Hammer steps out of line and pleads
Please Hammer, don't hurt em'
The Hammer does a double take
Hammer gives a "Did  just say that
" expression
Let's do this clean
don't want to make a scene Santa
Santa stands up slowly with his hands raised
Well, it's a bit too late for that now, isn't it
Excuse me children, if  could have your attention for a moment
What are you doing
'm just calming the kiddies
(To children) There's no need to worry about Santa
He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer
The Hammer plays along, raising his hand to keep the children calm
Hey everybody
How's it hangin'
In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year
The Hammer and Esther look to one another
This riles the masses
Trouble
(') Why don't we show him how that makes us feel
: - We hold a few beats on a shot of this fairly untrafficked portion of the mall
Suddenly, Esther and the Hammer haul ass around the corner, running for their lives
second or two pass, and an   of about twenty Gentile children round the corner after them
They're definitely not in the Christmas spirit
The Hammer and Esther take another turn
From the other direction a     head straight at them
The Hammer spots another corridor in front of them
'mon
They run about a hundred yards before they hit a wall
dead end
we can hear the throng of children nearing in the (
) Where'd they go
saw them go down that hallway
'mon, let's get em'
Hammer turns to Esther defeated
It's over
We're doomed
The barely audible sound of a gospelized version of the Biblical slave song, "Let My People Go" sounds as if it's coming from within the walls of the mall
Shh
Shh, listen
Do you hear that
The Hammer tries to place the source
What is that
Suddenly, a panel on the wall slides open to reveal a door
The other side of the door is dark, but it has a cavernous feel to it
An elderly Jewish woman,  , appears from out of the doorway
She smokes a corncob pipe
Psst
Hammer, Esther
This way
Hurry
Harriet escorts the two into the passageway, and the door slides shut behind them
- We appear to be in what looks like the loading dock for an 'It's  Small World After All' type water ride
Harriet leads Esther and the Hammer into one of the waiting cars
The cars kind of have a baby Moses straw basket theme going on
The 'Let My People Go' song, piped from unseen speakers, is now at full strength
You saved our lives
Thank you
How can ever repay you
My name is Harriet Tubbelman, but you can call me Moses
The only payment  ask Mordechai, is that you keep Hanukkah safe for us all
She hands each of them a ticket and then lowers the lap restraints for Hammer and Esther, testing them to make sure they're secure
(') You should be safe from here on out
Just follow the river to it's conclusion
She begins to walk away, but then catches herself as she turns back to face them
(') Oh yeah, and keep your arms and legs inside the water craft at all times
Where are we
What is this place
She smiles with great pride
Welcome to the Underground Jewish Railroad
Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride
The brakes on the water craft release, and the craft makes it way from the loading dock
Wide eyed, Esther and Hammer check out their surroundings
Hasidic Animatronic puppets sing of thousands of years of Jewish oppression and persecution in an educational, yet oddly entertaining way
The Hammer puts his arm around Esther and continues to check out the attraction in wonderment
Esther secretly glances at him affectionately
It's clear she's falling for him
We cut to a wide shot as we watch the craft disappear down the river
funkdafied version of the "Let My People Go" song   and over the gospel version from the ride
- We see a non-descript door in the middle of a brick wall
Two turnstiles stand directly in front of the door
We can hear the muffled sounds of the gospel version of "Let My People Go
" Scribbled on the wall is the graffiti phrase, " " The door opens, and the obnoxiously loud music spills out into the street
The Hammer and Esther exit, close the door, and push their way past the turnstiles into the alley
That got annoying fairly quickly
Yeah, no kidding

The two hand the Carnival Worker their tickets
(') Thanks for riding the Underground Jewish Railroad
If you plan on returning today, please make sure to get you hands stamped before you leave the alley
Nah, we're kosher
Thanks though
The two walk past him
Esther turns to the Hammer
So, now what
Now we wait for Santa to make his next move
He gives her a once over
She is stunning
(') Want to get a drink
Sure
Why not
- Your typical Blaxploitation bar
It could easily pass for the Lenox Lounge in Harlem, with the exception of the large menorah shaped sign out front
- We see a bar packed with
separating the men and women in the bar runs along the center of the room, stopping about ten feet from the stage
Signs clearly demarcate these '' and '' sections
Onstage, a  band plays a rendition of a to be determined 70's funk classic
Esther and the Hammer enter the joint
Mid song, the notices the two walk in
Hey
The Hebrew Hammer everybody
The Hammer raises his hand in acknowledgment
The entire bar cheers and applauds
Hammer escorts Esther to a table on the woman's side of the wall, and then walks around to the other side of the divider where he takes a seat opposite the wall from her
The band begins a rousing version of "Hava Nagila
"  good majority of the men in the bar rush to the dance floor and begin dancing zealously with one another
Esther shouts over the wall in an attempt to overcome the din of the bar
So, do you come here often
The Hammer struggles to hear
He shouts back to her
What was that
said, do you come here often
Oh
Yeah, about once a week
What
said, yeah, about once a week
Oh
approaches the Hammer and smiles
Would you like to dance
We get another shot of the men dancing together, arm in arm, on the dance floor
'm okay right now
Thanks though
As the Patron leaves, , another Hasidic man standing directly behind him takes his place at the Hammer's table
Hey Morty, wanna cut a rug
Nah, 'm good
'm kind of here with somebody
The Hammer motions to the wall
Joshua looks as if his feelings are hurt
Oh
Okay
Maybe next time
Yeah
Maybe next time Joshua
Take it easy
As Joshua leaves, we get a  shot of the Hammer's table
leads up to it
, an effeminate slick Hasidic man, chest hair spilling out of his loosely buttoned butterfly collar shirt, neck dripping with gold chains, steps up to the Hammer
He's got a huge phoney smile plastered across his face
Well Shalom there mister
Do we know each other
No, but we have mutual friends
Chaim points to the dance floor
Another shot of men dancing with one another, arm in arm
(') The name's Feygele
Chaim Feygele
This guy is clearly making the Hammer nervous
Mordechai
My friends call me Morty
So Morty,  just love a man in a black suit
Care to dance
Mordechai is flustered
Uhhh
You know,
have to go to the bathroom
'll be right back
The Hammer gets up quickly and leaves
We cut to Esther's side of the wall
The Hammer walks behind her while she checks out the band on stage
(') Hey there
She turns around, pleasantly surprised
Hey
Do you want to get out of here
She looks relieved
would love to get out of here
'  - smooth, laid back Blaxploitation era song pumps from the speakers
We do a   from the stereo into a of Esther and the Hammer slow dancing
Sexy
Esther grunts and moans a bit
We begin a   back from the two, eventually pulling back far enough to see what Esther's moaning about
The Hammer is a seriously terrible dancer, stepping on her toes, forcing her into awkward positions, etc
We see a  of the Hammer accidentally stepping on her toes yet again
Ouch
Esther pulls herself away from the Hammer
Sorry
'm better with men
(Sensually) Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing
You mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke
Oh
get it
We see a    of Esther
Her erect nipples are clearly outlined through her blouse
Now, the Hammer's really getting it
(') Now we're talking Boobola
Mordechai
Yes Esther
want you to talk dirty to me
Oh
Okay
He thinks for a moment
(') want to have lots of children by you
Get a good paying, stable job
Settle down in Long Island somewhere
Someplace nice
Fancy
But not fancy schmancy
She's warming up
(') want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons
Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar
Keep going
Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel
Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism
She's on fire for him
Oh god, yes
Keep going
Don't stop
Also, on a daily basis,  want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how  should live my life
Kiss me you Semitic stud
She grabs him and kisses him passionately
(') (Playfully) Hmm
feel something poking around down there
Maybe  should investigate
What do you think about that Mr
Certified Circumcised Dick
She begins to unzip his pants
We cut to a shot of an excited Mordechai as we hear the sound of the unzipping of his pants reach its conclusion
on her as she looks down at his Jewish Manhood
wide eyed, almost shocked reaction
She slowly looks back to him and smiles slyly
(') Shabat Shalom
As the two embrace, we   from the two of them in the to the Hanukkah candles burning brightly on the menorah in the
We blur out of focus
: - The sun rises over the city
'  - We start close on the Hammer's hand as he screws a light bulb into his electric Menorah until it glows orange
Esther caresses the Hammer's chest as the two enjoy a post coital cigarette
Wow, that was amazing
The Hammer gives her ass a smack, and then picks up a container filled with some kind of
He snorts a bit of it off of the Star Of David chain that hangs from his neck, and places the container of white powder back in its place by the menorah
Esther is mortified
(') What did you just snort
Antihistamine
It's for my allergies
The capsules make me gassy
She relaxes
(') You know, 've been thinking about what Santa's got planned for us next
Maybe he'll
She cuts him off
Your mother was right
You do work too hard
Oh, she said that, did she
What else did Mommy Dearest have to say
Well, she also said that you need to find a nice girl to help take your mind off of your work
'm just glad she thought was good enough for you
The Hammer sits up
When did you guys have this conversation
When  was in the bathroom
What else did she have to say
Relax Morty,  think your mom is wonderful
She cares so much about you
Get this, while you were gone she said she'd help me get you to work with the if 'd come eat by you once in awhile
Like  needed any incentive to be with you
She's so
The Hammer goes into a fit
What
You made a deal with my mother to sleep with me if 'd help you
No
Of course
What does that make you
What does that make me
And my mother
What does that make her
He makes a realization
(') Oh my god
She's become my pimp
And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder
No
It's not like that
You're being completely neurotic
was just playing along
He thinks aloud
Always meddling in my life
This is so typical of her
(To Esther) But from you
thought we had something good here
We do
'm sorry Esther,  just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore
The phone , and the Hammer picks it up
(') Hammer here
We
The Chief is on the other end
Hammer, it's the Chief
We've got ourselves a situation
Get yourself down here, 've got something you need to see
: -   - The Star Of David vault-like doors open, and the Hammer and Esther hurriedly enter the room
The Chief waits for them
Mordechai
Thank god you're here
What's up
About an hour ago, we received this transmission from the North Pole
He clicks a button on a remote control, and static fills the , eventually fading into the image of a larger then life
And now my Hanukkah loving friends, will reveal to you the true nature of my diabolical scheme
An image of a   in the shape of a Star Of David
(
) (') The Jewish Atomic clock, located in the outskirts of Jerusalem
Keeper of time for the Jewish Calendar
Powered by Judeum
An element so rare, it exists only inside the clock itself
We  down to reveal a    in its base
Santa comes back on screen
(') Once  extract the Judeum from the clock, the Jewish Calendar will cease to exist, forever eradicating Hanukkah
In less than twenty four hours, which by your Jewish Calendar is approximately
He struggles with this one
He looks at someone
at the North Pole
(') (To someone at North Pole) Can  borrow that pen and notepad
notepad and pen are handed to him from
Santa makes some written calculations on the notepad
He's clearly having trouble
The Hammer and Esther exchange looks
(') (Uncertain) Four years and three quarters a lunar cycle
(Shifting back into psycho mode) Well, whatever
In less than twenty four Christian hours, Hanukkah will be nothing more than a fond memory
Tiny Tim
Tiny Tim hobbles into frame on his crutches
Merry Christmas everybody, and god bless us, everyone
The two laugh hysterically
End transmission
The transmission, however, doesn't end
The two abruptly stop laughing
Santa begins to talk to
(') So, how was
It was good
Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about
Really
Good, good
We cut to more confused reactions of the Hammer and Esther
(') wasn't too over the top
No, it was the perfect level
Thanks
Oh, did  tell you
picked up that new  and the Sunshine Band record that you recommended
You were right, it is good
Santa looks towards the camera and begins to react strangely
(') (To
Cameraman) Why is the red light on the camera still on
Are you still filming me
Santa approaches the camera
(') You fucking ass
Static fills the screen
The Hammer turns to the Chief
Looks like  got a plane to catch
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup
No way, it's too dangerous
Besides, my days of hooking are over
You're not my bitch Mordechai
Please, you have to believe me
Did  miss something here
It's a long story
'll explain when get back from saving the clock
He turns his attention to Esther
(') Alone
The Hammer exits
Esther is dejected
Tail him
He's gonna need the help
: -  - shot of an airplane landing are the words, "   -
" '  (
) Shalom
Welcome to the Ben Gurion airport
For ground transportation, please proceed to Terminal 18
We cut to the Hammer who's watching this stock footage of the airplane landing on a   by the "" car rental counter
- The Hammer approaches the counter where a female stands waiting
Do you speak English
Yes
Chello
The Ch sound she makes is accompanied by a whole lot of spittle
The Hammer wipes his face, and then returns the favor
Chello
She's unfazed
The Hammer continues
(') need to rent your biggest Cadillac
Preferably lowered, with white wall tires
She checks her rental sheet
'm so sorry sir, but somebody just rented our last Chadillac
She nails him again
Seriously annoyed, he wipes his face clean once more
Well what else do you have
Well, we do have a Ch
The Hammer puts his hand up as a shield and cuts her off quickly
Whatever it is, 'll take it
: - 70's road music occupies the soundtrack as we see a shot of the fast moving pavement of the open road
Slowly, we to reveal the Hammer throttling a monstrous The Hammer's Talis flaps wildly in the wind
His Shtreml helmet is strapped on tight over his goggles
The scenery, oddly enough, resembles the Mojave Desert
We cut to a sign reading "   : " On it, we see an illustration of a housing compound surrounded by a remarkable amount of We  over to the highway as the Hammer zips past on his motorcycle
'  - The Hammer, unaware of her presence, speeds by her large Cadillac
She puts the car into gear
- Tucked out of sight behind a billboard, Esther pulls off from her side of the road and onto the highway in pursuit of the Hammer
And yes, the car is lowered, with white walled tires
The camera makes it way up to reveal a large , resembling the ones you might see advertising casinos on the drive into Vegas announces " 20 Kilometers

For no apparent reason, a small sits near the front door

Go, go, go
The Head Elf jumps out, and out of frame
: An   stand by a   , studying it curiously
The Head Elf walks into frame
(') What's this doing here
Not sure
think it was left over from an Israeli Robbie Kneivel television special
You want me to get rid of it
No time
Besides, it's not like someone's gonna jump their motorcycle into the building while we're inside
The    points up towards the sky
(') There's Santa now
The Thug Elves look up to the sky, and we do an as helicopter force winds blow their hats off
The carriage of '  touches down on the ground
Tiny Tim sits shotgun in the sleigh while Santa vomits violently over the other side
Santa finishes up, and wipes his mouth with his hand
You okay
No
'm airsick you asshole
Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly
don't know
Why don't you ask them sir
Santa takes this in
: Santa paces as a Drill Sargent would in front of the line of harnessed reindeer
They're shivering in their hooves
Who's the leader of this operation
More scared reindeer faces
Comet furtively motions towards Rudolph with his antlers
Santa sees this, marches quickly up to Rudolph, and gets in his face
(') What's your major malfunction, dumbfuck
Rudolph's scared shitless
(') Step forward son
Rudolph attempts to move forward, but the harness attachments prevent him from doing so
Uh, he can't sir
The harnesses
You can feel the Robert Deniro-esque intensity boiling inside of Santa
You gonna learn to guide this sled right
You gonna make sure your men follow suit
Because if 'm puking down chimneys come Christmas Eve, 'm gonna have your hide
We clear
Rudolph shakes his head
The bells on his harness tinkle
Santa continues to stare down the reindeer as he walks away
Rudolph is clearly broken, but continues staring back at Santa as he makes his way out of frame
The expression on Rudolph's face changes from fear to insolence as he angrily follows the
Santa
Suddenly, Santa charges right back into frame, and places his drawn gun to Rudolph's temple
(') You eyeballin' me son
Rudolph quickly looks away
Santa puts his gun back into his belt, and then adjusts his suit and hat as if to regain his composure
Without warning, Santa throws a fake punch at Rudolph's face, forcing the reindeer to flinch
(') didn't think so
- Santa and his gang bust through the front doors, taking the by surprise
Santa's men quickly tie them up and duct tape their mouths shut as if out of 'Gulliver's travels
' The guards are dragged away out of frame
Santa steps towards camera and surveys the room
The Jewish Atomic Clock
It's the kind of place where a giant telescope at an observatory would be housed
The clock is breathtaking in its size
On its face, in place of the standard numerals are the names of Jewish holidays
For example, "Yom Kipur" is where the twelve should be, followed by "Passover", etc
In the center of the face, an odometer-like gauge reveals the year '5734
' At its base, the brilliant blue Judeum glows brightly
Santa barks out orders
(') Get moving
We've got work to do
One of the thugs pushes play on a ghetto blaster and the song 'Santa Claus Is Coming To Town' begins to play
few of the thugs insert a bicycle pump into the Judeum clock base and begin pumping
- The Hammer is moments away from the
compound
He spots the motorcycle ramp, and then guns his engine
He's close
- Inside, Santa and his thugs hear the sound of the Chopper growing in strength
The  of the engines is piercingly loud
And then nothing
beat passes, and then the Hammer's motorcycle busts open the front door
An  of the Hammer's bike skidding to a stop
As Santa goes for his gun, the Hammer interrupts him
Uh
Can you just give me one second
Santa is confused
Still on the bike, the Hammer uses his feet to backpeddle the motorcycle to the doorway
Looks of bewilderment from Santa and his gang
The Hammer reaches the doorway and kisses his hand
John Wooish - shot as the Hammer touches his hand to the mezuzah nailed to the doorframe
The Hammer jumps off the bike, and we get the requisite push in on him as he pulls out two Uzi's from under his jacket
(') Let's dance the hora
Santa draws a pistol, and with a single shot from his Uzi, the Hammer blows it out of his hand
It lands on the other side of the room
Santa looks up from his empty hand
Get him boys
Santa's Elf Thugs open a  filled with  - The chest is labeled "
" With great difficulty, they struggle to pull the heavy machinery out of the box
The Hammer, mildly amused, watches them
The Hammer blasts away, and the elves scramble for safety
The sound of gunfire is deafening and constant
An Elf sneaks quietly towards Santa's gun
Esther walks in through the front door and spots something that gives her cause for concern
Unbeknownst to the Hammer, the   picks up Santa's gun
He raises it at the Hammer, ready to fire
Mordechai
Behind you
The Hammer turns and nails the elf just in time
Esther, gun drawn, backs up into frame with the Hammer, and the two fire off rounds
What are you doing here
Mordechai,  love you
couldn't let you do this alone
love you too
'm sorry about freaking out yesterday
was wrong
forgive you
Go check on the clock
'll finish up here
We do another   into the Hammer as he turns towards Tiny Tim
Tiny Tim, standing alone with his crutches tucked under his arms, looks like a deer caught in headlights
The Hammer grins mischievously
Uh oh
The Hammer begins firing
In -, Tiny Tim hobbles as fast as he can towards an overturned table, gunfire trailing him
Like a pole vaulter with two poles, Tiny Tim plants his crutches firmly into the ground and launches himself over the table
He lands directly on top of Santa, who cowers underneath the table
Get off of me you cripple
What are we gonna do
He's got us on the ropes
We   with the Hammer as he approaches the camera, firing rounds at the table
We cut to the duct taped Hasidic Guards tied to their chairs
One of them frantically nudges the other and motions to the window
Fear fills both of their eyes
We see what they see
Through the window, the  is quickly setting behind the mountains
We cut back to the Hammer
The speed with which he shoots begins to slow
Esther, checking the clock for damage calls to him
What's the matter
don't know
'm feeling kind of tired
We cut back to Santa and Tiny Tim underneath the table
We the shooting continue to slow, until finally it ceases altogether
Santa and Tiny Tim exchange looks
What's going on
Why'd he stop
Maybe he ran out of ammo
Take a look
Tiny Tim pokes his head over the table to see
The Hammer and Esther lie together slumped up against the wall
They look exhausted
Tiny Tim drops back below the table
Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend
Resting
He thinks for a second
An idea forms
(') What day is it
It's Friday
What time is it
don't know
About sundown  guess
Santa makes the connection
Why didn't  think of this
It's the Sabbath
blank look from Tiny Tim
(') The day of rest
He can't fight on the Sabbath
'mon, get up
We've got him beat
The Hammer's  as Santa and his thugs approach him cautiously
(') Well, well, well
It looks as if the Hebrew Hammer's got a weakness after all
Santa turns to his thugs
(') Finish extracting the Judeum from the clock
(To Tiny Tim) Tiny Tim,  want you to introduce the Hebrew Hammer to the Christmas spirit
Another blank look from Tiny Tim
You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking
No dipshit,  want you to kill him
He thinks about it
Oh
Santa's gonna take the sled back to the North Pole and celebrate his victory with his new stocking stuffer
Santa grabs Esther and attempts to pull her up
The Hammer holds on tightly to her other hand, but isn't strong enough to resist Santa's might
Esther's hand is pulled from his firm grip, and Santa takes her into his arms
Esther
Mordechai
Santa forces her out the front door, leaving Tiny Tim alone with the Hammer
, we hear the sound of Santa's Sled taking off
Take a look Hammer
The clock's already beginning to power down
We see a shot of the elves pumping out the Judeum from the clock, and then tilt up to reveal its face
The dial slowly spins past 'Yom Kippur', 'Passover', 'Hanukkah,' 'Purim', and then finally the 'Macy's 50% Off Spring Sale
' Tiny Tim raises his gun point blank at the Hammer
(') Ah
What's the matter
No more snappy one liners
It seems all is lost when
We hear the sounds of a whole lot of  being
Tiny Tim turns around to see the with their guns raised at him
Jamal, standing next to Mohammed, flashes Tiny Tim a smile
Merry Kwanzaa nigga
: -   - The Hammer and Mohammed enter through the vault doors
The Chief waits anxiously
Mordechai, you're back
The clock
Still ticking
Thanks to the help from the Brothers at the , Hanukkah's safe for now
That's wonderful
The Chief notices the Hammer's dejected look
(') So why the long face
It's Esther
Santa's got her
My Esther
Oh Mordechai
The Chief, overcome by sadness, slumps down into a chair
(') Please
Will you help me
love her sir
If  don't help you, won't be able to make her my wife
Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission
Mo, standing in the , gives the Chief the fist/chest salute
Asalam Alekem
(To Mo) You're a mench
Thank you
(To Hammer) Mordechai, by any means necessary, you bring my Esther back to me
Even if it requires using Judaism's most powerful weapon
Oh no, not the
The Chief shakes his head yes
(') There won't be any need for that sir
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands
know sir
won't let you down
The Hammer motions to Mo, and the two begin to leave
They pass by Sammy Davis Jr
Jr
The Hammer acknowledges him
(') Sammy Davis Jr
Jr
You two cats are beautiful
love you guys
You take care babe
Mo whispers into the Hammer's ear
What's wrong with him
He's still working out some identity issues
: - The Hammer and Mo crawl onto the snow covered bluff overlooking Santa's Workshop
With his binoculars, the Hammer scopes out the compound below
- Instead of your standard two circles filling the screen, we see the world through a pair of Star Of Davids
The place resembles the exterior of an industrial warehouse, with two Elves on guard with guns
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet
wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop
We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years
The Hammer puts the binoculars down
This is the year 5734
It's time the boys at the  got into the 58th century
Let me show you something
The Hammer pulls out a
(') The  supplies all its agents with this state of the art device called a laptop computator
Cool
What's it do
Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me
Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet,  can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter
The Hammer makes a few keystrokes and turns the screen towards Mo
Man, that's far out
Hey, the Jets won
But wait, there's more
With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse,  can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail
Mo's interest is seriously peaked
Porno
You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing
Oh yeah
Take a look
The Hammer does some computing
(') For example, here's a picture of your sister Tawanda getting freaky with a German Shepard
Mo's eyes widen
Gettin' freaky with a what
He grabs the laptop from the Hammer and looks at the screen
picture of  making out with a  man decked out in lederhosen on a rural German hillside
The two are surrounded by sheep
Mo gives a sigh of relief
(') Oy vey, that's almost as bad
That's Tawanda getting freaky with a notorious white supremacist
Mo goes for the keyboard
(') Where's the white out button on this thing
We get a  of the   as Mo presses it purrs
Message sent
What just happened
Remember that bit about the cyber postal route
Yeah
The Hammer looks at the blissfully ignorant Mo with empathy
Nah, forget about it
'   - Santa sits at the head of his conference table
Tawni and Bambi sit on his lap
cigarette dangles from his mouth, and he holds a giant glass of eggnog in his hand
Rudolph stands in the corner of the room
Rudolph, more egg nog
Rudolph, equipped with a tray around his neck holding a glass of egg nog, walks over
Santa stares at him antagonistically as he takes the glass off of the tray and takes a sip
Santa puts his cigarette back into his mouth, takes a drag and blows smoke past camera
huge cloud of smoke blows over Rudolph's face
Santa smiles at his women as we hear Rudolph cough
(') Ho, ho, ho
Suddenly, the two women are pushed from his lap as a rises up between his legs from underneath the table
Listen motherfucker,  already told you
don't care how much yo ass is payin' me, if you call me that one more time there ain't gonna be no more visits down to the South Pole
You feelin' me
His ego deflates a bit
Yes maam, loud and clear
Tiny Tim enters the room
He has a black eye and his clothing is torn
Damn sugar, what happened to you
Santa,  got some really bad news
- The Hammer wears Tefilon, consisting of leather straps with boxes, wrapped around his head and arms
He silently bows his head in front of the gigantic wall as he mumbles something to himself
Mo nervously scans the area for guards
What are you doing
Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall
The Hammer unwraps his leather straps, and then tosses them high over the wall
The boxes on the straps catch on a pipe
The line is pulled taut, and the boxes hold secure against the pipe
The Hammer and Mo begin to scale the wall a la the 60's Batman and Robin television show
The Hammer leads the way while Mo, directly behind him, has his arms wrapped tightly around his waist
The Hammer stops climbing for a second, and turns to him
(') You know, you don't have to hold on to my waist
You're tied in
Mo releases his arms from the Hammer's waist
Indeed, he is tied in
knew that
'    -   - The Hammer and Mo drop from the wall onto the ground
The Hammer looks around
No guards in sight
In front of them is door clearly marked "
" Well, that was easy
Mo heads for the door
The Hammer calls to him
Wait
Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the 2000 stereo type alarm system
stereo type alarm system
Take a look
The Hammer points to above the door
Sure enough, there sit How do we bypass it
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-
tendencies inside the building
For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg
that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o
within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound
This pisses Mo off
Listen cat, 'll have you know that hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player
Well that's good news for us
It means the system is outdated
This should be easy
'mon
The two enter through the door
'   - The Hammer shuts the door behind them
So far, so good
Suddenly, the two hear the sound of footsteps coming down the hall
They duck into a corner
The sound of the footsteps passes
The Hammer makes the silent military "eyes" gesture to Mo by pointing two fingers at his eyes, indicating for him to check and see if the coast is clear
Mo bends out from the corner to look
Pennies fall from his pockets
It's all clear
Let's go
The Hammer bends down to pick up the change
Mo,  think you dropped some
Mo's eyes widen in terror
Hammer, no
The Hammer picks up the pennies, and the ear splitting alarm system is triggered
Red Lights flash, and over the loudspeakers we hear
Jewdar alert
Jewdar alert
Mo and The Hammer start running down the hallway
Doors line the corridor
The Hammer kicks open one of the doors, and enters as it shuts behind him
The camera stays in the hallway with Mo, who looks around nervously
From inside the room, we can hear The Hammer exits the room
Let's go
The two continue on down the hall
The Hammer spots another door, violently kicks it open, and enters
Again, the door shuts behind him followed by the sound of more The Hammer exits
(') 'mon, let's go
Mo stops and looks at him
What are you doing
Offscreen gunfire
That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget
Mo shakes his head in understanding, and the two run on, making a hard right out of frame at the corridor's end beat passes, and then we hear
: Mo and the Hammer run into frame
Mo points to the other end of the hall
There's Tiny Tim
Tiny Tim spots them and begins to hobble furiously away in the other direction
(') 'll take Tiny Tim
You go find your woman
Mo runs down the hallway after Tiny Tim
The Hammer turns towards the other direction to find
on multi-colored  comin' right for him
The Hammer stands motionless as the Elves gain ground
Right before they reach him, the Hammer quickly pulls his Talis off of his neck and holds it outstretched, clotheslining the two off of their mopeds
The elves are out cold
The Hammer admires his work
Santa, running for his life, rounds the corner
He stops dead in his tracks as he spots the Hammer
The two look at one another for a brief moment, and then Santa points at something behind the Hammer
Hey, what's that over there
Is that a bowl of Matzah Ball soup
The Hammer looks behind him
Nothing
He turns back to find Santa long gone
Damn
He takes off down the hall after Santa
: Mo catches up to the hobbling Tiny Tim, and begins to mock the manner and speed at which he runs, running side by side with him, circling around him as he attempts to get away, etc
Realizing that it'd be impossible to outrun him, Tiny Tim comes to a stop
Mo trains his pistol on him
Now 'm gonna do to you what  should have done earlier

Feeling confident that the door is secure, he turns around to find the Hammer standing in front of him
The Hammer grabs Santa by his shirt
Where's my girlfriend Santa

You're gonna have to kill me before tell you
The Hammer's confused
But if  kill you, then you'll be dead
Santa thinks about this for a couple seconds
Good point
The Hammer looks up from his interrogation and spots a sign taped to a door directly behind Santa
It reads, " '

Don't worry your pretty little head

Looks like the tables have turned once again Hammer
More screaming from Esther behind the door

So sad
So long Mordechai
Give my father my regards
Santa readies to fire
Wait

The Hammer closes his eyes and puts his hands together as if in meditation
Santa looks around nervously
What are you doing
The Hammer meditates for a bit more
Suddenly, his eyes open and he begins

And my feet
What kind of flooring is this anyway
My arches are killing me
It's beginning to work on Santa
No

Mo begins to take Santa away
The Hammer turns around
(') No, wait

(To Santa) just wanna say one thing
You know where you messed up Santa
You underestimated the true meaning of Hanukkah
Santa's a broken man
He gets on his knees and inquires earnestly
Please tell me
What is the true meaning of Hanukkah
The Hammer thinks about this for a second
He's drawing a blank
He looks to Esther, and she shrugs back at him
That's

He looks to the Hammer
The Hammer shrugs his shoulders
(') Oh Mordechai, you know how  detest gore

'mon, let's get you back to Washington
And we  out as the three make their way down the hallway
:
'  - Mrs
Carver exits the kitchen, platters of food in hand
Shabat Shalom everybody
We see Esther and the Hammer at the other end of the table
They smile and hold hands
Domestic bliss

And a Merry Christmas to all of our Gentile friends

Thanks mom
Mrs
Carver begins to cut her meat
But with all the attention the newspapers and television have given you, you'd think that you were the pope or something
(Proudly) Well,  did save Hanukkah mom
My children, and my children's children, and my children's children's children
He gets himself back on track
(') and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl
(Interrupting) So you saved Hanukkah Mr
Big Shot
mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays
Mordechai looks to Esther
She shrugs her shoulders in encouragement
(') Now, if you had saved Passover or Yom Kipur, then maybe you'd have what to brag about
Did  tell you that my friend Maureen's son, the Investment Banker, was responsible for a very big merger on
No, no, no, no, no

Mrs
Carver ignores her son as she continues to play with the cat

What's that Mazel Tov
Your tuchus needs some more airing out
Mrs
Carver removes the diaper
Esther and Hammer gag from the smell of it
Mun Chi, a forkful of food inches from his mouth, gets a whiff and then places the utensil down in angry frustration
Mom
We're eating
What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov
That's right
Mommy loves you
Such a good boy you are
This gets the Hammer going
Oh,  get it
To you, the cat pooping in his diaper is somehow better than my saving a Jewish holiday

'mon
The Hammer motions for everyone to get up and follow him to the window
We cut to the outside of the window looking in on the four as they try and get a better look outside
forgot to ask you, who'd they put in charge as the new Santa Claus
Since Santa will be living out the rest of his days at a home for the religionally insane and because he had no blood heirs, the Kwanzaa Liberation Front and the Jewish Defense League agreed to make the whole Santa Claus process a democratic vote
We're all very pleased with the first Santa elect
The Hammer spots something up in the sky, and points it out to the rest of them
(') Look, there he is now
The full moon shines brightly in the  of the night sky as we slowly  past Rudolph and the rest of the reindeer, eventually reaching the cockpit
Jamal holds the reigns and waves down at Mordechai and company
From the window, Mordechai, Esther, Mrs
