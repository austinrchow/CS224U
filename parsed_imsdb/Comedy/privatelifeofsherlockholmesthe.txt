by Billy Wilder and
Diamond : - Engraved on it are the words:  &
, Bankers
Reflected in its shiny surface are double-decker red buses, and other present-day London traffic
- An iron gate opens, and two bank guards come in
One of them switches on the lights
On the shelves which line the walls are dusty strong-boxes, document cases, wrapped packages, etc
The guards move along the shelves searching for something
' Somewhere in the vaults of a bank in London is a tin dispatch box with my name on it
It is not to be opened until fifty years after my death
The guards find a battered tin dispatch box with the name ,
, painted on it
They remove it from the shelf, set it down on a table
The box is tied with heavy cord, the knots sealed with wax
Strung on the cord is the key
' It contains certain mementos of my long association with a man who elevated the science of deduction to an art -- the world's first, and undoubtedly most famous, consulting detective
While one of the guards dusts the box off, the other cuts the cord with a pair of scissors
He then inserts the key in the lock, turns it, raises the lid -- revealing the dusty contents of the box
,
The guards now start to remove the objects from the box, one at a time: --  daguerreotype of Holmes, standing, and Watson, seated, in a a stiff studio pose; Holmes' deerstalker hat, his curved pipe, his magnifying glass; Watson's stethoscope, Holmes' revolver; a small enamel sign with the number 221B; a pair of handcuffs; 2
a sheet of music paper which is unrolled to disclose a violin piece composed by Holmes, titled   von
; pocket watch, the back of which is opened to reveal a photograph of Gabrielle Valladon; a signet ring bearing the initials
-- under which is concealed a compass; a worn morocco case -- inside which is an early-model hypodermic syringe; a crystal ball which, when shaken, produces a snowstorm - and when the snow settles, we see a bust of Queen Victoria
, The last item out of the box   is a thick stack of manuscript paper, bound with   green ribbon
The guard undoes the ribbon, dusts off   the top page, as Written in   ink, in the cursive penmanship of the period, is   the following paragraph: To my heirs: In my lifetime,  have recorded some sixty cases demonstrating the singular gift of my friend Sherlock Holmes -- dealing with everything from The Hound of the Baskervilles to his mysterious brother Mycroft and the devilish Professor Moriarty
But there were other adventures which, for reasons of discretion,  have decided to withhold from the public until this much later date
They involve matters of a delicate and sometimes scandalous nature, as will shortly become apparent
,
, reading the text
: - passenger train of the late Nineteenth Century is chugging through the early morning mist
' It was August of 1887, and we were returning from Yorkshire, where Holmes had solved the baffling murder of Colonel Abernetty
3
-   - There are but two passengers in the compartment -- sitting by the window, facing each other
In fact they are dozing
One wears a deerstalker and an Inverness cape; the other is in a dark overcoat and a black bowler, a furled umbrella between his legs, a medical bag on the seat beside him
The rest of their luggage is on the racks above
They are, of course,   and This being 1887, they are thirty- three and thirty-five respectively
' You may recall that he broke the murderer's alibi by measuring the depth to which the parsley had sunk in the butter on a hot day
: - hansom cab, with Holmes' and Watson's luggage strapped to the rack on top, is proceeding down the busy street
' He was the most brilliant man  have ever known -- and  dare say people have envied me for sharing that flat with him in Baker Street
The cab draws up   in front of 221B
The front door opens and
,   a plump, motherly woman in her fifties, wearing an apron,   hurries down the steps
She greets Holmes and Watson   warmly as they alight
' 'll grant you he was stimulating -- but he could also be moody, unpredictable, egocentric, and more often than not, completely infuriating -- as our landlady, Mrs
Hudson, can attest -- bless her kind soul
The cabbie   starts to unload their luggage
As Holmes, Watson and   Mrs
Hudson proceed inside, , past the number 221B, to the bay window   on the second floor
4
- 221B   - It's all there -- the fireplace, the coal scuttle, the Persian slipper with the tobacco; the velvet wing chair, the basket chair with the writing-arm, the couch with the cushions; the sideboard with the tantalus and the gasogene; the acid-stained deal-topped table with Holmes' chemical equipment on it, the dining table, the small Moorish table; the bookshelves and the violin case; the gas fixtures and the oil lamps; the dumbwaiter connecting with the kitchen in the basement; and Holmes' desk, piled high with papers, clippings, research material, etc
Holmes is pulling up the window shades
Watson has removed his hat and coat, and is putting his medical bag down on the sideboard; the cabbie, having deposited their luggage, is just leaving
do wish you'd give me a little more warning when you come home unexpected would have roasted a goose -- and had some flowers for you
My dear Mrs
Hudson -- criminals are as unpredictable as head-colds
You never quite know when you're going to catch one
He has picked up a dagger, starts opening his mail, which is on the dining table
'll unpack your bags
She exits into one of the bedrooms
Watson has now taken a magazine out of an envelope
Here's an advance copy of Strand Magazine
(shows it to Holmes) They've printed 'The Red-Headed League
' On the cover is a colored illustration from the story, featuring in obligatory Inverness and deerstalker
5
(offhand) Very impressive
(leafing through the magazine) Would you like to see how  treated it
can hardly wait
'm sure 'll find out all sorts of fascinating things about the case that  never knew before
Just what do you mean by that
Oh, come now, Watson, you must admit that you have a tendency to over-romanticize
You have taken my simple exercises in logic and embellished them, exaggerated them
deny the accusation
You have described me as six-foot-four, whereas  am barely six-foot-one
bit of poetic license
(removing Inverness and deerstalker) You have saddled me with this improbable costume, which the public now expects me to wear
That's not my doing
(indicating cover of Strand) Blame it on the illustrator
You've made me out to be a violin virtuoso
Here -- 6
(holds out a letter he's been reading) -- a request from the Liverpool Symphony to appear as soloist in the Mendelssohn Concerto
(excited) Oh, really
The fact is that  could barely hold my own in the pit orchestra of a second-rate music hall
You're much too modest
(busy with the mail) You have given the reader the distinct impression that  am a misogynist
Actually,  don't dislike women -- merely distrust them
The twinkle in the eye and the arsenic in the soup
It's those little touches that make you colorful -- Lurid is more like it
You have painted me as a hopeless dope addict -- just because  occasionally take a five per cent solution of cocaine
seven per cent solution
Five per cent
Don't you think 'm aware you've been diluting it behind my back
As a doctor -- and as your friend -- strongly disapprove of this insidious habit of yours
7
My dear friend -- as well as my dear doctor --  only resort to narcotics when am suffering from acute boredom -- when there are no interesting cases to engage my mind
(holding out one of the open letters) Look at this -- an urgent appeal to find six missing midgets
He tosses the letter down is disgust
Did you say midgets
He picks up the letter
Six of them -- the Tumbling Piccolos -- an acrobatic act with some circus
Disappeared between London and Bristol Don't you find that intriguing
Extremely so
You see, they are not only midgets -- but also anarchists
Anarchists
(nodding) By now they have been smuggled to Vienna, dressed as little girls in burgundy pinafores
They are to greet the Czar of all the Russias when he arrives at the railway station
They will be carrying bouquets of flowers, concealed in each bouquet will be a bomb with a lit fuse
You really think so
Not at all
The circus owner offers me five pounds for my services -- that's not even a pound a midget
8
So obviously he is a stingy blighter, and the little chaps simply ran off to join another circus
(crestfallen) Oh
And it sounded so promising -- There are no great crimes anymore, Watson
The criminal class has lost all enterprise and originality
At best they commit some bungling villainy, with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see through it
He has crossed to the desk, suddenly notices something
(angrily) Mrs
Hudson
(even angrier) Mrs
Hudson comes hurrying out of the bedroom
Yes
What is it
What have  done now
(sternly) There is something missing from my desk
Missing
Something very crucial
(picks up a small feather) You have been tidying up against my explicit orders
Oh,  made sure not to disturb anything
Dust, Mrs
Hudson, is an essential part of my filing system
By the thickness of it,  can date any document immediately
9
Some of the dust was this thick
She demonstrates with her thumb and forefinger
(promptly) That would be March, 1883
He blows the feather away
: - on Holmes' foot, operating a bellows to the top of the chemistry table, on which an elaborate apparatus of brass, glass and rubber tubing has been set up
Inserted into the ends of the rubber tubes are half a dozen cigarettes, four cigars of different shapes and colors, and four pipes, all lit
Activated by the bellows, they are puffing away like mad, wheezing loudly and filling the screen with smoke
Seated at the table is Holmes, in shirt-sleeves
Occasionally he knocks off an ash onto a glass slide, studies it under a microscope
Watson, in a dressing gown, is sitting in the chair with the writing arm, documenting the latest Holmes adventure for Strand Magazine
The open mail has now been affixed to the center of the wooden mantelpiece, with a dagger
Mrs
Hudson is clearing the dinner dishes from the table, and loading them onto the shelf of the dumbwaiter
The accumulation of smoke in the room makes her cough
How can you stand this
Why don't you let me air the room out
Please, Mrs
Hudson -- he's working on a definitive study of tobacco ash
(drily) 'm sure there's a crying need for that
10
In our endeavors, it is sometimes vital to distinguish between, say, the ashes of a Macedonian cigarette and a Jamaican cigar
Sor far he has classified 140 different kinds of ashes
All of which will end up on my rug
She is now pulling on the rope which lowers the dumbwaiter
That'll be enough, Mrs
Hudson
(heading for door) All right
If you gentlemen want to stay here and suffocate
She exits, shutting the door
For a while, the two go on working
Then Holmes rises abruptly from the chemistry table
She's right
am suffocating
Let me open a window
Not from lack of air -- from lack of activity
Sitting here week after week -- blowing smoke rings -- staring through a microscope -- there's no challenge in that
Personally,  consider it a major contribution to scientific criminology
Holmes has opened his violin case and taken out his fiddle
How  envy you your mind, Watson
You do
11
It's placid, imperturbable, prosaic
But my mind rebels against stagnation
It's like a racing engine, tearing itself to pieces because it's not connected up with the work for which it was built
He has tucked the violin under his chin, starts to improvise a nervous pent-up melody
There is nothing amateurish about it -- he plays quite well
Watson resumes working on his manuscript
Suddenly the music stops
Watson looks up apprehensively
Holmes has put down the violin, and is crossing to the sideboard
He opens Watson's medical bag, takes out a bottle of cocaine, starts toward his bedroom
Watson pushes the writing arm to the side, rises from his chair
Holmes -- Holmes   pays no   attention, continues into the bedroom
Watson   crosses   to the open door
Inside the bedroom, Holmes   has put   down the cocaine bottle on the washstand, and is   rolling   up his left sleeve
Holmes, where is your self-control
Fair question
From a drawer he takes a morocco case, opens it, removes a hypodermic syringe
Aren't you ashamed of yourself
Thoroughly
But this will take care of it
He has removed the stopper from the cocaine bottle, and inserting the hypodermic needle into it, starts to draw up the liquid
: 12
- It is raining
bus comes down the street, the open top deck sprouting umbrellas like black mushrooms
' Naturally,  don't mean to imply that my friend was always on cocaine -- sometimes it was opium, sometimes it was hashish
And once he went one of these dreadful binges, there was no telling how long it would last
- 221B   - Rain beats on the windows
Holmes and Watson are in the middle of an argument
The only reason you moved in with me is to have a steady supply of stimulants
Now, now, Watson -- you mustn't underestimate your other charms
He starts into the bedroom
Holmes,  warn you
If you lock yourself in there once more -- intend to do nothing of the sort
He takes the hypodermic out of the drawer in the washstand, starts back into the living room with it
Not until you replace this needle
It is getting rather blunt
As Watson glares at him, the door opens and Mrs
Hudson comes bustling in
Holmes hides the hypodermic behind his back
made you some tea and cress sandwiches
13
She opens the door of the dumbwaiter, starts to pull it up
Mrs
Hudson,  want you to pack my bags
Are you going away for the weekend
And beyond
'm moving out
Moving out
(she looks at Holmes) 'm just as surprised as you are
You heard me, Mrs
Hudson
And let's not waste any time
Mrs
Hudson sighs, exits into Watson's bedroom
May  be so bold as to ask where you'er going
don't know yet
But  intend to resume my practice
am, after all, a doctor
And quite a competent one, if  say so as shouldn't
You'll find it very dull -- snipping out tonsils and flushing out kidneys -- Watson is glancing around the room, searching for something
If you're looking for your medical bag, you hid it under the Moorish table
(as Watson crosses to it) Which shows a little more imagination than last time -- when it was under your bed
14
Watson picks up the Moorish table, disclosing the medical bag, standing on end
He sets the bag down on the fender, opens it
will, of course, continue to pay my half of the rent until you find someone to share these rooms with you
Where am  going to find anyone who will put up with my rather eccentric habits
(taking hypodermic needle out of bag) Here's a fresh needle -- and here's my farewell present to you
He takes out three bottles of narcotics, puts them on the mantel
If you want to destroy yourself, go right ahead
But  won't sit by and watch you doing it
He snaps his bag shut, carries it toward his bedroom
Watson
Watson disappears into the bedroom, slamming the door
Holmes looks after him, then looks at the bottles of dope on the mantelpiece
He starts pacing
After a moment he stops at the chemistry table, studies the assorted glassware on the shelves above
'  - There are two open valises on the bed
Watson is moving around the room, collecting various odds and ends, while Mrs
Hudson packs his clothes
It's so sad
You and Mr
Holmes -- after all these years -- (she sobs) 15
Please, Mrs
Hudson -- none of that
Mrs
Hudson takes a clean handkerchief from the open valise, blows her nose
'll wash this and send it on to you
'll be at Brown's Hotel
(still sniffling) know how it feels --  once went through a divorce myself
(removing diploma from wall) Actually, 'm rather looking forward to it
Leading a normal life again
Regular office hours -- nine to three -- and if occasionally there's an emergency call in the middle of the night,  know it's going be appendicitis and not an ax murder
Let Holmes go mucking about in the fog and the sleet, looking for a bloodstained collar-button out on the moors, with some demented hound snapping at his behind -- From the living room comes the sound of a revolver shot
Mrs
Hudson screams and Watson looks off in alarm
Then he races out of the room, diploma in hand, followed by Mrs
Hudson
- As they burst into the room, they see Holmes sitting on the stool beside the chemistry table, a revolver in his hand
He has shattered one of the narcotics bottles on the mantelpiece, and is aiming at a second one
Mr
Holmes
Holmes fires, smashing the second bottle
As Mrs
Hudson takes a step forward, he waves her away with the gun
16
Please, Mrs
Hudson
You're in my line of fire
Watson jerks Mrs
Hudson back as Holmes lets go with another shot
The    bullet disposes of the third bottle, splattering glass   and liquid all over the place
Holmes rises calmly from   the stool, crosses to the desk, puts the revolver away   in a drawer
(outraged) How many times have  told you  will not tolerate pistol practice on my premises
should have evicted you when you shot them holes in my wall
She points up to a spot near the ceiling
Neatly traced in bullet holes are the initials
, with a small crown above them
Merely celebrating Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee
Look at that mess you made -- Watson is looking at Holmes with a little smile on his face
It's all right, Mrs
Hudson
'll clean it up -- (hands her the diploma) -- while you unpack my things
Unpack
You heard him
bewildered Mrs
Hudson goes back into the bedroom
Watson crosses to the fireplace, picks up the whiskbroom and the coal shovel, starts cleaning up the broken glass
Thank you, Holmes
know how difficult it must've been for you -- 17
Not really
It was simple choice between a bad habit and a good companion
You've made me very happy
've often been accused of being cold and unemotional
admit to it
And yet, in my cold, unemotional way, 'm very fond of you, Watson
know that
But one likes to hear these things occasionally
He notices the violin, which has been splattered with the liquid from the shattered bottle, picks it up
Look at this
Covered with that nasty stuff
'd better dry it off
'll do it
He takes the instrument, and dabbing it with a handkerchief, carries it toward the violin case
For a moment,  was worried that you were going to let me walk out -- that you weren't even going to try to stop me
Now, Watson -- you know there's nothing wouldn't do to keep you here
With a side-glance at the busy Watson, he opens the violin case
Neatly stashed away around the edges are the three original bottles of narcotics
The ones he shot up, of course, were substitutes from the chemistry set
He places the violin carefully among the bottles, closes the case, snaps the locks
As he moves off, we on the violin case
18
' It was not the first not the last time he tricked me like that
Normally,  was inclined to forgive him
: - Watson, in his dressing gown, is sitting at the table, finishing his coffee
In front of him is a letter, on blue note-paper, and a pair of theatre tickets
' But on one occasion, he did something that was so utterly unforgivable, that would gladly have murdered him -- had it not been for my saintly disposition
Watson sets down his coffee cup, picks up the letter and the tickets, rises from his chair
He starts to pace -- addressing Holmes, who is off-scene
Why are you being so stubborn, Holmes
Why won't you go
It's the final performance of the Imperial Russian Ballet -- the house has been sold out for months -- He moves towards the door of -- '  - Holmes is sitting in a hip-bath with a high back, soaping himself
Watson appears in the doorway
-- seats are going for a guinea apiece -- That's precisely it
Why should someone send up two free tickets
Anonymously, at that
Whoever sent them must be in great distress
The note says -- 19
(reading it) 'Please
You are the only man in the world who can help me
' suspect it's some sort of plot
You mean somebody wants to lure us into a trap
Somebody wants to kill me
Kill you
That's right
It's a plot to bore me to death
detest ballet
But this isn't just any ballet
It's Swan Lake
: - , in the orchestra pit,   as he gives the downbeat for the second acto music of
, with a   mechanical sway crossing the mist-shrouded lake ,  Holmes and Watson, in   evening clothes, occupying a box in the upper tier
(confidentially) You know, of course, Holmes -- that swan isn't really a swan -- it's an enchanted princess
(bored) 'mmmm
On the stage now, the hunters appear, carrying lighted torches
20
Watson trains his opera glasses on the stage, Holmes stifles a yawn
, as the Queen of the Swans, makes her entrance to loud applause
She is in her forties, but splendidly preserved, undoubtedly the greatest ballerina around
Watson nudges Holmes, who has dozed off
Fabulous woman, don't you think so, Holmes
(coming to) Who
The great Petrova
He hands the glasses to Holmes, who focuses them indifferently on the stage
Petrova is making an exit, backwards, on points
Holmes lowers the glasses, returns them to Watson
Very strong arches,  must admit
They say twelve men have died for her
Really
21
Six committed suicide, four were killed in duels, and one fell out of the gallery in the Vienna Opera House
That's only eleven
The man who fell from the gallery landed on top of another man in the orchestra
That makes an even dozen -- in a messy sort of way
Watson resumes watching the stage through the glasses
Petrova and the dancer playing the Prince go into the famous pas-de-deux
Watson enjoying himself immensely, Holmes sitting there dourly
The red plush curtain at the rear of the box parts, and a man in evening clothes and a top hat enters
He is in his middle fifties, extremely soigne, and somewhat sinister
His name is , and he is Russian
Holmes and Watson look around
Mister Holmes
Yes
am Nicolai Rogozhin, director-general of the Imperial Russian Ballet
So glad you accept invitation
Holmes and Watson start to get up, but he motions them back into their chairs
This is Dr
Watson
22
Pleased to meet you
(seating himself behind them) You are enjoying
Immensely
(abruptly) Tell me, Mr
Holmes, how is your health
My health
Better consult my doctor
(to Rogozhin) Oh, he's in excellent shape
(to Holmes) Any insanity in your family
Diabetes
Asthma
Would you mind telling me what this is all about
Certainly
Madame Petrova, she has problem
Could you be more specific
Certainly not
liason with a crowned head
Compromising letters
Blackmail
He glances toward the stage
The pas-de-deux finished, to a rousing ovation
23
Rogozhin rises, turns to Holmes
After performance, there will be little celebration backstage -- and Madame requests your presence
We'd be delighted
(to Watson) You are invited, also
With a parting look he exits, pulling the plush curtains closed
: The performance is over, the curtain is up, the party is on
Tables have been set up, with caviar, vodka and champagne
The members of the orchestra are now playing balalaikas, and crew and cast (the ballerinas still in costume, the male dancers in tights) seem in high spirits
Holmes and Watson, in silk hats with canes, appear from the wings, stop, survey the scene
Watson's eyes are shining with anticipation
In contrast, Holmes' face is sober and quizzical
Rogozhin spots the two, detaches himself from a group, hurries over to join them
There you are, Mr
Holmes
Madame is expecting you in her dressing room
Dr
Watson, you will amuse yourself meanwhile -- we have vodka, caviar, girls
No, thank you
24
No girls
No caviar
Makes me break out in hives
Rogozhin turns to a group of ballerinas, claps his hands
Dievushki
Siude, siuda, dievushki
Posnakomtes s docktorum Watsonom
Half a dozen ballerinas descend on on Dr
Watson
They are giggling and chattering in Russian
Rogozhin leads Holmes off, while Watson takes in the bevy of beauties around him
Any of you girls understand English
Nyet
Not one single word
Nyet
In that case,  don't mind telling you that you all have lovely po-pos
He pats a couple of the po-pos with his cane
Rogozhin is leading Holmes toward Madame Petrova's dressing room
Mr
Holmes,  must prepare you -- this is no ordinary case
It is only the extraordinary that interests me
25
Good
Because you will find this extra- extraordinary
They have now reached the door of Madame's dressing room
Rogozhin knocks
The door is opened by an elderly Russian maid
Madame Petrova prinimaet
Pozhaluista voidite
Rogozhin leads Holmes inside
The maid steps out, shuts the door
- It is small, elegant and sensuous
There is vodka in an ice-bucket, next to a Recamier chaise, a paravent, masses of flowers, and finally Madame Petrova, still in costume, sitting at a dressing table with multiple mirrors, undoing her hair
Candles, in two elaborate candleabra, give Madame's face a special glow
Ja priviol vam Mistera Sherlock Holmesa, doragaia
(to Holmes) Otchen rada
She extends her hand, and Holmes takes it
Madame
He kisses her hand
Petrova appraises him from head to toe, and back again
(to Holmes) Vi menshe rostom chem ja ozhidala
Madame says you are shorter than she thought
26
didn't mean to be
No eto nie vazhno
Menia interessujut glavnim obra som vashi mosghi
Short, tall, who cares
It is the brains that count
(to Rogozhin) Thank you
(catching himself, to Petrova) Thank you
Petrova rises, crosses to the paravent
Ja prochia vsie vashi prikliuchenia
Zamiechatelno
Os sobenno sobaka Baskervillei
Madame is great admirer of yours
She has read every story -- her favorite is Big Dog from Baskerville
'm afraid it loses something in translation
Petrova is now behind the paravent, undressing, only her head visible
Nikolai, pokazhite iemu skripku
Rogozhin picks up a violin case, opens it
Mr
Holmes, you know about fiddles
(takes violin out, hands it to him) What is your opinion of this
Holmes holds the violin up, peers through one of the sound holes
27
(reading) 'Antonius Stradivarius Cremonesis, Anno 1709
' Well, the label is authentic
(examines violin, plucks strings) Judging from the shape, the color of the varnish, and the tone,  would say it is a genuine Stradivarius of the best period
You like
It's magnificent
(from behind paravent) Skazhite jemu chto eto podarok ot menia
Here -- take it
Madame says it is yours
Mine
For services you will render
My fees as a detective are not exactly trifling -- but a Stradivarius -- you're not serious
am not
But Madame is
Petrova emerges from behind the paravent, in a brocade dressing gown
Nalejte vodki i obiasnite jemu v chom dielo
She drapes herself on the chaise
28
All right
will pour vodka and explain
(starts pouring vodka; it is pink) Mr
Holmes, what you have seen tonight is last and positively final performance of Madame Petrova
She is retiring
What a shame
She has been dancing since she was three years old
And after all, she is now thirty-eight
(gallantly) must say she doesn't look thirty-eight
That is because she is   forty-nine
(he hands her a   glass of vodka, with an   exaggerated smile) So Madame has decided   to leave ballet and spend life bringing up   her child
How admirable
(hands him vodka) Problem now is to find father
Oh
Is he missing
Correct
And that's why you called me in
Also correct
We must have father, because without father, how can there be child
29
see
The whole thing is still in the planning stage -- Correct again
Madame would like child to be brilliant and beautiful
Since she is beautiful -- she now needs man who is brilliant
Holmes' eyes wander slowly toward Petrova
She raises her glass
Za zdorovie
(raising his glass) Za zdorovie
Za zdrovie
Petrova and Rogozhin down their vodka bottoms up
Holmes takes one swallow, then stops
What's in it
What does it taste like
Red pepper
That's what's in it
While Rogozhin refills Petrova's glass and his own, Holmes takes another tentative sip
(to Holmes) Kogda mi smozhem dvinutsa v putj
beg your pardon
30
Madame wants to know how soon you can be ready
Ready
To leave for Venice
All arrangements have been made
You will spend one week there with Madame
Well, this is all very flattering
But surely there are other me -- better men -- To tell you truth, you were not first choice
We considered Russian writer, Tolstoi -- That's more like it
The man's a genius
Too old
Then we considered the philosopher, Nietzsche -- Absolutely first-rate mind
Too German
And we considered Tschaikowski -- Oh, you couldn't go wrong with Tschaikowski -- We could -- and we did
It was catastrophe
Why
You don't know
Because Tschaikowski -- how shall put it
Women not his glass of tea
31
Pity, that
(to Rogozhin) Skazhite jemu chto je otchen dovolna etim resheniem
Madame is very happy with final choice
Madame mustn't be too hasty
She must remember 'm an Englishman
So
You know what they say about us
If there's one thing more deplorable than our cooking, it's our love-making
We are not exactly the most romantic of people -- Perfect
We don't want sentimental idiots -- falling in love, committing suicide
One week in Venice -- she goes back to St
Petersburg with baby -- you go back to London with fiddle
An equitable arrangement
(puts down violin) About my medical history -- when you asked me --  neglected to mention a small detail
There is hemophilia in my family
We're all bleeders
(to Petrova) On govorit, chto v jevo semie stradajut ghemofilijei
Pust nie bezpokoitsa
Ja ostrighu sebe noghti
32
Madame says not to worry
She will not scratch you
That's reassuring to know
But -- (to Rogozhin) Pochemu on kolebletsa
On nie nahodit menia dostatochno privlekatelnoi
Madame says you talk too much
You find her attractive or no
Before Holmes can answer, the door opens and Watson sticks his head in
He is flushed and slightly inebriated, and there is a flower tucked behind his ear
From off comes the  of wild balalaika music
Excuse me
(to Rogozhin) What does prokanzik mean
It means 'You little devil
' It does
am
Thank you
He hurries off, shutting the door
(to Holmes) repeat question
You find Madame attractive or no
Holmes is still looking at the door where Watson exited, an idea forming in his mind
(turning to Rogozhin) Oh,  find her most attractive -- for a woman, that is
Then no problem
33
Maybe a slight one
You see,  am not a free man
Not free
You are a bachelor
bachelor -- living with another bachelor -- for the last five years
Five very happy years
What is it you are trying to tell me
hoped  could avoid the subject
But some of us -- through a cruel caprice of Mother Nature -- Get to point
The point is that Tschaikowski is not an isolated case
You mean, you and Dr
Watson --
(Holmes nods) He is your glass of tea
If you want to be picturesque about it
(slightly agitated) Chto on govorit
Pri chom tut Chaikovsky
On pederast
(on her feet now; flaring) Jescho odin
Eto stanovitsa odnoobrasno
Kakoi vi idiot
34
(picking up his silk hat and cane) Believe me, Madame, the loss is all mine
But  would prefer to disappoint you know than disappoint you in a gondola in Venice
He takes her limp hand, kisses it
Then he crosses to the door
(imitating Rogozhin's accent) It would have been catastrophe
He exits
Rogozhin starts to pour himself another glass of vodka
Petrova slaps the glass out of his hand
(screaming) Potchemu vi nie vijasnili eto eto ranshe, prezhde chem posoritj menia
The party has built into a real wingding by now
It's wild -- drinking, laughing, singing
Everybody is turned on -- especially Watson
He is dancing with a dozen of the ballerinas to madly accelerating balalaika music
Flower behind ear, hair mussed, tie undone, short of breath -- he is in paradise
Holmes makes his way through the revelers, approaches Watson
Watson
(Watson pays no attention) Watson, are you coming
(without missing a step) What is it, old boy
We're going home
35
Home
Not a chance
Not the slightest -- not the remotest chance
Toodle-ooo
He waves goodbye, and goes on swirling dizzily with the girls
Holmes puts on his silk hat and leaves
shaken Rogozhin comes up to the buffet, pours himself a stiff drink of vodka
As he drinks his eyes follow the dancing Watson balefully
Watson spins off several of the girls, grabs another group
His ex-partners wind up close to Rogozhin
He whispers something to them
Their eyes widen, and they stare at Watson with disbelief
Watson again switches partners, and the first girls now whisper intensely to those who just left the floor
The same reaction
Watson, oblivious to all this, is whirling around with another set of girls
By now some of the girls who are in on the secret are whispering to the male dancers in tights
Their reaction is slightly different
They are seeing Watson in a new light
And before Watson knows what's happening, he has been abandoned by all the girls, and is joined first by one pair then another pair of male dancers, till he is dancing only with gay guys in tights
It gradually dawns on Watson that there is something wrong with this state of affairs
After some difficulty, he breaks away from them
Hold on
Just a moment
Spotting Rogozhin, he crosses to him
The girls shrink away at his approach
(bewildered) What's going on
What happened to the girls
Why
Do you not prefer it this way
What way
36
You don't have to pretend
Mr
Holmes told us everything -- about you and him -- About me and him
Come now, no need to be bashful
We are not bourgeois
Maybe with doctors and detectives is unusual -- but in ballet, is very usual
What is
Caprice of Mother Nature
Look at Pavel and Mischa and Boris and Dmitri -- Watson looks around at the boys in tights, who are standing in a half-circle, grinning at him insolently
It is beginning to dawn on him
He pales
-- And Ilya and Sergei -- (breaks off, rocks his hand back and forth) Sergei -- half and half
He pours himself another vodka
Watson grabs the glass away from him, downs it with a gulp
: - 221B   - In contrast to the frenetic ambiance of the back-stage party, the room seems doubly placid
Holmes, his dinner coat replaced by a smoking jacket, is sitting in the wing chair, having a quiet pipe after the evening's peculiar adventure
Only the desk lamp is lit
From the street, there is the sound of hurried, angry footsteps approaching the house
Holmes turns his head languidly -- he knows who is coming
37
- An enraged Watson, cane and opera glasses in hand, and the flower still behind his ear, is jogging down the center of the deserted street
- Holmes rises casually, twists the wing chair so that its back is to the door, crosses to the lamp on the desk, turns the wick down
From off comes the sound of Watson's key rattling in the front door lock
- 221B   - The front door opens and Watson storms into the vestibule
Holmes
He races up the stairs and across the landing, flings open the door of the flat
Holmes
- Watson, grim and breathless, stands in the open doorway
Over the back of the wing chair, he sees smoke curling up from Holmes' pipe
There you are, you wretch
You rotter
You blackguard
Of all the vile, unspeakable fabrications
What do you have to say for yourself
No answer from Holmes
We now see -- but Watson does not -- that the chair is occupied by a section of Holmes' smoking machine, with the pipe attached
Don't just sit there -- speak up, man
38
Still no answer -- just a little pipe smoke drifting up from the wing chair
Incensed, Watson raises the opera glasses, tosses them toward the chair
There is a loud thud, the pipe falls to the floor, then there is silence
Watson suddenly becomes concerned
Holmes
Are you all right, Holmes
He approaches the chair apprehensively, shoves  it aside -- and there on the floor is the smoking machine,  still wheezing slightly
Watson picks it up, and his   eyes travel to Holmes, standing in a shadowy corner,  working the bellows with his foot
From the sound of your footsteps, gathered that you were not in a particularly amiable mood
(with renewed fury) How could you do a dastardly thing like that to me
What the deuce were you thinking of
He dashes the smoking machine to the floor
Watson, you  have my most abject apologies
But have you ever been cornered by  a madwoman
It seemed like the only way  to get out of it without hurting her  feelings
What about my feelings
And my reputation
Do you realize the gravity of what you have done
The possible repercussions
So there'll be a little gossip about you in St
Petersburg
These things spread like wildfire
can just hear those malicious whispers behind my back
'll never be able to show my face in polite society
39
And if it ever got back to my old regiment -- you don't know the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers -- they'll strike me off the rolls -- they'll cut off my pension
Watson, you're running amok
Dishonored, disgraced, ostracized
What am  to do
Well, for one thing, 'd get rid of that flower
He points to the flower behind Watson's ear
Watson grabs the flower, hurls it into the fireplace
You may think this is funny, but we're both in the same boat
We must take desperate measures
We must stop this talk
(a beat, then an idea) Maybe if we got married
Then they'd really talk
(starts pacing) Obviously, we cannot continue to live under the same roof
We must move apart
Of course, we can still see each other clandestinely -- on remote benches in Hyde Park, and in the waiting rooms of suburban railway stations -- (a change in attitude; defiant) The whole thing is ridiculous
We have nothing to hide
That's what 've been trying to tell you
40
Let somebody start a rumor -- just one ugly word -- and we'll sue them for slander
Nobody would dare
After all, you have an enviable record with the fair sex
Damn right
can get women from three continents to testify for me
And you can get women to vouch for you, too -- can't you, Holmes
No answer from Holmes
Watson is becoming a little concerned
Can you, Holmes
Good night, Watson
He starts toward his bedroom
Holmes, let me ask you a question -- (Holmes stops) hope 'm not being presumptuous -- but there have been women in your life
The answer is yes
(a relieved sigh from Watson) You're being presumptuous
(Watson's face falls) Good night
He walks into his bedroom, shutting the door
Watson takes a tentative step after him
Holmes
: 41
- 221B   - There is a cheery fire burning in the grate
Holmes is stretched out full-length on the couch, playing a set of Corelli variations on his violin
Watson is in his usual chair, reading the Evening Standard
' What, indeed, was his attitude toward women
Was there some secret he was holding back -- or was he just a thinking machine, incapable of any emotion
- Wisps of fog swirl along the street, making yellow haloes around street lamps
' was not to get the answer until we became involved in what  consider to be the most outrageous case in all our years together
Out of the mist comes a hansom cab, with the dim figure of a woman visible in the passenger seat
The cab stops in front of 221B, and the driver starts to get down
From upstairs comes the faint sound of violin music
- Watson steps up to the window, pulls the curtain aside, looks down toward the street
221B   - The cabbie crosses the pavement, consults an address in his hand, glances up at the number of the house, then rings the bell
- 221B   - Watson turns away from the window, as the  downstairs rings again
Holmes stops playing
42
Were you expecting someone
Not at this hour
Maybe Mrs
Hudson is entertaining
never found her so
Watson crosses to the door, opens it, steps out
Holmes resumes playing Corelli
- 221B   - Mrs
Hudson, in a robe and night-cap, is talking to the cabbie in the open street door when Watson appears on the landing above
What is it, Mrs
Hudson
(looking up) There's a cabbie here -- he says you owe him two-and-six
For what
(to Watson) For the fare, guv'nor
The young lady doesn't have any money
What young lady
This one
He reaches out the door, pulls in the young lady in question
She is in her early thirties, with strikingly handsome features, but at the moment she is somewhat worse for wear
She is wrapped in a blanket, her hair is wet, and there is a bruise on her temple
43
She is wearing and wedding ring and her name, we will subsequently learn, is
Well
What have we here
(he starts down the stairs) Who are you, miss
What happened to you
(slight accent) don't know
That's all she keeps saying --  don't know,  don't know
The violin music stops o
s
Watson has now reached the foot of the stairs
Where did she come from
From the river
was driving down the Embankment, just below Westminster Bridge, and there she was in the water -- drowning
Holmes appears on the landing above, violin and bow in his hand
It wasn't easy, guv'nor -- what with the cold water -- and her fighting me -- (from the upper landing) Why did you bring her here
Because  found this in her hand -- (gives a square of soggy cardboard to Watson) -- 221B Baker Street -- that's right, isn't it
Watson examines the cardboard, nods
44
(to Gabrielle) Young lady -- what did you want at this address
(looking up, trying to focus) do not remember
(to Holmes) Rather perplexing, wouldn't you say
Rather
Well, gentlemen, you want her
-- it's two-and-six -- or shall  throw her back in the river
Mr
Holmes
You can't let him -- Watson, you'd better accept delivery
Watson fishes some coins out of his pocket, hands them to the cabbie
Keep the change
Thank you, guv'nor
He snatches the blanket off Gabrielle, revealing that her dress is clinging to her damply
No extra charge for the use of the horse- blanket
He exits into the street, shutting the door
Gabrielle hugs herself for warmth
You're shivering, my dear
(he puts his arm around her) 45
Come along
Let me get you out of those wet clothes
He starts to lead her up the stairs
- The cabbie has tossed the blanket into the hansom, and is mounting the driver's seat
Across the street, a man steps out of the fog into a pool of light cast by one of the street lamps
He is a craggy-faced Prussian of about fifty, and his name is
He looks up toward the Holmes flat
As the hansom makes a -turn and comes abreast of him, he hops into the cab
The hansom disappears into the fog
- 221B   - Watson is leading Gabrielle to a chair by the fireplace
Holmes is putting his violin down on the table
Sit here, my dear
He settles her in the chair
Holmes comes over, plucks the square of cardboard from Watson's hand
She's suffering from shock and exposure
He starts to massage her wrists to restore her circulation
Holmes is examining the soggy cardboard
On one side is their address, written in pencil
He turns it over, disclosing some smudges of green ink on the other side
There was some printing on the back of this -- but it seems to have come off in the water
Watson is now studying the bruise on Gabrielle's temple
Look at this -- she's had a nasty blow on the head
46
Could she have hit her head when she fell or jumped into the river
No
The blood has already coagulated
So it would appear that she was the victim of a deliberate attack
Get my bag, will you
As Holmes fetches the medical bag, Gabrielle looks from one to the other
Who are you
'm Dr
Watson -- and this is Mr
Sherlock Holmes
Do the names mean anything to you
No
Think
'm trying
Can you think of your own name
(a beat, then shakes her head) No
She's obviously had a concussion -- which often leads to temporary amnesia
He has now taken some cotton and a bottle of antiseptic out of the medical bag, and is swabbing her wound
So all we know is that she was coshed on the head, dumped into the Thames, and subsequently dumped into our laps
47
We know a lot more than that
From her accent, we know she is foreign -- from her ring, we know she is married -- and there is one other clue we have
Something  deduced while  was helping her up the stairs
No corset
Good work
He glances down at Gabrielle's shoe, which has slipped off her foot
Inside, slightly worn away, are the words: (to Gabrielle) Are you French
(in Berlitz French) Vous etes Francaise
(concentrating -- then) Non, je ne suis pas Francaise
How can she say she's not French, in French
Vous etes Suisse
Non
Alors, vous etes Belge
(haltingly) Je suis pas sure
Holmes reaches behind her, turns back the collar of her dress
Sewn inside is a label reading:  , Bruxelles
Vous etes Belge -- de Bruxelles
48
Bruxelles
Oui
Je pense que oui
Mrs
Hudson has come in with a loaded tea-tray, starts to put it down on the table
Oh, dash
Will someone remove the violin, please
Watson takes the violin off the table, and she sets down the tray
We just found out that she's Belgian
Poor thing
From Brussels
(taking Gabrielle's hand) If you don't mind
He slips the wedding ring off her finger, picks up a magnifying glass, examines it
It is made of copper, and engraved on the inside is the inscription: Gabrielle - Emile
Your name is Gabrielle, is that right
Gabrielle
don't know
And your husband's name is Emile
(vaguely) Emile
Where is he
What are you doing in London
49
don't know
When did you arrive from Brussels
Where are you staying
don't know
What happened at the river
Think
Pensez
Concentrez vous
Gabrielle bursts into sobs
(stepping forward) That's enough, Holmes
will not permit you to question her in this condition
(helps the sobbing Gabrielle out of the chair) Mrs
Hudson, put her to bed
My bed
(Mrs
Hudson gives him a look) 'll sleep on the couch
Come, my dear
She puts her arm around Gabrielle, who is still crying, leads her into Watson's bedroom
'd better mix her a sleeping potion
He gets a packet of white powder out of his medical bag, and during the following, stirs a spoonful into her tea- cup
Watson,  think we should arrange to have her removed to a hospital
Under no circumstances
She should have medical attention
50
She can get that from me
But more importantly, she must be protected -- there has already been one attempt on her life
This temporary amnesia -- how temporary is it
It depends on the extent of the injury
It's like veils shrouding her memory
It could clear up in a few days -- or a few weeks
Watson, this is a very small flat -- we don't want to clutter it up with women
Holmes, we've never had a case like this
woman comes to us with a problem -- we don't know who the woman is -- and we don't know what the problem is
Don't you find that challenging
Quite
But we can't afford to wait for those veils to lift -- we must break through them as quickly as possible
You   really feel it's that urgent
do
The sooner we solve the case, the sooner we can get rid of her
Oh
He picks up the cup of tea with the sedative in it, carries it toward the door of his bedroom
: 51
- The street lamps are still lit
policeman, on patrol duty, is strolling along the sidewalk, swinging his truncheon
Suddenly he sees something up ahead
Alarmed, he ducks into the doorway of a building, flattens himself against the door
From the opposite direction comes a horse-drawn water- sprinkling wagon
The spray covers the sidewalks as well as the street
The policeman waits till the wagon is past, then steps out of the doorway relieved, resumes his patrol
- 221B   - Watson is asleep on the couch, covered with a blanket
He doesn't look as if he were in a very comfortable position
'  - Holmes, in a dressing gown, is standing by the window, studying the square of cardboard with the green smudges on it
His bed has not been slept in
'  - Gabrielle is asleep in Watson's bed
The door opens slowly, and Holmes looks in
He studies the sleeping Gabrielle for a moment, then quietly pulls the door shut
As the latch clicks into place, Gabrielle awakes and sits up in bed, her back to
She is nude
Emile
She starts to get out of bed
'  - Holmes is back in his room, once more examining the cardboard by the light of the window
The door of Watson's bedroom opens, and Gabrielle comes out
52
Emile
Holmes looks up as Gabrielle appears in the open doorway
Emile
Is that you, Emile
(stepping into shadow) Yes, Gabrielle
(hurrying toward him) Ah, Emile
thought 'd never find you
(embracing him) Hold me
Hold me tight
(Holmes puts his arms around her) It's been such a long time
So many nights
You know what  did before left Brussels
What
hope you won't be angry with me bought myself an expensive negligee
Did you
(moving toward bed) pink negligee with maribou feathers
Don't you think that's a foolish thing for a married woman
(she gets into bed, beckons to him) Come
Where is the negligee
In my luggage
Come here
53
(moving toward her) And where is your luggage
(impatiently) don't know
Come, my love
Come
Please
As she extends her right hand to him, in a beckoning gesture, Holmes notices something on the palm
He takes her hand in his
There, in the same green ink as the smudges on the cardboard, are what appear the be the letters "", "", and Greek ""
Crossing to the wash- stand, he picks up his magnifying shaving mirror, returns to the bed, holds it up against the palm of Gabrielle's hand
What is it, Emile
What are you doing
Clearly reflected in the mirror is the reverse image of the lettering on Gabrielle's palm -- the number "301"
: - 221B   - The table is set for breakfast, and Mrs
Hudson is opening the curtains, flooding the room with sunlight
Then she moves over to the couch, where Watson is sleeping in an awkward position
Dr
Watson
(she claps her hands and he wakes up) Your porridge is getting lumpy
Hadn't you better get up
Watson tries to rise, falls back with a moan
would like to very much
But -- (he turns over on his stomach) Mrs
Hudson, would you mind planting your knee in the small of my back
54
Yes,  would
Please
'm in excruciating pain
Mrs
Hudson tentatively rests her knee on Watson's back
bit higher -- just below my seventh vertebra -- (Mrs
Hudson follows instructions) That's good
Put your arms under mine -- fold them behind my neck -- Mrs
Hudson presses down harder, and there is a distinct snap
Bless you
(he rises, rubbing his neck) That damn couch
(crossing to table) You'd better see if our patient is awake
He seats himself at the table
Mrs
Hudson crosses to the door of Watson's bedroom, opens it, starts inside, then stops
Dr
Watson
She's gone
Gone
He jumps up from the table, joins Mrs
Hudson, looks past her
The bed is empty
Gabrielle's clothes are in evidence, but there is no sign of her
Watson strides towards Holmes' bedroom
Holmes
Holmes
She's gone
He throws the door open, is about to step inside when he sees something that makes him freeze
55
'  - Gabrielle is asleep in Holmes' bed, covered by just a sheet, and obviously naked underneath
Holmes is not in the room
Mrs
Hudson comes up behind Watson, in the open doorway, peers over his shoulder
(scandalized) Well,  never
There is the sound of the hall door opening, and they both turn
- Holmes breezes in, carrying a large suitcase, with leather straps around it
Tucked under the straps is a white parasol
And attached to the handle of the suitcase is a cardboard tag with the number 301 on it, in green
(inhaling deeply) Mmmmm
smell porridge
Lumpy as usual,  suppose
He sets the suitcase down on the couch, as Watson and Mrs
Hudson approach
Oh, there you are, Holmes
We were just wondering -- how -- (points from his bedroom to Holmes') (sternly) We certainly were
Mrs
Hudson, why don't you go down to the kitchen -- get a towel -- and wipe that look of disapproval off your face
56
Liberties -- in my house
She exits huffily
You can't really blame her --  mean, the way it looks -- if  didn't know you better,  might suspect you'd taken advantage of the young lady
As a matter of fact,  did take advantage of her
Would you hand me the butter- knife, please
Of course
He picks up the butter-knife from the table, suddenly turns back with a delayed reaction
You did what
(taking butter-knife from him) Thank you
He starts to pry open the locks of the suitcase with the butter-knife
(spluttering) Holmes, this is reprehensible
Where are your professional ethics
Have you no sense of decency, no shame -- None whatsoever
If you must know, found her body quite rewarding
You cad
Especially the palm of her right hand
57
'd rather not hear about it
Very well
Then  won't bother to tell you how  traced her suitcase
That's her suitcase
Remember that piece of soggy cardboard with our address on it
It was a luggage ticket -- the number rubbed off on her hand
And since she must have arrived from Brussels by the boat train, concluded that she had checked her belongings at Victoria Station
By Jove
If you're right, we should find a clue to her identity
Holmes has now forced open the locks
Or at least a pink negligee with maribou feathers
He opens the suitcase, lifts out the top piece of clothing, holds it up -- a pink negligee with maribou feathers
Voila
Let's see - what else is in here
They start sorting through the clothes in the suitcase
Holmes removes a tied bundle of letters
Now we're getting somewhere
As he examines the envelope, Watson takes out a framed photo of a rather attractive man of fifty
Who do you suppose this is
58
Gabrielle appears from Holmes' bedroom wearing Holmes' dressing gown
She is unsteady on her feet and somewhat dazed
Holmes looks up
Come in, Madame Valladon
(Gabrielle stops) You are Gabrielle Valladon
Yes
(holding up photo) And this is your husband, Emile Valladon
Yes
Her eyes fall on the open suitcase
Sorry to have ransacked your valise
But since you came to us for help -- Where am
221B Baker Street
Oh, yes
(a beat, as she orients herself) Which of you is Mr
Holmes and which is Dr
Watson
Dr
Watson is the handsome one
Watson, pleased, twirls the end of his mustache
Gabrielle sways slightly
That's the way he affects most women
He helps her into a chair
59
(to Gabrielle) Coffee
You want strong coffee
He hurries over to the breakfast table
It's all so confusing
Let's try to sort it out
You came to London looking for your husband
Yes
He's a mining engineer
We were married five years ago, in the Congo
Where your husband was working in a copper mine
How did you know
Your wedding ring -- it's made of copper
He picks it up from the chemistry table, hands it to her
Gabrielle starts to put it on
Last year he invented a new kind of air pump, and was hired by an English company, Jonah Limited
(handing her cup of of coffee) Here you are
Jonah Limited
Go on
We've been writing to each other regularly
Then suddenly,  three weeks ago, his letters stopped
kept writing but no answer
Finally   decided to go to that address -- 60
She indicates the bundle of letters
Holmes glances at the return address on the back of the envelope
32 Ashdown Street
Yes
It's just an empty store -- nobody there
Then  tried to find Jonah Limited
No such company exists
How decidedly odd
Madame Valladon, can you think of any reason why your husband should have lied to you about theses things
Emile
Never
He loves me -- and  love him
So  gathered
went to the police -- they said they would send out a missing persons report -- but they didn't sound too encouraging
Then  went to the Belgian embassy and explained the situation to them -- and they suggested that  consult you
You could have done worse
was on my way here -- and suddenly there were footsteps behind me -- and a hand over my mouth -- and the smell of choloroform -- and the next thing  knew was in the water -- and then a man was wrapping me in a blanket -- Madame Valladon, somebody tried to kill you last night
Do you have any idea who could have done it
61
don't understand any of it
(rises, goes to Holmes) What does it all mean, Mr
Holmes
Where is my husband
You must help me find him
We'll do our best,  assure you
Madame Valladon,  want you to send one more letter to your husband
He crosses to the desk, picks up a sheet of paper and an envelope, then leads Gabrielle over to the chair with the writing arm, seats her in it
To Emile Valladon -- Ashdown Street -- what was that number
(addressing envelope) 32
What do you want me to say in the letter
Nothing
He folds the blank sheet of paper, and as Gabrielle finishes addressing the envelope, he inserts the paper in it, starts to seal it
You're sending an empty sheet of paper to an empty shop
That empty shop is obviously    being used as an accomodation address,    or letter- drop
But what gets dropped     must be picked up
The question is     how
-- and by whom
-- and why
: 62
- This is a run-down district in the northwestern part of London
On the corner is No
32 -- a dilapidated abandoned shop, with windows painted halfway up
As   the building, we hear sawing from inside
- It is dusty, cobwebby, quite forbidding
In the rear wall is a closed sliding door, indented about a foot into the shop
Nearby stands a large, square object, covered with a tarpaulin
High up in the rear wall is a slanted skylight, fitted with an iron grill
From outside, Holmes, in deerstalker and Inverness, can be seen sawing through the iron bars
Watson and Gabrielle are beside him
Hammer
Chisel
Watson hands him the indicated tools
Holmes chips away the cement from the top and bottom of the last bar, then using it as a hinge, swings the grill open
He lets himself through the skylight, drops to the floor
Watson now helps Gabrielle through the skylight, lowers her toward Holmes, who puts his arms around her waist, eases her to the floor
For a brief moment he keeps his arms around her
Watson has now squeezed through the skylight
Here
He hands the tools to Holmes, jumps to the floor
Gabrielle is looking around the shop
It's so strange to think 've been writing to a place like this all these months
Watson crosses to the square tarpaulin-covered object
He lifts up one corner of the tarp -- and is greeted by a loud twittering of birds
63
What he has uncovered is a large cage -- and about a hundred canaries, suddenly disturbed, are flapping around unside
Look at all these canaries
Do you suppose this could have been a pet shop
Maybe
(pointing off) Here comes our letter
Through the front window, the silhouette of a postman can be seen approaching
He drops a letter through the slot in the front door, moves on
The letter lands on a section of floor which is solidly covered with dust -- except for a series of double tracks, running to the door and curving back
Now we are faced with the most nerve- wracking part of the detective's job -- doing nothing
He reassembles the three tools, fitting each section into another, to form a cane
Mr
Holmes -- Yes
don't know how 'm going to pay you for all this
The purse with my money is somewhere at the bottom of the Thames
It could be worse
You could be at the bottom of the Thames -- much to your discomfort -- and much to my chagrin
don't understand how anybody picks up letters here
(pointing) No footprints -- just tracks
What does it mean
64
would surmise somebody is using ice- skates -- if it weren't for a conspicuous absence of ice
They become aware of a squeaking noise outside the rear of the shop, growing louder as it gets nearer
The noise stops, there is the sound of a lock turning, then the rattle of a chain
(in a frantic whisper) What do we do now
(unfazed) This way
He leads Gabrielle and Watson toward the rear wall, right next to the door
They flatten themselves with their backs to the wall, just as the door slides open -- concealing them from view
Revealed is the mews behind the shop
In the door is an old  with straggly hair, sitting in a wheelchair
In her lap are a bulky paper bag and a tin pitcher filled with water
As she wheels herself inside, the unoiled wheelchair squeaks loudly
She stops in front of the cage, pulls on a rope which runs through a pulley in the ceiling -- and the tarpaulin rises into the air, exposing the canaries
(addressing birds) Good morning, my pretties
Here's Mum with your breakfast
Did you think 'd forgotten you
She pours grain from the paper bag into a feeder hanging inside the cage, pours water from the pitcher into a trough
Some  of you will be going on a little trip  soon --  hate to lose you -- but even  an old woman has to live
Although you  might well ask, why
She cackles to herself, glances toward the front door
65
Oh
You never told me we had a letter
She starts to wheel herself toward the front of the shop
Through a crack in the door behind which our three are hiding, we see Holmes' eye watching her
The old woman reaches the letter, picks it up, studies the address
Then she hears something, glances toward the open rear door
horse-drawn wagon with a canvas top is just pulling into the mews
Two  jump down from the driver's seat, and one of them takes a small bird-cage from the back of the wagon
As they start in through the door, the old woman drops the letter into her lap, wheels herself toward them
Morning, Duchess
Morning
What have you been doing with yourself
What do you think
Taking dancing lessons
(she stops in front of the cage) How many do you want this time
Two dozen
He opens the door of the small cage, the bottom of which is covered with newspaper, starts transferring canaries into it from the large cage
What are they doing with all those canaries
What's going on up there
Look, Duchess, we don't know -- and we don't want to know

When you work for Jonah, it's better not to ask questions
Through the crack in the door behind which he is hidden, we see Holmes' eye studying the small bird cage, as the canaries are being transferred into it
We    on the small cage, and see the soiled newspaper spread on the bottom
The masthead reads: (counting as he transfers canaries) twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty- four
He closes the doors of the cages, picks up the small cage
His companion indicates the letter in the woman's lap
How about that letter
Does that go, too
No
That's going to be picked up in person
She chuckles
The carriers exit into the mews, stash the cage in the back of the wagon, mount the driver's seat
(to birds) All right, my pretties
Back to sleep you go
See you tomorrow
She pulls the rope and the tarpaulin drops back over the cage
Then she deposits the letter on top of the covered cage, wheels herself out the rear door
As she slides it shut from outside, our trio is revealed in their hiding places behind the door
There is the sound of the chain rattling, the lock snapping, and the squeaky wheels moving off
(a sigh of relief) really thought we were done for
67
(casually) The art of concealment, my dear Watson, is merely a matter of being in the right place at the right time
They step forward, and through the painted shop window watch the old woman wheel herself down the street
Did you hear what she said
You really think Emile is going to pick up the letter himself
It certainly would simplify things, wouldn't it
(shaking his head) Maildrops and canaries and wheelchairs
And what was all that about Jonah
And what do you suppose they're doing up there
And where is up there
My guess would be Scotland
Inverness, to be more precise
Inverness
Didn't you notice the paper at the bottom of their cage
The Inverness Courier
Gabrielle glances casually at the letter the old woman left lying on top of the cage, and her expression changes
Mr
Holmes
This letter -- (she picks it up) What about it
(holding it out to him) It's addressed to you
68
Holmes takes the letter, examines the envelope
It is indeed addressed to him
Nevertheless -- With the saw-end of his cane, he slits the envelope open, removes the enclosure, unfolds it
We see the letter in his hand as he reads it out loud
The letterhead says: , St
James's, London
(reading) My Dear Sherlock:  expect you and Dr
Watson to join me at the club immediately upon reciept of this note
According to my calculations, that should be at 11:40 a
m
Your brother, Mycroft
(looking up) What time do you make it, Watson
(consulting watch) 11:43
Either your watch is wrong, or Mycroft has miscalculated
And knowing Mycroft, suggest you reset your watch
Watson automatcially obeys
: - Holmes, cane in hand, and Watson are swiftly ascending the steps of a building with an imposing Palladian facade
Beside the entrance is a discreet sign reading: Members Only
As they reach the top of the steps, Watson stops Holmes
don't mind telling you 'm a bit apprehensive about this
69
'm rather curious myself as to what is going on in that Machiavellian mind of his
don't mean Mycroft,  mean Madame Valladon
Don't worry
She's perfectly safe with Mrs
Hudson
He opens the door and they start in
-   - Dominating the lobby is a large statue of Queen Victoria
Presiding over the reception desk is a uniformed of military bearing, with one arm and a chest full of campaign ribbons
Holmes and Watson stride in
(to porter) To see Mr
Mycroft Holmes
Right you are
He's expecting you in the upstairs study
Now if you gentlemen will sign in -- (opens leather-bound register, turns it toward them) Surname, Christian name, address, nature of business -- He holds out the pen to them, but they are gone
He looks around in consternation, sees them hurrying up the majestic staircase, steps out from behind his desk
Gentlemen
-   - huge room, with more marble than a mausoleum, and just about as lively
70
dozen elderly Establishment types are sunk deep in the leather armchairs, buried behind their copies of The Times
Holmes and Watson are proceeding toward the study
Suddenly Holmes stops beside one of the old fossils, who has fallen asleep in his chair, The Times in his lap, and between his fingers a lighted cigar with an ash four inches long
Holmes picks up an ashtray, holds it under the cigar -- just in time to catch the falling ash
As  he replaces the ashtray, he scrutinizes the ash
Jamaican, no doubt -- either Tropical or Golosina -- 'm not quite sure
He and Watson continue toward the study door
-   - It is a very elegant room   -- shelves of leather-bound volumes reach to the high   ceiling, there are antique terrestrial and celestial   gloves, scientific instruments in polished brass, marble   busts of English statesmen
is standing at a refectory table, with his back to the door, engaged in a curious operation dusty bottle of wine is held in an ingeniously engineered cradle
As he turns the crank, the bottle tilts forward gently, and he decants the wine into three glasses without disturbing the sediment
Mycroft is an impressive figure of a man, seven years older than Sherlock, impeccably dressed
Behind his snobbish airs and bantering manner, one senses tremendous reserves of strength and authority
The door opens, and Holmes and Watson enter
(without turning) Come in, come in, Sherlock -- Dr
Watson
Sit down
(Holmes and Watson seat themselves) You're looking very fit, both of you
Thank you
71
(putting down hat and cane) And how are you, Mycroft
How's your gout
Under control
Except for the occasional twinge
He brings over two of the glasses of wine to Holmes and Watson
have a treat for you -- a very old Madeira -- 1814
There are  only six bottles left in the world
have two of them, and am negotiating for a third
If you don't mind my saying so, anybody who's susceptible to gout shouldn't be -- Mycroft has moved back to the table and picked up his glass of Madeira
The last doctor who warned me about that was crossing Piccadilly, slipped on an orange peel, and was run over by a delivery van from the Fortnum and Mason
Your very good health
He and Watson sip their drinks, but not Holmes
Why are you wasting this precious stuff on us
Well,  see you so rarely
How long has it been
Not since the case of the Greek interpreter
(to Watson) Isn't it ridiculous
Two brothers living in the same town
In the same town, perhaps -- but not the same world
72
(taking another sip) Mmmm
Superb
How old did you say it was
1814
One year before Waterloo
One year before Waterloo
Think of that
You do know where Waterloo is, don't you, Doctor
Belgium, isn't it
Quite
(turning to Holmes) And speaking of Belgium, it has come to my attention that you are interested in the whereabouts of a certain engineer
Yes,  am
Well,  can save you a lot of trouble
'd be grateful for any suggestion -- My suggestion is that you pursue it no further
Any particular reason
Because it involves the national security
We are handling this matter ourselves
We
Who's we
73
The Diogenes Club, of course
didn't say that
have always suspected that there was some underground connection between this stodgy and seemingly calcified establishment and the Foreign Office in Whitehall
That's neither here nor there
It seems to me that The Diogenes Club is here, there and everywhere
When there are rumblings of revolt in the Sudan, an expedition subsidized by your club conveniently shows up to study the source of the Nile
When there is trouble along the Indian frontier, some of your fellow members pop up in the Himalayas, alledgedly looking for the Abominable Snowman
in morning coat and striped trousers comes in, holding a telegram
Mycroft crosses to him
(to Watson) What a fertile imagination my brother has
At the age of five, by carefully observing a neighbor's house, he deduced that babies were brought not by the stork, but by the mid-wife in her satchel
As good an explanation as any
Mycroft has taken the telegram, and is coming forward with it
The young man clears his throat
Yes, Wiggins
74
An immediate answer is requested, sir
Mycroft inserts a monocle in his eye, opens the telegram, moves toward the desk reading it
Tell them that the three boxes go to Glennahurich, and the red runner goes to the castle
The three boxes to Glennahurich, the red runner to the castle
Very good, sir
He exits
Holmes glances toward the telegram as Mycroft puts it down on his desk
Catching his look, Mycroft turns his telegram face-down, lets the monocle drop from his eye
Why don't you crumple it up and swallow it -- to make sure
My dear Sherlock, there  are certain affairs that do not come  within the province of the private  detective
They have to be dealt with on  an altogether different level
In other words, you want me to stay within my limits
do indeed
Speaking of limits, what exactly is Jonah Limited
Sherlock, when  said drop this case, it was not merely a suggestion -- it was an order
By whose authority
75
By the authority of Her Majesty's government
hope 've made myself clear
Perfectly
In his nervousness he drops his bowler, which rolls along the floor
Now if you'll excuse me, gentlemen -- Goodbye, sir
pleasure, as always
He and Watson retrieve their hats, move toward the door
(to Holmes) Just a minute
(picks up Holmes' cane) You forgot your tool-kit
He tosses the cane to Holmes, who catches it
: - Holmes and Watson are walking toward 221B
Holmes is whistling 'Loch Lomond
' You will be gentle, won't you, when you tell her you're dropping the case
Watson, what does the word Glennahurich suggest to you
Absolutely nothing
76
It's Scottish
Is it
And like all Scottish names, it's really a word picture
Glen means valley, na means of the, and Hurich, if memory serves me, means yew tree
You're just trying to impress me
So the three boxes go to the Valley of the Yew Tree
He resumes whistling
They start to cross the street, skirting a parked hansom
Feeding the horse is the same cabbie who fished Gabrielle out of the river, and in the passenger seat is Von Tirpitz, the craggy-faced Prussian we saw before
He stares fixedly after Holmes and Watson
Holmes and Watson come up to the door of 221B, and Watson fishes his key out
Holmes is still whistling
(singing along) And 'll be in Scotland before ye
(breaks off, looks at Holmes apprehensively) You are dropping the case, aren't you, Holmes
Open the door
Watson turns the key in the lock, starts to open the door, but is stopped by a chain on the inside
Through the opening a revolver appears, aiming at them point- blank
Don't shoot, Mrs
Hudson -- you're liable to lose two excellent tenants
77
- 221B   - Mrs
Hudson withdraws the gun, unhooks the chain
She is also holding an embroidery hoop
She opens the door, and Holmes and Watson step into the vestibule
Oh, at last
It's been a ghastly experience
Why
What happened
Did you ever try doing embroidery with a gun in your hand
(taking gun from her) You'll be relieved to know it was not loaded
He starts up the stairs, followed by Watson
Holmes, you didn't answer my  question
Are you planning to disobey  Mycroft's orders
He's not just your   brother, you know
You'd be defying Her   Majesty's government
No reaction from Holmes
As they reach the landing, Gabrielle is waiting for them in the open doorway of their flat
Any news
Did you find out anything
- 221B   - Holmes and Watson step inside
Let's just say  know what the next step will be
78
(anxious) Yes
want you to pack your things
Where are we going
Holmes, let me caution you --- Holmes has put the gun down, and is crossing to one of the book-shelves
(to Gabrielle) At 7:30 this evening, Dr
Watson and are going to take you to Victoria Station, and put you on the boat-train
The boat-train
Well, that's better
Holmes has taken a railway guide from the shelf and is consulting it
You're sending me back to Brussels
Is that it
Madame Valladon, you must understand
(to Holmes, agitated) came here to find my husband -- you were going to help me -- Yes, my dear
But circumstances have changed -- The great detective
Well, maybe this case is too small for you -- 79
On the contrary
It's being handled at a much higher level -- Well,  won't go back to Brussels
Maybe you're giving up, but 'm not
(tears welling up in her eyes) 'm going to go on looking for him
And nobody's going to stop me -- even if they try to kill me
(looking up from railway guide) Are you quite finished
If you recall, what  said was that we're going to put you on the boat-train --  didn't say you were going to stay on it
She's not
At 7:30, Mr
Holmes and Dr
Watson will be seen waving goodbye to Madame Valladon at Victoria Station
At eight-twelve, Mr
and Mrs
Ashdown accompanied by their valet John -- (a glance at Watson) -- will appear at Euston Station, and board the Highland Express to Inverness
Mr
and Mrs
(moving toward Holmes) Thank you
'm sorry for what  said
(kisses him on cheek) That's not necessary
(smiling through tears) 'll go and pack
She hurries off toward Watson's room
80
(acidly) Maybe  should do it, since 'm the valet
Holmes replaces the railway guide on the shelf
Holmes, what exactly are you up to
As you like to put it in your chronicles, the game is afoot
But what game
Are you really that interested in the Belgian engineer
Without answering, Holmes heads for his bedroom
Or the wife of the Belgian engineer
Holmes, by this time in his bedroom, shuts the door
Gabrielle reappears from the other bedroom, carrying a glove
You don't like me very much, do you
She moves toward the couch
Nothing of the sort
Quite the opposite
But there's more to this case than meets the eye -- By this time Gabrielle has picked up her parasol from the couch, and is obviously searching about
Looking for something
My other glove
Let me help you
81
He peers under the couch
Gabrielle moves toward the window, shakes the parasol, opens it a few times
Here it is
He comes up from under the couch with the missing glove
Thank you
She slowly starts to shut the parasol
- Through the upstairs window of 221B we see Gabrielle shutting the parasol
the hansom parked across the street, and von Tirpitz watching
He signals to the cabbie, who is back on his perch
The cabbie flicks his whip, and the hansom takes off down the street
: - The Highland Express is speeding northward through the moonlit landscape, its steam whistle hooting mournfully
- The upper and lower berths have been made up in the small, gaslit compartment
Gabrielle's dress is on a hanger, but there is no sign of her at the moment
Holmes is just pulling a night-shirt over his head
All right
You can look now
Gabrielle's head appears from under the covers of the lower berth
Am  embarrassing you, Mr
Holmes
82
Not at all
Would it surprise you if told you  once spent the night with 121 women
Oh
On a very interesting case -- in a harem in Constantinople
He starts to climb up the ladder to the upper berth
- There is the normal complement of passengers, men, women and children, of the middle and lower classes
The only unusual occupants are a group of seven , in brown habits and cowls
Watson, in valet's livery, comes down the aisle, proceeds toward a window-seat where he has left his umbrella and bowler
The resf of the bench is occupied by monks, as is the facing bench
As Watson tries to squeeze between them, he steps on the foot of one of the monks
Sorry, father --  mean, friar -- or is it abbot
There is no answer from the monk
Watson picks up his bowler, settles himself in his seat, starts to fan himself with his hat
He turns sociably to the monk beside him, who is absorbed in his Bible
Going to Scotland, you gentlemen
So are we
As he fans himself the ear-pieces of his stethoscope, which is coiled inside the crown of his bowler, dangle down
He quickly shoves them back inside
'm a valet
My master and mistress and are our way to Inverness
Ever been there
Beautiful country
83
The monk looks up from his Bible, points to his lips, shakes his head
Oh, forgive me
You must be one of those orders that's taken the vow of silence
Trappists,  believe you're called
The monk doesn't answer
Watson turns away, looks out the window -- but there's nothing to be seen
Then he folds, bored
He glances casually at the Bible in the monk's hands
The Good Book is opened to a page headed:
see you're reading the book of Jonah
Funny - we were just talking about Johan this morning
(realizes the hopelessness of the conversation, breaks off) Never mind
He pulls down the shade, closes his eyes, tries to compose himself into sleep
- Holmes is stretched out in the upper berth, which is in darkness
In the lower, Gabrielle is propped up against a pillow, reading a magazine by the light of a gas lamp
Other magazines are scattered across her blanket
Women are never to be trusted entirely -- not the best of them
Holmes raises himself on his elbow, glances down over the edge of his berth
What did you say
didn't say it -- you did
According to Dr
Watson
84
Oh
He gave me some back issues of Strand Magazine
The good doctor is constantly putting words into my mouth
Then you deny it
Not at all
am not a whole-hearted admirer of womankind
'm not very fond of them myself
The most affectionate woman  ever knew was a murderess
Oh
It was one of those passionate affairs -- at odd hours -- right in my laboratory
And all the time, behind my back, she was stealing cyanide to sprinkle on her husband's steak and kidney pie
You mustn't judge all women by -- Of course not
Only the ones  was involved with
And  don't just mean professionally -- kleptomaniacs, nymphomaniacs, pyromaniacs
Take my fiancee, for instance -- Your fiancee
85
She was the daughter of my violin teacher -- we were engaged to be married -- the invitations were out,  was being fitted for a tail-coat -- and twenty-four hours before the wedding, she died of influenza
'm sorry
It just proves my contention that women are unreliable and not to be trusted
(a beat) Good night, Mrs
Ashdown
He pulls the curtain across his berth
Good night, Mr
Ashdown
She closes her curtain, as the train whistle sounds
- Most of the passengers in the car have fallen asleep, in various uncomfortable positions, including Watson
The monk beside Watson looks at him, to make sure he's out, then rises and moves toward a monk seated apart from the others
(in a whisper) Die Spur fuehrt nach Inverness
Die steigen dort aus
Dort muessen wir ihn finded -- den Valladon
The other monk looks up
Under the cowl we recognize the face of von Tirpitz
: 86
- The Highland Express is pulling out of the station
As the last car disappears, and the steam clears from the tracks, we see Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson on the platform
is loading their luggage on a hand-cart, under Watson's supervision
Let's see -- two, three, four -- Gabrielle removes her parasol, which has been inserted under the straps of her suitcase
'll take that
(to baggageman) How do you get to Glennahurich
How far is it
Glennahurich
You know -- a valley -- with a yew tree
Gabrielle casually opens her parasol
It's about a mile out of town
(a beat) Why would you be wanting to go there
Well, if it's got a view, it might be a nice place for a picnic
It's got a view, right enough -- but it's no place for a picnic
Why not
Because it's a cemetary
87
Gabrielle looks at Holmes
an iron footbridge, spanning the railway tracks
Moving across it in single file are the seven cowled Trappist monks, with von Tirpitz in the lead
: - Under a leaden sky, the yew trees which give the place its name brood over ancient gravestones
Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come down an overgrown path, stop and look off
rather meagre funeral procession is moving along the avenue which runs between the rows of graves
It consists of one normal-size pine coffin and two smaller ones, loaded on a cart which is being wheeled by a couple of workmen
Bringing up behind is a , with an open prayer book in his hands
(a note of excitement) The three boxes
Is that it, Holmes
would think so
The two small ones -- they must be children's coffins
Holmes starts to cut across between the graves, Gabrielle and Watson following
At the grave-site, the workmen are removing the coffins from the cart
There is one large grave, two smaller ones
couple of grave-diggers stand by respectfully, caps in hands
Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come up behind a nearby headstone, stop and watch
At the grave-site, the minister is finishing the service
earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust
88
In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord, Jesus Christ
Amen
The workmen trundle the cart off, the minister following
The grave-diggers don their caps, pick up their shovels
From their vantage point, Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson are watching
It's so sad
Sad -- and rather odd
There are no flowers -- and no mourners
The grave-diggers have finished filling in the graves when Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come up
Morning
- (looking up) Morning
Working you hard, Dad
- Not really
This is healthy country
Sometimes you sit around for weeks with nothing to do
Then you get three in one day
What happened
- An accident
Aye
Father and two sons, they say -- they were found floating in the loch
Local people
- No
Nobody around here knows them
The story is that their boat capsized in a swell -- but  don't believe it
89
What do you believe
- You may think 'm an old fool or an old drunk -- but 've living around Loch Ness all my life
Are you trying to tell us it was the monster
- Damn right
MacLarnin saw the kids' faces when they were pulled out of the water -- looked like old men -- must've died of fright
Incredible
- Is it
Last Easter Sunday my wife and me, we were on our way to services, when suddenly
But what's the use
He picks up a white-washed wooden cross, plants it at the head of the grave
The other grave-digger has inserted smaller crosses into the other two mounds of earth
(taking some coins out of his pocket) Here you are, Dad
(hands them to the grave- digger) - Thank you
You look like nice people
If you're wanting a holiday in Scotland, go to Loch Lomond, go to Holy Loch -- but stay away from Loch Ness
He and his partner shoulder their shovels, move off
(snorting) To think that people still believe in that nonsense
Here we are, living in the Nineteenth Century -- 90
'm ashamed to admit it -- but  was relieved when he mentioned a father and two boys
It could possibly have anything to do with Emile
It would appear not
However, there still remains the clue of the castle and the red runner -- wherever it may be
They are about to get under way when suddenly Holmes stops them
Coming down the avenue toward them are four small boys, in knickerbockers and caps, carrying bouquets of flowers
Without a word, Holmes draws Gabrielle and Watson back to their hiding place, behind the headstone
The four boys approach the freshly-filled graves
They remove their caps, lay their flowers on each of the two small graves, then kneel down and bow their heads in prayer
From their position behind the headstone, Holmes, Watson and Gabrielle are watching the four boys, who have their backs to them
If they're unidentified graves, why are those boys bringing flowers
Because it's their brothers who have just been buried
Their brothers
And they're not boys
They're as tall as they'll ever grow
Hand me some pebbles, will you
Pebbles
91
He picks some up from the ground, hands them to Holmes, who tosses them in the direction of the graves
The pebbles strike a granite cross
At the sound, the four boys simultaneously turn their heads over their shoulders
Despite their slight bodies they have the features of mature men
Gabrielle and Watson react to the sight
They are -- how do you say it in English
-- nains
Midgets
(nodding) Boys with the faces of old men
still don't see -- Would it help if  told you they were acrobats
Not at all
Do you remember a tumbling act -- six brothers -- missing from the circus
Oh, yes -- that case you turned down -- completely forgot
Some of us are cursed with memories like flypaper
And stuck there is a staggering of miscellaneous date, mostly useless
The four midgets have now risen, and putting on their caps, move off down the avenue
Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson emerge from their place of concealment
92
(worriedly) Mr
Holmes, is those are not children, then --
Quite
The question now is -- who's in the third grave
: - The point of a crowbar digs under the edge of a coffin lid, which starts to give with a squealing protest of nails
Holmes, standing in the large grave, from which the earth has been removed
Kneeling beside the grave, watching anxiously, are Gabrielle and Watson, the latter holding a bullseye lantern
Holmes pries the lid open, disclosing the corpse of a middle-aged man
His arms are folded across his chest, and on the third finger of his left hand is a wedding ring similar to Gabrielle's
From the picture of him we have seen earlier, we recognize the face as that of Emile Valladon
Gabrielle lets out a piercing scream, collapses in a faint
Watson catches her
Holmes
She's fainted
(preoccupied) Hand me that lantern
Watson passes down the lantern, and Holmes slowly shines the beam along the length of the coffin
It is Valladon, isn't it
Obviously
What is not so obvious is why his wedding ring has turned green -- 93
The lantern beam now reveals that laid out at Valladon's feet are three canaries -- their plumage bleached a grey- white color
-- and why there are three dead canaries in the coffin
White canaries
: - An open carriage is proceeding along the driveway toward the hotel, scatting a flock of sheep grazing nearby
Watson is sitting beside the coachman
Holmes and Gabrielle are in the passenger seat, their luggage is strapped to the back
Through the trees which line the road we glimpse Loch Ness, which is partly obscured by a low-lying mist
The carriage pulls up in front of the hotel, which is identified by a sign above the entrance, and Holmes, Watson and Gabrielle get out
- Holmes' hand is writing: Mr
And Mrs
Ashdown and valet, London
- The , in kilts, is just opening the curtains -- disclosing a view of the mist-shrouded lake through the window
The room is on the second floor, and is furnished in a style which has been described as Scotch Baronial -- twin beds with a night-table between them, wardrobe, chiffonier, desk, a couple of chairs, and several mounted stags' heads
Holmes and Gabrielle are in the room, Watson is bringing their bags through the door
94
You have a lovely view of the loch from here -- as soon as the morning mist rolls away
(crosses to desk, picks up guide book) If you've a mind to do any sight-seeing, here's a guide to the local points of interest
Thank you
The manager starts toward the door, nodding to Watson
This way, please
will show you to your room
Watson picks up his suitcase, follows him
- The manager and Watson come out, the latter shutting the door
suppose you're putting me in the basement
No, your room is in the attic
Good
It's the privy that's in the basement
Watson grunts as the manager leads him up a narrow flight of stairs
- Holmes removes his coat, turns to Gabrielle
May  have your wedding ring, please
95
Gabrielle tearfully removes her ring, hands it to Holmes
From his vest pocket he now produces Valladon's ring -- the copper has a greenish tinge to it
He crosses to the window, compares the two rings in the light
Gabrielle sinks down on the edge of one of the beds
Just as  thought
There is a distinct difference in color between your ring and your husband's
(a sob from Gabrielle) Which leads me to believe that the cause of death was not drowning
(Gabrielle is now crying) wish you would stop that
(crossing to her) Stop it
'm sorry
know it's not easy
But you must remember that we're that nice couple from London, on Holiday in the Highlands
(a final sniffle) 'll try
That's much better
Thank you
She manages a tentative smile
Holmes looks at her for a long moment, then -- (gruffly) Now, if  may proceed without further interruptions -- ' (from off) Mr
Ashdown
96
- Watson comes dashing down the narrow stairs from the attic, races toward teh door of Holmes' room
Mr
Ashdown
He flings the door open
- Watson bursts in breathlessly
Holmes
saw it
saw it from the attic
It's out there in the lake
You saw what
(looking around desperately) The telescope
Where's the telescope
What did you see
The monster
The monster
Watson fishes a small telescope out of Holmes' suitcase, rushes through the open French window to the balcony
- Watson focuses the telescope on the lake
- Through the swirling mist which clings to the surface of the lake, a shadowy figure with a long, monster-like neck can be see gliding along
97
- Watson almost drops the telescope in excitement
There it is
There it is
Holmes joins him on the balcony
Look for yourself
He hands the telescope to Holmes
Gabrielle comes up to the window behind them
Holmes trains the telescope on the lake
See it
See it
-   - Holmes' eye slowly scans the lake, but there is no sign of Watson's monster -- just the rolling mist
- Holmes lowers the telescope
see nothing
Nothing
He grabs the telescope from Holmes, looks toward the lake
It's gone
Gone
Maybe it was never there
swear to you --  saw it -- clear as anything -- 98
Watson, as you so succinctly put it, we are living in the Nineteenth Century -- He steps back into the room
- Watson comes halfway through the French window
Maybe that grave-digger was right -- the swell, and the boat overturning -- Monsieur Valladon may have been found in the lake -- but he did not drown
He died of asphyxiation
Asphyxiation
(holding up wedding rings) There is only one substance that can turn a copper ring green and bleach the color out of canaries -- chlorine gas
That may be
But the fact remains that saw something out there
figment of your imagination
Now let us be logical
The only concrete lead we have is the reference to the castle -- (picks up guide book from desk, opens it to map) The question is, which castle
You call yourself logical
You're the least logical man  know
Am
99
How can you say it's a figment of my imagination, when for years you've been saying  have no imagination whatsoever
He looks at Holmes almost triumphantly
: - Holmes, Gabrielle, and Watson bicycling away from the hotel
Holmes, in knickerbockers and a Norfolk jacket, and Gabrielle, holding her parasol, are on a tandem
Watson is behind them, on a bicycle with a picnic basket attached to the rack
He is in his valet's outfit, with metal clips around his trouser cuffs
The three of them bicycling past a long stone wall
They pedal up to an imposing castle
Holmes dismounts, knocks on the front door
Our trio bicycling through a copse of trees
They approach another castle
On a steep road, they ride through a flock of sheep
They are proceeding along a causeway, away from a third castle
: - Holmes and Gabrielle are sitting on a blanket, the contents of the picnic basket spread before them, having lunch
Watson is pouring the wine
Their bicycles are resting nearby
We have so far investigated  eight drafty castles -- had our bicycles  attacked by sheep and our ears assaulted  by bagpipes -- and we are exactly where  we started
100
(to Gabrielle) Would you like some cranberry sauce, dear
Yes, dear
Would you pass the cranberry sauce, please, John
Yes, dear
As he does so, he catches sight of something o
s
(calling) say there
Good afternoon
Remember me
On the road above, approaching a bridge which spans the lake where it narrows into a stream, are the seven Trappist monks, walking slowly in single file
Watson waves to them, but the monks pay no attention to him
(to Holmes) Some chaps  met on the train
We had a long conversation -- or rather,  had a long conversation -- because they're not allowed to talk -- Trappists, you know
Just study their Bibles
You'll never guess what the one next to me was reading -- the Book of Jonah -- isn't that odd
(looking after the monks) Quite
As he turns back, he notices that Gabrielle is manipulating her parasol in the air
What is it, dear
What's the matter
101
bee
She continues to work the parasol, alternately opening it and partially closing it
On the bridge von Tirpitz, who is at the rear of the file of monks, glances back toward the lakeshore
: - On a promontory jutting into Loch Ness stand the remains of a medieval fortress
Around the Tower, the Motte, and the ruins of the East wall, wooden scaffolding has been erected, and a couple of dozen men are engaged in what appears to be repair work
Amidst the rubble of the Nether Bailey, an encampment of tents has been set up
Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come bicycling up along a fence on the heights overlooking the castle, dismount in front of the locked gates
Attached to the gatepost is a sign reading: : No Unauthorized Person Permitted Beyond This Point
Well,  don't think we have to bother with this castle
It's just a pile of rubble
Then why are they taking precautions
She points to the sign -- and to a guard coming up the driveway, with a couple of huge mastiffs on leashes
Why, indeed
(turning the tandem around) Let's go
Go where
When rebuffed at the front door, one's only choice is to try the tradesmen's entrance
102
They move off
: - Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson are coming up a path from the lakeside, leading their bicycles
They lean the cycles against a ruined wall, start across the courtyard
middle-aged  in kilts emerges from the tumbled-down gatehouse, comes toward them
Sorry
No visitors allowed
Are you the guide here
Yes
The castle is closed to the public while work is going on
What are they doing
It's being restored by the Society for the Preservation of Scottish Monuments
Too bad
particularly wanted my wife to see Urquhart Castle
The tower is one of the most interesting examples of -- about 1400, wasn't it
That's right
Let me see -- was it built under James the Second or James the Third
The Thrid
If you come back next year, we'll be all done here, and 'll be glad to show you around
Thank you
103
As the three of them move off, a canvas-topped wagon comes through the stone archway, stops at the front of the steps leading to the inner courtyard
Pleasant sort, isn't he
Pleasant, but ignorant
He was off one hundred years and one James
(taps guide-book in his pocket) It's actually 1500 and James the Fourth
If he's an official guide, shouldn't he know
If he's an official guide
They have now reached the wall against which they left their bicycles
Suddenly Holmes stops, attracted by the sound of birds chirping
Listen
Do you hear anything, Watson
(concentrating) No
Those birds are making too much of a racket
(looking off) They're not just birds -- they're our old friends
Watson and Gabrielle follow his gaze
From the back of the wagon, the carriers have removed the small bird-cage we saw in the mail-drop on Ashdown Street
They hand it to a workman, who starts up the steps with it
To another couple of workmen they pass down an open-sided crate in which rest two heavy glass bottles protected by wicker
Stencilled on the wooden slate of the crate are the words:   - 104
Holmes is watching thoughtfully, Gabrielle and Watson are puzzled
Sulphuric acid
The more we find out the less sense it makes
To a graduate chemist it makes a great deal of sense
Sulphuric acid, when exposed to salt-water, produces chlorine gas
(a beat) Would you mind clasping your hands, Watson
(obeying) Like this
little lower
Thank you
Watson has lowered his clasped hands, and Holmes uses them as a foothold to go scrambling up the scaffolding of the nearby wall
Reaching the top, he looks off in the direction of the tower
The workman carrying the canary cage, and the two carrying the crate of sulphuric acid are approaching the tower
draw-bridge comes down, and the three men cross the moat and enter the tower
(looking off) That tower may be more interesting than thought -- and not just architecturally
Out of the ruined gatehouse comes the guard with the two mastiffs on leashes
The dogs start to snarl viciously
Holmes,  have a feeling we're redundant here
105
Holmes leaps down from the scaffolding, wheels the tandem around, starts back in the direction from which they came
Gabrielle follows
Watson hurries after them with his bicycle, casting anxious glances over his shoulder as the dogs continue barking
: - The sun has just gone down behind the hills, but there is still light in the sky
An ominous mist is beginning to settle on the water
Gabrielle is sitting in the stern of a rowboat, her parasol in her lap
She is wearing Holmes' Norfolk jacket over her dress to ward off the chill
On the rowing seat, facing her, are Watson and Holmes, the latter in his waistcoat
Their oars are pulled in, and they are watching Urquhart Castle, on the opposite side of the lake
We have now observed the castle from the front, from the back, from the side, from land, from water
what now
Are you planning to spend the night out here
If necessary
You're going to catch your death of cold
(to Gabrielle) Wouldn't it be ironic if Holmes' last case were a case of pneumonia
(with an embarrassed chuckle) Sorry
Gabrielle glances past them, and her eyes widen
(pointing off) What's that
Holmes and Watson turn their heads
106
About half a mile away, moving in and out of patches of drifting mist, is Watson's monster, its long reptillian neck cutting through the water
Watson leaps to his feet
Holmes
Holmes grabs his arm, pulls him back into his seat
Quick, Watson
After it
He grabs his oar, and Watson belatedly joins in
They strain at the oars, setting a course which will intercept the monster
Gabrielle leans forward in her seat, trying to peer past them through the curtains of mist
The monster is much closer now -- no more than a quarter of a mile away
Suddenly Watson stops rowing
Holmes, what are we doing
We should be going away from it
Keep rowing, dammit
Watson resumes pulling on his oar
As they row, Holmes looks over his shoulder
The monster has started to submerge
Its head disappears beneath the surface of the water, and the wake it leaves behind soon trails off into the mist
Holmes ships his oar
We've lost it
(stops rowing) At least you admit there's an it, not just a figment of my imagination
Quiet
107
He listens intently
There is only the sound of water slapping against the side of the boat
The mist is heavier now, and billowing around them
(to Watson) Do you have your stethoscope with you
Never without it
He removes his bowler, unwinds the stethoscope from the inside the crown, hands it to Holmes
Holmes plugs in the ear-pieces, leans over the side of the boat, extends the other end of the stethoscope to the surface of the water
What is it
can hear something
We become aware of the faint beating of engines, accompanied by a bubbling sound
It's getting closer -- closer -- Suddenly the surface of the water breaks, about twenty yards away from them, and the head and neck of the monster rear up from the depths
Watson is first to notice it and jumps to his feet, making choking noises
Gabrielle sees it and screams
Watson grabs an oar, throws it at the monster as it comes past
The backwash hits the boat broadside, rocking it, and Holmes, Watson and Gabrielle are spilled into the lake
The monster moves away from them, heading in the general direction of the castle
It disappears into the mist
Holmes is the first to come up, looks around, sees Gabrielle surfacing a few yards away, swims to her
Are you all right
lost my parasol
108
Where's Watson
He glances around, sees Watson's bowler floating nearby, swims over to it
Watson
He lifts the hat -- but Watson isn't under it
As Gabrielle hoists herself into the boat, Watson clambers over the other side
After a moment Holmes joins them, and they sit there, sopping wet and breathing heavily
have come face to   face with man-eating tigers --  was once   caught in a stampede of wild elephants --   India, you know -- but  wasn't half as   frightened
This beast seems to have   a personal grudge against us
just hope it doesn't come back
don't think it will
(pointing off) Look
They glance in the indicated direction
There is no sign of the monster
But the mist has momentarily lifted to reveal the castle, and an odd sight greets their eyes -- the wooden scaffolding in front of the tower is slowly rising into the air
(amazed) What strange goings-on
Not really
My guess is that the monster, after a hard day's work, has returned home for his supper
109
The scaffolding in front of the tower slowly descends back into the place, as mist once more engulfs the castle
: - Holmes, in a different suit   of clothes, is pacing across the room, whistling the main   theme from "Swan Lake
" He stops before the open French   window, gazes out toward the lake
Gabrielle is propped    up in bed, a blanket drawn up to her chin, watching him
Watson, who has changed into a pair of kilts, is standing   in front of the fireplace, warming his backside
Gabrielle glances at Watson, suppresses a giggle
Yes,  know
But would you believe that you can't borrow a decent pair of trousers in this place
Holmes resumes pacing, and Watson becomes aware of his whistling
Would you like to confide in us
No answer from Holmes
Watson turns to Gabrielle
Whenever he starts whistling,  know he's getting close to a solution
It's nothing new, actually
We've come across this situation before
We have
Where
At the ballet
Ballet
110
There's a lake -- and there's a castle -- and there's a swan that isn't really a swan -- or, in this case, a monster that isn't really a monster -- Then what is it
What is it indeed that feeds on canary birds and sulphuric acid, and has an engine for a heart
An engine
The stethoscope is a very sensitive instrument, and water is an excellent conductor of sound
There is no doubt that what we are dealing with is a mechanical monster
Oh
Not only is it equipped with an artificial heart, it also has artificial lungs
Judging from the bubbles on the surface of the lake, it uses some form of air pump
You think my husband was involved in all this
Yes, Madame Valladon
'm sure of it
But why would anybody build a mechanical monster
Just to scare people
Not very likely
111
Why did they try to keep me from finding my husband
And why was he buried anonymously
think  have a pretty good notion of what they're up to -- the Society for the Preservation of Scottish Monuments -- better known as the Diogenes Club
The Diogenes Club
There is a knock on the door
Come in
The door opens and the hotel manager enters, holding a magnum of champagne
Mr
Ashdown,  have a bottle of champagne for you
(crossing to him) bottle of champagne
didn't order it
No, indeed
You are to deliver it
These are my instructions
He hands the magnum to Holmes
Instructions from whom
Deliver it where
wouldn't know, sir
But there's a carriage waiting for you downstairs
Are you sure you have the right Mr
Ashdown
112
(flatly) Quite sure, Mr
Holmes
He turns and exits
Holmes taps the bottle of champagne thoughtfully
Well, Watson,  would say the curtain is going up on the last act
don't like the sound of it
Please be careful
As Holmes starts toward the door, Watson reaches into his sporran
You'd better take this with you
He produces a revolver, holds it out to Holmes
Holmes ignores it, exits
- gig is waiting in front of the entrance, and leaning against it is the guide we saw earlier at Urquhart
Holmes comes out, carrying the champagne bottle
Who's minding the castle
You'd better get on
It's late
Holmes climbs into the gig, and the guide moutns the seat beside him
Where are we going
Some sort of party
You won't be disappointed in the guest list
113
Who's the host
Jonah
He flicks the reins
The horse starts off at a trot, and the gig turns into the driveway
- As they drive along, Holmes glances at the guide, who is grim and uncommunicative
: - The gig, with its two passengers, proceeds along the lakeshore, approaching the entrance to Urquhart
- workman is lighting a couple of torches attached to the ruined gatehouse when the gig comes through the archway
The guide reins up the horse in front of the steps leading to the inner courtyard -- which are now covered with a narrow red carpet
The guide nods to Holmes, who dismounts, starts up the steps, examining the red carpet
As he reaches the top, he looks off
The strip of red carpet runs across the courtyard, lit by torches planted in the ground
couple of workmen are are unrolling the rest of the carpet toward the entrance of the tower
As Holmes passes one of the tents, the flap opens and Mycroft steps out, dressed in his inevitable frock coat
Mr
Ashdown,  presume
(turning) The red runner,  presume
114
(indicates carpet) You shouldn't have gone to all this trouble just for me
It's not for you
(calling into tent) McKeller
(to Holmes) May  have the champagne, please
(handing him bottle) 1886 -- not a very good vintage, is it
Mediocre
But then again, it's not for drinking
black-suited  emerges from the ten, and Mycroft gives him the champagne
Tie it up, will you
The man moves off toward the tower
Mycroft pulls back the flap of the tent
In here
Holmes passes inside, Mycroft following
- It is lit by a kerosene lamp suspended from the ridge- pole
There are several cots, one of them with the bedding rolled up
Resting on the stripped cot is a trunk with the name
painted on it
Lying on a table, among a group of engineering models, are Gabrielle's parasol and Watson's stethoscope
There are also a couple of drafting tables, with plans and blueprints tacked to them
Holmes moves around the tent, taking all this in
Interesting -- and educational
115
Despite my most emphatic warning, you persisted in meddling
It would have served you right if you'd all drowned
Sorry to be so unobliging
(stops beside torch) Valladon
'mm
(indicating parasol   and stethoscope) imagine this belongs to    the pretty lady, and this belongs to    your valet
We found them floating in    the lake
Speaking about things floating in the lake -- How much do you know -- or think you know
think you're testing some sort of underwater craft -- camouflauged to mislead the gullible
think it's an experimental model, operated by a crew of midgets
think it is powered by sulphuric acid batteries, and uses canaries to detect escaping gas
Altogether a strange contraption
Not quite that unique
Right now, four countries are trying to develop what we call a submersible
But none of them could solve the critical problem -- how to stay submerged long enough to make it effective
What does the Good Book say
"And Jonah lived in the belly of that fish for three days and three nights
" 116
That was our goal
And thanks to Valladon's air-pump, we got a jump on the rest of them
It's a highly complex system of filtration -- so we had a series of trials -- And at least one error
During a test run in Moray Firth, pressure caused a leak in the hull
Sea water mixed with the acid in the batteries to produce chlorine gas
Before they could reach the surface, Valladon and the crew were dead
So you had them buried in unmarked graves, to preserve your secret
It was essential to keep the information from your client
You went to all those lengths to prevent Madame Valladon from fiding her husband
Your client isn't Madame Valladon -- it's the Imperial German Government
They were after the Belgian engineer -- or rather, his invention
They knew he was employed by us, but they couldn't find out where -- so they enlisted the best brain in England to help them
You, my dear brother, have been working for the Wilhelmstrasse
And Madame Valladon -- what part did she play in all this
Madame Valladon is dead
Dead
117
Mycroft crosses to the trunk, opens the lid
The Germans disposed of her three weeks ago, in Brussels
This is Gabrielle Valladon
He hands Holmes a small, framed photograph
Holmes looks at it with apprehension, as well he should: the picture is of a somewhat matronly woman, not the glamorous Gabrielle
Holmes lowers  the photograph
Behind it, Mycroft is glaring at him with customary arrogance
The woman who was brought to your house in the middle of the night -- apparently fished out of the Thames -- and apparently suffering from amnesia -- is, in fact, Ilse von Hoffmanstal, one of their most skillful agents
Am  going too fast for one of the "best brains in England
" Go on
As Mycroft continues, Holmes picks up Ilse's water-soaked parasol and examines it
They planted her on you quite neatly, must admit, so that you could lead them to their objective, the air pump
Very much like using a hog to find truffles
And now perhaps you'd care to join me am expecting a certain royal personage from Balmoral
- coach and escort approach the castle
Painted on the door of the coach are the initials "
" The entourage enters the castle courtyard and stops
Footmen open the door and bow to the lone passenger
118
Waiting on top of the steps, outside the tent, are Mycroft and Holmes
Lined up on the other side of the torch-lit red carpet are half a dozen scientists, in their best clothes
Out of the coach steps a familiar figure -- Her Majesty, , Defender of the Faith, Empress of India
She is 69 years old, and dressed entirely in black
Mycroft comes down the carpeted steps to meet her
Your Majesty
He bows
The Queen extends her hand to him, and he touches it
trust you had a pleasant journey, Ma'am
It was long and it was tedious
And it had better be worth our while, Mr
Holmes
can assure you, Ma'am, it will be
lady-in-waiting and a uniformed equerry have now descended from the coach
Mycroft leads the party up the steps
Now what is this curious ship we are supposed to christen
We call it a submersible, Ma'am
It travels under water
Under water
What a fantastic idea
They have now reached the top of the steps
119
Ma'am, may present some of the scientists who were responsible for this achievement
Ferguson, naval architect -- (bowing) Your Majesty
Professor Simpson, our leading expert on hydraulics -- (bowing) Your Majesty
Prescott, co-inventor of the revolving periscope -- (bowing) Your Majesty
And this is Sir Arthur Grisby, our authority on maritime ballistics -- We don't claim to understand any of this
But England is proud of you, gentlemen
To think that man can now observe fish in their native habitat -- (trying to correct her) Well, not exactly, Ma'am -- -- and underwater plants and coral reefs -- (noticing Holmes) Young man -- what was your contribution to this project
'm afraid it was rather negligible, Your Majesty
120
(to the Queen) This is my brother, Sherlock, Ma'am
Ah, yes
Sherlock Holmes
We have been following your exploits with great interest
Holmes bows, touches the Queen's extended hand
Thank you, Ma'am
Are you engaged in one of your fascinating cases at the moment
In a manner of speaking, Ma'am
When can we expect to read Dr
Watson's account of the case
hope never, Ma'am
It has not been one of my more successful endeavors
Mycroft signals to a bagpiper, who starts playing ' Ah, the ceremonies are about to begin
(to Mycroft) Now where is this underwater ship of yours
(pointing to tower) In the dungeon, Ma'am
The dungeon
What a peculiar place to keep it
(turning to the others) Well, let us get on with it, gentlemen
121
Mycroft leads the Queen along the red runner toward the tower
Holmes follows, then the lady-in-waiting and the equerry, then the scientists
As they cross the inner courtyard, the Highland piper falls in ahead of the procession, leads them toward the drawbridge
Then he steps aside,  as the royal party crosses the drawbridge and passes through the door of the tower
- high-ceilinged rock chamber, with a spiral iron staircase leading down
The floor is a concrete ramp, the lower end of it covered with water
Beyond is the entrance from the Loch, camouflaged by scaffolding and vegetation
On the upper part of the ramp is a small, primitive submarine, resting on wheels
Prominently lettered on the bow is the name
, and suspended by a rope from the prow is the magnum of champagne which Holmes delivered
Along the sides are torpedo tubes, and fitted over the conning tower is the head and neck of the "monster" we saw in the lake
Present are half a dozen naval personnel, commanded by an officer
As the royal party comes down the spiral staircase, the officer snaps to attention
Mycroft is in the lead, followed by the Queen, Holmes, the lady-in- waiting, the equerry and the scientists
There she, Ma'am
Her Majesty's Ship Jonah
The four surviving midgets appear on the deck, in wool jerseys and navy caps
They start pulling on a chain which slowly raises the detachable head-and-neck of the monster toward the ceiling, disclosing the conning tower and the periscope
And what, may we ask, is the purpose of that hideous gargoyle
It's merely a decoy, Ma'am
122
Oh
To frighten away the sharks, we imagine
Something of the sort
The crew will now demonstrate the workings of the submersible
of normal height appears on the deck of the sub
Stand to
The midgets scramble down the hatch
Aren't they rather small for sailors
They are
But because of the size of the craft, the Navy made an exception
They should make it a rule
It's quite fatiguing to pin on all those medals while standing on our toes
There is the sound of the engines starting
Mycroft leads the Queen to an open bulkhead in the side of the sub, with Holmes and rest of the party close behind
Inside, all is noise and confusion
Metal rods are dipping into glass jars of sulphuric acid, complicated machinery is driving the propeller shaft, bellows are inflating and deflating, etc
The midgets are at their stations in the cramped quarters, pulling switches, oiling the engines, operating the periscope
Overhead is a cageful of canaries, all chirping away
Mycroft points out the various features to the Queen
This is the main engine, which propels it under water at the rate of two knots -- the stabilizing mechanism -- the multi- stage compressor -- the ballast tank trimmer -- the air-pump which filters and recirculates the air -- 123
How charming
The air pump, Ma'am
(pointing) The canaries
Must make the crew feel at home
Yes, Ma'am
These are the levers for firing the torpedoes, which are accurate up to as much as 120 feet -- the periscope for scanning the surface of the water -- But where is the glass bottom
The what, Ma'am
The glass bottom
You know -- to see the fist -- -- and the plants and the corals -- That's not quite the idea, Ma'am
Jonah is being commissioned as a warship
warship
(waving her hand) Stop that noise
Stop it
At a signal from Mycroft, the sub engines are turned off
Ma'am, if  may explain -- You had better
124
The Admiralty regards this craft as the ultimate weapon in naval warfare
It can seek out enemy ships and destroy them -- with these torpedoes -- while remaining completely invisible
You mean in can fire at other vessels while under water
Yes, Ma'am
Without any warning
That is correct, Ma'am
And without showing her colors
Indeed, Ma'am
Mr
Holmes, we are not amused
(Mycroft stares at her) It is unsportsmanlike, it is un-English, and it is in very poor taste
We will have none of it
beg your pardon, Ma'am
He exchanges a look with Holmes
Sometimes we despair of the state of the world
What will scientists think of next
That's precisely it, Ma'am
At this very moment the Germans under Count von Zeppelin, are experimenting with a dirigible -- 125
dirigible
And what, pray, is that
rigid balloon, which could fly over London and drop a bomb on Buckingham Palace
It is being developed at the express orders of Kaiser Wilhelm the Second
Nonsense
We refuse to believe that our grandson Willie would do a thing like that
We have conclusive proof, Ma'am
Our agent in Friedrichshafen, a man named Ibbetson, actually saw the dirigible, and made a drawing of it
Unfortunately, he was apprehended before he could cross the border
(indicating sub) Nevertheless, we don't want any part of this beastly invention
Get rid of it
Scuttle it
The sooner the better
May  point out, Ma'am -- And don't concern yourself about that dirigible dropping bombs on us
We shall write a very sharp note to the Kaiser
(to equerry) Now we wish to return to Balmoral
She starts toward the spiral staircase
The equerry precedes her up the stairs, the lady-in-waiting follows, the scientists trail after them
Mycroft and Holmes linger behind
Well, Mycroft, it seems we have both been undone by a woman
(Mycroft is staring at the sub) What a shame
126
All that superb engineering, and all that cunning espionage, for nought
Not necessarily
If the Germans want that submersible so badly, why don't we give it to them
Give it to them
Invite them aboard for the final journey -- seven hundred feet -- straight down
And how are you going to arrange that
'm rather counting on you to do it
Since you are on such intimate terms with Fraulein von Hoffmanstal
s
, the bagpiper resumes playing
Shall we say goodbye to Her Majesty
He starts up the spiral staircase
Holmes follows slowly and thoughtfully
: - The gig, with the quide driving and Holmes beside him, comes up the driveway, stops in front of the entrance
Holmes hops down, and twirling Gabrielle's parasol in his hand, walks into the hotel
- In the half-light, Gabrielle can be seen asleep in her bed
She is wearing the pink negligee with the maribou feathers, which has slipped halfway off her shoulders
The other bed has not been slept in
The door from the corridor opens and Holmes steps in, carrying the parasol
127
He crosses to Gabrielle's bed, looks down at her for a long moment, adjusts the negligee with the tip of the parasol
The he moves to the French window, opens it, glances out
-  '  - The seven Trappist monks are standing on the shore, silhouetted against the water, watching the hotel
- Holmes withdraws from the window , looks at the sleeping Gabrielle, then casually swings the parasol, hitting a metal lamp-shade overhead
Gabrielle sits up abruptly in bed, clutching her negligee around her
Sorry about that
But as long as you're up -- what is the German word for castle
Schloss, isn't it
(carefully) think so
And how would you say under the castle
Unter das Schlss
Or die Schloss
don't know
My German isn't that good
(indicating) Your Trappist friends are out there waiting to hear from you -- it's a chilly morning -- we don't want to keep them standing around too long, do we, Fraulein Hoffmanstal
(Gabrielle looks at him without answering) Come now
It's too late to play cat and mouse
(flatly) Unter dem Schloss
128
Thank you
(holding out parasol) Here's your signalling device -- it's a bit damp, 'm afraid -- would you care to let them know where they can find the submersible
(Gabrielle makes no move to take the parasol) No
Then 'll just have to do it myself
(moving toward window) only hope my Morse code is adequate to the occasion
Keeping well to one side of the open window, he extends the parasol outside, opens it, starts sending out a series of long and short signals
- von Tirpitz and the other monks strain their eyes in the direction of the hotel
-  '  - Outside the hotel window, Gabrielle's parasol can be seen flashing the message    in Morse code -- but it is not apparent that Holmes is doing the signalling
- As Holmes continues opening and closing the parasol, Gabrielle gets out of bed, comes up beside him
Holmes finishes the message, shuts the parasol, draws it back into the room
Then he looks out the window
-  '  - The monks turn away from the hotel, and with von Tirpitz in the lead, move off along the shore
- Holmes steps back from the window, faces Gabrielle
129
Well, it's up to the good monks now
You can consider your part of the mission accomplished, Fraulein Hoffmanstal
You're all wrong about me
My name isn't Hoffmanstal
It isn't
It's von Hoffmanstal
stand corrected
(glancing toward window) suppose once they're in the castle
It must amuse you, Mr
Holmes, Trappists walking into a trap
It's more amusing than that
Once in the castle, they will encounter surprisingly little resistance -- it will take but a small bottle of chloroform to overcome the guards
(skeptically) You mean you're going to let them have the air-pump
Better than that
We're going to let them have the submersible
They will find it with its engines running, all set to go
assume they're all expert sailors
And since there is a German battleship cruising off the coast of Scotland,  expect they'll try to sail it out of the lock and rendezvous at sea
Did you say try to
130
would suggest you get your things together
Mycroft will be here to take you into custody
He opens her suitcase, which is on the baggage rack at the foot of the bed
Gabrielle watches him for a beat, then crosses to the wardrobe, starts taking her clothes out
never had you fooled for a moment, did You knew right from the beginning -- when the cabbie brought me to Baker Street
Let me see -- not quite that soon
He stretches out on the bed
It's so funny
asked for this assignment, you know
was scheduled to go to Japan, but  couldn't resist the challenge of coming up against the best
'm sorry  didn't give you a closer game
Close enough
You're just being kind
failed miserably
We all have occasional failures
Fortunately, Dr
Watson never writes about mine
: - Watson, back in his valet's outfit again, comes bounding down the narrow stairs from the attic, races toward the door of Holmes' room
131
Holmes
Holmes
- Bright sunlight now floods the room
Gabrielle, fully dressed, is standing in front of the  mirror, putting on her hat
Her packed bag has been set   out in the middle of the room, and resting on it is the  parasol
The door bursts open and Watson dashes in
Holmes
In his haste he trips over the bag, goes down
As he picks himself up again, Gabrielle points toward the balcony
-  - Holmes is leaning against the parapet, scanning the lake through his telescope
Watson appears through the open French window behind him
(excitedly) Holmes,  saw it again -- that thing -- it came from the castle -- it's out there -- -   - trial of bubbles is moving along the surface
Suddenly there is a muffled explosion from below, and a geyser of water shoots up into the air
-  - Holmes slowly lowers the telescope
It was out there
Now it's gone
Gone
132
Forever
Look for yourself
-   - There is a great turbulence in the water
Up to the surface pops the bottle of christening champagne, with rope and ribbons still attached
Then a copy of the Bible pops up
-  - bottle of champagne
and a Bible
That's all that's left of
Jonah
He steps through the window as a puzzled Watson lowers the telescope
- Watson follows Holmes in from the balcony
It would seem that somebody carelessly loosened the bolts of the submersible
What a fitting end for Trappists -- now they are resting in eternal silence at the bottom of the lake
(to Gabrielle) Do you know what he's talking about
Through the open doorway comes Mycroft
In the corridor behind him is one of his aides
Fraulein von Hoffmanstal
Yes, Mr
Holmes
'm all ready
133
If there's one thing  like about the Prussians, it's their punctuality
If there's one thing  dislike about the British, it's their climate understand your jails are quite damp -- and your heating facilities totally inadequate
They are
But you're not going to jail
You're going back to Germany
Germany
You will be conducted to the Swiss-German border, and be exchanged for one of our agents -- a man named Ibbetson
Thank you
Don't thank me
Thank my brother
It was his idea
Gabrielle looks at Holmes, but he avoids her eyes
(to Gabrielle) Frankly,  think we are making a very poor deal
You much better than most operatives working for British intelligence
(turning to Holmes) Don't you agree, Sherlock
(with a small but gallant bow to Gabrielle) And better than some consulting detectives
Mycroft signals to his aide, who comes in from the corridor and picks up Gabrielle's bag
134
(to Gabrielle) Shall we
(reaching for parasol) 'll take that
(to Holmes and Watson) Gentlemen
She turns and walks out the door, Mycroft following
Watson's bewilderment has now reached monumental proportions
(folding his arms) All right, Holmes -- you don't have to explain anything to me, if you don't want to
appreciate that, Watson
After all, 'm only your official biographer -- Anyway,  don't think she'd care to have this story spread all over Strand Magazine
The public has a right to know these things
If she's a German spy, why should we concern ourselves about her feelings
Holmes crosses to a small window overlooking the courtyard of the hotel, opens it, looks out
- Mycroft's aide comes out of the hotel with Gabrielle's suitcase, loads it into an open carriage waiting in front of the entrance
Gabrielle emerges, carrying her parasol, and accompanied by Mycroft
He helps her into the carriage, gets in beside her
135
The aide joins the coachman, and the carriage drives off
Gabrielle does not look back toward the hotel
-  - Holmes is framed in the open window, watching the carriage
Watson comes up behind him
If  promised not to write a word about it, would you enlighten me
As your friend -- as your valet -- Quiet
'm trying to read a personal message
message
- The carriage is moving away from the hotel
Gabrielle has her parasol over her shoulder, and it opens and closes, opens and closes
-    - She continues to signal with the parasol, unnoticed by Mycroft
-  - Watson is straining forward to see out the window
What is she saying
(slowly) Auf Wiedersehn
Auf Weider---
The nerve
136
- The carriage disappears down an avenue of trees, Gabrielle's parasol still flashing its message
: - There is snow on the ground, and drifts of it piled up along the curbs
Traffic is light
Householders are shovelling the snow off the sidewalks, and pedestrians are hurrying along bundled up against the cold
- 221B   - Holmes, in his dressing gown, and Watson, in his smoking jacket, are at the breakfast table
There is snow on the window-sills, and a cozy fire is burning in the grate
Watson is reading the morning paper
Holmes is sorting through his mail
(holding up envelope) 'mmm
letter from the Diogenes Club
Maybe Mycroft is putting you up for membership
If only to have the distinct pleasure of blackballing his brother
He has slit open the envelope
Watson watches him curiously as he reads the letter, but Holmes' face remains expressionless
Slowly he puts down the letter, rises, crosses to the window, stands there staring out into the wintry street
Aren't you going to finish your breakfast
Holmes doesn't answer
Watson takes a lump of sugar out of the bowl with a pair of tongs, drops it into his coffee
137
Then glancing over his shoulder to make sure Holmes isn't watching, he swivels the letter around with the tongs
It is written on Diogenes Club stationery, and reads: 9th December, 1888 Dear Sherlock, My sources in Tokyo inform me that Ilse von Hoffmanstal was arrested last week by the Japanese counter-intelligence service for spying on naval installations in Yokohama harbour
After a secret trial, she was summarily executed by a firing squad
It might interest you to know that The page ends at this point
Watson turns the sheet of paper over with the tongs
The letter continues on the other side
she had been living in Japan these past few months under the name of Mrs
Ashdown
Sincerely, Mycroft Watson looks toward Holmes, who is still standing with his back to the room, gets up from the table
Holmes -- 'm terribly sorry about this
(quietly, without turning) Where is it, Watson
(after a beat) In the files
May to July, 1885
Holmes turns to the bookshelves above the desk
From a row of similar volumes, he slides out the three  files marked , , and  1885
Actually, it's   the medical bag, standing on end, with the spines of  three volumes pasted on the bottom
You're getting better
138
He sets the bag down on the desk, opens it, takes out a bottle of cocaine
Watson watches him with compassion as he crosses to his bedroom with his cocaine, goes in, shuts the door
Footsteps are heard hurrying up the stairs, and after a moment there is a knock on the door
Watson approaches the door, opens it to reveal   -- a short, nervous man whose features are sharper than his mind
He is wearing an overcoat, his bowler is in his hands, and his fingers are drumming on the crown
Good morning, Watson
(stepping in) Just happened to be in the neighborhood, and  thought -- What is it this time, Inspector Lestrade
We've had three rather nasty murders in Whitechapel
All ladies of  easy virtue
You may read something about it -- the newspapers are referring to the killer as Jack the Ripper
Yes,  think  have
Some of us at Scotland Yard were wondering if perhaps Mr
Holmes would be willing to -- (a glance toward the bedroom) 'm sorry, Lestrade
But at the moment, Holmes is working on another problem
(trying to hide his disappointment) Oh
Well,  just thought it was the kind of case that might interest him dare say we can solve it without his help
139
Oh, 'm sure you will
From Holmes' bedroom comes the sound of a melancholy tune being played on the violin
Watson starts to ease Lestrade out of the door
Good day, Lestrade
He shuts the door after him, listens to the sound of the violin for a moment
Then he crosses to the wicker chair, seats himself
He takes some sheets of paper out of the rack and places them on the writing arm, dips his pen in the inkwell, starts to write
The violin music continues  , infinitely romantic, infinitely sad
