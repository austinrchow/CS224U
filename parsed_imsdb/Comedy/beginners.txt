Nice
Oh, that's nice

Hal takes the flashlight from Oliver and guides it to the flowers
Oh, Andy brought those for you
Oh, yeah
Hal continues to direct the light across the room, we follow the circle of light as it moves a cross a wall landing on a painting
Oh, who did that painting
Well,  don't know
Its just a painting on the wall
Hal continues exploring, Oliver's enjoying his father's curiosity, he lands on some photos displayed on the table
--, and these
They're just photos, Pop
But how do they relate to the exhibit
They're just personal photos
They're not art
Hal slowly moves the flashlight up the wall, across the ceiling to a strange assortment of fire detectors, sprinklers, sensors, all laid out against the acoustic tile ceiling
Hal points up
Oliver looks for a beat, then
Uh, well that's the water sprinkler thing
Well, its beautiful
What is
Putting the Japanese gardens there
It's just beautiful

: Oliver get's to his real work, pulling out a few 8X10 photos of a band "The Sads"
There are some instructions on record company letterhead - he is to do an album design for their new record - they want him to draw portraits of the three members
Oliver begins to do quick portraits of them based on the photo
() 10/29/07 13
: Jesus, Liz
Another band that wants portraits
Well, at least it pays the rent
You do something decent once, and that's all people ever want
through the different portraits developing
It's not what Oliver want's to do
'  - Elliott and Shauna let themselves in
Elliot grabs a stool and sits down
Hi Liz
Oliver continues to draw, as Shauna and Elliott try to get his attention
Oliver
Yeah
The pen is not your friend
The paper is not your friend
The party is your friend
We're your friends
Your friends are your friends

' Oliver, Elliott, and Shauna are leaving
Arthur can't believe he's being left behind
It's actually the first time they will separate
Arthur, you haven't been invited to this party
You're gonna stay and look after the house
Oliver tentatively shuts the door, takes three steps, Arthur begins to howl
Oliver tries to ignore it, but stops again
He looks back at the house and the howling
: '  - Arthur, victorious, sits in Elliot's lap in the front seat, while Oliver drives and Shauna is squeezed in back in her chicken outfit
You remember when Oliver was funny
And he could actually, like, talk, in complete sentences
Funny
Funny
don't think so Fun maybe, but not funny unless, like, serious is funny
Then he's' fucking hilarious
Elliot and Oliver laugh
But, lovable
You are very lovable
Yeah, very lovable

woman rushes up to Oliver, surprised to see he has a dog
So cute, does he do tricks

: His name's Arthur - he doesn't do tricks
In the background are a couple dressed as  and , we see them observe Oliver and Arthur
No
Arthur,
Arthur promptly sits down
Oliver's totally surprised
He's so cute
Shake
Arthur sticks out his paw
Oliver doesn't like seeing Arthur blindly perform
Oh my god, he's so cute,  want him
(in Freud accent) Does it make you feel powerful to order my dog around
Maybe give you a sense of power
Oh, you're being a therapist
Freud
Thanks, yeah
Very good
Oliver picks up Arthur and escapes the kitchen
The Rosenberg's are still watching
Oliver and Arthur sit in a chair next to a couch where a man dressed as a witch, complete with green face and long black hair, is lying back as if in a traditional analysis session
- Well,  didn't ask for this
Who would ask for this
This color
This nose
This cheek, this chin
You know, this is my life
This isn't a story
This isn't a joke
Oliver is playing along, but he's really not emotionally ready for this party
He feels very far away
Yeah

: - 'm so glad you came, Doc
Just really good to get this stuff off my chest
(in Freud accent) 'm sorry
Our time is up, uh
for this week
Thank you for coming in
The witch moves on
Oliver sits with Arthur in his lap, alone, lost in all this joviality
We see that the woman dressed as Julius Rosenberg is watching him
Just as Oliver is about to get up, she plops herself down onto the couch, ready for her session
Oh,  was just-  was gonna take a break, actually
She pulls out a writing pad, oblivious
Oliver can tell she's not going to give it up
(back in accent) Well,  guess we should start with your mother
The woman writes on her notepad and shows it to Oliver: "Never had one
" Well then your father
She mimes shooting herself in the head and dying
don't understand
You can't talk
Is it a mental problem
Do you need analysis
She writes on her pad: " have laryngitis" That's a physical problem
She smiles at him, looks at him a little too long, Oliver is more and more pulled in by her playfulness - she writes: "Why are you at a party if you're sad
" on Oliver, surprised and impressed by her observation
() 10/29/07 17
: was doing such a good job of hiding it
How could you tell
Ethel holds up her notebook
She has drawn
Oliver's taken by her
Clearly, 'm gonna need a drink
You
She smiles and nods
You, stay here, yeah
Oliver moves to-- Elliot and Shauna are deeply engaged in conversation with someone dressed as a pickle and someone dressed as much less colorful chicken
No, its just not a natural color for a chicken
No
(motioning to Shauna's ) And look, you see what happens when you free yourself from the cage, walk away from the factory
You just have no real color
' -- Oliver slips past, hands Arthur to Elliot
He scoops ice from the bucket and starts filling two cups
Hey, hey
( ) Uh-oh, one
Uh-oh, two
Two drinks
What does that me--, one, two

Hal is by far the oldest, and most excited, man there
() 10/29/07 19
: (
) They had wonderfully loud music
In- sit, in-sit, in-sit
What kind of music is that
(
) Probably house music
'  - Hal gets a pad and pen to write this down
"House music

Hal is on the side, dancing by himself, hands in the air twinkling his fingers
(
) So did you meet anyone
At the packed bar, Hal drinks alone
(
) Young gay men don't go for older gay men
' Back to Oliver in bed, on the phone
(
) You have it easy
- Oliver snaps out of his memory
He makes his way through the crowd and delivers the drink to her
He looks at her a little too intensely, then blurts out
Would you like to dance
She happily nods yes
They walk to the dance floor, we think Oliver's going to be shy, but he breaks into a kinetic, angular, dance
She's surprised with us - she laughs, they have a good time
() 10/29/07 20
: : Oliver, "Julius", Elliott and Shauna are talking to a magician
"Julius" picks a card, the magician mixes it into the full deck, pops a card into the air, it is hers
Shauna and Elliott can see that Oliver's coming alive
They dance again, now they're sweaty, the dance floor's packed - it's the pinnacle of the party
- The party's winnowing down in the background - "Julius" and Oliver look at each other in the mirror for a beat, and then simultaneously take their wigs off, revealing their true selves
Hello
Shes mouths a silent "hi"
Can  give you my number
She pulls out her pad and pen and hands them to him
Thanks
As he writes, Oliver spies Arthur sitting in the corner of the bathroom, staring directly at him
Tell her the darkness is about to drown us unless something drastic happens right now
Oliver looks to her
feel bad dragging Arthur to the party
should get home
It was really nice meeting you
She writes on her pad: "Au Revoir" () Au revoir
Yeah
He leaves

His phone rings
Hello

They smile at each other, but don't say anything
They get into his car
Okay
You point - 'll drive
Oliver starts the engine
She points forward and they head off
At the light she points left, he follows
Down the street she points right
This way

Oliver drives up on the sidewalk before the street, heads down it for half a block, then takes her right
We can hear them laughing

Oliver is impressed
She mime's giving him a tour but still doesn't talk

They look at each other nervously
Nice place
They sit on her bed
She steals his pipe, put's it in her mouth -- writes on her pad and shows it to him
(') Oh, my mother
My mother died five years ago
(in a hoarse whisper) Oh merd
Oh, you spoke
( ) 'm not supposed to
She writes and present him with a new question
My father died two months ago, almost three
She looks at him with sincere empathy and surprise
Oliver's opened up, an now everything gushes out, he barely knows what he's saying
(') He, he was gay
She's very surprised
(') He was gay the whole time they were married
() () 10/29/07 23
: (') He came out after my mother died and, uh
he was 75 years old
There's a quiet moment of deep connection
(') Sorry
She mouths "No" (don't say sorry)
She reaches out and gently runs a finger across Oliver's brow and the outline of his face, he's so vulnerable, she lovingly/mischievously squishes his face together and messes up his hair
Then she leans in, and they kiss for the first time - delicately
() Can we just sleep
(') Sure, sure
They lay down, she takes his arm and pulls him into spooning her
He pulls the covers over them
- Oliver wakes, still in his clothes
is already up
She waves and Oliver smiles
Anna holds up her notebook: "Who are you

She pantomimes a camera rolling, and herself acting
You're filming here
Acting

And after
She makes a casual tossing motion with her hand
Just somewhere else
Where
Anna only shrugs
She writes more, and tosses the notepad on his lap
Oliver reads: "Can  see you again
" He's very happy
Yes
They walk down the long hallway, Oliver carries her bags, Anna holds onto Arthur's leash
Oliver reaches out and holds her hand
They stop and kiss - gentle and comfortable with each other

Hello house, (Low voice) hello Oliver
'   - Oliver makes two piles of mail, one says Oliver Fields, one has a yellow forwarding sticker that says Hal Fields
The Hal Fields pile is much bigger
Jesus, Pop, you get so much mail
Oliver slows and stares at his father's magazine - The Advocate
Two attractive, shirtless men on the cover under the title: America's Sweethearts
Oliver's lost in memory
(
) Hal, its remarkable how well you've recovered from being on the ventilator
' Hal sit's on top of his hospital bed, wearing one of his all black outfits, looking much healthier
doctor sits on his bed, Oliver listens from the side
But
The bronchoscopy revealed a mass about the size of a quarter
It is located in your lower right lung
on Hal taking this in
(') 'm afraid the biopsy showed it's cancerous
Uh-huh
see
It appears to have spread
to the large hilar lymph nodes in your chest and liver

: (cont'd) With the already weakened state of your heart and lungs

Long talks about treatments, Oliver drifts back from the conversation, slowly retreating to a window in the far corner, as we continue to hear Dr
Long speak, we see Oliver's thoughts, fixating on "a mass about the size of a " : (
) (') Surgery isn't possible given its location
We can start radiation treatments and see if you're strong enough for Chemo
You will be able to go home

We cut back to Hal's face, stoically digesting the news
Do you have any questions
No
Thank you
As the doctor leaves
Oliver takes his father's hand
'm sorry
Well, let's not rush out and tell everyone
Andy
No need to get him up a tree
Hal takes a moment and composes himself
In his eyes we can see that he knows there is an end to his life
(') Can you read me something
() 10/29/07 27
: Hal hands Oliver his Advocate magazine, he begins to read from "Tough Guys Do Dance
" The Brazilian ballet star is already known not only as a skilled partner, but also as a gifted and versatile dancer, who adeptly fields roles ranging
Camera tracks out of the room, leaving the two men alone
'  - : We see Oliver's hands as he draws a series of silhouetted figures hanging from trees, others happily beheaded, all with talking bubbles that say, "Let's not rush out and tell everyone" : Oliver draws another severed head, then a woman smoking next to the words, "First lung cancer
" : Oliver tacks his drawings to the wall, looks at them
He looks down and pets Arthur, as we hear
Yeah, he's fine
He sleeps on your bed
But is he eating
' Hal sits on his bed fully dressed, Oliver is visiting
Yeah, yeah, he's eating
Oh God,  worry so much about-- As Andy enters, his hands mysteriously cupped together
Oh here we are
Andy shows Hal his cupped hands

: (') What have you got in there
slug
Oh, Andy, you can't bring that kind of thing in here
Oh  can look
Andy flashes open his hands, revealing nothing
He snorts and laughs
Fuck you
Oliver watches with amusement
enters
It's time for inspection
The nurse works her way between Andy and Hal to take his pulse
Hello, Mr
Fields
Hello
Andy feels interrupted, strangely hurt by the nurse
The nurse begins to take Hal's vital signs
'm Andy
Hal's boyfriend 'm Sophia
Andy gets more and more upset
You know,  have the right to be here as much as anyone else
Hal lovingly cuts him off, trying to ease the tension
Go take a walk
Calm yourself
Andy walks out, feeling embarrassed and rejected
() 10/29/07 29
: What was all that
Oh, Andy hasn't had it easy
Be nice to him
To everyone's surprise, Andy storms back in with a bouquet of flowers, dumps them on Hal's chest, kisses him triumphantly and leaves again
(knowing he stole them) Andy, where did you get these
: Oliver helps a group of Hal's gay friends and Andy get settled
They're jovial, they come with drinks and flowers, the room gets very full
Oliver hands out cups, offers wine, Andy lifts his paper cup and makes a toast
Guys, guys, this is to us
Cheers

Drinking's not allowed in the room
All the guys freeze
Oh, it's not
She shakes her head no, the party stops, she leaves
Oliver instinctively polite, starts packing up their cups
'm sorry
Moans and complaints from the group
No, no, no
She's a wonderful nurse
(he pauses a beat, then raises his cup again) Here's to health care
Hal swigs back his wine
They all laugh, grab their cups and toast
To health care
Hal looks happy, Oliver smiles but can't believe his dad
() 10/29/07 30
: What did you do with my father
He was so polite
Oh,  invited him - but he never returns my calls
The guys drink merrily
Someone shoves a cup into Oliver's hand, pours him a drink

Oliver picks up a stack of magazines as Elliott interrogates him
Two, four, six, eight
That's it

When you feel bad, you go into a room and scream - loud as you want, for a minute or two, then it's out of you
It's called catharsis
She opens the door, pushes him inside, and closes the door
'   - Young Oliver pauses, confused in his room
He doesn't scream
- He comes back out
Sheepish
don't feel like screaming
Georgia, never ruffled
You will
- Oliver and Arthur watch from the car as Elliott gets a can of spray paint, heads to a blank wall across the street and sprays a large tag on a wall
He then runs back to the car, looks proudly at his work
() 10/29/07 33
: What the fuck is that
--, Elliot Well, that's ridiculous
know
(Getting his criticism more) You're not very supportive
Well, its just copying something someone did, like, 30 years ago in the Bronx
Well yeah
'm part of a tradition of civil disobedience, something bigger than myself
Oliver can't believe Elliott said that
Elliott drives along-side Oliver who's walking with a spray paint can, terrified as he's never done this before
He tries to spray, nothing comes out
How does it work
Shake it, you have to shake it
Oliver shakes it awkwardly, then sprays across the wall: 1985 Oliver runs back to the car, exhilarated
What was that
Historical consciousness
you know, something bigger than myself
Elliott scoffs
Let's do it again
Elliott drives off
Oliver's coming to life
() 10/29/07 34
: : (
) Okay, but when you see her, don't tell her that you painted historical consciousness on the wall
: more of Oliver's graffiti on different buildings: 1983 2003 ' Oliver exits his house alone, down his front stairs to the street
Halfway down, he hears now familiar sound of Arthur barking and howling
Oliver can't believe it
' Anna is sitting on the bed, gently petting Arthur
He's sweet
He misses your Dad
She stops
Gets up, nervous, and walks past Oliver into the next room
Oliver follows her in
They pause uncomfortably, Anna suddenly leans in and kisses him
Before it goes to far
Maybe we, we could, um, just talk for a second
Right
They awkwardly break apart
Anna goes to a chair, Oliver follows
While nothing has really been expressed between the two, Anna seems to understand the problem
Well, my name is Anna
You're worried you can't trust me because you don't know who  am
get it
That makes sense to me
She falters, looks at him vulnerably
Oliver abruptly kisses her
She pushes back
They pause
She traces his brow slowly with her index finger, the way she did their first night
' "  " () 10/29/07 35
: : The music carries us, they lie in bed, naked
Anna innocently leans over and takes Oliver's arm and bites down hard
He grimaces
She stops and kisses it, admiring her teeth marks
She gets up, sits at a side table and finds her cigarettes
Oliver watches her
The music seems to bend and slow down, this continues as we fall into memory
' on young Oliver's hand pushing on a record making the bending, slowing sounds
Oliver, stop it
Oliver stands up bored, Georgia's in the connecting bathroom getting ready to go out
This music's old
It's black, black music is the deepest cause they suffered the most, them and the Jews
Oliver plops down on the bed, listening to her
In my next life 'm gonna marry a good hot blooded Jew - someone full of emotion
'm Jewish right
Georgia comes and sits with him, caresses his hair as she talks with him
50 You're a quarter, 'm a half, your father's none
He has the least emotions, You'll have more emotions than him, but 'll have the most emotions
She likes that she has the most emotions
They head out
() 10/29/07 36
: 50 You get to play chauffeur but just to the bottom of the hill
' 10 year old Oliver's in the driving sear, Georgia smokes and admires his handling of the car
You're turning into a wonderful driver
Oliver's proud
Oliver escorts Georgia up the large steps of the museum
The crowd from an opening gathers at the top
Georgia and Oliver approach a David Smith sculpture
After staring at it's angels for a beat, Georgia begins to do an angular modern-dance-pantomime of the sculpture, imitating it's shapes with her body
Oliver locks up with embarrassment
confused and concerned museum guard approaches
Excuse me Mrs
Fields
What
You're not allowed to interact with the art
It's just that
'mon
Still embarrassed, Oliver takes Georgia's hand and walks her away from the guard
You too
You like being a good citizen
No
10/29/07 37
'   - Anna's sits in her kimono
Oliver's buttoning his shirt
Can you toss me my camisole
Oliver throws a sweater
(') No, my camisole
She throws the sweater back at him
Oliver looks around helplessly
He grabs a flower out of a vase and hands it to her
Camisole
Anna laughs
You don't know what a camisole is
was brought up by these animals and they didn't like questions
They're both smiling now
They were very frowned upon
So had to guess
Anna takes this in
You can ask me anything
Anything
: Oliver and Anna at the window
What's out there
She points
That's a tree
Yeah
() 10/29/07 38
: And cars
Uh-huh
Another building like this one
Right
People in the building like us
Half of them think things will never work out
The other half believe in magic
It's like a war between them
Oliver smiles
He moves away from the window
How do you know so much about people
Oh
Well, you have to learn how to read their faces
She climbs onto his lap, straddles him
For example
here is mad
Anna passes her hand across her face, and she's "mad"
Happy
Her hand passes again and she's "happy"
Sometimes its just nothing
Oh yeah
She points at her blank face
This is nothing
And they are good at looking one way and being another way
Her playfulness is very meaningful to Oliver, he's in love
10/29/07 39
They walk through a caged-in freeway overpass - Oliver is carrying Arthur while blindfolding Anna with his hands
Over this we hear the sounds of the quiet hotel room and an intimate conversation between them
(
) You don't know me
like that
(
) No, that's not true
(
) Oh yeah
(
) Yeah, you have blonde hair that goes down to about here
You smoke in non-smoking rooms
Oliver is still covering her eyes, leading her to a certain point, the busy sound of the freeway fading up
Okay, open your eyes
on huge trucks and traffic racing just beneath Oliver and Anna's feet under the overpass
The trucks lay on their horns as they pass, scaring and thrilling them
: they walk alongside the  river together, arm in arm, happy
The intimate conversation continues in voice over
(
) Oh yeah
You drive on the sidewalk
You were raised by animals
Sometimes you look very alone, like you just got here
They meet up with friends on the banks of the river
(
) Yeah, you see, you don't know me at all
' Oliver and Arthur are leaving, walking down the long hallway together
Arthur seems to stop and look up at Oliver
She's unlike any girl 've ever met
() 10/29/07 40
: Oliver stops and looks at Arthur
Someone flashy walks into your life and you're just gonna fall for it
Are we married yet
No, uh, it doesn't work like that
There are other steps, it's complicated
They look at each other a beat and then walk on together
hope this feeling lasts
'   - Oliver is shaving Hal's face
What happened with Michelle
You know
don't know
She seemed great
She was great
Maybe you should take out a personal ad, where you explain your situation
My situation
Yeah,  mean, you want to be in a relationship but you can't stay in one
That's your fatherly advice
Personal ads
() 10/29/07 41
: Well, a lot of people use them did
What
If Andy wasn't going to be monogamous, why should  be
Jesus, Pop
Jesus yourself
' - Hal's friends hold up a hand-made " " sign in the living room
Oliver helps Hal walk to his crew, Andy at the center holding Arthur
Hello house (Answers back in deep voice) Hello Hal
Andy holds Arthur
Hal and Arthur kiss
They've clearly missed each other
: Oliver takes bottles of pills and syrups and inhalers out of a Sav-On bag
He makes a chart of the medicine, the dosage, and puts the pills in a dish
It's emotional job for him
' / Oliver watches as Andy sneaks up behind Hal with his hands cupped closed
Hal turns and smiles
Oh God, what have you got this time
It's a green caterpillar
No, no, no, you don't have a green caterpillar
Oh yeah  do
() 10/29/07 42
: Andy opens his hands to reveal he actually does have a green caterpillar
Oh my God
Gross
Oh, Jesus
() Andy puts the caterpillar down on the saucer of Hal's tea cup, gives him a big kiss, and starts to leave
Hey, you going
Yeah, Michael's in town
Oh
Right
Andy waves goodbye and leaves
Hal is sad but covering it up
He catches Oliver watching
thought he was your boyfriend
Well, at least 'm the number one boyfriend
Hal grimaces in pain, doubles over
Pop
Oh, my stomach
Alright, come on
Come on
Oliver tries to clear the couch of books and dogs for Hal to sit down
Arthur, down
Well, let's say, when you were little, you always dreamed of some day getting a lion
Oliver eases Hal down onto the couch
() 10/29/07 43
: And you wait and you wait and you wait and you wait and the lion doesn't come
Then along comes a giraffe
Oliver helps Hal get his feet up
You can be alone or you can be with the giraffe
'd wait for the lion
Oliver grabs the oxygen tubes and puts them on Hal's face
That's why  worry about you
Hal looks at Oliver with love and concern
'  - on Oliver's hands as he writes "   "
him drawing an explosion with the caption: " (   )"
He draws a man and a woman with the caption: " " He draws a spilled glass - "  , " He draws a man's face and torso: " " He draws a man labelled "" having been crushed by a giant boulder labelled "
" Oliver stops drawing, thinking of a conversation with his father
: Hal on his couch (previous scene) talking to Oliver
You want me to be with someone like me
like Andy cause he's not like me
he's fun
' Arthur runs down the hotel hallway, followed by Oliver, they come to a corner and Anna jumps out, scaring them, they laugh and continue on together
10/29/07 44
Oliver and Anna are in the overcrowded used book store we saw earlier
Oliver sees her down the aisle
Hey, what did you get
She puts the cover of Liv Ullman's "Changing" over her face - Ullman's face on the cover becomes Anna's
(') Liv Ullman
Very serious
And  found this crazy book
She holds an old copy of     in front of her face
That's kind of a classic American thing
Anna opens the book to a large drawing of a couple having sex
Maybe we can figure out some classic American things to do
Oliver takes the book and flips through the pages
Yeah, Like page 75
Uh-huh
Or 75 all the way through, through 80
Oliver, Anna and Arthur sit at the end of an aisle looking at a book on "Old Hollywood"
The book has a photo of Louise Brooks from the Twenties
() Louise Brooks, star of silent screen
effectively banned from Hollywood in early Thirties, ended up working as a salesgirl at Saks Fifth Avenue
() 10/29/07 45
: Anna listens
Oliver turns the page, we see a photo of Veronica Lake
Veronica Lake
Oh  love her
She was a pin-up model and a film star
Success was short-lived
series of broken marriages
She struggled with mental illness and alcoholism
She died of hepatitis at the age of 53
All these actor stories end sad can tell you that already
It's not a good life
Oliver closes the book, they share a look, and something vulnerable
Anna changes the mood, pulls out The Joy Of Sex, skips through the pages as she talks
(') So
Now  want real Mexican food
She stops on an illustration she likes
(') And  want to try page

- Oliver, Anna and Arthur walk up to a typical
Taco truck on the side of the street
There is nothing fancy looking about it
No
Yeah
Really
It's really good
: They're sitting on milk crates by the truck, ready to take their first bite, Anna dives in un-selfconsciously, we're not sure what she thinks
() 10/29/07 46
: What do you think
It's so good
Oliver's so relieved
It's good
Oh,  wasn't sure you'd like it
Why
You're an actress and staying in that fancy hotel
Anna can barely swallow her huge bite
like this place
' They lie on the bed, continuing their conversation, side by side, looking up at the ceiling together
used to love hotels
But now 'm always in a new apartment or
in another hotel somewhere
How do you keep hold of friends
or boyfriends
It makes it very easy to end up alone - to leave people
You can stay in the same place and still find ways to leave people
She reaches up with her hand, their fingers intertwine
You are like that
Its what you do
Oliver nods yes
They know each other much better than either one knew
So we are the same
() 10/29/07 47
: Yeah,  guess so
The look to each other
'  - '  - Thumps and loud 1920's music wakes Oliver in the middle of the night
He turns the lights on, discombobulated
He gets up, works his way through the dark house
Turning on lights
Pop
'   - Hal's awake, he's taken down dozens of books from a wall to wall bookshelf
huge physical task
a nurse is with him
Oliver's dumbfounded
Oh, did  wake you
Yeah
(Handing Maria some books) Thank you Maria
(to Oliver) And now that you're here, uh, would you please put those up there
What are you--
Pop
What
'm reorganizing
Prednisone makes you crazy
'm just not sleepy
feel great
' Oliver and Hal are sitting at either side of his desk, Arthur is in hal's lap
The sound from last scene bleeds over
(
) Pop, you should rest
Hal looks sick but energized, he shuffles his desk of papers
() 10/29/07 48
: As soon as  finish these papers
Right, papers
(In a different voice) Right, Hal
As soon as you're done, you can rest
Oliver can only sit and worry
Anna, Oliver and Arthur are walking in Elysian park, a view of downtown behind them
Oliver's looking at her face, she notices
What
Nothing, you're pretty
No
Yeah
Jewish girls are not pretty
They can be "interesting", or cute, but not pretty
You're kidding right
That's what my mom told me
She did not
Anna laughs
As Anna continues to explain, the sound begins to fade down
No, you're right, this girl at school told me that
And  went home and my mom said, `Anna, who told you that
And Oliver's narration fades in over them walking
() 10/29/07 49
: (
) This is what it looks like when Anna tells me about being Jewish in 2003
And when  tell her that my mother was Jewish
And then my father turned in his gay badge when my mother turned in her Jewish badge
And they got married in 1955
: 1938,
,
(
) My mother didn't know she was Jewish until she was 13
It was 1938
This is what people looked like
1938 (
) And lions and giraffes
This man was Man of the Year
'   1938, '

Who blew and were blown
'  - '   : Oliver flips through a mock-up he made for "The Sads" - it's all the happy faces from 1950's advertising that we saw in the last scene
One face per-panel
: the three members of "The Sads" and a arrive
Jelly Roll Morton piano plays, we see but do not hear the meeting take place
The Sads look at the designs, which include many of the "History Of Sadness" drawings we have seen now in  cover format - and no portraits of the band
It's clear that The Sads are not into Oliver's work
: After the meeting, the    talks to Oliver alone
Just do the portrait of them, it's an album cover, right
That's what they want
Yeah
Oliver's very disappointed but polite
() 10/29/07 52
: Yeah
Right
: - Oliver and Arthur leave the office, defeated
'   - Oliver walks into Hal's living room, carrying his full tray of medication
Here, Pop
Oh, God
know,  know
Come on
Hal begins taking his many pills, with each one he pings his glass with a teaspoon as he swallows
The room is cluttered with books
Oliver picks up a toppling pile of files from a paper-filled side table
Hey, no, no, no
That's the Gay Pride Day stuff
Just leave those
Alright
Oliver begins to neaten a messy pile of books on top of a chair
And that's for gay book club
You better leave those too
But what about this chair
Is it gay
The chair's not gay
Obviously
Hal gets up and walks to the kitchen, his oxygen cannon cord is attached to the pump behind him, stopping him short
() 10/29/07 53
: Pop, Pop, the cord won't go that far
Oh, to hell with it
Hal pulls off the oxygen and keeps walking, frail but determined
Andy enters with a large pilates ball
Oh, hey what's that
Now that you're out of the hospital, you'll have to exercise, get you back into shape
Oliver can't believe it
That's a great idea
Okay, let's try it
'll, 'll show you how
Hal's still heading to the sink
Yeah, later on, 'm gonna make myself some tea
Okay, 'll clean it up
It's a little - yech
Andy walks out, Hal pours water into a kettle, in front of him on the window sill is the same vase from the first scene of the film, with some dead daisies in it
Your mother's vase needs some flowers
Oliver looks at them frustrated and uneasy
- Oliver and Hal walk amongst all the products
Hal wears his portable oxygen and grabs different kinds of papers, dumping them in the basket Oliver holds
Pop, you just got out of the hospital, you should take it easy
() 10/29/07 54
: They're in a new isle, Hal continues his march
You need to tell Andy that you're
not well
Hal, continues on, avoiding looking at Oliver
You'll tell him, won't you
Oliver's flabbergasted, but his dad's vulnerability is clear to him
Me
Please
'   - Andy's on an elliptical trainer, through a window we can see Oliver approaching with the weight of the world on his shoulders
Andy see's him, can immediately sense that something is wrong
Hey
Oliver approaches seriously, this makes Andy nervous, he stops his workout
Oliver tries to find his words
You know that  tried to have sex with women
Yeah
Yeah
wanted you to know tried, it just, it didn't work
Hey,  don't have a problem with gay guys
Have you ever had sex with a man
No
() 10/29/07 55
: heard that if a man hasn't had sex with another man, he's always afraid of gay men
You know, they're a threat
Oliver's blown away by the logic
don't know Andy
didn't want you to feel threatened,  don't want to have sex with you
What  do, most people wouldn't even call it sex
Andy's relieved he got this off his chest, all tension is relieved for him, Oliver is just confused
Okay, okay
Hey
Andy gives Oliver a big sweaty hug
Oliver leaves
'  - Oliver enters as Hal's finishing the dishes
couldn't tell him
That's okay
No it's not
You can't hide this from him
He loves you
For someone with so much relationship advice, you seem awfully alone
Oliver, angry but at a loss for words, takes the flower vase and leaves, Arthur follows
'  - Oliver and Arthur exit a side door, go to a planter full of daisies and cuts some for his mother's vase
He looks back Arthur
() 10/29/07 56
: Just act natural
When he's not looking, we'll make a run for it, okay
We cut to Arthur sprinting up a trail in Elysian park
Oliver and Anna chase after him
In contrast to the previous scene there is lightness and laughter here
' The three enter, the phone is ringing, Anna is staring at it with dread
Oliver looks at her, he finally moves to pick it up
Don't, don't
It keeps ringing
It's my dad
They both watch the phone as it rings and stops
He's that bad
She picks up the phone, and gestures for Oliver to pick up the line next to him
(') 'll be my dad, you be me
(In a deep man's voice) Honey
She gestures again, Oliver picks up the phone on his side of the bed
Anna turns away, he can only see her back across the bed
He turns away too
Oui
Anna continues to talk in a different voice
'est toi, cheri
() 10/29/07 57
: Oui Papa
You never call me back
You know,  can't stop thinking about, you know, about it
Doing it
Doing what
Killing myself
You are the only one  can tell that to
Oliver breaks role, turns around looks at her
You should tell mom about that, not me
She just looks at him
Back into phone
You are my girl
They hang up
She's embarrassed, she lightens the mood to get out of this intimacy
Now  have to kill you
Just as it was going so well
know
'm sorry
She tosses a pillow over his face and pretends to shoot him twice
She pulls the pillow back tentatively, he's smiling
Hey Anna
Hey Oliver
How do you feel about vandalism
It's the last question she thought he'd ask
She's amused
() 10/29/07 58
: don't know
Pretty okay

- Anna, Oliver, Elliott, Shauna and Arthur drive up Sunset Blvd
They arrive at Alvarado, park and get out
Above them a well lit large blank/white billboard
As Oliver and Elliott get spray paint cans from the back of the car
Oliver, don't write any of that serious stuff, okay
Just write something funny
Girls like funny
The gang get to the top of the stairs, on to the roof where they can see the large blank billboard towering in front of them
You know what
Here, give me Arthur
We'll just stay here and get arrested
You know, that's good
Oliver leaves Arthur with her, and Anna and Elliott and him head off to the billboard
They climb it's structure, it's high and a bit scary
On the top is a gang plank looking over the city
Anna is happy she came
Elliott goes to paint the back side of the billboard
Oliver meets up with Anna, over looking the city
You okay
Yeah
'm gonna stay here with my new friend (the handrail she holds)
Okay
Oliver walks out and writes big letters across the billboard
'
He makes his way back
Anna's not where she was, he looks and finds her in the gangways between the two billboards with a view to downtown below her
'est beau ici
() 10/29/07 59
: Yeah
He comes to her, wanting to get beyond the romance somehow
'm trying to impress you
(Gasps ironically) Really
She walks to him and puts her hands around his head, somehow it's more intimate and vulnerable now
It's working
They kiss
They're at the bottom of the ladder
They all run back to their car
'  - Oliver, Anna and Arthur walk down the hallway
Arthur bolts ahead suddenly, getting free of Oliver, he runs to and - wearing all black and looking just like Hal
Oliver runs up to stop Arthur
Arthur, Arthur
'm sorry
We see the old man's face, it's not Hal, but it the resemblance hits Oliver too
The man is struggling with his hotel key card
Oh
No problem
No problem
What's with this card
(') Uh, do you mind
Oliver swipes the man's key, the door opens
Thank you
He disappears
Oliver looks overwhelmed by this ghost
Anna senses what's happened
She leads Oliver to their room
'  - Oliver sits on the bed, sinking
Anna watches him
She comes to him, hugs him
() 10/29/07 60
: He looked like your dad
Yeah
She wants to take care of him, she lays him back on the bed, helps him take his coat off, she's sitting on him, caressing him - Oliver is overwhelmed by memory
Somewhere along the line, he stopped admitting to himself that he was sick

Well
You have stage 4 cancer
It's not as bad as it sounds
Pop
There is no stage 5
That's not what it means
What does it mean
It just means it's been through 3 other stages
Oliver doesn't know what to say, he looks through the door at all of Hal's friends -- happy, laughing, partying
He looks back at Hal, ready to fight him more, but for the first time we can see fear and doubt in Hal's face
What movie are we watching
"The Life of Harvey Milk
" He was the first openly gay politician
Yeah  know who Harvey Milk is
Good, good
() 10/29/07 64
: Hal heads back to the party, leaving Oliver alone in the kitchen overwhelmed

Hal pulls the lap-top to himself and reads what he has dictated
Eventually Jesus grew old
He could no longer walk far and he could no longer preach in a loud voice
One day he announced to his apostles that he was departing
The three disciples prayed with him, gave him water, bathed and fed him
After gasping for breath for several days, one morning, just as dawn came, Jesus passed away
You re-wrote Jesus' death

But that must have been crazy for you
' Anna hugs and kisses Oliver
She's both overwhelmed by his need and sympathetic to all that he's lost
: The room is dark, Oliver is asleep
Anna is nervously awake
She quietly gets out of bed, puts her pants on, and sneaks to the door
Arthur wakes up and hops to her wanting to follow
Stay here

Again
As Andy lights up some more
Oliver covers his ears, he yells out

Oliver's laughing now - the noise, the absurdity
Hal and Oliver make eye contact
Hal yells less strongly than the others but trying
They keep eye contact

He shouldn't do this to you
The phone in the next room keeps ringing
He awkwardly skates to it and unplugs it
He returns
Oliver skates to her concerned
Even if we don't answer, he's still in here (points to her head)

She skates to him, puts her arms around him

They kiss
But now 'm going to have to kill you for sure now
Why
Cause 'm falling in love with you
The sound in the room fades down, Oliver's narration fades in over the shot of them embracing in their skates
