30 Written by Michael Diliberti & Matthew Sullivan 12-11-09 The following is very loosely based on some shit that actually happened
We hear the roar of a V8 engine, piped out through some throaty, fucked up muffler, as - An '89 Mustang bursts like a shot over a rise in the highway
It's got a rusted two-tone paint job, Maryland plates, and bald tires that scream as it peels off an exit and into the - The car fast approaches a stop sign, dangerously blows through the intersection
-  - We don't see the , only the redlining RPMs, Vans slip- ons working the pedals, wristwatch being checked
The wheel cranks right as the car turns onto a - One way street
minivan flies right at us
The Mustang hops up onto the curb to avoid it, clips a trash can and - Garbage explodes like confetti
The wipers engage, brushing the trash aside
The car whips another turn and - The Mustang fishtails around a corner and skids away
: Brake pads smoke
The Mustang stops outside - The Driver jumps out of the car
As he rushes to the front door, we see the urgent package he is delivering
Before he can ring the bell, the door opens and two smug 15- - stare out
15-- That's 34 minutes
You're 4 minutes late
Pizza's free
our guy staring back at the kids
This is  (25), probably good looking in another life
2
Right now, he is tired and unamused, wearing a red "Giorgio's Trattoria" hat and a sweaty matching t-shirt
Gimme a break
You guys live two towns away
It's pretty much fucking impossible to get here in 30 minutes
15-- Exactly
That's why we ordered from your shitty "trattoria
" This is gonna come out of my paycheck
You sure you don't want to take the moral high ground
15-- We'd rather take the pizzas
Will takes a calming breath
Hands over the pizzas
Ok
You guys are pretty smart
You figured out a way to beat the system
( ) Got the house to yourselves
15-- That's right
Not bad
Any jailbait in there
Little pizza and a rainbow party
The kids shakes their heads
Seriously
Well, two hustlers like yourselves gotta have the place stocked with beer and whippits and shit, right
Just call the girls up and let them know the party's on
15-- Man, we don't have any of that stuff
Will makes a show of mulling this over
really shouldn't do this
but you seem like a couple of good dudes
'll tell you what, you give me the money that your mom left you for the pizzas, and 'll grab you some beers
() 3
(') () But  get to keep the change as a tip
Deal
The kids look at each other
One hesitantly pulls out some cash
Will snatches it and heads off
'll see you in like 20 minutes
The kids look uncertain
As if sensing this, Will stops before getting into his ride
You boys like Budweiser, right
15-- Uh, yeah, totally
15-- Love that shit
-  - The sun sets
Will cruises back into his own middle-class town in suburban Maryland
six pack of Budweiser rests in the passenger seat
Will stops at a light
Checks out a    in the Jeep beside him
She catches him looking, rolls her eyes
The light turns and the Jeep skids away
Will self consciously removes his "Giorgio's" cap
'  - Will enters and nods at  (40s), the manager
His balding head is nearly translucent from absorbing a day's worth of pizza grease
Yo, Chris
Let me cash the fuck out
Will hands over some cash to Christopher
You have a pretty good shift
For sure
mean, the part where had to drop off all those pizzas kinda sucked, but the rest was cool
4
Oh, yeah
'Cause,  got some kids calling in saying you ripped them off
Promised to buy them beer or something
actually did buy the beer, but it would have been illegal to give it to them, right
So 'm gonna do the responsible thing and drink it myself
That's real funny
But 'm trying to run a business here
What kind of business promises to deliver anywhere in 30 minutes
It's ridiculous
don't wanna hear another one of your bullshit excuses
You're fired
Come on
If  didn't need this job, wouldn't be doing this shitty job
Chris is unmoving
Fuck
Whatever
Will storms off
As he gets to the door - You know, you were an okay driver half the time
And you're not a Puerto Rican
Which means something to me
That's poignant
guess  could rehire you, on a provisional basis
Of course, this would be at the slightly reduced "new company rate
" Are you fucking serious
don't know
Is there anyone else left in town for you to work for
5
Will shakes his head
Swallows what's left of his pride
When do  start
- Will sits on the darkened front stoop
He tosses an empty can into the bushes and gets to work on his fourth beer
He looks over at a parked Hyundai Elantra
sits in the passenger seat with a pensive look on his face
He makes a sudden, surprised gasp
The homely   who was just blowing him sits up from his lap and rearranges herself in the driver seat
She leans over for a goodbye kiss
The Young Man obliges with much fanfare
The Young Man gets out and the car pulls away
This is (25), a clean cut guy dressed in the Gap Premium Collection
He heads toward the building, high off his , humming Outkast's "Ms
Jackson
" He stops when he notices Will in the shadows
What the hell
Have you just been sitting there
Yep
Caught the whole show
Really classy move at the end
You know, the kiss
Putting your tongue in her mouth right after you fucked it
Hey, a nice girl decides to pleasure me on a weeknight, in her car no less
'm not gonna make her feel like an untouchable
'm gonna make her feel like a lady
What manners
May  offer you some alcohol, sir
To wash the taste of yourself out of your mouth
Will offers his beer
Chet takes a slug, gurgles for effect
By the way, she said she had a friend
Maybe we can go on our first double date since you tried to talk Jackie Fortunato and her cousin into having a four-way with us
misread their body language
It happens
6
Will picks up some rented movies sitting beside him
Come on
Let's go inside, drink your beer and watch shit get crazy
( ) Old favorites
You choose
Lethal Weapon, Lethal Weapon 2
was gonna get the third Lethal Weapon, but decided on a porn
So it's really between the first two
choose sleep
gotta teach a class at eight
You're a sub
Just call in sick
Like the real teacher did
Come on, man, you know  got promoted to full-time last month
You bought me a laser pointer
Will heaves a sigh
Yeah,  know
guess 'm just having a hard time accepting you as "the man
" You know, flunking kids, giving out spite detentions to girls you wanna fuck, laser pointing at shit
also get healthcare and my summers off
It's not perfect, but it's a career
Will grudgingly stands up
guess that's just the difference between you and me
He holds up the Lethal Weapon DVDs
'm like Riggs
Cruising the streets
No rules, no attachments
Every other day some asshole is trying to take my badge
You're fucking Murtaugh
Always worried about your pension
Well, guess what, it gets old after the first movie
7
just got head
'm totally Riggs
Will shakes his head, turns and walks off
- Will wakes up, legs dangling over the edge of a tiny couch
His  is still on, displaying the menu screen from a porn
Will looks down at his coffee table
Clears some magazines to reveal a file folder
Flips the cover - It's full of college applications, drafts of admissions essays, a junior college transcript
Will thumbs through one of the glossy applications
The kids look young
Very young
Will glances over at a picture on his wall: he and Chet at high school graduation, looking just as young
They have their arms around a pretty girl squeezed between them
Will and the girl look very high and very happy
Will shuts the folder, slides it back under the coffee table debris
He looks over at a clock: it is already 2:00
Fuck
- Will jumps in and starts the engine
As he tucks his "Giorgio's" cap onto his head, he catches his reflection in the rear-view mirror
You asshole
You titanic asshole
Come on down and get your prize
He makes his fingers into a gun, puts it to his head
pulls the trigger and ' - watermelon explodes in a shower of red, juicy bits
Loud, dumb laughter echoes
Standing 20 yards away is  (32), an intense, meaty guy in a sleeveless Baltimore Ravens t-shirt
On his left bicep is a tattoo of the Tasmanian Devil flipping the bird
Fruit motherfuckin' salad
8
Crouched beside him is  (27), tall and awkward, in a wool surplus cap
He carefully rigs homemade explosives to another watermelon, then looks up at Dwayne
His eyes are magnified into saucers by his thick glasses
There's a peculiar eagerness to please in them
This one's gonna blow even bigger
Boy, if you weren't such a skinny little bitch you coulda been in the military or something
Whatever
don't need the military
taught myself how to do this shit
hear that
taught myself how to eat pussy
And cut my own hair
Jay jogs the watermelon a safe distance away
He returns and pulls out a detonator
Dwayne snatches it
This one's all me
(makes "radio" sounds) Mr
President, we have enemies at the gate
Give me the order
(more "radio" sounds) Fuck that, sir
don't negotiate with terrorists
Dwayne presses a button and The explosion is so powerful that it sprinkles our guys' smiling faces with fruit juice
,   - Large and early-90s chic
Dwayne and Jay have the fridge open, fixing themselves a cold cut plate
Dwayne is debating the amount of meat on the plate
adds some more
Wanna make sure  get enough calories
thought you wanted to get diesel for the summer
Bang that towel girl at the community pool
9
It's obvious you don't know shit-all about physical fitness
You gotta bulk up first, then you slim down
'm clearly in the bulk up phase told you to watch Pumping Iron like a month ago
If you'd listened to me, maybe you'd know what the fuck 'm talking about
() Grab some  Cola
,   - The shades are drawn
We hear a girl scream bloody murder
The guys are watching   13TH  3
in 3D
They both wear cheap cardboard glasses
Jay jumps back as Jason wields a 3D ax
Shit, man
It's so real
Dwayne reaches out, "touching" the 3D images
He stands and starts humping the air
Check it out
ain't afraid of Jason
'm fucking him
( ) You like that, Jason
In the mask
Jay cracks up
The lights flick on
(
) Who are you two fags fucking
Standing by the switch is Dwayne's dad,  (70s)
Most people just call him "
" The faded  tattoo on his thick forearm explains why
Afternoon, Major
Dwayne flops back onto the couch
Dad, we're watching a flick
We got 45 minutes and a potential 3D sex scene left
You're sorta coming in at the worst possible moment
10
bought that  set so  could watch my programs, not so you and your friend could louse up my couch
You gotta learn how to share the common space
The only thing common in this house is you
You remind me of your damn mother
Fat, dumb, and in my way
The Major grabs Dwayne and pulls him up off the couch
He gets right in his face
scary, intense
Dwayne turns to Jay
Let's get outta here
This movie sucks anyway
Jay gets up and files out the door
Dwayne goes to take the cold cut plate
The Major grabs his arm
paid for the damn cold cuts, too
Maybe if you had a job, or a fucking prospect, or a clue how to find any of the above, 'd let you eat 'em
() You know, you can be a real sonofabitch, dad
That's what it takes, boy
In the Corps, men like you wore dresses to keep us entertained
That's pretty fucking disturbing
Dwayne storms off
- Dwayne and Jay head out, passing a brand new pickup truck in the driveway
Dwayne spits on it
Fuck The Major
The guys get in a shitty Ford Aerostar minivan and peel out
11
- Kelly's "Ignition (Remix)" pumps
Large, fake breasts, sparkling with cheap body glitter and pierced at the nipples, shake before us
Their owner, (27), a petite Latina, phones in a lap dance as Dwayne pours his heart out to her
Somewhere in the background, Jay hangs at the bar, all alone
- and he thinks he knows me
He don't know shit
got ideas he could never dream of
got plans bigger than his fucking house
() He didn't even raise me
My mother did
That was a good woman
Oh yeah
What happened to her
Dwayne shifts, uncomfortably, at the sore subject
She passed on
hope you're not one of those guys that comes here looking to get mothered
wouldn't mind nursing on them titties, mamacita
Sure
Whatever you say
Maybe just keep quiet for a while, forget about your old man and let me do my thing
wish  could forget about that asshole for good
'm just waiting around for him to drop dead
Don't wanna mess with my inheritance
This piques Juicy's interest
What kinda inheritance
12
When my dad got outta the service, he started buying lotto tickets
He'd play his dog tag numbers
In '91, the fucker won five million bucks
: The Major holding a giant cardboard check
He had some health problems a few years back, and since then he's been burning through the money like an draft pick
Probably only got a million or two left
But it's mine as soon as he kicks
Behind inch-long fake eyelashes, Juicy's shrewd eyes narrow, mind working
She straddles Dwayne, tightly
You know, with a million bucks, you could have anything
Be like a king
(almost a moan) King Dwayne
That's right
And maybe 'll make you my queen
Let you polish my royal scepter
Practice makes perfect
Juicy pantomimes a long, slow chicken head
Dwayne is blissed out
She smiles at him, sticky sweet
Let me ask you a question
do you really hate your daddy
Hate him like the Steelers
Then maybe  can help you get that money now
Before he spends another penny
Dwayne looks confused
Juicy puts his hands on her breasts, emboldening him
know a guy in Baltimore
He could help you out
Probably do it for
(sizing him up) 100Gs
13
Do what
Juicy leans in, whispers softly in Dwayne's ear - Kill your mean old dad
On Dwayne's face as this new possibility pinballs around his mind, setting off a flood of different emotions
So, what do you think
you ready for your crown
-  - Will has one pizza left in the back of his car
He pulls over outside an office building
,   - Rows of cubicles
Speckled with late night , bleary eyes, too busy generating detailed lists of places they'd rather be to notice the pizza boy walking along
Will stops before one such work station, looks on for a beat
Rio
(25) turns from the glow of her computer screen
She has short, messy hair and a sarcastic smile
This is the girl from the picture in Will's apartment
That's the plan
Five days, six nights
Culture
Beaches
Acceptable probability of kidnapping
leave in the morning
Kate looks back at her computer, logged onto an Expedia checkout page for a Rio vacation
She moves the mouse pointer from the "proceed" key
closes the window
This morning  loaded up an African Safari and a cruise to Alaska
Oh, the places you'll go
Fuck Expedia
Travel Advisor
Making it seem so easy
14
It is
Just do it
Get away for a while
Even if  could afford that
they fired two other paralegals last week
Now's not the time to be putting in for vacation days
Ok
Done
've got my dose of the actual working world
Can we eat
Will lays a pizza down on her desk
How do you keep sneaking up here past the security guard
He's there like half the time
The other half  smile at him
'm relatively certain he's a homosexual
Interesting theory
Kate opens the pizza box, grabs a slice
Maybe  should set him up with Tom Small
He came out to me today on Facebook
That kid beat the hell out of me and Chet in grammar school
Wow
Tell me about it
He fingered me at junior prom while they were playing "No Scrubs
" () Really
What a fucking scrub
Will grabs a slice
They eat quietly for a beat
So, 've got some news
15
thought the Tom Small stuff was enough of a headline, but go ahead
'm getting back together with Mark
Will's delicious pizza suddenly tastes like shit
He does his best to swallow it down
But you
you broke up with him
ended the relationship
Finality was had
Yeah, but we were talking and - Forget it
don't want to know
You sound like Chet
Woah, don't compare me to your brother
Well, neither one of you seems to care that  don't have a life
Mark's not perfect
but a relationship is better than working late every Friday because  have nowhere else to be
Sure
get it
Here we are
Friday night
Nowhere to be
Kate shoves Will, good-naturedly
You know what  mean
Will shrugs, quietly devastated
Goes back to his pizza
- Most of the  are fixated on an Orioles game blaring from a large flat-screen
At a booth in back, Dwayne and Jay are in deep conversation
16
don't wanna stick my nose into a family matter
but killing your old man
That's pretty messed up mean, unless you think it isn't
What we have here is a classic "lesser of two evils" debate
You got one evil: me shaving a few years off The Major's shitty life
Then you got the other evil: The Major ruining my entire awesome life by blowing through my inheritance
Maybe 'm biased, but mine sure as shit seems like the lesser
guess
sorta see where you're coming from
And you have been waiting around forever for that money
You deserve it, Dwayne
Dwayne nods, seriously
You know, there's a reason  sleep 'til noon everyday
And it ain't 'cause 'm lazy
It's on account of me having so many goddamn dreams
Big ones
And once that money's mine, they're all gonna come true
Dwayne takes a long sip of beer, contemplative
Like  had this one dream last night
was cruising through town in a Lamborghini Diablo
The wind was blowing through my hair, ruffling my open shirt
There was a hot little piece of ass sitting next to me
And in the back seat, Jay
was you
Strapped
Wearing a pair of Oakleys
Wow
didn't know you dreamt about me, Dwayne
It was only this once, Jay
To be honest,  didn't know what to make of it
So  consulted my dream book, and found out it means this: you're my road dog
You got my back
() 17
(') That's why  want to make you my partner
In what
In crime
And business
You see, it ain't just about the inheritance money
It's about what 'm gonna do with it
Dwayne leans across the table
'm about to clue you in on something
And then you'll understand the true magnitude of what's at stake here
Are you ready
Yes
'm totally ready
Then answer me this
what's this town missing
'll give you a hint
It's a cash business, crawling with sexy bitches
() Chinese food restaurant
No
tanning salon
() Think about it
All that green
All that brown flesh
Jay nods, thinking about
He smiles
It's also the perfect front for a prostitution ring
Yeah, of course
Because of the booths
Yes
And because of the bitches
() It can all be ours
30 percent for you, 70 percent for me
You just gotta help me out here
18
Jay looks conflicted
Dwayne goes dark, like a spurned lover
'm starting to wonder if my dream book was wrong about you
Maybe you sitting behind me doesn't mean you're my road dog
Maybe it means you're plotting to stab me in the back, like some snake in the grass
That's crazy
'd never do something like that
The dream book was right
Jay looks Dwayne in the eyes, knows it's all or nothing
Ok
'll do it
But 'm not shooting him or anything
'll hold him while you shoot him
That's it
Dwayne chuckles
Here's a fact: they don't build prisons for criminals, they build them for idiots
Shit, they got three different types of  on , just laying out how the police do their business
and still, idiots like you think you can just go out and do a murder yourself
() If you wanna be a millionaire, you gotta think like one
And millionaires don't kill people
They hire assassins
Which  did
We gotta pay him on Tuesday
What
Why would you do that
was presented with an opportunity
took it
100 thousand bucks for a highly trained assassin is a steal
But we don't have that kinda money
Now we're addressing the real problem: how do we get the 100 grand
'Cause once we get that, we get the million
() 19
(') And once we get the million, we will literally own this town and every single thing in it
guess we could just
rob a bank
One of these local banks with nothing but a dipshit security guard
Again, not quite thinking like a millionaire
Okay, then let's hire someone to rob a bank
Dwayne thinks about this for a second
Fuck hiring them, we could just force someone to rob a bank for us
Like with blackmail, or death threats, or - ( ) bomb
Everyone's scared of a bomb
was gonna say hypnotism
but like that
It's out of the fucking box
We just strap one to some motherfucker's chest, like we did to those watermelons
Think you can you build some kinda bomb vest
Yeah,  mean
camel jockeys do it in caves
got a garage workshop
'm pretty sure this is exactly how a millionaire would do it
And the beauty of it is: we don't lose any sleep, 'cause no one gets hurt
Except The Major
Yeah
The Major dies
But no one gets hurt
Dwayne smiles
But a nagging thought interrupts him - 20
There's just one problem
Where do we get our guy
'Cause if we do a kidnapping, then we're right back where we started
doing shit that's gonna get us caught
( ) What we need is someone to come to us
to a place where we can control the situation
Someone without any connection to us
The guys stare at each other, stumped
Until something catches Dwayne's attention
a local commercial playing on the flat-screen
slides a pizza into a box - ( ) We'll deliver anywhere in 30 minutes or less
Or your pizza is free
Giorgio's Trattoria, where the customer gets what they want
pronto
The guys look at each other
Sometimes fate just takes out its cock and slaps you in the face with it
'  - hand grabs a beer from the fridge
(
) You're not trying to draw a psycho pension
you really are crazy
Will heads into the living room with the beer
The voice belongs to Danny Glover
The guys are watching Lethal Weapon
Murtaugh (Danny Glover) has just stopped Riggs (Mel Gibson) from killing himself
Riggs looks at him, crazily, before - ( ) 'm hungry
'm gonna get something to eat
Chet looks over at Will
He is drunk, and in a dark mood
Maybe you should pace yourself
It's noon on a Saturday
Fridge is full, man
We're all good
21
Will drains half his beer
Let me ask you a question
You remember Tom Small
Yeah, he used to kick our asses
Turns out he was probably jerking off to it afterwards
He's gay
hope he chokes on a dick
never liked him
Your sister did
She let him finger blast her
Big time
Chet pauses the movie
What the fuck are you talking about
don't want that shit in my head
Sorry
Kate told me about it last night
thought you should know
You two were swapping stories about getting fingered
That's pretty cute
Chet chuckles
Will ignores him, sips his beer
The point 'm trying to make is this: Tom Small was an asshole
He was totally wrong for your sister
Just like every other guy she's ever dated
Right through to that Mark dude she's gonna get back together with
Un-be- fuck-me-lievable
Whatever
Why the fuck are we talking about who my sister goes out with
At a loss, Will shrugs
Chet turns back to the , presses play
Lethal Weapon resumes
Something blows up
Chet pauses the movie and stares at Will for a beat
22
You sneaky son of a bitch
you want to fuck my sister, don't you
Chet,  really don't
My twin sister
Which is basically like fucking me
Hey, if you guys had that twin shit this would be a completely different situation
There'd be logistical problems
We look exactly alike
You look like a lot of people
You're a normal looking dude
This is so fucked up  can't even begin to process it
How long has this been going on
If  had to put my finger on it
middle school-ish
So all those sleepovers, they were just some kind of opportunity for you to peek in Kate's bedroom
It might have happened a few times
Most of them were accidental
You're a peeping Tom
You realize that, don't you
You're a sexual fucking deviant
Fuck you
'm as normal as they come
Your sister is attractive
She excites me, in a sexual way
Fucking sue me
Can't we just be adults about it
23
You
An adult
Sort of stretching the term
Hey, let's not say shit we can't take back
Take back
Will, you got kicked out of junior college for punching a professor that made fun of some poem you wrote
That poem was about your sister
That is, literally, the saddest thing have ever heard
Like retards playing freeze tag sad
No wonder you deliver pizzas for a living
Fuck you
Maybe  was just hanging out with you for your sister
You were always a whiny little bitch
And you stuttered
All the kids used to call you "Chutter
" Whatever
only started hanging out with you because you had a Nintendo
Did you see my Nintendo naked
Because  saw your sister changing into her swimsuit at your thirteenth birthday pool party
And it was the highlight of the whole shitty event
Chet bites his lip
Okay
You wanna do this
think we already are
Well, you know who  saw naked
Jenny Rifkin
While  was nailing her
The week after she dumped you
() 24
(') Why do you think every time you wanna bet on whose cock's bigger 'm always willing to go in
'Cause  know mine's bigger
'Cause she told me
Wow
wow
You pulled a Judas on Jenny fucking Rifkin
That is messed up
Almost as messed up as how  sold your Cal Ripken signed ball for 200 bucks
My grandpa left me that ball in his will
You helped me look for it for a month
Now you know why we never found it
Will bows
We done here
Chet's face is red with anger
Not quite yet
There's actually a mystery  wanna solve for you
() was the one who told John Tanner about how your mom fucked that lifeguard
And  always felt awful about it, because even though he swore secrecy, he told everyone else in town
And then your parents wound up getting divorced
But now don't give a shit
What
You ruined
my fucking life
Will takes a swing at Chet
He dodges it and puts Will in some sort of choke hold
Krav Maga, bitch
bet your poetry professor didn't know this shit
Get offa me
You threw the first punch
25
'm gonna break this hold and then kick your skinny ass
Try it
Will flexes and tries to break the choke hold
no luck
He wrenches his back away from Chet and screams - What the fuck is that
My knuckle in your spine
No holds barred you backstabbing fuck
'm gonna pass out
Good
(face bright red) love her, Chet
love Kate
Chet lets Will go
He drops to the floor, panting
Let me tell you something
And it's the truest thing you'll ever hear, from the person who knows you best in the world
you're not good enough for my sister
And you never will be
You're the lowest common denominator, Will
You're the square root of fucking zero
Will gets to his feet
Fuck you
Chutter
( ) Square this
Get out of my house
You're a shitty friend
Right back at you
Will storms out
26
'   - Will screeches away in his car
- day or so has passed
Will sits on his couch, an unshaven mess, watching Lethal Weapon 2
Murtaugh and Riggs laugh and joke around
Best buds
Will looks like he might cry
He goes for his beer, knocks it over
He stares at the growing puddle of beer
then grabs the folder with his college applications and uses them to sop it up
'  - Will sits at a table, looking out through the misty window
Christopher boxes a pizza and drops it in front of him
Come on, wake up and get to work
Christopher hands him the order slip
Will checks the address
Where the fuck is this
How should  know
It's 30 minutes away or the pizza comes out of your paycheck
Tick tock
- Will's Mustang travels down a dark, empty stretch of highway
The lone working taillight fades as the car disappears into the distance
- The Mustang stops at the mouth of a driveway
Overgrown shrubbery blocks anything beyond it from view
All that Will can see is a red and white radio tower jutting into the sky, beacon light flashing atop it
Will checks the address, then drives through the open gate
- The Mustang parks at the end of the driveway
Will gets out
There is a large storage shed and, across a clearing, a radio tower built on top of a small office structure
27
The office door is ajar
Florescent light glows from inside
Hello
(
) (calling back from beyond door) Hey, bud
Sorry for the hike
The county's got us doing repairs at the ass end of the night
This puts Will at ease
He heads toward the office
As he gets close, a figure appears in the doorway
It is Dwayne What the - Will hears something behind him and whirls around - To find Jay, also in a gorilla mask, charging at him
Holy fuck
Will makes a run for it
But the guys are on top of him in no time
He madly fights them off and dashes for his car
Stop
We got a gun, you asshole
Will breaks toward the cover of the shrubbery
Fuck
Get him
Jay is right on Will's tail
Without breaking stride, Jay picks up a large branch and wings it at him
Will is hit in the legs and stumbles over himself
Jay leaps on top of him and locks his skinny legs around Will's body
What the hell
(at a loss) Rape
Jay wrestles something from his pocket
chloroform soaked rag
He presses it hard against Will's mouth and nose
Will soon goes limp
Dwayne appears, looming above them
He pulls his gorilla mask back and smiles
28
Step one
: Blurry vision coming into focus
Two gorillas
- Whereas the masks looked scary at night, they look ridiculous now
Will is propped up on the hood of his car, staring at his captors
His mouth is duct taped, hands bound behind his back
He wears his "Giorgio's" cap and a buttoned up olive green Army jacket
You thought we were gonna rape you
() Idiot
Will mumbles something through the duct tape
Just shut up
The tape is there for a reason
'Cause this next part is gonna take a measure of calm
Are you with me
Can you be calm
Will nods
Dwayne holds up his driver license
Will Dixon, of 112 North Whatever- The-Fuck Street, right now you are wearing an explosive vest
Will looks down at the jacket he is wearing, tries to get his hands loose so he can tear it open
Calm the fuck down
Will stiffens
For emphasis, Dwayne reveals the gun tucked down the front of his pants like a big metal cock
Now stay still and my associate will show you
Jay carefully unbuttons the Army jacket
Will is, in fact, wearing an explosive vest
It is a cobbled together but intimidating looking contraption, crisscrossed by multicolored wires
There is a thick lock at the hinge, with a digital display and a keypad
Will begins to hyperventilate
29
Take it easy, man
You're fine built this thing
It's pretty stable
For a fucking bomb
So don't trip over your shoelaces or anything
That thing's full of -4
And the is for chaos
Actually, the  stands for "composite
" But, yeah, 'd try not to slam into stuff
Can  take that tape off now, pizza boy
Will nods
Dwayne rips the duct tape off his mouth
Help
Dwayne chuckles
You know where you are
You might as well be in space, motherfucker
Nobody can hear you scream
Why are you doing this to me don't have any money
Not yet
But you're gonna go get us some
Okay
Sure, man
Whatever you say
'll go sell my car
'll get you like a thousand bucks
want 100 thousand
Where the fuck am  supposed to get that much money
The Donner-Wells National Bank on Charles Road
30
Across the street from the Olive Garden
Yeah, the one across the street from the Olive Garden
Do you guys have an account or something
Dwayne shakes his head like Will is an idiot
No,  don't have an account
You're gonna rob it
How the fuck am  supposed to rob a bank
Figure it out
You got a bomb strapped to your chest
That's a start
It'll scare the fuck outta people
Maybe use your brain and go get a gun
Borrow one from a friend for all care
It ain't rocket science
Then do it yourself
would, but 'm already wearing this gorilla mask and you're already wearing that bomb
( ) Tell him about the vest
Jay turns to Will
You seem like a pretty trustworthy guy
mean, you got a job and all
But just in case you were gonna try to take the vest off, we booby trapped it to shit
There's also a remote detonator on the back, so we can trigger it by dialing a number
And it's on speed dial
So do what you gotta do, but we'll be watching
() 31
(') You go anywhere near a police station, and Fourth of July comes early this year
Dwayne nods at the timer on the side of the vest
It's 9:00
You got 8 hours
He hands Will a slip of paper
Once you have the money, call this number and you'll be given instructions on where to drop it
You do good, we give you the six-digit combination that stops the timer and opens the lock
Tomorrow morning, you can go back to delivering pizza, the mail, whatever the fuck you want
() Now let me demonstrate what happens if you don't get us the money
Dwayne looks over to where an oversized stuffed bear, rigged with its own bomb vest, sits on a tree stump 20 yards away
Dwayne mimes answering a phone - Hey, Teddy Ruxpin
what's that
You don't have the money
It was too tough to rob the bank, so you just went back to your bear cave and cried like a bitch
Well, guess what my stuffed friend
time is up
Jay pushes a button on a detonator
Teddy Ruxpin explodes
All that remains is a cloud of stuffing
Will is frozen in fear
liked that bear
don't even know you
Dwayne throws Will his car keys
Go on
Get outta here
Guys, can we please just talk about this
32
Yeah, of course we can
Dwayne pulls out the gun and fires two shots at Will's feet
Jay jumps backward, as does Will, who hits the hood of his car, slides across it and onto the ground by the driver side
Be careful
Will awkwardly gets to his feet and arranges himself in the car, adjusting to the weight of the bomb
As he starts the engine and backs away - That's right
Get the fuck out of here
You're wasting time
Once the car is gone, Jay yanks off his gorilla mask
Dwayne stays primate
What the hell, Dwayne
You told me that was a replica gun
It was
Then  paid a Mexican 50 bucks to put a firing pin in it
Now it goes boom
We didn't discuss a loaded gun
Especially not with the bomb around
Dwayne gets right in Jay's face
The plastic eyes of his mask betray no emotion
Don't you ever question me
'm fucking this bitch
You're just holding the camera
( ) Sure, Dwayne
whatever you say
Good
'Cause this ain't the Marines
This is cash money
You hesitate, you fuck up
and  will leave you behind
tense beat
Dwayne pulls his mask off
He looks oddly calm
Let's go get some breakfast
33
- Will's car flies down the road
It screeches to a stop, tires smoking
Will jumps out, stumbles to the shoulder and pukes
He drops to his knees
Oh, god
Holy shit
Fuck me
Someone please fucking help me
Nothing but the wind
Will fights back tears
He gets to his feet, wipes his mouth
He takes out his cell phone, scrolls through the contacts
He pauses on Chet's name
presses send
The line goes to voicemail
Will looks at the bomb's timer: 7 hours, 47 minutes and counting
He hurries to his car
,    - laser dot dances around the middle of a United States map
Chet is teaching a history lesson to a bunch of that look very mature and very bored
As he indicates with his laser pointer - This whole region here, about 830 thousand square miles, was part of the initial Louisiana Purchase
() Nice laser
The class giggles
Chet, embarrassed, puts away the pointer
There is a knock at the door
Chet turns to see Will's face in the door's window pane
He looks back to his class
Take out your workbooks
Chapter 3
Chet opens the door
What do you want
We gotta talk
'm working here
Do not mess with me at work
34
Chet, for the love of god, just talk to me in private for one minute
Chet sighs
,    - Chet leads a jumpy Will into ,    - Chet shuts the door behind them
Will paces
You wanna apologize, don't you
You look like shit
You've probably been up for days thinking about what an asshole you were
Well, it's gonna take a lot more than some pathetic groveling - () Chet
Shut up
don't wanna apologize to you
Then what do you want
Because we don't have anything left to say to each other
Will swallows hard
Here goes
And this is gonna sound crazy
Because it is fucking crazy
But last night two guys in masks jumped me and strapped a bomb to my chest, and now  have less than eight hours to rob a bank
Chet just stares at Will, unimpressed
You're hysterical
Got me
Great joke
'm going back to work now
Will steps in Chet's way
He unbuttons his jacket, revealing the bomb
What the fuck
Is that real
Will nods
35
Chet jumps backward, stumbles over a desk and scurries on his ass to the other end of the classroom
He presses himself flat against the wall
Stay away from me
What the fuck are you involved in
Terrorism
Chet, do you really think 'm a terrorist
Yes
One of the dumb ones
The ones they convince to wear the bombs
am not fucking around here
Two guys did this to me
And if  don't rob that bank in time this thing is gonna blow
Seriously
Seriously
And your first idea was to come to a school filled with young children
didn't - Just back the fuck away from me with that thing
Will backs all the way up, so that the guys are on opposite ends of the classroom
Listen,  think the vest is safe for now
These guys don't want me to blow myself up on accident before get their money
Oh, so you figure the two psychopaths that rigged a bomb to your chest made sure it was safe
There's no margin for error in their fucking bomb vest design
36
don't know
All  do know is that this is real
This is happening
And 'm sure you hate me as much as hate you right now, but  have nowhere else to go
For what
For help, Chet
need your help
Please
can't do this alone
Chet looks Will over
His desperation is palpable
Chet bites his lip, weighing the situation
Damn it
(takes a breath) 'd like to tell you to get fucked, but you know what the problem is
'm a better man than you
And someday, might actually forgive you
So if let you blow up, or whatever, that shit might come back and eat at my conscience, and totally affect my relationships with other people
Like my wife and kids and shit
That's a
very rational way to look at the situation
() And you're right, about being a better guy than me
Chet takes a step toward Will
Are you sure that thing isn't gonna blow at any second
Will just looks at Chet
unable to offer any assurance
After a beat - Could you just walk a few feet in front of me for a while
can do that
Will opens the door, stops, looks back at Chet
37
Thank you
Will heads out
Chet takes a breath, bracing himself
,    - Will walks down the empty hallway
He glances back over his shoulder, where Chet walks several feet behind him
Yes, 'm still here
really am this stupid
Just pay attention to where you're going
think  can handle it
These floors get waxed once a week
On Tuesday, which today is
You hit a slick patch, trip and fall, and got a classroom full of kids wearing their skin inside out
Chet, 'm fucking nervous enough as it is
Please
don't need you back seat driving me right now
Obviously
Will stops, turns back toward Chet
Just for the record, this isn't a nuclear weapon strapped to my chest
And there are metal lockers on either side of the hallway
If  fall, and if this thing goes off, 'm probably not taking out the whole school
Do you really want to debate this
Will sighs, turns back around
second later, the school bell rings and kids flood the hallway, changing classes
Will freezes
Multiple kids shove past him
Chet sweats bullets, gives Will a look of death
After a beat, the hallway empties again
38
You're an asshole
Whatever
It's over
Will continues walking
He tries to lighten the mood - Who was the chick in the white jeans
Kristi Evans
Why
You know why
Oh, come on
Just keep walking
The guys' voices fade as they continue down the hallway
Come on yourself
You knew exactly who  was talking about
Fuck you
She's in the eighth grade
bet you love it when she calls you Mr
Chet
She doesn't call me "Mr
Chet
" She's not a foreigner
- The guys get to Will's car
Chet wraps up a call on his cell - thanks so much, Mrs
Davis
'll call you after  talk to the doctor
Chet hangs up
He is standing by the passenger door
He looks over the roof of the car at Will
So, this is it
This is what
39
Once  step inside this car, 'm basically in a steel coffin with you and
that thing
And if it goes off, all they're gonna find in there are two charred bodies and pieces of a bomb
They'll assume we were driving to a government building to blow it up
It'll be all over the news
Next thing you now, some militia or Islam group is claiming us as members
My family will be humiliated
We'll also be dead, in that particular situation, so it won't really matter
Exactly
Will sighs
get it
Take your time, man
Will gets in the car and shuts the door
He looks out at Chet, who stands uncertainly by the passenger side
This is the world's biggest favor, you motherfucker
You didn't even help me move last winter
Chet reluctantly hops in
- Will fires up the engine
Given the situation,  think you should obey all traffic safety laws
Fine
Will pulls out of the school parking lot
Okay, so where are we going
have no idea
just got in your car
thought you had a plan
40
Well,  don't
've been sorta preoccupied with this crushing fear of death
No plan
can't say 'm surprised
Your plan is probably better
Just condescend me until  explode
Will goes to turn on the radio
Chet grabs his hand
Maybe we should turn on the radio
See if the signal sets the bomb off
That would be an interesting experiment
Will heaves a frustrated sigh
Chet eases up
Listen, let's just go back to my place
Figure out our options
Maybe you can get the vest off or something
just don't want to do anything stupid
Unless we have to
The car hits a rough pothole
Chet's heart skips a beat - Holy fucking shit
- and he throws himself against the passenger side window, as far from Will as the confines of the car will allow
Will slams the brakes
Stop it
You're scaring the fuck out of me
Okay
Okay
Fuck
Chet makes the sign of the cross
'm cool now
Will continues driving
Chet discreetly unlocks the passenger side door
41
Why did you do that
Do what
saw you
It's in case  have to jump out
If  survive the day, and you don't because you jumped out of a moving car and broke your neck, 'm gonna laugh my ass off
And if abandoning ship saves my life, then that laugh will be mine
The guys continue driving in silence
: 6 hours, 59 minutes
: , '  - The door is shut
Will sits on the toilet lid
He has the jacket off and we get our first complete look at the vest
The actual structure is composed of hollow metal tubes
The wiring that runs throughout the vest is messy and complicated, purposely so, to scare anyone out of fucking with it
Will is in the process of trying to contort his arm so he can slide the vest off
no luck
It's too tight
He is calling off toward the Where Chet is crouched in a corner, at the furthest point in the furthest room from the bathroom
He uses his laptop to look for websites on disarming a bomb
What if we try to separate your shoulder
42
(
) Fuck you
Well, all these sites say different shit
There's not a lot of consensus in the bomb disarming community
Will emerges from the bathroom, sliding the jacket back on
This is pointless
Chet shuts his laptop
agree
We gotta call the cops, have them fly in the bomb squad or something
We can't
These guys said they'd be following me
And  don't have a clue what they look like
For all know, they're outside right now
They see the cops show up, they blow the vest and cut their losses
Will stares at Chet, hopelessly overwhelmed
What do  do, man
What do  do now
don't know, Will
guess you gotta rob the bank
haven't been inside a bank in three years
How the fuck am  supposed to rob one
They wouldn't even give me a savings account
Will drops onto the couch and puts his head in his hands, fighting hysterics
Chet offers a stock reassurance - It's gonna be okay
No, it's not
'm gonna blow up
That's way worse than getting stabbed or shot
At least some people survive that
No one survives being blown up
() 43
(') No one is ever like, "Yeah,  heard Steve got blown up, tough break, but how's he doing now
Is he still in the Rec basketball league
" No of course he isn't, 'cause there's nothing left of Steve except a stain on the wall and a pair of fucking high tops
Chet looks on as his friend begins to sob
It's a crushing sight
Chet strides across the apartment - Pull yourself together
- and attempts to give him one of those "get a grip" slaps
But Will flinches and Chet slaps him right on the ear
Ow
Fuck
think you popped my eardrum
Sorry
Shit
didn't mean to do that
But just listen to me now
You're not gonna die
You wanna know why
Because you know exactly how to rob a bank
What are you talking about
Point Break
The movie
Yes
That movie is like a how-to guide for bank robberies
You just bust in
Masks
Guns
Move fast
Stick to the tellers and don't bother with the vault
Yeah
guess it's pretty simple, right
And it's just a local bank
The Donner-Wells on Charles Road
Really
applied for a job there like a year ago
44
You wanted to be a teller
Yeah, so what
It's a good job
You get benefits
Like what, a name tag
What kind of benefits do you get
Free toppings
That's really clever
No one ever said that shit to me before
Anyway, this is perfect
You know the whole layout of the bank
Not exactly
They didn't hand me the security schematics with the application
But  sat in the waiting area for like 20 minutes
know what the place looks like
How many guards
One
think
That's a start
It's a great start
You can do it
Will pauses
You're gonna do it with me, right
was actually gonna stick to giving tips, ideas
motivational speeches
More of a consultant or advisory role
Jesus Christ, Chet
Please
'm begging you here
need you on this
If  do it alone, 'm dead
45
Are you gonna cry again
That was a moment of weakness
() Yes
'll fucking cry again if that's what it takes
should make you blow me
Sure
Whip that shit out
'm actually kinda curious
wanna see if Jenny Rifkin lied to you
She obviously lied to me
Chet cracks a smile
All these guys want is 100 grand
We can do this
We're gonna rob a bank for 100 grand
Just leave the rest of the money sitting there
Why
don't know
guess they're very modest criminals
Who the fuck cares
Wait
you said "we" right
Chet heaves a sigh
'm putting my life on the line for 100 grand
what does 100 grand even buy these days
: 1997 As the car pulls into ,    - Where Juicy waits by the service entrance, smoking a cigarette
She spots the car and runs over
It parks and the door opens
glassy-eyed African-American man (30s) steps out
His muscled body is covered in calligraphic prison ink
This is
46
Juicy throws her arms around him
missed you so much, baby
You don't got enough dicks to keep you warm in that place
You know it's not like that
Those guys get Juicy, but you get Marisol
Well, Marisol
what  want is to get my money, kill that old ass man, then get the fuck out of here
Then that's how it's gonna go
We're just waiting on a call
Vaughn stares at her
This is my impatient face
Well,  think  can keep you entertained
Juicy gets in the open driver side door and makes a show of crawling over into the passenger seat
- Fluorescent lights and pop music
Will and Chet roam the aisles with a full shopping basket
They turn into the "Sports & Fitness" section, where they find a variety of air pistols
They are incredibly realistic, though clear and with orange nozzles
Should we go with the handguns
or the Uzis
Handguns
That's such a Murtaugh choice
: 47
check out conveyor belt, as the guys' purchases drift past: air pistols, spray paint, ski masks, leather gloves, several 5-Hour Energy drinks
The tough   looks at the guys with abject disgust
You sure you don't want to grab some condoms
Uh, no
Why
Because this is usually what men buy before they rape someone, and  want to make sure you all use protection
Lady, we're just
buying some stuff
Is that cash or credit for your rape kit
Will looks in his empty wallet, takes out a credit card
Chet grabs his hand
We'll pay cash
- The van is parked
Dwayne sits behind the wheel
Metallica's "Ride the Lightning" begins to play loudly
You really fucked up this mix tape
Dwayne ejects the tape, tosses it at Jay in the passenger seat
We're not speed freaks knocking off a 7-Eleven
We're masterminding a heist here
Sorry, Dwayne
That song just means a lot to me
Dwayne shakes his head
He turns and looks out the windshield: they're parked in the Walmart lot, watching the store entrance
wish he would hurry his shit up
48
You worried about that other guy he's with
No, man
He picked him up at a school
So long as there ain't any cops, he can take the whole town with him
just want my money
Dwayne surveys the area
Something catches his attention: the bland strip mall across the street
There's a Blockbuster, Subway, and an empty space in between
Dwayne smiles
What
You want me to run over to Subway, get us a couple sandwiches
If you had any vision, Jay, you'd know exactly what 'm thinking about right now
And it's not a sandwich
() Look how well trafficked that shopping mall is
It's the perfect place for the tanning salon
Jay checks it out, nods
Oh, you're totally right
've been thinking about it, and want you to start off working the counter
Sounds like a demotion, know, but it's an important position
Because we're gonna be using code words and shit
For example, if a customer walks in and says he wants a tan, that just means he wants a tan
But if he says he wants a "deluxe tan," that means a blow job and you gotta get one of the girls in there to suck him off
You with me
So far
But what if he wants a fuck
There's gonna be codes for everything: missionary, anal, black chicks got it all written down back home in my files
() 49
(') 'm not gonna bother getting into it with you right now, because you're supposed to be on lookout and you're no good at multitasking
Okay
'Cause they're about to get away
Dwayne spots the Mustang pulling away
Fuck
He throws the van into gear
-  - Will navigates the streets
Chet is in the back seat, where he has newspaper spread out and is spray painting the air pistols, and much of the car, black
Be careful, you're getting paint everywhere
Are you really worried about your upholstery right now
Yes, because if  survive this shit 'm quitting my job
That means 'll probably have to give up my place and 'll be sleeping in the back of my car, which you're covering in toxic paint
Chet touches up one of the guns, goes to flip it over
That side isn't dry yet
You're about to ruin it
It says it's fast drying
Fast isn't the same as instant
You gotta let it sit for like 20 minutes
How would you know
You do a lot of graffiti
50
No, but  spray painted my bike last year after  got my license suspended
didn't let it dry properly and fucked it up
We don't have time to sit around and literally watch paint dry
Aren't we going straight to the bank
was actually thinking we need to stop and steal a car first
Chet drops the spray paint, whirls on Will
What
No way
We've got a car
Yeah, my car
'm not gonna use it as a getaway vehicle
They can trace the plates
Even if we do get away, we'll be arrested
Well,  can't hotwire a fucking automobile, and neither can you
That's why  was thinking we'd steal one from your parents' friends
The Fishers
Remember how they used to pay us to clean their garage
They leave the keys in there
And they have a Datsun
That's a fast car
'm not stealing the Fishers' Datsun
Let's steal a car from your parents' friends
Will seethes
He whips the car over to the side of the road and gets in Chet's face
What friends
My parents don't have any
My dad moved away after your big mouth ruined his marriage and humiliated him, and no one wanted to hang out with the mom who everyone knew fucked a lifeguard
51
You never should have told me was 13 years old
couldn't process that kind of information
had to tell someone else
(shakes his head) Fuck
really am sorry about it
Okay
Despite what  said before
was just a kid, but  messed up
Okay
Chet looks at Will, expectantly
That's it
You're not gonna apologize for selling my Cal Ripken ball
Sure
'm sorry
'm sorry that my family was going through a rough patch and  was smoking a ton of weed and listening to the Wu Tang Clan all the time
And that  needed some extra dough to indulge my habit
Which, in hindsight, was probably just a cry for help
But you never even noticed
Thanks
Now  feel even worse
Will sits there, stewing for a moment
Then he softens - shouldn't have stolen the ball knew it was wrong and  regretted it like the next day
actually tried to buy it back but the guy wanted twice as much
had to smoke even more weed just to get past the whole shitty incident
guess that's why they call it a downward spiral
appreciate that you tried to buy it back
So, thanks
An awkward moment passes
We should probably get going
Will turns back around, goes to pull out without looking and - 52
horn blares as a speeding delivery truck barrels right at them
Will slams the brakes, barely avoiding a collision
Fuck
Fuck
just want this goddamn day to be over
As Chet continues to freak - : 5 hours, 15 minutes
: '  - Will keeps watch of the house
Chet squeezes through a garage window he has pried open
'  - Chet drops ungracefully to the floor, right beside a well maintained 1977 Datsun 240Z
Chet hurries over and unlocks the side door
Will enters, hauling the Walmart bag of supplies
He goes right for a set of hooks on the wall
The keys aren't here
They always used to leave the keys out
Yeah
When we were teenagers
This is fucked
Let's just find them
The guys ransack the garage
Chet knocks over a shelf full of clutter
Sorry
Will goes to the car and tries the handle
It's open
He scours the interior
You hear that
What
Chet peeks through the glass pane in the door
53
Mr
Fisher is coming
As he looks for an escape - Oh shit, oh shit
Are the keys in there
No
Will hops out of the car
He rifles through the Walmart bag
What are you doing
Will pulls the ski masks out of the bag, along with one of the freshly painted air pistols
'm doing what  have to
Will puts a ski mask on, then throws one to Chet
The door opens and
(60s) enters
Chet quickly pulls down his mask
It's backwards
Will levels the pistol - Oh, Jesus
Mr
Fisher braces himself against a wall
Chet fumbles to turn his mask around
Will affects a deep voice - Where are the car keys
They're in my pocket
'm just reaching in my pocket for the keys
Quiet down and do it already
Mr
Fisher reaches into his pocket and produces the keys
They jingle as he holds them out in his trembling hand
Will snatches them
Now listen,  don't want you to report this car stolen or anything until later tonight
Let's say 5 o'clock
6 to be safe
54
Sure
Anything you say
Will seems unconvinced
He looks to Chet, who shrugs
Will turns back to Mr
Fisher and gestures violently with the gun - If you fuck with us,  swear, will
will shoot your son
Taylor
know where he works
At the fucking travel agency
He's the douchebag with the bangs
() Please no
won't do anything won't
Just leave Taylor alone
'm gonna trust you
But if you call the police, there's gonna be an undertaker styling his stupid fucking bangs
() Now open the garage door
Mr
Fisher hits a switch that raises the garage door
Chet grabs their stuff and gets in the passenger side
Will backs toward the driver side
The car's insured, right
Mr
Fisher nods
Okay
feel better
Worse comes to worst, something happens to it, you can get a Honda
This thing doesn't even have airbags
Please, just go
Will slides into the car and starts it up
'  - The car peels away
-  - The guys yank off their ski masks
55
That old man's got a heart condition
You could have killed him
My hand was forced
Chet tries to get comfortable in the seat
Awesome
'm stuck inside an even smaller car with you and a bomb
Will works the manual transmission
He steps on the gas
This thing's got some pickup
Could you just take it easy, we're doing fine on time
know
but there's one last stop we have to make
Do you have to take a piss first
Because  do
Will nervously drums his fingers on the steering wheel, trying to figure out how to say - need to see your sister
Are you for real
Did you really just ask me that
You salt-in-an- open-wound motherfucker
Chet, as if it isn't apparent,  may die today
'll probably die today
And if there's one small thing that's clear to me now, it's that 've wasted two and a half decades as a pussy, watching everything  want pass me by
don't wanna peace out of this world as a pussy
need to tell her how  feel
You're really gonna turn this into some sort of dying wish bullshit
56
Yes,  really am
It means that much to me
am not fucking around here
don't think you are
mean, apparently, you love my sister so much that you're willing to put her life in danger by going to see her with a bomb strapped to your chest
She won't be in danger
promise
got it all worked out
And you can even take a piss while 'm inside
- The Datsun pulls around and parks in back
the minivan parking across the street
- Dwayne and Jay watch Will hurry out of the Datsun
Where the fuck is he going
What's in there
Some sort of  headquarters
told that guy not to fuck around
Dwayne pulls out his cell phone, punches in the speed dial code
His finger hovers above the send button
Maybe  should give that bomb a call
No
Let me just go see what he's up to
Dwayne smirks
was just fucking around
Are you gay for this guy or something
just wanna get the money, Dwayne
Same as you
All right
Then man up and go check it out
As Jay reaches for the door handle - 57
Don't even tell me you're about to do a reconnaissance without a cover
What's you cover
don't know
'm from the telephone company
Yeah, nice fucking uniform
Dwayne rummages in the back of the car, produces a shopping bag and starts filling it with random clothes strewn across the car
He shoves the bag at Jay
You're a personal shopper
You're delivering the latest fashions to Mr
Quilby in marketing
Got it
Jay nods, hops out with the bag and slams the door
Dwayne looks down at the cell phone in his hand, twirls it as he hums a revival song
sings the lyrics, softly - "He's got the whole world in his hands
He's got whole fucking world in his hands
" ,   - Will runs up the stairs, a phone pressed to his ear - no, 'm here right now
(
) ( ) Why are you acting so strange
Because strange shit is going on
'll explain everything
Just meet me where  texted you
(
) - Please
Just do it
58
,   - You can see the entire shitty town from up here
The access door opens and Kate emerges, wind tousling her short hair
( ) Will
Will waves at her from where he is standing, way across on the other side of the roof
Kate starts toward him
Stop
Will takes out his cell phone and dials
Kate's phone rings
She answers it, confused
What are you doing
We  on Will
We can see Kate, standing 30 feet away, but her voice comes over Will's cell phone, with a delay that is slightly jarring
Just don't come any closer
Why not
What's going on
'm gonna give you the short version of an incredibly complicated and fucked up situation, so please be cool
() Some very bad guys strapped a bomb to my chest and they are forcing me to commit a crime
Will,  swear, if this is - wish  was joking, but 'm not know it's a lot to swallow, but you gotta take it on face value, because there's a timer attached to this thing and it's counting down
Kate's voice falters - Oh my god, Will
we'll get help
'll get you help
59
didn't come here for help
'm taking care of it
came here because, should things not work out today as  would like them to, want you to know why  was doing the things  did
Please, just let me call someone
Let me do something
This is crazy
don't disagree with you
It's fucking nuts
But that's not even what this is about
() Do you remember when you found that picture in my car of you, me and Chet, with Chet cut out of it
Will,  can't remember about some stupid picture while you're - need you to remember about the picture, and about how  stop by your office every Friday, and how 've always hated all your boyfriends, and how the two girls 've ever seriously dated have looked like less attractive versions of you
() Do you see where 'm going with this
love you Kate
have for a very long time
Kate is barely holding it together
Will, this is a lot you're putting on me
You just told me people are trying to kill you or something, and now you say you love me
What the fuck is going on
whole lot of shit
'm sorry to do this to you, but  was afraid 'd never get the chance to tell you
And know you have feelings for me, too
Maybe you feel for me the way you feel for a good friend, or - if the world fucking hates me - a brother
() 60
(') But what  hope is that you don't really know how you feel for me, and that maybe when you figure it out you'll realize it's the same way  feel for you
Does that make any sense
Yes
mean, 've known you forever
It's not an easy thing to figure out
don't need an answer now
Just think about it
And no matter what you decide, you're too good for assholes like Mark and the rest of them
Kate manages a small, stifled laugh
Okay
will process all of this
It's just, the bomb - It's distracting
know
Anyway, 'd love to stay and talk some more, but  can't
gotta ask you to leave now, because 'm running out of time
Kate nods
Will hangs up the phone
She turns back toward the access door, stops
She yells across the roof at Will - If  had time to think about it
'd probably tell you that 've always felt very strongly for you
And 've never thought of you as a brother
Will smiles, yells back - That's a huge relief
Don't say anything else
just really don't want to die now
Try not to
Please
Kate turns and continues to the access door
61
,   - Jay paces about the landing that leads up to the roof
He hears the door opening and hurries down to the entrance for the nearest floor
He tries the door, but it's locked
Kate enters the stairwell from the roof access door and spots Jay trying to force the door open
She is holding back tears
He just looks incredibly confused
'm, uh
'm a personal shopper
'm looking for Mr
Quilby
'm sorry,  don't know who that is
Kate continues down the stairs, tears coming now
Jay waits a beat, then hurries down and tries the door on the next level, which is open
- Jay jumps in the van, huffing and puffing
So
It was just his girlfriend or something
Getting one last blow job in case he don't make it
kinda like this guy
- Will, galvanized by the exchange, hops inside
Did you tell her how you saw her naked when she was 13
That always works
said my piece
She's gonna think about it
Shut up
She was freaked out
Yes
By the bomb
By you
62
Would it be so bad if we ended up together
You and  would be family
don't want you in the family
You bring very little to the table want her to be with someone awesome
pro quarterback
war hero
At the very least, someone 've never watched porn with
Well, now it's up to her
Not if  set that bomb off myself
Then you'd probably never get to rob a bank
Will throws the car into gear and pulls away
: 4 hours, 10 minutes
: , -   - The Datsun is parked in the half-full lot
The guys lean against the driver side, with their backs to the bank and the car providing cover
They each have a spray painted air pistol tucked into their pants
You go for the money
'll cover the crowd
In and out
Chet clasps his hands around his stomach
'm not feeling so good
drank like three of those 5-Hour Energy drinks
It's just nerves
Let's pull our shit together and do this thing
Chet reigns it in
The guys slide on the leather gloves and rolled up ski masks
They turn and stride toward the bank
The guys stop as they get to the door
They pull the ski masks down and take out their air pistols
63
What should  call you in there, like if  need to ask you to do something
Call me Tivon
You'll be Darius
can tell you're not a black guy through the ski mask
Fine
Then you'll be Luis and 'm Cruz
We're two loco motherfuckers and that's the way we gotta roll when we get in there
-   - It's business as usual for a dozen  and about as many
They all just want to get done with their shit and go home, when - Will and Chet burst through the bank doors, guns in hand
Everybody put your hands in the air
No, get on the ground
Actually, listen to him and get on the fucking ground
Will and Chet are on an adrenaline high, waving their guns everywhere
People scream
Shut up
Please
Will frantically scans the panicked crowd for - The   (40s), rail thin and jumpy
Will points his gun right at him
You, just stand right there and don't do shit
The rest of you get the fuck down
Spread your arms and legs
Why is no one listening to me
Just take it easy, man
64
Don't be a hero, cowboy
What the fuck does that mean
'm not a hero
Or a cowboy
As people drop to the ground, whispering nervously to one - Chet rushes the  standing behind the bulletproof glass partition
All of you, back away from the counter and get out here
Anyone pushes a button and one of these people gets totally shot
The Tellers hurry into the main area of the bank and get onto their stomachs
Will looks to the Guard
Very slowly, take out your gun and toss it away
The Guard takes out his gun, lays it on the ground and shoves it away
The gun slides across the waxed floor and - Right into the outstretched hand of a sobbing  (40s), whose  (11) lies beside her in a soccer uniform
Oh, god
don't want the gun
( ) What the fuck
Did you do that on purpose
It was an accident
Are you guys working together
No
Please take this gun away
Just toss it, lady
65
The Mom slides the gun away like it were on fire
It skids all the way across the floor, slams hard against a wall and '  (
) Ah
has been shot
He clutches his thigh
think she got the femoral artery
'm sorry
It was an accident
Fuck you
Who slides a gun like that
Mommy, what's happening
Christi, be quiet
These men are dangerous
Chet turns ashen
He moves close to Will, whispers urgently - This is fucked
That dude is gonna bleed out and we're gonna go to prison
Just calm down
Why is no one getting me help
Is anyone here a doctor
Nothing
Just the heavy breathing of many frightened people
Will hurries over to the Fat Man, who is bent over, hugging his leg
Sir, let me see where you're hit
Just call me an ambulance
Calm down, sir
66
The Fat Man sits up, removes his hand from his leg
Will nervously takes a look
There is only a small amount of blood
It's just a flesh wound
You're gonna be okay
But it hurts so bad
You got shot, man
It's not supposed to feel good
But you're gonna be fine
And you'll have a great story to tell everyone
This is an awful story
This isn't a bank error in my favor
got shot
Point taken
Luis, how we doing on the money
Chet snaps back to attention - Oh, shit
Sorry, Cruz
Chet picks out the most harmless looking teller, a mousy 20- something girl, and helps her up off the ground
He checks her name tag:
Hey, Sandra
know you're probably scared right now, but if you go grab us 100 grand in a bag, we'll get out of here
This will all be over and you'll be fine
You trust me
Sandra nods
Chet smiles, reassuringly
She hurries behind the counter, starts filling a bank bag with cash, as - My leg really hurts
Can you please hurry up, Sandra
Sandra emerges from behind the partition with the bank bag
Will grabs it
He takes a last look at the people spread across the floor
67
'm really sorry, everyone
know we probably fucked up your day
(looks to Fat Man) 'm thinking of you in particular, sir
Actually, you know what
Will crosses to the Fat Man, offers the bank bag
Quickly
Peel a few bills
On me
Anyone rats him to the cops and 'm coming for you
remember faces
The Fat Man hesitantly reaches for the bag
Opens it - Red Dye explodes all over his face
He shrieks
Chet whirls on the teller
What the fuck was that about, Sandra
thought we had something going
What happened to trust
'm sorry
They make us do it
Could you kindly fill another bag
Not a bank bag
fucking garbage bag
And Luis, will you watch her this time
Sandra hurries back behind the partition with Chet
He dumps out the contents of a trash can, grabs the bag and watches closely as Sandra stuffs it with cash
Okay
That should be enough
Chet grabs the bag and hustles out toward Will
They are home free, until - They hear the wail of approaching sirens outside
They stop cold, panicked
Will whirls on the Tellers
Fuck
Which one of you assholes tripped the alarm
Was it you, Sandra
No
It was Mark
He pushed the button when you guys came in
Another teller, , looks up from the floor
68
Sandra, you bitch
Now they're gonna kill us both
Fuck you, Mark
You're the manager
Will loses his shit - Fuck both of you
Fuck all of you
'm a regular guy
Just like you
'm a regular guy and you fucked me
Thank you for fucking a regular guy
People are freaked out
Sandra is crying, thinking she will probably get shot now
Chet grabs Will and pulls him toward the door
Let's just get the fuck out of here
The guys slam through the doors, out into , -   - Just as a lone police cruiser screeches into the lot
Will and Chet make a run for it, but the cruiser cuts them off
(21), a jittery rookie, jumps out of the cruiser and levels his gun
The guys reflexively level theirs
Drop your weapons
Don't shoot us
Drop the guns or 'll have to
Chet looks at Will with utter desperation
In the distance, they hear the sirens of more cops approaching
Will tosses his gun, rips open his jacket and grabs a cluster of wires
Fuck you
You just brought a gun to a bomb fight, officer
pull these wires out and we all go
You got ten seconds to drop your gun and - Zurman doesn't stick around for the rest
He turns and sprints away
69
As the guys make for the Datsun - That was awesome
He was tempting a desperate motherfucker
The guys jump in the Datsun and peel out as two more police cruisers race toward the bank
The cruisers change course and give chase
The Datsun blows right by the parked - Dwayne watches as the cars speed off into the distance
Holy shit
Our boy is causing some serious mayhem
He's gonna get caught or killed
Dwayne whirls on Jay, punches him hard in the shoulder
Shut the fuck up
If you jinx this with your negativity, 'm gonna strap a bomb to your chest next
Jay massages his shoulder, pissed
Oh, yeah, who's gonna build it
You are
- Whiplash blur as the three cars race by, one after the other
Airborne leaves flutter in their wake
/
-  - Chet freaks out as they hurtle toward lunchtime traffic
Will weaves in and out of cars
Shit
This is not cool
Will is wild eyed, punching the gas
Chet's head is on a swivel
Behind them: police cruisers in hot pursuit
Up ahead: the world rushing at them at 80 mph, populated by nothing but potential collisions that will result in a fiery death
70
Maybe we should pull over and surrender
can outrun these guys
They're not the , they're local cops
Just shut up and let me concentrate
do this for a living
As they clip the side-view mirror off a Kia - You don't do anything like this for a living
am not a pizza,  am a man
The cruisers are gaining ground, throttles wide open
Will downshifts, spiking the RPMs into the red, as he banks a hard right and - The Datsun explodes onto a crowded street crossing an intersection jump out of its way
The cruisers take the turn into town
One makes it
The other slams into parked cars
/
-  - Will jumps the curb to avoid slow-moving traffic, slams into a newspaper dispenser
It flips up onto the hood and crashes into the windshield, where it stays lodged
Holy fuck
Will veers back into the street and blindly plows ahead as cars he cannot see swerve to avoid him
He finally slams the brakes, the momentum knocking the dispenser loose and launching it onto the sidewalk, scattering Pedestrians
Chet whirls around to see the cruiser flying right at them
Go
Go
Go
Will steps on the gas
The light ahead turns red
Stop
Stop
Stop
71
Will rolls the dice and blows through the intersection
He's lucky
The cruiser behind him is not
It's -boned by traffic in a brutal, crunching collision
/
-  - The cruiser wreckage disappears in the rear-view mirror as Will floors it toward a green light
That guy got fucked up
In the rushing moment as they cross the intersection, Chet glimpses the other cruiser barreling toward his side of the car from the perpendicular street
He has a millisecond, maybe, to process their impending doom, and then - The cruiser smashes into the back passenger side of the car
- The Datsun is sent spinning like a fucking top
Its ruined back wheel catches, sending the car tumbling onto its roof
/
-  - Madness
The guys scream as the car continues to slide, upside down, out of control
As it slams into a row of parking meters, the world goes Will blinks back to reality
He's hanging, inverted, by his seat belt
The car is a pool of shattered glass
It twinkles up at him
Hours could have passed, but it's only been seconds
He sucks in air
Satisfied that he is, in fact, still alive, he looks over at - battered and bruised Chet, head drooping straight back
Chet
Are you okay
Chet
() Oh my god
Talk to me
thought you were gonna blow up
Will's hands go to the bomb
still intact
72
No
Luckily your side took most of the impact
Awesome
We gotta keep moving
Will unclicks his seat belt and falls to the roof of the car
He moves to Chet, unclicks his belt and helps him down
- Will emerges from the overturned car
He drags Chet out, along with the bag of cash
He glances up to see the who crashed into them stumbling out of his own ruined car, which has turned a fire hydrant into a geyser
Another cruiser races to the scene
Oh, fuck, man
Come on
Will pulls Chet to his feet and they take off, rounding a - As Will huffs and puffs - Chet
don't know how to tell you this
but you got a piece of the car in you
What
In your back
Chet glances back to see a jagged piece of metal sticking out of his shoulder blade
Ah
Get it out
will
Do it now
73
All right
Without breaking stride, Will yanks the piece of metal out of Chet's back
He screams
Is it rusty
Am  gonna get tetanus
Behind them, two Officers turn into the alley in full sprint
They are way faster than the guys and soon gain on them
Will can barely keep up with Chet
Why are you moving so slowly
It's a combination of cheap sneakers and this heavy fucking bomb on my chest
They burst out of the alley, onto - The guys frantically search for an escape, spot - bus pulling up to a stop down the street
They sprint for the the bus, peeling off their ski masks and waving as it lazily rolls away from the stop
Hey
Over here
The bus slows and the guys trip over each other to board it
-  - The guys fall into seats, gasping for air, a complete mess
Will looks out the window to see the Officers emerge from the alley and look around for them
- crowd has grown around the crash sites
Fire trucks and ambulances are on the scene
Dwayne and Jay make their way through the crowd, trying to see what's what
Dwayne approaches a
You hear what happened to the guys they were after
74
Sounds like they got away
Dwayne and Jay beam
- The guys are covered in sweat as they hike along, eyes on the lookout
They arrive at Will's parked Mustang
Will hugs the car
never thought 'd see you again
thought you hated this car
It's actually not that bad
You know, as compared to that Datsun
The Mustang's got more comfortable seats
And it never would have flipped over
- The guys get in
They sit there for a moment, silent except for their heavy breathing
Will's eyes go to the garbage bag sitting between them
There's a 100 grand in there
100 fucking grand
Which we stole
From a bank
told a bunch of people  was gonna shoot someone
was like "you fucking move, and  will kill you where you stand
" threatened to blow up a cop
() And you never said " will kill you where you stand
" know
But shit did get pretty crazy
Yeah, it did
Will starts to get a little emotional
75
You know, there's no one  would have rather taken down a fucking bank with
mean that
Chet smiles
Me, neither
And as for all that shit  said
and all that shit  did
hope you can forgive me
We've been friends for so long, and  guess you hurt the people you're closest to the most
messed up, too
'm a dude who slept with his best friend's ex- girlfriend, and destroyed his parents' marriage, and sat on the sidelines watching his downward spiral
'm a shitty human being
But 'm glad you know that now, because you can accept me for who  am
do
accept you
Because you accept me
Will goes in for a hug
Chet gets lost in the moment, before recoiling
Woah
You still got a bomb on you
You're right
Let's take care of that
But you owe me a hug
Will pulls the slip of paper Dwayne gave him from his pocket
It's all gravy from here
Will takes out his cell and dials the number
: - Dwayne and Jay cross toward a McDonald's
Dwayne stops and answers his vibrating cell phone
76
This who  think it is
(
) Can't you hear the ticking in the background
You know, you're a pretty funny guy
(
) Thanks
'm happy to entertain a complete psychopath
Now wait a second, you're the murderer
(
) What's that supposed to mean
One of those cops who wrecked his car chasing you
he ain't breathing no more
Will goes white, covers the phone and whispers to Chet - We killed a cop
You were driving
'm just an accomplice
They're gonna hunt us down and kill us
Cops don't take this shit lightly
bet he had like eight kids
We have to find them and support his family forever
Dwayne is holding back laughter
Finally bursts out
(
) What's so fucking funny
'm just messin' with you
You didn't kill anyone
How'd a moron like you manage to rob a bank
(
) Jesus
Can we just get this over with
Where do you want the money
77
There's a boarded up gas station out on Commerce Avenue, past the highway
Be there in 30 minutes
(
) 'll be there in ten
Then you'll be standing around with your dick in one hand, and my money in the other
Dwayne hangs up
He dials another number - Yo, Juicy, wrangle your boy
Money's on its way
- The Mustang shrieks past us
: 2 hours, 58 minutes
: ' - Dwayne and Jay sit at a table with a fast food feast spread out
Dwayne eats a Big Mac, a look of utter satisfaction on his face, a man whom the gods have finally smiled down upon
remember the summer after my mother passed was the first year they had the Monopoly game at McDonald's musta come here three times a day trying to collect all the game pieces
Packed on 20 pounds, got acne from all the grease
The Major said  was the fattest, ugliest 13-year-old he ever laid eyes on
But  didn't care, just wanted to win the money and get the fuck out of there
So, one night,  followed this skinny register kid home, jumped him
kept whaling on him, asking him where they were hiding the Park Place piece
The million dollar prize
But he didn't know shit
year later, The Major won the lotto
asked him for a Sega Genesis
He bought me one of those paddles with the ball attached
78
Dwayne goes for a fry, sees his carton is empty and grabs a handful of Jay's
'm not ashamed to admit that 've gone through some dark times since then
Depression
Addiction to a variety of shit, which  won't go into
know you must think that's pretty silly, especially since you manage to get through the day and you don't got shit going on as compared to me
But that's just the way it is
That's life
Jay looks pretty affected that Dwayne is opening up to him
You know, 've been pretty low, too
if you ever want to talk about that kinda stuff
No
don't
My whole point  was trying to make before you interrupted me was that that shit is all in the past
'Cause  did it
finally pulled it off
We pulled it off, Dwayne
The two us
We're a good team
Are we
Would you do anything to protect me, my money, my empire
Yeah, sure
() mean, like what kinda stuff are we talking about
Dwayne takes out his cell, keys in the speed dial code and slides the cell across the table to Jay
Would you push the button
Why would you want me to do that
It's just a question, Jay
Would you
If  asked you
() 79
(') mean, it's no different than those watermelons
Watermelons aren't alive
Yeah, they are
Not the ones you blew up, though
Dwayne stares hard at Jay
tense beat
No one gets hurt
right, Dwayne
Oh, yeah
forgot about that part
Dwayne cracks a smile
Anyway, he hasn't even made the drop yet
'm gonna go take a shit
Stay away from the bathroom
Someone could get hurt
Dwayne heads off
Jay eyes the cell phone he has left behind
- Weeds have overtaken the abandoned place
Will leans against his parked car, waiting
Chet is nowhere to be seen
Will spots Vaughn's Sentra approach
It pulls into the station and Vaughn steps
He could not look more menacing
Juicy hangs back in the passenger seat
Where are the other guys
'm the only guy
() You got it
Will picks up the garbage bag at his feet and walks it over to Vaughn
He opens it, looks in
What the fuck did you do
rob a bank
80
() Yes
Vaughn grins
Now where's the code
don't have any code
Vaughn turns to leave
Will grabs his arm
Vaughn stops, looks purposefully down at Will's hand
Will draws back
Listen, man,  just want the code
don't know what the fuck you're talking about
The code for the fucking bomb
Will opens his jacket
Vaughn takes a sudden step back
What kind of stupid motherfucker wears a bomb to a drop
Your boss put this on me
am my boss
Then give me the code
Motherfucker,  don't know no goddamn code
Whoever told you  did, lied to you
Now step the fuck off, or 'll shoot you in the face so you don't explode and mess up my boots
Vaughn goes to leave again
Will runs ahead of him and gets in his way
If you don't have the code,  want that money back
81
The only way you're getting this money back is if you kill me
You don't know what 've gone through for that money
In an instant, Vaughn has his gun out, aimed at Will's head
Do  look sympathetic
Now step the fuck aside
- Juicy looks on with interest as Vaughn holds Will at gunpoint
Then she spots - Chet creeping up behind Vaughn, from wherever he was hiding, clutching a large metal pipe
Juicy jumps out of the Sentra
Vaughn, look out
Vaughn whirls around toward Chet, just in time to have his gun arm smashed by the pipe
The weapon drops from his hand
Chet takes another swing, cracking Vaughn across the face
He howls, blood spraying, and topples over
Chet goes for another swing, when - Juicy jumps on him, wildly biting and clawing
Will grabs the back of Juicy's track jacket for leverage and flings her away
She hits the back of the Sentra and careens clear across the trunk
Let's go
Will grabs the money
Chet kicks Vaughn's gun into the bushes
The guys break for the Mustang and get in
Juicy gets to her feet, runs right by a dazed Vaughn and after the car, which pulls out into the road and leaves her behind, screaming and cursing
-  - Will's mind is racing
82
What the fuck was that
They tried to screw us
You're a liability
They were just gonna let you blow up
Not with the money they won't
'   - tidy space, filled with various half-finished devices, action figures and heavy metal posters
low mechanical hum registers
Dwayne sits on a stool in the center of the garage, while Jay carefully trims his hair with an electric clipper
Dwayne holds up a mirror to check out his work
Never comes out this nice when  do it myself
You might wanna take some more off the top, though
wanna look real professional when  go down to the morgue to identify the body
Dwayne's phone chimes from a nearby counter
He grabs it, looks at the incoming number, slightly concerned
He answers - You drop the money yet
: -  - Will yells into the phone - No
've still got the money
And cracked your friend's face open
(
) Why the fuck would you do that
You lied
You said 'd get the code
Dwayne is panicked, covers badly - gave him the code
He told me he committed it to memory
() 83
(') He was probably just embarrassed that he forgot it
'll call him up and - (
) You didn't give him shit
want the code now or you'll never see this money
Hold on there, big man
You got a bomb on you
got a cell phone that detonates it
You're not exactly negotiating from a position of leverage
(
) 'm holding the money
blow up, and it blows up
Who has the leverage now
Go ahead and push the button, you idiot
Chet freaks out - Don't tell him to push the button
Pull over
Pull over
Dwayne is getting pissed off
Why don't you watch what the fuck you say
own you
tell you to rob a bank, and you rob a bank tell you to give me the money, and you give me the goddamn money and hope  show you some mercy
(
) 'm tired of this bullshit
'm already dead, right
So fuck you
At least 'll die rich
can't say the same for you
The line goes dead
Dwayne tears off his haircut smock
That piece of shit hung up on me
-  - Chet grabs the wheel and forces Will to pull over
Get me out of this car
84
- Chet jumps out while the Mustang is still slowing down
He runs 20 yards away
Will turns the car off and gets out
That was colossally stupid
It was a negotiation tactic
He'll call back and  won't answer
Then he'll call back and  will answer, and he'll realize the only way he gets the money is if he gives me the code
Sure
That seems like a perfectly logical pattern of thought
bet that's exactly what he'll do
'   - Dwayne tries Will's phone again
It goes to voicemail
He explodes like a pack of Mentos in a two-liter of Diet Coke
Throws his cell across the room
Overturns a work table
Does this guy know who the fuck  am
Jay retreats into a corner
Dwayne's a big boy, and he soon tires himself out, hunches over, panting
Dwayne
you never told me you weren't going to give him the code
We're not amateurs
He was a loose end
let him live, someday  woulda been walking out of my mansion and
bam
, , , all converging on my front lawn, 'cause a loose end turned state's evidence and they got what they need to put me away
Dwayne shakes his head
Starts digging through the mess he's made
finds his phone
Fuck it, Jay
'll just kill The Major myself
Dwayne keys in the speed dial code
85
Don't do it
Dwayne looks down at the send button
You know what they say about a tree falling in the forest
Maybe the same thing applies to blowing up some motherfucker across town
Maybe it doesn't even make a sound
Dwayne hits send
Boom
But Dwayne notices something
the phone in his hand is ringing
He puts it to his ear
The line connects - (
) Hello
who is this
hello
Dwayne snaps the phone shut, looks to Jay, who tries to will the beads of sweat back into his pores
Who did  just call, Jay
'Cause she sounded cute for a bomb
( ) Gina Kim
My seventh grade crush
Or whoever lives in Gina Kim's house now
Where's the number for the bomb
In my head
switched it out of your phone while you were taking a shit
You're out of control, Dwayne
'm in perfect control
Dwayne charges Jay
Jay holds up the hair clippers like a weapon, flicks them on
Dwayne rips the cord out of the wall, uses it to yank the clippers from Jay's hand, then whips him with the cord
Stop it
86
Dwayne goes to whip Jay again, but Jay moves like a jack rabbit and delivers a fierce kidney shot
Dwayne stumbles backward, falls onto the couch, groans - You asshole
make you my partner and you pull this shit
'm tired of you pushing me around all the time
What kinda partner does that
Fuck you
'm gonna piss blood, aren't
That's what it said on the internet
Dwayne's phone rings in his pocket
Go on
Get it out for me
can barely move
Jay pulls the cell from Dwayne's pocket
opens it and puts it to his ear so he can answer - Glad you came to your senses
: - Vaughn has a rag pressed to his swollen, bloody face
Juicy is nearby, banged up and dirty
Vaughn yells into his cell - Who the fuck do you think you're talking to
(
) honestly don't know
Let me give you a hint: your boy just jumped me, tossed my bitch like a rag doll and split with the cash
Dwayne realizes who's on the other line, recovers - That guy's not my boy
He's a dick
'm sorry for all the, uh, confusion
87
(
) Confusion
The only motherfucker that's confused is you
Apparently, you think you can fuck me and survive the day
wasn't fucking you,  was fucking him
You gotta understand, you're like a pawn in a much larger game 'm playing here
(
) Did you just call me a pawn, you stupid fuck
didn't mean it like that
'm just juggling a whole lot of shit
(
) want my money
Right now
That may not be possible
() just want to put this out there, to keep you in the loop
but  may need to bump the hit
Vaughn paces, furious
This isn't a reservation at Sizzler
You don't "bump" it
want you to bring me my money right now, to where am standing in this shit hole town, bleeding from the motherfucking face
(
) don't exactly have the money
give me some time and - The deal's off
You just became the hit
Vaughn hangs up, tosses the bloody rag to the ground and screams in frustration
He lives with his daddy
You already got the address
88
'   - Dwayne looks down at his phone
That's it
The assassin's gonna kill me now
'm gonna die
Game fucking over
Dwayne cradles his arms around his wounded kidney, rocks back and forth, wallowing in defeat
We can still get him the money
Try the pizza guy back
Why
So he can fuck around again, and  wind up dead, anyway
No
'd rather just sit here
want to die right here on this couch
No
We're gonna get that money
Just like we planned
All we gotta do is get the leverage back
How do we do that
Pizza boy's obviously got some kinda death wish
Jay gathers his resolve
We take the girl
The one he went to see
Then he won't try shit
Dwayne looks up at Jay with something not unlike awe
That's actually
that's a great fucking idea, Jay
It's the best idea anyone's had all day
Dwayne lowers his head
He removes the gun from his belt
holds it out to Jay
Jay takes it
Feels its weight
Then offers it back
was just trying to figure out how you would do it, Dwayne
Dwayne takes the gun
Struggles to stand
Jay helps him
89
Ok
Then let's do it right
We leave nothing to chance
Because if we go to prison for this,  won't be able to watch out for you
Ok, Dwayne
Dwayne looks over at a frame backpack hanging from a hook on the wall
piping bulges from it
You should probably bring the flamethrower, buddy
There's gonna be some evidence to dispose of
- Will and Chet sit on the ground, still 20 yards apart
Chet checks his watch
It's been half an hour
He'll call
In another 30 minutes 'm calling the bomb squad
Chet gestures to the vast emptiness all around them
These guys obviously aren't watching you anymore
You know, even if they get the bomb squad here in time, and they can somehow get this thing off me, we still gotta answer for the robbery
'll take the heat with you, Will
Nah
'll tell them  forced you into it
That you didn't have a choice
Thanks, man
90
Will looks at Chet for a beat
That's it
You're not gonna think about it a little longer
After all we went through
tear down the relationship, rebuild it
you're gonna let me go to prison alone
You offered
It was a test
Your grade:  minus
You know what the "" is for
To fuck myself
You passed that test
Failed the important one
As the guys continue to argue - : 1 hour, 28 minutes
: ,   - Kate walks down a hallway, turns into an office
Two figures rush past from the intersecting hallway and duck behind a corner
Kate emerges from the office and continues into ' ,   - Kate goes to the mirror, checks herself out
She's been crying
She splashes water on her face, then enters a stall
The bathroom door opens and Dwayne and Jay enter
Dwayne pulls something hairy from his pocket
Inside the stall, Kate reaches for some toilet paper
from underneath the barrier, she notices two pairs of dirty, masculine sneakers
Her breath goes shallow
She takes out her cell, quietly opens it
She presses the first 9 in "911," but her keypad volume is on and the phone makes a dull, electronic beep that echoes in the quiet bathroom
(
) Why don't you just slide the phone under the door, so  don't have to kick it open and see you with your panties down
91
Kate slides the phone out
One of the sneakers crushes it
She gets off the toilet, arranges her clothing and steps out out of the stall
She gasps at - The two ominous men standing there in gorilla masks
Dwayne's gun is plainly visible, tucked into the front of his pants
What's the quietest way out of the building
'Cause  might get excited in a confrontation, and you might wind up shot in the face
,   - The Major is watching reruns of Three's Company
He doesn't laugh or remotely smile at any of it
The subtle click of a door opening does not escape his finely tuned senses
Dwayne
Nothing
The Major gets up and goes to a desk, rifles through a drawer and pulls something out
simple pen
He clutches it like a weapon
,   - The Major creeps along
(
) Just stay where you are, old man
The Major turns to find Vaughn pointing a gun at him
'm looking for your son
Even if  knew where he was, wouldn't tell you nothing
Don't be stupid
You know,  saved a black man's life in the shit
So if  took yours 'd be even
see where your son gets his common sense
() 92
(') But you might want to readjust your attitude, because  ain't fucking around
want Dwayne
don't know why you'd want to protect him, the motherfucker hired me to kill you
If this news has any effect at all on The Major, he doesn't show it
Just tell me where he is
Vaughn pulls back the hammer of his gun
You think 'm scared of death
There's a whole generation of gooks that think 'm the grim reaper
Vaughn shakes his head
Almost imperceptibly, The Major repositions the hand with the pen in it
Vaughn is about to squeeze the trigger - But The Major beats him to it, clicking the pen, which is actually a pen gun
It fires a
22 caliber round into Vaughn's neck
He drops the gun and clutches the geyser of blood
The Major charges Vaughn, jumps on him and wrestles him to the ground, trying to jam the pen into the wound in his neck
'll ride you all the way to hell
know exactly how to get there
Vaughn reaches for his gun
His fingers curl around it and he whips it across The Major's face, knocking him backwards
Vaughn scrambles to his feet, gun pointed at the felled Major
What now, old man
You can't kill me
None of y'all can kill me
The Major looks up at Vaughn, once again face to face with a loaded weapon
Go on and - The Major goes limp, one searing hole in his chest
93
Vaughn clasps a hand to his neck to staunch the flow of blood
He steps over the The Major's body and continues upstairs
,   - Vaughn rifles through the cabinets, dumps all of the first aid supplies into the sink
He gets to work on his wound
' ,   - The locked door is kicked open
Vaughn, neck crudely bandaged, flicks on the lights and looks around the childish room
Chinese Fighting Fish swim in a large tank, seem to stop and look out at him like guard dogs
Vaughn ransacks the place
He finds a desk drawer locked
Takes out his gun and blows it open
Vaughn pulls a stuffed file folder out of the drawer
Flips through it
It's full of details about Dwayne's plan, the tanning salon, etc
Motherfucker has lost his mind
He finds a map of the town in the file
Three locations are highlighted: the bank, the boarded up gas station, and the radio tower
on the radio tower
Vaughn stuffs the map into his pocket
He stops before leaving the room, turns and shatters the fish tank with the butt of his gun
Water spills out and the Chinese Fighting Fish flop onto the floor
As Vaughn lifts a boot to stomp them - - Will and Chet are still arguing - Look at the upshot, while you're behind bars you can finally finish your degree
If  was there, too, it would just be a distraction
Great idea, Chet
Thanks a lot
'll just sit here and figure out a fucking major
Will stews
After a beat, his hand goes to his pocket
It's vibrating
He pulls out his cell
Hey, it's them
94
Will answers - You ready to talk now
: -  - Dwayne drives with his cell pressed to his ear
Jay keeps watch on Kate in back
She is blindfolded, hands bound behind her back with duct tape
( ) Yeah, 'm ready to talk
want my money
Meet me back at the radio tower in 50 minutes
(
) 've barely got an hour left
That's the point
want you on a short leash
(
) Fuck that
Give me the code first
Then you can have your money
You'll just have to trust me when  say that  don't want it
Yeah, 'm sure
You just wanna go back to your fantastic life
Your great job
And that blonde bitch with the sexy voice
Will's mind jumps to the only logical conclusion
Roller coaster stomach drop
His voice cracks as he asks a useless - What the fuck is that supposed to mean
(
) It means that girl you paid a visit to today is sitting in the back of my van right now
And it ain't exactly consensual
Fuck you
You crossed a line
95
Dwayne just laughs, maniacally
There are no lines
There's just me and you and 100 thousand dollars
Once we get that shit in order, you can have her back, and your life, too
So you're gonna show up where say, when  say
Alone
And if you try anything stupid, the two of you will be delivering pizzas to Saint Peter
Let me talk to her
You got ten seconds
Dwayne hands the phone back to Jay, who puts it to Kate's ear
She is trembling
Will
(
) Kate, 'm so sorry
It's okay
'm fine
'm just really - Dwayne snatches the phone
She's just really gonna die if you fuck this up
Will absorbs this like a blow to the chest
The line disconnects
Fuck
What happened
They have Kate
What the fuck does that mean
They took her, man
They must have followed us to her office
96
Damn it
You had to go see her
'm sorry
messed up
finally messed up worse than  could have possibly imagined
We gotta get her back, Will
These guys are crazy
We still got the money
As long as we have that, she's alive
Come on
Chet grabs the bag of cash
They hustle into the car and it peels out, leaving behind a swirling cloud of dust
As the sun begins to set - : 58 minutes
: - Two menacing headlights come at us on the empty road
They -  - Vaughn holds up Dwayne's map as he drives
He seems to be on the right road, headed for the radio tower
He crumples the map and throws it in back
- The Mustang stops by the gate to the radio tower
Chet jumps out and disappears into the bushes
- The Mustang pulls up
Will gets out and looks around the deserted place
He holds up the money bag
'm here
In the shadow of the nearby shed, the minivan is revealed as its interior lights come on
The door opens and Dwayne emerges, in his mask
How much time you got left
97
Will takes off the jacket and tosses it to the ground
He looks at the timer
Ten minutes
Damn
Maybe we should just wait around for the money shot
The guys meet in a clearing
Dwayne nods at the bag
That the money
Maybe
Where's the girl
Dwayne grins
In the van
Maybe
Get her out here
You're wasting time
Will grips the bag close to him
Dwayne whistles
The minivan door opens and Jay steps out
Strapped to his back is the frame pack we saw at his workshop
long tube connects the pack to the handle of a metal pipe- like device in his hand
Jay helps Kate, still bound and blindfolded, out of the van
They approach Dwayne and take up position behind him
Will, are you there
'm here
It's gonna be okay
This is a fucking tearjerker
Just let her come over here
will
But you should know, my associate over there is packing a flamethrower
Jay aims the metal device he has been holding
He hits a button and a pilot light comes on
98
() Just do what we say
Don't mess around or anything
Unless either of you can outrun a 25- foot flame
(gestures to gun in his belt) Or a bullet
Dwayne roughly pulls Kate away from Jay and shoves her forward
Will grabs her, pulls her blindfold off and pushes her behind him
Get back
gave you the girl
Now give me the money
How about we get the code out of the way first, since this bomb happens to be ticking so close to all of us
Fair enough
Dwayne pulls a slip of paper from his pocket
() You ready to be a free man
Just give it to me
448921
Will keys in the numbers
The timer freezes and the lock at the hinge opens
Will carefully extricates himself from the vest
He lays it down on the ground and steps away from it
His shirt is drenched in sweat from where the bomb sat
Will takes a final look at the money bag, then throws it to Dwayne
He looks inside, smiles
Jay takes a peak
It's so fucking pretty, ain't it
Yeah
It's awesome
99
Dwayne looks up at Will
Okay, you can get out of here now
actually have this sneaking suspicion that once we turn around, you're gonna put a bullet in both of our backs - and this is just a guess - burn our bodies
They say great minds think alike
And in this case, so do we
figured as much
That's why  got a gun pointed at you, too
() got a sniper in the bushes locked on you right now
Do  look that dumb
can't tell, you're wearing a mask
Before Dwayne can react, he stops and blinks, something shining in his eyes
Hey
on your forehead
Dwayne's eyes turn upward, just barely making out the red dot that dances on his forehead
Son of a bitch
Well played
In the bushes, hidden from sight, Chet carefully aims his laser pointer at Dwayne's forehead
Will grins at Dwayne
We're gonna walk out of here now
If you shoot, my sniper shoots can't guarantee he'll get both of you
But he'll definitely get you
As Will turns away - 100
(
) Hold the fuck up
Vaughn emerges from the darkness
He looks at Will
Wasn't expecting to see you here
Without warning, Vaughn cracks Will over the head with the butt of his gun
He goes down hard
Kate screams
Vaughn points the gun at her and she shuts up
Dwayne steps forward with the bag
It's all good
We got your money
Nice mask, Dwayne
Now throw the money over here
Dwayne complies
As soon as the bag lands, Vaughn aims the gun at him
Hold up
You don't have to do this
just paid you
Kate looks on, terrified, an unconscious Will at her side
Vaughn's eyes burn a hole through Dwayne
've been hit with a pipe, shot with a pen, and wasted my whole motherfucking day
all because of you and this job
don't know what you're talking about
Just take the money
will
And then 'm gonna tie up the two loose ends in the gorilla masks
'm not a loose end
You're a fucking idiot
You are as loose as ends get
Panicked, Dwayne's eyes flash over to Jay, who tightens his grip on the flamethrower handle
Jay catches Dwayne's eye
Dwayne nods
Vaughn sees this
101
What the - Jay rears up with the flamethrower
Vaughn couldn't be more surprised to see the device Jay is holding spit a massive ball of fire at him
Vaughn dives to the ground, fires off two wild shots, one of - Nails Dwayne in the shoulder, spinning him backward and knocking him off his feet
Kate recoils in horror as: Vaughn scurries madly on the ground, intermittently firing, while Jay screams and tries to torch him with the 25-foot flame
hand touches Kate's shoulder and she whirls around to find - Chet
What are you doing here
Not now
We gotta take off
( ) Where's Will
Kate looks to the empty spot beside her where Will just was
Flames inches from him, Vaughn lines up a desperate shot - Good news: the bullet only grazes Jay's side
Bad news: it keeps going and punches through the flamethrower backpack, which happens to be filled with gasoline, which happens to have an incredibly low flash point
So the spark from, say, a bullet, would cause Meanwhile, Will pops up behind Chet and Kate, clutching the garbage bag
got the money
Let's get the fuck out of here
They take off toward Will's car
Dwayne groggily comes to
no , just a ringing
The first thing he sees: Vaughn storming toward him, god-knows- what spewing from his mouth
Vaughn levels his gun - It doesn't make a sound for two reasons
The second being that it's out of bullets
Dwayne fumbles for his own hardware
Muzzle flash
102
Vaughn drops to his knees
Pulse snatched from him
to the tune of Jay's screams
Dwayne looks over to see his friend in flames, flailing his arms and shrieking
Dwayne's head snaps to the other side, where he sees the Mustang's tires peel
He tears off his mask, frantically looks around
The money is gone
No
Jay disentangles himself from the backpack, the source of the flames, but his clothes are now ablaze
In his frenzy, he somehow manages to string together two coherent words - Dwayne
Help
Dwayne gets to his feet as the Mustang roars down the driveway
He looks to Jay, then to his minivan
Dwayne's face: Two roads diverge in a wood
Which to take
Goddamn it, Jay
Dwayne sprints over to Jay, rips off his jacket and uses it to beat the flames down
Stop, drop and roll
Jay hits the deck
Dwayne continues fighting the flames, finally falls on top of Jay with the jacket spread and smothers the last of them out
Jay looks up at Dwayne with puppy dog eyes
You came back for me
you said you never would
You didn't hesitate back there, Jay
You did good
Jay smiles
Flames overtake the field all around them
'm gonna go put a bullet in that motherfucker and get our money
Think you can get outta here
Yeah
Go get him
103
Dwayne hurries toward the minivan
Jay stumbles up to his feet and limps off toward the woods
- The Mustang travels away from the rising flames
-  - Will's face is a mess of dirt, sweat and dried blood
He and Chet stare ahead, completely shell-shocked
Kate looks from one of them to the other
Uh
just got kidnapped
Yeah, that was totally Will's fault
In case you want to factor that in while you're mulling over the whole relationship thing
'm very sorry about the kidnapping
This is me, taking responsibility for it
Growing up
Like a viable life partner
This man has spied on you in the nude before
What
No,  didn't
He's lying
He's trying to build a relationship on a foundation of lies
And it won't stand
just got kidnapped
Can we talk about that
Something catches Will's attention: a set of headlights rapidly growing larger in the rear-view mirror
-  - Dwayne's speedometer is buried past 100 mph
His eyes burn with intensity
104
-  - Will hits the gas
Oh, shit
One of those dudes is definitely not dead
Chet and Kate look out the back window
Chet screams - Hurry up
He's already on us
- Dwayne's car pulls even with the Mustang
-  - Will looks over at Dwayne, who pulls out his gun and takes aim
He flashes a sick grin - own this town
Before Dwayne can get a shot off - - An explosion rocks the minivan from inside
The back end is lifted off the ground and the car tumbles over itself
It lands on its roof and skids into a ditch
-  - Chet and Kate watch the burning wreck disappear out the back window
They are equal parts confused and happy to be alive
What the hell was that
That was the bomb  carried around all day
reactivated it and put it in the back of his van
guess his time was up
"His time was up
" Were you thinking that up the whole day
was prepared, yes
can't help it if 'm the kind of guy who thinks about the future
105
( ) He's not that kind of guy
He doesn't think about the future
Ever
What exactly happened since  saw you this afternoon
Primarily, we robbed a bank
What
So you're, like, fugitives
What do we do now
Yeah, Will
What does the future hold
Nothing good if we stay in town and they pin this on us
Kate,  think you should put in for that vacation time
Right now
If anyone gives you a problem, tell them to fuck off
There's 100 grand in that trash bag by your feet
third of it's yours
Kate opens the bag
smiles through the dirt and grime
Will, that's - Fucked up
Why does she get a share
Why do you get a share
Chet stews
Will catches Kate's eyes in the rear-view
Airport's 30 minutes away
Pick a destination
This time it's not a practice run
- The car zooms off
: 0 hours, 0 minutes
: 106
- Wind fans the flames of the burning minivan
The shattered windshield sprouts another crack
then another, as - Dwayne's foot kicks it out
He drags himself from the smoldering steel carcass
He is a charred, blood splattered mess, but he is alive
- Dwayne is propped up against a sign, lingering on the edge of consciousness
The headlights of a lone pickup truck approach
Dwayne feebly waves the truck down for a ride
- The door opens and Dwayne stumbles through
He has made it home
He drops like a puppet whose strings have been cut
From where his head has landed on the floor, Dwayne sees something odd
long red streaks
He crawls forward on all fours to investigate
It is a trail of sticky red blood
Dwayne follows it until he comes upon its source
the crumpled body of his father, lying face down
Dwayne's face: shock and confusion and joy
Dad
Dwayne inches closer, pokes the body
Nothing
Dad, are you - The body emits a low groan
Dwayne rolls it over
His father's face is white, he's lost a lot of blood, but he isn't totally spent yet
He struggles to speak - Dwayne
What happened to you
Some guy
said you hired him to kill me
Dad,
'd never
107
Look at you
lip quivering like you're getting fucked
be a man
am a man
killed you, didn't
Now 'm gonna use your money to open a tanning salon where they let you fuck the chicks
This stirs something in The Major
You mean
like those whorehouses
in 'Nam
used to tell you about
Dwayne softens at the recollection
Those were great bedtime stories
The Major nods
Opens his hand
Reveals a cordless phone
Dwayne looks to the bloody streaks down the hall, leading to the phone table
The Major dragged himself the whole way
Medics are late
probably a couple lazy spicks
you tell 'em  said so
all right, son
Sure thing, pop
The Major looks up at Dwayne's bruised face, as if for the first time
Hell of thing
think may
actually respect you now
Dwayne's eyes well up
He reaches out, cradles his father as he expires
It's like a very bloody, white trash version of the Pieta
Dwayne sobs uncontrollably, until - He drops his father and pound-pound-pounds his chest in some approximation of a life saving resuscitation
Get up, you pussy
Come on, soldier
as Dwayne pounds the body and distant sirens grow nearer
: 108
Into waves
It's the ocean, long past sunset
to find a lone figure staring out at it, sitting on - Will
Shirtless
Could be anywhere
Chet approaches and sits beside him
Fucking nine dollars to use the internet
And
Police think it was that black guy
They found some kind of map in his car
And 'm sure racial profiling played a part
But nothing about us
Nope
Guess it's time to head back
was thinking we'd stick around a little a longer
Why
So you have more time to delude my sister
Yes
And it'd be easier if you gave us five fucking minutes alone
Chet stares out at the ocean for a beat
You really think she's into you
( ) kissed her last night
No tongue
Then you walked in
Chet just nods
Will gets up
109
You're gonna go fuck my sister now, aren't you
'll be thinking of you the whole time
At the very least
be a considerate lover
Give pleasure, before taking pleasure
think 'm reading you
And  will try my best
Will heads up a trail that leads to a hotel bungalow
Kate opens the door, steps out onto the porch
Will stops, looks back at Chet
He whistles
Chet turns
You're Riggs
You always have been
Chet smiles, shakes his head as - Will reaches the porch
He stands close to Kate
His nerves clock overtime
lied and told your brother  kissed you
thought it would make this easier
Here's an idea: pretend you have a bomb strapped to your chest
Tick, - Will closes the gap and kisses her
After a beat - Is Chet watching us
Probably
We should go inside promised him 'd satisfy you
Kate laughs, leads him inside and the door shuts to - 110
But they are pushed to one side of the screen, as the other side is filled with - lo-fi, 2001-style light tunnel
It deposits us in the furthest reaches of the galaxy, where we find - tanning bed
Rotating in orbit
Dwayne's voice booms and - The tanning bed explodes, like a star gone supernova
From the light and fire and chaos
emerges a logo: bad   takes us to the same logo
Camera unsteadily to reveal it is a banner above a strip mall storefront
We are watching a local commercial with appropriately poor production value
-  ( ) Dwayne walks backward down a hallway while addressing camera and trying not to trip - Here at Major Tan, our specially trained technicians are hard at work developing new technologies that harness the power of the sun, to ensure a cutting-edge tanning experience
Dwayne enters a tanning room
man in a lab coat stares down at a clipboard, on which a complicated scientific equation is written
How's it looking
The man turns: it's Jay
His smiling face is speckled with healing burn wounds
It's our most advanced tanning bed yet
He gestures to a very ordinary looking tanning bed
111
Hey, don't just take this scientist's word for it
The proof
Dwayne snaps his fingers
makes him disappear, then reappear with a totally orange tan
is in the tan
We follow Dwayne back out into the hallway
But Major Tan isn't just about looking good
It's also about feeling good
Dwayne gestures to another room
The door opens and Juicy saunters out in a bikini
beat later, a   exits
That "Deluxe Tan" was fantastic
-  ( ) Dwayne stands outside the store
So come on down to Major Tan
where we're proud to be a family business
The Major beside Dwayne
He's only about four feet tall now, on account of the wheelchair
But he's grinning like a jackal, in a - cap
appears: Military Discounts Available
