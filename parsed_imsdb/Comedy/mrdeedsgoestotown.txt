Written by Robert previous hit Riskin based on a story by Clarence Budington Kelland - 1
Quick shots of a car speeding around curves in a mountainous region
The car jumps a bridge, hurtles into space, crashes in a fireball
Followed by newsboys hawking special editions, people on streetcorners buying and reading newspapers with a succession of banner headlines: "
, , ," "     ," "  '  " and finally "    " : - ' , 2 of Mac, the editor, at his desk, barking into the telephone
Say listen, Corny, who do you think you're talking to
If the Semple attorneys don't know who the heir is, who does
(listens) Aw, come on Corny, 've done you a lot of favors
What do you say - who's getting the Semple dough
: - ' 3 Of Cornelius Cobb - a hardened ex-newspaperman, customarily impatient, grouchy and nervous - victim of the New York tempo
His friends call him "Corny
" (on the phone) You're asking the wrong guy, Mac
'm only a press agent
a plush law office, leather chairs and shelves of books
Arthur Cedar, attorney, briskly enters scene and seats himself at his desk
Cedar is in the neighborhood of fifty - grey-templed - dignified - sharp
Cobb is using the phone on his desk
Cedar glances at him
Newspaperman
(covering mouthpiece - confidentially) Wants to know who the heir is
(firmly) Hang up
(returning to the phone) Sorry, Mac,  can't
Yeah, Mac
Sure, but  ain't the attorney 336
(more firmly) Hang up
another attorney at one end of the desk, reviewing a pile of papers
(continuing) Mr
Cedar is, and  haven't seen him in two days
(hangs up the phone) Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers
(barely glancing up) 'm not interested in the newspapers
But it's a great story
Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks
Yes,  know
My first concern is to locate the lucky man
When  do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him
(resignedly) It's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in
as two men rush in with a flurry of excitement
One of them is Anderson, an obsequious employee of Cedar's
With him is another lawyer, one of the Cedar brothers
We located him, Mr
Cedar
We found out where he is
Good
Yes, John, we got him
Here's the report: Longfellow Deeds, single, 28, lives in Mandrake Falls, Vermont
(glancing at the report) Thank heaven
Better wire him right away, John
'll do no such thing
'm going there myself
You're going with me too, Anderson - and you too, Cobb
337
He pushes a button on the intercom
Yes
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont
(skeptically) Where
Mandrake Falls
(begins to spell as scene fades) -- : 4 It is a pleasantly rural scene - with just a handful of local characters scattered about
At one end of the platform - some mail - newspapers - and a few pieces of freight are being loaded
Cedar, Cobb and Anderson stand in front of a welcome sign
The three obviously are out of their element here - obviously "City folks
" Over their shoulders
We hear Cobb's voice as he reads: ' Welcome to Mandrake Falls - Where the scenery enthralls - Where no hardship e'er befalls - Welcome to Mandrake Falls
5 Cobb and Cedar exchange glances
That's pretty
Are you sure this is the town he lives in
Yes sir, Mr
Cedar
This is the town all right
Well,  dropped everything at the office -  hope it's not a wild goose chase
No, sir
We checked it thoroughly
He lives here all right
Ah
spy a native
Let's ask him
as they cross to a small, one-story old brick building, covered with ivy
This is the ticket and freight office combined
In front of it is a very old man, a stoop- 338
shouldered rail agent with a face of a million wrinkles - puttering around some packages
(as they approach) Good morning
(glances up) Morning, neighbors
Morning
He picks up a package and disappears into the building
Cedar and Cobb look at each other
That's an excellent start
At least we've broken the ice
The old man returns to his pile of packages
say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds
Deeds
Yes
Yes, sir
Yes, indeedy
Everyone knows Deeds
Yes, He again disappears
Must be a game he's playing
The old man shows up again
We'd like to get in touch with him
It's very important
Who's that
Deeds
Who do you think 'm talking about
Oh, yes - Deeds
Fine fellow
Very democratic
You won't have no trouble at all
Talk to anybody
Whereupon the old man carries another package inside
Cobb is properly exasperated now
339
guess we'd better try somebody else
No, we won't
The next time that jumping jack comes out, 'll straddle him while you ask him your questions
The old man emerges from the building and looks up at them as if he's never seen them before
Morning, neighbors
6
-    ( ) Cobb grabs the old man as he turns to head back into the building
Remember us
We're the fellows who were here a minute ago
Oh, yes
Yes, indeedy
never forget a face
He turns again - but Cobb holds him by the arm and sets him down on a small packing case
Listen, Pop, we've come all the way from New York to look up a fellow by the name of Deeds
It's important - very important
(releasing his arm) You don't have to get rough, neighbor
All you got to do is ask
Then please pretend, for just one fleeting moment, that 'm asking
Where does he reside
Who
Cobb turns away in disgust
Anderson steps forward
7
- Longfellow Deeds - where does he live
Oh, that's what you want
Well, why didn't you say so in the first place instead of beating around the bush
Those other fellows don't know what they're talking about
(as he exits scene) Come on, 'll take you there in my car
If they'd only explained to me what they wanted, there would be no trouble
He leaves Cobb and Cedar staring after him killingly
340
: ' 8 little old lady, Mrs
Meredith, answers a knock at the door
Cedar, Cobb and Anderson stand there, with the old man at their heels
Mrs
Meredith is a sweet, soft-voiced, timid and fluttery little creature
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen
Is Mr
Deeds in
No - he's over to the park arranging for the bazaar, so's to raise money for the fire engine
(to old man) Mal, you shoulda knowed he was in the park
Knew it all the time
But these men said they wanted to see the house
(mumbling as he exits) Can't read their minds if they don't say what they want
9 Cobb glares after him exasperatedly
Mrs
Meredith turns to Cobb and Cedar
Come in, please
Come in
Can  get you a cup of tea
No, thanks
Sit down
Sure  couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something
That's very kind of you
Are you related to him
No, 'm his housekeeper
Well, we'd like to find out something about him
What does he do for a living
He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works
But that's not where he makes his money
He makes most of it from his poetry
10
- Featuring Cobb
(skeptically) He writes poetry
341
Oh, my goodness, yes
Longfellow's famous
He writes all those things on postcards
You know, for Christmas - and Easter - and birthdays
Sit down, please
She reaches over to a desk and picks one up
Here's one - he got $25 for this one
11
- As she reads - with feeling: "When you've nowhere to turn - and you're filled with doubt - Don't stand in midstream, hesitating, For you know that your mother's heart cries out - ''m waiting, my boy, 'm waiting
'" (she looks up) Isn't that beautiful
12
- His eyes open unbelievingly
' Isn't it a lovely sentiment
(flatly) Yeah
dog enters, racing toward the door, scratching at it and whining
(as she heads toward the door) Here he is now
She opens the door and goes out, with the dog racing ahead
(to Cedar - sotto voce) suggest you break it to him gently
He's liable to keel over from the shock
Mrs
Meredith re-appears
We hear her voice as she comes through the doorway
They've been waiting a long while
Longfellow Deeds trails behind her
Who are they
don't know
342
(standing - formally) Mr
Longfellow Deeds
Yes
How do you do
(shaking hands) How do you do
(extending card) 'm John Cedar - of the New York firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington
13
- Featuring Cobb
He watches Longfellow who is glancing at the card
(reads to himself) Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington
(looks up; smiles) Budington must feel like an awful stranger, hmm
Cobb's eyes pop at the nifty
[1] Mr
Cornelius Cobb and Mr
Anderson
They exchange greetings
Longfellow gestures to chairs
You gentlemen make yourselves comfortable
Thanks
14 Longfellow crosses to his tuba near a chair
He takes a mouthpiece out of his pocket
New mouthpiece
Been waiting two weeks for this
Kids keep swiping them all the time
They use 'em for bean shooters
(he blows a note) What can  do for you gentlemen
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch
(right to the point; ignoring her) 'd like to ask you a few questions
All right
Longfellow looks at them strangely and sits down beside his tuba
343
Mr
Deeds, are you the son of Dr
Joseph and Mary Deeds
Yes
Are your parents living
Why, no
Mr
Deeds, does the name of Martin
Semple mean anything to you
Not much
He's an uncle of mine,  think
never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know
Well, he passed on
He was killed in a motor accident in Italy
He was
Gee, that's too bad
If there's anything  can do to While he speaks, he has been adjusting the tuba between his legs and now sucks on the mouthpiece, preparatory to playing
have good news for you, sir
Mr
Semple left a large fortune when he died
He left it all to you, Mr
Deeds
Deducting the taxes, it amounts to something in the neighborhood of $20,000,000
15
- His lips are over the mouthpiece of the tuba
His only reaction to the startling news is to lift his eyes in Cedar's direction
16 How about lunch
Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not
Of course they're going to stay
(to the gentlemen) She's got some fresh orange layer cake
You know, with the thick stuff on the top
(to Mrs
Meredith) Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel
Mrs
Meredith leaves
Cobb and Cedar have watched this by-play, open-mouthed, and are now even more astounded to see Longfellow blow into his tuba
344
17
- (over the noise of the tuba) Perhaps you didn't hear what  said, Mr
Deeds
The whole Semple fortune goes to you
$20,000,000
Oh, yes,  heard you all right
$20,000,000
That's quite a lot, isn't it
Oh, it'll do in a pinch
(impressed) Yes, indeed
wonder why he left me all that money
don't need it
He resumes his 'Oom-pahs
' 18
- Staring, unbelievingly
: 19 The three men sit around a table, having lunch
By Longfellow's side is, as expected, the tuba
Mr
Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer
Buffer
Yeah
glorified doormat
Yes
You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away
The world's full of pests
Then there's the newspapers to handle
One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it
During Cedar's speech, Longfellow seems to have been lost in his own thoughts
20
- Favoring Longfellow
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington
Funny, can't think of a rhyme for Budington
Why should you
345
Well, whenever  run across a funny name,  always like to poke around for a rhyme
Don't you
Nah
've got one for Cobb 21
- "There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob
Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job
" Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me
Huh
've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme
Oh,  don't mean that
'm sure 'm going to need your help
Oh, that's different if it's just poetry
22 As Mrs
Meredith enters with coffee which she pours
Are you a married man, Mr
Deeds
Who - me
No
No, he's too fussy for that
That's what's the matter with him
There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married Don't pay any attention to her
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress
Now you keep out of this
346
(diplomatically) Saving a lady in distress, eh
Well, suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young
(rising) Incidentally, we'd better get started
You'll have to pack
What for
You're going to New York with us
When
This afternoon - at four o'clock
don't think we've got any suitcases
Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs
Simpson
You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year
'm kind of nervous
've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life
Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though
(all business) can understand that
(rises to go) We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock
(shakes his hand) Congratulations, Mr
Deeds
You're one of the richest men in the country
We'll see you later
(to Mrs
Meredith) Goodbye and thank you
See you later, kid
' (as he too exits) Good day, sir
They exit
23
- Hear what he said
You know how much twenty million is
don't care how much it is
You sit right there and eat your lunch
You haven't touched a thing
347
Longfellow nibbles at some food, staring into space thoughtfully
: 24 The whole town is out
The band is playing "He's a Jolly Good Fellow" - the crowd sings
It's a festive occasion
large, awkwardly painted sign looms over everyone's head
It reads: 25
- They peer anxiously around, looking for someone, when Cobb dashes in
(breathlessly) can't find him
You can't
looked everywhere
even went to his house
It's locked up
He probably had a change of heart
He wasn't very anxious to come in the first place
(looking on) Here comes the train
Cedar glances off
26
() Of train approaching
27
- The band has already begun and is now in the midst of "For He's  Jolly Good Fellow
" At this moment, as he looks off, a startled expression comes into Cobb's eyes
He grabs Cedar by the arm - who glances in the direction he points
Look
What
That tuba player
348
28
- With Longfellow, in his customary position, blowing on his tuba
27 Cedar and Cobb stare, wide-eyed, as the song is finished
Well, now 've seen everything
: 29 In the b
g
is the train with Longfellow standing on the observation platform, clutching his tuba
On either side of him is Cedar and Cobb
In the f
g
the crowd yells its farewell
Several of them stuff baskets of fruit into his hands
The band plays "Auld Lang Syne
" 30 Over Longfellow and Cobb's shoulders
As the train begins pulling out
Longfellow smiles wanly and waves
Goodbye, Mrs
Meredith
Goodbye, Jim
Bye, Buddy
Goodbye, everybody
(a pause) Gosh, 've got a lot of friends
Cobb looks up into Longfellow's face - affected by the scene
: 31 Longfellow is slumped in his seat, his legs sprawled out, his eyes ceilingward - in deep thought
Cobb sits across from him
Cedar enters, hangs up his coat, hat and cane
(opening a snifter - generously) Have a drink
(distractedly) No, thanks
Cobb and Cedar exchange a look
Will you have a cigar
No, thank you
Cedar sits down
(breaking the silence) wouldn't worry if  were you
Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help
So don't worry
Leave everything to me
349
Oh,  wasn't worried about that
No
was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band
Cobb has just finished taking a drink and can't help but nearly spit it out

Two of them are brothers of Cedar - tall and athletic
The third is a small, frightened-looking man
He is Budington

What happened
Well, what's he like
We've got nothing to worry about
He's as naive as a child
John Close that door
(into dictograph) Will you get Mrs
Cedar on the phone, please
Come on, John
What happened
(to associates) The smartest thing  ever did was to make that trip
(anxiously) John, did you get the - uh 351
39
- Favoring Cedar
(interrupting) No, Budington,  didn't get the Power of Attorney
But don't worry,  will
(beaming to his brothers) asked him last night what he was going to do with the money, and what do you suppose he said
(gathering around him) What
can't imagine
He said he guessed he'd give it away
(laughing) Give it away
The boy must be a nit-wit
Budington hasn't enjoyed the joke - his mind still on their problem
Well, John, you had the right hunch
John, if you don't mind my saying so - we can't afford to (irascibly) know, Budington
We can't afford to have the books investigated right now
You must have said that a thousand times already
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it
(wailing) But a half million dollars
My goodness, where are we going to get (exploding) Will you stop worrying
It was  who got old man Semple to turn everything over to us, wasn't it
And who got the Power of Attorney from him
All right, and 'll get it again

Every time he blows his nose, it's news

But it's got to be personal

- She has a string in her hand which she keeps flicking, trying to get a knot into it - in the manner of cowboys with a rope

Any halfwit novice could have done better
' Yeah, we tried too Am  talking too loud
Or annoying anybody
You know Corny Cobb
He's keeping him under lock and key

Never mind about Cobb

Find out something yourselves, you imbecilic stupes

said you had dirty plaster

The reporters file past her on their way out
Just as the last one is approaching, she succeeds in doing the trick
45 As Mac turns to Babe
You too
Thought  could depend on you, but you're getting as bad as the rest of them
He grabs up a handful of papers and starts out
(flicking the string) Look,  can do it
What's gotten into you, Babe
remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this
354
46 Oh, he's not getting away with anything
(excited) Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have Can  have a month's vacation

After a few seconds of silence: It's the first time  ever had a suit made on purpose
The tailors smile accommodatingly as and we discover that both Cedar and Cobb are present
Cobb is slumped in a chair, and Cedar is carefully putting some papers away in a portfolio
355
It's merely a suggestion
don't wish to press the point, Mr
Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything
It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances
Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already
Strangest kind of people
Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something
haven't had a minute to myself
Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing
He left everything to us
He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself
You should do the same thing, Mr
Deeds
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too
Yes
That is to say Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost
(too quickly) Oh - nothing
No extra charge
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it
(generously) Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates
Budington
Funny,  can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet
50 As a butler stands in the doorway
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir
They're getting a trifle impatient, sir
They are

(to Cobb) What do you think they want
356
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors
They probably expect you to carry on
(rising) 'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down
Thanks (suddenly) Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason
Jim Mason
Oh, yeah
Yeah
No,  didn't send it
've got it written out, though
Here it is
(reaches into his pocket and reads) "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long
Don't think we should fire him
Longfellow
" Fine
Send it right away
don't want him to fire Arthur
Oh, sure
Sure
We don't want to fire Arthur
He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was
think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr
Deeds
Huh
mean, about the Power of Attorney
Oh, yes
Yes,  will
Cobb has stalled long enough to hear Longfellow's decision before he goes out of the room
'll give it a lot of thought
There was a fellow named Winslow here a little while ago, wanted to handle my affairs for nothing too
It puzzles me why these people all want to work for nothing
It isn't natural
So  guess 'd better think about it some more
51 Longfellow, Cedar and the two tailors
That's that
357
You go to an awful lot of work to keep a fellow warm, don't you
Yes, sir
butler enters again
Mr
Hallor to see you sir
(quickly) Did you say Hallor
Yes, sir
Well, don't let him in
Why not
Who is he
lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate
(to butler) Tell him to see me at my office
Well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him
(to butler) Send him in
The butler disappears
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr
Deeds
How can he make any trouble for me
haven't done anything
The butler reappears, followed by Hallor
The minute he appears, Cedar speaks up belligerently
thought  told you to take up this matter with me, Hallor
52 'm a little tired of being pushed around by you, Mr
Cedar -  don't care how important you are
(to Longfellow) Mr
Deeds,  represent Mrs
Semple
358
(eyebrows raised) Mrs
Semple
Yes
Your uncle's common-law wife
She has a legal claim on the estate
We'll let the courts decide what her legal position is
You wouldn't dare go into court with a case like this - and you know it
He turns to Longfellow, who has listened to them studyingly
leave it to you, Mr
Deeds
Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle
What kind of wife did you say she was
Common-law wife
On top of that, there's a child
child
My uncle's
Yes, sir
That's awful
The poor woman should be taken care of immediately
(pleased) 'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr
Deeds
If she was his wife, she should have all the money
That's only fair
don't want a penny of it
He yanks his trousers off and hands them to the tailor
Don't make any rash promises As the tailors exit, Cobb returns
You'd better get right down there
That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia
"[2] 359
(to Hallor) Oh,  don't want to keep them waiting any longer
They're important people
(to Cobb) wish you'd go along with me, Cobb
They're all strangers to me
Well, what about it, Mr
Deeds
(getting into robe - to Hallor) You'll excuse me, won't you
'll be right back
He exits with Cobb
53 As Longfellow and Cobb come out and start down corridor
Gee, 'm busy
Did the opera people always come here for their meetings
Uh-huh
That's funny
Why is that
(wisely) Why do mice go where there's cheese
[3] 54 group of eight distinguished-looking men sit around a long table, awaiting Longfellow's arrival
At the head of the table is a Mr
Douglas
From what 'm led to believe, the young man's quite childish
don't think we'll have any difficulty in getting him to put up the entire amount
After all, it's only a matter of $180,000
drop in the bucket for him
An excellent idea
Why not
(slyly) You know, gentlemen, we're really very fortunate the young man is so sympathetic toward music
(winking) He plays the tuba in the town band
(who has been watching at door) Here he comes
360
Good
There is a shuffle of preparation
: ' 55 With Longfellow and Cobb present
Longfellow looks around, completely awed
Now, gentlemen, the first order of business will be the election of a new Chairman of the Board
(rising) As a sentimental gesture toward the best friend opera ever had, the late Mr
Semple,  think it only fitting that his nephew, Mr
Longfellow Deeds, should be made our next Chairman therefore nominate him
Second
All those in favor
Aye
Carried
(rises) My congratulations, Mr
Deeds
56 Featuring Longfellow

(humoring a child) Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected

Right here, Mr
Deeds

57 As Longfellow is led to the president's chair
Douglas sits next to him
Now, the next order of business is the reading of the Secretary's minutes
Move we dispense with it
Second
All in favor
Aye
Longfellow looks his surprise
think they can be dispensed with
We're ready now for the reading of the Treasurer's report
Move we dispense with it
Second
All in favor
Aye
Quite right
Now, gentlemen, the next business will be 58 Featuring Longfellow, as he interrupts: Wait a minute
What does the Chairman do
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings
That's what  thought
If you don't mind, 'm rather interested in the Treasurer's report
'd like to hear it
There is an uncomfortable shuffle
For a few minutes, no one speaks
From the rear, a tall man rises
362
59 Featuring treasurer
The treasurer reports a deficit of $180,000 for the current year
60
- He is stunned
deficit
You mean we've lost that much
61 To include all at table
You see, Mr
Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit
It isn't
What is it conducted for
Why, it's an artistic institution We own an opera house, don't we
We do
And we give shows
We provide opera
But you charge
mean, you sell tickets
Of course
And it doesn't pay
That's impossible
The opera has never paid
(conclusively) Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows
Cobb smiles
The directors are stumped
62 Featuring Douglas and Longfellow
The wrong kind
There isn't any wrong or right kind
Opera is opera
363
guess it is
But  personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money
That wouldn't be common sense
Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you
Me
Naturally
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that
He is suddenly startled
His ears prick up
63 They all stare at Longfellow
Over scene comes the low wailing cry of a siren, which increases in volume as it gets closer to the building
64 Longfellow jumps up
Hey, a fire engine
He rushes to the window and peers out
The others stare unbelievably
The shriek of the siren finally dies down
Longfellow turns back
(admiringly) Gee, that was a pip
[4] (as he goes back to his seat) We expect we're going to have one like that in Mandrake Falls pretty soon with a siren, too
There is a pause while he gets seated
Now, where were we
65 You see, Mr
Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business
Why not
Because it just isn't a business, that's all
364
Well, maybe it isn't to you, but it certainly is a business to me, if have to make up a loss of $180,000
If it's losing that much money, there must be something wrong
Maybe you charge too much
Maybe you're selling bad merchandise
Maybe lots of things
don't know
You see,  expect to do a lot of good with that money
And  can't afford to put it into anything that  don't look into
That's my decision for the time being, gentlemen
Goodbye, and thank you for making me Chairman
66
- He exits, followed by Cobb, whose eyes shriek his admiration
The directors watch them leave, flabbergasted
Cobb's head reappears in doorway
Gentlemen, you'll find the smelling salts in the medicine chest
He disappears
The Board of Directors stare in dumb stupefaction at the door
: ' 67 As Longfellow enters
Hallor and Cedar rise
Sorry to keep you waiting so long
Those opera people are funny
They wanted me to put up $180,000
What about it, Mr
Deeds
Why,  turned them down, naturally
No,  mean - about my client
Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife
Longfellow's valet, Walter, enters and holds up a full dress suit
Tails tonight, sir
What - tails
(turns and sees it) Why, that's a monkey suit
[5] Do you want people to laugh at me
never wore one of those things in my life
Yes, sir
365
The tailors are leaving
(shaking hands with Longfellow) Goodbye, and thank you sir
Goodbye
(turning to the others) Wants me to wear a monkey suit
Cedar and Hallor smile accommodatingly
Walter hands him a pair of trousers
68 As Longfellow starts getting into the trousers
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr
Deeds
Huh
say we don't want to appear greedy
Oh
That
Walter has gotten down on his knees and holds the ends of the pants
What do you think you're doing
Why, 'm assisting you, sir
Get up from there
don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants
Get up from there
(rising) Yes, sir
(to others) Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants
Hallor smiles feebly - his impatience growing
Mrs
Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate
(to Walter) And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand
366
No, sir
(to Hallor) Excuse me
What did you say
Mrs
Semple is entitled to one-third of the estate
One-third
That's about $7,000,000 isn't it
(quietly) Well, we didn't expect that much
'm sure  can get her to settle quietly for one million
If there's any talk of settlement, Hallor, take it up with me at the office
'll do no such thing That's right
Don't you go to his office
There's only one place you're going, and that's out the door
Hallor looks up, surprised
You're making a mistake, Mr
Deeds
Oh no, 'm not
don't like your face
Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million
'm surprised that Mr
Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that
Now wait a minute, buddy 69 Longfellow crosses to bell cord and pulls it
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen
When the servant comes in, Mr
Hallor, 'm going to ask him to show you to the door
Many people don't know where it is
No use in getting tough
That'll get you nowhere, Mr
Deeds
(strongly) You know, we've got letters
367
As a butler enters, Longfellow turns to him
Will you show Mr
Hallor to the front door
Yes, sir
70 As Hallor gets to it
Longfellow grabs him by the shirt front and half lifts him off the floor
And listen, there isn't any wife - there aren't any letters - and  think you're a crook
So you better watch your step
He shoves Hallor violently and he stumbles out of scene
Cobb enters to Longfellow, his hand extended
can't hold out on you any longer
Lamb bites wolf
(shakes his head) Beautiful
Only common sense
71 Cedar has been most uncomfortable through the scene, but now suavely assumes an admiring attitude
(a forced smile) can't hold out any longer either, Mr
Deeds
(holds out his hand) Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair
You're not my attorney yet, Mr
Cedar
Not till  find out what's on your mind
Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so  can have a look at them
Yes, of course, if you wish
But you must be prepared
This sort of thing will be daily routine
(picks up his hat) If it becomes annoying, you let me know
Goodbye, Mr
Deeds
Goodbye, sir
Longfellow shakes his hand
Cedar exits
Longfellow stares after him disgustedly, wiping his hands with his handkerchief
Even his hands are oily
Walter has entered and holds up a coat for Longfellow
368
Well, how about tonight
What would you like in the way of entertainment
Entertainment
72 Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately
How would you like yours
Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender
What're you talking about
Women
Ever heard of 'em
Oh
Name your poison and 'll supply it
Some other time, Cobb
Some other time
Okay, you're the boss
(as he goes) When your blood begins to boil, yell out
'll be seeing you
73 As Cobb exits
Longfellow turns to Walter, the valet
He talks about women as if they were cattle
Every man to his taste, sir
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories hear about my uncle true
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time
Twenty
What did he do with them
That was something  was never able to find out, sir
: 369
74 Longfellow, exiting his bedroom, wearing a coat and hat
He comes to the top of a grand staircase, looks around slyly and sees that no one is watching
He slides down the bannister and touches the statue at the bottom for good luck
He starts for the door
When he gets there he finds his way barred by two husky-looking mugs
He looks up surprised
Hey, you going out
Why yes
Isn't that all right
2ND No
Don't ever want to go out without telling us
Who are you
We're your bodyguards
Oh, yeah
2ND Yeah, Mr
Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what
That's very nice of Mr
Cobb - but don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what
Sorry, mister
Orders is orders
Is that so
2ND Yes, sir
We gotta get you up in the morning - and we gotta put you to bed at night
Only it's all right
No matter what we see - we don't see nuttin', see
(smiling) That's going to be fun
2ND Some people like it
Longfellow glances around the room thoughtfully, then continues: Uh, will you do something for me before we go out
370
Sure
The first bodyguard eagerly takes out a pistol
The second bodyguard slaps it away
2ND (to first bodyguard) Put that away, slug
(to Longfellow) At your service
got a trunk in that room
Will you get it out for me
2ND Certainly
With pleasure
The two bodyguards accommodatingly enter a closet
The moment they are gone, Longfellow closes the door calmly and turns the key
(ad-lib) Hey, hey
We're your bodyguards
You can't do this
Longfellow whistles as he exits
: 75 Longfellow comes out, glances over the horizon
The air is filled with a slight drizzle and he sighs happily
: 76 Babe and two photographers, Bob and Frank, are huddled conspiratorially in the back seat of a taxi cab
(pointing) There he is
Yep, that's him
That's who
Get the cameras ready and follow me
What are you going to do
Never mind
Follow me and grab whatever you can get
371
suppose it's going to be the same old thing
tell you that dame's nuts
Right
: 77 Longfellow is exiting front gate
78 From his angle
Out of the shadows a girl comes into view and staggers forward
She reaches a tree and clutches it weakly
Then her strength failing, she crumples to the ground
79 Longfellow's eyes widen in apprehension as he starts forward - He reaches the girl and bending down, lifts her head
We see it is Babe Bennett
Her eyes are closed, apparently in a dead faint
80
- - Longfellow studies her face for a moment, then starts to lift her
As he does so, her eyes open and she looks up at him, feigning bewilderment
You fainted
(feebly) Oh, did
'm sorry
She struggles to get to her feet
81 Longfellow tries to assist her
Can  help you
No, thank you
'll be all right
Look, this is my house
'd like to Oh, no, really - 'll be all right
What happened
Well,  guess  walked too much
've been looking for a job all day
found one, too
start tomorrow
372
(backing away) You've been awfully kind
Thank you very much
As she leaves him, Longfellow watches her, full of sympathy
She takes a few steps and, again feigning weakness, falls against the iron fence, clutching it
Longfellow rushes to her assistance
82 (looking around) Hey, taxi
: 83 (to driver) Hey, stupe
Follow that cab they just got into, will you
Hurry up
Step on it
Come on, come on
Hurry up
: :   : "'     " : ' 84 corner table, surrounded by ferns, at which Longfellow and Babe sit
She's still eating
Feel better now
Mmm, it tastes so good
Mr
Deeds, don't know how  can ever thank you
Tell me more about yourself
Well,  guess 've told you almost everything there is to tell
My folks live in a small town near Hartford
'm down here alone trying to make a living
(hanging her head) Oh, 'm really just a nobody
Longfellow spots a strolling violinist
He furtively beckons the fellow over
The musician leans into them with romantic strains
373
(as the musician finishes and strolls away) Oh, that was so lovely
Thank you
You were a lady in distress, weren't you
(looks up) What
Oh - uh - nothing
85 As a waiter enters the scene and begins removing dishes
Waiter
Has anybody come in yet
Huh
On, no
Nobody important
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you
Uh-huh
'm a writer myself, you know
The waiter throws Longfellow a sidelong glance of complete boredom
Uh-huh
write poetry
Uh-huh
He exits
86
- You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you
All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun
No
That is,  didn't (pause - while he looks at her) Until  met you
like talking to you, though (moodily) Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep
374
87 The waiter enters again
Brookfield just came in
Oh, the poet
Where
Over at that big round table
The one that looks like a poodle
Longfellow stares off scene - his eyes full of worship
(to Babe) Look - there's Brookfield, the poet
(looks also) Really
88 From their angle, to show people at a table, engaged in conversation
89 At Longfellow's table
He stares off at them, awed
Babe watches his face
90
- ' group of five men, drinking - as the waiter enters
(confidentially - indicating Longfellow) Pardon
Longfellow Deeds, who just inherited the Semple fortune, wants to meet you
Oh, yes
read about him
He writes poetry on postcards
Let's invite him over
Might get a couple of laughs
Getting rather dull around here
It's always dull here
(rising) 'll get him
Good
375
: 91
- At which they are all seated now
Babe sits next to Longfellow, who is the center of attraction
Brookfield is just finishing introductions
Henaberry, Mr
Morrow, Bill - this is Mr
Deeds and his fiancee from Mandrake Falls
(ad-lib) How do
Hello
Nice to meet you
Nice of you to ask us to come and sit with you
Back home we never get a chance to meet famous people
(calling waiter) Waiter
little service here
(ad-lib) Yes
Mr
Deeds is a distinguished poet
drink for Mr
Deeds
He's a poet
Have a drink
No -  don't want it, thank you
Why, you must drink
All poets drink
92
- Tell us, Mr
Deeds
How do you go about writing your poems
We craftsmen are very interested in one another's methods
Yes
Do you have to wait for an inspiration, or do you just dash it off
(self-consciously) Well,  don't know Mr
Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off
376
Yes
That's what my publishers have been complaining about
They all laugh superficially
93
- Babe glances up at Longfellow, to see if he's aware that he is being laughed at
But he apparently isn't
(laughing feebly) Your readers don't complain, Mr
Morrow
' Oh, thanks
Thanks
How about you, Mr
Deeds
Well,  write mine on order
The people work for just tell me what they want and then  go to work and write it
Amazing
Why, that's true genius
Yes
Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating
Well,  play the tuba
They all laugh
've been playing the harmonica for forty years - didn't do me a bit of good
94
- You wouldn't have one in your pocket, would you, Mr
Deeds
(smiling) What
tuba
They all laugh
No, a postcard - with one of your poems on it
Longfellow is beginning to sense he is being kidded
(his face sober) No
377
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you
Too bad
was hoping you'd autograph one for me
was too
Quite right
95 As they keep on
Longfellow has his eyes levelled on each speaker in turn, obviously cognizant of their ill-concealed jibes
Wait a minute, boys
Perhaps Mr
Deeds would recite one for us
' (ad-lib) Yes
That's a very good idea
Nothing like a poet reciting his own stuff
How about a Mother's Day poem, Mr
Deeds
Exactly
Give us one that wrings the great American heart
(ad-lib) Yes
Babe has been watching Longfellow, interested
Now, when their voices die down - and they wait expectantly - he speaks quietly
(deeply hurt) guess  get the idea
guess  know why  was invited here
To make fun of me
96
- (ad-lib) Oh, come now
wouldn't say that
Look, he's temperamental
378
(levelling off at him) Yeah, what if  am
What about it
Henaberry's face sobers
(simply) It's easy to make fun of somebody if you don't care how much you hurt 'em
(to Brookfield) think your poems are swell, Mr
Brookfield, but 'm disappointed in you
know must look funny to you, but maybe if you went to Mandrake Falls you'd look just as funny to us
Only nobody would laugh at you and make you feel ridiculous - 'cause that wouldn't be good manners
97
- As he rises, continuing: guess maybe it is comical to write poems for postcards, but a lot of people think they're good
Anyway, it's the best  can do
So if you'll excuse me, we'll be leaving
guess  found out that all famous people - aren't big people
98 The group watches him silently as he leaves the table accompanied by Babe
For a moment they are nonplussed - then they break into raucous laughter - all but Morrow
99 With Longfellow and Babe as they take several steps
Then he abruptly stops
(turning to them) There's just one thing more
If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, 'd probably bump your heads together
(quickly) Oh,  don't mind
Longfellow stares at her for a moment
Then  guess maybe  will
He starts back toward the table
100 Protectively, Brookfield and Henaberry rise from their chairs
But they are too late, for Longfellow clips Brookfield on the chin first with his left fist - and with his right catches Henaberry on the jaw
The punches are almost simultaneous
The surprise attack catches the men off-guard and they fall backward waiter rushes forward to escort Longfellow and Babe out
379
(calling out) Manager
Morrow, who never budged from his chair, and who has watched Longfellow with great admiration, now rises to catch up to him
(an outcry) Eureka
' 101 As Morrow catches up to Longfellow and Babe, who are on their way out
The waiter is shooing people away
Step aside, step aside
Morrow barges forward
Longfellow and Babe turn
(obviously groggy with drink) Say fellow, you neglected me - and feel very put out
(points to his chin) Look, sock it right there, will you
Lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard
102
- That's all right
got it off my chest
The difference between them and me is know when 've been a skunk
You take me to the nearest news-stand and 'll eat a pack of your postcards raw
Raw
Longfellow and Babe smile
As Morrow continues to speak, he sways drunkenly and would fall over backwards a couple of times in midsentence if the alert Longfellow didn't have a clutch on his collar
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness
Pal, you've added ten years to my life
poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious
Delicious
You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and  are going out to see the sights
Fine, fine
Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and 'd like to reciprocate
Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet (Longfellow catches him before he falls backward in his enthusiasm) thanks - and 'll show you sights that you've never seen before
380
'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty
103
- Favoring Morrow
Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt
Everest
'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx
Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge
(puzzled) Binge
Yes
mean the real McCoy
Listen, you play saloon with me, and 'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in New York
We'll go on a twister that'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet
Longfellow saves him - once again - from crashing over
104
- Featuring Longfellow
(vaguely) That ought to be fun
Fun
Say, listen, 'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever
(to someone off) Boy
Boy
My headpiece
He exits from the scene (to the world in general) Oh, Tempora
Oh, Moeraes
Oh, Bacchus
[8] He bumps into a woman, who glares at him
Oh, you're drunk
(unmindful) Oh, you're right
105
- (to Babe) guess if we go with him, we'll see things, huh
381
She looks up at his face, amazed at his innocence
Yes,  guess we will
: ' 106 Mac is reading the story, eyes sparkling
Babe is sprawled in a chair, doing tricks with a coin
(reads) "' play the tuba to help me think
' This is one of the many startling statements made by Longfellow Deeds - New York's new Cinderella Man - who went out last night to prove that his uncle, the late Semple - from whom he inherited $20,000,000 - was a rank amateur in the art of 'standing the town on its cauliflower ear'
"[9] He looks up
Cinderella Man
That's sensational, Babe
Sensational
It took some high-powered acting, believe me
Did it
was the world's sweetest ingenue
Is he really that big a sap
107
- Favoring Babe
He's the original
There are no carbon copies of that one
Cinderella Man
Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life
Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this
If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune
She covers the coin with palm of other hand, and the coin disappears
But Mac is too excited to pay any attention
How'd you get the picture
382
Had the boys follow us
Marvelous
(reads again) "At two o'clock this morning, Mr
Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse
When asked why he was doing it, he replied: ' just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee
'" (laughs) Beautiful
What happened after that
don't know
had to duck to get the story out
He was so far along he never even missed me
When're you going to see him again
Tonight, maybe
(looks at her watch) 'll phone him at noon
(explaining) Oh, my lunch hour
'm a stenographer, you know
Mary Dawson
108
- Favoring Mac
(laughing) You're a genius, Babe - a genius
even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around
(all excited) Good
Good
Stay there
Don't show your face down here
'll tell everybody you're on your vacation
They'll never know where the stories are coming from
Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month
We'll have the other papers crazy
(starts for her) Babe,  could kiss you
109 (sidestepping) Oh, no
No
Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay
Sure
383
With pay
She is out the door
(yelling after her) You'll get it, Babe
You'll get it
: ' 110 Walter leans over the bed violently, shaking Longfellow, who is lost in drunken sleep
Mr
Deeds - Mr
Deeds, sir - you really must get up
It's late
(without budging - without opening his eyes) You're Walter, aren't you
Yes, sir
just wanted to make sure
111
- He smiles
If you'll permit me to say so, sir, you were out on quite a bender last night, sir
112
- Longfellow opens one eye - and then the other, blinking
As consciousness returns to him, he glances around the room as if to get his bearings
Bender
You're wrong, Walter
We started out to a binge but we never got to it
113
- Walter offers him a drink on a tray
(humoring him) Yes, sir
What's that
Prairie Oyster, sir
[10] (slow to comprehend anything) Prairie
Oysters
384
Yes, sir
It makes the head feel smaller
Longfellow takes it and downs it in one swig
(his face finally reacting) Oh
Oh
(remembering) Has Miss Dawson called yet
Miss Dawson, sir
No, sir
No Miss Dawson has called, sir
She was a lady in distress
She wouldn't let me help her
Got a lot of pride
like that
Oh,  do too, sir
'd better call her up and apologize
don't remember taking her home last night
'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir
114
- Favoring Longfellow
What do you mean
remember everything
Hand me my pants -  wrote her phone number on a piece of paper
You have no pants, sir
Longfellow looks up slowly
Walter goes on: You came home last night - without them
(after a double take) did what
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes
You were in your - uh - shorts
Yes, sir
Oh, don't be silly, Walter
couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes
'd be arrested
That's what the two policemen said, sir
385
What two policemen
The ones who brought you home, sir
They said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets, shouting: "Back to nature
Clothes are a blight on civilization
Back to nature
" Longfellow watches his face, fascinated
Slowly it is all coming back to him
Listen, Walter, if a man named Morrow calls up, tell him 'm not in
He may be a great author, but  think he's crazy
The man's crazy, Walter
115 Favoring Walter
Yes, sir
By the way, did you Longfellow slowly swings out of bed into a sitting position
Walter kneels to put on Longfellow's slippers
Longfellow balks, points, silently reminding Walter that he has broken his promise not to kneel down in front of him
(pointing) Please
But how'll  put on the slipper, sir
Longfellow's expression begs no disagreement
Walter stands, fumbling with the shoes from a stooped posture
(continuing) Yes, sir
beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir
Looking for
You kept searching me last night, sir
Going through my pockets
You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington
(flatly) Better bring me some coffee, Walter
Very good, sir
(remembering) Oh,  beg pardon
telegram came for you, sir
(he hands the telegram to Longfellow) 'll get you some black coffee, sir
386
116 Following Walter's exit
Longfellow quickly opens the telegram
His face clouds
At this moment, Cobb comes bursting into the room - a newspaper in his hand
(wildly) Did you see all this stuff in the papers
(holding out telegram) Arthur wants to quit
Arthur
Who's Arthur
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works
Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit
(he goes crazy) What do  care about Arthur
Did you see this stuff in the paper
How'd it get in there
What'd you do last night
Who were you talking to
He flings the paper on the bed
Longfellow glances at it, and his face clouds
(while Longfellow reads) And what'd you do to those bodyguards
They quit this morning
Said you locked them up
Oh, they insisted on following me
117 (wildly) What do you think bodyguards are for
(glances up) What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man
" Are those stories true
118
- Longfellow has his eyes glued on the paper
don't remember
"Cinderella Man
" What do they mean by that
They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance
They've got you down as a sap
387
(calmly) think 'll go down and punch this editor on the nose
(quickly) No, you don't
Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything
119 Sometimes it's the only solution
Not editors
Take my word for it
Not editors
If they're going to poke fun at me, 'm going to (bends over, earnestly) Listen
Listen, Longfellow
You've got brains, kid
You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut
Don't talk to anybody
These newshounds are out gunning for you
(referring to paper) But what about this "Cinderella Man"
That's my job
'll take care of that
'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me
But  can't do anything if you go around talking to people
Will you promise me to be careful from now on
Yes,  guess 'll have to
(mopping his brow) Thank you
(as he goes) If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor
120 He exits
During the scene Walter has entered with a tray, which he has adjusted on Longfellow's knee
Cobb's right
mustn't talk to anybody
(entering) Miss Dawson on the phone, sir
388
(alertly) Who
Miss Dawson
Yes, sir
Fine
'll talk to her
Give me the phone, quick
She's the only one 'm going to talk to from now on
As the butler scurries around for the phone, : - - () 121
- Longfellow looks around, absorbed
Babe watches him
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this
enjoy it
The Aquarium was swell
If  lived in New York, 'd go there every day
'll bet you do
Well, 'd like to - but  have a job to think of
122
- Directly behind the bus
man's head is stuck out of taxi window
We recognize it as one of the photographers, Bob
(to driver) Hey, flap-ears
[11] You better keep following that bus
' Keep your shirt on
- 123
- Two photographers, with their equipment
They keep their eyes glued on the bus in front
They return to their seats
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight
Babe ought to get him drunk again
389
124
- Got any news (catches herself) mean, has anything exciting been happening lately
Sure
met you
(laughs) Oh
What's happening about the opera
Oh, that - well, we had another meeting
told them 'd go on being Chairman if (explaining) 'm Chairman, you know
Yes,  know
told 'em 'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast
What did they say
Gosh, you look pretty tonight
What did they say
Huh
Oh
They said  was crazy
Said wanted to run it like a grocery store
What are they going to do
(leans over close to her) Do you always wear your hair like that
125 At this point, two girls pass by, chattering
One girl has a paper open
Isn't it a scream - "Cinderella Man
" The dope
2ND 'd like to get my hooks into that guy
390
Don't worry
Somebody's probably taking him for plenty
They are gone
Longfellow glares after them
Babe is afraid to look up
(quietly) If they were men, 'd knock their heads together
Babe is silent
Longfellow watches her for a moment
126
- Favoring Longfellow
Have you seen the papers
Uh-huh
That's what  like about you
You think about a man's feelings
'd like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that's writing that stuff 127
- She looks up, startled
"Cinderella Man
"  guess pretty soon everybody will be calling me "Cinderella Man
" Babe has had an uncomfortable time of it - and quickly changes the subject
Would you like to walk the rest of the way
It's so nice out
Yes
Yeah, let's
She jumps up from her seat, and Longfellow follows
128 Favoring the taxi driver
Hey, wise guys
He's getting off
This sets off a mad scramble
(ad-lib) Hey, come on
391
Pull over to the curb
: - ' 129
- He stands across the street from Grant's Tomb, looking solemn
His eyes moist
She is unaware of his emotion
Come on, don't you want to see it
130
- Feast your eyes
Grant's Tomb
Is that it
(to driver) Hey, beetle-puss
The Tomb
131
- As they approach the monument
There you are
Grant's Tomb
hope you're not disappointed
(throatily) It's wonderful
To most people, it's an awful letdown
(in awe) Huh
say, to most people it's a washout
That depends on what they see
(looks up at him) Now, what do you see
132
- Me
Oh,  see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier
see thousands of marching men
see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said
And  can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President (dreamily) Things like that can only happen in a country like America
392
133
- To intercut with above speech
During his recital, she watches his face, fascinated
Her impulse is to laugh, but she finds that she can't
(overcome - he almost chokes on his final words) Excuse me
: 134 switchboard operator fielding calls
Sorry, Mr
Hopper
Mr
Cedar won't answer his phone
Sorry
(passing by) Say, what's going on in the boss's office
Search me
The three 'Cs' and little '' have been in there for over an hour
' 135 Cedar paces the floor
His brothers look worried
Budington is enthroned at Cedar's desk
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is (pouncing on him) Yes,  know
week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet
Yes, but you said (walking way from him) don't care what  said
can't strangle him, can
It's ridiculous for us to have to worry about a boy like that
(crosses to desk) Look at these articles about him
"Cinderella Man
" Why, he's carrying on like an idiot
Exactly what  was saying to my wife when this Who cares what you were saying to your wife
393
There is a moment's awkward silence
The silence is broken by the buzzing of the dictograph
Cedar crosses to it and snaps the button
136 As secretary's voice comes over dictograph: Yes
' Mr
and Mrs
Semple are still waiting
(irritated) can't help it
Let them wait
He snaps the dictograph off
137 Those people have been in to see me every day this week
2ND Who are they
(dismissing it) Relatives of old man Semple
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value
Nuisance value
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money
(suddenly) Nuisance value
(thinks a minutes - crosses to door) Maybe they have
Maybe they have
Maybe they have
(opens door) Mr
and Mrs
Semple, please
How do you do
The others all stand around - as the Semples enter
We've been trying to 138
- (smoothly cutting her off) 'm so sorry to have kept you waiting
How are you, sir
don't know what my secretary could 394
have been thinking to keep you waiting this long
(to one of his brothers) Will you bring the chairs
Quickly
Will you have a cigar, Mr
Semple
Thanks
Semple takes the cigar - rather flabbergasted at all the sudden attention showered upon him
: - 139
- From over their shoulders, looking down on the lights and teeming activity of Times Square
There's Times Square
You can almost spit on it, can't you
Why don't you try
He does try
The wind blows it back on him
She laughs, takes out a handkerchief and wipes it off his coat
(as she wipes) Oh
It's breezy up here
He doesn't say anything right away
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you
'm not worrying any more
suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired
You don't believe all that stuff, do you
guilty look spreads over Babe's face
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know
Yeah,  guess so
What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other
Why don't they try liking each other once in a while
An awkward pause
Shall we go
395
: - 140 As Babe and Longfellow walk
(spotting a park bench) Here's a nice place
Yeah
Anyway, there aren't any photographers around
- 141 Bob and Frank, sneaking around in the bushes
142
- You know, you said something to me when you first met me that 've thought about a great deal
What's that
You said  was a lady in distress
Oh, that What did you mean by that
Nothing There is a pause
Have you got a - are you - uh - engaged or anything
143
- The corners of her mouth go up in sympathetic amusement
No
Are you
' No
You don't go out with girls very much, do you
' haven't
Why not
396
144
- Favoring Longfellow
Oh,  don't know
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here
Don't you like them
haven't met anybody here that  like, particularly
They all seem to have the St
Vitus Dance
[12] (awkwardly) Except you, of course
(a pause) People here are funny
They work so hard at living - they forget how to live (thoughtfully; leans back) Last night, after  left you,  was walking along and looking at the tall buildings and  got to thinking about what Thoreau said
They created a lot of grand palaces here - but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them
145 Favoring Babe
She stares at him curiously
'd rather have Mandrake Falls
'm from a small town too, you know
(interested) Really
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls
(finding a kindred soul) Gosh
What do you know about that
Babe leans her head back in a reminiscent mood
We get a feeling that, for the moment, she has forgotten she is Babe Bennett, out on a story
Ah, it's a beautiful little town, too
row of poplar trees right along Main Street
Always smelled as if it just had a bath
146
- Longfellow watches her face intently
've often thought about going back
397
You have
Oh, yes
used to have a lot of fun there when  was a little girl
used to love to go fishing with my father
That's funny
He was a lot like you, my father was
Talked like you, too
Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours
And after awhile, for no reason, 'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap
He never said very much but once  remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain
" He sounds like a person worth while knowing
There is a pause while Longfellow watches her, and she is lost in thought
(continuing) He played in the town band, too
He did
play the tuba Yeah,  know
What did he play
The drums
He taught me to play some
He did
Yes
can do "Swanee River
" Would you like to hear me
(enthusiastically) Sure
147 She picks up a couple of branches
With the two sticks she drums on the bench seat - and sings "Swanee River
" When she is finished, though clearly delighted, he shows her a long face of mock-disappointment
Oh,  suppose you could do better
Sure
can sing "Humoresque
" 398
"Humoresque"
'll bet you don't even know how it goes
Sure
Look
You sing it over again, and 'll do "Humoresque" with you
It had better be good
She starts again, and he sings "Humoresque" in counterpoint to her drumming
: - 148
- They wait with their camera
When they hear the singing, they look up, and then at each other in surprise
wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet
Shhh
149 Longfellow and Babe
They are having a grand time with their singing
policeman saunters into the scene and stands watching them for a few seconds, without their being conscious of his presence
He smiles, shakes his head and passes on out of scene
Over the shot we hear the low moan of a siren in the distance
150
- They reach the climax of their song - and laugh joyously
At this moment, the shrieking of the siren is nearer and louder
Longfellow looks up quickly
Excited, he jumps up and runs toward street
Babe looks up, surprised
(as he runs off) Fire engine
Fire engine
want to see how they do it
Wait for me, will you
151
- Frank grabs the camera
Looks like the evening is not going to be wasted
152 They dash by the policeman, who looks up, startled
153 As the fire engine slows down - and people are beginning to gather
We see Longfellow running toward the truck and hopping aboard
154 As Longfellow jumps on
399
Hello - what do you want
(short salute) Captain Deeds - fire volunteer - Mandrake Falls
(amused) Hi, Cap
Boys, meet the Captain
155
- Bob and Frank running with their cameras toward Longfellow
: ' 156 Of typewriter carriage
It contains a paper upon which the following is typed: "  - " "Longfellow Deeds, 'The Cinderella Man,' last night threw a 'defy' into the teeth of the New York Fire Department, that when it comes to extinguishing conflagrations - they had better look to their laurels" and we find Babe, staring at the sheet of paper in front of her
Her eyes have a distant look
157 Several feet away from her Mabel Dawson stands in front of an easel, working silently on a painting
She dabs at it and turning, pauses a moment to watch Babe, who at the moment rests her forehead on the typewriter carriage
(softly) What's the matter, hon
(quickly) Nothing
Babe is too much absorbed to hear this
Getting no response, Mabel turns and studies her for a few seconds
What's up, Babe
Something's eating you
No
It's nothing
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew
(murmuring) Don't be ridiculous
400
She again resumes her typing
Mabel crosses to her and looks over her shoulder
You haven't gotten very far, have you
That's where you were an hour ago
Come on, let's knock off and go down to Joe's
The gang's waiting for us
(jumping up) can't write it, Mabel
don't know what's the matter with me
Babe lights a cigarette
Mabel studies her
(quietly) Uh-huh
think  can tell you
The phone bell rings
Mabel picks it up
158 (into phone) Hello
(listens) Yes, she's here
Who wants her
(listens) Who
(listens) Oh, yes
Yes, just a moment
(her hand over the mouthpiece) It's him - whatcha-ma-call-him - the "Cinderella Man
" The "Cinderella Man"
Babe grabs the phone
Hello
' 159
- Who lies dressed in bed, phone in hand
(into phone) Couldn't sleep
Kinda wanted to talk to you
Do you mind
' 160
- (sincerely) No - not at all
couldn't sleep either
' 161
- At phone
401
wanted to thank you again for going out with me
(listens) Huh
Well,  don't know what 'd do without you
You've made up for all the fakes that 've met
160 Well, that's very nice
Thank you
161 You know what 've been doing since got home
Been working on a poem
(listens) It's about you
(listens) Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so  write 'em
160 (touched) 'd like to read it some time
She listens for a moment, apparently moved by his sweetness
161 Maybe 'll have it finished next time see you
(listens) Will  see you soon
(listens) Gosh, that's swell, Mary
(listens) Good night
He hangs up, and lies back - enthralled
160 Good night
162
- Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive
can't make him out
163
- (knowingly) Uh-huh
402
'm crucifying him
People have been crucified before
Why
Why do we have to do it
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you
Yeah, then what
(shrugging) Search me
Ask the Gypsies
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh
To us he looks like a freak
You know what he told me tonight
He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms
The guy's balmy
Is he
Yeah,  thought so, too
tried to laugh, but  couldn't
It stuck in my throat
Aw, cut it out, will you
You'll get me thinking about Charlie again
He's got goodness, Mabel
Do you know what that is
Huh
No - of course you don't
We've forgotten
We're too busy being smart-alecks
(sits at her typewriter) Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing

" : "Cinderella Man to Reform Opera 403
Must be put on paying basis - or else - says post-card poet
" : "Madame Pomponi, Famous Opera Singer, To Launch Deeds on Social Career" : ' 164 Longfellow is in bed in his pajamas, playing the tuba
Walter enters
beg pardon, sir
beg pardon, sir
Longfellow stops, looking daggers at him
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir
Who
Madame Pomponi
She says everything is all set for the reception
What do you mean by coming in here when 'm playing
But she's on the telephone Get out
(pointing) The evil finger's on you
Get out
Walter hurries out
Longfellow jumps up and chases him down the grand staircase
Longfellow stops at the top of the stairs, struck by an idea
165 Showing Walter at the bottom of the stairs and Longfellow at the top
Stop
Walter halts
Longfellow gives a shout from the top of the stairs
There is a discernible echo
Hey, did you hear that
What, sir
404
Longfellow gives another shout
There is another echo
He tries it again - louder
Another echo
It is all very satisfactory
(pleased) Why, that's an echo, sir
You try it
(timidly) Me, sir
(an order) Yeah
Walter gives a bird-like hoot
There is an echo
(firmly) Louder
Walter gives a louder hoot
And louder
Each time, an echo
butler in a bathrobe emerges to see what all the hullabaloo is about
Longfellow spots him
(to butler) You try it
Me, sir
But the butler clearly relishes the opportunity
He gives a little high-pitched squeak
Louder
The butler tries it again - much better
Another man-servant has emerged
Longfellow points to him
You try it
The man-servant tries it - very raspy, another tone altogether
(waving like a conductor) All together
symphony of hoots, shrieks, barks and echoes
Again
The household staff do it again
405
(surveying the scene - then, dramatically) Let that be a lesson to you
With that, Longfellow spins on his heel and returns to his bedroom
There is a pause
The butler takes command of the other two
(gesturing imperiously) Go back to your room, both of you
Walter and the man-servant hasten to exit
The butler waits until nobody is looking, then gives one, final hoot
He murmurs to himself with satisfaction as he exits
: '  - 166 Limousines arriving - from which guests emerge - in full evening dress
- 167 Madame Pomponi greets a group of guests
Ad-lib chatter is heard
From inside music emanates
- Oh, hello darling
So good of you to come
Sweet of you to ask me
Where is he
'm just dying to see the "Cinderella Man
" among groups of people picking out vignettes of conversation
Longfellow is the hot topic
husband and a wife whispering: Shh
- he may hear you
Even if he heard you, he wouldn't understand
man and a woman gossiping: hear he still believes in Santa Claus
Will he be Santa Claus
That's what want to know
Another man holding forth to two elegantly-dressed women: Have you all got your slippers ready for the "Cinderella Man"
406
(ad-lib) Yes,  have
Everybody laughs
With $20,000,000, he doesn't have to have looks
2ND He won't have it long with that Pomponi woman hanging around him
Two women in evening dress twittering like birds: (to other woman) My dear,  hear he can't think unless he plays his tuba
: ' 168 Babe is listlessly packing her few things in a small handbag
She slowly and meticulously folds a silken undergarment, wrapping it in tissue
Her eyes have a distant look
Mabel watches her, concerned
There is a long pause before either of them speaks
(breaking the silence) You're a fool, Babe
just couldn't stand seeing him again
Running away is no solution
169
- Babe is unresponsive
(after a pause) What'll  tell him if he calls up
Tell him  had to leave suddenly got a job in China - some place
You're acting like a school girl
(suddenly - tensely) What else can  do
Keeping this up is no good
He's bound to find out sometime
(softly) At least  can save him that
They are suddenly startled by the boisterous entrance of Bob and Frank, whose voices are heard as they barge in
407
170 Babe, not wishing to explain to them, hides her bag - and follows Mabel to greet them in the living room
171 The boys cross to a table and drop their cameras
Say, where is everybody
Come on, Babe - the artillery's ready
Mabel enters
Babe stands in doorway
(by way of greeting) It's those two sore spots again
You shoulda been down to the office today, Babe
Yeah
Mac threw Cobb out again
Boy, was he burning
(reaching for a bottle) Just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot
(grabbing it away) Just a minute
No, you don't
We're not going out tonight
Thought you had a date with him
172
- It's off
He's having a party at his house
173 Frank, Bob and Mabel
Say, what's the matter with her now You wouldn't know if  drew you a diagram
Now, run along and peddle your little tin-types
What is this
Throwing us out of here's getting to be a regular habit
There is a knock on the door
They all look up
408
174 As Mabel opens the door slightly
We see Longfellow
Mabel's eyes open in surprise
Is Mary Dawson here
'm Longfellow Deeds
175
- They stand - stupefied
176
- She waves her hand back of her, for them to hide
(loud - for the boys) Oh
Oh, yes, of course
Longfellow Deeds
Come in
Step in, please
177
- They duck behind the sofa, 178 Longfellow enters
Mabel closes the door behind him, watching him speculatively
Longfellow turns to Mabel
You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you
(flustered) Huh
Oh, yes - yes, of course
Her sister
Yes, 've been her sister for a long time
Is she home
Yeah
What
Is Mary home
They look at each other stupidly - smiling feebly
179 Featuring the camera
hand comes in from behind the sofa and yanks the camera out of sight
180 Mabel and Longfellow still standing, looking at each other
Oh, Mary
Yes, of course
Well,  don't know whether she's home or not
'll see
As she turns, Babe appears in doorway
Why there she is
Of course she's home
(feebly) Stupid of me
409
Hello
Hello, Mary
waited in the park for you over an hour
thought maybe you'd forgotten
181
- Mabel in b
g
didn't think you could come with the party and everything
Oh,  wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you
So  threw them out
You threw them out
182 You mean (gesturing with hands) by the neck or something
Sure
They got on my nerves, so  threw 'em out
Mabel raises her eyebrows
guess that'll be in the papers tomorrow
It will give 'em something else to laugh at
183
- Her face clouds - miserably
' (lightly) don't mind though
had a lot of fun doing it
(quickly) Would you like to go for a walk
184 Yes, if it isn't too late
(going to bedroom) 'll get my hat
She disappears, leaving Mabel and Longfellow again staring at each other, self-consciously
Mabel smiles, ill-at-ease
410
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it
- isn't it
(tremulously) Yes, lovely
We've had a lot of nice weather lately
(after a pause) It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think
Oh yes,  think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk
nice long one
185
- Bob and Frank, holding their breaths
186 Babe comes out of bedroom
Ready
Gosh, she looks better every time see her
(vaguely) Thank you
She crosses to the door
(to Mabel) Goodnight
Don't worry
won't keep her out late
Thank you so much
Good night
They exit
Mabel sighs relievedly
The boys jump from their crouching positions
(wobbling forward) Ow
My foot's asleep
(grabbing camera) Come on - let's go
Frank grabs his camera and both bolt toward the door
Mabel gets there one step ahead of them, and blocks their path
No, you don't
Just a minute
No more photographs
411
: ' 187 As they walk slowly down the front steps
The reason why  wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause  wanted to talk to you
Let's just walk, okay
All right
188 As they walk along a foggy street, on their faces
Mary, 'm going home
Are you
When
In a day or so,  think
don't blame you
189 Continuing on them, as they slowly walk around the block
man ought to know where he fits in
just don't fit in around here
once had an idea  could do something with the money, but they kept me so busy here,  haven't had time to figure it out
guess 'll wait till  get back home
There is a long pause
Both lost in their own thoughts
Do you mind if  talk to you, Mary
You don't have to pay any attention to me
No,  don't mind
All my life, 've wanted somebody to talk to
Back in Mandrake Falls,  always used to talk to a girl
girl
Oh, an imaginary one
used to hike a lot through the woods and 'd always take this girl 412
with me so  could talk to her
'd show her my pet trees and things
Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it
(smiling) She was beautiful
(then moodily) haven't married 'cause 've been kinda waiting
You know, my mother and father were a great couple
thought  might have the same kind of luck
've always hoped that some day that imaginary girl would turn out to be real
They have arrived back at the front steps of Babe's home
Well, here we are again
Yes, here we are again
(after a pause) Good night
(then, quickly - his voice faltering) Mary -  - excuse me 190 Favoring Babe
She cuts him off, her voice shaking
Goodbye, darling
Don't let anybody hurt you again - ever
They can't anyway
You're much too real
You go back to Mandrake Falls
That's where you belong - goodbye
191 She runs up the steps
Mary She stops and turns
He walks up close to her
192
- You know the poem  told you about
It's finished
His hand goes to his breast pocket - and then slowly is withdrawn - without bringing out the poem
Would you like to read it
It's to you
(scarcely audible) Yes, of course
He now takes the poem out
The paper is folded
He hands it to her and she slowly unfolds it
Just as she is about to read Longfellow lays a hand on her arm
413
(a little frightened) You don't have to say anything, Mary
You can tell me tomorrow what you think
She looks into his eyes, but does not respond
Then she holds the paper up and begins reading
Longfellow watches her anxiously
193
- Reading softly: " tramped the earth with hopeless beat - Searching in vain for a glimpse of you
Then heaven thrust you at my very feet,  lovely angel - too lovely to woo
" The last words come with difficulty
Babe's eyes are slowly welling up
194
- Babe continues reading: "My dream has been answered, but my life's just as bleak, 'm handcuffed and speechless in your presence divine - For my heart longs to cry out, if it only would speak, ' love you, my angel - be mine, be mine
' " Her voice is choked when she finishes
She does not look up until she refolds the paper
He stands close to her, waiting expectantly
Finally, she glances up
Her cheeks are moist, and her face clouded
Impulsively, she throws her arms around his neck, kissing him
Oh, darling
Longfellow's arms encircle her and for a few moments they remain in an emotional embrace
(huskily) You don't have to say anything now
'll wait till tomorrow - till  hear from you
195
- Her eyes are beset with fears
She loves him - but knows how hopeless it all is
She slowly starts freeing herself from his embrace
196
- As Babe, weeping softly, frees herself from his embrace
Longfellow gives a yelp of joy and leaps down the steps
He trips over a garbage pail and bumps into passersby, making a racket as he zigzags down the street and out of scene
414
(shouting) Hey, what's the big idea
: - 197
- Behind his desk
Stop it, Babe
Stop it
What do you mean, you're quitting
You might as well tell me 'm quitting
As he speaks,    to reveal Babe near a window, peering out moodily
Mac crosses over to her side
What's bothering you, huh
(after a pause) Last night he proposed to me
Proposed to you
You mean he asked you to marry him
Yes
(alert) Why, Babe - that's terrific
(sees it in print) "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl
Who is the Mysterious Girl That" Print one line of that, and 'll blow your place up
198
- Sorry, Babe
Sorry
It would have made a swell story
just got carried away
That's too bad
So he proposed to you, huh
(intrigued) What a twist
You set out to nail him - and he (bitterly) Yeah
Funny twist, isn't it
(suddenly) Say, you haven't gone and fallen for that mug, have you
415
Babe's silence is eloquent
Well, 'll be He places an arm tenderly around her shoulder
That's tough, Babe
Babe smiles wryly
(interested) What're you going to do
(walking away) 'm going to tell him the truth
Tell him you're Babe Bennett
Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him
'm having lunch with him today
He expects an answer
It's going to be pretty
You're crazy
You can't do that
199
- Over their shoulders, from behind, as Mac comforts her
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs
only hope he does
'll put you on another job
You need never see him again, eh
That's the rub
Oh, as bad as that, huh
(far-away) Telling him is the long shot - 'm going to take it
He watches her sympathetically
Babe sighs resignedly
(looking around) Well, it was fun while it lasted, Mac
'll clean out my desk
She leaves him
Mac is deeply moved by her problem
416
: 200 As Longfellow, in a buoyant mood, emerges from his room and slides down the bannister of the grand staircase
201 Table is set for two
Two butlers putter around
Longfellow enters full of expectant enthusiasm
He is in his shirt sleeves
He hovers over them, checking their preparations
How's it going
Okay
Yes, quite all right
Thank you, sir
(picking up a salt shaker and examining it) Gold, eh
(as he continues his puttering) Yes, sir
Fourteen carat
Yes, sir
Is that the best you've got
Oh, yes sir
(seizing on another detail) Those flowers are too high
Won't be able to see her
(lifts a bowl of flowers off) Get a smaller bowl, will you
(repeating his command as he hands the bowl to the other butler) smaller bowl of flowers
2ND (exiting with flowers) Yes, sir
smaller bowl of flowers
(to butler) Did you get that stuff  was telling you about
Stuff, sir
417
That goo
That stuff that tastes like soap
Oh, yes, sir
Here it is, sir
The pate de fois gras, sir
Yeah, that's fine
Have a lot of it because she likes it
Yes, sir
The other butler returns with a small bowl of flowers which he places in the center of the table
Now you got the idea
Fine
He sits in one of the chairs and leans forward in an imaginary conversation with Babe - his lips move but we hear nothing
(motions to butler) Sit over there, will you
Me sir
Yes
The butler sits
Yes
You're too tall
Slink lower, will you
The butler does it
More
Now forward
They are practically nose to nose over the flowers
(seriously) How is this, sir
(rising) Perfect
Perfect
wish you luck, sir
Thank you
Now don't touch a thing
Leave everything as it is
He hurries toward his bedroom
418
: 202 Longfellow enters
(yelling) Walter
Walter
Walter, where are you
Walter enters, panic-stricken
Yes, sir
What is it, sir
Anything happened3 203 Anything happened
've got to get dressed
can't meet her like this
But she isn't due for an hour, sir
An hour
What's an hour
You know how time flies, Walter
My tie
Get it
Yes, sir
Very good, sir
Here it is right here, sir
There, sir
While putting it on, he sings "Humoresque" loudly and gaily
204 At this moment, Cobb bursts in - his face grim: Just as  suspected, wise guy
don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too
(to Walter - merrily) Will you tell the gentleman 'm not in
Mary Dawson, huh
Mary Dawson, my eye
That dame took you for a sleigh ride that New York will laugh about for years
She's the slickest, two-timing, double-crossing At the mention of the name, Longfellow turns for the first time
205
- His face goes livid, as Cobb's voice continues: (between clenched teeth) What are you talking about
419
206 Longfellow has started out toward him
In two long strides, Longfellow has grabbed Cobb by the shirt-front, ready to strangle him
All right
Go ahead
Sock away, and then try to laugh this off
With his free hand, he reaches into his coat pocket
He unrolls a newspaper
Longfellow shifts his glance over to the photograph in the newspaper Cobb holds up, and slowly his grip on Cobb relaxes
He takes the newspaper
207
- As he looks at the picture
: Under which is the following: "Louise (Babe) Bennett - wins Pulitzer Prize for reportorial job on Macklyn love triange
" Longfellow stares long and unbelievingly at the picture
208
- (adjusting his clothes) She's the star reporter on The Mail
Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story
She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man
" You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide
(an outcry) Shut up
Longfellow, stunned, crosses to the bed -
He slumps down and continues staring at picture
209 Cobb crosses to phone and picks up receiver
: 210 Babe is at her desk
She has just finished rummaging through her desk
Many articles are on top
Mac is by her side
Babe flicks the pages of a small loose-leaf book, and hands it to Mac
This is for you , Mac
The names of all the headwaiters in town
You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices
Aw, listen Babe,  can't let you quit now
You're not going through with this thing, are you
420
Babe shakes her head with finality, as the phone bell rings
(picking up receiver) 've seen 'em get in a rut like you before - but they always come back
(into phone) Hello
Yes
Just a minute
He holds the receiver out to her
It's for you
In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing
(into phone) Hello
' 211 Cobb is at the phone
Babe Bennett
Just a minute
He listens and hands phone to Longfellow
(into phone) Hello, Mary
212
- (at phone) Oh, hello darling
Her face goes dead as she realizes she is speaking to Longfellow
' 213
- (at phone; strained) Is it you who's been writing those articles about me
214
- At phone
Why - uh -  was just leaving - 'll be up there in a minute (listens) Look - uh, yes,  did - but  was just coming up to explain The words die in her throat
She looks dully at the receiver
421
' 215
- ' (coming over phone) Oh listen, darling, wait a minute
Please
Listen He hangs up
His face is a dead mask, every illusion shattered
Slowly, a wry smile appears on his face and, rising, he wanders around the room in deep abstraction
Cobb and Walter watch him sympathetically
Longfellow is silent a long time
216 As a butler enters
beg pardon, sir
Shall  serve the wine with the squab, sir
Longfellow doesn't hear him
(tries again) beg pardon, sir
217
- His face softens
If  knew you were going to take it so hard,  woulda kept my mouth shut
Sorry
218 As finally Longfellow speaks, without turning
(quietly) Pack my things, Walter
'm going home
Yes, sir
He immediately busies himself
: 219 Longfellow emerges from his bedroom, walking briskly toward the staircase, immediately followed by Cobb and Walter
Walter is loaded down with suitcases
Longfellow is wearing coat and hat
(trying to keep up with Longfellow) You shouldn't be running away like this
What's going to happen to the Estate
They can have the Estate
422
As they approach the staircase, a commotion is heard from stairs
Cobb hurries ahead to see what is going on
220 Two butlers are struggling with a wild-eyed man of middle age
They shout in unison
(simultaneously) You can't come up here
Let me go
wanna see him
He's not home,  tell you
wanna see that guy
We'll send for the police
Let me go
They continue to struggle as Cobb reaches them
What's going on here
The man yanks himself free
There he is
just wanted to get a look at him
He sees Longfellow over Cobb's shoulder
There you are
just wanted to see what kind of a man you were
He struggles to thrust Cobb aside
221 Favoring Longfellow, who has reached the bottom of the staircase and watches the man warily
(wildly) just wanted to see what a man looks like that can spend thousands of dollars on a party - while people around him are hungry
The "Cinderella Man," huh
Did you ever stop to think how many families could have been fed on the money you pay out to get on the front pages
Cobb forcibly restrains the man
Come on
Take him out of here
Let me go
(an order) Let him alone
Let me alone
(threateningly) If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest
423
(to Longfellow) How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse
Get a kick out of it, huh
Got a big laugh
(sarcastically) Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings
No
Longfellow stares at him
(quietly) Shall  call the police, sir
No
(to man) What do you want
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you
What do  want
chance to feed a wife and kids
'm a farmer
job
That's what  want
farmer, eh
You're a moocher, that's what you are
wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles
You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here
Sure - everybody's a moocher to you
mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you
(starting to push him towards the door) This won't do you any good The man shoves him away, suddenly whips out a gun and levels it at him
Stay where you are, young feller
Get over there
Cobb backs away and the man points the gun at Longfellow, who remains staring at him, immobilely
(tensely) You're about to get some more publicity, Mr
Deeds
You're about to get on the front page again
See how you're going to like it this time
(voice rises) See what good your money's going to do when you're six feet under ground
You never thought of that, did you
No
All you ever thought of was pinching pennies - you money-grabbing hick
You never gave a thought to all of those starving people 424
(his voice wavers) standing in the bread lines (huskily) not knowing where their next meal was coming from
Not able to feed their wife and kids
(voice breaks) Not able to He can't go on
sob escapes
He reaches up and brushes away a tear with a rough hand
It seems to bring him to his senses
He glances down and seeing the gun in his hand - stares at it in surprise
He realizes what he was about to do
(scarcely audible) Oh
222
- The man slumps into a chair and the gun drops to the floor
Cobb bends quickly and picks it up
Longfellow never moves
(dead voice - staring into space) 'm glad  didn't hurt nobody
Excuse me
He turns his head slowly and peers at them with non-seeing eyes, then suddenly he hides his face in his hands and sobs
(muffled) Crazy
You get all kinds of crazy ideas
Longfellow watches him pityingly
Sorry
didn't know what  was doing
The rest of it seems to come out of him effortfully - his voice breaking
Losing your farm after twenty years' work - seeing your kids go hungry - a game little wife saying "Everything's going to be all right
" (stridently) Standing there in the bread lines
It killed me to take a handout
(pathetically) ain't used to it
(resigned) Go ahead and do what you want with me, mister
(scarcely audible) guess 'm at the end of my rope
He sobs openly
While he was speaking, Longfellow was peering into the man's face intently
As the man finishes : 223 At the table that was all set for Babe
The man sits, eating
He seriously bends over his food
Longfellow sits opposite him - his eyes glued on the man, absorbed in profound thought
425
(tentatively) Can  take some of this home with me
Longfellow nods
: : " Huge farming district to be divided into ten acre farms - fully equipped - at a cost of eighteen million dollars
" : : "'    " : : "    " : : " " : ' 224 mob of shouting men and women clamor at the gates, being jostled around by the police
' 225 It has been transformed into an office
Longfellow sits at one end of the room
Clerks are at several desks
On one side and leading out into the hall, is a long line of men waiting to be interviewed
Go on
Step lively
226 At Longfellow's desk
He has a two days' growth of beard and looks worn
Next to him is a clerk
In front of him is an applicant
(as the camera moves in on him) Are you married
Yes, sir
Any children
426
No, no children
All right, Mr
Dodsworth
think you'll qualify
(he hands him a form) Take this to that desk over there for further instructions
(gratefully - exiting) Thank you very much
Next, please
man steps forward and stands in front of his desk
227 Longfellow, clerk and applicant
(to clerk) How many does that make
You've okayed 819
(wearily) Is that all
That's all
It's going awfully slow
We need 1100 more
(phone rings) Hello
oh, yes
Yes
The water development seems okay - but  don't like the road layout yet
Come up tonight about ten and bring the maps
Right
He hangs up
228 As the farmer in previous sequence approaches
Here's the order for the plows
We got a good price on them
That's fine
Thanks
'll look 'em over later
Oh, Mr
Deeds Longfellow looks up
Farmer goes on: 427
my wife wanted me to tell you she (hesitates) she prays for you every night
(embarrassed) Well, thanks,  - uh (to applicant in front of him) How do you do
What is your name
George Rankin, sir
While Longfellow writes 229 Cobb is on the phone
(into phone) No
No
We're not buying any bulls
What's that
Listen, fellow, bull's what 've been selling all my life
He slams down the receiver
' 230 Cedar behind his desk
In front of him is Henry Semple and his nagging wife
Cedar shoves a paper in front of Semple
We have very little time
He's ordered me to turn everything over to him immediately
We have to work fast before he disposes of every penny
See
told you something could be done
knew it all the time
Sign it, dear
(hesitating) We may get into trouble
Oh, don't be so squeamish
There are millions involved
After all, you have your legal rights
You're his only living relatives
231 As Semple picks up the paper
What's it say
That's your agreement with Mr
Cedar, if we win
428
You see, my end is going to be rather expensive
have a lot of important people to take care of
have the legal machinery all set and ready to go
've been working on nothing else for the last week
You say the word, and we'll stop this yokel dead in his tracks
Sign it
Oh, all right
With the perturbed expression still on his face, Semple reaches over to sign the document
Simultaneously, Cedar flicks a button on his dictagraph
(into dictagraph) Charlie, we're off
Papers all set
All set
Okay, then
Go to it
(afterthought) And, Charlie Yeah
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away
Okay
: ' 232 large, raw-boned Swede stands before Longfellow
What is your name
Christian Svenson
Farmer
Yes, ma'am
Where is your farm
South Dakota north
429
South Dakota - north
South Dakota - but on the top
Oh
Oh
233 Cobb enters, very businesslike
What about your knocking off for lunch
Not hungry
want to get through this work in a hurry, and then  want to go home
What price did you get on those trucks
Come on, come on
What are you trying to do, kid
Keel over
You haven't been out of this house in two weeks
(tired) Well, maybe  will have a sandwich
(to Swede) Do you mind waiting a few minutes
(undoing paper package) Oh, sure, sure
If you like to have a sandwich,  can give you one, please
He brings out two huge sandwiches, and hands one to Longfellow
(smiling) Thanks
Thank you
Never mind, Cobb
He takes it, and he and the Swede silently eat
Longfellow looks up
Good
The Swede smiles
Longfellow nibbles his sandwich, then glances around the room
His gaze rests on: 234 Of the long line of applicants waiting for an audience
235 (calls to Cobb) Cobb
Get lunch for the rest of them
430
(entering) What
There must be 2000 of them out there
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry
Okay, Santa Claus
2000 lunches
He exits
Longfellow glances over at the line, smiling
236 In front of the line there is a slight scuffle, as a man is being pushed forward by some others
He mumbles a protest, tries to get back into position, but the men push him forward again
(ad-lib) Go on, say something
Say something
237
- He looks up inquiringly
238
- The man finally is resigned, and stands shifting, ill-at-ease, his head hanging bashfully
Mr
Deeds, the boys here wanted me to say a little something
They just wanted me to say that (clears his throat) Well, they wanted me to say that (quickly gets it out) We think you're swell - and that's no baloney
' Say something more
239
- He smiles self-consciously
240 The spokesman apparently has not finished yet
Directly behind the line, three officious-looking men have made their appearance and wait for him to conclude
Give me a chance, fellas
We're all down and out - but when a fellow like you comes along, kinda gives us a little hope - and they just wanted me to say It's as far as he gets - as the three strangers break their way through the line and approach Longfellow's desk
(ad-lib) Break it up
241 (pointing to Longfellow) That's him
431
2ND Are you Longfellow Deeds
(looks up) Yes
Sheriff's office
(shows paper) We've got a warrant to take you into custody
(without moving) what
warrant for your arrest
You'll have to come along with us
Cobb enters
What's up
What do you mugs want
don't know nothing, buddy
All  know is the Sheriff gives me an insanity warrant to execute
Insanity
Who's says he's insane
They all turn to Charlie, who comes forward
The complainant is a relative of the late Martin Semple
The charges are that Mr
Deeds is insane and incapable of handling the Estate
Oh, somebody got panic-stricken about his giving his dough away, eh
(to sheriff) Where do you think you're going to take him
To the County Hospital
Of course, that's only temporary hearing will follow immediately
242
- As he speaks quietly
That's fine
Just because  want to give this money to people who need it, they think 'm crazy
(cynically) That's marvelous
That makes everything complete
432
243 To include group
Let's get going
Wait a minute
Not so fast
We're going to get a lawyer
'll call Cedar
(thoroughly disillusioned) No, don't bother
As a matter of fact, 'm from Mr
Cedar's office
He represents the complainant
Oh
Longfellow glances up at him and smiles bitterly
Well, let's go
We're wasting a lot of time
He goes to one side of Longfellow, and his partner to the other
They take Longfellow by the arms
He glances down casually and, suddenly, violently pushes the deputies away from him
They are thrown backward; their eyes widen in surprise
(calmly rising) All right, 'll go
But get your hands off me
244 Longfellow starts to walk forward, accompanied by Cobb - and the two deputies and Charlie fall in behind them
(ad-lib) Make way
Make way
245 To be intercut with above scene
They stare, petrified, and mumble to each other
246 Of the farmers and other applicants
The line has fallen out and they stand in a bunch, staring pathetically and hopelessly at the departing group
247 Who stands in f
g
of bunch
What is taking place has slowly penetrated his befuddled brain
The disappointment he feared is here
His body imperceptibly sags, his eyes dim - all hope having gone out of them
: :  reading: " " 433
: 248 guard sits at a desk near a door, talking on the telephone
(on phone) Yes, most everybody in town has been here to see him
Yes, sir
won't
Goodbye Babe rounds the corner quickly, heading for the door
The guard hurriedly hangs up and stands to block her
Sorry, lady (recognizes her) Oh, it's you again
Oh, please
've got to see him
Now listen, sister, for the fourteenth and last time he don't want to see nobody
(pleading) Will you just give him my name
(confidentially) Listen, toots, just between us, there ain't a thing in the world the matter with that guy till  mention your name, then he goes haywire
Babe winces under the blow
249 Longfellow is seated by the far wall, peering moodily out the window
Cobb paces about
Suddenly, he wheels on Longfellow
What are you going to do - just sit back and let them railroad you
It's as pretty a frameup as ever hit this rotten town
If you'd just let me get you a lawyer
Longfellow pays no attention to him
250 As Cobb continues
(raises his voice) You can't walk into that courtroom without being ready to protect yourself in the clinches
Cedar's too smart
With the array of talent he's got lined up against you - you're cooked
434
Longfellow is still unresponsive
Cobb thinks a moment, watching him studiously; then pleading tenderly: Listen, pal -  know just how you feel
blonde in Syracuse put me through the same paces
came out with a sour puss - but full of fight
Come on, you don't want to lay down now
Longfellow is still unresponsive
Do you realize what's happening
They're trying to prove that you're nuts
If they win the case, they'll shove you in the bughouse
The moment they accuse you of it, they have you half licked
You've got to fight
Longfellow disregards him and Cobb sighs, resignedly
251 The guard is reading his paper
Babe is still waiting, pacing
Go on, sit down, won't you
252 As Cobb comes out
The guard gets up to check the door is locked
So long, Mr
Cobb
Cobb, in a troubled frame of mind, doesn't respond and starts down corridor - Babe catches up with him
Corny
Cobb doesn't stop
Babe grabs his arm: Corny
Cobb stops
253 Cobb glares at Babe belligerently
've got to see him
've got to talk to him
Haven't you done enough damage already
(ignoring his attack) Somebody's got to help him
He hasn't got a chance against Cedar
Look, 've been all over town talking to everybody
've got Mac all lined up - and the paper's behind him
And  can get him Livingston, too
With a lawyer like Livingston, he's got a fighting chance
435
(coldly) You're wasting your time
He doesn't want any lawyers
He's sunk so low, he doesn't want help from anybody
(bitterly) You can take a bow for that
(huskily) As swell a guy as ever hit this town, and you crucified him
For a couple of stinking headlines
You've done your bit - now stay out of his way
He exits abruptly, leaving Babe staring despairingly at his disappearing back, his brutal diatribe ringing harshly in her ears
: : "
Semple Heir Charged With Incompetency
'Should Be Confined To An Institution,' Declares Cedar
"Longfellow Deeds Refuses Counsel; Remains Incommunicado
" "Farmers Aroused At Efforts to Balk Their Benefactor
" "Police Surround Courthouse In Anticipation Of Outbreak
" : 254 Of an unruly mob - being jostled by the police
255 The corridor is jammed with curious public endeavoring to gain entrance
Perspiring police fight to keep them back
256 It is practically full
The few empty seats are being quickly filled
People stumble over each other to find a seat
The judge is not yet at his bench
There is a general chatter of excitement and anticipation
257
- Among the spectators Babe sits beside Mac
She stares, expression-less
Mac glances at her sympathetically
258 Featuring the farmer who broke into Longfellow's house
Near him is the Swede we saw - and others
436
259 Cedar and his assistants arrange their papers
Two dignified gentlemen, psychiatrists, await action, arms folded
Near them is Henry Semple, the complainant, his nose twitching nervously
By his side is his wife, sparkling expectantly
260 At which sit a dozen newspaper reporters
261 From a side door Longfellow enters, accompanied by his guard
Immediately the place is astir
As he advances to a chair in front of a table 262
- Necks crane for a glimpse
Whispered conversations take place
263
- He looks guilty, nose twitching more violently than ever
(to Cedar) Here he is
264
- Babe sits up, her eyes riveted on Longfellow
Impulsively she starts to rise, but Mac puts a restraining hand on her
265 Longfellow turns neither to left nor right
He is slumped low in his chair, staring solemnly into space
Cobb breaks into scene and sits down beside him
(full of excitement) Cedar just sent for me
Wants to make a settlement
Here's your chance to get out of the whole mess
What do you say
He gets no response from Longfellow
There is a stir in the courtroom
266 The bailiff calls out as the Judge proceeds to his bench
Quiet, please
The Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, is now in session, the Honorable John May, Judge, presiding
Be seated
267 To include Judge and Longfellow
The court wishes to warn those present that it will tolerate no disturbances
(to Longfellow) Regarding the sanity hearing of Longfellow Deeds, are you represented by counsel, Mr
Deeds
437
Almost imperceptibly, Longfellow shakes his head no
The Judge looks troubled
There is a stir in the courtroom
understand that you have no counsel, Mr
Deeds
In fact, that you have no intention of defending any of these charges
Now, if you wish to change your mind, the hearing can be postponed
Getting no response from Longfellow, the Judge shrugs his shoulders
Proceed
: 268 Cedar is on his feet
(addressing the court) and in the interests of my client, the only other living relative of the late Martin
Semple, we cannot permit a fortune so huge to be dissipated by a person whose incompetency and abnormality we shall prove beyond any reasonable doubt
269 ' have before me a series of articles written by a newspaper woman who was an eye-witness to his conduct ever since he came to New York
on Babe and Mac
Cedar's voice goes on: She tells how, in the midst of a normal conversation, he would suddenly begin playing his tuba
She tells of his attacks upon several of our eminent writers - for no apparent reason
In fact, there are many instances not recorded in these articles in which Mr
Deeds satisfied an unnatural desire to smash people up without provocation
270
- , myself, unable to keep pace with his mental quirks, and constantly fearful of assault, turned down an opportunity to represent him as his attorney
This newspaper woman, whom we have subpoenaed to testify, tells how he tied up traffic for an hour feeding doughnuts to a poor horse
And by his own statement, waiting for that horse to ask for a cup of coffee
438
There is laughter in the courtroom - which quickly subsides when the Judge pounds his gavel
We have photographs to substantiate this little episode, and other photographs showing Mr
Deeds jumping upon a fire engine
This scarcely sounds like the action of a man in whom the disposition of twenty million dollars may safely be entrusted
This writer of these articles - a woman whose intelligence and integrity in the newspaper world is unquestioned - held him in such contempt that she quite aptly named him "The Cinderella Man
" 271
- ' We have witnesses here from Mandrake Falls, his own home town, who will tell of his conduct throughout his lifetime, proving that his derangement is neither recent nor a temporary one
Longfellow's interest is only slightly aroused
He lifts his eyes in a casual glance around him
272 Featuring Cedar
We have others who will tell of his unusual behavior when he invited the great leaders of the musical world to his home, and then proceeded to forcibly eject them
Only recently when he was in the County Hospital for observation, he not only refused to be examined by these gentlemen, the state psychiatrists, but he actually made a violent attack upon them
273
- As Cedar continues talking, to
In these times, with the country incapacitated by economic ailments, and endangered with an undercurrent of social unrest, the promulgation of such a weird, fantastic and impractical plan as contemplated by the defendant, is capable of fomenting a disturbance from which the country may not soon recover
It is our duty to stop it
Our government is fully aware of its difficulties and can pull itself out of its economic rut without the assistance of Mr
Deeds, or any other crackpot
274 Of farmers, the Swede and others
' His attempted action must therefore be attributed to a diseased mind afflicted with hallucinations of grandeur, and obsessed with an insane desire to become a public benefactor
439
275 Featuring Cedar
(suddenly) Your Honor, at this time, we would like to call our first witness: Miss Louise - Babe - Bennett
276 There is a mild stir, and all wait expectantly for Babe to appear
Miss Bennett, please
Babe, eyes on Longfellow, slowly walks to the stand
277
- He has his face averted and doesn't look at her
278 Babe continues to rivet her eyes on Longfellow, as she is sworn in
Raise your right hand, please
She does so
Do you solemnly swear the testimony you may give before this court to be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God
do
State your right name, please
Louise Bennett
Take the stand
279 As Cedar steps up to question Babe
Judge in f
g
Miss Bennett, are you employed by the Morning Mail
There is no answer
Babe continues to stare off at Longfellow, hoping he will look up
Cedar speaks to her again: must ask you to direct your attention to me
But Babe's attention remains focused on Longfellow
(appealing to Judge) Your Honor, this is ridiculous
440
Please answer the questions
(wildly) The whole hearing's ridiculous
That man's no more insane than you are
The suddenness of her outbreak is startling
The Judge pounds his gavel
280
- The Judge pounding his gavel
Miss Bennett please
This is outrageous
(rising to stand) It's obviously a frameup
They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him
Your Honor
The Judge pounds his gavel throughout her speech
(highly) Young lady, another outburst like that and  shall hold you in contempt
We're not interested in your opinion of the merits of this case
You're here to testify
Sit down and answer the questions
Proceed
Cedar beams victoriously
Thank you, Your Honor
Are you employed by the Morning Mail
(sharply) No
Cedar's eyes widen in surprise
There is a light stir
(threateningly) You are under oath, Miss Bennett ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail
(irritably) No
resigned last week
281
- As Cedar proceeds without interruption
441
' Well, prior to that time - were you employed by the Morning Mail
' (laconically) Yes
282
- Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds
Yes
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him
Yes
(holding them up) Are these the articles
Yes
Were you present when all these things took place
Yes
Are they true
But they did take place
They're colored
Just to make him look silly
And you saw them happen
Yes, but (preemptorily) That's all, Miss Bennett
(half shrieking) It isn't all
'd like to explain 442
(brusquely) That's all, Miss Bennett
That's all
283 bailiff takes Babe by the arm
Come on, miss - come on
(simultaneously, to Judge) Your Honor, 'd like to submit these articles as evidence
Babe struggles away from the bailiff
(frantically) Let go of me
(steps up to Judge; wildly) What kind of hearing is this
What are you trying to do - persecute the man
He's not defending himself
Somebody's got to do it
Throughout her tirade, the Judge has been angrily pounding his gavel
Miss Bennett, please
284 Featuring Babe and Judge
've got a right to be heard
've attended dozens of cases like this
They're usually conducted without any formality at all
Anybody can be heard
My opinion is as good as these quack psychiatrists
know him better than they do
Miss Bennett, if you have quite finished, should like to inform you that one more utterance from you and  shall place you under arrest
(leans back) 'm willing to hear anything anyone has to say - but  insist on it being done in an orderly fashion
When you have learned to show some respect for this court, you may return
(dismissing her) Until then, you'd better go back to your seat and calm down
This way, miss
285 As Babe is led away, there is another courtroom stir
' Order in the court
443
When Babe is out of sight, the Judge turns to Longfellow
Mr
Deeds, have you anything to say in defense of these articles
286
- Longfellow shakes his head
Cobb glances to him helplessly
287
- He shrugs
Mr
Deeds
(again no reply) Mark these Exhibit  for the plaintiff
Yes, Your Honor
Proceed
288
- As she sits down beside Mac - who places an affectionate arm around her shoulders
: 289
- Two old ladies are being led to the witness stand
Their eyelids flutter excitedly as they go
290
- He looks up, sees the old ladies and smiles at them friendily
291
' Against the drone of the clerk, who swears witnesses in: The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together
If the court pleases,  will only have one of them testify
(impatiently) Yes
Yes
Let's get on with it
Cedar turns to them
292 As Cedar addresses one of the old ladies
What is your name, please
Jane Falkner
This is my sister, Amy
(agreeing) Yes - Amy
444
'll direct my questions to you, Miss Jane
You can answer for both
Do you know the defendant, Mr
Longfellow Deeds
The two old ladies look at each other, then in the direction in which Cedar points
Oh yes, yes - of course we know him
(a little nervously) How long have you known him
Jane turns to her sister, and they whisper to each other
(turns to Cedar) Since he was born
Yes
Elsie Taggart was the midwife
He was a seven-months baby
Thank you, that's fine
Do you see him very often
The two old ladies have their whispered conference again
Most every day
Sometimes twice
(irascibly) Must we have the echo
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane
Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds
The two old ladies consult each other once more
They think he's pixilated
Oh yes, pixilated
(leaning forward) He's what
(concerned) What was that you said he was
445
Pixilated
Uh-huh
(patiently) Now, that's a rather strange word to use, Miss Jane
Can you tell the court exactly what it means
While the two ladies go into a huddle: 293
- As one of them speaks up
Perhaps  can explain, Your Honor
The word pixilated is an early American expression - derived from the word 'pixies,' meaning elves
They would say, 'The pixies had got him,' as we nowadays would say a man is 'balmy
' 294 The Judge nods his understanding
The Falkner sisters nod in pleasant agreement
Cedar sighs victoriously
Is that correct
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Now tell me, why does everyone think he's - uh - pixilated
Does he do peculiar things
295 (after conferring with Amy) He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself
Sometimes he whistles
And sings
Anything else
Recently he gave Chuck Dillon a thumping
Blacked his eye
446
And why
For no reason,  guess
He always does it
We always run into the house when we see him coming
Never can tell what he's going to do
He sure is pixilated
Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right
Thank you, ladies
That's all
Cedar beams
The old ladies leave to resume their seats
: 296 policeman in uniform
They kept hollering: "Back to Nature
Back to Nature
"  thought they looked harmless enough so  took them home
never thought he was cracked
: 297 The waiter at "Tullio's
" 'm a waiter
He kept pressing me to point out the celebrities, and so help me Hannah 'm coming out of the kitchen a coupla minutes later and there he is moppin' up the floors with them
never figured he was a guy looking for trouble

(expostulating) He threw us out bodily
But bodily
: 299 Of one of the bodyguards on witness stand
We was hired as his bodyguard, see
Well, the first crack out of the box, he throws us in a room and locks the door, see
Now, if a thing like that gets around in our profession, we'd get the bird - see
So  says to my partner, "Let's quit this guy, he's nuts

She's a nice 'orse
And when this bloke 'ere started feedin' 'er doughnuts,  yelled down to him, "Mind what you're doin' down there

" Of course  wouldn't mind, sir, but Clara won't eat nothin' but doughnuts, now
: 301
[13] Of one of the photographers (Bob) and enlarged photographs of Longfellow's antics
' Come to order
Your Honor,  wish to call your attention to these exhibits
Mr
Davis, do you recognize these reproductions
Sure, they're good enlargements
Where'd you have them made
Did you make the originals of them
Sure
took the originals
Taking pictures is my business
photograph a lot of nuts
: As Cedar speaks
And now, Your Honor, if the court pleases, shall call upon Dr
Emil Von Holler, if he will be good enough to give us his opinion
Dr
Von Holler, as you know, is the eminent Austrian psychiatrist - probably the greatest authority on the subject in the world
At present he is in this country on a lecture tour, and has graciously volunteered his services
Dr
Von Holler
While he is still speaking, Dr
Von Holler
448
: 302 As the clerk finishes swearing Dr
Von Holler in
Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give in the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God
State your right name, please
(a slight Austrian accent) Emil Von Holler
Take the stand
303 On Von Holler and Cedar
Now Dr
Von Holler, will you kindly tell the court what your opinion is on this case
This is purely a case of manic depression
In cases of this kind, patients sometimes go on for years before being detected
He turns to one of the psychiatrists, sitting with the Judge
You remember, Dr
Fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples
(nodding) Uh-huh
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember
Oh, yes
Yes, of course Dr
Von Holler
Very interesting
It reminds me very much of this one
Nicht wahr
Ja
It takes so long to detect them (to Judge) because their mood changes so often and so quickly
Now, Your Honor, may show you
May  use the chart
449
By all means
He moves to a blackboard
There are chalk marks on it
straight line runs diagonally across the center
Other lines run zig-zag over and below this center line
(indicating chart) Below here, they are extremely depressed, melancholy, impossible to live with, and often become violent
(running a line up) From this mood the manic depressive might gradually change until they reach this state
(he reaches the center line) Here is lucidity
Here they are perfectly normal
As normal as you or (smiling) assuming, of course, that we are normal
(he starts up with chalk) Then, the mood changes again until (chalk reaches top) they reach this state, a state of highest exaltation
Here everything is fine
Here the world is beautiful
Here they are so elated - how do you express it
(quickly, as it comes to him) they would give you the shirt off their backs
Dr
Von Holler, how would you say that applied to Mr
Deeds's case
The symptoms are obvious
(points to top line) When he was here, on top of the wave, he felt nothing but kindliness and warmth toward his fellow-men
He wanted them around him
So he decided he would give a big reception
But in the meantime, his mood has changed
(chalk goes down) He is now at the bottom of the wave - depressed - melancholy
So, when his guests arrive, he throws them out
They are now his imaginary enemies
304
- As Von Holler's voice continues: ' Other instances of high elation are when he plays his tuba, when he writes his poetry, when he chases fire engines in his desire to help humanity
This is contrasted with his present mood, which is so low that even the instinct for self-preservation is lacking
305 Von Holler still continues: Oh, the man is verrukt
Your Honor, this is decidedly a case of a manic depressive
450
Thank you, Dr
Von Holler
Dr
Von Holler returns to his seat
Your Honor, we rest
306
- There is a shifting of bodies, and a renewed interest, as they wait for the next move
The Judge and his own two experts go into an inaudible huddle
307
- Longfellow is slumped in his seat, head down
Come on, what're you going to do
Let them get away with it
They got you cooked
Longfellow does not budge
There is an expectant stir in the courtroom among the spectators and rows of reporters
308
- Judge comes out of his huddle and glances at Longfellow
(leaning forward) Mr
Deeds, before the court arrives at a decision, isn't there anything you wish to say
309
- Longfellow shakes his head slightly
(whispering) Come on - don't be a sap
308 The Judge watches him a few moments, hesitatingly, and then turns to his experts
310
- He's sunk
311
-    , They smirk confidently
312
- She stares, panic-stricken
313 Of the Swede, the farmer, and others
Their faces show their resentment
314 (to the two experts) You both concur
451
(ad-lib) Oh, positively
The Judge emerges from his consultation with his experts and addresses Longfellow
Mr
Deeds, in view of the extensive testimony and your continued silence and upon recommendation of the doctors, the Court considers it advisable for your own safety that you be committed to an institution as prescribed by law
You need medical attention, Mr
Deeds
(shrugs) Perhaps in a little while Suddenly the air is rent with the shrill voice of Babe
No
No
No
Wait a minute
All are startled and look up
Babe runs right to the Judge
You can't do it
You've got to make him talk
' Your Honor,  object
She turns directly to Longfellow - leaning over close to him
315
- (pleading softly) Oh, darling, please
know everything 've done
know how horrible 've been
No matter what happens, if you never see me again, do this for me
' Miss Bennett, please
(frantically) You said  could speak
You said  could have my say if  were rational
'm rational
Please, let me take the witness chair
316 He must be made to defend himself before you arrive at a decision
Very well
Take the stand
Babe goes up to the witness stand and sits down
Oh, thank you
452
(shouting) Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case
object
Let her speak
know why he won't defend himself
That has a bearing on the case, hasn't it
He's been hurt
He's been hurt by everybody's he met since he came here, principally by me
He's been the victim of every conniving crook in town
The newspapers pounced on him - made him a target for their feeble humor
317
- was smarter than the rest of them
got closer to him so  could laugh louder
Why shouldn't he keep quiet
Every time he said anything it was twisted around to sound imbecilic
318
- As she continues
He can thank me for it
handed the gang a grand laugh
This is a fitting climax to my sense of humor
319 As Cedar protests
But Your Honor - this is preposterous
The Judge waves him down with a dismissing gesture of his hand
Certainly  wrote those articles was going to get a raise - and a month's vacation
But  stopped writing them when  found out what he was all about
When  realized how real he was
320
- As Babe's voice continues: ' He could never fit in with our distorted viewpoint because he's honest and sincere - and good
If that man is crazy, Your Honor, the rest of us belong in straight-jackets
321 Cedar jumps up
Your Honor, this is absurd
The woman's obviously in love with him
453
What's that got to do with it
(shouting) Well, you are in love with him, aren't you
(shouting back) What's that got to do with it
(louder) You are , aren't you
(just as loud) Yes
322
- To be intercut during her speech
At first he merely glances up at her speculatively
Finally, he begins to show some interest
323 Cedar turns to the Judge
Your Honor, her testimony is of no value
Why shouldn't she defend him
It's a tribute to American womanhood - the instinct to protect the weak
'm not saying that nobody likes the boy cherish a fond affection for him myself
But that doesn't mean to say In the middle of his speech, Mac - the editor - appears at his elbow
When the windbag here gets through, Your Honor, 'd like to verify what Miss Bennett said
'm her editor
When she quit her job, she told me what a swell fellow this man was
And anything Babe Bennett says is okay with me
If you have anything to say, you will take the stand
've already said it, Your Honor just thought 'd like to get my two cents in
As he starts to go, , he passes Longfellow
He nudges him
Don't be a sucker, pal
Stand up and speak your piece
He disappears to his seat
Your Honor, 've got a couple of cents 'd like to put in 454
Sit down
've been with this man ever since he came to New York 324 Shooting toward the Judge
He pounds his gavel, interrupting Cobb
Sit down
There will be no further interruptions
Almost simultaneously with the Judge's speech, the farmer, somewhere in the audience, rises to his feet
How about us, Mr
Deeds
325 Shooting toward audience
As the farmer finishes, a dozen others are on their feet
(ad-lib) Yes
What about us, Mr
Deeds
You're not going to leave us out in the cold
They're trying to frame you, Mr
Deeds
The turmoil is general, with bailiffs running to quiet them
The Judge pounding his gavel, incensed
' Order
Order
(when quiet reigns) In the interest of Mr
Deeds,  have tolerated a great deal of informality
But if there is one more outburst, shall have the courtroom cleared
Your Honor (surprised) Yes
'd like to get in my two cents' worth
Take the stand
There is a general stir of excitement - and whispering
326
- Her eyes sparkle happily
455
327
- The clients look up at Cedar, concerned
Cedar comforts them with a confident grimace
328 To include Longfellow, Judge, and others around them
Longfellow hesitates
Proceed
Well,  don't know where to begin
There's been so many things said about me that 329 Longfellow continues: About my playing the tuba
Seems like a lot of fuss has been made about that
If a man's crazy just 'cause he plays the tuba, then somebody better look into it, 'cause there are a lot of tuba players running around loose
Of course, don't see any harm in it
play mine whenever  want to concentrate
That may sound funny to some people - but everybody does something silly when they're thinking
For instance, the Judge here is an -filler
330 Front of courtroom
what
An -filler
You fill in all the spaces in the 's, with your pencil
(points to desk) was watching you
The Judge looks down at a paper in front of him
: Of some sort
All the 's and 's and 's have the white spaces pencilled in
331
- As he looks up from the document
He is a trifle self-conscious
Laughter comes from the courtroom
' That may make you look a little crazy, Your Honor, just sitting around filling in 's - but  don't see anything wrong 'cause that helps you to think
Other people are doodlers
Doodlers
456
332
- That's a name we made up back home for people who make foolish designs on paper when they're thinking
It's called doodling
Almost everybody's a doodler
Did you ever see a scratch pad in a telephone booth
People draw the most idiotic pictures when they're thinking
Dr
Von Holler, here, could probably think up a long name for it, because he doodles all the time
Dr
Von Holler, who is in the middle of some doodling, flinches
roar of laughter comes from the spectators
Longfellow reaches over to where Dr
Von Holler sits and picks up a piece of paper
(to Dr
Von Holler) Thank you
(returning to the stand) This is a piece of paper he was scribbling on
(scrutinizes it) can't figure it out
One minute it looks like a chimpanzee - and the next minute it looks like a picture of Mr
Cedar
(hands it to him) You look at it, Judge
The Judge, with a serious mien, takes the paper
: It is a doodle face
: Dr
Von Holler is somewhat uncomfortable
Exhibit  - for the defense
(after a pause) Looks kind of stupid, doesn't it, Your Honor
But  guess that's all right if Dr
Von Holler has to doodle to help him think
That's his business
Everybody does something different
Some people are (demonstrates) ear-pullers - some are nail-biters (pointing) That Mr
Semple over there is a nose-twitcher
333
- He looks up, startled, his nose twitching more violently than ever
The courtroom rocks with laughter
His wife, in her nervousness, pulls at her fingers
' And the lady next to him is a knuckle-cracker
Mrs
Semple quickly drops her hands in her lap, as the courtroom again fills with laughter
457
334
- He swings a key-ring around his forefinger
Suddenly he realizes Longfellow might get to him, and he hastily palms the keys and shoves them in his pocket
335
- One is leaning forward, listening intently - biting the end of his pencil
The one next to him nudges him and silently points to the pencil in his mouth
The reporter gets the idea and, smiling sheepishly, yanks it out of his mouth
336
- So you see, everybody does silly things to help them think
(in conclusion) Well,  play the tuba
337
- As he bursts forth
Nice work, toots
The crowd echoes him with shouts and laughter
338
- He glares off scene at Mac, reprimandingly
339
- She is amused at the embarassment Longfellow has caused them all
340
- They squirm uncomfortably
341 Longfellow in chair - Judge at bench, b
g
Mr
Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home
Oh, yes
Yes
About my throwing those people out of my house
Mrs
Pomponi told the truth
did throw them out because  didn't want the party in the first place
didn't invite anybody
Mrs
Pomponi did all that
They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was
don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, 'll stick to simple folks
She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything
If  were a friend of hers, 'd have her examined
342 Featuring Longfellow
Cedar, who cannot stand it any longer, jumps to his feet
458
Your Honor, this is becoming farcical
demand that Mr
Deeds dispense with side remarks and confine himself to facts
Let him explain his wanderings around the streets in underclothes, his feeding doughnuts to horses
' Proceed
Mr
Cedar's right
Those things do look kind of bad, don't they
But to tell the truth, Your Honor,  don't remember them
guess they happened, all right, because  don't think a policeman would lie about a thing like that, but  was drunk
It was the first time  was ever drunk in my life
It's probably happened to you, some time
mean, when you were younger, of course
The Judge clears his throat in embarrassment
Several women giggle
The Judge sternly pounds his gavel
343
- It's likely to happen to anybody
Just the other morning  read in the paper about Mr
Cedar's own son - about how he got drunk and insisted on driving a taxi-cab, while the driver sat inside
Isn't that so, Mr
Cedar
Isn't that so , Mr
Cedar
344 All eyes have turned to Cedar
345
- His eyes are beginning to blaze angrily
Your Honor,  object
Proceed
346 Now about the Falkner sisters
That's kind of funny
mean about Mr
Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here
Do you mind if talk to them
Not at all
Longfellow turns
Everybody stretches to get a better look at them
Jane, who owns the house you live in
459
347
- The girls consult with each other
Why, you own it, Longfellow
Yes, you own it
' Do you pay any rent
(after conferring with Amy) No, we don't pay any rent
Good heavens, no
We never pay rent
348 As Longfellow continues questioning: Are you happy there
Oh, yes
Yes, indeed
Now, Jane, a little while ago you said was pixilated
Do you still think so
(after the usual conference) Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow
Always
(smiling) That's fine
guess maybe  am
(seriously) Now tell me something, Jane
Who else in Mandrake Falls is pixilated
Jane turns to her sister and this time they go into a prolonged huddle
It is apparently a difficult thing to figure out
Finally they come out of it
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us
Uh-huh
349 There is an outburst of laughter which the Judge quickly quells with his gavel
460
350
- Now, just one more question
Do you see the Judge here
He's a nice man, isn't he
& Uh-huh
Do you think he's pixilated
(quickly) Oh, yes
Yes, indeedy
There is more laughter
More pounding of the judiciary gavel
351
- He feels his case slowly crumbling
352
- She can scarcely conceal her elation
353
- Mr
Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing
This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune
It is, to say the least, most uncommon
Oh yes,  was getting to that, Your Honor
, featuring Longfellow and Judge, as former continues: Suppose you were living in a small town and getting along fine, and suddenly somebody dropped $20,000,000 in your lap
Supposing you discovered that all that money was messing up your life, was bringing a lot of vultures around your neck, and making you lose faith in everybody
You'd be a little worried, wouldn't you
You'd feel that you had a hot potato in your hand, and you'd want to drop it
guess Dr
Von Holler would say you were riding on (points to chart) those bottom waves, 'cause you wanted to drop something that was burning your fingers
354 Cedar springs to his feet
(shouting) If this man is permitted to carry out his plan, repercussions will be felt that will rock the foundations of our entire governmental system
461
The Judge has pounded him into silence
Please, Mr
Cedar
(to Longfellow) Proceed
355 Personally,  don't know what Mr
Cedar's raving about
From what  can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers
356 Farmers in audience, as Longfellow's voice continues: ' It's like the road out in front of my house
It's on a steep hill
Every day watch the cars climbing up
Some go lickety-split up that hill on high 357 some have to shift into second - and some sputter and shake and slip back to the bottom again
Same cars - same gasoline - yet some make it and some don't
And  say the fellows who can make the hill on high should stop once in a while and help those who can't
358 (making his point) That's all 'm trying to do with this money
Help the fellows who can't make the hill on high
359
- (hotly) What does Mr
Cedar expect me to do with it
Give it to him - and a lot of other people who don't need it
(rising; sarcastically) If you don't mind, Your Honor, 'll ride on those top waves for a minute
(calls out) Hey, all you fellows out there
All those who applied for a farm, stand up
360 Showing most of the audience struggling to their feet
462
361
- See all those fellows
They're the ones 'm trying to help
They need it
(pointing) Mr
Cedar and that Mr
Semple don't need anything
They've got plenty
It's like 'm out in a big boat and  see one fellow in a rowboat who's tired of rowing and wants a free ride - and another fellow who's drowning
Who would you expect me to rescue
Mr
Cedar, who just got tired of rowing and wants a free ride
Or those men out there who are drowning
Any ten-year-old child will give you the answer to that
(to farmers etc
in courtroom) All right, fellows
Thank you
Sit down
362
- Now, my plan is very simple
was going to give each family ten acres - a horse, a cow and some seed
And if they work the farm for three years, it's theirs
Now, if that's crazy, maybe  ought to be sent to an institution
But don't think it is
And what's more, Mr
Cedar doesn't either
(vehemently) Just before the hearing started, he offered to call the whole thing off if  made a settlement with him
So you see, he wouldn't think  was crazy if he got paid off
363
- He jumps to his feet, highly incensed
It's a lie
Mr
Cedar
Mr
Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination
364
- As he listens to Cedar, watching him antagonistically
' 've never heard anything so colossally stupid in my life
Longfellow's eyes narrow resentfully
365 To include Longfellow, Cedar and Judge
It's an insult to our intelligence to sit here and listen to his childish ravings
463
Throughout his speech the Judge has been pounding his gavel
Longfellow has his eyes levelled off on Cedar
(when quiet reigns) You will please permit Mr
Deeds to finish
But Your Honor Mr
Cedar
Cedar, grumblingly, remains standing
Judge asks Longfellow: Anything else, Mr
Deeds
(eyes still on Cedar) No
(changes his mind; turns to Judge) Yes
There's just one more thing 'd like to get off my chest before  finish
Proceed
Thank you, Your Honor
He rises to his feet, takes one step forward, and clouts Cedar flush on the jaw
As Cedar falls into the arms of an associate, pandemonium breaks loose
' Order
Order
Order in the court
366 The Judge pounds his gavel
There are cries of approval from the spectators
In the midst of the commotion : 367 Showing spectators, waiting breathlessly for a decision
All eyes are on the Judge
368 The Judge holds a whispered conversation with his experts
369
- She is apprehensive
370
- He glances furtively at Babe, off scene
371 Leaning forward
Their entire future hangs in the balance
372 The Judge comes out of the huddle; his face is very stern
464
' Remain seated and come to order
The Court is again in session
Before the Court announces its decision, want to warn all who are here that the police have orders to arrest anyone creating a disturbance
373 Of Babe - Cobb - Longfellow - Mac - the farmers
374
:   - The Judge's preface augurs ill
375
- His mouth curls up in a contented grimace
376
- All eyes are upon the Judge, who clears his throat
(serious mien) Mr
Deeds, there has been a great deal of damaging testimony against you
Your behavior, to say the least, has been most strange
An audible gasp is heard from audience
Judge goes on: But in the opinion of the Court, you are not only sane, but you are the sanest man that ever walked into this courtroom
Case dismissed
The shout that greets this is tumultuous
The Judge smiles warmly, and clasps Longfellow's hand
Immediately, Longfellow is surrounded by a crowd of people who come running down the aisles
377
- They sit, stunned, disappointed
Mrs
Semple turns to her husband and slaps him
You nose-twitcher
Budington rises to confront Cedar
Oh,  knew it
knew it
You, you Cedar disgustedly pushes him in the face, aside
378
- She smiles ecstatically, too excited to move
Suddenly she rises
379 As Babe tries to get to Longfellow, but finds herself on the fringe of a jubilant crowd in the center of which is Longfellow
She tries to break through, but finds it impossible
Desperately, she jumps on a chair and tries frantically to get a glimpse of him
At that moment, several farmers have lifted Longfellow on their shoulders
380
- As jubilantly, Longfellow is carried out on the shoulders of the excited crowd
465
381 As Babe frantically tries to reach Longfellow, but is jostled aside
The parade envelops her
382 The shouting mob is heading for the door at end of courtroom
Everyone crowds forward
383 Babe is left helplessly out
: 384 Empty - except for the Falkner sisters, still whispering to each other, and Babe, sitting helpless and forlorn
385
- Her eyes are filled
Dismally she starts forward
We hear a rising commotion from the outside, at this moment
386 Longfellow running toward camera with the mob, shouting, back of him
He reaches courtroom, slams the doors shut behind him
Babe, attracted by the noise, looks up
He runs toward her, and swoops her up in his arms
387
-  & He's still pixilated
He sure is
388
- She kisses him over and over again
He looks around and over his shoulder at the mob, a little dazed
Finally, he notices her effort, and gives her one passionately back
All that is heard is the cheering of the crowd outside and the Columbia music
