The General's assistant,  , sits at his desk, working
After a moment Putkin seems to come to a decision
() Boone
Yes General

Yes sir
The General stands up, smooths down his uniform, steps out from behind his desk and begins to walk
Boone watches, with some trepidation, as the General increases his pace
He quickens to a jog, his face set with determination
He breaks into a run
Then he slams into the  of the office, rebounds and lies splayed on the floor
He stares up at the wall balefully

He wears glasses, is attractive in a fresh-faced, enthusiastic kind of way

(
) My name is Bob Wilton
Imagine me back in Michigan, where  was born and raised
studied journalism at Western in Kalamazoo and then got a job at the Ann Arbor Daily Telegram

Ron suddenly pitches violently forward, thudding face- first into his desk

-                                           9 Bob is clearing Ron's desk, putting his possessions into a box
(
) My wife, Debora, told me later that Ron's death had been like a wake-up call for her - what people used to call a memento mori
Bob sits down, feeling a little ghoulish, at the dead man's desk
He notices a large  on the leather in front of him - the mark left by Ron's forehead
He touches it, fascinated
(') (
) (') That massive coronary had reminded her that life was too short to waste any chance of true happiness
Bob rests his own forehead, experimentally, onto the indentation, and sits there, face down on the desk
His eyes wander over to where Dave and Debora are talking in Dave's office

Bob is drinking
We to Bob crying, smashing a lamp, Debora shouting at him
(
) ( sad chuckle) It seemed like such a tragedy at the time
We couldn't see beyond our little lives to the great events of history unfolding out there in the world
to Dave holding Bob in a head-lock with his one good arm
Debora is sitting, head in hands
(') (
) (') was like a child
Or a Hobbit, safe in the Shire
to Bob alone in the trashed room, exhausted and drunk, watching Bush's      on
(') (
) (') Or a blonde farm boy on a distant, desert planet, unaware that he was already taking the first steps on the path that will lead him inexorably towards the heart of a conflict between the forces of Good and Evil
(on ) Americans are a resolute people, who have risen to every test of our time
Adversity has revealed the character of our country, to the world, and to ourselves
Bob wipes his eyes, stares at the screen
(
) Had  known where that path would lead, had a soft wind from my future brought me the name of Bill Django,  might never have gone
But as it was,  did what so many men have done throughout history when a woman has broken their heart
went to war
We hear the opening of a period song as we

footage from the Iraq War - a dizzying  montage, war made pop- video
Shots include
""Shock and Awe" air attack on Baghdad Caravans of
troops snaking through the desert Fighter plane video of an Iraqi fighter jet being destroyed on the ground Oil Wells ablaze Jessica Lynch being rescued by Special Forces

Yeah, no it's been
well,  won't lie to you Debora - it's been pretty damn hairy

've seen things that you shouldn't, you know
He shakes his head sadly
(') Pretty damn hairy
(
) Well  don't even know why you're there
You're not exactly war correspondent material are you
() Well,  think it's important people get an accurate picture of what's
(
) (to someone else) What
Yeah
() what's, uh, happening, so
is that Dave
(
) Yeah
He says Hi
Bob stares out of the window, nodding, afraid he might start to cry
Oh, that's, that's

Gotta go
We're moving out - heading up north to cover the fighting there

Yeah
They laugh
How
() 've been stuck here
They've only just given me the green-light
So 'll probably head over there soon
'm just working on this story about American contractors coming over for the re-build
The Journalists look bored
(') Yeah,  think they didn't want me going over because 'm not embedded
Yeah, they don't like the unilats
The troops think the unilats'll stab `em in the back
When you're you form a bond with the soldiers
You're like one of them

-                                  15 Bob sits drinking more coffee
(To Waiter) So what's a useful phrase
La termi, ana sahafi
Bob repeats this
What's that mean
Don't shoot, 'm a reporter
He walks off
Bob sighs, continues  in his notebook
We see he has covered the page in stylized drawings of

What's your pitch
The man considers this
He looks up and we see his face for the first time - handsome, older than Bob, tanned, a moustache, a slightly haunted expression
This is Well
we're real cheap
Bob waits for more, but that's it
He holds out his hand

Could  bum a smoke, Skip
Lyn shoves the packet across the table
Bob sits down across from him, pats himself down for a lighter, glances over to where the two embedded Journalists are joking with some Marines
Bob watches them jealously
(') (
) (') sat there watching those reporters and realized  didn't want to be me anymore
wanted to be them
wanted to face peril and stand witness to the fall and rise of nations
Suddenly the   above them flickers and goes out
Lyn and Bob sit in the dark
(') (
) (') Everyone gets everything he wants
Like the man said
wanted a mission
(') (patting his pockets in the dark) Oh crap, can't find my
ignites in Lyn's hand, eerily lighting the lower half of his face, his eyes hidden by the brim of the cap
Bob leans forward to light his cigarette and finds himself staring at the

The name on the badge reads

Gus has a sun-bed tan and odd hair
His nervous looking  sits beside them
Gus is holding up a for Bob to see - the cover, illustrated with a picture of Gus, reads "Free To Roam - Learn
from the master
" Then there's the seminars
When 'm not teaching  spend a lotta time, right here, remote viewing
Right here

That is correct

That's an exclusive for you
Okay
Wow
of Bob's notebook - on which he has written You are Crazy
(') So
when did this all start for you Gus
It started when  was a kid used to lie on my bed and  my cousin, Irene, undressing at night
Then, when  was in the army  joined Bill Django's unit
He trained me and the rest, as they say
Right
don't know who that is
Gus gives a dreamy smile
can't really talk about Bill
So what did you do in the army
We were Psychic Spies mainly
That was our initial tasking but
once they realized what they were sitting on, the forces at work
He stops, his face darkening
(') We were trained to kill animals
() You mean, what
with your
With our minds
That is correct
Just by staring at them
() 14
17   : (2)                                            17 () Huh
What kind of animals
One of our unit stopped the heart of a goat
Wow
(Beat)  don't know what to say
The power they unlocked in us
(Beat, sorrowfully) Last week killed my hamster

Bob and Gus sit watching the
Gus' mother hovers in the background
You ever seen a hamster do that before
Well, 've never owned a hamster Gus, so  don't know what
Look at the way it's glaring at its wheel
Usually that hamster loves its wheel
Maybe some of the readers have hamsters so
Good
Then they'll know how rare that is
Yeah,  guess any hamster-owning readers will know what's aberrant behavior and, uh, what's
Oh, shit, he's down
one of the hamsters has fallen over
() 15
18   :                                                18 Yeah, he's down
At this point 'd been staring at him for about three hours
The other hamster falls over
Oh my God
You've dropped both hamsters
No, the other one's just fallen over
They watch in silence
Then the hamsters get up and start eating
(') (switching off the ) Bizarre
Right
Well
it didn't die
thought you said you killed it
() Yeah well
(He gestures to his Mother) Mother said no
She said you might be a bleeding-heart liberal
She said "Don't show him the hamster dying
Show him the tape where the hamster acts bizarre instead
" Bob looks to Gus' Mother who manages to look nervous and defiant at the same time
Gus stares at the blank , sips his coffee
(') This was nothing
You should have seen the Skipper at work
Who's the Skipper

After Bill he was the most psi-gifted guy  ever met
He was like an Occultic force

He follows him around a corner and skids to a halt
Lyn is facing him, standing on one leg, hands raised above his head in an odd martial arts stance
He emits a threatening croon
Bob raises his hands nervously
Whoa
You working for Hooper
Hooper
No
work for the Ann Arbor Daily Telegram
How do you know about Lacey
interviewed him a few years ago
He'd been appearing on this radio talk show
Lyn relaxes his martial arts stance, shakes his head ruefully
Little prick

Who's Bill Django
(shaking his head in ) Did he show you his "Home Study Course"
Yes
(walking off down the ) Yeah  bet he did
(hurrying after him) Are you
Do you mean you corroborate his, uh
Because, see,  thought he was just an idiot
() He is an idiot
or he was
he's dead now
He was a paranormal whore
Always trying to get into the spotlight, yak, yak yaking
We took an oath
We don't divulge
But you're saying there was a secret unit

We
don't
divulge

Okay
Let me ask you something
What color were the chairs in the hotel bar
() Uh

21   :                                                21 You were in there for hours
What color were the chairs
Um
brown
They were green
How many lights are there in this room
Bob starts to look around
(') Super Soldier wouldn't need to look
He would just know
Super Soldier
Jedi Warrior
He would know where all the lights were
He could walk through a room and tell you how many power outlets there were
People are walking around with their eyes closed
At Level One we were trained to instantly absorb all details
() What's a Jedi Warrior
You're looking at one
You're a Jedi Warrior
That's correct
What does that
don't think () 'm Sergeant First Class Lyn Cassady, Special Forces, retired
In the eighties was trained at Fort Bragg in a secret initiative code-named Project Jedi
The objective of the project was to create Super Soldiers

That's correct
Hold on, let me
let me just
He takes out his , fumbling, trying to get into journalist mode
(') Okay, so, so you're saying you were a Psychic Spy, like Lacey
We prefer the term Remote Viewer
How does that work
Different Jedi had different techniques
Mel Landau used to visualize packing all his cares and worries in a little suitcase, to clear his mind
Steve Cuttle used to read Bible verse
What about you
Lyn thinks about it
Well,  find drinking helps
Also if 'm listening to classic rock music
Yeah
(Beat) Like who
like Boston
Boston usually works
Bob jots this down in the notebook
() What other powers did you practise
() 20
21   : (3)                                         21 Invisibility
(Taken aback) Invisibility
Yup
That was Level Three
Actual invisibility
Well
yeah, that was the goal
But after a while we adapted it to just finding a way of not being seen
When you understand the, the linkage between observation and reality, you learn to dance with invisibility
Bob tries to follow this
Like camouflage
It's not like camouflage
We also practised Phasing
Crossing from particle to wave, from the physical realm to the plane of energy
Solid objects seem to pass right through you
It's starts with a breathing exercise
Lyn makes a weird shallow
(') Then you think black
That's the nothingness
Bob watches him solemnly as he continues his weird panting
don't
can  be honest, Lyn don't know what to make of this don't know what to say
This is amazing stuff
(Beat) How would you
wanna
could  write a story about this
Lyn stops panting, takes a swig of whiskey, stares at the bottle, suddenly taciturn
Not going to happen

21   : (4)                                           21 No, but see, 've been looking for a story Lyn
was going to write about the re-build contracts but this
this is even better and Not going to happen
All 'm saying is we could talk some more tomorrow and
'm shipping out tomorrow
You're going home
Going to Iraq
There's this factory we might be partnering with in Al Qaim
Bob's face falls
Oh
They sit in silence for a moment
Lyn passes Bob the whiskey
He takes a swig, his mind whirring
(') () could come
() What
could come with you, maybe, and
Bob,  don't want to be a story, okay
don't need the attention and
No, listen, we could change names, stuff could stay off record and

Bob flushes with annoyance
Well you know, you don't
look after myself
Okay

He takes it from Bob and examines Bob's
What's this
What
Nothing
was just doodling
Lyn examines Bob - something
(') What's the matter
() Nothing
He considers for a moment, struggling with himself, then seems to reluctantly come to a decision
He reaches into the bag on his bed and pulls out a dog-eared
He hands it to Bob
Bob examines the book - on the cover is a picture of Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man and the title Pentagon Report 92245
The New Earth Army Manual
Bob stares at the book
He opens the first page and reads

With one touch
Jesus
There's a story that Wong Wifu, great Chinese martial artist, had a fight with some guy and had him beat when the guy gave him this light tap, and Wong looked at him and the guy just nodded
That was it
He'd given him the death touch and Wong died
