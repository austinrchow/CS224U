Written by Judd Apatow April 29, 2008 - , 42, sits in a giant living room watching bad television on a 70-inch flat screen
He looks bored and empty
After a few beats he pauses the , and picks up the phone
(on the phone) Hey, it's George Simmons, 'm coming in
- Shots of George doing stand up on stage at a comedy club
The place adores him
We see quick images of him after the show interacting with people
He is clearly a very famous comedian
- George has sex with a girl in her early twenties
- George sits back down, the thrill of his performance is gone, he is bored and alone again
He hits play on his  and begins watching his show from the same spot it was at before
:"   " - -  - wakes up in a large, clean, modern house
He is all alone
We get the feeling that he hired someone to decorate his house
It is very nice, but doesn't seem personal to him at all
It feels new, with all the gadgets, but a little cold
On the kitchen table is a stack of scripts he is supposed to read
'  - George hits balls in his home batting cage
Then we see him driving golf balls inside there
In the background we see his modern, space ship looking house
It is enormous
2
- George walks into a fancy, steam-filled shower
- George drives his large black Mercedes
- George gets out of his car and walks towards the tower
Two walk over
Hey George, can  get a picture with you
Sure buddy
Let's do it
One of the college students put his arm around George while the other takes the picture
#2 Can  get one
Yeah bud
They take the picture
You're the man
We love all your movies, even the last one
Thanks
Tell your friends
'  - George sits in the doctor's office staring at the photos of the doctor with his beautiful young children enters and sits down
He takes a deep breath
like those lunestas
They really put me to sleep without giving me the sleeping pill hangover  get from the restorils
() 3
( '  ) () try not to take them too often
Just when  know  have to get up early
George there are some irregularities in your blood work
George's face turns white
He knows what this means
The doctor keeps talking but the sound keeps coming in and out-- it is now all a jumble of words
' We see photos of the doctor's family, his graduation certificates, files of other cases, odd doctor's office art, a picture of him skiing with his family
He keeps talking, but now we hear nothing
- " 's  " - George walks down the stairs towards the parking lot in a daze
An   and her  and  see him and start screaming
Oh my God
Can you take a picture with me
Yeah, sure
She puts her arm around him
Her little brother jumps in too
Thanks
You are the funniest
Thanks, pal
- George drives home
We hear the voice of his doctor in his head
4
(
0
) It's a rare blood disorder
In the family of Hodgkins disease
We really don't have a treatment for it
There are things we can try
They're all very experimental in nature
(

) don't understand what this means
(

) think you need to hope for the best and prepare for the worst
Is there someone who can help you get your affairs in order
'  - , a 25-year-old, works at the deli counter, along with , a large, sweet-looking 45-year-old deli counter lifer, and , a very skinny, very old, straight-talking, humorless woman in her fifties
Ira is in the middle of a very long conversation with a middle-aged
Is the turkey organic
Yes, ma'am
Well what does organic mean
It means there's no additives or preservatives and it's hormone free
Are there additives or preservatives in the food they feed the turkey
don't know ma'am
5
heard that because turkeys are fatty birds, mercury gets stuck in their fat
My daughter-in-law, she ate turkey and then she had a miscarriage
haven't heard about that
But may not be informed enough to comment
Well, you're not a doctor, so you shouldn't comment
You are correct,  am not a doctor
- Ira and Chuck are preparing trays of food
You should come see me do stand-up tonight at the Comedy and Magic Club
can't go through that again, man, that was painful
That was five months ago
've gotten a lot better
They pay you yet
Nah, not there
just hang out and hope somebody doesn't show
Wow, is there anyway for you to
be lower in show business
don't know if you could even say you're in show business
Why don't you just fucking settle down and enjoy this gig
This is a sweet situation
The money's good, you've got health insurance
6
Dude,  know you like it here but if  have to work here another year would kill myself
Really
In that case, when we bury you does it have to be in some kind of Jew cemetery
Next to Al Jolson or some shit
Just come
need the support
No way
'm funnier than you
And 'm not even that funny
would go if  was paying to see me
'll pay your cover charge
Okay, well you better be good, because 'm bringing a date
Laughter's the ultimate lubricant
- An Otis Redding song is playing as George walks around his house in a daze, not sure how to process this
He doesn't call anybody
There's nobody in sight
We see images of him thinking about the unthinkable and the life he's lead
He sits in his office, surrounded by photos of himself at difference ages
It builds to a sequence of him going through stacks of old photos and watching videos of himself, reviewing his life, trying to make sense of what it all meant
We see clips of his good movies and his last bad movie
On the wall is a poster of a buddy film which shows him and another famous comedian
- -- home video of George at college
George is hanging out with his friends
They are acting goofy, having the time of their lives
George looks very young, skinny, and carefree
Life has never been better
They play a ridiculous drinking game and laugh uproariously
7
- We see a very young George performing stand- up on Late Night with David Letterman
He's so young and naive, he seems like a completely different person
George watching silently
He has no idea what to make of this journey of his
'  - Ira sits with one of his roommates, , who is also an aspiring comedian
They sit across from each other, kicking around joke ideas they have, trying to write new ones
We see an entire pitch session play out
Ira's joke pitches are all over the place
He clearly hasn't figured out what his stage persona is yet
was thinking about doing something about how 'm not good looking and 'm not bad looking
'm just good looking enough that if  had a good personality, it could put me over the top
If that was the case
Yeah, something about how the uglier you are, the better the personality you need
And the hotter you are, the stupider you can be
had a joke once about how you never see incredibly hot, blonde, homeless women
Because someone will always take care of that kind of woman
That woman could be the dumbest person on earth and she will survive in this world
Maybe something like
you can be hot and stupid and survive in the world
And you can be smart and ugly and survive in the world
The people who have trouble are the stupid, ugly people
8
That could work
Let me keep that one, because thought of most of it
That's not cool
came up with the concept
What do you got
Let's work on what you have
've got nothing in the notebook
got drunk last night
But  need material, because  just got spots at the Improv
Budd saw me and approved me
'm in
How could they make you a regular
got turned down twice
Sorry, man
They're only going to let in one chubby, caustic Jew, so think you're fucked
Their other roommate, , walks in, waves a check at them
Hey, dudes
You see this check that  got from my  show for 25,000 an episode
There was another one of these on the kitchen counter
Did you see it
No we didn't see it
Just don't leave those things laying around
wouldn't leave it around if they didn't give me so many
They give it to me every episode
Don't throw it in our face that you're on a shitty show
9
wouldn't, if it was a shitty show and not what Time magazine called "insightful and delightful
" thought you were moving out
decided  like it here
Living with you guys keeps me grounded don't want to be the guy living in the house on the hill
Even though could afford it
Hey,  saw that girl comic you like who lives upstairs
invited her in
She's here
She's in our apartment
've never even talked to her
just gave her quarters at the washing machine
You were right, she is pretty mousy and sexy
You gotta talk to her
need time
have a three-month plan
'll give you ten days for your three-month plan, then  am going to fuck her
You can't just leave that laying around
Starting right now
- Mark is talking to , an alternative-feeling, dark-haired girl in her early twenties
His television show is on the The thing about working on a sitcom is it's 22 weeks a year, so  can do stand-up the rest of the year
() 10
(') But now people want to see me because they see me on a  show, so  am kind of a draw
Have you seen the show
don't own a
Well  think you can download it to an iPod
Ira walks in
(') Hey Ira, this is Daisy
how's it going
Nice to meet you
think  gave you quarters once
Ira walks over to the kitchen area, takes out a paper cup
He pours some orange juice without looking and the paper cup falls over and spills all over the counter
Mark looks horrified
(') (nervously joking) Don't worry, 'll just lick it off the counter
Nobody laughs
Ira starts wiping up the  with a rag
- Leo is on stage, performing his act, doing well
Ira watching, both amused and jealous and the  walks over to him
Schneider didn't show up so, you can do ten minutes after Leo
Don't go long because  have to load pigeons into my suit
have to let them out or they'll die
'm not fucking around
() 11
(') So when you get the light, don't go long
You've got one minute
Leo on stage, doing a few more jokes walks over to Ira
Hey man
George Simmons just got here, he wants to go up
You're bumped
We'll put you on after George
Well how long is he going to do
don't know
Last night he did five minutes
Last week he did an hour
fie'il do what he wants to do
Well what about the magician
He just loaded his pigeons
He said have to get off in ten minutes
'll have him unload the pigeons
Just be ready
Leo finishes his set to huge applause then comes off stage
That was good, right
Some of the new stuff worked
just got bumped by George Simmons
Are you serious
Shit - 've got a spot at the Improv,  cant hang out, damn
lot of times you hear about going to a comedy club and someone exciting shows up
won't lie to you, that usually never happens
But tonight it is happening
() 12
(') Ladies and gentleman, you know him from [movie credits to go here] George Simmons
George walks on stage
The place goes crazy
He does some of his normal routine and the audience laughs and is very appreciative
As George continues his act, it starts getting darker and darker until he is talking about death and the lack of meaning in it all
Ah life
What does it mean
sometimes life makes perfect sense
And then you `come'
He's killing the crowd
Jesus, can't follow this shit
After completely losing the crowd, and some minor confrontations with audience members, he exits the stage
Life isn't all about laughs
Crazy shit happens
You've got to be nice to each other
You never know what's going to happen
Ira passes George as he heads onto the stage
(') Sorry  sucked it up out there
At least they are well rested for you
Ira, takes the stage
He starts trying to do his act, but he is unsure of himself and unable to figure out how to take the weird energy of the room and spin it to his advantage
He basically bombs
We reveal Chuck and his date watching, looking miserable
'm not good looking
'm not bad looking
'm just in the middle
And if  had a personality that was Jut good enough, it would put me over the edge
The joke fails
We reveal George also watching him bomb, amused by his struggle
He sees something he likes in Ira
13
Ira walks to his car
In the spot next to him is an enormous Suburban  parked in a spot meant for compact cars
It is so close to Ira's car that it isn't possible to open the door
He hears some banging and odd wails from in the car
Ira knocks on the window
We see that George is sitting in his car in a world of pain
He's clearly been crying
The knock startles him
He turns to Ira
Sorry, man
didn't mean to disturb you
just can't open my door
There's no room
Oh 'm sorry
Let me pull out
George pulls the car back ten feet
(') (calling to Ira) Hey man, you had some funny shit tonight
Thanks
Man, that audience hated you
They really did not like you
They liked your buddy, who looked exactly like you but was funnier
Man, that's going to haunt you
You're going to wake up in six months and think about this night
Well, 'll probably bomb worse tomorrow and forget about this one
'm just fucking with you
You had some funny jokes in there
Good writing
Well, obviously, 'm a
you know
grew up on your shit, man
George just stares at him
14
Alright, pal
Don't worry
Only two hundred people saw that tonight
'll see you later
George pulls out, turns the car around, and as he passes by Ira, he steers his car as if he's going to run him down, and starts screaming
(') You're gonna die
'm gonna kill you
Then he smiles at Ira and drives off
Ira smiles
This is the greatest thing that's ever happened to him
'  - : We see a comedy short made by Leo
It's very funny
Holy shit, you got seven hundred thousand hits in four days
They put it on the main page at YouTube and it exploded
Which would be awesome if someone would pay me
The phone rings
Hello
(
0
) Hey, is this Ira
Yeah
Who is this
It's George
Oh my gosh
Hey, how is it going
15
thought you and Leo were pretty funny last night and  have to do this corporate gig for Apple computers in a couple of days and thought you guys could write me some jokes
Definitely
What kind of jokes
Leo passes by in the background
We see Ira decide not to include him in this job offer
don't know, about computers and shit
could mainly do my act but they like it if you talk about them a little
No problem
Where do you want me to send em
What is your email
will send you my fax and email and all that
It's a
irasexiraAAgmail
com
(long silence) almost just changed my mind
You got to change that
Ok
Today
Seriously
Ok
Later
Ira hangs up and turns to his friends
That was George Simmons
He wants me to write jokes for him
Holy shit
That is awesome
You are so lucky
16
Are you gonna get to meet him
don't know, but he is gonna send me his email address
We are gonna have his email address
have to send him the link to my short
Easy
Let me get in there a little more
: '  - Ira is writing jokes
The camera follows the letters being typed on the computer screen as he types
"Always erase your web history
had a girlfriend hit history and see eleven hundred porn sites that  visited in an hour
" Jonah sticks his head in
got one, but you have to tell him its mine
The best thing about Leopard is it lets you watch a porno, write a porno, shoot a porno, and order a porno all at the same time
And you guys made that possible
We see   of him typing and printing
He is writing an enormous amount of jokes
Way more than George will ever need
Writing, typing, re-writing in pen, then re- typing, etc
Ira hesitates, then hits send
' Ira is asleep
The clock says noon
The phone rings
He answers it, groggy
17
There's some funny shit in here
Not a bad ratio of good jokes to shit
Thanks man
just want to give you a lot of choices
Too many choices
don't like reading that much
need like ten good jokes
'm a little mad you made me read that many to get to ten
But thanks for doing it
Oh, it was fun to try to write in your voice
spent the whole night pretending  was you
So you cried yourself to sleep
() So you whacked off three times last night
Don't worry, 'll get you some money
Is five hundred good
Yeah
That'll work
'm leaving at four tomorrow to go to the gig
You want to come check it out, see if your shit works
' - on their curtains, as they wait for George to pull up
Can we go outside and meet him
No you can't
Because then we look like fans
Maybe he's seen my show
18
He doesn't watch your show
You're show is for eight-year-olds
It's a family show, he doesn't watch that shit
'll just go outside and pretend '-,n washing my car
The Limo pulls up outside
(') Holy shit
feel like my little girl is going to the prom
/
- The door opens, Ira gets in
How you doing, you ready for this
Yeah, this'll be fun
think 'm going to have you go on before me to warn them up
You don't have to do that
What if bomb
Hey, if you bomb, they'll just be more excited to see me
They'll be so glad your not on stage any more
Then if you do well, they'll be ready for me
Either way, you're helpful
/   - The limo pulls up to a private jet
Ira is shocked
moment later they're picking up speed to take off
George seems really relaxed
Nothing registers that the jet is going faster and faster and taking off
19
As they're having a conversation, Ira seems really freaked out
Ira pretends he isn't
like this joke about watching porn and making porn all at the same time
That was a good one
(turning white from ) Oh good
Yeah,  thought you'd like that one
was really happy with that one
You want something to eat
had them bring Chinese on the plane
Ira's eyes widen
He likes this way of life
- from Apple is walking George and Ira into the room
It's a giant room that holds a thousand people at banquet tables
- Sting is finishing up a set
This is a huge corporate event
Okay, what do you want them to say when he introduces you
Do you have any credits he should mention
(long beat) Uh
credits
don't really have any credits
Maybe you could just say 've been working on Apples for so long, my first one weighed more than  did
Nobody laughs
And just say he's a friend of mine, and  think he's funny
20
- Ira's on stage doing his act
He tells two jokes that don't do very well
And then he panics and does the joke about jerking off and shooting a movie all at the same time
George, shaking his head, amused that he panicked and did one of the jokes he sold to him
the wings of the stage
Ira's walking off stage
What the fuck is that
You did three of the jokes that you wrote for me
panicked
They just wanted jokes about computers
That's why  hired you, to write jokes about computers
Ira takes out the long list of jokes he's written
But there's a lot more
The first three on this page
You didn't think they would work, but  think they will
You should just try them
They better kill, 'm getting paid a hundred thousand dollars for this
Are you serious
on stage
Ladies and gentleman, George Simmons
George does a few Apple jokes that do kill, and then he segues into his normal act
When he wants to be, he is a great performer
21
- George and Ira sit on the plane, on the way back
We'll be on the ground in a half hour
Want to go to a bar
Do something fun
Sure
like fun
Here's a grand for the jokes and the gig
Even though you should be paying me after that
Ira's eyes widen
(') Good job
That's the most money 've ever made doing anything in comedy
Then this is an exciting moment
Well,  didn't make a hundred grand like you
feel nothing
remember when a grand was the most exciting thing in the world
'd go to Red Lobster and go nuts
Now it's just numbers in a bank account
Enjoy tonight
You made a thousand bucks
- George and Ira enter
People are very excited to see George
They give him a nice table
-- George and Ira talk to two women,  and
They both seem really into George
Ira feels kind of left out
22
-- George focuses on Mandy, flirting and preparing her to go home with him
-- The other girl is now talking to a very uncomfortable Ira
She is not into it
Hey, let's all go back to my house
Great
() Yeah, that sounds like a
nice idea
Music is playing
Everybody is drinking
Mandy is doing some weird sort of sexy dance for George
This house is so big
It's bigger than the college  went to
Oh there's a whole other wing that you wouldn't even know existed unless you went through this door
want to see,  want to see
George and Mandy disappear
Ira and Dawn are left alone
You are very pretty
have a boyfriend
Nothing is going to happen
didn't say anything was going to happen
just said you were pretty
How do you even know wanted something to happen
hope she doesn't take a long time
23
'  - George is having sex with Mandy
can't believe 'm having sex with Davey
He can't believe he's having sex with you
-- Ira and Dawn are watching one of George's films
Neither looks very happy or comfortable
George enters
Hey, Mandy thought you left, so she left
Really
Sorry, that kind of stuff happens when you have a big house
Oh, well then  guess  better get going
You don't have to go
'm just saying that she left
think she left her purse in the other wing
Come with me, let's go get it
Ira watches this, astonished
('  ) Did Ira tell you  have a room with all the classic pinball machines and video games
That sounds awesome
Yeah,  got Galaga
Let's go check it out
24
George looks over his shoulder at Ira, as if to say, " man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
" (') (to Ira) Hey don't go, 'll be back in a second
- Ira is now watching the end of the movie by himself
George sticks his head in
That girl left
You want to talk to me while  try to go to sleep
Ira doesn't know what to make of this
guess so
- George is in bed under the covers, comfortably laying on his pillow
Ira sits in an easy chair located right next to the bed
Did you have sex with both of those girls
'm afraid  did
'm sorry
It was just so clear that you were not going to get it done
figured you wouldn't mind
That is crazy
That is super crazy
It was great
It was crazy great
How can that even happen
guess understand the first one, but why would the second one do it
You probably stink of the first girl
25
Well, we took a steam shower together
What
she had never seen a steam shower before,  told her she should enjoy it
She wouldn't fool around with me because she said she had a boyfriend
She told me that too, but she says was on her and her boyfriend's list of people she was allowed to screw
You'd be surprised how many women have me on that list
should get going
Just talk to me before  fall asleep
'm weird
don't like being alone
You should crash in one of the rooms
You're too drunk to drive home
won't try to fuck you,  just fucked two women and 'm kind of done
may have to whack it in your guest room
Whack away,  don't give a shit
() Hey, you were funny tonight could see how you could get good
Thanks
That was fun
It was rare that  get to play to more than twenty-five people
've never played for a thousand
() 26
(') it, s kind of easier, because even if two hundred like me, it sounds like a lot
do feel bad for you, because no matter how hard you try, you'll never be as funny as me
Why would you say that
Did your dad crack you on the head when you were a kid
No
That's why
My dad always seemed annoyed with me
He'd always crack me on the head
You would not see it coming
spent my whole childhood trying to make my dad laugh so he wouldn't smack me
But he was an awesome guy
He was the coolest
He just got annoyed with me
Do you like your parents
They can't be that bad, because you're not that funny
They're bananas
And always broke
They got divorced ten years ago, but they both act like it just happened last week
They hate each other
They always put me in the middle of it
always wanted them to say, "We don't want you to suffer through this, so we're just going to handle it ourselves
" They never would do it
They would always make me feel their pain all the time
would never do that for my kids
Because it's like they
_`
re kids
And no matter how many times  tell them to leave me out of it, they never do
Ira notices that George is very close to falling asleep
(') 'll let you crash
27
No, keep going
It's interesting
Tell me about your day job
Alright
So
(knows he's a sleeping pill at this point) work at a supermarket at the deli counter
hate it, but the money's actually pretty good
Better than you'd think
But 'd rather do comedy full-time if could
The camera pulls back as Ira continues to talk, and we begin to  George snoring, as Ira continues to talk anyway
'  - George walks into the guest room, where Ira is sleeping
Hey man, you want to make me breakfast
okay
Do you know how to cook anything
Eggs
Okay, let's have some eggs
While Ira is cooking, George takes a lot of pills
What are you doing, man
Are those vitamins
No
Medicine
'm sick
What do you got
28
've got some crazy blood disease
They think 'm going to die in six months to a year
Some weird thing, almost nobody has it
All these are experimental
Are you fucking with me
That's not funny, man
No, 'm telling you the truth
never heard that before
That would be a big deal
haven't told anybody yet don't think 'm going to
You're not going to tell anybody
You told me
Well it's easier with you because don't know you
don't feel weird around you
don't want to be treated like a guy who's going to die
don't know, man
don't think you want to go through this alone
think you've got to tell people
Your family
Your friends
Actually, the reason why  only told you is  need you to do me a favor
What
Anything, man
can't imagine suffering through the final stages of this
So was going to ask you if you would be willing
to euthanize me
29
What does that mean
Kill me
figured if  found someone that nobody knew that was a stranger, they could get away with it, and  wouldn't have to suffer
got a gun that is untraceable
And a silencer
And  thought maybe tonight,  would take a bunch of sleeping pills, and when  slept you would put a bullet in my head
can't do that
'll give you fifty thousand dollars in cash
You'd be doing me a favor
It would be the kindest thing you could ever do for somebody
Fifty thousand dollars
Can  at least take a little time to think about it
Holy shit, you would do it
You were literally thinking about doing it
You're an asshole
'm an asshole, you were about to kill me
For fifty grand
That's not even a lot of money
just got nervous so  was delaying saying no
You basically just told me that you were willing to be a murderer
While you're cooking me eggs
30
That's not cool, man
You told me you're going to die and you want me to euthanize you
almost had a heart attack
Well,  actually am sick
And 'm not going to survive
Don't do this
My friends do this all the time
They trick me, and then they trick me again
'm very gullible
Don't do it
'm not putting you on, man
Just don't tell anyone
mean that don't want people to know about this
don't want to feel weird
Ira nods okay
Are you religious
Does that give you any comfort
Do you really think 'm going to sit here and have a theological conversation with you
No
Maybe later, Father Mulcahy
- The three friends - Mark, Ira, Leo - smoke pot and have what they think is a deep conversation
That's so sad
If it was me,  would tell everyone
Then everyone would kiss my ass
And take care of me
Tell me how much they love me
() 31
(`) Wipe my ass when  had to go to the bathroom
They'd be crying and sad, and that would make me feel really good
He doesn't want to be that guy
He picked up two girls at a bar
Then he had sex with his
And then he came out and had sex with mine
In front of you
No
So being terminally ill makes you a cock-blacker
No, what 'm saying is
He's so lost right now that he's hiding from the world
And he's trying to distract himself by doing stand-up and having sex with a lot of women
And he doesn't want anyone to know but me
Why you
Because he doesn't know me
So he doesn't give a shit
That's kind of insulting
No,  think we had kind of an instant connection
The other roommate, , walks by
You fucked him
Shut up, Jay
Jay keeps walking
32
(') feel like he's crying out for help, and  can help him
He's made us so happy in our lives, this is our chance to do something from him during this time
There's a lot of wisdom we can take from this
What he's going through
We can apply it to our lives
Like how to bang two chicks in the same night, even though you have a terminal disease
No, what is life all about
What is important
How should we decide to live this precious life
that Mark is crying
Don't talk about this shit when we're high
It really freaks me out and it makes me sad and it scares me
don't want to talk about this shit
That's why we should talk about it
You can't run from it, man
This could make us into better people
This is an opportunity
don't want to talk about this shit until 'm 80
'm 24 years old
Well 'm going to fucking learn something
Mark cries even more
When my grandfather died, we were in a room with no windows
And they said he was dead
And there was a candle
And it started flickering like he was blowing it out
But there were no windows
() 33 (') We all thought that was him going to heaven
You have to go through fire to get to heaven
That wasn't him going to heaven, that was him going to hell
Fuck you guys
was trying to open up
'll never do it again
You're just being mean because 'm making twenty-five thousand dollars an episode
'   - George is bored, playing guitar
He picks up the phone, dials
: ' Ira answers the phone
Hello
Hey
You want to see if we can get on-stage somewhere
Sure
- See quick moments of Ira on stage at the Improv doing a set
Then George does a set, tears down the house
' George and a few of his friends are playing a famous rock song for fun
But they are very good
The music continues through the following sequence
34
- George and Ira are eating with several famous comedians, shooting the shit, having a good time
-- George and Ira are waiting at the parking valet
The car pulls up
As they get in: was thinking about it
could throw you some money every week for coming up with new jokes for me
Maybe you can organize them in the computer, keep track of what 'm doing
Absolutely
What do you want to pay me
They close the doors, drive off
'll throw you $1500 a week
Okay, that could work
We can tell that this amount of money could change Ira's life
' George and Ira are writing jokes
Ira keeps pitching premises/rough joke ideas that George instantly makes ten times better off the top of his head
(We shoot this process for real with multiple cameras and try to catch lightning in a bottle
) was thinking maybe you should do some material about what you're going through, being sick
There could be something really powerful, and it would mean a lot to people, that you would share that with them
35
'm just doing stand-up to have fun, forget about it on stage
There's nothing funny about that
It could be classic stuff
For the ages
Fuck classic stuff
Idon't give a shit what people think of my shit when 'm dead
Why don't you wait till you're about to die and then you do a bit about it
'll bet you're about-to-die shit will be funnier than my about-to-die shit
George and Ira are doing sets again
'  - George is making a phoney phone call on a speaker phone
Ira listens
(Grandmother voice) ordered your Roast Beef
And normally it's delicious
But this time  paid a price
'm very sorry ma'am
What if you come in and  give you a free sandwich
(Grandmother voice) Well that's very nice of you
But have one question for you
Can get two sandwiches
George motions for Ira to do something
Grandma
Get off the fucking phone
Don't run up my fucking bill
36
Ira starts slapping his hands together
George screams in pain
Ma'am
Are you okay
(Grandmother voice) This is a family matter
He can hit me if he wants
He's my grandson, and  love him
Now may give you my name, so you have it on file so  can get my free sandwich
------------ -----------
Did you get that
Can you say it back to me
'  - Ira enters
George
George
He walks through the house, finds George in bed
For the first time he seems sick
(') Are you all right
No,  had a bad night last night
was sweating though the sheets, couldn't stop
So  got up, watched half of a season of The Wire and then  slept till
what time is it now
It's three in the afternoon
wanted to get up and do something
But  don't think have it in me
may just go back to bed
Well do you need anything
37
Yeah,  need all sorts of things
But nothing you can get me
You should go up anyway
You were in a groove the other night, you don't want to get rusty
can't anyway
'm doing the late shift at the deli counter
Really
How long you gonna keep that job for
'm paying you good money
What if someone you perform in front of goes into Ralph's and sees you cutting turkey
know,  just want to be safe, make sure  can pay my bills don't like to be nervous about that shit
wasn't like you
had a different theory
You've got to spend money to make money
Nothing makes you work harder than being in debt
Maybe we should go buy a Corvette
That'll make you try to be funnier
' so how much notice are you giving me
Notice
'm not giving you any notice
'm just quitting
You're supposed to give notice
That's what people do
Why would  give you notice
'm not trying to stay in Ralph's good graces
'm not trying to preserve my good standing at Ralph's
() 38
(') 'm just quitting
You don't quit and then keep working for two weeks
Well  don't have enough people to cover all your shifts, now  gotta cover them
wish  could help you, but 'll kill myself if  keep working here
It's not what  want to do
Maybe Gail can cover my shifts
Gail can't work weekends, and my kid's birthday is this weekend
What am  supposed to do
don't know
Get someone to cover from a different Ralph's
There are thousands of them in Southern California
No one else can scoop macaroni into a bowl
'm not the linchpin that keeps Ralph's from falling into chaos
You're an asshole
You always thought you were slumming it here
Go tell your tucking fart jokes
, Get the fuck out of here before kick the shit out of you
You know what
'm glad you said that, because  was about to tell you  could work this weekend
What's your problem
didn't say anything bad about you,  just said didn't want to work for Ralph's anymore
Chuck takes a step to Ira like he's going to hit him
Ira steps back a few feet
(') 'll tell Dave
'll tell Dave tried to do this politely
The thanks  get
39
Ira walks out the store
As he walks out, he turns to a lady (in her 40s) at the register
(') See you, Phyllis
You're nice
- Ira sees Daisy walking out as he's walking into the apartment complex
He takes a deep breath, then: Hey, Daisy
Hey -- Ira
(she doesn't) know
was gonna try to hunt down tickets to see Wilco at the Greek Theatre
You want to come
Are you into them at all
would love to come
That would be amazing
Okay
'll call you with the details
Hopefully 'll be able to get seats which will not require high-powered binoculars
don't care where the seats are
just like to close my eyes and listen to the music at concerts, Perfect
Then  can play you their live album in my car and trick you into thinking we have front row seats
(laughing uncomfortably) That won't work
() 40
(') That wasn't funny at all
'm gonna leave while 'm ahead right now
She smiles
He walks away
' Ira walks into George's house
George
Ira walks into George's bedroom
He hears something, pokes his head in
In the dark, he can barely see George making phoney calls by himself
Ira listens for awhile, not sure what to make of this
George doesn't see him
(speaking like an old ) was robbed
One second you're walking down the street with your Visa card, having a grand old time, and then you've got a fucking gun in your mouth
What's the number of the card, Ma'am
don't know
The thief has the card, why don't you ask the thief the number of the card
George hangs up the phone
He starts dialing
(') (as a Texan) Ah yes,  came into your comedy club tonight and  was very offended by the performer
did not pay good money to have the so- called "comedian" shake my wife's hand, then smell it and say, "Did you have fish for dinner
" That is not my idea of entertainment
Ira leaves the room, feeling like he's intruded on a private moment
41
George and Ira are eating
was thinking you need to tell someone about your situation
your condition
No, no
IAaA don't want to do that
feel like maybe you're holding everything in and  can understand why you don't want to deal with it because why would anyone want to deal with it
But  bet you have a lot of unfinished business with your friends
Wouldn't it make you feel a lot better to get your affairs in order
What do people do at this moment Don't they have to do stuff
don't want to do anything just want to be in the moment and live every day the best  can
As soon as  confront it with everybody, everything's changed and can't get back
Everything has changed
At some point you're going to get really sick and you need your friends and family around you
'm sure there's a lot of business, estate issues,  don't know
Maybe you'll feel better than if you just deal with everything
Where are your parents
P4y parents would drop dead if told them what was happening
They're in their 80s
They don't have to go through this
'll make sure they find out at the last possible second
42
Friends
don't think  do
thought did
got a lot of people  know, shoot the shit with, fuck around with
But  realized when this happened 'm not close to anyone
had no one to call
My friendships are Hollywood friendships
When  was lying in bed  couldn't think of one person wanted to share this with
Maybe it's me, maybe  never got close to anybody
think if you talk to people you'd find out a lot of people care about you
You're kind of old already, mean, compared to me
'm sure you touched a lot of people's lives
You can't spend the rest of your days making phoney phone calls alone in your room
The only reason  did that was because  couldn't sleep
And had no one to call
Well maybe that's the problem
Maybe if you told more people you'd have more people to call
You can't just talk to me about it, don't know what the fuck 'm talking about
You're the first person 've known who's sick
'm not good at it
(eyes beginning to well ) You've given me diarrhea, 'm nervous about you and 'm in over my head
(his eyes begin to well ) Don't cry in front of me, man can't start that
43
'm sorry
Seriously
can't
can't have you do that
George really begins to cry
(') Please don't do that
(tears streaming down his ) won't do it,  promise, man
Ira wipes the tears from his face
New tears immediately come out
(') That was first and last time
'm not even crying anymore
() You're still crying
(tears coming down) don't think  am
think 'm not anymore
'm not sure what you're talking about
Okay, as long as we got that straight
George takes a napkin and puts it over his face
'm sorry, George
really don't know what to do,  don't know how to help you
(his face still in the ) No, you're right
really should tell some people
It just sucks, man
It just sucks
And they're going to feel so bad,  don't even want to look at them and tell them
() 44
(') 'd rather drop dead
of a heart attack and have someone else make the calls
have to make those calls
This is a nightmare
This is a total nightmare
Do you want me to call them, and tell them what's going on
Yeah
Fuck
was hoping you were gonna say no
' Ira is on the phone
There is a paper with a bunch of numbers in front of him
(into the phone) Hi, this is Ira, 'm a friend of George's
He asked me to call you
His roommates are making a commotion outside
Ira covers the receiver
(') Will you guys shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up
Ira slam the door
(') (into phone) 'm sorry
have some news about George
George sits with
They are all laughing and telling old sex stories from george's younger days
Ira sits with them and listens and laughs along
45
So  left the phone off the hook so he could hear me doing it
#1 That's very gay
#2 No, it was a buddy thing
It was very heterosexual
Admit it, you were masturbating
#2 Of course  was whacking it
What else am  gonna do, not whack it
And  kept making her talk and say crazy shit just to make him laugh
#2 think at one point you said, "Say my hog is the biggest you've ever seen
" And then there is this long pause
#3 That's a bad sign
If it was big at all she wouldn't have paused
#1 Remember you used to have that joke about how you used to only date midgets because your dick looked bigger in their little hands
They all laugh
#2 Yeah, you used to get all the girls, man
Suddenly the air is out of the room, and it is awkward and sad
George is talking to an - and his
46
- And  feel horrible about it, but the truth is,  was having some issues with gambling, and you were doing so well-and so  took a million dollar check you got in from the studio and  used it to clear up some debts
And  did it with the intention of paying you right back before you noticed
But you never noticed, and  just never got around to paying you back
Allen Covert yells at George for abandoning him
You fucking blew us off
You cocksucker
George is talking to his sister,
You have to tell mom and dad
will tell them, but right at the end
don't want them to go through all this
can't put them through this
wish  wasn't so mad at you want to be there for you, but  am so mad at you
wish  was a better brother
You weren't even a brother
You just left when  was a little kid
You left me there all alone, and you never treated me like a sister again
47
You live so far away
visited you in Kansas a few years ago
That was six years ago, and you were only there because you had a concert
My five-year-old has never even met you
George does not know what to say
(') And  wanted to bring her, but then thought she would just fall in love with you and get attached, and then what
didn't want to do that to her
George and Ira talk in the kitchen while making beverages
Thanks a lot, pal
This is everything  didn't want to happen
It's like being at my own funeral
Afterwards you'll be happy you did it
No,  won't
George talks to a  who rambles on and on talking about his own problems, ignoring George's
It is such a tucked up situation
Life is fucked
It makes no sense
Well,  really appreciate you coming by
This is why  can't be close with people
What is the point
48
Exactly
Well,  really need to rest
The worst part is at night, when the  gets turned off, and it is quiet
It was so good to see you
George stands up and exits the room
Ira walks over
think George is going to take a nap now
Oh, okay
different  is talking about their own health issues
He goes on and on about his surgeries and treatments
George doesn't say a word
George is talking to
You're about to merge with the eternal
We're all going to die
No one gets out of here alive, right
George nods
(') You lived five lives, fucker
You're 200 years old in my book
The fun you've had, the money, the adventures, the women you've known
Who wouldn't want to change places with you right new
guess so, but
49
You know what
There is no tomorrow, no yesterday
Only right now, and it's fucking beautiful
() You need to shut the fuck up right now
Have you been browsing the self-help section at Barnes and Noble
Is this what you say in between songs these days
'm going to go right now and delete all your songs off my iPod
'm sorry
didn't know what to say
just got nervous
' Ira is talking George to sleep
He's gotten good at it
Warren Zevon's "Don't Let Us Get Sick" plays in the background
This is awful
Awful
hate you for having me do this
You have to, you have no choice
You're doing good
And you're almost done, don't worry
Well what are we going to do when it's over, when we're done tomorrow
Because then 'm not talking to anyone
was thinking we should go skiing somewhere
You're still physically doing well, and that's not going to last forever
You should do something active
Go to Colorado, or Tahoe, or something
Or do something crazy
Go to Switzerland, or Sweden, or wherever they have mountains
() 50
(') don't know,  don't even ski, but you do
Maybe you should do something like that
Ira notices George is falling asleep, so he talks more quietly
He's gotten good at this
(') If it's too hard, we can just ski for an hour or two a day, and then get drunk at the bar
You can hit on hot ski instructors, and then can masturbate in the room thinking about you fucking hot ski instructors
He thinks George is asleep, so he walks out as he speaks
(') Whatever
It'll be fun to be in the mountain air, fun to look at the mountains
Maybe you shouldn't even be here
We can hang out there as long as you want,  got nothing to do
Ira closes the door
- George is talking to , a very pretty woman in her late thirties
Laura is showing George a photo of her two daughters
Thanks for coming down
You didn't have to do that, i appreciate it
wanted to,  wanted to see you
'm so sorry
'm sorry for everything  did to you
You don't have to be sorry, that was like 12 years ago
Everything worked out for the best
We see this hurts George
51
screwed everything up
could have been married to you now
Don't do this
We could've had a family
don't have a family, 'm all alone here
(tearing up) 'm so sorry
'm so sorry for what's happening to you
You know, maybe  deserve it screwed up the only good thing that ever happened in my life cheated on you
For no reason at all
Just young and stupid
And selfish
'm sorry
Maybe  over reacted
didn't have to leave you
Yes you did
: Ira sneaking a peak from the kitchen as he makes coffee
And the funny thing is
my husband, he is on the road a lot for business
He did the same thing last year
Did you leave him
No
have kids now
See, that was my mistake
should have had some kids with you before cheated
she laughs
52
You were the one and only magic relationship in
my life
She starts to cry
He does too
They embrace
Me too
They cry, forehead to forehead
There's never been anything like you before or since
love Chris, but it's not the same
It's fine, maybe it isn't even fine, but we had something special
'm so sorry
really loved you
And  do love you
love you too George
wish there was something  could do
Don't set me up for jokes like that
You're ruining the moment
She smiles
They hug
'  - Ira comes home, deep in the evening
He's eating some food
Daisy walks out of Mark's bedroom, dressed in Mark's long- sleeve t-shirt
She's clearly just had sex
Hey
How's it going
Good
Mark walks out in a bathrobe
Oh, 'm sorry
thought you were sleeping at your boyfriend's again tonight
53
guess it's been more than ten days
It's been 21 days
gave you an extra 11
What are you guys talking about
Don't worry about it, it doesn't matter,  don't give a shit
Leo walks in the front door
just fucking killed at the Improv
Bud Freidman fucking loves me
Leo realizes he's walked into the middle of an awkward moment
('  ) (-) They said they're gonna start giving me good spots on the weekends
've been getting good weekend spots
Well, that's because they think if they book you, George will show up
What's with you guys
You both want to fuck my mother too
What more do you want to do to me tonight
Ira walks away
really did kill
(a beat) Did you guys just bone, or something
() 54
(') 'm getting a little vibe here
It's getting me excited
- Ira and Daisy are having a heated conversation outside
So now you're with Mark
You're his girl
just went out with him one night
You got a lot accomplished in one night
How did this happen
He invited me to a taping of his show and we hit it off
Must have been a great episode should get a job on a shitty show so  can use it as foreplay
What are you talking about
Don't treat me like that
am not treating you like anything
Do what you want don't give a shit
'll go to Wilco alone
What planet are you from
The one where everyone is perfect like you, you judgemental fuck
How could you do that
thought we were going out on a date
We are going on a date
didn't plan it
Am  not allowed to do stuff because we're going out on a date
What the fuck's the matter with you
55
bought tickets to Wilco and worked all week to get a reservation at a place that doesn't normally let people like me eat there
just didn't see this coming
Yes, you're right
You can do anything you want
'm glad this fucking happened, before wasted the night with you didn't think you were that kind of person
That you would sleep with a guy like that
He's your roommate
You don't like him
No,  think he's a pussyhound
Well,  didn't know that
Thanks for the info
wasn't trying to hurt you
It just happened
You got excited because he's the star of the show
You literally star-fucked
Yes, you're right
'm awful
() Give me a break
don't even know you
- Ira goes into the house
Mark is there
told you  was going to give you 10 days
That was three weeks ago
thought you were joking
didn't know she actually mattered to you
We talk about girls we want to fuck all the time
56
just bought these two Wilco tickets
Wanna go
would, but 'm going with Tobey Maguire
He wants me to play his younger brother in some movie
- George and Ira are skiing
There is no music, no noise
It is very peaceful
George stops in a spot where he is surrounded in all directions by gorgeous, majestic mountains
He looks around, taking it all in
- George and Ira are watching videotapes of George doing stand- up when he was much younger
He's really, really funny
And very skinny, with a much more pronounced New York accent
You know,  never got married never had kids
didn't get to do a lot of things  thought  would do
But  was pretty fucking funny, right
Come on, are you kidding me
We all want to be you
Most of my comic friends are just doing a bad impression of you
People love your shit
Well,  made a lot of people laugh
guess that's something
It's a lot
Yeah
guess so
They watch some more and we see a really happy, young George getting big laughs with something really silly
(') Look at that crazy motherfucker
57
George and Ira start watching the act and laughing along, like any audience member
- George is singing a happy song with a bunch of musician friends, like a Lou Reed/Velvet Underground (or Ramones/New York Dolls/Clash/Warren Zevon/Paul McCartney) song
This music plays over the following montage
'  - George walks around his grounds, slowly
And one gets the sense he's never looked around and seen where he lives before
He likes it
- George performs at the Improv
We see him gesture to a woman that she can come up on stage and she hugs him
The crowd erupts
She runs back to her seat
George continues with his act
- George and Ira hike up a hill
never understood why people hiked before
think  get it now
() don't
- George and Ira have an uncomfortable dinner with George's angry sister, Lisa
-- George is in bed, sleeping
Ira starts sneaking out
George wakes up, calls Ira back to keep talking to him
58
- George is walking around his yard at night
He's clearly never walked the grounds at night
He seems at peace
'   - Lisa and her husband are now over, and George is talking to them and playing with her two-year-old boy
' George is sitting with his parents
It is clear he recently told them about his situation, and although there is sadness in the air, they look happy to be close for the first time in a long time
George says something that makes his  laugh
' Ira is asleep on the couch
George walks over with a bowl of ice cream
He whacks Ira a few times trying to wake him up, but Ira keeps snoring
George sits down next to the sleeping Ira and watches  while eating his ice cream
- George and Ira play basketball
Ira is awful
- Ira is making breakfast
George is all dressed for the day
What are you doing
'm feeling good, so 'm going to the doctor
You're not feeling good
No, 'm feeling good
It's kind of weirding me out
() 59
(-) don't feel sick at all, and it's scaring me
feel like 'm just going to drop dead
Am  not going to feel bad at all, and then one day wake up dead
It's disconcerting
' don't want to get your hopes up
We put you on this experimental medication without much optimism, but as of right now  don't see any traces of the disease in your blood work
don't want to speak too soon, but we may have beaten this thing
Well what the fuck do  do now
Ira's eyes are wide with shock
Oh my god, oh my god
Ira goes to hug George, but it's a very awkward moment
Ira really wants a happy hug, but George is instantly uncomfortable
George is sitting at his computer
Ira is also seated
really want to thank you for your help through this time
was happy to help
Well, you didn't have to, and you were really there for me
was thinking, maybe we should write a movie together
60
Uh-huh
feel like 've learned a lot, and wanna use this good place 'm in right now to do something really creative
would pay you, certainly
make, you know, about a million dollars to write a script
can't give you half, but maybe one hundred, two hundred grand, but we'll figure it out
(what
) Yeah, we'll figure it out
thought a lot about my work when was sick and 'm in sort of a strange place career-wise, because 'm normally the goofy, funny guy and  don't know if people are expecting a change from me
And think people are expecting me to evolve, and it's important to evolve before they make a point of asking me why 'm not evolving
It's always good to keep breaking new ground
Is that something they taught you at the deli
'm not asking you for your advice,  just though we could start trying to come up with an idea
Well, 'm gonna start thinking
And
'm really happy for you
Are you freaking out right now
It's very strange
It's gonna take me a few days to process it, but it's a gift and 'm going to treat it that way
() 61
(') learned a lot from being sick and it's gonna help me make some good choices, and be a good person from now on
' ' Ira is eating with his fairly young  and his step-father And he thanked me for helping him, and  really think  was a help during this time
'm not saying that's why he got better, but he definitely had good energy and hear that helps your immune system
He's going to pay you two hundred thousand dollars to write a movie script
don't know, he said one or two hundred thousand
One or two hundred thousand
That's pretty vague
That's a wide range
'd push him toward two hundred thousand if  were you
Thank you for the advice, Bob
That's very helpful
This is good because now you can help with your sister's college tuition
What are you talking about
Your younger sister got accepted to Boston University but, as you know, your father and  aren't in the position to pay for it
62
So  have to
just stopped working at a supermarket two weeks ago
'm trying to create some financial stability for myself
The first time  make any real money,  can't just give it to her
Well that's very selfish
Well you guys went on a cruise to Greece last year
Maybe you shouldn't have gone, and saved for her college education
Oh, so after all we've done for you, we can't have any fun
We should never take a vacation
had to drop out of college after two years because you couldn't pay for it
Now  have to pay for hers
Let her figure it out
Let her get a job
didn't realize  raised such a selfish boy
When  was young would have done anything for my family
Then sell your house
Move into a smaller house
Use the extra money to pay for her college
Or tell her to work for a year or two, make some money, then she can pay for her own college
No one helped me out, 'm just digging out from under now
Don't get so high up on your horse with all your Hollywood friends don't like what you're turning into
63
One good thing happens to me in my entire life, and you have to try and take it away and ruin it
don't even know where you came from
Don't bother showing up for Thanksgiving
Thanksgiving is just for families
'  - Ira is on his computer
Leo and Mark are watching
(typing as he talks) Hey George, we're doing an Orphan's Thanksgiving tomorrow night, want to come
It's just for us losers who don't have any family to eat with
He's not gonna email back
He's never gonna want to eat Thanksgiving with us
The computer
The guys scream in delight
(reading email) Sure
What time
Do you need me to bring anything
(types back) 3 'clock at my apartment
Bring wine that we can't afford
The computer bings
(') (reading email) That's pretty much all wine on earth
See you then
64
() Email back and say: (trying to make a joke) If you can, bring that hot chick from your last movie
We definitely have room for her
() Well, then maybe just bring grain alcohol then
They all start laughing
The computer  again
(reading it) Hey Faggots,  know what you're doing
Stop emailing me
It's not amusing anymore
They all start high--fiving
He called us faggots
'  - Mark and Leo are doing the cooking
There a few other comedians (male and female) floating around the apartment
Ira watches the parade on
Daisy walks up, site down next to Ira
What have you been up to haven't seen you at the Improv
've just been busy
Will you excuse me
Ira gets up, walks out of the room

- George walks up, rings the bell
Inside the apartment he hears a bit of a scuffle, as if the friends are fighting over who can open the door
Leo opens the door, sweaty, with a welt on his face
65
Hey, George
How are you
Come on in
Then Mark appears from the side, also sweaty, with a welt on his neck
Happy Thanksgiving
Come on in
'  -   - Everyone is seated around the table
It's very awkward due to George's presence
It seems to suck the air out of the room
We're really glad you could come have Thanksgiving with us
It's a big thrill
It's weird,  feel like the old guy in the room
When  started out was always the young guy
It's strange how fast you become the old guy
And  feel exactly the same
Well, you don't know us, but you're with friends and admirers
know you, 've watched your show
"'Nuff Said
" It's a good show
You don't have to lie to him
He knows it's not good
No, it's good, it's cute
like it
() know it's not that funny, but they do slip in some funny shit in there every now and again
66
Don't be ashamed, it's good
But what about that girl on the show
How old is she
Tell me she's 25
No, she's 15
Holy shit
feel bad
don't want to tell you what  did watching that show
Are you serious
She's 15
No, she's actually 20
Okay, good
Now  don't feel so bad
Their weird friend, , pipes up
heard you were sick and now you're better
Is that like, really
what's that like
It's kinda like 9/11
You know after 9/11 you kind of liked everybody
But then it went away
It's like that
Did you think you were gonna go to heaven
Did you count up your sins
don't believe in any of that stuff, but  was hoping  was headed somewhere
felt like was
think you just wind up in the dirt
Worm food
Come on, Futoran, we're about to eat
67
Well, it's easy to think that way until you're headed for the dirt
Then your mind opens up a little bit, you know
Maybe it's desperation, or maybe you just start to see more of the big plan
Luckily  got a little more time before  find out
Daisy pops her head into the room
Food's ready
May  say the prayer
Everyone nods yes
(') Everyone hold hands
Thank you for the gifts this year
Thank you for (this
) And thank you for (that
) And hopefully next year 'll get to screw that girl on Mark's show
All our dreams will come true
You guys will get an apartment with less pubic hair on the toilet seat, you'll be able to afford a maid
Maybe next year you guys can get a better celebrity than me
Maybe Wolf Blitzer will come
also pray that no one put their balls on this turkey, 'm kind of scared you guys are about to give me salmonella poisoning
know this Orphan's Thanksgiving it's just a normal Thanksgiving for you guys, but it's a very special one for me
'm very glad to be here
'm not that glad to be here with you, but thank you for having me
'm sure it will be very memorable for you
Now let's find out what Leo's balls taste like
- Everyone's sitting down watching the football game
George motions to Ira, and then looks at Daisy as if to say, "Is that the girl you used to like
" 68
(points at Ira) This guy wrote me some funny jokes for that Mac gig
asked for some jokes and he sent me about a hundred
Seriously
(points at Leo) This guy sent me jack shit
If you want to succeed you need a work ethic like Ira over here
Why wouldn't  have sent you jokes
You didn't ask me for jokes
Sure  did
asked you and Ira to write me jokes and you flaked
Leo's eyes widen with anger
(') (to Daisy) Ira wrote this joke about Leopard, it was really funny
Do the joke, Ira
don't want to right now
It was like, what's great about
Leopard is you can watch a porno, write a porno, shoot a porno, and order a porno all at the same time
This guy's fucking funny
Leo jumps up suddenly and walks out of the room without saying anything
Ira watches him go, concerned
(') (to Daisy and Ira) You guys look like a cute couple, you should go out
well, the truth is we had a date, but  went out with Mark first and he broke it off
69
didn't expect you to blurt it out like that
That was very honest of you
If  didn't go out with every girl one of my friends slept with
let me put it another way
If none of my friends went out with girls went out with, none of them would have gotten laid
() So, are you guys dating now
No
This is making me uncomfortable
The whole thing, it makes me uncomfortable
You guys are young, why are you taking everything so seriously
As someone who's been through a lot recently, let me tell you something
The worst thing you can do is hold grudges and be judgmental
Everyone's making mistakes, everyone's screwing up
You guys are cute together
George points at Mark
(') know that Mark's not good in bed
Don't tell me he was a good lay
He can't have a big dick
Look at Ira
He's thick
He's gotta have a thick dick
Actually,  have a really skinny vagina, so 'm not really into thick
See
She's funny
She can take a joke, she's not sensitive
think 'm falling in love with both of you
70
George stands
(') 'm gonna walk away now, causing an awkward moment, that will be followed by a true moment, filled with chemistry
'm walking away now
Let the awkwardness begin
George walks out of the room
My brother's going to freak out that  met Davey
(to Ira) Did you go to the Wilco show
actually scalped them and made a hundred bucks
Well at last you didn't lose any money on the deal
'm sorry  got so upset with you, because it shows you how much like you, which is weird because we've hardly spoken
understand all of that
Well, attraction is all about smells, pheromones
Well, you smell right to me
Daisy smiles at Ira, just as Leo stomps back into the room
He charges right up to Ira, pissed off
You're a fucking prick, You're a piece of shit thief motherfucker
You stole a job from me, you stole my joke
You stole his joke
7l
The moment is ruined
Ira doesn't know what to say
: - Leo pulls Ira into the other room and goes off on him
He asked for me to write jokes too and you didn't tell me
Uh
yes
You
fucker
didn't think you would want to
Why wouldn't  want to
What, don't like money
don't like private jets
'm sorry, it's just,  needed the gig
And you are doing so much better than me
guess  just wanted this for myself
It wasn't yours to keep for yourself
You lied to me
did
And it was fucked up
And am sorry
don't know what to say
Don't say anything
Just get your shit, and get out of the apartment
Are you serious
You don't get let off the hook for going into faggy apology mode
That is a terrible strategy
() 72
(') don't know what the fuck has happened to you--but my name is on the lease, and  don't want to live with it
- Ira is mad at George for bringing up the jokes
never told Leo because  wanted the gig
didn't know you were fucking over your friend
Don't yell at me
Well  fucking live with you now because he told me to leave
He kicked you out for that
He said friends don't lie and 'm fucking with his career
Well in a way that's a compliment to me because he's so mad he can't hang out with me that's he mad at you
That's kind of cool
got you kicked out
Fuck off
'  -  - Ira is unpacking a dufflebag of clothes he grabbed from his apartment when he was kicked out
George pops his head in
This should be comfortable in here
This room is almost as big as your old apartment
(through gritted teeth) Thank you for letting me stay here
7 3
No problem
Hey, you want to come talk to me while  crash
No
You want to come talk to me while  crash
: '  - George is under the covers
He turns on the  and he changes channels until he finds "Charlie Rose
" They're interviewing a reporter from the New York Times about America's policy towards Pakistan
All right, Charlie
Talk to me
George closes his eyes
- George stands in the reception area
Terry's ready for you
'  - was thinking that now might be a good time for me to make that script "Making Amends
" Do you really think people want to see you make a movie about a guy who goes to  but isn't really an alcoholic
He just needs the companionship
That's a pretty big left turn
got money
want to challenge myself
You said you liked it
74
You know,  read it four years ago
need to read it again
don't remember not liking it
just can't tell you the studio will make it
Your last few movies didn't do so well
thought they did well overseas
You always do well in Australia, but that's about it
What if  do it for no money, just with back-end
don't know if that's going to cut it either
The head of the studio does a lot of drinking,  don't think he finds that whole area funny
Maybe if you commit to do another one of the Davey movies, could tie it to that, so they have to do both
'vedone four Davey movies
They wantme to do another sequelto that
We don't even have ascript
Wellthere's this great script goingaround town, Happy Holidays
Whichis about an immature 40 year old man who acts like a kid
In it he comes home for the holiday season for the first time in ten years
And havoc ensues
You get to make fun of Thanksgiving, and Hanukkah and Christmas and New Years
They say they can turn it into a Davey movie
Could  at least shoot the Making Amends movie first
No
75
Maybe 'll just write something myself
wish you would
You've never been able to do it in the past
You always talk a big game about writing your own shit
But 've yet to see a script land on my desk
'  - George and Ira are sitting at a large kitchen table
There is a computer on the table and index cards
On the floor is a corkboard
See, the thing  was thinking, was
you always play an immature guy
What if the joke of the movie is you're incredibly smart, intellectual and well-mannered
You just go the opposite way with it
There's nothing funny about being smart
All comedy comes from immaturity
Buster Keaton, Jerry Lewis, the Marx Brothers, Fields, Bill Murray, Steve Martin, Charlie Chaplin
They were all immature
They were all knuckleheads
Who wants to see a smart guy live his life normally
What's funny about that
What else you got
gotta go through my notes
'm thinking about taking a gig, and having a solid hit before getting into breaking new ground
Well we'll still write the script, right
76, Yeah, if we can come up with an idea
Let's just keep banging at it
can't
've got a date
You have a date
Who do you have a date with
This woman my agent set me up with
She raises money for this environmental group
guess she's like a normal person
can't live here alone in this house forever
need something of significance in my life
So 'm gonna go out on some dates
No pressure
You know what you should do, just as an experiment
You should try and not fuck her
Why would you say that
Because you're always saying you don't know if women like you for who you are
You don't know if they like you because you have money or you're famous
Why not take some time and get to know them before ass-raping them
In a romantic way
That's insulting
Don't take out your frustrations on me because you can't get laid by acting like 'm some sort of deviant
'm an adult
have adult sexual relationships
No one does what they don't want to do
Sex is how people decide if they like each other
'm testing my compatibility by ass-raping them
77
See, you can't do it
You can't even entertain the idea of getting to know somebody for a month before sleeping with them
That's not true
'm bored of sex, anyway
There is literally no body- part/orifice combination  haven't experimented with
There is nothing left to do
There is no nationalities  haven't
slept with, no age groups  haven't slept with
'm fully ready for normal
What nationalities have you slept with
Canada
Mexico
England
France
Spain
North Korea
Burma
Rwanda
Kenya
Tibet
Serbia
Chechnya
Iran
The Green Zone
Darfur
The Killing Fields of Cambodia
Mongolia
What about you
New Jersey
Do handjobs count
Because then also California
- George is talking with
You know,  haven't been out on a blind date, ever
This may be the first one
Oh  go out on them all the time
've been on a bunch of  Dates
What's  Date
It's a website where Jewish people find each other
78
So it's just a list of all the Jewish people
thought we didn't liked to be tracked and monitored like that
She looks at him, doesn't get the joke
(') You know, because of the
holocaust
(not understanding) It's just a great way for like- minded people to meet
What if you don't like Jews
She just stares at him
(') 'm joking
(a beat) So, uh,  hear you raise uh money for an environmental group
That must be very satisfying
It is, because, fixing the environment is really about having enough of a war chest to sue local government and corporations so they're forced to observe the environmental statutes that are already on the books
We also try to put pressure on the government to put pressure on other countries to clean up their environmental act
You know, one dilapidated factory in China can produce more pollution than every car in America puts out in one year
See
That's why  still drive a big truck
stop driving that truck and that factory shuts down
"79 (not smiling) know you're joking, but it's a very serious situation
People like you do a lot of damage to the environment
Whether it's taking a private jet by yourself, or getting driven around town limos around town or living in your gas-guzzling houses
Your carbon footprint is huge
You know what they say about people with a big carbon footprint
Big dick
'  - George comes in and wakes Ira up
Come on
We're gonna go do a gig tonight
Up north
And you're gonna open up for me
How big a theater
think two thousand
You should have told me so  could have prepared
've never played a place that big
How long do you want me to do
Twenty minutes
Thirty, if you can get there
Shit
Dress nice
Tickets are expensive
don't own anything nice
80
- Ira is driving George's Mercedes
George sits in player
backseat watching "Cloverfield" on a built-in We see images of different parts of California
How fucking up north is this
Its near San Francisco
So we have like five more hours to drive
It's not that far
It's like two more movies
don't like how you made me your limo driver
It's weird you're in the back and 'm up here
'd sit up front but the  player is back here
can't even listen to the radio because you're watching the movie
Can  sit back there and you drive
No
'm near-sighted
'll miss the exit
We Lear an  from the movie
(') Holy shit
What happened
The monster showed himself
81
() Great
- The car pulls up to the theater
- One of the  walks George and Ira through the back of the theater toward the dressing room
They walk across the stage and we see the empty 2,000 seat theater
Ira is freaked out
George and Ira are sitting in the dressing room, nibbling from the fruit tray
There's a knock at the door Security Person escorts Laura into the dressing room
Ira is thrown
Hey, you made it
wouldn't have missed it for the world, thanks for inviting me
You remember Ira
Hi Ira
Are you performing tonight
'm afraid so
've been told if 'm good it warms the crowd, and if 'm bad it makes them want George more, so
You look great
How are you feeling
'm hanging in there
82
thought a lot about you after left
Me too
Well the show is going to start in a minute,  better get to my seat
just wanted to say hi
Don't be too dirty tonight, you know that makes me uncomfortable
Now  have no jokes
Ira, you have to do an hour and half
She laughs
(') Come by after and give me the review
Okay
Break a leg
She exits
You didn't tell her that you're not sick anymore
Why wouldn't you tell her
need you to do something for me
After your set  gave you a seat right next to her
During the intermission  want yQ
u to tell her 'm not sick anymore
Me
Why do you want me to tell her
Because it's weird, and emotional
think she'll handle it better if it comes from somebody else
And then  can talk to her about it afterwards
83
That's weird
She'll be happy
It's not weird
You're the bearer of good news
You had to do this to me right before my set
Like 'm not nervous enough
: Ira is performing on stage, doing his set
He's doing really well
This theater crowd is very enthusiastic about being there and gives him the benefit of the doubt on most of his jokes
As he continues his set, he gets more confident and, for the first time in the film, we think he has the potential to be a strong comic
- Laura is sitting in her seat by herself
Ira makes his way across the aisle and sits down next to her
Ira
Oh my gosh
You were so good
You seem surprised
don't know, you seemed so nervous
But you were really solid all the way though, and your ending hunk really murdered
Thank you
Hopefully George won't be mad if  tired the audience out
don't think he has anything to worry about
They always go crazy for him
Before he got famous, he used to bomb all the time
() 84
(') And that's when  think he was the funniest
And now that everyone knows him, it's a little too easy for him,  think
No one was funnier when the audience hated him than George
He loved it
So you guys were dating right when he started doing well
Yeah
But you always knew he was gonna do well
He had so much charisma
He would walk into a room and in ten minutes that whole room would be about him
Even before anyone knew who he was
Where did you meet him
was the hat-check girl at the Improv
And  was acting
used to do guest spots on all those shows, like Melrose Place, Beverly Hills 90210
always played the bitch
don't know why, but  was on the top of the bitch list
You don't seem like a bitch
That's because  was acting
Sounds like fun days
It was, for awhile
Reveal George in the wings trying to get a look at them from a distance
don't know if you've heard, but it looks like George's medicine is working
What do you mean
85
When George got sick they didn't think they had any medicine that would help, so they put him on experimental medicine
And the last time he went to the doctor they couldn't detect his blood disease
They think it might be gone
moment as Laura takes this in
Why didn't George tell me
He just found out
He doesn't want to jinx it
He doesn't want people to get excited, and then have it come back again
The lights go down
(
) Ladies and Gentlemen
Here's the man you came to see
George Simmons
The place
() thought everyone came to see me
George begins his act
He could not kill harder
Or look more healthy and charismatic
We can tell it is all a show for Laura
Laura is completely thrown by this turn of events
The content of George's act is meant to portray him in a more positive, sympathetic light to Laura
He talks about being sick and the lessons he learned in a very dark, hilarious, and also uplifting way
All of it is intended to make him look like he has grown up and become wiser, and someone you could trust and spend your life with
- Laura is talking to George and Ira
86
really don't know what to say
It's not like you weren't good before, but your act is so much more sophisticated, but just as funny
've never seen you speak so honestly on stage before
You used to say these goofy jokes
It was really something, you know, and you should be really proud of yourself
Thanks
lot has happened
And at least  got some good jokes out of it
Well, thanks for inviting me
'm really glad  came
Ira and  are driving out of town tomorrow,  thought maybe we could stop by your place on our way out
want to see what the ranch looks like, and meet your husband
My husband is actually in China for another week, or so
He spends a lot of time there helping American businesses break into that market
So you won't meet him this time, but it would be great if you came by
That would be fun
'll give you the tour
Okay
We'll come by in the morning
Okay
An awkward beat
Laura gives Ira a hug goodbye, then hugs George goodbye, trying to make it appear as if they have equal weight
(') Bye
'll see you then
She looks at Ira
As she exits-- 87
(') You were good too
Why do we have to stop by there tomorrow
The drive is long enough as it is
George opens up his wallet, gives Ira a thousand dollars
Here's your money for tonight
Good job
'm excited to see her ranch hear it's delightful
- Ira and George are in a room that has two queen-sized beds
They each lay on their bed in the dark
Why couldn't we have gotten two different rooms
What's the fun in that
You can go pay for your own room,  don't care
So, what happened with you and Laura
You seem to get along so well
Why did you cheat on her
was young, stupid
and  liked fucking girls
Why do you think cheated
You would do it too if anyone would fuck you
How many times did you cheat on her
Two or three times
a week
for a couple of years
88
Jesus
It was awful
There was even marriage talk
My parents didn't want me to do it because she wasn't Jewish
She was taking classes to convert, even
mean, how cool is that
She was changing religions to be with me
She knew more about being a Jew than  did from those classes
She was so cute when she spoke Hebrew, it sounded so wrong
George says the Jewish grand prayer with a waspy accent
(') And then one day, somebody told her,  don't know who
And that was that
Why do you want to go see her tomorrow
We could do something productive like get some writing done
like her
love her
miss her
just want to spend a little time with her
know nothing will come of it
just miss being around her
beat
George starts clicking through Video On--Demand adult movies
(') Anything looking good to you
don't want to watch adult movies with you
okay
You want to watch Juno
Okay
89
Juno begins playing
: '  - George and Ira drive up to the house
It's a large one-story house that is part of a ranch with a lot of land and a horse stable
They walk to the front door, ring the doorbell
George seems; a little nervous
You okay, buddy
Yeah, of course  am
Laura opens the door
Hi
We've been waiting for you
Come on in
'  - This place is beautiful
Thanks
We've been here for five years
think  just finished decorating it
She leads them through the living room into a huge open kitchen
On the island, there is freshly squeezed lemonade, chips and dip
She has over-prepared for their arrival
Can  live here
of course, you can clean the stables
You have horses
90
Yes
Clarke, my husband, was a real city boy
But for some reason he loves horses
Of course 'm lef t to take care of them
But yes, we have three horses
That's crazy, owning a horse can't even keep a goldfish alive
All right, well, we're ready for the big tour
want to see how you live
Suddenly, Laura's five-year-old daughter  runs into the room and she's pissed
Mom
You said you were coming back
We're playing American Idol, you're ruining the game
Ira is shocked to see that Laura has a child
This complicates a situation he already thought was getting too complicated
'll come right up
This is my friend, George
And Ira
It's my turn to sing and you're supposed to be the judge and you're not in there and 'm very angry
How old are you
Five
But  turn six very soon
Really
Because  thought you were like nine, about to turn ten
She's very pretty
(to Ingrid) like your hair
'm so sick of people telling me they like my hair
George is clearly not that good with kids
Okay
do not like your hair
Don't make fun of me
He's just joking Ingrid
My hair
have curly hair too
Curly hair is the best
Last week my mom straightened it and it almost went to the floor
If you straighten my hair,  look crazy
look like the killer from No Country for Old Men
Have you seen that movie
, Laura's ten-year-old daughter storms into the room
You guys left me all alone in the playroom
If you're gonna leave 'm just gonna go talk on the webcam with Caroline
Don't be rude
This is Ira and George
Oh,  know you
My mom watches your movies all the time
But most of them 'm not allowed to see
George smiles at Ira--Laura's a little busted
Oh, really
Do you like them
Which one's your favorite
92
don't know
don't really like the ones 'm allowed to see, but think  would like the ones 'm not allowed to see
But she says cant' see them till 'm sixteen
Sixteen
Just fast-forward past the bad parts
The whole thing is a bad part
George  in a slightly flirty fashion with Laura
Ira is getting uncomfortable with the subtext
('  ) 'mon, let's finish the game
George, Ira, Laura, and Mable are sitting on the floor
Ingrid stands on a make-shift stage singing a Miley Cyrus song while wearing a feather boa and sunglasses and a red wig
() You've got the best of both worlds
Rock it out take it slow
And then you rock out the show
Everyone applauds for her
Okay
Now it's time to see what the judges say
thought you had a lot of energy, you're clearly gonna make it to the final four, and  love your outfit
What do you think, Randy
Yo, dawg
That was the bomb
It was a little pitchy in places, but dug it
really dug it
'm Simon, and  thought it was horrible
don't how you made it this far in the competition
() 9 1 (') think Paula is drunk
You will never be American Idol
Mable, stop it
Stop being mean to your sister
Say something nice
() You were good
Okay, you're not Simon anymore
(to George) Simon, what did you think
can't believe 'm saying this, but  agree with Paula
think you're the one to beat
They all applaud
Ira notices Laura looking at George with admiring eyes that reek of more than friendship
Okay Mable, you're up
Mable instantly starts gyrating in a manner that is not appropriate for a ten-year-old and singing the Fergie song "London Bridge
" () want to go down like London, London
told you not to do that
Simon, what do you think
She was horrible
She's a terrible singer
She's inappropriate
Okay, who's next
Randy
don't know, Dawg
It was a bad song choice
'm not feeling it
My turn
Get ready to be blown away
94
George gets up on stage
(') () Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home
() Just an urchin livin' under the street, 'm a hard case that's tough to beat
'm your charity case so buy me somethin' to eat
'll pay you at another time
Take it to the end of the line
Boo
Boo
What
It's Paradise City, by Guns and Roses
You sound like a girl
Vote him off
- Laura sits on a
George sits behind her
Ira is on another  with Ingrid sitting in front of him, as he steers
Mable rides a very small dirt bike
All right
Here we go
They start driving down a path that goes around the edge of the ranch
George has his hands around Laura's waist as they drive
Ira looks over, concerned
- Laura shows them their horses, chickens, goats and ducks
95
- Laura points out a small pond and a fenced-in riding area
Laura slows down and allows Ira, Mable and Ingrid to get ahead and turn a corner
Then she stops the  and turns around and kisses George
George looks surprised, but happy
Laura just stares at him, trying to decide what she makes of him now
Then we hear (
) Mom
Mom
Laura hits the gas and they continue the tour
'  - The kids are playing in the background as George, Laura and Ira talk
Ira, Laura invited us to stay over for dinner
But it's like a seven, eight hour drive home
If we stay for dinner, we're not going to get home till like four in the morning
George stares at Ira for a beat, then -- Don't worry, we'll figure it out
You have something to do in the morning
No
Then everything will be fine
Me and George are gonna go to the supermarket and buy some food so can cook dinner
You think you'll be okay watching the kids
It'll only take forty-five minutes
96
Sure
'm great with kids
was a camp counselor for five years
Camp Winadu
Kids love me
'm like a human teddy bear
: '  - Laura is driving through town
George sits in the passenger seat
This town is so small and adorable
It's like out of a Demi Moore movie
Clarke's company is about forty- five minutes from here
This town seemed so perfect when we were looking for a house
There's no traffic, there's one coffee house, one bookstore, one market
No crime
But after you've lived her a few years you hunger for another coffee shop, a bigger bookstore, and a little crime
It gets so boring
And it's such a small town, God forbid you miss one of you kid's soccer games, they put the scarlet letter on you
it can't be that bad
You live on a pretty little ranch
You have horses, a duck
It must be a nice life
We used to have so much fun don't think  have that much fun anymore
don't like who 'm turning into
Is the fun over have to get up every morning at six, drive my kids to school and then  have 6 hours before  have to pick them up
have to yell at them to do their homework, be a taskmaster, then  make them dinner
() 97
(') It takes an hour to shower them and put them to bed
And then it's 8:30 and  pass out
And it's great, but tuck
And when both kids are done with high school 'll be 49 years old, and then 'll have probably 6 very healthy years, then 'll kind of slow down and then 'll be an old woman
And that was it
And it's great, but fuck
couldn't believe you moved out of You were getting some good jobs as an actress
You got to play the bitch on Melrose Place for awhile and make out with Andrew Shue
That was pretty good
Do you miss it
Yes
Being a mom is very fulfilling, but there are other parts of me and every once in awhile  go a little crazy
How do you go crazy
just get bored and depressed
And you know how my  is kind of out of control
This little boy hit Ingrid in school, and his mom acted like she didn't care at all, so  told her to fuck off
They both laugh
Oh, that must have gotten ugly
How long did that stay awkward for
() Always
That woman hates me
And hate her
And now our kids really like each other, so it's really fucked up
Maybe you weren't acting on Melrose Place
98
She laughs
Screw you
'  - Ira, Mable and Ingrid are making elaborate paper mache heads
As they do it, Ira is leading them in the type of song you would sing at camp
'  - And my husband cheated on me, said he did it once but  know because learned from you, they do it once, they do it all the time
You either cheat or you don't
well  don't anymore
haven't cheated on anybody since you haven't even been in a committed relationship since you, so it's impossible for me to have cheated
That's both flattering and deeply disturbing
thought a lot about you when was sick, and  would do anything for another chance
know it creates a mess, but  think it would be worth it
think we both know it's what we should be doing
He kisses her
We can't go the supermarket
Why
Because people will see us
99
So
What's wrong with that
Well it'll be weird because we're about to do something we shouldn't do
'  - Ira, Mable and Ingrid are outside at a table building houses out of Popsicle sticks
If you had an Exacto knife we could cut these sticks in half and make a chimney
() When is George gonna die
George is gonna die
Why would you say that
heard my mom talking to her friend about it on the phone and crying
don't want George to die
What do you care
You just met him
George is gonna be fine
They told me my grandfather wouldn't die, but he did
Here's the truth
George was really sick
() 100
(') But he went to the doctor and they found the right medicine and now he's better
And he's gonna live a long time
The kids buy it, and Ira seems relieved
think my mom's in love with him
Ira looks doubly disturbed
He quickly goes back to his popsicle sticks
'  - George and Laura park in the driveway, then sneak around to a back guest house
- George and Laura enter the guest house, which has been turned into her husband's office/playroom/sports-viewing room
On the wall are six enormous flatscreen TVs
The room is also filled with sports memorabilia in Lucite cases and expensive looking sports photography
Does somebody in your family like sports
They start passionately making out, slamming into the flatscreens
really never thought  was going to see you again
grieved for you like you were dead
They continue to kiss
Suddenly she stops
(') can't do this
Then let's not do it
She stares at him, trying to figure out what he's become-- is he a good guy or a bad guy
gotta get back to the kids
101
LAtJRA'  -  - Laura and George are walking into the house
They are not holding any bags
They walk into the living room where Ira is making a Spongebob SquarePants puzzle on the floor with Mable and Ingrid
You're back
That was quick
The town is beautiful
Where are the groceries
We decided ordering in might be a little more fun
- Everyone is sitting on the couch watching Ratatouille on the television
They see car lights in the driveway
Food's here
All right, everybody
Let's sit down at the kitchen table
Everyone gets up and heads toward the kitchen
Laura opens the front door, George is a few steps behind her
handsome man of forty appears
This is not the pizza guy
It's , Laura's husband
(') Clarke, oh my gosh
What are you doing home
The man  was supposed to have a meeting with had a heart attack, if you can believe that
So  decided to try and sneak home for a few days before my next set of meetings
George appears behind Laura, not knowing what he's getting himself into
102
Oh
Hello
Hello
Oh, Clarke
George had a performance last night in town, which  went to, and him and his opening act, Ira, came by to say hello on their way out of town
There is an awkward moment, then Clarke smiles and gives George a compassionate look, the type of look you give a man you think is dying
It is really nice to meet you, George
Laura talks about you all the time, and we're obviously big fans of your movies
Well, thank you
You've got a great family and a great home
'm so glad you're home, honey
Laura gives Clarke a hug and a peck
Then Ira walks over
What's taking so long with the pizza
Before anyone can say anything the    appears in the doorway
Hi
That'll be twenty-eight forty- seven, please
- Everyone is seated for dinner, including the kids
() This is really great pizza
Thank you very much
() 103
(') It tastes just like New York pizza, which is so surprising because you can't get good pizza in Los Angeles, so you wouldn't think you could get it in Northern California
But this really tastes like New York pizza
long pause
Sounds like your business is going very well
People never thought China would do this much business with us, you know, but it didn't seem like a risky proposition for me
They've got a billion people, we make all kinds of cool shit in America, they start finding out about it on the internet and what-not
Sooner or later they're gonna find a way to get our shit
He speaks Chinese
For real
Ingrid yells at something in Chinese
You don't think they want new mobile phones
new -box
'm trying to get access into North Korea, no shit
That situation could chance overnight
That is a huge market waiting to be tapped
It's already starting in Cuba
My friend backpacked across China and he caught some sort of virus or something from what he ate
He was sickforweeks
He still has it
It'sthekind of thing you can't getridof, you have it for the restofyour life, but it stays dormant
So, George
How are you holding up
104
Uh
'm hanging in there
How are you feeling
He's doing really well
He's been very strong
It's a terrible situation
'm so sorry
appreciate that
He's been fighting the good fight
His doctors are taking very good care of him
Ira can believe this conversation is happening
You're a tougher man than me don't know how  could go about my day with that hanging over my head
It just makes you appreciate every moment
It brings things into focus, you suddenly realize what's important in life
Does anybody want seconds
Or should  bring out the desert
'd love desert
What do you have
Do you have any ice cream or cake, or anything like that
have a real big sweet tooth right now
Why don't we go into the kitchen and do an ice cream bar with kids right now
've got a better idea, make a really good milkshake
We should all go make milkshakes with the kids right now in the kitchen
105
Empty milkshakes litter the coffee table
Do you know who might be able to help you
Chinese doctor
Have you explored Eastern medicine at all
Now's not the time to talk about this
'm trying to help the man
No,  haven't
Hey
'm the last guy who would buy into that shit, but it works
He really is the last guy who would buy into that shit
Our country's only two hundred years old
The Chinese have been around for thousand of years figuring this shit out
How  got into it,  had acid ref lux and nothing was working and then this guy at work turned me onto a Chinese doctor and he gave me some herbs that tasted like dogshit, but they worked
() take herbs for my
They really helped
Daddy, you've been cursing a lot
You owe me a dollar for every curse
think you owe me fifty dollars
106
This conversation is scaring me don't want George to die
You girls can go play in the other room
The Chinese have a completely different way of looking at health
They don't think doctors should attack the diseases in the body, they're all about trying to support the body and make it stronger, so the body can fight off the disease
It works
've seen it
wish could find a way to mass-market Chinese medicine in this country
Someone's gonna do it and make a fuck-load of money
Because these people get old, really old
You can't kill these people
Either that or they're all young and they just look like shit
Clarke laughs
This guy's funny
You should be opening up for this guy
Hey, who wants a drink
- Everyone is taking a walk around the ranch
It is very pretty outside
'm going to retire in seven years
'm done
'm playing golf for the next fifty years
Work hard now, then get out
That's my plan
'm putting in the time
Then 'm getting the fuck out
don't like working
will do it
like what it gets me
But  don't like it
You ever see Laura act
She was quite an actress in her day
107
George, stop
That's what  hear
Can't say watched that much 'Melrose Place' back in the day
She keeps telling me to watch the videos but, you know,  was never a big 'Party of Five' fan
Well,  also ran a theatre company
And it was down to me and Cameron Diaz for 'The Mask
'  sacrificed a lot for our family
Okay, if you say so
(a beat) The Mask was a funny fucking movie
You know what other movie Cameron Diaz was great in
'There's Something About Mary
' Laura looks livid at her husband's insensitivity and disrespect
They keep walking
(') love walking it off after a big meal
It's beautiful here at night
There's no pollution here like in so you can actually see the stars
They are beautiful, but we have to get going
We have a really long drive to get back to Los Angeles
You can't leave now, you won't get back until daylight
You should crash in the guest house
'm sure it not as fancy pants as where you live, George, but it's better than driving all night or crashing at a hotel
() 108
(') And if you want to hang out tomorrow  just installed six flatscreens, we can watch all the football games we want
And dog- racing from Florida
There's a big game tomorrow
Ira, you must have played some ball in your day
No, 'm just big-boned
We probably should get some rest before the drive
All right, show us to our quarters, sir
- George sleeps on the bed
Ira sleeps on a couch across the room
The door slowly opens, Laura enters wearing a bathrobe
She walks to the bed and quietly slips under the covers, removing her bathrobe in the process
Without ever speaking, she pulls the covers over both of them and begins to make love to him
George is surprised but not completely shocked and goes along happily with it
: Ira, he never wakes up
- You sure you can't stay
We really do need to get back have to visit my mom
can't miss it
It's her birthday
Everyone in my family is coming in from across the country for it
She's turning 65
It's very important we get back for it
That's too bad,  wish you could stay
(very serious) wish  could say  was gonna see you again, but  can't say that
His eyes start to mist up
109
Clarke, don't
You don't need to do that
You know what
think  do need to do that
One thing  learned in China from some Buddhist friends of mine is it's important to have an open heart, to live in the moment, and to speak the truth to each other
So 'd like to say to you, George, that it was a great pleasure to meet someone who had such a big impact on my wife's life
really like you
And wish we had more time to get to know each other
And  wish you a peaceful end to your journey
And another great journey on the other side of it
Clarke hugs George
really don't know what to say re- ally don't know what to say
That was beautiful, honey
Well let me walk them to the car
Ingrid walks over
Don't be sad
Ira told us that his medicine is working and he's not sick anymore
think that was a secret
don't think you were supposed to say that
Mable, take Ingrid into the house
Can we watch another SpongeBob movie
Atlantis
Squarepantis
110
Yes
Go into the house and watch a movie now
Mable and Ingrid walk back to the house
(') What the fuck is going on around here
(to Laura) Is that true
never said that he was still sick
He just took some medicine and it's looking better
You can't detect it in his blood, but it could come back
Is it looking better
Or is he better
(to Ira) Is he sick anymore
Well
don't how you define these things-'m not
sure
is something going on here
Are you getting your revenge on me while 'm away
came clean with you, you can't come clean with me
You know what
don't know what want now
Oh shit
It's
So this is what you want
Was he ever sick in the first place
He was sick
He was very sick
Because if this is what you want, 'll leave right now
'm not going to play these games
'm happy to leave
'm not gonnna have you put me on the cross because  made some mistakes
You guys enjoy each other
could give a fuck
If you need me, 'll be at my apartment in China
Clarke leaves
'  - Mable and Ingrid are asleep
- Laura is alone in her room, crying
(she might be on the phone, talking honestly with a friend
) - George lays on the bed
Ira is pacing around the room
What the fuck is going on
Did you guys do something
We had sex in Clarke's office
Why
Because  love her
She's the best thing that's ever happened to me
But she has two kids, she's married
She's miserable
He cheated on her
You cheated on her
112
Yeah, but that was a long time ago
've changed
You saw that douche bag
You don't think he's fucking geishas on every business trip
He was trying to cure you with herbs
He seems like a great guy
This is none of your fucking business
Just stay out of it
can't stay out of it
We took your car here
have no way of leaving
This shit is deeper than you understand
People get divorced
People make mistakes and then they fix them
That's how life works
It's not a big deal
know you're still sad because your parents got divorced
Well get the fuck over it
Call a fucking cab and go home
So what are we gonna do
You're gonna sleep in Clarke's office
'm gonna go talk to Laura
'  - George walks into the room, discovers Laura on the computer, going through papers
She is smoking a joint
On, there you are
've been looking for you
've been going through all the bank statements, trying to figure out which are in his name and which are in mine
() 113 (-) Almost all the accounts are in his name
wonder if he did that on purpose
Are you smoking a joint
Yeah
My best friend Nancy grows this stuff on a hill by her house
You want some
No, that stuff makes me paranoid
Not me
It makes me feel sharper, Some people get tired,  get more energy, more clear
What's happening
What's happening
Whatever we want to happen is gonna happen now
'm free
'm fucking free
Laura gets up, kisses him
(') We're free
() Yeah, we're free
They start kissing again
She starts to moan loudly
(') Not so loud, your kids are sleeping
tank could roll through this place, it wouldn't wake them up
They kiss some more
She moans louder
'  - Ira calls Daisy on the phone, in a panic about what is happening
114
(
0
) Hello
(on phone) Hey, Daisy
It's Ira
(
0
) Oh
Ira
What's going on
just wanted to talk to you because 'm in the middle of a terrible situation and  don't have anyone  can talk about it with
My friends are all mad at me and George is kind of losing his mind
(
0
) You can tell me, what is it
Look,  know you think  have the moral code of some guy from the 50s like Dwight Eisenhower, but 'm with George and he's hitting on his ex-girlfriend who's married now and has kids and  don't know what to do
'm kind of freaking out think 'm having a panic attack
(
0
) Well don't have a panic attack, that's not going to help anything
Well telling me to not have a panic attack is not going to stop it
(
0
) (screaming at the top of her lungs) '
Haha, very funny
(
0
) Seriously, what's going on
Well  guess they dated like ten years ago
115
Ira and Daisy begin to have a bonding conversation
-         , - Laura, George, Ira, Mable and Ingrid are happily cooking and eating breakfast
They look like a happy, strange kid of family
- Numerous images of them horse-back riding
Ira looks terrified
- They are all fishing, feeding ducks
- They pick lemons out of a tree
- They are riding ATVs while their dogs chase them
- The kids are climbing a tree
Laura is spotting them
George pulls Ira aside
() Jesus Christ, what time is it already
It's 10:15 in the morning
Oh my god
Really
mean, this is fun, but  don't know how much can take
Hopefully they'll take a nap at some point
want to take a nap
116
They don't look that tired
The kids are yelling and screaming and clearly have eight more hours in them
- George, Laura, Ira, and the kids are seated at a table
The kids are coloring with crayons
Look what  did
want this hung up on the wall
She shows them the picture, which is clearly not appropriate for the wall: a picture of herself choking and dying
(') The food here made me sick
Mama,  have to go to the bathroom
Come wipe my butt
have to talk to them for a minute
Mable, go wipe your sister's butt
She can do it
She's almost six
That's weird
Ingrid and Mable walk off together
wet the bed til  was eleven
It wasn't even a mental thing
just got relaxed when  was asleep
spoke to Clarke
He's going to fly back to China tonight
was thinking about driving to the airport and meeting him there and telling him that when he comes back, he should find another place to live
117
That's great
Are you okay doing that
Yes
It's what  want
just need to figure out when we would move down to
It might be better to let the kids finish out the school year because  have to apply to the private schools in , and  don't know if  missed the deadline
Then 'd have to look into the charter schools
Sometimes these private schools, if you give them a donation, they let your kids in
Maybe you can stay up here for part of the year if can't make it happen
Sure
If 'm not shooting a movie, or on tour or something, that would be great
Laura leans in and kisses George
George is not big on public displays of affection
He kisses back, but you can tell that he's very uncomfortable
They hear the kids headed back to the table and quickly separate
made her wipe her own butt
did it, but  don't know if  did a good job
(to George) Look at what  drew
drew a picture of you
Look
Show Mama
George holds it up
It is a picture of several people
(') That's you
That's George
That's Mommy
And Daddy
And me
And Mable
That's all of us
We see the picture, and it is everybody holding hands
118
- George and Ira are walking around a very small bookstore
This is a small bookstore
They've only got one Philip Roth book
Didn't he write like fifty books
So when are we going to go home
You're not talking at all about when we're going to go home
She's going to talk to Clarke tonight, and then she's going to make a plan
We've got to get over that hurdle
Are you okay with everything
This is happening pretty fast
This is exactly what  wanted
Okay
mean, she's cool, right
She's nice
don't really know her very well
She was kind of cooler when  knew her back in the day
She's still hot, but she was crazy hot back then
Her attitude has changed a bit
With the kids and all
Back then she was really sexy, and all about fucking
know she's busy with her life now, but it is a little different
Yeah, well when you have two kids and a husband, and horses and ducks, it's not all about fucking
() 119, (') That's just the hormones of youth
'm all about fucking
But  don't expect to be when  get older
'll be occasionally about fucking, which is normal
The fact that you're all about fucking now is the weird thing
Well hopefully everything will work out
If it doesn't, it just wasn't meant to be
What does that mean
It means 'm going to give it a shot
'm excited, but 'm not going to really know if it works until we're in it
hope 'm just not in love with the person she used to be
She's about to leave her husband for good
She has two kids
You're not sure this is going to work
There's no way to ever be sure that anything's going to work couldn't live up here
She wants me to live up here
don't think can do it
Maybe a couple of weeks a year
Well, she'll live with you
Do you think she means that she's going to bring the kids too
Of course
What else would she do
don't know, don't some men get custody of the kids
Or they split the custody
like the kids, but 've never lived with kids before
() 120
(') The young one's kind of cute, but don't think  can stand the old one full time
There's too much going on there
But  could definitely tolerate the young one
She's cute
Maybe they can split kids
Maybe Clarke will take the annoying one
Ira just stares at him, not sure what to do
'  - George kisses Laura, and then she gets in her car
'll be back in an hour and a half, tops
And then it all begins
Okay, call me if you need any backup
love you
(really uncomfortable) love you
The car drives off
'  - Ira is on the floor with the kids
He watches the headlights of Laura's car disappear down the driveway
George walks back into the room
Okay, 'm going to go into the other room and watch some
You don't want to hang with the kids
Nah,  was going to watch four hockey games at once
've never done that
121
okay, but 've got to run out and grab some cigarettes
But you don't smoke
never smoked in front of you because you were sick
But  do
/
'  - Ira drives in a panic
Holy shit, holy shit
Where's the fucking airport around here
Ira tries to figure out how to work the navigation system in a panic
He can't make it work
'  - George is watching the kids
He is not good with them, so it is very weird
(
) George
Help
George jumps up and runs to her
She is in the bathroom sitting on the toilet
(') Can you wipe my butt
Don't you know how to do it
don't do it good
() Okay
/
'  - Ira is still messing with the navigation system
He finally gets frustrated and punches it
12-)
Ira yells to someone on the street
How do you get to the fucking airport
'  - George calls Ira, gets voice mail
Where are you, where are you
You have to come back here
need your help
don't know how to do this
He walks back to where the kids are
They are watching tv
All around the room are family pictures
He is beginning to feel bad about what is happening
/
- Laura gets to check-in, looks around
She does not see Clarke
'  - George is sitting at the kitchen table
Mable walks over
think my mom and dad are getting a divorce
don't want my parents to get divorced
All my friends' parents are divorced, and they're not happy
Why would you say that
heard my mom talking to her friend
listened through the wall
She was looking for a lawyer
He cheated on her
What does cheating mean
That he's going to marry someone else
Why don't they just try harder
123
- Laura looks for Clarke at the news stand
'  - George is on the phone
Laura, it's George
Come back to the house
Maybe you shouldn't do it
Maybe it's too early for this
Call the house
- Laura walks into the airport lounge
She sees Clarke
She looks at him for a moment, then heads over to him with determination
/
- Ira parks in the no-standing zone
He gets out and starts walking into the airport
His phone rings, he answers
It's George
(
0
) Where are you
'm getting cigarettes
(
0
) You've been gone for forty minutes
got lost
don't know this town
(
) Well come back
don't know how to take care of these kids, 'm not a camp counselor like you
These kids are on to me
The older one's too intense
She's troubled
She's like Damien, from the Omen
need help
124
Ok, 'll hurry back
- Ira runs around the airport, looking for Laura and Clarke
-    - Laura is talking to Clarke, emotional
Clarke is crying
'm so sorry
This only happened because of me
It's all my fault
made you feel terrible
made you feel unsafe in our relationship
'm so sorry
Please forgive me
Ira stands there, staring at them
'm sorry too
love you so much
It was just a flirtation
It never went anywhere
It's just after you cheated on me,  felt so alone
And you were gone so often that felt like our life doesn't work
Then  have to make a change
'll stop most of the traveling
There's nothing more important than you and the kids
Ira starts to turn to sneak away
Clarke sees him
(') Ira
What's going on
What are you doing here
Oh, 'm just headed back to Los Angeles
've got some spots at the Improv 've got to do this weekend
(under her breath) Oh, fuck
12-5
You're headed back to Los Angeles
Then why are you at the International terminal
This is the International terminal
'm so confused, 've never been to this airport before
Yeah, this is the Air China First Class Lounge
that everyone else in the lounge is Chinese
('  ) What the fuck is going on
What the fuck is going on, Laura
don't know what to say
Tel- me the truth
Just tell me the tri
t_h
;_ came here to tell you that wanted you to move out when you came home
But  realized this was a mistake, so  didn't say it
Please don't hold that against me
We've worked everything out
Everything is fine
Who's watching the kids
Who's watching the fucking kids
An adult is watching them
Is George watching our fucking kids
will kill him
Clarke runs off
What the hell happened
12 6 Who the fuck are you
Get the fuck out of my life
You and George have to get the fuck out of my life
You are ruining everything
Uh oh
Ira runs out of the lounge
Laura runs out also
'  - George with the kids
Oblivious to what is happening
- Ira comes back out, his car is about to be towed
No, no, no
'm here
'm here
/
' Clarke drives home, pissed off
/
' Laura drives home, quickly
' Ira drives, in a panic, on his cell phone
The phone goes through to George's voice mail
George
Clarke is coming back to the house
He knows everything
'm coming to get you
Be at the end of the driveway
No
Be at the next driveway over
To the north
/
'  - Clarke arrives at the house
He sees George sitting with the kids
(angry-to Mable and ) Can you take it into the family fun room
Are you two going to fight
Ye s
'  - George and Clarke walk outside
Clarke puts up his fists, ready to fight
She's not happy
Clarke punches George in the face then kicks him martial arts style
No one who's married is fucking happy
Leave us alone
You fucked up
You fucked it up with her a long time ago
Let it go or  will kill you
will literally kill you till you're fucking dead
That disease didn't kill you
But will kill you
You shouldn't joke about my disease
That was very serious
Very scary
Clarke punches him several times, but they are more like martial arts hits
(') What the hell is that
Ira arrives
George starts yelling at Ira
(') Don't jump in
Whatever you do, don't jump in
don't want your help
128
Okay
You said you were getting cigarettes then you ran to the airport to stop her
What kind of friend are you
am a good friend because this entire situation is crazy
You are out of control
didn't deserve what you did to me
You betrayed me
When  got there, she was already kissing him
never even had a chance to stop it
didn't get to do anything
Don't pretend you're fucking mad at each other, just to distract me so won't beat your ass
Clarke pushes George
(') You're gonna come to my house
You're gonna come to my fucking house
You have to get your own life
Leave us the fuck alone
Don't hit me
've been sick
They don't know
The medicine is working now, but 'm still sick
Clarke punches George
(') (to Ira) What are you doing
said to jump in
You told me not to jump in
129
That's what "don't jump in" means
It means "jump in
" Help me
Ira steps in
Clarke hits him hard, then kicks him
(') You're a terrible fighter
know, that's why  became a comedian, because everyone used to beat me up
George runs at Clarke who cracks him in the head hard, sending him to the floor
Then Ira takes a run at him and Clarke kicks Ira in the face twice, with both feet
Laura runs into the middle of the scene
Laura, tell Clarke to stop
Clarke, please don't do this
Don't tell me what  can and can not do
Laura, tell him
Tell him you want to be with me now
Laura doesn't answer
(') Laura
Why did you have to come here and confuse me
Everything was fine before you came here
Now everything is all screwed up
Laura, what's it going to be
Are you going with him, or are you going with me
Laura looks at Clarke
130
With him
Don't do this
You fucked up my life
And now fucked up yours
But just a little
Probably just for a day
She walks back into the house
Hit the road before  put you through another round
You cheated on her too
Yeah, but we're married
We're going to work through this shit
You should have waited until you were married to cheat
It buys you another chance
Clarke punches George
Ira is on the ground
He doesn't get up
She told me  was the love of her life
And she loves me more than she loves you
When she said that, did she think you were dying
Yeah
Too bad you had to 'Live and find out it wasn't true
Leave my fucking family alone
Clarke punches him
George gets a punch in but it doesn't hurt Clarke
Clarke punches him again
(') can do this all night
131
Clarke hits George again
Ira leaps on Clarke and now all three are on the ground rolling around, arms flailing
(to Ira) Stop Ira, you're hitting me too
Mable and Ingrid appear outside
What are you guys doing
What's happening
The three look at the kids and instantly feel awful
We're just playing that's all
We're wrestling
It's fun
Boys like to wrestle just like girls
They all start wrestling some more, but this time it is fake playful
They give each other noogies, and tickle each other so the kids won't be scared
little blood runs off of George's face
Are you bleeding
No
We were just painting
got some paint on my cheek
Come on girls
Let's go inside
Mable and Ingrid run inside
Clarke turns to George
(') You know what sucks about this like your movies and now  can't watch them anymore
Clarke walks away, then walks back
132
(') 'm sorry
That was mean
Through ail of this,  want you to know something
'm glad that you're not sick, and  understand
And forgive you
Clarke goes inside
That was meaner than him punching you
That is a demented motherfucker
George punches Ira in the face
Ira fires back two punches at George's face and he stumbles back
None of you fuckers can hurt me
George pauses, then leaps onto Ira and they roll on the ground for a moment
Ira makes his-way free and gets up
Get the hell off of me you psycho
Drive me home
No
How are you gonna get home then
Fine
- They drive in silence for a moment
You are the most self involved person  have ever met
Oh yeah
133
No matter what the situation, no matter how many laughs or how many women you get you will never be happy
You're always going to be miserable
You are a bottomless pit
bottomless wound
What about you
You are just a lackey
Who are you to judge me
You tried to screw me over, after all
have done for you
am not responsible for you
You wanted me to sit back and destroy this woman's life
Help you cheat on her
You put me in a terrible position
don't give a fuck, go fuck yourself
Lacky
You made me the tacky
'm not a lacky, it's a job
It's not a job, you're a tacky
You're not even that fucking funny
This gets Ira very mad
Who cares
If being funny means being like you,  rather be a little less funny
Mission accomplished
You're the only person  know who learned nothing from a near-death experience
You actually went backwards
All it did was it brought out what a prick you are, brought everything bad to the surface
liked you better when was sure you were gonna die
134
'm not going anywhere
Everything is about you
You don't even know where  live
You've never asked me one question about my life
How much can one person talk about himself
You never ask me shit about anything
Who are you to fucking judge anyone
You're not my friend, you just want my money
You just want to get your foot in the door
Fuck your money
Fuck you
This has all been a huge mistake
Wake me when we get home
George climbs in the back seat and tries to go to bed

'  - Music up: Ted Hawkins' song "Strange Conversation
" Ira drives George home in the dark
Neither one speaks
We see images of different cities going by the window
Ira thinks about all he's been through and the challenges ahead, ' Ira pulls up to his apartment
okay, 'm getting out
You have to drive yourself home
'm getting out here
Why didn't you drive me to my house
Because then 'd still have your car
135
You'll drop it off later
There is no later
'm not going to ever talk to you again
So don't want your car
So that's how it's going to be
' George enters
There is an enormous pile of stuff to do on his dining room table
Several stacks of scripts
One pile has a big post-it note that says: "
" ' George lies alone in bed, alone
Eyes wide open
It's really bright in his room
George hits a button
The shades automatically close
The room goes dark
Now he's in the dark with his eyes open
He turns on the to go to sleep
It's the Today show
It's really happy and morning-themed
The piece on the Today show is very suburban
"How to Clean Up Clutter
" ( ) You know, when you've got a big family, and you've got a lot of clutter
'  -   - Ira is talking to Leo
We rented out your room to Jay
But you can crash on the couch if you want
Oh man, you got jerked off on that couch
136
fucking didn't cum on the couch
Just sleep on it for a month, and then we'll find some excuse to boot Jay out
Thanks
'm sorry,  lost my way for a while
' George reads one from a large pack of scripts
few pages in, he clearly doesn't like it
He puts it down, picks up another one
The large stack is clearly the ones he doesn't like
- Ira writes at a table
- George walks out of a store
beautiful woman tries to chat him up, but he lets her know he i
s"busy and has to go
He walks off
She looks disappointed
- Ira talks to Daisy
They seem to be getting along well
- Daisy is performing on stage
She gets off and heads over to Ira
That was great
She kisses him
Thanks
The  walks over
13,
Hey Ira, Federman got in a car accident
Do you want to take his spot
George walks over with a young comedian of about Ira's age
This young man has clearly taken his place
Hey, how's it going
Hey George
This is Randy
He's funny, you'd like his stuff
It's smart
'm sure  would
look forward to seeing it
Are you going on tonight
hope so
(to George) Do you want to go up
Ira was gonna take Federman's spot, but we can get you up if you want to
No, that's ok
don't want to take Ira's spot
'm just gonna hang out tonight
- Ira is introduced
He walks onto the stage
We see George walk to the very back corner of the club and sit down at a table by himself
On stage Ira does his act
He is much more comfortable than we have ever seen him on stage before
He is no longer searching for his comic identity
He has found a way to be himself on stage, and tells jokes which are more personal than we have seen before
Not everything kills, but when something eats it he does not seem thrown
Sometimes he seems amused
138
He watches from the back of the room
At first he does not laugh, but then slowly starts laughing--but more at the things Ira does in between jokes
We can tell that he is proud of Ira and misses him
-- Ira is back behind the counter, working at the Deli with Chuck and Gail
He doesn't look too unhappy to be there
Is the potato salad fresh
made it myself this morning
Is it good
stake my reputation on it
Okay
Give me a quart
Mrs
Gail, this fine woman would like a quarf'of potato salad
The woman moves to the other side of the counter
We reveal George standing there, holding his ticket
Do you have any turkey that's hormone-free
Yes we do
So this is where you work
Back in the saddle
thought we were writing a screenplay
139
Well, you're not a very good writing partner
Or any kind of partner
You want to make me a turkey sandwich and talk to me
They give you breaks around here
- There is a small seating area in the supermarket where people eat food at the deli counter
George and Ira sit across from each other
In my travels,  have learned a lot about Asia and Buddhism
And would like to be in the moment now with you, and to tell you how sorry am, and how much  have appreciated your friendship
And even if we are not friends in the future,  wish you well on your journey
Ira laughs
That guy was a douche-bag
But also kind of cool
It's a very weird combination
He was going to heal you with those herbs, man
You get sick again, you should call that guy
think most of what you said to me was true
And  really am sorry
think 'm still not very healthy
in my brain
It's all right, man
You've been through a lot
14 0
Well,  appreciate you trying to help me
Even though it was kind of an impossible task
Is everything going okay
How are you doing
am not doing well, but things have certainly been worse
So, will be fine
() You were good the other night hear you're getting regular spots now
'm actually going up tonight
Really
Any new jokes you're working on
Yeah, 've been trying to get off my ass and do some writing
What do you got
Ira is surprised to hear him ask this, since he has never asked this before
was thinking about doing a bit about how 'm not very good looking, but 'm not bad looking, but 'm just good-looking enough that if  had a good personality, it might put me over the top
You should do something about how, when you date a girl, and you feel really good and she likes you, and then you see pictures of all her ex- boyfriends, and they're all really goofy-looking guys, and it's not that you're good looking, it's just that in this psychotic girl's eyes, you're good looking
141, And how all of her boyfriends look like Lou Costello
Why don't you say Dom Deluise
it's a more current reference
More current
What year was Cannonball Run, 1978
Okay, okay
What else you got
was going to talk about how haven't had sex in so long, that can't even remember my previous sexual experiences so  can masturbate to them
You should say, now when masturbate,  have to think about the last time  masturbated
That's a good one
You can write
You know,  always wanted to be part of the comedy field
As the camera pulls back, George continues to pitch Ira jokes for his act, the first selfless act we've seen him commit in the entire film
As their friendship rekindles, we
