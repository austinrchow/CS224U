Written by Tom McCarthy -
It's a bitter cold January morning
The woods are quiet
Desolate
In the far off distance a man is jogging
He banks around the end of a small pond and runs right at us
This is , -
He is running hard
Or at least as hard as he can
Suddenly   blow past him
,  -
hangs on a window
It falls to the ground
, - , stirs and gets out of her bed out
She picks up the Bird and inspects it
It's broken
Shit
,  -
, - is still sleeping
Abby walks into the room
Jackie opens her eyes
() Mommy, can we play croquet today
Jackie lifts Abby onto the bed
(') Where's Daddy
He's running
From what
Jackie smiles
' ,  -
,    is standing up in her crib crying
Mike comes in and picks her up
Hi there
5/15/10 -    -   2 ' ,  -
Jackie prepares some food
She knocks a glass over into the sink and it breaks
Shit
She looks over at Abby who is immersed in her coloring
Then she sets the food down in front of Stella who is sitting in a high chair
Mike enters wearing a suit and tie
(') How was the run
Good
It was good
Abby, finish your cereal
(') ( ) 'm very impressed with you keeping it up
Mike shrugs and takes a yogurt from the refrigerator
don't like it
You do too, so stop drawing and eat
What brand is this
Daddy, look
It's your team
(') They're all the same
Mike looks at the drawing
It looks nothing like a team
That's my team
That's great, honey
Are they winning
Yeah
Maybe you should show the team
5/15/10 -    -   3 : Abby knocks over a glass of water
It spills onto the drawing
Shit
Honey, you can't use that word
It's a bad word
Off Mike's look
(') What
Don't look at me
Uh huh
Bye sweetie
He kisses Abby
Bye daddy
Bye
Hey
You
Yeah
You sure
Yeah
'm good
Why
Just checking
Bye guy's
Can  have more juice
Mike leaves
Jackie is not convinced
Just a minute
5/15/10 -    -   4 '  -
Mike walks outside toward his car
He opens the car door
Mike
Mike turns
Jackie is standing at the door
(') Did you call Fenn about the tree
No
will today
Please do
don't want it coming down on the house
Mike looks at a    in the side yard
Yeah
You're right
will
Mike
Yeah
love you
love you too, sweetie
Bye
Jackie shuts the door
Mike looks up at the tree
(') Shit
'  -
Mike pays for his coffee and bagel and starts to leave
He nods to a group of    who wave him over
He tries to keep moving but they continue to engage him
Finally he joins the table
The group shares a laugh
5/15/10 -    -   5 '  -
Mike's car pulls into a driveway of an   that has been converted into
on the lawn reads: "
, " and " , " ' ,   -
Mike parks his car as a  walks up from the basement of the house and gets into his  and pulls away
Mike gets out of his car and walks toward the back door carrying his briefcase
He stops at the basement steps
Vig
Down here
Mike walks down the stairs
' ,  -
It's an old, musty basement filled with endless shelves of files
What's up, Vig
Donna's out sick and can't find anything without her
It sucks
, , emerges carrying some files
Who was that guy
Oh, that sucks more
He's the plumber
called him to look at that piece of crap of boiler
Vigman points to an
Why
5/15/10 -    -   6 : That clanking is driving me nuts
Can't you hear it down in your office
Yeah
just figured it's old
Well it is but he took one look at it and said we should replace it before it blows
What
We just had it fixed three months ago
Yeah, he said that job was crap
The guy did crap work
Can you believe that
That little scumbag
Jesus
All they care about is getting paid
Makes me sick
No one wants to do the work anymore
How much to fix it, Vig
Did he say
Six grand to replace everything
Holy shit
Tell me about it
gotta be honest, Mike, it's not a good time for me
My business is off and my step son wants to get Lasik
Really
Isn't he too young
don't really care at this point
If it makes him happy, he can have it
get nothing from that kid
() 5/15/10 -    -   7 : (') Nothing
He has an unnatural attachment to his father
Right
So what do you want to do
Well  was thinking we could leave it for now and just cover the file cabinets in plastic to be safe
How about you
Yeah
guess 'm good with that
The boiler barks
They both jump
Let's get out of here before it blows
'll pick some up plastic before practice
They both hurry back up the stairs
'  - Mike walks into his office
, the receptionist, is at her computer working
She's mid-20s and pure Jersey
Hey Shelly, How you doing
'm a little hung over and my boyfriend's a moron
Oh
Sorry to hear that
How'd the team do last night
We lost
Bummer
Your noon canceled so you just have a 10:30 and 3pm
Anything else
5/15/10 -    -   8 : The toilet isn't flushing again
Should  just call someone this time
No
'll take a look at it
Who do have at ten-thirty
() Frank
Great
'  -
Mike is sitting with , an elderly man, jotting notes
And you think your son stole it
Yeah
know he did
Why would he steal your cat, Frank
He's jealous of her
Very jealous
'  - Mike is on his phone as he cleans his keyboard
understand but that's my fee for that particular service
Uh huh
Right
Well maybe  can adjust that a little bit
'  - Mike is eating lunch at his desk
He hears a noise and looks out the back window and see's Vigman pulling a out of the trunk of his car
5/15/10 -    -   9 ' ,  - Mike, on his knees, plunges the broken toilet
'  - Mike is sitting with  , 82 and his   , , - and
Well Leo, remember you got lost and the police had to help you a few times
That's why we brought Jolie into help you, right
So now what happens
Well if that Judge deems you incapacitated then you will need a guardian
And if we can't find your daughter then the state
She can't find herself
but if we can't find her then the State will have to become your guardian
Who's the state
You know
the state
of New Jersey
That's crazy
don't need New Jersey's help
got Jolie now
And there's no funny business between us so you know
Right
'm sure there's not
Let's just first see if we can find your daughter and then we'll go from there
5/15/10 -    -   10 '
flips through some
The boiler sounds off
She jumps
She picks up the documents and walks into Mike's office setting the documents down
Am  still hung over or is that noise getting louder
You're probably still hung over
What's that
Leo's financial statements
He's loaded, huh
Yes, he is
You find his daughter
No
That lady is gone and doesn't want to be found
Crap
Mike takes the  and puts them in '
Can't the state just leave him in his home
That's what the guy wants
They could but they never will
It's too much work
They'll probably move him into Oak Knoll
Hand me one of their brochures
Shelly grabs an    from a stack
But he has Jolie now
She can handle it
No, she can't
His guardian still has to make every single decision
It's the difference between a baby sitter and a parent
5/15/10 -    -   11 : She hands it to Mike who takes it and paper clips in on the inside of Leo's file
wish  could do it
could use an extra 1,500 bucks a month
$1,500
Is that what it is
Yeah
It's in his file
(Answering the phone) Mike Flaherty's office
Mike opens Leo's file
,   -
Mike and Vigman are coaching wrestling practice at the public highschool
They are in the small, dingy back gym just off the main gymnasium
This is a no-frills program
The team of 12  are doing a spinning drill
Vigman holds up a singlet
Whose singlet is this
What did say about leaving them around
runs over and Vig flings it at him
-
Mike and   are running
Terry is the same age as Mike but dressed in a better gear
They are both breathing hard
How's the team doing
Not good
What the hell happened
We used to be good
Yeah, well we're not anymore
5/15/10 -    -   12 : Can we walk for a bit
Yeah
They both stop
Terry is completely winded
That sucked
You're running good, buddy
Kicking my ass
Terry's blackberry beeps
He takes it out and reads it
Yeah
've been getting out here a bit more often
You gotta be kidding me
What
Lori's texting me at seven in the morning to ask me if  want an antique sewing table that we bought together
Do you
No
want my fucking house back
Is she still with that guy
You mean my contractor
The guy hired
Yeah, she is
can just picture that little scumbag walking around my house wearing his tool belt
Here
He hands Mike his blackberry
(') Take a picture for me
Terry pulls down his pants and moons Mike
5/15/10 -    -   13 : Take it
Jesus, Ter
(') Hurry
It's cold
Mike takes the picture
Terry takes the blackberry back
Don't send it
Too late
hate her
They start to walk
Maybe you should move back into the city
Get a new job
Shake it up a bit
Nah
Finley called me
He's starting up a new fund out here in May so 'm gonna wait for that
That guy's starting another fund
Yeah
He's an animal
He prints money
Come on, let's finish strong
Terry starts to run
Mike follows
After about thirty feet, Mike pulls up
He's breathing is labored
Hold up
What
Just
hold up
Mike is really breathing hard now
He's making some funny noises
You alright
Mike just holds up a hand
He can't really speak
5/15/10 -    -   14 : (') Mike, what the fuck
What's (Barely audible) wrong
Yeah
Fine
just
He drops to a knee
He's not alright
(') Holy fuck
Mike
Hang on pal
Terry takes out his black berry but immediately fumbles it into the wet mud
(') Fuck
Fuck
He grabs it and shakes it out but it's dead
(') You gotta be kidding me
Shit
Mike is still wheezing
Terry turns his attention
(') Is it your heart, buddy
Are you having a heart attack
No
'm not having a heart attack
just
can't breathe
That could be a heart attack, Mike
You should lie down
Terry tries to help him but it's only seems to annoy Mike
Get off me
Just lie down
No
It's wet
don't want to lie down
Who cares
You might be dying
Are you cold
Do you feel cold
Yeah
'm lying on the ground
Look into my eyes, Mike
Look into my eyes
5/15/10 -    -   15 : They are now engaged in a weird wrestling match
(
) Are you alright
Terry looks to see      in jogging gear staring at them
- An ambulance pulls away revealing Mike and Terry sitting in the open back of Terry's
dude, how long has that been happening
Couple of months
The doctor says it's stress
Seriously
Did he prescribe anything for you
Yeah
Jogging
Why the hell you think 'm doing this
Jesus
That scared the shit out of me
What are you so stressed about, Mike
() don't know
Work
Money
Everything
Is it that bad
Yeah
It is
don't know how much longer  can keep my practice going
Really
Holy shit, Mike
What're you gonna do
5/15/10 -    -   16 : have no frickin' idea
've been trying everything
Have you told Jackie
Not yet
don't want to freak her out
Good call
So we just need a new strategy, that's all
What about that Judge that's always throwing work your way
Can't she help you out
Judge Lee, yeah
If it wasn't for her 'd probably be out of business already
just need more
Is there anything else you can do for money
What the hell am  gonna do
Bartend
'm a lawyer, Ter practice law
(') And it's not like 'm some  know
scumbag
help old people for Christ sake
No offense but your pal, Finley doesn't give a crap about anything but making money
Yeah
But that's why he makes it
No shit, Ter
Thanks for the update
'  - The office is dark aside from Mike's desk light
Shelly is gone
Mike's blackberry rings
5/15/10 -    -   17 : Hi, honey
'm still at the office
Yeah
came back after practice, 'll be home in a bit
(Checking his blackberry) Oh, hey, let me go, Jack
've been waiting for this call

Mike hangs up the phone and answers his blackberry
(') Hey Tom

It's been a slow month on this end and  was
Mike listens
The news from Dunleavy isn't good
(') Oh
No, yeah of course appreciate that
Thanks, Tom
Bye
Mike hangs up the phone and sits at his desk
After a moment, he slams his hand on the desk
And then something catches his eye
It's  '
He opens the file and see's the He flips through the file and lands on a particular page and a particular line item
Monthly Commission: $1,508
00
- Mike walks with Leo Poplar up the steps of the courthouse
,   -
Leo walks through the metal detector
Mike watches him and then walks through himself but something beeps
The guards stops Mike
Leo starts to wander away
Hey, Leo
Leo hold on
(to the Guard) Can you stop him, please
,  -
It's a very drab, no frills courtroom
is seated on the bench looking over some documents
5/15/10 -    -   18 : Mike is sitting next Leo
Seated at the next table is ,
Mike is tapping his pen
Any word from his daughter
Mr
Flaherty
Oh
no, Your Honor
have the two certified letters returned unclaimed
And there is no phone number for her
We can't find her
And she is the only living family, is that correct
Yes, your Honor, she is
But Mr
Poplar hasn't seen her for over twenty years
Who
Your daughter
She's late
She's probably at the store buying some crap or something
Mike turns back to the Judge and shrugs
, then as, Mr
Poplar has been deemed incapacitated by this court, 'm appointing the Office of Public Guardian to serve as the guardian for his person and property
Do you have the order for me to sign, Mr
Thatcher
Yes,  do, Your Honor
Then please approach
5/15/10 -    -   19 : Thatcher stands and takes out the order
Mike's wheels are spinning
He seizes his moment
Your Honor, if it pleases the Court
Yes, Mr
Flaherty
would be willing to serve as Mr
Poplar's guardian
(Stopping
) Really
Yeah
How long have you known him
Two weeks
Mike is suddenly put on the spot
More like five
Really
And now you want to be his guardian
Mike looks at Leo and the Judge
May  approach, your honor
Council approach
Mike collects himself and approaches
(') What's going on Mike
Well Judge,  think 'd be a better candidate then the state in this case
5/15/10 -    -   20 : Really
Yeah, and stop saying really, it's annoying
raises in eyebrow
(') Your Honor,  live in the Proximity hardly qualifies same town as Mr
Poplar
him as a guardian, Your Honor
(') And, as his lawyer,  feel like 'm in a better position to execute what my client wants
Your Honor, Mr
Flaherty is Mr
Poplar's court appointed attorney
know, Stu,  appointed him
Yeah, well that hardly qualifies him to be Leo's Guardian
What's the motivation here
Thatcher is turning up the heat
He obviously wants Poplar
Mike is starting to feel it
Mike
Mike looks back at Leo who is trying to unscrew the cap on his water bottle, completely uninterested in the proceedings
He makes a decision
Your Honor, Leo told me he wants to live at home
He has the money to do that and  want to make sure that happens
If the State can do that then fine
Counsel knows we can't do that, your Honor
() 5/15/10 -    -   21 : (') We're spread too thin for that kind of individual attention
But they have an excellent elder care facility in Mr
Poplar's town
We'll put him there
Mr
Poplar wants to live at home
( ) You can do that, Mike
Yes,  can
( ) Really
Leo is putting papers in his briefcase
Mike sits down next to him
Did we win
Yeah
think so
Good
'  -
Mike walks toward his car carrying
He puts it into the back of his car which is packed with  from Leo's house
'  -
Mike and Leo are driving
Are we going to the park
No
We're not, Leo
'm gonna help you get settled into a new place to live right here in town
don't need a new place
have a house
'm not fancy that way
5/15/10 -    -   22 : know
But  need you to stay in this new place for a while
It's nice
You'll like it
Is that what the judge said
Yeah, that's what he said
Leo considers the news and looks out the window
Ah shit
-
Mike and Leo arrive at Oak Knoll
,   -
It is a nice place
Mike sits on a small couch filling out paperwork as a    helps to prepare Leo's room
-
Mike pulls up and walks into the Convenience Store
He buys cigarettes and walks outside
He walks outside, around the corner and then behind the store
He lights a cigarette and then throws the pack into the dumpster
He stands there smoking

Abby deposits into the basket and looks up at Mike
He smiles
-
Jackie and Stella are waiting in the parking lot
Mike is lagging behind carrying Abby and chatting with some '
He's charming and he's working it
He finally catches up with Jackie and they walk toward the car
5/15/10 -    -   23 : Let's go, Mr
Mayor
It's cold and need to pick up some bagels for your mom's

Where

No,  mean why are you doing it
() What
Oh, because 'm his guardian
What
Since when
Just last week
Mommy,  want a bagel
(') That's a big deal, Mike
Were you even gonna tell me
It's not a big deal
And yes, It is too
was gonna tell you
(') You don't have time to be taking care of some old man
5/15/10 -    -   24 : Jack, he's in Oak Knoll
They do everything
just have to check in on him from time to time
And who pays for that
He does
It comes out of his estate and he can afford it
Trust me
don't get it
You've never done it before
No  haven't
So why are you doing it now
It's just
the right thing to do, alright
We couldn't find his daughter and 'm just trying to help the guy
It's really not a big deal
Well, it sounds like a big deal
And you should have told me
What's a big deal
Ask your daddy, sweetie
Maybe he'll tell you
Daddy, what's a big deal
'  - Mike pulls up to Leo's house
It's a small house in a working class section of town

Is that his house
5/15/10 -    -   25 : Yeah
(Re: the Young Man) Who's that
No idea
Mike gets out of the car
'  - Mike walks up the front walk
The   is listening to his Ipod and smoking a cigarette

The   removes his headphones
He has a  on his left eye
How you doing
Can  help you
No
Are you looking for Mr
Poplar
Yeah
Well, he doesn't live here anymore
Where does he live
You mind telling me why you're looking for him first
The Young Man sizes Mike up
Then
He's my Grandfather
came to live with him
Mike is momentarily stunned by the news
Then he looks back at the car where Jackie gives him a "What's going on
" look
Uh oh
5/15/10 -    -   26 '  - Mike is driving
The Young Man is in the back seat next to Abby and Stella
So do you live around here, Kyle
No

Jackie looks at Mike who tries to avoid her piercing gaze
Ohio
And where are your parents
It's just my mother and me
She's back in Columbus
She couldn't come
So how did you get here
Bus
Really
All by yourself
Yeah
Wow
That sounds like a big deal
Jackie looks at Mike
From the mouths of babes
,  - Mike knocks on Leo's door
After a moment, Leo opens it
Hey, Leo, you have a visitor
Who
Him
5/15/10 -    -   27 : Yeah

He doesn't recognize him
This is Kyle Timmons, Leo
He's your grandson

Kyle looks to Mike, unsure of what to say
Kyle's just here for a visit, Leo
Oh

Kyle joins him
So 'll come back to pick you up in an hour
You
Yeah

So did you call his mother
No
Not yet
Oh and he was smoking too

What are you going to do with him
We're going to send him back is what we're going to do
Well  hope so
You have your hands full over there
And now taking care of that old man too
That sounds like a lot, Mike
Thank you, Gina
agree
He somehow forgot to tell me about it

Not until  asked
His daughter should be taking care of him
Not you
You have me to worry about
don't have to worry about him
He's at Oak Knoll
5/15/10 -    -   29 : Daddy

The whole thing just sounds crazy
It is crazy
It's crazy
( ) Who's crazy
Me
- Mike and Kyle exit he building and walk toward the parking lot
How did the visit go
He fell asleep watching
So he lives there now
Yeah
Your grandfather is in the early stages of dementia, Kyle
So sometimes he does things and says things that don't make sense
Are you a friend of his or something
'm his guardian
What's that mean
It means  make sure he's well taken care of
That's cool
Kyle lights a cigarette
5/15/10 -    -   30 '  ' ,  -
Kyle's is fiddling with '
Jackie walks downstairs
Everything alright
Yeah
Did you reach your mom

No
Well, 'm sorry you can't stay longer but maybe you can come back with your mom and visit again
Yeah
If  want to smoke should go outside
You shouldn't be smoking

But if  do
Jackie decides not to engage
Yeah
You should go outside
Good night, Jackie
Good night, Kyle
Jackie nods and leaves
5/15/10 -    -   31 ' ,  -
Mike is leaning against the counter eating ice cream
Jackie emerges from the stairs, shuts basement door behind her and slides a dead bolt locking it
What are you doing
We have kids, Mike
'm not taking any chances with Eminem down there
There's not even a bathroom down there
Jackie thinks about this and then unlocks the door in a huff and walks up stairs
,   -
Mike and Kyle are sitting with Leo who is eating breakfast
Hey Mike, could you talk to them about getting Coco Puffs
like that kind
Sure thing, Leo
( ) Mike's a stand up guy
You need cereal then talk to him

Kyle fastens his seat belt
So you want to tell me what happened

Kyle looks at Mike
(') You'll see
'  -
Jackie is waiting
Kyle is on the hot seat
Mike is watching
Kyle
Kyle can barely look at her

Is there a reason you don't want to go home
Kyle remains silent
(') What happened to your eye, Kyle
Kyle shifts
Avoiding

You can trust us
Kyle looks up at them
Trust is obviously an issue

With your Mom
Did she do that to your eye
No
She's not even there
She's in a clinic or hospital or whatever
'm living with Craig
Who's Craig
5/15/10 -    -   35 : Her boyfriend,  guess, but he's an asshole
Does she even know you're here
My mom
She doesn't care about me
How do you know
She's probably worried sick and just doesn't know how to reach you
Kyle reaches into his pocket and takes out his cell phone
She could've called, right
The sincerity of his question is heartbreaking and Jackie is cut to the quick
She looks at Mike
Brutal
'  -
Kyle is sitting on the back steps and smoking a cigarette
'  ' ,  -
Mike is sitting up in bed
His wheels are spinning
(
) We don't have a choice now
So what are we gonna do
Adopt him
Jackie walks into the room putting on face moisturizer
No
But 'm not sending him back until  talk to his mother
She better freaking call me back
Honey,  know it's tough but we're not in a position to take care of another kid right now
She gets in the bed
5/15/10 -    -   36 : don't care
'm not sending him back there, Mike
can't
And for the record, 'm not very happy about it either
Then we don't have to do this
Yes, we do, Mike
We do
It makes me so angry and so damn sad to see that poor kid in that kind of situation
He's just a kid
Jackie starts to break
Mike buckles
know

You're right
just want to go to Ohio and
beat the crap out of his mom
Come on
do
want to beat the crap out of her and her stupid boyfriend
'm serious

Well it feels like it

Mike is sitting at his desk
5/15/10 -    -   38 : He's sitting in my waiting room
Jackie made me take him with me
(
) Alright, listen pal, this is not the time to long that stock, you know what  mean
No
What does that mean
It means you shouldn't be taking care of another kid
Especially a convict
( ) Yeah, well
Shelly pops her head in
found her
Mike spins in his chair
Let me call you back
(
) Fine
But get rid of the convict, Mike
Mike hangs up
She's in a drug treatment program in Columbus
She has five weeks to go
Jesus

They said she would call you
Mike shakes his head
Nothing is easy here

Hey, Rew, what are you doing
Coach, can you get on Pill
Get up, Rew

5/15/10 -    -   40 : Everyone watch because none of you are doing it right
You want to put your chest into his side
Vig does it but he's a bit off
(') Just slide back a bit, Vig
bit more
Yeah
Right there
Then you give him your full weight
Go ahead Vig
Vig does
Pill starts to buckle
Vig is big
(') Then you ride the crotch and break him down with a cross-face
Vigman grabs Pill under the crotch, applies a stiff cross- face and then drives him hard to the mat
Another Wrestler, chimes in
Stemler is wearing a   t-shirt
Oh man, how'd that feel, Pill
We'll just call you "pancake"
Stemler's a bit off
Shut up, Chewbaka
Yeah, right
More like the "Secret Apprentice"
What are you, ten years old, Stemler
Mike loses it
Hey
We're trying to teach you guys something and you're all just goofing off
Shut up
Quiet
Last time  checked we haven't won a match
Right coach
5/15/10 -    -   41 : It's embarrassing, guys
It's embarrassing
But you're all acting like you don't care
Well, 'm not getting paid enough to just jerk around here

So does coach Vig, and so should you
Run em, Coach

Mike, Jackie, Abby and Kyle are eating dinner together
Abby is coloring
Mike watches Kyle as he finishes his big glass of milk
Here, have some more corn
She gives him the bowl of corn
(') 'll get you some more milk too
Kyle finishes off the corn
Jackie gets up for the milk

And Jackie is gone
( ) Do you want to play croquet
Now

Yeah, maybe
Mike gets up and begins to load the dishwasher
Daddy, can  watch
Uh

Abby leaves
Kyle turns to Mike
Hey Mike, you think  could practice with you guys tomorrow
Yeah, if you want
Sure
And by the way, what  did in there today, yelling like that

You were right, they deserved it
5/15/10 -    -   43 ,   -
Mike and Kyle are walking into the gym

Kyle nods and walks over to Carlos and Jimmy
(') Let's go
Ten seconds to get an ankle
Then we switch it up
Ready

Mike checks his watch
Then blows his whistle
Time

And

5/15/10 -    -   44 : Mike blows his whistle again and Kyle goes on the offensive
He gives Carlos a quick head fake and before Carlos knows what's happened, Kyle has grabbed his ankle and tripped him down to the mat
Carlos looks shocked
Kyle pops back up but stays focused on Carlos
Mike looks to Vigman who raises an eyebrow, impressed
One thing is certain, Kyle can wrestle
-
Kyle and Mike are walking toward the car
You have fun
Yeah
When's the last time you wrestled
couple years ago
Why'd you stop
Just felt like it
Kyle just shrugs and Mike let's it go
They arrive at Mike's car and Mike talks to Kyle over the roof
So let me ask you something, Kyle
How good are you
Kyle just looks at Mike, almost blank
'm pretty good
' , '   -
Mike is looking at his computer screen
Holy shit
5/15/10 -    -   45 '  -
Mike runs inside
It's a sparsely furnished bachelor pad with all the toys
(
) You check out that link  sent you
(
) Yeah
Kyle Timmons
That's the kid
(
) Yeah
That's the kid
Holy shit

Can you believe that
Terry is in the den at his computer, reading excitedly
Holy shit
He was thirty-five and one as a freshman
know
He finished second at the states
In Ohio
Mike walks into the kitchen and grabs a beer
This kid had seventeen pins
He's a killer
know
It's nuts
And he quit after his freshman year
Why
don't know
He doesn't talk much
He's kind of a weird kid
Why can't  have one kid like that on my team
Just one
5/15/10 -    -   46 : What're you talking about
You do
You have him
You can take this kid to the states, Mike
He's not on the team, Ter
He's not even a student
He's been here for three days
So what
Enroll him
'm not enrolling him
He's just here until we reach his mother and figure this out
So he's gotta do something, right
Let him wrestle
Look at this way, you're helping out the old man and this kid's a little bonus for doing the right thing
'm not just helping out the old man, Ter
It's not like it's charity work
'm getting paid for it
No
Shit, everyone gets paid, but think about it, Mike
What are the chances that this kid ends up on your door step and he can wrestle like that
It's a sign, pal
This lands with Mike
Terry sits down at his computer
(') Check this out
There's a video link of him wrestling in some tournament
Terry presses play
It's grainy and amateur but good enough
Mike looks on
(') Look at that kid
Mike gets sucked in
5/15/10 -    -   47 : Wow
He's gonna throw him
Look, he's setting him up
He's setting him up
Mike and Terry explode
They high five and hug
' ,  -
Kyle is standing, waiting
Jackie walks out with her purse
Here's five dollars for lunch have no idea what it costs but let me know when you find out

Good for you
Save it
Now take this, it's too early to argue
Kyle takes it
Mike arrives
Let's go, pal
Bye Jackie
Kyle leaves
Mike kisses Jackie
(') Hey, you sure we should do this
Why not
Whether he's here for two more days or two weeks it gives him something to do all day
Unless you want him hanging out here
Go
,   -
Mike and Kyle are waiting
After a moment,  , , emerges from his office and greets them
They all walk into his office
5/15/10 -    -   48 '  -
Mike is working at his desk
Shelly opens the door
Hey Mike, we got a check from Leo Poplar's trust for $1,500 but it's made out to you and not the firm
Right
'll take that
Mike gets up and takes the check
Shouldn't  deposit it in the business account
No
It's not a legal fee
It's a personal fee
For what
He puts on his coat
Oh,  ended up taking on Leo's guardianship
() Really
Yeah,  thought  mentioned that to you
No, you definitely didn't mention that
Yeah, well, it just played out that way
have to get going
He turns off his computer
Well can we put some of that in the business account so they don't take our copier back
5/15/10 -    -   49 : Uh
not this time
Next month
Promise
He grabs his briefcase and leaves
We need our copier, Mike
know
Bye Shelly
And that noise is getting louder

Jimmy locks again but Kyle pushes him away again
Jimmy comes in hard this time and Kyle uses his momentum to quickly throw him to the ground
Jimmy tries to scramble to his knees but Kyle is all over him
He quickly locks Jimmy in a cradle and rocks him onto his back
It looks easy
Vigman calls the pin
The room is quiet
except for Terry
Wow
Mike shoots Terry a look
Kyle helps Jimmy off the mat
Good match
Didn't feel good
Vigman turns to Mike and Terry
don't think we can teach him anything
5/15/10 -    -   53 '  -
Mike, Terry, Kyle, Jackie and the kids are eating pizza
don't know why we didn't quit
Just the smell of that room brought back the memories
hated it, it was like a form of self-abuse
Were you guys that bad
Mike was average
sucked
Sorry Abby
It's
Mike checks his watch
gotta stop by the office and deal with the computer
Should
No, 'll take him
We both should have quit
Then we could have joined the ski club and gotten busy with Allison Shepard on the overnights
Hey
Yo
Terry
Who was busy
Your Uncle Terry is just silly
Sorry Abby
Getting busy is bad
Kyle cracks up
Terry catches his eye
5/15/10 -    -   54 '  -

Together

The kid has man strength, dude
Mike emerges from under the desk
Man strength
Yeah
You know

Especially compared to Vig
How are you value added
Well first of all 'm fun
No denying that
And secondly, unlike Vig,  actually used to wrestle
Yeah, but Ter, you sucked
That doesn't matter, your team sucks
Plus  even look more like a coach then Vig
Yeah, that's not really value added
Look, Mike, 'm serious here need some distraction in my life right now
All  do is sit in my condo and think about Lori and that guy having sex in the jacuzzi paid for

These guys are ranked fourth in the state
And you're wrestling Kenny Randall

Really tough
Thanks for letting me know
Vigman stands up at the front of the bus
Hey

Shut up, Stemler
Or 'll throw you off the bus myself
Vigman sits back down next to Terry

But you have an advantage here, he has no idea who you are, right
() 5/15/10 -    -   70 : (') So he's gonna be overconfident

Hurt like hell

You got a problem with that
No  do not
That was fun today
You're good
'm glad you started wrestling again
Yeah
Me too

Can  tell you something
Of course

Why

What
You're don't even drive
Yeah
That was part of the problem
Who's car did you steal
teacher's
Oh my God
It was really stupid
Yeah
It was stupid
You could have killed yourself
Yeah
Everything just got messed up after that
Yeah, well we all do stupid things
But the best part is that you got a another chance and now you're kicking butt
5/15/10 -    -   73 : guess
It's true
And you know who would agree with me
Mike
Jackie lifts her leg
Nope
Jackie lifts her leg exposing her tatoo
Kyle smiles
,   -
The Pioneers race out onto the mat to do warm-ups before a home match
They are fired up
There are more fans in the stands
Terry and Vig bob their head to the music
Kyle looks up at Jackie, Shelly and kids who are also rocking out in the stands
-
Kyle and Jackie walk through a park with Leo
,  -
The wrestling team sprints through the empty hallways
'  -
Kyle and Stemler are battling it out on the Wii
Stemler is wearing a helmet
'  ' ,  -
Mike pours himself some coffee
Jackie is feeding the kids
The basement door opens and Kyle walks out followed by Feeney, Jimmy, Carlos, and Stemler
They are all sweating profusely
Mike is about to sip his coffee when Terry walks out
He nods and follows the gang
5/15/10 -    -   74 '  '  -
Terry and Kyle stand side by side holding onto two ropes
Mike is cutting down the dead tree with a chain saw
Jackie Abby watch from the front porch
Mike finishes cutting and Terry and Kyle pull the tree over
Success
Mike lifts his arms in triumph
,   -
Mike, Vigman and Terry are preparing for the match
They don't have anyone at heavyweight
Really
Korsic will be happy
Tell him now so he doesn't puke
Why does he puke
He's a heavyweight
He doesn't have to lose weight
Nerves
Sweet Lord
This is a team for the ages
Kyle knocks on the door
Stemler is with him
What's up, guys
Stemler wants to wrestle today
You do
Yeah, Coach
'm pretty sure 'm ready
Right
Right
Where you gonna wrestle
5/15/10 -    -   75 : He could wrestle 119
could bump up and get a pin at 125 and Jimmy goes 130
Then we're only giving up one weight class and we got a shot
Vig and Terry look at Mike
Huh
Vig
Yeah
He's right
It's possible
Have you ever wrestled in a match before Stemler
No,  have not
You're just waiting for the green light, right
Right
think now is my time can feel the force
The three coaches all look at each other
,   -
Terry holds up a    with weight classes written on them
The    selects a stick and reads the weight
One twenty-five
Vigman reads off the roster
We start at 125 pounds
Depasquale and Timmons
We'll finish at 119 pounds
Tomlinson and Stemler
(
) 'm ready Coach
The Coaches all turn to see Stemler already wearing his singlet and headgear
5/15/10 -    -   76 : (') Show time
Thanks for the update Stemler
We're dead
No
It's gonna be fine
,   -
The   reads 33- 31
The 112 pound weight class is wrestling
Hook the arm
Carlos, hook the arm
Carlos does and holds on for the win
The team cheers
Mike turns to Vigman and Terry
(') How we doing
With that win, we're up by five
If Stemler doesn't get pinned, we win
That's a huge fucking "if"
(
) can hear you, Coach
They all turn
Stemler is standing right there
He looks petrified
Good job, Ter
Sorry, Stemler
You're a champ
Come here, Stemler
Mike takes Stemler by the shoulders
5/15/10 -    -   77 : (') You've been practicing for a long time
You're ready for this
You hear me
Stemler nods
(') If you get in trouble out there, you just listen to me
'm right here,
Stemler nods again
Too scared to respond
(') You are not going to get pinned
You hear me
No way
( ) No way
No way
Good
Now 'm going to slap you
Ready
Yeah but not so hard
Mike gives him an odd half-slap and Stemler runs out to the mat and takes his place at the line
The team cheers
But then the other  runs out
He is wearing a Stemler spins away from the line and looks pleading at Mike
(') Holy shit
It's Darth Vader
Are you kidding me
No way
He does look like Darth Vader
But in a singlet
// Don't worry
It's just a mask
You are ready
Get on that line
Now
Hey, Stemler
Come here
Stemler walks over
5/15/10 -    -   78 : (') If he's Darth Vader then you're the Secret Apprentice
You got this
Stemler buys it
Yeah
You're right
Stemler returns to the line slightly more confident
The Ref blows the whistle and the match starts
Stemler is immediately taken down
Terry looks at his feet
can't watch
- It's late in third period
Stemler is losing 13-0
Stemler is flat on his belly and he's getting mauled
The Ref calls him for stalling
One point
14-0
Thirty seconds to go
Keep moving, Stemler
Keep working
(Reading score card) Oh shit
Oh shit
What
He's one point away from a tech fall and we'd lose on criteria
Shit
Really
What the hell does that mean
If he falls behind by fifteen points it's a technical fall
They get five team points
If that happens the score would be tied but we'd lose the match on criteria
Seriously
5/15/10 -    -   79 : Fuck this
Mike drops to the mat
(') Stemler
Stemler
Stemler looks over
His eyes are wild
(') You need to get up
He's trying to drown you
He wants you dead
But you are not going to die on the bottom
Do you hear me
Do you
Stemler manages a nod, albeit a terrified one
(') Good
Now just do the move we worked on in practice
Off Stemler's confused look
(') "Whatever the fuck it takes
" Stemler almost manages a smile and then he hits "the move"
It's not pretty but somehow he manages to get up and out
The team goes nuts
One point for Stemler
15-1
The Other kid frantically tries to take him down but Stemler holds him off dancing wildly around the mat
The buzzer sounds
The team goes nuts
The Ref raises the other wrestler's hand in victory but it's Stemler who celebrates as if he just won the states
He runs off the mat and into the arms of his teammates
,  -
Mike and Kyle walk through the empty hallway
Hey, 'm proud of what you did today
That win meant a lot to the guys
Cool
It was good coaching with Stemler
5/15/10 -    -   80 : Mike laughs
Then he just looks at Kyle
Let me ask you something
What's it like
Being as good as you are
What's it feel like
don't know
guess it just feels like 'm in control
Of everything
You know what  mean
Yeah,  do
Must be nice
It is
- The
Kyle is ahead in points going into the second period
He chooses the top position
The Ref blows the whistle and the   sits out and Kyle simply sucks him onto his back
It almost looks too easy
That's it
Yeah
District champ, baby
Pure fucking poetry
The Ref slaps the mat and it's over
-
Kyle walks into Leo's room
Hey, Leo
Guess who won the Districts
Who
5/15/10 -    -   81 : Me
And Mike said he got a call from a college scout about me
Oh
(
) Hi baby
-    standing in the door way
This is
Kyle's mother
What are you doing here
came to get you, honey
And to see Grandpa
missed you so much
Can  have a hug, baby
Kyle looks at Leo who just shrugs
Finally, he walks toward her but then veers away and runs from the room
Where's he going
Oh, he's just had to go somewhere, Dad
Do you want some juice
' ,   -
Mike is watching Stella who is playing on the ground
Jackie comes up from the basement
How is he
He's upset
don't blame him
It's weird that she just shows up like that
(Checking her watch) And of course she's late, the druggie
Honey
Can you stop, please
You're gonna talk to her, right
5/15/10 -    -   82 : Yeah
am
If you don't punch her first
Car lights in the window
Mike looks out the window
(') It's a cab
It's her
It's not my fault if  punch her
Yeah, it is
That will be your fault
Jackie picks up Stella
The door bell rings
Mike answers it
Cindy is standing there
She looks nervous
(') Hi
'm Mike Flaherty
Come in, please
Hi
And this is my wife, Jackie and my daughter, Stella
Hi
Hi, Cindy
Nice to meet you
She's very cute
Thanks
Abby, our six year old, is downstairs with Kyle
Oh
Awkward pause
Do you want to sit down
Thanks
This is a very nice house
5/15/10 -    -   83 : Thank you very much
Can  get you a drink or something
Jackie shoots Mike a look
drink
(') Water or soda or anything
No
No thanks
'm fine
Right
So 'll go get Kyle
Mike starts to go but Cindy doesn't quite seem ready
How's he doing
Oh, he's doing really well
He's going to the high school here and he's wrestling on the team actually
Really
That's good
He loves wrestling so much
He's a really sweet kid
Our girls love him
That's nice
Cindy starts to tremble
(') am so sorry about this
it's just been such a difficult time
Jackie and Mike share a look
Then Jackie caves and slides over next to her
Oh hey
these things happen, Cindy
And we've loved having him
5/15/10 -    -   84 : Mike rolls his eyes
So much for beating the crap out of her
Abby walks upstairs
Hi, honey
This is Abby
Hi Abby
Hi
Abby, can you go get Kyle for us
He left
He left
What do you mean
He left out the window
'  -
Mike and Cindy are driving
'm really sorry about this
That's okay
Thanks
You know Kyle's doing really well with wrestling here, Cindy
The regions are this weekend and if he wins there then he goes to the states
That's great
Yeah
It is and it could be really good for him
It might even mean a scholarship
Anyway,  was wondering if you could stay here for another three weeks until that's all over
5/15/10 -    -   85 : Cindy thinks about it
'd like to but don't think  can afford to stay in the hotel for that long
Do you think we could stay in my dad's house
This is not what Mike wanted but he's stuck
Uhh
yeah
We could probably make that work
Then, yeah,  could stay
Good
That's great
Mike's phone rings
(') Hey
(
) Hey
Kyle's here
Really
( ) We found him
'  -
Terry looks into the other room
Kyle is playing on the Wii
Yeah
We're playing Wii Golf
'm destroying him
Dude, this kid really hates his mother
'  -
Mike is driving
Yeah,
5/15/10 -    -   86 : (
) mean like more then  hate my ex wife
Great, Ter
Thanks
Bye
(Mike hangs up) He went to my friend's house
We can go get him
Maybe 'll just go back to the hotel
It might just be too much for him tonight
can see him tomorrow
You sure
Yeah
think maybe that's better
know how Kyle can be
'll drop you off
Mike keeps driving
'  -
Mike and Kyle are jogging
Kyle's mood is dark
So when wrestling's over  have to go
'm afraid so, pal
She's staying so you can finish the season
That's pretty nice of her
They arrive back at Mike's house
Mike is really winded
(') told her you'd go see her today, Kyle
Where
5/15/10 -    -   87 : Where ever you want
She could come here or we could go see her at Leo's house
She moving in this morning
Kyle thinks
'll go see her at Leo's before practice
But  want to go alone
() Yeah, that's  but Kyle but you have to promise me
Don't worry, Mike
'll go
Mike turns and spots his   watching him
Hi Mike
Hi Betty
How's the foot
Better
' ,  -
Mike is attempting to plunge the toilet
Shelly approaches him
Mike
Cindy's here
Really
Did she say why
No
But she's here with an attorney
Mike gets up and opens the door to his office
Eleanor and Cindy stand to greet him
Hi Cindy
Hi, 'm Mike Flaherty
5/15/10 -    -   88 : Cindy nods
Hi, 'm Eleanor Cohen
Please come in
He leads them into his office
(') wasn't aware that Cindy was represented by council
She retained me last week to help sort out her father's situation
Last week
thought she just arrived two days ago
( ) How long have you been here
She wanted a little time to settle in and spend some time with her father
So how can  help
Cindy has decided that she wants a more active role in her father's care
What kind of a role is that
want to take care of him
Really
So you want to move here
No
Cindy would like to bring her father back to Columbus
That's where my support network is now
It's home
5/15/10 -    -   89 : Well 'm not sure that's what Leo wants
already talked to him about it
He seem to like the idea
understand that, Cindy
But you haven't seen Leo in a long time and he's battling dementia now so it puts me in a tough position here
She is the presumed Guardian, Mr Flaherty
understand that
And we do hope to avoid litigation
So do  and 'm sure we can
Now, 'm sorry, but  actually have to go see a client so we'll have to set up another time to discuss this
Kyle's still coming to see me today, right
Yeah
Of course
After school
'll have my office call
Come on Cindy
Thanks Mike
Mike nods and Eleanor and Cindy leave
Mike watches them go
-
Mike walks out of the Convenience Store, around the corner and behind the store
He lights a cigarette
5/15/10 -    -   90 : (
) don't get it
Is it that bad
-
Mike and Terry are standing outside talking
Yeah, it's that bad
Just take her to court, you'll kill her
can't
Why not
She's a freaking mess
You're a pillar of the community, Mike
just can't go back in front of Judge Lee, it won't look good, trust me
So maybe you'll get a different judge
She's the only Judge who handles these cases and if  look bad in front of her right now, 'm screwed
'll have to close my fricking doors
Then dump it
Give her Poplar
It sucks but you've got your practice to worry about, right
Yeah,  do
Incoming, dude
Mike turns
Kyle approaches
5/15/10 -    -   91 : Hey, pal
Do you know she wants to take Leo back to Ohio
Yeah
She just told me today
You're not gonna let her do that are you
don't know Kyle
It's complicated
What's complicated about it
She doesn't give a shit about Leo
They hate each other
You can't let her take him
Look, just go get ready for practice and 'll deal with it
Fine but  told her 'm staying with you guys until we leave
Kyle leaves
Terry just looks at Mike
Wow
What's your play
have no idea
have no freaking idea
She's looking for a payout, dude
Just buy her stake and give her an exit
What the hell does that mean
Just give her some of Leo's money and send her home
He's not gonna miss it
He's in happy land
5/15/10 -    -   92 : No,  can't do that
She's not even in his
Mike stops
flash of inspiration
(') That's right
She's not and she doesn't and that's my play
What's your play
Mike takes out his phone and dials
Don't worry about it
just need to make a call
Can you get practice started
Really
You want me to slap your face
Get you psyched up for the call
No
really don't
-
Mike walks into the brick and glass tower
(
) Look, we're all concerned with what's best for Leo so 'm hoping we can settle this in an amicable way
'  -
Mike is siting down with Eleanor and Cindy
So do we
Good, well,  thought 'd start by laying all the cards on the table, so maybe you can understand why 'm hesitating in turning Leo over to Cindy
5/15/10 -    -   93 : Cindy, your father disinherited you from his will
Completely
And 'm afraid that can't change now that he's been declared incapacitated
( ) Is that true
We'll have to see a copy of the will, Mike
Yeah
actually brought you a copy
Mike reaches into his briefcase and puts the on Eleanor's desk
Who did he leave it too
Did he leave it to Kyle
No
Then who
You
No
He left everything to the municipal parks system
He wanted the town park dedicated in his name
That scumbag
He never cared about anyone but himself and his fucking money
Did you know about this
Cindy please
Please what
5/15/10 -    -   94 : (Annoyed to Mike) 'd like to discuss this with my client, Mr
Flaherty
What's to discuss
'm not taking care of him if 'm not getting anything for it
Cindy, please
( ) We're finished here
Mike gets up and walks out
smile creeps across his face
,  -
Jackie, Gina and the kids settle into the bleachers reads
,  -
Mike and Terry walking down the hallway eating
Brass balls, buddy
Brass balls
Yeah
And she's gone back to the motel
That's good
Yes, it is
Yeah,  think it worked
It totally worked
They opened their kimono and you made them eat the trade
don't what know what your talking about half the time
5/15/10 -    -   95 : Really
Yeah
Really
,   -
Kyle is warming up
Vigman is watching
Mike and Terry enter
It's time, Coach
( ) You ready
Kyle just walks out of the warm-up room
He's ready
Yeah, he is
-
The four men walk into the huge gym
It's packed
Kyle is completely focused
Wow
This is big time
bet there are scouts here
Definitely
And wait till we get to the states
Atlantic City here we come, baby
Atlantic City
Fierce
Mike smiles but then his smile fades
Cindy Timmons is standing against the wall
She steps forward and Kyle sees Good luck, baby
Kyle keeps his head down and keeps walking
Mike looks shocked but also keeps walking
5/15/10 -    -   96 ,  -
Mike and Kyle are face to face
Listen to me
One more win and we are going to the states
That's what counts
That's all that matters
You hear me
Kyle nods
Mike can tell that he's half listening
(') Hey
Kyle
Stay in this,
This is your place
You are in control, remember
You control it
Now go get him
Finish this
Mike slaps him
And Kyle races to the mat
The wrestlers slap hands and   blows the whistle
Kyle immediately shoots in for a double leg
The Other Wrestler tries to sprawl but Kyle is in too deep
Kyle lifts him high and dumps him hard to the mat
The audience reacts and the Ref stops the action
The other wrestler bravely pops up but he is obviously stung
Warning
Red
One point
Kyle
Hey
Control
Control
Kyle looks at Mike and nods but his eyes are wild
The Ref blows the whistle and Kyle and the Other Wrestler lock up
They dance a bit and finally the Other Wrestler tries to wrap Kyle up
Kyle back pedals and then literally throws the Other Wrestler off the mat
The Ref has seen enough
He quickly issues Kyle his second warning and disqualifies him from the match
It's over
The Other Wrestler pops up and runs at Kyle
Kyle responds
The Coaches all intervene
It's a melee
,   -
Kyle is sitting on the bench, perfectly still
Mike walks in and sits down next to him
How you doing
5/15/10 -    -   97 : Kyle stares at the floor
'm sorry
Hey, it's alright
Mike puts his arm on his shoulder and Kyle starts to cry
Mike squeezes him
don't want to go with her don't
, pal
,   -
Mike, Terry and Kyle walk out of the school
The entire family is waiting for them
Jackie gives Kyle a big hug
Abby takes his hand
They all get into their car
Mike is just about to get in but then he sees Cindy standing by her car watching
He shuts his door and crosses to her
Why are you here
wanted to see my son wrestle
Yeah, well your son had a pretty good chance to do something special in there
Maybe even change his life and that's gone now
hope you're happy
That's not my fault
It isn't
Why do you think he lost his shit in there, huh
What do you want, lady
want my father
5/15/10 -    -   98 : It didn't sound like that the other day
It sounded like you hated the guy
You have no idea what my father used to be like
No idea
He wasn't like he is now
He treated me like shit and he was all  had
So now you want to return the favor
Is that it
want that commission
That should be mine
And that's why you're doing all this
For fifteen hundred dollars a month
Isn't that why you did it
This stops Mike in his tracks
Alright, 'll tell you what
You want the commission
You can have it
And you don't even have to take Leo
'll take care of him for free and 'll send you the check every month
On one condition
What's that
You leave Kyle here
With us
Until he finishes high school
'm his mother
He belongs with me
Are you sure he feels that way
5/15/10 -    -   99 : Don't tell me what my son feels
He's coming with me and there isn't anything you can do about that
Then you can't have that commission
We'll see about that
Yeah, we will
Mike turns and walks away
want to see my son
Then call him
You have his number
' ,   -
Mike sits on the back porch nursing a beer
Terry stands in the yard facing away from him
We were right there, Mike
Right fucking there
And now we have nothing
Nothing
Terry screams
It's a primal scream
Mike just looks at him
You
No
Terry drinks
Mike watches him
Jackie pops out from the kitchen
Mike, your mom's here and dinner's almost ready
Have you seen Kyle
He's not in the basement
5/15/10 -    -   100 : No
'll track him down
Thanks, Terry
( ) What a day, huh
Yeah, right
Terry goes inside
Jackie sits next to Mike
(') You
Mike shrugs
(') What are we gonna do, Mike
There's nothing to do
can't stop her
She's gonna leave and she's gonna take Kyle and Leo with her
And you don't think you'd beat her in court
No
don't
Why
It's so obvious she's just wants him for the money
Mike turns to Jackie
He wants to tell her but just can't
just can't win this one, Jackie
Trust me
Jackie misinterprets Mike's guilt for pain
She backs off
do
5/15/10 -    -   101 '   -
Cindy is smoking next to the open window
She is nervous knock on the door
She throws the cigarette out the window and closes it
She checks herself in the mirror and opens the door
Kyle is standing there
Kyle, honey, come in
'm so glad you came
She steps back and he enters
(') Have a seat, honey
Do you want a soda or something
He sits on one bed
No
What do you want
She sits on the other facing him
just wanted to say how sorry was about the match and if  did anything to cause it then  will never forgive myself
know how much wrestling means to you, baby
Is that why you called me
Just to tell me that
No
also wanted to say that 'll do whatever you think is best for Leo
promise
Then leave him here
Where he is
will
If that's what you want
But  have to be honest, 'm not sure that's what Leo wants
What do you mean
Here
Read this
5/15/10 -    -   102 : She hands him a piece of paper
What is it
It's the court transcript from when Leo was in court
My lawyer got it
Read the parts in yellow
See what it says
Kyle reluctantly reads it
This isn't real
The Judge told Leo he had to live there
No, honey
This is official from the court
It's what Mike said
Kyle reads it again
(') He gets paid for being Leo's guardian, Kyle
And then he just put him in that place so he didn't have to worry about him
Kyle stares at the page
(') Leo belongs with us, Kyle
Why
Cindy is caught of guard by the question
Why what
Why does he belong with us
Cindy judges her son's look and speaks from the heart
Because we deserve that money, Kyle
Not some lawyer
You're a big boy
You can understand that
5/15/10 -    -   103 : Kyle looks at the page on more time and then suddenly, without warning, pounces on his mother pinning her to the bed
She screams
He gets in her face
Shut up
Shut up
She finally quiets
Terrified
(') Listen to me
don't care about this
It's all bullshit
Leave Leo alone
He belongs here
Do you hear me
Do you
Cindy can only cry and nod
Kyle grabs the paper and runs out the door
'  -
Mike paces around talking on the phone
Thanks, Karen
appreciate it
Bye
Jackie walks into the room
Anything
He's not at Stemler's
This is crazy, where could he be
don't know, he's upset, maybe he went for a walk
Well we should take a drive, your mom can stay with the kids
His phone rings
Jackie stops
Hello
Yes, this is him
What
5/15/10 -    -   104 ,  -
is at the desk
Sir, stay calm, we'll find him
Stay calm
You've lost my ward
Mike
Calm down
Calm down
We are gonna sue you guys, silly
He's a laywer
The Staff Member picks up the phone
Look, he's definitely not on the premises
lot of the time they just try to go home
We're about to go there
Mike and Jackie share a look and leave
Terry turns to some residents who are looking on
Hey folks, listen up
Watch out for each other
(
) Terry
'  -
Mike's car pulls up
They all get out and run up to the house
There's a light on
It's got to be him
Do have the key
No
didn't bring it with me
They arrive at the front door
Mike tries the knob
It's locked
5/15/10 -    -   105 : (') Shit
Mike goes to edge of the porch, climbs up onto the railing and looks into the side window
Leo is sitting in a chair watching
(') There he is
What's he doing
Watching
What's he watching
Who cares
Leo
Hey Leo
Mike knocks on the window
Leo doesn't register it
(') He's not responding
Ring the bell
Jackie does
Leo still doesn't respond
(') Nothing
Fuck
This is freaking spooky
Mike climbs down back onto the porch
(') Should we break in
have a key back at the office could go get it
Is he
He seems it
He's just sitting there
5/15/10 -    -   106 : Suddenly the door opens
Leo is standing there
Hi
// Hi
/Hey
Come on in
Leo walks away
They all follow him
That is very creepy

They walk into the house following Leo into the living room
He sits back in his chair and start watching  again
You , Leo
Leo just watches
(') How did you get here, pal
Mike stoops over and tries to connect with Leo
(') () Did you walk here, Leo
Leo turns and looks at them as if he is about to speak
The all wait for his reply and then
(
) brought him here
They all jump
Kyle
You took Leo
(') Yeah
5/15/10 -    -   107 : Have you lost your mind
We've been worried sick about him
About both of you
You don't have to worry about us
Kyle walks out of the room
That's super spooky
Just saying
'  -
Kyle walks into the kitchen, he turns off a pot of boiling water and strains some pasta
Kyle, What the hell are you doing
( ) Making spaghetti
Have you lost your mind
No
Kyle, why did you do this
Please just tell us
Leo needs to be in a home
This is where he belongs
Kyle he needs to be at Oak Knoll
Kyle, we talked about this
Yeah
We did
Listen to this
Kyle takes a piece of paper out of his pocket
5/15/10 -    -   108 : (') () Mike Flaherty: Mr
Poplar wants to live at home
Judge Lee: You can do that Mike
Mike Flaherty: Yes, can
Really
What is that
Jackie takes it and looks at it
It's from the court
Where did you get this
From my mother
( ) It's true isn't, Mike
Mike
Mike can't answer
Kyle's seen enough
You're just like her
He runs out
They all give chase
'  -
Mike runs outside and see's Kyle crossing the lawn
He quickly catches up to him
Terry and Jackie follow close behind
Hey
Hey, Kyle
Kyle keeps walking
(') Hey can you hold on a second
Leave me alone
Kyle please
5/15/10 -    -   109 : Mike grabs Kyle one more time
Kyle rips his arm away and tries to push Mike back
Don't touch me
Mike deflects Kyle and Kyle spills to the ground
Oh shit
Kyle gets up and starts to circle Mike
Mike has no choice but reciprocate
Would you let me explain
Explain what
How you lied to me
How you lied to Leo
Kyle head pumps
Mike takes the bait and jumps back
Kyle wait
Watch the head fake
Kyle  don't want to wrestle you
Kyle, stop for a minute
Keep your hands out, Mike
Hands out
Terry, stop it
'm just trying to help
You're not helping
Kyle head fakes again but this time he's in
Before Mike knows what hits him, he's on his back
Ow
Oh shit
(') Mike, stop it
Kyle is all over Mike
Mike's trying to fight back but it's useless and even kind of pathetic
5/15/10 -    -   110 : 'm trying to stop it
Sit out Mike
Sit out
Shut up, Terry
Kyle, stop it
Mike gets up to hands and knees but Kyle drives him hard to the ground
(') Ow
Shit
Ouch
He's getting killed
Would you stop coaching and break that up
Terry rushes in and tries to pull Kyle off but he's lost it
Finally, he wraps his arms around Kyle and pulls him off
Kyle spins free and fronts Terry
Terry immediately puts up his hands
'm the ref
'm just the ref
Kyle turns and runs off
Kyle
Stop
Please
He doesn't stop
Jackie turns to Mike
(') Is that true, Mike
Yeah, it is
Mike gets up
So why'd you move him if he wanted to stay here
Because it would have been too much work to leave him here
couldn't have done it
Then you shouldn't have taken him
5/15/10 -    -   111 : had to, alright
Why
Because  needed the money
We needed the money
You moved an old man out of his house to make money
Have you lost your freaking mind
No
just didn't think it would get this complicated
Really
Or you just didn't think you'd get caught
This stops Mike in his tracks
He can't answer
Jackie turns and walks away
Jack
Jack, where are you going
Home
She walks away

137 Stemler is sleeping on one couch
Kyle on the other
Kyle's cell phone rings
He wakes up and checks it
He answers it
Hello
Hello
Mom
She's not there
He hangs up
Kyle starts to put on his shoes
Did your mom just crank call you
No
5/15/10 -    -   112 : So you and Coach Mike get in a fight because you lost
No
We got in a fight because he's an asshole
Really
Yeah, really, Stem
Well 'm sure he'll make it up to you, bro
You're the best wrestler he's ever had
mean he's always been cool to me and  suck
This comment lands with Kyle
-
Mike is sleeping on a love seat
He wakes up
Leo is sitting there watching him
Hey Leo
Hi
fell asleep
'm sorry
Sorry for what
That's a big question
Mike cuts to the chase
You want to go home
Yeah
'  -
Jackie is sitting with Stella and a cup of coffee
The front door opens and closes
Mike walks into the kitchen
5/15/10 -    -   113 : Hi
Hi
Is he here
No
He slept at Stemler's
How about you
Oak Knoll
() You're right, that's not who  am
So what are you going to do
have to go court
You can't
You told the Judge you were keeping Leo at home
know
So then tell her you changed your mind
No one can question that
can't, Jack
Why not
Because it's not true
Well 'm glad your done lying now, just in time to lose your practice
That's how we survive, Mike
Your family
You ever think of that
Yeah
All the time
Jackie quickly crosses to the sink
She starts to clean
She breaks something
5/15/10 -    -   114 : Shit
She braces herself against the sink and exhales
Mike just watches her
'm sorry, Jack

Mike heads down the stairs

Jackie and Mike walk downstairs
Kyle is angrily gathering his stuff and putting it in his back pack
Hey Kyle
How'd you get down here
The window

They share a look and walk over to Kyle
Kyle, listen,  just wanted to say 'm sorry

Everyone's always sorry

And 'm gonna fight to keep him there
It's too late
You'll lose
My mother's gonna take him
5/15/10 -    -   115 : Maybe but 'm still gonna try
So what
You want me to forgive you now
Is that it, Mike
No
just want you to give me another chance
That's all 'm asking
Mike's sincerity is undeniable
Kyle looks to Jackie
They connect
Kyle shakes his head, turns around, and then throws his bag
This is bullshit
Mike looks at Jackie
Hey, Kyle, listen - want to be alone
What
(Without looking at them) All right
Yeah
Jackie and Mike turn and start to walk upstairs but Jackie stops
Kyle,  just wanna say - we love you
Kyle keeps his back turned to them as they continue up the stairs

Tight on the Baby Monitor
We hear Stella crying and Jackie talking to Abby
5/15/10 -    -   116 : (
) Abby, just pick a shirt and put it on
Please
Mike is sitting alone at the kitchen table drinking a cup of coffee
The remnants of a pancake breakfast are on the table
There is one clean plate where Kyle usually sits
After a moment, Kyle comes up from the basement and sits down at the table without saying anything
He just looks at Mike
Then he serves himself a few pancakes
Mike passes him the bottle of syrup
He takes it and puts some on his pancakes
He eats
Mike watches

The group is walking up the front steps of the court house
Terry joins
Hi guys

The whole gang is walking toward to the courtroom
Mike
Mike turns
Eleanor approaches
5/15/10 -    -   117 : Hi Eleanor
Can  talk to you
Sure
Mike and Eleanor step to the side
She looks at Mike
You know the transcript alone is enough to hang you
Yeah, well, we'll see what happens
Eleanor just looks at him, Judge and Jury
Mike blinks
Shame on you counselor
Is that it
No
My client would like to talk to you
Mike and Eleanor walk over to Cindy
She is barely holding it together
Hi Cindy
Hi
Is your deal still available
Mike tries to conceal his shock
What about Kyle
Cindy and Eleanor share a look
He can stay
Then yes
It is
5/15/10 -    -   118 : And you'll send me the checks
Every month
You take good care of him
We will
Cindy nods
want to say goodbye
Mike turns and waves Kyle over
Kyle look to Jackie who gives him the
He walks over as Mike steps away
He just looks at his mother
She gently touches his face
He doesn't move
Everyone looks on as Cindy says a few words to Kyle, hugs him hard and then quickly turns and walks away
Kyle watches her go
'  -
croquet ball hits a stick
(
) Your turn
Abby, Kyle, and Stemler are playing on the front lawn
know
Don't rush me
Stemler hits a shot and the ball goes into the garden
(') This mallet is crap
You see that
Mike pulls up and gets out of his car, wearing a suit and carrying his briefcase
Hi guys
Hi, Daddy

5/15/10 -    -   119 : What's up, coach
Hi

Mike drops his briefcase and takes off his coat
Hi Honey

Jackie walks in from the other room, gives Mike a kiss

Mike heads upstairs
(') 'll be right back down
Do you have time to eat
'll eat there
Make sure you do
5/15/10 -    -   120 ' ,  -
Mike takes off his suit and throws it on the bed
He puts on a casual button down blue shirt
He takes a hard look himself in the mirror, almost as if he's steeling himself for something
Mike smiles
-
Terry walks in and crosses to the bar
He sits down
Can  get a banana daiquiri, please
The Bartender turns
It's Mike
Sure
Mike opens a beer and sets it down in front of Terry
(') You want an umbrella with that
Nah

But keep these coming
Mike checks a ticket and prepares two drinks
(') So how you doing, pal
