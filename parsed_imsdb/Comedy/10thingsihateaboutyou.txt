href <b>// --> </b> Ten Things  Hate About You - by Karen McCullah Lutz & Kirsten Smith written by Karen McCullah Lutz & Kirsten Smith based on 'Taming of the Shrew" by William Shakespeare Revision November 12, 1997 - Welcome to Padua High School,, your typical urban-suburban high school in Portland, Oregon
Smarties, Skids, Preppies, Granolas
Loners, Lovers, the In and the Out Crowd rub sleep out of their eyes and head for the main building
- , eighteen, pretty -- but trying hard not to be -- in a baggy granny dress and glasses, balances a cup of coffee and a backpack as she climbs out of her battered, baby blue '75 Dodge Dart
stray  clips her, causing her to stumble and spill her coffee, as well as the contents of her backpack
The young  dashes over to help, trembling when he sees who his board has hit
Hey -- sorry
Cowering in fear, he attempts to scoop up her scattered belongings
Leave it He persists
(continuing) said, leave it
She grabs his skateboard and uses it to  him against a car, skateboard tip to his throat
He whimpers pitifully and she lets him go
path clears for her as she marches through a pack of fearful students and  open the door, entering school
'  - , a beautiful sophomore, stands facing the mirror, applying lipstick
Her less extraordinary, but still cute friend,  stands next to her
Did you change your hair
No
You might wanna think about it Leave the girls' room and enter the hallway
- - Bianca is immediately greeted by an admiring crowd, both boys and girls alike
(adoring) Hey, Bianca
Awesome shoes
The greetings continue as Chastity remains wordless and unaddressed by her side
Bianca smiles proudly, acknowledging her fans
'  - , a clean-cut, easy-going senior with an open, farm-boy face, sits facing Miss Perky, an impossibly cheery guidance counselor
'm sure you won't find Padua any different than your old school
Same little asswipe mother-fuckers everywhere
Her plastic smile never leaves her face
Cameron fidgets in his chair uncomfortably
(continuing) Any questions
don't think so, ma'am Then go forth
Scoot   've got deviants to see
Cameron rises to leave and makes eye contact with , a sullen-looking bad ass senior who waits outside Ms Perky's door
His slouch and smirk let us know how cool he is
Miss Perky looks down at her file and up at Patrick (continuing) Patrick Verona
see we're making our visits a weekly ritual
She gives him a withering glance
He answers with a charming smile
missed you
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls
It was a bratwurst
was eating lunch
With the teeth of your zipper
She motions for Patrick to enter her office and Cameron shuffles out the door, bumping into  , a lanky, brainy senior who will either end up a politician or game show host
You the new guy
So they tell me
'mon
'm supposed to give you the tour
They head out of the office (continuing) So -- which Dakota you from
North, actually
How'd you
was kidding
People actually live there
Yeah
couple
We're outnumbered by the cows, though
How many people were in your old school
Thirty-two
Get out
How many people go here
Couple thousand
Most of them evil - - Prom posters adorn the wall
Michael steers Cameron through the crowd as he points to various cliques
We've got your basic beautiful people
Unless they talk to you first, don't bother
The beautiful people pass, in full jock/cheerleader splendor
(continuing) Those 're your cowboys
Several Stetson-wearing, big belt buckle
Wrangler guys walk by
That 'm used to
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse
They just jack off to Clint Eastwood
They pass an espresso cart with a group of teens huddled around it
(continuing) To the right, we have the Coffee Kids
Very edgy
Don't make any sudden movements around them
- Michael continues the tour And these delusionals are the White Rastae
Several white boys in dreadlocks and Jamaican knit berets lounge on the grass
cloud of pot smoke hovers above them (continuing) Big Marley fans
Think they're black
Semi-political, but mostly, they watch a lot of Wild Kingdom, if you know what mean
Michael waves to , the one with the longest dreads
(continuing) Derek - save some for after lunch, bub
(very stoned) Michael, my brother, peace Cameron turns to follow Michael as they walk into the cafeteria
So where do you fit in all this
-  - Loud music and loud students
Michael sits with a group of studious-looking teens
Future MBAs-  We're all Ivy League, already accepted
Someday 'll be sipping Merlot while those guys -- He points to the table of jocks, as they torture various passers-by
(continuing) are fixing my Saab
Yuppie greed is back, my friend
He points proudly to the  on his shirt
Cameron stops listening as  walks by, and we go Pure and perfect, she passes Cameron and Michael without a look
Cameron is smitten That girl --  -- You burn, you pine, you perish
Who is she
Bianca Stratford
Sophomore
Don't even think about it Why not
could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter
She's not allowed to date until her older sister does
And that's an impossibility
- room full of bored seniors doodle and scare off into space , the one-step-away-from-medication English Teacher, tries to remember what she's talking about
Well, then
Oh, yes
guess that does it for our analysis of The Old Man and the Sea
Any other comments
(with dread) Kat
Kat, the girl we saw as we entered the school, slowly cakes off her glasses and speaks up
Why didn't we just read the Hardy Boys
'm sorry
This book is about a guy and his fishing habit
Not exactly a crucial topic
The other students roll their eyes
(continuing) Frankly, 'm baffled as to why we still revere Hemingway
He was an abusive, alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of cats
, a well-muscled jock with great cheekbones, makes fun of her from his row
As opposed to a bitter self-righteous hag who has no friends
few giggles
Kat ignores him
practiced gesture That's enough, Mr
Dorsey
Really gets fired up now guess the school board thinks because Hemingway's male and an asshole, he's worthy of our time She looks up at Ms
Blaise, who is now fighting with her pill box
(continuing) What about Colette
Charlotte Bronte
Simone de Beauvoir
Patrick, lounging in his seat in the back row, elbows a crusty-looking crony, identified by the name , embroidered on his workshirt
Mother Goose
The class titters
Kat wears an expression of intolerance '  - Kat now sits before Miss Perky
Katarina Stratford
My, my
You've been terrorizing Ms
Blaise again
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild
By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested
still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls
was merely a spectator
The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat
Kat smiles at her, daring her to say it
Tempestuous
No
believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often
She grimaces, as if she's referring to a medical condition
(continuing) You might want to work on that Kat rises from her chair with a plastic smile matching the counselor's
As always, thank you for your excellent guidance
- Bianca ignores the droning teacher as she writes a note in big flowing handwriting
(0
) realize the language of Mr
Shakespeare makes him a bit daunting, but 'm sure you're all doing your best
Bianca folds the note and passes it behind her with a flip of her hair to
Chastity opens the note and reads: - " " Chastity frowns to herself
(0
) (continuing) Ms
Stratford, do you care to comment on what you've read so far
Bianca looks up and smiles the smile of Daddy's little girl
Not really
The teacher shakes her head, but lets it go
a waif-like senior girl who sits off to the side trying to slit her wrist with the plastic spiral on her notebook, looks up and raises her hand
Mandella -- since you're assisting us, you might as well comment
'm assuming you read the assignment
Uh, yeah,  read it all The whole play^ The whole folio
All the plays
(disbelieving) You've read every play by William Shakespeare
Haven't you
She raises a challenging eyebrow
The stunned teacher doesn't answer and goes to call on the next student
- Mandella and Kat sit down in the quiet corner
They are eating a carton of yogurt with gusto
Your sister is so amazingly without
She'll never read him
She has no idea
Kat attacks The fact that you're cutting gym so you can
Sophomore English just to hear his name, is a little without in itself if you ask me
Kat's attention is caught by Patrick as he walks by with his friends, lighting up a cigarette
Mandella notices her staring
Who's that
Patrick Verona   Random skid
That's Pat Verona
The one who was gone for a year
heard he was doing porn movies
'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting
He always look so Block
Kat turns back to face Mandella and forces her yogurt into Mandella's hand
(continuing) Mandella, eat
Starving yourself is a very slow way to die
Just a little
She eats
Kat sees her wrist What's this
An attempted slit
Kat stares at her, expressionless
realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions
You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy
But imagine the things he'd say during sex
Thinks a minute Okay, say you do it
You kill yourself, you end up in wherever you end up and he's there
Do you really think he's gonna wanna dace a ninety pound compulsive who failed volleyball
Mandella's attention is struck by Bianca As she and Chastity parade by Joey and his    One of the cohorts elbows Joey
Virgin alert
Joey looks up and smiles at Bianca
Lookin' good, ladies
Bianca smiles her coyest of smiles
Still watching
Tragic
Doesn't respond Michael and Cameron observe Joey's leers at Bianca from their bench in another corner
Cowboys eating cue of a can of beans linger on the grass behind them
Why do girls like that always like guys like that
Because they're bred to
Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them
Their gene pool is rarely diluted
He always have that shit-eating grin
Joey Dorsey
Perma-shit-grin
wish could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class
And a model
Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out
The  rings, and the cowboys stand and spit into their empty bean cans
Cameron and Michael rise as Cameron tries to catch a glimpse of Bianca as she walks back inside
(continuing) You know French
Sure do
my Mom's from Canada Guess who just signed up for a tutor
You mean 'd get a chance to talk to her
You could consecrate with her, my friend
Cameron watches as Bianca flounces back into the building
- Kat and Mandella walk toward Kat's car
Joey pulls up beside her in his Viper
(re her dress) The vintage look is over, Kat
Haven't you been reading your Sassy
Yeah, and  noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow
Tough break
(practically spitting) They're running the rest of me next month
He zooms away as Kat yanks open the door of her Dart
Mandella ties a silk scarf around her head, as if they're in a convertible
The people at this school are so incredibly foul
You could always go with me
'm sure William has some friends
They watch Joey's car as he slows next to Bianca and Chastity as they walk toward the school bus
Need a ride, ladies
Bianca and Chastity can't get in Joey's car fast enough
He pulls away with a smile
Mandella lowers her sunglasses to watch
That's a charming new development Kat doesn't answer, but reaches over and puts a tape in the tape deck
The sounds of    fill the car
As they pull out, Michael crosses in front of them on his moped
Kat has to  the brakes to keep from hitting him (yelling) Remove head from sphincter
Then pedal
Michael begins fearfully, pedaling as Kat  out, angry at the delay
Cameron rushes over You all right
He slows to a stop Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew
That's her
Bianca's sister
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself
Michael putters off, leaving Cameron dodging Patrick's grimy, grey Jeep -- a vehicle several years and many paint jobs away from its former glory as a    - - as he sideswipes several cars on his way out of the lot
- , attractive and focused, sits in front of her computer, typing quickly
shelf next to her holds several bodice-ripper romance novels, bearing her name
Kat stands behind her, reading over her shoulder as she types
"Undulating with desire, Adrienne removes her crimson cape, revealing her creamy --" , a blustery, mad scientist-type obstetrician, enters through the front door, wearing a doctor's white jacket and carrying his black bag
hope dinner's ready because  only have ten minutes before Mrs
Johnson squirts out a screamer
He grabs the mail and rifles through it, as he bends down to kiss Sharon on the cheek
In the microwave
(to Kat) Make anyone cry today
Sadly, no
But it's only four-thirty
Bianca walks in
(continuing) Where've you been
(eyeing Walter) Nowhere
Hi, Daddy
She kisses him on the cheek Hello, precious
Walter kisses Bianca back as Kat heads up the stairs How touching
Walter holds up a letter to Kat What's this
It says Sarah Lawrence
Snatches it away from him
guess  got in Sharon looks up from her computer
What's a synonym for throbbing
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country
know
thought we decided you were going to school here
At  of 0
You decided
Is there even a question that we want her to stay
Kat gives Bianca an evil look then smiles sweetly at Ask Bianca who drove her home Swollen
turgid
(to Bianca; upset) Who drove you home
Bianca glares at Kat then turns to Walter Now don't get upset
Daddy, but there's this boy
and  think he might ask
No
You're not dating until your sister starts dating
End of discussion
What if she never starts dating
Then neither will you
And 'll get to sleep at night
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips
Enough
He pulls out a small tape recorder from his black bag
(continuing) Do you know what this is
He hits the "play' button and    emanate from the tape recorder
(in unison, by rote) The sound of a fifteen-year-old in labor
This is why you're not dating until your sister does
But she doesn't want to date
Exactly my point His  goes off and he grabs his bag again (continuing) Jesus
Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating
Tumescent
(to Sharon; as he leaves) You're not helping
- Cameron sits with an empty chair beside him
Bianca arrives in a flurry of blonde hair
Can we make this quick
Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad
Again
Well,  thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part
Please
(looking down) Okay
then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine
Saturday
Night
Bianca smiles slowly You're asking me out
That's so cute
What's your name again
(embarrassed) Forget it
Bianca seizes an opportunity
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction --- Cameron
The thing is, Cameron -- 'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser
My sister
can't date until she does
Seems like she could get a date easy enough
She fingers a lock of her hair
He looks on, dazzled
The problem is, she's completely anti-social
Why
Unsolved mystery
She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something
That's a shame
She reaches out and touches his arm Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend
Let me see what  can do
Cameron smiles, having no idea how stupid he is frog is being torn asunder by several prongs and picks
Michael and Cameron go for the spleen
You're in school for one day and you ask out the most beautiful girl
Do you have no concept of the high school social code
Cameron grins away teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you
So what's the point
Cameron motions with his head toward Patrick, a few lab tables away
He's wearing biker glasses instead of goggles as he tries to revive his frog
What about him
(confused) You wanna go out with him
The others at the lab table raise their eyebrows (impatient) No - he could wrangle with the sister
Michael smiles
Liking the intrigue
What makes you think he'll do it
He seems like he thrives on danger No kidding
He's a criminal
heard he lit a state trooper on fire
He just got out of Alcatraz
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology
'm serious, man, he's whacked
He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers
Forget his reputation
Do you think we've got a plan or not
Did she actually say she'd go out with you
That's what  just said Michael processes this
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set
You'd outrank everyone
Strictly -list
With me by your side
thought you hated those people
Hey -- 've gotta have a few clients when  get to Wall Street
cowboy flicks the frog's heart into one of the Coffee Kid's latte
Cameron presses on, over the melee
So now all we gotta do is talk to him
He points to Patrick, who now makes his frog hump another frog, with full-on sound effects
'll let you handle that
- Boys and a few stray girls nail their pieces of wood Michael sits next to , a Coffee Kid, who holds out his jacket like the men who sell watches in the subway
Inside several bags of coffee hang from hooks
Some people like the Colombian, but it all depends on your acidity preference
Me
prefer East African and Indonesian
You start the day with a Sumatra Boengie or maybe and Ethiopian Sidamo in your cup, you're that much farther ahead than someone drinkin' Cosia Rican or Kona -- you know what mean
Michael nods solemnly
Patrick sits at a table with Scurvy, making something that looks like a machete out of a two-by-four
Cameron approaches, full of good-natured farm boy cheer Hey, there In response, Patrick brandishes a loud   in his direction
Cameron slinks away
(continuing) Later, then
Michael watches, shaking his head
- Joey and his pals take turns drawing boobs onto a cafeteria tray with a magic marker
Michael walks up and sits between them, casual as can be Hey
Are you lost
Nope - just came by to chat We don't chat
Well, actually,  thought 'd run an idea by you
You know, just to see if you're interested
We're not
He grabs Michael by the side of the head, and proceeds to draw a penis on his cheek with the magic marker
Michael suffers the indignity and speaks undaunted
(grimacing) Hear me out
You want Bianca don't you
Joey sits back and cackles at his drawing
(continuing) But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her
right
Does this conversation have a purpose
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her
Someone who's up for the job
Michael points to Patrick, who makes a disgusted face at his turkey pot pie before he rises and throws it at the garbage can, rather than in it
That guy
heard he ate a live duck once
Everything but the beak and the feet
Exactly Joey turns to look at Michael
What's in it for you
Oh, hey, nothin' man   Purely good will on my part
He rises to leave and turns to the others
(continuing) have a dick on my face, don't
'  - Michael stands at the sink, trying to scrub Joey's artwork off his face as Cameron watches
You got him involved
Like we had a choice
Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power
We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca
Cameron grins and puts an arm around him You're one brilliant guy Michael pulls back, noticing other guys filing in
Hey -  appreciate gratitude as much as the next guy, but it's not gonna do you any good to be known as New Kid Who Embraces Guys In The Bathroom
Cameron pulls back and attempts to posture himself in a manly way for the others, now watching
'    - Kat and Mandella pick apart their pad thai
Mandella is smoking
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that  go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school
have no say at all
William would never have gone to a state school
William didn't even go to high school That's never been proven Neither has his heterosexuality
Mandella replies with a look of ice
Kat uses the moment to stub out Mandella's cigarette
(continuing) appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but 'm consuming
(pointing at her food) Do you mind
Does it matter
If  was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious
Don't forget your tiara
" They both look up as Patrick enters
He walks up to the counter to place his order
Mandella leans toward Kat with the glow of fresh gossip Janice Parker told me he was a roadie for Marilyn Manson
Patrick nods at them as he takes his food outside
Janice Parker is an idiot '  - Patrick sits before Miss Perky, eating his Thai food (looking at chart) don't understand, Patrick
You haven't done anything asinine this week
Are you not feeling well
Touch of the flu
'm at a loss, then
What should we talk about
Your year of absence
He smiles his charming smile How 'bout your sex life
She tolerates his comment with her withering glance
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid
What's to discuss
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as  can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title
and the benefits package is pretty good
The bell
Fine
Go do something repugnant and give us something to talk about next week
- Several pairs of tutors and students sit at the various desks
Mandella sits with , a White Rasta
She attempts to get him to do geometry, but he stares at her, as if smitten Look, it's really easy
You're a freedom fighter
Be proud, sister
Mandella sets down her pencil and closes the book
(rotely) It's Mandella with two 's
am not related to Nelson Mandela
am not a political figure
do not live in South Africa
My parents just spent a few too many acid trips thinking they were revolutionaries
But you freed our people Your "people" are white, suburban high school boys who smoke too much hemp have not freed you, Trevor
(grabbing his arm dramatically) Only you can free yourself
Bianca and Cameron sit side by side, cozy as can be 'esc ma tete
This is my head Right
See
You're ready for the quiz
don't want to know how to say that though
want to know useful things
Like where the good stores are
How much does champagne cost
Stuff like Chat
have never in my life had to point out my head to someone
That's because it's such a nice one
Forget French
She shuts her book and puts on a seductive smile (continuing) How is our little Find the Wench  Date plan progressing
Well, there's someone  think might be -- Bianca's eyes light up Show me - Cameron and Bianca lean against the wall -inconspicuously
Bianca plays it cool
Give me a sign when he walks by
And don't point
The bell
Kids flood past
Then Patrick saunters by with Scurvy
Cameron nudges Bianca
There
Where
Out of desperation, Cameron awkwardly lunges across Patrick's path
Patrick shoves him back against the wall without a thought
Cameron lands in a  at Bianca's feet
guess he didn't see me (calling after Patrick) Some other time -- Bianca watches Patrick, a wicked gleam in  her eye
My God, he's repulsive
He's so perfect
- Several volleyball games are being played
Joey and a member of his hulking entourage, approach Patrick, who still manages to look cool, even in gym clothes
They pull him aside roughly
(shrugging them off) What
Joey points See that girl
Patrick follows his line of vision to Kat as she spikes the ball into some poor cowboy's face
Yeah What do you think
Kat wins the game and high fives the others, who are scared of her
Two legs, nice rack
Yeah, whatever
want you to go out with her
Sure, Sparky
'll get right on it
You just said You need money to take a girl out But you'd go out with her if you had the cake
Patrick stares at Joey deadpan
His dislike for the guy obvious
(sarcastic) Yeah, 'd take her to Europe if  had the plane
Joey smiles
You got it, Verona
pick up the tab, you do the honors
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl
can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend
And that's the catch
She doesn't want a boyfriend
How much
Twenty bucks each time you take her out
can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks
Fine, thirty
Patrick raises an eyebrow, urging him up (continuing) Take it or leave it
This isn't a negotiation
Fifty, and you've got your man
Patrick walks away with a smile - Kat and the rest of the team go through a grueling practice session
Kat spares no one as she whips the ball all over the field
Patrick sits on the bleachers nearby, watching
cigarette dangles from his mouth
His pal,  is next to him
, the coach, blows the
(proudly) Good run, Stratford
Kat nods in response, and the girls leave the field
Patrick hops down to follow
Hey
Girlie
Kat stops and turns slowly to look at him
(continuing) mean Wo-man
How ya doin'
(smiles brightly) Sweating like a pig, actually
And yourself
There's a way to get a guy's attention
My mission in life
She stands there undaunted, hand on hip
(continuing) Obviously, 've struck your fancy
So, you see, it worked
The world makes sense again
Patrick's eyes narrow
He steps closer
Pick you up Friday, then Oh, right
Friday
backs up a little
He uses his most seductive tone The night  take you to places you've never been before
And back
Like where
The 7-Eleven on Burnside
Do you even know my name, screwboy
know a lot more than that Kat stares at him
Doubtful
Very doubtful
She walks away quickly, leaving him standing alone
(calling after her) You're no bargain either, sweetheart
Scurvy appears at his side So  guess the Jeep won't be getting a new Blaupunkt
Cameron and Michael watch
He took the bait
/ - Kat washes her face at the sink
Bianca appears behind her, and attempts to twist Kat's hair into a chignon
She wacks Bianca away
Have you ever considered a new look mean, seriously, you could have some potential buried under all this hostility
Kat pushes past her into the hallway
have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way
Can you at least start wearing a bra
Kat  her door in response
- Patrick, Scurvy and some other randoms head for the exit You up for a burger
Patrick looks in his wallet
It's empty
- Kat stands at her locker, gathering her books
Patrick appears at her side, smiling
Hey Kat doesn't answer (continuing) You hate me don't you
don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me
And why would  do that
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass
You -- covered in my vomit
Seven-thirty
She slams her locker shut and walks away - Kat emerges from a music store carrying a bag of CDs in  her teeth, and fumbling through her purse with both hands
She finds her keys and pulls them out with a triumphant tug
She looks up and finds Patrick sitting on the hood of her car Nice ride
Vintage fenders
Kat takes the bag out of her mouth
Are you following me
was in the laundromat
saw your car
Thought 'd say hi
Hi She gets in and starts the car
You're not a big talker, are you
Depends on the topic
My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy
She starts to pull out, and is blocked by Joey's Viper, which pulls up perpendicular to her rear and parks
Joey and his groupies emerge and head for the liquor store (continuing) Hey -- do you mind
Not at all They continue on into the store
Kat stares at them in disbelief
Then Her vintage fenders  into the door of Joey's precious Viper
Patrick watches with a delighted grin Joey races out of the liquor store
(continuing) You fucking bitch
Kat pulls forward and backs into his car again
Smiling sweetly
- Walter paces as Kat sits calmly on the couch
My insurance does not cover Then tell them  had a seizure
Is this about Sarah Lawrence
You punishing me
thought you were punishing me
Why can't we agree on this
Because you're making decisions for me
As a parent, that's my right So what  want doesn't matter
You're eighteen
You don't know what you want
You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it
(emphatic) want to go to an East Coast school want you to trust me to make my own choices
want -- Walter's  goes off Christ
want a night to go by that 'm not staring a contraction in the face
He walks out, leaving Kat stewing on the couch
- Patrick shuts his graffiti-encrusted locker, revealing Joey's angry visage, glowering next to him
When  shell out fifty,  expect results
'm on it Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date
got her under control
She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image
Joey sees through the bluff Let me put it to you this way, if you don't get any action,  don't get any action
So get your ass on hers by the end of the week
Joey starts to walk off just upped my price (turning) What
hundred bucks a date
Forget it
Forget her sister, then
Joey thinks for a frustrated moment,   the locker, then peels another fifty out of his wallet with a  menacing scowl
You better hope you're as smooth as you think you are, Verona
Patrick takes the money with a smile
- Cameron runs a sentence past Bianca
La copine et  'ami
La diferance
Bianca glares at him
"copine" is someone you can count on
An "ami" is someone who makes promises he can't keep
Cameron closes the French book You got something on your mind
counted on you to help my cause
You and that thug are obviously failing
Aren't we ever going on our date
He melts You have my word
As a gentleman You're sweet
She touches his hand
He blushes at her praise and watches her toss her hair back (appreciative) How do you get your hair to look like that
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days
And  never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment
Cameron nods with interest
You know,  read an article about that
Bianca looks surprised
You did
'  - Patrick stands at the sink, washing his hands Michael and Cameron cower in the corner, watching him
(without turning around) Say it (clearing his throat) What
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say
Cameron bravely steps forward We wanted to talk to you about the plan
Patrick turns toward them
What plan
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford
What is it with this chick
She have three tits
Cameron starts to object, but Michael holds up a hand
think  speak correctly when  say that Cameron's love is pure
Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants
'm just in this for the cash
Cameron starts choking at the thought of Joey plowing his beloved Bianca
That's where we can help you
With Kat
So Dorsey can get the girl
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture
Joey's just a pawn
We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl
Patrick smiles
He likes the idea of Joey being a pawn in this game
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast
(grinning) We're your guys
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way
Yeah -- we'll see
He swings the door open and exits, leaving Michael and Cameron grinning at each other
We're in
- on a party invitation as it gets handed out
"Future Princeton Grad Bogey Lowenstein proudly presents a Saturday night bash at his abode
Casual attire"
Michael holds the invitation up to Cameron
This is it
golden opportunity
Patrick can ask Katarina to the party
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out
Will Bogey get bent
Are you kidding
He'll piss himself with joy
He's the ultimate kiss ass
- Michael hands a jock the party invite as they pass each other at the trash cans
- The jock calls a fellow jock - Jock whispers to a cheerleader - The cheerleader calls a White Rasta that she's making out with, showing him the invite
- The White Rasta tells a cowboy as they run laps during track practice
- The cowboy Cells a Coffee Kid, as he shields his java from the spray of the shower
- Joey stands ac his open locker with Bianca
The locker is an homage to Joey's "modeling" career
Cheesy   of him -- running in a field of daisies, petting a kitten, etc
-- adorn the locker door
Which do you like better
-  of Joey
In one, he's pouting in a white shirt
In the other, he's pouting in a black shirt
think  like the white shirt Joey nods thoughtfully
It's more Expensive
Exactly (beat) So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday
Hopefully
He gives her his best flirtatious smile Good, 'cause 'm not gonna bother if you won't be there
He taps her on the nose and she giggles Bianca sits across from Cameron, who's transfixed, as always Have you heard about Bogey Lowenstein's party
Sure have
(pouting) really, really, really wanna go, but can't
Not unless my sister goes
'm workin' on it
But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him
He fishes
(continuing) She's not a
Lesbian
No
found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so 'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies
So that's the kind of guy she likes
Pretty ones
Who knows
All 've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes
Cameron furiously takes notes All right
What else is she partial to
- Patrick plays pool with some random deviant cronies
He looks up when he hears a  at the door
the bouncer is in the midst of throwing Michael and Cameron out
Lou, it's okay
They're with me
Lou looks at Patrick, surprised, then reluctantly lets our two non-deviants pass through
Patrick guides them to a table and sips from a beer
(continuing) What've you got for me
've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford think you'll find helpful
Cameron pulls out a piece of paper
(to Patrick) One question before we start -- should you be drinking alcohol when you don't have a liver
What
Good enough
Cameron looks up at Patrick
Number one
She hates smokers It's a lung cancer issue Her favorite uncle Dead at forty-one
Patrick sits up Are you telling me 'm a - (spits the word out) "non-smoker"
Just for now
Another thing
Bianca said that Kat likes -- pretty guys
This is met with silence
Then: What
You don't think 'm pretty
Michael smacks Cameron He's pretty
Okay
wasn't sure Cameron goes back to the list
(continuing) Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion"
So what does that give me
'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments
Ever been to Club Skunk
Yeah
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night
Don't make me do it, man Assail your ears for one night
It's her favorite band
Patrick groans also retrieved a list of her most recent  purchases, courtesy of American Express
He hands it over
(smiling) Michael -- did you get this information "illegally"
Michael puts a finger to his lips
prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows
'm likin' you guys better He looks down at the list of CDs
(continuing) This is really music
'  - in a room with minimalist decor splashed with indie rock band posters and flyers
Kat and Mandella dance as they dress and apply make-up Bianca enters, interrupting their fun
Can you turn down the Screaming Menstrual Bitches
'm trying to study
Kat doesn't move, so Bianca crosses to the stereo, turning down the volume
(continuing) Don't tell me you're actually going out
On a school night, no less
Kat shoots her a glare (continuing; excited) Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going
(disappointed) Oh,  thought you might have a date (beat) don't know why 'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night
What do you think
think you're a freak
think you do this to torture me
And  think you suck
She smiles sweetly and shuts the door behind her
Kat doesn't bat an eye
She grabs her purse and opens the door Let's hit it
- happy black and white neon skunk sprays fine mist on the line of kids below
- Kat and Mandella walk in, Mandella nervously pulling out her fake
The giant, afroed bouncer, , looks typically mono-syllabic
(whispering to Kat) You think this'll work
No fear
They approach Bruce
Kat puts on her happy, shiny face (continuing) Hello
We'd like two for Gigglepuss
Bruce looks the girls up and down
can count
He looks at their IDs
Mandella gently moves Kat aside, wearing a face that could only be described as "  a Victoria's Secret model
" 'll bet you can
She sticks out her chest and licks her lips
Bruce stares at her deadpan and hands her back the IDs
Go ahead
(to Mandella) And you (all come hither) Yes
Take it easy on the guys in there
Mandella winks at him and sashays inside   Kat: follows behind, shaking her head
- Patrick's mail truck clatters to a stop out front
- Patrick walks up to Bruce, who's frisking a badly mowhawked Bruce pulls a  out of the boy's inside pocket
Next time, leave the Bic at home, Skippy
It's a bottle opener
Bruce pushes him inside the club, then sees Patrick
Verona, my man
They shake
Always a pleasure, Brucie
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan
Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you
Fan of a fan
You see a couple of minors come in
Never Padua girls
One tall, decent body
The other one kinda short and undersexed
Just sent 'em through
Patrick starts to go in (continuing) Hey -- what happened to that chick you brought last time
The one with the snake
Patrick laughs and goes into the club - Onstage, the all-female band  is parlaying their bad girl sass into a ripping punk number
Near the stage is a joyful mass of pogo-ing teens Patrick bellies up and looks around the club
Gigglepuss finishes a song
Hello, out there
We're Gigglepuss and we're from Olympia
teenage boy in the audience takes the opportunity to scream
(0
) Pet my kitty
Meow They rev into their next song
Mandella and Kat glow with sweat
When they hear the opening chords of the song, they look at each other and scream with glee as they begin to dance
They couldn't be having a better time
Patrick signals to get the bartender's attention and looks across the bouncing surge of the crowd
He spots Kat and Mandella singing along
The gleeful Kat -- dancing and looking completely at ease
None of her usual "attitude"
Patrick is transfixed
And most definitely attracted
Kat looks at Mandella
(shouting) need agua
She makes her way through the crowd to the bar She made it
She signals for the bartender and as she's waiting, looks around
She spots Patrick a few feet away (continuing to herself) Shit She sneaks a glance
He's staring, but this time he looks away before she can
Despite herself, she's miffed
The bartender arrives (shouting) What can  get you
Two waters
She looks at Patrick again
He's completely absorbed in the band
She scowls
The bottled water arrives and she marches off, forgetting to pay
She walks up to Patrick
(continuing) You're not fooling anyone
Patrick looks at her, surprised (yelling) hey
Great show, huh
(yelling) If you're planning on asking me out you might as well get it over with
(yelling) Excuse me
(yelling) That's what you want, isn't it
(yelling; gesturing toward the band) Do you mind
You're sort of ruining it for me
Kat steams
And watches him watch the band (yelling) You're not surrounded by your usual cloud of smoke
The band takes a break, so they can stop yelling now know
quit
He leans back, making no attempt to hit on her
She moves closer
Oh, really
He motions toward the stage You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there
You know who The Raincoats are
Why, don't you
She's completely taken aback
He uses the moment to his advantage and brushes her hair back as he speaks right into her ear
(continuing) watched you out there   've never seen you look like that Kat steps away, brushing the hair back that he just touched Her cheeks pinken
His cocky side is back in a flash (continuing) Come to that party with me
At that moment, the band starts another (yelling) What
The bartender approaches
(to Kat, yelling) You forgot to pay
(yelling) got it, Rick
He tosses some bills on the bar Rather than thank him, Kat simply watches him, trying to figure out his motive
(continuing; yelling) Nine-thirty then
few people have gotten between them at the bar and she can't hear a word he's saying
She gives him one last look and heads back into the crowd
Patrick smiles
She didn't say no this time
- The crowd files out of the club, Kat and Mandella amongst them
^ they're walking toward the parking lot, Patrick coasts by in his truck
The gears
He yells out the window
What'd he say
Who cares
Mandella watches Kat as she stares after Patrick Has he importun'd you with love in honourable fashion
Kat glances sharply at her
(continuing; off her look) Don't be Cruella with me
'm in favor of romance
You're the one that wants to march on Washington every five minutes
Kat pokes her, then looks back at the club dreamily
Gigglepuss was so beyond
Mandella nods
They were
only wish William could have been here to witness the rebirth of punk rock with us
Kat links her arm through Mandella's and they head for the car
So true
- Cameron and Michael are at Michael's locker
So, then she says that she almost didn't wear the Kenneth Coles with that dress because she thought she was mixing, you know, genres
And the fact that  noticed -- and 'm quoting here - "really meant something
" Cameron looks At Michael expectantly You told me that part already
Hell, 've just been going over the whole thing in my head and - Joey appears over Cameron's shoulder
Hey
Dingo Boingo Cameron and Michael look at each other And turn around slowly (continuing; to Michael) hear you're helpin' Verona
Uh,  yeah
We're old friend* You and Verona
What
We took bathes together when we were kids
It's incredibly obvious that he's lying
Joey eyes him then turns to Cameron
What's your gig in all this
'm just the new guy
Joey turns back to Michael, grabbing the alligator on his shirt and twisting it
You better not fuck this up
'm heavily invested
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right
Joey lets go of Michael and  Cameron against a locker for good measure, as he walks away- Is it about me
'  - Kat sits outside waiting for her appointment, bored and annoyed
The door opens and Miss Perky escorts Patrick out You're completely demented
(cheery) See you next week
Kat stands and Patrick sees her
Miss Perky watches in horror You two know each other
/ Yeah/No
Miss Perky grabs Kat and shoves her into her office
(to Patrick) Dear God, stay away from her
If you two ever decided to breed, evil would truly walk the earth
Patrick gives Kat one last look before the door shuts, then smiles- - The lights are on, illuminating the yard /  - Bianca and Chastity stand outside Kat's room
is blaring and the door is shut
Bianca looks at her watch She's obviously not going
- Across the carpet, two pairs of teenage girl feet sneak past
Bianca and Chastity, teddy bear purses in hand
is heard
The girls freeze
Walter emerges from the kitchen with a mile-high sandwich The girls are like statues
Walter jumps
Daddy,  -- And where're you going
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends
Otherwise known as an orgy
It's just a party
Daddy, but  knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going -- She points to Kat -- Walkman blaring -- who comes downstairs, wearing a baby tee and battered Levis
Her relaxing-at-home look is about 400 times sexier than her at- school look
She wanders toward the kitchen
Walter directs his attention toward Kat
Do you know about any party
Katarina
Kat shrugs as she comes back out of the kitchen with an apple Daddy, people expect me to be there
If Kat's not going, you're not going
Bianca turns to Kat, eyes ablaze You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal,  can't be normal
What's normal
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that
What's a Bogey Lowenstein
Kat takes off her earphones, ready to do battle Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched
At least 'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig
Bianca tosses her hair
Like 'm supposed to know what that even means
It's Shakespeare
Maybe you've heard of him
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend
guess since 'm not allowed to go out,  should obsess over a dead guy, too
Girls Kat stares Bianca down know about the goddamn party
'm going
Bianca and Chastity look at each other, thrilled, and burst into gleeful screams
startled Walter clutches Bianca in a protective hug
Oh, God
It's starting
It's just a party
Daddy
Walter looks dazed
Wear the belly before you go
Daddy, no
Just for a minute He rushes to a cupboard and pulls out a padded faux- pregnancy belly
(continuing) want you to realize the weight of your decisions
He hangs the belly on her as she stands mortified
You are so completely unbalanced
Can we go now

att
net (to Bianca) Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present
Why
Because she'll scare them away
Kat stomps to the door, grabbing her car keys off the hall table and a sweater from the coat rack
She flings open the door and
There stands Patrick
Nine-thirty right
Kat's in shock (continuing) 'm early
She holds up her keys 'm driving
He peeks in behind her
Who knocked up your sister
'  - , a short Future  in a tux, greets his guests like a pro, handing out cigars and martinis
Nice to see you
Martini bar to the right, shots in the kitchen
The house is filled to capacity with Padua High's finest Kat pushes through the crowd
Patrick saunters in behind her '  - Joey lines up a row of shots amid much whooping and hollering within the jock crowd
Kat enters, then quickly tries to make an about face
Joey sees her and rushes over to block her, standing in the doorway
Lookin' fresh tonight, Pussy-Kat Kat gives him a death look and then stops and points at his forehead
Wait -- was that
-- Did your hairline just recede
He panics, whipping out a handy pocket mirror   She's already walking away
Where ya goin
Away
Your sister here
Kat's face shows utter hatred Leave my sister alone
(smirking) And why would  do that
sounds from the next room fight
The other jocks rush to watch as two Coffee Kids splash their cupfuls on each other
#1 That was a New Guinea Peaberry, you Folger's-crystals-slurping-buttwipe
Caffeinated fists fly
Joey slithers away from the door to watch, giving Kat one last smirk, just as Bianca walks into the kitchen
Just who  was looking for
He puts his arm around Bianca and escorts her out Bianca keeps walking, ignoring Kat pouring shots hands Kat one She downs it and accepts another
Drink up, sister
Patrick walks up What's this
(mocking) "'m getting trashed, man
" Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party
say, do what you wanna do
Funny, you're the only one She downs another
'   - Cameron and Michael enter
Cameron looks, around for his beloved, while Michael schmoozee with all in attendance and dishes dirt simultaneously
(high-fiving a jock) Moose, my man
(to Cameron) Ranked fifth in the state
Recruiters have already started calling
Cameron nods intently (continuing; grabbing his belt) Yo, Clem
(to Cameron) Patsy Cline fan, but hates the new Leanne Rimes
(with a Jamaican swagger) Ziggy, peace, bra
(to Cameron) Prefers a water pipe, but has been known to use a bong
Michael spots Bianca and Chastity, watching the skirmish, and points Cameron's body in her direction
(continuing) Follow the love, man Bianca cranes her neck Where did he go
He was just here
Who
Joey
Cameron walks over
Evening, ladies
Bianca turns and graces him with a pained smile
Hi
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh
Bianca ignores the question and tries to pawn him off You know Chastity
believe we share an art instructor Great Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron
Certainly Pabst
Old Milwaukee
RaiJieer
Bianca gives him a tense smile
Surprise me
He heads for the kitchen
Joey walks up and grabs her around the waist
She giggles as he picks her up and carries her off -- just as Cameron returns, a beer -- complete with a napkin and straw -- in his hand
Chastity glares with a jealous fury after Bianca and Joey, then gives Cameron the once-over and walks away
Michael appears
Extremely unfortunate maneuver
The hell is that
What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her
Buttholus extremus
But hey, you're making progress
No,  ' m not
He smacks himself in the head (continuing) She used me
She wants to go out with Dorsey
Not me
'm an idiot
Michael pats him on the shoulder
At least you're self-aware '  - Kat and a crowd of White Rastas and Cowboys stand in a drunken group hug singing " Shot the Sheriff"
Kat has another shot glass in hand
Patrick is showing a scar to an inebriated, enraptured cheerleader
He looks up at Kat and smiles meets his eyes then looks away
'   - Bianca stands next to Joey, sipping from her beer So yeah, 've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge
And then 'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week
Queen Harry
It's a gay cruise line, but 'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff
Bianca tries to appear impressed, but it's getting difficult
Neat
My agent says 've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year
He looks over her shoulder and waves at someone
Bianca takes the opportunity to escape
'll be right back
'  - Bianca shuts the door and leans on it with a sigh
Chastity applies lip-gloss in the mirror
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist mean
Dr
Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation
Is he oily or dry
Combination
don't know --  thought he'd be different
More of a gentleman
Chastity rolls her eyes Bianca,  don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding
Sometimes  wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know
All  know is -- 'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey
There's a  at the door
Bianca opens it to find a very drunken Kat
Bianca,  need to talk to you --  need to tell you -- (cutting her off) really don't think  need any social advice from you right now
Bianca grabs Chastity's arm and they exit '  -  - Patrick tries to remove a shot glass from Kat's hand
Maybe you should let me have it
Kat is fierce in her refusal to let go want another one Joey enters, grabbing Patrick by the shoulder, distracting him from his task
My man As Patrick turns, Kat breaks free and dives into the sea of dancing people in the dining room
(annoyed) It's about time
deal's a deal
He peels off some bills (continuing) How'd you do it
Do what
Get her to act like a human very drunken Kat jumps up onto the kitchen island and starts dancing by herself
She lets loose, hair flying
She's almost burlesque
Others form a crowd, clapping and cheering her on She swings her head around  it on a copper pot hanging from the rack above the center island
She starts to sway, then goes down as Patrick rushes over to catch her
The others , thinking this is a wonderful finale
Patrick sets her down on her feet, holding her up Okay
'm fine
'm She tries to push him away, but staggers when she does grabs her again, bracing her
You're not okay
just need to lie down for awhile Uh, uh
You lie down and you'll go to sleep know, just let me sleep What if you have a concussion
My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable
Not that  could tell the difference
She tries to sit on the floor Okay, 'll just sleep but stay awake, okay
He pulls her back to her 'mon, let's walk '   - As Patrick walks Kat through the dining room, Cameron  grabs his arm
We need to talk
Cameron, 'm a little busy It's off
The whole thing
Kat slides down to the floor and Patrick struggles to  get h back on her feet
What 're you talking about
She's partial to Joey, not me Patrick doesn't have time for this
Cameron -- do you like the girl
Sure (impatient) Then, go get her Patrick continues walking an oblivious Kat outside
Cameron stands there, unsure how to make use of this advice '  - Patrick marches Kat around the yard, holding her up This is so patronizing
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced
Why 're you doing this
told you You don't care if  die Sure,  do Why
Because then 'd have to start taking out girls who like me
Like you could find one See that
Who needs affection when 've got blind hatred
Just let me sit down
He walks her over to the swingset and plops her down in a swing, moving her hands to hang onto the chains
How's that
She sits and looks at him for a moment with a smile
Then over backward
(continuing) Jesus
You're like a weeble Patrick rushes to right her, then starts pushing her on the swing to keep her entertained
(continuing) Why'd you let him get to you
Who
Dorsey
hate him
know
It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila
You don't seem like the type
(holding up a drunken head) Hey man
You don ' t think  can be "cool"
You don't think  can be "laid back" like everyone else
(slightly sarcastic) thought you were above all that You know what they say He stops the swing No
What do they say
Kat is asleep, her head resting against the swing's chains
(continuing) Shit
He drags her to her feet and starts singing loudly
(continuing) Jingle Bells
Jingle Belles
Wake up damn it
He sits her down on the slide and shakes her like a rag doll
(continuing) Kat
Wake up
(waking) What
He sighs with relief
thought you were
They share some meaningful eye contact
And then she on his shoes
'  - Kat washes her face and grabs a bottle of Scope, taking a big swig
sounds at the door Go away Bianca opens the door and looks at her sister with the smuggest of all possible grins
Dinner taste better on the way out
Gives her a "don't even start" look
(continuing) don't get you
You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here
You're welcome
She pushes past her and leaves the bathroom
'  - Kat's in the driver's seat
Patrick leans in and takes the keys out of the ignition
Cute '  - Kids loiter on the lawn
Bianca and Chastity walk outside Joey catches up to them
bunch of us are going to Jaret's house
Wanna come
Chastity looks at Bianca, who wears a pained expression
She looks at her watch
have to be home in twenty minutes
(eagerly, to Joey) don't have to be home 'til two
Then, c'mon
(to Bianca) Maybe next time -- They head back into the party, leaving an astonished Bianca Cameron exits the party and stops when he sees Bianca standing alone
(slightly accusatory) Have fun tonight
Tons He starts to walk on (continuing) Cameron
He stops
She gives him a helpless smile
(continuing) Do you think you could give me a ride home
'  - Patrick drives as Kat sits in the passenger seat, fiddling with the radio dial
She finds a  she's happy with and Patrick quickly changes it
'm driving, so  get to pick the tunes
She changes it back to her song
It's my car
He changes it back
And 'm in control of it
But it's Gigglepuss -  know you like them
saw you there
Patrick doesn't have an answer for this, so he let's her listen to her song
(continuing) When you were gone last year -- where were you
Busy Were you in jail
Maybe
No, you weren't Then why'd you ask
Why'd you lie
He doesn't answer, but instead, frowns and turns up the music
She bobs her head drunkenly
(continuing) should do this
Do what
This
She points to the radio Start a band
(sarcastically) My father wouldn't approve of that that You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission
She turns to look at him
Oh, so now you think you know me
'm gettin' there Her voice loses it's venom The only thing people know about me is that 'm "scary"
He turns to look at her -- she looks anything but scary right now
He tries to hide his smile
Yeah -- well, 'm no picnic myself
They eye each other, sharing a moment of connection, realizing they're both created the same exterior for themselves
Patrick pulls into her driveway and shuts off the motor
He looks up at her house
(continuing) So what ' s up with your dad
He a pain in the ass
He just wants me to be someone 'm not
Who
No offense, but you're sister is without
know everyone likes her and all, but
Kat stares at him with new admiration
You know -- you're not as vile as thought you were
She leans drunkenly toward him
Their faces grow closer as if they're about to kiss And then Patrick turns away So, 'll see you in school Kat stares at him, pissed
Then gets out of the car, the door shut behind her
'  - Bianca and Cameron ride in silence
He finally breaks it
looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied"
(faux-innocence ) was
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you
Bianca bites her lip
(reluctant) Well, no
Then that's all you had to say
But You always been this selfish
thinks a minute He pulls up in front of the house Just because you're beautiful, doesn't mean you can treat people like they don't matter
She looks at him for a moment -- then grabs his face and gives him a kiss on the lips
He draws back in surprise, then kisses her back
She smiles, then gets out of the car without another word
Cameron grins and drives away (continuing) And 'm back in the saddle
- Kat sits at her desk, burying her face in a book as the others enter
The White Rastas are first
Kat, my lady, you sway to the rhythm of my heart
He grabs her hand and kisses it as she pulls it away
, a cowboy, enters, high-fiving Derek with new-found friendliness
Yippe kai-aye, bra
(to Kat) Dance for me, cowgirl
He sits next to Derek (continuing) Okay, now tell me again why he didn't shoot the deputy
Because the deputy meant him no harm, my friend
It was only the sheriff that was the oppressor
Joey saunters in and takes his seat
Kat, babe, you were on fire
Mrs
Blaise enters and sits at her desk Well now, did everyone have a good weekend
Maybe we should ask Verona Patrick enters, late, and slinks to his desk
Kat looks up, down and around, everywhere but at Patrick
Mrs
Blaise tries to remember what she's supposed to talk about
Okay then
Well
(beat) Oh, yes She clears her throat
(continuing) 'd like you all to write your own version of Shakespeare's Sonnet #141
Groans
(continuing) Any form you'd like
Rhyme, no rhyme, whatever
'd like to see you elaborate on his theme, however
Let's read it aloud, shall we
Anyone
The class is frozen in apathy
(continuing) Derek
Ms
Blaise hands him the sonnet
He shifts uncomfortably in his seat
Then grins
(reading; in his Rasta stoner drawl) In faith,  do not love thee with mine eyes/ For they in thee a thousand errors note/ But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise/ Who in despite of view is pleas 'd to dote
In the back of the room Clem raises his hand Ms
Blaise, can  get the bathroom pass
Damn if Shakespeare don't act as a laxative on my person
'    - Kat and Mandella scrape the peanuts out of their sauce
You went to the party
thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity
didn't have a choice
You didn't have a choice
Where's Kat and what have you done with her
did Bianca a favor and it backfired
You didn't got drunk
puked
got rejected
It was big fun
Patrick enters, walking to the counter to order
He sees Kat and smiles
Hey She gathers her things and bolts out the door
Patrick looks at Mandella, who shrugs and follows Kat
-  Cameron and Michael flank Patrick at his lab table So you got cozy with she who stings
No - 've got a sweet-payin' job that 'm about to lose
What'd you do to her
don ' t know
(beat) decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it
Michael and Cameron look at each other in realization, then turn back to Patrick
You realize this puts the whole operation in peril
No shit
She won't even look at me Why can't you just tell her you're sorry
Patrick's expression says that this is not a possibility
Michael makes a time out sign with his hands
'm on it - Mandella is at her locker
Drawings of William Shakespeare adorn the door
She looks at them with a sigh, then ties her silk scarf tightly around her neck, in an attempt to cut off her air supply
Michael walks up
Hey there
Tired of breathing
(shyly, as she loosens the scarf) Hi
Cool pictures
You a fan
Yeah
guess
rocks
Very hip
You think
Oh yeah
She looks at him suspiciously Who could refrain that had a heart to love and in that heart, courage to make '  love known
Michael thinks for a minute
Macbeth, right
(happily stunned) Right
Kat a fan, too
(puzzled) Yeah
He leans in close to her, conspiratorially So, listen
have this friend - Cameron sits next to Patrick on the bleachers as they watch Kat's practice
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns
That's a direct quote She just needs time to cool off 'll give it a day
flies at them from the field, narrowly missing their heads
(continuing) Maybe two
He looks at Cameron
(continuing) You makin' any headway
She kissed me
(eyebrow raised) Where
- Chastity rounds the corner and bends down to get a drink from the water fountain
Joey stands talking to two
The guys don't see her
Don't talk to me about the sweetest date
That little halo Bianca is gonna be prone and proven on prom night
Six virgins in a row
The cohorts chortle Chastity keeps drinking from the fountain - Joey leans against Patrick's Jeep
Patrick is inside
don't know, Dorsey
the limo
-the flowers
Another hundred for the tux -- Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit know
He pulls out his wallet and hands Patrick a wad of money (continuing) Take it Patrick does, with a smile, as he  out of the parking lot
- Kat and Mandella deface a prom flyer
Can you even imagine
Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess
Well,  guess we're not, since we don't have dates
Listen to you
You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica
Okay, okay, we won't go
It's not like have a dress anyway You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective
We're making a statement
(unconvinced) Oh, good
Something new and different for us
- Mr
Chapin patrols as boys and girls shoot arrows at targets Joey swaggers up to Bianca, who is taking careful aim
Chastity watches from across the row
Hey, sweet cheeks
(not looking at him) Hi, Joey
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class
She lets the arrow go and turns to look at him
(continuing) Listen,  want to talk to you about the prom
You know the deal
can ' t go if Kat doesn't go -- In the background, a  crumples to the ground
Hit casualty of Gym
Mr
Chapin scurries over
Your sister is going
Bianca looks at him, surprised Since when
Joey takes the bow and arrow from Bianca's hand
He draws back and takes aim
'm taking care of it
Chastity looks over from her spot on the field, but keeps lips firmly shut
- Kat browses through the feminist lit section Patrick appears, through a hole in the books
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique
lost my copy
(frowning) What are you doing here
heard there was a poetry reading
You 're so -- Pleasant
Kat stares at him, deadpan
(continuing) Wholesome
Unwelcome
Unwelcome
guess someone still has her panties in a twist
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties
So what did  have an effect on
Other than my upchuck reflex
Nothing
She pushes past him and heads out the' door Pat looks down at the book he's been holding in his hand: Taming of the Shrew
- Cameron  and Michael flank Patrick as he shovels food into mouth
You were right
She's still pissed
Sweet love, renew thy force
Man -- don't say shit like that to  me
People can hear you
(exasperated) You humiliated the woman
Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile
What's the worst
You get the girl
Patrick  thinks for a minute If  go down
'm takin' her with me - Kat and the other students sit at their desks, taking a quiz Patrick's seat is conspicuously empty
From outside, we hear the soft, unsure beginnings of a
Kat looks up, then out the window,
The song grows louder until we realize it's The Partridge Family's " Think  Love You"
Being sung by Patrick
(0
) "This morning,  woke up with this feeling,  didn't know how to deal with, and so  just decided to myself--" The  rush to the window
Patrick stands beneath the window, crooning
Scurvy is next to him, keeping the beat on the bongos and doing backup vocal s
"'d hide it to myself
And never talk about it
And didn't  go and shout it when you walked into the room --" He makes quite a sarcastic show of it
Mrs
Blaise touches her heart, as if the song is for her
Kat slowly walks to the window, peeking below
Patrick smiles at her as he finishes the verse with a big finale
(continuing) "  think  love you  " The other students laugh, clap, cheer, etc
Kat sinks down, mortified, but with a slight smile - Patrick and several other miscreants sit quietly, mulling over their misfortune
Nice song, Verona
Flog me
He makes the appropriate hand gesture Mr
Chapin, the gym teacher, sits at the desk in front, ignoring them while he reads a girly weightlifting magazine (0
) Excuse me, Mr
Chapin
Patrick looks up at the sound of her voice and sees Kat standing in the doorway
She gives him a smile and he perks up a little
Kat walks into the room and addresses Mr
Chapin again
He turns fully to face her
Sir, 'd like to state for the record that Mr
Verona ' s current incarceration is unnecessary
never filed a complaint
You didn't have to
He disrupted a classroom
Kat glances over at Patrick and motions her head toward the window
Patrick shrugs, not knowing what she ' s talking about
She motions again, and looks toward the window with an expression that says, "Make a break for it, moron
" Kat brings her attention back to Mr
Chapin while Patrick inches out of his seat toward the window
The other miscreants watch with glee
But, Mr
Chapin,  hardly think a simple serenade warrants a week of detention
There are far more hideous acts than off-key singing being performed by the student body on a regular basis
Patrick is halfway out the window now
And none too happy about it, considering they're on the second floor
He eyes a large  a few feet away from
He starts to turn away from Kat You're not gonna change my mind, Kat
Rules stick
Kat starts to panic, as Patrick has yet to make the jump for the tree
Wait, Mr
Chapin
There's something 've always wanted to show you
He turns back toward her again, the very second before he would have spotted Patrick
Kat glances toward the window
Patrick's just about to make the jump
What
These
From behind, we see her lift up her shirt and flash her bra at Mr
Chapin, just as Patrick makes the Jump
The miscreants cheer, for both the daring' escape and the flash of skin
Mr
Chapin reddens and tries to be stern
'm going to let that slide, Katarina
But if  catch you doing that again, you'll be in here with the rest of these guys
He motions to the remaining detention prisoners, without noticing Patrick's absence
Kat smiles at him
Thank you, Mr
Chapin
Kat bolts out the door
Mr
Chapin goes back to his muscle mag, wiping the sweat from his brow
Kat arrives at the tree
looking around breathlessly, seeing no one
He left
sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me
(0
) Look up, sunshine She does
He's still in the tree guess  never told you 'm afraid of heights
(smiling) 'mon
It's not that bad Try lookin' at it from this angle She assesses the branch structure Put your right foot there -- Forget it
'm stayin'
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down
(voice trembling) Maybe
She sighs and dose so
When she gets to his level, she perches on the branch next to him
He grins at her
Then swings himself down with the grace and ease of a monkey, leaving her sitting there, realizing she's been duped
You shit
She climbs down after him - Patrick and Kat walk amongst the games The Partridge Family
figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect
And piss you off
Good call
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way
dazzled him with my wit She stops and picks up a toy gun that  water at giggling hyenas and wails on it
The barker hands her a stuffed animal as her prize
She hands it to the small next to her and they continue walking
(sarcastic) soft side
Who knew
Yeah, well, don't let it get out So what's your excuse
Acting the way we do
Yes don't like to do what people expect
Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered
Something like that Then you screwed up How
You never disappointed me
She blushes under his gaze (continuing) You up for it
For
He motions to the  for a paint-ball game
She grins : The two of them creep through the paint-ball course, stealthy and full of the desire to best the other
Patrick nails Kat in the back with a big glob of red paint Kat gets him in the chest with a glob of blue
Patrick returns fire with a big yellow splat to the side of her face
Kat squirts a green shot to his forehead After a few more shots, they're both covered in paint She tries to shoot him again, only to find that her gun is empty
(continuing) Damn it
Patrick grabs her in a victorious tackle
They land, laughing
It's hard to even recognize them, as their hair and faces are so smeared with paint globs, but they still manage to find each other's eyes
He wipes a smear of blue paint away from her lips,  as he goes to kiss her
The kid with the stuffed animal, points Look, Mom His mother hurries him away
What's started as a tackle has turned into a passionate kiss - Patrick pulls up in Kat's driveway
Their paint wardrobe has dried by now and they look like refugees from some strange, yet colorful, war
State trooper
Fallacy
The duck
Hearsay
know the porn career's a lie
He shuts off the car and turns to her
Do you
He kisses her neck
It tickles
She laughs
Tell me something true
hate peas
No -- something real
Something no one else knows
(in-between kisses) You're sweet
And sexy
And completely hot for me
What
No one else knows You're amazingly self-assured
Has anyone ever told you that
Go to the prom with me Kat's smile disappears
Is that a request or a command
You know what  mean No
No what
No,  won't go with you Why not
Because  don't want to
It's a stupid tradition
Patrick sits quietly, torn
He can't very well tell her he being paid to take her
People won't expect you to go
Kat turns to him, getting angry
Why are you doing this
All of it -- what's in it for you
He sits silently, not looking at her, confirming her suspicions
(continuing) Create a little drama
Start a new rumor
What
So  have to have a motive to be with you
You tell me
You need therapy
Has anyone ever told you that
(quietly) Answer the question, Patrick (angry) Nothing
There's nothing in it for me
Just the pleasure of your company
He takes out a cigarette
She breaks it in half before she the car door and walks into the house
Patrick  out of the driveway
Kat turns at the front door and watches him go - Patrick pulls up to a stop light and waits for
the green He glances over at     in the median, who has decided that he doesn't need to wear pants
Patrick pulls out his wallet, takes the wad of money Joey gave him and hands it to the homeless guy
cover that up The light turns green and Patrick pulls away / - Kat stands at the sink, scrubbing paint off of her face Bianca  on the open door
Quick question -- are you going to the prom
Kat pushes the door shut with a - Cameron and Bianca sit together at their study cubby
She fingers a strand of her hair
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210
" No
Bianca stares at him for a moment
do you listen to this crap
What crap
Me
This endless
blonde babble
'm like, boring myself
Thank God
If  had to hear one more story about your coiffure
He mock stabs himself with a pencil as she giggles and smacks his hand away
(continuing) figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually
What good stuff
The "real you"
Like my fear of wearing pastels
He looks stricken
(continuing) 'm kidding
(beat) You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"
And you don't know how to quit
(matter of fact) No Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie
- Mandella struggles with the lock on her locker
Finally, it opens
Hanging inside is a beautiful , inspired by the 16th Century
Mandella slowly unpins a  from the dress
- "0 ,
" Mandella's agog
Trevor walks by and sees her holding the dress
You're gonna look splendiferous in that, Mandella
Mandella looks up sharply, shaken from her reverie
(continuing) that's cool to say
Mandella grins It is / - Sharon is at her computer, Walter at his exercise bike Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral
Pirate -- no question
Bianca enters and walks over to Walter Daddy,  want to discuss the prom with you
It's tomorrow night -- The prom
Kat has a date
No, but It's that hot rod Joey, right
That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for
He's not a "hot rod"
Whatever that is
You're not going unless your sister goes
End of story
Fine
see that 'm a prisoner in my own house
'm not a daughter
'm a possession
Bianca storms out
(calling out) You know what happens at proms
Sharon stops her typing and looks up at Walter They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home
Let her go
Kissing
Is that what you think happens
Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day
'  - Bianca lies on her bed
blares
sounds
Come in
Kat enters and sits down on the bed, muting the
(kindly) Listen,  know you hate having to sit home because 'm not Susie High School
Like you care
do care
But 'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s
wish  had that luxury
'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and can't go, because you won ' t
Kat clears her throat Joey never told you we went out, did he
What
In 9th
For a month (confused) Why
(self-mocking) He was, like, a total babe But you hate Joey Now  do
Back then, was a different story
As in
Kat takes a deep breath
He said everyone was doing it
So did it
You did what
(continuing on) Just once
Afterwards,  told him didn't want to anymore
wasn't ready
He got pissed
Then he broke up with me
Bianca stares at her, dumbfounded But After that,  swore 'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it
And  haven't since
Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display -- (stunned) Why didn't you tell me
wanted to let you make up your own mind about him
No
you didn't
If you really thought could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage
Kat stands up slowly That's not 'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes
guess  thought  was protecting you
God, you're just like him
Just keep me locked away in the dark, so  can't experience anything for myself Not all experiences are good, Bianca
You can't always trust the people you want to
guess 'll never know, will
She rises and holds the door open for Kat, then slams it behind her
- sprinkler cruises the lawn
'  - Kat lies in bed, staring at the ceiling
She rolls over and picks up the phone
'  - Bianca, still in her pajamas, eats a bowl of cereal while watching " Love Lucy" reruns
sounds Come in
Kat opens the door and peers in with a grin Feel like shopping
Bianca looks up, hopefully
- Walter and Sharon are in front of the television
Walter has the  Guide in hand, glasses on
What do you wanna watch
We've got crap, crap, crap or crap Dr
Ruth
Bianca walks into the living room
She's wearing a prom dress
Hi, Mommy
(looking away) Walter scurries takes off his glasses and looks from Bianca to Sharon
Honey, you look beautiful
You like
My date should be here in five
'm missing something
have a date, Daddy
And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know
The
Bianca runs to open it
There stands He takes in Bianca's outfit
Wow Let's go
Walter rises
Sharon pulls him back down on the couch (to Bianca) Have a great time, honey
But -- who -- what --
The door
As Sharon looks at Walter with a grin, a blur rushes down the stairs and out the door
The blur has Kat ' s voice
Hey, guys
'm going to the prom
See you in a few
The door  again
Walter and Sharon 'are alone What just happened
Your daughters went to the prom
Did  have anything to say about it
Absolutely not
That ' s what  thought The   again
Walter opens it to find Joey on the porch, wearing a tux
'm here to pick up Bianca
late He  the door shut - Kat pulls up in her car, emerging resplendent in an ice gown
Patrick sits on the steps, waiting
In a tux
How'd you get a tux at the last minute
It's Scurvy's
His date got convicted
Where'd you get the dress
It's just something  had
You know (smiling) Oh huh Look, 'm  -- sorry -- that questioned your motives
was wrong
Patrick winces slightly, but covers it with a smile No prob
He remains seated
Kat fidgets nervously
are you ready
He rises and stares at her, taking in her image appreciatively
She blushes and turns away
(continuing) 'mon
Let's get this over with
- hotel ballroom transformed into a fantasy world
Patrick and Kat enter, Kat attempting to deny the romance of it
Quite the ostentatious display cowboy two-steps by them, dragging some poor girl around Look, Clem even wore his good boots Kat steps forward, looking around and spots Cameron and Bianca dancing cheek to cheek
She smiles
Mandella enters nervously, in the long Elizabethan gown, hair piled on top of her head
She spots Kat and hurries over
Have you seen him
Who
William - he asked me to meet him here
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations
Patrick looks toward the door and taps Kat
She turns and points Mandella the same way
Michael - in full Shakespearean dress with a new goatee on his chin - bows in their direction
Mandella's grin couldn't be bigger
Michael swashbuckles over to them, taking Mandella's hand and leading her onto the dance floor
Mi' lady
(to Patrick) Good sir
Patrick rolls his eyes
-  - Kat and Patrick dance to a slow
Whatever he's whispering into her ear is making her laugh
Cam and Bianca dance nearby, glowing with happiness
She whispers something in his ear and heads for the ladies' room - Bianca walks in, positively radiant
Chastity emerges from a stall
(surprised) What are you doing here
Chastity checks her hair in the mirror,  aloof
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom
did
Chastity maintains her snooty tone
And just so you know, my date isn't planning on spending most of the night in his backseat
What're you talking about
Joey Dorsey is only after one thing - - your cherry
He practically made a public announcement
Appalled, Bianca storms out
Chastity  tries to backpedal
(continuing) wanted to tell you - Joey, drunk, disorderly and pissed off, walks in with a few stray jocks - also dateless
He zeroes in on Cameron, now consoling a pissed-off Bianca
Patrick and Kat continue to slow dance, oblivious to the evil about to erupt
My grandmother's
What
That's where  was last year
She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died --  stayed with her
wasn't in jail, don't know Marilyn Manson, and 've never slept with a Spice Girl
spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune
End of story
He takes a breath and looks away, not meeting her eyes
Kat stares at him for a moment and laughs a delighted laugh That ' s completely adorable
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook
He's interrupted by Joey's hand on his shoulder
What's Bianca doing here with that cheese dick
didn't pay you to let some little punk ass snake me
Michael spots the altercation and dances Mandella over to Cameron and Bianca
(to Cameron) Feces hitting fan
'mon Michael takes Cameron aside, leaving Mandella and Bianca staring after them
Michael and Cameron approach Joey as he continues to taunt Patrick who keeps quiet, realizing the weight of this situation
(continuing) Joey, pal, compadre
Let's take it easy
Joey turns toward Michael and Cameron
You two are in big trouble Cameron faces Joey
Admit it
You lost
Be a man
Joey  Cameron in the face, taking him by surprise Cameron holds his nose as it bleeds onto his tux The various cliques descend angrily and Joey is soon surrounded by seething Cowboys, Coffee Kids and White Rastas
Very uncool, my brother 'm not your brother, white boy
The other Rastas , as if stung by the realization that they're white
Joey turns back to Patrick and Kat
(continuing) Just so you know -- she'll only spread her legs once
Kat looks from Joey to Patrick, not sure what she's hearing
Joey pushes through the crowd but a  drags him back
It's Bianca
And she  the hell out of him That's for making my date bleed She  him again (continuing) That's for my sister
And (continuing) And that's for me
Cliques now descend on Joey, punching him wildly
And that's for the fourth grade, asshole
- runs down the stairs, Patrick chasing her Wait
You were paid to take me out
By -- the one person  truly hate
knew it was a set-up
It wasn't like that
Really
What was it like
down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me
didn't care about the money
He catches up to her now (continuing) cared about -- She turns to face him with a countenance more in sorrow than in anger
You are so not what  thought you were
He grabs her and kisses her to shut her up
After a second, she jerks away and flees down the stairs and out of sight
Bianca stands at the top of the stairs, watching
She's never looked more guilty
- Kat is sprawled on the couch in sweats, wrapped in a blanket, watching "Sixteen Candles"
When Molly Ringwald leans across the birthday cake to get a kiss from her dream date, Kat changes the channel disgustedly, settling for an infomercial The phone sits next to her
Not ringing
Bianca breezes in, bearing a cup of tea
Are you sure you don't want to come with us
It'll be fun
Kat takes the tea and gives a weak smile
' m sure
Bianca sits down next to her You looked beautiful last night, you know
So did you Bianca gives her a squeeze, then jumps up when the rings, opening the door to a waiting Cameron
He peeks his head inside
She okay
hope so
The door shuts behind her as Walter enters
Was that your sister
Yeah
She left with some bikers Big ones
Full of sperm
Funny
Walter sits down on the arm of the chair and watches the infomercial with Kat
(continuing) don't understand the allure of dehydrated food
Is this something should be hip to
No, Daddy
(dreading the answer) So tell me about this dance
Was it fun
Parts of it
Which parts
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy
Bianca did what
What's the matter
Upset that  rubbed off on her
No -- impressed
Kat looks up in surprise
(continuing) You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives
It means we've become spectators
Bianca still lets me play a few innings
You've had me on the bleachers for years
When you go to Sarah Lawrence,  won't even be able to watch the game
(hopeful) When  go
Oh, Christ
Don't tell me you've changed your mind
already sent 'em a check
Kat reaches over and gives him a hug -  Kat stands grabs a box of cornflakes from the food line
(0
) Katarina
She turns and looks at him 'd like to express my apologies
For what
(looking down) didn't mean for you to get -- When Bianca asked me to find you a boyfriend, had no idea it would turn out so -- ugly
would never have  done anything to compromise your - - - He trails off when he realizes she's thrown her food tray against the wall and marched off -- the old "kill, kill" look back in her eyes
- Kat stomps up the hallway, full of menace - Bianca's English teacher perches on the edge of a desk, open book in hand
Who can tell me at what point Lucentio admits his deception
The door of the classroom  open and an angry Kat stalks in, yanking Bianca from her chair and dragging her toward the hallway
(to the teacher) Family emergency
- Bianca tries to pull away as Kat drags her by the hair between two rows of lockers
Let go
You set me up
just wanted -- What
To completely damage me
To send me to therapy forever
What
No
just wanted Miss Perky walks up Ladies
Shall we take a trip to my office
'  - Miss Perky stares at both sisters as they sit before her, then focuses on Bianca
So you're the real bitch Yes
Okay
Yes -- 'm the real bitch
wanted her to get a boyfriend so could
Apparently, this makes me a horrible person
'm sorry
She turns to Kat
(continuing) swear --  didn't know about the money
didn't even know Joey was involved
would never intentionally hurt you, Kat
(to Kat) Do you care to respond
Am  supposed to feel better
Like, right now
Or do  have some time to think about it
Just smack her now
Bianca rises, taking Kat by the arm
(to Miss Perky) We'll be getting back to you
What, no hug
- And Bianca leave Miss Perky's office Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me
It's just you
- Mrs
Blaise faces the class All right
'm assuming everyone found time to compose, their poems
Except for Mr
Dorsey, who's still in
Nerds in the back high-five each other
(continuing) Would anyone care to read theirs aloud
No one moves
Then Kat slowly stands up
'11 go Patrick looks up
Oh, Lord
She downs a couple Prozac (continuing) Please proceed
Kat stands, puts on her glasses, and takes a deep breath before reading from her notebook
hate the way you talk to me/ and the way you cut your hair/  hate the way you drive my car/  hate it when you stare
She pauses, then continues (continuing) hate your big dumb combat boots/ and the way you read my mind/  hate you so much it makes me sick/ it even makes me rhyme
She takes a deep breath, and looks quickly at Patrick, who stares at the floor
(continuing) hate the way you're always right/ hate it when you lie/  hate it when you make me laugh/ even worse when you make me cry/  hate it that you're not around/ and the fact that you didn't call/ But mostly  hate the way  don ' t hate you/ not even close, not even a little bit, not even any at all
She looks directly at Patrick
He looks back this time
The look they exchange says everything
Then she walks out of the room The rest of the class remains in stunned silence
- Kat walks to her car alone
When she opens the door, she's greeted with a Fender Stratocaster guitar, reclining in the front seat
She picks it up slowly, inspecting every detail, then spins around
Patrick stands there, smiling
Fender Strat
You bought this
thought you could use it
When you start your band
She doesn't answer, but hides a smile, so he walks  closer
(continuing) Besides,  had some extra cash
Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl
Is that right
Yeah, but then  fucked up
fell for her
Blushes and looks down
(continuing) You know -- it's not every day you find a girl who'll flash her tits to get you out of detention
Looks up
surprised and embarrassed that he found out He takes her upturned face as a sign to kiss her and he does She lets him this time
Then breaks it off You can't just buy me a guitar every time you screw up, you know
He grimaces
know He quiets her with another kiss Which she breaks off again
And don't just think you can He kisses her again, not letting her end it this time
- We hear the sounds of  and
/ - Patrick is at the barbecue grill, flipping burgers
Kat watches
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill
Because  like to torture you
Oh, Bianca
Can you get me my freshman yearbook
Don ' t you even dare
As they argue on the patio
They do to
They do not
Rises to get the yearbook
Can someone please tell her that sunflower seeds come from sunflowers
Severely making-out in a lawn chair
She comes up for a breath
can't remember a word of Shakespeare right now
Isn't that weird
Michael pulls her back down for another round She tries to keep him from grabbing the yearbook that Bianca now hands her
You're freaked over this, aren't you
Bianca hands her the yearbook He's more than freaked
He's froke Flips to a page
'd like to call your attention to Patrick Verona's stunning bad-ass look of 1995 --- -  horrifically nerdy freshman year picture Glasses, bad hair, headgear -- the works
She holds up the picture for all to view
Patrick cringes and throws a handful of pretzels at her
Patrick -- is that- a
Perm
Ask my attorney
Kat and Bianca huddle over the picture, giggling --  as we and hear a   version of The Partridge Family's " Think  Love You"
