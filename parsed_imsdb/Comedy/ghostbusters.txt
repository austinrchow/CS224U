"Poultrygeist
" by Duane Capizzi and Steven Roberts Last revised May 12, 1988 ------- : --       -- On the farmhouse roof a -  stands silhouetted against a , -
The wind  and the vane swivels with an
Then a weird   is heard--a cross between a chicken  and a wolf
() (  ) : fenced-in dirt area with numerous  milling around,  as they peck at the ground
() ( , nearer now) The chickens' heads jerk up toward the sound
'  -- -tinted, shaky,   - on the chickens
(These shots are in the style of the   in
)  Magnified  and of Werechicken is heard
() (,  ) The terrified chickens stare   as the Werechicken moves closer, his shadow falling over them
They flap into their coop, wildly
--    -- and  sit on the sagging couch watching a werewolf movie on while munching popcorn from a huge bowl
They're distracted by Sump'n's stirrin' up the chickens, Maude
Jes' set easy, Zeke
(she rises; heads for door) 'll take a look-see
Zeke continues staring at
--  -- ' Through the Werechicken's red eyes, we see a distant image of Maude with a flashlight, approaching the fenced-in chicken pen and opening the gate
toward Maude as she enters, leaving gate open
() (,  ) The dirt compound is empty now as Maude crosses toward wooden chicken coop
(as she goes) Here, chick-chick-chick-chick
-- Maude  from   , her flashlight beam illuminates the chickens cowering on their roosts in a corner
They  nervously
What's got you girls so durned upset
There a coyote sneakin' 'round
Suddenly the Werechicken's shadow moves up Maude's back, then the wall
() (Low, gutteral -) Maude looks over her shoulder  , reacts
(
) '  -- Red-eyed, grotesque, three times the size of an ordinary rooster as it stands framed in the moonlit doorway
It opens its fanged beak in a horrifying  as it springs  , wings flapping
(Frightening ) - Old black-and-white movie
as a man turns into a werewolf, his  a continuation of the previous Werechicken
(eerie ) - continues watching  and eating popcorn
Maude walks stiffly into room behind him, eyes staring blankly
(without looking up) Everythin' okay out there, Maude
-- She stares with glassy, red eyes and  quietly
- () () What say
below Maude's waist to reveal that she's turning into a chicken from the feet up
First her shoes  apart as large, yellow chicken feet sprout
Then her dress  and , revealing a large, feathered body underneath
The only piece of clothing left on her is her apron
One foot scratches the floor
- () (more ) --   - Now completely transformed and six feet tall, she leaps up to perch on back of couch,  her chicken head repeatedly into the popcorn bowl in Zeke's lap, pecking the bowl clean
Zeke's jaw hangs open, speechless, as he stares at the fanged, drooling, six-foot Werechicken
The Werechicken looks up from the empty bowl, right in Zeke's terrified eyes
() He scrambles backwards off the couch
--  - ' -tinted
We hear loud  from within house as chicken feathers fly out the open windows
() () Get away
' Scat
Shoo
- () (loud ) -- Watching from slight hilltop
Its beak seems to bend into an insidious grin
() (from distance) Help
He-elp
: --   - As   , we hear: () Egon, could you hold off on the weather balloon bit for a minute
: --  -- They stand holding big plastic bags of trash, obviously annoyed at the Egon
Ray's armful of trash is piled so high that he can't see over it
hovers behind, sticking his nose in one of the bags like a dog
He finally dives right into it
() It's Your night to take out the trash
And Winston's in the kitchen doing your dishes
He's busy testing his  --a large, pink bubble half the size of the room
He moves a lever on its remote control unit and the balloon rises
(preoccupied; through above) Be with you in
(checks watch) one minute, fifty-three seconds
Peter and Ray exchange pained glances
Peter awkwardly attempts to pick up another trash bag while Ray stumbles around, his vision blocked as they move toward door when Egon's weather balloon suddenly lowers
They bounce into and off of it, which sends the trash bags flying
(-  as they bounce off balloon) Peter stumbles backwards and lands butt-first right on one of the bags
Slimer  from within it
() (big muffled ) Then he comes shooting out the back of the bag, the lower half of his body flat as a Frisbee
shakes himself off like a dog, spraying slime all over Peter
(pissed; sarcastic) Thanks, Slimer
really needed that
Sorreee
Ray helps Peter up as the telephone  and
(irritated) Egon
The phone
The  phone is right beside him on the workbench
(preoccupied with remote controls) In a minute, Ray
He  with sleeves rolled up, wiping a plate with a dish towel and wearing an apron
(sarcastic) Nevermind, Egon, wouldn't want you to strain yourself
(picks up phone) Ghostbusters Central
(excited ) Calm down
Where are you
(a  as he listens) We'll be right there
He hangs up
Peter and Ray again have their arms full of trash bags
Even Slimer is dragging one
Ready for this one
Some farmer says his wife was eaten by a giant chicken
Hey, even a half-baked false alarm sounds better than doing Egon's chores
(he drops trash bags) Let's roll
Ray and Slimer also abandon their trash bags and  with Peter and Winston
still oblivious as he works in the suddenly empty room
think 've finally perfected it
Watch this, guys
(a , he looks around over shoulder) Guys
: --   -  - -1 roars  , siren and lights going
--  1 -- The Ghostbusters, minus Egon, are wearing their gear
Slimer hovers in back seat
It sure feels strange not having Egon with us
(sarcastic) Why
Lately even when he's with us, he's not with us
Driving
But wouldn't it be somethin' if he sells that weather balloon idea of his
He'll be a rich man
Arms folded, grumpily
Good
Then he can hire a maid to do his share of the chores
--  1 -- As it speeds    toward distant farmhouse,    the apron-wearing Maude-Chicken silhouetted in the moonlight, nesting in a haystack
-- - Her body starts to shake, she ruffles her wings
- (Egg-laying ) Then she suddenly sits up and leaps off the haystack, revealing an enormous egg beneath her
Maude  and  and struts off into a cornfield, pecking away at ears of corn
- ( and ) : --    -- Ray, Winston and Slimer listen seriously as Zeke speaks, but Peter's obviously not buying it
Had big blood-red eyes, it did
Biggest dang chicken  ever seen
Mebbe six feet tall
Peter rolls his eyes
Shouldn't be hard to find
is jotting info on notepad
Did it have any distinguishing marks
Ray
It's six feet tall
Peter grabs Ray's arm, starts ushering him to front door
() (over shoulder as he goes) Thank you, Sir
We'll put out a missing chicken report right away
- As the three Ghostbusters and Slimer cross toward Ecto-1 parked in front
(as they go) This one's easy, guys
Old Zeke's been watchin' too many horror movies and eating too much greasy popcorn
-- No, Peter,  think we're dealing with a bonafide werechicken here
Peter and Winston stop, look at Ray in disbelief
werechicken
Get serious, Ray
Then explain those
Ray points at ground
Peter, Winston and Slimer look down
Peter is standing with both feet in two enormous chicken footprints
: --   -- The three Ghostbusters follow Maude's "chicken" tracks with powerful flashlights across a field spotted with haystacks
Slimer moves ahead, nose to ground like a bloodhound
( as he goes) He floats along above the flashlight-illuminated tracks which lead him right into the haystack
We hear a  from within, then: () Ow
Slimer backs    rubbing his head
He looks up and his eyes pop wide
(amazed
) The Ghostbusters   and play their flashlights across the huge egg sitting atop the haystack
(excited) What'd  tell you, Peter
werechicken egg
Gimme a hand, Winston
As Ray and Winston ease the egg down off the haystack
Peter holds his meter up to it
Look, if this is a werechicken egg, -- Nothing registers on the meter
() how come there's no  reading
Ray and Winston still hold giant egg
(looking at meter in Peter's hand) dunno
that is strange
Let's get it back to Headquarters and run some tests
Then maybe we'll have some answers
Oh no, 'm not leavin'
The werechicken that laid this has gotta be around here someplace -- and 'm gonna find it
(throws up his hands with heavy ) 'll take it
'mon, Slimer
They take egg from Ray and Winston and start back toward Ecto-l
() (shaking his head; as he goes) Werechickens
' Through its   we see, from a distance, Peter and Slimer carrying the egg, Ray and Winston moving off in other direction
() ( & ) : --   -  - Egon still busy with his balloon as Peter and Slimer carry egg in through door
(through above) Yo, balloon man, we've got some real work for you:  How about analyzing this
Egon looks around, reacts to egg
Interesting
That's the second biggest egg 've ever seen
Peter and Slimer set egg on Egon's desk
don't wanna hear about it, Egon
We've had a long night in a not-too-fragrant barnyard, so 'm taking a shower and hitting the sheets
Peter  as Slimer  in close beside Egon, elbows on desk, chin in hands, eyeing Egon and egg expectantly
Egon pushes glasses up off tip of nose and blinks at egg, not sure what to do with it
on egg and we -- - : --      -- from full moon to reveal the tiny figures of Ray and Winston approaching an old barn
They stop, shining their flashlights on closed main door
(tired) Ray, it's gettin' pretty late
Maybe there really isn't any
(holds up one hand) Shh
Ray extends his  meter toward barn
It  incessantly
(low voice) It's in there
(unclipping his blaster) Then let's get it
--      -- ' Through its   we see the barn door slowly  open, revealing Ray and Winston peering in
-- They  cautiously, Ray holding his  meter out before him
The barn is dark except for the moonlight slanting through the loft window and the beams of their flashlights
As the  picks up,  , , and a piece of  machinery turns with a
() Man, this place is creepy
() It's in here --  can feel it
Suddenly the door  shut behind them and the through the darkness
Winston
Look out
Ray shines his flashlight toward the lofts
Its beam catches a couple of startled pigeons as they fly out the window, pinion feathers
-- & (relieved ) ' -, moving slowly toward Ray and Winston from behind
() ( ) They stop as  meter starts
Ray checks the reading
(whisper) Something's close
Very close
' Closing on Ray and Winston
() ( ) The guys wheel around
We see only its face
The blood-red eyes stare menacingly, its fanged beak slightly open and drooling
(  ) -- It hops forward into a streak of moonlight
It's three feet tall, its wings hang out at the sides, and its evil, blood-red eyes stare at
() ( ) () It is a werechicken
and Backing away, blasters leveled
Man, he is ugly
It postures, rooster-like and: ( angrily) and Still backing up
Bad choice of words, Winston
suddenly leaps
(loud  ) ' - on Winston and Ray
They open fire
The proton streams catch the Werechicken in mid-air as it vaults toward Ray and Winston, halting its leap and suspending it in a corona of proton energy
() rises from its writhing body -- shapeless, but with monstrous glowing eyes and fangs
The spirit lets out a  more frightening than the Werechicken howl
(big ) Ray, still firing his gun, snaps a trap loose from his belt, and tosses it onto the barn floor
It  open
Trap out
Ray and Winston, struggling with the writhing Spirit caught in the streams, guide the Spirit into the trap
Hang on
That's it
We've almost got him
The Spirit is sucked into the trap, which  shut
-- normal chicken with singed feathers stands where the Werechicken was
It , starts pecking at the dirt
(Normal ) (looking at chicken) Well, that takes care of one werechicken
Ray picks up the smoking trap
() Now to find the six-footer that ate Zeke's wife
They head for the door
Winston stops
Ray,  just had a thought
Ray pauses to look around at Winston
() What if that six-foot werechicken is Zeke's wife
And off their looks, we -- : --   - -- Egon carries the big egg into kitchen, Slimer helping
(straining) Thanks for the help, Slimer, but  don't have time to examine this egg tonight have to prepare for my weather balloon demonstration tomorrow morning
With his elbow, Egon opens refrigerator with and the two of them place the giant egg inside
() (through above) But it'll be safe in here
Yeah
Egon closes fridge
(big ) 'night, Egon
Slimer floats off
Goodnight, Slimer
: -- Slimer is , hovering above Peter's empty bed
() In a  above him, we see Slimer's , various kinds of food dancing and  the first two bars of Los Lobos' " " a la the California Raisins in " Heard It Through The Grapevine
"  Still asleep, Slimer licks his lips hungrily, opens his mouth incredibly wide and pounces on the entire dream balloon with a teeth-jarring
that the dream bubble so that it  inside his mouth, waking him up
Slimer sits up with a wide-eyed, hungry look, rubbing his tummy
Fooooood
He zips o
s
-- Dark
Lights go on, then Slimer  to mid-air stop and whips open fridge
His eyes pop as he sees the egg
(licking his lips) Yummy
Slimer rolls egg toward edge of shelf, then the full weight of the egg drives Slimer straight to the floor
The egg bounces on his stomach twice before he gets a grip on it
Straining his little green brains out, he floats the egg up into the air and o
s
(, then ) Slimer shoves egg in the open oven, closes door, turns on the heat, then moves
The oven interior glows red and the egg starts to quiver
Slimer  as he busily sets table for one:  placemat, a plate, utensils, salt, pepper, ketchup, mustard, mayo, relish,
a flurry of activity that all focuses on his personal eating spot
( through above) Through window we see the egg shake and then begin to crack open
Hovering at table, still preparing for feast
He puts on a bib, unaware of oven shaking behind him
(still ) With a loud , the oven practically explodes and the door flies off
Out pops a  ,  and
(, ) His eyes bug and his paw drops
(startled ) Slimer barrels up through sink faucet, leaving his bib stuck in the opening
-- Peter shampooing his hair
(  ) Slimer comes shooting out through shower nozzle, hugs Peter tightly around the neck and scaring the hell out of him
(startled ; then:) Slimer
How 'bout some privacy
(pointing, eyes wide) Monster
Inna kitchen
Monster
(nods) Uh-huh
Uh-huh
(imitates werechicken) ( & ) -- Egon works at his table
now familiar Werechicken shadow appears over his shoulder and grows up the wall
- Werechicken creeps   , bites Egon on the rear and pulls back o
s
, chicken claws  off into distance
(looking around) Ow
() ( fading into distance) Dazed, he looks down at his feet
' Chicken toes pop through the leather, one at a time
() (dazed) What
As Egon's transformation continues:  His coveralls  apart at the legs, then midriff, then his arms turn into wings
Finally, a beak sprouts from his face
- (Weird ) : -- Peter (now dressed and wearing his backpack) runs up to lab door and flings it open, Slimer right behind him
Peter and Slimer look in, not seeing Egon, who is now a six-foot-tall werechicken, but still wearing his glasses, standing behind door
() Egon
(to Slimer) Well, Slimer,  don't see anything here that looks like a monster
The Egon-Chicken jumps out right in front of Peter and Slimer
- ( ) Slimer freaks and rockets right through the nearest wall
( as he goes) Holy cow
Peter raises his proton gun
- He flaps his wings wildly, his red eyes bulging, and , revealing impressive fangs
- ( ) ----------- ------- --   -- Egon the Werechicken moves toward Peter, fangs bared in attack mode
- ( as he goes) He steps back into doorway, blaster leveled at Egon-Chicken, and  on the power
It  to life
(horrified) What'd you do to Egon, you bird-brain
() Peter
Wait
hand grabs Peter by the arm fust as the thrower fires, sending the proton stream off at an angle into ceiling, barely missing the chicken
(surprised as he looks around) Hey
as Ray pulls Peter out into corridor, Winston kicks door shut in the Egon-Chicken's snarling face and quickly locks it
Slimer hovers nearby looking worried
- () () The door  and  as the unseen Egon-Chicken tries to break through
(irritated; through above) What's wrong with you guys
That thing ate Egon
Peter, that is Egon
The egg hatched, he was bitten and now he's a werechicken
The door behind them is starting to splinter and bulge from the battering of the Egon-Chicken
(looking at door) You're kidding
(a , then) Come to think of it, there was a certain resemblance
Suddenly the battering stops
(looking toward door) What happened
He's so quiet all of a sudden
Looking toward o
s
window, he reacts
It's the moon
He hurries o
s
Ray stops at window, looks out
Beyond we see the full moon
Peter, Winston and Slimer come up behind him
() Tonight's the first -- It's beginning to disappear, right to left
()() -- lunar eclipse in ten years
All looking out window as eclipse continues Ray, what's this have to do with Egon being a chicken
(turning to others) Werechickens only appear during a full moon, and for the next few minutes, the moon's not full
-- Door opens and Ray pecks in
(tentative) Egon
Seen from the waist up (he's not wearing clothes), looking around, confused
He sees Ray
Ray, what is going on
Egon is holding his tattered coveralls in front of his waist, like a skirt
() And why am  naked
Suddenly Slimer flies   and gives Egon a big, sloppy kiss
(as he enters) Egon
( ) Sit down, Egon, we have some good news and some bad news
(as he sits) Bad news first
You've been turned into a werechicken
His glasses slip to the end of his nose as his eyes widen
He pushes them back up
werechicken
He hurriedly thumbs through the
(flipping through book) Were-aardvarks
were-bears werechickens
(reads) "The werechicken appears during the full moon
Anyone it bites will turn into another werechicken
" (he looks at Egon) That egg Peter brought in, it hatched and
He rubs his rear
(through above) remember the bite clearly
How long will stay like this
,  and Looking at the Tobin Guide
(looking in Tobin's Guide) According to this, there is an antidote
But we've gotta move fast -- the eclipse only lasts three minutes
Slimer scrambles through the cupboard, grabbing various bottles of stuff, and hands them to Winston who adds ingredients to mixing bowl and stirs while Ray reads from Tobin's Guide
(reading through above) "One tablespoon paprika, one clove of garlic, some parsley for color, cup of gelatin
" Through it we see the eclipsed moon starting to emerge from shadow
-- His pupils look constricted and he's perspiring
(weakly) don't feel well
Peter steps  , puts arm around Egon's shoulders
(through above) Take it easy, Egon
You're gonna be fine
(
; worried) Hurry it up, guys
-- (reading hurriedly) "And one tablespoon of chickenbane
" He rummages through shelves, then looks down at Ray
(aghast) No chickenbane
Ray and winston exchange panicky looks
Then we've gotta go with this
'mon
They run  with the mixing bowl of liquid
Slimer follows
--   ' They're once again turning into chicken legs and chicken feet
Toes popping out like popcorn
() () Come on, Ray
As Peter and Egon stare down at the chicken legs and chicken feet
() ( o
s
) He's changing again
Ray, Slimer and Winston rush
(breathless) Quick, Egon, drink this
Winston hands the bowl of potion to Egon, who gulps it down
(swallowing, sounds) As Egon drinks, his arms transform into wings and he drops the bowl, breaking it
We're too late
-- As the transformation  and feathers  rise up  his shoulders
Suddenly, the transformation  stops at  the neck
, too
, , They stare, wide-eyed
After   -- What happened
To include Egon, who is once again a six-foot-tall chicken, but with Egon's own neck and head
The potion only partly worked, because of the missing chickenbane
Well, we hafta do something
Don't get your feathers ruffled, Peter
There's a logical solution to every problem
() () Strands of slime stand straight up on the nape of Slimer's "neck" at the sound -- like a frightened cat -- and he dives into a test tube in a rack on Egon's workbench
( as he goes) looking around
What was that
The werechicken that bit Egon
It's still out there somewhere
(to others) Let's stop that thing before it makes drumsticks out of anyone else
(to Egon) Un, no offense, Egon
The three normal Ghostbusters dash toward door
: --   --  -- -2 glides over the city, running lights blinking
-- -2 -- Peter at the controls
Slimer sits beside him, looking down at the city through binoculars
(into radio mike) All quiet on the chicken front
How about down there
-- -1 -- Winston driving
Ray on the radio
Not a peep
(gives Ray a dirty look) No pun intended
- Several people run out front door  as -1 passes
( as they exit) -- -1 - Winston and Ray look back at exiting people
That's it
Winston cranks the wheel
-1 As it makes a  -turn
-- Ecto-1  up, doors open, and Ray and Winston leap out, blasters at the ready, running toward store entrance
-- Ray and winston run in and stop inside door beside a panicked   who points o
s
(breathless) It's in there
big chicken
It's gotta be ten feet tall
Ray and Winston exchange glances
Ten feet tall
(nods) Maybe fifteen,  dunno
Big
(he runs o
s
) 'm outta here
(to Winston) Let's split up
They run off in opposite directions, flanking the long aisles
him as he cautiously moves along, aisle by aisle
At far end of aisles, Winston can be seen doing the same
The market is thrashed, spilled groceries everywhere
As they reach the last aisle
No chicken
Ray joins Winston
How could we lose a fifteen foot-tall chicken
() (frightened ) We didn't
Come on
They hurry o
s
-- He's hiding under his butcher block, trembling
Ray and Winston run The Butcher looks up, eyes wide
giant chicken just came through here -- it was thirty feet tall
Thirty feet tall
The Butcher is pointing out open door
Beyond is a parking lot with a trail of crushed cars right down the middle
() Yeah
Look what it did to those cars
Ray and Winston race out the door
-   -2  -- The little chopper, lights blinking, skims low past three-and four-story buildings
() (into radio) It's how big
Okay, Ray,  admit you were right about these Werechickens,
-2 -- Peter and Slimer, as before
() but  definitely don't buy them growing to the size of buildings
(covers mouth, through his closed, flapping lips
"How absurd
") Suddenly, the head of the Werechicken rears up   right in front of Ray and Slimer
() (deafening ) -2 is buffeted about by the howl as Peter jams the stick forward
-2 It makes a steep, banking dive and gets the hell out of there, barely escaping the big Werechicken's beak that  shut on thin air just behind Ecto-2's retreating tail
-- -2 -- Peter is shaken, but in control
Slimer is trembling like green Jell-
(into mike) Ray, you were right
The chicken's here, and he's a walking high-rise
-- -1 --  -- (into radio) On our way, Peter
Winston floors it and he and Ray accelerate forward
--   - Egon is "perched" on the window sill, looking pensively out at the city, still a chicken from the neck down
, then: () (big ) (startled ) Startled, Egon flutters up off the sill, gravity takes over, and he lands on his feathered butt
Revealing Janine standing frozen in the doorway, eyes wide with disbelief, hands to her cheeks
Egon
What happened
It's a long story, Janine
Can you get my coat, please
'm due at the weather board in forty-five
() minutes
She stares at Egon, totally bewildered
But what
(thinks better of asking) Nevermind
Janine takes a long yellow raincoat off a door hook and helps him into it
He's completely covered except for his head and feet
Are you sure you wanna go to a meeting like -- this
Trust me
'm of sound mind at least
As he struts toward the door, we see his tail protruding through a slit in the back of coat
He ,
( as he goes) Staring after him in disbelief
-  -- It walks along stepping on cars, kicking over telephone poles, etc
, a la Godzilla
The streets
Panicky pedestrians flee the Werechicken's giant feet
(panicky ) -- -2 -- Peter and Slimer are following giant chicken
(into radio) It's heading down 34th toward the Empire State Building
--   -- Ecto-1  around a corner,  blaring
() Check
We're almost there
-- Sun rises behind the werechicken as it approaches in distance
With each , the streets
() () -1 Approaching  fast, it  to a halt
Doors fly open
Ray and Winston  out, open fire, their proton streams angling upward
- Moving toward them down the concrete canyon, flattening street lamps and power poles
Ecto-2 can be seen flying above and behind it
The proton streams are up toward it
-2 Take over, Slimer
Roger
Slimer grabs the control stick in both hands as Peter leans out to one side with his blaster and fires downward
Caught in the three crossing streams
It  about, knocking over street lights and bashing in the sides of buildings, and lets out a deafening
emerges from its body and fills the screen like a transparent film
(enraged ) Ray tosses out the trap
Let's reel him in
As Ray, Winston and Peter's beams draw the Spirit toward the trap
(angry ) Ray's boot stomps on trigger and trap springs open
As the Spirit comes into contact with the trap a small   around it
and fly
-like
Being buffeted by wind, struggling to hang onto their throwers as they continue firing
They have to  over the
(loud) Trap's full
Somebody forgot to empty it
-2 The wind is really bouncing it around
Slimer has his hands full, while Peter continues shooting
() Whose job was it
turn to each other
'
Light  rapidly
Trap begins to shake and glow
() It's gonna blow
-- -2 () (over walkie-talkie) Peter, get outa here
It banks, gets the hell away
turn off their proton guns and are  down by the released force as the freed Monstrous Spirit whooshes skyward
The  abruptly disappears, as if  up
The trap stops shaking and  shut
As the Spirit  back into its body,  it
Its chicken face contorts with new
() It turns and starts up the side of the Empire State Building
- The werechicken is halfway to the top
to reveal Peter, Slimer, Winston and Ray standing in street looking up at him
Ecto-1 and 2 are behind them
So how're we gonna, put that big bird on ice, guys' ( finger) Peter, that's not a bed idea
Chicken freezes at very low temperatures
Yeah, but how do you freeze a 50-foot chicken in August
, then the three guys look at each other
,  & Egon's weather balloon
--   -- Not far from the Empire State Building
Egon stands before a group of seated  and  --   -- in his rain coat
To one side, the weather balloon hovers above them
Distinguished members of the Weather Board, my weather balloon has the clu-cluck-clu- capability -- The top of the Empire State Building is visible behind him as he holds the small weather device control box in one winged hand
() of entering the upper atmosphere where clu-cluck-clu cloud formations occur
They look at each other, puzzled
(puzzled  ) ()() There, it can electronically alter weather cut-cut-cut-con-ditions to produce sun, rain, or
(
) snow
Ecto-2 ascends into view behind him and hovers, the chopper's rotors blowing Egon's raincoat up over his head, exposing the chicken body underneath
Their mouths drop open as they stare at Egon's chicken body
(excited ) He pulls raincoat down off his face, holding it in place with one hand as he looks at audience with forced smile
(to Board members) , er, can explain this, but -- Slimer flies   beside Egon and  in his ear
( ) What
He looks around to where Slimer is pointing
' As the Werechicken climbs into view, scaling the upper stories of the Empire State Building
(distant ) The Weather Board members see the Werechicken and start to
() He  onto a rope ladder hanging from Ecto-2 and climbs inside
Slimer flies in right behind him and Ecto-2 rises up
-- -2 -- Egon settles into passenger seat
Slimer hovers behind them
(loud over engine) Egon, can we freeze that big chicken with your weather balloons (holds up wings) Yes, but you'll have to work the controls
(nods) Piece of cake
-- -2 -- It banks off toward the Empire State Building as the Werechicken reaches the top of the spire
As it gets "comfortable" on the spire, fluffing its feathers
It begins to quiver (like Maude did earlier when she laid an egg)
(hideous ) On street below, looking skyward through binoculars
What's it doing
It looks like it's about to lay an -- Winston puts a hand over Ray's mouth
(with dread) don't want to hear it
It rises from weather bureau rooftop, then drifts along horizontally, away from the Empire State Building
It stops, then begins to rise again
The sky darkens as the balloon rises into the clouds
-2 - Peter, Egon, Slimer, as before
Peter operates the weather balloon control box while Slimer flies the chopper
Okay, Peter, the balloon's in position
Turn the lever to the extreme left
Peter turns a lever
The balloon and surrounding clouds start to freeze, turning white and forming ice on them
Suddenly, snow starts to fall
He sticks his tongue out and catches some snowflakes
Blizzard-like snow pelts it
The chicken begins to stiffen and turn white with frost
(angry ) Snow falls on Ray and Winston as they gaze skyward
They did it
All-right
They high-five each other
: -- heavy snow continues to fall as () (calls) Anyone for dessert
,  - Maude (back to normal) emerges from kitchen carrying a large, steaming bowl
Seated around the table are Egon (back to normal) Peter, Winston, Ray and Zeke
No Slimer
There are half-empty soup bowls in front of everyone and the diners all look full to the point of weariness -- except Slimer
(raising hand) You bet, Maude
As he looks at bowl of soup Maude sets down
Lemme guess -- more chickenbane soup
spooning soup eagerly into his bowl
'm actually starting to like it
No more werechicken problems for us, eh, Egon
() () () Everyone freezes and looks o
s
