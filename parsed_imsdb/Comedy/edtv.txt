- The following is shot -
has just ended
It was a big game
Some kind of championship
is  -- jumping up and down, squealing and hugging each other
We are focused on the bench of the They're very sad -- several are crying
One girl, in particular, () is really sobbing
She's sweat- stained, tired and just blubbering
Stuff's coming out of her eyes, her nose, her mouth and the camera is seeing it all
The , a fortyish man looks at all the weeping girls -- Amy in particular
You quit
You gave up
He  a
Now Amy is really a mess
She's crying, coughing, shaking
(') (right in Amy's face) You quit
The Coach storms off
(') Qutters
Quitters
Amy is wailing and choking on her own tears
This
(
) And that would be it
don't think you need any narration at all
Just end it right there

- We're in New York City
We're in the conference room of a modestly successful cable  station called "Real
" The people are young, energetic, clever
It's crowded, noisy -the furniture is beaten up, bulletin boards cover the walls, with large index cards all over them
This room is not for show -- work gets done here
are present
One of them is
She's the boss
(to Cynthia) What do you think
It's horrible, it's depressing, love it
What else
want to re-pitch that pregnancy idea
Find six women early in their pregnancies and follow them all right through to the births
(negative) Yeah, when all that stuff comes out
Mixed reactions, mostly negative
have an idea
(') This is something 've been thinking about for a long time
We're "Real " right
mean that's the name of the station
(') So let's go real
We find someone
Just a regular person, someone
And we put their life on television - live
all day long
Silence
No movement at all
(') Calm down
What do you mean, like  did in the seventies
What was that family
The Louds
Yeah
No
We go way beyond that
We don't film it and edit it and put it on later
We go on the air live every morning and the show goes off each night, when our subject goes to bed
In between, we're on live all day, every day - the same person, -- for (shrugs) let's say a month
No one is wild for this
Some hate it -- some are unconvinced
That's not a show that's a surveillance camera
You can't do that
The hell we can't
Look, the beauty of being a cable channel is we can take chances
've thought about this and 'm telling you,  think this can make a noise
loud one
There are twelve thousand channels
You've got to do something that says "Look at me
" Hell, people look at fish tanks all day
This is people
(more firmly) Someone's real life -- an , all day long - live
And, you know what
'm doing it
Pause
The others know the argument is over
In that case, we love it
3
- passes
On the bus is an ad
It says, "Would you like to star in your own  show
Call Real  (and a phone number) Coming (and a date)
" 4
-  - This is a nice upscale pool hall
party is in progress in a special private area -- a room upstairs let's say -- a loft
Thirty or forty  in their twenties and thirties are informally celebrating the engagement of two of their friends
It's , it's fun, it's informal
It's not a high-end group
By that we mean, not, for the most part young lawyers or stockbrokers
They're mostly blue-collar
Community college graduates
He's an attractive man, about thirty
There's still something a little juvenile about him -- not stupid, just boyish
is   for one of those congratulation montage things that are done at parties these days
Ed is good at this
He's not professional but he's a loosey-goosey guy who's kind of good on camera
want to congratulate Kevin and Tracy on their engagement
knew you guys were meant for each other from the moment Tracy told us she was pregnant
You asshole
Everyone else is cracking up
(innocently) What
What did  say
My mother's going to see this
5
- Other people are being "interviewed" on tape
Ed is with his buddy,
John's had a couple of drinks
He's a little melancholy
He is looking across the room, thoughtfully
What
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married
You said that
We're falling behind
Ed waves dismissively
(') You know who we are
Tell me
We're the guys who clean up after the parade
'm gonna stick this right in your eye
was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life
" And 'm laughing and then realize  wear a nametag
So do
So what
'm doing all right
Your brother's here
Ed's brother  and Ray's girlfriend  arrive at the party
Shari is pretty in an unglamorous kind of way
They both wave and then Shari goes off to talk to some of the  and Ray joins Ed and John
What's up
Where were you
(reluctantly) was
having dinner with Shari and her parents
/ (taunting) Oooh
'm telling you, it's closing in on me
All of a sudden it's like a thing, it's a whole thing
What do you mean all of a sudden
You've been going with her six months
know
mean 'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and 'm playing "Risk," with her kid brother, Leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least  hope it was the dog
'Cause her mother disappeared for a while
They
6
- It's getting wild
Some of the girls are dancing raucously
(   ,  -) Ed, Ray, John, Shari and maybe another
Ray is holding a big tray of
During the conversation, Ray throws them in the air and catches them in his mouth like popcorn
Once, he even bounces one off the wall into his mouth
You know, those are for everybody
Ray waves dismissively, then gets an idea
Oh
(to Shari) Show them that thing you can do
(to the others) This is great
just found out she can do this, her brother told me
(to Shari) Come on
(thinks it's stupid) don't - Come on
She hesitates, but she really doesn't mind
Slightly, amused she takes her  and fits it completely  her
Whoa
Oh
Ray is cracking up
Is that unbelievable
She removes her hand
And that concludes today's show
(to Ray) This is where you go around and collect the money
Ed
Ray gives her a
Shari's roommate  sits down
Hi
You guys know my roommate, Rita
They do, vaguely
What's going on over there
Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real thing
Oh, that thing
Yeah
Did you hear about this
(not sure) Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on  all day long or something
You know, that would be like a great thing
What
That
Being that guy
Being the guy they watch
What are you drunk
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject
Whoever that person is is going to be famous
They'll be able to get whatever they want
They'll
trust me, this is my business
What is
Show business
You're in show business
Yeah
service video equipment
That's like
those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the
(insulted) 'm not stitching Nikes in Panama
Bedwetter
Thumbsucker
'm making a tape
We're excited
7
- Ed and Shari, waiting for drink orders
So Ray met the family
Yeah
hear the dog really liked him
Oh, the whole family loved him
Of course, they loved the last guy  went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me
Really
You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men
There should be, like, a line behind you
She takes Ed's beer
You shouldn't drink
They
8
- Ed and Shari -
After a struggle, Ed wins
Ed is impressed
Jesus
Shari wrings out her arm and picks up her beer
(continuing a previous conversation) And, you know, every guy  ever broke up with, the minute it was over,  could tell you what went wrong, how it went wrong, why it had to go wrong
but when 'm in it
lost
'm like a love coroner
Bring me the corpse, '11 tell you what killed it
But how to prevent it
Lost
Ed
Ray's on
They walk over
(to camera) Hi
'm Ray Pekurney
'm from Paramus, New Jersey
9
'  - She's watching Ray's tape
Ray thinks he's funnier and cuter than he is
( ) All my friends tell me "Ray, you've got too much personality for one guy
" It's like at a party -- 'm at the center of the attention
Everybody loves me
He gets hit in the face by a hors d'oeuvre
(') Ha, ha, ha
'll kick your ass
No really, let me show you my girlfriend
She's really cute
He reaches out and grabs Shari's wrist
Shari is struggling to stay out of frame
We just see her arm and Ray pulling on it
Ray lets go
(') She's strong, 'cause she's a Fedex girl
She lifts those packages
But she's not dikey at all, she's really pretty
- the camera shooting an empty space
Then Ed's head appears sideways right in front of the
Hello 'm Ed
He starts to sniff
(') What smells
He steps back from the camera and straightens his head as he
He's more relaxed than Ray
(') What is that smell
Oop,  think it's this idea
One person on  all day long
(screams) Are you nuts
The Real  Staff are enjoying Ed's tape while they eat lunch out of styrofoam containers
(') Seriously, get your resumes in order
When my brother Ray - whose personality you were just dazzled by -- told me he was going to try out for this -- said, "why in the world would anyone want to be on  all day long, no privacy, everybody knowing your business, exposing every single detail of your life  mean
why would anyone want to do that
But then thought of a reason
(loudly) Why the hell not
He  the , smudging it
Cynthia, watching, cracks up
The others seem to like him to
10
- This is a video store in Paramus, New Jersey
It's busy
are in line to check out tapes
a  -- a mother -- who is rummaging through her purse for her Blockbuster card
She looks up and sees that her have opened several boxes of candy from the candy display and are eating from the boxes
Oh for -- Put those -- Oh God
She grabs the boxes from them
The boxes are ripped more than she thought and candy goes flying all over
She bends to pick it up
Ed appears
He works here
(to the Mom) We'11 take care of it
Someone arrives with a broom
(') (to the broom guy) Here
This time throw it out, don't eat it
, the Manager passes
Lou, can  talk to you a second
Lou seems like he'd prefer to avoid this
Um, yeah,  was gonna
What's the deal
Did anybody make a decision - Ed, look, uh
you're not getting the job
They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when  leave to manage the new store
'm sorry
Oh, Christ
Did you go to bat for me
batted
You batted or you bunted
Hey
went as far as  felt comfortable
mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please
You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday
Well, then 'm quitting
Ed, come on
What's that gonna do
You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees
Let me recommend a movie to you
It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late
" (wise-ass) Who's in it
Ed, telephone
Ed goes to the phone
(into the phone) Yeah
Are you serious
Come on, no kidding, who is this
Holy shit
11
- Ed is being interviewed by the "Real " staff whom we met earlier
He's slightly less comfortable than on his tape, but he's good
had one year of college
And then one year of junior college
(
) What did you study
Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help
Where were you, then
They
: 11A
- Well, there's Ray, my brother
He's
ambitious
Like a few years ago, he started this mobile dog-grooming business
But, like, out of his Camry
He had this bathtub in his trunk - (Ed starts cracking up) he's throwing the dogs in there, they're fighting and splashing, then he'd slam the trunk down, let 'em run around inside screaming getting all wet
then he'd use the car exhaust to dry'em
(wiping his eyes) Ah, Ray
he just can't get a break
: 11B
- My sister -- Marcia, mean she can't get a break
About seven years ago she falls in love with this Vietnamese guy who wants to marry her so he can stay in the country
So they get married, they have a kid, he gets his citizenship, immediately divorces my sister and marries this Vietnamese woman who, he was probably already married to all along
She can pick 'em
(pause) She's got a nice little boy, though
My nephew, Andy
: 11C
- My Mom's okay
Kinda
knew a guy who hated his mother - Stuey Shwam
He hated his mother so much, he had his belly button removed
: 11D
- No, 've never been married
The interviewer seems to be waiting for him to elaborate
He doesn't
He shrugs -- that's it
: 11E
- Oh, my father -what an asshole
When  was twelve, my mother needed a hysterectomy -- my father ran off with her nurse
And that's the last  heard of him
: 11F
- Al, my stepfather he's opinionated
And you have to listen because he's like in a wheelchair
: 11G
- like my job -- mean 'm doing all right
'm not sure how long  want to stay there, you know
mean, 'm thirty-one
'm not sure want to be a video store clerk when 'm forty
Of course, didn't expect to be doing it 'til  was thirty-one, either
But
you know 'm
keeping my options open
Anything comes along, 'm ready to pounce
(growls like a cougar) : 11H
- dream
Of course  have a dream  just don't know what the hell it is
(shrugs and smiles) Ed's image freezes, while he has a funny-cute expression on his face
a  in a conference room with Ed's frozen image on it
Cynthia is there with her bosses, the people who run the network that owns Real
The top man is His deputies are
and
McILVAINE
This is not the same place where we met Cynthia and her staff
This is richer, more corporate and formal
He's who we want to go with
(doubtfully) This guy
polled my staff
The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable
And one of the men said he's fuckable
'm not sure about the entire concept
Cynthia is frustrated
Look it's not like we're burning up the airwaves now
We're running neck-and-neck with The Gardening Channel
If people just tune in to this twice a day for five minutes, we're a hit
Plus we can sell advertising every second, running at the bottom of the screen
and the beauty is this guy doesn't even have to be good
mean if he's good, great
But if he winds up making an ass of himself, better
McILVAINE How is that better
Come on
People cannot turn away from an accident
You drive by, you say "Ooh,  hope there's not a head lying in the road" but you look
See, nobody in America wants to be nobody
This guy wants to be famous
So, basically, the deal is he agrees to drive down the highway a hundred miles an hour blindfolded and we get to see if his head winds up rolling down the highway
Fun for the whole family
So let's do it
She stops, waiting for approval
12 (coldly) Good luck
Ed's - the He gets goosed from behind (
) (very loud and happy) Hey
(goosed) Oh
Ed  the
Ray is there with Shari
got your message
Way to go
Hi, Shari
(to Ray) Let's go in the stockroom
13 Ed and Ray enter
So when do you start
'm not gonna do it
What
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - gotta think of a new way
mean, it's all day
Every minute
Id be like a monkey at the zoo
just
(disgusted) Oh man
They couldn't pick me
They had to pick you
He slaps a tape off a shelf
You would do this
You would actually -- In a second
In a hot second
Let me ask you something -- Why do you do that
What
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something
" Why don't you just ask me
(impatiently) All right
Let me ask you something
are you happy like this
'm doing all right
Oh Yeah
What's your master plan here
Shari enters, curious about the yelling
She stands there quietly, unnoticed by the guys
(') You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life
This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies
Screw off
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life
don't know
That's right
You don't know
Doors don't fly open for guys like us
Hey
You know-- we're not the same
got a good life, this job suits me
come and go when please -- Oh, don't bullshit a bullshitter
If you're happy like this you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot
(sees Shari) Hi
Ed turns and sees Shari
She's self-conscious
She feels like she's been caught eavesdropping
Oh
--  heard Ray yelling
1 didn't mean to -- (to Ed) Give me a chance
'm begging you
need a break
Look, '11 cover your ass
'11 ride shotgun
Just bring those cameras over to me and '11 make something happen for both of us
swear
Come on, Eddie Pause
All right
Yeah
Yeah
Ray lifts Ed up
Ray kisses Ed
(to Shari) Is this guy a brother
14
- Moderate-priced, restaurant
a - of
He's about seventy
What happens when you go to the bathroom
Do they go in with you
Ed, Ray, Al,  and
Al is in a  and has an oxygen mask connected to a tank
He periodically takes a hit of oxygen
He's a little short of breath, but loves to talk
Jeanette is Ed's mother -- about sixty
Marcia is a little older than Ed
No
The bathroom is off limits -and when  go to sleep they go to other programming
Unless  get up
Then they go back on the air
Unless  get up to go to the bathroom,  guess, then - What if--you're vomiting
(amazed by the question) What if 'm vomiting
Do they show it
guess --  don't -- it's all in the contract
There's this million-page contract -- Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this
(accusing, to Ed) What happened
You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on
No
barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever 'm regularly in contact with they want releases from
(angrily) They're gonna mock our foibles
Our what
Our foibles, our foibles
We don't have foibles
Everyone has foibles
Then the whole country sees them on  and mocks them
Then we have
mocked foibles
Eddie, please don't let them mock our foibles
(losing it) Stop saying foibles
Look, my life is not so great, that  want it shown on television
And neither is yours
That's the point -- this could change things
How
For instance
me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss
His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear
(points to Ed) What does that have to do with
If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment
Ed nods
Pause
(') borrow against that now, at the bank
Buy the business
And Ed becomes a silent partner
Now here's the beauty part
While we're on plug the shit out of the business
Free advertising
How about sex
pause
They all look at Al
'11 have to pass, Al
And it's not an age thing -- No
Do they show you having sex
No
Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away
At what point
At the point -- don't -- Look you'd be on  maybe one or two times each
'11 try to avoid '11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you
Believe me
:  loud drilling sound
: 15
'  - is drilling a hole in the wall
Ed is there with a
They're running cable and drilling holes and examining the apartment
Cynthia is going around supervising
Ray and Shari are there
Ray is fascinated
Ed is tense
Shari is observant
Ray separates from Ed and Shari and asks one of the Installers a technical question
Ed thinks
Ed joins Cynthia
Are you sure about this
Hey, believe me -1 know 've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here
Why do it
saw this show once
It was about logging
was home sick, there was nothing else on
Do you know how they break up really bad log jams
You know, when they're really tangled
Cream rinse
(laughs) Dynamite
So
So maybe this is my dynamite
Dynamite is dangerous
Ed, can  see you a second
(to Shari) Excuse me
Okay, so you understand
We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you
(overwhelmed) Cool
want you to take this
She gives him a card
(') That has my work number, my home number, my pager number
sleep three hours a night
Call me whenever you want to talk
Off the air, on the air, whenever
Okay
(barely listening) Um, yeah -- thanks
Ed looks kind of overwhelmed
She doesn't like this
Now look
Don't freeze up on me
picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality
You're not going to lose that, are you
No, uh
bet my career on you
You'd better be good
(annoyed) Don't say that
That's like
telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good
You don't do that
do
Ed reacts
Oh
16
'  - He's in bed, watching
The news is on
He glances up at one of the cameras
On the news, they go to a story about him
Tomorrow morning, the cable channel known as Real , begins broadcasting one of the most heavily promoted concepts in the history of cable television
In an experiment that they say will last at least a month
They're going to follow -- live - every waking minute of a thirty-one year old video store clerk from Paramus New Jersey
The Real press release on this promises that none of it will be scripted, none of it will be edited and in my opinion, none of it will be interesting
we're all just supposed to sit in front of our 's and watch this guy
live
(rhymes with "give") (to the Entertainment Reporter) What would be the interest here
What would
get people to tune in
Betas me
don't know
might check it out
Well, Len's here to check out sports
Len, would you watch this video clerk
'd sooner watch soccer
They all
17
'  - She's watching the same show
She's edgy
She's  her
Speaking of disasters, at the Meadowlands tonight
The set goes off
Ed, once again, stares up at the camera
: 18 Written on the screen -- "Day one
" and   with all the modern equipment
Here we go
Ten-nine-eight-seven- 19
- Cynthia and her staff are gathered to watch the show begin They're  and
commercial is on
20 21 two
one
On the , the commercial ends and the Real  logo appears
It says "The following is unedited, unscripted, and unrehearsed
It is the real life of one American citizen named Ed Pekurny
" The logo fades away and we see Ed, in bed, sleeping
His and he wakes up
He's groggy from sleep
Instinctively, he begins  his balls
As he does, it hits him that this is not a normal morning
He looks up and sees two steady-cam guys at the foot of his bed, aiming their cameras at him
Ed, then, looks at his hand on his balls
Gently, he moves his hand away
22 (mock cheerful) Well, we're off to a great start
: The camera operators will change in shifts
We'11 see about four regulars over the course of the film
The one we will see most often is shooting Ed right now
His name is 23 Ed, wearing shorts and a -shirt, gets out of bed
His hair is sticking up
He passes a mirror and notices his hair
Oh, great
He turns to the camera and seems about to offer an excuse for his appearance, but, then, just moves on
(') Excuse me
He grabs some clothes and enters the bathroom
24 They're not enjoying this
Everyone's staring at Cynthia
She doesn't flinch
: Silent advertising runs along the bottom of the screen
25
- Ed enters, dressed and showered
The Steady-cam is in his face
Ed is tight
He's much less comfortable than he expected to be
He smiles stiffly at the camera
He's misplaced his natural charm
He gets a box of Pop-tarts out of the freezer
As he does, other stuff falls out of the freezer on to the floor
He's embarrassed
He bends down to pick things up, showing his ass to the camera
26 (to Cynthia) Start clearing a place for your Emmy
27
- Ed is sitting up on the kitchen counter eating his Pop-tarts and a bowl of cereal
(nervously) Same people like to put the milk in first and then the cereal
like to put in the milk first -  mean the cereal first and then the milk
Yeah, that's it
Now, watch this
He takes a  and a
He peels the banana
He holds the knife, blade up, over the cereal and chops down on it with the banana, several times, rapidly, slicing it into the cereal
He's proud of this
28
' Ray is watching the show
His head is in his hands
He's horrified by how bad Ed is
29
' Jeanette and Al watching Ed
(being positive) So far
30 Somebody shoot me
31 Scharlach, Seaver and McIlvaine watching, grim-faced
32 Cynthia is  the
Get him out of the house
want him moving
33 (on the phone) Hey,  want him dead, but what can do
34 Ed is
He peers confused at the camera
They're signaling Ed to get out
Bewildered, imitating their gestures
What
You want me to swim
35 The Director is still on the phone
She's watching Ed on a monitor
Oh God
Ed gets it
Oh, out
You want me to go out
36 Ed exits the building with the Operators walking backwards in front of him, bumping into - People watch, curiously
Ed reaches his car
He takes out his keys and drops them in a muddy puddle
Disgusted, he fishes them out
: 36A Scharlach, watching impassively
: 36B
' Ed, in the car
He can barely fit the key into the ignition
Carlos, in the passenger seat taps him on the arm
Ed looks up
Carlos holds up a hastily-made sign
"It's okay
Relax, man
" Carlos
This does help Ed
He appreciates it
He drives
the control truck in motion
We also see another car with another Steady-cam , shooting Ed's car as they travel
37
- Ed is doing his morning errands
little shopping -- a little banking -- always
At one point, he   a with the word "Pull" on it
He pushed, banging his forehead
points to the word "Pull
" Ed turns to the camera, embarrassed
Later he buys a slice of pizza at a little place that's doing no business
(to the camera) Best pizza in New Jersey
As he walks down the street,  call out "Hey Ed
" People in windows show him that they're watching him at that exact moment
The camera shoots some of the people in the windows
They see themselves on  and they go wild
Ed also is confronted by grabbing their crotches mockingly, calling out things like "Hey, Ed, holding your own
" or "Hey, Ed, howls the grand ballroom
" Ed is slightly chagrined by all this, but handles it with good grace
He seems to be loosening up
38
- Ed arrives at work
The store is already open
(Ed usually gets there in the afternoon and stays until closing
) are a little stunned by the arrival of a camera
Some know what it's about some don't
The  are aware of what's going on
They all signed releases
Ed's  greets him stiffly
Clearly he's trying to get face-time on camera
Hey, Lou
(stiffly) Welcome to work, Ed
He shakes Ed's hand and smiles at the camera
He  a little
The   crosses, staring transfixed at the camera
He blocks Ed and Lou
He , then panics
He tries to get out of the way and trips over his broom
He tumbles face-first into the camera lens, hurting himself
, observing
(mutters) Oh, Jesus, 'm dying
39 Carlos, give him some air, give him some room
Use a longer lens
We'11 mostly go with the stationary cameras in here
Less intrusive
(to the crew in the truck, sarcastically) Have any of you thought about your next career
40
- is serving dinner
She's watching Ed on  -- really just glancing at it

This is hard, you know

He's  a   on his forehead

As Ray drones on
(selling hard to the camera) Okay,  just wanted to get your attention
My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and  design video systems
You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system
See, they should've picked him
Look how comfortable he is out there

You know, piano bars

That's how they met
He sang to her and they fell in love

Ray -- She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake
Oh, Jesus
Marcia, watching,
Remember the last guy she got involved with
What was his name
What's the dif -- Richie

That look
She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother

55 It's an educational-type panel discussion involving various eggheads and pundits
It's called "Viewpoint
" Let's change topics for a moment
Does anybody have a viewpoint on something going on now called "Ed "
#1 This,  believe, is a new low point in American culture
#2 agree
What it reveals is the absolute creative bankruptcy in the television business
What they're saying, basically, is "We're giving up
We have no ideas
" #3 It's worse than that
They don't select someone with any talent, or with something to say -- they seem to celebrate the fact that this guy is a boob
It's a joyous celebration of boobery
#4 think we've already spent far too much time discussing this
They all agree

Choke to death, you boring bastard

The audience likes you when you're moving
Yes
Try not to stay in one place too long
Get outside as much as you can
Also, we have some notions
Have you thought about becoming a Big Brother
Or coaching a Little League team
How about a date
Are you asking me
No,  mean
It's just, the ratings are still soft
(nervously) Are you going to cancel me
Let's not worry about that vet
You're testing well
There's another problem
It's
Ray
What about Ray
Well, the walrus impression - delightful as it was -- is just not wowing the audience
This is some audience research
He hands Ed a
Ed doesn't know how to interpret the figures
What does this mean
It means they hate his freaking guts
It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out
He's just
trying a little too hard -- Ed, the audience can smell the desperation coming through the screen
Could you
see him a little less often
How much less
Never would be plenty
can't do that to him
He's pushing a little too hard - but
just can't do that to him

Your show stinks
The Guy  like he really got in a good one
Ed ignores him

Merrily, they shake his hand and run off, whooping
There are  who trail along
Many of them will show up again and again, throughout the movie, following Ed
Some of them will look mentally or emotionally impaired

He makes funny comments
He's really a good guy

) Who is it
It's me, Ed
The door opens a crack, revealing Ray in a bathrobe
Ray's look is unwelcoming
Hi
You watching the ballgame
Uh, no, uh 'm a little tired

Oh
All right
'11 watch at home, then
Yeah

) Ray, where do you keep the glasses
Oh, is Shari here
Why didn't you just say so
Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired

) Who's Shari
Who's -- Ray looks pained
Ed realizes what's happening and freezes Ray's phone
Oh shit
He turns to answer his phone, allowing the door to swing open a little

He sees a , wearing just panties, facing away from him, searching for glasses
(into phone) Hello
Shari, hi
Oh no
Oh God
(to the camera) We'd better go
of  loving this, some screaming "Don't go
, don't leave, stay" etc

He holds his head
Oh God

He stops when Ray calls him
Ray 'runs out into the hallway after him
They speak with lowered voices
That was Shari
She saw the whole thing on -- What is this
What's going on, who is that

You were so great
" Next thing  know we're

You brought the cameras here
You brought the girl
Please
If  go over to Shari, the camera's going there, too

That's good
She'11 -- you know control herself
Look
If  go over there, she's just gonna slam the door on me
Just go over and beg her to talk to me, that's all
Please
You owe me for this
Ed accepts the irony of Ray's attitude without comment 67
- The door opens, revealing , Shari's roommate
(nervously) Um
Shari knew you were coming over because she saw
Right, yeah -- (apologetic) She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now
No,  understand
That's - where is she, is she all right
Rita isn't sure how much she should reveal
gave her a drink
thought it
but she's not much of a drinker, so it's made her a little
belligerent
Shari appears in the doorway over Rita's shoulder
she's holding a liquor bottle and she's a little drunk
What do you want
(awkward) Shari, 'm just really sorry
Look,  know this is
unbelievably awkward, but if could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say
two words, then
Shari indicates with her head, that Ed can come in
Ed and Carlos enter
Rita shuts the door
Shari crosses to a couch
Ed indicates for Carlos to give them some distance

This is gold
Stay out of their way, but get everything

He rests the camera down as if he's not even shooting, but he's still guiding it where he wants it throughout the scene

Shari shrugs

Look, just don't start any trouble okay
Just sit there quietly 'til  get there

He
He's disgusted

- This used to be a regular thing
And the worst part, is while she'd be waiting for me to come down to some bar and get her, she'd start up with some guy and say "Wait 'til my brother gets here, he'11 kick your ass
" So then  walk in and there's some rhinoceros in a windbreaker who tries to shove me into a shot glass

The game includes Tad and Barry
119 You think she really likes him
She doesn't give a shit about him
You know what would be great
What
If Ray would steal this girl from Ed
That would be great
#2 You know what would be even better
What
#2 If you shut your hole and played cards
Goddam pineapple brothers
The same eggheads who, earlier, had no interest in Ed
Now they're all worked up
#1 But he's not a normal person anymore
He's a celebrity
We're no longer observing anyone's "real life
" #2 (disagreeing) But that's what's interesting
The effect of celebrity on an otherwise average person
#3 But do you really feel that Ed is an average person

magnetism, a charisma that,  think, transcends the entire concept

He's special
They all nod

Did he really run away or did you throw him out like he says

Norman Rockwell
He painted magazine covers
Folksy mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor
Yeah, so
They celebrated the common person
Well,  don't think you can get more common than me, Al
No
Only celebrities now
Now, if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine he'd better have killed someone or no one will buy it
This one to Dr
Rumpley
Jeanette storms back in
All right -- do you want to know the truth

Okay
Chicken pox
was six
He didn't leave 'til  was twelve
He
apologized, he begged me
He can be very
charming when it suits his purpose
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse
She could've been a nurse
Could've been a nurse
She had white shoes
So does Grandma
So does Shaquille 'Neal
You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse
What's the difference
The difference is for twenty years  thought one thing and now it's another thing
Ed nods
He was no good
Do you remember how he used to scream at me
You used to cover your ears with dinner rolls

You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out
He had a woman in my own bed
And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al
(shakes Al by the shoulder) This is your father
This is who was there for you when you needed someone
Jeanette, you're hurting me
(on the defensive) 'm not --  didn't -- Al, you know how  feel about you
Al breathes loudly

Hank
All of a sudden
Because now you're famous and he can get something from you

No one is going in or coming out
147 It's deserted
148 It's empty
The  stands in the doorway with nothing to do
149 is in progress
The  is on
On  Ed is in a liquor store, buying a bottle of wine
Ed is dressed for his date
The people at the party are watching  and commenting
It's like a Super bowl party
(
) What's he doing
He's buying wine
150 Several high-school age
They have made themselves look like Ed
They're very excited
-  #1 You think he's gonna do it
-  #2 Hell yeah
The guy hasn't had any sex in six weeks
-  #3 Neither have we
151 Ed's car turns the corner and he sees a  gathered around Jill's building
152 (understating) 'm starting to feel a little pressure
Ed carrying his wine enters to  and
153 encompasses all the houses on the block
Their living room 's are visible
All but one are tuned to Ed
154
' Something is cooking
Jill picks up a plate of something - dip and cut vegetables for instance
She starts to exit the kitchen as Ed and Carlos enter
Ed and Jill have a soft collision
Oh
Can  help with anything
No
It's going to be about a half-hour
What is
Oh, dinner
-
He takes a vegetable, dips it and eats it
(') Mm
Good
Mm
They look at each other
Jill leans forward and kisses him
She puts the tray of vegetables on the counter
They continue to kiss
155 The high school boys are
156 Ed -- Ed -- Ed -- Ed
(same ones as before)
#1 Oh,  hope she makes love to him
#2 thought you didn't like her
#1 don't, but  want him to be happy- of other , watching, transfixed -- 157
' Ed and Jill are making out
They begin taking each other's clothes off
They're passing the point of no return
It's going to happen right there in the kitchen
Ed and Jill, in heavy heat, back up to the kitchen table and climb on to it
They continue to pull at their own and each, other's clothing
They're making passionate noises
158
' Shari is not watching television
She's eating a little meal she's made for herself
She   in her building cheering and whooping
She looks miserable
159 (slightly panicky) Someone say the word, how far can we go here
160 Cynthia and her staff are watching
Cynthia is   - (into phone) Stay with them
don't leave yet
not yet
Jill is on top of Ed
Carried away with passion, Ed attempts to roll her over and get on top
He does, but rolls too far
He crashes off the table, to the floor, face up
(in pain) Ohhh
Ed
Ohh
do you own a cat
Yeah
Why
He looks at her apologetically
161
' Ed is being loaded into an
He looks humiliated
in the street are applauding politely as if Ed were an injured ballplayer being carried off the field
Jill is by the ambulance
She's  a  who looks all right
are taking her picture
She's posing willingly
The ambulance drives off as Jill continues to pose
162 Written on the screen -- "Day 49" The taping of "The Tonight Show" or "the Late Show" -- once again, whichever we have a prayer of getting
The  is in progress
( ) (mock annoyed) So  guess you were all watching Ed last night
The  goes wild
(') This got the highest rating of the year, since the Super Bowl
guess that makes sense
After all, Ed is now the Buffalo Bills of sex
163
- Scharlach
He's stunned
What
Take him off the air
What are you talking about
He's fine
He's out of the hospital already
The ratings are higher than ever
'm telling you, it's peaked
Ed is an over-inflated balloon
Get it off before it explodes all over us
He thinks
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts
'm giving him another month
(coldly) Good luck
164
- " 54" Ed is walking
He's wearing a white, Velcro support around his waist
He's agitated
He's carrying a copy of the New York Post
Look at this
a headline -- "Ed: She Broke My heart
" She did not
(venting) You know what she did
(') She went out to California and got one of those scandal agents
One of those agents who handle, like
Gennifer Flowers and
Kato Kaelin and Joey Buttafuco
That's what she -- Hey Ed
She was a little too much for you, huh
Must run in the family
(angry) Oh -- like this guy's ever been with a woman
(yells) How about  kick your ass 'til the crack goes the other way
(to the camera) All of a sudden, 'm like fair game for everyone
'm like -- He stops and looks like he's in shock
He stares in through the display window of a bookstore
, a big  of cheap, rushed-out, exploitation books
On the cover we read "My Brother Pissed On Me By Raymond
Pekurny
11 And there's an old photo of two little boys
(Ed and Ray) Oh my -- He wrote a book
Ray wrote a book
He never read a book
165
- " 58" It's the hallway of a cheap hotel
Ed and the camera come off the elevator
Ed looks at room numbers
He can  the noise from all the rooms
radio -- a domestic disturbance -- a baby crying -- it's a horror
He   a door
(
) Who is it
It's Ed
The door opens  Ed's father
Ed
Come in - They enter
166 It's depressing
There's a liquor bottle on the dresser
Ed sees it
(') How've you been
Ed
(') They don't get cable here, so 1 can't watch you
Ed just
Hank takes  off a chair
(') Sit down
He does
He looks around
(') Quite a shithole, isn't it
It could be, if you fixed it up
How did you
mean how does anyone
wind up like this
was in jail
The whole time
Eighteen years
No
Two times
What
Check forging
Oh, man
So
The last two years, 've been a limousine driver, but  don't see well anymore, so
So you saw me on  and you said "Hey, let me jump on this
" need help
How many times if just one little thing that needed would've happened, it would've changed everything
If had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or
the tumblers just never clicked for me
Ed doesn't know what to say
He's bitter towards Hank, but there's also some empathy
(to the camera) All right
This is my father, don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - '11
help you
'11
mention your business or don't know, we'11 figure it out
(quickly, to Hank) gotta go
Ed
'm sorry
(still bitter) Yeah
That's good
Sorry is good
You know  finished that model
What
The pirate ship
Hank looks blankly at him
(') -- That we were doing "together
" finished it
It came out great
Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue
You're using too much glue
" Do you still have it
No
Ray sat on it
'11 see you
He exits
Out in the hallway, he leans back against the door, drained
The camera is right on him, soaking it up
167 The same -type panel of smart-looking people we met earlier
about half the panel
Let's hear from our guest panelist
You've expressed some interesting thoughts on this, subject
What do you see as the meaning, if there is any, of Ed , John
, sitting comfortably on the panel, looking very wise
feel that Ed is the apotheosis of a prevailing American syndrome
It used to be that someone became famous because they were special
Now people are considered special just for being famous
Fame, itself, is now a moral good in this country
It's its own virtue
The others  appreciatively as John puts a  in his mouth
was Ed's Little League coach
He had no coordination
The big game, he struck cut with the bases loaded
Then he cried like a woman
It was sickening
: was his third grade teacher
said "Take him for tests
There's something wrong with him
" They didn't listen
: He used to steal things from my store
At least  think it was him
Yeah, it was probably him
168
'  - , on the sidewalk, has a   stuck to his back to tease Ed
Hey, look,  just fell off a table
Suddenly, a    crashes down on him
169
'  - Ed at the window, with a now empty plastic tub
(yelling down) Okay, is that funny
Then he throws the tub out the window
(') (to the camera) How was that
Was that funny
170 " 78" Again, everyone there, including Cynthia
Honcho is reading a report
#1 Of more concern than the sag in Ed's ratings is what viewers are feeling about him now
The positives are down and the negatives are up
There's a feeling that Ed isn't cool anymore
We're starting to see a big
Hm
#1 Loser Factor
#2 That's deadly
McILVAINE Not necessarily
mean instead of running from the
, run with it
Create more moments like the table thing
We can package a video "Ed's Goofiest Moments
" Let him be America's Goofball
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic
mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel
Let it go
Cynthia,  think you're laboring under a misconception
You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed
We're not
Anybody in any business can predict failure
1 need people who prevent failure
want to see this thing turned back in the right direction
Remember this was your baby
171
- " 94" Tad and Barry -- as we met them, originally -- are watching
They're really enjoying it -- laughing, pounding the table
don't know,  still love this guy
Yeah only  wish they had the sister on more
Ooh, the sister
She is hot
You know it
that they are watching Joma
On the  -- Joma is eating dinner in his apartment with  attractive , who, apparently, both live there
Joma is upset (but he's funny when he's upset)
What's upsetting him is that across the alley, in a window of another building, he can plainly see an , with his shirt off, exercising
The overweight man is apparently watching an exercise video and is bouncing up and down in place causing everything to jiggle unpleasantly
' Ignore him
can't
It's like a mudslide
(screams out the window) Put on a shirt
, (') (yelling) support the fact that your exercising but, for the love of God, put on a shirt
' (to Joma) Shut the curtains
No
Let him shut the curtains
Laughing and wiping their eyes
172
' Off the air
Ed  the
This Joma is so phoney
mean, those things aren't really happening
think they have writers making that stuff up for him
Hey, couldn't we do that
Hire some writers and have them write up some crazy situations could get into
She's listening, amazed
Ed, everything goes off
"Cheers" went off
"Mash" went off -- (getting angry) Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them
They weren't bozos
'm Pumpkin Ass again
(getting annoyed) Ed -- You know, everything you asked me to do  did
call you for advice about Shari you say - (mocking imitation) "Leave her be, see other people for a while
" You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show
Ed -- No
You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings
You never gave a shit about me
Yeah
Well 'm not starting now
She   and has an acid reflux
173
- Ed and John are playing
Look, you put anybody on sixteen hours a day, at some point they're going to wind up rolling off a table on to a cat
mean with no privacy, there's no
dignity
Ed thinks
Pause
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl
When
Today
No
Like, ten years ago
In Texas
Baby
(tries to remember) Jessica
Oh right, right
She fell down, like a
Yeah, a thing
He became a big hero
He was on  and there was a parade and a movie about him Right, right
And then, uh
you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again
(cheerfully) Right
So he killed himself
(a little shaken) Oh
The cell phone
Ed   the phone
Hello
She's crying
Eddie
Mom
'm at the hospital
What's the matter
He's dead
Eddie, he's dead
It was his heart
Oh God
What hospital
St
Joseph's
'm coming right over
'll be right there
He hangs up
174
' Tad is watching  and talking an the phone
told you
told you he was gonna die
175
- Ed rushes in
He goes up to the desk
Carlos is with him
Hi
'm looking for my mother
Her name is -- spots him
Mr
Pekurny
Yes
'm Dr
Geller
Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes
we gave her something to calm her down
Thank you
Can  see her
Just wait here
She's coming right back out
Mm
(wearily) Oh, man
(sympathetically) What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick
'd hate to think he
Very quick
Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go
Making love to your wife
it's very sweet
Really
They were
(nods) According to your mother
When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that -- Hotel
What were they doing in a hotel

(
) Eddie
Thank God you're here
Eddie looks across the room and sees Al in his wheelchair, just entering from outside
He wheels towards Ed
How's your mother
(shocked) Al
Our neighbors gave me a ride
Al
Where is she
Is she all right
Ed turns to the doctor
thought --  thought he was dead
Who
Al
No
(reads his chart) The deceased is
Henry Pekurny
176
' (stunned) Good twist
177 You thought it was me
Yes
It's your father
Hank
Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack
Went -- Again, Ed turns to the doctor
Dr
Geller, Dr
Stack wants to see you
(to Ed) Excuse me
(to Ed) Could  get your autograph for my niece
(distracted) Um
yeah
Jeanette enters
Al
How did you -- The Burkharts drove me
Are you all right
(nervously) 'm fine
Good
gotta pee
He wheels off
Jeanette and Ed are left alone
(loud whisper) What happened
It was horrible
He called me up
Who
Hank
He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried
So  went to this horrible hotel he was staying in
felt so sorry for him -- So you had sex with him
Jeanette
What
The doctor said you were having sex
(horrified) To you
In front of him
(indicates Carlos) With the
Yes
He assumed Hank was your husband
He didn't know
Oh my god
On
Why
How
One thing led to another
He was my husband once
But Al is your husband now
Do you think it's been easy for me
It's been years
Al can't have sex
Apparently, neither can Hank
What the hell did you do to him
Al comes rolling back,
"Lovely Rita, the Meter Maid
178 (whispers) Don't tell Al
He doesn't know
(points to the camera) Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't
or  or  or someone
Women who remarry but have sex with their first husbands
on today's Oprah
179 Our same panel of pundits
#3 Ed's family is the tip of the iceberg
You watch the daytime tabloid shows it's the same thing
'm telling you, America is fast becoming a trailer park
#2 Let's not overstate the case
There are millions of hard- working, sensible, moral, educated people in this country
Not every family is like Ed's
watching this discussion on
180 is set up with little pictures
/ So let's recap
The mother's too good at it, both brothers stink at it
(there's a drawing of a figure falling of a table) The stepfather can't do it at all and the father did it but it killed him
(there's a drawing of a tombstone) How did this family ever reproduce in the first place
181
- Ed is driving Jeanette and Al to the funeral
is held back by Someone yells "Adulterer"
Someone else tries to offer Ed a lunchbox
Someone else is carrying a sign "What a Way to Go"
182
- Hank's  is being carried to his gravesite
Ed, Ray and Marcia are pall bearers
One of the others pall bearers is Ed's
The   are two guys who work for the mortuary
Carlos is shooting
(to Ray) You're not going to talk to me
You're not even gonna say hello
have nothing to say to you
Ed gives up
He turns to Marcia
How are you doing
Is Cliff here
She doesn't answer
Ed reacts
Cliff left her, thanks to you
Me
That's right
You put Cliff on television
So then he decided he was too good for her and he left
put his -- who -- (to Marcia) Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back
(too loudly) That's not funny
Ed
183
- The service ends
The small group begins to walk away
Ray and Marcia go off together, ignoring Ed
Jeanette is attempting to wheel Al away from the grave, but she's hitting ruts
Ed approaches
'11 take it
(to Al, uncomfortably) Sweetheart, 'm gonna go ahead and sign all the papers
Right
She touches him but he pulls away
Ed wheels Al
Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom
Is there anything  can -- 'm moving out
What
'm going to be living with my brother
He's not in such good shape as  am, but
'm looking forward to the pillow fights
(really upset) Oh, Al
This is just
Hank was always good with the ladies
Always good-looking
Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me
He stops wheeling and crouches down next to Al
want to tell you something
love you
You're my father
Pause
love you, too
Al  him
(') '11 build a pirate ship with you
Ed wheels him away
184
' She's watching
She's genuinely moved
She wipes her eyes
185
- This place is sleazy
Ed enters, worn out
He crosses to the bar where we find, Jeanette nursing a drink
She's not drunk, but she is wallowing
Hi, Ma
(startled) Ed
How did you know  was here
You're famous
Somebody called me
What are you doing in a place like this
Why shouldn't  be in a place like this
'm a whore
(cringes) Ma
'm a tramp (pulls on the sleeve of the man next to her) Meet your new father
The whole nation is laughing at us
And how is this helping
come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home
(exiting) 'm a whore
(yells at an employee) Your bathrooms are filthy
They're out
186
- Ed is helping Jeanette
Ray arrives
He's
'11 take her
You humiliated our mother on national television
You've single- handedly destroyed this family
-- Oh, but that book you wrote was a real love-letter
That
toilet paper with covers
#1 That book sucked
want my money back
Oh great
Where's Moe
He looks around
Moe is gone
Come on, Ma
(to Ray) Let's remember how  got into this
"Please, Eddie, do this for me
can't get a break
" (pretends to cry) You know what your problem is
Yeah
My problem is 've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom
" As opposed to a big, little bedroom
got paid by the word
No
Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault
Me
That's you
commit
take a chance
You wanted to be the guy on , but you didn't want to say you wanted to
So you have me talk you into it so you get what you want, but if it goes bad it's not your fault
#2 Right
Like you say you love Shari, but, you wouldn't mind noodling that model
Moe
#3 The truth hurts
Yeah
So does a kick in the nuts
For once in your life, be honest with yourself
know you, Ed
know you look at me and Marcia and Mom and you think you're different
You're like "How did  end up in this family
" You're not different
you're worse
Because you have no guts
You drift around, you don't commit, you make fun of me -- okay
Just don't kid yourself
(to Jeanette) Let's go
You're both good boys
Ray and Jeanette leave
187
- Ed is there along with Cynthia and the Network Execs
There are more execs than before
Cynthia's people are not there
This entire meeting is on
Cynthia is quiet - observing
Ed looks whipped
Three more months
Absolutely
Ed  is more popular than ever
Congratulations
McILVAINE Only, Ed, we want you, in the next few weeks to spend a lot more time with your family
You do
Definitely
Cynthia, explain it to him
Cynthia just stares at her,
(') '11 do it
(to Ed) People want to see what happens to them now
Do your mother and step-father get back together
How does your sister handle being alone
Your feud with your brother
In fact, we have a new concept
Since your family signed releases, we can follow them on camera even when you're not with them
We can cut around from family member to family member
Whoever's the most exciting at that moment
McILVAINE And, of course, it's another big bonus payment for you
Pause
couple of years ago my Uncle Roy got bit on the ass by a dog
Silence
What the hell is he talking about
(') So he gave me his tickets to the
Open -- the tennis matches
They still have no idea what he's talking about
(') So me and Ray, we tell our friends "Watch when Andre Agassi is gonna serve for the first time
When he's bouncing the ball and it's real quiet, we'11 yell "Whoop"
And you'11 all hear us
" Pause
see
(he doesn't) You know what that is
It's sad
mean it was just so we could be heard
So we could stand out from the crowd for a second
So we did it
But we had nothing to say
Just "Whoop"
That's it
And the stupid part   mean the really stupid part is we thought it like
elevated us above the crowd
Where the fact is it made us stupider than the crowd
see
Stop saying " see
" You don't see
Cynthia,  owe you an apology
don't think so
Yeah
Because, you didn't talk me into anything
Everything you wanted me to do,  wanted to do
188
' Shari watching Ed
189 (to the camera) Ray, you were right
It's like in school
was always saying "the room was too hot, the teacher didn't like me" -- but it was me
Everything that's wrong with my life  did
Okay
So now this is it
My family has problems
Which are our fault
And  is not the place to solve them
So  quit
'm taking what very little dignity 've got left and  quit
Can someone validate my parking
Pause
Well, Ed, that's
not really possible
All right, '11 pay for the parking
Big network
Scharlach speaks carefully - gently
He's aware of the camera
He doesn't want to come off as a villain
No,  mean you can't quit
Ed thinks
can't
(very gently) Well, no
You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to
The station entered into this on that understanding
If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else
You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son
It's not fair to us
More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers
They're interested in you
They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you
Look, if you don't let me out of this
'11 just
'11 just sit in my apartment all day won't go anywhere,  won't do anything
What kind of show will that be
Not too good
That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses
Ed,  urge you to reconsider
urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours
Play fair with them, Ed
All right
Let them decide
He turns right to the camera
(') 'd like you all to do me a favor
Turn me off
Just grab the remote and change the channel
mean, basically, all you're watching now is a guy deteriorate
The only thing missing is the smell
You're better than that Turn me off
Thank you
