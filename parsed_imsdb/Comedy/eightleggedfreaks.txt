(Eight Legged Freaks) by Jesse Alexander & Ellory Elkayem July 2000 Draft : - rabbit hops across rough terrain

They pass a sign: , , 454

The first truck speeds past
Then the second
The rabbit crosses the highway in front of the third

The rabbit appears in the road, frozen by headlights
Ahhhhhhhhhh
Pig Pen jams on his brakes and swerves to avoid the bunny

Missing the bunny by a whisker

If he doesn't regain control, he will crash
At the last second, he gets the rig together
() -   - The rim of a wheel tags the curb
One of those toxic waste barrels falls out of the back and plunges to the water below
- biohazard warning label is legible as the barrel slips beneath the surface
Glowing toxic waste seeps from a gash in its side
Spreading through the pool like neon ink
- The ditch is littered with garbage
The  of No visible traces of toxic waste
butterfly net sweeps through the air to capture an oversized horsefly

This old codger is more comfortable studying bugs than socializing with people
Hey, Mike
Check this one out
(12) steps over for a look
Puberty hit hard and fast for this bright, little nerd
He's huge
They've been like this all week
Must be something extra tasty in the water
Like what
Dead coyote
Snake maybe
Back in the 'Nam we'd eat python with a dash of habanero sauce
Mighty satisfying
() 3
: You ate snake
When you're thirty klicks out from the nearest firebase
Humpin' through the wake-up with your finger on the trigger
Charlie doesn't give you time to stop for cutlet
As Mike skims his own net over the water, he glimpses a familiar barrel at the bottom of the pool
The brightly- colored biohazard warning label is clearly visible
- '  - Two bicycles are parked outside a cabin in the middle of nowhere
'  - The decor is an odd mix of Vietnam era war relics and homegrown scientist
Charlie the Parrot sits on a perch
(
) Charlie, don't surf
Quiet, bird
We're working
Mike and Joshua stand near the spider tanks
dozen aquariums on low shelves
Each glass tank replicates a specific environment: jungle, desert, cavern, pond, etc
(dims tank lights) The sun is going down, my nocturnal hunters
It's time to come out and feed
Mike watches Joshua deposit bugs into each spider tank
Yeah
They're definitely getting bigger
've calculated a growth factor of twelve percent over the last forty-eight hours
But that seems to be accelerating
() 4
: All from eating these bugs
Maybe should try some
Mike pauses at the desert tank, watching a cricket search for food
trap-door spider pops out of its camouflaged den like a jack-in-the-box
The arachnid yanks the cricket below and replaces the roof in a nanosecond
Mike looks in another tank where ogre-eyed spitting spiders shoot blasts of paralyzing goo at hapless insects
Run, little guys
They can't outrun the food chain
could get away
Imagine yourself the size of that fly
scytodes spitter would be as big as a Cadillac
You'd be spider chow, kid
Mike looks in a tank where jumpers chase fleeing crickets
He moves toward another tank that is covered with a towel
Are the new tarantulas in here
Took me forever to get a breeding set of Chilean reds
must have bribed every customs agent from Vegas to Santiago
Joshua unveils the    tank
Dirt floor
Several burrow entrances
Joshua     pours in the bugs
large, male tarantula comes out    of a burrow
It pounces on a bug, then wraps its prey    in webbing, turning the insect into a mummy-like bundle
That is too cool
Male tarantulas compete for the female's attention
() () 5
: (') Each one tries to bring her the best present
Bugs, rats, even the occasional parrot
The prey is cocooned alive so she can eat them in her nest
You know how women love breakfast in bed
Joshua leads Mike to the back of the tank
network of subterranean tunnels is revealed
The male tarantulas scuttle through carrying their mummified offerings
Take a look, the female of the species is three times as big as the male
Mike peers into a large den
The female tarantula steps out of the shadows
This is Consuela, the Chilean red tarantula
Say hello to Consuela
Mike watches Consuela unwrap one of the mummified bundles
She begins to eat the paralyzed insect within
She fills her prey with digestive acid to liquify the internal organs
Now watch
She'll drink her victim from the inside out
While it's still alive
(looks queasy) And you wonder why my mom doesn't like me hanging out with you
Arachnids have been roaming the earth for millions of years
And they'll be here long after the human race is dead and buried
Suddenly Consuela lunges at the glass
Mike recoils
Bad
Bad Consuela
Consuela backs up, apparently she can be intimidated

- The multi-eyed spider's
Mike looms large at the edge of the glass, wagging his finger
Mike stares into the many eyes of Consuela
Do that again and  feed you to the parrot
hungrily
The sound of a
There's your mom
See you tomorrow, Joshua
Mike heads for the door
- The entrance to a mine shaft protrudes from a hillside
pickup truck is parked nearby
The faded logo on the door reads: McCORMICK    , ,
- Rotten beams
Chipped walls
a string of lightbulbs
lone figure works at the end of the tunnel
McCORMICK (30s) has rugged good looks
Weathered clothing
Dirt-stained face
Ripped muscles
Chris chips at the wall with his pickaxe
As it makes contact, the occasional spark flies up
Chris pauses to scrutinize the target area with his helmet-light
Something sneaks along the floor of the mine behind him
Chris is oblivious to his unseen stalker
He chips away a section of stone to reveal shiny minerals
Reflections of silver and gold splash across his face
His smile fades
Damn
() 7
: Chris bends over, reaching for a bottle of water large rat scurries out of hiding dragging away Chris's sack lunch
Chris grabs his pick-axe and goes after the rat
The rodent dodges every hit
Sparks fly when the axe strikes rock
These ignite a vent of methane gas
knocks Chris off his feet
He notices a small hole in the floor is lit like the burner on a stove
Chris pats out the flame as the rat scurries away with lunch
Hope you like bologna
- police car drives with a bicycle hanging out of the trunk
() - ""  (30s) is the sheriff of Prosperity and a confident, single mother
Mike is seated beside her
You   should see them, Mom
Each one   has a unique feeding behavior
The   spitters fire poisonous snot
The   tarantulas mummify their prey
The   jumpers can
Why does he have all those things
He studies them
uses spider webs in outer space
And for medicine
They've been here forever, and they'll be here long after we're all dead
You're givin' me nightmares
Nightmares are cool
() 8
: brought this to the station
Sam hands Mike a small package
It's from Dad
He didn't forget my birthday
told you he wouldn't
Better late than never
Mike tears open the box to reveal a Cassiopeia
Rockin'
Is that the one you wanted
Cassiopeia 2304 with 64 megs of ram
Integrated modem
Voice recording capability
This baby is tight
Mike can't turn on the gizmo
What's wrong
He forgot to send the batteries

Hang on, babydoll

: They  their  onto the highway
Slalom the yellow lines
Wheelie for days
Ashley peeks over Bret's shoulder at a police car coming at them in the opposite lane
Oh shit
() - Sheriff Sam watches intently as the bikes wheelie past
Hang on
Why
() - The police car does an impressive bootlegger 180
Lights ablaze
The bikes pull over to the shoulder
() - The motorcycles stop with the cop car behind
Sam's voice barks over the
(
) Party's over, gentlemen
Off the bikes
Sam exits the car and approaches
The bikers dismount
There is something very sexy about an older woman in uniform
Her nine-millimeter gives me a stiffy
Don't antagonize her, you guys
told you not to act like kamikazes
Especially with Ashley riding behind
That is unacceptable, Bret
() 10
: could always ride her from behind
Larry snickers
Sam steels her rage
You just bought yourself a reckless
Sam begins to write up the ticket
Can't you give 'em a break
Get in the car, Ashley
Now
But, Mom
Sam shoots his daughter an intimidating glance
No sweat, babydoll
We'll hook up later
(threatening) Over my dead body
'   () - Mike grins from the front seat as Ashley climbs in back
You have the right to remain silent
Anything you say can and will be used
Shut up, dork
- Sam hands Bret the ticket
Larry, do we know anybody at City Hall who can mark this go away
() 11
: Your Dad is the Mayor
Oh, yeah
(to Sam) He signs your paycheck
The next time you put my daughter's life in danger, 'll show you exactly how little that means to me
Bret and Larry feel her resolve
Relax, bee-otch
It's all good
The punks remount their bikes
want both wheels on the ground
The punks  their  and defiantly wheelie toward town
- Sam climbs behind the wheel
read her her rights
can always count on you, Mike
Sam  the  and drives toward town
Do you get off on humiliating me
This bad girl act doesn't suit you, Ash
'm just trying to have fun
Don't you remember what it's like to grow up here
That's what scares me
() 12
: Sam reaches over and opens the glove box
She pulls out a stun gun
Mike passes it through the bars to Ashley
told you to keep this with you
Ashley slides the zapper into her backpack
You are so over protective
Mike and Ashley lip-sync along with Sam's response
mother's job is to protect her children
You need to start trusting me
'd like to
But you keep skipping classes to go to the dunes with Bret
Why do you hate him so much
don't hate him
just want you to have a future
thought you wanted to get out of town
Go to med school
Maybe  want to stay
could get pregnant by nineteen
Then divorce with a couple of kids can't handle
Slap on a badge and be a trailer trash sheriff
(deeply hurt) Thanks for the flashback
They drive on in painful silence
Mike turns  the (

Freedom radio
We've put aside the 's and conspiracy theories

() - Chris drives into town with the

) for some down home talk back with our own mayor: Wade Hale
Oh, great
(
) Thanks, Harlan
As  was saying, Chemical Technologies has been looking for viable storage sites
And Prosperity is lucky enough to be on that list
(
) Lucky
think most of us are insulted that some outsiders think our town is a perfect place to dump toxic waste
Right on
() - Chris's pickup approaches
The entire town is not much bigger than a few football fields
The kind of place where everybody has known each other since childhood
Some buildings date back to the 1880's gold rush
(
) Isn't this just your latest get- rich quick scheme
At one end is the Prosperity Mall
huge windowless rectangle in the sand
Permanent signs tout the many outlet stores inside: Victoria's Secret, Home and Garden Supplies, Sport Chalet, etc
Hand-painted signs reveal: " " On the roof of the mall is a very tall radio antenna
(
) Your mall has more employees than customers

Signs identify it as: "
"  brand new humvee is parked out front

Two men sit at a home built transmitter
(40s) wears an "Aliens Go Home
" - shirt
He eats from a box of Frosted Flakes and drinks Jolt cola
(40s) is the mayor of Prosperity
slick- haired dandy who looks more like a Vegas lounge singer than a Mayor
With one phone call  could put together a deal that would make us all very rich
They say money doesn't buy happiness
They probably don't have any
15

(
) Money pays for kids to go to college
It pays the mortgage

Locals chow down

Yeah, of boredom

He listens to the
(
) Wouldn't it be nice not to worry about surviving retirement
Or taking a shot at that life-long dream
'  - Think about it, Harlan, you could buy a commercial transmitter and start broadcasting to a national audience
It would be nice to get the message out
Let people know the aliens walk among us
16
- Chris slows to a stop in front of the McCormick and Son Mining Company
This stately edifice was once the driving force behind the local economy
(
) If Chris McCormick refuses to sell his mines
The rest of us are out of luck
Chris frowns
() - (
) don't think it's fair for one person to wield that much power
But he's just like his father
Selfish
Greedy
And more than a little bit nuts
Uh-oh
Sam flips on the  and accelerates
- The locals stop eating and look toward the radio
(
) That family has been digging in those tunnels since the twenties
If there was something down there, don't you think they would have found it by now
- Floyd and Leroy stare at the radio
(
) Common sense does not apply to crazy people
- (
) Might as well be chasing a leprechaun's pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
() 17
: Chris is furious as he   and speeds toward Harlan's
- The locals watch Chris's pickup speed by
(
) lunatics
- Floyd and Leroy watch Chris speed by
(
) certifiably nuts
- ( , ) - As Sam pulls into town
She sees Chris skid to a stop in front of Harlan's trailer
He leaps out of his pickup
(
) at the very least
'  - Chris yanks the door open in time to hear
those McCormicks are just plain-old dumb
Wade stands up to protest
But it's too late
Chris punches him in the nose
The mayor tumbles back
've warned you not to talk about my family
We have a surprise guest in the studio
Chris drags Wade to his feet, shoving him against the wall
My family built this town
() 18
: Am  supposed to be grateful
Chris draws back his fist for another shot
Sam runs in and grabs him from behind
That's enough
Stay out of this, Sam
She manhandles Chris toward the door
'  - Practically the entire town has gathered outside
Sam drags Chris through the door
Wade and Harlan are close behind
Did you hear what he said
heard
want him locked up
Let's all calm down
Wade tries to take advantage of the assembled audience
We have no economy
People are barely scraping by
And now we've been offered the deal of a lifetime
You don't have the right to stand in our way
Those mines are full of gas
One spark in the wrong place could blow this entire valley sky high
Do you really want to load that gun with toxic waste
Chem-Tech did seismic analysis, vapor checks, groundwater reads, soil sampling
They found isolated methane pockets, but no benzene or hydrogen sulfide
() 19
: How could they run tests didn't give them permission to go into the mines
Wade retreats toward his shiny new Hummer
asked you a question, you greedy son of a bitch
'm greedy
You're the one keeping us down so you can search for gold
Chris tries to go after Wade
Sam holds him back
Don't take another step
Chris stares at her
You're taking his side
'm trying to keep the peace
You're crazy
Just like your father
Wade drives off in his humvee
The crowd begins to disperse
(sotto) He wasn't crazy
It's okay
Chris heads off to his truck
Sam watches him go
Her eyes drifting down his body
Ashley steps up beside her mom
Maybe you're not gay after all
What are you talking about
() 20
: You can't take your eyes off his butt
Where did you learn that it's okay to talk to me like this
Relax, Mom
He's hot for an old guy
can admit it
Why can't you
Sam watches Chris get into his truck
He gives her one last look before pulling out
Sam smiles with her daughter
( , ) - Vintage mining gear
Walls covered with sepia-tone photos chronicling the history of the McCormick mines
(50s) sits at a desk
She blows smoke from her Kool into the breeze of an air conditioner
Ignoring the signs behind her head: "
", "
" As Chris enters, Gladys hides her lit cigarette in a drawer
Did you pop him one
He had it comin'
But Sam Palmer
That woman abuses her power
Why
Because she stopped you from givin' Wade another pop
'm not proud of it
Chris goes to a table and a map of the mines that honeycomb beneath the town
Many of them are marked "explored
" Many aren't
Chris checks another tunnel off the list
He sniffs the air and glares at Gladys
Smoke rises out of her desk drawer
Gladys yanks it open and puts out the flame
() 21
: thought you were trying the patch
am
She raises her sleeve to reveal several nicotine patches
Chris exits through a door at the back of the museum
-   - Chris enters the family living quarters
The furniture was new in 1947
He continues to the adjacent kitchen
-  - Chris takes a beer out of the fridge
Then he notices an odd
He tracks the sound to a stove burner permanently on "light
" Chris moves to a fuse box in the adjacent hallway
He removes the fuse for the stove
The
Chris sits at the table and has a cooling sip of beer
Gladys enters with a stack of bills
That burner's on the fritz again
Oh something's broken
What else is new
(lays bills on table) You need to pay these by the end of the month
(looks at bills) Today
For a split second actually thought  had it
Another vein of iron pyrite
Yeah
Then a rat stole my lunch
practically blew myself up trying to get it back
() 22
: 'm glad you like my bologna sandwiches
(beat) Maybe you should talk to Wade
What are you saying
Honey, if he really does have a buyer
You of all people know how much my dad wanted to find that mother lode
Your daddy wanted to    get rich don't think he cared    how that happened
If he was     still alive, maybe he'd sell those    mines
Chris takes umbrage
And maybe you didn't know him so well after all
tense beat
You're right
'm just worried about how we're going to pay these bills
Don't give up on me, Gladys promised him 'd find the gold
And  will
Gladys steels her fear, patting Chris on the hand
-   - The sun rises
The town slowly comes to life
(
) Good morning, Prosperity, Nevada
It's another beautiful day on the frontier
Locals prepare their stores for business

'  () - (
) No charges have been filed in yesterday's fracas between Chris McCormick and Wade Hale
And we've got
Joshua turns the radio down
He holds a tape measure to a glass spider tank, recording the size of an unseen arac
An exponential growth rate
That's impossible
Me so horny
Me love you long time
Joshua doesn't look back at the parrot sitting on its perch
Be quiet, bird
Charlie looks over at the tarantula tank
Watching curiously as the cloth cover moves slightly
As if one of the spiders is escaping
Charlie flies over to investigate
He lands on the counter and peers around the back of the tank
Charlie's in the wire
Incoming
Something yanks the parrot
Stop screwing around
Joshua looks back in search of the parrot
He notices several feathers floating down to the floor
He heads over to investigate
Joshua pulls the blanket clear to reveal the top of the cage has been pushed aside
No sign of any tarantulas
Joshua checks the back side of the tank
Where'd you go
Consuela
She's nowhere to be seen
Joshua spots      something sticking out from under the table
Two      parrot feet
Joshua pulls Charlie out from under the     table
It's a horrible sight
The bird is wrapped in      spider webbing
His body desiccated
() 24
: Charlie
Semper fidelis
Joshua sees Charlie is attached to a web
He tugs on the webline
Something tugs back
Joshua leans down to look under the table
His eyes go wide at what he sees
Then a shadow looms over his head
Joshua looks up and
'  () - and the sounds of   come from within
() - Ranch style
Cop car in front
Chris's pickup cruises by
-    - Chris drives past
He catches sight of a figure in a window
-  - Sam is brushing her teeth at the window as Chris drives by
They make eye contact
Chris moves on
Sam looks at herself in the mirror
Bathrobe
No makeup
Messy hair
Mouth full of toothpaste
Work it, babe
-  - Sam comes out of the bathroom dressed in her uniform
It's all yours
Ashley and Mike exit their rooms
Mike is dressed for the day
Ashley in a robe
They race for the bathroom
Mike is first
Then Ashley hip-checks him out of the way, slamming the door in his face
(
) Ladies first
() 25
: What's your excuse
Sam sticks her head out of a room at the end of the hall
You still want a ride, Mike
'm just going to the mall
Have fun
Mike heads down the hallway and out of the house
-  - Ashley turns on the shower, drops her robe, and climbs in
-  - Ashley is surrounded by steam
She sings an edgy gangsta rap tune by
Tres' bizarre, non
Shampoo lather cascades down her face
Her eyes close
She is oblivious to a small spider crossing a web in front of her
The spider gets clear as Ashley rinses off the soap
Ashley rubs conditioner into her hair
The lather builds
Covering her face
Forcing her eyes closed once more
The spider returns across its web right in front of her eyes
The water stops
Ashley reaches for the showerhead blindly knocking the spider off its web
She feels no water coming out, and fumbles for a washcloth
Reaching with eyes closed, she can't see the little spider has landed on top of the cloth
As Ashley retrieves it, the spider scurries onto its opposite side
Ashley wipes the soap off her face
The spider rides the washcloth and moves toward her hand
Before it can strike, Ashley gets her eyes clear and drops the cloth
The cloth lands on the floor atop the spider
As the beast stares out from under it, barefoot Ashley steps on the cloth
Crushing the spider without ever knowing it was there
() 26
: Ashley turns her attention to the showerhead
She cranks the water handles, trying to get the water flowing again
The handles suddenly pop off
Dozens of tiny spiders pour from the holes onto the floor
Ashley shrieks in horror
Sam bursts into the bathroom and yanks open the shower door
She drags Ashley out and looks at all the little spiders
Now what
Ashley just screams

Mike walks away, deeper into the mall
dozen stores line the hallway: Victoria's Secret, Electronic Boutique, Sport Chalet
Most of the stores are closed for good

Skylights cover the ceiling

Definitely too big to be spiders
Could be rats
Mike slips past the barricades
Following the tracks to the edge of the abyss
He can't see anything
It's too dark
Mike turns away and returns to the yard
Never realizing
Several feet down the shaft
Hidden under a rock
the shriveled and desiccated corpse of Joshua Taft
It hangs from the side of the shaft in thick sticky webbing
Grisly

Chris isn'   t so sure
And then a new sound
a The    noise grows
Something's coming
Chris shines his light into the darkness
Trying to see what's causing the unsettling crescendo
Suddenly dozens of  burst from the darkness

The rat stampede is on his tail
He leaps into the back of his pickup
The manic rodents continue off into the desert
Chris looks back toward the gaping mouth of the tunnel

Everybody shuts up

We need an exterminator not a sheriff
What about my dog

We're gonna keep an eye out
But we're not gettin' anywhere like this

Mike avoids the crush and manages to stay inside

Mom
All Josh's spiders are gone

Maybe he's out looking for his spiders

Hello

Came out to feed my birds this morning
Coyotes

Only three mangy ostriches are there to greet them
My flock had fifty birds
Where'd they go, dammit
Who the hell steals fifty birds that can't even fly
All this happened last night

And we didn't hear a thing

Sam talks to Wade
How's the ostrich business
Not so good lately
You've got that new Hummer
You must be makin' enough to pay for it

'll take you for a ride
These birds are insured
Right
didn't kill my birds, Sam
Is that what you think
Mike looks back to see his mom confronting Wade

absolutely not
Mike scrutinizes what appear to be more of those tracks that he found at Joshua's
But this time they are larger: (into ) 've found more tracks
Even larger now
Mike follows the trail toward another mine entrance
This one is plugged with concrete
The tracks don't go there
They stop at what appears to be a normal patch of ground
Several ostrich feathers are scattered nearby
Mike takes a closer    look
Something doesn't seem right
An odd demarcation    in the soil
His fingers trace the edge of a thin film    of material
It is a lid of sorts

Mike is able to lift it

What the hell were you doin' last night
Come on, Mike
Let's hit it
Sam leads her son toward the house
Mike glances back

Wade is at Sam's window

Sam drives down the driveway
Wade takes off his hat and wipes his brow
He watches Clyde run parallel to the accelerating police car

Mike is lost in thought
We have to go back
Mike
That was a trapdoor spider's burrow
What are you talking about
Joshua was feeding his spiders bugs from the creek
And they were getting bigger
Mike glances out the window at the dog running nearby
(agitated) What if they didn't stop growing
What if they broke out of their tanks
Ate Joshua
And went into the mines
Sam looks at him like he's out of his mind
That could be why the other species are coming out into the open
They're trying to get away from the giant spiders

But Bret won't listen
Ashley isn't strong enough to fight him
She reaches into her purse and pulls out her stun gun
She rams it up in Bret's crotch and pulls the trigger
Bret howls like a baboon in a wood chipper

Ashley closes the door of the truck and rolls up the windows

He rummages through some junk

He turns around to discover an odd hole in the wall
He ventures over for a look
Rats
Chris leans into the hole, his jacket restricts his entry
Chris pulls out of the hole, standing to reveal a large male tarantula on his back
Chris is oblivious as he takes off his jacket
The coat lands in a heap atop the spider
Chris gets back down and places one of the rat traps in the hole
He doesn't notice the jacket moving behind him
Chris backs out of the hole
He picks up his jacket
The spider is gone
He grabs his traps and heads upstairs

No
Smoke pours out of her nostrils

This is where  throw up
Don't tell me you don't think she's a fox

Testing his own feelings
He opens his mouth to ask another question
And then heads out
See you for dinner
Gladys doesn't notice the basement   open slightly

Nothing yet

We've got missing pets, dead ostriches

Wade is
He knows how to push my buttons
wanted to ask you
On a date
Sam freezes for a second
Chris laughs

: 'm kidding
What did you want to ask
Have you noticed anything strange in the mines
Define strange
had spiders in my house
Hector had roaches in his basement
Some mice
How about stampeding rats
Were they running away from something
Could have been
Never saw them do that before
guess it qualifies as strange
Sam thinks this over
Sam
Do you want to go out sometime

Only if you're going to say yes

As she works, the spider shadows her
Every time the spider is about to strike, she goes another direction to get spices, utensils, a pan
Gladys places her bowl on the stove
Suddenly the tarantula drops onto the stove right in front of her
Gladys shrieks
The tarantula lashes out at her
Gladys grabs a frying pan and smashes it across the face as she stumbles backward
The spider reels, striking the burner knobs, turning on the gas
Gladys registers the sound of
She looks back toward the fuse box and makes a run for it
As she goes, the tarantula fires a webline at her
Gladys gets the fuse off the top of the fuse box, but the webline prevents her from slotting it home
Gladys strains with all    her might, finally slots the fuse
She turns toward     the kitchen just in time to see the broken burner spark    to life
The gas ignites
The tarantula is engulfed in    flame
Gladys is knocked down by the blast
She lies on her back when a second male tarantula nails her with a webline
Gladys screams as she's dragged across the floor toward the basement door

The volunteer fire department attacks the conflagration
All the locals are there to help

And then he charges toward the inferno
Sam tackles him from behind
Pinning him to the ground
No

The museum collapses
Chris watches it burn to the ground

The once-proud building is now a smoldering pile of rubble
Locals stand in small groups
Chris wanders through the ruins as    firemen mop up
He picks something out of the char
The map of the mines
Almost completely burned
Soaked     with water
He stares at it for a heavy beat
All that     remains of his legacy

Maybe she got out
Sam puts a comforting hand on his shoulder
(devastated) She was cooking
The stove was broken
Why don't you come home with me
We'll get you cleaned up
Chris hesitates for a moment
And then he lets the map fall
He walks out of the ruins with Sam

He spots something near the edge of the ruins
He goes over to pick it up
It's a piece of arachnid exoskeleton
spider's leg
Big
Very big
Travis the fire chief warns him away
Get away from there, Mike
Mike hurries clear with his prize
He puts it on the ground, sketches the outline of a spider to fit the scale of the leg

Watching, Upset
Nothing happened, alright

Chris stands alone for a beat
He walks to the kitchen and pulls a bottle of Vodka from the freezer
He puts the cold bottle against his head and neck
Trying to cool off
Mike bursts into the house carrying his piece of exoskeleton
He sees Chris opening the bottle of vodka
Spiders shed their skins when they grow
Chris looks at Mike for a moment
Like snakes
Gladys is dead
Chris drinks vodka straight from the bottle
Maybe not
That got Chris's attention
This is a tarantula's leg
Or it was
It's an exoskeleton, to be scientific
It's a little large
() 54
: Chris has another gulp of vodka as Mike holds up his Cassiopeia full of spider data
He shows Chris a video of a male tarantula mummifying its food
Chris watches in amazement
See
Male tarantulas wrap their prey in webbing
Tight like a mummy
The food stays alive so they can eat it later
Sam enters the room in time to overhear this
Mike, please
Now isn't the time
Chris looks up at Sam
They keep their food alive
Mike hands his mother the new piece of exoskeleton
What is this
spider's leg
Sam flinches, dropping the object to the floor
Careful
No
That's a piece of cactus
Look
It's covered with spines
Those are quills
Tarantulas can flick them at you like darts

Kind of like a dog scratching a flea
Giant tarantulas

Sam holds up a shirt that Chris approves of

All Jason cared about was getting out and starting over

Sam turns to pass Chris a pair of Levis
He's buttoning up the new shirt
Chris takes the pants
He doesn't register Sam ogling his exposed chest

: Gladys thought  should sell
but you know
never wanted to get rich
If it was about the money,  would have sold out to Wade a long time ago
Chris moves behind the car and takes off his pants

That my family wasn't crazy to keep looking
Even after we'd lost so much
And now
she's gone, too
'm sorry, Chris
Do you know what 'm trying to say
It wasn't about spending the gold, it was about finding it
That's right
That's exactly right
Sam glimpses Chris through car windows
The poor guy's struggling to pull on some 501s
Sam turns away, but catches sight of him in a propped-up glass door
Remind me never to let you do my laundry
She turns, only to see him in a mirror
He steps out from behind the car
Sam stares at him
They look great

It is striped like a jungle predator
It comes all the way into the room and then lingers among Ashley's stuffed animal collection

Still dead
He types at his computer, entering the specification of the piece of exoskeleton

Showing Mike exactly how big the spider would be after shedding this skin
Mike is distracted by the   coming from Ashley's room
Can't you turn that down

) 'm doing spider research
Ashley stops ripping
She goes to the pile of animals, oblivious to the spider
The beast doesn't move
Ashley grabs a pink teddy bear with a heart on its belly
She returns to bed and cuts the bear's heart out with scissors
The spitting spider sneaks up behind Ashley
As it moves, so does Ashley
She scoops up the torn photos and mutilated bear, dumping them in the trash
She turns around to find the giant spider on her bed
She freezes momentarily
(sotto) Spider
Mike
Spider
Ashley sees her stun gun is on   the dresser
She lunges for it
She's almost got it
The spider squirts two lines of gummy web at Ashley
The glop hits her int he chest, carries her backward
Glues her to the wall

He faces Sam
There is an odd moment as they   find themselves standing close
If the circumstances   were different they'd probably end up kissing

Sam and Chris run down the hallway
Sam yanks open the door to Ashley's room

The spitter fires another webby blast, sticking the girl's legs to the wall
Wow
scytodes spitter
Chris pushes past Sam and Mike
He grabs a chair and shoves it at the spitter like a lion tamer
The spider backs off
Sam takes off running down the hallway
Where are you going
'  - Sam runs up to find a gun case
She tries to get a shotgun, but finds it locked
She doesn't have the key
Sam grabs objects in the room and smashes the gun rack to pieces

With the other hand he tries to get Ashley out of the webbing
Mike stands nearby reading from his Cassiopeia
The scytodes spits a gooey discharge to immobilize their prey
No shit

The chair is blown from his hand, and stuck to the wall
Chris stands weaponless before the spider

Ashley is nailed in the face with another blast of goo
Mouth sealed shut
Chris reaches under the bed and pushes it over on to the spitter
The spider leaps clear onto the wall

The spitter's fangs move from side to side as it fires
'll keep that in mind
Chris grabs the spitter from behind and drags it off the wall
The spider turns to fight
Chris wrestles it to the ground
He sees the fangs begin to move from side to side and rolls clear of a point-blank web shot
'  - Sam takes a purposeful step back and launches a spinning roundhouse kick that snaps the shotgun out of its binding
She grabs the bang stick and runs from the room
'  - Chris puts himself between Ashley and the spider
He looks for a weapon
Lunges for the scissors, but the spitter nails him with a blast of glue
Chris is flung across the room and stuck to the wall by the sleeve of his shirt
He shrugs out of it and makes another grab for his scissors
He gets them
Get under it
Stab it in the abdomen
They don't have any armor down there
How am  supposed to do that
The spider leaps at Chris
and  in midair
Bits of gore shower Chris
He stands to see Sam in the door with her shotgun
Chris is covered in spider guts
'm gonna need some new pants

Chris comes out of the garage wearing clean clothes
Sam chucks him the pistol

: Ever used one of these
'm a fast learner
Chris tries to put the gun in his pocket
And then his waistband
But these damn pants are too tight
Ashley uses scissors to cut web out of her hair

told you all
But nobody ever listens to Mike
Still think 'm crazy, Mom
'm sorry  didn't believe you
Ashley is about to hyperventilate
Calm down, baby
There aren't enough wine coolers in the world to calm me down
won't let anything happen to you
Sam ka-chacks a fresh round into her shotgun
What other spiders did Joshua have
Spitters, jumpers, orb weavers, tarantulas
Why couldn't he keep goldfish like a normal person

The mall
The walls are concrete and the exits have steel gates
We could hold an entire army of giant spiders from inside
You just said giant spider on the air
Sam sees the microphone is keyed
Now that's great radio
Not giant spiders
meant to say
Harlan notices long spider legs passing the window
The aliens
64
'  - Sam and the    others spill out of the trailer
They head for the cop    car
As they get closer, a wolf spider climbs onto    the car's roof and gnaws on the light bar
Sam raises    her gun to blast it
Wait, Mom
The noise will attract more of them
Let's try for the mall
Sam leads the others toward town
- Chris and Sam hang onto the panicked kids
Harlan brings up the rear
The place is chaos
People are chased by spiders
Dragged by spiders
Killed by spiders
Eaten by spiders
My truck's at the museum
Your keys
In my other pants
Look out
The group flees a trio of goo-firing spitters
Suddenly a familiar mini-van races past
Stop
Take us with you
Harlan tries to flag down the speeding ride but sees
The van's occupants are locked in combat with a jumper
The beast is inside their vehicle and tearing them to pieces
The van crashes
( , ) - group of orb weavers scurry across power lines
They hit a transformer, shorting it out
The entire town is suddenly plunged into darkness
Headlights
Moonlight
Spotty illumination for the arachnids' feeding frenzy

() - dumpster
The lid rises slightly
Wade Hale peers out from within
He lifts the lid higher, oblivious to the wolf spider on top of it
The spider reaches down at him
No
Please
The spider is suddenly   by Sam and Chris
Wade climbs out of the dumpster
Thank you
Chris and Sam move on with the kids
Wade runs after them
Mike looks at garbage-covered Wade
You stink
(to Ashley) Have you seen Bret
He was out at the dunes
Go ahead
've got your butt
What
Your back
've got your back
Chris gives Sam a funny look
Maybe Gladys was right
- Sam leads her group down toward the mall
Other groups of survivors do likewise
As they get closer to the mall the groups coalesce into one large pack
We recognize Deputy Pete
Fireman Travis
The roller-skating waitress
Floyd
Leroy
Hank
Emma
And many other locals
( ) - Sam and Chris are at the front of the mob with their kids
() 66
: Suddenly a trapdoor spider pops out of the ground
It grabs Travis the fire chief, and pulls him under, quickly replacing the roof of its den underground
Trapdoors
They're all around us
How can we spot them
Mike consults his Cassiopeia
didn't download that part
You dork
The group wheels at the
They see nothing
They hear another  , and the top of the spider's den pops up
Travis drags himself out of it
Help
me
please
He is dragged back underground
The group continues toward the mall entrance
Suddenly a gun-toting hunter is grabbed by a trapdoor
He goes cyclic, madly  his  into the air as he's dragged under
More beasts rise out of their dens
Reaching for the humans
Keep going
Chris and the others flee toward the mall
Some of them at the spiders as they run
Leroy is grabbed by a trapdoor
Floyd tries to help but the spider plunges its fangs into poor Leroy, dragging him under
The group clears the trapdoor minefield
But some of the spiders have vacated their dens and are coming after them
67
- Chris and Sam and the kids lead just fifteen other survivors to the glass doors
The doors are locked
Wade pulls out a ring of fifty keys and fumbles with them desperately
There's someone inside
The group sees Norman the dope dealer janitor approaching out of the gloom
He's staring at them all curiously
We're closed
Sam points her gun at him
Norman raise his hands in shock
Wait
have a prescription
It's for my glaucoma
Open this goddamn door
Yes, ma'am
Norman unlocks the door and lets the group in
- The survivors hustle inside
They lock the glass doors behind them
The spiders are still coming
Get away from the doors
Be cool, little dude
They're locked
Glass won't stop them
The spiders begin smashing through the glass doors
Chris and Sam  to keep them back
People flee into the mall
The gates
Close the gates
() 68
: Wade and Norman proceed to lower the slotted steel security gates
Only problem is: Sam and Chris are on the other side
Mom
Hurry up
Sam and Chris see the gate coming down
They run for it and slide underneath just as the gate comes down massive trapdoor slams up against the metal
But the metal holds
Shut the other entrances
Norman and Chris run toward the opposite end of the mall
-   - Chris and Norman arrive
Spiders are  through the

Trick or treat
Chris and Norman head back to join the others
They find
() - The survivors gather makeshift weapons
Floyd take a chainsaw off the wall
Norman practices swinging a heavy sledgehammer, accidentally toppling a stack of paint cans
Hank stands before a display of circular buzz saws
Chris goes to where Sam doles out the few firearms
We're sealed up at both ends
Sam hands Chris a shotgun
He tries to get the feel of it
You pump the slide to jack in a fresh round
Point at your target and squeeze
() 69
: Chris tries it out, pumping the slide
shell flies out the slide of the weapon and hits Wade in the head
Watch it
Like that
Sam shakes her head and takes the gun back
She pulls a machete off the wall and hands it to Chris
Try not to cut yourself
- The place has the feeling of a fortress under a siege
Separate groups of townspeople are stationed at the entrances to watch the spiders' every move
-   - Why didn't we see them earlier
For the last time
They can't handle the sunlight
They were waiting in the mines for the sun to go down
Then at daybreak they'll go back inside
We can walk out the front door
We won't make it that long
They're gonna come in after us
They're growing very fast
They need food to sustain that kind of development
Someone should go out and get help
() 70
: You go, Sam
Me
You're the sheriff
don't have that many handcuffs
What about the police radio
You're not goin' back out there, Pete
None of us are
Radio Shack is full of cell phones
But the signal won't get out of the valley
That's why we couldn't sell any of the damn things
My antenna
The group looks up
The moon-cast shadow of the antenna is visible on the skylights that run the length of the mall
could climb up to the top bet  could get a signal out
Great idea
You should do that
'll cover you, Harlan
- Wade leads Chris and Harlan toward an access door
Sam stands with her kids
Watching
Chris looks over his shoulder for one last look
Sam runs up to him, gives him the shotgun
() 71
: Are you sure you can handle this
(re: pants) While 'm gone, do you think you could find me a size 32
'll do my best
(a beat) Uhh
Do you want to go out sometime
Dinner
Maybe a movie
Chris takes her in his arms and plants a kiss on her lips
Wade holds open the nearby access door
Hey, loverboy
you've got a town to save
Chris and Harlan head out
Sam watches them disappear through the door and then returns to the survivors
You're not really going to get him bigger pants are you
No way
-   - Wade leads Chris and Harlan up a tight staircase
The door at the top is identified as "Roof Access
" Wade reaches the door
The others bunch up behind him
Don't even think about locking this door
'll be right here waiting
Wade slowly opens the roof door
-  - Chris and Harlan step onto the roof with their gear
No sign of any spiders
() 72
: Wade closes the door behind them and locks it
Chris and Harlan aren't happy to hear that
They sneak across the roof toward the base of the antenna
It looks clear
Harlan starts climbing
Chris stands guard at the bottom
Neither of them sees the horde of spiders climbing up the side of the building toward the roof
'  -  - Mike collects perfume
Packing it into his pockets like grenades
Ashley is nearby, checking out the lingerie
didn't know you wore cologne
don't
It's spider repellent
Sam steps in through the door
Let's stay together, guys

Move it
The kids run out to join their mom
After they go

've got a signal
He dials 911
-  - Chris is surrounded by spiders
He starts climbing up the antenna
They're coming
-  -  - Harlan is on the phone
He hears
(
) 911 Emergency
'm calling from Prosperity Nevada
We're being attacked by giant spiders
The entire town has been overrun
Chris yells up to him
No
Don't say that
(
) This is Emergency Services
Not dial-a-joke

: The
Chris climbs up beside him
He  several  at the approaching spiders
What happened
They didn't believe me
What a shock
Try again
The spiders are closing in as Harlan re-dials

) 911 Emergency
There was a massive explosion
Everybody's dead

) Sir, your number has been flagged as a source of a crank call
'm afraid  must terminate this conversation
She hung up on me

Chris  the
The spiders are closing in

She can see the silhouette of Chris and Harlan climbing the antenna
Pursued by spiders
(sotto) Oh my God
Ashley screams in horror nearby
They're inside

And drags him off the antenna
Harlan falls off the antenna, back toward the spiders
Chris reaches out and grabs him
Holding Harlan's hand
've got you
Harlan makes eye-contact with Chris
They're both about to be killed unless
Defend the human race
No
Harlan jerks away from Chris's hand
He cannonballs down into the horde of spiders
Splattering several of the beasts along with himself
Chris throws the useless shotgun at an approaching arac and climbs even higher
He pulls out his machete and begins hacking at the guide-wires that hold the antenna upright
The spiders close in
Chris slices one wire
The antenna quivers
Chris slices another wire
The antenna shakes

Several more come at him
You're going down

The antenna tilts in at a sixty degree angle
Chris hangs off the end
Orb weavers ride their weblines   down to the floor of the mall
Mike peeks out from the top of the jungle gym
He sees a hundred spiders coming in on webs
Flooding out of the stores
The devil-spawned monsters are everywhere
Arac attack
Chris leaps from the antenna to a nearby web
He slides down it like a pole, squashing the orb weaver at the bottom
Sam runs to his side
() 77
: Did you get help
Is anybody coming
We're on our own
Sam tosses him a gun and they head toward the jungle gym
The waitress roller-skates away from the spiders
She slaloms clear of several spitters
But gets tackled by a jumper
- Ashley and Mike are hiding
can't stay in here
Ashley starts to move out   of the tube
She discovers the end has been covered with   web
She pushes it
Something on the other side pushes   back
Ashley scrambles back
Mike is already moving
The kids flee through the tubes to get away
What are they doing
(checks Cassiopeia) They're trapping us like ants in a log
Once they have all the exits blocked, they'll come in through the last one
They see a way out, head for that exit, only to find a spider coming through it
Mike tosses one of his perfume grenades at the spider, covering their retreat
Another spider comes after them through one of the tubes
Mike chucks another perfume bottle
The spider cowers
We've gotta go
Ashley finds a hole that leads to the slide
Here
She starts down with Mike close behind
large spider looms at the end
Ashley tries to arrest her slide
But it's no use
At the last second Sam's boot kicks the arachnid clear
78
- Ashley and Mike pour out of the slide
Chris and Sam finish off the spider and then run with the kids
Emma runs parallel to them across the playground's sandbox
Only to be yanked under by a trapdoor spider
Hank sees this and goes after the spiders with all his tools
Getting revenge with a nail gun in each hand

He stops for a moment to look at the jeans
(
) Chris
Chris continues on
All of the survivors meet in the middle of the mall and prepare for Custer's last stand
Spiders charge from all directions
Mike throws his perfume grenades
Sam and Chris
Others use their make-shift weapons
Norman pulls out a joint and sparks it
Mike sees this and gets an idea
Where do you grow your weed
Dude, if  tell you,  have to kill you
Norman takes a hit on his reefer
They're going to kill us, you stoner
Norman sees the army of spiders closing in
Over here
() 79
: Norman opens    an access door
Sam and the other survivors run over and    crowd through it
Norman shuts the door behind them
The groups of pursuing spiders collide and begin ripping    each other to pieces in a feeding frenzy
-   - Norman leads the survivors down the tight hallway
Where are you taking us
To Shangri-la
-    - Norman leads the survivors into a basement room full of pot paraphernalia
Hookahs
Weed growing in hydroponic units under battery powered lights
Psychedelic posters
You aren't going to arrest me for this are you
Not today
The group can hear   at the upstairs door
(to Norman) Oh great
Now you've trapped us
Chris moves to the bottom of the stairs
We should be able to hold them off for a little while
Suddenly a loud   on the wall behind them
They're coming through the wall
The group tightens up
Back to back
Ready for the end
Suddenly a human hand punches through the wall
What the hell
() 80
: Bret Hale rips through the drywall
Filthy but alive
Standing in a horizontal mine shaft
He sees Sam's gun pointed right at him
didn't touch her
swear
Sam looks at Ashley
Don't waste your bullets
Wade embraces his son
thought you were a goner, boy
Chris steps to the opening for a closer look at the mine
We can get out this way
Aren't the spiders in there
Not until daylight
The  on the upper door gets more
Norman grabs a flashlight and a bunch of battery powered grow lights from his weed farm
He passes them out to the group
Chris takes the flashlight and leads the way into the mine shaft
Bret is shocked as the others follow him
The group uses the grow lights, and flashlights
You're going back in there
Are you all crazy
Come on, Bret
No way
'm not going
Bret is alone in the room as the upper   and spiders flood downstairs
Bret dives through the opening
81
- Bret runs past Sam and Chris
Sam  her  at the first spider that enters the tunnel
Her She un-holsters her  and
Cover me
What are you going to do
Chris uses the machete to cleave into the tunnel's upper support beam
More spiders come into the tunnel
Sam desperately
Chris keeps on hacking
Hurry
Sam's
Spiders charge
Chris swings the machete hard
The   onto the attacking spiders
Chris and Sam leap back
Landing in a heap
Clouds of dust swirl around them
They are tangled up for an awkward beat
Their faces just inches from each other
Hold that thought
They manage to disengage and move on
- Chris and Sam move toward the bobbing lights of the few remaining survivors
We're trapped again
At least they can't follow us
Which way do we go
think we're in one of the old tunnels
Can you get us out of here
Don't worry, Sam
Chris takes point with the others following nervously
82
-  - boarded-up shaft entrance
Suddenly the Chris and the others bash through
They file into a slightly more open area with two branching tunnels
The place is stacked from floor to ceiling with barrels of toxic waste
don't believe it
Mike recognizes the BioHazard warning label he saw on the barrel in the drainage ditch
've seen one of these before
What are they
Toxic waste
Where did you see it, Mike
The creek where Joshua gets his spider food
There was one in the water
Chris starts toward the sloping tunnel
We can get out this way
No, we can't
(turns to Wade) Isn't that tunnel blocked off, Dad
Chris and the others look at Wade
Uh
yeah
he's right
We can't get out that way
You did this
knew you'd never sell
We're under my property so
() 83
: You put all of us at risk
didn't have a choice
was broke
They gave me a hundred grand
Sam punches him
Knocking Wade to the ground
think our lives are worth a little more than that
We're wasting time
Chris heads toward the only exit available
The others follow
Wade staggers to his feet
Stumbling after them
- Chris leads the group down a tunnel
They come across bits of vintage mining gear
string of old light bulbs runs along the roof into both tunnels
One end of these lights should be connected to a generator
That'll be near the entrance
They continue down the tunnel
Entering
-   - large cavern
Animal carcasses litter the ground
Some human remains
Dead pets
Dead ostriches
My birds
You see, Sam
wasn't lying
That's what  can put on the insurance form
giant spiders
Ewww
what's that smell
The others are reacting strongly
() 84
: Methane
This cavern is full of gas
What does that mean
One spark and we're all dead
Norman swallows his glowing joint
Chris shines his flashlight on a pile of mummy bundles
That's what  was talking about, Chris
Presents from the male tarantula to the female
So the female's around here
Bret looks around nervously
The group moves closer
They sine their lights on a horrifying sight
Joshua's corpse is a deflated flesh balloon
Yellowed teeth sneer from a shattered skull
He's completely desiccated
Every ounce of liquid drained away
Mike hides his eyes
Ashley comforts him
That one just moved
Chris runs over and slices it open with his machete
The web comes away to reveal a human hand
There's somebody in here
Chris cuts away more web as the other survivors help
They finally reveal Gladys
Gladys
The woman's body begins to spasm
Gladys, please
(to the others) Can anybody help her
() 85
: Suddenly Ashley pushes her way forward
Her breathing is shallow
She's going into arrest
Ashley proceeds with
Just like she saw on
Suddenly Gladys snaps out of it
Gasping for air
It's okay
It's okay
Gladys starts to get a grip
Trying to focus on Chris
From this angle Chris look like he has a golden halo
Am
dead
You're okay
'm not in heaven
No
Then what's with all the gold
Gladys points behind Chris's head to the wall of the cavern
The group turns their lights on it
The reflection is dazzling
Veins of gold criss-cross the cavern walls
Gold
Gold
Look
It's everywhere
Is it real
Chris checks it out
Jesus
it's the mother lode
He was right
My dad was right
Chris helps Gladys to her feet
They share an emotional look of recognition
So were you
() 86
: Wade chips away at the gold
Get as much as you can
Bret looks at Ashley
Nice work, Doc
Ashley acknowledges him
Bret chips gold with Wade
Sam puts her hand on Ashley's shoulder
You saved my life
Ashley smiles
Gladys leans over to Norman
Have you got a smoke, kid
The man says this cavern is full of highly flammable methane gas
smoke to get high, not to die
Spiders
The group sees a cluster of normal-sized tarantulas scuttling out of the shadows
What's the big deal
Norman steps on the closest one, grinding it under his boot
He stomps around, crushing as many as he can
Mike watches this curiously
Taking a look at one of the squashed bodies
think you should stop
Why
They don't have hair
They aren't fully grown tarantulas
Chris and Sam look over
() 87
: They're giant babies
Norman freezes
He hears   around in the dark
And then a spine chilling
Chris reacts to the noise
He can guess what's coming
The   steps out of the shadows
Consuela has grown to be as big as a Volkswagen MicroBus
By far the largest spider we've seen yet
Covered in hair
Massive eyes
Her two fangs are the size of machetes
Mike's eyes go wide at the sight of his old nemesis
Consuela
Consuela
The fur on Consuela's back seems to undulate
There is something weird there
lot of weird things
In fact
her entire back is littered with hundreds of baby tarantulas
As Consuela advances, she flicks several dart-sized quills off her belly right into Norman
dark stain spreads across the drug dealer's shirt
Bummer
Consuela pierces Norman with her fangs, holding him tight
Babies flood of her back and onto the doper, chewing him to pieces like ravenous piranhas
Go
The group flees toward the opposite end of the cavern male tarantula drops down to block their escape
Sam it away
Wade and Bret are still chipping away bits of gold
Leave it
So you can keep it all
Hell no
Wade gets a nugget off the wall
He only has a nanosecond to admire it before Consuela suddenly looms behind him
() 88
: Dad
Bret reaches out toward his father
Wade reaches for him
Consuela's fangs suddenly protrude from Wade's chest and he's hauled backward
The tarantula flings Wade into the cave
Bret, come on
Bret runs after the others
But he sees Consuela firing more quills at the group
Directly at Ashley
Bret leaps into harm's way
He's turned into a pin cushion
Bret
Ashley goes to his side
'm sorry
Bret dies
Sam drags Ashley away from him
- The survivors flee along the tunnel
Chris jumps up to rip down the string of light bulbs from the ceiling
We have to get out
This is our chance to kill them all
Chris smashes the bulb at the end of the strand
When the power comes on, the bulb will ignite the methane and torch them
Where did you get an idea like that
Chris looks at Gladys
blew up the kitchen
() 89
: Keep going up the tunnel
There should be a generator at the exit
Start it up and await for my signal to throw the switch
And the toxic waste
Will be buried under tons of rock
Go
What about you
need to set the fuse as close to the spiders as  can
That should give us time to get clear
Sam and Chris share a brief beat
And then Chris pulls down the lights, dragging them back toward the tarantula's den
He has a cute butt
Don't you think
choice
-   - Chris comes through with his light bulb fuse
Consuela and her babies are feasting on the bodies of Bret and Wade Hale
Chris finds a vent in the ground
He sprinkles dust over it to identify a faint draft
Bingo
He positions the shattered light bulb beside this gas jet
- Mike helps Gladys up the tunnel
Sam and Ashley are behind
Suddenly a male tarantula steps out of the shadows, separating the groups
() 90
: Mom
Keep going
Sam and Ashley flee down another tunnel
-   - Chris finishes preparing the booby trap
He gets up to leave
Only to find Consuela coming toward him
hate spiders
Chris runs out of the cavern
- Chris bails out of the cavern and starts running
- Sam and Ashley flee the male tarantula
Sam stumbles over something on the ground
It's Bret Hale's lost motorcycle
Ashley looks back and sees the tarantula coming after them
Hurry
Sam lifts the  upright and climbs on
She it and  the
Ashley leaps aboard
Sam accelerates along the shaft, away from the spider
The bike's headlight illuminates their path
The male tarantula scurries after the bike
Sam rides the motorcycle along the shaft
Ashley hangs on tight
They've put some distance between themselves and the male tarantula
dead-end looms before them
Ashley screams as her mom stops on a dime and does a 180
Sam rides back the way they came, heading straight toward the male tarantula
Ashley looks over her mother's shoulder at the giant spider coming in the opposite direction
Oh shit
() 91
: Sam lifts the bike into a wheelie as the tarantula nears
Banzai
With perfect timing, she brings the front wheel down hard onto the tarantula's back
Crunch
The spider is roadkill
Sam steers them down another tunnel
-  '  - Mike and Gladys gather at a generator just shy of the tunnel exit
Mike tries to start the generator
It won't catch
It needs gas
There's a ranch
Gladys heads over toward Wade's ranch
- Chris runs along the tunnel
Consuela charges after him, Chris reaches up, smashing more light bulbs as he runs
-  '  - Mike is at the generator as Sam and Ashley ride up on the motorcycle
It needs gas
Sam tips over the motorcycle, trying to get gas out of the tank
It's clear this is not going to work
Hurry
- Chris runs
Smashing light bulbs
Consuela close behind
Start the generator
92
-  '  - He's coming
Hurry, Mom
Sam has dumped some fuel into the generator
She tries to start it
It won't turn over
- Chris ducks as Consuela fires quills at him
He keeps going
- Sam sees Chris at the bottom of the tunnel
She tries to start the generator again but it refuses to cooperate
Throw the switch
don't have any power
Yo, Mom
Sam turns as Ashley throws her the
Sam catches it and brings it down to the light bulb cable it
- As Chris runs, the light bulbs illuminate sequentially, traveling past him into the cavern
- broken light bulb sparks
The filament ignites the gas-filled tunnel
ball of flame spreads throughout the mines
-   - huge column of flame blasts into the chamber
All the gold is illuminated
Consuela's babies are burned like popcorn
93
-  '  - Sam looks back to see Chris running toward her
Consuela is on his heels
The glow of a fireball is right behind them
Come on
Chris looks over his shoulder at Consuela and the flames
Chris
Chris makes it to Sam just ahead of the conflagration
-  '  - Sam and Chris dive out of the mine opening
pillar of flame shoots out behind them
Ashley and Mike are nearby
The town is visible just a mile away
- The spiders retreat from daylight
Scuttling back into the buildings
Heading down into the mine shafts
- The chain reaction spreads through the mines
Jets of flame blast up tunnels
Torching any unlucky spiders looking for a home
Rupturing the very earth around them
-  '  - The
Earthquake
No
It's a chain reaction
The whole valley is going to blow
We'll never get out in time
Gladys drives up in     Wade's humvee
Cigar in mouth
() 94
: Let's get the fuck out of here
The survivors pile into the truck as the town begins to in the distance
Chris is just about to climb aboard when
webline shoots out of the nearby mine shaft
Consuela lives
The spider is charred and bloody
But she's primed for revenge
Chris is yanked off his feet and hauled toward her
He fumbles for his machete and hacks at the webline
Cutting himself free just before getting impaled on Consuela's fangs
Consuela knocks away Chris's machete and lunges down at him
Chris kicks her belly with both his feet
Consuela begins to shudder
Jagged cracks appear in her charred carapace
Chris kicks and tears at the failing armor
He thinks he's harming the tarantula, but he's actually helping it
Mike and the others watch from the humvee
Oh no
she's molting
Consuela's blistered shell cracks as she shrugs the damaged skin away from her body
Chris is amazed to see the spider has grown a full size larger and become totally rejuvenated
Consuela comes after Chris
He defends himself with the machete
Shining steel makes contact with the dripping fangs
Once again Consuela punts away the machete
She prepares the death blow
It looks like curtains for Chris
Consuela
No
Bad
Bad Consuela
The massive spider stops in shock
Chris looks back to see Mike has returned
The familiar multi-perspective spider vision
The tarantula seems to recognize Mike

He throws his Cassiopeia  at the spider's face
Chris uses this moment of confusion to grab his machete and drive it deep into the spider's unprotected abdomen
The tarantula screams
Chris leaps up and runs, scooping up Mike
They dive into the back of the humvee
Consuela tries to follow but is mortally wounded
She collapses in the dust
The   in the b
g
The earth itself begins to collapse
-    - Gladys accelerates as the town sinks in the distance
Jets of flame burst upward
The mall is sucked into the widening pit of collapsing earth
The humvee is just a cart length ahead of a wave of crumbling desert
- The humvee reaches open road
The survivors watch out the back as Prosperity disappears into a massive sinkhole

-  - The group sits in a long beat of abject shock
And then Chris looks down to see his tight pants have finally ripped
really need some pants that fit
The group smiles
Happy to be alive
Look out
Everyone looks to the road ahead
familiar bunny rabbit hops across the highway
Gladys  and swerves to avoid it
- The bunny gets clear as the humvee drives away toward safety
() 96
: The rabbit continues its trek for a moment, and then is grabbed by a large trap-door spider
