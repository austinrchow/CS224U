His new items are lovingly added to the shelf
The Zippo joins a pre-existing

Wall- presses the "Play" button on his chest
The newly sampled It Only Takes  Moment () plays
The wind picks up

He looks out into the night
approaches off the bay
Unfazed, Wall- heads back in the truck
still gently playing
The massive wave of sand roars closer
Wall- raises the door
Pauses
for his cockroach to come inside
The door shuts just as the storm hits
Obliterates everything in view
- Wall- alone in the center of his shelter
Unwraps a   (think Twinkie)
Lays it out for the cockroach to sleep in
It happily dives in
Wall- collapses himself into a storable cube
Backs into an empty shelf space
Rocks it like a cradle

Wall- drops his Igloo
Chases after the dot
The dot leads Wall- deep into the polluted expanse

All racing into the valley over the contour of the terrain
Triangulating towards a center

She's the most beautiful thing he's ever seen
Eve hovers over the ground

Scans random objects and areas

He rushes for cover behind the nearest rock
Never takes his eyes off Eve
Watches her float away from the ship

Engines roar back to life

The rocket takes off
Smoke clears
Again, a red hot Wall- peeks out from the ground
Looks for Eve
She is watching the ship rise into the clouds
Waits until it is completely out of sight
then Eve rises high up into the air
She flies around the bay
Soars like a graceful bird
Does loops in the sky
Zooms right past Wall-'s rock
He is hypnotized
Eve descends gently to the ground

No sign of life
All business again
Hovers away to probe more of the planet
Wall- boxed up behind what little remains of the rock
Trembles uncontrollably
- Eve wanders through the pillars of cubed trash
Scans random areas
Wall- spies from the shadows
Too frightened to approach
She moves on
He follows
- Eve probes a mound of tires
Wall- hiding nearby
He flinches at the sight of innocently approaching Eve from behind
She spins around
Blasts the insect
Wall- is gut-punched
The cockroach climbs out of the smoking crater
Unscathed
Still curious
Eve finds the insect intriguing
Lowers her arm
The end separates into individual hovering sections
She lets the insect crawl up her arm
Wiggles into her workings
It tickles

Eve sonically picks up Wall-'s location
Locks onto him

Fires rapidly
Quick glimpses of Wall- dodging the blasts
Trash piles are systematically obliterated around him

Doesn't care
Can't believe she's real
The cockroach climbs down her gun arm
Jumps onto his master
Eve scans Wall-

Buzzes "negative"
He's not what she's looking for
She retracts her gun arm
Hovers off

Patiently watches Eve fly
She scans the ground below her, like a searchlight
Eve comes in for a landing below
Shuts down for the night
Wall- waits
Quietly sneaks down the refinery fire escape
Accidentally trips
Tumbles to the ground
Eve doesn't wake
Wall- creeps up to her
Opens his arms wide
and measures her
Turns to a pile of trash
Splits open his eyes
Begins welding something

The reaction startles Wall-
Eve slumps down against a dredged anchor
She gives up
Concerned, Wall- cautiously approaches
Sits at the other end of the anchor
Both robots stare silently at the fiery wreck
Then
slowly, very slowly, Wall- inches towards her
Musters the courage to speak, when -- She suddenly turns to him: (hums) [So what's your story

He moves to grab her

Moves closer to inspect it

She remains focused on the lighter
Wall- stares up at her
The tiny flame flickering between them
The Hello Dolly video plays  in the background
Suddenly, he is moved to express his love
Musters the courage to open his fingers
Timidly reaches his hand out to hers

Wall- instantly chokes
Pulls his hand back
Eve becomes intrigued with the
Scans the image of the lovers singing

Shoves his hands down

They'll hear us

Gestures for Wall- to stay put
Points to her

Before Wall- can even protest she is gone
Zooms silently across the Lido Deck
Up into the trash chute
It sits in space

Something's not right

Holds a toy   over his

[Rocket noises] Prepare for landing
[Landing noises] We're here everybody
Yeah, Captain
[crowd cheers] Captain we're home
It's so beautiful
[crowd cheers]
No it's nothing
was pleased to do it
It's all about you people -- Eve bursts out from it, like an angel
Blows the lid off
The Captain is stunned by this vision
She opens her chest to reveal
the plant
(amazed) How
How'd you find it
Eve hovers over to him
Salutes
Formally presents him the plant
He takes it in his hands
Still potted in the old boot
Gazes at it in wonder
We can go back home
for the first time
(laughs) What's it like now
Eve shrugs
Doesn't know how to answer
No, no
Don't tell me
want to see for myself
He turns to his console
Hits a button
rises from a panel
The Captain sticks it to the side of Eve's head
projects from the device
Plays back images of her time on Earth
rapidly scroll past
All displayed from Eve's : Being delivered to Earth
Flying above the devastated landscape
Blowing up a rock
Scans of numerous trash locations
62
Wait
that doesn't look like Earth
Where's the blue sky
He looks over to his computer screen
The     still on display
Compares them with what plays on Eve's screen
Where's the grass
His face drops
Slumps in defeat
The dream is over
' The   clip of  plays
It stirs the Captain out of his funk
He looks up at the screen
Leans in for a closer look
know that song
(observes the dancers' feet) And they're
dancing
Yes, dancing
rueful smile grows on his face
He looks down at It's tapping in time to the music
His gaze drifts over to the plant in his hands
He lifts it up
Makes the boot dance
You made it somehow, eh little guy
You didn't give up, did you
As if in response, the plant wilts slightly
leaf drops
(Gasp
) Oh no, no -- (remembers) Wait a minute
The Captain urgently hovers across the room
Eve left alone
Her recorded memories continue playing
The clip changes to It Only Takes a Moment
63
Eve recognizes the music
Watches the lovers on screen hold hands
Something familiar about the gesture
Looks at her own hands
Slowly, she interlocks her fingers
Eve's eyes go wide
This is what Wall- was trying to say to her
Her memories continue on the screen: a tap on the shoulder
Wall- presents her the plant -- The screen goes
Then
initiates
Wall-'s vigil for Eve plays out: protecting her from the rain
the sun
the sandstorm
keeping watch night and day
trying to jump start her heart
Amazed at Wall-'s selfless dedication to her
Realizes the meaning of Wall-'s love
(soft) Wall-
She looks at her hands again

Rehearses holding out his hand to Eve

Sneaks his way over to the

No answer
The chute has an endless drop
Wall- climbs in

Holds himself spread eagle to stay in place
Carefully inches his way up to the Captain's quarters
monorail pulls up

Still hot on Wall-'s trail
Scrubs the dirty tracks towards the bridge lobby
Then notices Wall-'s
leading to the trash chute

Gotcha

Waters the plant in the sink
There you go little guy
You came a long way for a drink of water

Not necessary, Captain

Heads for the elevator

Auto shoots back upstairs
Pops out another  in front of the elevator
Blocks the Captain
Sir,  insist you give me the plant
Auto, get out of my way
Sir, we cannot go home
What are you talking about
Why not
That is classified
Captain, give me the plant
(holds plant out of reach) What do you mean, "classified"
You don't keep secrets from the Captain

Give me the plant
Tell me what's classified

Operation Cleanup has, uh, well

Wouldn't you know, rising toxicity levels have made life unsustainable on Earth
Unsustainable
What
Darn it all, we're going to have to cancel Operation Recolonize
(dons his life vest) So just, uh
just stay the course
Rather than try to fix this problem, it'll just be easier if everyone remains in space

Alright, uh

The  races out of the room
The message cuts out
Auto turns to face the Captain
The Captain shakes his head in disgust
Now, the plant
No, wait a minute
Computer, when was that message sent to the Axiom
The paused image on the holo-screen highlights
Data begins to calculate on the screen
We see
It stops on "2110"
' Message received in the year 2110
That's -- that's nearly 700 years ago
Auto, things have changed
We've got to go back
Sir, orders are: "Do not return to Earth"

Look at this plant, green and growing
It's living proof he was wrong
Irrelevant, Captain

It's completely relevant

And it's in trouble

Must follow my directive
The Captain turns away in frustration
His eyes catch sight of the
Notices  in every one of them
Looking over all their shoulders
little closer every generation
The Captain slowly looks over his shoulder
and Auto is right behind him
The Captain looks at the plant in his lap
His countenance grows determined
He rights his hat
turns to face Auto
and gives the most authoritative order of his career: 'm the Captain of the Axiom

Points it at Gopher
The robot raises his epaulet arms

Gopher slowly advances towards Eve

Finally picks up the plant
Anticipates to throw it, when
Auto lowers right in front of him, trying to block

Eve moves to help Wall-
But Gopher traps her in his suspension beam

Drops her down the chute
She bangs against the sides as she tumbles

Blinks
The cockroach hops with joy
Eve is relieved
She holds out her hand to him
(with love) Wall-
Wall- gives her a blank stare
He turns away from Eve
Motors out the truck
She grabs him
Turns him back around
(It's me
) Eve
Wall- just stares
Doesn't seem to know who she is
(hums) [Here, look at these
] She grabs the '  and   from the shelf
The light bulb glows in her hand
She gives them to Wall-
No reaction
(Remember
) Wall-
Wall- looks blankly at the junk on the shelves
(hums) [ know
] She hovers over to the video player
Plays
Looks back to see if it has any effect
Wall- is over at the shelves
Has scooped all his prized possessions into his compactor
Crushes them into a cube
Eve is gut-punched

Wall- motors outside
Runs over the cockroach on his way out
The insect pops back to life
Watches his friend in shock
-'  - Wall- rolls up to a nearby trash pile
Scoops up trash
Spits out a cube
Eve hovers over to him
Still in disbelief
(somber) No
Wall- continues to stack his cubes
She stops him
Lifts his head
Stares into his eyes
Nobody home
Eve presses his "play" button
Nothing but
Eve begins to panic
Shakes him
Wall-
Wall-
-
No response
He's gone
She hovers in silence next to him for a long time
Finally, Eve grasps Wall-'s hand
Forces his fingers to interlace with hers
Holds him close one last time
Leans her head against his
Hums softly
[Hums ] She touches her forehead to his
Goodbye Wall-
between them
Eve turns to hover away
Jerked back
Her fingers caught between his
She checks his eyes again
Nothing
But then

a tiny
She looks down at their hands
-' They start to move
Slowly close around Eve's
She looks back at his face
Wall-'s eyes gradually come into focus
His brows raise
- Ee-vah
Wall-
He notices their hands entwined
His dream come true
- (amazed) Ee-vah
She giggles
The "Hello Dolly" tape reaches the finale of
"And that is all that love's about
" Eve and Wall- stare into each other's eyes
- and the Rejects finally reach the truck
They begin to celebrate
Wall-'s alive
Then - realizes they need privacy
Herds the Rejects
- Go
Go, go go
Wall- and Eve's foreheads touch
Together now and ever more

Small hands water it gently
to reveal it surrounded by kids
The Captain instructs them
John and Mary help unload equipment from the Axiom
Robots and passengers stream off the ship
This is called "farming"
You kids are going to grow all kinds of plants: vegetable plants, pizza plants
(laughs) Ahh, it's good to be home

Through the trash towers of the city
