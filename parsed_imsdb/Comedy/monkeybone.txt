In fact, he's solemn as a judge - peering nervously around to see how the rest of the audience is responding
Why
Because he's the cartoonist who created the characters on screen
In his looks (gangly, disheveled) and manner (sardonic, self- deprecating), he's the obvious model for the character of

Creator of America's most disturbed comic strip

Mister Stu Miley

He looks genuinely stunned
He can't believe it's happening

beautiful, heavily-pierced   hands  a marker
Mr
Miley, would you draw Monkeybone on my belly
As a guide
Guide
For my tattoo artist
She exposes her taut midriff
thinks for a moment, then goes to work
When he's done, Monkeybone appears to be climbing out of the girl's pants and  to her
Nearby
Wait
You have to draw the rest of him - She begins unbuckling her belt so  will have enough room to draw Monkeybone's bottom half
demurs
-  have to, uh, check in with my doctor
- He wanders across the room, finds  deep in conversation with a bunch of other , and pulls her aside
Hey, Doc
Come here
There's something really cool  want to show you
He grabs her by the sleeve, pulls her across the floor to - -   - There's nothing "cool" about it - it's a stairway landing, with metal fire doors that open onto the parking lot outside
See these doors
The cool thing is, you go out they close
you can't get back in
He opens one door and holds it for
You want to leave
But Stu - you're a big hit
Everyone loves you
They don't love me
They love Monkeybone
It was you who got the standing
It was you drawing on the belly over there
That was especially Monkeybone
Come on, Doc, don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps
just want to be us
Home
Alone
(conspiratorially) have something  have to give you
Can't you give it to me later
Yeah,  could, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be
better
He gives up trying to explain
pulls her close and kisses her
For a moment they completely forget about the party in the next room
Then  appears behind them, trying to catch 's eye as he waits for the clinch to break up
Finally he pries them apart: Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute
Now Stu - know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys - Julie and  - we were just gonna go
But before  knows what's hit him,  is leading him back to - -   - Go
There's a potload of money here, pal
You got three major toy companies

Herb, it's too much
It's all out of hand
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here
You gotta strike

It's just a trap
Being rich is not a trap
That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them

Why

Tonight's the night
He nods toward , who's at the open bar grabbing two glasses of punch
realizes a proposal is in the works
Oh my God
you're proposing
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she
fixed it
She made me happy
Which 'd never been
She loves me the way  am - right now

It's like negotiating a labyrinth
Look at this
He won't let us leave
Who
The monkey
He's everywhere
He'll take over both our lives if we let him
Stu - stop it
That monkey is good luck
You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich
So relax
Enjoy it
'm trying
It's weird, that's all
never had any good luck, until  met you
what if it's all just another bad dream
What's the "bad" part

(laughing; taking his hand) If you do, 'll be right there beside you
So face it
You're just going to have to be happy

It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life
He says it so solemnly that she cracks up
After a moment he joins in

There's a strong wind tonight, and one guy of his end of the banner just as he gets it detached

He chuckles
That damn monkey is everywh-- Suddenly his view of the street
The   has fallen    , like a huge
All he can see is a great, grinning
Unable to see, he slams on the brakes and Off screen:
The horrible crunch of But Stu's car comes to a halt untouched
After a moment he opens his eyes
and  opens hers
Did we just - hit something
don't think so
Are you okay
She thinks it over, nods
takes a moment to catch his breath, then opens the door gingerly
as a car speeds past in the opposite lane, nearly taking 's door off
He jumps back inside, waits, opens the door again
- His eyes widen in horror as he steps out to survey the scene
The asphalt is strewn with   - stuffed dolls, games, lunchboxes
show where the  which was carrying all this and slammed into the rear of a  , pinning it up against a races up to the Buick
Its front end is mashed up like an accordion, but the occupants - a couple of  dressed for the prom - seem to be okay
Hey
Are you guys all right in there
We're fine
That stupid monkey banner
It fell on my windshield - it practically killed us all
(to ) God, Julie, if anything had happened to you - 'm fine, baby
We're all okay
We were lucky
'd better go report this
He spots a   and starts across the street
On the way there he plucks a    off the pavement and   with both hands
stays behind with the prom kids
The   in his tux is glassy-eyed, miserable beyond description

Finally he glances up - just in time to see the   coming down toward the phone booth like a gigantic sledgehammer
His eyes widen
The   slips from his grasp

The screen fades to   for a few seconds
until we hear a , and an  comes swimming into focus
' : He's in the back of an ambulance, with  all around him, working feverishly
hovers above him, holding his hand
Stu

It's me
It's Julie

You're gonna be okay, baby,  promise - All at once he seems to be  from  and the others - as if the bottom of the stretcher, and  - through the floor of the ambulance
's voice grows weaker, more distant: (
) 'm here, baby
won't leave you
And then all trace of the ambulance is gone, and he's floating down through some strange , surrounded by the silhouettes of billowing , with the sound of   all around him
An     fills the soundtrack
's eyes close - and when they reopen, he finds himself in: - tiny -  descends from dense clouds down the length of an impossibly long and rickety

Special occasion

Don't get all poignant

She's obviously disturbed by it, but she can't tear her eyes away
She's still gaping at the painting when  enters in a terrycloth robe
Who did this
Stu
That was right about the time we met
When he first came in to the sleep lab
Yeah
before your time
The canvas depicts a group of  with the faces of wolves
They're standing over a  , replacing his internal organs with The style is at once cartoony and unsettling
Jesus, honey
he always joked about you curing him, but  never realized what you cured him from
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years
The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting
(chuckling) That boy looked like pluperfect hell
's gaze goes from the nightmare paintings to the  strips tacked up over the drafting table
How do you get from here - to there
Switch hands
What
'm serious
It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance
He was a rightie, so  made him switch the pencil to his left hand
Just to see what'd come out
smile comes to 's face
She settles in on the floor beside and digs through the various portfolios until she comes up with a quickie  on the back of a napkin - the prototype for
Monkeybone
Left-handed, he was funny
He'd been doing all this scary, intense work
then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that
(shrugging) And then the nightmares just
stopped
Wow - two guys in the same brain
- Which one did you fall in love with

Oh, Julie

my poor baby brother
When'd you get in

can't even bear to look at him
How about you
You're okay
'm fine, Kimmy
Fine
had so much  always wanted to say to him
At least he had a chance to give you the ring
The ring
Grandmama's ring
The engagement ring
He asked me to send it to him - turns to look at  in the bed
The certain knowledge that he was about to propose is like a knife in her heart
feels bad as well, having let the cat out of the bag, but before they can hash it out - Mrs

Edelstein
Cheery

He shakes hands with the women, then checks 's readouts, making notations on his clipboard
Vital signs have stabilized
That's good
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances
He's held on this far
We can't do much but wait and see
But these
machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right
This remark sends a shiver down 's spine, but she keeps silent
At the moment, yes
Can you give me a realistic idea
of how long this is going to last
Comas are unpredictable
He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now
Honey,  have to clarify this
The thing is, Dr
Edelstein, my brother has an absolute horror of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it - Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on
He doesn't even know he's in a - Please, Julie
This is not easy for me
Our father took a long time to die
long time
It just about killed us all
And Stu and  made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out
It's too soon even to - talk about that
Give me a date, Doctor
Three months
(pause) There's always some brain damage
But at three months
the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day
want him to have every chance, Doctor
We can certainly give it
three months
No one says anything
But both women look at , and then at each other, and everyone knows exactly where everyone else stands

Onscreen,   is sweating bullets
He has no idea what to say, and the audience is beginning to laugh at him
In a desperate, feeble attempt to buy time
he begins to
'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair
In fact he goes into a little softshoe, keeping the briefcase poised over his crotch
Unfortunately,    , dumping frilly all over the stage
The weeping  must crawl around on all fours to retrieve it
By now the onlookers at the bar are
All except one - the lonely, disconsolate fellow on the last stool, nursing a martini -
Hey, Stu, why so glum
Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare
Three months, Bull
Three months tonight
Three months since the accident - and 'm no closer to going home than  was then
Aw, buck up
Have another 'tini
'm sick of martinis
'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's nightmares
And of course,  need not add - He  at , who's stretched out atop the mighty Wurlitzer at the other end of the room
The   is singing a Dietrich number, "The Laziest Gal in Town" - or at least trying to, because  is caterwauling behind her
By the time she gets to the grand finale, he's practically
Pissed off, she  her  at  and pulls the lid of her clamshell
This suits  just fine, as it leaves him alone in the spotlight to soak up what little applause there is
Thank you, thank you for that very modest response
know you're all in comas, but still
And now
it's dedication time
He gestures to , the elephant organist, who begins to vamp
We've got a special dedication tonight
This one's from my ever-lovin' boss, Mr
Stu Mopey - mean Miley - and we're sendin' it up to a very special lady in the land of the living
Yes,  do mean Julie - the beautiful Miss Julie - who, if she has a brain in her head, is shacked up right now with some good-lookin' doc she met in the

Because if we know anything about Miss Julie, we know she is faithful, loyal, and true
Even if her boyfriend is an eggplant
Which is why we're dedicating
this very special tune
to her

trouper to the end,   at the crowd even as  drags him off to an empty table in the farthest corner of the room
You have humiliated me in public for the last time

Besides,  can't help myself

Aw, come on
You know you love me
You're a masochistic pain freak
You gotta love me

You are too
Mooning over Julie when we could both be gettin' some o' this fine local action
It's not like she's gonna know
Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't count
Sorry
The women here aren't my type
Most of them aren't even my species
Cocktail waitress , a seven-foot cat-faced feline sex bomb, arrives in her skimpy black dress and shows  a Cheshire-cat grin reclines, Odalisque-style, on the table
Hellooooooooo, Kitty
Hiya, Stu

You seem so tense
Aaah, it's the same as always

That way at least she'd know how  feel
That way she'd

And so does - although he's not quite as obvious about staring

You're one in a million

Her furry tail begins to swing back and forth playfully in the air

For there, in the doorway, is a looming, ominous figure - the most dreaded figure in all of Dark Town - - a  , nine feet tall and swinging a scythe, come to take some hapless coma victim to the land of Death
and the shroud  in the night breeze as the looks from face to face
For a moment he focuses on backs away involuntarily, with a mounting sense of dread
and jumps into his arms, clinging to him fearfully
But the  moves on - past each   in turn - finally in front of a , ,    in a wheelchair, who looks to be 110 years old at least

stares at him with naked envy
No
No
Not him
So long, suckers
See you in the funny papers

One by one, get up from their seats to watch 's departure
-  - The   shuffle toward a   across the midway
It's a "  " machine - the kind where you slam down a mallet and try to ring the bell
It's surrounded by crocodile moats and storm fences and electrified barbed wire, and a big sign reading -
, still jubilant, inserts his -ticket into a receptacle at the entrance
, and   cranks up, and blink on, and  rocket into the sky
All around them, faces turn skyward
are parting
An  of swirling colors is forming   the -ticket ride - and a opens up at its center
The "  " machine has been outfitted with a  where the bell-ringer should be
Once  has settled in, a lifts its enormous mallet

Then, with a distinct , he's gone

How come he goes back and  stay here
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket

He got an -ticket
Where's mine
When do  get to wake up

But  isn't intimidated
He grabs another ball and winds up

The , scared shitless, jumps back on his bike and   as the ball whizzes past

When the bike hits the end of the finger, it   into the void and

The god of nightmares
Do you know what this means, Monkeybone
He's finally going to hear my case
'm going home
: '   - As she's done every morning for the last three months,  brushes '
Although she looks a bit more worn and haggard than when we saw her last, she always affects a cheerful manner around  - on the off chance that he might be aware of her presence
She packs the toothbrush away, runs a hand along his stubbly cheek
think we can go another day without shaving
Long as you don't look like you're growing one of those stupid little goatees
She opens up the entertainment section of the daily newspaper
Hey, there's an article about the Monkeybone show
They've run that one episode about eight times now
Herb says it gets higher ratings every time
they're hoping you'll give 'em some new material soon
(long, bored pause) Wanna hear another joke
She refolds the paper and reaches into a bedside drawer for a paperback entitled The Book of Raunch
She pages through it for a moment
Okay
let me see
here we go

You swiped this joke for a Monkeybone strip
She whacks him on the arm with the book
No response at all
Okay
Let's try again
Why did the pervert cross the road
The sound of  interrupts her joke
She looks up and sees standing in the doorway, red-eyed and crying
Kimmy
What's the matter
This is hard for me, Julie
very hard
but it's been three months now, and
(long pause) gave the order
just stares at her for a beat or two, refusing to understand
Then it sinks in
Her hand goes to her mouth in horror and grief
: -  - up the seemingly endless length of the  - up, up,  a heavy layer of clouds, to the    of the building
which is festooned with oodles of 18-

rotating disco ball flashes colored light on walls, floors, and ceilings covered with shockadelic -
Now this
is livin'
Of course, a party needs party animals - and the  on the scene are in fine fettle, working up a sweat on the dance floor ' has three turntables spinning at once
As  wanders through, he gets a big surprise
Reproductions of his old are hanging on the walls
They've been turned into - for the coming attractions at the Morpheum
'call that art
Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that
Like you'd know
You started out on the back of a napkin, you little
doodle
Scowling at each other, the boys turn their backs and part ways
We follow  to the wet bar, where he almost immediately bumps into a statuesque  with a full head of writhing
Hey
Like the do
So tell me, are you a, uhh
natural snakehead
Only fifty dollars to find out
Fifty dollars
Bite me
You got it, big boy
He grins and shrugs: what the hell
As they head for a back room, the hands him a
look of apprehension crosses 's face
But before he can change his mind, the '  yanks him out of frame
, meanwhile, is crossing the dance floor, moving among glittering animal-people who  in their bizarre, uninhibited way
- - the bottom half of her body a big human  -  at  as he passes
He tries to talk to her, but she's dancing, and with five constantly moving legs it's difficult to get in close
Say, have you seen Mr
Hypnos
Hyp
He was here a while ago
Aren't you Stu Miley
The nightmare guy
grins meekly, nods yes
She pulls him over to dance
heard you were going to be here tonight
This is so cool
the   is dancing in ungainly fashion nearby
His trunk swings out and hits one of the  ' arms - which   like marble statuary
Before she can let out a squeal, he does it again
Now she's armless - a regular Venus de Milo
You fat slob
Watch what you're doing
Why don't you slap me
Go on, slap me
Come on, Stu
Let's go where the real fun is
She leads him over to the sunken living room
Among the other guests, we see a , a , a
number of sofas and lounge chairs are arranged around a big crystal  in the center of the room
The  is where nightmares happen
Although the perspective shifts and the locales change abruptly, as in a movie, all the nightmares have a 3- quality - as if they're taking place right here in the room with us
Wow
Live feed, huh
You bet
Hyp gets all the best stuff before it goes out to the theatres
grins in anticipation
He finds an empty chair and starts to sit down - but there's a  with a '  already in it
' Sorry
picks another seat
The   sidles up alongside him
Shh
There's a new one just starting
( ) In long shot we see a handsome young couple dressed in paisley prints
Emerging from a sylvan glade, they kiss in golden sunlight
Then the breaks free - sprints through knee-high sunflowers to the middle of the field, where a picnic blanket is waiting
- as he recognizes the man in the paisley shirt
That - that's me
Nice shirt, dude
( ) - Paisley-shirted  pours champagne for two
Toasts his beloved - who is, of course, , the dreamer of the dream
He pulls out a little velvet   and offers it to her
But when she tries to take it, he pulls it away, teasing her, and
Suddenly the two of them are locked in a tight embrace, rolling together through the flowers, , full of joy
'  - The  are rubbing their hands together in anticipation of horrors to come
looks from one misshapen face to the next, his heart pounding with dread
What is this
Who's dreaming this
(beat) Julie
Hey, keep it down
( ) - rolls onto her back on the grass,
Only to realize
that
She looks around
Gets to her feet
Turns
And the  behind her suddenly into
( ) The room is decorated for a  , complete with streamers and confetti
,
, various   and are wearing party hats, lifting champagne glasses in a toast to the guest of honor
the comatose Stu
'  - The  clustered around the orb can barely conceal their animal excitement
It's obvious that the nightmares they're watching are more than mere entertainment - they get some kind of addictive, visceral charge from the spectacle of human terror
He tries to push his way forward to the orb
An angry  elbows him aside
grabs his coat and pushes him out of the way
Stu
What are you doing
Chill out
( ) stands in the center of the room,  and  in a party hat
weird   extends from his navel to a huge groaning   - like an artificial lung, it's all that keeps him breathing
hands a pair of    to , and she   , as if opening a new mall
Applause all around races toward  in slo-mo,  - - as he  into a     before her eyes
No
No
'  - 's distress is killing him
Yet all around him,  are cackling their heads off, growling, howling, punching their fists in the air like rowdy drunks at a football game
He
' ,
' '
He won't be stopped this time
He makes for the orb - climbing over sofas, pushing guests aside, knocking over their drinks - Watch it, you stinkin' gringo - '
Somehow,  has heard him
Down in the nightmare orb, her dream self is looking , trying to locate the source of 's disembodied voice
He struggles to reach the orb, but the  is holding him back
Stu
breaks free and   on the  - which   in a haze of smoke and sparks, abruptly ending the nightmare
's image vanishes - and  gropes at the air,
'   - The real  awakens suddenly and lets out a scream of her own
Only now does she realize where she is
She's fallen asleep in the visitor's chair next to 's bed
The clock on the wall reads 1:15
'  are spiking like crazy
'  -   - is being dragged across the dance floor by the  and brings up the rear
Who invited this schmuck, anyway
Oh, it's my fault
thought he was cooler than that
Listen
Please
It's my girlfriend
've gotta get a message to her
But just then a hush falls over the room, and someone screams
' does a 180-degree turn, and a   rotates into the room
Languishing atop it, garbed in a silk robe which exactly matches the black & white checkerboard pattern of the bedspread
is a , , - , with horns and hooves are with him on the bed, brushing his furry goat legs and feeding him grapes
As  fights his way over, he sees an odd  wriggling under the bedcovers
Out pops , clutching a bottle of champagne
knew  left it in there somewhere
He shakes the bottle, pops the cork, and    at , the , and everyone else within firing range
Haw
like a monkey with vision
You said it, partner
Hilarity all around
snatches  off the bed - How'd you get in there
Stu
It's a party
Mr
Hypnos - sir -  needed to talk to you - Wait a minute
Stu Miley, right
Boys and girls Mr
Stu Miley, in the house
(leading a round of applause) This is an honor
We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like caviar, man
You da shits
Mr
Hypnos,  saw a dream
My girlfriend was having it
She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me
She was watching me die
Uh huh
And
Well,  have to get a message to her
have to let her know 'm okay
Until  can get out of here
vaguely embarrassed look crosses 's face
All the nearby stare at their shoes, clear their throats
which is actually what  wanted to talk to you about
See, 've been here three months - With a brusque gesture,  sends the party girls packing
He slings one arm around 's shoulder and pulls him aside
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party
Tell me what
It's a special kind of party
farewell party
Do you
get what 'm saying
Farewell
You mean - you mean 'm - He practically dances a jig
'
'
,
'
One by one, the celebrants turn their backs and slink discreetly away
think
'm about to
Am  mistaken, or don't  get to
Is there some
'see, Stu, as  understand it, you made this pact with your sister
no life support
's jaw drops
He slaps himself across the forehead
Pact
Pact
Well - yeah - but that doesn't
apply
It was different then
was depressed
My life is great now
'm in love
marches back and forth across the bed, wearing a dimwit's expression as he   in a singsongy voice
Pull the plug
Pull the plug
Take my organs don't need 'em
don't need no
Life support
'm an idiot
Pull the pl-- grabs the monkey and clamps a hand over his mouth
Besides, Julie wouldn't
she'd never
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide
That's why she was having the nightmare
(an embarrassed shrug) They're pulling the plug at nine
Nine
But that's - twelve hours
In checking his watch,  removes his hand from 's mouth
The singsong resumes
'm so dumb
deserve to die - Mr
Hypnos, you run this place
'm begging you
There's gotta be something  can do
Stu,  like you personally,  admire your work, but 'm just the God of Sleep
This is Death's bailiwick
Maybe you could talk to Death
Me
Me, go crawling to Death
My friend, it will be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before go crawling to that piece of - shuts up
Looks around the room, as if he's afraid of being overheard
Then he gestures to the boys to join him on the bed
They climb aboard eagerly
hits his remote
'  - and they rotate  from the party
Privacy at last
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me
Death is a putz - and  should know
'm his little brother
You're Death's brother
Oh yeah
Mr
By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death
Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of that schtick
(spreading his hands) So  need a job
He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it
'm supposed to be grateful
The penthouse is pretty swank, though
Thank you
decorated it myself
Guys,  don't mean to be rude, but  only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to
Oh, right
Cheating Death
There's one thing you might try
Only one guy in history ever pulled it off
Well, actually two
Actually, no, there was that other guy who
well, very few people have done it
Hyp, 'll do anything
Me too
And  mean anything
Ask the chicks in the back room
You've seen those -tickets, right
Well, what you gotta do
is go into the Land of Death
and steal an -ticket right out from under Death's nose
Land of Death
How do  get there
Kid, listen: that's all 'm saying
And you didn't hear it from me
hits the remote
The bed begins to   again
You've heard of a fate worse than Death
That's what's waiting for you if you screw up
'  - gives the boys a wink and a thumbs-up, then wanders off to shmooze his other guests
shakes 's hand
Fate worse than death
Well, it's been real, boss, but  gotta go buff up my resume Fine
Don't put yourself out
'll go to the land of Death alone
Stu, you have my absolute confidence
- (grabbing him by the throat) 've got one chance to get back to Julie, and 'm gonna take it - with or without you
He turns and stalks off
stands there blinking
Hey
Aren't you gonna talk me into it
No
Goodbye
Thanks for nothing
Stunned,  scurries along behind him,
You gotta talk me into it
You'll screw up on your own
mean, a guy's gotta have a sidekick
For moral support
Wisecracks - snappy banter - (wrapping himself around 's leg) It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death
Don't go in there without your comedy relief
All right
You can come
,
-- (suddenly realizing) Something went very, very wrong here
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there
As if in reply, a ,   comes drifting across the dance floor - an eight-foot-tall
The boys duck behind a   to watch as he zeroes in on the - where a beautiful coma victim, , is drunkenly making out with another sloshed corpse-to-be,
doesn't notice
She continues grappling with
Muttering, the dives in and tries to disentangle them
,     - Shay, you're kinda cute
She ditches  and throws her arms around the
Repulsed, he pushes her away, props her against the nearest wall - - and   with one bony finger above the heart
It's like throwing a switch
Her body stiffens
Her  cross
Her  droops out of her mouth
She makes a noise like a
The true horror of death is that it makes you look like a total idiot
The  pulls a collapsible   from beneath his shroud and starts maneuvering  onto it
Say there
How 'bout one for the road
The  ignores him
holds up a cocktail glass
Hold this for me, pally
The  heaves a sigh and takes the cocktail glass
grabs a pitcher filled with some luminescent tropical concoction
and   down the 's front
Ooopsy daisy
- at the  in his sopping wet, pink-stained shroud
Is that what they call "death with dignity"
The  wrings out his shroud and grabs the hand truck
As he wheels past the boys,  pops up with a helpful hint: Two words for you, my friend: club soda
claps a hand over 's mouth as the  turns down a hall
- The still-muttering  wheels  toward the entrance to Dark Town
The boys are skulking along behind him at a discreet distance
He's taking her to the land of Death, right
So all we've gotta do is
hitch a ride
(beat) Stop shaking
'll protect you
Oh, sure
Mr
Action Hero
Why couldn't  be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment
The  approaches the
He presses a remote-control  and the meshing teeth of the gates slide back far enough to let him pass through
realizes they've only got an instant to make their move
He through the gates at top speed
As soon as he's on the other side, he hears a nasty  behind him
is caught - his body contorted like a pretzel, woven in and out among the meshing teeth
gives him a good hard , and he slips out like a strand of fettuccine
They hear  on the tracks outside

-   - The  loads  into the little roller-coaster and climbs aboard
The car begins to move
and  get there just in time to jump onto the   in the back
- -  - They peep over the back of the car at the  and wonder what to do next
spies a   mounted under the rack - opens it, and pulls out a big, nasty
The boys nod in agreement
clambers over the back of the car and hoists the wrench
covers his eyes
looks up - sees a confused  alone in the car with
Now he clambers into the car as well
Where'd he go
don't know
There's no trace of the  - except for a rumpled shroud, a wristwatch, and a St
Christopher's medal on the floor of the car
The boys exchange a puzzled shrug
tries on the watch
: - - The wall clock says it's not quite 3 , yet  has managed to round up all her co-workers: , , , et al
They're groggy, disheveled, un-made-up, unshaven
But they're there
Six hours
That's when they pull the plug
That's how long we've got to wake him up
(beat) Now these are Stu's old charts from five years ago, when he first came to the sleep lab
She points to a series of  where  and  have been tacking up  printouts, engram maps, etc
they show incredibly intense nightmare activity
The chart below is his new chart
The lower chart shows a   virtually identical to the one on the upper chart
pauses for effect - then pulls on the edge of the lower chart,    like a gatefold - The onlookers
Opened accordion-style, the lower chart shows the recurring again and again,
Holy shit
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop
(beat) Anybody here know what Oneirix is
Sure - it's an enzyme
The brain secretes it during violent dream activity
It's nightmare juice
Julie and  were on the team that learned to synthesize it
If those charts are right, Stu's swimming in the stuff
(puzzled) Are you thinking we can decrease the levels
No
want to give him more
want to give him a massive dose
That's not going to stop his nightmare - don't want to stop the nightmare, Hutch want to crank it up
want to take it right off the charts
want to scare him awake
The group exchanges nervous glances: it's risky
claps her hands: All right
We have a plan
Let's move
As the group swings into action,  pulls  aside
You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky
You don't know what it'll do to his brain
What'll it do if they pull the plug

There's an open crate of   on his desk
Dead souls take the form of

As the line moves along, we notice an odd-looking  nearing the desk
His gait is wobbly
His head bobs independently of the rest of his body
There's a big, luminescent  on the front of his shroud
as  points a bony finger   the wobbly with the iridescent stain
You're the customer, okay
You're about to die

Sorry, Steve, maybe next time
And how's our new guest settling in -

Easy, pal
was coming to congratulate you
It ain't easy snatching one of those -tickets
Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago
Why'd you do it
What'd  ever do to you
It's simple, Stu
We need nightmares - lots of 'em
So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow
a nightmare maker
Like Steve here
Poe
Rasputin
we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan
But why me
Why'd you pick on me
The monkey, of course
It was his idea
Monkeybone
Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu
So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition
We help him get your body
in return he gives us all the nightmares we want
You're nuts
'm a comic strip artist
What's he gonna do - draw really scary cartoons
Oh, no, no, no
'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams
And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice
's face goes white as he realizes the point of the master plan
Oh, we're predicting a record box-office
It's like  always say
nightmares are your best entertainment

Please forgive me

Chill
We've still got a pact
If anything ever happens to you, 'll be right there to return the favor
(baring his teeth) So drive carefully
From now on
He climbs out
is so rattled that she smacks bumpers with the car parked in front of her
She   with the hand brake still on
& '  - - and  enter with luggage
He stands there for a moment scoping out the unfamiliar surroundings
She sets the bags down, taps him on the shoulder
Welcome home
- grins insipidly
She kisses him, pulls him into a tight embrace - and then, overwhelmed by emotion, begins to
Oh, baby,  can't believe you're back
- Home sweet home, huh
Actually,  was expecting something a little swankier
How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway
She gives him an extremely puzzled look
- Meaning me, of course
'm referring to myself
You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise
Baby
Why don't you just
rest on the sofa for a minute
'll be right back
She goes into the kitchen as - plops onto the sofa
He spies a bowl of   on the coffee table and immediately tries to pick up a banana with his
But he can't
He's got shoes on
Frowning, he unties his shoe, peels off his sock
His bare foot is in the fruit bowl when  returns from the kitchen with a  holding a chocolate cake and the bottle of Stu bought three months ago
The cake bears the message "  - " in pink icing
She sits beside him with the goodies
He removes his foot from the bowl, crosses his legs,    at her
She smiles uncertainly
Then she opens the bottle of champagne and pours two flutes full
Here's to a bottle
we should have opened
three months ago
She finishes pouring, hands a flute to -
His face is smeared with  and
He's scooped out a big fistful and crammed it right into his pie hole
He  at her
- Bitchin' good cake
Stu, are you
feeling okay
- Sure
Why
You're acting kind of
odd
- (grabbing another fistful) In what way
Then: we hear   skittering across the hardwood floors at high speed
And    races into the living room
Buster
Look who's here

The dog is yipping, wagging his tail insanely at the sight of his long-lost master - until he gets just a little bit closer, and senses that something is very, very wrong

She tries to pass, but he grabs the belt of her robe and spins her around
He delicately unwraps the turban, then opens her robe and pulls it closed around the two of them
They kiss
You sure this is
medically advisable
- Got a doctor on duty
Well
As long as it's okay with Monkeybone - - almost lets out a gasp of shock
What does she mean

The good news is, she doesn't suspect
The bad news is, he's apparently named after his creator's penis

Through the bedroom doorway we see - and waltzing romantically, belly to belly, still wrapped up in the single robe

Terrified, she rolls out of the way

He tries to stand, but his rubbery legs give way, and he pitches over -     on the nightstand

He's sure got a thing for those icy blondes
The   appears to announce: Miley
You got a visitor
Kitty
At the sight of  behind bars, she breaks down
'm so sorry, Stu
wanted to tell you what was going on
really, really liked you
Kitty
my situation is really not important
The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey
You're such a beautiful man
Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her
Listen to me
Is there any way  can warn her what Monkeybone is up to
Time's up
Break it up, you two
The   pushes  back with a prod

No
Give me a moment
Just to look at him

Are you sure you'll be okay
- Oh yeah
There's just one thing  don't get
"Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story
That's front page news

(shuffling through the paper) Hey
Don't  have a  show
They only made the one episode
They've shown it about nineteen times
- need a new  guy
grins, plants a goodbye smooch on his forehead, and exits
He waits a minute, then reaches for the
: - The house is crawling with
There must be three dozen and  and   hanging on 's every pronouncement
- Yes, being in a coma taught Stu Miley a thing or two about life
Buckle your seat belts, for one
But seriously, Stu Miley is a different man today

The front door opens
stunned  pushes her way inside
- And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy
had to park two blocks away
Is something - He pulls her to his side for a photo op
go off
took the liberty of calling a little press conference
We're on , so don't say "shit
" (covering his mouth) Shit
said it
Shit
said it again
Stu, what is it about Monkeybone that makes him so popular
- Well, it's partly that he punctures all the phony pretensions of our modern society
and it's partly that he's a breathtakin', heartbreakin', rump-shakin' sex machine
(beat) Ask these gentlemen here
They're an important cog in my media machine
They'll be doing six new episodes of the Monkeybone show under my personal supervision
He pauses for a photo op with   and
- It's all synergy
The show synergizes the strip, which synergizes the merchandising, which synergizes the religion, which synergizes the Barbara Walters special; and then, baby, we are all in the United Empire of Monkeybonia
-   - squeezes through the crowd, finds  working the phone
tell you, he's ready to merchandise
We've gotta move quickly
Get the toy guys, the burger guys, the lunchbox guys - Herb
what in God's name - holds up a finger
He's too busy talking
- enters with the video crew in tow
somehow manages to sideline him
What's this about merchandising
You always hated merchandising
- Well, baby,  do, but to look at it from another angle
there's a potload of money here
: - underneath as - comes running around a corner - followed, a moment later, by a   of in black miniskirts and high heels
It's like something out of Hard Day's Night, only more so
- on -, head still bandaged, eyes closed,  slightly
He wears a big monkey grin as he  the above
- They kill their engine in the middle of a busy intersection and climb out to join the mob chasing -
He cuts around a corner, ducks into an alley, and behind a dumpster
As the girls run past, he pulls out a handkerchief and   from his brow
Then, with a what-the-hell twinkle, he steps out and into the midst of the

The chase resumes
Suddenly he realizes he's
running in -
Same deal with the girls on his trail
After a moment, he
He can't move anything except his ; he looks right, left, up, down
and suddenly he sees  winking into view directly in front of him
is perfectly capable of moving
He strolls right up to the frozen - and   , Moe Howard-style
You two-bit simian stooge We didn't send you up here to shake your booty and chase broads
We sent you up to make nightmares
- tries to speak
All that comes out is a slo-mo
Now find that nightmare juice and get to work
'Cause you may be a free man during the day
but when you dream, your monkey ass is mine
He winds up - throws a   at -'
- - sits up suddenly in bed
For a moment he's relieved - it was all a dream
Then he realizes his  is swelling like a prizefighter's
His front tooth is loose
is streaming from his nose
- Eep
- He's awake, fully dressed, and fishing around in the pocket of 's topcoat
He finds her   and tiptoes furtively to the front door
- Friggin' Hypnos
'll show him
- He unlocks the door and enters the darkened lab
Finds the dispensary area and kneels beside a
Then he shuffles through the keys on the ring until he finds one labelled "
" On the top shelf is a corked beaker of purple fluid bearing the label "" with red  stickers all over it
- takes it out, flashes a sinister grin, and    into a similar beaker
Then he refills the original from a hip flask and replaces it
He's just about to leave when he's startled by a series of and  - which are  in : Hey, handsome
He turns and spots a    who's confmed to a  in the corner
The conversation continues in
Yeah, you
Come here, good-looking
(beat) Why don't you let me out of this cage
- Hey, 'd love to, baby, but
it'd put me in hot water
(caressing his chin) know how to be very, very grateful
He pulls out a  and scribbles a number on it
- Tell you what, angel
When you get out, give me a call
goes on suddenly in the outside hallway
- tries to dive for cover, but the   grabs him by the belt and pulls him against the cage
Startled, he drops the   - which rolls out into the hall
- The beaker   as it rolls through the lab door
-' grope through the doorway - but the   has got him by the pants leg and won't let go, no matter how much he rattles the cage
He can't quite pull himself through the door
He unbuckles the belt
Keeps clawing toward the beaker
But he still can't quite make it, and the  won't let go
Now his pants are down around his knees
He keeps wriggling until his pants legs are entirely   - and still he can't quite reach the beaker
His shoes are caught in his pants cuffs
Freedom
Minus his pants, he
In  through all this is a dim teenage  pushing his electric floor polisher
He has his Walkman on and he can't hear any of the mayhem behind him
He sings along atonally with the music: Gettin' jiggy wit' it - gettin' jiggy wit' it
- disheveled -, back from his secret mission, is trying to take his clothes off so he won't wake
But she starts to rouse, so he jumps into bed fully dressed and pulls up the covers
Stu
Is that you
Where did you go
- Me
Nowhere
was asleep
Baby, don't lie
know you went out
- Not me
Nope
You must've been dreaming
She pulls the covers back
He's still wearing his topcoat, shoes, socks, and shorts
but

Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay
(shrugging) guess 'm yours now
Death, 'd like to point out that none of this was my fault
The roots of this tragedy go back to a callous, uncaring society that - lets out a   and      together
Man and monkey are surely squished
But when  opens his hands, is still there, cupped safely in his palms
Hey
Where's Monkeybone
Back in your head, where he belongs
(beat) No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla
didn't want to send you back without him
Back
You're sending me back
It's irregular, but
just love that strip of yours
figure 'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead
Death
Thank you
Thank me next time you see me
He sends       with a single flick of his finger
Then he turns
Ohhhh, Hypnos
pitch the quivering satyr out into the middle of the town square
Death
So nice to see you
can explain - He looks up tremulously
falls across him
followed by a - in a 's arms at the exit to the zoo
don't know what happened
All  know is
he was in a coma
and then he came back
and now he's gone again
They wander out
Behind them, a squad of  are confiscating from squawling children as they file out
-   - The  , on gurneys, are being loaded into the back of the police ambulance
The  and his team come wandering up
Excuse me
We lost a corpse - we saw him heading this way
got a couple of fresh ones in the back
Help yourself
The  pulls the sheet off  #1 - aka
'll be
It's him all right
Still dead
The   sits up abruptly
His sheet falls away, revealing the real
now back in his own body
The  and his  run away from the ambulance
-   - barks like a maniac
turns and sees an ambling toward her
, alive and kicking
She can't believe it's him until he grabs her and pulls her close
Is it you
Is it really you this time
He pulls her close and kisses her long and hard, quelling all doubts
Oh, Stu
Tell me 'm not dreaming
Baby
you're asking the wrong guy
They wander off, arm in arm
at the seat of his pants
What's the matter
My tail itches
He    as he realizes what he's just said - but  smiles, and he shrugs it off
