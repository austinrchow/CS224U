If there is ever a cook on duty, he's not here now
As we pan across several empty tables, we can almost smell the odor of last nights beer and crushed pretzels on the floor
Oh my God,  got the most fucked up thing  been meanin' to tell you
As the camera rises, we find    seated around a table near the back of the bar
Oh Jesus
Here we go
The guy holding court is  , 20, and the largest of the bunch
He is loud, boisterous, a born entertainer
Next to him is  , 20, handsome and confident, a softspoken leader
On Will's right sits  , 22, heavy, quiet, someone you definitely wouldn't want to tangle with
Finally there is  ', 19, smaller than the other guys
Wiry and anxious, Morgan listens to Chuckie's horror stories with eager disgust
All four boys speak with thick Boston accents
This is a rough, working class Irish neighborhood and these boys are its product
You guys know my cousin Mikey Sullivan
Yeah
Well you know how he loves animals right
Anyway, last week he's drivin' home
(laughs) What
Come on
(trying not to laugh) 'm sorry, 'cause you know Mikey, the fuckin guy loves animals, and this is the last person you'd want this to happen to
Chuckie, what the fuck happened
Okay
He's driving along and this fuckin' cat jumps in front of his car, and so he hits this cat-- Chuckie is really laughing now
--That isn't funny-- --and he's like "shit
Motherfucker
" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat -- 'm sorry-- Fuckin' Chuckie
So he sees this cat tryin to make it across the street and it's not lookin' so good
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point
You guys are fuckin' sick
So Mikey's like "Fuck,  gotta put this thing out of its misery"--So he gets a hammer-- // out of his tool box, and starts chasin' the cat and starts whackin' it with the hammer
You know, tryin' to put the thing out of its misery
Jesus
And all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' "'m sorry
" , "'m sorry
"
Like it can understand
And this Samoan guy comes runnin' out of his house and he's like "What the fuck are you doing to my cat
" Mikey's like "'m sorry" ----" hit your cat with my truck, and 'm just trying to put it out of it's misery" --
And the cat dies
So Mikey's like "Why don't you come look at the front of the truck
" 'Cause the other guy's all fuckin flipped out about-- Watching his cat get brained
Morgan gives Will a look, but Will only smiles
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck,  can prove  hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"-- --or a tail-- And so they go around to the front of his truck
and there's another cat on the grille
// No
Ugh
Is that unbelievable
He brained an innocent cat
: The opening credits roll over a series of shots of the city and the real people who live and work there, going about their daily lives
We see a panoramic view of South Boston
Will sits in his apartment, walls completely bare
bed, a small night table and an empty basket adorn the room
stack of twenty or so   sit by his bed
He is flipping through a book at about a page a second
Chuckie stands on the porch to Will's house
His Cadillac idles by the curb
Will comes out and they get in the car
We travel across crowded public housing and onto downtown
Finally, we gaze across the river and onto the great cementdomed buildings that make up the
campus
: -- The classroom is packed with graduate students and
(52) is at the lectern
The chalkboard behind him is covered with theorems
Please finish McKinley by next month
Many of you probably had this as undergraduates in real analysis
It won't hurt to brush up
am also putting an advanced fourier system on the main hallway chalkboard-- Everyone groans
'm hoping that one of you might prove it by the end of the semester
The first person to do so will not only be in my good graces, but go on to fame and fortune by having their accomplishment recorded and their name printed in the auspicious "
Tech
" Prof
Lambeau holds up a thin publication entitled "
Tech
" Everyone laughs
Former winners include Nobel Laureates, world renowned astro- physicists, Field's Medal winners and lowly
professors
More laughs
Okay
That is all
smattering of applause
Students pack their bags
: The place is a monster indoor funpark
Will, Chuckie, Morgan, and Billy are in adjoining batting cages
Will has disabled the pitching machine in his and pitches to Chuckie
The boys have been drinking
Will throws one to Chuckie, high and tight
Several empty beer cans sit by the cage
Will
Another pitch, inside
You're gonna get charged
You think 'm afraid of you, you big fuck
You're crowdin' the plate
Will guns another one, way inside
Stop brushin' me back
Stop crowdin the plate
Chuckie laughs and steps back
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard
We should go there sometime
What are we gonna do up there
don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids
(stepping back in) You'd prob'ly fit right in
Fuck you
Will fires a pitch at Chuckie's head
Chuckie dives to avoid being hit
He gets up and whips his batting helmet at Will
: -- McGUIRE (52) sits,  , on the roof of his apartment building in a beat-up lawn chair
Well-built and fairly muscular, he stares blankly out over the city
On his lap rests an open invitation that reads " '67
" While the morning is quiet and Sean sits serenely, there is a look about his that tells us he has faced hard times
This is a man who fought his way through life
On his lonely stare we: : -- thirty year   has taken over the lawn
well dressed throng mill about underneath a large banner that reads "    '72
" We find Professor Lambeau standing with a drink in his hand, surveying the crowd
He is interrupted by an approaching
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau
Yes
'm in your applied theories class
We're all down at the Math and Science building
It's Saturday
know
We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out
Find out what
Who proved the theorem
,
-- In the bleachers of the visiting section we find our boys, drinking and smoking cigarettes
Will pops open a beer
The boys have been here a while and it shows
Billy sees something that catches his interest
Who's that
She's got a nice ass
Their
reveals a girl in stretch pants talking to a beefy looking   ( ) Yah, that is a nice ass
You could put a pool in that backyard
Who's she talking to
That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him
Yah, Bobby Champa
He used to beat the shit outta' me in Kindergarten
He's a pretty big kid
Yah, he's the same size now as he was in Kindergarten
Fuck this, let's get something to eat
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her
Fuck her
The boys get up and walk down the bleachers
could go for a Whopper
(nonchalant) Let's hit "Kelly's
" Morgan, 'm not goin' to "Kelly's Roast Beef" just cause you like the take-out girl
It's fifteen minutes out of our way
What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes
All right Morgan, fine
'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's
" It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot
'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once
She's not stupid
She's sharp as a marble
We're not goin'
(beat) don't even like "Kelly's
" : -- Lambeau, still in his reunion formal-wear, strides down the hallway, carrying some papers
group of students have gathered by the chalkboard
They part like the red sea as he approaches the board
Using the papers in hand, he checks the proof
Satisfied, he turns to the class
This is correct
Who did this
Dead silence
Lambeau turns to an
Nemesh
Nemesh shakes his head in awe
No way
Lambeau erases the proof and starts putting up a new one
Well, whoever You are, 'm sure you'll find this one challenging enough to merit coming forward with your identity
That is, if you can do it
' ,     -- The street is crowded as our boys drive down Broadway
They move slowly through heavy traffic, windows down
Chuckie sorts through a large "'  "  as he drives
Double Burger
Will holds the wheel for Chuckie as he looks through the bag
(same tone) Double Burger
Chuckie gets out fries for himself, hands Will his fries
,  had a Kelly's Double Burger
Would you shut the fuck up
know what you ordered,  was there
So why don't you give me my sandwich
What do you mean "your sandwich
" bought it
(sarcastic) Yah, all right
How much money you got
told you,  just got change
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwich on layaway
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie
think you should establish a good line of credit
Laughter, Chuckie goes back searching through the bag
Oh motherfucker
She didn't do it again did she
Jesus Christ
Not even close
Did she get my Double Burger
'
'  ' '
Chuckie whips a   back to Morgan, then to Billy
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish
No, and we got four of 'em
You gotta' be kiddin' me
Why do we even go to her
Cause fuckin' Morgan's got a crush on her, we always go there and when we get to the window he never says a fuckin' word to her, he never even gets out of the car, and she never gets our order right cause she's the goddamn
Well, she out did herself today
don't got a crush on her
Push in on Will who sees something
Will's
reveals   and his friends walking down the street
One of them casually lobs a bottle into a wire garbage can
It  and some of the glass hits a who, although unhurt, is upset
What do we got
don't know yet
Will's
: The woman says something to Bobby
He says something back
By the look on her face, it was something unpleasant
Come on, Will
Shut up
No, why didn't you fight him at the park if you wanted to
'm not goin' now, 'm eatin' my snack
(smiles) So don't go
Will is out of the door, jogging toward Bobby Champa
Billy gets out, following Will with a look of casual indifference
Morgan, Let's go
'm serious Chuckie,  ain't goin'
Leaving the car, Chuckie opens his door to follow
(spins in his seat) You're goin'
And if you're not out there in two fuckin' seconds, when 'm done with them you're next
And with that, Chuckie is out the door
: -- Will comes jogging up towards  , calling out from across the street, (smiling, good naturedly) Hey, Bobby Champa
went to Kindergarten with you right
Sister Margaret's class
Bobby is bewildered by this strange interruption and unsure of Will's intentions
Just when it looks as though Bobby might remember him, Will   with a sucker-punch which begins the : 40
' "'
" Will's momentum and respectable strength serve to knock the hapless Champa out cold
As soon as Will hits Bobby, his friends
Billy   and wrestles one guy to the ground
The two exchange messy punches on the sidewalk
Will is in trouble, back pedaling, dodging punches, trying to avoid being overrun
When Will goes for one guy, another has an open shot and he with a right hand to the head
Will is staggered and bleary, as a second guy winds up for a shot he is   by Chuckie who hits the kid like he was a tackling sled, lifting him off the ground
Chuckie turns to see Will still outnumbered
It's all Will can do to stay standing as Morgan   one of Champa's boys from the hood of a car
Contrary to what we might think, Morgan is actually quite a fighter
He peppers the kid with a flurry of blows
The fight is messy, ugly and chaotic
Most punches are thrown wildly and miss, heads are banged against concrete, someone throws a bottle
In the end, it's our guys who are left standing, while Bobby's friends stagger off
Chuckie and Morgan turn to see Will, standing over the unconscious Bobby Champa, still him
: , , , Whatever demons must be raging inside Will, he is taking them out on Bobby Champa
He pummels the helpless, unconscious Champa, fury in his eyes
Chuckie and Billy pull Will away
The  finally arrive on the scene and having only witnessed Will's vicious attack on Champa, they grab him
( ) -- crowd of onlookers have gathered
Chuckie addresses them
Hey, thanks for comin' out
Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwich
The Police slam Will into the hood of a car
(to Police) Hey,  know it's not a French cruller, but it's free
The cop holding Will  his [Will's] face into the hood, another cop uses a baton to press Will's face into the car
The look of rage returns to Will's eye
Get the fuck off me
Will resists
Another cop comes over
Will , dropping the cop
Momentarily freed, Will engages in a fracas with three cops
More converge on Will, who -- though he struggles -- takes a beating
: '  -- Sean sits, exactly as we first saw him, except his tie is now loose and an empty bottle of  is at his side
He stares out over the City
comes out of a doorway on the roof
Sean
Sean doesn't answer
Sean
You okay
Yeah
beat
It's getting cold
After a moment, she retreats back down the stairs
Sean doesn't move
: ,   -- The morning sun reflects brilliantly off the river
: -- Will emerges from the courthouse
Chuckie is waiting for him in the Cadillac with two cups of '  coffee
He hands one of them to Will
This feels routine
When's the arraignment
Next week
Chuckie pulls away
: ,   -- Students walk to class, carrying bags
More than any other, students seem to be heading into one
-- The classroom is even more crowded than last we saw it
Tom takes notes as Lambeau plays along with the excited environment with mock pomposity and good humor
Is it my imagination, or has my class grown considerably
Laughter
look around and see young people who are my students, young people who are not my students as well as some of my colleagues
And by no stretch of my imagination do  think you've all come to hear me lecture
More laughter
But rather to ascertain the identity of who our esteemed "The Tech" has come to call "The Mystery Math Magician
" He holds up the
Tech featuring a silhouetted figure, emblazoned with a large, white question mark
The headline reads "Mystery Math Magician strikes again
" Whoever you are, you've solved four of the most difficult theorems 've ever given a class
So without further ado, come forward silent rogue, and receive thy prize
The class waits in breathless anticipation
shifts his weight in his chair, making a noise
Well, 'm sorry to disappoint my spectators, but it appears there will be no unmasking here today
'm going to have to ask those of you not enrolled in the class to make your escape now or, for the next three hours be subjected to the mundities of eigenvectors
People start to gather their things and go
Lambeau picks up a piece of chalk and starts writing on the board
However, my colleagues and  have conferred
There is a problem on the board, right now, that took us two years to prove
So let this be said; the gauntlet has been thrown down
But the faculty have answered the challenge and answered with vigor
: -- Lambeau comes out of his office with Tom and locks the door
As he turns to walk down the hallway, he stops
faint can be heard
He turns and walks down the hall
Lambeau and Tom come around a corner
His
reveals a figure in silhouette blazing through the proof on the chalkboard
There is a mop and a bucket beside him
As Lambeau draws closer, reveal that the figure is Will, in his janitor's uniform
There is a look of intense concentration in his eyes
Excuse me
Will looks up, immediately starts to shuffle off
Oh, 'm sorry
What're you doing
(walking away) 'm sorry
Lambeau follows Will down the hall
What's your name
(beat) Don't you walk away from me
This is people's work, you can't graffiti here
Hey fuck you
(flustered) Well
'll be speaking to your supervisor
Will walks out
Lambeau goes to "fix" the proof, scanning the blackboard for whatever damage Will caused
He stops, scans the board again
Amazement registers on his face
My God
Down the hall, we hear the
He turns to look for Will, who is gone
: ,  -- crowded Harvard Bar
Will and our gang walk by a line of several Harvard students, waiting to be carded
What happened
(beat) You got fired, huh
Yeah, Morgan
got fired
(starts laughing) How fuckin' retarded do you have to be to get shit-canned from that job
How hard is it to push a fuckin' broom
You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch
Yah, that was different
Management was restructurin'-- Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them
Fuck you, you fat fuck
Least  work for a livin'
(to Will) Why'd you get fired
Management was restructurin'
Laughter
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team
What the fuck
just asked you for a job yesterday
told you "no" yesterday
After two students flash their 's to the doorman () our boys file past him
(one after another) What's up Case
With an imperceptible nod, Casey waves our boys through fifth kid, a  , tries to follow
He is stopped by Casey's massive, outstretched arm: -- Chuckie is collecting money from the guys to buy a pitcher, all but Morgan cough up some crumpled dollars
So, this is a Harvard bar, huh thought there'd be equations and shit on the wall
,    -- Chuckie returns to a table where Will, Morgan and Billy have made themselves comfortable
He [Chuckie] spots two sitting together at the end of the bar
Chuckie struts his way toward the women and pulls up a chair
He flashes a smile and tries to submerge his thick Boston accent
Hey, how's it goin'
Fine
Okay
So, you ladies ah, go to school here
Yes
Yeah, cause  think  had a class with you
At this point, several interested parties materialize
Morgan Billy and Will try, as inconspicuously as possible, to situate themselves within listening distance
rather large student in a   sweatshirt,  (22) notices Chuckie
He [Clark] walks over to Skylar and Lydia, nobly hovering over them as protector
This gets Will, Morgan, and Billy's attention
What class
Ah, history  think
Oh
Yah, it's not a bad school
At this point, Clark can't resist and steps in
What class did you say that was
History
How'd you like that course
Good, it was all right
History
Just "history
" It must have been a survey course then
Chuckie nods
Clark notices Chuckie's clothes
Will and Billy exchange a look and move subtly closer
Pretty broad
"History of the World
" Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day
That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time
Hey, 'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar
But as long as you're here  want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question
Billy shifts his beer into his left hand
Will and Morgan see this
Morgan rolls his eyes as if to say "not again
" Oh, 'm sure you covered it in your history class
Clark looks to see if the girls are impressed
They are not
When Clark looks back to Chuckie, Skylar turns to Lydia and rolls her [own] eyes
They laugh
Will sees this and smiles
To tell you the truth,  wasn't there much
The class was rather elementary
Elementary
Oh,  don't doubt that it was
remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch
Will and Billy come forward, stand behind Chuckie
All right, are we gonna have a problem
There's no problem
was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies
My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian precapitalist and
Will, who at this point has migrated to Chuckie's side and is completely fed-up, includes himself in the conversation
Of course that's your contention
You're a first year grad student
You just finished some Marxian historian, Pete Garrison prob'ly, and so naturally that's what you believe until next month when you get to James Lemon and get convinced that Virginia and Pennsylvania were strongly entrepreneurial and capitalist back in 1740
That'll last until sometime in your second year, then you'll be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood about the Pre-revolutionary utopia and the capital-forming effects of military mobilization
(taken aback) Well, as a matter of fact,  won't, because Wood drastically underestimates the impact of-- "Wood drastically underestimates the impact of social distinctions predicated upon wealth, especially inherited wealth
" You got that from "Work in Essex County," Page 421, right
Do you have any thoughts of your own on the subject or were you just gonna plagiarize the whole book for me
Clark is stunned
Look, don't try to pass yourself off as some kind of an intellect at the expense of my friend just to impress these girls
Clark is lost now, searching for a graceful exit, any exit
The sad thing is, in about 50 years you might start doin' some thinkin' on your own and by then you'll realize there are only two certainties in life
Yeah
What're those
One, don't do that
Two -- you dropped a hundred and fifty grand on an education you coulda' picked up for a dollar fifty in late charges at the Public Library
Will catches Skylar's eye
But  will have a degree, and you'll be serving my kids fries at a drive through on our way to a skiing trip
(smiles) Maybe
But at least  won't be a prick
(beat) And if you got a problem with that, guess we can step outside and deal with it that way
While Will is substantially smaller than Clark, he [Clark] decides not to take Will up on his [Will's] offer
If you change your mind, 'll be over by the bar
He turns and walks away
Chuckie follows, throwing Clark a look
Morgan turns to a nearby girl
My boy's wicked smart
,    -- Will sits with Morgan at the bar watching with some amusement as Chuckie and Billy play bar basketball game where the players shoot miniature balls at a small basket
In the
occasionally we hear Chuckie shouting "Larry
" When he scores
Skylar emerges from the crowd and approaches Will
You suck
What
've been sitting over there for forty-five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me
But 'm just tired now and  have to go home and wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you
'm Will
Skylar
And by the way
That guy over there is a real dick and  just wanted you to know he didn't come with us
kind of got that impression
Well, look,  have to go
Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education
didn't mean you
Listen, maybe
Here's my number
Skylar produces a folded piece of paper and offers it to Will
Maybe we could go out for coffee sometime
Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels
What
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee
(laughs) Okay, sounds good
She turns
Five minutes
What
was trying to be smooth
(indicates clock) But at twelve-fifteen  was gonna come over there and talk to you
See, it's my life story
Five more minutes and  would have got to hear your best pick-up line
The caramel thing is my pick-up line
beat
Glad  came over
: -- Our boys are walking out of the bar teasing one another about their bar-ball exploits
Across the street is another bar with a glass front
Morgan spots Clark sitting by the window with some friends
There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip
" We should'a kicked that dude's ass
Hold up
Will crosses the street and approaches the plate glass window and stands across from Clark, separated only by the glass
He    to get Clark's attention
Hey
Clark turns toward Will
Clark doesn't get it
Yeah
Will  '   against the glass
Will's boys erupt into laughter
Angle on Clark, deflated
-- The boys make their way home, piled into Chuckie's car, laughing together
-- Shot of car crossing over the Charles St
Bridge, overtaking a red-line train
-- Traveling through narrow back roads in Charlestown, passing the Bunker Hill monument
'  -- Arriving at Will's house and dropping him off
: -- Lambeau walks into a small garage facility
The area stores lawn machinery and various tools
An older man,  (58) sits behind the desk reading the   sports page
Lambeau has obviously never been here before
He takes in the surroundings, somewhat uncomfortable
Gets dirty
Excuse me
Is this the buildings and grounds office
Yeah, can  help you
'm trying to find the name of a student who works here
No students work for me
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building-- Which one's your building
Building two
Terry checks a list behind his [own] desk
Looks up
Well, if something was stolen, should know about it
No, no
Nothing like that
just need his name
can't give you his name unless you have a complaint
Please, 'm a professor here and it's very important
Well, he didn't show up for work today
Terry takes a beat
Holding all the cards
Look, he got his job through his so you can call him
Terry goes through a stack of paper on his desk
Takes out a card and hands it to Lambeau
Lambeau looks blankly at the card which reads: "
" -- Will stands before   (40) being arraigned
It is fairly unceremonious, the courtroom nearly empty, save Will and the
Lambeau walks in from the back
There is a lengthy legal precedent, Your Honor, going back to 1789, whereby a defendant may claim self- defense against an agent of the government where the act is shown to be a defense against tyranny, a defense of liberty-- The Judge interrupts to address the prosecutor
Mr
Simmons, Officer McNeely who signed the complaint isn't in my courtroom
Why is that
He's in the hospital with a broken knee, Your Honor
But  have depositions from the other officers
Henry Ward Beecher proclaimed, in his Proverbs From Plymouth Pulpit back in 1887, that "Every American citizen is by birth, a sworn officer of the state
Every man is a policeman
" As for the other officers, even William Congrave said; "he that first cries out 'stop thief' is 'oft he that has stolen the treasure
" Your Honor-- Will cranks it up
(to Prosecutor) am afforded the right to speak in my own defense by our constitution, Sir
The same document which guarantees my right to liberty
"Liberty," in case you've forgotten, is "the soul's right to breathe, and when it cannot take a long breath laws are girded too tight
Without liberty, man is a syncope
" (beat, to Judge) Ibid
Your Honor
Man is a what
Julius Caesar proclaimed -- Though he be wounded-- "Magna
" The Judge interrupts
Son, (a beat) My turn
The Judge opens Will's
(reading) June, '93, assault, Sept
'93 assault
Grand theft auto February '94
beat, the Judge takes particular notice
Where, apparently, you defended yourself and had the case thrown out by citing "free property rights of horse and carriage" from 1798
Lambeau has to smile, impressed
The Judge shakes his head
March, '94 public drunkenness, public nudity, assault
10/94 mayhem
November '94, assault
Jan
'95 impersonating a police officer, mayhem, theft, resisting -- overturned-- The Judge takes a beat
Gives Will a look
You're in my courtroom, now and  am aware of your priors
(beat) 'm also aware that you're an orphan
You've been through several foster homes
The state removed you from three because of serious physical abuse
The Judge holds a look to Will, who looks down
Another Judge might care
You hit a cop, you go in
(beat) Motion to dismiss denied
The Bailiff goes to remove Will from the courtroom
Keep workin' on your arguments, son
word of advice for trial; speak English
As Will is removed from the courtroom, Lambeau approaches Judge Malone who is stepping down from the bench
Excuse me, your Honor
(offers hand) Gerald Lambeau
An awkward beat
Lambeau waits for some sign of recognition
'm a professor at
(beat) Combunatorial Mathematics
The Judge offers only a blank look
Oh
Pleased to meet you
Do you have a minute
: ,   -- walks Will down a hallway toward a group of phones
One call, to an attorney
(beat) One
The Guard gives Will a hard look for a beat
Then leaves
How many
Will picks up the phone, dials
Hey, Skylar
'  -- Yeah
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar
'm sorry,  don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description
Okay, you got me
It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night
Oh Will
was wondering when you'd call
Yeah,  figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels
Sounds good, where are you now
You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law
Are you
: ,   -- Professor Lambeau sits, waiting
Will is brought in, shackled, by the guard
Hello
Gerald Lambeau,
Fuck do you want
've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision
(suspicious) Really
(beat) Yes
Under two conditions
What're those
That you meet with me twice a week (a beat) and you meet with a therapist
If  agree to this,  walk right now
That's right
'll do the work
'm not going to meet with a therapist
Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will
(beat) 've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine
He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field
(beat) 'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail
: -- Will and Chuckie walk up to an enclosed trampoline
Billy and Morgan prefer to use it for their own version of "Wrestlemania
" As Will and Chuckie approach, Billy is on top of a bloodied Morgan and has him in the "Cobra Clutch
"  Will and Chuckie watch for a beat
Billy tightens his grip
Submit, bitch
Submit
Submit
(being strangled) Suck my cock
Oh, Morgan
Chuckie turns to Will, conspiratorially as they wait for the fight to finish
What'd you get
You get leniency
Probation, counselin', few days a week
You're fuckin' good
Will smiles
Just submit, Morgan
He's got you in the Cobra Clutch
(to Chuckie) Fuck your mother too
'  -- Will sits alone in his one room apartment, reading
closer look reveals he is reading a self-help
Will is flipping through the book at about a page per second
He shakes his head and smiles
Upon finishing the book, he throws it in a nearby
Push in on the back of the book where a   is pictured
'  -- Will sits in a well decorated Psychologist's Office
Across from Will sits the same ,   (40), from the book
They are in mid-session
That's why  love stock-car racin'
That Dale Ernhart's real good
Now you know Will, and  know, what you need to be doing
You have a gift
could work the pit maybe, but could never drive like Dale Ernhart-- You have a quality -- something you were born with, that you have no control over -- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor
And 'm not saying that's wrong
'm friends with the janitor that works in my building
He's been to my house for dinner
As a matter of fact  did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name
That's in my book
Yeah,  read your book
"Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker
Yes
The pressures you feel, and again,  am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut
So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will
You're right
know
Will, your not getting off that easy
No, but,  mean you know
do other things
That no one knows about
Like what, Will
go places,  interact
What places
Certain, clubs
(beat) Like, Paradise
It's not bad
Will gives the Psychologist a furtive look
It's just that feeling when you can take your shirt off and really dance
(beat) When the music owns you
Do you understand
might understand that
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay
What
'mon,  read your book
talked to you
It's just something  know to be true
That's very presumptuous
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump
(a little laugh) Well, 'm sorry to disappoint you, but 'm married and  have two children
'm sure you do
You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller
You're getting defensive, Will
Look, man
don't care if you're putting from the rough
There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caesar, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that
Who is "Danny Terrio
" If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot
Take some pride in it
You go to church
So fuckin' what, God loves you
mean, Christ
guy as well known as you
By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Clouseau
" The Psychologist calmly packs his things
Well,  can see this is pointless
You're getting defensive
Henry
And hey, chief -- tell the wife, at least
Christ, set her free
The shrink gets up and walks out
Fuckin' hypocrite
-- The Psychologist comes walking out, much to the surprise of Lambeau and Tom who have been waiting in the lobby
Henry
The Psychologist keeps walking
No
You know what, Gerry
This is why  don't do pro-bono anymore
It's not worth it to me
What happened
don't have the time
'm going on national television this week
Wait a minute, Henry
He [Henry] is out the door
Lambeau looks to Tom
: '  -- Will is in Lambeau's office
Lambeau is at the board, working on a diagram as Tom takes notes
Will seems disinterested
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles
One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer
Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer
Of course
Okay
How
It's an integer proof
Lambeau smiles
What
Hey, look buddy my time's almost up
You want me to sit here for an hour and write it out
Lambeau says nothing
Will gets up and goes to the board
Look, 'll give you the key steps to it but 'm not gonna do the whole thing
Lambeau keeps smiling
That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will
think so
happen to know so
Lambeau rises and goes to the board
You're thinking too hard
What if did this
He draws a vertical line through the diagram
Now, what if  do this
He draws a horizontal line through the diagram
He hands Will the chalk
Have you ever played checkers
Will realizes what Lambeau is getting at
In a flash he starts drawing lines through the diagram, energized
You color-code it
Half-red, half- black
If that's an integer-- Lambeau steps in, writing with him [Will]
What's that
Half-red, half-black-- --that
-- --Half-red, half-black-- --That edge
An integer
The two stop
They are silent for a moment
Like two gunfighters after a duel, they put down the chalk
(checks his watch) It would appear we got that proof in under the wire after all
It's not how hard you look at things, young man, it's the way you look at them
If you take aim before you fire, you will find the most difficult problems become, quite literally, child's play
Will gets his coat
Will, you've managed to offend four of my colleagues so much that they refused to come back
You're meeting with the leading hypnotist in the country next week and Tom and  plan to sit in on the sessions, so  expect you to behave appropriately
: '  -- Will sits in a chair across from Lambeau and the
Lambeau's assistant,  (33) takes notes
The Hypnotist makes small talk with Lambeau, who checks his watch
Shall we start the, uh
Yeah, when do  get my hypnosis
You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes
Yes, Will
We'll get to that
But first, why don't you go to sleep for me
He    and instantly Will's head goes  and his
The Hypnotist gives Lambeau a look
Would you mind standing on one leg
Will gets up and stands on one leg
Lambeau is impressed
: '  -- Will is reclining, eyes closed, in a trance-like state
The mood is more serious now
Okay, you're in your bed, Will
Now how old are you
Seven
And what do you see
Somethin's in my room
What is it
It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me
Gettin' closer
Will flinches
You're in a safe place, Will
It's touching me
Lambeau makes a sound
The Hypnotist shushes him [Lambeau] with his [Hypnotist's] finger
Tom returns to his note-taking
Where is it touching you
Down there
(indicating genitals) And 'm nervous
You don't have to be nervous, Will
Lambeau and the Therapist trade looks
This is working
'Cause 'm not ready
(calming) But the figure tells me everything's gonna be all right
'Cause the figure's a Libra too
And we start dancin' and it's beautiful-- Will breaks into song at full volume
"
" (getting up) Oh Jesus
The Hypnotist gets up and starts heading towards the door
Will is still singing from "Sky Rockets
" Wait a minute, Barry
have better ways to spend my time
He is gone
Will stops singing, laughs
Oh, for God's sake, Will
Oh, come on
You're not pinnin' this one on me
He left,  wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes was havin' fun
told you to cooperate with these people
'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work
Will gets up and adopts a hypnotic persona in front of Lambeau
(spooky voice) Look into my eyes
don't need therapy
Get out, Will
Okay
don't forget to get another therapist for next week
That's enough
Will is out the door
Lambeau turns to Tom
called Mel Weintraub this morning, to check for availability
What's the point
What do you want to do
There is somebody
Who is he
He was my roommate in college
-- This is  ' "Dying and Bereavement" class
Emblazoned on the door is "room 101
" While the lecture hall could hold sixty students, there are less than fifteen here today
Sean Maguire lectures to the class in a resigned tone
Tired of teaching, tired of life, he finds himself resigned to the tedium of teaching core classes to an indifferent student body
Establishing trust is the most important component in making breakthroughs with a patient
Why
beat
Maureen
' only response is an empty stare
Keep up the good work, Maureen
Vinnie
looks up
Because trust is an important thing
Don't bullshit me, Vinnie
Didn't your brother give you the notes
Okay
If a patient doesn't trust you then they won't feel safe enough to be honest with you -- then there's no point to them being in therapy
It's like saying -- "Fine, come here and don't tell me a thing but go home feeling like you're doing something about your problems -- and give me my fifty bucks before you leave will ya'
" He looks around the room for approval
No one is listening
If you don't help them trust you -- then there's no way you'll ever get them to sleep with you
And that should be the goal of any good therapist
Insecure women, you know
nail 'em when they're vulnerable, that's always been my motto
The students look up, somewhat stunned
See,  got Vinnie's attention
Laughter
Sean starts to resume his lecture, when he notices standing in the back of the room
There is an awkward moment
Gerry
Sean
(to class) Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness
Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner
Combunatorial Mathematics
1986
The students stare blankly
Hello
The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math
(beat) But it's only given out every four years
beat
Okay, that's all for today
Try and get through Fernald by Monday
The class starts to pack up and file out
Lambeau approaches Sean who steps down from the lectern
Good to see you
Good to see you
Is there someplace we can talk
: -- Will and Skylar on their first date
They watch a street doing tricks with a rabbit
The guy's tricks are pretty good, but his on-stage persona could use some work
He is incessantly repeating the phrase "this is the rabbit, the rabbit really does the tricks
" Will gives Skylar a look and they move on
: -- Will and Skylar walk into the small shop
don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing
Private school, Harvard, and now Med
School
(Beat) actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars shouldn't have told you that
bet your parents were happy to pay
was happy to pay
inherited the money
Is Harvard gettin' all that money
Stanford
'm leaving in June after graduate
So you just want to use me and go
Well, 'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go
In that case, fine
(beat) Want to see my magic trick
Sure
Will, pulls out a bulging
Now, 'm gonna make all these caramels disappear
Okay
Will goes into all manner of hocus-pocus theatrics
Then shakes his hand wildly
The trick doesn't pan out and the caramels go flying all over the store
Skylar laughs
It works better when  have my rabbit
: -- Lambeau and Sean share a table at this exclusive restaurant
Sean seems slightly out of place in his wrinkled sport coat
didn't see you at the reunion
've been busy
You were missed
(beat) How long has it been since we've seen each other
Since Nancy died
'm sorry, that damn conference-- got your card
: " " -- hands Will and Skylar a pair of
Have you ever seen Annie Hall
No
Well, there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss' thing
Will smiles
really don't 'date' that much
(laughs) You know what  mean
know you've at least thought about it
No  haven't
Yes you have
You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss
(mock protest) No  wasn't
Yes you were
was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but
'll take a kiss
She laughs
Oh, you will
No
was hoping to get a kiss
Then why don't we just get it out of the way
He looks at her
Now
Both of them have cheeseburger in their mouths
Yeah
They kiss, mouths full of burger
It's nice
beat
That had to be the worst good night kiss
Will laughs
Hey, look lady, 'm just here for the free food
She smiles
Free
Hey,  spent all my money on those caramels
She laughs
: -- Lambeau and Sean, having finished their meal
Lambeau has been pitching Sean
've been busy, Gerry
got a full schedule
This kid's special, Sean
've never seen anything like him
Not much free time, Gerry
Have you ever heard of a man named Ramanujan
Sean nods his head
Yeah
He was alive over a hundred years ago
He was Indian
Dots, not feathers
Sean finishes the joke
Lambeau chuckles
So this Ramanujan lived in a tiny hut in India
No formal education, no access to other works
But he came across an old math book and from this basic text he was able to extrapolate theories that had baffled mathematicians for years
And he mailed it to Hardy-- That's right, Sean
He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age-- They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done
Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean
This boy is like that
But he's very defensive and need someone who can get through to him
Why me
need someone with your kind of background
My kind of background
You're from the same neighborhood
South Boston
He's from Southie
How many people did you try before you came to me
(looks squarely at Sean) Five
Sean gives a slight, knowing smile
Who
Barry, Henry, Rick
Lambeau nods
Not Rick
You didn't send him to Rick
Just meet with the boy once a week
Can we do it at my office
That would be fine
The waiter comes with the
Each man reaches for it
Sean, please
got it
It's on the college
Sean relents
: -- Establishing shot of the red-brick campus
Planes land at nearby Logan airport
Will walks up the steps
: '  -- Sean's office is comfortable
Books are stacked against the wall
There is a  on the wall behind Sean
Sean is seated behind a desk
Lambeau sits in a chair in the back of the room, next to Tom
long beat passes, they wait
Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit
'll be okay
It's a poker game with this young man
Don't let him see what you've got
Sean nods
Will walks in
Everyone stands to greet Will
Hello, Will
Any trouble finding the place
No
Will, this is Sean Maguire
Sean, Will Hunting
Sean and Will nod
An awkward moment as the four men stand
Well, let's get started
Yeah, let's let the healing begin
Lambeau is slightly embarrassed
Sean smiles at Will's joke
Would you excuse us
Tom
You too, Gerry
Lambeau looks at Sean, surprised
Sean's stare is unwavering
After an awkward moment, Lambeau goes, leaving Sean and Will alone
Will doesn't look at Sean for more than a second
He seems more interested in the room
There is a long silence as Sean watches Will
Hello, Will
'm Sean Maguire
smile crosses Will's face as he walks to his chair and sits
He lights a cigarette
Sean continues to watch him
Finally- Where are you from in Southie
Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included
Have you read all these books, Will
Probably not
(indicating a shelf) How about the ones on that shelf
Will's eyes flicker up to the shelf for an instant
Yeah,  read those
What did you think
'm not here for a fuckin' book report
They're your books, why don't you read 'em
did
That must have taken you a long time
Yeah, it did take me a long time
Sean says this with pride
His determined stare and confident manner catch Will a bit off guard
Will rises from his chair and goes to the shelf
(looking at book) " History of the United States, Volume
" If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's " People's History of the United States
" That book will knock you on your ass
How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent
" You people baffle me
You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books
You think so
Whatever blows your hair back
Will returns to his chair
Pause
(indicating cigarette) Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much
Stunt your growth
You're right
It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing
Sean does not seem at all affected by Will's attitude
He remains behind the big desk with almost half a smile on his face
Will is aware of Sean's confidence
Do you lift
Yes,  do
Nautilus
Free weights
Oh yeah
Me too
What do you bench
285
Oh
Will gets up again and moves around his chair to Sean's painting
It is a picture of an old sailboat in a tremendous storm -- by no means a masterpiece
Will studies it
You paint this
Yeah
Do you paint
No
Crayons
This is a real piece of shit
Tell me what you really think
Poor color composition, lousy use of space
But that shit doesn't really concern me
What does
The color here, see how dark it is
It's interesting
What is
think you're one step away from cutting your ear off
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm
" Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"- --Well, maybe that means you
Maybe what mea-- Maybe you were in the middle of a storm, a big fuckin' storm -- the waves were crashing over the bow, the Goddamned mast was about to snap, and you were crying for the harbor
So you did what you had to do, to get out
Maybe you became a psychologist
Maybe you should be a patient and sit down
Maybe you married the wrong woman
Watch your mouth
That's it isn't it
You married the wrong woman
She leave you
Was she bangin' someone else
Sean is walking slowly towards Will
How are the seas now, -- In a flash, Sean has Will by the throat
Will is helpless
If you ever disrespect my wife again
will end you
Time's up
: -- Will walks out of Sean's office past Lambeau and Tom who are sitting in the hallway
At ease, gentlemen
: '  -- Sean stands behind his desk in his office, still very much on edge
Lambeau walks in
Five minutes, Sean
Are you okay
pause, Sean is staring at his painting
'll understand if you don't want to meet with him again
Thursday, four o'clock
Make sure the kid is here
: -- Will and Skylar sit in the stands watching the dogs run
They ad lib teasing one another about England, Ireland, and America
You grew up around here
Not far from here, South Boston
How was that
Pretty boring,  guess
She smiles
bet you have a great family
You know, nothing special
You have a lot of brothers and sisters
Do  have a lot of brothers and sisters
Yeah
Well, Irish Catholic
What do you think
How many
You wouldn't believe me if  told you
What, five
Will shakes his head
Seven
Will shakes his head
Smiles
Come on
have twelve big brothers
Not a chance
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen
Bullshit
swear to God
Your house must have been a zoo
It was great
There was always someone to play with, give you advice
Do you know all their names
'Course  do, they're my brothers
Well
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian
(laughing) Do you keep in touch with them
All the time
We all live in Southie
live with three of them now
Skylar smiles
want to meet them
We'll do that
: '  -- As we pan across Sean's small apartment, we find it strewn with dirty clothes and the sink full of dishes
Although, if it weren't for the clutter, the place would feel pretty bare
framed   cover featuring a screaming Larry Bird and entitled " " hangs on the wall
Sean sits at the table next to another nearly empty bottle of '
He is deep in thought
: '  -- Will strolls into the office
Sean is waiting there behind his desk
He seems different
More calm
Will and Sean stare at each other for a long moment
You again
How the paintin' coming
Sean stands up
Come with me
: -- Sean and Will sit in the bleachers at the mostly empty park
They look out over a small pond, in which a group of schoolchildren on a field trip ride the famous Swan Boats
So what's with this place
You have a swan fetish
Is this something you'd like to talk about
was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting
stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occurred to me and  fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since
You know what occurred to me
No
You're just a boy
You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about
Why thank you
You've never been out of Boston
No
So if  asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written
Michelangelo
You know a lot about him  bet
Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations
But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel
You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling
And if  asked you about women 'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too
But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy
If  asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one
You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help
And if  asked you about love 'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable
Known that someone could kill you with a look
That someone could rescue you from grief
That God had put an angel on Earth just for you
And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel
To have the love be there for her forever
Through anything, through cancer
You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you
And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much
look at you and  don't see an intelligent confident man,  don't see a peer, and  don't see my equal
see a boy
Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will
Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw
You must know everything about me
You're an orphan, right
Will nods quietly
Do you think  would presume to know the first thing about who you are because  read "Oliver Twist
" And don't buy the argument that you don't want to be here, because  think you like all the attention you're getting
Personally,  don't care
There's nothing you can tell me that  can't read somewhere else
Unless we talk about your life
But you won't do that
Maybe you're afraid of what you might say
Sean stands, It's up to you
And walks away
: -- Will and Chuckie doing demo at the site
They throw cinderblocks out a window into a pile
They are filthy
: -- Rain pounds South Boston
Chuckie sits with the Cadillac fiddling, humming to the radio
Morgan and Billy sit in the back, sharing a case of beer
Will is at a pay phone
'  -- Hello
Will hangs up and runs back to the car, soaked
Who'd you call
No one
didn't have the number
What are you, retarded
You went all the way out there in the rain and you didn't have the number
No, it was your mother's 900 number
just ran out of quarters
Laughter
Chuckie pulls away from the curb
Why don't we get off mothers,  just got off yours
There is a long moment of silence in response to Morgan's attempt at levity
Then laughter
You're a pretty funny guy
Here, have a nickel
Billy  his    off of Morgan's head
Keep fuckin' with me
Watch what happens
All right, then
Watch what happens
: '  -- Will sits across from Sean completely silent and takes out a pack of cigarettes
No smoking
Will puts the cigarettes away
Sean stares at Will and occasionally at the clock
Sean continues to check the clock on the wall
It is the only clock in the room and it is Will
Their hour is almost up
: '
He is counting seconds
As the second hand crosses the twelve, Will stands up and walks out, leaving Sean alone
-- Lambeau and Sean walk down the hallway after the session
What do you mean "he didn't talk
" You sat there for an hour
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over
It was pretty impressive, actually
Why would he do that
To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to
Oh, what is this
Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood
" won't talk first
'  -- Chuckie drops Will off at his apartment, watches him [Will] walk up the steps
: '  -- Chuckie pulls up to the curb and walks up the steps to Will's front door
After a beat, Will emerges
They get back in [the car]
: -- Will and Chuckie at work
Chuckie shows Will how to be a man
& ,   -- The bar is a bit more crowded than usual
Will and Chuckie walk back to their table, carrying beers
They pass a table of , local regulars getting just as bombed as the guys
These girls are a little overdone
Too much make-up, too much hairspray, and too much body for such tight outfits
One of the girls, , smiles at Will who seems subdued
Hi, Will
How you doin', Krystyn
They pass the table of girls
Chuckie looks at one, ruefully
didn't get on Cathy last night
Why not
don't know
Chuckie turns back to one of the girls, calling out: Cathy
Why didn't you give me none of your twat last night
girl at the table, , holds up her   and smiles -- revealing a mouthful of
Fuck you and your Irish curse, Chuckie
She's missin' teeth, Will
Will nods, not really into it tonight
Plus, it's like, five to two Morgan ends up marryin' her
There's only so many times you can bang your friend's future wife
They get to the table
Will's heart just isn't in it
'm takin' off
We're goin' late night
'm tired
: '  -- Will and Lambeau work together at the board
They communicate non-verbally as they collaborate on a problem
After a particularly amusing series of numbers, they share a look and laugh
: '  -- Will and Sean sit in silence
long moment passes
Sean casually reclines in his chair, disinterested
Will restlessly looks around the room and then back to Sean
An odd half smile crosses Sean's face
After a moment: You know,  was on this plane once
And 'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like "we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off
Then he says "man, all  want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee
"  So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes "don't forget the coffee
" (smiles) You've never been on a plane
know, but the joke's better if tell it in the first person
beat
have been laid you know
Sean smiles
Yeah
You got a lady now
Yeah,  went on a date last week
How'd it go
Fine
Well, are you going out again
don't know
Why not
Haven't called her
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur
know what 'm doing
She's different from the other girls  met
We have a really good time
She's smart, beautiful, fun
So Christ, call her up
Why
So  can realize she's not so smart
That she's boring
You don't get it
Right now she's perfect, don't want to ruin that
And right now you're perfect too
Maybe you don't want to ruin that
Will says nothing
Well,  think that's a great philosophy Will, that way you can go through your entire life without ever having to really know anybody
Sean looks directly at Will, who looks away
beat
My wife used to turn the alarm clock off in her sleep
was late for work all the time because in the middle of the night she'd roll over and turn the damn thing off
Eventually  got a second clock and put it under my side of the bed, but it got to where she was gettin' to that one too
She was afraid of the dark, so the closet light was on all night
Thing kept me up half the night
Eventually 'd fall asleep, out of sheer exhaustion and not wake up when  was supposed to cause she'd have already gotten to my alarms
Will smiles, Sean takes a beat
My wife's been dead two years, Will
And when  think about her, those are the things  think about most
Little idiosyncrasies that only knew about
Those made her my wife
And she had the goods on me too
Little things  do out of habit
People call these things imperfections Will
It's just who we are
And we get to choose who we're going to let into out weird little worlds
You're not perfect
And let me save you the suspense, this girl you met isn't either
The question is, whether or not you're perfect for each other
You can know everything in the world, but the only way you're findin' that one out is by giving it a shot
You sure won't get the answer from an old fucker like me
And even if did know,  wouldn't tell you
Will smiles
beat
Why not
You told me every other fuckin' thing
You talk more than any shrink  ever met
Sean laughs
teach this shit,  didn't say knew how to do it
You ever think about gettin' remarried
My wife's dead
Hence, the word remarried
My wife's dead
Well  think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean
That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone
beat
Sean smiles
Time's up
: '  -- Will is waiting outside the door for someone to come out -- so he can go in
'  -- The door to Skylar's dorm is partially open
Will stands outside while Skylar remains on the threshold
Where have you been
'm sorry,  been real busy
You were busy
You know,  really was waiting for you to call me
Sorry
'm sorry
Give me another crack at it
Let me take you out
You should have called
have an "- chem" lab due tomorrow and it's impossible
(beat) It's not an excuse dummy
want to go out with you
But look: She holds up her Lab
Will glances at it
Tomorrow
Promise
If you bring the caramels
Will smiles
: -- Will sits in an outdoor cafe, thinking
After a beat, he leans over to two students working at a nearby table, borrows a pen and paper and starts writing
: '  -- Will is a solitary figure strolling across the lawn
He stops at Skylar's dorm and knocks on the door
: '  -- She emerges
He hands her the paper he was working on
It is her -chem lab
couldn't wait till tomorrow
How the hell did you do that
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse in the mouth
'm supposed to understand this
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you
No
Then let's go have some fun
With a smile, she relents
'  -- Sean and Will in session
Really
How'd the date go
Do you still counsel veterans
(beat) read your book last night
No,  don't
Why not
gave that up when my wife got sick
Is that why you didn't write anything else
(smiles) didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one
Well, 've read you colleagues
Your book was good, Sean
(beat) All those guys were in your platoon
Yeah
What happened to that guy from Kentucky
Lon
He got married
He has a kid kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife
What
Do  wonder if 'd be better off if  never met my wife
Will starts to clarify his question
No, that's okay
It's an important question
'Cause you'll have your bad times, which wake you up to the good stuff you weren't paying attention to
And you can fail, as long as you're trying hard
But there's nothing worse than regret
You don't regret meetin' your wife
Why
Because of the pain  feel now
have regrets Will, but  don't regret a singel day  spent with her
When did you know she was the one
October 21, 1975
Game six of the World Series
Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets
We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl
What a game that was
Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line
Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair
Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman
It hits the foul pole, home run
Thirty-five thousand people went crazy
And  wasn't one of them
Where were you
was havin' a drink with my future wife
You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met
That's right
So wait a minute
The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away
You should have seen this girl
She lit up the room
don't care if Helen of Troy walked into that bar
That's game six of the World Series
Sean smiles
And what kind of friends are these
They let you get away with that
just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas,  gotta go see about a girl
" " gotta go see about a girl"
What did they say
They could see that  meant it
You're kiddin' me
No Will, 'm not kiddin' you
If had gone to see that game 'd be in here talkin' abouta girl  saw at a bar twenty years ago
And how  always regretted not goin' over there and talkin' to her
don't regret the eighteen years we were married don't regret givin' up counseling for six years when she got sick don't regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad
And  sure as Hell don't regret missing that damn game
beat
Will is impressed
Would have been nice to catch that game though
(breaking) Well hell,  didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run
They laugh
: '  -- The office is more crowded than usual
and  of '  including the esteemed are in the room
Will sits at a work-station which projects a proof of his [Will's] onto the chalkboard
Lambeau stands beside the projected image at the board arguing with Pekec, a foreign mathematician
The image is of a Ramses graph binary tree
Alexander,  know your theory
The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree-- --But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex
He can always failsafe to either side-- Maker can
This is not new, Gerry
Pekec starts writing lines beside Will's proof on the board
But  can always garbage out (writes frantically) All the way to "" to the minus one
No, there's a limit
The limit is not found
(turns to Will) The limit is not found
But  can always go to the other side
There is no proof-- Lambeau can no longer contain himself
Maker builds "" to the "
"  is three to the  times-- --But-- Look,  wrote it down
They turn to Will who places his proof on the projector
The image is cast over their faces
It reads: As Pekec reads and the realization dawns on him: It's just simpler this way
Lambeau turns with satisfaction to an understanding Pekec
Alexander, your theory is changed
: '  -- Will and Skylar in her room, post coital
They are wrapped in a sheet
Will is absent-mindedly playing the memory game The pattern grows increasingly complex
After a beat: Why do we always stay here
'Cause it's nicer than my place
've never seen your place
Exactly
What about your friends
Or your brothers
When do  get to meet them
They don't come over here that much
think  can make it to South Boston
Aah, it's kind of a hike
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around
All right, all right
We'll go
When
Sometime
don't know
Next week
What if  said  wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends
'd say
(reaches for phone) It's only four in the mornin', they're prob'ly up
She laughs
Stops him
You men are shameful
If you're not thinking of your wiener then you're acting on its behalf
Then on behalf of my wiener, 'd like to ask for an advance
: &  -- Skylar and Will sit together along with Will's gang
The boys are considerably drunk, but it makes for good entertainment
Everyone here is having fun including Sylar
Will,  can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked
What's she gonna think about us
Yeah, Morgan
It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'
've been shit faced for like two weeks
Oh great, tell her that
Now she really thinks we're problem drinkers
Two weeks
That's nothin'
My Uncle Marty
Will knows him
That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen
One night he was drivin' back to his house on -93 -- Statie pulls him over
Oh shit
Guy's tryin' to walk the line -- but he can't even fuckin' stand up, and so my uncle's gonna spend a night in jail
Just then there's this fuckin' like fifty yards down the road
Some guy's car hit a tree
Some other guy
Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows
So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash
So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for
So he goes, "Fuck it
" He gets in his car and drives home
Holy shit
So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie
So my Uncle's like, "Is there a problem
" And the Statie's like " pulled you over and you took off
"  And my Uncle's like " never seen you before in my life,  been home all night with my kids
" And Statie's like "Let me get in your garage
" So he's like "All right, fine
" He takes around the garage and opens the door -- and the Statie's cruiser is in my Uncle's garage
No way
You're kiddin'
No, he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home
Fuckin' lights and everything
Did your Uncle get arrested
The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything
The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house
Everyone is laughing
Skylar speaks above the din
There was this Irish guy, walking down the beach one day
She has everyone's attention
Will is nervous
And he comes across a bottle, and this Genie pops out
The genie turns to the Irishman and says -- "You've released me from my prison, so 'll grant you three wishes
" The Irish guy thinks for a minute and says "What  really want is a pint of Guiness that never empties
"  And -- bottle appears
He slams it down, and -- lo and behold -- it fills back up again
/ of Will
Hoping the joke pans out
Well, the Irish guy can't believe it
He drinks it again, and again -- It fills back up
So, while the Irish guy is marveling at his good fortune, The Genie is getting impatient, because it's hot and he wants to get on with his freedom
He says "Let's go, you have two more wishes
" The Irish guy slams his drink again, it fills back up, he's still amazed
The Genie can't take it anymore
He says "Buddy, 'm boiling out here
What are your other two wishes
" (beat) The Irish guy looks at his drink, looks at the Genie and says
" guess 'll have two more of these
" The gang erupts with laughter
It's a good thing no one's Irish here
'm Irish
Chuckie, Will look at Morgan, baffled
&  -- Everyone is walking out, saying good-bye
Chuckie goes over to Will and Skylar
'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people
See ya' Chuckie
had fun
Chuckie heads towards Will to say goodnight
don't know what the fuck you're doin'
You're givin' us a ride
What do  look like, Al Cowlins
(seriously) You want to take my car, drop her off
was countin' on it
Chuck, let's go
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car
Morgan mumbles something and staggers off
Billy follows with an indifferent shrug
Thanks, Chuck
Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first
don't know, Chuck
It's kinda outta the way
Just 'cause you don't have to sleep in the one room palace, don't start thinkin' you're bad
(to Will) thought you said you'd show me your place
Not tonight
Yeah, not tonight
Not any other night
He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit
wanted to meet your brothers
Chuckie gives Will a curious look
They're all sleepin' now
(a beat, to Chuckie) Let me get those keys
: -- cocktail party is underway
Professors mingle with representatives from high tech companies
Lambeau stands holding a drink and surrounded by several
Apparently he's the star of the show
#1 What  want to know, Gerry, is when we get to meet this wonder-boy
We're still working together, the boy's a little rough
#2 We've got our share of eccentric geniuses at Tri-tech
We know how to deal with that
#3 think we all do
Laughter
#1 If you're not exaggerating, Gerry-- Was  exaggerating in nineteen eighty- four when  told you 'd win the Field's medal within two years
More laughter
#1 In that case the boy could run shipping for us, routing-- #2 You say he doesn't have a diploma, but we'll #1 don't need to see a driver's license
can think of three departments right now that he could head up for us
At ease, gentlemen
We're looking carefully at all our options
#3 All right, Gerry
Close to the vest
(gives him his card) Good luck with these vultures
He walks off
: '  -- Timmy's Tap is a local watering hole, not unlike the  Street Bar
Sean is at the bar, telling a joke to  (45) the owner of the place, and several other
So she goes runnin' up the aisle and figure "fuck it" and  yell out "don't forget the coffee
The men erupt in laughter
, one of the regulars pipe up
Bullshit
You didn't say that
Timmy and Sean exchange a look
Jesus Christ, Marty
It's a joke
Lambeau enters, a bit overdressed in his sport coat and tie
Gerry
Any trouble finding the place
Not at all
Timmy this is Gerry, an old friend of mine
We went to college together
Good to meet you
Pleasure to meet you
Could we get a couple of sandwiches
(beat, smiles) Put it on my tab
Sean heads towards a table
You ever plan on payin' your tab
(pulls out lottery ticket) got the winning numbers right here
What's the jackpot
Twelve million
don't think that'll cover it
Lambeau follows [Sean]
They sit
You're here quite a bit, then
live right around the corner
You moved
been here a couple years
There is an awkward moment
You wanted to talk about Will
Seems like it's going well
think so
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future
We haven't really gotten into it
Maybe you should
My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers
Jobs doing what
Cutting edge mathematics
Think tanks
The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest -- But 'm not sure he's ready for that
Sean,  really don't think you understand-- What don't  understand
Timmy comes over with the sandwiches
Thanks, Timmy
Excuse me, Timmy
Could you help us
We're trying to settle a bet
Uh-oh
Have you heard of Jonas Salk
Yeah, cured polio
You've heard of Albert Einstein
Timmy smiles
Gives him a look
How about Gerald Lambeau
Ever heard of him
No
Okay thank you, Timmy
So who won the bet
did
beat
Timmy leaves
This isn't about me
'm nothing compared to this young man
(beat) Sean, in 1905 there were hundreds of Professors who were renowned for their study of the universe
But it was a 26-year-old Swiss Patent clerk, doing physics in his spare time, who changed the world, Sean
Can you imagine if Einstein had given that up
Or gotten drunk with his buddies in Vienna every night
All of us would have lost something
And 'm quite sure Timmy never would have heard of him
Isn't that a little dramatic, Gerry
No, Sean
This boy has that gift
He just hasn't got the direction
We can give that to him
beat
He married his cousin
Who
Einstein
Had two marriages, both trainwrecks
The guy never saw his kids, one of whom,  think, ended up in an asylum- possible Unabomber addition-- You see, Sean
That's exactly not the point
No one remembers that
They-- do
Well, you're the only one
Beat
This boy can make contributions to the world
We can help him do that
Just
take it easy, Gerry
Look,  don't know what else  can say
'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life
But it's important to start early
was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal
Maybe he doesn't care about that
beat
Sean, this is important
And it's above personal rivalry-- Now wait a minute, Gerry-- No, no you hear me out, Sean
This young man is a true prodigy-- Personal rivalry
'm not getting back at you
Look, you took one road and  took another
That's fine
Is it Gerry
'Cause  don't think it's fine with you
Give him time to figure out what he wants
That's a wonderful theory, Sean
It worked wonders for you
beat
Lambeau gets up
Sean,  came here today out of courtesy
wanted to keep you in the loop
As we speak the boy is in a meeting  set up for him over at Tri-tech
: - ,  -- Three well dressed -  sit around a conference table, which is littered with promotional brochures
The executives exchange a confused look
One of them speaks
(tentative) Well, Will, 'm not exactly sure what you mean, we've already offered you a position
Cut to reveal: Chuckie sitting across from the executives, hair combed down, wearing his Sunday best
Since this is obviously not my first time in such altercations, let me say this: Chuckie rubs the tips of his fingers together, indicating "cash
" The executives are baffled
Look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way
The executives are completely blank
At the current time  am looking at a number of different fields from which to disseminate which offer is most pursuant aid to my benefit
(a beat) What do you want
What do  want
What does anybody want
Leniency
'm not sure-- --These circumstances are mitigated
Right now
They're mitigated
Chuckie puts his hands up, as if getting a vibe from the room
Okay
Chuckie points to the third executive
He knows what 'm talking about
The third executive is baffled
retainer
Nobody in this town works without a retainer
You think you can find someone who does, you have my blessin'
But  think we all know that person isn't going to represent you as well as  can
Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits
Retainer
You want us to give you cash right now
Allegedly, what  am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if  had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now
The executives exchange looks and go for their wallets
don't think
Larry
have about seventy-three
Will you take a check
Come now
what do you think  am, a juvenile
You don't got any money on you right now
You think 'm gonna take a check
It's fine, John,  can cover the rest
That's right, you know
(turns to #1) He knows
Chuckie stands up and takes the money
(to exec #1) You're suspect
don't know what your reputation is, but after the shit you tried to pull today, you can bet 'll be looking into it
Any conversations you want to have with me heretofore, you can have with my attorney
Gentlemen, keep your ears to the grindstone
: ,   -- Will and Skylar sit in the open courtyard of this Harvard Square eatery
Skylar is working on another -chem lab
Will sits across from her, slightly bored watching her work
How's it goin'
Fine
Want me to take a look
No
'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages
It's important that  learn this
Why is it important to you
If inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing
Clearly
You're rich
What do you have to worry about
Rich
have an inheritance
It's two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school
This is what 'm doing with that money
could have done anything wanted
could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially
Instead you're going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke
No, so  can be a doctor
beat
Will nods
She looks down, then up
All right, Mr
Nosey Parker
Let me ask you a question
Do you have a photographic memory
guess
don't know
How do you remember your phone number
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry
Some, a little
Just for fun
guess so
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun
"  It's unnecessary
Especially for someone like you
Like me
Yeah
Someone like you who divides his time, fairly evenly, between the batting cages and bars
Will laughs
How did you do that
can't mean even the smartest people  know, and we do have a few at Harvard, have to study- a lot
It's hard
(beat) Listen, Will, if you don't want to tell me-- Do you play the piano
Come one Will
just want to know
'm trying to explain it to you
So you play the piano
When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart
see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay
Well all right, Beethoven
He looked at a piano and saw music
The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy
They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him
Stone deaf
He saw all of that music in his head
So, do you play the piano
Not a lick
look at a piano and see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood
Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them
They saw a piano and they could play
couldn't paint you a picture,  probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and can't play the piano-- But you can do my -chem lab in under an hour, you can-- When it came to stuff like that could always just play
Skylar is awestruck with admiration for Will, the Robot-pimp
So much so that Skylar has to kiss him, then push him away
can't believe it's taken me four years to meet you and 'm going to California in two months, Will
(beat) Have you ever been to California bet you'd like it
Will freezes
beat
Maybe not
: '  -- Chuckie sits on his couch, watching cartoons in his boxers and a tee-shirt, eating cereal
The doorbell rings
He sits
Get it, ma
She doesn't
He gets up
Opens door
It's Skylar
(surprised) Hey
Hi
How you doin'
Good
An awkward beat
How'd you know where to find me
(smiles) You were the only Sullivan in the phone book
Chuckie smiles
Will and  dropped you off here, remember
Oh, right
This is your house, right
Chuckie nods and is about to respond when he is interrupted by a nagging shriek from his mom
'  (
) Get in here, Chuckie
(calling back) Pipe down, Ma
guess so
What
No
This is my mother's house
don't live with my mother
just stop by, help out
'm good like that
Is this a bad time
She'll live
(beat) If she starts yelling again  might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but
Okay
Let's take a walk
'  -- Chuckie, still in his boxers walks with Skylar who is talking
See, now this doesn't feel right
(beat) When  made the decision to come over here it felt right
had all these rationalizations
just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies-- You caught that, huh
just wanted to find out what was going on
But now that 'm here it seems strange, doesn't it
Well,  don't have no trousers on
She laughs
beat
know why you're here
Will don't talk much
don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me
really don't know what to say
Look,  lie to women all the time
That's just my way
(beat) Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale
told them was a cosmonaut
They believed me
But Will's not usually like that-- Put some clothes on, Sullivan
Take it easy father
She laughs
All  can say is;  known Will a long time -- And  seen him with every girl he's ever been with
But 've never seen him like this before, ever with anyone, like how he is with you
Is that true
Yeah, it is
: '  -- Tom and Will are sitting waiting for Lambeau
Lambeau enters going over a thick proof Will has completed
This is correct
see you used Mclullen here-- don't know what it's called
--This can't be right
(examining proof) This is going to be very embarrassing
Have you ever considered-- 'm pretty sure it's right
Will gets up to leave
(turning back) Can  ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on
'Cause leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me-- That's fine, but did you ever think-- It's right
(a beat, heading out) Take it home with you
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting
couldn't go 'cause  had a date
So  sent my chief negotiator
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like
When  set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me
Then don't set up any more meetings
'll cancel every meeting right now
'll give you a job myself
just wanted you to see what was out there
Maybe  don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation
(indicates proof) You know how fuckin' easy this is to me
This is a joke
(crumples proof) And 'm sorry you can't do this really am
'Cause if you could wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up
Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk
Think of how many fights you could have been in by now
Will turns around reveling that he's lit the
Will drops it on the floor
Lambeau drops to his knees and puts it out
He looks up at Will
You're right, Will
can't do that proof and you can
And when it comes to this there are only twenty people in the world that can tell the difference between you and me
But 'm one of them
Well, 'm sorry
So am
(beat) Yes
That's right, Will
Most days wish  never met you
Because then could sleep at night
wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there
And  wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away
Lambeau gathers his composure and calmly walks over to the wrinkled proof
He picks it up, smooths it out
: '  -- Will and Skylar lie in bed
Skylar watches Will sleep
She gets up and goes to the fridge
Returning to the bed: Will
Are you awake
No
Come with me to California
What
want you to come with me
How do you know that
know
just do
Yeah, but how do you know
don't know
just feel it
And you're sure about that
Yeah, 'm sure
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'
mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like
And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake
" (getting upset) But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back
Now 'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come
But you don't really want me there
And 'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back
"Take-back
" What is that
don't want a take-back
want you to come to California with me
can't go out to California
Why not
One, because  have a job here and two because  live here-- (beat) Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that
'm not sayin' 'm not in love with you
Then what are you afraid of
What do you mean "What am  afraid of
" Why won't you come with me
What are you so scared of
What am  scared of
Well, what aren't you scared of
You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else-- Don't tell me about my world
You're the one that's afraid
You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry-- Is that what you think-- some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of
Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too
inherited that money when  was thirteen, when my father died
At least you have a mother
Fuck you
You think  want this
That money's a burden to me
Every day  wake up and  wish  could give that back
'd give everything have back to spend one more day with my father
But that's life
And deal with it
So don't put that shit on me
You're the one that's afraid
What the fuck am  afraid of
You're afraid of me
You're afraid that  won't love you back
And guess what
'm afraid too
But at least have the balls to it give it a shot
At least 'm honest with you
'm not honest
What about your twelve brothers
Oh, is that what this is about
You want to hear that  don't really have any brothers
That 'm a fuckin' orphan
Is that what you want to hear
Yes, Will
didn't even know that
No, you don't want to hear that
Yes,  do, Will
You don't want to hear that  got cigarettes put out on me when  was a little kid
That this isn't surgery
Will lifts his shirt, revealing a six inch  on his torso
You don't want to hear that
Don't tell me you want to hear that shit
Yes  do
Did you ever think that maybe  could help you
That maybe that's the point, that we're a team
What, you want to come in here and save me
Is that what you want to do
Do  have a sign that says "save me" on my back
don't want to "save" you
just want to be with you
love you love you
Will, full of self-loathing, raises his hand to strike her
Don't bullshit me
Don't fuckin' bullshit me
(standing up to him) You know what  want to hear want to hear that you don't love me
If you tell me that, then 'll leave you alone
won't ask any questions and  won't be in your life
beat
Will looks Skylar dead in the eye
Lowers his hand
don't love you
He walks out
: '  -- Will leaves pulling on his clothes
: ,  -- Will sits across from two
,   and These guys are smug, clean cut, gung-ho and looking sharp in twin navy blue suits
So why do you think  should work for the National Security Agency
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge
You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it
Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms-- Codebreaking
That's one aspect of what we do
Come on, that's what you do
You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload
You're seven times the size of the
That's exactly right, Will
So the question as  see it isn't "why should you work for
" it's "why shouldn't you
" Why shouldn't  work for the National Security Agency
That's a tough one
Will bites his tongue, trying to make this work
: '  -- Chuckie, Billy, and Will sit in the Sullivan kitchen
Billy cracks open a beer and Chuckie reads the sports page
Both boys are smoking
Will drinks a beer, distractedly
We hear the faint music track and soft moans of a emanating from a back room
After a beat, Chuckie looks up
Morgan, if you're watchin' pornos in my mom's room again 'm gonna give you a fuckin' beatin'
After a beat, Morgan comes out of the back room, red-faced
(innocently) What's up guys
Why don't you beat off at your house
don't have a  at my house
Will pays no attention to this exchange : -- Will is on pay phone talking to Skylar
just wanted to call before you left
(beat) 'm takin' all these job interviews
So  won't just be a construction worker
'  -- never cared about that
An awkward beat
Yeah
love you, Will
(pause) No take-backs
Will says nothing
Will
beat
Take care
Goodbye
Will hangs up
Hold on him for an agonizing beat
: '  -- Lambeau is scribbling away at work
Tom is taking notes
Will is tapping his fingers, waiting for him to finish
can
'm almost there
: -- Skylar stands at the gate, carry-ons in hand
Her flight is boarding
She looks for Will over the crowd
: '  -- Will picks up a  from Sean's desk
It is  ' Will has to smile
Lambeau looks up
What are you smiling at
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card
Will can see that Lambeau wants more
Pudge Fisk
You follow baseball
No
: -- The final boarding call is announced and the last passenger boards
After a beat, Skylar turns and gets on the plane
: '  -- Will, holding the card, reflects for a beat and puts it down
Oh, well, it's just somethin' Sean told me
It's a long story
beat
You all set
've got the first part
The rest can do at home
Will gets up
Will, the
has been calling me just about every hour
They're very excited about how the meeting went
Lambeau is excited
Will clearly is not
Yeah
: '  -- Will sits across from Sean
So you might be working for Uncle Sam
don't know
Gerry says the meeting went well
guess
What did you think
What did  think
beat
Will has obviously been stewing on this
Say 'm working at
Somebody puts a code on my desk, something nobody else can break
So  take a shot at it and maybe  break it
And 'm real happy with myself, 'cause did my job well
But maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East
Once they have that location, they bomb the village where the rebels were hiding and fifteen hundred people never had a problem with get killed
(rapid fire) Now the politicians are sayin' "send in the Marines to secure the area" 'cause they don't give a shit
It won't be their kid over there, gettin' shot
Just like it wasn't them when their number got called, 'cause they were pullin' a tour in the National Guard
It'll be some guy from Southie takin' shrapnel in the ass
And he comes home to find that the plant he used to work at got exported to the country he just got back from
And the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen cents a day and no bathroom breaks
Meanwhile my buddy from Southie realizes the only reason he was over there was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price
And of course the oil companies used the skirmish to scare up oil prices so they could turn a quick buck
cute, little ancillary benefit for them but it ain't helping my buddy at two-fifty a gallon
And naturally they're takin' their sweet time bringin' the oil back and maybe even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink seven and sevens and play slalom with the icebergs and it ain't too long 'til he hits one, spills the oil, and kills all the sea-life in the North Atlantic
So my buddy's out of work and he can't afford to drive so he's got to walk to the job interviews which sucks 'cause the shrapnel in his ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids
And meanwhile he's starvin' 'cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat the only blue-plate special they're servin' is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State
beat
So what'd  think
'm holdin' out for somethin' better
figure 'll eliminate the middle man
Why not just shoot my buddy, take his job and give it to his sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard
Christ, could be elected President
Do you think you're alone
What
Do you have a soul-mate
Define that
Someone who challenges you in every way
Who takes you places, opens things up for you
soul-mate
Yeah
Sean waits
Shakespeare, Neitzche, Frost, 'Connor, Chaucer, Pope, Kant-- They're all dead
Not to me, they're not
But you can't give back to them, Will
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no
That's what 'm saying, Will
You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road
Oh, what
You're going to take the professor's side on this
Don't give me your line of shit
didn't want the job
It's not about that job
'm not saying you should work for the government
But, you could do anything you want
And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have
What do you want to do
didn't ask for this
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will
That's a cop-out
Why is it a cop-out
don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home 'm buildin'
Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me
There's honor in that
You're right, Will
Any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man
beat
Will says nothing
And when they get drunk and puke in the sink, they don't have to see it the next morning because of you
That's real work, Will
And there is honor in that
Which 'm sure is why you took the job
beat
just want to know why you decided to sneak around at night, writing on chalkboards and lying about it
(beat) 'Cause there's no honor in that
Will is silent
Something you want to say
Sean gets up, goes to the door and opens it
Why don't you come back when you have an answer for me
What
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time
What
Will loses it, slams the door shut
Fuck you
Sean has finally gotten to Will
Who the fuck are you to lecture me about life
You fuckin' burnout
Where's your "soul-mate
" Sean lets this play out
Possible "shepard" change
Dead
She dies and you just cash in your chips
That's a fuckin' cop- out
been there
played my hand
That's right
And you fuckin' lost
And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again
Look at me
What do you want to do
beat
Will looks up
You and your bullshit
You got an answer for everybody
But  asked you a straight question and you can't give me a straight answer
Because you don't know
Sean goes to the door and opens it
Will walks out
: '   -- Will and Chuckie take crowbars to a wall
This is what they do for a living
As they routinely hammer away, Will becomes more involved in his battle with the wall
Plaster and lathing fly as Will vents his rage
Chuckie, noticing, stops working and takes a step back, watching Will
Will is oblivious
: '  -- Lambeau and Tom are in his office
Will is nowhere to be seen
Lambeau is on the phone
What  mean, Sean, is that 'm sitting in your office and the boy isn't here
(beat) Well, it's ten past three
(beat) An hour and ten minutes late
(beat) Well, if he doesn't show up and have to file a report saying he wasn't here and he goes back to jail, it won't be on my conscience, Sean
(beat) Fine
He hangs up
Tom picks up a  up off the desk
What should  do
The boy was here
He came in, sat down and we worked together
blank look
He came in, sat down, and we worked together
Okay
Tom understands, begins filling out the form
: '   -- Will walks out carrying a brown bag
He is filthy, having just knocked off work
: '   -- Chuckie is sitting on the hood of his Cadillac, watching Will across the street
Chuckie is covered in grime as well
Will starts walking towards Chuckie
As he draws closer, he heaves a can of Budweiser a good thirty yards, to Chuckie who handles it routinely
Will takes a seat next to Chuckie and they crack open their beers
Other workers file out of the site
They drink
How's the woman
Gone
What
She went to Medical school in California
Sorry, brother
(beat) don't know what to tell ya
You know all the girls  been with
You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother
Oh 'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes
Some shows are worth the price of admission, partner
This gets a small laugh from Will
My fuckin' back is killin' me
passing    overhears this
That's why you should'a gone to college
Fuck you
Suck my crank
Fuckin' sheet metal pussy
(beat) So, when are you done with those meetin's
Week after 'm twenty-one
Are they hookin' you up with a job
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years
Yah, but it's better than this shit
At least you'd make some nice bank
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat
It's a way outta here
What do  want a way outta here for
want to live here the rest of my life
want to be your next door neighbor
want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, 'll fuckin' kill you
And that's not a threat, that's a fact
'll fuckin' kill you
Chuckie, what are you talkin'
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have
Why is it always this
owe it to myself
What if  don't want to
Fuck you
You owe it to me
Tomorrow 'm gonna wake up and 'll be fifty and 'll still be doin' this
And that's all right 'cause 'm gonna make a run at it
But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in
And that's bullshit 'cause 'd do anything to have what you got
And so would any of these guys
It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years
You don't know that
Let me tell you what  do know
Every day  come by to pick you up, and we go out drinkin' or whatever and we have a few laughs
But you know what the best part of my day is
The ten seconds before  knock on the door 'cause  let myself think  might get there, and you'd be gone
'd knock on the door and you wouldn't be there
You just left
beat
Now,  don't know much
But  know that
: '  -- Lambeau stands across from Sean, seething
This is a disaster
brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out-- Now wait a minute-- --And confuse him-- --Gerry-- And here  am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake-- Hold on
Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this
know what 'm doing and  know why 'm here
Look Sean,  don't care if you have a rapport with the boy --  don't care if you have a few laughs -- even at my expense
But don't you dare undermine what 'm trying to do here
"Undermine
" He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility
And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point-- He is at a fragile point
He's got problems-- What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with-- Why do you think he does that, Gerry
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you
Why is he hiding
Why is he a janitor
Why doesn't he trust anybody
Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most
Oh, come on, Sean-- And why does he hang out with his friends
Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to
It's called loyalty
Oh, that's nice-- And who do you think he's handling
He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him
And for 20 years he's been alone because of that
And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again
And 'm not going to let that happen to him
Now don't do that
Don't you do that
Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit
That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay
If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been-- --'m not angry at you-- Yes you are, Sean
You resent me
And 'm not going to apologize for any success that 've had
-- don't have any anger at you-- Yes you do
You're angry at me for doing what you could have done
Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure
That's it
That's why  don't come to the goddamn reunions
Because can't stand the look in your eye when you see me
You think 'm a failure
know who  am
'm proud of who  am
And all of you, you think 'm some kind of pity case
You with your sycophant students following you around
And your Goddamn Medal
Is that what this is about, Sean
The Field's Medal
Do you want me to go home and get it for you
Then will you let the boy-- don't want your trophy and  don't give a shit about it
'Cause  knew you when
You and Jack and Tom Sanders
knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on
That's right
You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now
So don't blame me for how your life turned out
It's not my fault
don't blame you
It's not about that
It's about the boy
'Cause he's a good kid
And  won't see this happen to him- won't see you make him feel like a failure too
He won't be a failure
If you push him into something, if you ride him-- You're wrong, Sean
'm where  am today because  was pushed
And because  learned to push myself
He's not you
beat
Lambeau turns, something catches his eye
Sean turns to look, '
He is standing in the doorway
can come back
No, that's fine, Will
was just leaving
There is an awkward moment as Lambeau gets his coat and leaves
Well, 'm here
(beat) So, is that my problem
'm afraid of being abandoned
That was easy
Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way
And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you
Do you want to talk about it
Sean smiles
beat
Will sees a  on Sean's desk
What's that
Oh, this is your file
have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation
You're not going to fail me are you
Sean smiles
So what's it say
You want to read it
No
(beat) Have you had any experience with that
Twenty years of counseling you see a lot of-- No, have you had any experience with that
Yes
(smiles) It sure ain't good
'   -- From a child's
we see a man, partially obscured by a doorframe
The man turns toward the
: '  -- (after a pause) My dad used to make us walk down to the park and collect the sticks he was going to beat us with
Actually the worst of the beatings were between me and my brother
We would practice on each other trying to find sticks that would break
He used to just put a belt, a stick and a wrench on the kitchen table and say "choose
" '   -- large, callused hand sets down a wrench next to a stick
: '  -- Gotta go with the belt there
used to go with the wrench
The wrench, why
Cause fuck him, that's why
long quiet moment
Is that why me and Skylar broke up
didn't know you had
Do you want to talk about that
(beat) don't know a lot, Will
But let me tell you one thing
All this history, this shit
(indicates file) Look here, son
Will, who had been looking away, loos at Sean
This is not your fault
(nonchalant) Oh,  know
It's not your fault
(smiles) know
It's not your fault
know
It's not your fault
(dead serious) know
It's not your fault
Don't fuck with me
(comes around desk, sits in front of Will) It's not your fault
(tears start) know
It's not
(crying hard) know,  know
Sean takes Will in his arms and holds him like a child
Will sobs like a baby
After a moment, he wraps his arms around Sean and holds him, even tighter
We pull back from this image
Two lonely souls being father and son together
-- Will rides the Red Line, above ground
He looks out over the landscape
Small back yards, laundry hangs from wire lines
Chainlink fences, overgrown with weeds
-- Will walking through South Boston
He cuts through a park senior citizen is spearing trach for the city
'  -- Will at home
Not reading
Looks up at the ceiling
-  -- Will walks up to a nondescript building, he walks through the glass doors, into the lobby
: - ,  -- Will walks into the lobby
looks up
Can  help you
Yeah, my name is Will Hunting
'm here about a position
One moment
The guard reaches for the phone
to the sound of laughter
&  -- Chuckie is again regaling Will and the guys at their table
Oh my God,  got the most fucked up thing  been meanin' to tell you
Save it for your mother, funny guy
We heard it before
Oh, Morgan
They both get up, in one another's face
This is a play fight
"You gonna start
" "You gonna pay my hospital bills
" Sorry to miss this
-- Will comes back from the bathroom
(to Chuckie) You and Morgan throw
No,  had to talk him down
Why didn't you yoke him
Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, dude
'd rather fight a big kid, they never fight, everyone's scared of 'em
You know how many people try to whip Morgan's ass every week
Fuckin' kid won't back down
(from across the table) What'd you say about me
Shut the fuck up
Billy walks in the door and give Chuckie a look
Chuckie turns to Will
(To Will) Hey, asshole
Happy Birthday
You thought we forgot, didn't you know 'm gettin' my licks in
Laughter as the boys converge on Will
He goes willingly out the door
-- As they come out the door, rather than beating Will mercilessly, they stop
Morgan goes into his own, personal rendition of "Danny Boy
" No one joins in
Shut up, Morgan
(to Will) Here's your present
Chuckie indicates an old  , parked illegally in front of the bar
You're kiddin' me
Yeah,  figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and  knew  wasn't gonna drive you every day
Laughter
Morgan wanted to get you a "" pass
No  didn't
Will approaches the car to take a closer look
But you're twenty-one now, so-- Yeah, now that you can drink legally, we thought the best thing to get you was a car
More laughter
Will inspects the Nova
You're kiddin' me
(a beat) This is the ugliest fuckin' car ever seen in my life
Laughter, a beat
(serious) How the fuck did you guys do this
Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it
Morgan was out panhandlin' every day
Fuck you,  did the body work
Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo
Guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin' job
had to let him help with the car
So, you finally got a job Morgan
Had one, now 'm fucked again
(to Chuckie) So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai engine under there
Can  make it back to my house
Fuck you
re-built the engine myself
That thing could make it to Hawaii if you wanted it to
Chuckie gives Will a look
Happy 21, Will
: '  -- Will sits across from Sean
Which one did you take, Will
Over at Tri-tech
One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with haven't told him yet, but  talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy
That's what you want
Yeah,  think so
Good for you
Congratulations
Thanks you
(a beat) So, that's it
We're done
We're done
You did your time
You're a free man
beat
just want you to know, Sean
You're Welcome, Will
'll keep in touch
'm gonna travel a little bit, so don't know where 'll be
Will smiles
just
figured it's time  put my money back on the table, see what kind of cards  get
Will smiles
Sean hands him a piece of paper
'll be checking in with my machine at the college
If you ever need anything, just call
Sean smiles
Do what's in your heart, son
You'll be fine
Thanks you, Sean
They embrace
No
Thank you
(re: embrace) Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship
Only if you grab my ass
They laugh
See ya
Good luck
Both men smile
: '  - Will comes out of Sean's office and sees Lambeau walking up
(surprised) Will
Hey, how you doin'
You know, you're no longer required to come here
was just sayin' goodbye to Sean
(a beat) Sam called me
From Tri-tech
He says you start working for them next week
Will nods
Well, that's,  think that's terrific
Congratulations
Thank you
just want you to know
It's been a pleasure
Bullshit
They laugh
This job
Do it if it's what you really want
appreciate that
moment
Will starts to go, Lambeau watches him for a beat, Will turns back around
Hey, Gerry
Yes
Listen, 'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call
(has to smile) Thank you, Will
'll do that
Will smiles, turns and walks away
'  -- Sean is packing his office
Lambeau opens the door
Hello, Sean
Come in
Sean
(a beat) Me too
moment
So  hear you're taking some time
Yeah
Summer vacation
Thought 'd travel some
Maybe write a little bit
Where're you going
don't know
India maybe
Why there
Never been
Lambeau nods
Do you know when you'll be back
(picks up a flyer from his desk) got this mailer the other day
Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months
got one of those too
You should come
'll buy you a drink
Lambeau smiles
Sean
beat
The drinks at those things are free
Sean smiles
Hell,  know that
Both men laugh
How about one now
Sounds good
They start to walk out
It's on you though, until eight o'clock tonight when  win my money
Sean pulls out his lottery ticket
They start out down the hall
: -- On their backs as they walk down the hall
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery
don't know
Gotta be at least four to one
About thirty million to one
You're pretty quick with those numbers
How about the odds of me buying the first round
About thirty million to one
: -- Will sits alone, thinking
We hold on him for an extended beat until he gets up and walks away
'  -- Begin final sequence
wide, establishing shot of Sean's apartment complex as the sun is setting
The lights are on in one unit
tighter shot reveals Sean, in his apartment, packing his belongings in cardboard boxes
' ,  -- The camera cranes down from Sean's window and onto the street, where we pan to reveal Will, sitting in his car and looking up at Sean as he packs his things
Will's car is packed full of clothes and books
-- Chuckie and the boys drive down the street in the Cadillac
Morgan and Billy ride in the back, leaving the shotgun seat open for Will
'  -- Will holds an envelope which he slips in Sean's mailbox
He puts the flag up and smiles as he looks up at Sean in his apartment who is still unaware that Will is there
'  -- Chuckie pulls up in front of Will's house
He honks the horn, waits a beat, then gets out and heads toward the house
'  -- Will drives away from Sean's house
Sean hears the car pull out and looks out the window
Sean sees Will's car pulling away
Curious, he investigates
'  -- Chuckie walks up Will's front steps
'  -- Sean walks out to the sidewalk and looks around
Seeing the mailbox flag has been raised, he walks over to it
'  -- Chuckie knocks on Will's front door
There is no answer
He waits a beat, looks in the window
An incredulous smile slowly starts to form
'  -- Sean opens the card Will left for him
It reads: (in writing) Sean -- If the Professor calls about that job, just tell him, "Sorry, had to go see about a girl
" '  -- Chuckie walks back towards his car unable to contain the broad smile
He knows Will is gone
He shrugs in explanation to the guys
Morgan takes Will's seat as they pull away from the curb
'  -- We pan up from the letter to Sean
broad smile comes over him
This is a look we haven't seen
Sean is truly happy
-- Will is on the road, driving away
As we pull back and credits roll, the car disappears into the horizon
