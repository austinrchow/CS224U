href <b>// --> </b> Hannah and Her Sisters by Woody Allen As the last credit appears, the song ends in a crescendo and the screen fades to total black
Immediately, a new melody begins, an uptempo jazz number, as a title appears on the screen
"God, she's beautiful
" : '  - full face of Lee, wearing a gray sweater and leaning against the dining room doorway
She gazes into the camera with a half-smile on her face as Elliot speaks over the screen
(
) God, she's beautiful
Lee glances over her shoulder, then turns from the doorway and walks away
The camera follows her, moving across a book-and-photograph-filled bookshelf that obscures her from view as she walks into a crowded, comfortable vestibule
People, some holding drinks, some just entering the apartment, surround her
Everyone is talking at once, carrying on easy, familiar conversation
(
) She's got the prettiest eyes, and she looks so sexy in that sweater
Lee smiles at the various people, exchanging greetings
Hi, how are you
Two more guests enter the apartment; the vestibule is full now
Still walking, Lee lightly hugs one of the children as she continues on her way towards the living room
Elliot's voice, as well as the jazzy music, is heard
(
) just want to be alone with her and hold her and kiss her
Lee walks into the living room, turning her head back for a moment to talk to the child she has just hugged
(
) and tell her how much  love her and take care of her
Stop it, you idiot
She's your wife's sister
But  can't help it
The camera is still moving with Lee as she smiles and stops to chat with her mother
Elliot's voice, as well as the music, continues over the low din of warm conversation
(
) 'm consumed by her
It's been months now
dream about her
- ,  think about her at the office
Oh, Lee
(sighing) What am  gonna do
Lee starts to walk off again, finishing her conversation with her mother
She passes several other guests, then turns to greet April, giving her a warm, brief hug
(
) hear myself mooning over you, and it's disgusting
Before, when she
Elliot's voice-over continues as he is actually seen, standing in a doorway having a conversation with a gesturing, rotund man
Both are holding drinks as Lee, carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres and two drinks, walks between them
The space is very tight; the men hold up their drinks to make room for her
(
) squeezed past me in the doorway, and  smelled that perfume on the back of her neck
Elliot watches Lee walk off; the other man, oblivious, continues to talk
Elliot reluctantly returns to the conversation, but he can't help turning his head to gaze at the offscreen Lee as the other man chatters on
(
) Jesus, ,  thought  was gonna swoon
Easy
The camera resumes following a smiling Lee
She has just put down the tray and drinks near April, and briskly and obliviously, she walks past a doorway where Elliot, still ruminating, watches her, entranced
(
) You're a dignified financial advisor
It doesn't look good for you to swoon
The camera stays with Elliot, who is still watching the offscreen Lee
In the background, guests continue to chatter warmly with each other
Hannah, carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres, walks up behind the distracted Elliot
(nibbling on an hors d'oeuvre) Elliot
Elliot
(rubbing his shoulder) Sweetheart
Elliot returns from his reveries with a start
(turning to Hannah) Mm-hm
(pointing to the tray) Have you tried these
These are wonderful
(nibbling, swallowing) Holly and her friend made them
Elliot, taking one of the hors d'oeuvres, starts nibbling as well as he and Hannah walk past the bookshelf into the living room
(swallowing) They're fantastic
(overlapping, still eating) Aren't they great
Your sister is an unbelievable cook
(swallowing) know
know
Elliot and Hannah, eating and talking, walk past a hallway and offscreen as Holly appears, walking down the hallway
She holds a drink and a plate of hors d'oeuvres; she stands at the entrance to the hallway, eating and looking at the offscreen guests
(walking offscreen) She has all the cooking talent
(walking offscreen swallowing) No, she doesn't, either
You've got tons as well
(offscreen) Ohhh, but 've eaten five of these
Holly, standing in the hallway onscreen, swallows loudly
(offscreen, overlapping Holly) Holly, why don't you open your own restaurant
(turning to the offscreen Elliot and Hannah, trying to swallow) Mmm, we practically are
Well
(holding her hand to her mouth) not a restaurant, but
(swallowing) April and  are going to do some catering
(offscreen) What
You're kidding
(nodding) No, no, we decided
Holly takes a sip of her drink as Hannah and Elliot walk over to her
Perfect
(nodding and swallowing) Mmm
mean, we love to cook for our friends, so (gesturing) we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties
(nodding) Great idea
(agreeing) know
(overlapping Hannah) That's where your talent lies
(swallowing and nodding) know
Holly and Hannah begin to laugh
(gesturing to Elliot, still laughing) Get outta here
(to Hannah) Could  speak to you privately
Oh, sure
Holly and Hannah walk off; Elliot watches them leave
(calling after them as he nibbles on an hors d'oeuvre) 'm her husband
She tells me anything
: '  - Hannah, licking her fingers, walks past a memo-cluttered refrigerator to the stove as Holly, behind her, begins to speak
The faint sounds of music are still heard
Hannah,  have to borrow some more money
(sipping her drink) Don't get upset
(stirring some food in a saucepan on the stove) Mmm,  never get upset over that
Mmm
This is the last time,  promise
And 'm keeping strict accounts
As Holly talks, sipping her drink, Hannah busily works in the kitchen, which contains a large center table stacked with bowls and plates of food, hanging pots and pans, and general party clutter
She walks on-and-offscreen as she talks and listens to her sister
Holly, please
Don't insult me
(putting her empty glass and plate down on the table) Someday, 'll pay it all back
know
-how much do you need
Two thousand dollars
Hannah, who'd been mashing some food in a bowl on a nearby counter, hesitates momentarily
She turns to Holly
(trying to nod her head casually) Uh-huh
(gesturing, her back to the camera) Hannah,  know it's a lot, but my friend April and , we have this catering idea  think's going to be great
Hannah, licking her fingers, walks past Holly
(turning to face Hannah) You admit that we're great cooks, right
(nodding, back at the stove now, stirring in a pot) Yeah
(putting her hands in her pockets) Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things  have to buy
(gesturing) and some old debts  have outstanding
(looking at her sister) Will you just tell me one thing
(nodding) Okay
Are we talking about cocaine again
(shaking her head no) swear
swear
We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties
timer goes off
Hannah walks past Holly to attend to some food on a different stove
Holly turns to face her
Only Holly is seen as she talks to the offscreen Hannah, the camera moving in closer on her face
As Holly speaks, she distractedly nibbles an hors d'oeuvre
In the background, her parents can be heard singing in the living room
mean, obviously, 'm not going to be a caterer forever, you know
We both still go to auditions
Something could turn up at any moment
But the parties are at night, days are free,  can still take my acting class
haven't done drugs on a year
Holly pops another hors d'oeuvre into her mouth as the background singing gets louder and the film cuts to: '   - The living room is crowded with family and guests sitting comfortably on chairs near the piano, where Evan, Hannah's father, plays "Bewitched" as Hannah's mother, Norma, sits nearby, accompanying him in their duet
child is sprawled out under a blanket on a sofa; some guests chatter quietly; others drink and eat, listening
& (singing) " whimpering, simpering Child again Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered Am
" As they continue to sing, the film cuts back to the kitchen, where Lee, carrying some glasses, enters through the doorway
Mom and Dad are floating down memory lane again
Lee walks over to her sisters, putting the glasses down on a counter
Hannah is scooping seeds out of a cantaloupe
Holly, leaning on the table, sips her drink
The music from the living room is softly heard as the three sisters chat comfortably and easily with each other
(smiling and turning to Lee) Aah
Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs
(nodding to Holly, touching her arm) think they're fantastic
(to Holly) You've outdone yourself
(overlapping her sisters, shrugging and smiling) Oh, my God
Thank you
(interrupting, to Hannah) need an antihistamine
Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so
(overlapping) Ohh
(overlapping, lighting a cigarette) Uh-oh
(continuing) before she starts turning into Camille
(laughing) (overlapping) Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning
(turning to Holly) At least she isn't drinking
Did you notice
(nodding) Mm-hm
(turning to look at her sisters, laughing) Doesn't she look great in that new dress
(nodding) Yeah
(nodding) Yeah
The sisters all talk at once; Hannah is still working at the sink
Don't you think she does
She really does, though
(turning towards the sink) Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here
(puffing on her cigarette) God
(scooping out some cantaloupe seeds) Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around
(to Lee, laughing) should get a garter belt
(laughing) Yeah
(looking down at herself) Get a garter belt
(sipping her drink) Get a garter belt and flirt
(laughing, to Hannah) Where are the antihistamines
Oh,  don-- Ask Elliot for that
Uh, he's got them somewhere
(nodding) Okay
Lee leaves the kitchen
Holly, puffing on her cigarette, watches her go
(sighing) Frederick didn't come with her
(turning to Holly, still working at the sink) When does Frederick ever come with her
(whispering intently) Tch
He's such an angry
he's such a depressive
thought she was moving out
Hannah shakes her head in disapproval while Holly angrily takes another sip of her drink
And the film cuts briefly back to the living room, where Evan is still playing the piano and singing
The camera moves past him and a few guests to Norma, who is enthusiastically singing along, looking at Evan and moving her hands
& (singing) " pill he is But still he is All mine and 'll Keep him until he is Bewitched, a'both--" : '   - The table is beautifully set for Thanksgiving dinner, complete with candles, flowers, cut crystal, china, and silver
Hannah's children are playing in the room as Hannah enters, carrying a huge roast turkey
Behind her is Holly, carrying a casserole
Hannah's parents can still be heard singing in the background
(to the children) Watch out, you guys
Beep-beep
(overlapping) Oh, your kids are so adorable
(walking through the doorway) Bye
Bye
(putting down her bowl on the table) God, it gets so lonely on the holidays
(setting down the turkey on the opposite end of the table) Oh, gosh
Well, you know, that's why  invited Phil Gammage tonight
As the sisters talk, the piano music stops
There's the sound of light applause as Evan begins a new song, faintly heard in the dining room
(grimacing, reacting to Hannah) Oh, Hannah
(overlapping) It's, uh, you never know-- (interrupting, gesturing) He's such a loser
He's not a loser at all
(shaking her head) Oh, he's such a loser
(overlapping, lighting a set of candles on the table) He's the headmaster of Daisy's school
Oh, perfect
He reminds me of Ichabod Crane
(moving her hand up and down her throat) His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited
(laughing) Listen
He's a lot better than your ex-husband
He's got a good job
(handing a pack of matches to Holly) Would you light those, please
He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything
(striking a match to light another set of candles) Give me a break
(offscreen) Am  interrupting
The film cuts to April, standing in the doorway of the dining room and holding a drink
(continuing) any sister talk
(offscreen) Mm-mm
(offscreen) Come in
The camera moves with April as she walks over to the table, where Hannah and Holly are lighting candles
Oh, good
(overlapping, still offscreen) Come in, come in
(gesturing) because there are no interesting single men at this party
(now onscreen) Oh, listen
(interrupting, waving out her match) know
It's terrible
(shaking her head) mean, 've looked everywhere
(picking at the turkey and gesturing) Maybe April would like Phil
Phil Gammage, the tall guy in there by the piano
Holly groans, looking at her sister, while April sips her drink and nods
(pointing to herself) Hm-mm
Oh, yeah
met Phil
(looking at April, nodding) Mmm
He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane
Hannah screams with laughter as she walks toward the end of the table, past a gleeful Holly, who points her finger at Hannah as she passes
Hannah, still laughing, playfully pushes the accusing finger away
(laughing with the sisters, gesturing) love that
That's my type
(shaking her head, laughing) can't believe it
She walks over to a nearby china cabinet
(nodding and looking at Hannah) No, really,  really like him a lot
(overlapping, laughing and gesturing) No, really, we mustn't get discouraged
As Holly continues to tease her sister, Hannah opens a drawer in the cabinet
She takes out two apples decorated with paper turkey heads and tails and hands them to April
(fussing at the table) Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane
(overlapping) Mmm
April starts to put the turkey apples on the table bemused Hannah takes two more out of the cabinet and places one of them on the table as well
(straightening a table setting) Not this Thanksgiving, you know
(overlapping, to April, who has just set down her apples) Here
Be careful with those
(continuing her teasing, gesturing) Maybe at Christmas, New Year's
If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's
While Holly is talking, Hannah hands her the last turkey apple, accidentally sticking her with one of the toothpicks that keeps the decorations in place
(reacting) Ouch
(turning to her sister in surprise) Oh
The film cuts to a short hallway leading to a bathroom in Hannah's apartment
In the foreground is a standing lamp
In the background, Elliot is seen walking inside the bathroom, looking around the room
Light piano music is dimly heard
(searching) Must be here someplace
He walks out of the bathroom, moving down the hallway towards the camera
(offscreen) Oh, you know, ,  love that book you lent me
The Easter Parade
You were right
It had very special meaning for me
How's Frederick
He didn't come
Elliot walks into the bedroom as Lee continues to talk offscreen
The camera, leaving Elliot, moves across the room, past a wall of framed paintings, a headboard and bed, a night table and lamp, revealing Lee
She is flipping through a book by a curtained window
(offscreen) Oh, well, you know Frederick
One of his moods
Although it wasn't a bad week
He (onscreen) uh, sold a picture
(offscreen) Oh, great
The camera stays with Lee as she walks around the room, past another curtained window, a television set, and a rolltop desk
She absently flips through the book as she talks to the offscreen Elliot
Yeah, it was, it was one of his better drawings, a very beautiful nude study
Actually, it was of me
(laughing) It's funny, you know, it's a funny feeling to know you're being hung naked in some stranger's living room
Lee puts the book she's been holding down on the desk, only to pick up another one
She looks at the offscreen Elliot
Well, you can't tell it's me, although-- (pausing) You're turning all red, Elliot
She reacts
The camera moves to a blushing Elliot, following him now as he walks across the room
(laughing self-consciously) Really
So, so, what else
Wh- what are you up to
(offscreen) Oh,  don't know
My unemployment checks are running out
Um,  was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings
As Lee speaks, Elliot parts a hanging curtain against the wall to reveal a stereo and some records
He looks at the offscreen Lee
Like, uh
(offscreen) don't know exactly
As Elliot reaches inside the stereo shelf, grabbing a bottle of antihistamines, the camera moves back to Lee, who sits down on the bed
She is still holding a book
Uh, sociology, psychology maybe always thought  might like to work with children
Elliot walks over to Lee; he sits down on a footstool in front of her
(gesturing with the bottle of pills gripped in his hand) Incidentally, - always have clients who are furnishing places
Some of them might-might be interested in buying art
Shall , shall  call you
(chuckling self-consciously) Yeah, sure
(taking the bottle of pills Elliot hands her) You know, uh, Frederick would really by grateful for a sale
She chuckles; Elliot smiles and chuckles with her
(offscreen) Hey, you guys
Elliot turns in the direction of his wife's voice
(offscreen) Dinner's ready
Hannah, eating a carrot stick, enters the bedroom
The camera stays with her momentarily as she walks towards Elliot and Lee
(offscreen) Oh, great
(overlapping) You look so beautiful
(offscreen) Come on
(standing by Elliot and Lee) Doesn't she look pretty
bumped into your
(overlapping, agreeing with Hannah) Yeah
(continuing) ex-husband on the street the other day
(biting her carrot) Oh, yeah
(gesturing) He was, he's just as crazy as ever
He was on his way to get a blood test
(laughing, Elliot joining in) (reacting) God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac
wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him
(standing up) Let's go have dinner, shall we
(overlapping) Mmm
(standing up, overlapping) Good idea
: - Everyone is seated around the table for Thanksgiving dinner
Facing the camera are Holly, Lee, Norma, and Hannah
She sits to the left of Elliot, who's at the head of the table
On his right is Evan; April sits next to him
She and the other guests sit with their backs to the screen
The table overflows with food, floral decorations, and candles
In the background, the children sit at a separate table; a maid serves them turkey
The guests chatter comfortably among themselves as they eat
(clanking a piece of silverware against his water glass) Now, ladies and gentlemen
(making a face) Dad
Evan continues to clank his glass to get everyone's attention
Dad
(reacting, to Holly) Oh
Dad
(still clanking) No, now
'm starving
Resigned, Holly puts down her silverware
Lee smothers a laugh
Norma, reacting, glances at Holly and Lee
Everyone knows what's coming
(clanking away) this is a toast
This is a toast
(reaching across the table for Evan's wine glass, laughing) Get his wine away
This is a toast
You know this beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was all
Holly laughs
Lee glances over to her, reacting
Hannah, embarrassed, reacts and sits with her hands on her face
Lee and the rest of the guests put down their silverware
They look at Evan, listening
prepared
by Hannah
Hannah, embarrassed, makes a victory sign
(modestly pointing to the maid) Uh, and a little help
Lee and Holly try to suppress their laughter
Norma glares at them
(to her daughters) Hey
(continuing) from Mavis, also
Elliot wraps his arm around Hannah; he pulls her towards him affectionately and kisses her on the cheek
She hugs him back
(hugging Hannah) You bet
(overlapping, looking down the table while still in Elliot's embrace) Holly and April, thanks for helping
Mavis the maid exits, carrying some trays, as the group starts to cheer and applaud
Holly waves her napkin at April, then holds up her wine glass
(overlapping the noise) No, you did it
(overlapping, toasting her friend) April, April
(overlapping, gesturing) am
did slave all day
(overlapping, holding out his wine glass) And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year
her great success in Doll's House
The group continues to cheer as they all toast Hannah
She reacts, smiling but embarrassed
(overlapping, laughing) Ya-a-a-a-y
(laughing) played Nora
hate to tell you what year
The guests, sipping their wine, quiet down as Norma continues to speak
Lee and Holly unsuccessfully try to contain their laughter
Mavis reenters the dining room to serve more food to the children
(continuing) And it's very difficult to behave like Torvald's little chipmunk without making a perfect ass out of yourself
(pausing while the guests laugh heartily) Now  think that Ibsen would have been damn proud of our Hannah
Norma toasts her daughter; everyone follows her
The applause and cheers begin anew
Hannah, reacting, chuckles
(overlapping the applause and clapping loudly) Speech
Speech
Speech
(overlapping) Yea-a-a-a-ah
few guests sip their wine
They all quiet down as Hannah starts her speech, glancing around the table and gesturing
(reacting) don't know about that
Oh, no, just, see, -'ve been very, very lucky
-when  had the kids, decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and 've been very, very happy (banging her fists lightly on the table) but
've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage
(nodding) Yeah
(overlapping) just for a second
So, now got that out of my system and  can go back to the thing that makes me happiest
Hannah tenderly takes Elliot's hand as she looks around the table
He, in turn, kneads her shoulder, chuckling with equal tenderness
(chuckling) Oh, bravo
Bravo
Hannah, still embarrassed, looks down at a plate
The group applauds once more, toasting and drinking, and warmly sounding their approval
: "We all had a terrific time
" Classical string music plays as the film cuts to: - taxi moves down Broadway towards the camera, passing a truck on the right, the Winter Garden marquee advertising Cats, and several buildings, and as the taxi moves offscreen, the classical music still playing, the movie cuts to the taxi's backseat
Lee sits by the window, leaning her head in her hand, a reflective look on her face
Her voice is heard over the screen
(
) Is it my imagination, or does Elliot have a little crush on me
(chuckling slightly) It's funny
've had that thought before
He pays a lot of attention to me all the time, and he blushed tonight when we were alone in the bedroom
wonder if he and Hannah are happy
It's funny,
still feel a little buzz from his flirting
: '  - Lee stirs a cup of coffee on the counter of the loft's modern kitchen area; a nearby vase hold flowers
She walks across the loft, with its high ceilings and beige walls, holding her coffee
(to an offscreen Frederick) Want some coffee or tea
(offscreen) No, thank you
Lee continues to walk, past a modern chaise, a bookcase, some sofas, two columns
Lamps hang down from the ceiling
The classical music still plays in the background
Lee stops at a plastic-enclosed work area
Frederick can be seen working at a drawing board on the other side of the clear plastic screen
(stirring her coffee) How about something to eat
No, nothing
The background music stops
Are you sure
Absolutely
(walking around the screen to Frederick) Mmm, what am  gonna do with you
(laughing) As Lee walks over to the drawing board where Frederick is sitting, he is seen intently cleaning some paintbrushes with a rag
Lee stands by him, leaning over the board, and looks directly at him
The table is filled with cans of brushes and artist's equipment
God
(sniffing) And why didn't you come tonight
We all had a terrific time really think you would have enjoyed yourself
(not looking at Lee) 'm going through a period of my life where  just can't be around people
(putting down the brushes and wiping his hands with the same rag) didn't want to wind up abusing anyone
You're not going to abuse them
They're all so sweet
(taking off his glasses) Lee
(pausing, reaching for Lee's hand) you are the only person  can be with
who  really look forward to being with
(pulling Lee to him, around the board) (compliantly) You're too harsh with everyone
You know that, don't you
Frederick and Lee embrace; Lee sighs
(looking into Lee's eyes) Isn't it enough that  can love you
(sighing) Mmm
Hmm
(overlapping) you're such a puzzle
(chuckling) So sweet with me and so
contemptuous of everyone else
(sighing) (sniffing) Well, there was a time (sniffing again) when you were very happy to be only with me
You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music
(nodding) Mm-hm
Have  really taught you everything have to give
(shakes his head) don't think so
Lee kisses Frederick twice, then releases him and walks out of the work area
(turning her head in Frederick's direction) Oh, Elliot said he might have a couple of clients for you
Lee walks over to the loft's stereo area, pulling up the sleeves of her sweater as Frederick talks
(offscreen) 'm sure all those morons he handles have a deep feeling for art
Lee picks up a book from the stereo shelf
She leans back against the unit, glancing through its pages
(flipping through the book) Mmm (chuckling) you never know
They might
He's just trying to do the nice thing
(offscreen) Because he likes you
(looking up from the book) Me
Yeah
Frederick, leaving his work area, walks past Lee; his hands are in his pockets
(looking at Lee as he goes by) Elliot lusts after you
Based on what
You never even see him
The camera stays with Frederick as he walks into the loft's bedroom area
Based on
whenever you see him, you always come home full of books he's recommended
He sits down at the foot of the bed and starts taking off his shoes
(continuing) or films you must see or
(shrugging) (walking over to him) Oh, no, no, no
He's my sister's husband
And  think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him
He's very intelligent
Lee sits down next to Frederick; he takes her hand
He's a glorified accountant, and he's after you
(kissing Lee's hand) And  prefer to sell my work to people who appreciate it, not to rock stars
(kissing Lee's face) You understand
Lee kisses Frederick back on the cheek
They embrace
Frederick laughs; their embrace gets tighter
(sighing) Ohhh
: The hypochondriac
Upbeat jazz plays in the background and continues as the film cuts to: - Metal elevator doors open and Mickey Sachs, a high-powered television producer, walks out, deep in conversation with his assistants, Paul and Larry
As the elevator operator begins to reclose the door with his passengers, Mickey, his assistants fast behind, walks down an office corridor past busy groups of studio personnel
Indistinct conversation, as well as the jazz, is heard in the background as the trio talk
(gesturing) What do you mean, they won't let us do the sketch
Talk to Standards and Practices
They think it's too dirty
The trio pass Mary, another assistant, in conversation with two other co-workers
She holds a clipboard
But we showed it to them in rehearsal
Without missing a beat, he takes Mary's wrist and continues walking
(to Paul) You know, what'd they do, figure out what the words mean
foursome now, they briskly walk past a man and a woman going over a script
Mary and Mickey lead; Paul and Larry follow
Mickey, we got a half hour to air
As the group walks through a large doorway, Larry catches up to Mickey
We're short
The show is five minutes short
The group turns right into a new corridor, briefly off the screen
As they scurry off, their voices are heard
How could it be short
We timed everything (offscreen) long
(offscreen) If we have to
They are all now seen walking down the new corridor towards the camera
The corridor is crowded with busy  personnel
The group continues to talk frantically as people hurry past them
One man pushes rudely past Mary as he walks; she looks back at him briefly
(continuing) pull out the sketch, then we'll be ten minutes short
(gesturing) don't know how they can do that to us
That's-- We go on in thirty minutes, right
Mary checks her wristwatch as they rush down the corridor
(squeezing past several passersby) They're doing it because our ratings are low
(nervously rubbing his forehead) got such a migraine
As the group briskly walks past an open door, Gail, another assistant, runs out, brandishing her glasses
(offscreen) Hey, Mickey
Gail runs in front of the group
Without missing a step, she faces Mickey and walks backwards, gesturing and talking frantically
Mickey
Listen, we better go right to Ronny's dressing room
This kid must have taken sixteen hundred Quaaludes
don't think he's going to be able to do the show
The fast-tracking group turns the corner
Gail pats Mickey's back; she gestures in exasperation
(gesturing towards heaven) Why me, Lord
What did -- He is interrupted by Ed Smythe, an official from the Standards and Practices Department, who's been standing in the corridor waiting for Mickey
Mickey stops and shakes Ed's hand as if he'd known the official would be there
Gail stops by his side while the others walk into a background studio doorway that is busy with scurrying personnel
You-- (pointing) Standards and Practices
Ed Smythe, yes
Okay
Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty
(putting his hands on his hips) (gesturing) Child molestation is a touchy subject
(overlapping, looking at Gail) Could you-- (continuing) with the affiliates
(overlapping and grunting) Read the papers
Half the country's doing it
(pointing at Mickey) Yes, but you name names
(gesturing) We nev-- We don't name names
(turning to Gail for support, briefly touching her shoulders, then looking back at Ed) We say the Pope
(gesturing emphatically) We always say the Pope
That sketch
(overlapping) We-- (continuing) cannot go on the air
writer, holding a script, walks out of the background studio, looking around
Oh, Je-- (interrupting, shouting) Hey
Mickey, Gail, and Ed turn towards the writer
(angrily, slapping his script) Who changed my sketch about the
Mickey and Gail walk over to the angry writer, Ed forgotten with this new crisis
(gesturing) had to make some cuts
It's four lousy lines
The whole premise is ruined
Mickey, Gail, and the writer start walking down a corridor adjacent to the studio
(gesturing, trying to calm the writer down) Oh, you're crazy
It's not so delicate
Everybody's married to every line
The writer reacts angrily
Gail tries to get Mickey's attention as they walk
(tapping Mickey's shoulder) Mickey,  can-- (interrupting, angrily gesturing) don't care
don't want anyone tampering with my goddamn work without telling me
(shrugging) Okay
(pointing angrily) You want 'em cut
'll cut 'em myself
Mickey, still in surprised shock, turns away from the angry writer
He stands by an open dressing room, where Ron, an actor, slouches, dazed, in a chair facing a makeup mirror
People mill in the background behind the actor
(shrugging, distracted) All right, all right
(muttering) (overlapping, trying to get Mickey's attention and gesturing) Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen
(distractedly, his mind still on the writer) You know
(muttering as the writer passes him and walks away) (overlapping, gesturing) In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number
(still distracted, looking off) No-- (overlapping) don't feel good, Mickey
Mickey, remembering Ron, runs into the dressing room
Gail follows him
Inside, a man and a woman talk, ignoring Ron
They share a drink in a paper cup
The woman looks back at Ron; she gestures with disgust
(gesturing) Yeah, wh-- Yeah, what did you do
Swallow a drugstore
Ron coughs
(to Gail) Look at this guy
(overlapping, touching Ron's chair) Yeah
(groaning) lost my voice
Gail walks around the chair
The camera shows she and Mickey talking to Ron through the reflection in the cluttered makeup mirror
(reacting) Oh, Jesus
(gesturing) Ron
Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes
Ron sighs
(looking around, touching his stomach) Hey, does anybody got a Tagamet
My, my ulcer's starting to kill me
(sighing) You want a Quaalude
Mickey, as reflected in the mirror, starts to pace as the movie cuts to: - Norman, a Los Angeles  producer and Mickey's former partner, is driving down a peaceful street lined with palm trees
He's wearing sunglasses and headphones
He clicks his fingers in time to the music only he hears on his Walkman
He's smiling contentedly while Mickey talks over the sun-filled scene
The continuous background jazz plays louder
(
) Christ, this show is ruining my health
Meanwhile, my ex-partner moves to California and every stupid show he produces turns out to be a big hit
Brother, what am gonna do with my life
Speaking of that, -
gotta remember to see my ex-wife tomorrow
Tch
: '   - As Mickey finishes his ruminations, Hannah is seen walking towards her front door
She opens it, her back to the camera
Mickey stands there holding two boxed gifts
The jazz stops
Hi
Hi
(overlapping, sniffing) know
know
Glad you could put in an appearance
(gesturing) got two minutes
(overlapping) Very good
Hannah nods as Mickey comes inside
She closes the door behind him
(overlapping) got two minutes
'Cause, God, the show is killing me
got a million appointments today
It just so happens it fell this way
Hannah continues to nod patiently, patting Mickey on the back, as they make their way across the foyer into the den, where the twins are playing
Mickey wears his coat
gotta see new comedians later, 've gotta-- (interrupting) Two minutes on your sons' birthday
You know, it's not going to kill you
Her voice trails off as Mickey walks over to the twins
Happy Birthday, fellas
Happy Birthday
Hannah's twins greet Mickey with cries of "Hi, Daddy
" and indistinct chatter
(overlapping their chatter, bending down to talk to her sons) Guys, look what Daddy brought
Presents
Mickey hands a gift to each twin
They grow quiet, suddenly shy
(to his sons) Yeah, aren't you like, you know
(overlapping) Huh
(continuing, holding out his arms) a little, uh, hey
little hug
What is this
Now how 'bout a little action from the kids
The twins put down their gifts, one on the sofa, one on the coffee table, and hug their father
(turning to Hannah) How is everything
(picking up the gift on the sofa and nodding) Everything's good
Everything's fine
(nodding, overlapping) Yeah
Yeah
(pointing) Okay, kids, you can open the presents now
(overlapping) Here, you guys
Open them up
Hannah makes room on the coffee table for the gift she is holding; she places it next to the other one
The boys start opening them
Let me get a little reaction here
(to Hannah, putting his hands in his pockets) How's Elliot
He's fine
Yeah
(overlapping) Oh, you know what
'm trying to convince him to produce a play
Oh
think he'll find that satisfying
(nodding) Really
That'll be terrific for him,  think
think so
like him
think he's a sweet guy
(stroking one of the twins' backs) Yeah
The few times that 've met him
(pointing to the baseball mitt twin #1, has taken out of his box) Isn't that a great mitt
#1 Thank you, Daddy
(overlapping to Hannah) 'Cause he's a loser
(overlapping, to Twin #1) Ohh
(overlapping, gesturing) -he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me
(overlapping, chuckling) know,  know
(overlapping) so , so  like that
always like an underconfident person
(overlapping, touching the mitt and reacting) That's really nice
(still rambling on, gesturing to Hannah) you know
, uh
(overlapping) You know, he's been wanting a mitt
She helps Twin #2 open his present
It's a football
You've always had good taste in husbands, so
(chuckling and nodding) Thanks, thanks
Mh-hm
(leaning down to look at the football) That's a beauty
Isn't that great
Oh
(pointing, to Twin #2) Go right over there
Football
Twin #2, panting, runs offscreen to catch the football
(to the offscreen twin) Come on
Hurry up
Let's go
(looking offscreen at twin #2) Wow
(still pointing, gearing up for the pass) Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and catch this
Mickey throws the football
See
(whistling) (pointing offscreen) Hey, d-- Watch, watch the picture
There's a sound of breaking glass
Hannah and Mickey react
: - Mickey is walking up a West Side street, his hands in his coat pockets
Jazz plays in the background as he talks over the screen
(
) Gee, Hannah's sweet
Although, sometimes  still do get angry when think of things
Oh, what the hell
At least, 'm not paying child support
(sighing) Oh, God,  hope there's nothing physically wrong with me, either
Mickey pushes open the outside door of Dr
Abel's office, as the movie cuts to the doctor's consultation room
The doctor is framed in the doorway, looking through a file cabinet
(taking out Mickey's file) So what's the, uh, problem this time
(offscreen) This time  really think  have something
While Mickey answers him offscreen, Dr
Abel turns and walks toward him
The camera follows the doctor's movements from the other side of the wall, obscuring him briefly
It moves across a dark examining-room wall to a second doorway, where Mickey sits on a stool, continuing to talk to the offscreen Dr
Abel
(onscreen) mean, 'm absolutely convinced that-that-- You know,  mean, it's not like that adenoidal thing, you know, where  didn't realize  had them out
Dr
Abel walks back onscreen
Both he and Mickey are now seen through the second doorway
Dr
Abel sniffs and stands directly in front of the sitting Mickey
He stares down at him as Mickey talks
(continuing, gesturing) So, so, but it was when  was younger, so-- (overlapping, interrupting) You know,  saw your father this week about his sinus
(folding his arms on his chest) Mm-hm
(continuing) and, uh, he complained of chest pains
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family mean, he's, you know, he's-- (interrupting) You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness
(rubbing his hands on his knees) Yes, a little dizziness, and think,  think 'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear (poking at his ears and gesturing) or my left ear, my, my left
oh, n-n-n-no
No, 'm sorry
It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear
Dr
Abel chuckles
(nodding and gesturing) Now  ca-can't remember
Let's take a look
An uptempo big-band sound is heard as the movie cuts to Mickey's examination, beginning with a close-up of Dr
Abel using an otoscope to examine the ear of a nervous Mickey
Next is a hearing test
The film shows the doctors's hands turning the dials on a sonometer
Mickey sits on a nearby high stool, large earphones on his head
He listens with such concentration that he squints his eyes
He holds up a finger in response to the sounds he hears in his headset
Finally, the film shows Dr
Abel hitting a large turning fork with his finger
He puts the vibrating fork to Mickey's ear
Mickey, looking up at the offscreen doctor's face, nods
The music stops as the film cuts back to Dr
Abel's consultation room
Dr
Abel walks from the examining room, through the consultation room, to a second examining room across the way
He talks to the offscreen Mickey as he walks
Well, 'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear
(offscreen) Really
Dr
Abel moves offscreen in the second examining room
The camera stays focused on the doorway to this room as the doctor and Mickey talk offscreen
(offscreen) Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus
(offscreen) No, -'ve been perfectly healthy
You know me
Dr
Abel briefly passes by the doorway
(offscreen) always, - always imagine that have things
(offscreen) When did you first notice this
(offscreen) Oh, uh, about a month ago
Wha- what do  have
Looking preoccupied, Dr
Abel walks back into the consultation room, holding Mickey's open file
He strides over to his desk, revealing a frightened Mickey, sitting in a chair opposite it
Still standing, the doctor leans over the desk, his back to the camera, and makes a few notes in the file
You've had some dizzy spells
(sighing) What about ringing and buzzing
Have you, uh, noticed any of that
(gesturing) Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, -- have, uh, buzzing and also ringing
Ringing and buzzing
Um, am  going deaf, or something
(making more notes in the file) And it's just in one ear
(picking at his fingers) Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears
Dr
Abel chuckles as he closes Mickey's file and straightens up
The camera looks past his back and shoulders to the anxious Mickey
(his face offscreen) What 'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital
'd like to have them run some tests
The hospital
What kind of tests
Dr
Abel lays his pen across Mickey's closed file
He walks around his desk and sits on its edge close to Mickey
(sighing) Now, don't get alarmed
These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than  can run here
(gesturing) mean, it's, it's nothing
(gesturing) Well, if it's nothing, then why do have to go into the hospital at all
mean, uh,  hear perfectly fine, so 'm, so 'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels
So , you know,  won't go to the opera
(sniffing) You know, there's no reason for panic
just want to rule out some things
Like what
(shaking his head) It's nothing
Will you trust me
: - Mickey stands in a telephone booth on a corner near Dr
Abel's office; he talks on the phone
It is raining
man and a woman holding an umbrella pass by; traffic moves across a nearby intersection
(into the telephone) Huh, uh, hello, Dr
Wilkes
Dr
Wilkes, this is Mickey Sachs
You have a minute
want to ask you a question
The film cuts to Dr
Wilkes, on the telephone at his end
He is in his office; he leans back in his chair, dangling his stethoscope as he speaks
Behind him, a chest -ray is mounted on a light panel
(into the telephone) Sure, Mickey
What's up
The movie cuts back and forth between Mickey in his phone booth asking questions and Dr
Wilkes in his office answering them
(into the telephone, gesturing) -if you have, i-if you have a hearing loss in one ear, and-and it's not from a, uh, virus or a loud noise or anything, wh-what are the possibilities
(into his telephone) Anything
Uh, often it's hereditary
Flu, uh, even a small noise will do it
(into the telephone) Uh, right, but-but nothing worse
(into the telephone) Well, yes,  guess the, uh, dark side of the spectrum is a brain tumor
(into the telephone, reacting with a blank stare) Really
: '  - Gail, wearing her glasses, stands behind a crowded but well- ordered desk
Two assistants, a man and a woman, stand around her
(handing them each some pages of script) Okay, so here's the new pages
(looking over the pages) Say, did cards get these
(scratching her head) No, not yet
No
(looking over his pages) Well, let's hope it's good
Yeah, really
Really
The assistants walk off
As they leave, Gail calls out after them
Eh, we'll be down in a minute, okay
The telephone starts to ring, Gail pauses, looking offscreen
She takes off her glasses and squints
Mickey, what's the matter with you
You're all white
The film cuts to Mickey, who is pacing and wringing his hands
He walks over to Gail
The phone continues to ring
feel dizzy
Sshh, you know, don't feel well
He starts to pant, looking worriedly around the room
He continues to wring his hands as Gail stares at him, concerned
Do you hear a ringing
Is there, is there a, is there a ringing sound
(sighing) (gesturing) Yeah
Yeah, yeah
hear,  hear it
She sits down and picks up the phone
(shaking his head) -n-no, not that
(overlapping, into the telephone) Hello
(covering first one ear, then the other, continuing) Like-- (putting a finger into his ear, closing his eyes and listening) (into the telephone) Uh, yeah, yeah
We're going to be working late tonight
-no, we'll order out
It's all right
Yeah
Gail hangs up the phone
(turning to Gail, gesturing nervously) Sssss, if  have a brain tumor, don't know what 'm gonna do
(sighing) You don't have a brain tumor
He didn't say you had a brain tumor
(sighing) No, naturally (gesturing) they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em
(pointing a finger at Mickey) But not you
(flinging up his arms, sighing) Oh, God
(looking around worriedly and touching Gail's shoulder) Do you hear a buzzing
Is there a buzzing
He pants and begins to pace around the room
The camera follows him as he walks away from Gail
(impatiently) Mickey, come on, we got a show to do
(pacing) can't keep my mind on the show
(offscreen) But there's nothing wrong with you
(sighing and gesturing) If there's nothing wrong with me (pacing back to the desk and Gail) then why does he want me to come back for tests
(gesturing) Well, he has to rule out certain things
(sighing) Like what
What
(shrugging) don't know
Cancer, -- (interrupting) Don't say that
don't want to hear that word
(gesturing) Don't mention that while 'm in the building
(gesturing) But you don't have any symptoms
(gesturing) You-- got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor
Mickey sighs
Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma
(gesturing) Naturally, , --Do you know --The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back
It was on your shirt
(sighing) --How was  to know
(pointing to his back) Everyone was pointing back here
He sighs again as Gail, frustrated, gestures impatiently to the papers on the desk
Come on, we've got to make some booking decisions
Mickey begins pacing around the room again
He wrings his hands and blows on them
can't
can't think of it
This morning,  was so happy, you know
Now ,  don't know what went wrong
(sighing) Eh, you were miserable this morning
We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious
(pacing back to the desk, still wringing his hands) No,  was happy, but  just didn't realize  was happy
: The Stanislavski Catering Company in action
Sophisticated pop music plays as the film cuts to: - An abstract painting on a wall fills the screen
Light laughter is heard, as well as the sophisticated music; offscreen brunch guests chatter indistinctly
(offscreen) These things are delicious
What in the world are they
Holly walks onto the screen in front of the painting
She holds an almost empty tray of hors d'oeuvres; she wears a uniform
Oh, um, those are quail eggs
(offscreen) Oh, they're very good
Holly walks past the painting towards the female brunch guest
man walks in front of her
Chatter, light laughter, and music are still heard; a party is in progress
(nodding) Yeah, my friend April makes those
(holding out the tray) Here, try the shrimp puffs
These are delicious
(taking one from the tray) Oh, thank you
That looks great
make those
Mmm
Thanks
Holly laughs lightly as she walks away from the woman
Holding her tray, she passes a large oval loft window and several clusters of brunch guests
They are eating and drinking
No one pays any attention to her
(to two male guests in her way) Excuse me
One of the men, murmuring his thanks, takes a last shrimp puff as Holly passes
(to the man) Thank you
Holly finally makes her way into the cluttered loft kitchen
Her tray is empty
(offscreen) The Stroganoff is ready
Holly, excited, runs over to April, who is busy taking the Stroganoff out of the oven
She wears the same uniform as Holly: black skirt, white shirt, and black bowtie
(animatedly) We're a big hit
Oh, in this we're a big hit
Yesterday  auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba
That,  wasn't such a big hit
April, holding the Stroganoff, dashes out of the kitchen to serve the party guests
Holly calls after her, offscreen, as David walks past the hurrying April into the kitchen
(offscreen) You will be
You will be
You'll get five jobs next week
David walks over to Holly, who is busy at the pot-and-pan- covered stove
(to Holly) Excuse me, are there any more claims
(gesturing at some canapes warming on the stove) Only a few
few
(chuckling as David takes one) Do you like 'em
can't resist
(busily working at the stove) Really
How flattering
Did you try the shrimp puffs
(eating a canape and pointing at Holly) Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers
Something's wrong
We're actresses
Is this your first job
(grabbing a quiche from an overhead stove) Really
Is the food that bad
(shaking his head) Oh no
Not at all
As Holly carries the quiche outside to the party, April comes back into the kitchen from another doorway
Music, as well as the chatter of mingling guests, is heard in the background
We need more bread and some baked lasa-- (realizing Holly isn't there and, at the same time, noticing David) uh, lasagne
(turning to David) Hi
(standing by the sink as he wipes his hands and mouth with a napkin) know
You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs
(working at the stove, pointing a finger for emphasis) Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's
do the, uh, crepes caviar
She walks past David to a counter where she begins to fold napkins
David leans back against the sink
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs
(turning to David and chuckling) Well, let's hope so
Holly enters the kitchen holding out a plate of clams
She walks over to David
Here,  stole you a couple of extra clams
(taking the plate) Ah
(looking busily around the room) Now
(overlapping, gesturing) Incidentally, 'm David Tolchin
(turning to David) Oh, uh, April Knox
Hi
They shake hands
(looking at her) Hi
(leaving the counter and squeezing past David and Holly) Oh
(overlapping, moving out of April's way) 'm sorry
April walks offscreen to another area of the kitchen
Holly picks up a napkin from the crowded table
(overlapping Holly's apology, turning to her) You're Holly
(nodding, looking at David as she wipes her hands with the napkin) Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company
(chewing on a clam canape) Now 'm going to tell you the truth
really came in here because  was bored stiff by the party
(laughing, still wiping her hands) What makes you think we're more interesting
David walks around the table, putting the plate of clams down on the already crowded surface
Holly follows him, chuckling, throwing her napkin into an offscreen garbage can as David stops at a small television set near the doorway
Guests in the other room can be seen chatting together in clusters
(turning on the set) Actually, 'm going to listen to Aida, if 'm not getting in your way
Canned laughter and miscellaneous chatter is heard from the television set
David watches the set, still munching on a clam, while Holly and April reassure him offscreen
(offscreen) No
no
No-- (sniffing) (offscreen, overlapping) Not at all
David checks his wristwatch as Holly walks over to him
(gesturing, fiddling with another napkin) We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and  cried
(nodding, his hand still on his watch as he looks at Holly) cry at the opera
(offscreen) Oh, -- go limp in the last scene in La Traviata
Limp
Holly chuckles as David, listening to April, impressed, walks over to her
She is standing by the table
(nodding, to April) Me, too
have a private box at the Met
(gesturing) bring my little bottle of wine, open it,  sit there and  watch and (glancing over to the offscreen Holly) cry
It's disgusting
April chuckles as Holly walks back onscreen; she is busy preparing another tray of hors d'oeuvres
(gesturing) Oh, what, what do you do
(nodding) 'm an architect
Wha-- (turning to glance at Holly) What kind of things do you build
Are you really interested
Yeah
(nodding) Yeah
What time do you get off
The three exchange glances
Holly shrugs
: - contemporary red building, designed by David, is seen, squeezed in between two older buildings
Holly, April, and David talk offscreen
(offscreen) Wow, it's the red one
(offscreen) Oh, it's magnificent
(offscreen) Yeah
(offscreen) It's terrific
The film moves down from the buildings to reveal the trio sitting in David's Jaguar across the street
David and April sit in the front seat; Holly sits scrunched up in back, her head slightly forward
(gesturing, looking back and forth from the buildings to Holly and April) The design's deliberately noncontextural
But  wanted to
keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions
(nodding) Uh-huh
And in the material
That's
that's unpolished red granite
(pausing as he watches Holly and April's reaction) Oh
(overlapping) Oh, is that what it is
(starting to speak) Uh-- (interrupting, nodding at Holly) -i-it has an o-organic quality, you know
(nodding, overlapping) Right
(looking back at the building with reverence) It's almost
almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what  mean
-
can't put it into words
The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes
(turning to April, emphatically) You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them
get the feeling you tune in to your environment
(shaking her head) Oh-- (interrupting, gesturing and nodding) Oh, it's really important
David turns and briefly glances at Holly; he then turns back to April
(looking only at David) What are your favorite buildings, David
You want to see some
(nodding) Oh, yeah
Well, let's do it
(looking at David) Great
David starts the car and the movie cuts to an unfolding visual excursion through New York City's landmark buildings, as seen from the trio's point of view in the moving Jaguar
Inspiring classical music plays in the background
The series of shots includes the Dakota, complete with surrounding winter trees, the Graybar building on Lexington Avenue, an incredibly ornate building on Seventh Avenue and Fifty-eighth Street, a red-stone church, an old building with embellished, bulging windows on West Forty-fourth Street, the Art Deco Chrysler Building, a red-brick building, Abigail Adams's old stone house, and the Pomander Walk nestled off Broadway on the Upper West Side
The group can be seen walking down the path between the old-fashioned row houses and shrubbery
lamppost sits in the foreground
It is now dark
The music continues to play as the film cuts to the facade of a rococo-style building, complete with French doors and ornate windows
The admiring group is heard offscreen
(offscreen) Oh, it's just so romantic
just want to put on a long gown
(offscreen, overlapping) Yes
(offscreen, continuing) and open the French doors and go on the balcony -- (offscreen, interrupting) It's French, though
It really is
(offscreen) Yeah
(offscreen, overlapping) It feels like you're in France
(offscreen, overlapping) It-it is
It's romantic
The music stops
The screen, which has been exploring the rococo building's facade, now shows the equally elegant building alongside it
(offscreen) And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it
(offscreen) Yeah
(offscreen, overlapping) They fit right in together
And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then
The film moves from the two elegant facade to show an ugly, ultra-modern structure covered with tiny, diamond-shaped motifs
(offscreen) That's just -- (offscreen, interrupting) Look at this
(offscreen) That's disgusting
(offscreen, continuing) a monstrosity
Who would do that
(offscreen, overlapping) It's really terrible
(offscreen, emphatically) It's really sad
(offscreen) And it ruins everything else
(offscreen, agreeing) It does
The film moves from the ugly facade to the building's equally ugly entrance
large car is parked right in front of the building
(offscreen) Well
we have seen a lot of stuff today, though
(offscreen, chuckling) Yeah
(offscreen, overlapping) Yeah
(offscreen, overlapping) lot of works
The group is now seen walking down the canopied entrance stairs of an apartment house on the other side of the street, where they'd been gazing at both the lovely and ugly facades across the way
David is in the lead; the women follow, Holly slightly behind April
(nodding) Yeah
(glancing at his watch) Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh
Fast
Oh, geez, yeah
(overlapped) Okay
They walk towards the car
(looking back at the women as he walks around the car to the driver's side) Uh, who gets dropped first
Uh -- (overlapping, looking at April) Oh, gee,  don't know
Um
(offscreen, overlapping) Well
(overlapping) Well,  live downtown
(glancing at April) Yeah, , we both live downtown
David leans over the roof of the car, looking at the women, waiting for their decision
(gesturing) Uh
(to David) It depends on what way you want to go
(overlapping) Well, wait
You know what
know
Uh
(to Holly, gesturing) If
well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah
(overlapping, nodding) We could
we could do that
(nodding) Right
Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it
She looks at David
(overlapping, to Holly) Well, sometimes, some, uh
(interrupting) mean, it's jammed
If we went
um
Both she and April mumble awkwardly
(pointing to Holly, interrupting their chatter) -you live in Chelsea, don't you
(nodding at David) Yes
Well, - guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first
(nodding nervously) Oh, okay
Yeah
And then, uh, April
huh
(overlapping, nodding) Great
They get into the car
Once again Holly's in the backseat
The classical music begins anew
The movie cuts briefly to cut to the traffic and lights of a Manhattan avenue as seen from the moving Jaguar
It then moves to a close-up of Holly, sitting in the backseat, her head near the window
She is staring straight ahead
(
) Naturally  get taken home first
Well, obviously he prefers April
Of course  was so tongue-tied all night
can't believe  said that about the Guggenheim
My stupid little roller-skating joke should never tell jokes
Mom can tell 'em and Hannah, but  kill 'em
(glaring at the offscreen April's back) Where did April come up with that stuff about Adolph Loos and terms like "organic form"
(looking out the side window, pausing for a moment) Well, naturally
She went to Brandeis
The movie cuts to Holly's point of view: the front seat where David and April sit, the Jaguar's windshield, and the passing lights and traffic of the street
Holly continues her ruminations as April leans over to say something to David
(
) But  don't think she knows what she's talking about
Could you believe the way she was calling him David
"Yes, David
feel that way, too, David
What a marvelous space, David
" (emphatically) hate April
She's pushy
The film moves back to Holly in the backseat, still lost in thought
(
) Now they'll dump me and she'll invite him up
blew it
(sighing, looking out the side window) And  really like him a lot
Oh, screw it
'm not gonna get all upset
've got reading to do tonight
You know, maybe 'll get into bed early
'll turn to a movie and take an extra Seconal
The classical music stops and some uptempo jazz begins
The screen cuts to black and a title appears
"
nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands
" : '  - The movie briefly holds on a ripped, red, paint-splattered door as Elliot, wearing a raincoat, appears nearby
He looks down the street and the film cuts to his point of view: Frederick's loft building
The movie goes back to the impatient Elliot; he's looking around him
He glances at his watch as the film cuts back once again to the loft building, where Lee finally appears, walking down the street away from Elliot
truck passes down the street
Lee doesn't see him
She walks further and further away; she turns a corner
Elliot frantically looks around again; then, in a burst of decision, he runs around a garbage dump, crossing the street, and still running, he moves down an adjacent street, past The Canal Lumber Company and several other buildings, as the film cuts back to Lee, walking down a different street, oblivious
The jazz plays on as the movie cuts back and forth between the fast-moving Elliot, rushing down the SoHo streets, past a truck waiting for a light to change, past some pedestrians, some garbage cans, turning corners, and the strolling Lee, walking up different streets, past different buildings
Lee eventually crosses a street, lost in thought, looking right and left, as Elliot, pretending nonchalance, waits on the corner, looking at his watch
She looks up in surprise; the music stops
(trying not to sound out of breath) Oh, my goodness
(overlapping, smiling in surprise) Oh, Elliot
Hi
(smiling) What are you doing here
(looking around, gesturing) Well, 'm-'m looking for a bookstore
(shaking her head) Oh, what, in this section of town
Yes
Yeah, -'m kill-- (overlapping) You're out looking here
(glancing at his watch again) Well, yes, 'm killing time have a client near here and
'm quite early
(laughing) Ohhhh
(gesturing) How about you
Oh
Well,  live-- (interrupting, chuckling) Oh, yes
You live near here, don't you
(overlapping, chuckling) Yes,  do
(putting his hands behind his back) Where are you headed
Oh,  was just going to my meeting
Oh, my goodness
Well, why do you still go to those
You never tough alcohol
They begin to walk down the street
(laughing) Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick
'd
'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and
go on
(looking at Lee) Oh
You must have been, uh, very unhappy
Yeah, unhappy and fat
(chuckling) And  still find the meetings very comforting, you know
She shrugs
'll never understand it
You're so bright and charming and beautiful
(laughing) Oh, God
(overlapping, chuckling) think to myself (laughing) what problems could she possibly have
(gesturing, laughing) Don't let me get started on my childhood
(stopping in her tracks, remembering) Oh, you know what
There is a bookstore
(stopping alongside her) Yes
(overlapping, pointing) couple of blocks from here
If you don't know about it, you should
You'd really love it
Yes
(nodding) Yeah, you would
(looking around for a moment, then gesturing to Lee) Well, i-if-if you have some free time
(nodding) Yeah, sure
(chuckling) Thank you
They begin to walk again as the movie cuts to the interior of the Pageant Book & Print Shop, an old, serious bookstore
nude print hangs at the end of one of the library shelf- like bookcases, which are packed, row after row, with books
An unseen Elliot and Lee carry on a conversation as the camera moves down an aisle, past the rows of books
piano playing "Bewitched" is heard
Pictures hang on the aisle ends of the shelves
(offscreen) Isn't this great
(chuckling) They have everything here
(offscreen, distracted) Yes, it's-it's wonderful
(offscreen) What book did you want to buy
(offscreen) What
Book
(offscreen) Your book
You wanted to buy a book
The camera moves past another aisle of books to reveal Lee, browsing through a shelf
(offscreen) Oh, book
Oh, no,
(laughing) 'm killing time
- just, uh, w-want to browse, uh
(looking up at a row of books) Well, you sure picked the right place
mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read
She walks down a center aisle, the camera still in its parallel aisle, following her
(offscreen) Unless, of course, if-if you had some time,  mean, we could get some coffee
No,  don't have time
Lee stops at the row where Elliot has been browsing
She is hidden by a shelf; only Elliot is seen as he talks to the offscreen Lee
(gesturing) No, no
-- understand completely
No problem
-you're busy
--
(offscreen, chuckling) You seem tense
Is everything all right
You feel okay
(overlapping) No
No
(offscreen) No
(gesturing, looking at books) Uh, yes
(offscreen) Yes
Elliot starts walking down the center aisle, in the same direction Lee had walked up
He continues to talk to her as she remains offscreen in a nearby row
(offscreen momentarily, hidden by a shelf as he talks) Yes
(offscreen) Everything's okay
(chuckling) Yeah
How are you
(offscreen) 'm
all right
(offscreen momentarily, hidden by another shelf as he walks) How-how's Frederick
Elliot stops walking to browse through some books
"Bewitched" still plays
(offscreen) Fine
Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met
It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick
mean
you learn so much
Do you like Caravaggio
(turning to talk to the offscreen Lee) Oh, yes
Who doesn't
(pointing) Look
Elliot turns and walks back down the center aisle to a row of books he'd already passed
(pointing to a book on a shelf, continuing) e
e
cummings
'd like to get you this
(offscreen, laughing) Oh, no,  can't let you get me that
That's too much
(pulling the book off the shelf and browsing through it) Oh, oh, yes
---'d like to, uh, uh, very much
(offscreen) No,  don't think so
(gesturing with the book, looking at the offscreen Lee) - read a poem of you and thought of his last week
(nervously laughing, trying to correct his mistake) poem of (laughing) his and thought of you last-- (laughing) You'll be fine, though
(chuckling) Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle
She looks at the book
(overlapping) Uh, uh, this is great
mean, love e
e
cummings, but  can't let you get this
(overlapping, patting the book) Yes, 'd
--'d love, 'd love to get you this
(looking down at the book) Well, sure
(overlapping) And-and maybe, um
maybe we could discuss it sometime
He hands Lee the book
She thumbs through it, as the movie cuts to: The street outside the bookstore
Lee, holding the book in a brown bag, and Elliot are walking out
(laughing, holding up the bag) Well, thanks a lot
(pointing to the bookstore) Thanks for showing me the bookstore
Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an  meeting sometime
Uh
uh, 'd love to see what goes on
(nodding) Well, yeah, yeah
You'd love it
It's really entertaining
You'd have a good time
(stepping closer to the curb and hailing a cab) know you would
(pointing to the book) And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve
It reminded me of you
taxi pulls over to the curb; they walk over to it
(laughing) Really
Well
Elliot opens the rear door for Lee
She laughs as she gets in
(leaning down to talk to Lee in the cab) Page a hundred and twelve
Bye
(closing the taxi door for Lee) Bye
He watches the taxi pull away
: '   - Lee, in slacks and shirt, is curled up on the bed, her back to the camera, as she reads the e
e
cummings poem in the glow of a night-table lamp
The piano music is still heard
(
) (reading) "your slightest look easily will unclose me though  have closed myself as fingers, you open always petal by petal myself
As Lee continues to read aloud, the movie cuts to Elliot's darkened den, lit by a light in the hallway
Elliot enters, wearing a robe, crossing the room in the dark
(
) (continuing reading) "
as Spring opens [touching skillfully, mysteriously] her first rose [i do not know what it is about you that closes and opens; only something in me understands the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses]
Elliot turns on a light
The camera stays on his face as he looks off into the distance, mouthing indistinctly the line of poetry Lee next reads
(
) (continuing reading) "nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands
" The film leaves Elliot's face and cuts back to the loft, where Lee, having finished the poem, sits up in the bed, staring pensively, lost in her thoughts
: The anxiety of the man in the booth
Upbeat jazz begins to play and the film cuts to: The facade of Mount Sinai Hospital
It is day
few cars whiz by as the film moves inside, to various scenes depicting Mickey's comprehensive exam
First is a hearing test, and the movie cuts to a darkened hearing-test room
light goes on, revealing a slouched- over Mickey sitting in a glass booth
He is wearing a set of headphones
The camera moves back, revealing a technician at the console on the other side of the booth
Mickey signals with his finger when he hears a sound on his headset
The jazz continues
Next is an electronystagmography ()
Graph paper rolls out of a machine, and after a brief glimpse of the rolling paper, the camera moves over to show Mickey lying terrified, without his glasses, on a couch, with electrodes stuck all over his head
The film then cuts to a  test room, where Mickey, sitting in a corner chair, wears another set of headphones
An electrode is attached to his forehead; a nearby technician sits at a computer video screen, looking at a monitoring graph
Last but not least is the tomography
Over the shoulders of a technician in a booth, a large window displays a huge, white rotating machine
It makes a whooshing noise as it turns
The camera moves down the giant cranelike device to reveal Mickey, once again lying down, this time on a table, his eyes closed, underneath it
: '  - sitting Dr
Grey, his back to the camera, is examining a group of -rays clipped to the light board behind his desk
wasn't too happy with the results of your  or your  either
The doctor turns his chair around to face a tense Mickey sitting on the other side of his desk
Uh, which is why  sent you to Tomography, which was all that stuff you saw rolling around
(pointing to a spot on one of the -rays) You see this little gray area here
Mickey stares at the -ray, horrified
That gray area's what  had hoped that we wouldn't run into
'd like you to come in Monday morning for, uh, a  scan
(reacting) brain scan
(gesturing) Mr
Sachs, let's take one step at a time
We won't make any decisions until we have all the information in front of us, all right
: - Mickey is seen leaving the hospital
He strides slowly, his shoulders slouched, his hands in his pockets
His voice is heard over the screen as he crosses the street, continuing his self-absorbed walk on the opposite side
Occasional traffic goes by
(
) Okay
take it easy
He didn't say you had anything
He just doesn't like the spot on your -ray, that's all
It doesn't mean you have anything
Don't jump to conclusions
(sighing) Nothing's gonna happen to you
You're in the middle of New York City
This is your town
You're surrounded by people and traffic and restaurants
Mickey brushes against a heavyset man who gives him a nasty look
Mickey is so dazed, he doesn't even notice
(
) mean, God, how can you, how can you just one day
vanish
Keep calm
You're gonna be okay
Don't panic
: ' /  - The dark bedroom is abruptly lit as Mickey, lying in his bed, wakes up with a start and turns on his night-table lamp
(
) 'm dying
'm dying
know it
There's a spot on my lungs
(sitting up, putting on his glasses) All right now, take it easy, will you
It's not on your lungs
It's on your ear
No, it's the same thing, isn't it
(pulling the sheets off and sitting on the edge of his bed) Oh, jeez,  can't sleep
Oh, God, there's a tumor in my head the size of a basketball
(putting on his slippers) -now  keep thinking  can feel it every time  blink
Oh, Jesus
He-he-he wants me to do a brain scan to confirm what he already suspects
Mickey, still ruminating, stands up
Fixing his pants, he walks out of his bedroom loft into a dark upper hallway
(
) (running his hand along a banister) Look
'll make a deal with God
Let it just be my ear, okay
'll go deaf
'll go deaf and blind in one eye maybe
But  don't want a brain operation
Once they go into my skull, 'll-'ll wind up like the guy with the, with the wool cap who delivers for the florist
He walks down a spiral staircase into the dark living room
(
) Oh, relax, will ya
Your whole life you run to doctors
The news is always fine
(pausing at the bottom of the stairs) That's not true
What about years ago
The film cuts to a flashback of Mickey's past
Dr
Smith, sitting behind his desk, faces the camera
Rows of periodicals line the wall behind him
(gesturing with one hand) 'm sorry to say, Mr
Sachs, that you cannot have children
The camera moves to Dr
Smith's point of view: Hannah and Mickey, sitting on the opposite side of the desk
They look stunned
(reacting, putting his hands across his chest) Gee
(reacting) Is there no chance
(getting up from his desk) Well, naturally, this doesn't mean that you can't have a normal sex life
(walking over to the opened office door and closing it) But Mr
Sachs's tests indicate that he is infertile
Small sperm volume and infertile
The camera moves back to the stunned Mickey and Hannah, following Dr
Smith with their eyes
(gesturing, looking up at an offscreen Dr
Smith) Isn't there anything  can do
Push-ups or hormones
(offscreen) 'm afraid not
Well,  gotta get a second opinion
(turning to Mickey) This is the second opinion
(shrugging) Well, then a third opinion
Dr
Smith walks back to his high-backed leather chair behind the desk and sits down
As he talks, the camera moves closer and closer to his face
realize this is a blow
My experience is that many very fine marriages become unstable and are destroyed by an inability to deal with this sort of problem
hope you won't make too much of it
One can adopt children, and there are various artificial methods of fertilization
: - Mickey and Hannah walk on the sidewalk, oblivious of the passing pedestrians
Hannah, crying, blows her nose
(gesturing) 'm so humiliated
don't know what to say
mean-- (interrupting, wiping her eyes with her tissue) Could you have ruined yourself somehow
(gesturing) How could  ruin myself
What do you mean, ruin myself
(overlapping, looking at Mickey) don't know
Excessive masturbation
Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies
Jesus
Hannah sobs, clutching her tissue to her face
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child
He said you could adopt one-- (interrupting) Well, what about artificial insemination
(gesturing) What are you talking about
(overlapping) You know, where -- would get implanted from a-a donor
(reacting) What, by a st-stranger
Deep in conversation, they cross a tree-lined street
They pass a yellow wood-frame house bordered by a wrought-iron fence
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen
(gesturing) Fro--
You want a-a defrosted kid
Is that your idea
want to experience childbirth
With a, with a stranger
With a-- (interrupting, sniffing) Just think about it
That's all ask
They walk offscreen and the film cuts to Hannah and Mickey's living room
The room is brightly lit; it's cluttered with pillows and plants
Norman and Carol, his wife, sit on the couch drinking coffee
(putting down her cup) Oh, that was a wonderful show think that's the best show you two ever wrote
(holding his cup, pointing emphatically) No, the funniest show that Mickey and  ever did was the one we won the Emmy for
Mickey walks from the kitchen into the living room, holding a half-eaten chocolate cake on a serving plate
The sun pours through the windows he passes
Hannah is briefly seen in the background, preparing more coffee in the kitchen
Yeah
- think as,  think as far as laughs,  mean just plain laughs, you know, that was probably the best thing that we ever did
Mickey puts the cake down on the coffee table, which is already crowded with assorted plants, plates, and a bamboo tray holding utensils and napkins
(agreeing) Mm-hm
(overlapping, her hands over her crossed knees and nodding) Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny
But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm
Mickey sighs and flops down on an adjoining couch
He rubs his forehead
(to Carol, gesturing with his cup) We got that idea on that trip to Paris
(nodding) Right
(smiling) Hmm
(to the offscreen Hannah) Do you remember that summer in France
Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks
Norman chuckles
(sighing, almost mumbling) Yeah, but it was, you know,  guess we had fun when we were there and, you know, it's just, -- (overlapping, nodding) Mm-hm
Hannah walks over to the group, holding a pot of coffee
She awkwardly steps past Mickey to pour coffee for Norman and Carol
(to Mickey) Sorry
(to Norman and Carol) Coffee
Listen, you guys, we were-- You want some more
(holding out his cup) Mmm
(refilling Norman's cup) We-we
we had something we-we really wanted to discuss with you
(overlapping, coughing) Yeah
Hannah refills Carol's cup
She puts the pot down on the coffee table and sits down next to Mickey
(standing up and gesturing) Jeez, this is, this is, this is very delicate and-and  only bring this up amongst friends, you know
He starts to pace
Hannah, her hands clasped near her face, glances briefly at Carol
(turning to the group as he paces behind the couch) mean
(grunting) this is, uh
this should not go any further than this room
(sipping his coffee) 'm all ears
Hannah sighs
Mickey pauses for a moment, collecting his thoughts
(gesturing and pacing) Hannah and
can't have any children
Now -- don't want to get into whose fault it-- (gesturing) It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to-- (interrupting, nervously picking at her fingers) -w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination
Mickey stops his pacing and looks at the group
(putting his hands on his hips) Yeah, 'm not so sure that , that like that idea myself, anyway-- He starts to pace behind the couch anew
(overlapping) Um, - didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor
(gesturing at Norman and Carol) - just, you know, -- wouldn't want that
(pacing) Right
We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and
Norman and Carol remain silent
And you can say no
you know
Feel free to say no
-we realize it has all kinds of implications
Mickey stops pacing and leans on the couch behind Norman
Yeah, but the-the point that, uh, that we're making here is that we need some sperm
Mickey, rubbing his hands on his knees, leans back against the wall
Norman and Carol turn to each other, reacting
(sighing) Gee
(chuckling) Well
My first reaction after the initial shock is, uh, flattered that you would ask me
(chuckling nervously) Carol glances at Norman
(pointing at himself) Yeah, well,  would be the father
(pointing to Norman) You would just have to masturbate into a little cup
(shrugging) can handle that
(scooting closer to Carol and Norman on the couch, gesturing) Obviously we wou-wouldn't have intercourse
She chuckles nervously
(to Hannah, chuckling nervously briefly) Gosh, listen
(rubbing her nose) 've gotta tell you the truth here
'm a little uneasy about this
(putting her hand on Carol's shoulder) Carol,  know it's a lot to ask
(gesturing) Well
feel for you
do
'm gonna cry
You want my husband to have a child with you
(gesturing) Ye-- -d-d-don't answer now
Just, you know, take it home and think about it for a while
(holding his coffee cup, thoughtful) gave blood before and, uh
clothing to the poor
(to Norman, scratching her ear) Okay, Norman, listen,  really want to talk about this at home
(nodding as Hannah looks briefly offscreen at Mickey) think it's a matter for your analyst
and mine
(emphatically) And maybe my lawyer
He takes a sip of coffee
(gesturing) You know, we-we understand completely if, you know, if you feel you'd-you'd rather not
(chuckling nervously) didn't mean to spoil the evening
(rubbing her hands) Now let's move on to another topic
Hannah reaches for the cake as Carol and Norman exchange glances, reacting
The flashback ends
Mickey is back in the present in his darkened living room, illuminated by a glow from a window behind the couch
coffee table sits in front of the couch
Papers are scattered on the floor
Mickey gets up from the couch where he'd been sitting
He paces back and forth as he talks over the screen
(
) So you had my ex-partner's baby
Twins
Maybe that did cause some trouble, but (sighing) think we were drifting apart anyhow
Now instead of man and wife we're just good friends
Boy, love is really unpredictable
: - Manon Lescaut is being performed
Onstage, the soprano in the title role sings a mournful aria as she kneels by the ruins of a wagon
The background is dark
The film moves up to the private boxes in the upper loge
David and Holly can be seen from a distance sitting in one of the boxes
David glances at her; he reaches down for a bottle of wine
The movie briefly cuts back to the stage
The soprano is leaning on a wagon wheel; her voice soars
Then it's back to a closer look at Holly and David in their box
The aria continues as David hands a smiling Holly a glass
He uncorks the wine and pours some in both their glasses
Holly mouths a thank you, glancing around
They look at each other and raise their glasses in a toast
: Dusty bought this huge house in Southampton
The opera audience is heard cheering, applauding, and sounding their "Bravos
" The clapping stops as the movie cuts to Frederick's loft
It is day
Lee, wearing a baggy plaid shirt and jeans, has opened the door for Elliot and his client, wealthy rock star Dusty Frye
(leading the way into the loft, gesturing) Lee, Frederick
say hello to Dusty Frye
Lee closes the door behind the men and walks over to Dusty
(shaking Dusty's hand) Hi, Dusty
Hi
Lee chuckles as she looks at him; he is wearing sunglasses, a red-imprinted -shirt, and a baggy coat
She turns and walks with Frederick, Elliot, and Dusty farther into the loft, her hands clasped behind her back
(as he walks) Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it
Yeah
It's kind of a weird place, actually
lotta wall space
(chuckling) Oh
They walk into the living room area of the loft, where Frederick, his hands in his pockets, neatly attired in vest sweater and white shirt, stands, waiting
(to Frederick, giving him a "hip" handshake) How ya doin', man
(to a less than enthusiastic Frederick) told him about your work, and he's very excited
Yeah,  got an Andy Warhol
And got a Frank Stella, too
Oh, it's very beautiful
(gesturing) Big, weird
you know
(chuckling as he crosses his arms on his chest) If you stare at that Stella too long, the colors just seem to float
It's kinda weird
Frederick covers his face to hide his disgust
(chuckling, her arms crossed) Are you excited about becoming a collector
Yeah
(nodding) Yeah
(shrugging) got a lot more to learn, though
really wasn't into art when  was a kid
(nodding) Uh-huh
(addressing but not looking at Dusty) Do you appreciate drawings
(shrugging) Yeah
(chuckling as he notices and points to some offscreen drawings Frederick has set up) Oh
Hey
Wow
(pointing to an offscreen nude drawing) She's beautiful
But, uh, really, --- need something
'm looking for something big
As Dusty talks, the camera follows Elliot, who walks past the others to examine the drawings more closely
Two framed nude drawings of Lee are propped up on an easel
Elliot glances admiringly at the drawings, then surreptitiously at Lee, admiring her body as she converses with an offscreen Dusty and Frederick
(looking at an offscreen Frederick, gesturing) Big
Frederick, show him the oils
(offscreen) They're in the basement
The camera leaves Elliot to follow the enthusiastic Lee as she takes Dusty by the arm and starts leading him to the door
Frederick follows at a distance
(to Dusty) Frederick's done this whole new series that 'm sure you would really love
(overlapping, muttering) Well, are
are they big
Yeah
Some of them
yeah, some of them are very big
'Cause  got a lot of wall space there
(chuckling) (angrily stopping in his tracks) don't sell my work by the yard
(chuckling, reacting) Oh, Frederick
The camera now moves back to Elliot, still staring at the nude drawings, as the sounds of Frederick's and Dusty's footsteps are heard leaving the loft
He turns and hesitantly smiles to an offscreen Lee
(chuckling softly) How's everything
(walking onscreen towards Elliot) Oh, you know
talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods
(nodding, her arms clasped around her chest) Oh, yeah
(chuckling) But  go nuts
It's a conflict
He laughs
Lee, uneasy, looks down
have to get my teeth cleaned this week
Oh, that's nice
There's an awkward moment of silence
(breaking the silence, pointing in the direction of the door) figured 'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together
(looking in the same direction, gesturing) Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you
Yes
This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars
(nodding, wrapping her arms around her chest again) Oh
He's got like six gold records
(gesturing, relieved that she's found something to say) Oh, speaking of records
bought that Mozart Trio you recommended
The camera follows Lee as she walks quickly to the stereo unit, pulling a record off the shelf
(continuing) and the man in the record shop showed me another one that  think you'd love
It's a
another Bach, second movement
She pulls the record out of its jacket and puts it on the turntable
(offscreen) Oh, you-you have that one
(working at the stereo, turning her head towards Elliot) Yeah
(offscreen) Oh,  would love to hear it
Bach's Concerto for Harpsichord fills the room
(putting the turntable cover in place) Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera
An architect
(offscreen) Oh, that's nice
'd love to see her wind up settled
She's a tense one
(chuckling) The record in place, Lee turns and leans back against the stereo unit
She listens to the music, her eyes closed
The record plays for a few moments in the quiet room, as Elliot walks over to Lee and leans against the shelf near her
(intently) Isn't that beautiful
(looking at Lee, his hands clasped in front of him) know this
Bach
Minor Concerto
It's one of my favorites
Lee, smiling, continues to listen to the music, her head down; Elliot stares at her
(after a pause) Uh
did you ever get around to e
e
cummings
(wrapping her arms around her chest and looking away from Elliot for a moment) Yes, he's just adorable
Elliot nods
(awkwardly) They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where  get my teeth cleaned, and
all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of
(taking a breath) Oh, right
There is another moment of silence
Elliot stares at Lee, who continues to look down, her arms around her chest
The harpsichord plays on
(softly) Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve
Yes, it made me cry (tentatively looking at Elliot) it was so beautiful
so romantic
Lee looks down again; the music plays softly and Elliot continues to stare at her, thinking
(
) want so badly to kiss her
Not here, you idiot
You've got to get her alone someplace
As Elliot's thoughts are heard over the scene, Lee glances around the loft, then begins to walk away
The camera follows her as she goes past the nude drawings, which become the focus of attention as Lee walks offscreen
(
) But 've got to proceed cautiously
This is a very delicate situation
Okay, uh
ask her if you can see her for lunch or a drink tomorrow
Lee walks back onscreen, to the bookshelf behind the drawings
She takes the e
e
cummings book from the shelf and flips through it as she walks back to Elliot, who is still leaning by the stereo, still ruminating
(
) And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive
This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically
(showing Elliot a poem in her book) Did you ever read this one--
Elliot leaps up, grabs Lee, and kisses her passionately
Lee, surprised, pushes him away
Elliot
Don't
Lee
Lee
Lee, 'm in love with you
He kisses Lee again
He clumsily turns around; she humps against the stereo unit
As Lee pulls away, she smashes into the turntable
The needle scratches loudly
Lee, shocked, is gasping
The record, pushed to a different part of the concerto, now plays a more complicated, faster fugue
(breathing hard) Oh
(gasping) What are you doing
(frantically) 'm-'m-'m-'m sorry
have to talk to you for
There's so much that  want to tell you
Lee stares at Elliot in shock
(still gasping) Elliot
(gesturing desperately) have been in love with you for so long
Frederick and Dusty's indistinct voices, raised in argument, are suddenly heard
Elliot quickly turns away from Lee
She tries to compose herself and the film cuts to the loft entranceway
Frederick enters the loft first, followed by a confused Dusty
They stride across the loft past Lee, who is standing by the stereo
Elliot, standing near the nude drawings, is looking through a book
(angrily) Please forget it
don't have any interest in selling anything
(gesturing) ask you if you have something with a little puce in it, you gotta fly off the handle
(in a slightly higher-pitched voice) What's the problem
(pulling the nude drawings off his easel angrily) 'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay
(overlapping, gesturing) Well,  can't commit to anything without consulting her first
That's what  have her for, okay
(carrying the drawings off) This is degrading
You don't buy paintings to blend in with the sofa
(looking after Frederick) It's not a sofa, it's an ottoman
(touching his forehead, turning to Elliot) God, forget it
Let's just get outta here, Elliot
(putting down the book) We'll go
The film moves outside the loft building
Dusty and Elliot emerge and walk to Dusty's waiting limousine
Elliot is rubbing his forehead, anguished
(angrily, getting into the car) What a weirdo that guy is
Paranoid
(noticing Elliot's anguished face) What's the matter with you
(gesturing) Look --'ll be okay
'll be okay
(overlapping) It's not that big a deal
We just didn't hit it off
(gesturing) Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead
Are you okay
You look-- You're sweatin'
(overlapping, nervously) Yeah
Yeah,  just-just need so- some-some fresh air
It's probably something  ate
'll-'ll walk
You go ahead
Dusty settles down in the backseat and closes the door
Elliot leans down to the chauffeur's window, signaling for him to start driving
(continuing, gesturing) You go
Go on
Go
The limousine drives off
Elliot runs to a phone booth across the street
He picks up the phone and dials
The film cuts to Frederick in his loft, standing near the phone
It rings
Frederick picks it up
(into the telephone) Hello
Hello
Hello
When no one answers, Frederick, reacting, hangs up, and the film moves back outside to the phone booth, where Elliot, the phone receiver to his ear, listens for a moment, then hangs up
He walks out of the booth, reacting, then walks down the sidewalk, where he bumps into a frantic Lee, just turning the corner
(gesturing in relief) Oh
There you are
Elliot mumbles, relieved and confused
was looking for you
(gesturing) ,  must apologize
-'m, -'m sorry
'm so mixed up
(gesturing) Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing
Elliot, uneasy, glances up in the direction of Frederick's loft
He leads Lee a few yards up the street, away from any prying eyes
(taking Lee's arm) Wh--, uh,  know,  know but,  am in love with you
Oh, don't say those words
(overlapping, shaking his head) -, 'm sorry
know it's terrible
(pushing back her hair, shaking her head hopelessly) Why, you know the situation
She sighs
(looking away for a moment) know
---,  realize
What do you expect me to say
Hannah and  are in the last stages
(shaking her head) Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close
She'd tell me such a thing
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad
She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, 've fallen out of love with her
Not because of me,  hope
Oh, no, no
(nodding) Well, yes
love you
Oh,  can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah
jus-- (overlapping, shaking his head) Oh, no, no, no
It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and part, anyway
Why
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons
(gesturing) But not over me
Tch, no
We were, we were both going in different directions
(looking down) Poor Hannah
But-but, but how about you
Do you, do you share any of my feelings
Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you
(reacting uneasily) can't say anything
-well, please be candid
, - don't want you to feel bad
(putting her hand to her head) Yes
But
have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right
Lee looks at him
(gesturing) -o-o-okay, Lee
Okay, okay
You, you, y-you've said enough
It's my responsibility now
will work things out
Look, don't do anything on my behalf
(shaking her head) live with Frederick, and Hannah and  are close
Yes, but you, you do care about me
(reacting) Oh, Elliot, please
can't be a party to this
'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street
She sighs
(emphatically) Your guilt is because you feel the same
(reacting) Oh, please,  have to go
have to get my teeth cleaned
She walks off
Elliot stares after her, grinning
(happily) have my answer
have my answer
'm walking on air
He laughs
: ' - taxi turns a West Side street corner and stops in front of Evan and Norma's building, which is decorated with a long metal awning
It's an overcast day
station wagon on the opposite side of the street pulls away as Hannah, a white scarf fluttering over her shoulder, gets out of the cab
She runs into the building; the taxi drives away
piano plays "Bewitched" over the screen
: '  - Evan, his back to the camera, walks to the front door and opens it to Hannah
(distracted) Hi
How's she doing
(overlapping) am glad to see you
Hannah takes off her shoulder bag and her coat as her aggravated father walks past her towards the kitchen
He passes a wall with an ornate mirror and some framed photographs
She's in the kitchen there
It's the same thing
Same thing
She promises, promises
(gesturing) But it's all lies
Through a doorway, Norma can be seen sitting on a chair in the kitchen
She wears a robe over a slip and stockings; she's drinking
Evan stands in the doorway looking at her; he doesn't go in
(offscreen, patiently) Don't make it worse, Dad
(overlapping) Always
Hannah hurriedly passes her father and enters the kitchen; her mother takes a sip of her drink
Hi, Mom
How you doing
Here, let me get you some coffee
That's enough of that
(taking away her mother's drink, to Evan) What triggered it
(gesturing, as Norma turns her head and watches him) We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman
Norma reacts, turning to her daughter
Hannah, however, has her back turned
She is busy taking charge in the kitchen as Evan speaks
She takes some pills out of a cupboard and hands them to her mother with a glass of water
(continuing) and your mother was throwing herself at him in a disgusting way, and when she found she was too old to seduce him, that he was just embarrassed by her-- (angrily interrupting, turning her head) Liar
Liar
The camera moves to Evan, who continues to tell his story, ignoring his wife's outburst, as he walks away from the kitchen doorway into the den
Then at lunch she got drunker and drunker (shouting over his shoulder) and finally she became Joan Collins
Evan walks over to the piano, where several framed family photographs sit in a line on its top
He picks one up as Norma speaks offscreen in the kitchen
(offscreen) All my life 've had to put up with insults
The camera moves back to the kitchen as Norma talks
She is still glaring offscreen at the doorway where Evan stood moments before
She holds the water glass and the pills
(continuing, dramatically) from this non-person, this, th- th-this haircut that passes for a man
(turning to look at the offscreen Hannah) He could never support us
It's a good thing we had a talented daughter
Evan is back in the doorway, listening to Norma, getting more and more angry
As he makes a retort, he starts to walk back to the den and his piano
can only hope that she was mine
With you as her mother (gesturing, his voice getting louder) her father could be anybody in Actors' Equity
She's talented
so it's not likely she's yours
(taking a sip of water) (walking over to the doorway to speak to Evan, who's already fuming in the den) Dad, could you just please stay in the other room and let me take care of her
Hannah goes back to Norma; she takes the glass of water away
(offscreen, choosing to ignore Hannah's suggestion) You never know when she's going to fall off the wagon and humiliate everybody
Hannah, choosing to ignore Evan's remark, hands her mother a cup of coffee; she puts her mother's hands on the cup
Here, Mom
Drink this
(leaning against a kitchen counter) You know, you're awful
You probably were flirting
(sipping her coffee) No
like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because get the attention
He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and 've tried to stay young
at heart
You promised to stay on the wagon
(shaking her head) The sacrifices 've made because of that man
(inhaling) He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his-- (gesturing) his-his-his-his mediocrity
Okay, stop being so dramatic
(shouting to the offscreen Evan) He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock
(quietly) Okay, okay
(touching Hannah's arm, gasping) Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test
(patiently) Yeah,  know, Mom
(gesturing) But ,  knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes
He's all show
(touching Hannah's arm again, then touching her chest) Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out
Norma sips her coffee, softly sobbing
Hannah, reacting, walks away from the counter and, capping the bottle of pills, puts them back in the cupboard
Evan plays the piano offscreen
The camera moves in on Hannah's face as she reflects, her voice heard over the screen
(
) She was so beautiful at one time, and he was so dashing
Both of them just full of promise and hopes that never materialized
The camera leaves Hannah's face as she continues to reflect; it moves to the den, to the row of family photos on the piano: one of a present-day Evan and Norma, others where both Norma and Evan are young, beautiful, hopeful
The music plays on
(
) And the fights and the constant infidelities to prove themselves
and blaming each other
It's s-sad
They loved the idea of having us kids, but raising us didn't interest them much
But it's impossible to hold it against them
They didn't know anything else
The film cuts back to the kitchen
Norma stands up; Hannah takes her coffee cup and sets it on the counter
You know, of all of us in the family, you were the one blessed with the true gift
She puts her arm around Hannah's shoulder
Mother and daughter walk out of the kitchen
(holding the hand her mother had placed on her shoulder) Ohhh, my true gift is luck, Mom
Norma chuckles
(overlapping) just had a lot of luck
from my first show, you know
've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark
(gesturing and chuckling) She knows it
She worships you
She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage
(looking at her mother) Now, Holly's not shy
They stop at the entrance to the den
Evan can be seen playing the piano as they continue their conversation
No, Holly's game for anything
Holly takes after me
True
(shaking her head) 'd have been a great dope addict
Norma chortles
Hannah laughs, touching her mother
They walk over to Evan at the piano
(looking up) Remember this, Hannah
Evan plays a few bars of "You Are Too Beautiful" as mother and daughter, their backs to the camera, listen
Norma leans over the piano; Hannah looks off into the distance, deep in reflection
The piano music continues in the background as the movie cuts to: Lee walking along a wharf by the waterfront
The wind blows her hair; she hugs the e
e
cummings book to her chest
She, too, is deep in thought
She stops at the edge of the wharf; the camera continues to move, to a group of wooden pilings nearby, lapped by the water
: The abyss
The piano piece ends and the film is quiet
: -  - The quiet continues as the film cuts to a close-up of a large, circular -scan module in an antiseptic hospital room
slowly moving stretcher, bearing Mickey's strapped prone body, begins to enter the round opening of the module
As the camera pulls back from Mickey, his taped head under the scan, two technicians can be seen through the window separating the scanner from the control room
One of them, sitting down, taps information into a computer while the other technician stands nearby, looking from Mickey to the computer screen
The movie then cuts briefly to the computer screen, showing an image of Mickey's skull
Scan lines bleep over the skull
The camera moves up from the screen to reveal Mickey once again, as seen through the window, silent and serious under the -scan module
From Mickey's prone form, the film moves to the two technicians, as seen through the window in the scanner room
They examine the computer screen and talk indistinctly to each other
One of the men, nodding, taps more information into the computer
While they're studying the -scan picture, the camera cuts to a back view of Mickey under the module
There is a science-fiction feel to this scene, as if Mickey is lying in the center of a huge, white, futuristic circle
The stretcher, bearing Mickey, slowly moves out of the module
: '  - Dr
Brooks, holding Mickey's -rays, walks past a row of bookshelves to his light panel
He props up the -rays
Mr
Sachs, (sighing) 'm afraid the news is not good
Dr
Brooks turns to an offscreen Mickey
(continuing, taking a pencil out of his pocket) If  can show you exactly where the tumor is, and why we feel that surgery would be of no use
The film quickly cuts to a close-up of Mickey's face, reacting in total despair
He closes his eyes; he covers his face with his hand
(
) It's over
'm face-to-face with eternity
(offscreen) grown quite large without being detected
(trailing off indistinctly as Mickey continues his anguished ramblings) (
) Not later, but now
'm so frightened  can't move, speak, or breathe
As Mickey finishes his speech, the "real" Dr
Brooks is seen walking into the office
The previous scene had been a figment of Mickey's imagination, a nightmare fantasy only
Holding Mickey's -rays, the "real" Dr
Brooks walks past the same row of books to the light panel
Well, you're just fine
There's absolutely nothing here at all
And your tests are all fine
(switching on the light on the panel and propping up the -rays) must admit,  was concerned, given your symptoms
(turning to look at the offscreen Mickey) What caused this hearing loss in one ear,  guess we'll never really know for sure
But whatever it was, it's certainly not anything serious at all
(nodding) 'm very relieved
: - Once again, Mickey is seen leaving the building, but this time he bounds down the steps, jumping for joy
He runs swirling down the street, clapping his hands, happy with relief
Upbeat, uptempo jazz plays in the background
Several cars pass as Mickey joyfully runs
Suddenly he stops, his hand to his mouth, reflecting
: '  - Gail sits in a chair in front of a bookshelf
sofa, a coffee table holding periodicals, and an endtable with a lamp complete the tableau
Gail's hands are clasped on her lap
What do you mean you're quitting
Why
The news is good
You don't have canc--the thing
Mickey, standing behind his desk, his back to the camera, his coat still on, looks out at the Manhattan skyline
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by
(offscreen) Mickey, you're off the hook
You should be celebrating
(walking around to the front of his desk, gesturing) Can you understand how meaningless everything is
Everything
'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show
the whole world, it's meaningless
(gesturing) Yeah
but you're not dying
No, 'm not dying now, but, but (gesturing) you know, when  ran out of the hospital, ,  was so thrilled because they told me  was going to be all right
And 'm running down the street, and suddenly  stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, 'm not going to go today
'm okay
'm not going to go tomorrow
(pointing) But eventually, 'm going to be in that position
Gail gets up from her chair
She walks past Mickey to a nearby cabinet
She opens a drawer, rummaging around for something
The camera follows her, leaving Mickey briefly
You're just realizing this now
(offscreen) Well,  don't realize it now, know it all the time, but, but managed to stick it in the back of my mind
As Mickey continues to talk offscreen, Gail closes the cabinet drawer and walks to a file cabinet behind Mickey's desk
because it-it's a very horrible thing to
think about
Gail opens the file cabinet and takes out a pack of gum
She slams it closed, distracted
(muttering) Yeah
What
(turning to Gail) Can  tell you something
Can tell you a secret
(nodding impatiently as she walks around the desk) Yes, please
(pointing) week ago,  bought a rifle
(sitting on the arm of a chair near Mickey) No
(overlapping, nodding and gesturing) went into a store,  bought a rifle
was gonna
You know, if they told me that  had a tumor, was going to kill myself
The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated
would,  woulda had to shoot them, also, first
And then,  have an aunt and uncle, would have
You know, it would have been a bloodbath
(shrugging, unwrapping a stick of gum) Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you
That makes everything
Gail sighs
She pops a piece of gum into her mouth as Mickey continues to speak
(continuing) you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything
(gesturing, pointing) mean, you're gonna die, 'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor
Everything
(chewing) know,  know, and your hamster
(nodding emphatically) Yes
(chewing and pointing to Mickey) Listen, kid,  think you snapped your cap
Mickey sighs
(continuing, chewing loudly) Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something
Or go to a whorehouse
No
(shaking his head, his hand to his chest) can't stay on this show
gotta get some answers
Otherwise (pausing and holding his head) 'm telling you, 'm going to do something drastic
: The entrance to the St
Regis Hotel, elegant and warmly lit in the night
Pedestrians pass
Baroque harpsichord music plays over the scene
The camera moves up the hotel's facade, past its welcoming flags, to its ornate windows several floors up
As the harpsichord continues to play, the film moves inside, to one of the hotel rooms
Elliot, his back to the camera, is opening the door to Lee
Elliot closes the door behind her as she enters
They stand very close to each other, framed by the door and a stark, subtly striped wallpapered wall
(looking intensely at Lee, his hands in his pockets) thought you weren't coming
almost didn't
(putting his hand on her shoulder, wanting to kiss her) Lee
uh
didn't sleep all night
(taking his hand away, gesturing to the room) No, no-no-no, 'm sure
They walk towards the camera, further into the room
Elliot puts his arm around Lee
What are we doing, meeting in a hotel room
It's terrible, isn't it
The music stops
The camera follows Lee as she walks towards the curtained windows, past a fireplace, a mirror, some innocuous pictures, a delicate table holding a lamp, the foot of the bed
(offscreen) - couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks
promised myself  wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone
was so torn when you called
She parts a corner of the curtains, looking out the window, turning when Elliot speaks
(offscreen) 've wanted to call you everyday since  first told you how  felt
He walks over to Lee by the curtained windows
resisted so many times
(pausing) Don't think badly of me
He takes Lee into his arms
This is not an easy situation
(whispering) know it isn't
They kiss, their figures almost silhouetted in the warm glow of the room
Elliot takes Lee's coat off without breaking the kiss
They embrace
They kiss each other lightly, then stronger, more passionately, their embrace much tighter
And it's later that night
The harpsichord music begins to play again as the camera moves over the bed covers to reveal Lee, lying contentedly under the sheets, her hair fanned out on the pillows, one arm near her head
That was just perfect
You've ruined me for anyone else
(offscreen) don't want anyone else ever to have you
(sighing) was so worried  wouldn't compare with Hannah
(offscreen, laughing) Oh, my God
He enters the screen, sitting down on the edge of the bed next to Lee
He holds a cigarette
You really do have those thoughts, don't you
(chuckling, touching Elliot's arm) Oh, all the time
Elliot chuckles; they hold hands
know she must be a really passionate person
(looking at their clasped hands) Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you
-- want to do things for you
Hannah doesn't need me as much
(chuckling as Lee laughs) 'm being presumptuous
Not that you need me
(nodding) want you to take care of me
And  love when you do things to me
Elliot leans down to Lee; they begin to kiss passionately
: '  - Lee walks along the sidewalk in the rain; she's bareheaded
The streets are dark
car drives by; a pedestrian passes holding an umbrella
Lee passes a restaurant well lit inside by hanging lamps
The baroque music continues as she enters the loft, her head soaked
She closes the door, touching her soaking hair
(offscreen) You're late
Lee walks through the loft's living room area, unbelting her coat, towards the bathroom
She passes Frederick, who sits at a table in the kitchen area, drinking a cup of coffee and reading the paper
plate with a half-eaten sandwich sits in front of him
The music stops
(opening the bathroom door) Lucy and  kept talking, and didn't realize how late it had gotten
(barely glancing up from his paper) You missed a very dull  show about Auschwitz
More gruesome film clips
and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions
As he talks, Lee is seen turning on the bathroom light
She takes off her coat, hanging it on a hook, then begins to dry her hair with a towel
(turning his head slightly in Lee's direction and gesturing) The reason why they could never answer the question "How could it possibly happen
" is that it's the wrong question
Given what people are, the question is (swallowing) "Why doesn't it happen more often
" Of course it does, in subtler forms
Frederick takes a bite of his sandwich and another sip of coffee as Lee walks out of the bathroom, tossing the towel down on the counter
(moving her fingers through her wet hair) have a little headache from this weather
She takes a kettle and fills it with water
(grunting, sipping his coffee) It's been ages since  sat in front of the
just changing channels to find something
As Frederick continues his monologue, Lee is busy in the background: striking a wooden match and lighting a burner on the stove for the kettle, taking a glass out of the cupboard, walking into the bathroom for some pills, filling the glass with water in the kitchen sink, and taking her pills
You see the whole culture
Nazis, deodorant salesman, wrestlers
beauty contests, the talk show
Can you imagine the level of a mind that watches wrestling
(gesturing) Hmm
But the worst are the fundamentalist preachers
third- rate con men, telling the poor suckers that watch them that they speak for Jesus
and to please send in money
(picking up his sandwich) Money, money, money
If Jesus came back, and saw what's going on in his name, he'd never stop throwing up
He takes a bite of his sandwich and a sip of coffee
Lee sets her glass on the kitchen counter and walks towards the bedroom area
(impatiently, her hands in her hair) Oh, God, Frederick, could you please lighten up
'm really not in the mood to hear a review of contemporary society again
She starts to take off her wet clothes by the bed
Frederick takes off his glasses
He turns and looks at Lee in surprise
(standing up from the table) You know, you've been very nervous lately
(sighing) can't take this anymore
(walking over to the bed) 'm just trying to complete an education  started on you five years ago
(unbuttoning her blouse) 'm not your pupil
(sighing, her hands at her side) was, but 'm not
(sitting down on the edge of the bed) When you leave the nest,  just want you to be ready to face the real world
He pulls Lee down next to him on the bed
(putting her hand on Frederick's leg) Frederick, we're going to have to make some changes
She sighs
(quickly looking at Lee, alarmed) Like what
Oh, you know what
'm suffocating
(turning away, his hands clasped in front of him) Oh
Are we going to have this conversation again
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again
have to leave
have to move out
(shaking his clasped hands intensely) Why
(sighing) Because  have to
(emotionally) What are you going to use for money
don't know
thought, maybe 'd move in with my parents for a while
Tch, oh
always told you you would leave me
(looking at Lee) But
does it have to be now
(hugging her arm with her other hand) Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but  ha-- have to try
(taking Lee's head in his hands and looking at her) Oh
Lee, you are my whole world
(pausing) Good God
Have you been kissed tonight
(reacting, pushing Frederick's hands from her face) No
(reacting) Oh, yes, you have
(quickly standing up, defensively) No
(raising his voice) You've been with someone
(overlapping, running away from the bed) Stop accusing me
Lee runs into the kitchen, her hands tight around her chest
(offscreen) 'm too smart, Lee
You can't fool me
You're turning all red
Lee, fraught with emotion, briefly puts her outstretched hands on the refrigerator door, then turns around and leans against it, hugging herself, her blouse still unbuttoned, her hair still wet and bedraggled
Leave me alone
Frederick enters the kitchen area and leans against the counter
(angrily) Oh, Christ
What's wrong with you
(leaning against the refrigerator, sighing) 'm sorry
Oh, couldn't you say something
You have to slither around behind my back
(overlapping, her voice emotionally raised) 'm saying it now
So you met somebody else
(sighing, nodding) Yeah
Frederick cringes, reacting
He puts his hand to his forehead; he sighs
(walking into the bathroom) But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later can't live like this
(turning to face Lee in the bathroom, his arms crossed) Who is it
(frantically putting things in her purse, glaring at Frederick) What's the difference
It's just somebody  met
But who
Where did you meet him
It doesn't make a difference have to move out
You are, you are my only connection to the world
Lee turns and faces Frederick in the bathroom doorway
(gesturing emotionally) Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me
It's not fair
want a less complicated life, Frederick
want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late
(reacting, his face in his hand) Jesus
Jesus
(gesturing, moving closer to Frederick) Oh, God,  don't even know what want
(sighing heavily, reacting) Oh
(rubbing Frederick's shoulder tenderly) Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway
mean
(laying her head against his shoulder, sighing deeply) it's not sexual anymore
It's certainly not intellectual mean, you're so superior to me in every way that-- Frederick furiously shakes Lee away
He pounds his fist against a cupboard
Lee, gasping, moves away
Please, don't patronize me
He puts his hand on his forehead, then turns to the offscreen Lee
God
should have married you years ago when you wanted to should have agreed
He walks over to Lee in another area of the kitchen
(sighing) Oh, God, don't you know it never would have worked
Frederick turns away from Lee
He begins to pace near the counter
told you, one day you would leave me
(leaning on the counter) for a younger man
-- He loudly pounds his fist on the counter in despair and frustration, then covers his eyes with his hands in sorrow
: '  - Hannah, wearing a plaid shirt, sits up in bed, a book propped up on her knees
cupboard with some bric-a-brac is mounted behind the night table, which holds a small, white, warm-glowing lamp and some photographs
She turns the page as Elliot, in pajamas and silk bathrobe, enters
She continues to read her book as he sits down at the edge of the bed and muses
His voice is heard over the screen
(
) What passion today with Lee
She's a volcano
It was a totally fulfilling experience
Just as dreamed it would be
(nodding slightly as he takes off his slippers) That's what it was
It was like living out a dream
a great dream
(taking off his bathrobe) Now  feel very good and cozy being here next to Hannah
There's something very lovely and real about Hannah
(tossing his bathrobe aside and lying down on the bed next to Hannah, his hands crossed over his stomach) She gives me a very deep feeling of being part of something
She's a wonderful woman
and  betrayed her
She came into my empty life and changed it
and  paid her back by banging her sister in a hotel room
God, 'm despicable
What a cruel and shallow thing to do
(sitting up) have to call her now and tell her what we did was crazy
(anxiously) It can't ever happen again
'm not that kind of man
and  value Hannah too much
love my wife
Now 've betrayed her
Oh, God
Elliot frantically stands up and leaves the room
(reading, not looking up) Where're you going
(offscreen) 've, uh
gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk
forgot to phone Mel Kaufman
(still reading) It's so late
(offscreen) Yeah,  know
- can't believe forgot
Elliot walks quickly into the darkened hallway
(muttering) What if he answers
(turning into the doorway leading to the living room) 'll hang up
(walking into the darkened living room) 'll tell her we can't communicate until  terminate my marriage
(whispering) It's immoral
Elliot switches on the light
He paces back and forth in front of the piano and an accompanying music stand
The top of the piano is filled with family photos; the lamp he turned on illuminates some framed pictures on the wall and the piece of sheet music open on the piano
(gesturing and whispering) Then, time will pass
won't call, and she'll get the idea gotta stop this before  get in too deep
'd rather hurt Lee a little, than destroy Hannah
Elliot stops pacing and checks his wristwatch
(whispering, rubbing his hands) It's one-thirty
She
she can't have a conversation with me
with him around
'm getting hysterical
(putting his hands on his hips) 'll call her first thing in the morning
'll call her at six
(pointing) Frederick goes jogging at six, yeah, she'll be alone
And 'll, 'll call her and nip it in the bud
The phone rings
Elliot jumps
(loudly, to the offscreen Hannah, gasping) 've got it
've got it
've got it
(picking up the phone, into the telephone) Hello
(loudly, for the offscreen Hannah's benefit) Mel
The movie cuts to Lee, standing in the dark in Frederick's loft
She talks softly into the telephone
(into the telephone) would have hung up if you hadn't answered and  promise  won't ever do this again, but  just had to tell you,  feel very close to you tonight
Very, very close
(pausing) Good night
Lee hangs up the phone and the movie cuts back to Elliot, standing in his living room
Stunned, he slowly lowers the phone receiver
: "The only absolute knowledge attainable by man is that life is meaningless
" - Tolstoy Jazz is heard as the movie cuts to the outside of a university library, the camera focused on a huge replica of Rodin's Thinker before moving to the front entrance
Mickey can be seen emerging from its depths
He wears his raincoat, his hands are in his pockets
He ponders the scene as he walks past the statue and a small front garden and down the sidewalk
Passersby, some holding books, are seen
(
) Millions of books written on every conceivable subject by all these great minds, and, and in the end, none of 'em knows anything more about the big questions of life than  do
Ss-- read Socrates
You know, n-n-n--, this guy used to kn-knock off little Greek boys
What the hell's he got to teach me
And, and Nietzsche with his, with his Theory of Eternal Recurrence
He said that the life we live, we're gonna live over and over again the exact same way for eternity
Great
That means , uh, 'll have to sit through the Ice Capades again
Tch
It's not worth it
The movie next cuts to a sunny day in Central Park
male jogger, seen through some tree branches, runs by
The camera moves past him, revealing a pondering Mickey walking by the reservoir
He continues to talk over the screen

) And, and Freud, another great pessimist
Jeez,  was in analysis for years
Nothing happened
My poor analyst got so frustrated
The guy finally put in a salad bar
Several joggers pass Mickey; he continues to ruminate
(
) Oh
Look at all these people jogging
trying to stave off the inevitable decay of the body
Boy (smacking his lips) it's so sad what people go through with their-their stationary bike and their exercise and their
(glancing at a fat woman jogger in a red sweatsuit who runs by) Oh
Look at this one
Poor thing
My God, she has to tote all that fat around
Maybe the poets are right
Maybe love is the only answer
Mickey goes over to the chain-link fence encircling the reservoir
He stops walking and looks out over the water
(
) Shh--Of course,  was in love with Hannah
That didn't work out too well
(sighing) even took her sister out
Remember that
Mickey continues to look through the fence at the water and the distant skyline
jogger crosses in front of him
It's very quiet; the soft jazz continues
(
) Remember years ago when Hannah and got divorced and she fixed me up with her sister Holly
The film cuts abruptly to Mickey's flashback of his date with Holly, beginning with a rock club performance
The soft jazz becomes loud, pulsating rock
Three punkers--a girl with pink hair, a girl with a spiked mohawk, and a guy with Stevie Wonder braids and sunglasses--watch and bop their heads to the sounds of the offscreen rock band, The 39 Steps
The camera moves to the stage, revealing a sleazy-looking rock band in the midst of their number
39 (singing) " want to be like you said 'm going to fit into your group
" As the band loudly plays on, the camera moves across the spellbound audience, sitting at crowded, smoky, small tables, to reveal a stricken Mickey and a mesmerized Holly squeezed together at one of them
nearby member of the audience swills beer from a bottle
Holly, beating time to the music and enjoying herself, takes a puff of her cigarette
She wears a wristful of silver bracelets
She glances at Mickey impatiently
He's the only one in the place wearing a suit
39 (singing) " don't wanna be different Said 'm gonna be just like you Because 'm gonna buy the records That they play on radio
Holly turns back to the band, who are still in full swing
The camera moves down the body of the lead singer, singing into a microphone, from his longish, curly red hair, through his cut-off red shirt and sweaty torso, to his guitar
He wears several silver bracelets on his wrists and gold bracelets on his upper arm
The microphone screeches feedback
39 (singing) "'m gonna dance at clubs Gonna do just what 'm told Because 'm bleedin' now And 'm bleedin' now wanna slip, slip, slip, slip, slip Into the crowd wanna slip, slip, slip, slip, slip Into the crowd
" The camera moves back to Holly and the even more stricken- looking Mickey
They are crowded in with people
In the background, a waitress holds up a tray
man drinks from a glass mug; people chatter indistinctly over the loud band
The club is noisy, smoky, and thick with people
Holly glances at Mickey once again, this time unable to contain her annoyance
Oh, why are you making those faces
(leaning over to Holly, gesturing) can't hear you
can't hear anything
'm, 'm, 'm, 'm gonna lose hearing in my ear
'm-- (interrupting, gesturing to the offscreen band) Listen, you are witnessing genius
(pointing to his ears) , , my ears are experiencing a meltdown
can't hear anything
(overlapping, gesturing dramatically) Look, can't you feel the energy
It's tangible energy
The room's alive with positive vibrations
She opens a vial of cocaine
(gesturing, trying to talk over the band) Holly, 'm frightened
'm--After they sing
they're gonna take hostages
Now let's-- Holly holds a short metal straw of cocaine to her nose and sniffs it
(panicking) Don't, no, please
Will you-- No, don't
(holding the straw towards Mickey) You want some
39 (singing in the background while Holly and Mickey talk) " want to dress like you Say, 'll buy all the clothes want to fuck like you Yeah, 'm sure it shows Because 'm
" (shaking his head) don't
No
No
(overlapping, sniffing) Come on, Mickey
Come on
(overlapping, gesturing) But, no, you've been doing that all night
You're gonna
you're gonna burn a hole in your
You're gonna develop a third nostril
Really, (putting his hand on Holly's shoulder) don't, please
While Mickey pleads with her, Holly puts her cocaine vial into her purse
She holds a finger against one nostril and sniffs
She then picks up her lit cigarette and continues to smoke
Can we, can we go
(looking at the offscreen hand, bopping her head to the music and smoking) No
(touching his ear in pain) My--uh
The camera leaves the crowded tables and moves back to the band
The lead singers continues to sing with his band, swaying his body to the music
39 (singing) "
Gonna buy the records That they play on the radio
" as the film cuts abruptly to outside the rock club
The music has stopped
Mickey and Holly, almost in dark silhouette, are walking at a fast clip along the sidewalk, arguing
They pass some lighted clothing store windows; a few cars go by in the dark street
(enthusiastically) love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials
(impatiently, with annoyance) Oh, well,  cannot communicate with you
, you know,  never realized you were such a tightass
can't understand you
Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music
don't know where you went, went wrong
(gesturing) Do you mind
'm-'m my own person
Can  take you someplace to hear something nice
(touching the hat on her head) Eh, Mickey, it's getting late
Now come on, you're be--, 'cause you're being angry at me
They stop briefly at a street corner and look for oncoming cars before crossing
Mickey takes Holly's arm as they walk across the street towards the camera
(angrily) 'm not angry
You know, you, well, you don't believe in , you don't like rock music, you won't get high
It's like 'm dating Cardinal Cooke
: - Bobby Short is playing "'m In Love Again" on the piano, accompanied by a bass player
An Art Deco mural fills the wall behind him
(singing) "Why am Just as reckless as a child
Why am Like a racehorse running wild
Why am In a state of ecstasy
The reason is 'cause something's Happened to me 'm in love again And the spring is comin'
" as the camera leaves the musicians and moves to the conversatively dressed audience
far cry from the rock club atmosphere, the Carlyle is quiet except for Bobby Short's singing
The audience at their tables watch him, some with smiles of pleasure
man has his arm around a woman
Jewels sparkle in another woman's hair
The men wear suits
Mickey and Holly sit at one of the tables; a candle burns in its holder on the tabletop
Holly takes a cigarette from her purse as she holds her hand to her nose, sniffing
Mickey keeps shooting glances at Holly; she can't sit still
Bobby Short continues to sing
(singing) "'m in love again Hear my heart strings strummin' 'm in love again And the hymn they're hummin' Is those cuddle-up huddle-up blues 'm in love again And  can't rise above it
" as Holly lights her cigarette, dropping her matchbook on the floor
She bends down to pick it up, then starts to fidget in her chair
She gulps her wine; she sniffs
Mickey tries to watch the offscreen Bobby Short; he crosses his arms across his chest
The film cuts back briefly to Bobby Short playing the piano
(singing, continuing) "'m in love again And  love, love, love it
" then abruptly cuts to: - taxi pulls away from the curb as Mickey and Holly walk out of the hotel through its revolving doors
Holly stays under the awning; Mickey walks to the curb and looks angrily back at her
People pass by as Mickey walks back and forth from the curb to Holly, growing angrier and angrier
Thanks for a swell time
(gesturing) Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing
was so bored
(gesturing) Yeah, that's tough
You don't deserve Cole Porter
You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother
At least 'm open to new concepts
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time
What do you, what do you do
Carry a kilo around in your purse
(gesturing) This crowd wouldn't know the difference
They're embalmed
Jesus
(waving his arm and whistling for a taxi) 'm glad Hannah got us together
You know, she's got a great instinct for people
Really
taxi pulls up to the curb
Mickey and Holly walk up to its rear door
Oh, look, 'm sorry it didn't work out
(overlapping) Yeah
Me, too
(overlapping) You know, it's probably my fault
've been a little depressed lately
(overlapping) Right
Yeah
had a
(overlapping) God
(continuing) had a great time tonight, really
It was like the Nuremberg Trials
He holds the door open for Holly
She gets in
(angrily) Oh, 'll see myself home
Holly slams the door
Mickey starts to walk along the sidewalk as the taxi drives off; he passes the hotel and several evening-lit store windows
"'m In Love Again" begins to play in the background as Mickey's voice is heard
(
) Yeah, it was quite an evening
Holly with her cocaine
(chuckling) She should have been wearing a gold shovel around her neck
Tch, she was polymorphously insensitive, think
(smacking his lips) Too bad, too
'cause, you know, always had a little crush on her
Both a bus and a taxi drive down the street, blocking Mickey from view
The music stops and the film cuts to: Afternoons
big-band rendition of "You Made Me Love You" begins as the film cuts to a hotel room
Elliot and Lee can be seen dancing cheek to cheek in the reflection of a mirror over a dresser
sits in the corner
lamp is on one side of the dresser; on the other side is a bucket with champagne
Two half-full glasses sit nearby
Elliot and Lee dance into view
Without missing a beat, Elliot picks up one of the glasses of champagne and hands it to Lee
She sips
Elliot sips, then puts it back down on the dresser
They embrace tightly, continuing to dance
: '   - Elliot, Hannah, and the twins sit at the dining room table
Christmas tree stands in the corner of the room, next to a table holding a lamp; a picture hangs on the wall
The family has just finished eating; the table is cluttered with the remains of dinner, including a quart of milk, some chocolate syrup, and a bottle of ketchup
Hannah's two adopted children stand by her chair; she is showing them how a small camera works
The children watch her, fascinated, muttering among themselves
Elliot looks listless
He stares blankly at the table
(to her adopted children, holding the camera) Oh, you just have to read the instructions
mean, you just set one of these things and you can take, you can take pictures underwater
1 (overlapping) Can  try it
(handing him the camera) Sure
Yeah
When we get to the country, we'll try it in the lake
The child takes the camera from Hannah, as well as picking up a second identical one from the table
1 Okay
(resting her chin in her hands) Okay
2 (overlapping) Can  go
1 (overlapping) Yeah
(nodding) Yeah
Okay
The adopted children leave, the twins going off with them
When they're gone, Hannah takes a sip of her coffee and looks at Elliot
She puts down her cup, still watching him
(after a beat) Are you in a bad mood
(shaking his head slightly) don't know
Um
'm just antsy
The camera moves in on their faces as they continue to speak
Family photos line the mantel behind Hannah's head
(intensely) Yes
know
The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself
And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me
(looking down at his hands) Was
Yes, you were
-and when , when brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat
(shaking his head) Well, - don't think it's a very good idea
Why not
(edgily) Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now
Why do you say that
Is there something wrong
don't know
Well, tell me
Should  be worried
But, you got four children
want one with you
Well
- think we should wait till things settle
But what do, what do you-- (stuttering) what's that mean
-w-we've been, we've been married for four years
How settled can things get
(gesturing) You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured
-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut
-it's all very
preconceived
(shaking her head) Yeah, but
uh-- thought you needed that
When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos
-- know, but there's got to be some give and take
Hannah sighs
Elliot angrily throws his napkin on the table
He stands up and begins to pace behind Hannah
Oh, let's not--,  don't know what the hell 'm talking about
(reacting) Are you angry with me
No
Do you feel, um
are you disenchanted with our marriage
(pointing at Hannah) didn't say that
Are you in love with someone else
(angrily) My God
Wha-what is this
The Gestapo
No
He sits down again, in a chair next to Hannah; the ketchup bottle sits in front of him
(turning to look at him) Well, what
What, wh-what are you not telling me
(gesturing and pointing) What kind of interrogation
Su- supposing  said yes
-- am disenchanted
am in love with someone else
Are you
(staring at Hannah for a beat before answering her) No
(gesturing) But you keep asking these, these awful questions
My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes
(gesturing) What, you, of c-- What are you talking about
Of course not
'd be destroyed
The camera moves in on Elliot's anguished face
He talks over the screen
(
) For Chrissakes, stop torturing her
Tell her you want out and get it over with
You're in love with her sister
You didn't do it on purpose
Be honest
It's always the best way
He looks down
Hannah leans over and tenderly puts her hand on his shoulder
(softly) Look, can  help you
If you're suffering over something, will you share it with me
She touches his hand; Elliot embraces her
Hannah, you know how much  love you
(kissing her on the forehead) ought to have my head examined
don't deserve you
Elliot kisses Hannah again; they embrace tightly
She touches his hair
: The audition
There is no music
: - The screen shows a metal staircase next to a large white column
Holly's voice can be heard as she and Hannah make their way up the stairs, moving into view
man carrying a shopping bag walks down the steps; he passes them
Hannah and Holly talk as they climb
(offscreen) You know,  just want to look so good, but  don't want to seem, you know, like 'm overdressed
(onscreen, walking up the stairs behind Hannah) You know what 'm saying
(overlapping, turning to look at Holly) Oh, no, not at all
(holding up a dress she's carrying on her arm) Well, how about this
(looking at the dress) Well, ,  really like that think that's a pretty color on you
(overlapping) Oh, yeah
(laughing) Hannah and Holly reach the top of the stairs
They walk onto a cavernous, high-tech floor
Empty bleachers line one wall; the rest of the floor is filled with racks of clothes and empty space
(continuing, smiling) Did you ever think you'd be helping me buy something to wear to the opera
(chuckling) (playfully hitting Holly's arm) Nuh-uh
but  think it's great can't wait to meet him
Holly follows Hannah to a rack of blouses
He's married
(interrupting, looking through the rack) Oh-oh
(overlapping) and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions
She's schizophrenic
Holly continues to talk as she follows Hannah across the floor to a rack of dresses
Hannah's on one side, flipping through the hangers
Holly, on the other side of the same rack, talks to her sister, not looking at the clothes
Sometimes she's terrific
(overlapping) Oooo
and then she just breaks down
(gesturing) And he has this sweet daughter
and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently mean
(overlapping, looking up at Holly) Oh
he's really paid his dues, but
then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so
Hannah takes a jacket on a hanger off the rack and looks at it
She holds it to her
(interrupting, glancing at her sister for a moment with amazement) You found all this, all this out on one date
(chuckling and nodding) Well,  think he was dying to open up
It's so sad
(finally looking back and forth along the rack) Now
what should  wear to my audition
Hannah turns to Holly with surprise
She puts the jacket back on the rack and stares at her; she inhales
(explaining) 've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical
(chuckling) Of course, 'll never get it
Singing
(chuckling) Yeah, can you believe it
(walking around the rack to Holly, still surprised) Really
(vulnerably) Well,  mean, why not
You know, wh-what have  got to lose
Uh
(overlapping, shaking her head) Well, no
- know,  just, uh
No, -, eh, you know, ,  didn't, didn't know you sung
Hannah begins to look at the rack of clothes on Holly's side, while her sister stares at her, frowning
(defensively) Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well
(gesturing, shaking her head) No
No, , eh, it's just that they sing
Holly is silent for a moment
Hannah takes a blouse off the rack and looks at it
Well
you know, uh
sing a little,  mean
(chuckling self-consciously) (realizing she's hurt Holly, reacting) Ohh
(overlapping, shaking her head) You know
(hanging the blouse back on the rack) know, no-- (chuckling) know
(overlapping, still chuckling self- consciously, gesturing) mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, -- (interrupting, touching her sister's shoulder) No, 'm sorry
No,  didn't mean that
No,  didn't mean that
The two sisters walk away from the rack, Hannah slightly in the lead
Behind them are some more racks of clothing and a large window with closed venetian blinds
(gesturing) Uh, you know,  think  can fake my way through a song
(nodding as she looks around the store, pulling up her shoulder bag strap) Uh-huh
Easily
Holly pauses, looking at her sister
They continue to walk
(looking at Hannah) -why
You don't think it's realistic
(putting her hand on Holly's shoulder) No,  didn't, , that's no
No, - -, no, - just
(gesturing) hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know
You know, you know how you take
(overlapping, nodding) Yeah
They walk over to a table laid out with colorful scarves and decorated with hurricane lamps bordering its edges
(continuing, looking at some clothes hanging beneath the table) every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a
a confirmation that you have no talent, or something
(overlapping, nodding) Yeah
Well, maybe 'll get it
(chuckling and gesturing) (overlapping, looking at the clothes) hope
Holly looks at her sister for a beat
(sighing) Boy, you really know how to cut me down
(looking at Holly, reacting) What
You don't, don't be so sensitive
Can't  say anything
(gesturing) Tch, well,  sing
(suddenly shouting) For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing
female customer, who'd come over to the table, browsing through the rack of clothes near Hannah, looks up, reacting
She walks away
(overlapping, reacting to her sister's outburst) Okay
(looking at her sister) Okay
-- What happened
You know, we were having a really nice time, a-and suddenly, everything went to bad feeling
She walks past Holly and briefly looks at a different rack of clothes beneath the table
(shaking her head) Nobody but you can do that to me
don't know why
(gesturing) Look, everything's going your way
She walks offscreen to a nearby rack; the camera remains focused on Holly
You're right
(pausing) 'm happy
(shrugging, looking at the offscreen Hannah) Why must  let my insecurities spoil everything
Holly chuckles and begins to look through the scarves on the table
: - group of theater executives, including the producer, the director, and two assistants, sit in a cluster in the empty audience, talking; they look up at the offscreen Holly, who is auditioning on the stage
She is singing "'m Old- Fashioned," accompanied by a piano
(offscreen, singing softly) "This year's fancies Are passing fancies
" The film moves from the audience to the stage where Holly, her hands clasped in front of her, continues to sing her song
large group of other hopefuls are seen in the background behind her
(continuing her singing, barely moving her body) "But sighing sighs Holding hands This my heart Understands 'm old-fashioned And  don't mind it It's how  want to be As long as you agree To stay old-fashioned with me
" The camera moves from Holly back to the executives in the audience
As it passes the empty audience seats, they are heard offscreen
(offscreen) Thank you
(offscreen) Thank you
(offscreen) It was very nice
#1 (offscreen, overlapping) Terrific
The camera has reached the executives in the audience
They are now chattering among themselves, Holly forgotten
(offscreen, overlapping the executives' chatter) April Knox
The film cuts back to the stage, where April, handling the audition pianist some sheet music, prepares herself to sing "The Way You Look Tonight
" The stage is very black, stark, except for April and the pianist
(singing) "Someday When 'm awfully low When the world is cold will get a glow Just thinking of you And the way you look Tonight
" : - theater marquee can be seen on the busy street as Holly and April walk down the street towards the camera, moving closer and closer as they talk
Workmen and various street noises can be heard indistinctly in the background
'm telling you, you sounded great
You, uh, you may be surprised
(sighing) Oh, 'm just glad we have a catering job this week
'm real low on money
Yeah, we have Mr
Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive
or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up
(reacting) What
(gesturing) Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera
(chuckling) didn't know what to say
(reacting) You're joking
No, he called late last night
(sadly) , uh, 'm very surprised
(chuckling, gesturing) He wants to take me to see Rigoletto
(looking briefly at April) And you, you-you're going
Well, -- didn't know what to say
First  said no, but then, he pressed it
He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me
(pausing) But 'm seeing him
(gesturing) know
said that, but
(shrugging) he said it was something he really felt like doing
(stopping and facing April) Gee, um
(looking off, sniffing) don't know what to say
Look, it's just an evening at the opera
Did , - do wrong in accepting
Holly looks away sadly; she shakes her head
(continuing) Huh
: The big leap
The film cuts to Father Flynn's rectory office
The Catholic priest looks out a simple stained-glass window, then turns to an offscreen Mickey
(gesturing) Now why do you think that you would like to convert to Catholicism
The camera moves back to reveal Mickey, his back to the camera, sitting in front of Father Flynn's desk
lamp is lit in the background; the Father's desk is neat
The room is comfortably decorated in wood and leather
Well, uh, because, y-you know, gotta have something to believe in, otherwise life is just meaningless
(pacing behind his desk and gesturing) understand
But why did you make the decision to choose the Catholic faith
The movie cuts to Mickey's face
He's very neat in a tie, sweater, and sports jacket
(gesturing) Tch
Well, y-you know
first of all, because it's a very beautiful religion
It's very well structured
Now 'm talking now, incidentally, about the-the, uh, against-school- prayer, pro-abortion, anti-nuclear wing
(offscreen) So at the moment you don't believe in God
The camera cuts back to Father Flynn, who walks over to a leather armchair next to a table set for tea
He begins to pour the tea into china cups
(offscreen) No
-a-and - want to
You know, 'm-'m willing to do anything
'll, you know, 'll dye Easter eggs if it works
(walking over to Father Flynn and sitting down in an adjacent chair) - need some evidence
gotta have some proof
Uh, you know, i- i-if  can't believe in God (gesturing, his raincoat in his lap) then  don't think life is worth living
(stopping his tea pouring) It means making a very big leap
Father Flynn clasps his hands in his lap
(nodding, fiddling with his raincoat) Yes, well, can-can you help me
The film abruptly cuts to the long hallway in Mickey's parents' apartment
In the foreground, a section of the living room can be seen, with a bureau holding a lamp and a framed photo
The hallway itself is crowded with pictures and a wall shelf
At the other end of the hallway, in the background, is another bureau, with candlesticks on top and a framed picture on the wall above
Mickey's mother stands in the front of this bureau at the hallway's end, screaming at the top of her lungs, holding her heart dramatically
(crying) Why
Oh, my God
She sobs hysterically, staggering offscreen to the bathroom; she shuts the door
Mickey walks into view, in the living room, looking after his shocked mother, who continues to cry over the scene
(overlapping and gesturing) don't understand
(turning to his offscreen father) thought that you would be happy
(offscreen) How can we be happy
His father walks into view, carrying a teacup and a candy dish
He strides past Mickey towards the kitchen
(following his father) Well, because  never thought of God in my life
Now 'm giving it serious thought
(offscreen, in the kitchen) But Catholicism
Why not your own people
(gesturing at the kitchen door to his offscreen father) Because  got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know
-b- b-but  need a dramatic change in my life
(offscreen) You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ
(gesturing) know it sounds funny, but 'm gonna try
(offscreen) But why
We raised you as a Jew
(shrugging) So, just 'cause  was born that way
You know, 'm old enough to make a mature decision
Mickey's father walks into view; he stands by the stove near the kitchen doorway, picking up a dirty glass and some bowls to clean
But why Jesus Christ
Why, for instance, shouldn't you become a Buddhist
Holding the dirty dishes in his hand, Mickey's father looks at his son
(gesturing) Bud--
That's totally alien to me
Look, you're getting on in years, right
Aren't you afraid of dying
Mickey's father walks offscreen again, to the kitchen sink
(offscreen) Why should  be afraid
(loudly gesturing) Oh
'Cause you won't exist
(offscreen) So
(gesturing) That thought doesn't terrify you
Mickey's father walks out of the kitchen, past his son, to the living room
(waving his arm) Who thinks about such nonsense
Now 'm alive
When 'm dead, 'll be dead
(following his father, gesturing) don't understand
Aren't you frightened
(offscreen) Of what
'll be unconscious
(turning and walking down the hallway) Yeah,  know
But never to exist again
(offscreen) How do you know
Well, it certainly doesn't look promising
Mickey stops at the bathroom door at the other end of the hallway
He starts to pound it
(offscreen) Who knows what'll be
Mickey's father comes back on screen; he's carrying a plate of hors d'oeuvres and an empty glass towards the kitchen
He stops and looks down the hall at Mickey, who's now struggling to open the bathroom door
(gesturing with his hands full) 'll either be unconscious or won't
If not, 'll deal with it then
'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when 'm unconscious
(pounding on the door) Mom, come out
(offscreen in the bathroom) Of course there's a God, you idiot
You don't believe in God
(sighing) But if there's a God, then wh-why is there so much evil in the world
(shrugging) What-- Just on a simplistic level
Why-why were there Nazis
(offscreen in the bathroom) Tell him, Max
Mickey, reacting, hits his forehead
(offscreen) How the hell do  know why there were Nazis
don't know how the can opener works
Mickey starts pounding the door again as the movie cuts to: beautiful snow-covered church downtown, complete with courtyard and wrought-iron fence
pedestrian walks by with an umbrella
church choir sings a soaring hymn over the scene
The music continues as the film moves inside, where the choir is seen singing behind an altar glowing warm gold fairly large congregation sits in darkened pews as the film cuts to the back, where Mickey, his arms crossed, stands underneath some stained-glass windows, watching and listening to the inspiring music
The choir continues to sing as the movie cuts to Father Flynn in his office
He picks up some large, heavy books from a shelf near his window and he walks over to Mickey, who's standing near his desk, already holding several tomes
Father Flynn puts the books on top of Mickey's pile; Mickey, flipping through the top one, awkwardly carries his bundle to the door
Next is seen a close-up of a painting of Jesus Christ on the cross, complete with crown of thorns and holy expression
His eyes, especially designed to blink as the lights hit them, open and close repeatedly
The hymn plays on, loudly, as the camera moves back, revealing Mickey, standing outside a barber shop window, looking at the Christ playing and shuffling from side to side to gets its eyes' 3- effect
Smaller inspirational pictures border the bigger, blinking Christ
barber pole with moving stripes stands nearby; passing traffic is reflected in the window
Mickey turns from the window, shrugging, and starts to walk down the street, past a fruit and vegetable store with open- air-displayed flowers, past several briskly moving pedestrians
With the hymn still playing, the screen goes black briefly
Mickey opens the door, the light from a hallway illuminating him
He's just entered his apartment
He closes the door and walks through his dark foyer; he carries a brown bag
He switches on the light, and walking past his spiral staircase, past several framed pictures on the wall, he makes his way to his living room coffee table
Mickey pulls a crucifix out of the bag; he looks at it, then puts it on the table near a pile of books and some objets d'art
He then takes out a copy of the New Testament, putting it on top of the crucifix
Then out comes a framed picture of a saint
It too gets put on the growing pile
But the bag is not yet empty
Next comes a large loaf of Wonder Bread and a large jar of Hellman's mayonnaise
Mickey sets them on top of the saint
: - Lee is walking down the street, looking around her
The sidewalk is fairly crowded with people; the sounds of traffic are heard
She passes some office buildings, a store's large display window; she stops when she sees Hannah
Her sister is waiting outside the Art Deco facade of a restaurant; she's looking in the opposite direction
Lee taps Hannah on the shoulder; Hannah, surprised, turns and gasps
(overlapping Hannah's gasp) Hi
The sisters laugh and embrace each other
Hi
Where's Holly
(overlapping) Hi
She's auditioning for a television commercial
She said she's gonna be a little late
(sighing) Oh, yeah
How's she doing
She turns and walks towards the restaurant entrance
(following Hannah through the restaurant's doors) Oh, God, you know Holly
When she's depressed, she's manic think it was a good idea that we invited her to lunch
They disappear inside
The camera follows them, cutting to the restaurant's interior at the same time the sisters walk in
It's a chic, trendy place, with an Art Deco design and high ceilings
waiter in uniform stands near its glass and metal doors, holding a tray to his chest; a few people sit at the bar; a large plant in a vase sits in the foreground
The sisters walk toward the coatcheck area, deep in conversation
(pulling off her scarf, still on the subject of Holly) hope you tell her it was your idea
Why
(overlapping) 'cause every time  try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive
(unbuttoning her coat) Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all
Hannah walks offscreen, farther into the coatcheck room
She talks offscreen as Lee alone is seen, reacting and speaking as well
In the background, a waiter crosses over to the bar, then walks away
(offscreen) So how are you
Oh, me, 'm okay
(offscreen) Do you miss Frederick
No
(offscreen) can't believe Elliot and  can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know-- (interrupting, her voice slightly higher-pitched as she takes off her coat) How are you
(offscreen) 'm okay
(overlapping) You know, how's everything
You doing okay
How's Frederick
(laughing) mean, Elliot
(offscreen, overlapping) -yeah
Hannah walks out of the coatcheck room without her coat; it's Lee's turn to disappear and check her things
Now only Hannah can be seen onscreen as the sisters talk
In the background, the waiter once again walks over to the bar
(continuing) Oh, he's fine
He's-he's,  guess he's fine
don't know
(shaking her head, her arms crossed) He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months
(offscreen, overlapping) Really
Yeah
- don't know what's wrong with him
He's just
kind of distant and difficult
(offscreen) Oh
(overlapping, gesturing) 've been trying to talk to him about it
He says everything's fine, but  don't know
Automatically, you know,  leap to the worst conclusions
(offscreen) Like what
As Hannah answers her sister, Holly can be seen entering the restaurant and walking over to the coatcheck area, an unlit cigarette in her mouth, her sunglasses still on her eyes
(gesturing) mean,  don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but
(walking back onscreen without her coat, reacting) Oh, no
mean, everyone thinks things like that
Hannah mumbles indistinctly as Holly walks over to her sisters
(turning, to Holly) Hey, hi
(overlapping) Well,  just came from an audition
(overlapping, leaning against the coatcheck wall) Hi
(continuing) which  did not get
(reacting) Awwww
(overlapping, sighing) So what's new
She takes off her gloves and scarf, stuffing them in her bag) (helping Holly with her coat) Boy-- (interrupting) They said  was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means
Oh, what do they know
Holly gives her coat to the coatcheck person
(to the checker) Thanks
(turning to her sisters) But guess who was there auditioning
April
The hostess appears, peeking around the corner of the coatcheck area
She signals for the three sisters to follow her
(reacting to Holly's news) Oh, gosh
You got it
Holly takes off her sunglasses; her cigarette still dangles from her mouth
Hannah murmurs her sympathy as the trio follows the hostess into the dining room
(gesturing) was very polite
maintained my poise
(taking out a match for her cigarette) said hello
The sisters walk to their seats, at a round table in the middle of the room; the hostess puts down their menus
Hmm
never trusted April, you know
She has eyes in the back of her head
They sit down
The hostess leaves
Other diners are seen in the background; a waiter is taking the order of a couple sitting on a banquette; other waiters clear off a table
Diners walk in and out
low murmur of conversation, as well as the faint clatter of dishes, is heard
The camera moves closer to the three sisters, circling the table as Holly speaks
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which still cannot believe
(overlapping) Hmm
Oh, God
(nodding her head, holding her cigarette) Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company
Which is why  have to speak to you
And
(gesturing to Hannah) you're gonna get impatient, but have to borrow some more money
(putting her cigarette in her mouth and picking up the matches) (shaking her head) Well, that
th-that's fine
(gesturing, her cigarette in one hand, her matches in the other) But what  decided to do is some writing
Yeah,  think 've had it with acting
You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls
And  can't handle another rejection
(emotionally) Now let's face it here
gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life
You know--something with a future
'm not sixteen anymore
(lighting her cigarette) It's just
crazy
(puffing her cigarette) 've got
an idea for a story
More than one
And  just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even
As the camera slowly circles the table, Hannah is seen listening to Holly, her hand on her mouth
've picked up a lot about dramatic structure from doing my scenes in acting class
Lee, her hand on her mouth, glances briefly at Hannah
As Hannah replies to Holly, the camera focuses on Lee's face
She bites her nails; she looks down, involved in her own thoughts
(offscreen) Well, that-that's good
It just, uh
it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively
(offscreen, the camera still focused on Lee) Well-well, like what
Lee looks up, her hand still on her mouth, watching Hannah, as the camera slowly moves off her to show Hannah
Well,  don't know
We'd uh, uh, um
Didn't Mom mention there was something
something at the Museum of Broadcasting
(offscreen) Yeah, that's clerical
No
She, didn't she say it was, um
she said it was in the publicity department
That-that can lead to other things
The camera is back on Lee
She looks around tensely, barely listening to the conversation
She fidgets
An empty table sits in the background
(offscreen) Boy,  knew you'd be discouraging
(offscreen) 'm not
'm not
'm trying to be helpful
person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now 'm finished as an actress
Now 'm a writer
"   mean-- (offscreen, interrupting) Yeah, you mean not at my age
(shaking her head, unable to take much more) Oh, please
We all came to have lunch, didn't we
(reacting, now in view) Yeah, okay, right
Forget it
(puffing on her cigarette) What's to eat
Holly abruptly picks up her menu
(trying to alleviate the tension) Boy
Holly
Holly
(overlapping) just want a salad
(to Hannah) You really think 'm a loser, don't you
(offscreen) What do--
You're being ridiculous
(overlapping, reacting) You are, Holly
Stop it
(to Hannah) You treat me like a loser
(offscreen) How
You never have any faith in my plans
You always undercut my enthusiasm
She puffs intensely on her cigarette as the camera slowly circles to Hannah's face
She is equally intense, looking at both sisters as she speaks
Not so
No
think 've been very supportive
've
try to give you honest, constructive advice
(offscreen) Hmm
(overlapping) 'm-'m always happy to help you financially
think 've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men
There's nothing  would-- (offscreen, interrupting) Uh, losers
All losers
You're too demanding
(offscreen) You know,  could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with
The camera, slowly circling the table, is back on Lee's face
While her sisters argue emotionally on her right and left, she is looking down, biting her lip
She is outwardly still, but her face is registering her seething emotions
(offscreen) You're crazy
That's not true
(offscreen) Hey, Hannah,  know 'm mediocre
(interrupting angrily, looking as if she's about to cry) Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah
(offscreen, overlapping) Oh, now-- (stuttering) (interrupting, shaking her head) She's going through a really rough time right now
(offscreen) Why are you so upset
(sobbing and gesturing) You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here
Now just leave her alone for a while
'm just suffocating
(sniffing back her tears) (leaning over to Lee, puzzled, reacting to her sister's tears) What's the matter with you, Lee
Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden
(offscreen) Look
(onscreen, as the camera circles around the table) Listen
Listen
(tapping Holly on her shoulder and gesturing) You want to write
Write
(offscreen, overlapping to Lee) What's the matter
(flinging her hands) Write
Let's just not talk about it anymore
(offscreen) Good
(shaking her head) Take
take a year
Take six months
Whatever you want
Who knows
Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play
She opens her menu, then turns to Lee, reacting suddenly to her sister, who is rubbing her forehead, looking terribly upset
(to Lee) What's the matter
What's the matter with you
(offscreen again as the camera circles back to Lee) You look pale
You okay
(overlapping, nodding and stuttering) 'm-'m okay
Yeah, --, you know,
'm just, um,  got dizzy all of a sudden
'm-'m
have a headache
(offscreen, overlapping) Yeah
(still rubbing her forehead, looking down at the menu) think we need to eat
: Summer in New York
piano plays "Bewitched" in the background as the film cuts to a large tree, covered with bright white blossoms
The camera moves down the tree to reveal a well-kept, red-brick brownstone on a pleasant, sunny New York City street
man wearing a summer suit walks by as the film moves inside the building, to Elliot's analyst's office
The psychotherapist sits in a comfortable armchair next to a curtained window
In front of the window sits a table covered with artifacts and a large lamp
The analyst's fingers are touching, his arms resting on the chair, as he listens to the offscreen Elliot
(offscreen) - can't seem to take action
'm-'m like, uh, Hamlet unable to kill his uncle
The music stops as the camera moves across the room to reveal Elliot, sitting in a wooden chair
He holds a long, thin cigarette; he wears a gold Rolex watch
He face is not yet seen
(face offscreen) want Lee, but  can't harm Hannah
And in no other area am  a procrastinator
Elliot raises his cigarette to take a drag
The camera follows the cigarette up to his face
Elliot looks thoughtful as the movie cuts to: - Lee, wearing jeans and carrying an armful of books, is running up a broad set of steps in the sunlight, greeting other students as she passes
Elliot continues to talk over the scene
(
) Meanwhile
Lee has no direction
She's taking courses at Columbia
but just randomly
as Lee stops on a portico and turns to greet Doug, a professor, who is running over to her, calling her name
They mouth hello, smiling, and begin to walk off together
(
) try not to call her, but then she calls me and then
call and
we try to resist meeting, but
once in a while we meet
Sometimes we argue because  can't break up my marriage
Sometimes we wind up making love and
we both feel terrible
The film cuts back to Elliot in his analyst's office
But it's my fault
Elliot takes a last drag on his cigarette
The camera follows his hand as he crushes it out in a nearby ashtray
(face offscreen) For all my education, accomplishments, and so-called wisdom
can't fathom my own heart
: - Hare Krishna music is heard over a sunlit view of the Manhattan skyline and the green trees of Central Park
The camera moves down to reveal a large group of Hare Krishnas dancing on the broad green lawn among other New Yorkers enjoying the day
The leader, holding some pamphlets, stands by a chain-link fence, a few feet away from his group, talking to someone on the other side
It's Mickey, as the camera soon shows, wearing a short-sleeved shirt, a paper tucked under his arm
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna
(gesturing, walking onscreen) Well, 'm not saying that  want to join or anything, but
but  know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me
Yeah, well, what's your religion
(gesturing) Well,  was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter  tried to become a Catholic and
it didn't work for me
- studied and tried and  gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know
And  just couldn't get with it
And , and  wanted to, you know
-- (interrupting) You're afraid of dying
(gesturing) Well
yeah, naturally
Aren't you
-- -let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would come back as a moose or an aardvark or something
(handing some Krishna literature over the fence to Mickey) Take our literature
(nodding, taking the material) Uh-huh
read it over, and think about it
(looking down at the material he's just received) Well, okay
Thank you very much
You're welcome
Hare Krishna
Mickey walks off, the Hare Krishnas still dancing and singing on the other side of the fence
He flips through the literature as he walks, then looks straight ahead, pondering
His voice is heard over the screen
(
) Who are you kidding
You're gonna be a Krishna
You're gonna shave your head and put on robes and dance around at airports
You'll look like Jerry Lewis
Oh, God, 'm so depressed
Mickey puts his hand to his mouth as another title appears on a black screen
Autumn chill
Bach's Concerto for Harpsichord is heard as the film cuts to the waterfront at dusk
bench faces some wharf pilings; the water gently laps against them as Lee walks into view, the wind blowing her hair
She stands and faces the water and the distant skyline across the bay
The view is contemplative, beautiful in the dim light
Lee is alone; her hands are in her pockets
Lee, thinking, is heard over the scene; the harpsichord music plays in the background
(
) The nights are really getting cooler
Summer went so quickly
Soon it'll be fall
(walking to the beach and sitting down) My literature professor really likes me
It was fun being out with him last night
(staring pensively at the water) Funny
feel like 'm betraying Elliot
but that's ridiculous
Why shouldn't  see Doug
Elliot's not free
(pausing) Just go one step at a time
Let's see what the next few months bring
The concerto stops and the movie cuts to Holly, leaning into an open phone booth near a subway entrance
She wears a football jacket, jeans, and sneakers; she holds a manuscript in her arms
It's a busy corner
People rush past Holly towards the subway; others are walking up the station steps
Holly smokes a cigarette as she talks on the phone to Hannah
(into the telephone) Hannah
Hi
Listen, um, you'll be happy to know that your money has not gone completely to waste
No, have an actual first rough draft of something  wrote
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, well,  showed it to Lee, and she gave me some good pointers
And, um, listen, 'm pretty near where you live
wonder if could just drop it off
and, you know, when you have time, some time, read it, an-and we'll talk when  come over at Thanksgiving
Okay
All right
Okay
Oh, wait, wait
(turning her body, still on the phone) Listen
Listen
think Lee met an interesting guy at Columbia
Yeah
Yeah, well, he sounds really nice
(puffing on her cigarette) Yeah
Okay
All right
Well, we'll talk at Thanksgiving
Bye-bye
Holly hangs up the phone and takes a drag on her cigarette
She looks off in the distance, smiling, as the film cuts to: '  -  - It's Thanksgiving at Hannah's once again
Guests are crowded together in the living room, surrounding the piano, where Evan is sitting and flipping through some sheet music
Norma stands behind him, leaning against a book-laden wall
The guests are chattering, enjoying themselves; a lamp glows on the corner of the piano
little boy sitting in a chair next to Evan is talking animatedly with a girl who is leaning over the arm of the sofa
An adult guest talks to the little boy; another guest takes a sip of wine from a glass she'd placed on the bookshelf behind her as Evan turns and addresses the group
(gesturing) Now, here
here's a song that Norma sang on that trip we made up to the show in Buffalo
And, oh, was she beautiful that night
The guests laugh appreciatively
woman comes over to Evan and hands him some wine
Come on
(laughing and touching Evan's shoulder) (overlapping, to the woman) Thank you, honey
(putting his drink down on the piano) Oh, yes, you were, dear
Don't you remember that night
(gesturing and pushing back some sheet music that was starting to fall) She was so beautiful
she was so beautiful that when men saw her walking along the streets, they'd drive their cars right up on the sidewalk
He laughs; the guests laugh with him
(looking back at Norma) Isn't that right, honey, eh
(tapping his shoulder) slight exaggeration
The guest continue to laugh; they are charmed
(overlapping Norma, laughing) know
(gesturing) But only slight
Evan continues to laugh with everyone as he starts to play the piano
nearby woman toasts him with her drink
The camera moves around the room as he plays, showing the various guests, chattering over the music
Some are in clusters, in private conversations; others listen and watch the offscreen Evan
couple stands by the window; one man gets up from his chair and walks away
Some guests sip their drinks, smiling, as the camera moves back to the piano and the book-laden wall
Evan is playing the piano with exuberance
Norma, still standing behind him, has a poignant, wistful expression on her face
She mouths the words to the song Evan is playing, "It Could Happen to You
" The woman next to her smiles, enjoying the music, as the camera continues its exploration, moving to a man standing in the doorway with a group of children
Mavis the maid walks by with a tray of hors d'oeuvres
The man takes one, mouthing his thanks, as the camera travels past the open bookshelf, past two boys in suits who are drinking soda and munching, to reveal Lee
She is leaning against another doorway, a faraway look on her face as she listens to the music
Mavis passes in the hall beyond the doorway
Several people, deep in conversation, stand nearby as Elliot, holding a drink, walks up behind her
(sipping his drink) You've been very cold to me tonight
(glancing back at Elliot, then turning away) No
Is something wrong
(turning) Oh, not here
(touching Elliot's arm) There are too many people around
Lee slips past Elliot and walks away
Elliot looks back at her briefly, then, sipping his drink, he turns and looks offscreen at the crowd in the living room
: '  - Holly is standing in the pantry, preparing some offscreen food
Near her is a restaurantlike swinging door with a glass porthole
In the foreground, the kitchen table is crowded with bowls and plates of food
An open cupboard separates Holly from the rest of the room
(looking offscreen) Hey, Hannah
You know,  think Lee is really serious about her new boyfriend
Yeah, eh, from what understand he sounds really nice
Hannah walks into view, headed for the refrigerator
She carries two tomatoes
'm so happy for her
think she's in love
Hannah opens the refrigerator, totally ignoring Holly
(reacting) Hey, what's the matter
(taking a bunch of celery out and slamming the refrigerator door) 'm real upset about what you wrote
Hannah walks over to the table, gathering up more food
My script
It's obviously based on Elliot and me
Oh, so loosely
(angrily) No, not "Oh, so loosely"
Real specifically
Is that how you see us
(shrugging, walking out of the pantry area) Well-- (interrupting) Can , can  not accept gestures and feelings from people
Do , do put people off
Holly walks over to the sink and washes her hands
(reacting) Well, it's a made-up story
She dries her hands as Hannah, her arms laden with vegetables, strides over to her sister
(yelling) No, it's real exact
The-the situations, the dialogue, everything
It's-it's full of intimate details between Elliot and me
Which  don't,  don't see how you could even possibly know about conversation we once had about adoption
Hannah storms out a nearby door as Holly turns away from the sink
(gesturing, the towel still in her hand, as she speaks to her offscreen sister) Well, Lee mentioned that to me, so obviously you discussed it with her
You
(pacing around the table) just took the essence and  blew it up into drama
Holly wipes her hand on the towel as Hannah reenters the kitchen, carrying even more vegetables
don't see how Lee could know about these things
don't don't tell her everything
Hannah strides into the pantry area and flops the vegetables down on the counter
Holly puts the dishtowel down and absently straightens some things on the food-laden table
(reacting) Wow,  guess  hit a nerve
(turning to look at Holly) You make it sound like, you know, have no needs or something
You think 'm too self-sufficient
(stopping her mindless straightening at the table, reacting) Now, Hannah, that's not what meant, you know
(walking offscreen to the sink area) Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much
"You're so giving
It's not a criticism
We love you
We're grateful
" (walking out of the pantry to the food- laden table) You're grateful, but you resent me
(offscreen) Oh, wow
don't want to have this conversation
didn't do anything wrong
Hannah angrily gathers up some spices from the table; Holly walks back onscreen holding a silver ice bucket
She stops at the corner of the table and faces Hannah
(onscreen) -you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems
(gesturing) Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business
which  don't see how you could know about in such detail
How does Lee know about these things
How
They're private
Hannah picks up a large bowl and carries it, as well as her armload of spices, into the pantry area
(turning to look at her sister as she walks past) Well, why don't you share them with us
(with her back to the camera) don't
don't want to bother everyone
(facing her sister's back) That's the point
'd like to be bothered
(turning to look at Holly) don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you
(shaking her head) No, he hasn't
If  offended you, 'm sorry
Hannah, reacting, puts the spices down on the pantry counter
Holly turns away
The film cuts to the dining room doorway
Guests can be seen mingling and talking and helping themselves at a buffet table in the living room
Lee and Elliot can be heard offscreen as the camera slowly moves from the doorway across the empty dining room to reveal them in the midst of an intense conversation
The piano, as well as soft chatter, is heard in the background
(offscreen) It's over, Elliot
don't know how to make it any clearer
It's over
can't see you anymore
(offscreen, overlapping) Uh
(onscreen, gesturing) -- know
deserve this
(touching her chest) Look, 'm just as much at fault
(overlapping, gesturing) If-if-if you can believe  have such feelings for you
've got to be honest with you met someone else
've met someone else
(turning and walking away from Elliot) told you  wasn't going to wait forever
Lee goes over to an open door and closes it quickly
(offscreen) But it hasn't been forever
(walking over to Lee at the just-closed door) (gesturing) It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which
now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know
(shaking his head) Yeah, but we-we made so many plans
(overlapping, gesturing) Yeah
Uh, well, sure we did
An- an-and in a way you led me on, because  truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah
Otherwise, would never have let myself be drawn in
was very weak
So were you
Now 've met someone else
The door opens and Mavis appears, holding a set of candlesticks
She walks over to the dining room table, which is already decked out with a floral centerpiece, glassware, and china
She puts them down as Lee and Elliot stand awkwardly near the door, waiting for her to leave
(to Mavis) Dinner soon
About fifteen minutes
(nodding) Uh-huh
Good
Mavis leaves
Both Lee and Elliot quickly close the door behind her and immediately pick up where they'd left off
And you're in love overnight
care a great deal about him, yes
(trying to put his arm around Lee) Lee
(pulling back, flinging her hands) Ah, it's over
Elliot,  mean it
It's over
They look at each other, reacting, as the film cuts back to Hannah's kitchen
Norma's face can be seen in the porthole window on the other side of the pantry's swinging door
She looks around the kitchen, then opens the door and steps inside
Holly stands nearby, working in the pantry area
(holding the door, half in and half out of the kitchen) Sweetheart,  loved your script thought it was so clever
(turning to Norma, smiling, and holding a glass of wine) Well, you're my mother
Not everybody's gonna be such a sucker
(gesturing) particularly liked the character of the mother
Just a boozy old flirt with a filthy mouth
Holly chuckles
'm so proud
Oh, Mom, thanks
Norma steps back out of the kitchen, the door swinging shut behind her
Holly looks at the door, sipping her wine, as the movie cuts back to Hannah's living room
chubby, friendly uncle sits on a sofa, one child on his lap and several others gathered cross-legged around him on the floor
They lean on the coffee table, which is covered with glasses and a bowl of chips
Other guests mingle in the background; one couple enters the living room, smiling at the scene on the sofa
Mavis crosses the well-lit foyer in the background and opens the door to more guests
The piano plays on
(raising his bottle of beer to the children) Now here's a toast to Thanksgiving, all right
The children mutter their enthusiastic agreement, picking up their "illicit" glasses of beer
Are we supposed to have beer
Yeeeah
The uncle pours more beer from his bottle into the kids' outstretched glasses
They cry indistinctly with excitement
(overlapping the children's squeals of delight) Let me at it
(to one of the little boys) How's that, Fletcher
Laughing, he turns to the little girl sitting on his lap; he clinks his bottle against the bottle she is holding, which is almost as big as she is
(to the little girl) Doll
To Thanksgiving
Here's a little toast, doll
(clinking glasses) Come on
Bottoms up
The uncle and the children happily drink their beer as the movie cuts to a wall with subtly patterned wallpaper in Hannah's bedroom
Her face moves on to the screen
(to the offscreen Elliot) Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us
About our-our personal life
(offscreen) Me
Of course not
There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so
personal they could only have come from you
(offscreen) Look, 've got a splitting headache and  don't like being accused
Hannah walks towards Elliot; he's in the bathroom standing over the sink
(gesturing) 'm not accusing
'm asking
Do you
do you find me too
too giving
(closing the door of the bathroom slightly so only she is seen on the screen) Too-too-too competent
Too-too, don't know, disgustingly perfect or something
No
Elliot walks from behind the partially closed door to an offscreen medicine cabinet
(following Elliot and gesturing, talking to his back) Well, what is it then
What
Eh, what's come between us
How have alienated you
(taking a bottle of aspirin from the cabinet and walking back to the sink, gesturing) Hannah, my head is throbbing
(gesturing) You never want to talk about it
-- Every time  bring it up, you- you change the subject
What is it
Do you-- We're communicating less and less
You sleep with me less and less
(angrily turning to Hannah and pointing as she shouts) Hannah,  am very mixed up
Now please
Elliot turns back to the sink, once again obscured by the partially closed door
(reacting, her voice trembling slightly, and gesturing) Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back
Do you
You must
They- they seem to know so much about us
(walking towards a towel rack and gesturing) Well, maybe 've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke
He dries his hands as Hannah, standing behind him, continues to talk
(gesturing) Well, what do you do
Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what
Do you, do you, do you phone them
(whirling around to face Hannah, snapping) Leave me alone, can you
He closes the door, briefly obscuring Hannah and himself from view
(continuing in a lower tone) Jesus, 've told you
need someone  can matter to
The camera moves behind the closed door, into the bathroom
(reacting, near tears) You matter to me
Completely
(pausing, his voice rising again) It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return
He opens the medicine cabinet and puts the aspirin bottle back
(gesturing, pleading) But, look
- have enormous needs
Elliot slams the medicine cabinet shut
(shouting) Well,  can't see them, and neither can Lee or Holly
He leaves
Hannah watches him go, reacting
She is stunned
: '   - The dark hallway is illuminated by light coming from the offscreen foyer; pictures line the wall
Piano music is still heard very softly in the background as Hannah, hugging herself, walks slowly down the hallway into the living room
She briefly looks around, lost in thought
She sits down heavily, tiredly, on the arm of the couch as the movie cuts to several framed photographs on the mantel
One shows Hannah and Elliot on their wedding day
Another shows Elliot, obscured in the shadows
Yet another has captured Norma as a young girl
The camera, however, moves closer and closer to a photograph showing Hannah, Lee, and Holly, the three sisters, smiling into the camera
There is no sound
: '  - The film shows the bedroom night table, holding a small lamp, a wooden box, a cast-iron fire truck, an ashtray, and glasses
Elliot's pajama-clad arm moves into view
He turns off the lamp; the room is now pitch-black
(offscreen) It's so pitch-black tonight feel lost
(offscreen) You're not lost
Elliot turns the lamp back on, then turns to Hannah; she is lying on her side of the bed, partially in shadow
He leans over and kisses her
love you so much
They begin to kiss passionately as "Bewitched" starts to play in the background
: Lucky  ran into you
"Bewitched" continues as the film cuts to a busy nighttime New York City street
Mickey, his hands in his pockets, walks along the sidewalk, one person among many other pedestrians
He pulls his coat tighter around him as he walks
"Bewitched" continues to play as he passes Tower Records' neon-lit window
He glances inside
and sees Holly, her jacket flung over her shoulders, looking at some records
Mickey walks through the revolving doors of Tower Records, up a few stairs to the selling floor proper, and stops right in front of Holly
(gesturing) Mmm,  don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together
(laughing, holding some records) remember you
(overlapping) Yes, you do recall, right
(overlapping, smiling and nodding) recall you
(gesturing) was walking past and  saw you in here
(overlapping, nodding) Yeah
and  thought 'd come in and
and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh
(interrupting, laughing and shaking her head) We didn't hit it off
(overlapping, smiling) Oh, that's putting it mildly
We did everything but exchange gunshots
How are you
Good
How are you
'm fine
(overlapping) You look wonderful
(chuckling, shaking her head) Oh, no
(overlapping, scratching his head) Yeah, really
You do
You do
Yeah
It was a terrible evening
Yeah, it was
(overlapping, gesturing) Remember slamming the cab door in my face and
(touching his nose as Holly laughs) you know, it came very dangerously close to emasculating my nose in a
(touching his nose again) (overlapping, laughing) 'd never do that
(continuing) in a really horrible way
(smiling, glancing away for a moment) Oh, well, that was a long time ago
(overlapping) You look wonderful
You do
What happened to you
(shrugging) People change
you know
(touching Holly's shoulder) Well,  hope you've changed
Yeah,  hope you have, too
(overlapping) hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired
(overlapping, shaking her head) Yeah, and for yours
'm sure you've changed
(continuing) namely a personality
Holly chuckles and turns to look at more records
She walks down the aisle, occasionally glancing at the bins of records
Mickey walks beside her
So how are you
(smiling) 'm okay
You didn't answer my question
What are you doing
Oh, nothing much
You know
(interrupting) Well
(overlapping) just some stuff
little of this, a little of that, that's all
(overlapping) Yeah
Is that an embarrassing question
Should  have not asked it
(laughing) Probably not
Are you, are you out of work or something
No, well
've been trying to write
Have you
(picking up a record and looking at it) Yeah
Well, that's interesting
Wh-what kind of stuff
(touching her chin for a moment) Oh
well, you-you're not interested in this
(overlapping) No, you can tell me
Come on
No,  am
am
(overlapping) Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey,  have something  just wrote," right
Nobody ever said it
Really
(overlapping) This is it
Yeah
This is really-- (interrupting, turning from the record bins to look at Mickey) Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it
Something
that  wrote
(nodding his head) Well, yes,  would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you don't know why it would
(laughing, touching her face) No, the reason  ask is-- (overlapping) You've always hated my taste in the past
(pulling her jacket off her shoulders) No,  haven't
You have
(gesturing, looking at Mickey) haven't
No, the reason why ask is  think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so-- (chuckling, gesturing) 'm not anymore
haven't, haven't been in television for a year
You're kidding me
(overlapping) 've done no television whatsoever
No
As Mickey continues to speak, Holly walks to another bin of records, reacting to his words
She looks offscreen at him, then down at some records
The camera follows her
(offscreen, continuing) may,  may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that 'm running out of dollars
But
but, um, no,  haven't, just sort of dropped out for a year
(overlapping, nodding) Oh
Oh
(offscreen, overlapping) which is a long, dull story and won't get into it
But-- Mickey walks back onscreen to Holly
The two of them are partially obscured by a large white Jazz sign imprinted with a large red circle as they continue their conversation
(interrupting) You're okay, though, huh
'm-- Yes
Yes, 'm fine
'm fine
How are you
(face offscreen, obscured by the sign) Oh, 'm fine
What
what about your script
(face offscreen obscured by the sign) So what's it about
(face offscreen) Well, 'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause  really would value your opinion
(face offscreen) You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing
They emerge from behind the Jazz sign, still walking, still talking
(smiling, gesturing) But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script
Well, it's not my first script
Hmm
(touching her face) Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh
Yeah
Hannah read it, she got really angry, and
you know, then  felt badly, so -- She picks up a record
(overlapping) Oh, well, God,  can imagine what you wrote
Oh, no
It wasn't anything bad
But she just
you know
don't know
Mickey pulls out a record and looks at it
Really
So, uh
threw it out, but  have this other one
Holly looks hopefully at Mickey
Well, you know, --
you know, if you want me to, 'll read it
(overlapping, gesturing) Oh, gosh,  don't know
(pausing) Well, could  come over tomorrow and read it to you
(chuckling) Come over tomorrow and read it to me
Holly laughs, embarrassed, as Mickey puts the record he's been looking at back in the bin
You must be joking
've been doing all my own reading since was forty
you know
(laughing, looking at Mickey) Hmm
think it's lucky  ran into you
(laughing) Maybe
(laughing) Well, what about me
(chuckling, waving her arm) Oh, well
(overlapping, gesturing) should have kept going
- have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation  should've kept walking and
Holly chuckles, looking off for a moment
(continuing, looking at Holly) and not begun this conversation
There is a brief pause and the movie cuts to: '  - The screen shows a chaise in Mickey's apartment; an ashtray on a stand sits nearby
The camera moves down the chaise, past several piles of books, to Mickey's coffee table
He sits, picking at his fingers and listening, on the edge of the table in front of Holly, who is sitting cross-legged on the floor, propped up with a pillow, reading her script aloud
(offscreen, as the camera moves across the room towards her and Mickey, reading) "We all go through life playing the hand we're dealt
Craig: And what hand were you dealt
(onscreen now) "Emily: 'm two high pair, maybe even aces up
The problem is, you've got three deuces
" Holly closes the script and looks up at Mickey
That's the end
Mickey smiles and shrugs, not knowing what to say
No, you can tell me straight
It's okay
Just, you know, tell me what you think
(shaking his head, shrugging) It's great
swea-- 'm-- 'm, tch, 'm speechless
was
was not in the mood to listen to this thing now
(sighing) don't know what to say
'm moved and  laughed and -- Uh, , you know,  was on the edge of my seat
just think it's wonderful
'm, 'm totally
stunned
This is not an insult
'm amazed that you can
(sighing) It was--  just thought it was great
(reacting) Really
(grunting and gesturing) Yes
was abso-- And
w- what
made you think of that climax scene where the, where the
architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death
(laughing and nodding) Oh, it just came to me one day
(gesturing) Well, it was just fabulous
'm, , you know
(gasping, hitting her forehead with her hand) Oh, gosh, you really think  can write
(gesturing) thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that  would do differently myself, but
(gasping and nodding) Right
(continuing) but who cares
It was just-- (gesturing) It was fabulous
(chuckling) Oh
(smiling and shaking his head) Fabulous,  mean it
'm so impressed
Holly, thrilled with Mickey's overwhelming response, stands up, her hand on her head
Unable to contain herself, she begins to walk up and down the room, holding her script
The camera follows her; Mickey is now offscreen
(laughing) Oh, God
(offscreen, overlapping) am
You-you made my day
(gasping) Oh, wow
(offscreen) It was just great
Uh,  was all set
was set to be bored stiff
(grinning, looking at the offscreen Mickey) Uh, gee
Would you like to have lunch
Uh, uh
(offscreen) - would love to talk to you about, uh, that script
-, you know,  think maybe that we could do something with it
(nodding) Okay, and listen,  would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life
(offscreen) Oh, who cares
(gesturing) -you used to-- Oh, no
Yeah, care
You used to be so ambitious and
(pausing, grinning) God, you really liked it
"You Made Me Love You" starts to play as the movie cuts to the street outside Mickey's apartment house, an old building complete with a red entrance door and a gray, weather-beaten facade
Trees line the sidewalk
Holly and Mickey emerge from the door and walk up the street, revealing a whole row of similar apartment buildings
They pass a few other people as they walk
The film then moves to the outside of a charming glass and stainedwood cafe
Through the window, Holly and Mickey can be seen having lunch
Holly is talking animatedly; Mickey takes a sip of coffee
Some people pass by
Next, the film cuts to an almost isolated path in Central Park, complete, with old-fashioned streetlamps and scattered leaves
Holly and Mickey stroll into view, deep in conversation
(gesturing) Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that
-how did you get over it
mean, when ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine
Well, you seem fine now
Well
(chuckling) 'll tell you
(sighing) One day about a month ago
The film abruptly cuts to Mickey's flashback, a visual counterpoint to the story he is telling Holly
close-up of a nervous, perspiring, and panting Mickey alone in his apartment appears on the screen as his voice is heard
(
) really hit bottom
You know, just felt that in a Godless universe,  didn't want to go on living
Now  happen to own this rifle
(coughing) Mickey raises the barrel of a rifle to his forehead
He shuts his eyes tightly
(
) which  loaded, believe it or not, and pressed it to my forehead
And  remember thinking, at the time, 'm gonna kill myself
Then thought
what if 'm wrong
What if there is a God
mean, after all, nobody really knows that
The camera moves past the desperate Mickey to a mirror on the wall behind him
Its reflection shows his spiral staircase and some standing lamps
clock faintly ticks
(
) But then  thought, no
You know, maybe is not good enough
want certainty or nothing
And remember very clearly the clock was ticking, and  was sitting there frozen, with the gun to my head, debating whether to shoot
The gun goes off with a loud bang
The mirror shatters
(
) All of a sudden, the gun went off
Mickey, holding the rifle, is seen running over to the shattered mirror
The sounds of his excited neighbors, their shouting, a knocking door, are heard as he continues his tale
(
) had been so tense, my finger had squeezed the trigger inadvertently
#1 (offscreen, overlapping) What's happening
Wh-wh-what's going on
(
) (continuing) but  was perspiring so much, the gun had slid off my forehead and missed me
#2 (offscreen, overlapping) don't know
heard a gun
Is everything all right
Mickey, still brandishing the rifle, runs into his sunlit living room
He looks around frantically, his shirt loose
Finally, he throws the rifle down between the sofa and the coffee table
The gun goes off a second time
Mickey, standing nearby, jumps, his hands flying to his head
The doorbell rings; the neighbors begin pounding at the door
(
) And suddenly, neighbors were, were, pounding on the door, and-and don't know, the whole scene was just pandemonium
And, uh, you know, and ---- ran to the door
Mickey runs offscreen briefly to answer the door
(
) --- didn't know what to say
You know,  was,  was embarrassed and confused, and my-my-my mind was r-r-racing a mile a minute
He returns onscreen, panting; he looks frantically once again around the living room
(
) and - jus knew one thing
The film cuts to a West Side street
It's an overcast day
Mickey, walking slowly along the sidewalk, passes several other pedestrians and numerous storefronts, including Klein's Pharmacy and a "Bar--" take out
Occasionally, he is obscured by a tree trunk on the opposite side of the street; a few taxis go by as he talks over the scene
(
) --- had to get out of that house
had to just get out in the fresh air and-and clear my head
And  remember very clearly walked the streets
walked and walked
- didn't know what was going through my mind
It all seemed so violent and un-unreal to me
And  wandered
The movie cuts to the exterior of the Metro movie theater, with its smoked glass entrance doors and its Art Deco feel
An old publicity photo hangs inside
Mickey's reflection is seen at the almost-transparent doors, as well as the reflection of the street and various cars whizzing by
His reflection walks towards the theater entrance; he continues his story
(
) for a long time on the Upper West Side, you know, an-and it must have been hours
You know, my, my feet hurt
My head was, was pounding, and, and  had to sit down
went into a movie house
- didn't know what was playing or anything
Mickey walks into the movie house
He is seen through the glass doors, which still reflect the street and traffic outside
He makes his way through the lobby into the actual theater
(
) just,  just needed a moment to gather my thoughts and, and be logical, and, and put the world back into rational perspective
The film abruptly cuts to the theater's black-and-white screen, where the Marx Brothers, in Duck Soup, play the helmets of several soldiers standing in a line like a live xylophone
The sounds of the "xylophone" are heard as the movie cuts to the darkened theater, where Mickey slowly sits down in a balcony seat
The "xylophone" music stops and changes to "Hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-ho" as sung by the Marx Brothers and ensemble in the movie
The singing continues faintly in the background as Mickey continues his tale: (
) And  went upstairs to the balcony, and  sat down (sighing) and, you know, the movie was a-a-a film that 'd seen many times in my life since  was a kid, an-and always u-uh, loved it
And, you know, 'm, 'm watching these people up on the screen, and started getting hooked o-on the film, you know
The film cuts back to the black-and-white movie screen as Mickey continues to talk
The Marx Brothers, as well as the hundred-odd other cast members in Duck Soup, are kneeling and bowing as they sing "Hidee-hidee-ho
" They kick their heels up in the air
They sway back and forth, hands clasped, singing "Oh-h-h-h-h-h
" (
) And  started to feel how can you even think of killing yourself
mean, isn't it so stupid mean, l-look at all the people up there on the screen
You know, they're real funny, and, and what if the worst is true
The movie cuts back to Mickey, sitting almost obscured in the dark theater
The Oh-h-h-h-h-h's coming from the offscreen movie are heard as he continues to speak
(
) What if there's no God, and you only go around once and that's it
Well, you know, don't you want to be part of the experience
You know, what the hell, it-i-it's not all a drag
And 'm thinking to myself, geez,  should stop ruining my life
As Mickey talks, the film cuts back to the antics of the Marx Brothers on the black-and-white theater screen
The four brothers are now swaying and singing and strutting, their voices indistinct over Mickey's narration
(
) searching for answers 'm never gonna get, and just enjoy it while it lasts
And
you know
The film is back on Mickey's dark form in the audience
(
) after, who knows
mean, you know, maybe there is something
Nobody really knows
know, know "maybe" is a very slim reed to hang your whole life on, but that's the best we have
And
then, started to sit back, and  actually began to enjoy myself
As Mickey continues, the film cuts back to Duck Soup on the black-and-white screen
The Marx Brothers are sitting on a judge's bench, playing banjos and singing with the other cast members
They jump down from the bench, still singing
Their voices swell
& "Oh, Freedonia Oh, don't you cry for me They'll be coming around the mountain
" The Marx Brothers kneel, strumming their banjos, and the movie cuts back to Central Park
The flashback is over
Mickey and Holly continue their stroll as "You Made Me Love You" begins to play in the background
They pass some people, a cluster of buildings that look like castles, and the Manhattan skyline as seen through the trees, as the camera moves back, farther and farther away from them, showing a beautiful Central Park, frozen in time
(gesturing) Um
look, there's something 've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and  just thought 'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and (chuckling) that's this
(mumbling) Oh, yeah
What
(overlapping) That 've always regretted the way behaved that evening we went out, and, uh
've,  just thought 'd tell you that because  really made a fool out of myself
Oh, don't be silly
No
Don't be ridiculous
(overlapping) It's all right
was the,  was
You know, it was my fault
-- (inhaling) Holly laughs
So, so you want to go out to dinner again
mean, is that, is that
Have, you have any interest in that, or
Sure
Sure, uh, yes
(overlapping) Do you
mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening
Yeah
They stroll offscreen
"You Made Me Love You" grows louder and the film cuts to: One year later
: '  -  - large, perfectly roasted turkey on a serving plate briefly fills the screen as the camera moves across the food-laden table in Hannah's kitchen, past an electric mixer, several bowls, spices, tomatoes, and parsley, to reveal Evan walking through the doorway
(holding a drink) want ice
Who's got some-- (pointing to an ice bucket on the table) Oh, there it is
(offscreen, overlapping) It's on the table, Dad
The sounds of Thanksgiving guests in the other room are dimly heard; "You Made Me Love You" continues softly in the background
Mavis passes the table, licking some food off her hand
Hannah, in the background, is busy by the stove
(putting ice into his glass) Hey, where's Holly
She's late
As Mavis leaves the kitchen, Lee enters, carrying some empty glasses
(walking briskly to the sink) Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote
It was great
She's really developed
(offscreen, in another area of the kitchen) know, she
she really writes good dialogue
(turning to the offscreen Hannah) Yeah
'll get some ice
Lee walks off, drying her wet hands in the air
Hannah, in a silk dress, moves onscreen, going to the table and pouring herself a glass of wine as Norma enters the kitchen
Hannah, can  tell everybody you're going to play Desdemona
Norma walks over to a glass-doored cabinet and takes out a bottle of gin
(taking a big sip of her wine) Oh, Mom, it's only television
(beginning to mash some sweet potatoes in a bowl on the table) (gesturing with the bottle) Yes, but it's public television
And to me, Shakespeare doesn't get any greater than Othello
You with some big black stud
love it
Norma unscrews the liquor bottle and pours some into her empty glass as Hannah stops her mashing, reacting
(gasping and laughing) Oh, Mom
(overlapping, reacting) Oh, honey
The movie leaves the kitchen and cuts to the doorway between the dining room and the living room
Upbeat jazz plays over the low din of the party
Two women stand by the partially set dining room table, chatting and arranging some plates, as Elliot strolls into view, sipping a drink
He passes the women and walks through the doorway into the living room, nodding hello to a guest who is walking the other way
He enters the living room, smiling
It is crowded with guests; Hannah's children play in their midst
One of Hannah's boys grabs Elliot's arm
They playfully "spar" for a moment before Elliot laughingly shakes him off, continuing on his way into a connecting room
He stops at the doorway, looking at the crowd
The camera shows his point of view: Guests stand in clusters, enjoying themselves; one woman chats with a little boy; another woman, carrying a drink, walks over to a group of other guests
The film then cuts back briefly to Elliot, holding his drink and looking straight ahead, as it shows his point of view once more
This time he sees a smiling Lee and Doug, talking animatedly; a few guests are seen in the background
Elliot's voice is heard over a close-up of the couple
(
) Oh, Lee, you are something
Lee and Doug kiss each other
They continue talking
(
) You look very beautiful
Marriage agrees with you
Everything that happened between us (pausing) seems more and more hazy
As Lee takes a sip of her drink, the movie cuts back to Elliot, standing in the doorway and still staring straight ahead
The camera moves in closer to his face as he talks over the scene
(
) acted like such a fool
don't know what came over me
That complete conviction that  couldn't live without you
The film quickly cuts to a brief look at Lee and Doug, still talking animatedly and smiling
Lee gently pushes back Doug's hair
(
) What did  put us both through
And Hannah
The camera moves back to Elliot
(
) (continuing) who as you once said,  love much more than  realized
After pausing for a moment on Elliot's face, the film cuts to the foyer, where two boys and a girl gather by the door
One boy opens it, revealing Holly
She joyfully enters the apartment, greeting each child with an enthusiastic kiss
(kissing the children) Hi
How are you
(kissing) Happy Thanksgiving
(kissing) #1 Hi
didn't miss dinner, did
(overlapping, talking at once) No
The jazz ends as the record scratches and stops
Evan's rendition of "Isn't It Romantic" is heard on the piano as Holly, shrugging the strap of her pocketbook off her shoulder, walks towards the living room
She is stopped by three guests--two women, one of them wearing glasses, and a man--who are coming out of the room
(smiling) Huh
Hi, Marge
#1 (overlapping) You look lovely
They kiss
#2 (overlapping, hugging Holly) Hello, darling
Happy Thanksgiving
#2 (overlapping) Good to see you
Same to you
(hugging the man) Hello
The movie cuts to Hannah, leaning contentedly against a doorway into the living room and listening to the offscreen Evan play the piano
Elliot, holding his drink, walks over to her
They look at each other for a beat; Elliot then hugs Hannah, pulling her towards him
She leans her head on his shoulder, fingering his jacket lapel
They look offscreen together, happily, intimately, at the offscreen guests, as the camera moves across the room, past a few guests, to reveal Evan sitting at the piano
Norma sits at his side, one arm resting on the piano
She holds a drink and looks off in the distance, mouthing the words to "Isn't It Romantic
" The camera then moves to the doorway in the living room, where a man, holding a drink, enters and joins the happy crowd
Evan can be seen in the background, playing his song
child plays near the coffee table
The camera continues to move past the doorway, past a huge grandfather clock, to a second doorway leading to the den
Here, more guests are gathered; a child sits in a small chair by the sofa
He sips a soda as female guest #2 enters the room and crouches down next to him, smiling
She waves to him
He waves back as the camera continues to move past the doorway to reveal Holly, standing in front of a hallway mirror, fixing her earrings
Mavis can be seen in the background, through the doorway into the dining room, lighting the candles on the table
She dims the lights, darkening the room and the hallway where Holly stands in a warm candlelit glow
Mavis leaves the dining room and passes Holly
(still fixing her earrings, to Mavis) It's beautiful
Mavis walks off
Holly, reflected in the mirror, begins fluffing her hair as Mickey enters and wraps his arms around her from behind
The camera stays focused on the mirror; both Holly and Mickey are now seen in its reflection
(smacking his lips) Now don't get nervous
It's just your husband
(grinning) Hi
Hi
(kissing Holly) How you doin'
(nestling against Mickey) Okay
When'd you get here
Just a few minutes ago
Oh
(kissing her again) You look so beautiful
Mickey continues to kiss Holly
She responds, sighing and closing her eyes
Thanks
(kissing Holly's neck) You know,  was talking with your father before
and  was telling him that (kissing) it's ironic
- used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah
and never thought (kissing) that  could love anybody else
(kissing) And here it is, years later and 'm married to you (kissing) and completely in love with you
(kissing) The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle
(kissing) It really is
(kissing) It'd made a great story,  think
guy marries one sister
(kissing) doesn't work out
(kissing) many years later
(kissing) he winds up (inhaling) married to the other sister
It's, you know, it's a
(fondling Mickey's arm, smiling) Tch
(overlapping) don't know how you're gonna top that
Mickey continues to kiss Holly's neck; he chuckles
(kissing Mickey's cheek) Mickey
(kissing Holly's neck) Mmm, what
'm pregnant
The mirror shows Mickey pulling away slightly, reacting
They look at each other at arm's length, Holly grinning
Mickey in shock, then embrace and kiss passionately, tighter and tighter, as the music swells
And the credits appear, white on a black screen
