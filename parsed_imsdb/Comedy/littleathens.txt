Written by Jeff Zuber & Tom Zuber Draft: 3/17/04 : ' , '  -- The room is dark and messy
, a soft, unshaven boy of about eighteen years, sits on the end of his bed in boxers and an old t- shirt
He has not quite woken up yet
Jerry pulls a huge, well-traveled  from his closet and tosses it onto the bed
He begins grabbing articles of from the closet and tossing them into the Suitcase
' ,  -- Jerry is in his kitchen, which is no brighter than his bedroom, and not much cleaner
Jerry takes another bite of his peanut butter and jelly
He chews mechanically, washing it down with a can of
His lazy mind is somewhere else
' ,  -- Jerry gargles with a generic brand of  and spits into the sink
He catches a glimpse of himself in the medicine cabinet mirror - he is not very attractive
He grabs his  and , and exits the bathroom
' , '  -- The room has been stripped except for the bed minus its bedsheets, a naked pillow, a beat-up dresser with a small  on top of it, an old propped against the wall near the   at the foot of the bed, and a few posters and scraps of trash
Jerry tosses his Toothbrush and Razor into his Suitcase next to a and several  , on top of which lies
He has pitifully few belongings
He shuts the Suitcase
' ,   -- The living room is also a mess - the place is either a pig sty or a house full of bachelors
Jerry, now in sweatpants and sneakers, but still wearing the same t-shirt that he slept in, carries his Suitcase through the foyer to the front door
He about-faces to look at the interior of his home
He will not miss it
He turns to open the screen door - it's stuck
He fiddles with handle until the screen door opens
He exits, letting the screen door slam shut behind him
: Little Athens -- The old building is badly in need of a fresh paint job
faded sign reading "  " stands in front

) You hear about your ex
(
) Jerry
,  -- The kitchen is empty except for  and , both about nineteen and dressed in  uniforms with "" stitched conspicuously on the back, seated on opposite sides of a wooden table
Heather is dark-haired, about 5'9" and built like a lingerie model
Allison has blond hair, is several inches shorter than Heather, and although not overweight, she has a softer build than Heather
Heather has take-out  and  in front of her, and she is putting it away like she is preparing for famine
Allison has a  and a , which remain hardly touched - she has a lot on her mind
Yeah, asshole Jerry
He's moving to Middletown
He left this morning
No way
How do you know
Carter said
He got some job at some company, giving his uncle hand-jobs
Having put away the last of her food, Heather lights a  and stands near the open window, careful to blow the smoke out the window
Doesn't sound so bad
got us tickets to see Adam tomorrow
don't want to go to a baseball game
You're going with Derek anyway
Ally,  don't want to go either, but Derek told Adam he'd go, and 'm not going by myself
thought Adam was hurt
wish
Heather takes a drag of her Cigarette and exhales out the window
'  -- , in jeans with his t-shirt thrown over his shoulder, is standing in front of the door, waiting
, in shorts, a t-shirt and a baseball cap, and , in a sunskirt, look on
All in their late teens, they are unmade and worn-out, as if they hadn't slept last night
Brad rings the doorbell twice and waits some more
Brad walks over to the window a few feet over from the door, trying to peer through the shades
Megan passes the time by pulling Jimmy's  out of the mailbox that hangs next to the door
(banging on the window pane) Hey
Jimmy
The door opens and  answers, in his very late teens, about 5'4" and thin, dressed in boxers, a t-shirt and bedroom slippers
Jimmy's tired, but Brad's a friendly face
(') Finally
Office hours are nine to five
You have a lot of credit card bills in there, Jimmy
(holding his hand out for the Mail) know
Megan hands Jimmy the Mail
You're not mad that we're stopping by like this
It's no big deal, but let's hurry up gotta go to work
(explaining to Amy) Jimmy's got like, six jobs
Jimmy stands aside, allowing Megan and Amy into his apartment
Megan and Amy step inside, but Brad holds back
He needs to talk to Jimmy, and the girls do not need to hear
Hey Jimmy, hold up a sec
Look, not for nothin', but you know Buggerin' Bobby Bales is askin' about you
Askin'
Like how
Like how you owe him money on the Dallas fiasco, those chokin' motherfuckers, and you haven't been returnin' his calls
How you hear this
Yesterday
was puttin' a twenty-timer on Indiana for tonight, and he up and out- of-the-blue asks about you
Jimmy, man
Goddam
(unconvincing) It ain't nothin'
He's just makin' conversation
It ain't nothin'
That faggot juicehead's gonna make a playground outta your asshole like he's back in the joint, and it ain't nothin'
And you heard all the stories heard, about that horse-cock, and how he can't stop shootin' his mouth off about it too, like when he whipped it out at Tomlinson's party
Alright Brad
Christ Jesus,  owe a little, shit, but 'll pay
Believe me, that guy wants his juice, his e, he comes to me
It's fine
Put some cash on Indy tonight, Jimmy
Yeah
Alright, come inside and let's do this thing
got work
Brad steps past Jimmy into the apartment, and Jimmy shuts the door after them
-- The slender white board extends majestically over the glistening blue water
, an unshowered, pot-bellied Hispanic, about twenty-three years of age and wearing cut-off jean shorts, is standing at the end of the board, looking down at the water below as if expecting an invitation
, a late teenager covered with tattoos, with twigs for arms and legs, lies against the hard concrete while inserting the pool   into one of the many pool skimmer drains
Pedro begins to bounce on the board - up, down, up, down
Pedro launches forth as if the water called out to him and, but for his want of grace, the entry would be poetic
Instead, Pedro's dive is as clumsy as it is painful
Nice
Fuck you, conjo
This is my shower
Maybe back in Mexico that's a shower, in Athens that's just dirty
Clean the pool, conjo, clean the pool
At least 'm paid to be here
Pedro smiles as he paddles away from Corey, starting to enjoy his morning swim
hanging on the pool house starts ringing
Corey drops the Vacuum and runs toward the Payphone
In the background a number of enormous sand filters groan loudly
(') Wynwood Pool House, Corey speaking
, the voice on the other end, is hushed and uncertain
' It's me
Emily
' Some other girl would be calling you
How'd you get this number
' Don't you work there
What do you want
' need you to come pick me up
Are you kidding
Where are you
' At home
What for
' Just because
need to stay with you for a couple days
Emily, our place is tiny, we got no water
Our phone just got shut off, too
You'd be miserable like us
What for anyway
' It's no big deal
Just come pick me up
Fine, forget it then
' Corey, come on
How many times have called you since you left
wouldn't ask, except  don't have anywhere to go
Please
Fine
Alright, fine
If you wanna stay in our little dump, fine
' Fine
Thanks, then
'  -- , about eighteen, wire-thin and plain, yet attractive in an unkept sort of way, with dirty-blond hair past her shoulders, lies on a couch sleeping
Her chokingly small living room is in a devastating state of disarray, with clothes and empty food containers flung in every direction
An  on a table next to the couch begins blaring, and Jessica stretches out her arm to silence it
' ,  -- Jessica is standing in front of the mirror staring at herself, still half asleep
The bathroom is tiny like the living room - pathetic rather than endearing
She puts  on her
' ,   -- , Jessica's mother, opens the front door and enters the living room wearing a grocery checkout clerk's uniform
Jina drops her old, worn out purse onto the coffee table and enters the hallway
She opens the bathroom door and enters
' ,  -- Jessica is brushing her teeth when Jina enters
Aren't you supposed to be watching Katie right now
Jina reaches around Jessica and opens the medicine cabinet, grabs a bottle of , and shuts it
Jessica continues brushing as if her mother were not there
(') Did you get my message
Jessica shakes her head in the negative sense
Jina exits the bathroom and Jessica follows, still brushing her teeth
' ,   -- Jessica walks over to the   and hits a button
The Answering Machine clicks on as Jessica brushes unenthusiastically
(electronic voice) You have one new message
(Jina's voice) Hi Jess, it's your mother, calling to say happy birthday, since you'll be gone when get home
'm driving your sister to school and 'm leaving the car for her, so 'll be taking the train back
Jessica starts up as if she'd been struck
She spins around to an open window near the couch, leans out, and spits out the toothpaste to the concrete sidewalk below
Her mother's voice continues to pour forth from the Answering Machine
(') By the way, you should call your sister and stop this not-talking nonsense
Jessica finishes spitting the suds from her mouth and spins back towards the Answering Machine
(') Anyway,  know how you hate long messages, so 'll see you tomorrow
Suddenly wide awake, Jessica turns to her mother
That's fucking bullshit
Here we go again
What about my car
Jessica, your sister got into beauty school, and she's going
Now 've got about two hours sleep before  have to drive her all the way the hell up there
Yeah,  heard that
Jess, you're still living here for free
On the couch
Jessica, it's still my car, and she needs it
Can't you be happy for your sister
Oh yeah, 'm real happy
She gets my car, and  get shit
Thanks, Jina
Do me a favor and tell her how fucking happy  am for her
If you're going to be like this, 'm just going to bed
Jessica storms back into the bathroom and rinses her mouth out with water
Jessica returns to the living room wearing a t-shirt that reads "Athens Youth Group" in large letters along the front
Jina is gone
Jessica runs her hand through her hair, tossing it haphazardly
She grabs a pair of large  off of the coffee table and places them over her eyes
She opens the door and exits the apartment
'  -- Jimmy's -- hatchback is parked in front of the small bare-bones gym
' ,   -- Jimmy now dressed in worn-out heavily-frayed khaki shorts and a short-sleeve button down shirt with a "Ron's Gym" emblem on the pocket, stands before his locker twisting the combination lock with one hand while rotating steel    with his other hand
He opens the locker and pulls out a large brown propped prominently at the base
(
) Hey Jimmy
You fix the lat machine
, the tall, well-built, forty-something owner of the gym, approaches
Jimmy turns toward Ron
The row of lockers serves as a backdrop
Yeah
Jimmy, 'm just gonna say this, alright
gotta let you go
can't afford two employees
So you're keeping Melinda
Yeah
Ron, that is totally fucked
been here way longer than her
Yeah, but 'm running a business
There're guys who pay me dues just 'cause she works here
10 But she doesn't do anything
She just sits at the front desk all day
know that
Tell her to fix the fucking lat machine, she'll look at you cross-eyed
can't afford two employees, and she attracts business
That's it
Fucking great
Thanks
Jimmy, don't take it personal
If you were built like her 'd keep you
Ron exits and Jimmy sits on the bench in front of his locker, defeated
'  , a
k
a
Bobby the Bookie, an enormous juicehead built like an old-school  linebacker, naked except for a towel around his neck, having just taken a shower, is leaning against the end of a row of lockers, waiting for his chance at Jimmy
Jimmy would rather that Ron stay
(') Bales
Bobby nods in response as Ron passes by on his way out
With the locker room empty, Bobby unconsciously changes demeanor
He's tender, frighteningly tender, it's so entirely genuine
Jimmy would prefer a beating - simple and final
Jimmy pulls his  out of his locker and begins clearing his
So where you been
What are you talkin' about
Nowhere been working
So you just don't return my phone calls
Look, they lost,  owe you some more, so what
'll pay you
want to put it on Indy tonight
11 can't take any more of your bets look like a spineless fucking fag
Bobby shuts Jimmy's locker and steps up to Jimmy so that Jimmy is now face to face with Bobby's enormous organ - a terrifying sight for mortal men and reputable women
Jimmy is struck silent, savagely clenching his Chinese Stress Balls as he struggles for thought
(') What the hell am  supposed to do with you Jimmy
People are talkin'
know they're talkin'
You don't know a fuckin' thing
Come by my apartment tonight, we'll figure this out
ain't like that
Ain't like what
Nothin'
You don't know what  know
You'll see
'm working tonight
Jimmy,  ain't about beggin'
'm lookin' like a fool all on account 'a you
You owe me
You owe me
'm gettin' sick of it
Bobby moves on to his own locker
-- across the width of the pool
, wet, with  on his head, holding a  and  , and  #1, stand over a young twenty-ish female  who lies passed out on the cement
young female  is kneeling beside the Victim, checking her pulse and breathing
The two  left in the pool are climbing out
, a no-nonsense grounds-keeper in his late thirties, wearing cut-off shorts, a faded t-shirt and a tool belt, approaches to have a word with Corey
12 Is she alright
She fainted
Alright, 'm calling 911
Everybody stay out of the pool
The Lifeguard stands and runs off toward the
Alright, well, quit horsing around
The Blandino's had a break-in
There's glass all over the patio
That's Jerry's unit
Jerry moved to Middletown
He quit
He left a message
You gotta take care of all his stuff now, too
Aw, come on, Pete
need off tomorrow
told you  got community service
So you're gonna have to get everything done today then
Get going
Corey tears the Goggles off his head, throws them into the pool, and about-faces toward the pool-house
As Corey leaves, a - does a sloppy can-opener off the side of the pool
(
) Keith,  told you to clear the pool
-- Though the park is in a poor neighborhood, it is relatively clean
The park is quiet and unused this morning except for two young making their way across it
Prominent in the background sits an old run-down yellow  that Jessica drove to the park
13 is carrying , a plain, tiny seven-year-old girl, in piggy-back fashion, with Katie's legs dangling out in front of Jessica
Katie holds Jessica tight around the collarbone
Doesn't Carlos want his car back
He's letting me borrow it
Well then why were you late if you had his car
slept late
Were you drinking last night
No
But thanks for asking
Were you doing drugs
Katie,  told you, drugs are for losers
And you're not a loser
And neither are you
But it's okay to drink
When you're older it'll be okay
How old are you
Old enough
But you're not twenty-one yet
The law says you have to be twenty-one
Katie, can you not ask so many questions today
've got too much to think about
14 Cause it's your birthday
Yes
Happy Birthday
Thank you
Jessica begins walking faster, soon breaking into a crippled run, the weight of Katie bearing down on her
They reach their destination - a rickety old merry-go-round
Jessica turns her back to the merry-go-round, allowing Katie to step onto it
(') Hold on tight or you'll get hurt
will
Katie grabs a handle as Jessica begins to spin the machine
Katie sails around happily as Jessica steps back to watch, Katie's youthful enthusiasm lulling Jessica into a nostalgic gloom
-- is driving the , sirens blaring, a hanging out of her mouth, with  riding shotgun
, mild- mannered, rotund, middle-aged and slightly balding, is in the back sitting on a bench extending from the side of the ambulance, adjacent to a stretcher
Harry sits expressionless, adjusting his spectacles as the ambulance shakes mildly from the driving
(pointing) Turn left at the light
-- on the ambulance tearing through town, lights flashing
Heather is driving extremely fast in this emergency situation, recklessly passing both moving vehicles as well as stationary vehicles that have stopped to let the ambulance pass, on her way to running through a red light
In the rear of the ambulance, Harry whips back and forth on the bench, yet remains calm, as if unaware of Heather's reckless driving
,   -- Within the parking lot, the ambulance comes to a screeching halt in front of a large picket fence encircling the pool
At the gate stands the
15 All three climb out of the ambulance
Harry rushes toward the Lifeguard
Heather takes a final puff    of her Cigarette and flicks it aside before continuing in the same   direction as Harry
Allison lags behind, pulling a  and a   large    out of the ambulance
She's in here
They enter the gate
-- Heather and Harry follow the Lifeguard into the pool area, where several  have gathered around the ,  #1 and among them
Heather gets to the Victim first, but stops short - she recognizes the Victim
Harry brushes past Heather
(to Bystanders) Can you give us some room, please
The crowd backs up a bit, and Harry checks for vitals
(') (looking up to Heather) She's breathing
Harry looks the Victim over a bit
(') (to Lifeguard) What happened
'm not sure
She just passed out, right where you see her
Did you see her eat anything
Uh-uh
Heather turns and walks back toward Allison coming through the gate carrying the Backboard and First Aid Kit - she wants a word with Allison
They talk in hushed tones
know her
Yeah
How
16 Allison hands Heather the First Aid Kit as they move back toward Harry
When  was dating Steve, that slut fucked him
How do you know
She started dating Steve right after we broke up
mean right after
asked him if there was another girl, and he never answered
He couldn't answer, because he was fucking that slut
That doesn't mean they fucked
Heather gives Allison a disapproving look, as if to say "don't be stupid, stupid
" As Heather and Allison approach the Victim, Harry looks up
Alright, she ain't comin' around
Allison lays the Backboard adjacent to the Victim, and the three place her on the Backboard
Heather is a bit rough
(') (instinctively) Whoa, easy
(without looking up) know what 'm doing
Harry gives a concerned look to Allison, who returns the look, but the two say nothing
They place the Victim into the back of the Ambulance as Heather looks on
-- The Ambulance is moving along a near-empty single-lane road at a patient pace, with two  tailgating behind it
-- Allison and Harry are in the back with the Victim, and Heather is again behind the wheel, moving her head ever so slightly, as if to music playing in her head
Heather's moderate driving speed is in sharp contrast to the speed with which she responded to the scene
At the same red light that Heather recklessly ran earlier, Heather 17 stops and looks in all directions before proceeding, even though there are no cars at the intersection
Uh, Heather, you want to step on it
We'll get there
You don't even know for sure if she slept with Steve
Heather turns around in the driver seat, taking her eyes off the road
Listen, fuck that slut, okay
She can fucking rot in hell
'm not rushing for her slut ass
(pleading) Heather, c'mon, she's out cold
We gotta hurry
-don't-fucking-care
That slut can kiss my ass
(to Victim) You hear me, you fucking bitch
As Heather spins forward to look at the road, the Ambulance jumps as it hits a pothole
'  -- The Tow Truck has just pulled up into the driveway
Pedro climbs out and makes his way up the sidewalk to his front door, carrying a gallon of
Emily climbs out and trails behind him, carrying her   and
The house is very small, with a front yard that is not much bigger than the sidewalk, and neighboring houses not much more than a body length apart from each other
Pedro notices an   on the front door, and that a brand-new lock has been placed on the otherwise run-down door
He tries unsuccessfully to open the door
He walks over and looks through the front window into his kitchen and sees his
Pedro taps on the window
The Dog looks up at Pedro, wagging its tail
Pedro tries to open the window, but it's locked
Pedro walks around to the side of the house
Emily throws her Laundry Bag over her shoulder and follows him, frustrated with the wait
He looks in the window on the pantry door
He backs up and 18 looks toward Emily, blank
He looks back up at the house, frustrated
He about-faces, steps over to the side of the neighboring house, unzips his pants, looks both ways to make sure the neighbors are not around, and starts pissing
Emily shakes her head and heads back toward the truck, turned off by the whole situation
-- Jimmy parks his -- in front of a mom-and-pop pizza shop and exits
sign that reads "Poppy's Pizzeria" hangs above the pizza shop
He enters
-- Jimmy walks past a few tables where patrons are eating
, a sixty-ish pot-bellied man standing behind the counter making a , sees him
(heavy Italian accent) Hey-a, Jimmy, you don't hafta be here 'till 2:00
What's up, eh
You hungry
Nah
'm gonna start early, if that's alright

Still paying offa those credit cards, eh Jimmy

(calling into the back) Sweetheart
Don't a worry about that
Jimmy's a here and he's a gonna take care of it
In an arched entranceway to the back room we see   back into view holding several   in insulated
(smiling) Hey-a Jimmy
'  -- Jessica is driving the old run-down yellow  we saw earlier in the parking lot of the park, the window down and the radio blasting
Her   rings and she picks it up
Hello
(
) Where the hell are you
19 Carlos
-- , a skinny Hispanic teenager, is walking out of the convenience store with a tray of , talking on a
We cut back and forth between Jessica and Carlos
Why weren't you answering your phone
You were supposed to bring my car back last night
' Yeah
Sorry
You bringing it or what
need it for work
' Not 'til this afternoon
What the hell, Jess
You said 'd have it last night
' Alright, relax, 'll bring it
Dammit
Where are you
' 'm getting on the Parkway
The old run-down yellow Car passes Carlos and continues down the street
Carlos is dumbfounded
What the hell
Carlos runs into the street and stands staring down the road at his Car speeding away from him
' What's the matter
Jess, you just passed me
In my car
Carlos continues to look as his Car makes a right turn and disappears from view
20 (') Jess, this is bullshit
Bring back my car
horn honks, and Carlos steps toward the side of the road as a passes right by him
He continues to stand in the street, although to the side
(') Jess,  know you're coming back here know you're not leaving me standing here
Carlos waits impatiently
Jessica pulls up in the Car and comes to a stop alongside him - she had gone around the block to pick him up
He gets in the passenger-side door
Sorry
The Car pulls away
'  -- Carlos has a look of disgust on his face
would have brought the car back, but need it
So you ask
said 'm sorry
Yeah right
And why the hell are you still driving
Fine
The Car stops, Carlos and Jessica climb out of the Car and pass in back of it without a word
Carlos climbs into the driver seat, and Jessica the passenger seat
Jessica grabs Carlos's Nachos and starts munching them down, dipping each one into the that is on the side
Where's the squirt
At my place watching
21 You left her alone
Just for a minute
left my novel at Aaron's
You need it now
Aren't you supposed to be watching her
Yeah, 'm stuck with her all weekend
'm just gonna get through these last few weeks like  promised, and 'm done,  did a good thing, and some other moron can take a turn being her big sister
Don't know why you wanted another sister when you hate the one you got
Jessica needs to change the subject
What're you up to
Guess who stopped by
Who
Guess
Mary Lynn
Yes
Gigantic beast of a woman that she is
Jessica is obviously delighting in this
She enjoys Carlos fighting off the affections of this very unattractive girl
Aw Carlos,  think you should give her a shot
She's probably one of those personality girls
Yeah, what you know about personality
22 bet she'll give it up right away
Now that's something you know about
You should go for it
Drain them pipes
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
Carlos reaches down and blasts the radio as the Car speeds down the road
-- Jimmy is carrying several full insulated pizza  , with several brown   full of food on top
Although the pile looks unwieldy, Jimmy has no trouble with it
He places the pile on the roof of his --, opens the passenger door, and places the pile on the passenger seat
He closes the door, and pulls a   out of his pocket to examine while walking around to the driver's side
Jimmy gets into the driver's seat and pulls out his
(into his cell phone) Hey, Car, it's me
got a delivery in the area so 'm stopping by a little early
See you in a little while
Jimmy hangs up, starts his Piece-of-Shit, and pulls out of the parking lot
-- is sitting off the road, positioned to surprise unsuspecting speeders
The lone occupant, , twenty, about 6' tall with athletic build, in his police-officer uniform, is reading the   of a newspaper
'   -- on Derek as he turns the page and continues reading the sports section
young preppy high school  speeds by in a  - the   reads 93 m

As he passes, the punk looks straight at Derek, mouth open, clearly surprised by Derek's presence
Derek picks up his head and returns the stare of the surprised Punk as he passes
23 Whoa
(returning to the Sports Section) Slow down, there, buddy
Derek's   rings
He reaches down, fumbles around, and brings it to his ear
(') Yeah
-- is seated on a small wooden bench in the yard in front of the rescue squad
is pacing back and forth in front of her, to her ear
Both are smoking
Heather is still heated from seeing Steve's girl, and Allison is uncomfortable being around Heather, who may lash out at anything
We cut back and forth between Derek and Heather
Are you seeing anybody else
Hello
(louder) Hello
Are you seeing anybody else
No
You're not cheating on me
No
Be honest
You're startin' to annoy me
You're fucking annoying me
(dismissive) Fine
Don't you hang up
24 Then calm down
You told me to tell you when you're in one of your moods
Well guess what
hears a click, hangs up, puts his Cell Phone down and goes back to reading the Sports Section
See
That asshole's cheating
Just because he won't move in with you doesn't mean he's cheating
Ally, he's a cheater
That's what he does - he cheats
Now it's my turn just like all the others
Heather grabs her  off the bench, replaces her Cell Phone, and pulls out her
(') Let's go
Where
Allison gets up and follows Heather toward the parking lot
'  -- has parked in front of an old house, which is in a high state of disrepair
gets out of the  with Carlos'
You coming in
No, but tell asshole  said hello
See ya
Jessica shuts the door
As she walks away, Carlos cannot take his eyes off of her - he is obsessed
Jessica walks up the steps and bangs on the screen door
, African-American, medium build, in his late teens, with thick-framed glasses, walks up behind the screen door and holds it open for Jessica to walk in
25 (') Aaron here
No, he went to yer place lookin' fer you
'  -- Jessica walks in
Pitt let's the door slam shut
Shit

You got no idea why he's lookin' for you, do you

Shit
You humped someone, didn't you

Well it musta been the immaculate infection, 'cuz he got somethin'
He's lookin' fer you
26 Jessica throws the Nachos on the coffee table and sits on the couch, head in her hands, on the verge of tears
Shit, shit
Yeah, you did it
Fuck you, Pitt
, '  -- is  the floor
He glances up as Pedro steps over to him
Corey and Pedro talk and argue like two kids on a playground
Hey, mehn
What're you doing back

That's my little sister
She's hot, mehn
Esta buenisima

Don't do anything that'll get us into trouble
Do you think 'm stupid, mehn
Don't worry about this
talk to him
But first  take care of business
Pedro bangs on a stall door, with no response
Pedro pushes the door to the stall open
(') Okay, mehn
Good
Voy a cagar
Pedro disappears behind the door of the stall
Corey leans his Mop against the wall and exits
'  -- pulls his -- into the driveway of what appears to be a one-story house, next to a
He climbs out with the strap of his  hanging over one shoulder and walks around the house to the back yard
The yard slopes significantly from the front yard to the back yard, and the view of the back of the house reveals two stories
As Jimmy turns the corner, he spots a black  walking up to him
He grabs the Cat
'  -- on Jimmy holding the Cat behind a set of sliding glass doors, one door partially open
He enters and shuts the door behind him
Music is playing through stereo speakers, and a black-and-white movie is playing on the  with the sound shut off
, an Asian- American late-twenty-something, is sitting back on the couch facing 28 the
Magazines, junk food, remote controls and a are spread out on the coffee table
If Car notices Jimmy enter the room, he shows no sign of it
Saw your cat outside

The Cordless Phone starts ringing
Car remains perfectly still
(') Car
No response
The Cordless Phone continues to ring
Jimmy leans over from his chair and waves a hand in front of Car
Nothing
Jimmy jumps up from his recliner
He stares at Car
He steps over, takes two fingers and checks Car's pulse
He stands back, unsure of what to do
Hesitant, Jimmy walks over to a closet, opens the door, and slides a out into the room
He opens the Gym Bag and pulls out a large bag of  and a few jars of
He throws them into his Backpack, zips up the Gym Bag, and puts it back into the closet
Jimmy exits through the sliding glass doors
'  -- Jimmy shuts the doors behind him
He stops in his tracks just outside the doors, thoughts running through his mind
'  -- on Jimmy through the doors as he about faces and stares into the house
He slides the doors open and re-enters
He picks up the Gym Bag and carries it to the front of the couch
He sets down Gym Bag and drops to his knees, all while noticing that Car appears to be staring at him
He unloads the remaining contents of the Gym Bag into his Backpack, including a few bags of , a few more jars of , and two large bags of

'  -- Jimmy is driving through semi-busy traffic
Music is blaring from the radio, and the driver-side window is open, making the noise in the cockpit quite loud
Jimmy's left hand is simultaneously wrapped around the steering wheel and the  , which is hanging down over the steering wheel so that he can read it
Jimmy's rings
(over the wind and music) Yeah, it's Jimmy
(
) (barely audible) Hey Jimmy, it's Matt

Jimmy turns off the radio and begins rolling up the driver-side window
Matt
Speak up, man,  can barely hear you
'  -- , in his late teens, has a very short buzz-cut
He's wearing an old t-shirt and faded cargo-shorts, and he's sitting up on the edge of his unmade bed
Matt's bedroom is a shithole, with dirty clothes piled everywhere
He's talking into a  , using his free hand to rub the back of his neck nervously
(semi-whispering) need some , dude

We cut back and forth between Jimmy and Matt
(still rolling up the window) What
(semi-whispering) Jesus Christ, Jimmy
My folks are home

30 Alright, alright

'll see you tonight
Jimmy hangs up and begins to roll down the window
The cell phone begins ringing again
Jimmy reverses himself and begins rolling the window back up
(') Yeah, it's Jimmy
We cut back and forth between Jimmy and Matt
Matt is now pacing back and forth in his shithole room
His voice is hushed, although the sense of urgency in it is obvious
Jimmy's still talking loud, as his Piece-of-Shit does not provide a quiet ride
Jimmy
Jesus, man
Listen to me
need one a' your special deliveries -  won't be around tonight
Alright, man, when do you need it
Like, now, dude
For tonight

Matt, you're way out of the way, man
Wait for another delivery
Look,  need it now, man

What's the rush
(finally confiding) Look, dude, 'm takin' out this girl - a friend of Setzer's
He said  could bang her easy if  had some
Really
Easy, dude, easy
Setzer's words - it's in the bag
Jimmy's eyes get very wide
31 Jesus
Jimmy slams on the breaks and cuts the wheel to the left
Too late
Jimmy rocks forward as the stress balls that were sitting on the passenger seat fly to the floor
-- Jimmy's Piece-of-Shit has just rear-ended another  of equal value parked in front of a   in an otherwise empty intersection
The  of the forward Car stirs
'  -- Jimmy has his right arm draped over the Pizza Boxes in the passenger seat, protecting them from flying forward as a parent would have instinctively reached to hold back a child
His Cell Phone starts ringing again
He slowly begins to stir
-- The driver, , a large, ripped, soft-spoken juicehead, gets out of the forward car holding the back of his neck
He slams the door shut with his free hand, pissed, and staggers towards Jimmy's car
twenty-something   is sitting motionless in the passenger seat
Dave glances up and sees Jimmy
Jimmy
(still dazed, but immediately friendly) Hey, what's up, man
Jimmy turns off the ringer on his Cell Phone and gets out of his vehicle
Shit, Dave, sorry 'bout that
was talkin' on the phone
didn't see the stop sign,  guess
Don't sweat it
(regarding his Car) could give a shit about this thing was hopin' some rich doctor or lawyer or somethin' hit me
Jimmy notices the Female Passenger in the passenger seat and walks toward her, with Dave following
Holy shit, man, is she alright
32 Jimmy and Dave both stand near the passenger side of the car
The window is completely open
The Female Passenger lies motionless, bleeding noticeably from the forehead
She'll be alright
You didn't hit us that hard - it's gotta look worse than it is
What're you, a fuckin' doctor
We need ta get her to a hospital
Fuck that, you'll have all kinds 'a problems if we do that
Cops, insurance and whatnot
You probably got drugs on you
Dave, look at her fuckin' head
She's bleedin' all over the place
Just give her a minute, she'll snap out of it
She's a stripper, for god-sake
That's retarded
The Female Passenger begins to slowly stir
It is clear she is out of it - still very woozy
See

Look at the blood
Jimmy reaches for his Cell Phone, but Dave again objects
Put that shit away

She needs a doctor
What the hell's gonna do
Jimmy, listen, she's gonna be fine

Seriously

) You smoke
Yeah, so
You do drugs
Corey enters the frame, grabs the Cigarette and stomps it out, but Emily's nonchalant demeanor remains
How would you know
Everybody knows my brother does drugs
So you heard about that thing that happened
Yeah
Everybody knows about that, too
If you think so highly of me, what the hell are you doing here
35 'm just saying
Why'd you try to put everything back in the house
We ran outta of gas
We were right outside his house - what the hell else were we supposed to do
He wasn't supposed to be home for another hour
At least he took it easy on us

Emily hands Corey the Baseball Cap
Corey is caught off-guard
What for
Dad gave it to you, remember
You left it

Corey has no desire to wear it, so he holds it
You go to see him at all

Vincent's gone
She's on Victor now
What happened to Vincent
He found out about Victor

So
Corey heads toward the gate and spots , a young boy of about ten, sitting on the  that was leaning up along the interior of the pool-area fence
(') Hey, Kevin, get off my bike, alright
It's a moped
Just lay off it
Kevin gets off
Corey continues toward the gate

37 Pedro throws the Paper and Pen into the Tow Truck
(') Oye, don't get mad, but would you be mad if  try to fuck your sister
If you think you can
Maybe you think you can talk to her for me
Pedro, she's fifteen
No way, mehn
(forming breasts with his hands) No con esas tetas

No way she is fifteen
She looks way older
She'll look a lot younger on the witness stand, with my mom sitting in the courtroom
Bueno, tell her  say good-bye

Pedro climbs behind the wheel as Corey holds the door open to talk to him
So what're you gonna do
'm gonna find Mr
Cocksucker and say, "Look, mehn, let us into our fucking home
" Corey steps aside as Pedro shuts his door and turns the ignition
38 Wait a second
Why are you still driving this thing
thought you got fired
Si, si, but  need it
How am  gonna drive without my truck
They fired me, mehn
Corey watches as Pedro pulls out

Two middle-age    are standing in front of the entrance, talking
Heather and Allison's is parked in the lot across the street, facing the police station

Don't you have an appointment with Dr
Cook
Five-thirty, and 'm not missing it
Derek probably thinks you're sleeping with your doctor
There's nothing wrong with you
(holding the lower portion of her right ribcage) Ally,  have a pain right here that has nothing to do with my head
My dad died of heart disease, and if that asshole taught me anything, it's better to be paranoid than dead
39 , a prim-and-proper plain-jane 5'5" woman in her early twenties, exits the building and walks over to talk with the two Male Police Officers
(') That's her
Tess
You're just guessing
Ally,  know that's her
That's his type, too
That little slut
Both Heather's and Allison's  go off
They both look down at their Beepers and sit up in their seats
Harry's waiting
Sorry if  snapped
You didn't snap
mean this morning
Oh
That's okay
Heather starts the Ambulance and starts to pull out of the lot
'm just afraid its gonna be the whole thing all over again with Derek, and then 've got to find some other asshole, and do it all again
'm sick of the whole cycle
So do something different
'm trying, but he's fucking it all up
As they pull out of the lot, the two Male Police Officers head toward their Police Cars and the Female Police Officer heads back inside the station

Jessica looks up to see  entering the house with  behind him
is a shaggy, 5'10" pothead slacker in his late teens, wearing beat-up jeans, a t-shirt with a faded logo on it, and light hair above his lip and on his chin
, a burly mutt, about the same age and only slightly shorter, wearing cut-off cargo pants with one of the thigh pockets ripped off, a sleeveless shirt and a tattoo on his left shoulder
Troy notices Jessica immediately
Holy shit
Aaron,  don't know how the hell you got
(interrupting) Fucking bitch
Aaron shoves Troy roughly out of the way as Jessica bolts out of the room
(to Jessica) Use the back door, yo
Jessica runs out the back door and around the front of the house
Aaron sees her turn the corner of the house, and he turns around to cut her off
(to Pitt) Man, don't be helpin' that bitch
don't want to see you be hittin' no girl
Just calm your ass down
Fuck you
Aaron runs out the front door after Jessica
41 He's gonna kill her
'  -- Aaron is out the front door, yelling at Jessica who is further down the street
Where you goin', bitch
Jessica runs to Carlos's , opens the door, throws the Novel in and jumps in after it
She throws on her seatbelt and rifles through her purse, looking for her pepper spray
Drive
(starting the Car) What's the deal
Aaron, holding a  slightly bigger than his fist, smashes the passenger-side window
(') What the fuck
Fucking drive
Aaron reaches in and grabs Jessica's hair and begins to rip her out of the car, cutting his own arm while doing so
Aaron growls, more in anger than pain, as he yanks with all his might
Jessica is holding onto the inside of the passenger door with one hand, and is scratching and clawing at Aaron to get Aaron to release her with her other hand
Jessica's seat belt clearly is the only thing keeping her in the car
Carlos is pulling away slowly
Aaron releases one hand from Jessica's hair and punches at the top of her head
(') Fuck you
Fuck you, you filthy fuckin' whore
Aaron repeatedly tries to hit Jessica with his free hand as Carlos pulls into the street
Aaron runs along with the car
Jessica reaches toward Aaron with a closed fist, where she is holding her She sprays at Aaron but misses
Aaron grabs at her fist with his free hand and rips the Pepper Spray from Jessica
Jessica screams in pain as Aaron sprays away
(') You like that, bitch
Huh
42 Carlos swerves violently to the side towards a parked  along the side of the road
Aaron is plowed along toward the Car, but releases Jessica at the last possible second, just avoiding a collision with the Car
Carlos was not fooling around
Aaron watches them tear down the street before he about-faces and walks briskly back toward the house, where Troy is standing on the front porch watching the action
'  -- Jessica is still reeling from the pepper spray
She can barely stammer out her words
Oh my God, my fucking eyes
Jesus, look at my car, Jess
That fucking
asshole
Now 'm screwed too
Carlos turns to look through the rear window of his car - all clear
(practically sobbing) 'm so sorry
An otherwise believable apology, except that Carlos knows Jessica too well
Jessica does not want to be in this alone
Carlos cuts the wheel to the right and tears down a side street
'  -- Pedro pulls his   and parallel parks on the street in front of the house
Pedro gets out of his Tow Truck and walks up to the front door
He rings the doorbell
There is no answer, so he rings the doorbell again, then knocks on the door
Again no answer, so he bangs on the door vigorously
He leans over and peers inside the window
As he does so,
opens the front door, apparently having just woken up
Pedro
What're you doing here
Get the hell off my porch
43 Hey, mehn, let me into my fucking apartment
Either pay me or get off my porch
Mr
Carson shuts the door
Pedro turns around and eyes the gray parked behind his Tow Truck
He walks back to his Tow Truck and grabs some tools
He begins hitching up the Ford Taurus to his Tow Truck
Mr
Carson parts the curtain behind his front window, eyes wide as he watches Pedro
The front door opens, and Mr
Carson comes storming out

Good question
What the fuck do  care, you think it's a good question
Are you fucking kidding me
Look,  didn't think of it

(') Can you let us back into our apartment now
This is only one month
You boys owe three
That's all we have
We'll give you the rest later, as soon as we can
When you get me the rest, 'll let you back in
Mr
Carson, c'mon
This is just temporary
Pedro lost his job
Bullshit
You're always late
You should spend less time trying to rob houses, and more time working
Aren't you supposed to take us to court before you throw us out
(
) Holy fuck, Shelby
Shut the goddam door already you stupid bastard
You're letting the cold air out
(suddenly in a hurry) Tell it to my lawyer
Aw, c'mon
Don't be like that
We're doin' our best
We're gonna be homeless
(
) Shut the goddam door
Three months

Carson slams the door

Corey stands and stares at the door a moment
He turns and leaves, resigned to a long walk back to the pool

Pedro's   backs up into the frame so that it's back end is almost touching the front end of the Mustang
Pedro climbs out of his Tow Truck, leaving it on, and starts walking around to the back of it
Suddenly remembering, he doubles back and sticks his head in through the driver-side window, checking the gas gage
It's more than 3/4 full
Satisfied, Pedro proceeds toward the rear of the tow truck and hitches the Mustang to the back of it
An older couple pulls into the parking lot and parks one car length from the Mustang and   climb out of their
The Older Man has taken an interest in what Pedro is doing
Hey, can  park here
(very friendly) Si, si, of course
(motioning toward the Mustang) The transmission is broke
Transmissions on these cars suck
Older Woman notices that the front passenger-side tire is flat
(pointing) Oh, and the tire's flat, too
Pedro steps around to the passenger side of the Mustang, surprised to see the
Ah, si, but that's no big deal
That's fine, believe me
Older Man and Older Woman begin walking toward the entrance to the diner
60 Good luck
Gracias
As Older Man and Older Woman proceed toward the diner, Pedro opens the door to his Tow Truck, and reaches in to hit the control which lifts the Mustang

Heather's  and  are lying on the examining table beside her
Breathe out
Heather lets her breath out
(') It's official
You're as healthy as you were last week, and last week you were as healthy as an ox
Are you sure you're using that thing right
feel this ache (indicating her chest) Right here, like 'm being crushed between two boards
Nobody's crushing you
Honest
'm sure
It's all in your head
know a couple quacks
don't need a head doctor
was just kidding there
Heather reaches into her  and lights a
Dr
Cook sighs - they've had a discussion about Heather's smoking before
61 (') Heather, if you're going to insist on ignoring my rules, at least put your blouse on before you light up
Heather hops off the bench and makes a sudden about-face
She is gesturing wildly, seemingly oblivious to the fact that she is half- naked
Can't  be concerned about my health
Is that so outrageous
Dr
Cook is clearly uncomfortable conversing with Heather while her breasts are exposed
Heather
just don't want to be walking around tomorrow and drop dead because my heart collapses, and so that makes me weird or paranoid
Heather, there's nothing wrong with being concerned about your health
Please put your blouse back on
Heather grabs her Blouse from the table and puts it back on
(') So 'll see you next week then
(suddenly friendly again) Okay, yeah, see you next week
Heather leaves and shuts the door behind her

Two people are having sex
There are no words, although the girl regularly lets out high- pitched groans, indicative of at least a little pain

Derek climaxes
Allison pops up from below
'm two pounds heavier  think

Sorry
Allison lies on top, nestling her head in his chest
It hurt
knew it would hurt, but that was kinda worse than  thought
Does Heather
like it
She never let's me do it
She doesn't
Why not
don't know
She does shave though
How come you don't shave
don't know
don't want to
Do you love her
don't know
How can you not know
She's got problems
don't understand you
Why do you even cheat on her with me
She's so pretty
So much prettier than me
She's   a nutcase
'll tell you what, don't   know why you do it
You should have a man   of your own - we say it all the time,   me and Heather
Yeah, who
That slob you and Heather introduced me to last time
He outranks me
He's a good guy
63 Like me, 'm a good girl, and the best can do is a guy that looks like that
No
You must think so
You tried to set me up with him
thought it was a bad match
It was Heather's idea
So she thinks  can't do better
You know what she thinks better than me
Allison climbs out of bed, and her mood changes from thoughtful to business-like
She begins putting her  on
Let's get dressed, she'll be here
Derek looks calmly over at the   on the nightstand
Let's let her walk in on us, and look surprised
Hurry up
Allison opens the door and walks out, a little bow-legged

spots him immediately from behind the counter
The  rings, but Pizza Pop ignores it
Hey-a Jimmy
Where you been
Around
Deliverin'
Hurry - sit down Anna eat something
We got more deliveries for you
Jimmy walks around the counter, grabs a couple of  and throws them in the oven
Pizza Pop picks up the Phone

Did your parents call
Nope
Where were you
Out with Carlos
Jessica disappears into the kitchen
The  is broken

) guess
' ,   -- Jessica places two Frozen Dinners, complete with a  apiece, down on the coffee table
Katie grabs her Fork
Are we going to have  dinners all weekend
No
promise
You want some milk
Can  have ice-tea
Of course
(to Carlos) Can you make her some ice-tea
65 Aren't you gonna eat
'm gonna take a shower
Carlos is disappointed that Jessica wants to fix herself up to see Carter
Katie is already eating

Carlos is behind the  and , fiddling with the wires
Are you Jessica's new boyfriend
No

Neither do
Don't you like Jessica
Kind of,  guess
She's nice

Derek and Allison are chowing down while Heather sits watching Derek
Derek is using a
Take a look at that paper
There's at least a half dozen apartments  circled that would be perfect
Derek continues chowing down, not responding
Derek's rings, and he answers it
66 Yeah
(beat) You're joking
(beat) Alright, ten minutes
Derek hangs up, stands up, and puts the Cell Phone in his pocket
(guessing at the purpose of the call, completely frustrated) Great
That was Tess
Said  had to come back in
Are you fucking Tess
What
No
Look,  gotta go
'll see you at Carter's when  get off
Derek takes another bite, gets up and heads for the door
'm not dropping this
Since when do you drop anything
Derek exits as Heather's eyes hang on him
You see that
He practically said yes
Heather gets up and walks in the direction of Derek's bedroom
Allison instinctively rises and follows
What're you doing
'm gonna look through his shit
' ,  -- Heather walks over to the bed and starts rifling through the mess on the nightstand
She picks up a tube of  and nonchalantly throws it on the bed
67 You're finally flipping,  think
You're a lot of help, Ally
Really
Thanks
Heather opens the nightstand drawer and immediately pulls out a box of , showing them to Allison
(') See
See
So what
Condoms
Ally, 'm on the fucking pill
He hasn't used condoms with me for weeks
So maybe those are left-overs
Ally, these are not left-overs
He never used regular condoms with me
(caught off guard) Why not
Because if he did, he took two fucking days to come
always made him wear ultra-thin, ribbed, anything but this shit
He took too long for you
Ally, 'd be done, and 'd have to lie there like another hour 'till he got off
couldn't fucking stand it
Why the hell do you think  started on the pill, Ally
Me
Putting that hormone shit in my body
How would  know
Well that's why
(remembering) Anyway, that's neither here nor fucking there
That asshole is using 68 (re Condoms) these things, and not on me
Just call him and ask him
No, no, fuck that
We're going to go to the party, have some fun
When he's all good and drunk, you're going to ask him when 'm not around
Yeah right
Ally, 'm serious
If he's drunk and having fun, and you just work it in on him real casual, he may slip
He'll never admit shit to me
He won't to me either
Ally
Just fucking try it
don't wanna spy on him for you
Ally, look, he's cheating on me,  know it in my heart, but  want him to admit it, alright
Before  fucking flush what's left of this shithole relationship down the toilet,  want him to admit it
Fine, 'll see
Fine
-- Jimmy is sitting in an alley behind the pizza shop, finishing a with plenty of ice
Kwon emerges from the back door of the pizza shop
Jimmy sees Kwon, and hides his displeasure as best he can
Hey, Jimmy

Hey
Until  find the drugs, everyone is a suspect
Jimmy's Cell Phone rings
(') (regarding the call) Fuck that
Let's look in your car
Jimmy reaches into his pocket, but instead of a cell phone, he pulls out his car , which he tosses at Kwon
Kwon storms off, and Jimmy grabs his   out of his other pocket and answers it
Hey, it's Jimmy
' ,  -- Dave is standing in front of finishing up blending a  , holding a   to his ear
Cut back and forth between Jimmy and Dave
70 Hey man, it's Dave

Turned out to be an okay guy
gave him a call and he's definitely lookin'
For how much
Dave, having walked into the living room, takes a seat on the couch next to the   we saw earlier, her head now bandaged
She is snorting a line of  off of the coffee table
Well, he's pretty small time, but he's itchin' to move up a few notches
He's got money
He talks so much shit it's hard to tell
You need to talk to him
Jimmy considers, then pulls a  and his   out of his pocket
He turns the Delivery List over to write on the back
71 Gimme his number, man
-- The doors of Jimmy's -- are flung wide open
Kwon is hauling Jimmy's spare  out of the trunk
Kwon, what the hell are you doing
Kwon dumps the Tire on the ground and, seeing nowhere to hide anything, stands straight up and looks at Jimmy
When you off work
Don't know
Maybe nine or nine-thirty
Kwon tosses Jimmy his  back, jumps in his , and takes off
Jimmy becomes increasingly resolved as he watches him leave
Jimmy pulls out his Delivery List and his Cell Phone
He turns the Delivery List over to the number on the back and punches it into his Cell Phone
He paces as he talks
' Hello
Is this Sinjin
' Yeah, who's this
This is Jimmy
Juicehead Dave's friend
' Yeah,  know

He spots  walking toward the gate to the pool area

Pete shuts off the blade and steers the Lawn Mower over to Corey, stopping just short of him
72 (') Where the hell have you been

You have a job here, Corey

(hopping off the Lawn Mower) Just finish up what 'm doing, then take care of the fertilizer spill in the utility room
Okay, alright,  will
Corey hops on the Lawn Mower, turns on the blade, and picks up where Pete left off
Pete shakes his head in disgust and heads into the garage
Corey is wide-eyed as he turns the corner entering the last leg of his first lawn lap and spots  approaching in his   with the  hitched to the back of it
He shuts the blade off and steers the Lawn Mower over to the tow truck
Pedro parks as Corey hops off the Lawn Mower
(') You got your job back

(looking back at the Mustang) Ah, el Mustang

Corey looks over at Emily, laying down in a lounge chair
(') So you in or out
Hey, Emily
Get your stuff
Asi me gusta, now you're being smart
Where are we going
Just get in the truck
Corey heads toward the garage
Emily looks over at Pedro sitting in the Tow Truck
Pedro sticks his hand up to say hello to Emily, awkward
She ignores him and begins gathering her stuff

You done already
Corey hops off the Lawn Mower

'll come in early tomorrow and finish
He runs out the door
Hey
(running out the door) Sorry
The door slams shut behind Corey
' ,   -- Music is audible from inside the house
Carter's house is an old dilapidated house, with a tiny front yard and huge back yard surrounded by trees, with rusty old cars scattered throughout
Just about everybody enters the house from the back
, in his early twenties, very large and athletic, wearing mesh shorts and a beat-up t-shirt, and a  , of a similar age with an average build and dressed lazily in khakis and an un-tucked shirt, are unloading a  from the bed of a -  onto a dolly
and  are standing on the back porch
Heather is holding a bottle of  in her hand
Heather bangs on the screen door
approaches
In his early twenties, Carter is tough, with a modestly athletic build and a gruff voice, and possessing an appetite for greasy food and cheap beer
He's a guy's guy
What's up
Heather tries to open the screen door - it's stuck
Hey Carter
Carter slams the handle from the inside - the door opens
What's up
75 (busting Carter's chops with a mocking tone) What's up
As Heather passes, Carter mockingly shows Heather the back of his hand as if to smack her
Heather and Allison pass, and Carter holds the door open with his foot as he looks for something to prop it open
' ,  -- From the inside we can see that Carter's house is the same house that Jerry moved out of this morning - Jerry was Carter's housemate
Heather and Allison walk in as if they know their way around
Carter spots a large clay   on the back porch
He reaches for it
Stay outta my room
Heather holds out the vodka
Wanna shot
Later
wanna see how crazy it gets
Skirt
Carter props the screen door open with the Lawn Dwarf
' ,   -- ,  and , now wearing the  , are parked in the   across the street from the front of Carter's house
Porno magazines lie on the dashboard and the floor
, walking along the side of the house from the back yard, spots Pedro behind the wheel
He approaches
(to Corey, disapproving) can't believe you're doing this
(aside to Pedro) Ya think it's a good idea we leave it out here on the street like this
(aside to Corey) Forget about that, mehn
(referring to Berubi) 76 'll talk to Berubi
know what to say to this guy
Don't worry
Hey, Pedro, what's up with the Mustang
Berubi motions to the  hitched to the back of it
Que
Ah, el Mustang
Pedro starts to climb out of the Tow Truck
Yeah
Nada
'm doing a favor for a friend
So you're driving around with his car hitched to your tow truck
Pedro shuts the door to his Tow Truck and pulls up his shorts
Bueno, he's a good friend
Sounds good
Come on an' grab a beer
(to Berubi) Hey, listen, can  sleep on your couch
Kimmock's got couch
Come on, mehn, we're in trouble here
We got thrown out of our home
You got evicted
Si
went out to get a gallon of milk for my dog,  come back, my keys don't work, and the cocksucker put an eviction notice on the door
He didn't even tell us
Now my milk's spoiling in my truck, Pancho's probably pissing all over the place, 'm fucked
77 Hey, listen, if you want, you can crash in Jerry's room
He moved out
He did
Don't park there
Park in back
Si, si
No problem, mehn

Corey sticks his hand up to say hello
'  -- Carlos's  is parked in street in front of Carter's house, just down the street from where Pedro has parked, but on the opposite side of the street and facing in the opposite direction
Through the windshield, we see Berubi head back toward the house as Pedro glances at Jessica, now showered and dressed in a yellow tank-top, before climbing back into the Tow Truck and pulling back out onto the road
Carlos has noticed Pedro, but Jessica, silent as she stares at the house, has not
Finally, Carlos speaks up
Did you know he was having a party
Jessica grabs the rear view mirror and aims it toward herself
She begins fixing her hair in the mirror
She pulls her  out of her  and begins to apply it as Carlos watches
She puts her Lipstick away and stares at Carter's house another moment
She checks to see that her  are still hanging on the front of her shirt
Let's go
' ,   -- Jessica climbs out of the car and shuts the door
Carlos follows suit
They move around the side of the house toward the back porch
Jessica stops in her tracks and turns to face Carlos
Wait here a second and let me talk to him
78 Without waiting for a response, Jessica turns around and climbs onto the back porch, walking its length toward Carter, who is kneeling with his back to us as he puts a  on the
Carlos stands watching, not sure what to do
(') What're you doing
Carter turns around, and seems disappointed to see her
(') You need a hand
'm done
Carter climbs to his feet and heads toward the back door, shaking off his hands, passing right by Jessica
Jessica pulls her Sunglasses from her shirt
Carter,  brought your sunglasses back
Carter turns and grabs the Sunglasses
Those were Jerry's anyway
Carter heads into the house
Jessica follows Carter, and we follow Jessica
' ,  -- Oh
You didn't tell me that
Is he pissed
Who gives a shit
He moved out
Carter,  gotta talk to you for a sec
gotta wash my hands
Carter is just not interested in talking with Jessica, even if he didn't have other things on his mind
Carter enters bathroom, but Jessica follows persistently
' ,  -- Carter turns on the sink and washes his hands
79 got a problem
Yeah
It's Aaron, that asshole
He's pissed at me
So what am , a goddam marriage counselor
No, but Aaron hit me, and he's gonna do it again
He hit you
Jessica sees that Carter has finally shown some interest
Yes
Like, he slapped you
No, he punched me
With his fist, a bunch 'a times
Why
What'd you do
didn't do shit
Look,  ain't gonna sit here all night
Tell me what happened
None 'a your bullshit
Aaron thinks  cheated on him
This strikes Carter
Why's he think that
It doesn't matter
80 Fine
Carter starts to walk out, but Jessica stops him
Alright, alright
He caught something - he got a rash or something
He says gave it to him
He's got a rash
Are you fuckin' kiddin' me
What the hell'd he catch
Fuckin' herpes
Carter
Carter notices that the door to the bathroom is still open
Although music is blasting outside, and it is unlikely that anyone could hear their conversation, Carter closes the door and locks it
What the hell'd you give him
Nothing
He's fulla shit
did not cheat on him
Fuckin'
You slept with me, like, three weeks ago
That was the only time, that once, and there's no way he knows
And you have something
No
Are you fucking listening to me
And you wore a condom anyway
What the fuck do you care
Whatever, Jess, what-the-fuck-ever
And 'm sure 'm the only one
Look, don't even get into the cheating thing, 'cause you're seein' Rachel still
Don't call me the slut
81 Look, 'm not gettin' into it with you
'm through with that bullshit
Fine
Just,  need your help with Aaron
Just help me this one last time, that's it
He's probably gonna be here tonight, Aaron
You're kidding
You barely even know who he is
No, but  know Troy real good
He said he'd be bringin' him
ain't got nothin' against Aaron, so  said "what the hell
" Look, can you just kick his ass for me
Please
Shit, Jess,  don't wanna be fightin' no friend 'a Troy's
Can't you just work this shit out
Carter, he hit me
And sprayed me with pepper spray
What the hell
Carter contemplates, and Jessica realizes that the best thing to do is keep silent and let Carter's good side take over
(') Look, if he tries anything tonight, 'll do something
What'll you do
Whadda you mean what'll  do
(facetious) 'm gonna dance with him
Fuckin' 'll beat his ass
don't wanna, but if he shows up tonight and makes like he's gonna hit you, 'll beat his ass
82 What if he doesn't come
Troy said he was bringin' him
If he doesn't, call him or somethin'
But 'm not a fuckin' bounty hunter whose gonna chase Aaron across the goddam country
Jessica is not completely satisfied, but Carter has decided what he's going to do, and that's that
(') Alright
Alright, fine
You're welcome
Carter exits, leaving the door open, but Jessica doesn't follow

He climbs out, slides his    into his pocket, and walks toward the house, his  strapped over both shoulders like a schoolboy

They jump up from the table and approach Jimmy
Jimmy pulls three small bags of  out of his
Allison pulls out some
Thirty bucks

You got nine
Jesus Christ
You knew what you asked for

(mock seductive) Can't you just take care of us for tonight
Yes, for thirty bucks
Here then, take nine for one
It's ten
You know what
You need to get laid, Jimmy
Maybe you'd relax a little
Fine
Enjoy your night
Jimmy as he stuffs the Marijuana back in his Backpack and heads into the hallway
Well 'm not going to drop to my knees for a lousy dimebag, so fuck him

' Watching

Okay

Thanks
Are you okay
' Oh, hold on
This is my favorite part
cartoon becomes audible through Jessica's Cell Phone -  has put her phone up to the
Jessica listens impatiently
'  (') Can you hear it
Yeah,  can hear it
(hurriedly) Katie
But Katie has already put her phone up to the  again
Jessica waits, turning to face the door, wondering what's going on the other side of it

Cono ya

Bitch, bitch, bitch
Pedro begins dispensing beer from the
Somebody could see it out there
85 Si, si
Does your pussy hurt
'm serious, Pedro
Who's gonna see it out there by the woods
Everybody who reads tomorrow's paper
Shut up Emily
No, you shut up
Do you know how embarrassing you are
Look, it was bad luck as usual
So what
The car ran out of gas in the driveway
The gage was busted
Everybody at school makes fun of me
And it was way down the block anyway
(to Corey) And then you try to put everything back
mean, God, how stupid can you be
Just shut up, alright
'Cause you don't know shit about anything
The Herald had a picture of the owner laughing at you
Corey drops his  and moves in aggressively, grabbing Emily by the wrists
Listen, 'm sick of your shit
86 (struggling to break free) Get off me
You fucking loser
Emily falls on her ass
No wonder Victor tried to fuck you
Emily stands up, turns around and heads toward the back door leading into the kitchen, storming past a   and passionately kissing each other against a tree in the back yard
We hang on the couple as Emily walks out of frame
As the boy works his way down to her neck, the girl's eyes open for a moment and catch someone watching her
is standing in the kitchen in front of the door looking out onto the back porch, staring at the couple making out, momentarily transfixed
Jimmy's hand is in his pocket, turning his over and over and over
The girl closes her eyes again, and Jimmy is forgotten, the moment lost
Jimmy is alone again, still, as usual
' ,  -- Jimmy scans the cramped kitchen
Partygoers are talking, laughing, carrying on, making out in the way that Partygoers will
Jimmy's gaze wanders mechanically to anther part of the kitchen falls upon the entrance to the living room
The terribly familiar figure, '  , stands tall, proud, talking to several Partygoers, the light behind him adding a regal air to his menacing frame - a transcendent silhouette for a hellish vision
Bobby towers easily over his peers
In his powerful hands he holds a tiny notepad on which he scribbles as his clients eagerly place their bets
, a young African-American early-twenty-something, easily six feet tall, built like a powerlifter, his worn-out t-shirt doing little to hide his powerful frame, appears behind Jimmy
You're Jimmy
Jimmy turns around to face
You're Sinjin
Sinjin said you'd be wearin' a bookbag
They're back here

As  about- faces to lead Jimmy out of the kitchen and deeper into the house, we follow Jessica outside

He is surrounded by several , but isn't talking to any of them
Hey
Where you been
Talking to Carter
Is he gonna help
He said he would
Carlos pulls a pint of  out of his back pocket
Look
Wanna shot
Jessica accepts the Whiskey and takes a long pull
She holds onto the Whiskey without saying anything, and Carlos does not object
She begins to take in the sights and sounds of the party, and notices  leaning against a rusty old washing machine near the as  hands him another
Jessica's  as Corey spots her standing next to Carlos
He continues to stare at Jessica, clearly taken by the sight of her, his eyes locking onto hers
The desperation of their individual struggles is lost for a moment
You want me to talk to her
The moment quickly passes as Corey turns his attention back to Pedro
No
Si
So let's go fix the tire on the Mustang
88 Corey attention is again drawn to the ping pong game, and Jessica takes note
(to Jessica) You wanna play
Carlos motions toward the large kitchen window
Jessica turns to look through it
' ,  -- Jessica and Carlos are staring through the window at the  game taking place at the kitchen table
and  are back at it with the male  they were playing with earlier, as well as  , who has recently joined them
Heather is smoking a Card Player is dealing a round of asshole
All are visibly drunk
(examining her Cards) What's dickhead doing
knew he was lying
Jessica turns toward the steps leading out onto the back yard, and Carlos follows
Heather and Card Player each place one card face- down on the table, exchanging one for the other
(') (to Card Player) This is your best card
ain't happy about it
Shut up and drink, asshole
(to Allison) should call him
Card Player obeys and drinks
He said he'll be here
He's probably got that Tess on all fours, fucking the shit out of her like the skank she is
(thinking about it) No, you're right, fuck him
(throwing three fours down on the table face- up) Drink
Fucking everyone drink

' , '  -- We recognize the room as Jerry's old bedroom, empty except for a bed stripped of it's sheets, a naked pillow, a beat-up dresser with a small  on top of it, and a few posters and scraps of trash that have been left behind

Sinjin has his back to Jimmy, and is bouncing up and down on a rusty old   - his behavior constituting a sharp contrast to his stylish threads
, an overweight, slobbish Caucasian male a few years older than Sinjin, sits in a rickety old  that might creak even more than Sinjin's pogo stick - in Louie's lap rests a
Upon seeing Sinjin and Louie, Jimmy fondles his   nervously
He turns around to watch closing the door behind them
Sinjin
Sinjin spins on the Pogo Stick and spots  and Jimmy standing at the entrance
Sinjin loses his balance and places a foot on the ground
He steps off the Pogo Stick and composes himself after his exhaustive venture
Mr
Pizzaman
What's up
(referring to Jimmy's ) Got any calzones in there
Sinjin tosses the Pogo Stick aside
(') (re the Pogo Stick) It's harder than it looks
Sinjin turns the   over and sits on it while motioning to the bed

walks over to lock the door as Jimmy inches closer into the room
Yo, door don't lock
90 Well you got to stand your big muthafuckin' ass outside then, 'cause ain't nobody comin' in here
Everybody looks at
don't give a shit
steps out and shuts the door behind him
Alright
Jimmy, sit down, sit down
Jimmy is clearly uncomfortable at the sight of these two
like to stand usually
Alright

That legless waste is Louie

It is
Don't be worryin' Louie - he's just here to have a good time

Emily politely moves down to the bottom of the stairs and steps aside
She watches as Female Partygoer 1 and the Partygoer pass by her into the front yard

and    1 are just finishing a point, which Barnes takes easily, as    2 waits his turn
Barnes 91 is skinny but attractive, and has an even more attractive ' watching him play
What the hell are you doing
We got shit to do mehn, important shit
Ping Pong Player 1 steps back and notes Corey approaching
1 Corey
Hey, come beat this asshole
Hey, nineteen-ten, let's go
1 Screw it, you won again
Play Corey
'mon
Becker can't beat me
1 (to Barnes' Girlfriend, handing Corey his paddle) Watch this
Corey steps to the table opposite Barnes, confident, but unenthusiastic
Corey is not playing for the fun of it - somewhere deep down Corey wants to remind himself that he's good at something
Barnes tosses the    to Corey
You serve, Becker
Corey's first serve is wicked - fast and spinning wildly
Barnes has no chance
' Not too good, baby
Pedro stands alongside and watches silently, pensive, his mind distraught over their larger dilemma
Go find Mitch
Pedro leaves obediently
' ,   -- takes another pull from the

92 Take it easy
You got to go back and watch Katie
Don't remind me
Please
You signed up for it
It seemed like a good idea then
Give some crappy advice every once in a while
didn't think it'd be this constant torture, always wanting to do something, go somewhere
'm so sick of it
Some big sister
Jessica takes another drink and looks toward the ping pong table, where Corey is manhandling Barnes, as Ping Pong Player 1, Ping Pong Player 2, Barnes' Girlfriend and various Partygoers look on

He continues on toward the back door leading out onto the back porch

The collection of Partygoers are watching with religious fervor the basketball game playing from the modest  in the room

All those gathered here have an interest in the game, but none as much as '  , who stands back against the far wall though the nobody in the congregation dares venture into his sightline of the television
Partygoers yell in unison at various events displayed on the screen
The door opens, and Pedro peeks into the room
Shut the door
Pedro shuts the door

The coffee table in front of them is filled with plastic  and  , many of which are empty
93 Hey
Fuck

would never
Alright, alright
You little slut
got one for you
(pointing to someone off camera) Right over there in front of the door
Looking down the hallway outside Jerry's bedroom we see  standing against the door
He does not notice the girls looking at him from the living room
(thoughtfully) Well, he's got a nice body
He's a little scary looking
he scares me
You like it, too, you little slut
Whatever
You're the slut
No
No
Alright, okay, yeah
Maybe
(grabbing a bottle of and a Cup) Bring him a drink
Allison grabs for the Vodka, but Heather does not let go

You take that handsome boy one of these other

Do we have any yogurt left

Heather takes another hit of Vodka

Vodka
What're you mixing it with
Vodka
Really

You think  might get you to share a little of that

There's not much left
If you do something nice for me,  might do something nice for you

Oh, now you want to talk to me
While Mitch is searching for an answer, a familiar voice cuts over the background noise
(
) Mitch

Mitch seems a bit disappointed to see him
Hey
We're outside by the woods
We got the Mustang, mehn
It's beautiful
Yeah, 'll be out in a minute

We worked together 'til last week

(dumbfounded) Pedro
what the fuck
Come on, mehn
Come check out the Mustang
Pedro leaves and Mitch follows
Oh shit,  think 'm gonna be sick
96 Allison plops down on all fours, and begins vomiting violently
Heather kneels down next to Allison and pulls her hair back so it doesn't get hit by the vomit
That's nasty
Allison has a few more convulsions
Fuck you
Wanna wash your mouth out
Allison sits up, fixes her hair, then grabs the  from Heather
Allison takes a mouthful, rinses, and spits
Allison then takes a drink
(') My God, Ally

1,    2, ' and various  are gathered around  and Corey functions mechanically - his mind is not on the game
Barnes is openly frustrated as Corey finishes him off
One more

(to Ping Pong Player 2) You guys suck - he'll be at the table all night
1 So let him beat someone else
Corey notices Mitch standing next to Pedro
You're Mitch
Nice ta meet ya

Changing the subject, Male Partygoer 1 pulls a couple of white out of his pocket

We cut back and forth between Derek and Drunk Partygoer

friend 'a Carter's
Oh, yeah, Carter
He's here
Somewhere
Tell him the cops are coming
There's been several noise complaints
What
The cops are coming
Tell Carter
Oh yeah
Okay,  got it
Cops are comin'
Tell Carter

Oh yeah, you already said that
Drunk Partygoer hangs up and turns over to a couple of other Partygoers

The other Partygoers are not impressed - they continue to sit and drink
Drunk Partygoer loses focus and rejoins them

He picks the   up and tosses it in the trunk
It's a good car
It's alright

What do you want for it
Make an offer
Twelve hundred
Twelve hundred
That's nothing
Look, there's a lotta shit that Jeremy's gotta do with it
It's not like he can just switch the fuckin' plates and it's a go
Cono, we got thrown outta our apartment
We need more money
Steal some more cars
'll see what  can do
Mitch polishes off his Beer and holds the empty cup up
101 (') You want another
' ,   -- and  step out onto the back porch and spot  and Upon seeing them, Carlos stands straight up
Aaron's here
Jessica, still pacing, stops in her tracks and turns around beside Carlos
It's too late to gracefully exit, so Carlos stands there frozen
Jessica does not seem afraid
Aaron and Troy approach
It's clear Troy doesn't really want to be there
(to Carlos) Hey guy
Hey
You like talking to my girl
Aaron,  didn't mean nothin'
No
Just friends
Yeah
What's the matter, don't like her that way
Carlos painfully does not answer
Jessica, unfazed, takes another hit of
Jessica is confident because of the booze and because of Carter's promise
Jessica and Aaron begin arguing in calm "'m above this" mannerisms
(') (to Carlos) Go 'head, take her home
Fuck 'er brains out
She'll give you a little surprise
Carlos simply stands there, ashamed of his inability to act
102 Fuck you, 'm clean
You're the cheatin' asshole with bumps on your cock
(to Troy) Hold this
Aaron hands his beer to Troy and then grabs the Whiskey Jessica is holding
Jessica flinches as if afraid Aaron would hit her
(') Better wipe this off good
You never know
Aaron uses his shirt to vigorously rub the mouth of the bottle before taking a long pull
The Whiskey is almost gone
Jessica grabs back the Whiskey, wipes it off as Aaron did, and polishes it off
(') You're good at that
You ready yet to go bang some dude
Maybe Carlos here
Fuck you
'm going to get Carter, and he's gonna kick your ass
Carter ain't gonna kick shit
We'll see, right
Jessica moves to leave, but Aaron grabs her arm
Hold on a minute
Jessica smashes the bottle over Aaron's head, knocking Aaron to the floor in a daze
That's for the pepper spray, asshole
The  in the back yard are now fixed on Jessica and Aaron

What's goin' on
She smashed a whiskey bottle over his head
103 He grabbed me
'm not gonna sit and wait until he hits me again
He can just keep his fuckin' hands off me
He grabbed her
Troy shrugs his shoulders
guess so
It wasn't a big deal
(recovering, to Jessica) You're dead
See
Jess, you hit him with a bottle
Before he fucking hit me
(to Carter) Look,  ain't got no problem with you
Fine
You touch her, and  promised her 'd beat the livin' piss outta you
'll do it
Lay off
Aaron sits up against a tree, his hands to his head
Carter starts to leave
Carlos feels even more ashamed that Carter stepped in and did something that Carlos did not have the courage to do himself
(to Aaron) You're lucky
Jessica grabs Carter by the shirt
Carter, what the hell
You said you were gonna kick his ass
said  would step in if he hit you, and he's not gonna hit you
104 This is fuckin' bullshit
Jessica winds up and stomps Aaron in the groin
Aaron growls in pain and doubles over
(in awe of Jessica's ferociousness) Woe, dude
(to Jessica) Jessica
What the fuck are you doing
If you're not man enough to do what you said,  will
Jess, 'm not gettin' into this
'm sicka' this bullshit with you
You bring this shit on yourself

Carter leaves, followed by Berubi
Jessica watches them leave
She turns down to Aaron
You know what
don't need Carter
What're you gonna do, tough guy
(still recovering) Why don't you give me a minute and see
Fuck you, you had your minute
Jessica storms toward Carlos' , and Carlos follows

Heather is stroking Allison's hair
They're both obliterated and just stuttering away
'm all talk
can't cheat on Derek love Derek
It's just that he makes me so mad
And that makes me a psycho
Every time a girl loses her temper, she's a 105 fucking psycho
Can't  be upset without being a psycho
Can't  just be mad
It's just every time you find a woman near Derek, you go absolutely nuts
Let's not use the word nuts, alright
You know what  mean
Yeah, well, don't say nuts
Alright, you are mighty, mighty
not very nice when another girl is near your boyfriend
Don't say nuts, don't say psycho, don't- (interrupting) don't say those things
Yes you do
Yes you do
What  meant,  don't mean them
meant that  don't mean them
That  don't mean to say them
Well, what do you mean
don't know
mean, you get so angry, it's a little scary
Allison sits up on the couch
Heather sits up directly facing Allison, her hands on Allison's lap
(') get scared when you get all angry
You get so mad sometimes, you start doing things, saying things to hurt people
Around you
106 (starting to cry) Oh,  don't mean to
'd never say anything to hurt you, Ally
(also starting to cry) know
Deep down,  know
But you get so angry
'm so sorry
Oh, you're right

rotten-bitch-psycho
scare you - Ally - who would never hurt anyone or, or anything
It's alright,  know you don't mean it
Heather hugs Allison, who hugs back
Both are bawling as they embrace
don't mean it
You're my best friend
My sister
love you so much
No, maybe you shouldn't
Maybe  don't deserve it
You deserve it
You're so perfect
Don't say that
'm not, 'm not
Yes you are
on Heather and Allison
The noise of the party drowns out their conversation
Allison is whispering forcefully into Heather's ear
Heather is listening, but cannot hear
We see her lips form the word "what
" Allison continues whispering, and Heather's face becomes furious
She pushes Allison back
(') You fucking slut
Heather shoves Allison hard off the couch
As Allison stumbles roughly and attempts to recover, , mostly guys, gather around, cheering wildly
Heather kicks furiously at Allison, who is on all fours employing the turtle defense
We catch a glimpse of Allison's face - she is in utter panic
Heather's foot catches Allison square in the face, knocking her limp
107 Most of the crowd has stopped cheering
Heather continues to kick at Allison's limp body, and two   pull Heather away
Heather shakes them off and leaves in a huff, while everyone is tending to Allison

Sure,  don't give a shit
Fucking great, let's go
Heather heads towards Berubi's bedroom, and  follows, passing and '
Jimmy looks back at  as he passes

The room is empty
What the fuck Jimmy
Just hold on
Jimmy steps further into the room and stands pensive as Bobby takes a seat
Bobby lights up a
can't figure you Jimmy
(
) Where the fuck is
The door bursts open again with a violent thrash, and  fires into view on his  with  pushing from behind
Take it easy you stupid motherfucker
108 Sinjin kicks the door shut with the back of his foot and wheels Louie into the room
Louie is holding a half-full bottle of in his hand, the    still in his lap
This your partner
Where you been
Just gettin' a drink, Jimmy
You took long enough
Sinjin wheels Louie in a haphazard, indirect arc somehow closing on the center of the room
The doorknob rattles
(') (to Louie) Thought that shit didn't lock
Sinjin is staring at the door, but Louie is pre-occuppied
(to Bobby) You're Buggerin' Bobby Bales
Excuse me you cripple motherfucker
Buggerin' Bobby Bales
Sayeed knows you
Call me that again
Louie takes a strong pull from the bottle of Jack
Louie, shut the fuck up
Let's just do this
Call you what again
What everyone calls you
Yeah
Call me that
Buggerin' Bobby Bales
Bobby stands, tosses his Cigarette aside, and marches toward Louie
Sinjin knowingly looses his grip on the Wheelchair and steps back
109 Bobby, let's relax now
Louie may be a fool
Bobby grabs Louie by the collar and throws him from the Wheelchair
Louis lands heavily on his crippled frame, dazed, the Bowling Ball Bag dribbling onto the floor near Sinjin
Bobby grabs the Wheelchair in both hands and begins smashing it against the wall and into the floor
As Jimmy and Sinjin watch, dumbfounded, the large clay   we saw earlier bursts trough the window and lands in the center of the room
Everyone stops to stare at the Lawn Dwarf, including Bobby
' ,   -- storms through the yard toward Carlos'
is right behind
Where'd we park
Over here
Carlos begins walking over to his , and Jessica walks alongside
Jessica is clearly drunk
Passing by a now high  backed up against a tree staring off into nowhere as   1 kisses her neck, they arrive at Carlos' Car
Carlos walks over to the driver-side door, but Jessica walks immediately over to the trunk
(') What are you doing
Get in
Open the trunk
Jess, let's get out of here
want your bat
Screw that
'm gonna finish what  started
'm gonna knock his teeth out
Let's just go home
Carlos, open the trunk
110 Carlos grudgingly obeys
He walks back to the trunk and inserts his , then lifts up
Jessica reaches in and grabs a wooden baseball She shuts the trunk and looks over to the house
walks through Carter's front door and steps onto the porch, right behind
Aaron is holding a bag of   to his head in the area where Jessica hit him with the whiskey bottle
He spots Carlos and Jessica, and walks deliberately toward them
Get in the car
'm staying, and so are you, so shut up
Carlos swallows his pride, too yellow to push the point
Aaron moves toward Jessica very quickly, but a look at the bat Jessica is holding makes Aaron keep his distance
(') What's the matter
Aren't you gonna put me in my place
(calming down) Why don't you put that down
Because 'm gonna use it to bash your head in
You really want to do that
You really wanna make me
You're gonna do what you're gonna do, like always
What the hell's that supposed to mean
Let me show you something
Can  show you
What
111 (inching closer to Jessica and beginning to loosen his pants) just wanna show you something
Jessica stands back and holds the bat in a cocked position
No more 'a this shit, Aaron
Just stand back there
'll bash you with this, swear
Aaron drops the Frozen Vegetables to the ground and loosens his pants
Look, just hold on
wanna show you this
got it a little while ago, for your birthday
Aaron lowers the left side of his pants to reveal a scarring , which is placed above and to the side of his groin
Jessica looks closer
Troy, uncomfortable and not wanting to be there, lights up another
(') Can you see it
What the hell is it
It's
got it for your birthday
(not knowing what to say) Bullshit
Will you come closer and look
Troy, tell her
(to Jessica) It's your initials
told him it was stupid
Jessica lowers the Bat and walks cautiously up to Aaron
She attempts to read the Tattoo, which is difficult because of the low light and the scarring
You like it, don't you
knew you would
112 You're an idiot
know
Jessica touches the Tattoo
Does that hurt
No
Try whacking it with the bat
Jessica laughs as Aaron smiles
Troy is bored
Carlos is miserable
Jessica stands up in front of Aaron, holding the Bat loosely by her side, unsure of what to do
Aaron gently grabs Jessica around the elbows and pulls her close
He puts his arms around her and hugs her loosely
(') Can we just forget about this
Yes
Aaron hugs Jessica tightly as she drops the Bat and hugs back
Happy birthday
Thank you

thought you'd tell me
It looks like police cherries
It can't be
Look fellas, 'd like to help you out, but 'm not into buying stolen cop cars
It don't seem right somehow
Corey and Pedro struggle for an explanation, but are left speechless

They look very calm

Fine, you say so, fine
That's it
Well what the hell can  do
There's nothin'

It was a stupid thing to do
You don't like it
Well of course  like it
