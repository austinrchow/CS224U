We are    a darkened penthouse window next to the clock
The window starts to open
(
) Well, almost evvybody
They's a few lost souls floatin' 'round out there
young man is crawling out of the window onto the ledge
With the opening of the window, "  " filters out with greater volume
(
) This one's Norville Barnes
The man gingerly straightens up on the ledge
He is perhaps in his late twenties
He wears a leather apron
Printed on the apron: "  /The Future is Now

We   ,

) That office he jes stepped out of is the office of the president of Hudsucker Industries
It's his office
Norville sways in anguish as the  of the  grows louder and the  blows in his face
(
) How'd he get so high
An' why is he feelin' so low
Is he really gonna do it -- is Norville really gonna jelly up the sidewalk
Norville is tensing his body, peering out over the ledge, preparing to make a swan dive into oblivion -- but the ' continued  is  him
We are    the enormous , whose becomes very loud indeed
(
) Well the future, that's something you can't never tell about
The second hand of the clock is nearing the twelve -- bare seconds to midnight

He pauses, sets it down
Fresh-faced, eager --
He is gazing off at: The sign is over a ground floor office; an exterior clock shows 9:00
curtain is just being pulled open in its picture window to reveal a great job board
It is like the departures board in a great train station, with each of its individual entries flipping over occasionally to reveal a new opportunity
On offer are jobs like:  , , - , , etc
On the small crowd gathered to, like Norville, watch the board -- men in search of jobs, of various classes and vocations, but alike in their intent gaze, their hands dug into their pockets, their hats pushed back on their heads, bobbing occasionally to get a better view of the chattering board
Men occasionally head for the office as they see a prospect they like
Norville stands pat, watching

His chin is sunk disconsolately into his palm
His hat is pushed back dejectedly on his head
He idly stirs his coffee with his spoon
He takes one last gulp of the coffee, then sets the cup down on the want ads, stands, and digs into his pocket for change, turning it inside-out
As Norville puts all his change on the counter
His hand hesitates; he takes a little of it back

The newspaper eddies around some more, then plasters against Norville
He peels it off and is about to toss it away but stops, noticing something
It is a section of the want ads
One entry is perfectly circled by a coffee stain
He looks up from the paper
There is purpose in his gaze
Wind whips his hair

Savoring a pause, the Executive looks around the board table

This draws an appreciative chuckle from the board
It is cut off by: Ahem
The board turns expectantly to Hudsucker, who sits in the f

Beyond him is the length of the board table and the large picture window
He rises to his feet, slowly and deliberately, and rubs his palms together
He swings his chair out

The heads of the board members swing up in unison

Its street number tops its imposing entryway in large gilt letters: 285
We continue   the length of the skyscraper, to reveal a huge clock capping its facade
Above the clock is the identification "

Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh
Somewhere in the Hudsucker Building

As we hear   of the

As Hudsucker shoots past the window, his draft sends the stack of papers wafting this way and that

At the far end of the table, Hudsucker's chair is empty and oddly askew
His cigar still smokes in its ashtray
There are dust footprints down the middle of the long oak table
One Executive sits with a pluming cigarette held halfway to his mouth; another holds a carafe suspended on its way to his water glass; another holds his spectacles inches from his nose
We hear only the  of the
at the window
He is a tall middle- aged executive with lean and rugged good looks and a commanding presence
He knocks a last piece of glass out of the sill with his knuckle, looks out, grunts, and draws his head back in
The   him  the room
The other board members' heads swivel to watch him, all staring, searching desperately for some hint as to the fate of their fallen leader
Apparently, some absurd hope still lingers
Mussburger perches on the board table by his own chair
He reaches over to pluck the smoking cigar from the suicide's ashtray
Pity to waste a whole Monte Cristo
The other board members unfreeze, their worst fears confirmed
He could've opened the window
Waring Hudsucker never did anything the easy way
My God, why
Why did he do it
Things were going so well
What am  a headshrinker
Maybe the man was unhappy
He didn't look unhappy
Yeah, well, he didn't look rich
Waring Hudsucker was never an easy man to figure out
(reminiscing) He built this company with his bare hands
Every step he took was a step up
Except of course this last one
Sure, sure, he was a swell guy, but when the president, chairman of the board and holder of eighty-seven percent of the company's stock drops forty-four floors -- Forty-five -- Counting the mezzanine -- -- Then the company has a problem
Stillson, what exactly is the disposition of Waring's stock
Well, as you know, Hud left no will and had no family
The company bylaws are quite clear in that event
His entire portfolio will be converted to common stock and will be sold over the counter as of the first of the fiscal year following his demise
Meaning
Meaning simply that Waring's stock, and control of the company, will be available to the public on January first
You mean to tell me that any slob in a smelly -shirt will be able to buy Hudsucker stock
Stillson shrugs
The company bylaws are quite clear
My God
You're animals
How can you discuss his stock when the man has just leapt forty-five floors -- Forty-four -- -- Not counting the mezzanine
Quit showboating, Addison, the man is gone
The question now is whether we're going to let John
Public waltz in and buy 87 percent of our company
- What're you suggesting, Sidney
Certainly we can't afford to buy a controlling interest
Not while the stock is this strong
How long before Hud's paper hits the market
January first
Thirty days
Four weeks
month at the most
One month to make the blue-chip investment of the century look like a round-trip ticket on the Titanic
We play up the fact that Hud is dead
(in unison) Long live the Hud
We depress the stock -- -- to the point where we can buy fifty-percent
Fifty-one
Not counting the mezzanine
It could work
It should work
It would work
(at ticker tape machine) It's working already
Waring Hudsucker is abstract art on Madison Avenue
All we need now is a new president who will inspire real panic in our stockholders
Yeah, a puppet

Mussburger strides across the room from the still and lowers himself into Waring Hudsucker's chair
He takes a last puff from his cigar and slowly exhales a cloud of smoke
Sure, sure

He wears a brass-buttoned uniform, white gloves and a pillbox hat
The name  is stitched onto his breast pocket
As Norville enters the elevators: Hiya, buddy
The name is Buzz,  got the fuzz
He lifts his pillbox hat to reveal a white crewcut, then lets the elastic chin strap snap the cap back down onto his head
make the elevator do what she duzz
He holds out his hand but as Norville reaches to shake it he snaps it away and pats down his crewcut: Hang it up to dry
He cackles and powers the  into

Norville looks to one side
workman in painter's overalls squats in front of a pair of heavy oak doors
With a razor blade he is scraping off the name "
" Mr
Mussburger's office
The scraper looks sullenly over his shoulder at Norville
With a jerk of his thumb he indicates the direction
Norville enters the adjacent office
Two secretaries are in Mussburger's outer reception office
The first is a filing secretary who stands frozen in the f
g
, her hand poised over an open drawer to deposit a folder, as she stares at Norville with an amused and supercilious sneer which stays pasted on throughout
The second secretary -- the  -- is seated behind a desk in the b

that flanks the door to Mussburger's private office
The Receptionist sits with her hands clasped on the desk, staring at Norville with the hunch-shouldered down-from-under look of a patient vulture
Do you have an appointment
Uhh, no,  -- The filing secretary sneers
Shall we look in the book, hmmmmmmmmm
She opens an enormous leather-bound book with yellowed crinkly pages
No, ma'am, ya see,  wouldn't be in the -- We don't seem to be in the boooook
Norville is groping in his apron pocket
No, ma'am, ya see  don't have an -- If we had an appointment we'd be in the booook
know but ya see  have this -- here it is, this letter -- low, unearthly  fills the room, the sound of a million souls moaning in purgatory
The Receptionist looks up
who is no longer sneering

that Norville holds innocently at his side
As her wail becomes deafening and we   her mouth and the    and: The blackness and the wailing are both cut short by the sound of a

The door closes behind Norville
We hear a rhythmic -- and the  of ' Across miles of carpet is a huge executive desk, behind which is a large executive chair facing the window
From above the back of the chair cigar smoke wreathes up

He swivels around to face Norville, who stands deferentially at the door
Still listening at the phone, Mussburger waves Norville forward
No
Not McClanahan; sure he bungled the Teleyard merger, but that means he's got something to prove
He covers the mouth piece

We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends

Well it's not bad enough

(into the second phone) And that goes double for you
(into the first phone) Ear-clay
(into both phones) Ood-gay
(slams down both phones, looks at Norville) This better be good
'm in a bad mood
Norville clears his throat
Well, sir
've got something for you from the mailroom, but first if could just take a minute or so from your very busy time
He reaches into his mailroom apron and hands a scrap of paper across the desk to Mussburger, who stares, frozen, at Norville, making no move to take the paper
to show you a, uh
Norville, undaunted, holds up the paper since Mussburger will not take it
Mussburger doesn't even look at it; his eyes are locked on Norville's
Mussburger smolders
a little something 've been working on for the last two or three years
Mussburger's burning eyes finally shift momentarily to look at the crudely drawn circle; he looks back incredulously at Norville
You know, for kids
Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case 'd say it's at least twice that, but  gotta tell ya, Mr
Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby -- Wait a minute
Sudden quiet
With one last click the perpetual motion ball bearings abruptly stop
As Mussburger's eyes burn in on him, Norville stands mute and paralyzed
His eyes locked on Norville's, Mussburger circles the desk
He stands toe-to-toe with Norville
He thrusts his face into Norville's, whose head moves reflexively back
Mussburger's nose is almost touching Norville's, his eyes are burning, searching, studying, evaluating
Finally he draws his head back
Hmmm
With one hand he thrusts his cigar into Norville's gaping mouth
With his other hand he raises Norville's chin so that his teeth clench it
Umm-hmm
He steps back, eyes still on Norville
He jerks his thumb over his shoulder, indicating his chair behind the desk
Siddown
Norville, his lips puckered around the unaccustomed ciger, looks bemusedly from the chair to Mussburger
Go ahead
Try it on
Norville obeys, reluctantly, stiffly
Put your feet up
Norville is again reluctant
Go ahead
Norville obeys
Mussburger studies
Hmmmm
Let's get to know one another, shall we
Norville's eyes squint against the cigar smoke wreathing from between his teeth
Mussburger seems to relax
Let's chat
(beams) Man to man
Norville beams
You weren't blessed with much
He waves vaguely towards his head and searches for a euphemism
education, were you
Well, 'm a college graduate -- All right, but you didn't excel in your studies
Well,  made the dean's list
(worried) Hmmm
Norville sputters out some more cigar smoke
At the Muncie College of Business Administration
(relieved) Sure, sure
And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or
(searches again) 'schmoe'
Norville shakes his head
'Shnook'
'Dope'
'Dipstick'
'Lamebrain'
No, sir
Not even behind your back
Sir
They voted me most likely to succeed
(curtly) You're fired
But, sir
-- Get your feet off that desk
As he struggles to comply: But -- Get out of my sight
Norville, squinting against the cigar smoke, pulls the cigar out of his mouth as he doubles forward, feet still up, groping for a place to set down the cigar
He sets it blindly on a loose stack of papers
My God
The Bumstead contracts
Oh my God, sir
The top page radiates a circle of incipient flame from the cigar's live end
You nitwit
worked for three years on this deal
Oh my God, sir
Norville runs across the office to a large water cooler
'll take care of it
Just get out
Mussburger plucks the cigar off the contract and tosses it into a wastebasket
He pats the fingertips of one hand against his tongue and then efficiently pats out the crinkling orange circle on the top sheet of the contract
At the other end of the office, Norville is wrapping his arms around the glass water tank, which he pulls off its base
He runs back across the vast expanse of office toward the desk, hugging the water tank whose  - out its open bottom and splashes down onto his pumping knees
As he reaches the desk, the near-empty tank is now light enough for him to hoist with one arm, which he does, and cups his other hand under it to catch its last glub of water
He tosses the  to the floor where -- -- it , and stands looking about for a place to dump his handful of water
Why you nitwit
You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career
Oh my God, sir
He is reacting to the wastebasket on his side of the desk, which Mussburger cannot see
It is sprouting flame, at which Norville ineffectually flecks his remaining drops of water
Now out of here
Out
Norville is already running to the window, which he runs both palms over, desperately seeking a way to open it
Not that way
Through the door
But, sir
The windows do not open
Norville furiously stomps on the flames in the wastebasket and -- his foot sticks
Further stomping only makes the flaming wastebasket roar up and down with his foot
Right away, buster
Out of my office
Norville has dropped to the floor, trying to wrench the flaming wastebasket off his leg
Up on your feet
We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries
Sir, my leg is on fire
Norville finally succeeds in getting the flaming wastebasket off his foot
Now the problem is what to do with it
Get out of this office, you dithering nincompoop
Norville picks up the flaming trash receptacle
Oh my God, sir
He winds up and throws it through the closed window
The   and the flaming basket plummets to oblivion
With the picture window broken a    through the penthouse office
- On the desk
The pages are sucked away by the draft
My God
The Bumstead contracts
Oh my God, sir
Mussburger lunges for the contracts as they are sucked out the window
He runs, jumps onto the sill, grabs -- his fist clenches around one wafting page -- he is about to fall -- Eeeeeeaaaahhhhh
: , a short, fat, heavily perspiring executive, is screaming at an
secretary
He holds a pot of coffee in one hand and a copy of Boy's Life in the other
No magazine
No coffee
Mussburger
wanna see Mussburger
Or did he jump out a window too
In the window behind him we see loose sheets of paper fluttering down
: Desperately hanging onto Mussburger by his legs
Don't worry, Mr
Mussburger
gotcha
gotcha by your pants
Mussburger's screaming abruptly stops
- ' -   ( ): is in a basement tailor shop
, an old Italian tailor, is just running his tape up Mussburger's inseam
Meester Moosaburger,  give-a you pants a nice-a dooble stitch
Make 'em strong, and they look-a real sharp
(barking) No
Single stitch is fine
(begging) But please-a, Meester Moosaburger, the dooble stitch she last-a forever -- Why on earth would  need a double stitch
To pad your bill
Single stitch is fine
: Damn
We hear a   sound
Mussburger drops a few inches
: (musing to himself) What the heck
Meester Moosaburger such a nice-a guy,  give him dooble steech-a anyway
Assa some-a strong- a steech-a, you bet
' The tearing fabric abruptly catches and stops; the rest of the pants hold intact
sighs with relief
He looks up
Norville's arms are wrapped around Mussburger's ankles; the heels of Mussburger's shoes are digging into his face
Looking
Thinking
Struggling to hold on
Calm
Contemplating
Hmmm
He absently removes a cigar from his breast pocket and sticks it in his mouth
He holds his lighter under the cigar, not noticing that the flame is pointing the wrong way
He looks at Norville
His face drawn with effort, still struggling to hang on
the    , however, that Norville's arms are now wrapped around -- emptiness
Mussburger's legs are gone
Norville throws his head back and laughs, it seems, insanely -- but     that Norville is merely pantomiming the adventure for the benefit of the board members, including Mussburger
They stand around Mussburger's office, laughing gaily
All safe now, no harm done
This inaugurates: Montage silent but for

to reveal that the frozen picture is the newspaper photo on the front page of the Manhattan Argus
Its headline reads:
The subhead reads: Stockholders Wary
The sub-subhead reads: Meteoric Rise From Mailroom
The article is under the byline of Amy Archer
that we are looking at the newspaper  someone's
The person swivels around and away -- his face now  us, we see that it is Norville looking at the newspaper
He throws his head back and laughs merrily
As he laughs -- thwock -- a steaming towel is thrown onto his face and he continues to swivel that he is in a barber chair
His head drops back and    as the swiveling chair is cranked down, but immediately -- still spinning -- -- his head reappears as the chair is cranked up again
Still laughing, Norville is now freshly shaven and has a slicked-back haircut, heavy with pomade
Norville's laughing face
to reveal it is another front page photo next to the headline: Hud Board To Street: Subhead: Has Fresh Ideas
that the paper is lying on a chair
Norville's mailroom apron is tossed onto the chair to cover it
where the apron was tossed from
Norville stands on a tailor's stage, laughing, as the tailor, also laughing, takes his measurements
Norville in shirtsleeves, boxer shorts, hose stockings and garters
The tailor rises, laughing merrily, throwing up his arms and spreading them wide with hands stretching the measuring tape
Norville laughs merrily and also throws his arms up wide
laughs merrily, his arms thrown wide, tickertape stretching between his hands
He joyously tosses away the tickertape
where the tickertape lands on a pile of previously discharged tape
to reveal that the tickertape continues to burp its disastrous tale of good news for the board
to reveal that the machine is in Mussburger's office
At the far end of the room, behind his desk, Mussburger laughs as he looks at a newspaper
him
On his desk the perpetual ballbearings swing; outside his window the sweep second hand of the Hudsucker clock rumbles by, sweeping a shadow across the floor
Evil prevails
As Mussburger opens the newspaper, the shows its front page headline:
Subhead: Just Good Is He
the front page photo: Norville laughing, his chin propped in his hand
and Norville unfreezes, laughing
We are now    him
He sits behind a huge oak desk, newly coifed and tailored
The brass plaque on the desk confirms that he is in the the large elegant office, leaving Norville looking quite small
His   in the bright bare office
Norville's laughter is just winding down, leaving him exhausted, as if he has been laughing nonstop for several days
He finally sighs and wipes a tear from his eye
: : - In the skyline we can see the Hudsucker building topped by the Hudsucker clock
cigar   in the f
g
, then the face of the man smoking it
Staring contemplatively at the Hudsucker building, he takes a puff from the cigar and then plucks it from his mouth and waves it, as if painting a headline
'The Einstein of Enterprise
' 'The Edison of Industry
' 'The Billion- Dollar Cranium'
'Idea Man'
(exploding) And not one of you mugs has given me a story on him
shows the Editors glassed-in office filled with for the staff meeting
Although they listen quietly, they are more bored than attentive
the glass walls we can see the furious activity of an army of reporters, editors, and copy boys waging the never- ending battle to put out a quality daily newspaper
The Editor slams a newspaper down onto his desk in disgust
Facts, figures, charts
They never sold a newspaper
read this morning's edition of the Argus and let me tell you something: 'd wrap a fish in it
'd use it as kindling
Hell, 'd even train my poodle with it if he wasn't a French poodle and more partial to the pages of Paree Soir
But  sure wouldn't shell out a hard-earned nickel to read the dadblamed thing
Come on, chief, give us a break
Suuuure, Tibbs, take a break
Go to Florida
Lie in the sun
Wait for a coconut to drop, file a story on it -- it'll be more of a grabber than your piece on the commie grain surplus
The human angle
That's what sells papers
We need a front page with heart and the whole idea of the 'Idea Man' idea can put it there
#2 Chief, if we had more access -- Yeah, and if a frog had wings he wouldn't bump his ass a-hoppin' don't want excuses,  want results
Whack
-- Without even looking in its direction, the Editor has slammed down the lid of the cigar box on his desk, towards which one Reporter's hand had been idly reaching
The Reporter jerks his fingers away as the Editor spares the briefest moment to glare at him
wanna know what makes the Idea Man tick
Where is he from
Where is he going
wanna know everything about this guy
Has he got a girl
Has he got parents
#3 Everybody has parents
All right, how many
How 'bout it, Parkinson, you've been awful quiet over there
Uhhh
Still waters run deep, chief
The only thing that runs deep with Parkinson is the holes in his ears
Yes, the Idea Man
What're his hopes and dreams, his desires and aspirations
Does he think all the time or does he set aside a certain portion of the day
How tall is he and what's his shoe size
Where does he sleep and what does he eat for breakfast
Does he put jam on his toast or doesn't he put jam on his toast, and if not why not and since when
He thrust his face into that of the Reporter
Well
No answer
Ahh, you're useless
Yes, Idea Man
Creator
Innovator
Cerebrator
Tycoon
-- (
) Fake
Huhh
Star reporter   -- attractive, smartly-dressed
tell ya the guy's a phony
Phony, huh
As a three-dollar bill
Sez who
Sez me
Amy Archer
Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is
What're his ideas
Why won't they let anyone interview him
One Reporter is leaning into another to keep his voice low: Five bucks says she mentions her Pulitzer
Again
You're on
(as she picks up the morning paper) And just take a look at the mug on this guy -- the jutting eyebrows, the simian forehead, the idiotic grin
Why he has a face only a mother could love -- Whack
The Editor has slammed down the cigar box lid again but: Amy, smiling, raises a cigar   having beaten him
She tosses it to the Reporter who failed to get one
On payday
The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al
Yeah, well, monkey or not 'm still editor of this rag
Amy,  thought you were doing that piece on the --
Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry
filed it yesterday
Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy
The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story
All right, chief
We'll do our best, chief
'll give it a shot, chief
(at the door) Al, he's the bunk
Slam
One of the wagering Reporters grins at the other, who is taking out a five dollar bill
The door bursts open and Amy sticks her head in
'll stake my Pulitzer on it
: Sweeping open to reveal the leering face of Buzz, the elevator gnat
Say, buddy
Where'd ya get the new duds
Norville is entering the elevator in his new executive outfit
and say, buddy
How'd old bucketbutt like his blue letter
Na-ha-ha-ha-ha
Did he bust a gut
Did he die
Did he -- Well, hello, Mr
Mussburger, sir
Buzz is instant decorum as Mussburger enters the elevator
How're you this fine morning, sir
Norville has been worriedly patting at his pockets since the mention of the blue letter
That reminds me, Mr
Mu
uh, Sid
never did give you that-- (to Buzz) Lobby
We haven't got all day
Right away, Mr
Mussburger sir
As he talks, Mussburger pats at his suit pocket, takes out a cigar, inspects it
Well 'm starved
understand it'll be quite an affair this afternoon, and the executive roast tom turkey at the Bohemian Grove redefines the word superb
He puts the cigar in his mouth and Buzz's hand is right there with a lighter
My pleasure, sir
Roast tom turkey
Gee, 'm hungry too -- Sure, sure
The elevator doors open
It's been a pleasure serving you, Mr
Mussburger
Buzz turns to Norville
He is puzzled but trying to hide it: and it's been a pleasure serving you too, uh
buddy
is already striding through the lobby; Norville has to lope to catch up
Say, Mr
Muss -- uh, Sid
Shouldn't we be a little bit concerned with the downward spiral of our stock these last few days
mean, you're the expert, but at the Muncie College of Business Administration they told us -- Mussburger gives an artificially hearty laugh and claps Norville on the shoulder
Relax, Norville
It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover
Okay, Sid
Like  said, you're the expert, but -- Norville is still loping behind Mussburger, trying to keep up with his long strides
You don't happen to remember the plan  outlined to you the day  set fire to your off -- uh, the day was promoted
do remember and  was impressed
Anyway, that's all forgotten now
Driver
Thank you, Sid, but the reason mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here -- Damnit, where's my car
-- But there's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class -- black limousine pulls up to the curb
Finally
-- So if you think it's appropriate, 'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch -- Mussburger is getting into the back seat -- Sure, sure, tell whoever you want
And, to Norville's surprise, slamming the door shut behind him
And 'd like to hear more about it at some point, too
-- the  pulls away
Norville is left talking to himself on the empty sidewalk
But, Sid,  thought you and  were
Say, bud, could you keep the sidewalk clear here
But 'm the president of this -- aww, forget it
: cheap coffee shop a half-flight down from the street
We are   an elbow of the coffee shop counter
In the middle b
g
, Norville sits dejectedly stirring a cup of coffee
Behind him,  the window wells, we see the back and forth feet of pedestrians bustling by on the sidewalk
In the extreme f
g
sit two steaming mugs of coffee
They belong to two  of the coffee shop, who, from , narrate the scene
#1 (
) got gas, Bennie
#2 (
) Yeah, tell me about it
#1 (
) No kiddin', Bennie
got gas
#2 (
) Ya get the special
#1 (
) Fah from it
He gives a low whistle under his breath as a woman enters from the street and hesitates by the door, looking around
Still attractive but looking somewhat down-at-the-heels, it is Amy Archer
#1 (
) Enter the dame
#2 (
) There's one in every story
#1 (
) Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout
#2 (
) Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one
#1 (
) She's looking for her mark
The woman's eyes settle on Norville, and she heads for the empty stool next to his
#2 (
) She finds him
#1 (
) She sits down
The woman says something to the counter waitress, who exits
#2 (
) and awduhs a light lunch
#1 (
) She looks in her purse
She is holding her wallet upside down
#2 (
) No money
#1 (
) The mark notices
Beat
Norville, however, is not noticing: He is staring intently at his coffee spoon, his hat pushed back on his head, his other hand propping up a cheekbone; the woman's presence does not seem to have registered yet
#2 (
) He's not noticing, Benny
#1 (
) Maybe he's wise
#2 (
) He don't look wise
#1 (
) Plan two: Here come the waterworks
The woman starts crying
#2 (
) Yellowstone
#1 (
) Old Faithful
#2 (
) Hello, Niagara
#1 (
) He notices
As the woman cries, she accidentally-on-purpose jostles Norville and he finally does indeed notice
#2 (
) He's concerned
The woman mouths words at Norville who reacts sympathetically and waves his hands at the waitress
#1 (
) She explains her perdicament, and
#1 & #2 (
) (in unison) entuh the light lunch
The waitress is entering to set a plate in front of the woman
The woman continues to talk to Norville, smiling wanly at him
#2 (
) She's got other problems, of course
#1 (
) Her mother needs an operation
#2 (
) adenoids
#1 (
) No, Bennie: Lumbago
Veteran #1's enunciation of "lumbago" falls into perfect sync with the woman's moving lips
Norville is listening sympathetically, but he suddenly notices his watch
#1 (
) (alarmed) She's losing him, Bennie
Norville is rising to his feet
#2 (
) Maybe he's wise
#1 (
) He don't look wise
As Norville turns to leave: #2 (
) How does she pull this out
She puts the back of her hand dramatically to her forehead
#1 (
) (disbelieving) She isn't
#2 (
) (thrilled) She is
And indeed she does: Faint dead away, falling backwards on the stool, so that Norville has no choice but to catch her
Norville holds her awkwardly, looking around for help
#1 (
) She's good, Bennie
#2 (
) She's damn good, Lou

They sport extremely bored expressions, topped by "cabbie" caps

#2 Bromo
' Looking at its frosted-glass door; the sign painter is just finishing lettering in:  , President
The sign painter makes way as we see Norville's shadow approaching; even from inside the room we can hear that he is
He is apparently carrying the girl, cradled in his arms
He tries to reach down to get the doorknob; can't manage it; turns to press his back against the door and get the knob with his other hand
The door opens as Norville swings around to enter
He is wheezing like a gas pipe about to explode
He swings around to kick the door shut
We see that the lettering on the door is now terribly smudged; we also see, in wet ink, on the seat of Norville's pants: senraB ellivroN tnediserP
Weakly, still cradled in Norville's arms: 'm sorry we had to take the stairs
It was just that horrible little elevator boy
Not at all
You're light as a feather
(pointing languorously) The couch, please
Still wheezing horribly, Norville staggers over to the couch and deposits her gently on it
He straightens up and looks at her
' She is smiling wanly  the
The entire as the blood pounds behind Norville's eyeballs
We hear the ,  of his , resonating inside his head
Amy is talking but her voice is barely audible, as if coming from a long way away
Just a minute
He perches drunkenly on the edge of the couch and puts his head between his knees, still fighting for breath
don't know what came over me suppose it was the shock of eating after so long without; the enzymes kicking in after so long, or whatever
But then you couldn't possibly know what it is to be tired and hungry
Speaking into his knees as he wheezes: Hungry, anyway
don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story
Norville rises and starts putting throw pillows behind her head
Suffice it to say that 'm jobless -- though not for want of trying, that 'm friendless, with no one to -- thank you -- take care of me; and that had you not come along at just exactly the moment that you did -- She screams, staring down at the couch
Norville jumps, startled, then looks where she is looking
On the white sofa cushion where he had been sitting is printed, in wet ink, right side around:  , President
Norville,  didn't know you were president here
Norville stares dumbfounded at the sofa cushion
When the nickel finally drops, he spins around to try to look at the seat of his pants
Distracted but still modest: Oh, it's nothing really
Just determination and hard work
He unbuckles his trousers
Of course, when  started in the mailroom last Tuesday  thought it might take more time -- Buzz enters holding a brown paper bag
Say, buddy, here's the whiskey you asked f -- He freezes, taking in the scene: Amy reclining on the couch; Norville standing in front of her with his pants around his ankles, still breathing heavily; the bottle of whiskey in his own hand
(flustered) Thank you, Buzz, just leave it on the desk
Leering: Happy days, buddy
As he turns to leave: and 'll tell your secretary you're not to be disturbed
Yowzuh
He snaps the elastic strap under his chin
After the doors shut behind Buzz: (shuddering) What a horrible little person
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really -- At any rate  arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world -- Norville pours a glass of whiskey and brings it over to her
little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future -- myself -- He crosses back to the desk
Only to have that belief, that unsullied optimism, dashed against the marble and mortar of the modern work place -- Norville takes a cigarette from a large wood cigarette box on the desk and sticks it in his mouth
Cigarette
No thank you
Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years -- ' He has been pushing the box towards her
The box tilts lazily forward and then disappears over the far lip of the desk
We hear the  of the  landing amid the pitter-patter of cigarettes raining onto the carpet
Amy's brow crinkles
Continuing: -- these were the values that were instilled in me while  was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of -- Mind if  join you
He is pouring himself a drink
Be my guest
little town you've probably -- He tosses back his drink, gags, looks at Amy with his eyes bulging
Once again her
There is a   and an    as she silently moves her lips
He waves his arms and talks with a thick rasp as he staggers to his feet
Excuse me --  -- executive washroom
He staggers out a side door
On his exit Amy leaps to her feet and scurries over to his desk
At the top of her voice: Are you all right
She throws open the top desk drawer
Inside two lonely lead pencils roll through the otherwise empty drawer
Amy expertly flips a cigarette into her mouth and strikes a match off the desktop
Is it your lunch
The chicken a la king
From the washroom: (
) No,  -- Amy throws open another drawer, empty except for an appointment book
As she hurriedly flips through page after blank page an arctic   emptiness
One page only has a notation: 11:45
Address Wilkie Grammar School Junior Achievers Club
Is the a la king repeating on you
Amy shoves the appointment book back into the drawer
(
) 'm fine,
You were saying
She mutters: Values
watchwords
uh, tender years
(aloud) --  little town you've probably never heard of
She hastily stubs out her cigarette and waves her hand to disperse the smoke
Muncie, Indiana
She scurries back across the room as we hear the : she re-strikes her languid pose on the couch just as the washroom door opens
Norville gapes, one hand pressing a dripping rag to his forehead
You're from Muncie
Why yes, do you know it
Norville starts making pumping motions with his fists and loud syncopated grunting noises
Amy gapes at him
He starts singing, off-key: 'Fight on fight on dear old Muncie Fight on -- Hoist the gold and blue You'll be tattered, torn and hurtin' Once 'The Munce' is done with you
' Amy lamely fakes singing along, coming in louder on the last, obvious rhyme
Norville jumps an octave on it; she quickly follows sit, also pumping her fists
As Norville crosses his hands and locks thumbs in front of his nose to make bird wings of his extended fingers: Goooooooo Eagles
Amy awkwardly imitates
Norville excitedly sits behind his desk
Muncie girl
Talk about the cat's pyjamas
Tell you what, Amy
'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud
Oh, no, really,  -- Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world
Matter of fact,  know where a vacancy just came up
He hits the intercom
Mail room
To Amy: This'll only take a moment
(
) Yeah
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes -- (
) Barnes
Where the hell have you been
And where's my voucher
Norville thumps at his pockets
Well, 'm not sure where  -- (
) need that voucher
told you a week ago it was important
But look, 'm president of the company now and  -- (
) don't care if you're president of the company
need that voucher
Now
The intercom goes dead
Oh, of all the foolish
Listen, do you take shorthand
Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine
Of course --  went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic
Norville excitedly smacks a fist into a palm
--  Muncie girl
Can you beat that
Well,  just don't know how to thank you, Mr
Barnes -- Please
Norville
As he reaches to shake: It's my pleasure
She reaches for his hand but Norville snatches it away and, winking at her, hooks thumbs in front of his nose and makes wings of his fingers
Gooooooo Eagles
likewise hooks her thumbs in front of her nose, makes wings, and, winking back: Gooooooooo Eagles
But we   to reveal that the girl is now in a newspaper office, demonstrating the fight sign to , a reporter wearing a fedora with a bent-back brim
Smitty howls with laughter
(wheezing) Once 'The Munce'
Holy
Amy sits down behind a typewriter and, as she starts typing at 80 words per minute: And is this guy from chumpsville
pulled the old mother routine -- Adenoids
Lumbago
Behind her an ancient man wearing an inksman's visor and sleeve garters toils over a large checkerboarded surface over which he shuffles letter blocks and black spaces
Smitty gives a low whistle
That gag's got whiskers on it
The   and Smitty reaches for it
'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something -- (into phone) Yeah
Say, Amy, what's a six-letter word for an affliction of the hypothalmus
Without a break in her typing: -- And it's a cinch -- Goiter -- it's a cinch this guy isn't in on it
How much time to make the Late Final
Smitty holds the phone away from his ear
Chief
Still typing, Amy whistles and nods to her shoulder
Smitty tucks the phone into it as she continues typing
Hiya, Chief, just the person  wanted to apologize to
Smitty is looking at his watch
About seven minutes
(still typing) Yeah,  was all wet about your idea man
Well, thanks for being so generous
It is human, and you are divine
No, he's no faker
He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron -- To the Ancient Puzzler: -- as in a five-letter word for imbecile -- Back into phone: -- as pure a specimen as 've ever run across
Am  sure he's a nitwit
Heck, if working at the Argus doesn't make me an expert then my name isn't Amy Archer and 've never won the Pulitzer Prize
Her eyes narrow
In 1957
My series on the reunited triplets -- come on down here, hammerhead, and 'll show it to ya
Amy, what's a three-letter word for a flightless bird
Not now, Morris, 'm busy -- That's right,  said hammerhead, as in a ten-letter word for a smug bullying self-important newspaperman -- To Morris: -- Gnu -- Into phone: -- who couldn't find -- To Morris: -- That's -- -- Into phone: -- couldn't find the Empire State Building with a compass, a road map and a native guide

She slams down the phone
To Smitty: And that's just the potatoes, Smitty, here comes the gravy: The chump really likes me
Muncie girl
Smitty bursts out laughing
Better off falling for a rattlesnake
As she continues to type: 'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and 'm gonna find out what for
There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did  tell ya

Ten dollars
Let's grab a highball
On Norville Barnes
She rips the page out of the typewriter, swivels in her chair to   as we    and she hollers: Copy
: rolling, churning out great quantities of newsprint
Papers piling up one on top of the other, very many, very quickly
throwing a baled stack of papers off the back of his truck
rolling into the f
g
hand   to snip its wires and wipe off the top paper
wearing an apron and a little paper boy cap, mouthing "Extra
Extra
" as he holds one of the papers aloft
his arm  the newspaper and,  it, the towering Hudsucker Building
All of the above -- : spinning  the  and
Its headline, over a picture of Norville smiling, is " " The subheadline: "Not a Brain in his Head
" - is angrily slammed down to reveal that Norville has been reading the inside
His face twisting with fury, he leans forward and hits the intercom
Miss Smith, can you come in please to take a letter
Muttering to himself: of all the cockamamie
Amy is bustling in holding a steno pad and a pencil
As she seats herself in front of his desk, he rises to pace behind it
Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus
Well,
didn't bother to read the article
didn't think the picture did you justice
The picture was fine
It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath
Of all the irresponsible
Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one
How on earth would you know whether 'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man
No, change 'guts' to 'courage
' No, make it 'common decency
' These wild speculations about my intelligence -- -- or lack thereof
(nodding) -- these preposterous inventions, would be better suited to the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine
If the editors of the Manhattan Argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind, perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter
But doubt it
most seriously doubt it
As  doubt also that you could find a home at Amazing Tales, a periodical which  have enjoyed for many years
Yours sincerely, et cetera
He drifts into thought
Is that all, Mr
Barnes
Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does
Do you think 'm an imbecile
'm sure  -- Go on, tell the truth;  trust you and  put a lot of stock in your opinion
Well,  -- Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian
But would an imbecile come up with this
He whips the cover sheet off a display pad resting on an easel to reveal a large piece of graph paper with a circle rendered onto it
Amy looks, puzzled, from the circle to Norville's proudly beaming face
designed it myself and this is just the sweet baby that can put Hudsucker right back on top
Amy is bewildered
Norville explains: You know
For kids
Why don't  just type this up
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary
shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job,  guess
Well,  don't know; maybe she does deserve it
Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man
Well, she probably had a deadline
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record
Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it
Forget the letter, Amy,  just had to blow off some steam
She gets up to leave, and is heading for the door when Norville adds: She's probably just a little confused
Amy turns at the door
Confused
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys
Probably is one of the boys, if you know what mean
(through clenched teeth) 'm quite sure  don't know what you mean
Yeah, you know
Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays
Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it
She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it
Oh, is that it
Yeah, you know
Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or
Smitty
Exactly
And  bet she's ugly
Real ugly
Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance
bet that's exactly what she tells herself
But you and  both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid
Say, how about you and  grab a little dinner and a show after work
was thinking maybe The King and  -- Whap
Amy slaps him
He stares
How about Oklahoma
As she stalks out of the office: Norville Barnes, you don't know a thing about that woman
You don't know who she really is
And only a numbskull thinks he knows things about things he knows nothing about
He stares, rubbing his cheek
Say, what gives
: Reading five o'clock
: Rising from their desks, collecting personal effects, putting on their hats and coats
Busy hands punch out
Of the executive floor
security man walks down the hall, whistling, swinging a ring of keys
After he passes the door to the ladies' room it opens, Amy peeks out, emerges, goes into Norville's office
' She goes to the desk, takes out the appointment book, flips through it
Still empty except for the one date with the Wilkie Grammer School Junior Achievers Club, which now has a red line drawn across it with the notation
looks around the office -- notices something
Set into the wall to one side it is topped by a small plaque: Amy tries the knob, which turns, and enters
It is big and dim, several stories high, with spiral staircases reaching into, and catwalks criss-crossing, the gloom above
It is filled with contraptions -- works, cogs, gears
There is no window, but on what would be the window wall there is an enormous iron ring with a metal rod sweeping an interior circle
It is the backside of the great Hudsucker clock
Amy gazes about
She crosses to a door opposite the one she entered from
She stoops to peek through its keyhole

Who are you
How did you know who am
( ) Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care
Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'
Ya see, without that capital fo'mation -- Yeah, yeah
Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you
don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask
Thatches ain't ole Moses' way
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust
didn't think the Board was that smart
That smart
But then  figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile
Like some othuh people ah know
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president
'Cause they's little pigglies
They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves
But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does
He draws a circle with his finger in the air
you know, fo' kids
Yeah, he's a smart one, that Norville, heh-heh, he's a caution
Wal, some folks is square, an' some is hip -- To punctuate, he gives a little jerk of his hips
But  guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh
Well, maybe  -- An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go
(bristling) It's hardly the same -- Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes  have to go undercover as it were -- don't mean that
Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss
Ain't never gonna make you happy
Never made Warin' happy
(uncomfortably) 'm happy enough
(chuckles) Okay, Miss Archuh

Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had
But then, she never axed me 'bout dat
As   , we -- : : ' He slams down a typescript

Why not, it's all true
The board is using this poor guy
They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap
It's pure speculation
Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel
(chuckling) Ol' satchel-butt
know they're gonna buy that stock -- You don't know anything
Fact is they haven't bought it
The stock is cheap, Archer
What're they waiting for
don't know
Amy's hunches are usually pretty good, Chief
You don't accuse someone of stock manipulation on a hunch, Ignatz
The readers of the Manhattan Argus aren't interested in sensationalism, gossip and unsupported speculation
Facts, figures -- those are the tools of the newspaper trade
Why it's almost as if you're trying to take the heat off this Barnes numbskull -- like you've gone all soft on him
Come on, Chief, that's a low blow
Archer's not gonna go goey for a corn-fed idiot
All right,  was out of line
But you're out of line with this stock swindle story
Gimme some more of that Moron-from-Sheboygan stuff -- Muncie
Whatever
That's what sells newspapers
've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk
Watch it, Archer -- It's about a dimwitted editor who -- Easy, Amy
He gives her a companionable goose
Let's grab a highball and calm down
She whirls and slaps him
Back off -- smoocher

: Sidney
Mussburger President Norville Barnes and The Board of Hudsucker Industries     The Annual Fancy-Dress Hudsucker Christmas Gala Music, Dancing, Refreshments (Dainties) Formal Evening Attire de Rigeuer
The   the invitation -- " " --   the dance music of the Hudsucker Chamber Orchestra
the ; we   them and   to follow one couple: Norville and
, a large middle-aged woman of the Margaret Dumont-mold in an elaborately flowered and old-fashioned evening gown, low-cut in spite of her overly-heavy figure
She wears a large flowered hat with a rolled-up veil
-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs
Mussburger
Disappointment
'etais destroyee was in bed for a week
Positively sick with fury
called in the gardener and said, 'Monsieur Gonzalez, either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee
She throws her head back and roars with laughter
- As the large woman leans back to laugh, her feet stay planted on the ground and Norville's rise to be dragged with his toes scraping the floor through the continuing dance
'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue
Do you know him
haven't had -- Sidney and  are planning a trip to Paris and points continental -- Aren't we, dear
Mussburger has
Sure, sure
'm going to borrow Norville for a while, if you don't mind, dear
as they leave her: Well, frankly,
You have a charming wife, Mr
Muss -- uh, Sid
So they tell me
Norville, let me shepherd you through some of the introductions here
Try not to talk too much; some of our biggest stockholders are, uh -- scratch that: Say whatever you want
As Amy enters in a simple yet stunning evening gown
She looks around the room, then starts across the crowded floor towards the punch bowl
As Mussburger introduces him to a tall, imposing in a tuxedo and a ten-gallon hat
Norville Barnes, allow me to introduce Mr
Zebulon Cardozo, one of Hudsucker Industries largest and most loyal stockholders
Ignoring Norville's proffered hand: () Dammit boy, what's this  hear about you bein' an embecile
What the hell is ailin' ya
week ago my stock was worth twice what it is now
'm considering dumping the whole shootin' match, unless  see some vast improvement
Dammit, boy, It's a range war
Either you pull our wagons into a circle or 'm pullin' out of the wagon train
Norville gives him a forced but hearty laugh of reassurance
No need for concern, sir; it's only natural in a period of transition for the more timid element to run for cover -- So 'm yella, am
He starts peeling off his tuxedo jacket: We'll see who's yella
His , a small wiry woman, steps in as Mussburger starts dragging Norville away
Zebulon, you mind now and quit bein' sech an ole grizzly
As he reluctantly starts shrugging back into the jacket: Aww,  wasn't gonna hurt the boy, Lorelei
As they make their way through the room Norville is mopping at his brow with a handkerchief
'm sorry, Sid,  thought maybe if showed him the long view we might -- Thump
Dabbing at his brow, Norville has walked square into the back of a debonaire man holding a martini
The drink sloshes and the man turns testily to face him
Norville, this is Thorstensen Finlandsen, who heads a radical splinter group of disgruntled investors
Norville nervously pumps Findlandsen's hand
Hello, Mr
Finlandsen, so sorry to meet you -- uh, happy to walk into y -- uh, pleased to make your -- Findlandsen raises his hand to look quizzically at Norville's handkerchief which he now holds himself, apparently having been given it during the handshake
He hands it back to Norville
Thank you, sir
He stuffs it nervously into his outside breast pocket as Findlandsen stares at him
Mussburger stands watching in the executive at-ease, hands dug into his pockets
understand your concern about the down-ward, you know, but  think you'll find under our strong new leadership
As Norville's hand drops from his breast pocket the handkerchief, perhaps caught on his sleeve, whips out of the pocket and follows his hand down
Findlandsen looks down and Norville follows his look, and stoops   to retrieve the hanky
Findlandsen leans quizzically forward and peers down at Norville, who continues,
(
) We anticipate, in short order, an upward
In rapid fire, Norville straightens up into -- crunch -- Findlandsen, whose head snaps back, eyes rolling, a hand pressed to his nose, drink sloshing; Norville, one hand pressed to the back of his own head and the other wildly waving his hanky for balance, takes a staggering step forward onto the toe of an elegantly-gowned
Ahhh
There is a drum roll and, as the lights dim: grabs the large old-fashioned microphone in front of the band and grins
Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished members of the Hudsucker board give you the king of swing, the rajah of romance, the incredible, the unforgettable Mister Vic
Tenetta
Vic Tenetta takes the microphone from the Emcee who backs away, applauding as Tenetta starts to croon
He wears a white dinner jacket
His jet black hair sweeps out over his forehead in a roguishly pompadoured mat; one forelock droops and bounces across his forehead
: Clustered in a dim corner of the room, smoking cigars
In the b

, brilliantly spotlit, Vic Tenetta continues his song
As Mussburger joins them: #1 How's it going, Mr
Mussburger
Bad
#2 Good
But not bad enough
#3 Too bad
It could be better, it could be worse
Hmmmmmm
The stock's got to drop another five points if we expect to get controlling interest
Norville tells me he's got some hot idea
Can't be good
#1 Then it can't be bad
#2 Couldn't be better if it couldn't be worse
Hmmmmmm
- where the   is , '  just We are on a   of the back of a man who stands facing the twinkling cityscape, but in an odd, leanedback posture, with one hand reaching up to his hidden face, his other hand pressed against the small of his back, like a man with a stiff neck tossing back a drink
Amy, having just emerged onto the terrace, squints at him
Norville
He turns and we see that it is indeed Norville, holding a dripping icepack against one eye
What happened
Oh
Nothing, really, just
the more timid investors are no longer running for cover
Let me look
He does
Sid found me the icepack
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner
Thanks
People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story
'm sorry
Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy
You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this
As she rolls the pack gently across his eye: Norville
there's something  have to tell you
You see, 'm not really a secretary
know that, Amy
You do
understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts
'm not that skilled as president
Oh sure,  put up a big front -- (massages his eye) -- not that everyone's buying it
believe in you, Norville -- At least  believe in your
intentions -- Oh,  don't blame them, really guess  have sort of made a mess of things
These folks have to protect their investment
Most of them are very nice people -- Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie
They gaze out at the city
Certain people are -- Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town
Huh
You know, on farm route 17
Oh yes
In Muncie
No
In Vidalia
Farm Route 17
Uh -- Yes
Seventeen
Yes,  -- well no,  --  never really
There's a place  go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village
It's called Ann's 440
It's a beatnik bar
You don't say
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in
You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve
go every year
(puzzled) Every year
Well -- this year -- if it's good plan to make it a tradition
Uh, my it certainly is beautiful -- She nods out at the city to avoid Norville's quizzical look
The people look like ants
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants
Some will be butterflies
Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea
What a beautiful thought
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy
Oh,  don't know
Maybe  was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys -- Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but  find that very farfetched
Norville, there really is something have to tell you -- That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog
No, think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush
Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade
must have been an antelope or an ibex
What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats
Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways
wish it were that simple, Norville
wish  was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex
Well, can  at least call you deer
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth
Morosely: Yeah,  think 've heard of that
What goes around comes around
That's it
great wheel that gives us each what we deserve
He slaps his fist into his palm
Tomorrow's my big presentation to the board
've gotta show Sidney and the guys that  deserve all their confidence
Sadly: Oh, Norville -- Kiss me once, Amy
Kiss me once for luck
Sure, Norville, sure
She gives him a peck
They look at each other
Oh, Norville
She embraces him
They kiss again
Norville's eyes widen
Crooning the end of his song
Turn to the bandstand and applaud
In the midst of a passionate kiss

Well, it was no great idea, really

Barnes, did you have any idea there'd be such a huge response
Well, frankly,  don't think anybody expected this much hoopla -- He is surprised by a burst of laughter

Pull yourself together, Addison
Addison snuffles
Nobody told me
Nobody told me
You sold all of our stock
We dumped the whole load
Now quit showboating, Addison -- had twenty thousand shares
'd be a millionaire now
Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires
There's no point in looking back
At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap -- Cheap
Cheap
It's never been more valuable
And 'm ruined

He climbs up onto the board table

With the sound of a  being drawn across glass, Addison, still frozen, slides down the window, hits the floor, and falls stiffly back like a fallen tree
Mussburger sits up and sticks a cigar into his mouth

Sure, sure, the wheel turns, the music plays, and our spin ain't over yet

French sculptor wearing a white smock, a beret, and a goatee squints at Norville and chisels at a block of marble with a stone chisel and hammer

At length Norville stirs, opens his eyes, sits bolt upright, batting away the hands of the manicurist and temple-massager

Norville leans forward to hit his intercom
Is she in the book
-- The door bursts open and Amy storms in
For Pete's sake, Norville
Oh
Hello, Amy -- was it --  thought she said, Mamie -- Never mind about that
She shakes a piece of paper at Norville
You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing
Well,  wouldn't call them nincom -- They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker
Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families -- Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if -- You mean you know about this
Know about it
You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization
No, this was my idea from the start
Your i -- We have to be realistic, Amy
You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker -- You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work
Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see
You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here
This was addressed to the chamber orchestra, whose playing dribbles off
They look inquisitively at Norville, then rise to pack up their instruments and sheepishly leave the office
've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me -- Now, Aim -- Shutup
-- and don't think  haven't noticed how you've changed
used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest  thought you were an imbecile -- Now, Aim -- Shutup
-- but then  figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy
Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after -- Now, Aim -- Shutup
-- after all
You haven't talked to me for a week and now 'm going to say my piece
've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you
You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you
if you
Worked in a watch factory
The Goon looks up from his funnies
Huh-huh-huh
(to the Goon) Shutup
(to Norville) Exactly
Don't you remember how you used to feel about the hoop
You told me you were gonna bring a smile to the hips of everyone in America, regardless of race, creed or color
Finally there'd be a thingamajig that would bring everyone together -- even if it kept 'em apart, spacially -- you know, for kids
Your words, Norville, not mine
used to love Norville Barnes -- yes, love him
-- when he was just a swell kid with hot ideas who was in over his head, but now your head is too big to be in over
Now, Amy -- Consider this my resignation -- Thwock -- She slaps him
The bodyguard is on his feet
Hey
Crack -- Amy kicks him hard in the shin
Awooooo
-- Effective immediately
She strides to the door, leaving Norville rubbing his cheek and the Goon hopping around on one leg

She stands on a podium accepting an award; standing behind her are middle-aged identical triplets

Mussburger is seated at his desk looking at the file picture and clipping; the sign letterer/scraper is leaning over his shoulder, having just put them down
Hmmm
Thank you, Aloysius
This may be useful
Aloysious nods wordlessly and turns to leave
As we    the picture of Amy, we: : : After a beat, a woman  against the unblemished white background, dressed in a flowing white dance robe, trailing a long, diaphanous veil
She performs a flowingly sensuous dance moderne; the  is a sensuous saxophone solo with lasciviously bending blue notes
After the woman has been dancing for several beats Norville enters, dancing after her, pursuing her
He is wearing a coatless suit, his sleeves rolled up, his thin tie loosened
The woman dances around him, letting her diaphanous veil trail sinuously around his body
We hear an  voice: (
) Buddy
Say, buddy
- Sitting in his desk chair, sheened with sweat, eyes closed, licking his lips
: (
) Buddy
Ya busy
Huh-whuh
He opens his eyes and looks stuporously about
Buzz is grinning down at him in his little pillbox elevator cap
Looks like ya nodded off there, buddy
Say, ya got a minute
Norville clears his throat
Oh, uh
Buzz
Is it important
like to think so
It's this little idea  been working on
He turns an easel to face the desk
Ya see,  don't intend to be an elevator boy forever
Take a look at this sweet baby
The easel displays an oversized sheet of graph paper
Onto it has been rendered a top view, which is a perfect circle, and a side view, which is a vertical line
Norville gazes stupidly at the circle
Ya get it, buddy
Incredibly convenient, isn't it
Ya see -- He produces a tall glass of lemonade with a straw sitting in it
-- this is how it works, it's these little ridges on the side that give it its whammy
See, ya don't have to drink like this anymore -- He holds his head over the glass to drink from the vertical straw
-- Now you can drink like this -- He bends the straw to drink from it at the horizontal
call it the Buzz-Sucker, get it, buddy
-- After me
Buzz
Why, people are just dyin' for a product like this, and the great thing is we won't have to charge an arm and a -- Norville, who has been stewing, finally barks: Wait a minute
He grabs the lemonade glass, looks at it, sneering
Why, this is worthless
Huh
But, buddy -- Norville yanks the straw out and crumples it up
This is the most idiotic thing 've ever seen in my life
Yeah, but, buddy -- Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this
Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh
He pauses to belch
say, the hula hoop such a success
But, buddy -- And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time
've got a company to run here -- But, buddy, you were -- --  can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves
Geez, 'm sorry, buddy -- An example must be made
Buzz looks over his shoulder, turns back to Norville
Wuddya mean, buddy
Fired
You're fired
Is that plain enough for you, buster
Buzz's jaw drops
His elastic chin strap snaps under the pressure
Awwww, buddy -- And don't call me buddy
Out of here
Out
Buzz sinks to his knees, weeping
He clutches pathetically at Norville's pants legs
Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all  got
Get up
understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker
Just lemme keep my job, 'm prayin' to ya
We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries
Get out of my office
Leave your uniform in the locker room
Buzz stumbles away, still weeping
'm sorry, buddy
'm sorry
Buzz
off
Ha-ha-ha-ha
As we    Norville, laughing, there is a low, unearthly , and his face seems to  : We    the flame of Sid Mussburger's oversized lighter as he finishes lighting a cigar
He is sitting alone in the boardroom, but its door swings open and Norville enters wearing plaid knickers, a little cap, and a knit shirt that shows his waist starting to bulge
He has a full golf bag over his shoulder
Sorry 'm late, Sid
That back nine at Riverdale is really murder
Sure, sure, it's a tough course
Well thanks for coming, kid
thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud
Ya don't say
Mm
Ordinarily  wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly
How's that, Sid
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him -- Huh
He -- no,  -- he's just -- maybe  was a little rough on the boy, ya see  -- Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me
He's a little person
He's nothing
Like  say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance
But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company
He is shoving a file towards Norville, who opens it
Sure, sure, we tried to kill the story
But her newspaper won't play ball
Looks like her story's coming out
We   the length of the board room table Norville, who stares horrified at the file
See, kid, the problem the Board'll have
you hired this woman
Kept her on, while she made a chump out of you
Serious error of judgment
mean, business is war, kid -- ya take no prisoners, ya get no second chances
And a boner like this
'm afraid when the Board meets, after New Year's, your position
well, it looks like you're finished
stick a fork in ya, you're done
washed up
We  Mussburger   as we Norville, Mussburger continuing off: (
) 'm sorry, kid
understand this dolly who betrayed you, she used to be a friend of yours
Norville is slowly dragging the golf cap off his head
(
) And this elevator dope used to be a friend, too
Norville stares, perfectly still
(
) Well, they've got your throat pretty well slit
And when you're dead, ya stay dead
Ya don't believe me, ask Waring Hudsucker
Yeah, looks like curtains
Well, condolences, kid
Norville's   : -- We   to show that it is on the front page of the Manhattan Argus

He grins wolfishly
We are printing it
She's hittin' the streets this evening -- : -- and she's dynamite
But, Al, it's the bunk
Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day  met him
Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile
Archer, you're a broken record
Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy -- Says who
You're not the only one with sources, Amy -- Smith has a source on the Hud board -- very senior, very hushhush -- Yeah, and 'll bet his initials are Sidney
Mussburger
You've lost it, Aim
You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque -- Muncie
Whatever
It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it
Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' -- You're fools, both of you
It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville
They're trying to destroy him
(gently) Amy -- take a break
You've worked hard on this story -- heck, you broke it for us
But it's passed you by and Smith here has taken up the slack
She is near tears
You want slack, 'll give you slack
You're not putting me out to pasture, Al,  quit
Consider this my resignation -- She turns to Smitty -- -- effective immediately
-- and swings -- but he catches her before contact, holds her by the wrist, and sneers: Soft
Amy swings her free arm to -- thwack -- blindside his other cheek
In flickering black-and-white, he is lying on a couch that has been brought into his office, gazing listlessly at a bend straw, being interviewed by someone

He won't say, but man, is he from squaresville
He hangs up and we   him to bring the length of the bar into view
Norville dishevelled, is on the other side bellowing

It's New Year's Eve and  want a Martini
Daddy, it's like  been tellin' ya -- thought you served misfits here
The barman is taking rolled-up blow-beepers out of the cardboard box and loading them into tumblers to set along the bar
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol

It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like  been tellin' ya -- want a martini

Suddenly enraged: What'd you call me
He starts awkwardly peeling off his suit coat
You son of a -- (

Huh
He looks stupidly about, the shoulders of his coat down around his elbows
He sees Amy rushing up
Oh, it's you
Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch
Oh Norville,  -- Norville's attention has already left her
He looks for the missing bartender
(swaying) Barman
Set'm up, fella
Norville, 'm sorry,
tried to tell you
so many times
It's hard to admit when you've been wrong
If you could just
find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance -- Hey
Where's that martini
Just give me another chance, Norville -- can help you fight this thing know this last story was a lie
We can prove it
We can -- Aww, what's the difference
'm all washed up
When you're dead, ya stay dead
Hey, fella
Well that just about does it
've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and 've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but 've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and  don't like it
She starts pumping her arms, slowly chanting
Fight on, fight on, dear old Muncie
She steps back off the stool
Norville watches her dully, his head swaying
Fight on, hoist the gold and blue; You'll be tattered, torn and hurtin' Once 'The Munce' is done with you
Goooooo Eagles
She looks hopefully for some effect, but after staring at her for a slack-jawed beat Norville can only bring out: You lied to me
can't believe you lied to me
a Muncie girl
He lurches off his stool toward the door
Watching him, despair fights with confusion on Amy's face
But Norville
She realizes that, though shattered, he is still the simple innocent she loved -- Oh, Norville

Norville has run into someone
He looks up, dazed
(
) Hey, watch where you're -- Say, buddy
It is Buzz, the elevator boy, dressed in an ill-fitting tuxedo and a conical party hat
Za-Za is on his arm, towering over him, leering at Norville
-- Uh
Buzz, 'm sorry,  -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me
shouldn't a fired you,  didn't know what  was doing
was a little funny in the head,  -- Aw, buddy,  don't care about that
Norville is stunned
You don't
Nah, that's all forgotten
It is
Sure, Mr
Muss -- uh, Sid said could have the job back
Absolutely, Buzz, 'm glad he -- But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me
What gives
But, Buzz -- Say, that was a swell idea
But, Buzz, you know  never -- And Sid says you stole it
But Buzz -- - Well wuddya waiting for, Clarence -- Pop him one
Boffo
Buzz swings and Norville hits the snow hard
Think about that, idea man
Norville groggily raises his head
Say, isn't he that lunatic
Norville looks dopily up at the people in furs and party hats starting to gather
that big-shot faker
the Wall Street fraud guy
nuttier than a fruitcake
they say he's a menace
wuddya waitin' for, call a cop
We hear
Norville staggers to his feet
The crowd cringes
He's on his feet
We can take him
Norville bursts through the crowd, running
Buzz starts giving chase, followed by the braver souls, followed by the entire mob
runs, gasping, turning a corner
Down here
He went down here
Behind Norville, the crowd rounds the corner, led by Buzz
is  to a halt and out jump two burly unshaven men in white, one of them holding open a straitjacket, the other carrying a large butterfly net
They join in the chase
Norville turns down an alley
drooping off a lamppost gaily waves a bottle at him
Ring out the old
Ring in the new
The crowd is running past the mouth of the alley, missing the turn-off
Norville, gasping, crashes down  , his hands breaking his fall against the limestone
The to reveal that it is not floor but wall he has run into and is now leaning against
Norville looks up, sweating, gasping
The massive Hudsucker Building looms dizzily up towards the stars, capped by the huge Hudsucker Clock
(
) Ring out the old
Ring in the new
Norville staggers in
gust of icy air that comes in with him flaps a dropcloth off a huge shape that dominates the lobby: It is the heroic statue of Norville that we earlier saw him posing for
Norville reels over to it, stares dumbly
Mutely -- mockingly -- dignified
He staggers off to the elevators
' We are   the office  Mussburger, his feet up on his desk, laughing demonically, smoking his cigar

Dark and empty
Norville is peeling off his coat as he staggers over to the closet
We can hear   and the  of " " Norville has pulled his old mailroom apron from the closet and is putting it on:   /The Future Is Now
Norville looks at the door

He climbs out
Norville, back against the wall, looks cautiously down
We hear  : (

On the street far, far below, a lone car's headlights cut through the falling snow

lone tear runs down his cheek

The toll is right at Norville's ear
Startled, he reaches up to press hands against his ears
Distantly: (
) Happy New Year
He can't stand it
Whimpering, hands to his ears, he edges his way back toward the window
The open window at a steep angle
Someone inside slides it shut
Norville waves
No -- His gesticulation and a shuffle step upset his balance -- he trips -- falls -- catches the ledge -- -- No, please
He is hanging onto the icy ledge by his fingertips
His feet dangle away
Snow falls
Looking
Its second hand is making its descent
Falling
Laughing
Descending
Falling, turning lazily in the air -- and suddenly, with a great moaning sound -- he stops, suspended in mid-air, head down, feet in the air
It is much like the freeze frame on Waring Hudsucker that the title of the film was supered over
He waves his arms, to no effect, looks around
Frozen in attitudes of laughter, celebration
Snow sifts silently down around their motionless bodies
In his office, frozen with an idiotic laugh pasted to his face
Frozen, one ball swung out but suspended, hanging at the apex of its arc
Outside the great arched window, snow falls
He alone can move, but doesn't fall
He looks awkwardly about, his body in a dive-bomber attitude, canted steeply down
Its sweep second hand is arrested on its downward sweep

Strictly speakin', 'm never spozed to do this but

Twisting back to look up over his shoulder; there is a  -- very distant --
Looking up the length of the Hudsucker Building
Someone or something wrapped in white is flying toward us, coming down from the stars
We can make out a male voice, accompanied by : (
) She'll be comin' around the mountain when she comes, She'll be comin' around the mountain when she comes
He gapes
-- For it is an Angel, arrives
He is a balding man, wearing rimless glasses, in a white robe, large feathery wings sprouting from his back and beating heavily until he comes to rest, in midair
He puts aside the harp he has been strumming on a nearby windowsill
Love that tune
How ya doin', kid
Mr
Mr
Hudsucker
() Ta-daaaa
Presenting himself, he spreads his arms and stamps his forward foot, forgetting that there is nothing beneath his foot to stamp
He lurches forward, momentarily losing his balance
Wooooo
He rights himself
The halo spinning lazily over his head has been jarred askew
With a flick of his forefinger he rights it
How d'ya like this thing
They're all wearin' em upstairs now
He blows a dismissive raspberry
It's a fad
He pats at his robe, produces a white cigar
Anyway
hear you've been having, uh
He casually flicks his thumb out of his fist, lighting it
He lights the cigar off his thumb, takes a puff
Been having some problems with the board
The more things change, know what Iyayayeeeeee
Pain reminds him that he has forgotten to extinguish his flaming thumb, which he now waves frantically about
Jesus Christopher -- That smarts
Where was
Oh yeah, the board guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman
Norville
Mm
Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman
Beat ya any way he can
Straight for the jugular
Very effective
Yes sir
Anyway
Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal
Huh
Oh, geez, Mr
Hudsucker, apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and  guess  must've mislaid -- It's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it
Imbecile
Norville reaches in and -- pulls out the wrinkled Blue Letter
Oh, geez
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal
Geez,  -- Ah, it's New Year's, 'm not gonna add to your woes
'm just saying
Yessir
Well, why don't ya read it
Sir
Yeah, go ahead
Might learn somethin'
Yes sir
He tears open the envelope, reads: 'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker

Mussburger
Regarding
My demise
Dear Sid
By the time you read this,  will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning
will retain fond memories of the many years you and  -- Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph
'Many years, uh
know that you will be wondering why  have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth
You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well
Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine
However, Sid
These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure
look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company
Now see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success
' How has this come to pass
When and why did  trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth
What the heck have done
As Norville reads Hudsucker casually examines his fingernails, then pats down a yawn
'
Looking back now, Sid,  see that  allowed time and age to corrupt my dreams
Instead of fiercely guarding what was timeless inside of myself,  let the hubbub of earthly commerce erode my character, and dissolve my better self
How is it that some manage to preserve themselves where  have failed
Sidney,  do not know
Perhaps if others love you, you may more securely love yourself -- but  am alone loved a woman once, Sid, as you well know -- a beautiful, vibrant lady, an angel who in her wisdom saw fit to choose you instead of
' Norville is interrupted by loud blubbering
He looks up
Hudsucker is weeping loudly into a white handkerchief
He saws at his nose, gives it a loud honk, and urgently quavers in a voice strangled with emotion: Skip this part
He waves his hankie in get-on-with-it circles
Last paragraph, last paragraph
Norville looks down the page
'
And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as  -- nor even you
We have made our compromises with time
The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption
Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise
know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long
But --' -- tough titty toenails
He roars with laughter
That'll show the bastard
He merrily wipes his eyes
Yeah, go ahead
'
But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul
For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it
Long live the Hud
Waring Hudsucker
' Norville gives a musingly appreciative nod
Geez
Pleased with himself: Yup
It's all there
Well, see that it gets delivered in the morning
Hudsucker picks up his lyre and heads back up toward the stars
Sheeel beeee
' Mussburger still sits frozen in his chair
Outside the great arched window Hudsucker rises, through the falling snow, on his way back to the heavens
Ridin' six white horses, She'll be ridin' six white horses She'll be ridin' six white horses When she comes
We hear a great   from the   next door
Moses pries the broom handle loose from the Great Gear
With a   the  start to shudder and turn -- Lurching forward -- Swinging down -- As Norville falls the last few feet and lands on his face with one last mighty  of the
a tavern sign that says ' 440,   the front door, which Norville is entering
' Sitting halfway down the bar is Amy, staring morosely into a coffee cup
the  we are  , her
Norville enters, comes up next to her and makes the Go Eagles sign, hooking his thumbs in front of his nose and spreading his fingers
Two familiar voices narrate the scene, sounding a little tipsy: (
) What the heck's he doin', Benny
Amy looks at Norville, startled
After a moment she reciprocates the sign
(
) What the heck's she doin', Lou
(
) What the heck they doin'
Norville and Amy embrace
(
) You know what they're doin' now, Lou
(
) This  know, Benny
(
) This you're familia' with
Our      an elbow of the bar, Norville and Amy, now in
Resting on the bar in the extreme f

are two champagne glasses, half-full of fizzing champagne
Norville and Amy kiss
(
) Geez
(
) Geez
We hear ,
(
) 'all right, Benny
In a quavering voice: (
) Yeah, 'm
It's just
It's beautiful, Lou
Lou also is beginning to sound choked up: (
) It is beautiful, Benny
Almost weeping as Norville and Amy continue their embrace: (
) It's the most beautiful t'ing ever saw
(
) It's the most beautiful t'ing  ever saw
to  our  of Norville and Amy
He is youngish, with a beat goatee, wearing dungarees and a sweatshirt with cut-off sleeves
He looks to either side at Benny and Lou
You cats comin' from a party
Cabbies' affair
Hacks' New Year's gala
Crazy
Get you anything else
Sangria
Carrot juice
Herbal tea
We see Benny and Lou are sitting side by side at the bar
Lou wears a fake whispy beard and white eyebrows and a long flowing robe; he holds a fake scythe
On the bar next to him sits a large hourglass
Bromo
Benny is wearing nothing but an oversized diaper, a baby bonnett and a sash across his hairy chest and thick belly that says "1959
" He chucks himself in the heart, cocks his head and sucks in air, then blows it back out
Bromo
Lying on the boardroom table
As a hand enters to lay a wristwatch on the table next to it, we hear the voice of Moses, the old maintenance man
(
) And so began 1959
The new year
The hand reenters to lay down a wallet, and then to deposit a burning cigar in an ashtray
(
) And the start of a new business cycle
When he learned that Norville owned the comp'ny, ol' Sidney was upset at first
We   to show that Mussburger is walking toward the boardroom window
Board members silently remonstrate with him as he tries to wrench it open
(
) It's a good thing Doc Bromfenbrenner was there
Doctor Bromfenbrenner stands to one side watching, brow furrowed, a pencil pressed to his lips
(
) 'cause he was able to keep Sidney from harmin' his ol' self
We
: being slammed behind Sidney who, straight-jacketed, is puffing on a cigar as he is led away
(
) Now Norville, he went on an' ruled with wisdom and compassion
Again
Norville is eagerly pointing at a design he has up on an easel: Under the heading   is a large circle
The side view is a flat line
(
) and started dreamin' up them excitin' new ideas again
You know, for kids
The board members look at the design, puzzled
Norville takes a drop cloth off of a piece of plastic on a pedestal
He has the board's complete attention
(
) An' that's the story of how Norville Barnes climbed away up to the forty-fourth floor of the Hudsucker Buildin'
He picks up the plastic disc and as he sails it we

) an' then fell all the way down, but didn't quite squish hisself
