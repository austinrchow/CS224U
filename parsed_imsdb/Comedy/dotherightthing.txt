- - #45816 "The greatest miracle Christianity has achieved in America is that the black man in white Christian hands has not grown violent
It is a miracle that 22 million black people have not risen up against their oppressors--in which they would have been justified by all moral criteria, and even by the democratic tradition
It is a miracle that a nation of black people has so fervently continued to believe in a turn-the-other-cheek and heaven-for-you-after-you-die philosophy
It is a miracle that the American Black people have remained a peaceful people, while catching all the centuries of hell that they have caught, here in white man's heaven
The miracle is that the white man's puppet Negro 'leaders,' his preachers and the educated Negroes laden with degrees, and others who have been allowed to wax fat off their black poor brothers, have been able to hold the black masses quiet until now

Once he's finished with that task, counting his money, he sneaks into his sister's bedroom

: '  -- 1975 El Dorado pulls up in front of the neighborhood pizzeria--Sal's Famous Pizzeria
From out of the car comes the owner, , a slightly overweight man in his early fifties, and his two sons, , 22, and , 20
It's time for them to go to work at Sal's Famous Pizzeria in the heart of Black Brooklyn
Sal's sits on the corner of The Block
The Block being where this film on the hottest day of the summer takes place
Pino kicks a beer can in his path into the gutter
Pino, get a broom and sweep out front

This is a respectable business
Nuthin' wrong with it
Get dat broom
Tell Vito
Pop asked you
'm gonna kill somebody today
: ' -- Mookie comes down his stoop and walks to work
: -- The Block is beginning to come to life
Those unlucky souls who have to work this Saturday drag themselves to it, and the kids are out on the street to play in the hot sun all day long
:  ' -- Mookie stops to say hello to
She leans out her window on the parlor floor
In the summertime, the only time when she's not perched in her window is when she's asleep
Good morning, Mookie
Good morning to you
Now, Mookie, don't work too hard today
The man said it's gonna be as the devil

You get paid to do what we say

Pino looks at his father
He wants to be backed up on this; all he gets is an amused look, and a smirk from Vito
Who's working for who
There's a knock on the door and Da Mayor enters
Come on in, Mayor
Good morning, gentlemens
It's gonna be a scorcher today, that's for sure
Need any work done around here
Sal looks at Pino, who reluctantly gives Da Mayor the broom
It will be the cleanest sidewalk in Brooklyn
Clean as the Board of Health
Da Mayor almost runs out of the pizzeria in his hurry; soon as he finishes he'll be able to get a bottle
Pop,  don't believe this shit
We runnin' welfare or somethin'
Every day you give dat bum-- Da Mayor ain't no bum
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk

As soon as he finishes he can get that money and get that bottle
: -- group of youths sit on a stoop, waiting for someone
They are , , and the lone female,
What's keeping him
You call him, then
Ella stands up and yells
Yo, Ahmad

Yo, Ahmad
She looks up into his window, then sits down
Punchy, if ya want to do some more screaming, be my guest
'm too through
The door swings open at the top of the stoop and appears
Who's yelling my name
Punchy told me to
Don't listen to him, it will get ya in trouble
Heard that, Punchy
Ahmad sits down with them
Ella, you have a brain, use it
In the , we hear the dum-dum-dum of a giant box
The sound gets louder as the box gets closer
The youths look down the block and see a tall young man coming towards them
He has a very distinct walk, it's more like a bop
This is The size of his box is tremendous and one has to think, how does he carry something that big around with him
It must weigh a ton, and it seems like the sidewalk shakes as the rap music blares out
The song we hear is the only one Radio Raheem plays
-- Radio Raheem stops in front of the group, looks at them, and turns down the volume
It's quiet again
Peace, y'all
Peace, Radio Raheem
Peace
10
You the man, Radio Raheem
It's your world
In a big way
Radio Raheem nods and turns up the volume
Way up
My people
My people
:   -- Radio Raheem waves to Mister Senor Love Daddy as he walks by
:    -- Mister Senor Love Daddy gives Radio Raheem a clenched-fist salute
: -- -- Da Mayor walks into a newly opened fruit and vegetable deli stand that is owned by Koreans
: -- -- Da Mayor is looking for his beer in the refrigerated cases, his ice-cold beer
Where's the Bud
Where's the Bud
No mo' Bud
You look what we have and buy
No more Bud
What kind of joint is this
How come no mo' Bud
Doctor, this ain't Korea, China, or wherever you come from
Get some Budweiser in this motherfucker
You buy 'nother beer
11
Alright
Alright
'know you're asking a lot to make a man change his beer, that's asking a lot, Doctor
:  ' -- Da Mayor has his can of beer (not Budweiser) and the brown paper bag is twisted into a knot at the bottom
He stops and takes a long swig
You ole drunk
What did  tell ya about drinking in front of my stoop
Move on, you're blocking my view
Da Mayor lowers the can from his mouth and looks up at his heckler
It's obvious from the look on his face he's heard this before
Da Mayor contorts his face and stares at her
You ugly enough
Don't stare at me
Da Mayor changes his face into a more grotesque look
The evil eye doesn't work on me
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years
What have  ever done to you
You're a drunk fool
Besides that
Da Mayor don't bother nobody
Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you
Da Mayor just mind his business
love everybody
even love you
Hold your tongue
You don't have that much love
One day you'll be nice to me
We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice
At least civil
12
Da Mayor tips his beat-up hat to Mother Sister and takes a final swig of beer just for her
: ' -- An elderly Puerto Rican woman, , is telling off her daughter  in Spanish
Tina, having heard enough, closes the door on her mother's ranting and raving
-- Tina bends down and scoops her baby son  up from the bed and holds him for dear life to her breasts
She talks to her son while walking around the room
Hector,  shouldn't be telling you this but you would find out sooner or later
Ya father ain't no real father
He's a bum, a two-bit bum in a hundred-dollar world
Your father is to the curb
You're smart
see that look on ya face
You're saying if he's such a bum why am  with him
Good question
Like  said before, you're no dummy
He talked his way into my panties, thought being a mother would make me happy, make me whole
He's a mistake, but you are not
Tina kisses her son
Tina is seventeen years old, another teenage parent
:  -- Every day on this corner, summer or winter, spring or fall, a small group of men meet
They have no steady employment, nothing they can speak of; they do, however, have the gift of gab
These man can talk, talk, and mo' talk, and when a bottle is going round and they're feeling "nice," they get philosophical
These men become the great thinkers of the world, with solutions to all its ills; like drugs, the homeless, and
They're called the Corner Men: ,  , and
All three are sitting in folding chairs up against a wall in the shade
The way  see it, if this hot weather continues, it will surely melt the polar caps and the whole wide world--the parts that ain't water already--will be flooded
13
You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker
Where did you read that
Don't worry about it
But when it happens and 'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter
How you gonna get a boat
Don't worry about it
You're raggedy as a roach
You eat the holes out of donuts
'll be back on my feet
Soon enough
So when is all this ice suppose to melt
: '  -- Customers are in Sal's; it's lunchtime and it's fairly busy
Sal puts a hot slice down on the counter in front of ' , a b-boy
You paying now or on layaway
Buggin' Out looks at the slice
' How much
You come in here at least three times a day
You a retard

' Damn, Sal, put some more cheese on that motherfucker
14
Extra cheese is two dollars

Buggin' Out slams his money down on the counter, takes his slice and sits down
-- All around Buggin' Out, peering down from the   , are signed, framed, eight by ten glossies of famous Italian Americans
Joe DiMaggio, Rocky Marciano, Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, Luciano Pavarotti, Liza Minnelli, Governor Mario Cuomo, Al Pacino and, of course, how can we forget Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa:   , also
--' He looks at the pictures hovering above him
' Mookie
-- What
--' ' How come you ain't got no brothers up
-- Ask Sal
-- ' Sal, how come you ain't got no brothers up on the wall here
You want brothers up on the Wall of Fame, you open up your own business, then you can do what you wanna do
My pizzeria, Italian Americans up on the wall
15
Take it easy, Pop
Don't start on me today
' Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do  see any Italian Americans eating in here
All 've ever seen is Black folks
So since we spend much money here, we do have some say
You a troublemaker
Pino walks over to Buggin' Out
You making trouble
' Put some brothers up on this Wall of Fame
We want Malcolm , Angela Davis, Michael Jordan tomorrow
Sal comes from behind the counter with his Louisville Slugger Mickey Mantle model baseball bat
Vito is by his side, but Mookie intercepts them, and takes Buggin' Out outside
Don't come back, either
' Boycott Sal's
Boycott Sal's
: '  -- Buggin' Out,  gotta work here
' 'm cool

Come back in a week, it will be squashed
They give each other five

: '  -- Mookie enters
Mookie, if your friends can't behave, they're not welcome

You talk to 'em
People are free to do what they wanna do

Mookie
Gotta go

Mookie turns around and goes back
Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'
Doctor, always try to do the right thing
That's it
That's it
17

:  -- Mookie is hiking up a flight of stairs
-- He puts the pizza box down and takes a breather
-- Sweat drips off his face
-- He bends down to pick up the pizza box and tackles the last few flights
-- Mookie pushes the buzzer
-- young Puerto Rican woman opens the door
hope it's not cold
Mookie hands her the pizza
No, it's not cold
Twelve dollars for the pie
Nilda hands him a handful of singles
Mookie looks at the crumpled mess
Nilda attempts to close the door, but Mookie's foot says, "Hell no
" Hold it
Let me count this first
First he straightens out the dollars, then counts the bills
You're short
counted the twelve dollars myself
Twelve is right, but no tip
18
No tip
Look, lady
carried your pizza up five flights of stairs and shit
The cheese didn't slide over to one side like it sometimes does with delivery people who don't care do care
May  get paid
Nilda looks at him and sees right away he's not going anywhere
Wait here
'll wait
Nilda goes into the apartment and we hear her talking in Spanish to a male
-- Mookie bends down to tie his sneakers
-- Nilda reappears and holds out a lonely lone dollar for him
Mookie has her hold it out for awhile, then he takes it
Gracias mucho
Nilda slams the door

Cheap bastard
Your pizza is gonna be fucked next time
:  ' -- Jade sits down next to Mother Sister on the stoop
Jade, you're late

Where's the stuff
Mother Sister hands her a bag that is at her side
19
Seen your brother, just walked by
Jade unwraps a head scarf from around Mother Sister's head and a full head of long black hair falls to her shoulders
This might take some time
got nowhere to go
We haven't had a good sit-down for a long while
Jade begins to part, grease, and comb out Mother Sister's hair
Tender-headed runs in my family
You tender-headed
Yeah, me too
That's why  don't fool with it
Only let you touch it
Ouch
Sorry, comb got caught
Be gentle, child
Mother Sister is an old woman
How are you holding up in this weather

Don't like 'em

20
didn't know you had such beautiful hair
-- Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know
-- 'm not stopping
'm on my way
The Mayor tips his hat and heads up the block
-- You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right
'm not studying no Mayor
Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples
My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul
They both laugh
Number One:  got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house
Every year  keep threatening to sell it
And move to Long Island
And move to Long Island
Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire
Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all got
'm too through with yar people
-- Whew
21
She looks up at the white-hot sun
-- She does the same
-- - , Right now, folks, we're gonna suspend the narrative and show how people are coping with the oppressive heat
People are taking cold showers
Sticking faces in ice-cold, water-filled sinks
Heads stuck in refrigerators
wife tells her husband, "Hell no, 'm not cooking
It's too hot
The kitchen is closed
" Men downing six-packs of ice-cold brew
Faces stuck directly in front of fans
young kid cracks an egg on Sal's Cadillac
The moment the egg hits the car hood it starts to cook
The kid looks directly    and smiles, then looks up to see Sal, mad as a motherfucker, chasing after him
And how can  forget the papers, the newspaper headlines
New York Post: " " New York Daily News: "2  4
" New York Newsday: "
" New York Times: "   " : -- -- powerful gush of water flies out
Ahmad has just turned on the johnny pump and the white stream of water flies across the street
This attracts all the people of the block
It's a chance to cool off and momentarily beat the killer heat
-- They both scrape beer cans on the sidewalk
22
-- She stands with caution away from the fire hydrant
Ella does not want to get wet
-- They're still scraping away
-- Folks, young and old, begin to get in the water and play
-- Both now have cans with the ends scraped away, and go to the johnny pump
Punchy bends down behind the hydrant and places the can over the water
The can now directs the water into giant streams
-- Ahmad sneaks up behind Ella and picks her up
She's kicking and screaming furiously
Ahmad
Put me down
Put me down

Ahmad is not having it
He carries a kicking Ella into the middle of the street in direct line of fire
Yo
No
They both are hit with a blast of water and are soaked to the bone
Ella starts to punch Ahmad, and chases after him
-- We hear the familiar rap music of Radio Raheem's box
-- Radio Raheem is too cool
By the way he's dressed, it could be fall, not the hottest day of the year
But you could never tell it from him
He's too cool
-- 23
Raheem looks at Cee, he wants to get by and he doesn't want to get wet either
And if his box gets wet, somebody is gonna die
Cee knows this too
-- Cee stands in front of the hydrant, blocking the water so Radio Raheem can pass
-- He slowly bops across the street as all eyes watch
When he's clear, Cee moves and the water gushes out again as folks play
-- We hear a car horn blowing
People move out of the way as the vehicle speeds through the spray
-- An older man, , stops his white convertible and blows his horn
'm not playing
There's gonna be trouble if you fuck around
-- Go 'head
You got it
You got it
-- This is an expensive car
-- You won't get wet
-- Both Punchy and Cee sit in front of the hydrant once again, blocking the water
-- The car cautiously eases forward
Charlie doesn't trust Cee and Punchy at all
24
-- 'm warning you
-- 'mon
Hurry up
We ain't got all day
-- The people all move to the car, for they know what is about to happen
-- Cee and Punchy leap off the hydrant, unleashing a jet blast that flies directly into Charlie's car
The whole block is dying
-- Charlie pulls his flooded car over to the curb, jumps out, and runs to get hold of Cee and Punchy
Of course, he's slow, as the kids turn into track stars and make like Carl Lewis
-- Charlie, a wet mess, tries to buy some sympathy from the folks; none is to be bought
'm fucking soaked
If  ever catch those fucks they'll be sorry
Cocksucking sonabitches
The ranting continues, and people laugh at him
You people make me sick
cop car screeches to a halt in front of the man
Two officers,  and , get out
Officers,  want an arrest made

Officer Long goes into his car and gets a wrench

This hydrant better not come back on or there's gonna be hell to pay
What about my car

Officer Long sides up to Da Mayor who's been looking on
You know anything about this
Da Mayor is quiet
He knows
He's a witness
They all know
He saw the whole thing
Officer Ponte goes to Da Mayor's other side
Who were the punks
Those who'll tell don't know
Those who know won't tell
26

Mookie emerges from the crowd and leads Da Mayor away from the interrogation
Let's go, Mayor
Keep this hydrant off
You want to swim, go to Coney Island
He's leaving
What about me
suggest you get in your car quick, before these people start to strip it clean
The man looks at the crowd of Blacks and Puerto Ricans around him and he considers what he just heard
Let's go, break it up
Go back to your jobs
What jobs
Both cops laugh
-- Charlie drives away, fuming
: -- Cee and Punchy look down from a roof on all the havoc and confusion they've started
Both laugh

Thanks for stopping by Radio, 108
: -- On a stoop, a group of Puerto Ricans sits talking, drinking cerveza frio, and playing dominoes
One of their cars is parked near the stoop, and blasts salsa music
-- As usual we hear the rap music of Radio Raheem, but underneath the salsa music
Radio Raheem does not like to be bested; the salsa music from the parked car is giving him competition, this is no good
Radio Raheem stands in front of the stoop and raises his decibel level
-- The Puerto Rican men look at him, then begin to yell at him in Spanish
There is a standoff, the rap and salsa clashing in a deafening roar
One of the men, , gets off the stoop and goes to the car
-- Stevie turns the car radio off
-- Radio Raheem smiles, nods, turns his box to a reasonable listening level, and bops down the block
Radio Raheem still the loudest
Radio Raheem still the king
30
You got it, bro
-- The men curse in Spanish and shake their heads in bewilderment and Stevie turns the salsa back on
: -- Vito and Mookie see Buggin' Out on their way back to Sal's
You the man
' You the man
No, you the man
' No
'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world
Buggin' Out gives Mookie five and a menacing look at Vito
Vito is down
: -- Buggin' Out is walking down the block when , a yuppie, accidentally bumps into him, stepping on his new sneakers
--' He looks at his sneakers
-- There is a big black smudge on his new white unlaced Air Jordans
--' He runs down the block after Clifton
' Yo
Clifton turns around
31
' Yo

' You almost knocked me down
The word is "excuse me
" Excuse me
'm very sorry
' Not only did you knock me down, you stepped on my new white Air Jordans that  just bought and that's all you can say, "Excuse me
" This commotion has attracted a crowd, including Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella
' 'll fuck you up quick two times
' Who told you to step on my sneakers
Who told you to walk on my side of the block
Who told you to be in my neighborhood
own a brownstone on this block
' Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street
The crowd likes that one and they laugh and egg him on
' What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for
Motherfuck gentrification
'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases
32
' free country
Why did he get Buggin' started
' should fuck you up just for that stupid shit alone
Buggin' Out looks down at his marred Air Jordans
The crowd, smelling blood, wants to see some
Your Jordans are dogged
You might as well throw 'em out
They looked good before he messed them up
You used to be so fine
How much did you pay for them
hundred bucks
hundred bucks
' You're lucky the Black man has a loving heart
Next time you see me coming, cross the street quick
He's dissing you
' Damn, my brand-new Jordans
You should buy me another pair

Vito walks away and Mookie is disgusted

Too long
Now for the life of me,  haven't been able to figger this out
Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb
This is truly a stupefying question and all three are silent
What is the answer
It's gotta be cuz we're Black
No other explanation, nobody don't want the Black man to be about shit
Old excuse
'll be one happy fool to see us have our own business right here
Yes, sir
'd be the first in line to spend the little money  got
Sweet Dick Willie gets up from his folding chair

How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor
Fifty cents
You got a deal
He gives Eddie some money
Git me a quart of beer, Budweiser, say it's for your father, if they bother you
Eddie runs down the block just as Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella pass him
38
Who told him he was Da Mayor of this block
He's self-appointed
Leave him alone
Shut up
Go on now
Leave me be
You walk up and down this block like you own it
Da Mayor
You're old
old drunk bum
Da Mayor stands up from his seat cushion on the stoop
What do you have to say
What do you know 'bout me
'all can't even pee straight
What do you know
Until you have stood in the doorway and heard the hunger of your five children, unable to do a damn thing about it, you don't know shit
You don't know my pain, you don't know me
Don't call me a bum, don't call me a drunk, you don't know me, and it's disrespectful

The teenagers look at Da Mayor
He told you off

Barry Manilow
Mookie and Vito laugh
Pino, no joke
'mon, answer
It's Prince
He's a Prince freak
Shut up
The Boss
Bruuucce
Sounds funny to me
As much as you say nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are "niggers

It's different
Magic, Eddie, Prince are not niggers,  mean, are not Black
mean, they're Black but not really Black
They're more than Black
It's different
With each word Pino is hanging himself even further
Pino,  think secretly that you wish you were Black
That's what think

It's e-vit-able

Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood
Too many pizzerias already there

We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst

Everything, but for you 'm gonna make up something special

Da Mayor takes a seat on the stoop and puts the flowers to his face
Ain't nuthin' like the smell of fresh flowers
Don't you agree, Miss Mother Sister
Mother Sister does not answer
He puts the flowers down
Summertime, all ya can smell is the garbage
Stink overpowers everything, especially soft sweet smells like flowers
He looks up at Mother Sister who immediately turns away
If you don't mind, 'm gonna set right here, catch a breeze or two, then be on my way

Just run your big fucking mouth always playing big brother
You don't listen, but Mookie does
'  it at daytime, but now   it at night
Even though the white-hot sun is gone, nonetheless the heat is still stifling
And in a peculiar, funny sort of way, it's worse
You expect it to be hot during the light of day when the sun is beating down on the cement and tar, but at night it should be considerably cooler; well, not tonight, it's hot
All the residents of The Block: the Corner Men, Mother Sister, Da Mayor, Jade, etc
, all the people '  throughout the day are now coping with the night-time heat, plus it's humid as shit
Everyone is outside, sitting on stoops, on cars and you know the kids are playing, running up and down the block
Now it's the hottest night of the year
: -- Buggin' Out sits down on a car next to Radio Raheem; as usual, his box is blasting
' How you be
be
'm living large
' Is that the only tape you got
75
You don't like Public Enemy
It's the dope shit
' like 'em, but you don't play anything else
don't like anything else
' Check this out
'know Sal's
Yeah,  know dat motherfucker
' 'm trying to organize a boycott of Sal's pizza joint
Ya see what 'm saying
almost had to yoke him this afternoon
Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down
Didn't even say please
Who the fuck he think he is
Don Corleone and shit
' He makes all his money off us Black people and  don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers
Ya see what 'm saying, homeboy
Talk to me
' We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there
That's what 'm talkin' 'bout
That's what 'm talkin' 'bout
' You got my back
76
Ya back is got
' My brother
My brother
: '  -- Vito, Pino and Mookie are cleaning up
Sal, it's almost quitting time so please start counting my pay gotta get paid
Sal is looking into the cash register
We did good business today
We got a good thing going
Nothing like a family in business working together
One day the both of you will take over
and Mookie, there will always be a place for you at Sal's Famous Pizzeria
'know, it should be Sal's and Sons Famous Pizzeria
--, , All three look at each other
The horror is on their faces, with the prospect of working, slaving in Sal's and Sons Famous Pizzeria, trapped for the rest of their lives
Is this their future
It's a frightening thought
-- Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella enter
We're about to close
Just four slices, regular slices
Please
To go
, but that's it
It's been a long day
Mookie goes over to the table where Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella sit
77
Look,  want you to get your slices, then outta here
No playing around
You got it
Good
No joke
We all wanna go home
We hear the dum-dum-dum of Radio Raheem's box
As everyone turns their heads to the door, Buggin' Out and Radio Raheem are inside already
We have never heard the rap music as loud as it is now
You have to scream to be heard and that's what they do
What did  tell ya 'bout dat noise
' What did  tell ya 'bout dem pictures
What da fuck
Are you deaf
' No, are you
We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame
Turn that   off
We ain't in Africa
Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella start to dance while Mookie takes a seat, the impartial observer that he is
' Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa
It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria
Radio Raheem
Fuck you
78
What ever happened to nice music with words you can understand
This is music
My music
We're closed
' You're closed alright, till you get some Black people up on that wall
Sal grabs his Mickey Mantle bat from underneath the counter and brings it down on Radio Raheem's box, again and again and again
The music stops
-- ' Radio Raheem's pride and joy is smashed to smithereens
It's going to the junkyard quick
-- There is an eerie quiet as everyone is frozen, surprised by the suddenness of Sal's action, the swings of his Mickey Mantle bat
All look at Radio Raheem and realize what is about to happen
-- Radio Raheem screams, he goes crazy
My music
Radio Raheem picks Sal up from behind the counter and starts to choke his ass
Radio Raheem's prized possession--his box, the only thing he owned of value--his box, the one thing that gave him any sense of worth--has been smashed to bits
(Radio Raheem, like many Black youth, is the victim of materialism and a misplaced sense of values
) Now he doesn't give a fuck anymore
He's gonna make Sal pay with his life
Vito and Pino jump on Radio Raheem, who only tightens his grip around Sal's neck
Buggin' Out tries to help his friend
Mookie just stands and watches as Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella cheerlead
79
: '  -- The tangled mass of choking, biting, kicking, screaming confusion flies through the door of Sal's out onto the sidewalk
-- The kid yells: Fight
Fight
: -- He looks up
: -- She looks up
: -- He also looks up
-- The people on The Block run to Sal's Famous Pizzeria to see the
--' Radio Raheem, Buggin' Out, Sal, Vito, and Pino are still entangled, rolling around on the sidewalk, but now before an entertained crowd of onlookers: -- Break it up
This is crazy
The fight continues
Da Mayor is smart enough not to get in the middle of this war
We hear sirens, somebody has called -- 80
The cop cars come right through the crowd, almost running over some people
The cops get out with nightsticks and guns drawn
two of the faces, Officers Long and Ponte
Any time there is a skirmish between a Black man and a white man, you can bet the house on who the copes are gonna go for
You know the deal
Buggin' Out is pulled off first, then Vito and Pino, but Radio Raheem is a crazed man
It takes all six cops to pull him off Sal, who is red as a beet from being choked
-- Handcuffs are put on Buggin' Out as he watches the other cops put a choke hold on Radio Raheem to restrain him
-- Radio Raheem is still struggling, then he just stops, his body goes limp and he falls to the sidewalk like a fifty- pound bag of Idaho potatoes
-- Officers Long and Ponte kick him
Get up
Get up
Radio Raheem just lies there like a bump on a log
-- The crowd stares at Radio Raheem's still body
He's unconscious or dead
-- Quit faking
-- The officers all look at each other
They know, they know exactly what they've done
The infamous Michael Stewart choke hold
Let's get him outta here
The officers pick up Radio Raheem's limp body and throw him into the back seat
Buggin' Out is pushed into another car
The cop cars speed off; in their haste to beat it, they have left the crowd
It's at this point the crowd becomes an angry mob
81
-- The mob looks at
-- Sal still on the sidewalk, being helped to his feet by Vito and Pino, who are in bad shape themselves
-- The mood/tone of the mob is getting ugly
Once again they have seen one of their own killed before their eyes at the hands of the cops
We hear the murmurs of the folks go through the crowd
' ' ' The cops, in their haste to get Radio Raheem out of there, have left an angry mob of Black folks with a defenseless Sal, Vito, and Pino
The mob looks at them
' ' ' ' Mookie looks at the crowd and notices he's on the wrong side
He leaves Sal and his two sons
-- Da Mayor walks in front of the crowd
82
Good people, let's all go home
Somebody's gonna get hurt
() Yeah, you
If we don't stop this now, we'll all regret it
Sal and his two boys had nothing to do with what the police did
() Get out of the way, old man
You a Tom anyway
Let 'em be
-- Mookie picks up a garbage can and dumps it out into the street
He walks through the crowd, up to Da Mayor, Sal, Vito, and Pino
-- He screams
Mookie hurls the garbage can through the plate glass window of Sal's Famous Pizzeria
That's it
All hell breaks loose
The dam has been unplugged, broke
The rage of a people has been unleashed, a fury
lone garbage can thrown through the air has released a tidal wave of frustration
-- Da Mayor pushes Sal, Vito, and Pino out of the way as the mob storms into Sal's Famous Pizzeria
: '  -- The people rush into Sal's Famous Pizzeria, tearing it up
-- The cash register is opened
only coins, Sal has the paper
83
:  ' -- Da Mayor leads Sal, Vito, and Pino back to his stoop where they watch in horror
There it goes
Why
You was there
First white folks they saw
You was there
Fuckin' niggers
: '  -- Someone lights a match
: '  -- Sal's Famous Pizzeria is going up in flames and now it's a carnival
Burn it down
Burn it down
One might have thought that the elders--who through the years have been broken down, whipped, their spirits crushed, beaten into submission--would be docile, strictly onlookers
That's not true except for Da Mayor
The rest of the elders are right up in it with the young people
: '  -- -- The photos of famous Italian-Americans are burning
: -- -- The mob now moves across the street in front of the Korean fruit and vegetable stand
Sweet Dick Willie, Coconut Sid, and  stand at the head of the mob
It's your turn
-- He's scared to death, as the mob is poised to tear his place up too
The clerk wildly swings a broom to hold them off
84
Me no white
Me no white
Me Black
Me Black
Me Black
-- Me Black
Me Black
The mob starts to laugh; they feel for him
-- Korea man is
Let's leave him alone
Him no white
Him no white
Him Black
Him Black
:  ' -- Sal, Vito, and Pino look on as Sal's Famous Pizzeria goes up in smoke
: -- : -- : -- : -- -- Jade is running through the mob, looking for her brother
Mookie
Mookie
-- Mookie is running around with the rest of the mob
-- 85
The wail of fire trucks and police sirens is now added to the night
: '  -- The mob moves back to in front of Sal's as the fire trucks and police, in full riot gear, pull up in the street behind them
() Good people
Please disperse
Please disperse
The firemen rush to hook up their hoses, the police force themselves between the crowd and the burning Sal's Famous Pizzeria
() Please disperse
Please disperse
The mob doesn't listen, they will not be moved
The mob will not be moved until they see Sal's Famous Pizzeria burn to the ground
--' The firemen douse the pizzeria, trying desperately to stop the fire from spreading into the adjoining buildings
() Good people, we're giving you one more warning
Please go back home
-- This is our home
-- This is our neighborhood
-- It will take force to move this mass of people
() You've had your warning
The hoses are turned on the mob
86
Mookie, Mother Sister, Sweet Dick Willie, , Coconut Sid, Jade, Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella, etc
, go down before the powerful blast of the firehouse
Now we've come full circle
We're back to Montgomery or Birmingham, Alabama
The only thing missing is Sheriff Bull Connor and the German shepherds
It would take force to move them and that's exactly what the mob got
People are trying to hold on to each other, cars, railings, anything to keep from being swept away
:  ' -- Da Mayor, Sal, Vito, and Pino watch in disbelief
It's unbelievable what is happening before their eyes
: -- People are screaming, kids and women are not being spared from the brute force of the firehoses either
:   -- the reflection of the fire in the storefront window as Mister Senor Love Daddy looks on
: -- -- Jade and Mother Sister try to hold on to a streetlamp as a gush of water hits them; their grips loosens, the water is too powerful, and they slide away down the block and Da Mayor runs after them
: '  -- -- Some burnt photos on the floor
-- The Mickey Mantle bat burns
-- ' Radio Raheem's box has melted into a black mass of goo
-- ' 87
As      the melted box, we begin to hear the rap song that we've hear throughout
All other sound drops as the rap song gets louder and louder until it's deafening
-- Smiley sits up from where he hid during the burning and looting of Sal's Famous Pizzeria
Smiley looks around and goes directly to the smoldering Wall of Fame
He stands there
Smiley pins one of his Malcolm /Martin Luther King, Jr
, cards to the Wall of Fame
-- -- We're on Smiley's face and a smile slowly travels across
It's the first time Smiley has smiled in years and nobody is there to see this event
: :  -- :   -- The ,   ,    The Block
The sidewalk is deserted, broken glass is everywhere, and it looks exactly as how one expects it to look, the morning after an uprising
The      the   storefront where Mister Senor Love Daddy is in his familiar place behind the mike
My people
My people
What can say
Say what  can
saw it but didn't believe it
didn't believe it what  saw
Are we gonna live together
Together are we gonna live
This is ya Mister Senor Love Daddy here on , 108  on your dial, and that's the truth, Ruth
-- 88
Today's weather
(he yells) -- He screams: : : ' -- Mookie jumps out of her bed; Tina sleeps by his side and their son Hector is between them
() Fuck
My money
Where are you going
To get my money
Mookie, you must think 'm stupid or something
You're gonna run outta here and  won't see your black ass for another week
Tina, it's not like that
Mookie is putting on his clothes
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son
Tina, 'll be right back
Be a man
am a man
89
Act like one then
Be a man
Later
You're to the curb
You better step off
Get a life
Mookie leaves
' -- Da Mayor wakes up in Mother Sister's big brass bed (she was born in it)
At first he has no idea where he's at, then sees Mother Sister sitting down across the room smiling at him
Good morning
Is it a good morning
Yes indeed
You almost got yourself killed last night
've done that before
Da Mayor gets up out of her big brass bed
Where did you sleep
didn't
hope the block is still standing
We're still standing
Da Mayor and Mother Sister both look out the parlor window to see   and Mookie
: '  -- Mookie walks up to Sal's Famous Pizzeria as it still smoulders in the morning light
Sal emerges from the wreckage; he looks like he might have slept there
90
Whatdafuck do you want
wants my money
wants to get paid
Sal looks at Mookie in disbelief
Mookie,  always liked you
Not the smartest kid, but you're honest
Don't make me dislike you
Sal,  want my money
Don't even ask about your money
Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed
Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time
Fuck dat
The time is fuckin' now
'know 'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but  gotta live, too gotta get paid
We both do
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway
Ya know da deal
Do we now
Quit bullshitting
You don't know shit about shit
91

Sal has had it
How much
How much do  owe you
My salary
Two-fifty
Sal pulls out a wad and quickly peels off hundred dollar bills
One, two, three, four, five
Sal throws the "" notes at Mookie, they hit him in the chest and fall to the sidewalk
Are you happy now
That's five fucking hundred dollars
You just got paid
Mookie, you are a rich man, now ya life is set, you'll never have another worry, a care in the world
Mookie, ya wealthy, a fuckin' Rockefeller
Mookie is stunned by Sal's outburst
He picks up the bills
Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone
You only pay me two-fifty a week
(he throws two "" notes back at him) owe you fifty bucks
Keep it
You keep it
Christmas came early
Both look at the two hundred-dollar bills on the sidewalk and refuse to pick them up
It's a stalemate
92
This is the hottest Christmas 've known
Mookie counts his money
It's supposed to be even hotter today
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria
No
What are you gonna do
Make dat money
Get paid
Yeah

Gonna take the day off and go to the beach

It's gonna be  as a motherfucker
Mookie
Gotta go
'mere, Doctor
Mookie turns around and goes back
Doctor, this is Sal talkin'
Doctor, always try to do the right thing
That's it
93
That's it
Mookie thinks about it, looks at the two "" notes still smiling up at him
He quickly scoops them up
got it
: -- As Mookie turns and walks away, Sal goes back into Sal's Famous Pizzeria to salvage what is salvageable, and The Block begins to awake from its slumber, ready to deal once again with the heat of the hottest day of the year
