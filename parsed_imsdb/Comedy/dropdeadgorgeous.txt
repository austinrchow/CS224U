The top and brim of a   can be seen
She   to see the crew

Je-sus-Christ-on-a-cross
(catching breath) Look, number one rule in a funeral home - never sneak up on the livin'
You never know who could have an embalming needle or skull saw in their hand
Mr
Larson's son learned that the hard way - he's buried next to my Grandpa
Amber turns to the slab to continue working
She pulls off the  to reveal , handsome football player, still wearing his hunting plaid

) (covering real emotions) Upset about Brett
Nah

Amber turns from Brett and closes the coffin

He puts a pinch between his cheek and gum
- visibly upset Amber still applies make-up to Brett
Yah-sure, Tammy liked to driver her dad's thresher - she said the heavy vibration helped her think, y'know
But  know for a fact she only smoked after a good drive
You ask me or anyone else who isn't scared to talk about it - Tammy was murdered

Camera pans over to see a semi-conscious Annette as they load her stretcher into the ambulance, shut the doors and start to pull away
Amber runs after them
Mommmm

" (to candy striper) 'ya think a nice cool mint'd help if shoved your head up your ass
Fear sweeps over the Candy Striper - she bolts down the hall
Loretta puts an arm around Amber and starts to walk down the opposite direction
So, what do  say
Simple
Just say, "Mom,  know you sacrificed everything - relationships, dreams - your tummy, ass and thighs - all to bring me into this world
All so  could have tap lessons and be in the pageant - the same one you were in
But, y'know what
'm quittin'

Practically the only thing  wouldn't do different is have you
Amber sits on the bed

She never hid the fact that my dad picked his career over us
What'd she used to say
"Once a carnie, always a carnie
" Oh-yah

The other judges look at him, then at their clipboards trying to find this question
-   - Oh-yah,  love to swim
When  was in New York,  met Greg Louganis at one-a my brothers' shows

The Judges look at each other confused and frustrated

Harold

Yah-my ma's clothes all melted onto mine forming like this big polyester meteor in our closet, y'know
But, in some kinda weird miracle, our neighbor boy, Kenny Johanson, found my tap costume on the roof-a their trailer while he was settin' coon traps for his dad
Here's the weird part
It was still on the hanger
- wearing " love German Shepherds" sweatshirt, standing beside various trinkets
And, uh, this is my lucky bolt
They think it fell from a -10
The doctor said  was lucky the flat side hit me, um, otherwise it coulda gone right through my head

guess the explosion
Janelle Betz, wearing a flowing, nymph-like dress with ballet slippers, glides up to Amber
(slow, due to signing) Amber
Can we switch numbers

Yah-sure, eight's my luck number anyway
Diane Sawyer was number eight at her local
Thank you

In the f

This is a hard time for me
This is the part of the pageant when you realize that tomorrow night, all but one of these girls will walk out of here a loser
It's hard for me to know how that must feel, but 'm sure it doesn't feel good
In b
g
, a     on Janelle's head
Gladys and  rush the stage
"Through the Eyes of Love" continues throughout
'  -  - very shaken Amber paces
Don't you get it

That light was meant for my head
If Janelle hadn't wanted to change numbers
God,  owe my life to that deaf baby
Loretta enters, portable phone and drink in hand
That was your mom
She wanted you to have this
(taking drink) Really, Loretta
(avoiding eye contact) You-betcha
My mom wanted me to have this
Oh, shut up
thought it might help you get some sleep
Loretta, never have kids
Well God-love-ya for thinkin'  still could
Loretta pulls a bag out of a closet and hands it to Amber

Amber pulls out an

Jazzy patriotic medley tape
Gym doors fly open and like a Felliniesque Vegas review, enter wearing gowns and
Monument Headdresses
They struggle to maintain balance as they dance, moving only their arms, on stage
: Becky, whose head is built like another president into Mount Rushmore, is first at the mic
(The "dance" continues behind each contestant as she steps up to the mic
) chose Mount Rushmore, because to live in a country where you can take an ugly old mountain and put faces on it, faces of great Americans, who did so much to make our country super great, well that makes me - Rebecca Leeman -
-  - of wearing a Statue of Liberty Headdress
(It's a Barbie Doll that holds an unlit birthday candle

Uh, this, uh, my Uncle Phil's World's Largest Ball of Twine, in Bundy Minnesota, makes me, um, it makes me proud 'm American -  kinda misunderstood the assignment
The ball of twine falls to the floor and rolls off the stage, still attached at one end to her head

And here she is, Mary Johanson
Applause
Gladys exits
"It's My Turn

Mary wears a gigantic black wig and silver gown which hangs off her boney body
She moves her lips to the words as the nurse pushes her emotionally around the stage
- Contestants, in "physical fitness" outfits, wait outside the double doors, holding freshly painted red, white and blue step ladders
Becky and Amber stare at each other from opposite ends of the line
All right, why don't we take up the stepladders, all right

Put a dab of this on the old choppers, ladies
It'll help you smile
And when they're lookin' at your teeth - God willin' - they won't be lookin at your feet
Chloris gives Amber the jar and exits

Amber, 'm sorry
really am
But you know the rules
All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule
Sorry
- don't make the rules
This, this
This is bullshit
Amber Atkins
That is not American Teen Princess language
Good, kcause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant - it's, it's Nazi Germany
Amber storms off
(shaking head) Where do they get this stuff
as she storms over to  - where Gladys watches Michelle
Mrs
Leeman
(turning) Huh
-'m wearin' this costume
'm, uh, 'm gonna do my talent tonight
Oh really -  don't think so
(suddenly aware of camera) Uh, Amber,  hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance
And this
(pointing to costume) This is why we have the rule
My goodness gracious,  couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage
We have kids in the audience
But, you -  mean
It's not my fault
-
Please
didn't do anything wrong
Amber starts to cry
(climaxing) That's why
must say
(raising arm upward) Soylent Green
is
people
She doubles over
She's given it all
Oops, that's my cue
Gladys starts out on stage as Molly Howard, dressed like a red, white and blue cowboy, runs up next to Amber
She's twirling toy guns on her fingers
Wish me luck
(drying her eyes) Good luck, Molly
One of Molly's guns flies off her finger
She goes to retrieve it
- Molly is line dancing, occasionally taking "pretend" shots into the air
It's incredibly repetitive and dull
- ' "  "  - As Billy Ray Cyrus' "Achy Breaky Heart"  in b
g
, Carl, the janitor, sets plastic army figures on fire with a cigarette lighter
- Gladys is center stage
Molly Howard walks off crying, having just finished her routine
She's still spinning her guns, again one goes flying
Thank you, Molly
/ - Lisa, top hat, tails, giant "  " button - and others try to console a  Amber
Becky continues singing
(arm around Amber) Oh, Amber
(can't catch breath) -----, j-uh-j-uh-just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete
can't believe this is happenin' can't believe she said you couldn't
Getting an idea, Lisa starts to take off her jacket
(cont'd) Amber
Here
(still sobbing) "Here," wh-wh-what
My jacket
Take it kcause, y'know, got my costume okay'd before the pageant
You can wear it
Oh man, Lisa,  wouldn't do this
(to Lisa) They're never gonna let you perform naked
asked
Shut up, yous guys
Look, Amber, 'm not gonna win
And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me
Your parents'd kill you
Oh c'mon,  love kem, but you know they only had me kcause Peter needed a kidney
Lis,  want to,  really do, but
Oh,  can't
Then do it for Peter
Mrs
Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries
He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow,  don't know, got her back
Yah
Oh-you-beccha
Amber hugs her and takes the jacket
-  - Gladys guides Molly off the stage
Now, it's with overwhelming pride that introduce contestant number six, who also happens to be president of her class - two years running - a member of the honor roll and the new President of the Lutheran Sisterhood Gun Club - Rebecca Ann Leeman
, who sits at the edge of the stage, holding a mic
She's head to toe sequins in her poodle skirt, sweater, saddle shoes, etc
(talking over music) don't know how many of you know this, but 've got a very special fella in my life - that's right, do
And if nobody minds, 'd like to sing a little song, just for him
as Becky stands and walks center stage to what appears to be a " Can't Take My Eyes Off You
" (cont'd) You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like Heaven to touch
wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived and  thank God 'm alive
Becky removes the sheet, revealing a  dressed like  as he appeared on the cross: long hair, beard, crown of thorns, loincloth
The    so they move freely
(Hands of stigmata
) (cont'd) You're just to good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
Becky - - a la William Shatner's "Rocket Man" - and  around the Jesus mannequin doing the jitter- bug, the twist and a slow dance (his arms on her shoulders)
, - -  - Iris approaches Lisa who's given her outfit to Amber
'mon, Lisa
You're up next
quit
And, uh, since my costume, y'know, was okay'd a month ago
'm givin' it to Amber
Amber breaks a smile
Taped music
Gladys, mic in hand, joins Becky for a big hug
Boy, 'd hate to follow that
Wow
Becky exits, pulling the wheeled Jesus behind her
(cont'd) Voice of an angel, that one
Iris runs self-consciously out on stage, whispers in Gladys' ear, then runs back off stage
(cont'd) Uh,  was just told that contestant number seven, Lisa Swenson, has quite the pageant
(cont'd) Well, these things happen
At any rate, we still have one more contestant - number eight, Amber Atkins
Gladys exits
taped hip, hot   starts
Suddenly, Amber glides into
(Now wearing Lisa's costume, sleeves rolled up
)  Her feet burst into an amazing routine
The loud drum beats seem to fly from her hands and feet as they punctuate the rhythm
There's no glitz, just unbelievable skill
It appears effortless as she floats around stage
Like watching Michael Jackson moon walk for the first time, you can't take your eyes off her
She concludes, center stage, with the The audience goes Amber takes bow after bow - they love her
Gladys enters quickly, mic in hand
(cont'd) Okay, okay, okay
Well, now, it's finally time to say good-bye to our judges, so they can go make the toughest decision of their lives
They look nervous as hell
relaxed Hank sniffs from a paint soaked bag
-   - Judges stare nervously at the camera - clip boards in front of them
Hank's   from the paint soaked bag is obviously getting on John's nerves
(
) So who get's the crown
How are you going to figure this all out
Uh, we're gonna, y'know, compare scores and uh, figure out a-a winner
kCause we don't know the winner yet
mean, - don't know who Jean and Harold picked
No idea
Did Gladys send you in here
know the winner
know the winner
know the winner
No you don't
Shut your goddamn mouth, you son-of-a-bitch
Nerves shot, John suddenly  himself across the table at Hank
Wait a second
You shut it
You goddamn retard
Hank freezes, then starts to wail
--
Come on
Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat
Hank stops crying and goes back to the bag
For fuck's sake, why didn't ya leave him with a sitter
Hank begins crying again
Real nice
You know the sitter's dead
: - Girls, in gowns, sit in silence
Becky and Amber sit at opposite ends of the room
There's obvious tension
So, anyone talk to Janelle
Yah- brought her some flowers this morning
She's in the room next to my mom
She's super happy
Girls ad-lib
She's happy
Why happy
(cont'd) Oh -- the blow to her head made her deaf
Girls ad-lib "Oh,  see

Another of  follows

Like gasoline
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico
My dress'll reek
Listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny
Now get your ass up there and show me some teeth
- Amber and Leslie, in gowns, look unhappy as they stare straight ahead, exhaust fumes - that appear to come from the swan's ass - cover them and their old convertible
Amber, if  die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck
Yeah
And the bite marks on my ears
(slowly turning) Yes

Yes, Leslie

Hank bats at them like Frankenstein and the torch wielding townsfolk

Lester tries to pull her away from the crowd
(cont'd) Let go-a-me, you old bastard
She grabs a  2X4 off a float and starts swinging it
