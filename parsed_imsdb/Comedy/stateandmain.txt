The fireman is out front with a cup of coffee
Ann hands him a poster

Yessir, they should be trussed up, thrown off some high building

Who's that
Whoever spent ten, f'teen thousand dollars, a new traffic light, you could grow old, paint your house before it lets you cross the street, and then, not fix the pothole

She goes into the washroom area, and comes out with two towels
She throws one to Joe, and begins toweling her hair with the other
She hands him some plans, which show photos of the old printshop, and copies of the Old Waterford Sentinel, circa 1900
Yes, it's a lovely idea
She emerges from the back room
She has stripped off her wet jacket and shirt, and put on a light stockboy's jacket

He motions the cop to take out Barrenger
Marty sees Joe in the back

Marty, as he leads Joe down into an alleyway, and into a backyard, hung with washing on the lines
Yeah, hi, pal

Cal has followed them into the bookstore
He speaks privately with Ann and exits

You told me you were writing
Don't you wear your reading glasses to write
Marty's cellphone rings and he answers it
After a pause, he hangs up

He exits, leaving Walt alone with Ann and Joe
Ann
She sees something down the other street
We see Cal, the policeman, enter and start toward Joe
We see Ann restrain him, and speak to him in the b

for several moments
He shakes his head, and she reasons with him, and there is a pause and he looks at Joe, and exits
he's going to give you a couple of minutes
Joe walks Ann off to the closed back door of "The Waterford Players
" What am  gonna do
You got to tell 'em that you saw the accident
Don't you

(pause) If  tell them, they'll, if  tell them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll

But that's what happened
But it'll stop the movie
Maybe they'll be other movies
They'll

The masthead reads, "Waterford Sentinel, All the News of the Mountains, 'You Shall Not Bear False  Witness

She stands looking at Joe
Cal enters
They look towards him
Lotta hubbub on the street
'm taking you the back way
- Cal walks with Joe, still holding the newspaper
As they round a housecorner, Walt appears and walks with Joe
(checks watch) Let's speak English
You've got to help the side
You want me to lie
To the contrary
want you to tell the truth
(pause) The truth is, you can't tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing
You don't remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on
And you have a fertile imagination
Imagination wants to fill in the blanks
Now you aren't sure, then they have nothing
Bob walks free
As he should
(pause) Joe: wasn't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart, you know
The people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them
And they fear us
Because we tell the truth
About our lives
Now, this is a damn roost, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to make a name for himself
If we let him do that, if we let him do that, then we're being false to our community
to our community, you understand
To our world
Cause you are a part of that world, now
You have to take off the steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex
(pause) And be part of your world

And you stick with me
You write one, two more, you stick with me, and you'll direct the third one
You are a part of this world
You have to do the right thing: we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff, literally is at our door
You have to stand with the troops, Joe
That's the bottom line

Yes, yes, it's
yes, it's Claire Wellesley, and we're going to try to get a look at
The crowd moves away, revealing Ann, standing in front of the realtors, looking at a card in her hand
She looks up to see Joe coming toward her
Extreme close up, she smiles
Extreme close up, Joe
He looks toward Ann, sheepishly
Ann, as she looks down at the card in her hands
It is the real estate placard for the printshop, marked "under agreement
" Ann, as she rips it up
- Joe, coming in, a hangdog look on his face
(to Joe) They need those rewrites on the "Old Mill" scene
Joe nods
Continues through the lobby

Though  can tell you a few things about his dietary requirements
The old bellhop is packing up his lunchbox and changing into his streetclothes
'  - Joe enters and takes out his pad and pencil
He sits on the bed
On the pillow, he sees and picks up a black and red hunting jacket, onto which the one foot short sleeve has been knitted in baby blue
There is a card in the picket that reads "Better than new -- it's got a story
"  He puts it down
He picks up his notebook, in which he has written: "The Purpose of the Second Chance is to allow you to make the same mistake twice
" He stops by the mirror on the chiffonier into which he puts the lure, which still has the attached card reading "The truth may not always set you free, but it's always the truth - Joseph Turner White
" Joe goes to the bed
On the bed is a small package tied with ribbon
Joe opens it
It is a small thing of maple syrup
Attached to it is a card reading: "It is your invention which makes everything sweet
" He takes off his jacket, and picks up his notebook
Out of his jacket pocket falls the old copy of the Waterford Sentinel
He picks it up
' The masthead: Waterford Sentinel "The Voice of the Mountains, You Shall Not Bear False Witness
" He puts the newspaper down
Picks up the maple sugar card again, and looks at it
He sees an arrow and turns it over The back of the card reads: "How about an Associate Producer credit
" He takes the paper, balls it up and throws them into the trash
He picks up the fishing lure which is resting on the typewriter
Puts it into his pocket, thinks again, throws it in the trash
Shakes his head, and picks up his suitcase and starts packing

little kid, on a scooter is going in the other direction
Mornin', Doc
Mornin', Billy, where ya goin' in such a hurry
Down the corner, see the ruckus
Watch the curbs, now
Joe, as he stands across from Ann's house, looking at it
He holds his suitcase
(') (of his suitcase) Where you off to
, uh
'm leaving
Why
perjured myself
(pause) told a lie, and  ruined my life
That's what  did
(shrugs) don't suppose you could help me with that, could you
Turn back the clock, or something
Give me back my, give me back my purity,  don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you
But what is truth
Eh
Ain't that the thing
What is true
It's the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie
Cravat's s'posed to point down to accentuate the genitals, why'd you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his ears
Joe turns to see Doc swigging from his flask
In the b
g
, we see the bellhop walking
Aren't you supposed to set an example for people
Nope
'm just supposed to hold people's hands while they die
What'd you say your problem was
just swore my life away, back in that
(as he sees an older woman off on a porch to the side) Mornin', Chessy, how's the back
Doc walks off to his office
- ruined my life
Isn't that funny, that you can actually do it in one moment just like they say
ruined my life back in that courthouse
Bellhop, who has walked up beside him
What courthouse
Courthouse back in town
Town ain't got no courthouse

Ain't got no courthouse

Joe, as he turns back into town
On the Station Master

He smiles, and lights his cigar
- We see the crowd has moved down the street and the "Courthouse" building is empty
- Joe enters, and the camera takes him into the deserted building, through the courtroom and, in back, he sees Ann standing alone
He walks back to her, through the doors which appear to be the Judge's chambers
We show that the walls of the Courtroom are the set, and we are back in the "Trials of the Heart" set
Ann is sitting there
Reading her play by Joe White
He looks at her for an explanation
Maude, the court reporter woman, is sitting in the b

Ann is knitting in pink wool
thought you needed to get it out of your system
Ann moves to embrace Joe
They hear screaming
They turn
- At the end of the alleyway, in Main Street
We see Sherry, the Mayor's wife, leading a crowd
a blight, a blight and an obscenity
that's good English, isn't it
How's that for entertainment
At the mouth of the alleyway, on Main Street
We see: The baseball on which is written "To Chucky from your best friend, Bob Barrenger
" The distorted face of Chucky, heaving the baseball
Bob Barrenger being led through the crowd, a baseball hitting him in the back of the head, as troopers hustle him toward the courthouse

Joe and Ann walk toward the crowd at the mouth end of the high school

and to exterminate this vermin, yes, use that term, who have abused, who have desecrated, yes, the license granted to them by a gracious nation
Marty and Walt, standing near the monitor, looking on
Shaking their heads
The monitor
Doug, seen through the monitor

(begins to wipe his head) As he does so, a makeup person comes in and sponges him
(') thank you
you want to clean up
Doug, seen "live" in the next room, starting to wipe his brow
Yes, thank you
Marty and Walt watching Doug, as he walks down the hall
Five minutes, and we're going live to the network

They stop and Joe comes up to a State Trooper
As we press forward the Mob begins to reverse direction and passes back towards Joe

Well give yourself up to someone else

Hiya, Annie
Give yourself up to her
And we see Joe has moved up to the  monitor, where we see Doug, in the Science Lab, talking to the press, and holding his money bag in his arms

And the lesson is this
that everybody needs a second chance
You, me, and these fine, film people here
You know, they have a high profile, but that doesn't mean they aren't deserving of our trust, and of our respect
You know,  think there is a lesson here, and the lesson is this: it is a lesson of Tolerance
