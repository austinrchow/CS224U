The Corporal looks forward

The police car pulls to a stop, just as the woman does a pirouette and falls over backwards

Old pine trees poke through the snow cover that blankets the neighborhood

(late 20s) half hidden under a heavy dress coat, walks down the street
He stops by Howard's driveway
Need a hand
(turning) Yeah
Could ya grab me those two by eights
Ted walks up the driveway, grabs the wood slats, makes a ramp by leaning them against the rear bumper
(cont'd) Thanks
Howard maneuvers the snowmobile down the ramp, his back turned toward Ted -- who has taken out a small cam-corder and is taping Howard

No
Name's Ted

Lets you and me talk

At first, he appears to be working, until we realize that on his computer screen pixilated Zombies die in silent anguish beneath an unholy hail of bullets Miami Dolphins sticker is the sole cubicle decoration
As the tape finishes, a smattering of  from his colleagues
Ted gives a small wave over the cubicle wall

Just happy to give something back to Liberty Capital

Ted immediately hits a key that turns the screen to a spread-sheet
That was really cool
It was like
watching "Cops"
He was pretty spry for a man with a herniated disc
You know,  don't want to bitch or anything, but you were supposed to take me along on that one
Couldn't find you
know you know this, but the sooner they think  can handle calls on my own, the sooner they'll kick you back down south
've been hearing that for 13 months and six days, Cam
After a while, it gets a little old
(off Cam's look) Next time, okay
Good enough
Cam moves off

The two men sit in silence, smiling politely at one another

Branch is about to answer when Ted enters with a slim file
Paul Barnell, Ted Watters
Handshakes
Paul makes steady eye contact
Ted notices
(cont'd) Mr
Barnell wants to talk to us about his brother's life insurance policy
Ted sits and flips open the file
Raymond, isn't it
Yes, Raymond
You see, as 've already explained to Mr
Branch, he's been gone for five years now, and thought it might be time to
move on
By move on you mean
cash in Raymond's policy
Ted smiles to himself
just thought, well, it's pretty unlikely he's still alive
My Dad always wanted us to be able to look after each other if anything should ever happen
And to be frank, money's a little -- understand Mr
Barnell, but here's the thing
With no actual body, under Alaskan statutes a person must be missing for seven years before he or she can be legally declared dead and that's not withstanding an investigation period where concerned parties can take up to another year to file interventions concerning the motion
So, even though your brother's status is undetermined at this point, there's really very little we can do for you
Ted flips the file shut
Case closed
Branch, not entirely happy with Ted's demeanor, forces a smile
Of course we are extremely sorry for your loss
Branch looks at Ted
Ted turns to Paul
Oh, absolutely

But that's miles away
Here on the outskirts is a rapidly failing five store strip mall; a "Porn-a-copia"  Video store, hair stylist, small engine repair shop, fish and chips joint and the "Barnell Great Escapes" travel agency
We might notice a big trash dumpster in the corner

Hang on, hang on
First off, how did you get my cell number
(Beat)  Because it's for mechanical and medical emergencies only
Paul, wound up, taps his brakes too hard
His mug falls, the lid pops and the coffee proceeds to soak a stack of papers
(cont'd) Great
(back into phone) No, 'm not
just
give me a second here
Paul parks his car, gathers the soggy papers and gets out

He pushes aside an orange garbage bag, guided by the faint sound of the other person

He takes a moment to compose himself, then realizes his phone is still in there
He opens the dumpster lid and very quickly reaches in, grabs his cell and hurries off

Behind him, the Repo-Men are picking up a newish computer monitor and walking toward the door

Not for dogs

Only problem
The man's legs don't want to fit
Paul leans down and grabs an uncooperative appendage
He grits his teeth, looks away as he kicks at the knee

Paul fights nausea
But with the leg now out of joint, the man fits

It's a medium sized apartment, littered with guy stuff although bowing to advancing signs of feminine influence

Tiffany hits the space bar
The caller's number flashes on screen
By the second ring, an electronic timer kicks in and a complete file on the caller appears with name, address, background, pets
She smiles, hits "enter

How are you today
Mr
Williams
(pause - she listens) Well, we are all registered psychics here
just had a feeling you'd be calling
What's up
tired Ted walks inside
Hey Tiff
Tiffany looks up, then holds up a file folder with the words " - " in big black letters
(to caller) Your  remote control
Okay
Ted , gives her a quick peck on the cheek as he wrestles off his winter gear and heads to the kitchen
(cont'd) need you to clear your mind
Ted looks into the fridge, making up new words to the song "Escape
" "If you like frozen enchiladas, getting caught in the rain
If you're not into
something brownish
" Ted pulls out some Tupperware, tries to figure out what's in it
Tiffany, still wearing her headset, appears behind him, grabs a Diet Coke from the fridge and kisses him on the cheek
It's stew
'm not sure it's still good
Aren't you with a customer
They're concentrating
Ted grabs a fork, takes the pot and sits at the table
Tiffany goes back to her desk and flips through her magazine
(through a mouthful of food) So
How's the tea leaf business today
've decided from now on to ignore you when you're ignorant about my work
And it's going very well thank you
(reconnecting to the caller) Mr
Williams, 'm seeing sofa cushions
Do you have a sofa
Good
Glad  could help
You here from that software distributor guy
No, but  did crack that code problem
You know how sometimes when you're running Beta versions you -- English, please
There was a boo-boo, but  fixed it

Now thought we'd agreed God is everywhere, but not specifically in your coffee pot
Jeez, Tiff
Jeez, Ted
Do  tell you how to do your job
(kidding
kind of) No, but then again 'm not a computer aided pseudo psychic, so if you're looking for moral equivalence
Before you say anything else that may keep us from having sex ever again, let me ask you something
She picks up her magazine
Tiff, please
always get these wrong
That's why we keep trying
Now, Love is Sacrifice test

God says he's busy with a famine right now, but you should keep praying

Psychic Pals
Is this the first time you've called us Mrs
Tiffany at her computer, enters the name "Margaret Barnell" into her database
Tiffany works a "mute" button as she points back to the magazine
(cont'd) But stupid quizzes can be illustrative of potential relationship problems
(to her caller) Margaret, 'm getting the feeling this is an anxious day for you
Ted, cooking pot in hand, walks over to her desk
Our only relationship problem is you're running a $1
99 a minute carny scam out of my living room
Don't call it a scam
(to the caller - startled) Excuse me
What
You've got to learn to channel that rage, Margaret
(to Ted - playful) You didn't just call this your living room, did you
meant ours
Ours, ours, ours
Tiffany returns to her call, but keeps looking at Ted

He enters the shop
Faded travel posters cover the walls
(40s), a career office gal, smiles at her boss as she assembles a life-size stand-up cardboard display for Aloha Airlines
It features a dark Hawaiian beauty holding a softball sized sea shell
The shell juts out of the display giving it a 3- quality
Morning Mr
Barnell
Coffee
Thanks Avis
Looks good
Paul, shivering, hangs up his coat as Avis picks up a promotional Aloha Air surfboard (the old display) and walks it to the back
(cont'd) Was November this bad last year
(
) Well if we didn't have the weather what would we talk about
Did you send the computer back
Paul moves to his desk
Yeah, it was not working
Any calls
(
) Just that fellow from Municipal Power and Electric told him you sent the check in weeks ago, but some people don't like to listen
Paul turns to look at the snow covered empty parking lot, then at a photo of his wife Margaret on his desk
He mentally gathers himself
Something
strange happened last night Avis
(
) What was that
Did
you ever meet my brother Raymond
(
) The one who went missing
Uh huh
Well anyway last night there's a knock on the door and there's Raymond, just
standing there on the doorstep
Avis arrives with the coffee and the mail
Didn't you have him declared
Dead
No
mean, they said he hadn't been gone long enough
(smiling warmly) Good thing in hindsight
Paul puts the mail down on the desk and start to flip through it
Lots of bills, most marked past due
He finds a "pre- approved" credit card application, sets it to one side
(cont'd) So where was he all these years
Lower 48
Said he wanted to get away from the cold
Where 'bouts
(looking up) Sorry, what was that
Where was he living
Paul, a flash of panic, looks over at the Hawaii display
He keys on the shell
Florida
've got an aunt down there
Where 'bouts

Despite her casual attire she is immaculately made up as she walks to the front door, opening it on -- a young wholesome  smiling through the cold
Collecting, Mrs
Barnell
Daniel, you pussy little cocksucker
'll get my purse
The paperboy, unfazed, smiles as Margaret walks off
It's 12 dollars
missed you last time

Jimbo, a bear of man, keeps watch
He's nervous, a little out of sorts
thought stuff didn't smell when it was frozen don't know why we have to-- Dave wants visual confirmation, he gets visual confirmation
We have a chance to move up here, so let's just-- Like the guy's not gonna end up in a land- fill, anyway
You ever ask Dave what he did
Whatever it was, he told him if he did it again, he'd snap his neck
(smiling) Whoops, he did it again
(off Jimbo not getting it) The song
From that girl
No response
Gary,  now, keeps digging, finding nothing
(cont'd) So how'd it feel
mean, not when you did it, but, like now
don't want to talk about it
Gary hops inside as his actions become more frantic
Still no luck
He stands
Not here
Jimbo glares at his partner
(cont'd) Serious
He's gone
Maybe he wasn't
Don't even joke
Maybe the trash was emptied
Looks pretty full
Hey
(ducking down) There's a little fridge down here
(standing) If we would have shot him at least we'd know for sure
was following orders
And if you hadn't started a screaming match, no one would have called the cops and we wouldn't have had to dump his -- Fine
Sorry
Fine
'm just saying
maybe you didn't break it all the way
(walking away) It was broken
'm just saying
maybe it was like hypothermia and he just looked dead
It - was -

As she puts her hand on the latch, she notices the pile of pop cans on the floor
She tugs on the door
It opens just a crack before the chain stops it
The frozen head peeks through the slight gap
Margaret , tries to push the fridge door closed, but the body is in the way
She gives the door a hip check
The door latches shut while something frozen and brittle inside

Why is the fridge in the garage chained shut
How's my Angel tonight
Blow me
Dinner's almost ready
You feel like some wine
feel like some wine
Paul walks to the oven, opens the door and pats the chicken
Stone cold
Sweetie, here's a crazy thought
don't feel like chicken tonight, why don't we order in
Fuck it, okay
There's actually something we need to talk about
It's about Raymond
He's back

Behind the chicken, Margaret doesn't look happy as Paul starts to explain
She rushes from the room

There ya go
Let me just say that my brother, old "Puddles McBarnesy" did better than he should have
younger, somewhat tipsy Paul comes into frame, puts an arm around his brother and smiles
What'cha saying there Raymond
Wha'cha saying 'bout me
Raymond shakes his brother's arm off his shoulder
Enough,
(sing-songy) Ray's a little jeallllllllous
This is the one that got away, right Ray
The crowd  as Paul reaches over and musses up his brother's hair
Raymond, furious, grabs his brother by the lapels and throws him roughly to the floor
The laughter stops

) Leave him alone, ball licker
And shut that thing -- The screen turns to snow
We are
Paul at his desk, watching the video on a small  in the wall unit
He turns his attention to a large cardboard box filled with documents, souvenirs, old report cards
On the  playing behind him (the second part of the tape), Margaret is pictured on a cruise ship, sunning herself
Paul, obviously behind the camera, watches as Margaret takes a tropical drink from a ' tray, who promptly dumps it all over her
But instead of the expected burst of profanity, Margaret just That's okay, don't worry about it
(as the waiter walks off) 'd like the next one in a cup, please
Paul puts aside a faded hotel postcard from Hawaii and digs out an insurance policy out of the box
On the last page is a list of the payouts
Loss of a limb: $100,000
Loss of thumb: $5,000
Accidental death: $1,000,000
And, as an extra bonus, Raymond's birth certificate
Perfect
Paul takes out the credit card application from work, and starts to write

But he's dead

Yeah
Take off your coat
And your shirt, too
Jimbo knows better than to argue
He strips down, exposing his corpulent middle-aged belly to the chilly winter winds

It was our first time
No one gets it perfect their first time
You too, Sweetie
Gary is about to comply when the sound of a  on the tobogganing hill causes them all to look over, just in time to see '  shoved to ground

We're in the middle of something

Jimbo turns back to Dave, shrugging sheepishly
Is he
He's fine
Look, we can take you there right now
We'll show you
Behind them on the hill, Gary tries to retrieve his nephew's Snowrider from the Bully
He is failing
Show me what
An empty trash dumpster
It was supposed to look like an accident
was hoping to see it in the paper
So help me, if this guy pops up somewhere
While Jimbo does his best to stay warm, behind him on the hill, Gary can only watch as the Bully slides away

Big homo
He won't
He can't
He's -- Proof, Jimbo
like to know my money's well spent

Oh  see
No, you see that must have been Raymond

He checks the bacon's consistency with a fork
Still pretty raw
He takes the bacon and lays it on a plate
Beside the pan on the counter sit a baseball cap and a stapler
Paul carefully takes each strip of bacon and staples it to the peak of the ball cap
He holds it up
The bacon hangs down like fringe
Margaret appears in the doorway

Drops of blood hit the snow at the body's feet and disappear
Paul drapes the steaks on the body, tucking one under an arm, the other hanging from a pocket
He pauses for moment, then pulls out a container of lard and, fighting his own revulsion, smears it across the dead man's face

(looking at the ridge) If it's any comfort to you, he likely wasn't eaten while conscious
Did he say where he'd been living, before he came home
Florida
He didn't really talk about it much
He brought us this shell
Paul holds up a sea shell, obviously from the display at his office
Tears well up in his eyes
(cont'd) It's really all we have left
He'd been gone for five years
We'd given him up-- --for dead, yes sir
How did you
Anonymous phone tip from some Jamaican guy
(Paul shows no reaction) Said he saw what looked like a body
We tracked you through his
Just like on
Boyle nods sympathetically (cont'd) 've got to see him
Please
Paul starts to make his way to the body
Boyle stops him
Mr
Barnell,   should warn you, an animal  attack isn't pretty
There's not much left
Paul nods
They make their way over to the tarp
Boyle pulls it back
(cont'd) Is that your brother, sir
Paul leans in-- the man's face is hamburger
Paul nods
They chewed his ears off
What kind of animal does something like that
Normally 'd say bear, but these tracks and the feeding pattern indicate wolf
It's rare, but it can happen
Boyle pulls the cover back over the body
Boyle hands Barnell a clear baggie with the dead man's wallet inside
(cont'd) Your brother's personal effects
We've got some people with the victim's assistance program who can help you through this

On his back-swing, Tiffany throws her arms around him from behind

Yup
Wanna hit some of mine

He turns,
They kiss as she playfully starts to grope him
Now this is definitely a violation of Golf Dome policy

So maybe later  can
check your grip

My dirty talk sucks

Tiffany gives him a peck and flits back to a nearby chair
He hits one, skying it into a low hanging light
You know in some states they actually do this outside
Tiffany looks over at one of the tacky tropically-theme'd mini-golf holes
So how many insurance companies are there in the United States

Raymond Barnell
Could you
Boyle moves toward the head and pulls back the covering
Ted recoils
Cam leans in for a closer look
Ouch
That's gotta hurt
So what's your line on this
Just what it looks like
Wolves got him
Maybe a grizzly with insomnia, but we didn't find any tracks
Would it surprise you to learn his brother tried to cash in his policy two weeks ago
You trying to tell me Mr
Barnell chewed off his brother's leg
Doesn't that make you the least bit suspicious
Mr
Watters, this is a nice simple ending
We like nice simple endings
But shouldn't you-- Ya know,  don't know thing one about insurance, but 'm guessing it's your job to find a way not to pay these poor people
Hey now, we're just like you guys, gotta run down whatever leads we can find
Ted walks down to the head of the victim, pulls out a camcorder and starts to tape the body
Detective, we're an insurance company, not the Salvation Army
Mind telling me what you're doing
They gave every claims team a video camera last quarter
you'd be amazed at how it cuts down on litigation
We had this case two months ago where this mother of six was claiming
've got my own war stories, thanks
You mind stopping that
Just doing -- Your job
Yes,  caught that

The police told us what happened, how are you folks holding up

Who's out there
Paul reaches back, and, as discretely as possible, grabs the door handle to keep Margaret from opening it
Obviously, my wife's very upset

) Paul, the door's stuck
Margaret starts to  rhythmically on the door
(ignoring her) It's been a tough, you know, when something like this happens you just have to ask yourself

You can see how stressful it's been,  should really go now

This isn't a standard case
You were there when this guy came in looking to cash in
'mon, it stinks
Secondly, if the police say this guy was
Eaten by wolves
Sir
(incredulous) Eaten by wolves, then we've got no case
Did you see Mr
Barnell on the news last night
Last thing we need is bad
don't want this thing Valdeez-ing on us

Branch, 'm sure head office would take a rather dim view of our -- Corporate's view will be whatever  tell them

That's right, yes
Any idea what he was doing out there
He'd go for walks
Hikes,  mean
Hiking
How sporty
Was he a big hiker
Not sure  follow
Did he hike more than once a week
Or was this a
one time thing
Can  ask why you need to know all this
Just trying to tie up a few loose ends

Would you just give him the money already
It's not my decision
know that
'm just saying
Sure
You understand though
Absolutely
It wouldn't take much
Full disclosure to the pizza consumer
'll be sure to pass that along
The delivery guy leaves
Ted walks back into the living room
Tiffany comes over, grabs a slice
Why you gotta argue with the service industry
The problem with people today is they don't expect anyone to tell the truth
We've just come to accept lying as acceptable
If this is another passive/aggressive shot at Psychic Buddies, all our ads state "for amusement purposes only
" Tiff, it has nothing to do with
look, just forget it
You remember being amused, don't ya, honey
What is with you anyway
Want to know what's "with" me
'm on the verge of cracking the biggest case of my career, one that corporate has to notice, and nobody gives a crap
Not my boss, and not even my girlfriend
So this is my fault
No, it's not your fault
just want to live somewhere where road hazards don't have antlers and the pizza doesn't have to be delivered by dogsled
Tiffany storms off as Ted flops onto the couch, swipes the snow from the top of the pizza box and hits play on the
"What kind of outfit is this, anyway
Are we an insurance company or a bunch of dim-witted amateurs to write a policy on a mug like that
" Tiffany turns from the bedroom door, almost in tears
You know, even though Edward
Robinson wins, everyone like Fred MacMurray better
She  the door
Ted doesn't move, lost in his own world

'  /   -                                   72 Ted and Mrs
Wherry sit on plastic covered furniture
The mounted heads of several dozen dead animals, foxes, wolves, elk, surround them
Ted takes notes
It was terrible
Just terrible
Raymond should have known better
(re: the mounted heads) All these yours
Greatest sport on earth
Moved to a compound bow two years ago
(whisper) Arthritis
Less draw weight
She mimics pulling back an imaginary bow with her bony hand
(cont'd) Coffee
'm fine
Did you talk to Raymond at all when he came home
Was he getting along with his brother
No
Only saw him the once
Never spoke
Waved to him
Waved
He was clearing my driveway
Raymond was a real hellcat when he was younger
But like they say, time mellows even the hardest soul
Was he much of an outdoorsman
thought it was Paul at first
Have you met Paul's wife
Now there's a story
Not that 'm much for gossip, but  think Raymond used to have a -- Mrs
Wherry, 'm sorry, but -- Sorry
Did Raymond like the outdoors
Not so much, no
Liked living out here at the cabin, though
think he had some friends on the police force
Have you talked to them
They'd pull up here day and night, always looking for -- 'm sorry, did you say you thought it was Paul who did your driveway
Well in a ski mask you can hardly tell who's who
Now, how 'bout some jerky
've got it drying out back
73
-                                                    73 Ted at his cubicle, thinking hard as he chews on some jerky as he works the phone
Snow whips by outside the window
(just waiting to cut in) That's really super, Simon
Now how'd you like to run some names for me
Ted sees Cam reflected in his dark computer screen
Annoyed, he puts his hand over the receiver
(cont'd) You mind
Now, now
Let's not forget who's pulling double duty
(hanging up) Simon, 'll call you back
(to Cam: forced) Sorry
Much better
So
Turns out our Mr
Barnell is mortgaged to the nuts
His business is about one step away from chapter 11
Plus it's like his brother Raymond never existed
He's got no credit history, no nothing for the last five years
Ya know, not having a credit history isn't actually a crime
People around here have been known to swap a snow mobile for 500 pounds of venison
Doesn't exactly leave a paper trail
Yes, but he was in Florida, someplace
Plus, the only thing he did after his recent "reappearance" was get some new  and a new credit card
Didn't charge anything
Wow
Less than nothing
It's something
No it's not
in my humble, junior investigator's opinion
The phone
Ted picks up
Watters, claims
Yeah, hang on
(to Cam) It's personal
promise
Cam shrugs, walks off
Ted waits 'til he's gone
(cont'd) Mr
Barnell
Your ears must have been burning, was just -- sure, what time
Ted is scribbling down something on a pad of paper
74
-  (  )                                       74 Tombstones, barely visible through the blowing snow, dot the top of a small hill on the outskirts of town
small group of mourners try to keep warm
Paul and Margaret, Avis, two other  and the  huddle against the cold
When someone is taken from us at such a young age we often ask ourselves, why
What possible purpose could this serve
The Minister is temporarily lost from view
(cont'd) (just a voice in the white) Why is God, who is a loving God, capable of such things
The snow clears
Paul, a pillar of strength, discreetly checks his watch then sneaks a concerned look at Margaret who busily grins at everyone in sight
Ted's car pulls into the parking area
75
'  /    -                          75 Gary and Jimbo sit in their vehicle, watching as Ted gets out of his car and is swallowed in a white out
He reappears a moment later farther up the hill
We should have checked the funeral announcements right away
Shoot
76
76 wind  rocks the casket just as it's lowered into the frozen earth
The funeral breaks up quickly as Paul and his wife shake hands with the minister
That was lovely, thank you so much
Margaret, Paul, you two get some sleep
Paul looks nervously at Margaret, who is about to reply
As her mouth engages, a gust of wind obliterates most of her words, except for
nun banger
The Minister smiles, he must have misunderstood
Absolutely
Paul turns to see Ted approaching
blast of snow obscures his view
When Ted reappears, he's just a few steps away
Mr
Barnell
There was no hurry on this, we could wait until-- It's
We just wrapped up
This is my wife, Margaret
As they shake hands, and Margaret opens her mouth to speak
(cont'd) Why don't you wait in the car, sweetheart
Okee dokee, smokee
Margaret smiles and totters off
She's under a little strain right now
Ted looks down the hill at a small group of  news vans, the just now venturing out into the cold
see the media's here
They don't give people a moment's peace, do they
called them
(surprised) Really
Well, they've been asking me to talk some more about Raymond
thought now might be an appropriate time
And you'll just happen to mention your heartless insurance company that hasn't paid off your policy yet
had to borrow money for the casket, Mr
Ted
You are breaking my heart
No,  doubt that
They asked me to bring some photos of Raymond
Guess it's gonna be a pretty big story
He pulls out some shots of his brother
They whip around in the wind and blowing snow
(cont'd) Of course, we could walk over there together
You could tell them how deeply moved you were by this tragedy and how
the check is on its way
Ted thinks, grudgingly impressed with Paul's ploy
Enjoy your press conference, Mr
Barnell
Paul stuffs the photos back in his pocket and walks down the hill
Ted watches him go, is about to leave when a gust of wind forces him to avert his eyes
Looking down he sees a photo of Raymond Barnell, on the beach in swim trunks
Must have fallen
Ted pockets it and moves on
A76
'  -                                                 A76 That's your plan
How tough can it be
You ever try digging through six feet of half frozen sod
We'd need a back hoe
Can you operate a back hoe
Do you know where we'd get a back hoe
We don't even know for sure
Oh please
Don't you think it's a pretty neat coincidence
Maybe we just go explain it to Dave
He won't take it well
Then 'm all for new options, here, Gary
(beat)  If we give the money back-- Hey, wait a minute, now
We did the job
We deserve the-- did the job, Gary
know, because  haven't been sleeping for the last week
don't know why you're letting it get to you like this
Look, let's just not rush into anything
It's my turn to step up
know that
'm on it
They look on as Paul is interviewed by the reporters

Hey little, Bambi
Where's your Mommy
Gettin' it from some ten point buck
Yes she is
Yes she is
Just then, a  sound from the garage causes the fawn to bolt
Margaret turns, suspicious
She picks up the portable phone as she moves toward the door
79
79 Gary sticks his head inside the now unchained fridge, grabs a can of soda from the door rack and closes the door
moment later, he reopens the door
There, hanging off the frosty inside, is a chunk of the dead man's hair and scalp
Gary pulls it off, not sure what it means, but sure it means something
Unseen behind him, Margaret steps into the garage
She quickly assesses the situation
Stay away from our fucking appliances
Gary spins, shocked to see Margaret
Lady, just calm down
Margaret, eyes wide with fear, unleashes a hailstorm of soda cans, knickknacks, gardening implements and anything else she can lay her hands on
(cont'd) Hey
Would you
Lady
have a-- He tries to close in on her, but the torrent of stuff (a rake, a Whipper-Snipper, an old pair of skates
) keeps him pinned down
Finally, he manages to grab his gun from his pocket
But even as he raises it
Bissel Handvac catches him flush in the face
(cont'd) Sud of a bit
He drops to his knees, grabbing his nose, which is now gushing blood
Margaret reaches for her portable phone and starts punching numbers
You are in so much trouble
Gary stands, pissed off, gun aimed at Margaret's head
Lady, so help me  -- Gary ducks as the phone whizzes over his head and smashes against the garage wall
He stares at her
Game over

For the cruise ship trade, mostly
Usual stuff, stuffed animals, your huskies, your moose, your baby seals, your whales, your walrus -- They came in through there
(looking up/duh
) Yeah
Through that
big hole in the roof
got a list of all the things that are missing
Ted stares up at the sky through the ceiling
How much
Uh, we figure about 200,000, plus fixing the roof
Now  know you guys are gonna bust my -- Fax over your estimate
We'll have you a check by Friday
(taking Ted aside) Ted
Maybe we should take a look at their inventory list first
This is a simple case, Cam
Bad guys, through roof, stole stuff
Let's clear it and get going
should tell you
we also had some VCRs we were holding for another company
That could run another couple of

You wanna wrap this up
(off his look) Gotta go primary some time
Cam shrugs-- "sure

Now  noticed a nice looking computer in your office
Why do you think they left that

Gary, who's still bleeding from the nose, sits across from her
You try and rape me,  swear to Christ 'll bite it off
Gary looks confused
The doorbell , playing "Tiny Bubbles
"  (We stay in the living room as Gary answers it
) (
) What's going on
(
) Okay, now here's the thing, just keep an open mind
They both enter the room
Jimbo looks at Gary, is about to smack him when
So what now, you gonna get me smokin' from both ends
Gary and Jimbo have no idea how to react
Margaret senses their discomfort, starts to relax
just came to look around, but she started yelling and hitting me
Oh please
How the hell is this solving our problem
How is this stepping up
Just listen, okay
Yeah, listen, if the fat from your neck hasn't stopped up your ears
Jimbo looks confused
Gary ushers him into the other room

Jimbo's not happy
This is not what we do
It is now
Where would we stash her
Your place
Too small, plus we'd have to get her in and out without anyone seeing
And 've seen that sty you call an apartment
See, it's just a bad idea
Yeah
Maybe
(a possible idea) You see the whirlpool tub
You can't be serious
It could be like a little getaway
Off Jimbo, considering this

Hey Maggie-magster
How ya -- Paul stops short as he sees Margaret, Gary and Jimbo sitting around the table
Margaret's mouth is taped shut
Paul is about to lunge at the men when Gary slides his gun into view
He stops
(cont'd) What are you people doing in my house
Mr
Barnell
You have something that belongs to us
,  don't know what you're talking about
Do you remember a dead man you found in the dumpster behind your office
Paul, shocked, tries to hold it together
No,  can't say that
mean that would probably stick in my mind a
dead body
Think hard Mr
Barnell
He tosses the frozen lock of hair onto the table
(cont'd) Think hard
Paul realizes he's screwed, gestures to the living room
85
/   -                                        85 Gary sits on the sofa as Paul paces
thought it might be some weirdo sex thing, ya know
But you look like a pretty straight arrow
So then 'm thinking, maybe it's a scam
Maybe somehow our friend is worth some money to you
Paul face lets Gary know he's dead on
(cont'd) So what'd you collect
We, we had a life insurance policy on my brother
It was for
100,000 dollars
You know, it's always you quiet guys
Here's how it's going to work
We stay here with your wife, you go get our guy
Here
We even see you or a cop even roll past, she's dead
Plus you'll have to explain how you scammed the insurance people out of their hard earned money
We'll call you in three days
Have the body and, let's say 50,000 dollars for our trouble
Screw with us, we start mailing your wife back to you
Gary pauses for dramatic effect
(cont'd) Starting with her feet

He gone
Gary nods, well pleased with himself
He was scared
Really scared
You used the feet thing, didn't you
No

Hey, little help here
got Pop Tarts
She sees the living room wall -- it's covered with charts, diagrams and theories
Ted on the floor, remote control in hand, replaying the shots of the body over and over
(cont'd) (re: the screen) Don't tell me, "Sound of Music"
(no reaction) Honey
You
Shhhh
This is the important part
Ted rewinds the tape, hits play, rewinds it again as -- Tiffany watches, quietly at first, then with growing frustration
Finally, she walks over and grabs the remote control
(cont'd) was watching that
This stops now
This case is making me and you crazy, especially you
No response
Tiffany plops on the sofa and starts leafing through Ted's files
(cont'd) Ya know,  am trying to be supportive
Leading experts agree that's the number one complaint men have about their mates
don't have any complaints about my
you
(re: the file) Dead guy's got a record
Cool
Yeah
He beat the hell out of some guy in bar fight
Broke the guy's eye socket
Tiffany scans the file, then looks up at the screen
Honey
Yeah
think you should read this again
He looks
She tosses him the file

By the stove, Gary is cooking, an apron tied like a bath towel around his waist
We don't have any money, you know
Lady
Please
If you want Raymond's fucking insurance money
we don't have that either
It's none of your business what we want
Gary goes back to his cooking
Then
(cont'd) So how come you talk like you do
mean, cursing all the time
It's a disease
It's called Tourette Syndrome
can't control what  say
Turnip
Really
You've taken a handicapped person hostage
hope you're proud of yourself
saw this thing on  where they said people with that don't usually curse
They must have got it wrong
don't think so
It was a movie of the week based on real events
Don't most of Tourette's people twitch and stuff
Margaret just glares
(cont'd) (knowingly) Oh,  get it
You got a spice rack
Over the sink
And what's that supposed to mean
Nothing
Cumin
On the left
(beat)  And 'm not
crazy, it's a physical disease
Sometimes  can control it, and sometimes -- You can't
Want to know what  think
think this "syndrome" is something you read about somewhere and figured, hey, works for me
Ass-rimming ball-sucker
You can completely abdicate your societal responsibilities, say whatever you want whenever you want, and slough it off on a illness
Maybe should catch this thing
"Gee, sorry Your Honor, have a disease that makes me rob 7-11s
"  It's called really need a Slurpee disease
You've never robbed a 7-11 in your life you shit eating fuck-weasel
What kind of man threatens a woman with a gun, anyway
You are so faking it
Oh, 'm faking it
Is this how you get your kicks, you over-compensating pussy little fart sack
Gary, suddenly tense, puts down his spoon and picks up his gun
Hey
Keep your voice down or the gag goes back
You don't scare me
If something bad was going to happen, my psychic would have told me
Gary awkwardly chambers a round, starts gesturing with the gun, trying to look tough
(cont'd) You put that down now you little bitch, or so help me, 'll start yelling so loud you'll have to shoot me
Gary, confused and embarrassed, doesn't know what to do

Wherry waves from her deck
Paul, sorry to hear about your brother
(Paul gives a sad smile) You moving in
Just for a bit
She'll come to her senses
They always do
Oh, the septic lines are frozen, so you'll have to use the outdoor commode

' :   7 year old time capsule of a party that was never cleaned up; beer bottles, ashtrays and general garbage
(to himself) Would it have killed you to clean up before you left, Raymond
Paul picks up a small box from the floor, looks at the label
Edible Panties
He puts them on top of a stack of porno mags, neatens the pile, then heads out
- : Paul lying in bed, wide awake, but in the same position we've seen him in when he sleeps with Margaret
An electric heater glows beside him

Paul heads to the door
Who is it
'  (
) State Police
Is there a Mr
Barnell here
(as he unlocks it) Yes, is there something wrong-- As he opens the door a crack, a gloved hand shoves it open
The force of the blow sends Paul staggering backward, landing in a heap against the wall where a picture of his family tumbles over and shatters on his head
(40s), a bear of man, enters, picks up Paul and throws him through the serving kitchen serving hatch
Raymond leans through the hole
Hello brother
He walks around, takes a copy of " Today" and throws it at Paul
Raymond
Is that
Page 16, Paul
That's why  love " Today", news from every fuckin' state
Don't you want to read it was eaten by wild fuckin' animals
But ya know, despite that, 'm feeling pretty God-damned chipper
Paul beats a hasty retreat, stumbling through the mobile home with Raymond right on his heels
Raymond, let me tell you what happened here
We all thought you were
Dead
Yeah,  got that impression
But you had dropped off the face of the earth
And you just decide to make it permanent
But there were no records of you anywhere checked
With that, Raymond kicks his brother hard in the ribs
Paul doubles over, gasping for breath
In certain lines of quasi-legal employment, using your actual  can be a hinderance
But despite the reliance on aliases, it's nice to have your actual birth certificate to fall back on
Gotta tell ya, Paul,  was pretty pissed
Raymond is about to kick him once more, but Paul puts up a hand, begging him to stop
Raymond, relents, then bends over and helps his brother to a sitting position
(cont'd) But then  start to think, Paul's no idiot
He woulda told 'em it's not me
Unless
Paul can only sit there and
Raymond sits beside him on the floor, pulls out a cigarette and lights it
(cont'd) So what is it
Frame job, lawsuit
Life insurance
Figured
So where's my money
Your money
(a beat) They're still
investigating
What you get
Paul considers whether or not Raymond would even remember
Fifty thousand
(with a shrug) Almost worth coming back for
What's the split get half
(not quite trusting him) Okay
Sure
(changing the subject) You look good
Lost some weight
Gave up carbs
So what are you doing out here
She not go along with it
Who
Margaret
How she hold up, anyway
She's fine
Actually, we're not doing so good right now
Any kids

Hey
(snarky) Hey
Talked to our friend
We're okay for now
How's everything here
Oh, just great
(to Margaret) Seventy six, perfectly normal
What a shock
Gary jumps up and storms into the bathroom just off the kitchen
He's a little over tired
It's been a rough week
(for Gary's benefit) Really
Why
You and your life partner in the shitter having trouble picking a China pattern
(shocked) Um, um
Gary
(
) Your turn to deal with it
If  come out of this bathroom 'll put a bullet in her head, swear to God
have a psychiatric disorder

He looks as Ted's car pulls up
As Ted walks toward him
Mr
Watters
You said on the phone something about a resolution in our claim
Mr
Barnell
Why are you staying out here
Paul thinks about this for a long time
Then, finally
My wife and , we're having some problems
Kind of understandable  guess
Seeing as how you killed that man and dumped his body out in the woods
You mean Raymond
No
Not Raymond
Definitely not Raymond thought it was at first, but that's what was throwing me
'm not sure  appreciate your tone
My tone, Mr
Barnell
You are going to jail
will personally see to that
really think you should go now
You are a liar and thief
Paul stabs his shovel into a snow bank, then walks to Ted
You know Mr
Watters, 've had a pretty rough night, so if you wouldn't mind just leaving
Paul tries to guide Ted away, but slips and falls on the snow
Ted, rolling his eyes, reaches down to help him up
(noticing the bruises) Hey
How'd you get all cut up
(
) What's say you just move away from him
Ted, with his hands still on Paul, turns to see -- Mrs
Wherry, from her porch, a compound bow aimed at his forehead
(cont'd) You all right there, Paul
'm fine, Mrs
Wherry
Just go back inside
can drop him if you want
'm fine
Really
(turning to Watters) think you'd better go
Ted backs to his car, gets in and drives off
Paul brushes the snow from his jacket, reaches up, touches his bleeding forehead (the fall having reopened the wound)
've got some fishing line if you want me to stitch that
Paul waves her off, then stares at the blood on his fingertips
An idea slowly takes hold
95
-                                        95 Raymond pours whiskey into a 7-11 specialty cup as Paul  pulls off his coat
He give you the check
No
He thinks
It'll be fine
Maybe 'll pay him a little visit
See if we can speed up the process
You don't have to
figured out a way to take care of things
Yeah,  was watching from the window
Paul, agitated, pulls the blinds shut
You can't do that, Raymond
If someone sees you
Ya know,  been thinking there, Paulie
About what
Raymond walks over to Paul
Paul tenses, expecting to be hit
Raymond moves right by to refill his drink
After we get her back from these guys who grabbed her, you think your wife'll be able to keep her mouth shut
don't think
Crazy people talk a lot
And  think if you tell your therapist something, they can use it in court
She's not
she doesn't have a therapist
(taking a slug) Still, might wanna think about it
Think about what
You crossed over into the bigs now, Paulie
Fraud
Consorting with felons
Got to "cowboy up
" Cowboy up
Get tough, ya suck-hole
'm just saying sometimes a man has to make problematic decisions
Cull the heard, so to speak
(off his look) Paul, come on, just kiddin' around, here
Don't be such a fuckin' stick
Raymond, an enigma, looks at Paul, then grins -- just kidding
Paul relaxes
Raymond tenses -- not really
Paul's not sure how to read his brother as they shoot looks at one another -- sibling rivalry ad absurdum

thermometer outside on an office tower shows a brisk minus 20
Workers bundle themselves against the cold, hurry to work past the drifts piled alongside the road

Ted moves closer
() haven't called the police yet, but 'll tell you it was certainly tempting
Ted opens the door to his boss' office
Paul doesn't notice
(cont'd) 've had some dealings with, diseases of the mind, and  can tell you he is not well
Branch, obviously worried, stands
Watters
Glad you're
Mr
Barnell was just telling me about the
meeting you two had
caught that, yes
As you can see
well, Mr
Barnell has some
concerns
Paul turns to look at Ted
He has a large band-aid on his forehead, scratches and bruises on his face
It takes a second for the dime to drop
You don't think  did this
Paul gets up and moves to the other side of the office
(cont'd) Oh come on
never laid a hand on him
Ted, his neighbor says
otherwise
Now just hang on here
Let me show you something
Ted digs into his briefcase
He takes out a video tape, the police file on Raymond and the photo of Raymond Paul dropped in the snow
98/99
-                                                  98/99 Paul and Branch listen intently as Ted paces, the / plays shots of the dead body in the background
See
Where's the birthmark
Your brother's police report listed it
(reading from the report) "
large purple birthmark, upper left thigh
" (leaning into the screen) But  don't see it
Not on this body
You can see it in the picture
See
Ted points to the photo;  Raymond, in the summer, wearing shorts with a blotchy purple spot clearly visible on his leg
(cont'd) So what, Mr
Barnell
Did it just disappear
Did it just
get better
Ted grins
His moment
Finally
Seconds feel like minutes
It
did get better
Did it now
Well how in the world did that happen
Raymond was always
bothered by it
When he came back from
Florida, he'd had it fixed
Laser surgery
like removing a tattoo
Paul looks at Branch
It's an excuse Ted hadn't thought of before
He did not
You taped my brother's body, in the morgue
Paul stands and grabs the photo from off the desk
(cont'd) And this
You stole pictures of my family
And taped his naked body
What kind of sick company are you running here
Oh for
he's lying
It's obvious he
Paul, feigning fear, shrinks back into the corner
(cont'd) This is crazy
All we have to do is dig up the body
check the leg for scars
(bingo) Dental records
Paul goes white
He hadn't thought about this
That will be just about enough of that
Mr
Barnell, 'm sorry it's all come to this
We'll have a check brought over to you tomorrow morning
Paul nods, stressed and strung out, he hugs the wall as he walks out
After a moment
Sir, with all due respect, he's -- Jesus, we're lucky he's not suing
Now tomorrow, you deliver the check to Mr
Barnell with a complete apology
Fine,  understand how this looks -- It looks like you beat the hell out of one of our policy holders
Now send Cam in here
Why
Well, while you were off on your little Easter Egg hunt, your junior found us an out on that warehouse robbery
Head office is bumping him a level
(fuck me naked) 'll go get him
They're very keen on him
They want me to feel him out on a transfer -- Ted has left the office,  the door behind him

Hello
yes, 'm wondering what city department would be in charge of

(to himself) Hang on Mag Pie, just hang on
Paul puts a hand to his chest
Suddenly dizzy, he drops to his knees and starts to
Tears well up in his eyes
After a few moments, the storm passes
Still on his knees, the person on the line comes back
(cont'd) Yeah, hi
was wondering if you could
but  was
sure
He sits there, on hold again, waiting
101
-                                       101 Ted walks to his car
As he opens the door --
fist to his face drops Ted
Raymond in a ski mask, picks him up, opens the car door and lays Ted's head on the door jamb
Listen you little prick, we've had just about enough of this
You get me
Raymond leans onto the door, Ted  as his head is squashed in the vice
(cont'd) So let's just settle this right now,
We want what's coming to us
Ted tries to say "yes
"  Raymond releases his grip on the door, leans down and grabs Ted's wallet and walks off
102                                                                         102 103

What in the blazes are you doing
Hey Paul
Took care of our little problem today
We should see some serious money any time, soon
Could
have a word with you

/  -                               104 Paul pulls the sliding door closed behind Raymond
(whisper) Are those
(serious) Prostitutes
(laughing) sure as hell hope so, cause Jehovah's Witnesses won't lick your lolly no matter how much you pay them
How did you get them here
Raymond pulls out the credit card Paul got for him
Put it on my plastic
See, got my name on it and everything
It's every where  want to be
You can't use that
You're supposed to be dead
They'll track us down
You think they give a shit who pays the bill
Think for a minute, will ya
Paul turns, trying to compose himself, when he notices  a handgun sitting out on the counter
What
Raymond, what is
this
Paul pokes at the gun, sending the barrel spinning around to face him
Raymond grabs it and stuffs it into his pants
That's "muh gun," Paul
Paul's cell phone
(cont'd) Don't be long
The little spinner's yours
Paul picks up the phone as the party revs back up
Yes, hello
Sorry, what
105/106 :    /  -                          105/106 Jimbo is on the wall mounted phone
You having a party, Mr
Barnell
(embarrassed for Margaret) That's
that's not right
Margaret, now gagged, sits where we last saw her
She tries to talk through the gag
Gary's staring at his watch, calling out seconds
Thirty, sorry, startinnng
Now
Paul pulls the kitchen door closed with his free hand
There's no party
let me talk to my wife
Hang on
He hands the phone to Margaret
Gary leaps up and stops him
Twenty-five
Jimbo pushes past him, pulls down Margaret's gag and holds the phone to her
Why are you counting
Paul
Are you entertaining
(a wave of relief) Oh God, oh Jesus
Margaret, are you okay
(
) Paul, we got any more chips
Fifteen
(grabs the phone) The body
Have you -- (beat) No, 'm the other guy
Have you got the body
(shouting) Paul, the carrot little weasly one wants to carrot screw me with his sick carrot little cock
And he's messing up my kitchen
Carrotcarrocarrot
Jimbo, annoyed, puts the gag back in Margaret's mouth
You sick
Don't you hurt her

Ten seconds
Yes

Put Margaret back on

As he turns, he sees one of the  (30s) standing in the doorway
She gives Paul a come hither look

He keeps his parka on
Avis stands to greet him
Hello
Can  help you
(
) (icily) Mr
Watters
Paul comes around the corner
He extends his hand, shocked to see the bruises on Ted's face but knowing exactly where they came from
Mr
Barnell
have your check
Thank you,  appreciate that
(an awkward pause) Please, sit
Ted sits at Paul desk, reaches into his brief case and pulls out an envelope and several forms
(cont'd) Have a little accident, there
was mugged
The cops say it was just a random act of violence
But who knows, right
(re: documents) You'll have to sign
Ted slides the papers across to Paul, then gets up and moves around over Paul's shoulder
(cont'd) Where 've marked it with an
And
'd also like to apologize for my -- No, please
You don't have to
Paul, at a loss, starts to read the paperwork
He pulls open his desk drawer to grab a pen
Ted looks down, sees the Sea Shell in the drawer
That's quite the shell
(picking it up) It was a gift from Raymond
He bought it for me from Florida
It's all we have to remember him by
Paul puts the shell down on the desk
That and a million dollars
Things really worked out for you, didn't they
lots of cash, newly single guy
'm not single
so you gonna head down to Club Med
See how much fun a big bank roll can buy
Mr
Watters,  love my wife
Very much
Ted can't help but look confused by this simple, yet sincere declaration
Can we level with each other for a moment
(Paul nods) Did you -- Before he can finish his question, a   entering the office with a large box
Avis
Avis
There's no answer
She's in the back
(cont'd) Will you excuse me
Paul gets up to deal with the delivery
Ted, sullen, picks up the shell and turns it over in his hands
Avis enter from the back
She smiles at Ted, then sees the shell
Oh, that's where you went
She takes the shell and reattaches it to the display for Aloha Air
Ted, confused, walks over as Avis snaps the shell back into place
That's quite the display
They do some very nice in store promotions
Paul walks back, shocked to see the shell now back on the display
Ted just stares at him
(cont'd) Here it is Mr
Barnell
(to Ted) thought someone might have walked out with it
It's not the best neighborhood
Avis walks back to her desk
Ted and Paul hold their look
Finally, Paul walks back to his desk and the paperwork
So, right here, by the
Ted nods
Paul signs
Ted takes the envelope with the check, hands it to Paul but doesn't let go
Paul tries to pull it free
He looks at Ted who looks right through him
Just then, the lights go out
They're all in the dark
(cont'd) We, uh
Avis
Call Municipal Light and Power and let them know 'll
stop by in a bit
Paul looks at Ted, embarrassed
Ted finally lets go of the check

Ted shakes his head, gets up and walks out

He's got his home phone bill in front of him

My wife
do you think it's okay to do something kinda bad to someone if you think they're gonna do something really bad to someone else
Sure
What if it's a really bad thing
Well, you probably shouldn't break the law if you can help it
Are you really sure they're going to do this other thing
'm
don't know
He said some things
He said he was joking, but
think he might
Don't think, know
How close are you to the other someone else, the one you're trying to protect
(crying) just,  just
Have you ever felt like that
Like your own life didn't even matter, as long as
(touched) Listen to me, Carlos
Your wife is an incredibly lucky woman
know, relationships are tough, but you do what you gotta do to keep it together, okay
Remember, love is sacrifice
Ted can't help but  at the mention of this familiar phrase as he looks at Tiffany
Tiffany glares back at him
(sniffling) guess you're right
Now you get tough
And remember, this call is for entertainment purposes only
Call me back and let me know how it goes
Tiffany hangs up and walks out
Ted tries to catch her eye and let her know he was just kidding
He can't
She goes

He appears be steeling himself for something

And with that, Paul disappears into the back bedroom

/   -                        114 Paul sits, waiting
After what seems like forever, Raymond walks in
Who's doing what
Margaret
You know that Stockholm Syndrome thing
The movie
When you fall in love with your kidnappers
Get the fuck out of here
went by there
She was in the bedroom with the big one
(quietly) Not the first time, either
(a flash of panic) With other men, not kidnappers
For real
Her therapist
And some guy she
hardly knew
Wow
Sucks to be you
Shut up
Raymond, a momentary flash of anger, sits on the bed beside his brother
Paul does his best not to flinch
always knew she was a fucking tease
Yeah
Guess you were right
Well, you want my opinion
(Paul nods) don't trust her, Paul
Never did
You think she'd
really mess things up
Only one way to make sure she doesn't
Not sure what you're saying
You remember that pooch Mom had
Crazy little Jack Russel with the bladder infection
Whole basement stank
Nothing you can do but put the thing out of it's misery
And yours
You
You sure, Ray
Trust me, Bro'
Leaky dogs, crazy women
Two things no man should have to live with
As Ray stands to go, Paul nods, his heart ripped apart for any number of reasons

Avis looks up
Mr
Barnell
didn't expect you back today
Nice jacket
Well
am
And Avis
Yes
You've been with me for five years
Paul
Can we make it Paul
Paul enters the back room, closes the door
Avis walks over
Sure
just thought it was more professional when people were around to call you Mr
Barnell
(
) Avis
There haven't been any people in here for months
No one comes in here, unless they're looking for pornographic movies or deep fried fish, neither of which we carry
So you can call me pretty much anything you want and it won't impress the customers at all because we don't have any
Are you , Paul
Paul opens the door
Avis is surprised to see billowing clouds of down floating in the air behind him
No Avis, to be frank 'm a little frazzled right now
Now could you get me some tape, my passport out of the safe and two open-ended tickets to Paraguay
Paul shuts the door
Avis gets to work

The room is white, very clean and fairly new
The men wear large orange overalls, their white construction safety helmets sit on the table beside them
Trouble is the city keeps cutting us back and cutting us back
Raymond and Paul, wearing his big red parka, enter
Excuse me, are you Arnith
sips his coffee, points to his name patch but doesn't look up
(cont'd) Great
was told to give you this
Paul hands Arnith a folded form
Arnith puts his hand out, forcing Paul to move the form to him

Got it from the coroner's office
My brother didn't want to be buried
How'd you know
Know what
That he didn't want to be buried
He left it in a letter
And you just got it now
Ya know,  don't mean to be rude here, but 'm not sure this is any of your business
That's entirely possible
Bill stifles a
Raymond is about to tear out Arnith's spine
Paul holds his brother back
,  don't think this is anything to be flippant about
appreciate that, Sir
But 'm on a union specified break right now, which means you are talking to me as a private citizen
Now as a private citizen  can pretty much say whatever  want to
If you talk to me in 15 minutes  can assure you, you will be afforded every courtesy as specified in the workers policy guide and recently ratified in our latest collective agreement dated -- Sorry
'm just -- Trying to get your brother out of the ground
We couldn't be more pleased
You've arranged for transportation of the remains
We're gonna take him to go
See, now that's a problem
We can't release the body into your custody unless you are licensed by the state to convey deceased persons
Good point Bill
Bill knows exhumation policy
You can look it up but 'm betting he's right
You come back with a bonded agent and we'll get right on this
Paul thinks for a moment, digs into his pocket pulls out five crisp, new hundred dollar bills and  them on the table
'll give you five hundred dollars to go get him now

Jimbo walks in, takes a seat and a scoop full of food
We set
Yeah
How you feel about the turnout by Summit Hill where the snowmobilers park
Fine
They all dig in

Just the sound of chewing
Finally, he can't wait

Tastes like a rectal polyp

He looks closer -- it's a "For Sale" sign

Barnell
don't think so
Ted staggers through the snow to the sign and drunkenly pushes it down into the snow

You know why
(
) No
You want a refill
Does a duck shit under water
Paul walks in with two glasses
He hands Raymond the larger
(cont'd) Any trouble getting the bank to handle that much cash
They said it'd be in tomorrow by -- Right, right, you told me
Then all we have to do is get her and the thing
Hey, remember that time in school, when  jumped out and scared you, and you fucking pee'd all over yourself

His finger grazes the trigger
but it's suddenly all too real
Paul lowers the gun, takes a deep breath and tries again
Not wanting to be sprayed by Raymond's gray matter, he half turns his head
Another idea comes to him
Paul picks up a plastic picnic plate to use as a shield from the blow back
He gets ready to fire again, then makes the mistake of looking at Raymond
Maybe it's the light
maybe it's the small puddle of drool on the cushion, but he looks almost angelic
Paul stares at his brother
In the kitchen, Paul fills a glass with water, empties the pistol's bullets into The cup and hides it on the top shelf

Just as he finishes
(half asleep) What's going on
We're out of coffee
But 'll be right back
Still early
Not to worry
Raymond has already rolled over

'  -                                             134 woozy Ted is trying to keep Tiffany's phone from
Finally, he puts on the headset and hits a computer key
It connects
Yeah
Hello
(coughs)  Hello
He hits a few keys on the computer keyboard
The screen pops to life
The line connects
Oh thank fucking Christ
Is Tiffany there
No, she's
He pulls off a yellow Post It note stuck to the computer
It reads:  "Coffee made
Don't touch my computer
Back in 10
" Unseen on the computer screen beside him, the name "Margaret Barnell" pops up, along with all her pertinent information like pet's name, husband, delusions
(cont'd) She'll be back in a few minutes
You want to try later
Well you should know, fuck-wit
You know there's a man with a gun in my shower, right now
Ted, distracted, turns as he hears the doorknob turning
Hang on, she's on her way -- Finally he notices the computer screen
Holy shit
(cont'd) (tentatively) Mrs
Barnell
But before she can answer, Tiffany walks in carrying a laundry basket, pulls the headset off Ted's head and holds it up to her ear
'm here, Margaret
How you feeling today
Give me the headset
Ted grabs for the headset, Tiffany resists
(to Ted) What is wrong with you
135
/                                                   135 Margaret sits in the same position on the bed by the phone
Gary, in the shower, belts out some
Christ, where do you want to start

'                                                          136 Tiffany shoves Ted, who loses his balance and stumbles backward
She puts on the headset
Sorry about that
Mrs
Barnell
Could you speak up a bit
Ted is at her side, trying to listen in by pressing his ear to the outside of the headset
What's she saying
Something about the gay mafia taking her to a park to kill her
Can you hand me my Help Line list
What
Wha
Ted's throat seizes up again
He stumbles to the kitchen, gulping water from the faucet
Tiffany watches with some amusement
Margaret, are you sure these are real people in your house
Find out where she
His voice locks up again
More water
(listening to a profane ramble) Well then it's a good thing you called
Nope, not seeing any problems, but hang on, let me really concentrate
Ask her
Ted's not doing much better
137
/                                                   137 Margaret hears the shower stop running

She hangs up, places the gag back in her mouth and hustles back into place

'  -                                          138 Ted, pulls on his boots and his jacket
In his hand, an address scribbled down on a piece of note paper
Tiffany watches, not happy
You're sure this is it
She specifically mentioned the cock-sucking turnout up the highway where the snowmobilers hang out
'll call later
won't be here
Excuse me
The phone
Tiffany lets it
know relationships aren't all sunshine and roses, but 'm really not having fun anymore, and  don't think you are either
God, now's so not the time, Tiff
Maybe you have to be like this right now, and 'm just not in a good space to deal with it
But
But what
Maybe we shouldn't be like this together
Tiffany gives him that look every man who's ever crossed the line for the last time is all too familiar with
Ted stares
Words fail him
Finally, his only recourse is to hurry out the door which shuts with a
Tiffany lets the phone continue to  as she stares at the door
Sadly, she hits the computer key that picks it up

How are you Mr
Bennett
think she'd be fine with you remarrying, but hang on, let me concentrate
Ted opens the door, steps back inside
Come on
(to Ted) Really
've been cutting you out of my life and as a result our normal communication channels have been blocked
think you coming with me would
would
He's reaching, but Tiffany looks cautiously hopeful

realize the potential of our
interpersonalism
If you're going to be sarcastic
'm not being anything
Swear to God
Okay
Why do you want me to come
(total sincerity) Cause if you don't, then 'll have to stay, and 'll be mad at you and eventually we'll break up over it, and as bad as my life is right now, that would make it a million times worse
Tiffany smiles, genuinely touched
(into the phone) Mr
Bennett, she's totally cool with it
but listen, you're gonna have to call back
gotta go help my boyfriend

He listens to the beautifully wrenching Iz-Kamakawiwo'Ole's version of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" on the radio
(The music continues over the next two scenes
) 141
'   -                                         141 Ted and Tiffany walk out to their car
They sneak looks at each other, not entirely sure what emotional sign-post they just passed
142
142 Gary and Jimbo, with Margaret, hands bound, walk into the garage
Jodie (the dog) runs out after them
Margaret looks at Jimbo, who takes the dog and gently puts him back inside

Then
Okay, it's called the listening game
You talk,  listen, and  can't interrupt
Then we switch
Doesn't sound like much of a game, but
can talk about anything
Yes
Ted smiles, and launches in
144
'  /   -                                       144 Gary leans into the backseat and holds a magazine in front of Margaret's face
See the little box down there
Lists all the symptoms of that Tourette's thing, and you don't have half of them
And
And
And you're faking it
Magazines don't prove anything
Gary, can we just try and get there in peace
Magazines prove everything

145 The residence seen from a distance
(
) That little prick
As the camera rushes the mobile home, from inside comes the sounds of a very angry man
Then, just as we're at the door, it
Raymond stands in the doorway, a mountain of anger in a hastily pulled on parka
He's holding the clock radio by the cord
He checks his wristwatch, then smashes the clock radio against the trailer
Stalking toward his car, he checks the pistol in his side pocket, then, almost as an afterthought, opens the clip
No bullets
He smiles

The road from the turnoff is about 200 yards long, leading to a plowed out parking area
The road is the only way in or out
Paul's car takes the corner and heads toward the parking area

'  /   -                                     147 Margaret in the back, Jimbo and Gary in the front
You can't be serious
'm still not sleeping
Jimbo
Come on
It's a thought, okay
With hard work, you can live okay as a civilian
After all this
Yeah, after all this
Don't you go soft on me, Jimbo
Margaret  through  her gag in the backseat
Gary and Jimbo pretend not to hear her
They drive on in silence

Ted has just finished
Tiffany has been paying rapt attention
So this is kind of like a really weird "Law and Order" episode
Sure
guess
And if Paul Barnell already killed his brother
Maybe his wife is next
Cool
My turn
(Ted nods) Now a healthy relationship is
Hey, here we are
Ted takes the turnoff to the parking area

She looks up to see Raymond walking in, gun in hand
Raymond lays it on the counter
Calibre
152
152 Ted's car pulls up at the far end of the lot, about 200 yards from where Paul, Gary and Jimbo are parked
Paul's car is in between Ted's car and Jimbo's
Paul gets out of his car, as do Jimbo and Gary
Paul looks for Margaret in the back of Jimbo's car, but she remains lying down on the backseat
Mr
Barnell
'll assume you've got our friend back there
Yes
You can let her go now

He's about to get out when Tiffany stops him
(gently) So, do you have a plan here
'm gonna go talk to him
You mind staying here
guess
So when do we call the cops
Soon as
if he actually is doing
something
'll wave, alright
Tiffany gives him a quick kiss
That's a very good plan
Ted's about to jump out of the car, but has to pull back his door as another vehicle slides in beside them, the driver locking his brakes and sliding into the snow embankment
(cont'd) Tourists
Ted, a confused look on his face, looks over as Raymond gets out of his vehicle
(cont'd) What
That was
Who
Ted, too excited, fumbles with his seat belt as he tries to jump out of the car
154   ' :  '                                           154 Black
The lid opens
Jimbo, Gary and Paul look in at the frozen body
Jimbo recoils at the mangled mess before him
Gary reaches down and touches the well-chewed body
How do we know it's him
Come on
Where would  get another one
Good point
Paul hands him the ransom money
155                                                                         155 156
156 Ted rushes up beside Raymond
Excuse me
Aren't you
Raymond Barnell
know you
(confused) You're
You're dead
Raymond shoots him a look
Clearly this was taken as a threat
Ted can't help but step back
(cont'd) That came out so wrong
Raymond sizes up Ted, then looks off to Paul's car
Go away, now
Raymond walks on
Ted, realizing he has no choice, runs and jumps in front of Raymond, blocking his way
Okay,  don't know exactly what's going on here, but if you would come with me to my office, just for a few minutes, it would really help me out with my boss
Raymond steps around Ted
Ted stays with him
(cont'd) Look, 'm not trying to screw with your life at all, but you can't just walk off with a million dollars and expect people to-- (stops cold) How much
See, your brother has, and  use this term carefully, stolen a million dollars from my insurance company
Now if we-- Before he can finish, Raymond hits him with an elbow to the temple
Ted drops to his knees, but even as Raymond tries to walk off, Ted manages to grab his ankle

She smiles at him as, with great care, he helps her out of the car and presents her to her husband
It's all over honey
It's all over
Did they hurt you
(smiling/whisper) Does food poisoning count
Have you been eating
You know me when  get busy
She touches the bruise under his eye
Did you fall
Just a little
(to Jimbo) Hey, we're gonna get
That's when Paul sees what Jimbo and Gary are watching
Raymond kicks Ted in the head, turns, spots Paul and breaks into a run
Paul seems frozen, but just for a moment
Who the hell is that
Paul
Paul discretely takes off his red parka and drapes it over Margaret's shoulders
(quietly) Honey,  need you to start walking to that hill over there, alright
Why
'll catch up in a bit
Now, no matter what you hear, just keep going, alright
And if 'm
late or something, just look in the coat, alright
Margaret nods, kisses her husband quickly on the cheek, then starts to walk off
Paul, Gary and Jimbo watch, transfixed at the down-parka'd shit-storm that is headed their way
(nervous) Jimbo
(yelling) million dollars, Paul
You really think you could take me
Again
What million dollars
Gary and Jimbo look over at Paul, somewhat confused
Raymond's ten yards out, and they can now see he's taken out his gun
He's aiming it at Paul
Paul looks over his shoulder at Margaret, who's having some trouble making it up a snow covered hill
Gary's hand slips into his pocket, grabbing hold of his gun
Raymond, oblivious, moves right past
159
'                                                                159 Tiffany finally looks over at Ted, who's just getting to his feet
She bursts out of the car

/  '                                             160 Raymond reaches Paul, takes the gun and points it at the top of his head
Paul's eyes shut tight, expecting the worst
Raymond
please
But shooting your brother is tougher than it looks
Paul opens his eyes
Raymond tries to pull the trigger again, but can't
He moves the barrel six inches to the right and shoots Margaret in the back
She drops face first into the snow
Paul's world ends
Ears , he rushes toward his wife
Jimbo can't believe it as Gary holds him back
Hey
What the fuck
Raymond, a look of relief on his face, turns to Jimbo
(cont'd) She had nothing to do with this
And you do
But even before Raymond can raise his weapon, Gary pulls his gun and gets it pointed (shakily) at Raymond
(cont'd) Oh put it down, Nancy
You first
Gary
Just -- Raymond drops his gun to his side
Gary smiles, too happy he won the face off
You win, tough guy
Gary, trying to be cool, flips the gun to his other hand
As he does--
The bullet rips into the snow about six feet from Raymond's feet
Raymond glares at Gary
So does Jimbo
(meek, apologetic) Sorry
Jimbo lunges for cover as Raymond  back
Gary, truly terrified, closes his eyes as he squeezes off shots on the run --
One bullet bounces off Paul's car
One hits Raymond
With a quizzical look on his face, he drops to his knees
large crimson stain forms on his jacket
Everything goes quiet, except for the sounds coming from
Paul, almost crazed with grief, cradles his wife's body
Oh God
Oh Jesus
(muffled) Oh fucking hell
can't
breath
Paul gently turns her over
Margaret, alive, unharmed but winded, tries to catch her breath
(cont'd) Paul
Someone kicked me
Paul feels around the bullet hole and pulls out a stack of money, now embedded with the slug from the Raymond's gun
He starts to weep tears of relief
Can you stand
Is
The Pope

Okay, easy

Oh Jesus, oh God
Jimbo gently takes Gary's gun

As Jimbo puts an arm around Gary and helps him to the car, he sees Paul, arm around Margaret, coming their way
Everyone stops
look passes, then both couples move off

Spotting Raymond, he walks over, kicks the gun away, then leans down
Raymond's not dead, but he's close
Paul has to turn away
(laboured) Look at me, you little
Paul turns back, not angry, not frightened, just a little sad
Raymond, taken aback for a moment, tries for one last verbal shot, but all he can manage is
(cont'd) Puddles
And Raymond dies

-                                                162 Paul turns back to his car when he spots a delirious, damaged Ted stumbling toward him with Tiffany desperate to drag him the other way
Where do think you're going
Ted, leave him alone
No, no, no
have been beaten, humiliated, had my head squeezed by a guy
and  am getting some answers, right now
Ted, barely able to stay on his feet (concussion) gets in front of Paul, and just stands there and waits
Paul can't help but feel bad for the guy
Okay
Well go ahead
(re: his left ear) can still kind of hear out of this one
(a long pause) love my wife, Mr
Watters
And when you love someone,  mean, really love someone
The punch hits Paul on the top of his head
He stumbles back, but Ted is on him before he can move out of range
It's a strange looking fight between the younger (physically spent) and older (emotionally drained)

Barnell
Margaret and Tiffany jump in, trying to pull the two men apart

Paul and a bloody, beaten Ted sit up front with Margaret and Tiffany in the back
No one speaks, until
They call this the listening game
Mr
Barnell, you get to go first
Ted glares at Tiffany, but her look instantly softens him
Ted looks at Margaret, who looks expectantly at Paul
Ted shrugs
Knock yourself out

Hey
Hey yourself
So where you want to go
Somewhere close
My three o'clock's been moved up
Cool
You alright about everything
Yeah
The life policy was written on his brother, and he did, you know, die
may be rationalizing a bit, but ethically  think 'm okay
Good

Wish you could have come
Saw some dolphins today
Frisky little buggers
They were even playing our song in the bar
Have been pondering about your question, and  think my answer is "yes

) (cont'd) Paul, you ready
Paul looks up to see Margaret
Dressed in a coat, she is standing in the middle of the living room, now empty save for a few boxes and a very ugly floor lamp
Paul flips Margaret's letter over, and we now see it is the faded Hawaiian Hilton postcard from the box in his den
Paul puts the postcard in a shoe box full of keepsakes, and tucks it under his arm
Margaret picks up Jodie, whose in his carrying case, and walks over
sounds from outside
It's their cab
As they walk to the door
How you feeling
Pretty damn good
can tell
Can you

(off her look) Fine

As he takes the corner and bumps over the curb, the momentum sends the half-eaten body (that Gary and Jimbo stuffed into the backseat) to an upright position
They drive on, oblivious
Looks like weather
