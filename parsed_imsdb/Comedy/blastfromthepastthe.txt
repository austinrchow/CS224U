- by Bill Kelly and Hugh Wilson : 1 - on a    of a mountain range with the distant lights of the San Fernando Valley behind it
as a   drops down into the picture
on the jet's exhaust flame
Have the words " " come out of the flame
Then there is a and the flame intensifies
The words " " jump out of the exhaust as the jet momentarily shakes
The  feels the jet shake
But he looks at his indicators and everything appears to be normal
He relaxes
We begin with a    of the jet and allow the plane to move away
Then : " , 1962" before continuing the main titles
popular recording from that period has been playing throughout
'   - Start on a  of the   ,   and attached to the roof of Calvin's shop
(We can hear military air traffic chatter on Calvin's Hallicrafter radio
) Then move down to the window where we see  Webber tinkering with a gadget at his work bench
Calvin's very pregnant wife  appears
The music becomes source
For Pete's sake, Calvin
We've got guests
Sorry, honey
just got to fooling with this darn rheostat
Well, put it down and come in
You bet, hon
They exit the workshop for the house
Calvin has left the ham radio on
( ) Tower, Wolf One is five miles from the overhead
( ) Wolf One, Tower
Report the numbers
You're number one for the overhead
( ) Wolf one
- The   looks down at the flashing red light on his control panel
He speaks into the oxygen mask that hangs loosely from his helmet
Tower
Wolf One
've got a problem here
() Say your problem, Wolf One
Are you declaring an emergency
Stand by
One
, , , and  (30's) pass around the buffet table
Another period song is playing on the phonograph
Just remember: don't mention the communists
Calvin's a great guy, but he's a little, you know
Nutty
What's his wife like
Oh, you know, housewife
Likes to cook
Pregnant
Normal, then
Well,  wouldn't go that far
(then) Helen
Helen has entered from the kitchen with more food
She favors June Allison
Hi, Betty
Dave
Just look at you
Any day now
This is my sister and her husband
Oh, hi
Welcome
Calvin is using a cocktail shaker to very carefully make Rob Roys for the crowd at the bar
It's like watching a chemist at work
Calvin's a pipe-smoker
So anyhow this duck says to the clerk, "'d like to buy this lip balm
"  And the clerk says, "Will that be cash or a check
"  And the duck says, "Just put it on my bill
" Polite laughter follows, but the guy out of Calvin's sight-line rolls his eyes
- with drinks
Helen is in the b
g
, rushing around, over- serving everyone
He was the golden-boy professor at Cal Tech
But then he starts inventing things
What kind of things
You got me
Some kind of special synthetic rubber
And some kind of automated machine
Anyhow, suddenly he gets rich
mean rich
And quits teaching
- as his guests sample their Rob Roys
How's that
Just what the doctor ordered
Calvin gives the man his patented thumbs-up sign
- over by the patio doors
We can see Calvin's shop through the window
With all his money they could have moved to Beverly Hills, but they decided to stay in the Valley
Calvin spends all his time tinkering out there in his workshop
If you ask me it's all very strange
#1 (chiming in) He dug a huge hole out there for a swimming pool
Then he decided he didn't want it and filled the thing in
And what's that big, high fence for
The women look at Calvin
- with guests (one is called Harold) at the bar
There currently exists a type of neon light that lasts five years
But you won't see it on the market
Same is true of batteries
could take your simple yacht battery and rig it to last a decade, easily
Well, what the heck kind of a marketing system can't get great new products like that out to the public
(intense) veeeery good one, Harold
Free market capitalism may not be a perfect order, but it's the best we've got, or will ever have
And why
Three reasons
Poor Harold
- Most of the guests are women, gabbing and helping Helen out as she removes a pot roast from the oven and busily jumps around the kitchen
#2 Say, Helen
What does Calvin think about this trouble down in Cuba
(rolling her eyes) Oh, please don't bring that up
- , late guest named  hurries up the walkway and into the house
8 - Calvin is with another guest
'd say my baseball card collection is as complete as any one 've ever seen
Ron pushes his way through the crowd
Calvin
Hey, Calvin
(pointing over his shoulder) Kennedy's going toe-to-toe with Khrushchev on the television
Calvin immediately heads for the family room
Others follow
- Everyone is huddled around the   press conference
There seems to be a lot of smokers
Helen appears shortly, wearing a hot pad mitten on each hand
this sudden, clandestine decision to station strategic weapons for the first time outside of Soviet soil, is a deliberately provocative and unjustified change in the status quo which cannot be accepted by this country
Calvin cuts a knowing look at Helen who dutifully returns it
- The plane swoops over the Valley and we see the spectacular lights of
sprawl
There is a coming from the jet's engine
The plane is shaking terribly and the pilot is having a very hard time controlling it
Wolf One -- say intentions
've got secondaries of an engine fire and 'll need to find a clear area to eject
Roger, Wolf One
Can you make it to the ocean
The trembling plane circles to the west
Return to
we will not prematurely or unnecessarily risk the cost of worldwide nuclear war, in which even the fruits of victory would be ashes in our mouth
But neither will we shrink from the risk at any time it must be faced
- /
, To Helen's embarrassment, Calvin is ushering  all the guests to the front door
Helen is passing out hats and purses
She and Calvin speak simultaneously - somewhere in the middle we cut outside
'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events,  think it's prudent that we cut the evening short
'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime
'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance
We'll do this again
Maybe next week
Here's your hat
Could  wrap something up for you
Did you have a coat
Helen can barely get a "good night" out before Calvin shuts the door
- Following their wives out
(sotto to Bob) What'd  tell ya
Bob whistles softly
Calvin's a nut all right
Calvin turns to Helen, a grave expression on his face
It's time
(misinterpreting, holding her stomach) Time
Oh, no Calvin
It's not time yet
still have-- He points down
(cont'd) Oh, that time
You know Calvin, 'm not sure 'm really ready for this
On the contrary,  think we're the only ones who are
He leads her out of shot
() Calvin 'm sure everything's going to be all right
just know it is
- Calvin and Helen leave the house; cross the patio; and hurry to the shop
Back in the house, the record player has been left on:  "How Much Is That Doggie In The Window
"  Helen is carrying the pot roast which is wrapped in foil
Well, 'm certainly not going to let the pot roast go to waste
Could you just put that seat cover back on that lawn chair
He does
(cont'd) Shouldn't we at least turn off the phonograph
It shuts off automatically
Did you rig it to do that
You're so clever
No
They all do
never know anymore
The      makes a low pass over Calvin's house
Calvin sticks his head out the door and looks up
bet that's a fighter jet on his way to Key West
Good luck, amigo
They enter
The place is full of tools and gadgets-- mostly construction equipment
The ham radio is still on
An emergency has been declared repeat, an emergency has been declared
Calvin and Helen speak over the Tower who is telling other aircraft in the vicinity to clear the area
You hear that
Yes
Calvin unplugs the radio and quickly wraps the cord
We can listen to the rest downstairs
He pushes aside a table that is hiding a hatch in the floor and unlocks it by turning the hatch's wheel
Then he opens the hatch and reaches inside to turn on a light
Red submarine light shines up from below
All the while he and Helen are chatting: Calvin,  wish you would have at least let me do the dishes
It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates
just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning
Cheese is particularly troublesome
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip
Oh, much worse
But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip
You remember that
Yeah, yeah
Okay
Give me the roast and watch your step
'll come back for the radio
She steps into the hatch and onto a ladder
- The young pilot is bouncing around the now smokey cockpit
Tower, say again
The   is airborne with you in sight
'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting
Roger, Wolf One
The pilot rights the plane; points the joy stick; and reaches for the ejection handles between his legs
The pilot ejects
This is the pilot's  (were there a pilot
)  We see the coastline and we notice that the plane is making a
- turn, away from the water and back towards the Valley
Streaking back to the Valley with a dramatic tail of sparks
He notices that his plane is headed directly at him
It misses him by a matter of yards
- Taking the liberty of a  , we follow them down the ladder which is inside a corrugated metal tube
On either side of the tube we see layers of dirt
How long will we have to stay down here
don't know
For this thing to blow over, it could take days
Days
Rather safe than sorry
That's my motto
But, what if  go into labor
That could happen any time
've read up on it
'll deliver the baby myself if  have to
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers
(chuckling) Yes, dear
As long as we've got that straight
- It    and   at a 90 degree angle to the ground
until it  and the Then, after a Road Runner-like beat or two, it begins to     , tail first
- The Webbers step off a metal ladder and face a vault-like chrome hatchway
Calvin opens the six-inch thick door by pushing another switch on his small box
Helen takes the roast
- With only the sound of wind, the jet continues to fall as the lights of the Valley rush up to meet it
- They step into a darkened room
(with arms spread) Home sweet home
To you maybe
Calvin flicks a wall switch and we The echoes of the sounds suggest a large, cavernous space
All we can see is the cinder block wall behind them and the hatch door, which Calvin begins to shut by putting his body into it
Just then there is a which knocks them to the floor
(Note: Helen hangs on to the roast, trying her best not to drop it
) The ,  , , Calvin struggles to his feet and gets the vault door shut just in the nick of time
What was that
Are you all right
Hanging on to the roast she nods vigorously, trying to be brave
Yes,  think so
Calvin hurries to a bright    on the wall
Next to the box is a     that's labeled "Radiation Count
"  There are   that are dropping to zero
Oh, no
It's happened
Look at that heat
All my surface indicators are knocked out
Oh, my Lord
it's actually happened
- The box has a dial on it, next to which is a large lever
foreboding sign reads    , Calvin pulls the lever
The chrome and steel with great noise, precision and
finality
There is the doing the same thing
What's that noise
The locks
The locks
To keep us from trying to leave
After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years
Thirty -five years
Then after that it's safe
It's safe
She continues to stare at him
To go up
To go up
She continues to stare at him
(confidently) Hey, honey
Don't you worry
We're going to be just fine
Helen bursts into tears
- Two police detectives,  and , exit the house
Uniformed workers carefully carry small pieces of the jet from the crash site
The detectives lead us to what's left of Calvin's shop
It's mostly a charred crater
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase
Well, he and Mrs
Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess
What about relatives
All back East
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here
She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr
Pepper
He drank it hot
Yeah
Good god
Yeah
-   (12   ) Helen awakes alone and still dressed
She sits up and trys the phone on the night table
It is dead
She hangs up and exits
/ / Calvin is making sandwiches from the pot roast
Two empty Doctor Pepper bottles sit next to the stove where Calvin is heating the soda
He sees Helen enter the livingroom
Hi, honey
Feeling better
No
We have to be strong, sweetheart
If not for ourselves, for the child
All our friends
He enters with her sandwich and a cup of Dr
Pepper
Burnt to a crisp
(indicating sandwiches) 've given you the most well-done cut
'm not hungry
Hot Dr
Pepper
Your favorite
(leaving) No, Calvin, you're favorite
Really
She walks out onto the patio
She rubs her arms as if cold
bit chilly
Shouldn't be
Temperature's a nice 73 degrees
He follows her out to the patio
Maybe 've just got the creeps
How could you
This is just like home
reverse angle shows for the first time the rest of the fallout shelter -- which looks very different from "home"
Perhaps she starts to cry again
No
No
Calvin, this is different
Believe me
Would you like a tranquilizer
You have tranquilizers
told you
've got everything
Helen groans in pain
Oh, no
What
Uh, oh
Now it's time
Honey
29B 29C 29D 29E - We can only hear Adam's entrance into the world
There is Helen's pain, followed by Adam's cry, followed by Calvin's rejoicing
() The first child to be born on earth after the annihilation
- : Start on the record player in the living room
The country and western classic "Hey, Good Looking" is spinning
30 ,   - Calvin walks through checking things over; pleased by what he sees
He exits
("Hey Good Looking" continues
) ,   - Calvin checks the switch he uses to control the lights
Then he checks out all the tiny fish swimming in the six feet by six feet tank
When he hears a baby's cry he hurries away
(Music continues) , Calvin enters and smiles with great affection at his family:  Helen and a   cradled next to her in bed
Is there a problem
No, Calvin
Babies cry
've noticed
What shall we call him
Calvin shrugs
(cont'd) Well,  was thinking
in light of the situation
that we should call him Adam
That's not sacrilegious is it
No
think it's just right
And  was wondering
if
if  could have a
Yes
If

What
Whatever you want, Helen
She points upwards

They both look up

Right here

What are you doing back here
Oh,  was just examining this rear hatchway
Why
No reason
(then, off her look) Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off
So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance
Which is very nice because it has the service elevator
Very nice
Unless it caved in, too
Yes
Well
yes
sober beat, then: (cont'd) You wanted to see me
Helen nods vigorously
Watch this
What
She sets Adam (one year old) down on his wobbly little legs, steadying him at the shoulders
Go to Daddy, Adam
Go to Daddy
And Adam takes his first step
And then another
And another
It's a joyous event

Well, don't fool with it
If it is a septic tank,  sure as hell don't want to open it
We'll just lay the foundation over it
#1 Okay
,  (  ) - , Realtor steps out with   looking to buy the house
and since it's almost certain that the Webbers were killed, the bank is selling the house and that back parcel over there that's been re-zoned commercial
It's right there on the avenue
Is that where the plane crashed
She points out to a   where the shop used to be
We can see the Malt Shop construction crew beyond that
Yep, right there
This place gives me the willies
Yeah,  know what you mean
But the price is right
- , The guy driving the heavy front loader lets the bucket slam to the ground hard
- Calvin vaguely hears the noise made by the front loader
,   -  (1965-66) : 1965 Calvin smokes his pipe and enjoys a Manhattan cocktail as Adam (three and a half) sits in his lap reading the title page from Alice in Wonderland
Al ice in won der lan
Calvin smiles pridefully over at Helen who works intensely on the couch making a coffee-can Santa from instructions in the The Redbook Crafts Collection
Not bad for a three and a half year old
'd like to see the public school system match that
don't care how terrific it is
Yes, he's very bright, dear
Much like his father
But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little
young for school
Nonsense
People have no idea what the human mind is capable of
Look at us
Helen ponders that statement
(pointing to the book's art work) Look, Daddy
Alice went down a hole, just like us
Calvin smiles and messes up Adam's hair
(cont'd) Will  ever get to go up on top
Yes, you certainly will
And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America
Just the way it used to be
Oh, Calvin, 'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept
believe there will be other survivors
In fact, 'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now
It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there
And  don't just mean the cockroaches
They both look nervously up at the ceiling
'   ( ) -  (1965-66) on the busy avenue
'   - are being served their favorite ice- cream and malt treats by  herself and a young Appropriate music comes from the jukebox
'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke
You bet, Mom
Coming up
Two      enter
Everyone looks at them in amazement
(Perhaps there is also a record change here
) ,  -  (65-66) Calvin is building and furnishing a classroom from materials available to him
He has had the forethought to bring down the books needed for his child's education
Little Adam is watching him
(to Adam) Nothing in the world is more fun than learning new things
- The family watches the same "Honeymooner" clip they watched before
Calvin still finds it funny
Helen wonders about that
- Helen is pouring cooking sherry into an empty Listerine bottle
-  (1970-71) : 1970 Other buildings have been constructed around the malt shop
Foot and car traffic are heavier
- The clean-cut kids have been replaced by
Mom hasn't put a lot back into the decor, but she has made concessions to the fashions of the time
The jukebox plays something appropriate
Mom and the Jerk are five years older
can't tell the boys from the girls anymore
(stoned) Uh
yeah
It's like hard
Mom gives the Jerk a suspicious look
-  (1970-71) Calvin (40) is giving Adam (8) a boxing lesson
They work from a "How To" book and use gloves made from living room pillows
Adam's pretty good
Helen appears and watches with pride
Then she interupts
Boys
Excuse me, but  believe it's my turn
(holding out her hand) Adam
He goes to her
- The hydroponic garden area is empty
Perry Como song begins and Adam and Helen enter waltzing
Adam has changed shirts and combed his hair
Somewhere, Calvin is watching with pride
After a while Calvin cuts in
He and Helen dance beautifully
Then they kiss
Somewhere, Adam is watching with pride
-  (1975-76) : 1975 The place continues its decline
Acid rock plays loudly
Mom and the Jerk serve the smallish crowd
miss those nice flower-power kids
How 'bout you
(after studying her for some time) Um
uh
The acid rock song ends and an early, bad disco hit comes on the jukebox
What the hell kind of music is that
The Jerk puts his hands to his ears, he so hates the new music
Oh, man
'm like not sure  like that
,   (1975-76) The room looks like Ricky Nelson's class
There are twin pictures of Ike and  on the wall
Adam is eleven
This is what money looks like
It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper
Or you can have an "investment
"  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name
Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable
They're pretty
Can  have them
Sure
Now, let's move on to our French exam
Latin exam, Dad
It's Tuesday
You're right
It's Tuesday already

(marveling) You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son
must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree
By the way, it's time  gave you something
Come with me
Adam follows his dad out
- They pass Helen who is absentmindedly poking at the puck with a stick
She's not having a very good day
She wears her hair dryer but it's not plugged in
Hi, honey
Hi
- Calvin hands Adam a cigar box
Adam opens it to see Calvin's remarkable baseball card collection
These are wonderful
It's my entire baseball collection
It's yours now
What's baseball
It's a game, son
can explain it pretty easily
There's a pitcher
Like a painting
(chuckling) No, son
pitcher
Like one of Mom's
Uh, no
There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat
The nocturnal flying mammal
(slightly pissed) No
Sit down
They do
- Start close on flashing roller skates
Then cut wider to show Adam roller skating
He passes Helen who has fallen asleep knitting in one of the lawn chairs
Then Adam passes Calvin who is on a ladder soldering a leaking ceiling pipe
-  (1991) : 1991 with spiked green hair enter to the strains of "My Sharona
" -  (1991) Mom watches the punks enter
Then crosses to the Soda Jerk who now has a tattoo on his forehead
'm selling this place

Yeah
Yeah, that's it
'll give it to ya, no money down
The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway
She walks off
Cool
(1995) : 1995 Helen has prepared a birthday cake
Having no birthday candles, she's used three votive candles
We can hear Calvin and Adam talking in the dining room
(She and Calvin are now in their 60's
) () No, no
The runner on second goes to third
He's out there
() Why
() Because he's forced out at third
It's a force
() Then why go there
() Because he must
Calvin
() Coming
Calvin enters
(cont'd) Yes, dear
Get the presents and do the lights
You bet
Calvin leaves while Helen lights the candles
The whole shelter goes dark
Calvin returns with two presents wrapped in whatever is available
- Helen and Calvin enter singing Happy Birthday
We see the for the first time in silhouette
His handsome face is revealed to us when the cake is placed before him
Thank you, Mom
Thanks, Dad
Blow out the candles
Make a wish
He does both
His parents clap
Helen takes one of the presents from Calvin and gives it to Adam
He unwraps it
It's a green coat
Oh, boy
jacket
Your mom made that all by herself
No kidding
No kidding
(aside, to Calvin) Who else would have done it
And  made these
He gives Adam the second present
Adam tears off the paper to find a pair of roller-skates that Calvin has redesigned
The new skates look kind of like rollerblades
Holy Cow
What the heck are these
Your roller-skates
redesigned them
think this new design will work even better
These are really swell
mean swell
What did you wish for, Adam
If he tells, it won't come true
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney
We never believed that in my family
Well, we did in my family
wished  could meet a girl
His parents don't have a reply for that
Oh
nice one,  hope
Yes, ma'am
One who doesn't glow in the dark
Calvin Webber
What a thing to say
Well, we'll be going up in two years
We'll know then
'm very hopeful
(ardently) Me, too
His parents stare at him for a beat, then: Let's eat our cake
Yeah
Let's dig in
They do
Elbows, Son
Sorry, Mom
You never know
You may someday dine at the White House with the president
If we still have one
Yes
You know, when we do go up
'm going to miss this old place
How 'bout you, hon
(after a beat) Would you excuse me
Sure
Helen rises and exits
48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 - , Helen enters and goes into the generator room
Through the glass we can see (and hear) her scream
Straightening her hair and feeling much better, she exits as Calvin strolls by wearing his tool belt
She's headed out
In the generator room again
Oh, yes
It just fascinates me how all    these things work
know exactly what you mean
(then) Hey, honey
She turns to him
He gives her his patented thumbs up sign
(cont'd) Great cake
She smiles wanely and leaves
He shuts the generator door she left open
60 61 ,   - : The room is quiet and empty
The star-burst on the paneling says 6:15
,  - Also empty
- Also empty
And with   on the shelves
- The old pipes are rusted and patched
Some are leaking badly
- Calvin wakes up
He looks over at Helen's bed
- She wakes up
Then jumps out of bed
67 that has been ticking on the wall for thirty-five years
Suddenly it   and a rather annoying Calvin's hand reaches up and turns it off by throwing the lever up
shows us the mechanism on the switch to  with a loud, vault-like move
reveals the family in their pajamas standing in front of the front hatchway and red box
So
we just open this door and go up
Calvin grabs a handle and using all his strength, opens the front entrance hatch
And then must jump back when nothing but earth and rock pour into the room
Um
is that supposed to happen
His parents take a beat then race off like maniacs through the entire shelter to the back hatch door
They knock over whatever gets in their way as they go
Adam follows
Hey, where are we going
Is everything all right
- Calvin and Helen arrive followed by Adam who can't possibly share his parent's deep concerns
Everyone is out of breath
Should we say a little prayer first
Just open the door
Calvin attempts to open the big hatch, but can't
Adam helps him
Helen pitches in
Slowly, with lots of squeaking, the
He steps through the hatch and flips a wall switch
Red submarine
And the service elevator is intact
- Helen steps through and embraces Calvin joyfully
The old folks break into a dance as Adam enters
Well, do we just go on up
(quickly back to business, and way too dramatic) No, son
We wait for night
Now
is precisely when
we must be at our
most cautious
(barely a whisper, but definitely tired of his ) Oh, shit
Helen's eyes widen and her hand flies up to her mouth
She is just as shocked as Calvin
Helen-Thomas-Webber
Maybe we have been down here a little too long
(to Adam) Please excuse her French
Shit is a French word
Yes, yes it is
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning
"good"
Yes
That's right
Oh
(then) Well
then
shit
There is a pause, then: 'est bon, Monsieur
Merci

Until finally the of the back entrance    with an eerie, struggling whine and Then up comes    followed by Calvin in his    with Geiger counter ticking
Oh, God
Oh, God
Oh,God, save me
For  have seen the light
Calvin raises his hand and yells through his mask
come in peace
The Soda Jerk
Calvin, sounding like a deep sea diver and having to walk like Frankenstein, goes over to the Soda Jerk and studies his face in the light of his flashlight
He is horrified by what he sees
My, gosh
Calvin looks around the room and heads for the back
He moves his Geiger counter around and gets a quiet (safe) reading
Then he removes a   from a plastic container and strikes it against the wall
The , so Calvin takes off his hood and visor and breathes the air
It stinks in there
-  , Calvin (out of the head gear and top of the suit) slowly pushes the door open and steps out
He's surprised to find an empty   behind the Malt Shop, where the avocado trees should be
Where is my backyard
He points his flashlight around and heads for the to his left
-   , left over from the Body Shop sit against a fence
Calvin marvels at the cars, even in their present condition
In a   he studies the chrome- plated word "Toyota
"      arrives to search through the garbage
Calvin hurries back towards the avenue
76 -   , Calvin emerges from the alley that separates the Malt Shop from another storefront (perhaps now a rundown Thai restaurant
) watching the cars fly by on the wet avenue
Suddenly, a cross-dressing   steps up to him with a cigarette
You got a light, honey
What
light
Yes, 've got a light
Good
Fumbling, he finally gets her little cigar lighted with one of his kitchen matches
So
you
survived the blast, did you
The blast
Honey,  have survived a host of things
Like the song says: " country boy can survive
" Yes, yes, the song
So tell me
has it been
hell up here
"Hell up here
"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder
Hell everywhere
Yes,  can tell that just looking around
(then) "Boy
"  Did you say you were a "country boy
" Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy,  can be a boy
And if you want a girl,  can be a girl
can be anything you want me to be
Really
Uh-huh
And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200
And if you act now,  might even throw in some free lawn furniture
(stumbling away from her) No,  can't
'm sorry
have to go
have to
He breaks into a trot, heading up the street past a seedy (used to be the convenience store) just as a hopelessly   of a woman is shoved out and told to stay out
Calvin watches as the woman stumbles to the curb where she  her cookies full of     , one of whom and, just for fun, points it at Calvin
When Calvin sees the pistol he ducks into the The young gang member pulls the trigger and we (not Calvin) see that the realistic-looking pistol is really a water gun
Calvin races in and, gathering himself, addresses the behind the counter
Hello
How are you this evening
Mind if , you know, browse around
The clerk just watches him
Thank- very much
Then Calvin turns and has his first look at the material
and he    and  and back   a whole
,  - Calvin sits at the breakfast table, still breathing hard and holding his chest
His family looks on with great concern
The anti-radiation suit and gear is piled in the corner
'm going to give it to you straight
There's no point in beating around the bush
There were survivors
Apparently, the fallout has created
a subspecies of mutants
Mutants
It's not a pretty sight
Some eat out of garbage cans
Others are
cover your ears, Son, and hum
mean that literally and  mean right now
covers his ears and hums
Others are
multi-sexual
It seems
they can be both masculine and feminine
simultaneously
No
Yes
don't believe it
Helen copes by moving around the kitchen doing things that don't need to be done
Believe it
He tried to sell me his body, Helen
(beat) They offer lawn furniture as a come on
She slumps, then resumes her needless activity
Calvin takes Adam's arm and the son drops his hands and stops humming
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed
People throw up in the streets
Others point guns
There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and
and
can't tell you the rest
just can't
Oh my
Oh,my, oh my, oh, my
So, what do we do now
We stay down here
We do
Yes
Excuse me
She hurries into the living room
- Helen let's out a silent scream, then hurries back into the kitchen
- For how long
We've just about run out of everything
We'll make do
'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then-- (rising) No, Calvin
We're not going to make do
Not me
Not Adam
We're going up no matter what
We deserve it
Even if it's terrible
Well,  am the head of this household-- want him to at least see the sky
--and we will-- And the ocean
mountain range
--do as  say
Breathing heavily, Calvin suddenly clutches at his chest in great pain and collapses
Dad
Oh, no
Oh, my goodness
Let's get him into the bedroom
- Adam paces
Then Helen comes out
Behind her, we can see Calvin sleeping in his bed
She heads for the living room
He follows
He seems to be doing all right now don't know if he's had a heart attack or just
a horrifying experience
But we  need supplies and 've got to stay with him
'll go up
They go through the living room and cross to the patio
'm afraid you've got to
'll be all right
(patting his cheek) You're my brave boy
Helen hands him a pencil and pad
Adam follows her to the fish farm
Just act normal
If anybody asks, simply say you're from out-of-town, and that you're in town on business
Write that down
He does
(cont'd) 'm going to give you a shopping list and some money
We need just enough things to get us through the next year or two
And you'll find most of these items at what used to be called a grocery store or a hardware store
Write that down
Yes, ma'am
At the fish tank, Helen pulls up a slim chain that is attached to a water-tight aluminum box which she quickly opens
The box contains $6,000 in wrapped one hundred dollar bills
Helen takes half of it
don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall,  want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn
Write that down
It's a hotel
There might still be one standing
Yes, ma'am
Let's get you packed
She heads back for the house
He follows
Right
(indicating money) just hope this is still good up there
Mom
Yes
was thinking that, uh
you know, while  was up there and all
that maybe  could, you know
try to meet a girl
've, been thinking about that a little
just these last
fifteen years or so
They have stopped by the garden
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl
One who's not a mutant
and hopefully comes from Pasadena
Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena,  don't know
always just seemed a little nicer
Yes, ma'am
They hug
Oh, there's also a thing called a liquor store
Write that down
'  - He is packing
He looks at his cigar box and opens it
He studies the contents: The Cards, stock certificates, and an old photo of his parents
He decides to pack the box
Helen enters with a long shopping list
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything
Yes, ma'am
Your father has a few final words for you
You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much
We both do
Heck,  know that mom
You're my parents
- Adam sets down his suitcase and goes to his father's bed
He sits
At the door, Helen dries her eyes with her apron
Calvin indicates that he wants to whisper to Adam, who drops his ear close to his father's lips
Adam
don't forget
don't forget
Yes, father
Yes
the pipe tobacco
Yes, sir
Is that all
Calvin nods
Adam rises and starts for the door
But Calvin remembers something and beckons him back to speak weakly into his son's ear
Also
stay out of the "Adult Bookstore
" Adult Bookstore
Why
Poison gas
Invisible
Don't forget
promise
Is that all
One more thing
If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you
'll try
And then Calvin closes his eyes and sleeps
- The Soda Jerk has turned the rear exit into a religious shrine
He's put flowers and candles and costume jewelry and religious icons (from all the Majors) on top of and around the broken cement
Currently he's on his knees, rocking back and forth as he prays
And,lo
There came a rumbling even as from the very bowels of the earth and a great light showed forth followed by gates of armor which opened and shut and delivered up the vision of a young man whose countenance caused the Soda Jerk to be struck dumb and to fall on his face and to weep in fear
And, Adam, taking pity on the man, put down his suitcase, and went to him, saying: Are you all right
Yes
Yes
Oh, Lord
Yes, oh, yes
But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow
All in yellow
Oh
That was my father
Ooooohhhh
Of course
The father
Forgive me
Can you forgive me for my wasted life
Everything has been so awful
(comforting him) know it has been terrible
But it wasn't your fault
And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better
You understand
Yes
've got to go, now
Of course you do
'll stay here and pray
(picking up his suitcase) That's always a good idea
Would you like some money
have a great deal of it
No
don't need money anymore -- see that now
How do  leave here
The front door is open
Will you be back
promise
Adam turns and leaves
The Soda Jerk falls to his knees and shakes all over
- Adam steps out onto the sidewalk and sunlight falls on him much brighter than anything he has ever seen
He looks at it on the arm of his coat and then, slowly, he looks up at the sky
- And now it is Adam who is dumbstruck
#1 appears and sees Adam looking up
#1 What
What is it
The sky
#1 The sky
Where
(pointing) Up there
#1 don't see anything
Just look
Adam becomes momentarily interested in a parking meter
and her  approach from the other direction
What is it
#1 (pointing) He sees something
What
see it, mommy
#2 Where
Several more people are drawn over
goes by in the foreground with passengers who are looking up
What is it
have never in my life seen anything like this
Nothing even comes close
Adam continues down the sidewalk,looking up passes by
Whatcha looking at
Oh, my holy stars
Negro
(with attitude) Say what
(offering his hand) How do you do, ma'am
(leary, but taking his hand) do alright
Good
The Pakistani exits the Adult Bookstore
What is it
What do you see
When Adam looks down to answer the man he sees the "Adult Bookstore" sign
Oh, no
What
Poisonous gas
Run for your life, it's invisible poisonous gas
And everyone does run away, including Adam
The avenue is left totally deserted
- Helen sits sipping tea, deep in thoughts of concern for Adam
Behind her Calvin appears in the open window
You know-- Helen is so startled she knocks the tea all over the place
(cont'd) just wanted to say that  think he's going to be just fine
(holding her heart) Thank you, Calvin
Thank you very much
Calvin leaves, then comes back
He's smart
Yes, dear,  know
85A - , An
bus comes directly at
- is startled
He reacts
- ' slamming down the brake pedal
- in profile
The braking bus stops an inch from his nose
Adam smiles
(Have him head for bus door in this angle
) - from over Adam
He is in shock
- Start on a     on Adam's  of bus passengers as he heads for a seat
The passengers look at him in amazement and some fear
- going to his seat; smiling at the passengers
(He is carrying a $100 bill
) Hello
Hi
Good afternoon
Howdy
Adam finds a seat next to a heavily perspiring young Adam shows the Psycho the $100 bill
tried to give the driver this but he wouldn't take it
He seems angry lot of people do
The bus pulls out
It gets up to about twenty miles an hour
(cont'd) Oh, boy
Here we go
We're moving
Wow
: looking back at Adam with concern
(') So this is public transportation
My Dad says that it becomes more and more important because of pollution -- which is more and more carbon dioxide and other hazardous gases in the air
(then, confidentially) Do you have a gun, by the way
The increasingly nervous Psycho looks around, then nods that he does
(cont'd) Well, thanks for not waving it around
And for not vomitting, for that matter
Wow, we're really flying
Say, do you know where  could find a grocery store
The psycho shakes his head
(cont'd) have to find that
And a hardware store  and a liquour store and a standing Holiday Inn
Although,  may not need the Holiday Inn
That's still kind of up in the air
It depends really on how things go
(pointing) There's a grocery store coming up
Thank-
(jumping up) Driver
Please stop the bus immediately
have to get off
(then an aside to the psycho) Do you think  should get a gun
don't know
maybe
(back to driver) Driver
Please stop, sir
- He's not going to stop until he wants to stop
-
who are anxious for Adam to leave
For the love of God
Let him off the bus
Can't you see he's meshugina
Adam leans in close to the
'm sorry, what did you call me
The man and his wife take that the wrong way and start to scream
-  ' hitting the brakes
- stopping suddenly
Through the windows we see Adam go down
- The back door opens as Adam gets up
Thank you, driver
Good-bye, everyone
Adam exits the bus
Everyone, including the Psycho, heaves a huge sign of relief
- Adam enters and (after getting over the automatic doors and the check-out technology) is overwhelmed by the magnificence of the postmodern California supermarket
The check-out counters alone are amazing
Seeing others do it, he takes a cart, placing his suitcase in it
Adam passes the baked goods, paying particular attention to the elaborate birthday cakes
Is that a birthday cake
Yes, it is
Gee-ma-nee
Adam leaves
The clerk turns to a fellow worker
Bakersfield
Adam marvels at the abundance and variety
He passes a mother whose child is riding in the cart and that reminds him of his own mom -- when she used to let him ride that way
Then he is surprised to see a -  so casually dressed in public
She (overweight) is in an unfortunate terrycloth halter-shorts combination
He (hirsute) is in a sleeveless undershirt and baggy bathing trunks
(to himself) My first mutants
Adam picks up one of those huge California cucumbers that always amaze Easterners
He shows it to the - Is this because of the radiation
What
Nothing
Adam is looking at the live lobsters as a  steps up
Help you
Yes, please
(consulting his Mom's list) 'm looking for all beef patties
Fresh or frozen
Adam chuckles because he thinks the man is kidding
Come on
Frozen
How much are they
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box
Then 'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes
And that's almost
five hundred dollars just for the hamburger
And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything
The yacht batteries
The diesel oil
The birthday candles
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home
Really
Sure
Well, that's great then
Terrific
except
it just occurred to me
don't know where  live
'm lost
don't know where home is
(then) Would you excuse me
Gladly
Adam hurries away
93 94 of Adam on another bus
He looks frantically out the window
We see his  of shops and stores and people
At one point he sees two women joggers which he wonders about
Then he sees two men arguing violently
Gradually late day turns to night and Adam becomes more and more depressed
Then he sees something
He is elated
He jumps up and tells the driver: Driver
Stop this bus immediately
Please sir
-   - The bus stops mid-block and Adam gets off
He crosses the street causing only one car to hit the brakes
On the other side of the avenue we see what has gotten his attention
It's an   much like the last one we saw (probably owned by the same chain
) He's happy but when he looks next door he sees he's in a different place
Sad and lost he turns north and starts to walk until -- a billboard catches his attention
We pan up to see a billboard for liposuction that features an almost Adam is struck by the image and we spend some time cutting between him and it
Then gathering himself he turns and begins to walk south
of him as he passes a    and wonders about that
Then he sees something that blows his mind
of a   passing by
Adam reacts
Oh my
Oh, my goodness gracious
Oh, my
Oh
That is so great
Man alive
- sign says:   &   ,  & - Adam enters with his suitcase in one hand and his cigar box in the other
He steps up to the counter where the owner () sits reading the newspaper
He has a fondness for Navajo jewelry
Hello
(gives him a look, then goes back to reading) Hi
enters from the back of the store and goes to another counter
Neither man notices
The name is Adam Webber and  see you buy baseball cards and although these are a lot older than the ones in the window,  was hoping you still might be interested
He flips open the cigar box to reveal to Jerry riches beyond his wildest dreams
Jerry actually moans and then must pretend the moan was a cough
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season
was thinking of selling all the cards
Really
No kidding
He reaches in and looks through the cards
See, my problem is, all  have are hundred dollar bills and  need something smaller
Ones, fives, tens
Like that
see what ya mean
Tell you what
'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box
Oh, that would be wonderful
Well, we're here to help
woman steps into the shot
She has come from the back of the store and her back is momentarily to us
() Oh, shit
Adam turns to her and is immediately awe struck
We reveal
She tosses her lipstick into her purse
Eve works in the card shop and is on her way out
'm workin' here, Evey-poo
Don't screw me up
Bon soir, mademoiselle
Are you French
No
(then, thinking fast) 'm from out of town
(then sensing the need for further clarification) 'm here on business
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here-- (holds up a card) --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self
Get out of here
No, you get out of here
She closes his cigar box and gives it to him
Terrific
you're fired
You know that
No, ferry--excuse me, Jerry,  quit
She walks back to the counter to get her coat
Oh, no
fired ya
Just like the hair salon guy and the Chevy dealer
You know why you can't keep a goddamn job
Because you can't keep your goddamn mouth shut
That's why
Jerry is surprised when Adam suddenly takes his arm firmly
Sir
would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again
(looking at Adam's hand) Oh, you got a problem with that
have a big problem with that
Eve sees a fist fight coming
She takes Adam by the arm
Come on, Heathcliff, 'll walk you to the corner
Yes, ma'am
But my name is Adam
Just come on
They head for the door and exit
Hah
Adam and Eve
The perfect match
hope you two will be very happy together
Mazel-fuckin'-tov
Don't try coming back, Ms
Big Shot
'm serious this time
You're finished in the hobby business
Take that to the bank, why don'tcha
Adam re-enters
didn't want to leave without saying how much  admire your jewelry
Hey, smart ass, how 'bout  kick your butt
Adam walks towards the man smiling
How 'bout you what
Jerry takes a nervous step backwards, but Eve steps back in and pulls Adam out
said come on
Adam exits
Jerry doesn't know what to say
- They exit the store
Where are we going
We
'm going home
And, judging by that coat, 'd say you have to get back to the barber college
No, 'm lost
You're lost
Say,
did you just lose your job because of me
Forget it
'm sick of working for that dickhead
Dickhead
walking penis capable of intelligent speech
dickhead
mental picture of that causes Adam to slump against a store window and drop his box of cards
What's wrong with you
just had a mental picture of
Here, pick these up
Together they pick up the cards
(cont'd) Where are you parked
came on a bus
Why doesn't that surprise me
don't know
Why doesn't it
They rise
Well,  guess because 'm a little psychic
have this thing
Oh, that's nice
Let me guess something
This is your first visit to La La Land
You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay
Right so far
(could be a question, could be an answer
) So far
Yes, 'm right
Right
knew it
So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue
Which brings us to here
Correct again
Again
Where are you staying
The Holiday Inn
Yes
Yes
The Holiday Inn
That's exactly right
See
'm psychic
Not completely, but pretty much
That was pretty good, wasn't it
It was amazing
Yeah
Thanks
Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on
Do you own a car
'm not taking you there, Sweetie
Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car
If it will make you feel any better, don't have a gun
You don't
Nope
Well, that changes everything
Get the fuck away from me
mean it
She races around the corner
He goes after her
'm sorry
said something wrong, didn't
Please forgive me
Get away from me
She runs into a parking lot
He follows
Wait
Please wait
'll make a deal with you
'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel
Rogers Hornsby
He's all yours
was holding him back
Adam takes a Hornsby card from his coat pocket and shows it to her
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars
So what
've got two of him
(removing more cards from his pocket) And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons
was holding these out, too
She arrives at her car (dirty ) and anxiously unlocks the driver's door
So for four thousand dollars, all have to do is drive you to your hotel
Yes
And that's it
Yes
don't have to take a physical in your space ship
Heck, no
What
Okay
What the hell
You got a deal
Get in
She gets in
He gets in the back seat behind her
(cont'd) The front seat
He runs around to the front while Eve chats with herself
(cont'd) Why am  doing this
What in the hell is wrong with me
That's what 'd like to know
99 - Traffic is moving at fifteen miles an hour
The dash lights fascinate him but the car scares him
She notices that he is gripping the seat belt for dear life
So
Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway
It's Webber
Adam Webber
Mind if  change the station
Better traffic reports on
She switches over to  and runs by a Perry Como record, "Round and Round", looking for traffic
Wait
Wait
What is it
It's Perry
Perry
Perry Como
You had him
Go back
Go back
Okay, okay
Take it easy
She gets Perry
How's that
(star-struck) Oh,  could die
Over this
Yeah
Listen to this part
This is where it really takes off
You are one scary son-of-a-gun
Eve's car splits for the exit ramp
' The sudden speed scares Adam
Hey, what are you doing
know a short-cut
She comes off, catches the light and whips onto the surface street, tires squealing
Adam is hanging onto his seat belt
Eve puts the pedal to the metal
Gee-zooie
You better slow down
can't help it
Perry Como always does this to me
just get so cranked
She turns Perry way up
Eve does a dandy job of trading lanes and passing
The little Geo's engine screams
Adam's sort of getting into it
- The Geo flies up to a quick stop
Eve turns to Adam, who has had  Life Experience
Card, please
End of service
He hands over the card like someone in a post-sex stupor
That was
wonderful
've never felt anything like that in my life
Yeah, same here
Don't forget your suitcase
Right
He gets out with the suitcase, and after shutting the door leans down to speak to her
You know-- She tears off, leaving him there
- Adam addresses the clerk
Good evening
want to stay at this hotel
Fill this out please
And 'll need a card
card
Yes, sir
Of course
Adam gives him a baseball card
- ushers Adam in and sets down his bag
Bathroom's there, 's over there
Remote's on top
Room Service menu is on the table
Adam picks up the phone and listens
(') You dial nine to get out
(beat, then) Of what
(beat, then) The hotel
(beat, then he hangs up) see
Well, thank you very much
You've been very, very nice
He offers two dollars
(cont'd) was able to get some change downstairs and my father taught me that it's customary to tip in a situation such as this
Thank you
Your father is a smart guy
My father is a genius
No kiddin'
Well
good night
Good night
Sleep tight
Don't let the bedbugs bite
That's what my Mom always says
(choking up) who 'm really beginning to miss
'm sorry
It's my first night away from home
How old are you
Thirty-five
You don't look thirty-five
How old do  look
Twenty-five
Around there
guess living up here makes people look older
Up here on the fifteenth floor
(catching himself) Yes
Up here on the fifteenth floor
Goodnight
Goodnight
Adam abruptly shuts the door in the man's face
He goes to the window and looks out
The height scares him to death
He jumps back
,   - Adam's parents pray
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam
Amen
Amen
She begins to tear up and he pats her hand
- Adam sits by the window watching his first dawn
- It's another bright, smoggy day
And here comes Eve, marching from the parking garage to the hotel entrance
(skyward) What in the hell am  doing here
That's what 'd like to know
Somebody tell me that
- Eve is speaking to a
You don't have a last name
All  know is that his first name is Adam
No
Adam Webber
That's it
'  - He is seated on the bed, transfixed, watching a television commercial
The   loudly
Adam nearly jumps out of his skin
After he figures out where the ringing is coming from, he answers the phone
(into phone, after a long pause) Yes
At the house phone
(into phone) Hi
This is the woman from the baseball card store
Remember me
' Boy, is he glad to hear from her
Yes
Hello
Hi
Hot-diggity-dog
Thank you for calling me on the telephone
Eve holds the receiver away from her for a moment
Good grief
Hey listen, 'm in the lobby
(pause, then) On the first floor
Where the hell else would it be
,  - The doors open and Adam hurries out, looking for Eve, who he sees and goes directly to, smiling all the while like a rumpled idiot
am so glad to see you
thought 'd never see you again
Okay, down boy
(holds up the baseball card)  can't take this for driving you home
wish  could, but  can't
So here, take it back
could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable
Now take it
can't, it's yours
Take it
damn it
(with hand over his mouth) Okay
He takes the card
Why are you doing that
haven't brushed yet
Oh
Okay
Well, so long
Enjoy your visit
She heads for the front door
He goes after her
Wait, Eve, please
Wait
Please don't follow me
Don't do it
- They exit
knew this would happen
You're like a lost puppy
Can't you please just talk to me for one second
Okay
Damn
She stops, he stops
(') should have taken the money and run
That's what Troy told me to do
But do  listen
No
Put your hand down
He does
Troy
Is he your husband
Or a boyfriend
No
(eyes to heaven) Thank-
Oh, stop that
God
Listen,  know you like me
can tell
But you know what
lot of guys like me
Not me, exactly
It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair
Or some combination of the above
think it's the eyes
The eyes
Okay
An eye-man
Anyhow, it never works out
Okay
Not that you even need to know that
You look like crap, by the way
What have you been doing
Watching television in color
Hey, no kidding
In color
Cross my heart and hope to die
She looks at him for a beat or two, then abruptly turns away
See, ya
Why doesn't it never work out
What
Why does it never work out
You and
men
Why
Who the hell knows
He follows closely
She stops
(cont'd) Okay, if you promise to leave me alone, 'll tell you
Okay
It never works out because 'm into legs and butts and hair myself
That's why
So  wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than  am, if you can picture that
Now, if you'll excuse me,  have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is
Why not go to work for me
Doing what
Selling all my baseball cards
And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks
Food and supplies
Who for
Like starving people
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help
How long would you need me
Two weeks
What's the pay
What's fair
've got to make at least a thousand a week
He gives her his patented thumbs up sign which of course is exactly like his father's
You got it
Wait here while  change
Sure
He walks back to the hotel
(to herself) My career's finally taking off
,    - Heavy-duty   are being loaded into a -Haul truck
The store  steps up to Eve who is watching
Adam appears in the bg, thanking and being nice to the  loading the truck
He looks mighty stupid in another one of his Dad's old outfits
Why would someone need twenty yacht batteries
just work for the guy
And who does he work for
The
Naw
it's some sort of charity thing
guess for starving people with yachts
- Eve and Adam shop with two carts, both full of Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr
Pepper
They like Dr
Pepper
Who are these people
My Mom and Dad
Very funny, smart ass
Hey
Pipe tobacco
'm going to need all of this
This is swell
He goes over to a huge supply of Prince Albert
(to herself) Swell
Run, Eve
Run
- Eve and Adam watch as a man with a forklift puts a year's supply of toilet paper into the back of the rental truck
- crowd has gathered to watch Adam and Eve empty seven shopping carts full of non-perishable groceries
- 5 Eve goes to get into the truck
Adam hurries by her
Wait
Wait
What
He opens the door for her
She shakes her head and gets in
- She drives the truck to a stop
He keeps the beat to the song on the  radio
It's VolarE
Adam loves it
Eve hates it
They come to a stop and she snaps off the radio
Well, another day, another dollar
(then) Stop staring at me
Sorry
He gets out
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning
Hey, you know
was thinking
Night
She pulls away
Night
/
-- - Adam drags the last 50-pound bag of flour into a self- storage locker and pulls down the sliding door which he padlocks
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry
It's your life
And, by the way, it's a dandy
guess we'll need another locker
No problem
We'll just sell another baseball card
You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay
- -  but, 'd just be lost without you
Thank you
And, um
guess
guess you and , uh
Adam
Don't even think about it
Okay
'm sorry
know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if didn't say it
Okay
Okay
Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat
She hops in behind the wheel
He (hurt) is a little slower getting in his side
- , Traffic is moving about forty miles an hour
Their truck is in one of the middle lanes
- - Adam screws up his guts and turns to her
There's something else  would like you to help me with
Name it
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy
(laughing) Oh, 'm sure it will
Then forget it
No, no
'm sorry
What is it
This is for me
Think of me as your genie
Just ask
Well
Okay
would like you to help me find a
wife
wife
Yes
What for
Because  want to get married
Why
don't want to be alone
You can be single and not alone
Marriage bites
Bites what
The big one
It does
Sure
didn't know that
Everybody knows that
Ask my divorced sisters
Or ask my divorced mom and dad
They're all divorced
Everybody's divorced
It didn't used to be that way
wouldn't know
(then) What kind of wife are you looking for
One who's not a mutant
No dogs, huh
Okay
And if possible, 'd like to marry someone from Pasadena
She is speechless
Then: When do you need her by
Two weeks
Well,  could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena
that could take some time
That's what  was afraid of
- , Adam and Eve are in a booth
The  approaches with sandwiches and drinks
What do you mean, you can get me laid
He and the waitress look to Eve for an answer
Could we talk about that a little later
Of course
(sugary, to waitress) Thank you
The amazed waitress leaves
Adam automatically lowers his head and says grace
Two '  at the counter look over and chuckle at the rube
Eve flips them a mean bird and mouths the words "fuck you" as Adam continues to pray
The guys shut up
'  - Eve shares a frame Santa Monica bungalow
It's in a pretty nice neighborhood on a quiet street
Her into the picture and comes to rest half in the street, half on the curb
Adam is driving
Get out
The engine is still running
She rips the keys out of the ignition
Now, get out
Yes, ma'am
Stop that ma'am crap
Sorry
They get out
You almost got us killed
told you 've never driven before
Never drive again
You said it would be easy
was wrong
Is this your house
Yes
like it
She storms off for the house where a   is coming out the front door in a cut-off -shirt and spandex exercise shorts
Swell
is leaving with a cardboard box full of clothes
He is exceedingly
Eve and Adam come up the steps
What are you bitching about now
What are you doing here
forgot some of my stuff
Your stuff
Let me see that
She looks in the box
Holds up a pair of old briefs
You came back for these
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens
And who's this interesting looking fellow
This is Adam
Adam, meet Cliff
(offering hand) How do you do
do fine, Adam
How 'bout yourself
(eyeing Eve) You doin' any good
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be
Shana Gillroy's apartment
Remember her
The model who went to Harvard
Well,  better get going
Bye, Adam
Nice coat
Cliff smiles and bounces down the steps
Why, thank you
Very nice to have met you, Cliff
(then to her) May  ask you a question
He's a former boyfriend
We lived together for about six months
And yes, 'll admit it
've still kind of got a thing for him
(entering the house) That's what you wanted to know, isn't it
(following) Actually,no
was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants
() What
'  - Very good music is playing
Adam listens to one speaker then crosses to listen to the other
Then he goes back to the first
'  - Eve is pouring champagne into a glass that contains two sugar cubes
Next she adds several dashes of bitters
,   , throws together a tray of appetizers as dinner cooks on the stove
(sotto) Eve
This guy is un-be-liev-able
knew you'd like him
Darlin', this is -File stuff
Think about it
The guy's got all this easily negotiable property
He's obviously setting something up very big
Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance
Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco
've heard worse
He rushes out with the tray
- Troy enters with sushi appetizers
Adam is looking at the ceiling
You have very nice ceilings
do
Well, thank you
You like ceilings
Not particularly
Well,  hope you like these
Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed
Or "nori" if you prefer
love sushi
love Lucy
You nut
Eve enters with Adam's drink and two white wines
Here you go
One champagne cocktail
Thank-
thought only hookers drank those things
Well,  know Mom sure likes 'em
Eve and Troy look at each other as she hands him his wine
Dinner in fifteen minutes
Why don't we sit and chat
They do
So, Adam
where on earth are you from
Out-of-town
That's all he'll say
It's a very small place
People don't even know it's there
And it's called
Maybe Eve can guess
She's psychic
Really
Since when
(defensive) Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs
Oh, yes
even guessed his hotel, didn't
Right on the button
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town
Give me your hand
(to himself) Oh, my God
Adam holds out his hand and she takes it, rubbing her finger slowly and gently around in his palm
For her, it's psychic stuff
For him, it's spine-tingling
Okay, let's see
'm not promising anything
You okay
Um-hum
'm seeing
snow
lots of snow
Way up North
Are we getting hot
Yes
You live in
Alaska
The only way in or out of your place is by plane and
you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and
to find a wife
Wow
She tosses back his hand and grabs her wine for a victory gulp
That's right
(to Eve) 've never met anyone like you in my life
She's right
Hey, butthead, 'm clairvoyant
've got goose-bumps all over me
Why not just go to
Nome for supplies and a wife
Isn't that closer
Yeah, right
That's where you'd go to find girls
Nome
He's gay, by the way
Good for you
Well, we try
Listen, let me just ask you a few questions
When did Alaska become a state
1959
Who use to own it
Russia
When did we get it from them
1867
Seward's Folly
We paid 7
2 million dollars for it
tidy sum then, as well as now
'm quoting my father, of course
What's the capitol
Juneau
Hello
It's Anchorage
Gotcha
Sorry, that's the largest city
Troy jumps up and runs out of the room
Where's he gone
He's gone to check your answers on his computer
He has a computer
Sure
In the house
No
We keep it in the backyard
Of course, in the house
It's in there
May  please be excused
Uh
yeah
' He has "Alaska" on his computer screen
Adam enters and looks at the computer, which captivates him
This must be very new
Yeah
It's so small
What are you talking about
This is the new Mac
You a hacker
don't think so
You don't have a computer in your cabin
No
How do you get through those winters
(reading screen) Well, you're right
Juneau
(then, covering the screen with his hand) What's the highest peak
Mt
McKinley
It's also the highest point in North America
(after peeking at the screen) Okay, maybe she is psychic
Let's go eat
(indicating computer) That would knock my father out
Yeah
Oh, yes
(to himself) It would probably kill him
He's a Windows guy then, huh
Yes
He likes windows
Well,  think Windows stink
What do you think of that
guess it's
just a matter of personal taste
True
Troy exits
Adam follows
(:  Scenes 131, 132, and 133 should follow scene 134 rather than precede it
) ,   - Calvin Webber is sleeping soundly
Helen stands quietly at the door looking at him
She finishes off her champagne cocktail and very quietly shuts the door
- Helen goes into the elevator
Obviously, she's had too much to drink
- The floor rumbles and the metal doors open emitting the red light
Soda Jerk and     stand up expectantly and anxiously
Helen appears--and looks at this terribly odd assortment of people
Who are you
(beat, then) 'm the mother
It's the mother
And they all fall down on their knees and worship her with much wailing and rejoicing
Several speak in tongues
Helen stares at them wide-eyed, presses the button on the control box, and goes back down
- Adam's impeccable table manners serve to highlight Eve's and Troy's utter lack of same
But first, you have to start with the clothes
Exactly
(then to Adam) You understand that, don't you
You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that
All right
(to Troy) So, what are you seeing
(looking Adam over) don't know
Money is no object
He's got cards up the wazoo
The what
Wazoo
Try to listen
(then to Troy) Whataya think
Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash
You're serious, aren't you
What's that supposed to mean
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men
Well, that's blunt
'm sorry
But if the shoe fits
And  suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you
see "elegant
" Yeah
Like Ralph Lauren
That's what 'm sensing
The guy with the underpants
That's boring
(indicating Adam) Not on him
'm not wearing his pants
Why not
He has great pants
just don't want to
Okay
Why don't you take him and pick out his clothes
Alright,  will
(talking with her mouth full) 'm busy tomorrow anyway
have to buy six thousand paper napkins
What do you think, Adam
About clothing
Yeah
Whatever you two want
If you've got the time, 've got the wazoo
Eve and Troy watch him eat for a beat or two
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that
No
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time
It's fine
Just give it a try
And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair
She does
Eve and Troy emulate Adam
135 136 '  - Troy and Adam get out of Eve's car with a lot of packages
They head for the house
guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new
Almost all of them
The recovery is very impressive
The recovery
Oh , yeah
Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months
Amazing
'm very impressed
'  - Eve is on the couch doing her toenails when Adam and Troy enter
Adam is in a casually elegant outfit that looks terrific
Both he and Troy are carrying lots of other packages and garment bags
We see names like Gucci, Armani and Lauren
Eve is visibly impressed by Adam's makeover
Well, what do you think
think
it
works
Let me show you the entire trousseau
But first let me show her these
He reaches into a bag and removes a box that contains -- a pair of rollerblades
(cont'd) Eve, can  skate around your block
(making it sexual) How 'bout it, Eve
Can he skate around your block
(beat, then) No
137A 137B 138 - , There is a most unusual band shell location on the beach that is completely covered by graffiti
Eve and Troy sit at one of the many stone tables watching Adam skate all over the place
He wears spandex workout pants and a - shirt
The starting   begins on the nearly deserted commercial section of Venice Beach and then takes us to the band shell
- of him skating and them watching
He's going to kill himself
(then, to Adam) Go skate out on the bike path
It's that way
Okay
He heads out of the band shell
We follow him as he skates into an area that has been given over to the homeless
They sit around in their sleeping bags and blankets and cheer (and jeer) Adam when he passes by
He takes them to be more mutants
- Adam skates to it and is amazed to see two very pretty girls skating in their tiny bikinis
nearly nude body- builder guy goes by on a bike
Then Adam sees the ocean
- breaking on the beach and rocks
- Adam tosses off his roller-blades and walks trance-like towards the waves
- appear on a dune behind him and watch
- Adam raises his arms to greet the ocean, perhaps like a Plains Indian would
Then he joyously runs into the surf and dives
- watching
That water's freezing
He's from Alaska
- He surfaces and throws his fists in the air
- That's why little things mean so much to him
- Begin the record "" over this
'   - Eve enters from her morning shower to find Troy and Adam goofing to The Village People song
She gives Troy a disapproving look
(defensive) What
He wanted to hear some standards
(My hip daughters tell me that "" is enjoying a huge rebirth of popularity at their parties
Apparently they line dance to it
) - helicopter shot follows the -Haul in traffic
(Continue music
) - - Adam and Eve fill a second storage site
(Continue music
) ,    - We see the infield of a gay softball team wheel a double play
- Cheering the play with other gay fans
get it
finally get it
You have to see it to understand it
Music ends
'  -   () She looks out the back window at the rain and shakes her head
She exits the back door with an umbrella
'  - Eve hurries to Adam who is sitting on a lawn chair in the middle of the small back yard, enjoying the rain
She holds the umbrella over her head
Hey, Eve
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain
" Yep
(then watching the rain hit the palm of his hand) You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle
Everything
Until recently wasn 't sure what he meant by that
Yeah
No kidding
Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight
certainly do
Okay
But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think
(rising) No it's not
Yes it is
girlfriend maybe
But a wife
mean
Then just help me find a girlfriend
That's all  ask
'll give you every single card 've got left
Hey, screw you
Okay
You think 'm just somebody you can buy off
Listen, let me tell you something-- (taking her by the arms) Would you do it just because you're my friend
My very best friend
Well
yeah
Okay
He hugs her
Thank , Eve
She's uncomfortable with the hug
Wait a minute
No she's not
" "   - This hip, up-market club is based on a 1940's theme
Establish the   arriving in their black four- wheel vehicles and silver Porsches
Coats and ties
Eve, Troy and Adam arrive on foot
Adam notices the valet parking
Why did you park way back there
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car
Oh
see
Eve looks like she owns the place
- As they enter Adam grabs Troy, who is leading the way
What
Ladies first, Troy
That was close
Adam and Troy follow Eve in
The club is The house music is from the 40's
Adam, Eve and Troy enter a long corridor of booths and walk forward
Adam's got on that terrific dark suit
Women notice
Eve notices them noticing
My goodness gracious
This place is something
Look unimpressed
Bored even
Adam gives it a shot and goes too bored
Vaguely bored
He gets vaguely bored but misses unimpressed by a mile
Unimpressed, but still interested
He tries that
It's like watching a neon sign switch back and forth:  First interested, then not
No
Not crazy
Do  look crazy
Yes
Be loose
He overplays that
Just be yourself
Always good advice
For him
It doesn't work for the rest of us
Holy Mo-ly, Miss Pay-o-ly
This place is neat-o
Adam enters the main room
Eve and Troy follow
There is a bar, a seated section, and a dance floor with a  booth
The  is in a white dinner jacket and does a perfect Humphrey Bogart impression as he ad libs his speel between records
- and  wave when they see Eve and Troy approaching
They ad-lib hellos
Here, and at the tables, the recorded
Jason, Jonathan, this is Adam
Adam, that's them
They shake
How do you do
It's very nice to meet you, Jason and Jonathan
(confidentially, to them) My mother always told me that if you meet a person for the first time it's easier to remember their names if you use those names right away
Jason and Jonathan just stare at him
He's from Alaska
/ (relieved) Oh
slightly drunk beauty named  appears behind Eve
Hi, there, Eve, who's the hunk
Eve hates Sophie
Get lost, Sophie
Sophie pushes her way right up to Adam
Hi
'm Sophie
Hello, Sophie, 'm Adam Webber
Adam lives in Alaska
No shit
Tu parle Francais
Tu a un tres bon accent
You speak beautiful French
'ai habitE a Paris un an
Paris
La ville de lumieres
'est bien rencontrer quelqu'un pour pratiquer le francais
Si tu veux, nous pouvons pratiquer beaucoup des choses ensemble
Eve steps in and takes Adam's hand, drawing him away from Sophie
Quit showing off
We're here on business
Good-bye
Non, cherie
bientot
Eve leads Adam to a table
Troy follows
thought  was here to meet women
Not that one
like her
And don't be so obvious
- Adam, Eve and Troy examine female patrons over drinks
It's white wine for her, imported beer for Troy, and a Rob Roy for Adam
What have you ordered
It's a Rob Roy
very popular drink, 'm told
- slinking by
- () What about her
() No way
Why
think she's very attractive
Adam
She's got bitch written all over her
You do know what "bitch" means, don't you
Yes,  have a dictionary
But  can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that
Or why Cliff would say that about you
Because we're bitches
Look at her
Look at the expression on her face
The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails
Please
How 'bout this one
"This one" is a
Are you kidding
You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table
You don't see that
Eve
Well, 'm trying to educate him
It's nothing personal
Adam,   think for you, we should go for "sweet
" Okay
like that
(swigging her drink) Yeah, sweet
That's a nice way of putting it
(to Troy) What do  say to Miss Sweet when meet her
Um
Eve
It's not so much what you say but how you say it
Women like men who are unpredictable
Really
Yes, really
Basically, they want what they think they can't have
Same with guys
That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals
doing precisely that
Then: That's ridiculous
Maybe
But that's how it works
Ah-ha
There's " Miss Sweet
"  At the hors d'oeuvres table
- She's a pretty young thing with a sweet face
Yeah
Could be
Go say hello, Romeo
Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me
(very serious) Okay
All right
(then) And what do  say
Say something surprising
And funny
Lie, if need be
Yes
Lying is always a very effective dating tool
Okay
Thank you, my friends
Adam rises
(cont'd) By the way, that's a great play
What
Romeo and Juliet
cried at the end
Did you
Adam nods and shoves off
'm not sure  want to watch this
Eve puts her hand to her head -- hating herself and still not  sure exactly why
- crossing to Miss Sweet
(to himself) Surprising and funny
Well,  know a duck who bought some lip balm
' Adam sheepishly approaches Miss Sweet, then gathers himself: Hi
(not sweet) Yes
(beat, then) was wondering if you might help me
seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here
Miss Sweet stares at him for a beat or two, then chuckles
Oh, now, that's a great one
(big smile) You like it
(a little clap) Bravo
Thank-
They both laugh
- Stunned
as they watch Adam and Miss Sweet
Another pretty young woman () joins Adam
- Heather is a friend of Miss Sweet's
This is my new friend
'm Adam Webber
He's really funny
Hi
'm Heather
"Heather
"   don't believe 've ever heard that name before
There's a slight beat before both girls laugh
Yeah, right
told you
He's funny
- More stunned
Eve finds that she very much hates watching Adam having a good time with other healthy non-mutants
- We work on Rodeo Drive
But we're both professional dancers
Really
You dance
took a dance lesson everyday of my life until a couple of days ago
You're kidding
No, 'm not
My mom taught me
Your mom was a dancer
She is a dancer
And a lovely one
You would like her very much
Shall we dance
Sure
They head for the dance floor
- watching
- jitterbug song comes on and so does Adam
He and Miss Sweet are a little rough on take-off, but they hit smooth sailing soon enough
He's terrific at picking up the new stuff she shows him
-  & They are shocked
- Heather cuts in on Miss Sweet as the other dancers stop to watch someone who is so much better than them
The three of them begin to dance together
-  & You know, he's a very, very good-- Shut up
-  / Adam dances beautifully with the two women
We between them and Eve
- Adam, Miss Sweet and Heather complete their dance with great aplomb
Other dancers applaud them
Someone is Adam and his dance partners look over to: - She is whistling like a guy calling his dog
Troy is embarrassed
Must you
Eve points at Adam and beckons broadly for him to come over -- a basketball coach calling her player off the floor
What in the hell is wrong with you
- Is that your girl friend
No
Would you please excuse me
If you'll please come back
will certainly try
And thank you both very much for the dance
He leaves
When was the last time you saw manners like that
Yeah
It's like meeting a foreigner or something
- as Adam comes over
The music is not so loud now
(to Troy) Go to the bathroom
Right here
(then, off her look) Well, you're being so bossy  wasn't sure
Troy rises and exits
Adam arrives and sits down
You wanted to see me
You're not from Alaska
Where'd you learn to dance like that
And there are no starving people, are there
Why are you suddenly so mad at me
Don't change the subject
want you to tell me the truth about yourself
've never lied to you
've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but 've never lied
You think 'm some sort of sap
Don't you
No
admire you
fell in love with you the first time  saw you
(off her look) did
think that you are the most-- want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to
All right
Let me tell you the whole thing
In 1962-- () Well, well, well
Don't we clean up nice
Cliff steps up to the table
Adam, automatically a gentleman, rises and offers his hand
Hello, Cliff, how are you this evening
Cliff barely shakes his hand
Not bad
Then he sits in Adam's seat
But  do miss that green sport coat of yours
Thank you very much
But, Cliff, that's my seat
And  was just-- (to Eve) How 'bout a drink at the bar
(pause, then) Sure
They rise
Cliff gestures to the chair
It's all yours
Eve and Cliff go to the bar
Adam sits down glumly
He looks across the room and catches the eye of Miss Sweet who is seated at a table with Heather is hitting on them
between Adam and them we see Miss Sweet's smile escalate
Then she nudges Heather who also looks over and smiles
Adam smiles back
Finish with a      of Miss Sweet's hair, butt and legs
- Eve and Cliff are in cozy conversation at the bar
Jonathan, Jason, and Sophie are in the bg
- Troy returning from the restroom
He is surprised to see Eve at the bar with Cliff
When he looks back at the dance floor table, Adam is not there
- Sipping wine
So where is your roommate, the model
You know,  don't know
And looking at you,  don't care
It's been too long, Eve
() Please excuse this interruption
Oh, brother
- Adam steps closer, looking past Cliff at Eve
Eve,  don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair
What
'm sorry, and legs
Legs, butt and hair
Well, isn't he
And shallow, as well
(the shallowest guy in the world) Shallow
'm shallow
Go home, Adam
Go to your hotel
Yeah
Before  kick your ass
He gives Adam a shove
Cliff,  must warn you
know how to defend myself
Do ya
Cliff throws a right which Adam calmly blocks and counters with a short right jab to Cliff's mouth, snapping his head back
It's not a big punch, but very, very quick
It makes Eve mad and astonishes Troy, Jason and Jonathan
Stop it, you two
(slightly insecure) guess we shouldn't fight in here
(lowering his guard) Yes,  agree
Cliff draws back another right
Adam flicks out a quick left to Cliff's cheek, again snapping his head back, but not his body
(These aren't big movie hits
) Cliff takes a beat or two then draws back his right fist again
Adam pops him in the nose
Cliff drops his right arm to his side
Adam
'm sorry
(increasingly insecure) Maybe we shouldn't fight at all
Fighting is pretty immature
(lowering his guard) It certainly is
agree with you completely
Eve
'm leaving
don't blame you
(turning to Eve) Eve, 'm sorry
Seeing an opportunity, Cliff rears back with another right
Adam deftly pops him in the mouth again with a short right jab
(deeply insecure) Well, good night, everyone
Troy, Jonathan and Jason say good night to him
Cliff walks unsteadily away bleeding from the mouth and both nostrils
(Hopeful that no one has noticed that he's very subtly just gotten the crap beat out of him
) 'm leaving, too
But, Eve,  would-- And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because  quit
This is ridiculous
You're ridiculous
'm ridiculous
She exits
Adam looks over at Troy who shrugs
'  - Troy takes out his keys as he approaches the front door
But the door opens
Eve stands there in sweats
Agitated
He go back to the hotel
Uh
he might of
'  - Troy enters
She slams the door
What's that mean
We did not leave together
Who did he leave with
What's it to you
'm his pimp
He left with the dancers, didn't he
Hey, you're the psychic
Eve, the psychic pimp
You tell me
Those sluts
Yeah
But who's not a slut these days
He enters the kitchen She follows him: He gets something to drink
Where are you going
To bed
To bed
Yeah
'm not the one who's in love with the guy
What
Now hold on
Wait one damn minute
Troy exits into his office
He plops down on the chair
In the first place,  don't fall in love with weirdos 've only known for four or five days
Yes, you do
And  don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards
Uh, yes, you do
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean
Yes, you do
Or have perfect table manners
(sitting up) You know,  asked him about that
And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them
See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners
didn't know that
thought it was a way of appearing superior
(then) Know what else he told me
(sitting on the bed) What
He thinks that  am a gentleman and that you are a lady
Well, consider the source
don't even know what a lady is
Exactly
thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses
Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible
That's it
If you don't do that, nothing else matters
The cars, the clothes, the houses
Where did he get all that information
From the oddest place
His parent's told him
don't think  got that memo
So now  suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible
He didn't leave with them
Well
admit it
'm glad to hear that
He left with Sophie
What
It's true
She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear
Oh, no
Not Sophie
No way
Please don't tell me that
What are you going to do
Go over to her place and kick in the door
You're goddamn right  am
She exits, then sticks her hand back in
(cont'd) You coming
(cringing) don't think so
Coward
She exits
Gentleman coward, to you
148 - Eve hurries out of the house leaving the front door wide open
She runs down the porch steps, across the yard, and to her car, which she unlocks with the usual fumbling
Come on
Come on, damn it
She jumps in and sticks the key in the ignition
Adam appears at the passenger window
Hi
Eve    as she throws open her door and jumps out into the street where she falls down, hurting her knee
Adam runs around the car to help her to her feet
Dogs start barking in several houses
Eve
Scare me, why don't you
You stupid son of a bitch
'm really sorry
What in the hell are you doing here
You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie
know
and 'm really sorry
Well, you should be
Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck
What
Goodnight
Eve marches, with a limp, back to the house
Eve, if you'll let me,  can -- Look
'm limping
How attractive is that
What if this is for life
know first aid
Well, you had better
He chases her up the porch steps
- Lights are low and warm
Adam is attempting to swab the abrasion on Eve's knee through the tear in her old sweat pants
Wait a minute
She reaches down and gives the knee hole a good rip, revealing her leg from above the knee to the gym sock
There
Thanks
He takes the back of her calf in one hand and applies the antiseptic to her knee with the other
It stings and she flinches
Steady
Steady
It's going to be all right in no time
He leans down and blows on the wound
of that
of his hand on her calf
of her looking down at him, watching as he blows gently on her knee
went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable
Is that what you call it
But it just wasn't where  wanted to be so  left as politely as  could and found a taxi
But  asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel
There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live
"  You know it
Sing it to me
(softly, saying it as much as singing it) "All at once am --several stories high-- knowing 'm--on the street-- where you live
"  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves
She reaches down, and taking hold of his collar, draws him to her and they kiss very romantically and at length
Then: Adam
dumb question, but humor me
Have you ever had sex before
No
She sits up
How is that possible
During the following speech  pushes past him and lingers on her as she gradually realizes that Adam is mental
(sitting up) In 1962, when the bomb was dropped on Los Angeles, my parents were in our fallout shelter
That's where  was born
We only survived because it was a huge shelter as fallout shelters go
My father worked on it secretly for years
When he had to, he used contractors, but always from out-of- state and always for just a portion of the job
He told them it was a secret government experiment done through CalTech
My Dad's not a liar, but he felt in this case he had no choice
Of course, it had to be a secret, because we had just enough supplies to last three people thirty-five years
That's also why  have no brothers or sisters
The air vent was the really tricky part, but he was able to cut into a flood control sewer
What 'd like to do Eve, is take you down into the fallout shelter with me
We could live there with my Mom and Dad
My dad said if  found a healthy girl should "bring her on down"
And you look plenty healthy to me
Uh-huh
Adam
Yes, Eve
want you to go back to the hotel now
'll call you a cab
Of course
shouldn't be over here at this hour
He rises
She gets up and leads him to the door
That's right
And 'll see you in the morning in the lobby
Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi
Not at all
And Eve thank you for tonight
and for the kiss
My first
My pleasure
It was at least as good as the sky
Really
Okay
And  think better than the ocean
'm serious
Neat
Goodnight
- Adam comes out glowing with happiness
He looks heavenward
And does his patented thumbs up
Behind him we hear Eve locking all the locks on her front door
- -  lurches down the street
Adam struggles with the gears as Troy worries about his driving skills
Goddamn, Adam
Wait a minute
He promptly pulls over and turns off the engine
'm sorry
took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't
'm so sorry
No
There's an Adult Bookstore back there
'll be right back
Adam jumps out of the truck and runs off
Without question, the strangest man 've ever met
- Adam runs up
The bookstore looks familiar
Adam runs to the next store
It's a bar
He runs to the next store
It's the Malt Shop
Adam is thrilled
He tries the front door and at first it does not open
The Soda Jerk is leading about twelve followers in prayers
Give us a sign
That's all we ask
Give us some sort of sign
The front door opens and Adam peers in
He sees the Soda Jerk; smiles broadly at him and waves
Then he closes the door
The Soda Jerk grabs his heart and faints
His followers rush to his aid
- Adam jumps in
Okay, Troy
Let's get those all-beef frozen patties
How 'bout we check with Eve first
You bet
So, did you buy a movie
What
magazine
toy perhaps
In the bookstore
(concentrating on his driving) No,  wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on
(laughing in agreement) know what you mean
usually wear a big hat and dark glasses
Does that work
Yeah
Seems to
Adam would not have thought that
'  - Adam springs in, Troy drags in behind him (knowing the deal)
Eve is standing away from the door next to a kind looking professional woman named Dr
Aron
Hi, Eve
Hi, Adam
This is, uh
'm Nina Aron, Adam
How do you do
Very well, thank you
'm with the County Family Services Department
Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life
Fallout shelter
There's a difference
Adam, 'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr
Brown
appears from the kitchen
He's good-sized man who dresses casually
Adam becomes uneasy
Hello
He nods politely
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences
Come where
My office
For how long
Well, that depends
thank you very much for the invitation, but 'm quite busy today
Perhaps  could see you tomorrow
Adam
you should go with Dr
Aron
It's the best thing
The best thing for you
promise
All right, Eve
If you say so
do
(to Aron) Could  please just go home
was lost, but this morning  found home and  promise not to bother any of you ever again
Let's go talk first, Adam
Yes, ma'am
The two come forward
One opens the door and one beckons for Adam to step out
Good-bye, Adam
Goodbye
Adam looks back at Eve, who looks away
Adam exits
(to Eve) You'll be hearing from me
She shuts the door
Troy sits dejectedly
Well what was  supposed to do
He wants me to live underground with him
That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think
know
know
You did the right thing
Eve goes to the window and watches as with him chasing
Oh, no
What
She runs out
He follows
Adam races down the sidewalk
He cuts left and runs between houses
Brown is not as fast
' Eve and Troy run out to Aron who is dialing her cell phone
Oh, my God
He'll catch him
(then into phone) Hi
This is Nina Aron
've got a run away and 'm going to need police assistance
No
Not the police
Don't call them
have to
If a complaint is made and the person resists obser-- No,  can't have that
They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs-- Calm down, please
This man needs help and you need protection from him
That's obvious
You know,  don't think so
'm confused but you know,  don't think he'd ever hurt me
don't think he'd hurt anyone
And now you must let me be the judge of that
was frightened and  didn't know what to think
But you know- believe him
think he just wants to go home
Wherever the hell that is
Let's all remain calm
That's the key thing
Suddenly Adam appears from the side of the house, startling everyone
He tosses his hotel key to Eve
The key to my hotel room
want you to have my baseball cards
(running to the truck) And please be sure to pay my bill
Young man, stop right there
Aron looks around for Mr
Brown
Adam jumps into the truck
Aron yells for him to stop
Stop, right now
Get out of that truck
Adam, you really shouldn't try to drive that truck
(starting the engine) Bye, Troy
Bye, Adam
And thanks for always being happy
What
Gay
Oh
(yelling to Adam) Well, you're
certainly welcome
Adam gets the truck in reverse and backs out of the driveway and into a parked car
Hey
That's my car, you son of a bitch
Getting the truck in first, Adam has to go down the sidewalk a bungalow or two before he can get back onto the street
He clips two parked cars as he does
Brown comes running from the side of the house
His pants are torn
(cont'd) Where the hell have you been
fell down
(to Troy and Eve) What's the license number of that truck
Don't ask them
They're as fucked-up as the other guy
Let's all just try to remain calm
That's the key thing
How 'bout  just knock the shit out of you
Brown has to grab her
-- - , Eve and Troy arrive in her  to see that the two locker doors are open and much of the stuff has been carried off
Eve drops her head in disappointment
guess he took what he could
(putting her head in her hand) Good God
you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you
Fallout shelter
She gives him a look
(cont'd) There's a difference
,  - , Helen is using the hip-reduction machine while Calvin reads, How to Win Friends and Influence People
The distant sound of the hatchway being open gets their attention
Then: () Mom
Dad
'm home
They jump up and race into the living room, meeting Adam halfway
The parents kiss and hug their son before noticing that he's got the Soda Jerk with him
've got almost everything we need
And this nice man
Archbishop Melker
We met earlier
He promptly drops to his knees in supplication
and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down
But we've got to hurry
Are you in trouble, son
think 'm being chased by a psychiatrist
psychiatrist
It happens
My goodness
How bad is it up there
Horrible
You have something on your forehead
know
'   - Eve and Troy look around
She opens a drawer and sees how nicely folded and put away things are
Troy notices " Guide" and the Gideon Bible sitting out with a page marker in it
He opens the night table drawer and takes out the cigar box
This it
Eve nods
What do you want to do with it
Give it back to him
And if we can't find him
We'll find him
, ' Eve enters and looks at how tidy Adam's toiletries are; how the comb is just right in the brush; how the tooth paste (Ipanna in a '61 tube) has been squeezed from the bottom; and at how he has hung up his socks to dry
It makes her very sad
She picks up the toothpaste and holds it as if it were his ring
() Hey, Eve
Eve
He enters with stock certificates and sees that she's very close to crying
What's wrong
don't know
Everything's so neat
It's all just so
goddamn dear
(starting to cry) Damn
See these
Found them in the box with the cards
These are stock certificates
&
Polaroid
Instead of taking the certificates, she hands him the toothpaste and sits down on the bed in a funk
(cont'd) (looking at the toothpaste) Ipana
think  remember that brand
(then) Oh, here, you should read this
"Trademark, 1961
" He holds out the tube and she takes it to read
- Adam, the Soda Jerk and fifteen followers hurriedly unload the truck, taking provisions into the back door of the malt shop
'  - Their pal Jason is on the phone with Troy
Purchased in 1958 and '59
Ten thousand shares of each
They'd be worth millions
Hell,  don't know
millions upon millions upon millions
How 'bout that
- Troy is on the phone
Eve is standing, looking at the stock certificates
Thanks, Jason
He slams down the phone and jumps to his feet
Millions upon millions upon millions
The cards
The stock
The clothes
The toothpaste
The guy was on the level
And you blew it
man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life
And what do you do
Have him committed
Yeah
That's thinking
He was always so "nice"
How was supposed to know that's a good thing
"Nice" is weird
Nice is
what is "nice"
It's not cool
'll tell you that
(beat, then) Was it ever
don't know
like to think so
Well, at least  fell for him before found out he was rich
That's new
(then) Wait a minute
He said today he knew where home was
What happened this morning
Where did you go
To get some frozen poultry
Then what
We came back to the house
You didn't stop anywhere else
No
No, wait a minute
We stopped at a porno store
What
An adult bookstore
He was very excited about seeing it
You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley
Come on
She heads out
Trendy address
They exit
- Troy and Eve approach and enter
- The Pakistani looks up briefly when Eve and Troy enter
There are two male customers in the bg
Eve taps her foot on the floor hoping to hear a hollow sound
But it is solid
She and Troy move about the store tapping their feet and finally jumping up and down
The Pakistani and two customers become concerned
(to Pakistani) Have you got a basement
(indicating merchandise) Believe me, all the really good stuff is right here
Is there a back entrance
Are you kidding
Of course
He points to the rear of the store
- The Soda Jerk drives the rental truck away leaving the lot empty and the door to the Malt Shop closed
Troy and Eve appear after the truck is gone
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop
None of this stuff was here in 1962
The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we
want to go home
Yeah
Maybe he'll call
They turn left to get back to the avenue
'  - The phone is ringing
Then the recorder answers
Hi
Troy and Eve are out so leave a message
And if you want to leave a number don't say it fast
hate that
Say it slow
Thank you
Beep, Uh, Eve
this is Adam
Look,  just wanted to thank you for everything you did for me
and  wanted to tell you that
uh
that  wish so many good things for you
wish so hard that all of your dreams come true
Um
, uh
- Eve lets Troy drive
She clutches the cigar box and rests her head on the seat as they pull away from the curb in front of the bookstore
low rider passes them on the left
Eve sees an old hag being shoved out of the bar and a homeless man slipping into the abandoned malt shop and the cross-dressing   making eyes at passing cars and Adam hanging up the pay phone he just used
Adam
Where
Stop
She rolls down her window
Adam
- Turning when he hears Eve yell his name
- Running from the car
The cigar box falls to the street and the contents scatter
Eve could care less
Besides, Troy is there to retrieve everything
In a series of cuts and slo-mo action the couple race into each other's arms
to the pleasure of all the lowlifes mentioned above
Now the street looks more like Capra than Scorsese
She's surprised that she wants to kiss him so bad
He's surprised that he gets so aggressive
,  - , Helen watches Calvin work on the timing device for the locks with a screwdriver
How long will you set it for this time
thought ten years
Well, that's
considerably shorter than before
was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all
mean the radiation is gone and
To keep what's up there from getting down here
It's not the radiation 'm worried about
() Mom
Dad
They turn to see Adam walking forward with Eve
'd like for you to meet Miss Eve Rustokov
Calvin knows a Russian name when he hears one
But he chooses not to pursue it
(stepping forward, offering her hand) How do you do, Mrs
Webber
Mr
Webber
(rather dumb-struck) Hello
Uh-huh
've heard so many wonderful things about you
Well, please excuse us
We
we haven't entertained a guest in
um
Some time
What can  offer you, Eve
Mom
Eve and  have to go
What
can't explain it now
But  want you to set the locks for two months
You have more than enough of everything
Then we'll be back to get you
But,  don't understand
And, 'm asking you to trust me without understanding why
Well, in that case
of course, son
Of course
They are wonderful parents
We have to go
No, wait
At least stay for dinner
Yes, please
You must
/ Well
sure
okay
- Calvin mixes drinks just like he did at the party in 1962
Adam is with him
- Helen races around, just like she did in 1962, getting the roast ready
Eve
watches
Adam said  shouldn't mention the Communists
Oh, yes
Please, don't mention the Communists
- Helen hurries out of the kitchen to take her seat
The others are already there
Eve
hope 'm not being nosey, but are you and Adam
um
dating
Yes, Mrs
Webber we are
(then) 'm also from Pasadena
Helen nearly comes unglued
Calvin is pleased, too
He raises his tea cup
toast
To Adam and Eve
The others also raise their cups and everyone clicks
Then they drink
(gagging) What is this sh
stuff
Hot Dr
Pepper
Most people don't know how good it is heated up
You know, they don't, do they
They begin to eat
(cont'd) What about grace
Oh, my goodness
We almost forgot
(then) like your friend, Adam
They all join hands and lower their heads
Calvin leads them
() And you thought your parents were weird
- Adam and Eve are with a
The broker unlocks the gate of a chain-link fence and Adam and Eve step onto the property
The broker's Lexus is in the b
g
It's like the Garden of Eden, don't you think
Adam and Eve respond but we can't hear them under Eve's narration
() You see, that night, Adam had a choice between me and his parents
173 - Adam and Eve are working with a at the site of a new home
They have plans and are discussing dimensions
() It's truly amazing what you can get done when you have unlimited funds
Did you know you can have whole houses built in just a matter of months
All you have to say is this
" don't care what it costs
"  And then, of course, you've got to really mean it, which no one ever does
- It is under construction
- Adam, Eve and Troy enter
This is great stuff from the fifties and the sixties
Adam finds things very similar to what he grew up with
There's a lamp (or something) that's just like the lamp (or something) from the Webber living room
That lamp is perfect
(very faggy) 'm holding that for Elton John
(faggy right back) Oh,  think not
176   (   172D) () - Adam and Eve embracing as Troy picks up baseball cards and the street people look on
Eve, 've got to go back
My parents can't handle this up here
And there was no bomb, was there
No
See
can't tell them that
can't ever let them know
It makes their life
well, frankly
a joke
can't let that happen
You understand
We can make this work, Adam
Believe me
'm very good at making things work
My mother's like that
They kiss again
- Eve and Troy are showing large color drawings to the Soda Jerk
In  we see the Malt Shop exterior all dolled up with a big lighted sign that says "
" There's valet parking and the Adult Bookstore and Bar have been turned into a Souvenir Center (think Planet Hollywood)
Another drawing shows fashionable guests boarding the elevator
() It took a while to convince Archbishop Milker that Adam wasn't God, and he was pretty broken up about it, too, until  showed him my plans for Los Angeles' hottest and most original night spot
Other drawings show dancing on the shelter patio and guided tours being shown various parts of the shelter
You'll be a ten percent partner and still retain ownership of the entrance
Praise the Lord
And  mean the real one
- 1962 Cadillac leads a 1962 windowless van through automatic gates that have signs on them saying: and
Troy drives the van
Eve drives the Cadillac
Adam is her passenger
() Our idea was to bring Adam's parents up to the surface very slowly
Make them very comfortable and then break the bad news to them that there was no nuclear holocaust
And if that doesn't kill them Adam's going to tell his father about the Internet
- The cars pull up and Adam lets his parents out
They go bonkers when they see the house
- The parents enter first
They are thrilled, shocked, etc
- As a demonstration, Troy removes a hot cup of coffee from the microwave
Helen is happy to see this handy new device
Calvin, the inventor, sticks his head into the machine to investigate its workings
- Adam demonstrates the  to his parents as Troy and Eve look on
You put the tape in here and you get a movie -- in your own home
We see the main title to Natural Born Killers come up on the screen
Troy and Eve rush forward
/ No
'  - It has been turned into an office for Calvin
This is your bedroom
No, Mom, 've turned it into Dad's office
Well, where are you -- Eve and
eloped
We're married
No
Yes
Is that all right
It's wonderful, dear
Wonderful
They hug
(cont'd) Calvin
They're married
(offering his hand to both) That's wonderful
We Webber guys have mighty good luck when it comes to women
Calvin points out the computer
(cont'd) What's that thing
It's kind of a combination television- typewriter-telephone-post office type of thing
(leading Calvin out) 'll show it to you later
- Adam and Calvin exit the house
They wear baseball gloves and start playing catch
(Calvin notes the modern construction of his glove, but does not comment on it
) This is great son, just great
By the way, Eve's last name
Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it
It's Ukrainian
Her grandparents immigrated here
Uh-huh
Dad,  don't know how to tell you this
And  was going to wait a while, but  think
Dad,there was no bomb
plane crashed into our backyard looked it up in old newspapers
(after a while) You're sure
Positive
The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired
The Cold War is over
That's what everybody believes
Yes, sir
It's true
What
Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up
" Yes
That's kind of how it was
Uh-huh
Adam throws the ball, but Calvin makes no attempt to catch it
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant
You've got to hand it to 'em
"No, we didn't drop any bombs
Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed
Poor, poor us
"   bet they've even asked the West for aid
Right
Uh,  think they have
Hah
Those cagey rascals
Those sly dissemblers
Those, uh
(he can't think of another description, so he moves on) They've finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes
() Have you ever in your life seen a son who did more for his parents
Helen comes out with a tray of champagne cocktails
() Adam says that this is simply how things work
First the parents take care of the children and then the children take care of the parents
He says historically, that's how it works
Eve and Troy are sitting by the window
Adam and Helen come in to offer cocktails to Troy and Eve
() Whenever Adam gives me such obviously incorrect information,  just smile, slap him on the knee, and look out the window
Why spoil his dreams
They're such wonderful dreams
The  wanders off of them and shoots out the glass doors
We see Calvin behind the house
measuring off the dimensions for a fallout shelter
- Calvin continues to measure as we pull way back and up
Perry Como sings "We'll Meet Again"
