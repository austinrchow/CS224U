Warn the President
Morton zig-zags through a grove of trees, a desperate attempt to avoid the horrible serrated disc
But the ruse is futile
The disc goes straight through the trees, slicing a path straight as the crow flies
- dilapidated, broken down, weathering away in the field
Morton runs around the wagon -- but the straight through the sideboards
Wood shavings spit everywhere
There's no stopping this thing

He turns, incomprehensibly mumbling, pleading for his life, cowering

McGRATH is a fearsome-looking Indian in a well-tailored suit
Long black braids descend incongruously from under a homburg hat
As for his companion
McGRATH is a mountain of drunken pus
Six foot, sweating like a Devonshire hog with his tattered, undersized Confederate dress jacket buttoned all the way to the top
His ear has been hacked off and replaced by what looks to be a miniature leather Victrola horn
McGrath smiles at our Soiled Dove and makes a little kissing gesture

Ah, this hole is a safety issue
'm thinking, what if it starts to rain and the water level goes up
It could suck you right up
'm protecting you
(variations) Saloon Girl frustrated, has grabbed West's boxer shorts (with little horses on them) and plugs the hole with them
Problem solved
Belle, you don't just ram a man's underbritches into a knothole
You wanna plug the hole, you ram your own britches in there
West is at a loss

The only people more shocked than he is are the guards and the Rebs he just dropped in on
West picks himself up, smiles coolly at the drenched slack-jaws
Okay, who just made a wish
Was it you
He looks up at the freaked-out Saloon Girl, still in the tank
She hangs on with one hand, the other hand clutches his clothes
could sure use those clothes now
She responds by Frisbee-ing his hat down
West picks it up, with a look
uses it to cover his genitals

But he never gets that word out
Bang
West lashes a lightning martial arts kick to the Reb's jaw
Fought five long years with the Union Army not to hear that word again
And you boys lost, remember
As the other Reb comes at him, he spins, still holding the hat in front of him

Down that one goes

How 'bout some pants
As she throws the rest of his clothes down in a heap

His eyes drift upwards
to the balcony where
-   - have come up back stairs lugging a heavy steamer trunk
McGRATH 'm still waiting on my guns and ammo, but  see my men have brought your merchandise
McGrath subtly gestures with his eyes to the balcony for Hudson to confirm
Hudson nods
McGRATH had expected to be delivering it personally to Mr
Hudson quickly cuts him off before he can say the name
The Indian speaks in a very precise King's English
My employer, here in a brothel
(a small ironic smile) That would be quite
redundant

As the carriage passes under the gas lamp, we can make out the top-hatted silhouette of McGrath's "employer," Clustered around him inside the cab are three more beautiful women
As he strokes the cheek of the  one with the back of his hand like a cat

Hudson,  wasn't planning to walk those oaken stairs with you
Direct me to the poot, sir
Something young and creamy
gamer that takes to the crop and spur
McGrath looks to the singer (Rita), who beats a hasty retreat from him after her song
So, once again, McGrath lays his rheumy eyes on
She's oblivious, more intrigued by the ex-Rebs on the balcony with the trunk
As she starts for the stairs
a man's hand grabs her
It's the Eye-Crossed Reb again
- You drive a hard bargain, lady
All right, fifty cents to take them big juicy lips and
Still not interested
She tries to pull away
But the Reb won't let go
- But you gotta be interested
You're a whore
Suddenly the coquettishness in the eyes becomes rage
The falsetto becomes a baritone growl
(baritone) That doesn't mean a girl can't have high standards
Just as the Reb registers the odd new voice
wham
Her corsage springs out and whacks him right in the jaw
The Reb's eyes roll back
and he slumps to the ground
Whooa, hoss
the Soiled Dove is a man
He's and his true profession will be revealed to us shortly
But now, as he/she stashes the unconscious Reb behind the bar, straightens bosom and wig

West hops up on one leg, smacks the guy with a mule kick
Now he puts his arm through his shirt sleeve
When the hand emerges out of the cuff, it's balled in a fist -- which coldcocks the other guard
Could  have a little privacy here
As if in response, the water tower, still hovering above, now crashes to the floor -- obliterating his opponents
Thank you
He calmly looks up in time to catch the falling, naked, screaming Saloon Girl in his arms
You'll have to excuse me, darlin'
but my evidence is getting away
West gallantly puts her down, jumps up, grabs the overhead block and tackle system and slides through the warehouse
As the  , which has spooked, past
- sails onto the runaway wagon
As he pulls himself into the back, he gives the shivering Saloon Girl a tip of his hat -- now on his head
Sorry about there not being any towels

Just as he gets   to the beautiful singer, who looks sick at the thought,   suddenly Gordon intrudes
He/she blocks out the singer,   poses coquettishly -- sucking a lollypop
McGRATH What's your name, missy

Would you like to go upstairs
McGRATH Oh, indeedy  would
Gordon/Dora starts to go as the Eye-Crossed Reb wakes up
He grabs him/her, very pissed
- Hey, c'mere
Who the hell are you anyway
McGRATH She's
mine
Blam
McGrath emphasizes his claim by gut-shooting the Reb
The shot makes Dora/Gordon jump and the room go quiet
As the Reb crumples, McGrath turns back to Gordon/Dora, oddly inspired
McGRATH feel like
a ditty
/ ditty
But General
(trying to be coquettish again) my talents really lay elsewhere
McGRATH Nothing stokes the fire in my loins like a ditty
McGrath hauls him/her over to the piano player
McGRATH You've got some pretty fair lungs on ya, girl, now use 'em
He punctuates with a slap to Gordon/Dora's rump
The other singer (Rita) watches too

Eyes widen

But clinking together ominously as the wagon races over the cobblestones
Backwards-ass bumpkins got a wagon full of nitro
West tries to steady the glass vials with his hands
but it's no use
He quickly climbs over the boxes, onto the buckboard seat
But the reins are dragging on the ground beneath the frothing horses
West leaps onto the horses as the wagon careens down the street
He pulls himself over the first one's neck
onto the next horse
And as he tries for the lead horse, he falls between them

He/she struggles through the song in a very tough room
/ 'And tell them  tried

Encouraged, Gordon/Dora belts out the next verses

Whoa now
But it doesn't whoa
The wagon goes around a corner up on two wheels
It's about to tilt over when West grabs both the horses' ears, yanks them back -- screaming into them
said, whoa
This approach seems to work

and with it the wagon hanging over the edge of a steep drop
Jim carefully climbs off
He slaps the dust on his jacket, straightens the crease in his trousers
When he looks up, a bitter smile
Well, well, this is workin' out to be a perfect day

He/she registers a mild reaction of shock
Closes that door and moves on to

The two rebs sitting on the trunk
At their feet is a wriggling burlap sack

He stares at this black Samaritan, obviously having no clue who he is

The detectives back away from the hair-trigger cowboy as fast as they can

-                                    35 President Grant goes over to his desk, lights a cigar
Backlit in the haze, the portly bearded figure lives up to the myth
Been a lot of death threats lately Cabinet made me hire some damn detectives
(by way of apology) Drink, cigar
Thank you, sir
West limps across the room to the bar, pours himself a glass of whiskey, takes a cigar out of the humidor

Now West's blood is up
Sir,  had him right in my hands when some half-a-sissy wearin' a dress ruined
(cuts him off) Artemus Gordon
You
know him
Of course  know him, he's the best marshal 've got
He's a genius
(off West's incredulous look) Gordon has proven himself time and again as a very cunning operator with a rapacious intellect
Nothing will stop him from completing a mission for his President
except the impulsive actions of a headstrong cowboy
West just looks at him soberly
Draws his gun and places it against the President's head
Grant's eyes widen
Who are you
am the President of the United States
West points the  to the ceiling and pulls the trigger
As Grant jumps a foot and plaster rains down
Wrong answer
Who are you
am the President of

The President went to West Point not Harvard
(
) Will somebody tell me what the hell this stunt is all about
36
-   -   -                 36 - (the real one) stands in the doorway, hands on hips, surrounded by his house detectives -- their guns drawn
West nudges the fake Grant in the fake belly with his gun barrel -- go ahead
Sheepishly, Gordon starts peeling off his primitive, but effective, facial prosthetics
Sir, in perilous times like these, was simply illustrating how someone impersonating you could actually walk right into the very bowels of the White House
Just as Gordon makes his intestinal allusion, West takes a ceremonial bayonet off Grant's desk and pokes a hole in the inflated bladder that was his fake paunch
The out, finishes deflating with a flatulent --
(Hey, the first whoopee cushion
) Gordon scowls at him
You're clever, Gordon
One day it'll get you killed
West smirks as Grant looks up at the bullet hole in the ceiling, then fixes West with a disapproving eye
And you, West -- not every situation calls for your patented approach of shoot first, shoot later, shoot again -- then when they're all dead, try to ask a question or two
(shakes his head) Working together will be good for both of you

You work the way your Commander In Chief tells you to work

Ten of our country's best scientists
all kidnapped in the last year
By General McGrath, it now seems
(turns to them) The fact is, gentlemen, you've both been working on the same case all along
Why did it take you so long to realize it
Well, sir, one of us was still trying to figure out if he was a man or a woman
The detectives snicker over that one
Grant's had enough
don't have time for this bickering
One week, if we're to believe this
Grant holds out a letter to Gordon and West
Gordon snatches it, reads: (reading) 'General Grant, the scientists that you seek are in my employ -- () () - Rev

An aide presents a glass case
Inside is a cake in the shape of the White House
(reaching inside) Marzipan, isn't it
(grabs his hand) Wait
Suddenly dozens of deadly-looking spiders swarm out from inside the cake
Gordon jerks his hand back
It's McGrath, sir
The South is rising again
'm gonna stop it
Sir, West's obsession aside, McGrath may be a vicious killer, but a mastermind he is not
So whom do we seek
After consulting with Intelligence
(cuts him off) McGrath's headed for New Orleans
The longer we stand here talkin', the farther away he gets
don't need 'Intelligence' to tell me that
Ah, so that would mean you rely on Stupidity
Grant's had enough
Gentlemen
'm leaving today for Utah where the transcontinental railroads will be joined at Promontory Point
Grant points to a map of the United States
The railroad lines have been drawn in
still a gap between them

Now look, you two are the best 've got
Put aside your differences and stop this madman
whoever he is
If you fail, well
we may never know how great this country could've been

Dismissed
They both return Grant's salute as the President stomps off
His  now approaches
The President has put a private train at your disposal
Engine number five, track six
(holds out a wrapped box) Mr
Gordon, the item you requested
Gordon takes the box, hurries to catch up with West
38
-                                           38 West and Gordon, walking toward the hitching post
West is so beside himself he can barely untie his high-voltage stud
He glowers at Gordon who goes over to where
- - Is parked on the other side of a bush
It has the customary big wheel in the front, little wheel in the back
(Hidden from sight is a motor on the front tire
Dual manifolds that sling under the rider's legs
) West shakes his head in disgust
Figures
call it the Bi-axle Nitro- Combust

38   :                                                  38 Save it
've gotta train to catch
West swings into the saddle
He looks at the wild  under him, then down at Gordon attaching the box onto the seat of his Nitro-whatever
(snaps off a smug salute) Yee-haaa
West spurs his horse and leaves Gordon in the proverbial cloud of dust
Although West's intentions are clear, for some reason, Gordon's in no particular hurry
He sighs, climbs on the bike, takes out a hankie and cleans a pair of goggles
Then, finally ready
Avant
An    and Gordon rockets forward
(Yep, Artemus has invented the first motorcycle
) Fiery exhaust blasts out of the manifolds as the bike propels him down the street at about 60 mph right past
who both look over in wide-eyed shock
The horse rears as Gordon  by -- leaving them in a cloud of internal combustion
39
-   -             39 From in front, as it   us
Sitting up in the spanking new steam engine (No
5) is a white-haired Coleman
The Wanderer is his pride and joy
Coleman pushes the throttle forward and the us
followed by a tender, and two gleaming passenger cars
Then comes West  past in a desperate effort to catch up
() 25
39   :                                                      39 - riding like hell
Getting the last ounce of speed out of his well-lathered steed, he finally pulls alongside the rear passenger car
He looks up
In the window, we see Gordon engrossed in what he's doing
which appears to be sewing
Stop this train
You hear me
If Gordon hears him, he pretends not to
He just casually makes the next stitch
West's horse has had it
They're losing ground to the train
At the last second, West leans over at full gallop and grabs a handle on the side of the train
He swings out of the saddle, hanging on for dear life, blowing in the breeze like laundry
Finally, his boot finds a small metal plate to put its weight on
Just as West stands safely on it
whoosh
He flies up in the air and drops through a sliding partition in the roof

-   -                                 40 The car is like a classy Victorian men's club
Bar stocked with crystal decanters, a pool table, decorative pistols on the wall, books, etc
Gordon, seated in a club chair, looks over as West falls from the ceiling into a seat
He's hot, dusty and very pissed off
He glowers at Gordon murderously
(calmly) Thanks for dropping in
Forget the bikes, the beards, the fake boobies
Put down the needlepoint and let's settle this like men
He takes off jacket, starts rolling up his sleeves
Gordon remains remarkably cool, continues sewing
As a matter of clarification, this isn't needlepoint
This is
He shows him some real needlepoint
() 26
40   :                                                      40 Right now, 'm putting the final touches on a new invention of my creation
call it
The Impermeable
It's a vest that, when worn under the clothing, can stop any modern bullet fired even at close range
West draws his gun, aims it at Gordon's stomach and cocks the trigger
Really
Gordon quickly pulls the vest away from his stomach
But it hasn't been really tested empirically yet
Get up
West takes off his guns and puts them on the table
(yawn, yawn) Guns
find them so primitive and unnecessary
if one has done one's proper planning
Yeah
How do you feel about a fist
Gordon puts down The Impermeable, stands with a weary sigh
must tell you, Mr
West, 've always felt that allowing a situation to degenerate into physical violence is a failure on my part
Well then, 'Mr
' Gordon, you failed
Whap
West unleashes a lightning punch that drives Gordon across the train car
He dabs at his bloody lip
() 27
40   :    (2)                                              40 'm sorry, Mr
West, you brought this on yourself
Then to West's utter amazement, Gordon puts his hands together as if praying while at the same time, crooking his right leg stork-like
Is this some kind of martial art
Then, he bends at the waist, and like a ballet dancer, extends his leg out to the wall and flips a switch
It immediately triggers a leather hammer to swing down from the ceiling
It whacks West on the side of the head, and sends him spinning back onto the pool table
- shakes it off and is about to attack again
Gordon calmly pokes a hidden button
Suddenly the pool table revolves
West is gone
love this train
41
-                                  41 West, eyes wide, is clinging on for dear life, staring at the ties racing by, inches from his face
42
-   -                             42 Gordon pours a fine Bordeaux, speaks loudly toward floor
The President asked for my suggestions on how to make the Wanderer both comfortable and functional
As he swishes the wine in his mouth
43
-  ( )                          43 West reaches up to get a handhold in the myriad of tubes and wires on the underside of the car
As he rips one tube out of the undercarriage

44
-   -                                44 Gordon has just settled into the club chair, puts his wine down on the table
And while you're down there, you may want to avail yourself of my Sub-carriage Inter-rail Egressor
Suddenly   out of the arms of the chair, pinning Gordon's wrists
Before he knows what hit him, the floor opens and the club chair disappears
45
-                                       45 Gordon appears upside down in the chair, chagrined at his predicament
West looks from the escape trolley Gordon was talking about back to his partner
Only one doin' any 'egressin' is gonna be you
(wide-eyed) Perhaps the President was right about us putting aside our petty differences
(recites above the ) 'The opposite is beneficial, from things that differ comes the fairest attunement
' Aristotle
Suddenly they flip    and back into the car, shocked to find themselves facing
46
-   -                                46 Coleman's a scowling, grizzled old man in a coal-stained suit
He's got a fire in his eye, brown spittle in the corner of his mouth where a cigarette butt lives permanently, and a large copper pot in his hand
Knock each other about all ya please, but harm my train and 'll douse ya like dogs
He threatens them with the pot of steaming liquid
Now, for the first time, Gordon really looks troubled

West looks from the head to the open box
That's a man's head
Gordon holds up a strange, circular metallic object
And this magnetic collar was around it when his body was discovered
Haven't figured that one out yet
But West is still staring in disbelief at the head
That's a man's head
Gordon starts fiddling with a lantern positioned behind the head

a dying person's last conscious image is burned into the back of the eyeball like a photograph
Perhaps there's a clue there
Excited, Gordon turns on the lantern attached to the back of his head
Beams of light are coming through his eyeballs, creating a blurry color image on the wall
Morton's last image
That's a man's head
West turns his head sideways to try to view the inverted image projected on the wall
Gordon realizes the problem
Ah
The refraction of the lenses causes the image to appear upside down

It's right side up, but still blurry

It's a man who has a tiny Victrola horn for an ear
He's holding a bloody metal boomerang
It's McGrath

Why, y'all look like you've seen a ghost
It's me, dear friends, alive and kicking
Well, alive, anyway
As he giggles, the distaff corps surround him and remove the Lincoln paraphernalia
Then step aside, revealing
- is half a man
Literally
Cut off at the waist and mounted on a wheelchair platform that is powered by an engine, he is a man bereft of tuchus, kishkes and everything else in that vicinity that makes life interesting

56   :    (2)                                               56 (chuckles) We may've lost the war, but heaven knows
we haven't lost our sense of humor
Dr
Loveless looks down at himself, smoothes half of his Fritz Lang Metropolis-style suit
His face turns dark as he surveys the crowd
Not even when we've lost a lung
a spleen
a bladder
two legs
thirty-five feet of small intestine and our ability to reproduce
(like a preacher) All in the name of the South
(then quietly) do we lose our sense of humor
You can hear a pin drop
Loveless turns to the foreign dignitaries
owe a deep debt of gratitude to my friends across the sea for their comfort and
succor
He suddenly seems distracted by the comely beauties that surround him
Then abruptly, manically
So
Mi casa es su casa
Ma maison est a vous
Let the party begin
Loveless signals to the quartets to resume playing
Miss East leans down and whispers in his ear
Loveless looks in West's direction
Now Loveless wheels over to West
West isn't hiding
He's cocky in the face of rolling danger
Mr
West, how nice of you to join us tonight
and add color to these monochromatic proceedings
West keeps a lid on his temper
Two can play at this game

56   :    (3)                                               56 Well, when a man comes back from the dead, it's an occasion to stand and be counted
Loveless smiles slightly
Miss East informs me that you were expecting to meet General McGrath here
knew him years ago
but haven't seen him in a coon's age
bet a man like yourself would find it difficult to keep in touch with even half the people you know
Danger flickers in Loveless's eyes
He looks to Miss East
Perhaps the lovely Miss East will keep you from being a slave to your disappointment
Well, you know beautiful women
they encourage you one second, cut the legs out from under you the next
Loveless's face drops
He is no longer amused
Miss East winks at West, then accompanies Loveless in the direction of the study where
57
-   -                    57 General McGrath waits impatiently
He takes two champagnes off a passing tray, guzzles them, then wipes his mouth on Dolly Madison's bustle
As his eyes sweep the room
- He ducks behind a mountain man carrying the French tricolor
When Loveless and General McGrath disappear into the study and close the door, West eases after them
He pauses as he passes the "Soiled Dove," leans into her big bouffant
He regards a stained-glass window patterned with a spider over her shoulder
() 40
57   :                                                     57 Hey, honey
see a big ole spider up on the wall
Hope it doesn't drop down your pretty dress
As the Soiled Dove jumps a little, West continues over to the study door
Now the Soiled Dove turns, and we see the scared/confused expression
Maybe it's because she is not Artemus
-  - He's the mountain man in the fringe jacket
And right now he's shaking his head as he watches West resort to a decidedly low-tech surveillance method of Loveless's study
Peeking through the keyhole
So 18th Century
58
-  - '               58 - McGrath paces in front of Loveless's desk
McGRATH Dr
Loveless, my men are ready to go to war with no weapons to fight
Ever since the nitro and the guns were destroyed at Fat- Can's, lice and demoralization have set in
Your men will have their weapons tonight
And my promise that they will be part of the greatest military victory of this century
McGrath's face relaxes into a pyorrheic grin
McGRATH Oh, you're a pip, sir
'd follow you into the maw of Cerberus himself
Loveless takes pencil in hand and draws a map on the desk
() 41
58   :                                                     58 And so you shall
(makes an ) Have your men here at
10 o'clock tonight
Loveless wheels his chair toward the door with McGrath behind him folding up the map
59
-   -  -            59 ducks out of the way as Loveless and McGrath emerge from the study
As they disappear into the throng of well- wishers, West takes a thin lock-pick out of his hat band
It takes him a moment or two, but the  finally Then West slips inside, apparently undetected -- except by an unimpressed Gordon
60
-  -  -                    60 moves quickly to the desk past walls filled with oil portraits of various Loveless relatives
The one behind the desk is in the style of Gainsborough
Loveless uncle is standing on a windswept grouse moor, two English setters by his side, a Holland and Holland double held in the crook of his arm
West turns his attention to the desk blotter
There's a faint imprint where Loveless drew the map
West takes his penknife and a pencil -- grates some graphite into the depressions
He's just about to do a rubbing on a piece of paper when
someone swipes it out of his hand
Hands on hips, she gives him a "naughty, naughty" look
said to meet me in the foyer
Oh, the foy-aay
Sorry, 've never been much good at French
But instead of scolding him further, Miss East plants an over-heated kiss on him
Tongues are involved
As they break, she gives a little nod of approval
Au contraire

60   :                                                     60 She pushes him down into Dr
Loveless's chair
So let's see, Mr
West
are you a dangerous spy of some sort
Or just a handsome cowboy who likes to
poke around
Um
that second one
She starts to undo the buttons of his trousers
But West has a job to do
Well, maybe he can do two jobs at once
61
-  -  -   -           61 is being the perfect party guest, moving through the crowd chit-chatting with this person and that (in French, Spanish, German) when he sees something of interest
Munitia and Lippenreider come out of an upstairs bedroom, lock it behind them
Hmmm
What's in there
As he starts upstairs, Amazonia appears, blocking his way
Howdy there
big sturdy gal
Yer dance card full
Amazonia stares at him, then spiels off a couple lines in a foreign language that makes Gordon's eyes widen
He understands what she said and it's not flattering
Gordon moves off in a shock
62
-  -    -           62 are locked in a passionate embrace
West manages to position her nearly-naked rear end over the graphite powder
Very carefully, he stands, pushing her buttocks onto the desk and then rolling her off
The imprint on her left cheek is perfect
But unfortunately, it's backwards
- Damn
He lets Miss East concentrate on what she's doing, which from the

62   :                                                     62 West spies a mirror on the other side of the room and raises her ass up into position so he can see the corrected reflection
- It clearly shows the meeting place to be Malheureux Point, northeast of New Orleans
But the mirror reflects something else of interest
63
-  -  -                63 The painting behind him has come to life
The Loveless in the painting swings a real shotgun around and is pointing it at the back of West's head
- suddenly contorts his upper torso just as an rips the back of the chair where his head would have been
He draws and  the would-be assassin, who falls out of the painting, dead
West turns to see
surprised look on her face
hole in her forehead
He lowers her head gently to the ground, regards her map-imprinted rear end
Thanks for helpin' me get to the bottom of this case
64
-   -  -            64 emerges just as a Kentucky reel starts up
He weaves his way through the dance floor and spots the Soiled Dove look-alike out on the floor
West reluctantly straightens his shoulders and cuts in
This bold move gets some looks of disapproval from the pecan pie crowd
dancing
Both look straight ahead, not at each other
West so as not to attract any more attention
His partner because she's scared shitless of this strange Negro who keeps hounding her

64   :                                                      64 Real impressed the way you got the dance floor staked out
Maybe one of your missin' scientists'll cut in
(dip) Thought you should know that while you were trying to decide what shoes to wear tonight
(twirl) found that our host, Dr
Loveless
West looks over to where Loveless is leading a contingent of foreigners out a side exit
is meeting McGrath and his troops at Malheureux Point in an hour
(bends her back) So you enjoy the party
'm gonna go save the Republic
The Soiled Dove look-alike is speechless
Before he goes, West leans in, smirks
But  will say, good work on your bladders tonight
they're damn perky
And just to dig the grave deeper, West lays hands on them and gives them a little squeeze
This immediately elicits a scream and a slap in the face that shocks the bejesus out of the black cowboy
And he's not the only one
staring at him
We know what they're thinking, but the Mountain Man behind West says it for everyone
/ Hang him
And with that, Gordon opens his deerskin jacket to reveal his own rope, which he throws to the mob
West looks back at the character in amazement
That's Gordon
Before West can say or do anything, guns are at his temple, and he's swept out of the room

In the hubbub of everyone rushing out for the hanging, Gordon heads up the unguarded stairs to the locked room
As he pulls out his high tech auto-wind lock-pick and quickly gains entrance to the door
65
-  -                        65 Hand-held torches illuminate
The rope is tossed over a lamp post
where one of the mob, dressed as , is binding West's hands behind his back
Looks like we're gonna have to teach y'all a little lesson on how to behave in polite society
Don't grab a white lady's boobies at the big redneck dance
Is that the lesson
Well,  learned it
Don't scratch your head with the shrimp fork
got that one too
So whaddaya say we call this off

And it sure ain't scientists
Beside the bed, locked in an iron disco-like cage, is Rita, still wearing her scanty outfit
Gordon squints at her, gives a charming smile
feel as if we know each other from someplace
Try again, buster
She takes a breath as if she's going to start screaming
Gordon quickly holds up a hand

While  realize look like something straight out of James Fenimore Cooper
mean you no harm
My name is Artemus Gordon
And you look like you're in trouble
(dryly) Really
To Rita's amazement, Gordon opens his jacket and unbuttons his vest to reveal
a complete miniature tool shop
Quickly he pulls out a thin cable and attaches it to a tiny wheel on the spur of one of his boots
'm Rita
was hired here as an entertainer
Not that 'm complaining, but what are you doin' in here
(looking up miles of leg) Looking for some missing scientists
not that 'm complaining
Gordon unsnaps the sole of his shoe
It becomes a pedal that operates the wheels' rotation
Now he removes a bit and handle from his vest and attaches the cable
Starts to pump his foot
It's a foot-powered drill

With the noose dangling in front of his nose, West addresses the crowd
Can  have everyone's attention please

First, the whole drumming on the boobies thing
In my native land, Africa, my ancestors used drums to communicate between villages
'm sure y'all can see that this young girl here can communicate all the way down to Baton Rouge
Hell, on a clear day, we might even get Galveston

That redneck comment

You know, some of my best friends are whiskey-guzzling, pot-bellied rednecks just like y'all here

Hell, who wouldn't want somebody to run around for them doing chores
Are you going to get your big, fat, lazy ass out of bed every morning and pick your own damn cotton

Come on, back inside

Okay

As West searches desperately for signs of rescue by his "partner," suddenly the wagon lurches forward

and stretches
- ' As they slowly touch the ground
Nobody is more confused than West
How the fuck did that happen
But before anybody can figure out Gordon's trick rope, speak of the devil
(
) Hey-yaa
The crowd turns with alarm to see
Nostrils flared and wild-eyed, are having their rumps snapped by Gordon's reins
Rita holds on for dear life as the mad Mountain Man drives the carriage at full speed right into the crowd -- scattering them
He sees his opportunity for rescue, puts a foot into the back of George Washington, grabs his gun, and somersaults into the air
- lands squarely in the back
And just as the rope starts to stretch around his neck again, Gordon whirls around with a Bowie knife and cuts it

West responds with an amazing display of - marksmanship, picking off half a dozen of Loveless's shooters, even while the carriage bumps wildly on its getaway

who doesn't seem to realize that my carefully planned diversion gave me the opportunity to search for the missing scientists
Now West notices the half-dressed bombshell in the carriage
Scientist, huh
This is Rita
found her locked in a cage in Loveless's bedroom
She's an entertainer
Um, maybe  haven't been quite honest about that
My name is Rita Escobar
came to find Guillermo Escobar, the scientist, my

Gordon starts singing the song
West rolls his eyes, cuts off the chit-chat
Look, Rita, 'm sorry you had the wrong agent working on your case
When  find your father  promise 'll send him back safely
And with that
West suddenly leaps over Rita -- lands on the back of one of the horses
He grabs a handful of mane, leans over and unclips the harness
And with a kick in the ribs, West is off at a gallop -- leaving Gordon, one remaining horse and an awed Rita behind to chew his dust
He's impulsive, James

One of them is holding a little in his arms,  at something in the dark
General McGrath stands at the railing, uncharacteristically pensive
Loveless rolls over, hands him a glass of champagne
Well, General, it's been a long journey from New Liberty
McGrath visibly winces at the sound of it

Oh, you mean the stomach-churning carnage that earned you your unfortunate nom de guerre

But believe me, those men are not dying senselessly

They all follow the sound to find

-  -                           76 General McGrath, washed up on the shore
West looks down at him
Now Rita, still looking green around the gills, rejoins the party
That's when  vowed to follow McGrath to the end of the earth
As grey as four-day-old mullet, McGrath manages a smile for his relentless pursuer
McGRATH (barely audible) What's the matter, West
Thought you'd be happy to find me
like this
was hoping to kill you myself
That's a nice way to talk to people
McGRATH You'll have to live with it
As 've lived with the blame for New Liberty
McGrath fades out
West grabs him and shakes him
What do you mean
McGRATH (opens eyes) It was Loveless
his plan
He operated the killing machine there
Smarter now
left it to others here
With the meaning of it all sinking in, West grabs McGrath by the collar and pulls him toward him
Where is he
Where did he go

Aye, sir

It is on the way
On the way to Utah where our President happens to be

Seems a bit ungracious
Possibly perilous
Look, all that would happen would be she'd get in our way and 'd probably wind up gettin' in the saddle with her
Funny that you say that
Because thought she was more interested in me

Suddenly there's a  and Rita falls through the ceiling and plops in the chair just like West did earlier

Puts it away as Gordon muses about her anatomy

or a Raphael
Rita raises an eyebrow, looks to the galley as Gordon comes out with a platter of food
He still doesn't see her there
especially her breasts
Did you notice the way one of them
(cups his hands) Both of them actually
to say nothing of her buttocks
Gordon turns and looks into the car
Finally sees her
Changes gears without missing a beat
and the group of foreign ministers at Loveless's party
What were they doing there
Gordon gestures for West to join him at the pool table
Rita immediately goes for the food

How could you possibly help us
Well,  heard you talking about why all those foreign guys were at Loveless's party
You want me to tell you

Something about a real bad deal in Louisiana on purpose
The Louisiana Purchase

Gordon, this is crazy

Nothing but sagebrush and animal skulls out there
Rita comes up close to Jim, fire in her big, brown eyes
Please, Jim
My father's the only family 've got
What am supposed to do
Sit home and wait for news he's been killed
Or go do something
What would you do, Jim
That gets the man of action where he lives
Look,  got nothing against you, Rita
It's just that
What's going to happen when we catch up to Loveless
with you on the train
She grabs West's hand
know you'd never let him take me back
've seen you shoot
West kinda melts a little
This girl does have her charms
Gordon, a little jealous, puffs his chest out
assure you, Rita, an attack by Loveless would be an exercise in futility

Completely armor- plated
Artemus raps his knuckles on the wall making a sound
Then he smugly demonstrates that the light fixture is actually a Gatling gun
An attacker would find the lighting inside extremely
unflattering
Finally he moves to the billiard table, while Rita nods and keeps eating
And if, by some inconceivable fluke, they did manage to gain entrance
(rolls billiard ball into bumper) An innocent billiard ball this way

a sleeping gas bomb
Effective in under three seconds
Gordon unclicks it, triumphantly rolls it into a pocket
So rest assured, Rita
you are completely safe within these walls
West snorts at his obvious play for Rita's attentions
don't know about you, ma'am, but know 'll be sleeping a whole lot better tonight

Speaking of sleeping, 'm pretty tired

(as West shoots him a look) Then perhaps you could explain what they're doing behind us
As West looks out the back too

Now to the left of them
The Wanderer rocks precariously from wheel to wheel, throwing a screaming Rita back and forth between West and Gordon
They couldn't fire the cannon at us from in front

He slides his back on top of it -- then lowers it onto the track
Little wheels fit on the inside of the track
Once coupled, West releases the cable and he shoots backwards --

He lies flat as the death over him
At the last second, he lassos the rope around the rear axle
It slows him for a beat
then stretches
He's gotten Gordon's trick rope
We see his silent scream -- "Artemus

past the tank/train
Finally, West slides back underneath and manages to grab hold of their caboose

Wait,  have an auxiliary tool kit
Gordon peels back the top of his boot revealing it
But it's too late
West has jumped over the fence
Then he hops back inside it
He holds his hands out to Gordon
See
Nothing happened
West grabs Gordon by the back of his vest and yanks him over the fence
Now they hear a slight  in the air and it's not a bee
- comes whipping over the corn straight for West's head
In a split second, he ducks and the disc cuts the tops of the corn off and banks around for a new attack
Oh, really
Now both of them step over the fenced perimeter and start running like hell through the cornfield
Is it too late to take it off of me now

She smiles nervously at Loveless, who's being fawned-over by his women

Rita jumps as the champagne
'm just a wee bit curious as to how you managed to wind up with them

sure that they could find you

they'd lead me back to

West and Gordon dive to the ground
the discs just missing them
West stands to run again
We see the back of his head's been buzzed

West sees a gully fifty yards ahead of them
Head for that gully

Gordon zags out the other

All right, Gordon, what's your plan
How are you gonna get this damn thing off my neck

Excuse me
Isn't that why you're here
'Cause you're the master of, you know, mechanical stuff

Oh,  see
Now 'm the master of
'mechanical stuff

But no
Gordon starts moving towards West, who is forced to back up -- looking a tad nervous for the first time in the movie
-- That wouldn't have been any fun for a certain somebody, and won't mention any names -- Jim West
-- who decided to take me on a bracing romp through a cornfield and play a fanciful game of hide and seek with serrated, spinning death discs, while our only mode of transportation is in the hands of a sadistic madman with weapons of mass destruction, who kidnapped Rita, and is on his way to kill our President and take over the country

First, Gordon -- trying to get some leverage -- puts his foot in West's crotch and pulls the boot

Apologies, apologies
Gordon struggles to free the writhing West from the boot (attached to Gordon's collar)

His collar is sucked into Gordon's belt buckle

Well, Gordon
was this part of your plan
'm by your side, sir
That's what's important
Now Munitia hits a lever and they're hoisted up off the ground
They only get a couple of feet when
West shoots the mechanism and it jerks to a stop
All eyes turn to the source of the sharpshooting
164
-   -                     164 West has almost reached the lowest deck
Now all the firepower of the Tarantula is trained on him

Munitia and several other goons on lower decks   on West, too

West screams in pain and falls

Bonjour, buenas tardes and good day
Great glorious day
day of healing for the wrongs that have been done to us all

172   :                                                     172 Framed by a large flag featuring the spider emblem, he looks out from center stage of a Greek theater at the crowd of foreign dignitaries seated around him
Oh, how long have we waited
- , dressed in tight Fascist-brown tankwear, rise from their seats and applaud
The only people not applauding are a row of haggard, bearded scientists and the manacled prisoners Gordon (sans disguise), Rita, Grant and Coleman
(looks to Englishman) 1776, wasn't it, old bean
Most expensive cup o' tea in history
As the Englishman dignitary nods soberly
173
-                                    173 West's body hasn't moved
The only change is that now a line of ants crawls across his face
We watch, hoping for a twitch, something
But there is none
The ants march over lifeless eyes, swarm onto the bloody cut on his head
If we're not convinced he's dead
- circles lower, finally landing right by West's head
As the hideous carrion-eater leans over West's face
- ' shadow falls across them
But instead of the pecking red beak, a human hand appears  the
Brushes the ants away
We hear an   over
Then finally
West's eyelids flutter open

The healer who can turn himself into a bird

Hey, it's okay
As he makes a mental note to always be kind to animals

(to the Mexicans) Remember the Alamo indeed
(humbly to crowd) Today 'm proud to be able to sit before you and tell you the wrongs will be righted
the past made present
the United, divided
To thunderous applause
Loveless signals for the flag to be pulled down, revealing
" - " There have been some significant internal changes which Loveless now describes
The delegation from each country stands when they hear their name
Great Britain gets back the thirteen original colonies
minus Manhattan
(off applause) Florida and the Fountain of Youth go back to Spain

Finally Loveless taps Colorado, Kansas, Utah and Nevada -- now labelled as "Loveless Land
" Smiles impishly
And a tiny piece for me to retire on
There's appreciative laughter
175
-   -  -                     175 stumbles in and looks around discouraged
The place has been ransacked
The gun cabinets are empty, the Gatling lamp removed
All that's left is Gordon's Nitro-cycle and his wardrobe full of dresses
West tries every secret hiding place
Nothing
Finally he finds Gordon's belt buckle/derringer
He opens the breech
Only one dinky bullet
He throws down the belt in disgust
176
'  -  -  -            176 sits behind a desk that has been brought to center stage
Loveless unrolls a document, signs his half of it
My partner nations insist that we make this as legal as possible
Personally,  like the symmetry of it
After all wasn't it you who made us sign a surrender at Appomattox
Loveless snaps his fingers
Amazonia drags Grant out of his seat and sticks a pen in his manacled hands
Never will  sign that paper, never will the United States ever surrender
() 96
176   :                                                     176 Well, sir, we're at loggerheads then, aren't we
And  suppose the threat of death to someone with your valorous war record, would mean nothing
Grant sets his jaw intractably
He's right about that
so, if you still refuse to sign this surrender
we'll start by shooting your man, Gordon
Loveless whirls, nods to Amazonia who drags the President back to his seat, pulls Gordon out of his
Rita can't help her outburst
Artemus
Artemus smiles at her, extremely brave under the circumstances
He whispers to Rita and the President
(tugs at his vest) Don't worry, 'm wearing the Impermeable
Rita turns to Grant
What the hell is that
Gordon has no time to explain as Amazonia hauls him up on the stage
As Munitia aims her rifle
Gordon holds up a finger
If  may have one request
it's that she aim at my heart
which has loved this great country so much
(considers for a moment) Shoot him in the head
Great
Munitia cocks her rifle, then just as Loveless holds his hands up for the signal to fire
the lights dim

'  -  -                        177 candle-powered spotlight swings across the stage and illuminates
a deep-throated, bluesy black who starts singing the popular cathouse song, "Hangtown Gals
" (singing) 'Ohhh
Hangtown gals are plump and rosy
' Loveless wheels his chair around to take a gander and forgets Gordon's execution instantly
And why not
She's young and beautiful in a RuPaul sort of way
About six feet tall, wearing the blue sequined number Gordon had in his dressing room
Accessorized with black mesh stockings, big feather boa, silver-buckled belt, lots of frilly petticoats for those can-can moves
(singing) 'Hair in ringlets, mighty cozy
' She winds her finger around her ringlets and sticks out her derriere to the crowd
They stare, mouths agape at this piece of ass worthy of Othello
- Intrigued
Well, maybe more than intrigued
new girl
What a nice surprise
He motions to hold up Gordon's execution, rolls to her
'Painted cheeks and frilly corsets
' (bends over showing her undergarment) Touch them
' Loveless hears this as an invitation, reaches out with his hand and whap
She slaps him right in the face
'
And they'll sting like hornets

Loveless, a red handprint on his face, is a little nonplussed
Amazonia moves in threateningly, but Loveless stops her, starts to laugh
(making her name up on the spot) Ebonia
Why are you so cruel to me
Ebonia has escaped a head-cutting neck bracelet
But she probably shouldn't be teasing a man who's having "ghost aches" in certain amputated places
- waiting to be executed
Something's not quite kosher about her for Gordon
(musing to himself) have a dress like that
- Now with the crowd singing along, she pulls out all the stops
Her gestures and dance moves become more exaggerated, she's in the thrall of her audience
(singing) 'Hangtown gals are lovely creatures Think they'll marry Mormon preachers
' She sashays over to the French dignitary, pulls his monocle out of his eye and blows hot breath on it, steaming it up
As she pops it back on his face
(singing) 'Heads thrown back to show their features
' Now she puts her cheek next to Rita as if matching their relative beauty while picking the pocket of Lippenreider
Rita pushes her away disgustedly but not before Ebonia hands Coleman the keys to the cuffs
Coleman looks from the keys to Ebonia
He just caught on

Then Ebonia prances on stage to Gordon, cuddles up to him
Gordon looks at the big beautiful black woman with a mixture of amusement and relief
Of course, it's his "'d rather be dead" partner, Jim West
(singing) Ha
Ha
Hangtown girls
Not to sound ungrateful, but you're a little over the top
(sings) Ha
Ha
Ha
West/Ebonia wraps the feather boa around Gordon's neck -- hiding the derringer in the palm of his hand
Gordon looks worried
What's he going to do with a gun
As he tucks it up his sleeve
Let me warn you about that dress
Gotta go
Big finish
(belts it out) 'Ha, ha, ha
Hangtown gals
' An immediate standing ovation
The diversion allows Coleman to unlock both Grant's and Rita's shackles
Grant looks at the keys
Where'd those come from

Their eyes practically pop out of their heads

Serves you right for staring at them
As she relieves the charred goon of his keys
Loveless turns to the rest of his goons
Kill him

Finally getting it, they rush Ebonia
Even his 4th of July breasts aren't a match for them
Desperate, West reaches way down in his undergarments to retrieve one of Gordon's billiard balls
He depresses the number and rolls it at the guards
Was that the eight ball
Mmm-hmm
Gordon grabs West and Rita, pulls them behind the bar

Both West and Gordon look after her with yearning as three goons charge them
Coleman, amazed at their torpor, quickly grabs a  from the incinerated goon and
Three goons drop
Gordon and West exchange looks
Not bad for an emphysemic old engineer
Special Marshal
President thought you needed some lookin' after
Speaking of the President
he's grabbed a dead goon's , and is   a pretty good field of himself
Suddenly, he gets a tap on the shoulder from behind
It's Amazonia
Whap, she sends a right to his chin knocking him out
She throws him over her shoulder and carries him away

'  -  -   -            179 As fire engulfs the place, Loveless has no choice but to retreat
for now

As Amazonia swings the door closed, the foreign dignitaries  on the door begging for admittance

Something
West is watching the Tarantula, turns to calm him
No, Arte
Right now, we need a plan
Gordon tries to compose himself
That flyin' machine idea of yours

or could you build it

In the b

, we hear Gordon
(
) Now Bernoulli's Principle states that the air flowing over a bird's wings
is moving at a lower pressure than the pressure below the wing
that's called 'lift
' Course, it's just a theory
it's never been tested
- ' It depicts a wing cutting through the air
Arrows indicating airflow
Circular lines indicating "life
" Only one problem, it's upside down
Gordon remedies that
Looks sheepishly to West who, like him, is wearing a leather flight jacket and goggles
You're not makin' me feel any better
Now they attach the wing to the frame -- which is connected to the Nitro-cycle
Coleman, his ever-present cigarette dangling from his mouth, readies bombs from the gunpowder of cartridges and Gordon's design
They look like Flash Gordon's spaceship
He passes them out
Here's a coupla bon voyage presents
Coleman
Must you smoke when handling explosives
Gordon grabs them away from him and sits in the saddle of the Nitro-cycle
West looks at Coleman apologetically as he stuffs the bombs into his jacket
He's just a little nervous 'cause no one's ever flown before
West is barely on the back when Gordon kicks it over and they

Gordon is nervous at the wheel
West gives him an encouraging pat
Avant
Avant
But their speed is not enough to get them airborne
We're not getting enough lift
We need more speed
Then in an uncharacteristic move by Gordon, he turns the machine around and heads for the cliff
Hey, uh
that's the cliff over there, you know
He guns the accelerator
Yes,  do know
And with that, the Nitro-cycle goes off the cliff
It disappears for the count of five
Then suddenly it swoops up and
They're flying

It worked

Mr
President, 'll ask you once again
Sign the surrender or decimate this town
You've had my answer
Loveless's face darkens as Amazonia hands him a tray of cotton balls
(as he puts in earplugs) find the sound of people screaming while they get blown to smithereens, ruins the ear for music
Don't you
He offers them to the President
Grant swats them away
Commence firing
And with that the Tarantula   on the town
There's a lot of stomping and smashing, too

Gordon, lost in the joy of flight, turns to West who is more of a white-knuckler

' Flight depends on lift, which must be calibrated to the angle of descent
Shut up and go down there, will ya
West reaches up, shoves the make-shift joystick forward
As the wasp plummets toward the bridge of the Tarantula and Gordon strains to keep control

Well, Mr

Why not swear an oath of loyalty to me
and forego your executions
Why not
Well,  guess maybe 'd rather see what happens when stuff your ass into that cannon up there and fertilize the landscape
Uh, Jim,  think a polite 'no' would suffice
Loveless taps a button on his chair and the floor opens up beneath West
He goes crashing down a story
Loveless sics Amazonia on Gordon and Grant and proceeds down the ramp to the level below

West reveals the less impressive four inch stiletto in his boot
Knife Guy responds by producing another blade from his other cuff
But you've got two of those

No time for talk
Knife Guy does a bad-ass series of moves
The blades criss-crossing one another at blinding speed
West, unimpressed, retorts with a lame shake of his stiletto and boot
And the fight begins
Knife Guy attacks
West narrowly escapes each thrust of the knife, and attempts a kick to the groin
but comes up short -- The stiletto collides with one of the blades and snaps like a carrot
His only weapon

West rolls onto the railing to avoid the attack
Sparks fly as the Knife Guy tries to slice and dice West but misses each time, hitting the metal railing instead
West rolls to the floor, sucking air
Knife Guy lands a kick to West's ribs

just showed up
He swings his wrench at West's head
West ducks but gets kicked in the back

) West finally gets a kick in -- it does a moderate amount of damage
Wrench Guy appears and swings his huge wrench at West's head
West escapes it, barely
Knife Guy thrusts a side-kick at West's chest, but West catches his foot, holds on for dear life

Looking for a way out, but
no luck
Shovel Guy attacks
West ducks and the shovel connects squarely with Knife Guy's blades
West crouches and throws two simultaneous punches, each connecting with a set of jewels
West stands, follows it up with a right cross and left hook and these two jokers wind up
Now
the Wrench Guy is on his feet and he's pissed
He attacks West, lands a solid kick to the chest and West flies backward toward a
which he grabs
He scales the gears, gets a solid grip, then swings, a huge arc across the room, gaining momentum, and kicks Shovel Guy and Wrench Guy at the same time
Off their feet they go, slamming onto the metal floor
West lands
Knife Guy attacks
West uses the chain to block the blades which are flying at him, left and right
Sparks fly
West manages to wrap the chain around one of the knives, locks it down, and heaves it into the gears
the blade snaps
No more Mister Knife guy
West drops a stiff right-cross on the chin of the Knife Guy
wobbles his legs a bit
But before West can follow up
to replace the broken one
It stops about a half-an-inch from West's nose
struggle ensues, but West manages to wrap the chain around Knife Guy's neck and string him up
West throws a kick to his back
Knife Guy, hanging by his neck, flies through the belly
(the chain is on a track)
and out of the mouth of the beast, down into the abyss, chain and all
Shovel Guy springs to his feet and swings on West
West grabs the shovel and they struggle for possession

But West uses the shovel to deflect the swing- ing wrench
sparks fly
West gains sole possession of the shovel and mule-kicks Shovel Guy
West spins just in time to land a crippling blow to Wrench Guy's back
Shovel Guy grabs the shovel
He and West tug-o'-war again
West ducks under the shovel and moves back-to-front with him
West elbows him in the ribs
He responds by putting West in a choke hold
West swings the shovel wildly but hits his target -- shovel Guy's head
West steps back, gets his footing and, for good measure, whacks him in the back
Wrench Guy attacks
West defends himself with the shovel and lands a stiff kick to his stomach
Wrench Guy goes down
West turns, hits Shovel Guy in the chest with the shovel and he goes down
Wrench Guy sneaks up on West from behind and swings at his head
West, on instinct, lifts the shovel and blocks the deadly blow at the last second
West has now found his rhythm
He swings and shovel and connects with
first, the foot, then the chin, and last but not least, the head -- West drops the shovel and, World Wrestling Federation style, picks him up and hurls him into the space between the gears
We won't see him anymore
West pivots and
Shovel Guy plants a neat little roundhouse kick squarely on West's jaw
West backs up and catches another in the stomach
Then
Shovel Guy really shows what he's made of
He does a series of jump-kicks, round-houses and fan- kicks into the air
All perfectly timed, all deadly
learned that from a Chinaman
West, without missing a beat, steps on the shovel, which flips into his hand and --
-- lands a clean one right on the top of Shovel Guy's melon
just made that up

Don't forget your shovel
West casts the shovel out into the abyss
(upward) Is that all you got for me, Loveless
West, exhausted, turns and sees
all seven feet of him
The top of his head is a metal plate
Extending downward, encircling his eyes
West soaks him in, sighs
Uh,  just threw my shovel out
So this really isn't fair
If you don't mind, 'd like to
West, at lightning speed, throws a sucker-punch/spin- ning back-fist to Metal Head's jaw
That one really hurt
West's hand, that is
Metal Head isn't fazed a bit
West throws another shot, this time to the gut
Then a kick to the groin
(incredulous) Noooo
Metal Head has had enough
He effortlessly picks West up by his lapels and flings him across the room
West tumbles, and lands right next to
He picks it up and starts swinging
shot to the body Then another
Then another
Metal Head lurches forward, absorbing each blow with not so much as a twitch of the eye
West furries
nothing
He goes for the head
nothing
West is out of time
He's been backed up as far as he can go
His heels are dangling over the mouth of the beast, a thousand feet above the rocky cliff

West braces himself
Urrrrrrrrrrggggghhh
West side-steps and Metal Head falls face first into the open air

Loveless is about to roll over him
He jumps up in the air, grabs onto an overhead strut, reverses and shoves the wheelchair off the ramp jamming the wheels
smile comes to West's face as he watches Loveless's frustrated attempts at going forward and backward
When you get right down to it, Loveless, you just can't beat a good pair of legs
(thin smile) You're obviously not a poker player, Mr
West
Loveless presses a button, the sound of Suddenly four metal legs appear from underneath the wheelchair, raising his body to a height of six foot ten
Two pair always beats a pair
West stares up at him slack-jawed
Loveless rolls up his sleeves, steps away from the wheelchair ready to fight
Now
Was it someone particularly close to you who perished in that military action
West responds with a roundhouse kick to the chin that makes Loveless spin around on the platform of his chair

Well, that hit a nerve
Loveless imitates West by kicking with a lightning flash of an alloy leg
It's a rib cracker that sends West sprawling
mother, perhaps
father

As West screams in pain

Loveless lowers his alloy foot over West's head and begins to crush it like a grape
likes to beat my feet on the Mississippi mud
205

But he's slowly losing
Gordon turns to his female captors, throws his arms out beseechingly
When he does, the derringer comes snapping out of his sleeve in the device which normally holds his pen
Stop this violence
Gordon blinks at the gun
So do Lippenreider and Amazonia
Grant knows what to say, if Gordon doesn't
Drop 'em
They obey, chucking their guns overboard

(chuckles) believe you gentlemen are the polar opposites of a moral dilemma and 'm stuck in the middle
On one end, we have Mr
West, a man of primitive vigours uncomplicated by intellect
And on the other, there's Mr
Gordon
man of ideas, but unlike myself, lacks the passion to kill for them
He'd like to be able to act his way out of it
And for some reason when he's actin', someone always seems to get killed
Loveless puts more pressure on West's head, he groans
Gordon aims
(gasps) Shoot him, Gordon
'm right about you, aren't , Gordon
And that's why 'm gonna kill your friend here
Then 'm going to kill you
The  startles Loveless, West and even Gordon
But when Loveless realizes that he's not hit, he laughs
After all that, you missed
Not exactly
He gestures down Loveless's legs to a punctured metal tube that's spraying a stream of hydraulic fluid all over the deck -- rendering the foot on West's head, powerless
West gets out from under, rubs his neck to regain circulation
Better than a fountain pen, don't you think

They smash into him, driving him to the rail
As they pummel him, trying to throw him over, Gordon realizes this is no time for passivity
He retaliates with a series of chops and kicks that would make West proud
Over the rail, goes Lippenreider
In that split-second before she drops, Gordon mouths "bye-bye
" Before he can savor the moment further, Amazonia clubs him from behind
Gordon whirls and hits her so hard it surprises them both
Over the railing she goes
As Amazonia hovers there, President Grant gives her the kick in the pants she needs to go sailing

For almost four long years 've been trackin' the animal responsible for the Massacre at New Liberty
And  hear that's you
But with the hydraulic fluid, the fight has gone out of Loveless
His mechanical legs shrivel before our eyes, and Loveless sinks helplessly to the deck like the Wicked Witch

Please, West
show a little mercy to a poor defenseless cripple
(imitating his accent) Now, now, Doctor
let's not cloud this otherwise sunny day with that poor-ol'-me-cripple-talk
Just buck up and say to yourself, ' am indefatigably hard-pumpin' and steely
' Loveless gets to his wheelchair and collapses in it
After  kill ya,  swear 'm gonna boil you down to axle grease
Now that's the ol' doctor  know
But the smile fades from West's face when he sees Loveless's shotgun armrests pop out leveled at his waist
West has nowhere to go but up as he leaps to grab the -beam over his head just as Loveless pulls the triggers on both

-   -                              212 The sudden stopping jerks Loveless' wheelchair free
Despite his frantic efforts, he's rolling toward the opposite railing
When the wheelchair hits a pool of hydraulic fluid on the deck, it spins him around 180 degrees
West jumps up, grabs a girder
The wheelchair spins under West's legs and then --  -- it slams into the railing and wedges there
213
-                                          213 The impact makes the mighty beast jerk forward, inches away from toppling over
214
-   -                              214 The jolt shoots West off the girder
He free-falls through the belly and out into the open air
Thinking quickly, he grabs onto the back of Loveless' wheel- chair
His arms nearly torn from their sockets
His weight causes the wheelchair to shift, now leaving it hanging on by a thread
West reaches out, grabs the wheel of the chair and hangs there
Well, 'll be a monkey's uncle
How did we arrive in this dark situation
don't know
Guess 'm stumped
And 'm so cotton-pickin' afraid of heights
They just give me the spooks
Ah, don't be afraid, Loveless
With this being the last leg of our journey and all, you should soak in the view, you're really missing something
Mister West, 'm gonna cut this conversation short

am faced with a difficult decision here
On one hand, there is the overwhelming love that  have for myself, and on the other, the raw, seething hatred  have for you
Now, could kill you very easily, just by pulling this lever

The chair jerks back
But, of course,  would die along with you
guess the only thing that  can take comfort in is the hope that you would hit those rocks a second before me and could enjoy immeasurable bliss before  vanish

West grabs the joystick
Allow me to make that decision easy on you, Loveless

Why is it that  have a sneaking suspicion, that although you are as black as the night on the outside
inside, you are yellow
