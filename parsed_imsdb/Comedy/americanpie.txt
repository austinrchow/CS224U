we see discarded shirts
pants
socks
and hear -  (
) Oooh, yeah
Oh, baby, you're so good
(
) Yeah, 'm the best, baby
Now we see a
but the picture isn't clear
Or, more appropriately, the picture is scrambled -- it phases in and out
Bars scroll across it
And we get occasional glimpses of what looks like -- (
)(') oh -- that was a tit, tits
As most high-school guys know (but few will admit), it is possible to watch the pay channels while they're scrambled
You just need a decent imagination to fill in the rest of the picture
We   to see  -- 17, short, horny
-  (
) Give it to me
Yes
Oh yeah, baby, 'll give it to you
Jim is, uh, physically involved with the scrambled babe
We   to see a small multimedia presentation next to Jim on his bed
"Cosmopolitan" is open to a sexy model
a yearbook is open to the "girl's swim team" section
and a dictionary next to Jim, open to the "Vagina" listing, accompanied by a big vagina diagram
-  (
) Don't you love my sexy body
do, baby,  do
He frantically looks around
and grabs a tube sock off the floor
-  (
) You're so big
Yeah, that's right
-  (
) (deep macho voice) Ohhh, tell me you're a nasty girl
Jim is thrown off
-  (
)(') Yeahhh, you been bad, real bad
Man, shut up
Suddenly there's a  at the door, immediately after which '  enters
Jim scrambles and quickly covers himself and the dictionary with a pillow
She's oblivious to his doings
' Hey, Jimmy
just wanted to say sweet dreams
Yep, okay Mom, 'night
' (leans in to Jim) Kiss goodnight
Jim is revolted
Very reluctantly he gives her a kiss
She turns to leave, and notices the
'  (') Is something wrong with the reception
Yeah
Damn cable
There's this nature show that 'm trying to watch
-  (
) Fuck me
Yes
Uh
He hurriedly tries to change the channel with the , but instead the
-  (
) Jim panics as his mom reacts, shocked
(choking) Must
be
broken
'  enters
' What the heck is this
Nothing
' think he's trying to watch one of the illegal channels
Jesus, Mom
They're not illegal They're pay channels
How could a television channel be illegal
God, get a clue
' James, don't speak that way to your mother
-  (
) Play with my hairy balls
' Turn that garbage off
Give me that
Jim's Dad grabs for the remote, which is sitting on the pillow that's been covering Jim
The pillow gets brushed aside -- revealing the Big Vagina Diagram, Jim with his shorts down, and a very strategically placed tube sock
' Oh my God
' Honey, why don't you let me handle this one
He ushers her out
Jim's Dad is stuck there with his half-naked son
Horrible, awful embarrassment
long, strained beat
'  (') Jesus Christ
The dictionary
Hell, son, 'll buy you some dirty magazines
Jim's Dad exits, shaking his head
Jim sits agape, humiliated
-  (
) Oooh, spank me, daddy, spank me
- We see a Honda Accord drive by a sign at the city limits: "Welcome to East Great Falls, Michigan --  Great Place To Be" - The front of the school
drives up in his Accord
He's a good-humored, good-enough-looking high school senior
rides shotgun -- pretty, smart, confident
She's holding a large, thick envelope, with a big "Vanderbilt" return address on it
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky
You got in
You think so
She tears it open
Pulls out a course catalog, various forms, and a letter which she hands to Kevin
"Dear Ms
Hughes
We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected
Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are
" Kevin, this is serious
You got in
Vicky  in excitement, like a girl at a Beatles concert
Then she , and gives Kevin a big kiss and hug
love you
She hugs Kevin tighter -- as he looks a little frazzled, almost perfunctorily returning the hug
-  - Jim has met up with   -- "" -- a cocky senior with a football-player build
He cradles a ball in a lacrosse stick
Illegal channels
Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is
Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on  the other night
That Ariel, whew
She's a mermaid, dude
(trumping him) Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land
She's a cartoon , dude
hot cartoon
Is there anything you don't jerk off to
-Span
-   - Jim and Oz, now joined by Kevin, walk down the hall
Oz bounces the lacrosse ball off a locker, catching it again
Kevin speaks a little distantly, unnerved
Then she said -- she loves me
Oh shit dude, the -word
And you said
Nothing,  just hugged her back
You think she was serious
couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, " love you grandma" or " love you Vanderbilt
" Just don't bring it up, hang low, maybe she won't mention it again
-   - The guys pass by a    , most notable of which is , who proudly polishes her flute
And what we should do today, in band
Instead of playing our instruments regularly
We should play them backwards
That'll be so funny
The Band Dorks  and agree, "hilariously" attempting to play their instruments from the wrong end
The guys shudder
(to Jim) You guys got the Latin homework
No -- Kevin, you
(offended) Please
(then) We're all golden, we're college bound
figured it out --  can get a c- minus in every class, and it's not gonna make a difference
of , here come
-      - Vicky is talking with , a friend of hers, getting a pop (we're in the Midwest now, gang) from the machine
Vanderbilt's not that far from  of
Yeah right
What
We both have cars
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet
That's not why we're going out
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for
Milk and cookies
Jessica
He'll drive there for me, and 'll drive to Ann Arbor for him
We're going to have sex when he's ready and 'm ready
It's got to be completely perfect
want the right place, the right time, the right moment
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex
So did you do the physics write-up
(offended, a la Kevin) Please
-   - Kevin, Jim, and Oz are still walking down the hall
, preppy, eccentric, is sitting on a bench
There's our man
Finch, you got the Latin homework
Non habeo
Canis meus id comedit
The guys keep staring
beat
Whatever
Someone is  down the hall
Running towards Oz is   -- very clean-cut and preppy, he's a maniac, a jackass, much worse than Oz
Not really part of the group
(yelling) Stifler
Stifler runs full-force into Oz, grabbing him in a bear hug
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface
Depends if my date wants to stop by
That junior chick
Nah, gave her the Heisman
'm working on something new
Yeah right
got an idea for something new
How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick
Bullshit
From where
She works part-time at my dad's store
Hah
Yeah, Oz,  bet it's more like your dad works at her store
Dude, he does not
Really, Stifler
He's the manager
Oz gives a little nod, avoiding the issue
Hey, man, 'm not making fun
'm fuckin' impressed
mean, "Footlong or six-inch, white or wheat," that's some serious shit to master
Oz musters a little
(half-joking) Stifler, you're such an asshole
Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway
You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you
Shit, 'd drop her like a steaming turd
Do you commonly grasp warm pieces of stool
(momentarily puzzled) do when 'm throwing them at your mom, you damn freak
(then) Alright then, see you guys tonight
'll look for you in the No Fucking section
The guys all take this little too seriously to have a comeback
Stifler just   as he walks off
'  - Kevin is on the phone
Hanging near his closet is a tuxedo
with '   -- 25, on his cell phone, traveling down a California road
' You called me to ask me how to get laid
What was  gonna do, call dad don't even know his number
' Just dial 976-Asshole
Yeah, well anyway
thought you might have some advice, brother to brother
mean,  think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know
' Have you ever heard of the bible
What
Not the Bible
' Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that
Does it tell me how to get laid
' You know what, nevermind
You're not ready
Ready for what
' Whoop, you're fading out
Good luck at that party
- small, nostalgia-themed dive
Despite the theme, plays
Kevin, Oz, Jim and Finch sit at a table
They munch on hot dogs piled high with condiments
You ever hear of something called The Bible
Once, in church, dude
Jim is paging through Great Falls' equivalent of the Weekly
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive , fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion
" Okay
"Attractive"
ugly
"Fun loving" -- insane
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old
No, "Charming" is old
"Older" is really old
"Youthful mind" is dead
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick
Eat your damn imitation hot dog
("for the hundredth time") This is no imitation
Removing the hot dog from the Ultradog yields a better dog
Behold -- Ultradog, no dog
Finch displays the cross-section on his hot dog
It's all condiments
The guys react with rehearsed offense
(checks his watch) Alright
'm shooting for a nine o'clock
Beer in hand by five after
You can crash at Stifler's
It's all good
(He pulls out some gum) Breath check
He hands out a stick of gum to each guy, automatically skipping Finch, who pulls out a small, hotel-bottle of Scope
Gargles with it
Spits it into his drink cup
(repulsed) Dude,  wish you wouldn't do that
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch
foolproof plan, my friend
You shall see
Oz has tuned into the song in the background -- "Blinded by the Light" [the original Springsteen version, not the Manfred Mann remake]
(sings along) And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if  needed ri-hide -- How the hell do you know all these random songs
It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic
This was before the cheesy remake
This was remade
Into what
(chiming in as the chorus hits) Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded
At least now  know what the hell they're saying
So, does my hair look better -- (flips a small lock of hair onto his forehead) like this, or
(flips it back up) like this
Who cares
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight
Now, do you think she'd prefer -- (flips hair down again) Cool Hip Jim
(flips it back up) or Laid Back Jim
The difference is so phenomenal, can't decide
-   - They exit the restaurant
What about you
You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base
You know, 've never got that shit
What exactly constitutes third base
(holds up a couple fingers) Contact, dude
Then where does a blowjob figure in
They ponder this for a moment
Shortstop
'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out
So let's say you get there
what's uh, third base feel like
Oh, man, that's kind of sad
Jim shrugs, embarrassed
Feels like warm apple pie, dude
Apple pie
(then) McDonald's or homemade
They just look at him
Finch hops on his scooter
Gentlemen, see you at the Bacchanalia
He  his horn and buzzes away
'  - For a high-school party, it's pretty good
The house is peppered with    - blends with the din of excited conversation
Kevin and Jim are drinking beers
Around them, students mingle and flirt
comes up
What's up, fellas
Hey Sherman
Scopin' the babes
Indeed
Some fine ladies here, boys
Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high
Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment
You've got something going
Did you see that Central chick
Brunette
/ No
She's around
Seems that she's taken a liking to me
Fellas, it's time that she experienced -- The Sherminator
Yeah, okay Sherman, whatever
'm a sophisticated sex robot, sent back through time
to change the future for one lucky lady
Yeah man, right on
Sherman saunters off into the party
(') (shakes his head) Hopeless
Vicky approaches, having a good time, joining the guys, Jim spots  across the room
She's beautiful, a masterpiece of a woman
Oh, shit
There she is
Nadia
You like her
Her sponsor family lives on my block
Why don't you talk to her
What would  say
Just tell her what's on your mind
And smile, you've got a good smile
(then to Kevin) Come on
(to Jim) Gotta go
But -- Kevin and Vicky disappear into the crowd -- just as Jim sees Nadia approaching him
He freaks
(cont'd) Kevin, get back here
But he's gone
And Nadia is now in front of him
With no other alternative, Jim readies himself, smiling big
(with a really sexy accent) You are in my English class, no
Jim smiles
(barely) Yes
thought so
Jim's smile grows even bigger, almost stupid
beat
(cont'd) So you are having fun
Jim nods, still smiling away
Staring right through her head
(cont'd) said, you are having fun
little  escapes his throat
Jim is on mental vacation
(cont'd) Me too
beat
Jim's expression is now plasticized
Eyes vacant
frozen, completely artificial smile
Nadia is confused
(cont'd) Well
am going to get another beer
You want one
Jim strains to speak, through his smile
No
you
go
ahead
Okay
She walks off
Jim , completely relaxing, like a huge burden is now off of him
He wipes his brow
Then, realizing -- Oh, shit
No
Shit
He pounds his head with his fist
'  -   - group of band dorks is on the porch, including Michelle
Stifler stands in the doorway, staring at them in disbelief
We're here for the party
What party
There's no party
blares from inside
drunken  reaches through the door and ruffles Stifler's hair
(
) Stiff-lerrr
Par-tyyy
The hand disappears back into the house
beat
Try the house down the street
Stifler slams the door
The dorks wait a moment
Ring the bell again
Ringing the bell is dorky -- let's just go in
We hear a
'  -   - Kevin and Vicky are on the bed, making out
Oh, Kev
Vicky -- do you think, maybe
it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship
Tonight
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening
Isn't this how you've always pictured it
(
) (yelling) Dude, my farts fuckin' stink
#2 (
) You reek like a fuckin' Yeti, dude
Go take a shit or something
Kevin and Vicky exchange a glance
Or not
Vicky pushes him onto his back
Just relax
- Oz is in the passenger seat, making out with the aforementioned
She's attractive and older- looking (from a high-school perspective)
They are parked near the river that flows through downtown Great Falls
Great evening, isn't it
Sure
There's something about the spring that's just cool
Like the smell of fresh rain or something
At this, she snuggles up to him
Oz smiles confidently
(') Suck me, beautiful
The College Chick backs off, confounded
What did you just say
(not so confidently) Suck me
beautiful
The College Chick's eyes flutter in disbelief
She tries to keep her cool -- but can barely restrain her laughter
What
Oz attempts to maintain a suave exterior, but he's just had the rug pulled from under him
Uh
you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova
You need some work, buddy
She bursts into laughter
Oz is ill
Well
jeez, don't laugh at me
Seeing Oz's defeated expression, she collects herself
Look, Chris
There are just some things you need to learn, that's all
Like what
She sees that he's lost
Almost feels sorry for him
Alright, well
you've got to tone it down
You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic
okay
You have to pay attention to a girl
Be sensitive to her feelings
Relationships are reciprocal
'm not good in math
She's trying not to laugh again
Come on, 'll drop you off at your friends'
Oz couldn't be humiliated any further
'  -  -  - Oz is nursing a beer, having just told the story to Jim, Stifler, and some guys
(hysterical, toppling over) You actually said that
Haaaah
Shut the fuck up
Hey, you did better than  did, Nova
Oh that's really reassuring
And don't call me Nova anymore
'm a fraud
This is pathetic
'm gonna find me a little hottie
Stifler strides into another room
(
)(cont'd) (yelling) Suck me, beautiful
Oz wallows in his beer can, beaten
'  -   - Vicky is pleasuring Kevin
you know
(brief pause) Let me know
Okay, don't stop
She resumes
moment more -- and then Kevin is about to lose it
(cont'd) Oh -- Now
With awkward hurriedness, Vicky stops as Kevin frantically searches for a receptacle
He grabs a nearby cup of beer
'  -  ,    - Insert --  hand pumping up the keg
fresh beer foams out into the cup
#1 There we go
'  -   -  - Vicky is buttoning up her shirt
Kevin tentatively sets down the beer and buttons his pants
Suddenly the Stifler is standing there
coat hanger sticks out of the doorknob
,
God dammit, Stifler
Check-out time
Please vacate the room
Stifler, you're such a jerk
She runs out, grabbing her clothes
Kevin runs after her
Vicky, wait
Stifler enters the bedroom, laughing, pulling a behind him
He closes the door
God,  can't believe there are so many cool people at this party
Yep
And you got a keg, too, wow
(realizing) Oh, wait,  left my beer downstairs
Stifler notices Kevin's beer sitting on the night table
He hands it to her
Here, babe
Thanks
She's about to take a sip
(gazing into her eyes) You're really beautiful
Thrown off, she sets the beer down
Really
Uh huh
She's totally enthralled
Nervous, she raises the beer again to take a sip
Then Stifler moves in
Takes the beer from her and sets it down
Starts kissing her
She breaks it off
don't know if  want to be doing this
(sighs) Doing what
Stifler looks inconvenienced
He picks up the beer, annoyed
You know
If we hook up, tomorrow 'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about
(shifty) No way
Avoiding her look, he raises the beer to take a sip
(a little angry) Steve
You could at least look at me when you say that
Stifler stops and , the beer inches from his mouth
Lowers it
Stares her in the eye
Look
(searching, remembers) Sarah
wouldn't go telling stories or whatever about you promise
Smiling, he raises the beer
'  -  - Jim and some   are pounding shots of vodka
What the hell
should be able to talk to chicks
'm articulate got a 720 on my  verbal
(starts listing off words) Copious
Verisimilitude
upstairs
(') (unaffected) Intransigence
upstairs
The   comes running through the kitchen
And indeterminate stain is on her shirt
She bolts out the door and into the night
moment passes
(') Regurgitation
'  -  - Stifler is on his knees, barfing in the toilet
Jim and a few other guys rush in
#1 Oh, gross
Jesus, what did you eat
Stifler just keeps hurling
Kevin enters, holding the remains of the tainted beer
Stifler, how's the man chowder
Stifler barfs even more violently
'  -  ,    - Jessica and Vicky are refilling their beers at the keg
Nadia waits patiently beside them with an empty cup
He likes it
Of course he does
What about you
Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period
think 've had one
Well that's a no
No wonder you're not psyched about sex
(starts filling Vicky's beer) You've never even had one manually
've never tried it
Are you kidding
You've never double- clicked your mouse
Vicky shrugs
(') Hell, just a pair of tight pants will set me off
(noticing Nadia next to them, she passes the tap along) Am  right or what, Nadia
(no bones about it) You are right
The hands are not always necessary
(to Vicky) See
In fact --  should teach you my own special method
developed it myself at the ballet institute in Prague
You use nothing but the muscles of the inner thigh
Nadia walks off
No wonder she never pays attention in class
Vicky nods, traumatized
'  -  - Kevin and Jim are looking at a   ' on the wall
Very attractive, late 30's
Shit,  can't believe a fine woman like this produced a guy like Stifler
are walking by as Jim says this
Dude
That chick -- is a
#2 What the hell is that
---
Mom 'd Like to Fuck
Suddenly, a bedroom door opens a couple inches
Sherman pokes his head out
(hushed, to guys) Don't you think you fellas could try a little tact
've got company
Know what  mean
In the bedroom in the background, we see the Central Girl
Sherman closes the door, leaving the guys there, dumbstruck
'  -  - Jim and Kevin are coming down the stairs
(snapping) Dammit
If Sherman has sex before do, 'm gonna be really fucking pissed
They turn the corner into the kitchen
'  -  - Man,  just gotta get laid already
This blowjob thing is bullshit
He stops
Vicky is there with Jessica
Staring at him
Vicky quietly grabs her purse
Hurt watch, silently
Kevin doesn't know what to say
Jessica, can you drive me home
Sure
The guys watch as the girls head for the door
Vicky, wait
Not for you
The girls exit
Nobody says anything
Kevin is in shock
(
) Yeti
am the Yeti
'  - The next morning
The party is long over
Plastic beer cups and various bottles litter the house, but it's not trashed
Jim is wandering around in a daze, holding his head
He stumbles over a body
It's Kevin
Ow, what the hell
Sorry,  thought you were dead
They walk over to the other side of the room
Finch is sitting on the couch
Good morning gentleman
Finch
Where were you last night
What happened to the foolproof plan
thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance
(off their looks) When  got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left
Oz wanders in, still sullen
Takes a seat, sulking
Feeling better, Oz
'm such a loser
That's the spirit
We hear  coming down the stairs
It's the She wears a "Central" sweatshirt
Sherman follows behind her
The guys watch in disbelief as Sherman and the girl speak hushed, intimately
(snippets of conversation) 'll never forget
thank you
The Central Girl smiles
Notices the other guys watching
Just gives Sherman a kiss on the cheek
Bye
She exits
The guys are dumbfounded
Jaws hang
Sherman looks triumphant
Strides over to the guys
You did it
Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy
am now a man
The guys are shocked and amazed
(') highly recommend you join the club
--  don't get it, how the hell did you do that
It was just my time, fellas, it was just my time
Best of luck to you, boys
Sherman exits
Silence
The guys look like they just lost the World Series on errors
They slowly take seats, ruined
put in months of quality time with Vicky
Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores
This is just wrong
No shit, 'm never gonna get laid
How the hell am  gonna become this Mr
Sensitive Man
Jesus, we're all gonna go to college as virgins
They've probably got special dorms for people like us
long beat as they give this serious consideration
Then, Kevin strides purposefully to the front of the group
Alright,  got an idea
But it stays between us
Agreed
They do
(cont'd) Okay
It's really simple
We make an agreement -- no wait, more than an agreement
Like a bet
No, a pact No money involved
This is more important than any bet
Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate
beat Dude, it's not like  haven't been trying to get laid
This is different
This is better
Think of when you're working out, Oz
You need a partner, someone to spot you
Someone to keep you motivated
Oz nods, getting into it
Kevin smiles and continues, arms outspread
(') That's what we are, we keep each other on track
Prior to this day, we've postured
We've procrastinated
We've pretended
We've -- well can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too
Pontificated
(ignoring him) Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable
But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny
(kung fu voice) Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it
(going on) The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here
Now think about it -- Kevin jumps up on a chair
(') No longer will our penises remain flaccid and unused
From now on, we fight for every man out there who isn't getting laid when he should be
This is our day
This is our time
And, by God, we're not gonna let history condemn us to celibacy
We will make a stand
We will succeed
We will get laid Kevin jumps down off the chair, and puts his hand out in front of him
One by one, the guys pile their hands on top, in between them -- it's a pact
They break with a Woo-hoo
(wandering down from upstairs) What the hell are you losers doing
They all stop
Stifler has a toothbrush hanging from his mouth
goatee of dried toothpaste
If  might ask, when you brush your teeth, do you spit or swallow
Stifler tries to give a retort to Finch, but turns green and heads back upstairs
- The guys are finishing up breakfast
Hot dogs & eggs
Now, the sex -- it's got to be valid, consensual sex
No funny stuff
And no prostitutes, if you were thinking about that, Finch
Finch gives a wistful "Who, me
" (') So, 'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance
Dude, prom sucks
know, but think about it -- At the parties that night
Chicks are gonna want to do it
Yeah, it's like tradition or something
Right
That gives us
Exactly three weeks to the day
They take this in with some trepidation
Alright then
It's official
Any questions
There are none
Kevin raises his Pepsi
(cont'd) To the next step
The guys raise their drinks
To the next step
They toast
And from this, we go into our : '  - Jim sits in the room as Kevin goes through the yellow pages
Finds a "Floral Delivery" listing
Kevin dials
-   - Kevin, Jim, and Oz are pooling a few dollars together, which Kevin takes
They part ways
'  - Oz is watching the Lifetime Channel as Jim looks on in confusion
Martha Stewart-type thing where they pain pottery with little sponges
Oz looks dubious
-  - Finch is unpacking his lunch
He carefully unfolds a napkin to reveal a sandwich, crust removed
Other than that, he's doing absolutely nothing
'  - Jim is fiddling with a small, golfball-like camera attached to his computer
The computer screen reads, "- :  We Make Love Happen
"  As Jim fiddles with the camera, a window on the screen shows his real-time image
He clicks an onscreen-button labeled " " -- the image freezes, showing Jim with an awkward grimace
The screen reads, "
" -  - Kevin holds a copy of the
We see he's in the "Religion" section
Surrounded by piles of different bibles
No luck
-  - Finch pulls out a small mustard packet
He neatly snips the end with scissors
Then rolls the packet, like a tube of toothpaste, economically dispensing every last bit of mustard
'  - Jim is on his computer
The screen reads "  00 "  Jim is nonplussed
-   - Kevin, Oz, and Jim are closely gathered around Kevin's locker, holding their backpacks open
Kevin holds a big shopping bag, which he turns over, and a box of condoms falls out
He hands it over to Jim
and we see that the guys' packs are full of various condom boxes
'  - Jim has unraveled a bunch of condoms and is curiously examining them
And        with a
(shoving the rubbers into his night table) Just a minute
He opens the bedroom door
Jim's Dad is standing there
' (trying not to look inside) Can  come in
Yeah, sure
' You're not
busy
Dad, come in
Jim's Dad reluctantly enters, carrying a brown paper bag
He takes a seat on Jim's bed
' (fatherly attempt) Sit down, Jim
Let's talk
Jim takes a seat next to his dad
Okay
' These are for you
From father to son
Jim looks at the bag
Uncomfortable
Hesitantly, he takes it
Slowly, dreadfully, he pulls out a copy of 10
Uh
dad
Jim's Dad is doing his best to be the good father
' Go ahead son, there's more
Beyond embarrassed, Jim reaches into the bag
Cringes
Pulls out a
'  (cont'd) Now, that one's a little more
a little more
graphic
know, Dad
' Oh, okay
Here's let me show you
Jim's Dad takes the bag back
Pulls out a copy of '  (cont'd) This, son, is your more exotic dirty magazine
Dad
know
' Do you know about the clitoris
(through clenched teeth) Yes dad
' Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate
(interrupting, hand up) Thank you, dad,  got it
' Okay, well that about covers it
Jim  something incomprehensible
'  (cont'd) Now, let's put these somewhere where your mother won't find them
Jim's Dad takes the stack of magazines
He goes to open Jim's night table
Jim freaks
Wait
But it's too late
Jim's Dad is face-to-face with the unraveled prophylactics
He sours
' (beaten) 'll have to save this speech for another day
'm too worn out
Jim's Dad exits, a condom stuck to the back of his pants
-      - Kevin is trying to talk to Vicky
Did you get the flowers
(no response) What about the poem
She doesn't care
(cont'd) Vicky, please don't do this
Vicky stares him right in the eye
Strong
'll think about it
She slams her locker and walks off
Jessica is nearby
She's overheard
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough
That's easy, she likes you
What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons
You gotta give her what she's never had
What
'll give you a hint
(hot, orgasmic) "Ohhh, yeah, yeah
" (flat) Comprende
You mean
and orgasm
You got it, stud
Well
'm pretty sure 've -- (interrupts authoritatively) No you haven't
But that one time -- (shaking head) No
Well of course 'd want to give her that
mean, what do you think, don't care about her
Do you
Of course
Do you love her
Kevin squirms
--  don't know, you can't ask me that
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her
That's how  was duped
don't want to dupe her, Jessica
If say it,  have to be sure  mean it
Well it's up to you
The Big , or the Big
Suddenly Stifler comes running up, breathless
Dickhead
You gotta see this
-   - The    is practicing, singing one of those doo-wop, Acapella love songs (i
e
"Love You Like  Do")
Singing with the group is none other than Oz
He's not doing too badly, but mainly he's checking out the various vocal jazz girls
Smiling at them, giving suave little waves
Kevin, Stifler, and Jim take seats in the back of the auditorium, listening
This is unexpected
What did you cocks do to him
Shit, if Coach Marshall sees this, he'll kick Oz off the team on principle alone
The song finishes
Oz bounds up to the other guys
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action
Yeah,  think you sounded pretty good
think you need your balls reattached
Keep it down, dude
What the fuck are you doing here
This place is an untapped resource
Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are hot few of the girls are gathering their stuff, one of whom is  -- conservative-looking, cute
#1 Hey, we've got Conan the Barbarian singing with us
#2 Maybe he'll crush some beer cans on his forehead
think he's got a nice voice
#1 (ribbing her) Go talk to him, maybe you can teach him how to read
Heather shakes her head
: You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss
Dude, watch me work
They go for sensitive studs like me
Oz waves goodbye to a final choir girl
-  - Finch is sitting on a bench, reading the paper, carefree
Kevin and Jim approach
This is your plan, Finch
Yep
He turns a page
Skims the articles
beat
This
Right now
Uh-huh
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee
Mochaccino
(then) Actually, in the spirit of the pact, do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter
Of course, Finch
What
Whatever you hear about me, you agree
What are we gonna hear
You'll see
Gotta go
Sixteen minute round trip
Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school
When was the last time you looked at the facilities here
Fifteen minutes ago
Finch shudders and walks away
Kevin and Jim stand there, dumbfounded
An   approaches
Uh, guys
Was that Paul Finch
Yeah
You guys have like, seen him in the locker room, right
Yeah
Is it true that he's really
huge
have no idea
Finch showers in a bathing suit
(forced) No -- it's true
He is
really
big
(loving it) Yeah, enormous
Woah
Does he have a date for prom yet
Definitely not
No way She hurries off to a   , sharing the gossip
They all seem very interested
(dumbfounded) Finch hasn't done a damn thing, and he's got girls lining up already
'  - Kevin is on the phone
'  (
) Say that again, Kevin
Uh
thought you might know a trick or something
To make her, you know
- Kevin's brother is on his cell phone prepares food behind the counter
' Orgasm
The Sushi Chef looks up
Kevin's Brother turns away
Yeah
(to Kevin's Brother) What's good here
' Try the spicy tuna hand roll
What
How do  do that
' Uh -- forget that
Look, is that all you're interested in
Ways to get your girlfriend into bed
Well, no
think
guess it would be good to be able to return the favor
mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as do
' That's good, that's what  needed to hear
Now you qualify
Qualify for what
' You've just inherited The Bible
-    - Kevin is walking through the "Religion" Section
He carefully looks about, making sure nobody's watching
'  (
) It originally started as a sex manual, this book that some guys brought back from Amsterdam in the early eighties
What to do with your tongue, things like that
And each year, it got passed on to one East student who was worthy of it
Kevin kneels down on the floor, near a section of various bibles on the bottom shelf
'  (
)(cont'd) After a couple years, guys started adding their own techniques
Things they figured out themselves
Kevin slides out the section of bibles from the bottom shelf
Pulls out a pocket knife
Flips up the bottom of the shelf
Slides it out
'  (
)(cont'd) You have to keep it a secret, and return it at the end of the year
So, now you know
Good luck
There, a bit dusty, is an old book
Many extra pages of notebook paper have been tucked into it, nearly breaking the binding
The original title is now obscured -- over it, someone has written "The Bible
" Remember when Indian Jones found that gold statue
It's like that right now
Kevin carefully pulls it out
Reverently flips through it
Full of details
Explicit diagrams
Anecdotes
And atop each handwritten page is a year, indicating the date it was added
Kevin reaches the last page
It's blank
He lightly runs his hand down the empty page
'  -  - Jim enters his house, slinging his backpack off his shoulder
(yells) Mom
'm home
No response
Jim walks into the kitchen, noticing a fresh-baked pie on the counter
Next to it is a note: "Jimmy - Apple, your favorite
'll be home late
Enjoy
Love Mom
" Jim sniffs the pie, taking in the aroma
Then stops
as a quizzical look spreads across his face
After a moment of thought, he slides a finger into the pie
Moves it around a bit, studying the consistency
Then Jim becomes more curious
We can see the gears in his head start to turn
He looks down at the pie like it's
well, not a pie
'  - Jim's dad gets out of his car, carrying his briefcase
'  - Jim's dad comes in the door and stops dead in his tracks
His face drops, appalled
' Jim
It's not what it looks like
: '  -  - Jim and his Dad sit in silence, opposite each other at the table
Jim stares into his lap, humiliated
Jim's dad is crushed
You've never seen such disappointment
but he's trying to keep his chin up for Jim's sake
In the middle of the table is the pie
It's decimated
Mushed up, ruined
violated
' (fighting back tears) guess
we'll just tell your mother
that we ate it all
'  - Late
Kevin sits on his bed, reading a book -- the Bible
If all students studied the way Kevin's studying this book, we'd have a nation of geniuses
He's scrutinizing it
Turning it sideways and upside down as if trying to decipher cave paintings
-   - The Vocal Jazz Group is doing a song
Oz is singing along, really making it look like he's into it
He closes his eyes, singing with even more enthusiasm
As the song ends, Oz continues just a moment more with his shtick -- a little, heartfelt vocal "scat" to tag the number
The thing is, it actually sounds really good
Oz opens his eyes
to see the whole group -- especially the girls -- looking at him, somewhat awed
The   is a smartly-dressed black woman
What the hell was that
Sorry
No, it was good
Oh, well
(noticing Heather looking at him, he acts "sensitive") It came from the heart
Well then keep it coming
(to everyone) Alright, people, good work
Keep it up and we'll do great at the state competition
Rehearsal wraps up, and Heather comes up to Oz
Not bad, Chris
(surprised himself) Really
Hey, thanks -- Heather, right
Yeah
so
you've got this sort of
Bobby McFerrin thing going there
(no idea) Yeah
Right, uh-huh
(then, back into it) feel like 've discovered this whole new side of me
Music is so expressive
(amused) Okay
(then) mean,  agree, but
aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something
Oz "gets serious" at this
Oh sure
know what people think
It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player --  also play football, by the way -- But that's like
not all that  am
Of course,  didn't -- (cutting her off) mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that
(sparking to this) You
You think  don't get that
God, it's like just because  don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss
" Of course, this is what Stifler said about her
And for a moment, this catches Oz off guard
Yeah
so like, what else do you do
(offended) Well the same things you do
Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever
(then) What do you think  do
(genuine) just -- realized that  didn't know anything about you
was interested
Oh
well that's okay
Cool
- Kevin is walking home with Vicky
He's a couple paces behind her, almost tagging along
was being selfish
And majorly insensitive
And 'm a total idiot
think "shithead" really says it
Yes
'm a shithead
'm a complete and total shithead
She cracks a little smile
(') And  want to try to make it up to you
How
Vicky stops walking
Looks at Kevin
'  - Vicky's perfect suburban home
as we hear (
) Oh
ungghhhhh
(
) Shhhh
Your parents are downstairs
'  - Tight on Vicky's face, in sexual bliss, writhing
Oh Kevin -- don't stop
Just a second
We see that Kevin is kneeling on the floor
Vicky's legs are to both sides of him -- he's ducking down, consulting the bible, which is hidden beneath the bed
It's open to a page titled "The Tongue Tornado
" Kevin resumes, out of frame
Vicky goes nuts
(cont'd) (a little too loudly) Oh, God
Vicky reaches blindly for a pillow
She squeezes it over her face, moaning into it
(cont'd) Moly shmmmt
Fmmkkkk
Noticing that Vicky now can't see him, Kevin cautiously pulls out The Bible from under the bed
Sets it next to her
He constantly refers from the book to Vicky, and back again
'  -  - '  is straining some pasta
On the fridge, we see a collage in tribute to Vicky -- her senior portrait, National Honor Society certificate, a report card
' (yells to Vicky's Dad) Hon
Can you tell Vick to come on down for supper
'  is at the table reading the paper
He gets up with a
'  - Vicky can barely control herself
She  into the pillow
Vicky, shhh, you know there's no lock on your door
'  -  - Vicky's dad is trudging up the stairs
'  - Vicky wrestles with her own ecstacy
Groans
Kevin keeps referencing The Bible
Whatever he's doing, it's working
'  -  - Vicky's dad approaches the bedroom door
'  - Vicky is about to explode
She pulls the pillow off her face, gasping
'  -  - Vicky's dad reaches for the doorknob
(
) '
Vicky's dad shrugs, turns around, and heads back downstairs
'  -  - Jim's door opens
he winces
to see Jim's dad looking at the family portrait of Jim's family in the hallway outside Jim's room, his back turned to Jim's door
Hey, dad
Did you knock
Jim's dad continues to study the picture
beat
Then he turns around, like he just realized the door was open
' Oh, Jim
'm looking at the ol' family portrait, here
Yep
It's a good one
Jim can only shrugs in response
He goes into the hall and looks at the portrait
beat
'  (') Son,  wanted to talk to you about what  think you were trying to do the other day
Jim's face drops, seeing his death unfold
'  (') (continuing with his prepared speech) Now, you may have tried it in the shower, or maybe in bed at night, and not even known what you were doing
Or perhaps you've heard your friends talking about it in the locker room
Jim's eyes dart about, looking for a place to hide
Dad, please stop
Please
'm sure know what you're talking about
' Sure you know, son, but  think you've been having a little problem with it
It's okay, though
What you're doing is perfectly normal
It's like practice
Like when you play tennis against a wall
Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball
(a beat) You do want a partner, don't you son
(through clenched teeth) Yes
' That's great
Now remember, it's okay to play with yourself
Or, as always called it -- (elbows Jim) "Stroke the salami
" (chuckles) Ho-ho, Jim
There's nothing to be ashamed of
Hell, 'm fifty-two, and still enjoy masturbating
Uncle Mort masturbates
We all masturbate
Nauseated and entirely disoriented, Jim tries to stumble back into his room
He  the doorframe
Keeps going, slamming the door behind him

'  (cont'd) Poor guy thought he was the only one
- The football field also doubles as the lacrosse field
East Great Falls is battling Central
It's a rough game, muddy, brutal
We see Oz grunting and groaning, playing very tough
On the sidelines, we see Heather has shown up
She's watching the game -- and is impressed as she watches Oz's agility and domination
Oz runs up the field, cradling the ball in his stick
couple   try to check him
Heather cringes with each impact, and is then excited to see Oz dodge his opponents
Finally, Oz scores with a triumphant
Heather with the crowd as the  players congratulate each other
- After the game
Oz sees Heather waiting for him on the sidelines
He's about to run over when snags him -- Good work, Ostreicher
Thanks coach
You're a killer, Ozzy
(trying to get away) -- Thanks, coach -- as he trots over to Heather, covered in mud
Hey, what're you doing here
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience
You like, "kicked butt
" clod of mud falls from Oz's uniform onto Heather's skirt
(brushing it off her skirt) Whoops, excuse me
Oz wipes the mud from his hands
beat
Heather has something to say that's not quite coming out
Um
Chris -- You can call me Oz
Do  have to
You can call me Ostreicher
What's your middle name
Forget it
Come on
won't tell
Neither will
Okay
(pause) So  had this
thought, and
this may seem like it's out of left field, and  don't know if you can, but since 'm not going with anyone -- Before she can finish, Stifler runs up, sweaty and excited
Hah
Central sucks
(noticing Heather) Choir Chick
What the hell are you doing here
Well,  uh,  was -- (decides to stand her ground) was asking Chris to prom
(turns to Oz) So do you wanna go
Oz is surprised at her directness
Impressed
Yeah Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo
Stifler, fuck -- (noticing Heather, "sensitive") man, you don't have to be so insensitive
beat
What (he dismisses it) Whatever -- look uh, don't forget -- my cottage after prom
On Lake Michigan
Stifler joins some other
Alright, cool
gotta hit the showers, but
think this'll be really good
Yeah, me too, okay, cool
They share a smile
Then Heather walks off towards her car
Oz trots off to Stifler and the other lacrosse guys
My man Oz, working it with the choir babes
(cheering, slapping him) Yeah, go Oz
etc
Oz laughs, embarrassed
(pandering to them) Hey, you know, what can  say,  dig those cute little sweaters she wears
'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right
Stifler goes into what can only be described as the Spank- Me-And-Fuck-Me-Like--Whore-Dance
(') Yeah
Sing for me
yes
The other guys
Oz joins in, laughing in spite of himself
They all high-five
And from the other side of the field, we see Heather peering over at them
Hardly believing it as Oz joins in the laughter
-  - English class
The  is wrapping up a lecture
So once Hal becomes king, he has to take on the responsibilities of leadership, and turn his back on his old, drunken friend, Falstaff
You see, Hal was going through a rite of passage, much like you all are
Make the most of the time you've got left together
You'll miss it later
Jim, Kevin, and Oz sit in the back of the classroom in one corner
So does your tongue cramp up
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though
Wow, that's amazing, she's probably gonna want to do it soon
Kevin shrugs as the
Sherman passes by
Still questing after the holy grail, eh guys
He  and exits
The guys stand up, exiting the classroom
Hey, where's Finch
Went home to shit
don't get it
How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation
What reputation
Observe
He taps a passing    on the shoulder
(cont'd) Excuse me
Do you know who Paul Finch is
Of course
Have you guys seen his tattoo
Yes
Is it cool
heard it was like an eagle, blazing in fire and stuff
(nods, loving it) Actually, it's an eagle and this big python
Really
Yeah, see it's on his stomach, here, and the eagle -- the eagle is actually grasping the python in its talons, so the snake is like his -- (interrupting) That's good, Jim
Woah, no way
That guy is so cool
She hurries off to tell her friends
The guys exit the classroom
-    - Okay, explain
can't,  have no idea how he's doing it
And that leaves you trailing, Jim
You gotta get your act together
(a little aggravated) Yeah,  know
'm working on it
Jim turns around -- to find Nadia is standing right in front of him
Jim says nothing
Stuck
Staring
Oz elbows him
Jim gives a startled
You are very good in the world history class, yes
(gulps) Me
Jim looks over to Kevin and Oz, who excitedly give him encouraging looks and gestures
(') (trying to decipher the guys' signals) Yes
No
Yes
Perhaps you can help me with my studies
The guys nod, "Yes
Yes
" Okay
that would be cool sometime
(sees the guys gesticulating) How 'bout tomorrow
Well,  do have ballet practice
Perhaps  can come by your house afterwards
can change clothes at your place
(barely, overwhelmed) suppose that would be okay
Nadia walks off
Jim collapses into Oz's and Kevin's arms, like a marathon runner at the end of a race
They pat him heartily in congratulations
-    - After school
Oz is there as Heather pulls up in a new Saab
Nice car
'm glad you think so
You don't like it
No,  like the car
(then, direct) By the way, though, about prom
That was like a bad idea
Sorry  invited you
She hastily walks towards the school
What
Oh, please
asked you because thought you might actually be worth going with
But you are just a jock
No wait
You're a jerk
What
No 'm not
saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies
wasn't making fun of you
Give me a break, you're so full of it
She hurries up more, breaking off from Oz, and enters the school
After a moment, he slowly heads in
-   - Oz and Heather are singing with the group, at opposite ends of the room
It's a pop, contemporary arrangement of "
"  It sounds jazzy, cool
Oz looks dazed, like the wind's taken out of him
He sings along, distant
Heather, almost defiantly, sings clearer and better than ever
Oz watches her, though she never looks his way
At the bride of the song, Heather breaks into a solo
She sings beautifully
Oz is hooked
The Choir Teacher halts the song
Okay, Heather, that was good, but want to thicken up that solo
Michigan State is this Saturday, and want that part to smoke know, my timing's off
little, but  think it'll work better as a duet
With a tenor part
(interrupting) 'll do it
beat as the Choir Teacher is impressed and Heather looks indifferent
(') 'll do it
Okay then
The rest of you okay with that
The rest of the choir agrees, as Heather looks to Oz with skepticism
(') Great
See you tomorrow
The group starts packing up
(annoyed) Why are you doing this
Because  want to
Yeah
Well you can't fake your way through this
You better practice
She leaves
-  - Jim, Kevin, Oz, and Stifler
Fuck me
You're gonna have a naked Eastern-European chick in your house, and you're telling me you're not gonna take advantage of that
What am  gonna do, broadcast her over the internet
You can do that
(off their looks) Oh -- no way
can't do that to her
Dammit, Jim, get some fucking balls
If you don't have the guts to photograph a naked chick in your room, how are you ever gonna sleep with one
Now all you gotta do is set up some sort of private link or whatever on the net, and tell me the address
The guys ponder this
You can send me the address too
Well
dammit, if 'm doing this, how the hell am  gonna watch

Kevin is unloading beer and chips from a grocery bag
We see an image of Jim's bedroom on the computer screen
It's a little strobed, but easily watchable
Suddenly Jim's face pops into frame
He's adjusting the camera
There we go
'  - We see the same image on Jim's screen
Jim turns off just the monitor
It looks like the computer is off -- the ruse is undetectable
Jim's dad enters with Nadia
She's in sweats and a leotard, carrying a duffel bag over her shoulder
Jim's dad is delighted, fidgety, almost giddy
' Son
This lady's here for you

Hey Nadia
Hello James
Ready to study

Do you mind
This fabric is so uncomfortable

No, go right ahead and get dressed

Get me when you're ready
Jim exits, closing the door behind him

Jim sprints down the hall
Thunders down the stairs

Jim bolts through the room
Be back in a sec
He practically crashes through the door on his way out
' Jim
Honey, where are you going
She turns and looks at her husband
Both perplexed
- Jim runs like hell

'  - Jim trucks across the lawn to the door
'  - Kevin and Finch are watching the computer screen
Want a beer
Finch simply waves off the question
He's glued to the screen
Jim bursts into the room, breathless
Did  miss anything
Just in time
Jim grabs a seat by the computer
All three guys watch, transfixed
Nadia is slipping out of her leotard
Woah
Nadia's leotard is off
Bra and panties
Outstanding body

Nadia pauses
Looks in Jim's full-length mirror
Admiring her body
Oh, man
This is incredible
And
yes
Nadia peels off her sportsbra
Supple breasts
The guys are awestruck

He sighs, leafing through some sheet music
It's as quiet and boring as can be
'  - '  - Stifler and his brother are awestruck
' This is like the coolest thing 've ever seen
'  -  - Oh, thank you Lord, for this wonderful day
Nadia still primps in the mirror
Then she looks around
Very carefully, she pokes through the stuff on Jim's night table

You can't touch my stuff
Nadia opens the night table
Stops
Jim flushes
Nadia delicately reaches into the night table as Jim crumbles
(cont'd) Oh no no no
She pulls out the stack of porno magazines
Nice collection there, Jim
Nadia takes a

There is a gorgeous woman masturbating on my bed

Nadia's lost herself
You know, Jim
you could go back there
and

But, but -- what would  do
Anything
Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something
That's stupid
No, you're stupid

'  -  - Nadia leans over to Jim's clock radio
Turns it on
We hear
She flips the dial, and we hear Then a , -
Perfect
She turns to Jim
Uh
Move with the music
Um
okay
He struts clumsily back and forth
Takes his shirt off
Swings it in a circle around his head
and lets go of it, aiming for the QuickCam, where it lands
No, no, you must put your whole body into it
Nadia,  can't -- Can't what
Do you not want to be with me
wish to be entertained, James
Jim nods eagerly
Concentrates on the music
as we see the shirt slide off the camera
Jim starts writhing to the beat
Like a hyperactive chicken
'  - '  - What the fuck is this
'  - The horror, the horror
'  -  - Jim is into it now
Possibly the worst dancer in the world
No rhythm
No soul
-  - #2 God, what a buzzkill
'  - watches in amusement
Work it, baby
The  and dance mockingly along with Jim
'  -  - Jim tugs off his pants, dancing and tripping on them
(turned on) More sexy, Jim, more sexy
Jim is clearly excited by Nadia's prodding
He does some pathetically ridiculous move with his pants, sliding them around his chest and neck
'  - is watching
He's no Paul Finch
'  -  - Kevin and Finch are now completely sickened
This is truly revolting
'  -  - Jim is straddled over a chair, grinding against the chair back, in his boxers and shorts
(getting really turned on) More, more, you bad boy
Jim starts spanking his ass as he gyrates
-  - The guys are all trying not to watch, yet still drawn to the computer
#1 Ugh
God
'  -  - Now
Hames, come to me
Oh yeah
Jim dances over to her
She pulls him onto the bed
Kisses his neck
Takes his hand
Places it on her thigh
Be gentle
Jim
'  - Ho-lee shit
'  - '  -  - This just got a hell of a lot better
'  - Jim's hand wanders up Nadia's leg
She does the same to him
Blows in his ear
Her hand is about to enter his shorts
And Jim is done
Bang
That's it
He looks down at himself in terror
Nadia sees
Backs away
Jim
Oh no
'  - Oh no
-  - The stoners look
well, stoned
#1 Bummer
'  - The girls are
'  - '  - ' What happened
What happened
He blew it
Literally
'  - Nadia is getting dressed
You are done, James
Perhaps  should be going now
No, no, 'm not done
've got reserves
Nadia, please please please
'm begging you
She sees the desperation in his eyes
Thinks about it
Smiles
do like your dirty magazines
Jim digs into the stack of pornos
Grabs
Did you see this
This is your more exotic dirty magazine
Yes
James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me
Oh yes
Very arousing women
They arouse me very much
But not as arousing as you
She goes for this line
Gives in
Oh Jim
She grabs him
Starts caressing his body
'  - / Yes
-  - #1 Alright, dude
- #1 He's re-engaging
goes up as the guys
'  - Groping
They're tangled in each other
Nadia backs off for a moment
Slowly, teasing, she hooks her thumbs in the sides of her panties
Starts sliding them down
So, "shaved" is the expression
on Jim as his eyes bug out
Yep, it is, and she is
(mutters) Holy shit
'  - Holy shit
- (unison) '  - Jim is stuck
Staring at Nadia
She moves towards him
Nadia is inches from his face
Touch me Jim
here
Jim is trembling, straining with himself
shudder runs through him
And it's over, again
'  - The girls are  again
Again
'  - Not again
'  - No, not again
(sighs) am sorry, Jim
suppose we will not be doing any studying now
No
've got
reserve reserves
Nadia starts getting dressed
Jim is whimpering
It is too bad
was at first hoping you would ask me to the prom
But
She gathers her things
Eyes Jim over
(cont'd) You should change your shorts
okay
Jim is stunned
Ruined
Nadia exits
on Jim's tormented face as we hear
"You have lost your internet connection
Click 'okay' to reconnect
" -  - Jim is walking through the courtyard, a bit dazed pass by him, giggling
He trudges along
noticing a    staring at him as he passes by
and Stoner #1 giving him a peace sign
and the Computer Nerd staring at him like a celebrity
Jim's pace slows
He hears a  behind him
he slows even more, taking very careful steps
as he sees a doing a really strange dance -- and his eyes pop out as he sees that, yes, it's his dance
He stops is staring at him
Jim pulls his coat up over his face and hurries off into the school, like a fugitive avoiding the media
People  and
-   - Kevin and Oz catch up to Jim
Here and there, people still give Jim funny looks
Hey, minuteman
Shut up
You're supposed to be supportive
You've still got a chance with Nadia, right
No
Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net
don't think they liked it
How do you know that
She's already on a plane back home
Kevin winces
(cont'd) You know, maybe 'm just not good with girls, period
Like  was born without that part of the brain mean,  can't talk to girls
And when do talk to them,  screw it up
Yeah
Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good
Jesus, Kevin, rub it in
nearby   starts  at Jim as he walks by
-  - Jim sits, waiting for class to start
Miserable
Some students are obviously talking about him in the background
Others study and chat
Next to Jim is Michelle -- the reject, band dork that we've seen earlier
She's got a flute case on her desk
She's blabbering to Jim
The kind of blabbering where every other sentence sounds like a question, even though it isn't
And so, one time
was at band camp
And we weren't supposed to have pillow fights
But we had a pillow fight
And it was so much fun
Jim couldn't care
(cont'd) And one time, we all lost our music
And we were supposed to play this song
But we didn't know it
So we just made it up
And we kept playing and playing but the conductor didn't know what we were doing and it was so funny
Jim looks wistfully over at Nadia's empty desk
(cont'd) So you're pissed about something, huh
You know what  do when 'm angry just play some Bach on my flute
It's so relaxing
learned to do that at band camp
Jim perks up the slightest bit
Hold on
You have no idea why 'm angry
Is it because we have a test tomorrow
Sometimes  get cranky when  know have a big test to study for
Yeah, that's pretty much it
thought so
Because, one time was at this -- (interrupting) What was your name again
Michelle
Okay
Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom
Really
You seriously want to go with me
(so forced) Yes
Seriously
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards
That would be so cool
Whatever you want
Cool
We're gonna have so much fun
It's like this one time, at band camp
-  - Heather is walking down the hall
She turns to go into the Little Auditorium -- and through the window in the door she sees Oz
She stops
Oz is singing, working through the solo
Determined to get it right
He bounces his lacrosse ball off the floor, in rhythm, keeping time
There's one point that he keeps getting stuck at and going back over
Heather watches this, softening as she sees that Oz is actually putting his heart into it
Finally he's frustrated -- Dammit
He whips the lacrosse ball at the wall
Heather recoils, still watching, unseen by Oz
After a moment, Oz cools off
He gets the ball, and diligently starts up again
Heather is impressed
'  - Vicky is doing calculus homework, as Kevin looks on, rubbing her shoulders
You're not doing the extra credit problems
No, 'm not
'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like 'm doing the extra credit problems
Mr
Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April
That's my trick
It's everyone's trick, Kevin
(she turns to him) But  did pick it up from you
She gives him a little kiss on his hand, continuing with her work
Kevin keeps rubbing her back, more serious
We've come a long way since Homecoming
(playful) Yeah, we have
You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five
Indeed  did
But, our relationship
It's progressed a lot
It's time for us to
express ourselves in new ways
Vicky stops working and turns, sitting up on the desk, facing him
Her mood has shifted, more romantic
Like how
Well,  feel that
things are getting to that point in a relationship
When two people share
a special moment between them
think you're so right, Kevin
(pause) You want to do it
Yes -- She takes his hand
Readies herself, and declares
(') love you
Kevin falters
This is definitely not what he was expecting
He's caught
Trying to formulate a response
(') Kevin
Do you not love me
No,  don't not love you
like, know that we've definitely got something between us
Something good
Something special
But you don't love me
didn't say that
mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around
People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what
It's like they call it off, going " was wrong
" beat
Vicky seems to know where he's coming from
Kevin
you're not your dad
The two of us, we're not your parents
know, Vick
'm just not ready yet, okay
Okay
- Oz is closing up the store
He looks up to see Heather at the door
Oz goes and opens it, surprised, embarrassed
The air is awkward between them
Hi
How did you know  was here
Stifler told me
You talked to Stifler
Well
needed to find you
We are gonna have to practice that song
okay
Cool then
'm um, 'm glad you came by
mean, really
She smiles
Oz lets her in
So you like, work nights
An uncomfortable moment for Oz
Uh
my dad's the manager
Really
Cool
Tell him his subs are great
Ah, he's always too heavy on the vinegar
If you really want a good one, you gotta let me make it
-  - Oz is behind the counter
Heather walks down the other side as Oz assembles a sub
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff
and  fill in once a week so he can get a night off
(pause) That's nice
(shrugs) So you're going to Michigan
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern
didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do --  mean, how am  supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was
So when my of  acceptance came in December, said the hell with it
Onions
What
You want onions
Oh, yeah
So what're you gonna major in
Well, State's got a good business school
And  can probably walk onto the lacrosse team
Green peppers
Yeah
So wow, you've got it figured out
(dismissive) Well,  mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am gonna be, a pro lacrosse player really have no idea
Oh thank God,  thought  was the only one
Well, you're not
Oil and vinegar
Yeah
You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in
" And  don't know
And they're like, "You'll figure it out
"  Yeah
When
know
Salt and pepper
Sure
Oz cuts the sub in half with a flourish and puts it on a tray
(') So we're gonna be close next year
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor
(smiles) yeah
beat
a little uncomfortable, but nice
Wanna swap your chips for cookies
-  - The remains of a couple subs are on a table
Oz and Heather are doing their song
it's rough, but they're working through it
And when they're in sync, they sound really good together
We    as they sing into the night
-   - talks to Stifler
'm sorry,  really can't go with you
'm holding out for someone else
You gotta be fucking kidding
know it's a long shot, but  figure Paul Finch might ask me
Oh gosh,  forgot -- you uh, you look okay
mean you can't even tell
Flustered, she heads down the stairs
Stifler, entirely confused, heads off into the second floor
As the Girl Holding Out For Finch descends, Kevin catches up with her
Hey
what was that all about
He's still embarrassed because Finch kicked his ass
Knocked out a tooth, but you can't see it
Right, and who told you that
-  - Kevin is talking to
She points offscreen
-  - Kevin is talking to
Taking notes
-   - Kevin is talking to
We see that his notepad is a spiderweb of girl's names, all interlinked with arrows
They all point to one girl's name in the center of the page -- Jessica
-  - Kevin follows Jessica down the cafeteria line
No comment
No comment
Are you kidding me
've never seen someone's image change so
so drastically
Thanks
It was my idea
Did you guys hook up or something
Are you kidding
No
Then what the hell are you talking about
Well
guess it's okay for me to tell you now
That reputation of his isn't going anywhere
(then) Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, need help with this, blah blah, etcetera
"  So  told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and 'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed
So he did, and  did
don't get it, that really works
Duh
Of course
Naturally, embellished a little bit
Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman
Kevin is speechless
(') No
Damn, that one was my favorite
- ' /  - Toweled guys exit the steamy showers, doing a macho They exit frame, and we remain on the showers, to hear -- (singing happily) needed the shelter of someone's arms
there you were -- woo-hoo- hoo
He exits in a towel and goes to his locker, next to Stifler
(') (still singing) needed someone to understand my ups and my downs, oh baby there you were
Stifler is staring at Oz, horrified
Oh my fucking God
You're gay
(cheery) Come on, you know the words, sing along
No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week
If you try that at this Saturday, 'm pretending  don't know you
Oz stops
Our last game is this Saturday
No shit
- ,   - Heather is studying outside
Oz stands before her, breathless, his hair still wet
've got this lacrosse game
It's really important, it's our last game
And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so  really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game might be able to stop by
(pause) You can't sing at the competition
'm sorry,  totally spaced just
didn't realize it
(upset but trying to be cool) it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy
Alright
yeah
thanks for understanding
(a beat) So  guess
'll see you later
An uncomfortable moment
Oz walks off
Heather looks let down
-     - Kevin is at his locker, getting ready for class
Stifler comes running up with a wicked grin on his face
Kevin
You seen Shitbreak lately
(immediately sensing danger) Oh no, Stifler, what did you do
Me
Nothing
'm the one whose ass he kicked
(off Kevin's look) 'll tell you one thing, though don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore
Stifler pulls out an empty bottle of , maniacally
-  - Finch is sitting at a table, reading his paper
Kevin comes tearing around the corner and runs up to him
Finch
Get to the bathroom
Now
Easy, tiger
What's in there
Just go
Why is this
You're gonna shit your pants
Charming
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever
It's fast acting mean really fast
First of all, it's Mocha ccino, and secondly
Oohhhh
Finch jumps up and sprints down the hallway
-   - We  with Finch
We see Stifler down the hall, holding open the bathroom door like a pleasant doorman
This way, sit
Finch darts into the bathroom
Stifler hysterically
-  - Finch leaps into a stall and slams the door behind him
-   - Finch has stopped
He's staring down at the toilet
It looks entirely uninviting
But he's straining, struggling, starting to dance around, moaning as he cramps up
He grabs a length of toilet paper and lines the seat with it
Then another, and another
Sweat drips off his forehead
Come on come on come on
He's got the seat lined with at least three layers of toilet paper
Notices a spot where there's still bare toilet seat
He tears off one square of toilet paper, placing it on the spot
He steps back and looks it over, still wriggling to contain his bowels
(') Okay
You can do this
He unbuckles his pants
Sits down -- just as we hear someone enter the bathroom
Finch, still restraining, listens for a moment
only to hear the -- of heels
-   - The bathroom door swings closed to reveal the universal symbol for "Women
"  Stifler is there,  even harder
-   - Finch is terrified
Through the crack between the stall door and the frame, Finch catches glimpses of bright colored skirts and dresses
He grits his teeth, straining
And a  comes from Finch's stomach
His eyes bulge
-  - is at the mirror, including the Girl Holding Out for Finch, fixing their hair
You know it's just gonna be some crappy band and stupid decorations
#2 You're just saying that cause prom's a week away and you don't have a date
No,  don't want a date
(increasingly dreamy) Finch is going stag
and so am the guy is like so
debonair
-   - Finch is in hell
Desperately trying not to shit
Holding it in for all he's worth
- #2 Do you think that "older woman" thing is true
#3 Of course, it was Stifler's mom
-   - Pure agony
Finch is sweating badly
Every muscle in his body is tensed
Tears stream from his fiercely shut eyes
gastric
Finch's eyes flash open in terror
-  - We hear another, deeper
Girl #2 turns to her friend in surprise
#2 Joanie, was that you
-   - Finch is struggling
Rocking back and forth
But it's no use
He's at his limit
Aaaaaaarrrgghhhh
-  - The girls at the mirror freeze -- and we hear what can only be the    exploding into a toilet bowl
The girls run out  and
-  -  - Finch exits the stall with trepidation, pulling up his pants
Slowly, slinking, he approaches the door
Grabs the handle
Composes himself
And like nothing ever happened, he opens it
-   - Finch comes out of the bathroom
Stops
His eyes register complete disbelief
-  , including the ones we have seen gossiping about him, has crowded around the door
All staring at him with complete repugnance, open-mouthed
: () - Oz is playing in the final lacrosse game
The team scores -- they're beating Central
Everyone cheers, except Oz
We see Jim and Kevin in the stands,
() - Establishing
The campus of Michigan State University
Students pass in front of an older, impressive university building
sign out front reads, " " () - Heather and the rest of the vocal jazz group are behind the curtain
They all wear flashy, borderline cool outfits
Heather looks worried, lost
Looking to the door, as if Oz might come running in
Okay
Albert, you ready
steps next to Heather
He's kind of funny- looking, with an overly-suave attitude that comes off as plain weird
No problemo
He  a couple lines
Way too melodramatic and cheesy
Heather looks trapped
() - scoreboard shows that East is leading by five goals
Oz is running up the field, towards the goal, cradling the ball in his stick
He seems to have a good lead
Suddenly he is tumbling, falling, losing the ball
Someone has checked him
He lays stunned on the ground, as Stifler recovers the ball and scores
The players run back to the sidelines to reset for the face-off, and gather around the coach
Alright
Good hustle, guys, but we can still lose
You all saw what happened to Oz out there
don't ever want to see you guys thinking you're gonna score
You don't score until you score, period
The team is getting into it
Shouts of "Hell yeah
"  But Oz's got a quizzical look on his face
() - Heather waits with the group to go onstage
Albert paces like a Shakespearean actor, psyching himself
Focus on the music
Think melody
Let the music be my guide
That would be a start
() - Oz shows some emotion peeking through
Confused
It all boils down to today
For you seniors, this marks the culmination of your past four years
Think of what that means to you
Are you guys gonna look back on your days at East and know that you made the most of the time you had
wave of realization washes over Oz
He stands up tall
(cont'd) Now that's the attitude, Ostreicher
Oz collects himself
Takes a deep breath
Good luck, guys
he sets his lacrosse stick down and starts to leave
Christ
didn't say you were out of the game
Sorry, coach
What the fuck is this
You got someplace more important to be
Coach Marshall is fuming
The entire team is staring at Oz
Yeah
He runs off
beat of confusion
Then they stand up
- Oz runs through a gate
- The vocal jazz group is on their feet, lined up, waiting to go onstage
Oz bursts into the room, still in his lacrosse gear
Oz -- You're back -- Yeah -- -- Oh, great
Oz rushes up to Heather
She's happy but confused
What about the game
'm not playing
You're missing the game for us
No
'm missing the game for you
Heather melts
Oz pulls her close
And they kiss
Okay, okay
You guys got about a minute to go
Spend it warming up, not making out
This ain't the prom yet
Oz and Heather share a smile
- The vocal jazz group is belting their hearts out, singing "How Sweet It Is
"  Oz sings with them now in his vocal jazz outfit
we   to see he's still wearing his cleats
He and Heather sound great, backed by the vocal jazz group
They sail through their duet, join hands, and finish perfectly
The audience  with enthusiasm -- and we Kevin and Jim, , loving it, like they're at a rock concert
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww
(gives that "You rock
" hand sign) You fuckin' rule
-  - Class has just ended, students are filing out of the classroom
teacher grades papers in the back of the room, routinely writing ", -, , -" on each paper
Vicky is studying a pull-down map hanging over the chalkboard
Kevin comes up next to her
Hey
Did you know that it's
450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville
It's like a six or seven hour drive
That's easy,  don't mind driving
beat
Kevin looks back over his shoulder to the inattentive teacher
Moves closer to Vicky
(') About the other day
've been thinking
So have
And  know you want to make things perfect for me
And understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it
Vicky looks over to the teacher, who
She steps closer
Kevin, somewhat nervous, takes the bottom of the map, fidgeting with it a little
(') And  want to make things perfect for you
You're right, Kev, we do have something good
and special
Yeah, we have something great, Vick
Kevin
(very close, whispered) want to have sex with you
The map goes  upwards
The teacher looks up
(almost frightened) Now
No
know the perfect time
She looks to the calendar on the wall
and taps next Saturday -- "Prom
"  Kevin can't believe it for -  -- - Jim is trying on a tux
he shrugs, like it fits well enough
He turns to see Oz trying on his -- Oz is fidgeting, trying on different ties, vests, shoes, very sincere and focused
'  - Vicky is trying on a rather elegant dress, looking to Jessica for support, showing it off
Jessica jokingly does the same, showing off her shorts and -shirt, as if she could care
-  - Finch sits alone
Not like alone
More like Forrest Gump
- Jim is paying for his tux
We see Oz trying to decide on a cumberbund
There are about ten of them scattered around him that he's already tried
In the background, an  looks impatient
-  - Finch still sits
His head is cocked at a different angle
'  -   - Jim's dad fixes Jim's bow tie
'  -  ( ) Kevin is in his tux
He's staring at himself in the mirror
- The parking lot is full make their way into the school
One group piles out of a stretch limo
We see a   slip a bottle of liquor into his tux
struggles to re-attach his date's corsage
This is the prom
-  - The gym is decorated in a clashingly festive manner
Like a combination of Mardi Gras, New Year's Eve, and somebody's bar mitzvah
plays Most students mill about, talking, generally bored
The only people who are enjoying themselves are the , slam-dancing with the obviously drunk Stifler in a corner
try to calm them down, futilely
The band breaks into a
Couples lock together and sway back and forth like zombies
They're dancing at arm's length
Jim is not enthused
You know, at band camp
We have dances like this
Only they're way funner
Don't you think prom is just highly overrated
Highly, highly overrated
They dance
Both looking a little nervous
Anxious
Dancing much slower than anyone else
Tight embrace
Heather's got her head on his shoulder, eyes closed
Dancing with the Girl Holding out For Finch
-      - Kevin, Oz, Jim, and Finch are hanging out
Finch is drunk
Okay
'm here for your dumb
dumb meeting
Sherman passes by
'm on the offensive, boys
The Sherman Tank is going back in
The guys are impassive
Sherman indicates the Central Girl nearby
(') Locked on target, flying in stealth mode under enemy sex radar
Ready to drop the payload
again Sherman confidently walks off
Alright, how do you guys stand
Well, Finch,  know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse
Jim
My date's a flute-toting band dork
That answer your question
Oz, how about you and Heather
Now you guys are a couple or something
(getting ticked) Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude
Attitude
Me
think that you guys should be more enthusiastic
Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for
We're in this together
Don't back out on me now
Back out
You don't need us to get laid
You afraid or something
No, but come on guys, we made a pact
Kevin, it was just a -- It was a pact You break it and there are no excuses
You guys have to -- (interrupting, pissed) don't have to do shit
Forget it already
Kevin is taken aback
(cont'd) 'm tired of all this bullshit pressure
mean, 've never even had sex and already  can't stand it hate sex
don't want it, 've never wanted it, and 'm not gonna sit here busting my balls over something that just isn't that damn important
So fuck this stupid pact, fuck you , and fuck sex
Now, 'm gonna go hang out with that geek over there, 'cause at least she's got something else to talk about besides sex
God damn
Kevin storms off
beat
At least  learned how to shit in school
Jessica approaches
She's dressed well, but not lavishly
Hey, Finch
Wanna dance
Finch looks to the guys
They shrug
We Jessica and Finch as they dance out onto the floor
How come you have no date
like to keep my options open
And let me just clarify that you have no chance of scoring with me, Finch
No, of course not, don't be ridiculous
So,  guess you and Sherman are pretty close
You met at that party a while back
Yeah, we were up the whole night together
We had one of those amazingly deep conversations, where you really feel like you get to know someone
(nudge, nudge) "Deep conversation," huh
Is that what you guys call it
What else would  call it
- Kevin sits on the steps into the school, depressed
-  - The Central Girl has taken over the band's microphone
Excuse me, everyone, sorry to interrupt
Her voice reverberates throughout the gym
couple - (cont'd) just wanted to let you all know this:  Chuck Sherman is a liar never had sex with him
He's never had sex with anyone --  know because he told me
Once, he tried to screw a grapefruit, but that's it
Oh, and he also told me that sometimes when he gets nervous he wets his pants
Thank you for your attention
Girls around the gym  and
Pissing his pants
Shocked
He looks back to Oz, who shares his expression
- Kevin still sits there
Jim, Oz, and Finch come out of the school
Slowly they walk up to Kevin
Guess what
don't care
Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon
'm not going
beat as the guys don't know what to say
Kevin's speech is halting, downbeat
(') This isn't how  wanted things to turn out
Making the pact wasn't just about getting laid
It was about doing one last thing with you guys before we graduated
But now 've just wasted my last few weeks here trying to do what
don't even know
All  managed to do was fuck up our friendship
beat
Oz shrugs
still think you're okay
So do , Kev
Me too
For the most part
Nah
Fuck, you guys are right, don't know what 'm doing
mean 'm acting like 've got it all together tonight
But  know Vicky is gonna ask me if  love her
And  don't know what 'm gonna say
So now it's like, maybe 'll just wimp out on the whole thing
Come on man
Tonight is the night
We're finally going to a post-prom party on the lake
We've been waiting to do this for the last four years
Why else are we still friends with Stifler
You gotta go
beat as Kevin ponders this
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid
He didn't
Nope
He pissed himself
The guys  as Kevin is puzzled
are suddenly illuminated by the glare of headlights
charter bus pulls in front of the school
There it is
want to grab my bag
Oh, and my date
Come on, Kevin
Vicky's looking for you
Jim holds out a helping hand
Kevin looks at it
Grabs it, and Jim pulls him up
'  - beautiful cottage on the shore of Lake Michigan
Students are filing out of the charter bus
Jim and Michelle are walking up to the cottage
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce
It reminds me of this one time -- (changing thoughts) Hey, can  ask you a question
How come you don't have any stories
've got lots of stories, and you don't have any
Oh, 've got stories, believe me
They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff
Tell me
Okay
You want a story
Here's a story
Stifler finds this beer, right
And
'  - Kevin leads Vicky into the bedroom
large bay window overlooks moonlit Lake Michigan
See -- this is the nicest room
Wow, Kev
it's perfect
Vicky opens a closet -- to find Stifler's Little Brother inside, grinning
' You guys are gonna fuck, aren't you
No
Get out of here
' (running out of the room) Fuckers fuckers fuckers fuckers
Stiflers brother is gone
They
and Vicky closes the door
- Oz and Heather are walking down the beach
Holding hands
Deep in the background, we see kids partying
There's something 've been meaning to tell you, Heather
What's that
It's gonna sound really bad, but want you to know
She nods
They stop walking
Oz swipes his feet around in the sand
(cont'd) See, uh, 'm a virgin
And me, Kevin, Jim, and Finch, we all made this pact
That we would
lose our virginity
before high school was over
Heather is listening
(cont'd) And, see, tonight is supposed to be the night we all do it
This isn't the best way to proposition me
No, that's not what  mean
mean -- look
You know what made me leave that game
Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score
This isn't any better, Chris
No, see Heather, what  realized is that
with you, it's not like 'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score
And this may sound corny, but -- He takes her hand
(cont'd) feel like 've already won
Heather softens, taken off guard
(cont'd) And, well,  really care about you lot
And  want you to know that
Oz, it's okay,  know
You called me Oz
Well, that's what your friends call you
mean
feel like 'm one of your friends now
and also
your girlfriend
Oz seems truly touched
Dieter
My middle name is Dieter
Heather nods, and speaks pensively
Hmm
You know that's (cracking up) really a shitty middle name
(laughing) know, it sucks
Through their laughter, they kiss
After a moment, it grows more passionate
Lost in each other
'  -  - The party rages in the rest of the cottage, but the basement is empty
'  sits in the corner, smoking a cigarette
She's as attractive as her photo we once saw, but the divorce has replaced her sexy smile with a bitter smirk
Finch stumbles in
Ah, Stifler's mom
Thank you for letting us have a great party
' (dry) As if there were any alternative in the matter
Are you enjoying yourself
'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am
' (deadpan) 'm so happy for you
Takes the edge off, doesn't it
And where might your date be
Oh no, no date
Bathroom incident
' Pardon me
Finch pauses a moment
He's got an idea
Nevermind
You have anything to drink
' believe the kegs are upstairs
No, no, that's what the cretins drink
mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff
She considers him as she drags off her cigarette
' All right,  got some scotch
Single malt
' Aged eighteen years
(she gives him a look) Why don't you get the glasses
Behind the bar
'  -   - It's a great party
Stifler is with a group of guys drinking a beer, which he inspects very carefully before every sip
Both drinking and talking, almost enjoying themselves
That is a nasty story
told you
You wanna hear a nasty story of mine
It's kind of sexual
Ding
light goes off in Jim's head
Yeah, bring it on
Well, this one time
At band camp
We were playing this game,  don't know if you know it
But it's called spin the bottle
And  had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips
And
Jim's expression sinks
'  -  - The lights are down
Vicky and Kevin are in bed
You comfortable
Yeah, are you
Yeah
beat
You sure you're comfortable
Yeah
Are you sure
Yeah
Me too
Okay
(a beat) Did you bring a condom
Yeah, right here
He pulls out a condom
beat as they contemplate it
(') So, do you want to be --  mean, how do you want to do it
don't know
How do you
Like, normal style
The
missionary position
Okay
moment as they realize there's nothing left to do, but - (cont'd) Kevin
Yeah Vick
want to hear you say it
Okay
Kevin swallows hard
And says -- (') Victoria
love you
love you
They both take a deep breath
- Oz and Heather lay in a secluded spot in the dunes, surrounded by tall beach grass that swishes in the spring breeze
Stars and a lustrous moon above
The silence speaks
We can see it in their eyes
Yearning
can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy
Then don't
They kiss
It's time
'  -  - brief moment of uncertainty
Kevin shifts around a bit, trying to position himself
Vicky's hand goes under the sheets
Here
We know what she's doing
They both maintain eye contact
- Heather and Oz are re-inventing the idea of passion
Discovering love
This is the stuff that you thought only existed in romance novels
Seriously
'  -   - Jim is trying to stay interested in Michelle's drivel
So, the end of the story is
you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds
Yes
And he was such a dork
And everyone laughed at me, but  didn't care
Because it was so funny
(flat) Okay,  get it
Oh
And then this one time
At band camp
stuck a flute in my pussy
Jim  on his beer
Michelle considers her revelation no big deal, watching with some amusement as Jim struggles to recover
excuse me
What, you think  don't know how to get myself off
Hell, that's what half of band camp is
Sex ed
Jim is ga-ga
He watches in disbelief as she lets her hair down
And wouldn't you know it, she's pretty cute
(cont'd) So are we gonna screw soon
'm getting kind of antsy
Jim pauses in disbelief
Then -- '  - ' '  - Michelle and Jim burst in and slam the door
toy basketball hoop falls off the back of the door
They are standing in a cluttered, toy-strewn, pit of a kid's room
One of those stupid plastic airplanes on a string hangs from the ceiling, flying in circles
This'll do
Now,  have two rubbers
Wear them both, it'll desensitize you
don't want you coming so damn early
Why, uh, what makes you think that  -- Come on
saw you on the net
Why do you think  accepted this date
You're a sure thing
Jim heartily agrees
'  -  - The scotch bottle is almost empty
Stifler's Mom and Finch are smoking cigarettes
So
would you object if  said you're quite striking
' Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me
Yes ma'am,  am
One look between them, and we know it's all over
'  -  - Kevin and Vicky
Silently doing it
Curious looks on their faces
The look you get when your waiter delivers your food in a fancy restaurant, and you look at the creation on the plate, and secretly you're not sure if it's really what you ordered
But you don't say anything, and you just eat it
- Oz and Heather
Souls entwined
Making love
'  - ' '  - We can hear Jim and Michelle going at it like a couple of over a   : --  piggy bank gets knocked over and shatters
-- An x-wing fighter flies across the room
--  pillow explodes in a cloud of feathers
-- One of the legs on the bed breaks
'  -    - The Basement door is closed
We hear from the inside
'  (
) had no idea you'd be this good
(
) Neither did
'  - ' '  - Jim and Michelle going at it
Again, we  but can't see them
The room is more trashed than before
And as we  across the disaster area they've created -- (
) Are you gonna do what  think you're gonna do
(
) Don't you want me to
(
) Oh yeah
Put it in your mouth
(
) Okay
We see her
on top of Jim
She clears her throat
And then we see her raise a children's plastic recorder to her lips -- and she whistles
On cue, Jim chimes in -- Hail, hail, to Michigan, the leaders and best
- Oz could be coming
Heather could be coming
But it's all so darn passionate that the whole thing looks like one big orgasm anyway
'  - ' '  - Jim and Michelle lay on the floor, tangled in sheets and each others' clothing
Exhausted, gasping
And then we see the closet door is open, just a crack
It swings open
Standing there is Stifler's Little Brother
Jaw hanging
' That was awesome Jim and Michelle are stunned
'  -  - Finch and Stifler's Mom are just off-camera
We can't see it, but we can tell Finch's status from his What we do see is the kitchen door handle rattling
The chair falling out of place
And the door opening as Stifler walks in
He stops, horrified
Ugh
oh no
He looks like he's going to barf
Instead, he passes out
'  -  - The sun rises over Lake Michigan
brand new day
Various students are passed out here and there
- Oz holds Heather in his arms
Completely peaceful
to each other
on the shore
Oz has lost all pretense
Smiling to himself, or maybe to the world
'  - ' '  - Jim wakes up in bed, alone
He looks around
She's gone
He considers this
(cont'd) Oh my God
She used me
He considers this further
Smiles
(cont'd) Wow
was used
Cool
He jumps up and does a little dance,
(') Hail
to the victors, valiant; Hail
to the conquering heroes, hail
'  -  - Kevin and Vicky lie next to each other in bed, staring at the ceiling
Though they're trying to conceal it, we can see a bit of dissatisfaction, uncertainty, peeking through
That was a great night
Yeah
beat
can't believe we just had our senior prom
Yeah, the time went by so fast
It did
Another beat
Kevin, next year
with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville
it's not gonna work, is it
Don't say that, we can do it somehow
It might not be perfect, but -- (interrupting) No, Kevin -- (she sits up) That's the whole thing, that's what 've been realizing
That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything
Kevin thinks this over
It is far away
and we'll be on our own
meeting new people
moment as they think this over
(') Vicky
last night
wasn't lying
know
(a beat) Let's go
Don't you have something to tell your friends
What
Your little pact
Jessica told me all about it
(hits him lightly) Way to go, Kev
Kevin gives an embarrassed smile
: - sign on the window reads, "Congratulations Seniors
" - The four, newly non-virgins munch on hot dogs
Kevin's (to Jim) guess we'll call you two-ply
Yeah
So you want double condiments on that
No, no that's fine
(then, to Kevin) So you doing okay
(a wistful smile) Yeah
'll tell you, 've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age
(a beat) Of course,  have no frame of reference for this comparison
So Oz, you almost made it, huh
(smiles) 'll just say that we had a great night together
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there
know
Wow
You two really have something going, don't you
think we're falling in love
They
Oz just smiles
You know what the coolest thing is
This, right now
They guys keep eating, uncertain what to say
It's true
mean, after this, everything'll be different
After getting laid
After high school
Yeah, but we'll still see each other
Fuck yeah we will
beat
Kevin raises his Pepsi
To the next step
To the next step
They all toast
'  - Kevin is on the phone
(into phone) Hey
got another question for you
'  (
) What's that
-    - Kevin arrives in the back of the library
Kneels down to put the bible back
(
) Um
'm sort of wondering about
love
We hear Kevin's Brother  knowingly
'  (
) That's the next book, Kevin
That's the next book
He puts the bible back without the reverence he once had for it
Stands up with some new confidence
We as he walks out of the library
and enters the courtyard, crowded with students
He disappears into them as we
'  - Jim's dad sits across from Jim
' (eyes tearing) Son
That's the best damn story ever heard
Jim beams proudly
'  (') You know, after  graduated high school, my parents let me do some traveling
:  ",  " ascends a beautiful, red-carpeted staircase, carrying a tray with bottle of champagne and a rose
He arrives in front of a hotel door passes by, noticing the waiter
And ,
(subtitled) Another bottle
(subtitled) He knows how to treat a woman
The door opens -- to reveal Jim, sweaty but not the least bit tired, tying on a robe
Thanks guys
pair of arms wraps around him from behind
And -- Nadia peeks her head over Jim's shoulder
Come back to bed, James
Jim smiles to the guys and takes the tray, as Nadia pulls him back in and closes the door
(subtitled) That is one lucky man
(subtitled) Funny --  swear  have seen those two somewhere before
The boy is some sort of dancer
They head off
