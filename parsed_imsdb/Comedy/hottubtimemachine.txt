(
) Ready for the wildest bachelor party of all time
(early 30s, shirt and jeans, hot in a smart and classy sense) walks in the room, smiling
You know it
'm gonna bang all sorts of chicks this weekend
That's not the answer  was looking for
Sorry, honey
Adam gives his beautiful fiancee a playful kiss
She shows him some
Look what  found

Check out that young stud
Can you believe he's about to get married
Lily and Adam look through more  of a   (17) partying at a   with his : -- In full 80s   on a mountain

Nothing happened

Lily laughs
Adam, you didn't know me yet
As Adam goes back to packing, Lily leafs through some more of the photos
She stops at one and her
(') Who's this
Lily shows Adam a : --      (23, blonde, svelte, leg warmers)
'm not sure
Really
Lily shows Adam another : --   with his arm around the  , who looks like she was ambushed for the photo

Oh
Jennie
Who's Jennie
She's nobody
Ski instructor
(off her look) You didn't know me yet
Lily still looks at him a little hard
(') Lily,  was 17
She had boobs and a face
Of course 'm gonna take her picture
Lily still looks a little bothered
Do you still think of her
Of course not
think of you
As Adam goes to  her: Hold on
Lily goes into the
Sweetie
She comes out a moment later with a  , which she empties onto the
About    spill out, ranging from   to
(') How did you know where  hid my
treasure
Lily carefully picks up a  from the pile, holding it by the corner, not wanting to touch it
Explain this
From ' , we see the brochure: --  ski brochure featuring Jennie on the cover
4
You caught me occasionally
reminisce
about Jennie 'Keefe
That's gross
() What's "occasionally
" (without missing a beat) About two hours ago when you were on the phone with your mother
Jesus
Tell me how 'm supposed to let you go to your bachelor party and not be a basket case
What are you so worried about
'm worried that you're still thinking about this girl
Baby, the girl in that picture was nothing more than a crush
could never get her and there's no possibility 'll ever be with her
She was a total stranger
Lily gets a   on her face
So
you're into strangers
Well not the creepy "your mom was in an accident, now come with me" kind
But yeah, the hot lady in the supermarket kind of stranger
You have to admit - it's kinda hot
So you're saying if you and didn't know each other, it would be pretty hot if we fooled around
You kidding me
It would be fucking incredible
5
Lily smiles seductively, as Adam starts to get it
(') Wait a minute
Are you suggesting
yes
Adam excitedly heads for the door
(') , 'll go down the hall
You get into character
(points at her) This fucking rules
Adam leaves the room and Lily   , talking sexy and slowly building the fantasy
Oh 'm all alone in this big house
Cheerleading camp just ended and need to get out of these sweaty clothes
(
) Love where you're going with this, baby
Keep it up
She unbuttons her pants and
Mmmm
My panties are so tight against my firm naked body
(
) You should probably take them off
Are you gonna let me do this
(
) Sorry
Continue
You were just about to take off your panties
She slowly slides out of her panties, kicking them away
Now she's
She continues to role play
It feels so good to be so naked hope no one can see me
Just then a   (late 30s, handsome,  Crew) saunters through the bedroom door, holding a coffee and all riled up
6
, so this asshole in front of me at the donut place is --
Lily covers up and
Get out of here
He  the coffee on his hands and their rug as he turns
Fuck
Ow
'm sorry
'll clean it up
That's gonna stain, though
Just leave
He heads for the door, just as: Adam comes in, wearing a  hat and
Special delivery for -- Jesus Christ
The black man doesn't know which way to look
He covers his eyes and drips coffee, as he blindly steps toward the door
( ) Just tell me when 'm in the clear
: '  - Adam wheels his suitcase down the front path of this modest, well-kept suburban home, as a recovered, dressed, embarrassed and somewhat shell-shocked Lily follows with a small bag
They both stop 10 yards short of a  , where the black man, , waits in the car, waving
can't wait for you to come back and marry me
Wow, that's crazy
Adam looks almost like it just hit him
7
Yeah
() Wow
Tell me again  have nothing to worry about
Babe, look at Nick
In the car, Nick air drums to whatever's on the radio
(') You think with him in charge, we're gonna get into any kind of trouble
We'll probably eat too much pizza and 'll twist my ankle getting off the ski lift
Have an awesome bachelor party
Not too awesome
(hands him bag) got you something
Adam looks in the bag
Sandwich
Thanks
He puts it in his
She looks like she was expecting a different reaction, but she lets it go
He kisses her
Let me see your phone
He takes it out
told you, 'll call you when-- She snatches it out of his hands
Adam looks confused, as she pockets the phone
Despite my anxiety, 'm not gonna be one of those women who wants an update every ten minutes
Even though  do want an update every ten minutes
Adam smiles
Lily looks a bit trepidatious
8
(') Just make sure whatever happens, you're back for the rehearsal dinner
( ) totally trust you
You should
'm a lame-o
Well at least you're a cute lame-o
Lily leans in and they  their noses together in a disgusting display of affection
goes off
From the car, Nick holds up his iPhone
'm more than willing to forget about earlier, but this shit's going on Facebook
'  -  - Nick drives through , while Adam rides shotgun
have no idea what Facebook is
My phone has a button that says Send To Facebook
've been sending shit there for months
Adam looks out the window, smiling
'm so psyched about this weekend
Ditto, buddy
'm gonna help you make up for all the good times you missed when you were being a responsible member of society
You're a good friend
'm sorry for putting my career and self sufficiency above bowling night
This trip represents everything awesome about being a dude
() 9
(') We're gonna drink too much, eat whatever we want
() might not even change my socks
Live the dream
Best of all, we don't have to answer to anyone
Nick's  rings and he answers it with his built-in His phone voice is a little more "sensitive
" ( ) (') Hi honey
(
0
) Three goddamn bags of pretzels
( ) (trying to save face) 'm with Adam, honey
(
0
) Hi Adam
(a little calmer) Nick, what have  told you about buying snacks that aren't on sale
( ) You said not to do it
(
0
) And what did you do
( ) bought three bags of pretzels
But 'm gonna eat them
(
0
) That's not the point
() Don't do it again
Nick and Adam exchange an embarrassing glance
( ) (
0
) Call me from the road
Adam, say hi to Lily
10
( ) ,  sure wi-- For a moment, there is an uncomfortable silence
(') Don't her parents own the supermarket
The whole damn chain
() Just be thankful Lily doesn't have any family money
Nothing makes your dick softer
-- Nick's car pulls into the lot of a rundown motel

'  - Adam looks confused and slightly nervous
This looks like a place where people die
Mostly from murder
, miserable-looking  in his late 30s () exits a room, carrying
He gets in the back seat
Adam looks happy to see him
(') Lou
Yes, 'm living in a transient motel
Let's get that purple elephant out of the room
Dude, it looks nice
Thank you
hate your guts
(re: the bags) What'd you bring
11
All my belongings
So you're sorta like a bum now, huh
In a sense
'  -  - Lou sits in the backseat, voraciously eating a bowl of cereal, as the other guys are up front
Our system is fucked, gentlemen
You tell me how a whore wife can fuck some black dude - no offense - and still take her cuckold of a husband for all he's got
Why would  take offense to that
It's offensive
Because he's black
And because he's fucking my wife
And because you're black
And because of all the oversensitive horrible garbage
you know what
Forget no offense
Just offense
Are you offended
Not really
Then shut the fuck up
She's got a hell of an attorney
Yes and thank you so very much for giving her the referral
12
She told me it was for a friend
So
what
Your wife likes black dick now
'm gonna slaughter you in your sleep tonight
(turns to Lou, genuine) Thanks for coming, man
- Nick's car pulls up across from a nice apartment building, as a well-dressed, well-groomed, overly polished-looking in his 20s () comes out, carrying a
'  -- The guys watch Jacob carefully cross the street
Oh, Adam's stupid brother's coming
Boo
Drive away before he gets in the car
Be nice
know Jacob's kind of a douche, but 'm trying to be closer to him since Mom died
Jacob gets in the back next to Lou
( ) Hey buddy
How's it going
Good to see you
You look dirty and you smell bad
You look gay and you smell like a basket of fancy soaps
Advantage me
How is that to your advantage
13
He's not gay
He's just
what are you again
Metrosexual
You have sex with trains
For your information,  fuck chicks
Hot ones
For your information, you fuck dudes
Gay ones
Yeah, well at least 'm young and my life's full of potential hear you're homeless now
(to Nick and Adam) You told him
() hate all you people
Will you two please shake hands and make up
We're gonna be spending a lot of time together
Jacob distractedly  on his phone
Yeah, about that
Why aren't we going to Aspen
Vermont's lame
It's gonna be fun
Yeah, whatever
And with that, the guys travel in silence for a few moments, the lifeblood drained from the car
Finally
've gotta take a shit
14
- Lou walks from the bathroom back to the  where Adam, Nick, and Jacob sit and eat
That was an ugly experience
don't wanna hear about it
In a few years, when 'm dying of an exotic disease that causes my penis to bleed until it falls off, someone remember to tell the hospital to check out the filthy crapper at the Albany Rest Stop
It's the  monkey of toilets
The guys put down their sandwiches
Thank you
don't know how you're doing it, man
mean, Laurie's hot, don't get me wrong
() Lily
Right
Lily
But one vagina
Forever
That's the sacrifice
Jacob nods, agreeing with Lou's concern
And you're  with that
don't know your sexual history, but you sure you got it out of your system
did  for myself
He didn't do that well for himself
15
Yeah, isn't Lily your fourth
Fifth
Thank you
So you're averaging like one girl every eight years
Assuming  got laid when  was zero
That would be awesome
Adam gives Lou a distasteful look
'm fine
Maybe some cold feet, but that's normal
Thank you everyone for your concern
Just looking out for you
That's what brothers do, right
They look out for each other
(takes a moment) Is this about something else
Forget it
No, let's do this
'm sorry wasn't around when you were growing up,
was in college
And then  was working
Dad left
Someone had to take responsibility
Boooooring
( ) Shut up
said forget it
16
Guys, come on
Let's move past it
This is gonna be a fun weekend
still say Vermont sucks
You're confusing Vermont with yourself
This weekend is going to be incredible and you will not ruin it for me
(softens, to Jacob) You might like it
Havenhurst is pretty awesome
Jacob shrugs, but Lou gets excited
Fuck yeah it is
We're gonna ski the trail and bone some tail
() You'll have to bone some of that tail for me, man
Fuck that
You'll bone your own
No  won't
Adam, trust me
Biggest mistake of my life - not fucking a whore at my bachelor party
That's the biggest mistake of your life
Fuck yeah
And he's not making that same mistake
Uh
'm not having sex with anyone this weekend
Lou looks at Adam, trying to figure things out
17
Ohhhh
gotcha
() You're not having sex this weekend
'm not having sex this weekend
Without the winking
() Right
No winking
( ) understand
'm pretty sure you don't
/
'  -  - Nick's car transitions from the  to the  to the , as we track the drive
Finally, the car passes a "Welcome to Havenhurst" sign
Gentlemen
welcome to Havenhurst
Yes
- The car winds through the main thoroughfare
Rather than a quaint ski town, this place resembles a suburban nightmare, with   and
It's the exact opposite of the fun town we saw in Adam's photos
/
'  -  - The guys look out the windows, wearing bummed expressions
so this is the coolest town ever
Oh man
The Brew Haus is a Chang's
Lou notices a  Friday's, with a sign advertising a "Hannah Montana 3- Experience
" He looks utterly disgusted
18
don't even have the heart to tell you what  just fucking saw
But say goodbye to Papa Enzo's
This town sucks
What the fuck is going on
The car climbs a twisty part of the road
(') Please god let it still be there
What
Pink Paradise
Best strip club ever
The car rounds the corner and a  comes into view
The beginning reads "Pink
" Yes
It lives
The car continues to climb and the whole sign comes into view: "Pinkberry
" wanna die
() Sweet, there's a Pinkberry here
- The car pulls into the parking lot of this  lodge
/  - The guys walk in and the first thing they notice is a bunch of  that wander anywhere they want
The large "living room" area off the lobby features a that has been
and   lounge and cry and nap
19
( ) What have you done to us
'm not playing drinking games with my grandma
so the place skews a little older
Let's check in
We're not spending our time inside anyway
/  - The guys walk silently behind a -  (), who struggles to wrangle their bags on a shaky hand truck
His job is made more difficult because he only has
He grunts and curses his way down the hall on the slow and laborious journey
But when Adam tries to pick up a bag
() Hey buddy
'm not gonna tell you again
fuckin' got it
Adam backs off
This guy's a dick
-- No, fuck that
() He's a dick
Oooh tough guy
He's gotta be Mister America
Captain America
Go fuck yourself
Phil finally drops their bags at their room and then: 'm ready to be tipped
20
( ) You, sir, have no tact
Nick gives Phil a bill and he walks off down the hall, leaving the guys outside their room
Gentlemen
in this room lies the beginning of our awesome weekend
Or a continuation of everything that's sucked so far
Yeah,  bet it's gonna be lame as shit in there
The furniture probably smells like mold
say we go to Foxwoods
actually kinda like that idea
Guys
Everyone looks at Adam
(') Let's give it a chance
We don't know for sure that the room sucks
Nick nods, appreciating the optimism
He opens the door: /  - The room
The ancient furniture looks like it smells like mold and there is nothing redeemable about the place
() , so now we know
The guys drag their bags in and depressingly take stock of the situation -- presently the dirty old room
What the hell is with this place
21
It's like a Stephen King novel, except not as cool
We'll feel a lot better once we hit the slopes
() Plus,  know there's one thing to look forward to
/  - On a patio outside their suite, our guys stare at a - Spacious seating, plenty of jets, underwater lighting
It's amazing
Adam, Nick, and Lou look energized
Thank
God
At least some things never change
What's the big deal about a hot tub
Shame on you
There's plenty of time for tubbin'
Let's ski
- At the top of the mountain, Adam, Nick, and Lou look ridiculous in , -
Jacob, on a snowboard, is the only one dressed in current attire
(re: their outfits) When's the last time you guys actually went skiing
It's been a few years
think we look good
22
Then you're an idiot
All right, we race down the mountain
Loser buys first round
Premium shit only
You gonna be all right
What does that mean
dunno - do black dudes ski
Of course black dudes ski
Aren't wearing skis
'm just not sure you're representative
You're calling me an Uncle Tom
don't even know what that means
It means black dudes ski
(pulls down goggles) Catch ya at the bottom
Nick takes off and
gets about 15 , before he hits a and falls over
Black dudes don't ski
( ) How's the bottom
: : 23
,
: ,
,
- Nick wears his "going out clothes" and walks along the main drag talking into his
It is clear that he is being on the other end of the conversation
( ) No, the black ones
without the pleats
Because the pleats make me look fat
No,  put it on the Amex
Because 'm the best man
know, but 'm organizing
'm gonna get cash fr-- 'm gonna get-- 'm gonna collect cash from the guys
Yes
Yes
Yes
( ) love you too
Nick hangs up and we see that Adam, Lou, and Jacob have been walking with him, listening to his end of the conversation
() Dude
( ) , who's ready to sink their teeth into a delicious dinner
' - Our four guys looks , as they sit around a table at this popular Chinese food chain restaurant
Their overzealous  () makes a big production of , like he's Emeril
You fellas look like you can handle some spice
'm gonna knock it up a bit
throw some chili sauce in there
oh yeah, there it is
This is gonna knock your socks off
24
Nick's expression looks like he wants to kill the guy
Thank you
The waiter walks away and Nick    in a toast
(') 'd like to propose a toast
To my best friend, Adam
He may be throwing his life away, but at least he's throwing it away with a hot chick at his side
The guys  and clink glasses
(') And so what if you only have one vagina for the rest of your life
Speaking as someone who's seen your wife's vagina -- it's definitely one of the good ones
Lou and Jacob look confused, but clink glasses anyway, as Adam mouths "What the fuck" to Nick
Jacob raises his glass
To my brother,  say thank you for including me
promise to try to make the most of it
The guys look confused at the backhanded graciousness
Thanks for coming, man
It means a lot to me
Jacob nods halfheartedly
To Adam
To Adam
The guys hug and clink glasses and excitedly
Just then, a  appears at the table and
Gentlemen
You're going to have to keep it down
25 Come on, man
It's our friend's bachelor party
We're just trying to roast him a little bit
Well if you like roasts,  suggest the roast peking duck
It's out of this world and as 'm sure Aiden has told you, he can make it quite spicy
The guys look bothered
(') But as for the noisy kind of roast, that's going to have to stop
We have many other guests trying to enjoy the
Chang's experience
The manager walks away
For a moment, the guys are quiet
Lou takes a bite of his food, chewing slowly
This kung pau chicken pairs very nicely with the 97 cab
Very impressive choice, Nick
Thank you
Also, this is the worst bachelor party 've ever been to
Everyone puts down their forks, cathartically fed up
Totally agree
Nick, look
You had great intentions
No one's blaming you
'm blaming him
'm totally blaming him
didn't even want to go skiing
26
'll admit this trip is not off to the best start
But we're due for a victory
Nick thinks and actually gets an idea
He  his fingers
(') Hot tub
lightbulb goes off for Adam too
Yes
Lou gets up and throws down his napkin
Why did we even bother with dinner
Adam and Nick get up too
Guys, 'm still hungry
Quiet, men are talking
Aiden approaches
Get you guys some to-go boxes
would like you to die
And then would like you to leave
Aiden walks away, freaked out
Lou turns back to the guys
(') It's tub time
/  - Lou, Adam, and Nick all have  , as they gaze at the tub
They each hold a
Jacob looks indifferent and a little turned off by it all
Lou strips down to his underwear and
Oh my god
The water is perfect
27
He    and
Adam climbs in with Lou, pouring his own drink
really don't see the appeal
It's like a glorified bath
Jacob
Son
The hot tub is the whole thing
You ski all day
Then you hit the town, get trashed, and lure some fine ladies back to the lodge for some good old fashioned tubbin'
Nick    and pats Jacob on the back
(') So the town's dead
Fine, we skip that part and go right to the tub
Trust me
If there's fun to be had, the tub is a good start
Nick gets in
(') Yes
It's amazing
Now it's just Jacob outside the hot tub
The other three guys are already starting to look more energized and happy, splashing around
After another beat of consideration
Fuck it
Jacob strips down and gets in
As he submerges, he actually starts to loosen up a bit and smiles
Well
'm not convinced this is anything more than a bath, but it's nice
Hit him with some bubbles
Coming right up
Adam
As the  comes to life, we begin a '  over Reel 2 Real's " Like to Move It
" 28
-- In the tub, the guys  like fish, pouring various combinations of ,  ,  , , and anything else they can get their hands on
-- Jacob's  is propped on the edge of the tub, playing Every so often, one of our guys takes a drink, playing a game, the rules of which only they know

More drinking games
The guys wear funny  and roll dice on a
Adam has to drink some tub water

Then, Lou lifts up Jacob's head, which he has been
Jacob coughs and spits out water and looks pissed
Then he smiles and helps submerge Nick's head in the same way
-- Slam
Another bottle of vodka killed
Crush
Another empty Red Bull his the patio
--   eats some  that have been left on a Yards away in the tub, the guys laugh and taunt it
-- Lou  from where the bear has obviously across the chest
Still, he dances in the tub

Adam very dangerously jumps in, attached to a

More Dew
More Red Bull
More Bacardi
The cuts   and  until finally in a , we : /  - As the light of a new day spills into Havenhurst, we find all four of our guys   in the hot tub, the water calm
licks Lou's face
It's adorable
Until

Lou   and    , sending it
This wakes up everyone and they stir to life, inspecting the carnage, mostly hangover-related
Oh my god,  wanna die
need a vitamin water
Adam reaches in his backpack, taking out two choices
Red Bull or Fresca
Jacob takes the Fresca, as Lou inspects the
That fucking bear got me good
Yeah he did
But we showed him, didn't we
If by showing him, you mean we laughed and he got bored and wandered off into the woods with your sneakers, then yeah, we got him good
Fuck yeah
Lou picks up Adam's half-eaten sandwich and takes a
You just puked
That's why 'm eating your sandwich
'm fucking starving
Guys, look
Their gaze turns to the  , on which is a fresh It looks like perfect skiing conditions
Let's do it
30
/   - As the guys walk across the front of the lodge, they pass some well preserved  all parked together: a 1985 Pontiac Fiero, a 1986  Golf, and a 1987 Ford Mustang coupe
What is this, a shitty car club
The guys   the    : -- "Coming soon: the most spaced-out Mel Brooks film yet
" --  surfing   with a    and the tag: "Catch the Wave
" --  bull terrier named   parking with some and a shitload of
- In  , the guys hit the slopes: -- In his ridiculous snowsuit, Nick skis down the mountain
With the new snowfall, he expertly glides along
-- Jacob applies some   and flies down the mountain on a
People glare at him with confused expressions
-- Adam uses the snowplow method to slowly descend
He's a beginner skier
He takes the time to look at the surroundings and notices a ,   skiing today
Lots of    wearing  colors
Well this place has improved
-- In the lift line, Lou passes a  wearing a
Really, asshole
- Adam shares a gondola with Nick, as they make their way up the mountain
sits across, napping
Adam takes a  out of his backpack
He and Nick look over their shoulders like scheming kids as they take a nip

'm really glad we stayed
It's gonna be good to get away for a couple of days
( ) mean not like  want to be away from Lily
You know
Believe me  know
love her
But you guys are right
'm gonna be with her for the rest of my life
() For the rest of your goddamn life
It gets easier, right
No offense, but watching you talk with Courtney- You're gonna be fine
You'll settle in, get the premium cable package - the usual deal
Adam nods
(') You'll wake up every morning, comforted by the fact that your wife doesn't wield her family's wealth over your head like a hangman's noose
Adam looks concerned, as Nick wistfully goes on
(') You'll breathe the air of life, making the occasional decision - maybe get some lawn furniture
How about steak for dinner
Yes, let's get that juice machine  saw on
Let's fucking go for it
Nick stares off into the distance
Nick
32
Sorry,  lost myself there
(
) Coke
Adam and Nick look at the guy across from them, who presently offers his  , on which is a mountain of
That is a lot of cocaine
feel like we're in Scarface
Only with skiing
() Skiface
() Take it
It's good shit
'm gonna pass
() Yeah, 'm good
The dude removes his sunglasses
He has a dead look in his eyes, studying Nick and Adam
You guys a couple of spazzes
Spazzes
( ) Yeah, dipstick
You narcs
You Miami Vice
Which one's Crockett
Which one's
'm Crockett, obviously
( ) That's the Don Johnson one, right
The dude flips out a
You show me you're not spazzes
33
We're not spazzes
The dude extends the coke once more
Show me
/  - At the top of the mountain, Nick looks
Adam, on the other hand, looks
He sniffs, fidgets, clenches his jaw, and looks generally "up
" Adam, you gotta chill
You just did one line
've never ridden the horse before
You're not riding the horse
The horse is heroin
Adam can't stop moving and fidgeting
don't know what kind of animal 'm riding, but it's the best animal of all time
feel great
Adam uses his   to push off the top of the mountain and he goes
Adam
Jesus
/   -  - Adam  down, still
He as he flies down the mountain like a racer
Nick has to pull up and slow down in the name of safety
34
He zips along, never changing course or slowing
He a few
But he can't stop himself before -- The collision knocks Adam and the girl to the ground and finally stops Adam's hyper-speed descent
Adam gets up and shakes the cobwebs
What a rush
He notices the girl on the ground and goes to help her up
(') Oh wow, are you
No thanks to you, asshole

Jennie squints at Adam, trying to place him
Do  know you
He stares at her, not believing what he's seeing
He still looks loopy from the coke
Just then, a a too-blond, mirror-sunglass-wearing, feathered hair, striped-jumpsuited guy ()   and

( ) You all right, babe

Your lift ticket's been revoked
Blaine throws it on the ground and laughs to his friends

Blaine looks confused, as Adam  Blaine's lift ticket, but he ends up  '  too
(') Sorry,  was trying to
you can probably patch that up
Blaine  Adam close by the collar and clenches his fist
You're dead meat, scumbag
Just then,   flies in Blaine's face
Blaine lets go of Adam, as Jacob snowboards up and stops short, coming to his brother's side
There you are
My brother's had a few too many triple Venti nonfat lattes if you know what  mean
(genuine, to Adam) Are you
Adam nods
Blaine looks confused
and  look enamored with Jacob
Dude, they let you bring a skateboard on the mountain
It's a snowboard
You know - no wheels
Genius
Man, not to get all fag on you, but 'm digging your fresh threads, bro
Adam and Blaine look equally confused with what's going on
Jacob takes the compliment well, like he deserves it
36
Thank you
It's mostly North Face

Whatever it is, it works
Totally
What are you doing with this boner
You should be skiing with us
Like permanently
Blaine looks really annoyed with his friends
Guys
mean, that's if Blaine thinks it's cool and everything
Blaine takes a deep breath, annoyed
( ) Get your spaz brother out of here
And for his sake,  don't wanna see him back on my mountain
() You're welcome any time though
Adam picks up his , which fell off during the collision
He stares at Jennie again and smiles
You look  like this girl had the biggest crush on her-- Blaine grabs the bag out of Adam's hand and   away
This is mine now
Adam looks at Blaine angrily, but Jacob holds him back
Come on
Let's just go
Jacob ushers Adam off the slope, as Blaine shoulders the bag

Gone are the children and old people

It's something out of a mid-80s Aspen photo shoot
Nick walks in behind them, looking as confused as them
He turns up his palms and shakes his head, at a loss for words
What is going on
Lou strolls up to the guys, with his arms around He looks elated
Guys
'm so glad you're here want to introduce you to Michelle and Sandy
These lovely ladies are having a roller skating party next weekend and no offense, but fuck your wedding -- 'm totally coming back
By the way
Lou rolls out a   full of cocaine
(') There's coke everywhere around here
This place rules
Lou dips into the coke and rubs it on his gums and we: : /  - The suite looks a little "fresher

It looks almost new
Adam, Jacob, and Lou sit in the main room with the  on, as Nick emerges from a bedroom
Has anyone else noticed that things around here are weird as shit
Adam and Nick nod
Lou shakes his head

Don't you ruin this
If you wake me from this dream, 'll kill you

Jacob turns up the  on the

Then

( ) We're in 1987
Everyone looks stunned and dazed
What are we gonna do

We all have plans
It's my fucking wedding

Adam stands up, completely losing it
What the  is going on
Nick stands up and calmly takes charge
Everyone relax

And when we're done discussing it, we're all gonna feel a lot better
Everyone looks to Nick, who seems to have the answer
(') Two words: black hole
He lets it hang in the air for a moment, as if it's suddenly going to gel for everyone
But the guys look confused
(') saw a special on the Science Channel
And guess what
Sometimes this happens
This happens
Yes
And the best thing for us to do is to stay put
The universe will eventually reverse itself and work out this little glitch
Nick sits down, looking satisfied in his know-it-all-ness
This is a big glitch
Yeah, you're an idiot
Black holes are in space
Not at a ski resort
() So does this mean we get to go to girls' locker rooms and see them naked and they can't see us
40
No, we traveled through time
We're not invisible
Lou looks upset
(under his breath) 'm still gonna do it
Guys, ignoring the ridiculousness of how we got here for a moment-- Black hole
How are we supposed to get back
For a moment, everyone sits and absorbs the question
Then: We find a scientist

Lou stands up and throws down his magazine
This is bullshit

Just tell him
You tell him, Adam
Sir, we

Nothing's too ridiculous in the name of science
We're from the future
Get the fuck out of here

That went well
Lou starts walking off by himself
( ) Where are you going
Lou points to his watch
Five o'clock
Happy hour
The guys look at him, confused

The guys' eyebrows raise
After a moment: Well, maybe one drink
Just to confirm
- -  is underway on a
Whitesnake on the juke,   on the tables, and cheap beers in the mugs - this is an amazing brew pub
Our guys sit in the back, wearing    shirts
There are   on the table and they look
In a roped-off area in the corner, a cocky   (the one-armed bellhop) wields a  that he uses to carve an , impressing the bar crowd
He has
Holy shit
It's that bellhop
Should we warn him

God bless our country

You can stop saying that

Seriously, we have to get back

She walks away, as Jacob turns to the guys
(') This is gonna be a problem
He takes out his wallet, showing his   and
(') Guys, we're in trouble
Our cards aren't gonna work and our new money looks fake
The guys look concerned, but then Nick notices something: 've got an idea
As Nick gets up and approaches the businessmen, Adam looks around the room and by the bar, he spots -- 44
Jennie
He stares at her from across the room
Lou and Jacob notice
still can't believe it's really her
She's aged remarkably well
() Oh, right
Why don't you just go talk to her
should go talk to her
To apologize, of course
You know, nothing inappropriate
Sure
Adam
He slowly makes his way over across the room
Jennie is talking to    as Adam approaches
He lurks near them like a creep
Jennie eventually notices him, as he keeps stealing glances
She doesn't look happy
( ) Listen putz, if you're gonna try to attack me again, my boyfriend will be here soon
He'll kick your ass
Adam tries to be casual
No, no
No ass kicking
just wanted to say 'm sorry about earlier
lost control of the old skis there
( ) Looks like  shoulda taken another one of your classes
When did you take my class
Certainly not when  was a kid mean, that would make no sense
Adam tries to recover

Power tools
And regular tools
All sorts of tools

Jennie looks very suspect of Adam
Yeah,
Have a good night
Jennie starts to walk away with her friends
( ) Hey, where ya going
She ignores him, but one of her friends quietly lags behind
' (quietly, to Adam) Are you with that guy over there
She discretely points out Jacob
Yeah, he's my brother
She takes Adam's  and writes something on it
' There's a party later tonight at this address
Make sure he comes with you
He's way boss
Adam walks back to his friends
How'd it go
He shows them his palm
We got invited to a party later
sweet
What are we gonna do until then
How about figure out how the hell to get back to the present day
Nick walks back to the table and  down a pile of

Bam
We're millionaires
Close
It's a thousand bucks
Where did you get that money
Nick points out the Japanese Businessmen
() Sold them my iPod
Jacob looks incredulous
That was  a good idea
agree
You left so much money on the table
It's a fucking iPod
You could've gotten a  more
That's not what -- (looking at watch) Fellas, we are not making progress and we're losing time
Adam, don't worry
Time's not moving forward in the future
Uh, yeah it is
Lest we forget the lessons learned from Bill and Ted
Well then  give you Back to the Future
That's not fair
You can't go right to Back to the Future
Why not
47
Back to the Future had a time machine
Well so did Bill and Ted
() Wait, that's it
can't believe 'm about to say this, but  think we have a time machine
Adam, all we did is get drunk in the hot tub
Everyone's

Adam and Nick trade swigs from a

There's no flux capacitor
Lou pulls Jacob over and straps him in the driver's seat, before walking around to the passenger side

Then one of us will come back and get one of you
And so on and so forth

Go light on the clutch

He and   on the floor
The others pull him off
Jesus Christ, what the hell, Lou

This is probably his room
We're not registered here in 87
Lou thinks for a moment and looks a "little" sorry
'm still pretty  with it
You have a problem
Just help me put him outside

Let's just go to sleep
We'll figure everything out in the morning
It's pretty late
Jacob checks his watch, rolling his eyes
It's 8:45
The other guys look at their watches, surprised
Why am  so wiped out
Because you're old and lame
Yeah, fuck that, we're going to that party
We are not going to the party

Hear me out
Lou paces around the room like Patton addressing the troops
(') We saw the scientist
He was worthless
We tried the tub
Dead end

From Hertz
It might as well have been a Nissan
Adam shakes his head, as Lou continues
(') Gentlemen, it's fucking 1987
Nixon's in the White House, gas is free, and we're about to put a man on the moon
Did we go to the same school
Lou turns and addresses Adam directly
The point is you haven't even met your wife yet
She can't fault you for shit that went down 23 years ago
Even if 23 years ago somehow ends up being tonight
Adam starts listening a little more closely, as some of Lou's logic actually makes "some" sense
(') It's time to start facing the fact that we may not be going home
And if that's so, then we owe it to ourselves to make the best life we can for ourselves
The guys listen intently, as Lou's speech reaches a passionate climax
(') Because  don't want to be that college freshman who spends the first semester hiding in his dorm room, only to realize that come spring, he has no friends
( ) No
() 53
('  ) want to be that college freshman who fucks chicks way out of his league before they have an opportunity to realize he's not as cool as he's pretending to be
Nick nods
Even Jacob smiles
(') Are you with me
() don't know
Close enough
We'll talk some more at the party
- It's like the 80s exploded
Music, clothes, hair, attitude -- it's all on overdrive
In one section, - marvel at , while in another area, people make out and dance
Adam, Nick, Lou, and Jacob walk in the front door
They have updated their "looks" with 80s sweaters and other era- appropriate attire
They all look ridiculous, except for Jacob, whose youth lends him hipster appeal
This sweater makes me look like a jerkof f

Was this like an 80s thing
If he doesn't lose that arm soon, 'm gonna take it from him myself
With that, Lou wanders off toward another room, leering at and groping girls as he goes
54
(: ) He's gonna be a problem
Tad and Chaz walk over, looking dapper and douchey
They are excited to see Jacob
Hey, glad you could make it
() This is your party
Hey man, no hard feelings, all right
If your bro says you're cool, then we're cool
Tad puts his arm around Jacob and leads him into the party
There's some people  want you to meet
By the way, bodacious hair
Incredibly chic
() Oh yeah
It doesn't really take that much product
It's all in the layering
Whoa
Product
You're blowing my mind right now
Did you spend time in Europe
Don't tell me
Prague
Do you want some coke
Do you have Coke Zero
Ah, a conscientious objector like that
Gotta stay sharp
Nick mixes something in a large bowl, as plenty of - look on
He pours a red liquid into a tray of An attractive   follows his every move

Sandy and Jacob confer, figuring out the dare
Lou meets Jacob's eyes -- he smiles, knowing Jacob has his back
, we dare Lou to put a Twizzler up his ass
Lou stands up and angrily points at Jacob
You son of a bitch
Have you ever played this game before
It's supposed to be awesome
Lou nevertheless grabs a  from the snack bowl and shoves it down the back of his pants
His face contorts uncomfortably and he is almost on the verge of tears
(') This is a horrible thing you're doing and  hope you never have to experience what  am currently going through
Lou sits down and Michelle consoles him
Your turn
Truth or dare
Before Sandy can even confer with Jacob: () Truth
Lou throws up his hands in frustration
He looks miserable, as Michelle confers with him
(grumbling to Michelle) don't care
Whatever
This is not the point of the game
, each of you has to tell your darkest, most personal secret
Lou crosses his arms and shakes his head
58
Oh wow, all right
Let me think
've never told anyone this, but was afraid of scary movies until was 18
even ran out of the theater a couple of times
Oh you poor thing
Come here
She takes Jacob's head to her chest and strokes it gently
Lou makes a jerk-off gesture
(') () 'm not sure  should tell mine
Come on
You have to
, but you can't laugh
( ) We promise
Let's hear it
So this one time me and my friend Lori took a train to Baltimore
It was the summer and we wanted to party, but we had no money
So Lori found this businessman who was also looking for a good time and told him that we'd give him a half and half for seventy-five dollars
You know -- a suck and fuck
Lou and Jacob look shocked with the storytelling
Michelle smiles
She's heard it before
(') Anyway, we get him up to his room and Lori starts going down on him, but  really wasn't into it
So broke a piece of the bathroom mirror and used it to cut his artery on the-heck
Right here
She rubs Jacob's neck, pointing it out

So  lied to you earlier

Jennie instinctively looks around for her friends

You don't look like you could handle power tools
60
The truth is, Jennie, 've always liked you
But 've never really known you
really wasn't supposed to meet you again
Who are you
Adam shrugs, indicating he might as well tell her
came here from the future
She rolls her eyes - she's heard all the one-liners
Let me guess
You want to beam me up to your spaceship built for two
Or maybe you're wondering if these are astronaut pants
Astronaut pants
Because my ass is out of this world
Give me a break, spaz
've heard them all
She turns away
Adam goes after her
No
No spaceship
No astronaut pants
Just regular time travel
With normal pants

An  comes from behind and
It's Blaine
thought  told you to stay off my mountain, partner
Blaine, stop
You talking to my girl
Huh can't hear you
Adam fights to breathe, as Blaine chokes him harder
61
Blaine, that's enough
Let him go
He can't breathe
Blaine doesn't stop
He smiles like an asshole
Can't breathe
Is that right
Can you breathe, partner
What's that
can't hear you
Just tell me you can't breathe and 'll stop
Adam still struggles
Blaine just shrugs
(') He's not saying anything

Jennie pulls on Blaine's arm, trying to free Adam
(') Babe, stop
Jennie, stop
Blaine turns and accidentally   in the face
She goes down
He releases Adam and turns to help her

It's from a box
There's lots
Mmm
Fantastic
( ) Do you mind if  borrow my friend
We'll only be a moment
: /  - Lou has Jacob     with his arm
He speaks quietly, but with purpose
You're gonna fuck her
'm not gonna have sex with her
She killed a guy
That guy was undesirable
You heard her
It was about the money
Great, so she's a prostitute
'm not sleeping with a hooker either
She's not a hooker
She's a girl who did what she had to do to make a few bucks
(tries new tactic) Listen, she's probably awesome in bed
She probably has a hairy vagina
Exactly
Jacob looks confused
'm not having this conversation
It's pointless
don't have a condom

Perfect
Me neither
No one here uses condoms
It's like heaven
Only with a lot more coke

Plus, there's an excellent buffet and a view of the pool
Jennie laughs, despite herself
She looks around, as if someone might see her

(') No one's gonna see you hanging out with the creepy spaz
Don't worry
'm sorry  called you those names
Hey, it's cool
was being creepy and spazzy
You're still not gonna tell me how you know me

Fine, let's just drop it
'm glad you're feeling better
Blaine had no right to hit you

What are you doing with a douche like him anyway
You're so much better than that
Yeah, well guys like you come to visit
Guys like him live here
So if  lived here, 'd have a shot
For a moment, Jennie is thrown off
She's about to say something, but checks herself
Instead she nervously stands
'm gonna get going
Adam stands up with her
(') Thanks for being a good guy don't remember the last time  had this much fun playing such a stupid game
She gives Adam a sweet

So you're telling me that Red Bull plus hot tub equals time travel
( ) Mmm hmm
Hank Musselman's getting the Nobel Prize
Who the fuck is Hank Musselman
There was just enough Red Bull for the kitten
Not nearly enough for a human

How did you even figure this out
Scientific method
He bet me 20 dollars  wouldn't lick the stain

What's wrong with you
It worked, didn't it
Yeah, except one little problem
There's no Red Bull in 1987

You don't wanna know
Lou

The kid sucked,
He couldn't take even a little bit of direction
Pretty soon  realized that having two versions of the same dude walking around -- as cool as that sounds -- didn't make very much sense to me

What did you do
killed myself
Jesus Christ
Yeah, it was really some existential shit
mean, here am committing homicide and 'm actually committing suicide
How could you
It was easy actually
For a minute,  thought  might be dealing with that whole Timecop thing
You know, the same matter can't occupy the same space at the same time bullshit and we both go poof
Especially after that whole nose thing
But no, it was just a murder
didn't suffer
don't wanna hear any more
102
It was strangulation
don't wanna hear any more
They sit in horrified silence for a bit
You'll have to introduce me when we get there
Your families won't know me
Although 'm sure they're huge fans
() So hey, getting married, huh
Taking the plunge
Adam looks disturbed
Nick looks confused
This makes no sense at all
- Lily looks beautiful, surrounded by  and
Still, she looks distant and lonely
Until -- (the flower) comes into frame
Lily smiles and stands up
She turns around
Adam's standing there with a whole bouquet of flowers
Lily gives him a
When she's done: Don't you ever let me take your phone again
() 'm here on time
Just like promised
Nick sits down next to  and Jacob takes his seat
(') (no nerves at all) 'm so happy to see you and  can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you
() Me too
103
You're the one
Lily notices Adam's on
Oh my god, what happened
(
) My fault entirely, madam
The room is  with , as Lou makes a nearly , wearing a
Hey, it's Lou Blustein
The whole room  Lou, as he walks in
Adam and the guys can't believe it
was partaking in a little ski adventure and  mistakenly wandered into your fiance's path
His broken leg is my broken heart
My most humble apologies
Lou scrapes and bows and regally kisses Lily's hand
She looks genuinely flattered
Lou gets up and whispers to Adam
(') See
'm awesome here
You shoulda stayed out of that tub
: -  - Nick   with Courtney
was thinking we'd invite Adam and Lily over for dinner when they get back from their honeymoon
That's
if it's  with you
Why wouldn't it be  with me
That sounds nice
() () 104
(') You look so good in this shirt, by the way
Nice choice
She puts her head on Nick's shoulder as they dance
So
how are your parents
Still working hard
really wish they could retire already, but it's tough competing with the big chains
mean, they just have the one store
: - 1987 - The Japanese Businessman is on a  , speaking in Japanese
( ) Hiro-san
Cancel the paperwork
We have to get back to Tokyo have inside information that undermines the supermarket deal
Nick stands next to him, nodding and
: -  - Nick enjoys dancing with his mellow, awesome wife
() You know what they say about hard work
Builds character
Adam orders drinks, as his
He picks it up and in an instant,       as a Ahh
105
This is why we shouldn't have sold that iPod
Adam puts his hand through Jacob, who speaks with purpose
(') The Japanese have apparently cornered the technology sector over the past 20 years
We've dealt American businesses quite an irreparable blow
What does that mean for us
Pretty much nothing for us personally
We just get cooler phones and iPods and shit
Oh
Great
Jacob   and disappears, as Lily approaches
Adam can't help but beam from ear to ear
(') You're so beautiful
know you were only gone for a couple days, but  missed you so much
Adam takes her hand
Come on, let's get out of here
We have unfinished business
Lily smiles
She gets into it
It's about time
, what's the fantasy
() How about you're the woman  love and 'm the man of your dreams
Booor-ing
106
, you're a nurse and a snake bit my penis
Done and done
They bolt for the door and we : -  - The party is winding down and only a   remain
At a table in the corner, Lou has an with a    in her early 20s
They finally come up for air
So you're friends with the bride
Can you keep a secret
'm actually kinda crashing the party
Naughty girl
You're secret's safe with me
'm just in town for a couple of nights
'm actually looking for my father
We've never met
'm from here
Maybe  know him
His name is Hank Musselman
For a moment, Lou's expression
He blinks
Then -- No, never heard of him
