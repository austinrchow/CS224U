+ Written by Dean Georgaris Transcript by Chani at tristanandisolde net Britain the Dark Ages The Roman Empire has fallen
The land lies in ruins, divided amoung feuding tribes
To the west, Ireland has flourished untouched by the Romans, protected by the sea
Led by their powerful and ruthless King, the Irish have subdued the Britons
Knowing that if Ireland is to prosper, the tribes must never be allowed to unite
[Scene showing images of mountains
young boy Tristan hunts with his father for a rabbit] year younger than  was for my first
When can  have a stag
a stag
Oh come on
[The two walk home through the mountains
Main title appears] + Why would they join up against the Irish
Because someone has to stand up to them
You
Me, Marke, all the tribes
We cant resist alone
could
[Castle Tantallon appears onscreen] Oh my little warrior
We have to be careful
[Tristan and his father enter the bustling village] Come home without something for your Lady there will be hell to pay
[Tristan goes to a flower and herb seller] Can
[Aragon continues on into town where he is met by one of his men] The Angles have arrives my Lord, as well as the Carrods, our fellow Jutes and the Saxons
Good
With Marke, all will be here
Yeah
It is a great day
Let us hope so
[They continue on into town
We see Tristan back at the herb sellers] Thanks
[The boy starts to make a bracelet out of the herbs
Going up to Lady Marke he hands her the finished wreath] We heard the news
Mother,  made this for you [Lady Marke smiles and touches Tristans face lovingly] [In the Main Hall of Aragon, the assembled tribe Lords gather in meet] Friends, look at us
[ map of Britain is shown] The tribes of Britain
Divided
Weak
Just as the Irish like us
But if we were one land united, we would out number them two to one
We could defeat them once and for all
That is why we are here today, to sign this treaty of unification
But who would be King
The strongest among us: Lord Marke
[Scene of movement outside of the town] Look if you are happy sending all of your gold to Ireland, living as slaves then by all means do nothing
If we were happy doing that then we would never have risked coming here
Friends
My wife is with child, my heart tells me it is a boy
want him to grow old in a land where all of us, all the tribes: Pict, Celt, Angle, Jute, Saxon are at peace
This island has not known unity since the Romans left
That is why  sign this treaty
And why should we follow you
Perhaps, Wictred, because your last attempt to form an alliance without the knowledge of half the Barons in this room has failed
[ man bursts into the room] My Lord
The Irish are here
[Scenes of destruction outside the keep
Inside Aragon grabs Marke] Take all your men
Guard the women
But you
Go
[More destruction
All the women and children try to find safety] Tristan
Hurry
Come this way
[More fighting
In the main keep the men await the Irish] How did they know
[The Irish break through and a furious battle begins
Tristan tries to fight] Tristan
[Aragon manages to hold his son back and puts him in a hold under the floorboards
Aragon is then killed by Morholt
There is more destruction and fire breaks out
Tristan reaches up to touch the floorboards above and finds his fathers seeping blood on his hands
Tristan comes out of the hole and surveys the destruction
His father and Lady Marke are dead
Suddenly he is attacked by an Irishman but Marke jumps in to save him, losing his hand in the process] [Dunluce Castle
The funeral of the Irish Queen appears onscreen
We see a funeral procession
maid holds the young princess comfortingly] Shes with the Gods now Isolde, youll see her again someday
Will
Morholt returns
[The King leaves the funeral] What news of the treaty
[Morholt hands the King a scroll, which the King tears up] Good Morholt, good [Isolde and Bragnae approach a cairn where Isolde lays an urn of her mothers ashes within a niche] Your mother loved you so much Isolde Why did she die Bragnae
Why
It was an ill fever that took her
Fever
No
It was her heart
[Castle Dor appears onscreen
procession of survivors from Markes retinue return home
They find Dor in ruins
Markes sister runs up to him and cries in his arms] Your husband
[Edyth shakes her head] Oh sister  am so sorry
:
* whole generation of men
Whos this
Tristan
Son of Aragon
Were his family now
have a son about your age
Melot
Melot
Melot, this is Tristan
What shall we do, my Lord
Rebuild
[Rebuilding is taking place
The youth are practicing their swordsmanship
Marke is testing his ability with his sword without his hand] Dont hold back [Marke loses the fight easily
boy starts yelling to the other boys] Tristan wont fight me
Look hes scared
Still won't fight
Tristan has the heart of a lion
He just needs some time
Why did you take off your helmet
You going to cry
My father died too, but you dont see me crying
Melot
Run
Find another trapdoor to hide under
Coward
[Tristan suddenly fights back and beats all the boys single-handedly] Tristan
[Tristan starts walking towards the camera
Suddenly he is grown up and the town is mostly rebuilt] Tristan
Tristan
Weve found something
Come on, this way
You will love it
found a trapdoor
You found a trapdoor
Alright Simon, will you tell us all how you found it
Look at that
[The three friends climb down into it] Where does this lead
Youll see
like that vase,  think 'll have that
always knew the Castle was built on Roman foundations but we didnt think anything was left
Must be a burial crypt or something
[They re-emerge from the tunnel] Here we are: the bottom of the keep
Who else knows about this
Nobody
Good
[They exit the keep] The savages have rebuilt the castle at Cornwall, only now its made of stone
Of Cornwalls next tribute  want slaves
Young ones
Their future
If Marke resists have Morholt crush him
My King
Morholt
have led your armies to victory far and near
Iv made you rich and powerful
Yes you have
You have been most loyal
When  return from Cornwall,  was hoping
What would please you
wife
[The cairn appears once again, with a grown up Isolde leaning on it looking out to sea] Its dark in an hour
What do you think is really out there
Britannia
The old Roman lands
Full of evil and grief
want to see it
Do you know what the future looks like Bragnae
see the life you were meant for
Your father will speak with you
[Isolde speaks with her father
She is clearly distraught] Am  just a chattel to be traded at your pleasure
Do  have no say in my own life
You have a duty to your King
You are my father
Then obey me, daughter
[Isolde runs to her apothecary-like room
Morholt comes to her] Your father has given you the news
[Isolde nods] And you welcome it
accept it
You know, we are more alike than you might guess
How so
too dabble in elixirs
Poison from the livers of a puffer fish
Just a taste paralyses all the senses
So if the blade doesnt kill
Rendered safe by thistle and bark
[Morholt holds up a leaf] And you know the antidote for this
Yohimbine
Makes a hard man even harder
The only cure
wild abandon
Till out wedding day
Im to Cornwall, to deal with rabbles
[The Irish arrive in Cornwall and enter the town of Castle Dor] Release them
[The Irish men spread out and start collecting Cornish men and women as hostages] Leave her
[He is grabbed by the Irish thugs] Take him there
Get a rope
Any man foolish enough to interfere in any way shall suffer the same fate
[ girl rushes forward] No
No
Please No
[The man is hung and Tristan rushes forward
He is held back by the Irish men
The Cornish hostages are put in a wagon] If there are any more attacks we shall put our guests to death and raise this entire land
Take the horses
[Tristan confronts Marke about the Irish] When would you strike
At once
Throw everything we have at them
They are hoping you'll do that
On horse they outnumber us two to one
You would lead the men straight to their deaths
So we do nothing
Donnchadh would like that even more
Me to lose face in front of the other tribes
No, we must act
We must be decisive but we cannot act alone
[Tristan and Marke enter the hall] So
Have the good men of York come to fight with us
Hm
The Saxons of Wessex
My men dont want to follow a Pict into battle
Let alone one leading a pack of Angles and Celts
Then why are you here
thought Tristan should let me command his men
make it my habit to follow no one
Except Marke
Marke delivered me from that place when was a boy
You ran
So you can understand that when  think of Kings  think of him
When  think of cowards
They are one day from their boats on the old Roman road
Now who will ride out with Tristan to fight them
What is your plan, Tristan
We will need our two fastest runners
[The Irish and their hostages make their way through a forest
Suddenly two of the British jump up and shoot at the Irish
Half of the convoy follow the two runners] Go around
[They continue to pursue the runners on foot
Suddenly Tristan and his men spring up from hidden holes under the loam and shoot the Irish with their bows
The Irish are attacked from all sides and defeated
Back at the main part of the Irish convoy, Morholt cleans his blade] Morholt, theyre back
[Cloaked figures ride in while the camp cheers
Suddenly they attack and more British spring from the ground
battle ensues
Morholt begins to kill the hostages, but Tristan springs to stop him
Sammy is stabbed
Tristan is stabbed by Morholts poisoned blade but manages to kill Morholt
Melot and Tristan run to Sammys side] Kill the slaves
Simon
dont want to die
[Simon dies and Tristan collapses] Tristan
cant feel my legs or my hands
Poison
Build a second boat
Tristan
[Tristan seems to die] He shall have a King's service
[Tristan is lain on a funeral boat and floated out to sea] Farewell, Tristan of Aragon
Death of the Irish
[The boat is set alight by burning arrows
Melot turns to the captured Irish] When the Irish came to Cornwall and my father surrendered
You spared a dozen out of a hundred
am even less kind
The leader and 3 shall take this message home
As for the rest
[The surviving British and the hostages return to Dor
Marke meets them] Victory
Tristan
Simon too
Did  love him like a son or did  misuse him for my own purposes
He knew
He knew
[Tristan floats in the sea, the ship no longer burning
Isolde is suddenly woken from sleep and makes her way to the beach with Bragnae] Where are we going
Away
You're afflicted child
Speak to me
Your father will find us and have my head
You are my charge
Please
am no ones charge
You are
And you will be Morholts Lady
And live a loveless life like my mam
Whats that
Where
[Isolde runs to the beached boat] Isolde
Wait
Dont
Isolde
Dont
Isolde
Its a man
Dead
Alive
Bragnae help me
Isolde
Help me
[They drag Tristan to a hut on the beachfront] Start a fire
Quickly
[Isolde checks his condition while Bragnae tries to light the fire] His heart falters
[Isolde starts to undress] What are you doing
He needs heat
Now
Get your clothes off
Quickly
[Isolde curls up against Tristan while Bragnae starts to undress] Hurry
Quickly
Smell that
Smell the poison
When he warms we will need thistle and bark
Ive not been naked with a man for 15 years
Hello
You've been sleeping a long time
You're in Ireland
Did you know that
Shh
It's alright
You're safe here
No one knows
Don't be scared
Just sleep
sleep
[Tristan fades out of consciousness] [Tristan wakes and grabs a stone to use as a weapon when he hears a noise] Nooo Nooo Noo
[Isolde runs in] Its alright, you dont need that forgot to tell him about you
Ill wait outside with the other beasts
[Bragnae leaves] You said no one else knew
Sorry
Shes
My maid
Sworn to silence
Um
lie down please
Please
[Tristan lies down] Its good you are remembering things
This might sting
Do you remember anything else
The boat  found you in
How you got this
Too many questions
Here keep it dry
Here  found bread, you have water and fire
The ocean is outside if you wish a bath
You wont know where you are going so please dont try to leave
Just trust me
Why are you doing this
Ill be back [Isolde leaves the hut and meets up with Bragnae outside] This is a dangerous game you are playing
Hes English, Isolde
Then weve got him prisoner
Under no circumstances tell him your name, you hear me
Not if you wish him to escape this place
Do you hear me
[Back in the Irish town Isolde and Bragnae whisper together
King Donnchadh enters and they fall into silence] Youve been away
had noticed
Yes  have a bit
Where
Bragnae and  were spying the convent of Brittes ]
Seeking sanctuary
Some women need it
Youll find no refuge in a new religion
Your place is here, with Morholt
Any word of my betrothed
Overdue
But comforted no doubt that you yearn for him
[The King leaves] [Isolde leaves the town to return to the hut on the beach
She sees Tristan bathing in the sea
Isolde tends to Tristans wounds back in the hut] What's your name
Oh,  think it's better if we don't bother with names
How can  thank you if  don't have your name
You just did
If you insist
my name is Bragnae
'm a lady in waiting at the court
My parents are dead
My mother, she is the source of the kindness you find so puzzling
My father would've left you where you fell
Tristan of Aragon
Well Tristan of Aragon, 'd guess about you too, but  think 've already seen everything
Sir
hope you appreciate the risks we are taking, and will honour us by leaving as soon as you are able
[Bragnae leaves] She likes me
Shes right though, you do risk
[Finishes poulticing him] There
What of your parents
They also died when  was a child
Of what
different type of Irish kindness
Sorry
[Bragnae returns and interrupts their moment of tenderness] Tomorrow then
Tomorrow
[Tristan sits outside making a shell bracelet
Isolde shortly arrives
Inside the hut the scene continues] There she who bore you brought you forth
Set me as a seal upon your heart, As a seal upon your arm; For love is as strong as death, Ridiculous
happen to believe what that says
Dont you think there is more to life
Than what
Something more than duty and death
Why are we capable of feelings if not to have them
Why long for things if they are not meant to be ours
Well dont listen to me
Youre so sure of things
Youre certainty, its like armour
wish  had that
Why would you need it
The joy of being a lady
Wanting something cant have
life of my own
Time for sleep now
Ill follow you later
You need to rest
In case your betrothed should want to see you
[Bragnae and Isolde leave] [Tristan and Isolde look out to sea] Youre promised
Yes
Whats he like
Dark
Tall
Nearly twice your size
An absolute gentleman
thought
earlier when you spoke of wanting something you cant have
didnt know what  was talking about
[They leave the shore and go inside the hut, Isolde is crying] Outside, just past that bluff there is a boat
Thats how you should go when you leave
You should go soon
[Isolde leaves but Tristan goes after her
They kiss
Inside the hut they make love
] How do you feel
dont know Tristan
Theyve found your boat
At this very moment the King himself is scouring the coast
He will find you
He finds everyone
The tide is coming lets go
[They drag the boat out to see] Come with me
Come with me
cant Why not
Please
Tristan, weve both known this cant be
Weve known this from the start
That doesnt mean it isnt true
It is
It just cannot be
want to know that you are alive somewhere thinking of me from time to time
want to know that there is more to this life and cant know that if they kill you
Please
[They kiss] Go
[Isolde leaves to shore while Tristan rows away] [Back at Dunlane] Cornish warrior may be ashore
Beware
We seek him as  speak
Hopefully it is just his rotted corpse we'll find, for he has slain your betrothed
Morholt is dead
Fallen in battle
Isolde
Bragnae, comfort her
[The two leave, the Irish henchman, Bodkin enters] Shes stunned
As am  by her grief
We should assulat the British straight away
Crush them with maximum force
Maximum force
Like that of Markes tribe with the maximum force you speak of
will not confront them again until our numbers are refreshed
Until then, well have cunning divide them
Of what nature
prize, perhaps
[Isolde looks out to sea while Tristan sails back to Cornwall
Meanwhile all the British Lords receive a message from Ireland] Whats this about a tournament
Donnchadh
He has offered his daughter and the lands of Lyonesse as dowry to whichever English tribe wins
It is a clever way of setting us against each other
Well, the other barons will see through that
[There is a meeting of the Lords in Dor] As baron of Wessex it is my duty to fight in this tournament for my people
For yourself you mean
And what of the support you promised Tristan
Tristan is dead
My people have suffered enough
They see the wealth of Lyonesse as more real than any alliance
My mind is set
And ours as well
So be it
[Tristan rides back into town] You're weary, let me rally your friends
Ill lead them against
Ah, Melot, Melot, Melot
You are my blood and you are a noble presence but
[They hear the sounds of the townspeople calling welcome to Tristan outside
Everyone rushes to Tristan] Lord Marke
Hes back
Its Tristan
It cannot be
Tristan
saw you dead
am delivered
How
How
[There is a celebration for Tristans return that night] toast
Tristan
Back from the dead
Tristan
The Irish King offers his daughter in tournament to divide the tribes
For the power and the wealth half the tribes have sent champions to fight at the
Tristan
God knows what happened to him
[Tristan stares out into the night
The voice of Isolde haunts him] "My face in thine eyes, thine in mine appears, And true plain hearts do in the faces rest; Whatever dies, was not mixed equally; If our two loves be one, or thou and
Love so alike, that none can slacken, none can die
" [Tristan confronts Marke in the keep with a plan] What
It is the only way to keep the alliance alive
fail to see how fighting with our partners keeps us allies
Well they are all going to the tournament anyway
By announcing you will share the dowry with every Baron that remains loyal and in turn offering to support whomever prevails, the others would be compelled to follow you when you win
If we win
If we lose we could end up following Wictred
Id need an infallible champion
Me
You are not yet healed
Then this trip will be my tonic
will be ready
know  will
What is the source of this fervour
Let me go and win you a wife
She can make peace without spilling one drop of blood, and maybe heal a wound from which you still lack
[The British arrive in Ireland
henchman approaches Tristan] Truce
You have safe passage
[The warriors enter the tournament arena] How do  look
How do you look
Where is this Princess
Whats her name
Isolde
want to see what she looks like
[Maids attend to Isolde as the King enters] There
Almost done
No, not quite
If  am to be a present should be fully wrapped
[The King takes his seat on the podium overlooking the arena] See how the bees come to the honey
Tristan of Aragon
[He is given a specially prepared tablet] So he lives
For the moment
Wictred of Glastonbury
[He is also given a prepared stone] fight with no champion in my stead
Know that
Why Wictred
Because the Barons will never unite behind him
[Isolde takes her seat] Do you think shes got the pox
[The combatants take their positions] Since the dawn of time
[Isolde sees Tristan amoung the group to be fighting] Begin
[The battles start] Make it for real
What
yield
You were great
[Tristans enemy is given a new sword after losing his weapon] Allow it
[Tristan wins the battle] It was too easy for you Tristan
Not much for a third draw
[Wictred and Tristan work through their opponents until they face each other] Mace
One more fight Tristan
Take deep breaths
Wictred: Lord of Saxonberg
Tristan: Champion of Cornwall
Warriors: Begin
[Tristan and Wictred fight
Wictred is booed by the crowd
Tristan defeats Wictred
] Yield
[Tristan goes before the King] An impressive victory
Of course the man who defeats Morholt might be expected to triumph here
On behalf of Cornwall,  offer your daughter a place on our throne
The throne of England, united behind one leader
Isolde
Perhaps it is just that he who took a husband provides one
[Isolde comes forward] Im yours
No
Tristan of Aragon has won you on behalf of Lord Marke of Cornwall
Lets go
[Everyone disperses] Let them take her across the sea
After the wedding 'll disavow Isolde, the alliance will crumble
[The English sail back to Britain with Isolde and Bragnae] Tristan
Princess wants to speak to you
[Tristan goes to meet Isolde inside the ship] You risked your life to give me to another man
You said your name was Bragnae
Why did you do that
Oh what have  done
Stop this thing
Say something
can't
won you in my King's name
But  am yours
You touched me and yielded
It doesn't matter
It is the only thing that matters Tristan
Leave with me,  will go anywhere
Your marriage will end a hundred years of bloodshed
My marriage to another man
Isolde
You will live with this
We must
Don't do this to me
[Melot enters] Tristan, weve made shore
[The party enter Dor, Marke waits for them] What if shes a hag
Or maybe she wont have me
She will brother
Youre the prize
[Isolde steps out of the carriage] My Lord
Isolde
Welcome
[He takes her hand and everyone claps] [Isoldes wedding gown is prepared
Marke puts on his metal hand for the ceremony
Isolde  fully dressed- floats down the river to the wedding ceremony about a decorated ship
She and Marke go forward to be wed
There is a celebration after the wedding
As Isolde and Marke leave the party, Isolde approaches Tristan] If things were different
If we lived in a place without duty
would you be with me
That place does not exist
'll pretend it's you
[Isolde and Marke retire to their bedroom
Tristan watches their window from outside] Youre trembling
You are far from home and  am a stranger still
But you mustnt fear me
My wish is to make you happy, as a wife
as a women and hopefully one day, the fact that  am not whole will not offend you
[Marke kisses Isolde and makes love to her] [Marke and Isolde stand outside the keep surveying the town
Mark fingers her shell bracelet] Thats pretty
Did you make it
It was a present
[Tristan goes to Edyths home and knocks on the door] Tristan
Might  stay here a while
Of course
[There is a montage of Tristan and Isoldes lives while in Dor
Finally in the marketplace Isolde is fed food by Mark and they laugh together
Edyth sees Tristan watching] Tristan
[Tristan walks off] Ive never seen him like this before
Perhaps someone his own age should speak with him
[Marke lets her go
She finds Tristan] They believe you are distant
They are worried about you
So am
can tell
Laughing at the market, holding hands, a caress on the neck when he pours you wine
He is my husband
remember his Kingdom comes before my life
Yes well,  must confess  thought you might find more difficulties in performing your duty
Am  not permitted a single moment without mourning
Living with this Tristan as you said we must
live in torture thinking of these moments
With every look he gives you get sicker and sicker
There is a burning in me,  feel on fire and guilt and  can't get rid of either
Does it make you happy to know that
The Roman Bridge
can get to it without being seen
And  will go there anytime to be there with you
[All the Leaders meet in Castle Dor to sign a treaty] Welcome bands of Anglia, Rothgar and Orick
Wessex: Kaye and Wictred
As you will be King and his daughter Queen, does that mean Donnchadh will be coming to the coronation
It does
On the next full moon, all will attend
lot can happen in a month Bearing that in mind, and given the instabilities of our new land  shall be naming a second
My sister has raised one, capable of guiding you if the need should arise
He is a man of passion, fierce in battle who has learnt to tame his heart with his head
give you Tristan of Aragon
[Melot is very upset] For the first time since the Romans, this country stands united
[After leaving the signing, Tristan chases down Marke] cant be your second
Melot must be
He is blood
Besides,  wish to journey north
You no longer sleep at Dor, and now you dont want to be my second
Do you find no comfort in your home
These stone walls that you helped build
find these walls a prison
Why
Everything  want seems misplaced
Ever since you were a boy you sacrificed everything for me
All for one dream
Now that you reached that dream, it is natural that you would feel some loss
It doesnt matter if you want to be second
You are
will only be king if you are my second
Id put it more gently if  could
Then  am your second
Perhaps it is time that you took a wife
No
Cant live alone forever
can
[Isolde passes] Isolde
was trying to explain to Tristan the importance of loving
It seems he might live without it
Why
There are other things to live for
Duty
Honour
But they are not life Tristan
They are the shells of life
And empty ones and in the end all they hold is days and days without love
Love is made by God
Ignore it and you can suffer as you cannot imagine
Then  will no longer live without it
Good
Very good
Come, we will be late
Late
The warriors ride out on the full moon
It is an old ritual
shall miss you tonight
[That night Isolde sneaks out into the forest
Marke and his warriors ride together
Tristan leaves the party to find Isolde
They make love together] How many did you love before me
None
And after me
None
[While hunting the boar Marke falls off his horse] Lord Marke
Are you hurt
Nothing but for my pride
[Tristan and Isolde bid each other farewell
Back in the keep there is much dancing] Tristan,  need to speak with you
Go ahead
We havent even had a coronation yet to mark tradition
But now he breaks tradition and scares all the barons by naming you as second
tried to convince him you would be better
Yes well, peace can be just as treacherous as war and  feel that Marke doesnt really
Listen to me
Our attention must be on Cornwall now more than ever
am sorry he didnt choose you
am
[Melot approaches Marke] Can  speak to you
[Marke leaves Isoldes side, Tristan leaves and Isolde follows
They hide in a room were they begin to kiss each other passionately
Finishing his conversation with Melot, Marke seeks Isolde
Later that night, Marke makes love to Isolde] [Tristan and Isolde are out in a forest clearing together
It is an old ruins, with paintings of a couple on the broken walls] What do you think became of them
They were lives
just lived
find myself imaging things in this place
decorate it
Books, a harp there
a child
Would it be his or mine
would have no way to tell, would
He is a kind man Tristan,  cannot hate him
Yesterday at the market  saw a couple holding hands, and  realised we would never do that
Never anything like it
No picnics or unguarded smiles
No rings
Just stolen moments that leave too quickly
[In the marketplace Isolde and Marke shop
Tristan steals some herbs and makes a wreath for Isolde
He surreptitiously slips it onto Isoldes wrist as Merlot and Wictred look on] [Later, Marke goes to his bedroom but finds Bragnae waiting] Where is Isolde
dont know for sure, she was having a walk in the garden before and Im afraid  got tired so  returned
Its my fault
[Bragnae goes to find Tristan and Isolde who are meeting in secret] Youre going to get caught
Both of you
Hes looking for you right now, hell see you
told you this would happen
There is another door here, forgotten
This comes up in the bottom chamber of the keep
hate this
Hurry
Go on
[Isolde and Bragnae go down] Im tired of this
Im tired of lying for you
Im sick of it
Then dont
[Isolde goes to bed with Marke] There is a servings child, quite ill
Doing better now
didnt ask you were you were
Your heart is beating so fast
Is it
Isolde
Is there anything  can do to make you happier
want to make you happy
Im fine
[Wictred speaks to King Donnchadh in secret] Shes in love with Tristan
Theyre intimates
If  expose them it will break Markes heart and his hold on the other Barons
How
With Markes champion in chains, well take Castle Dor
You can man your armies unopposed
There will be no one defending you in the waters
And your price
want Markes throne
[As the King leaves he talks to Bodkin] When his throne falls apart, well go over and pick up the pieces
[Marke approaches Tristan as he looks over the town] Tristan
Can  speak with you
Is it possible
do you think a man blinded by love
Is it possible that that man might not see treachery right in front of him
[Takes out wreath] found this hidden amoung Isolde's things
Do you think she has a lover
Has she said anything to you
No
Perhaps you could follow her
cant ask anyone else
know
know what you think  Im acting like a child
Normally  can read faces, but with hers  feel like
can't be objective
Shes so delicate
You really love her
Oh
do
terribly
didnt know how empty  was
She sustains me, she thrills me
And when  see this ring, it is a ring of thorns
The ring is nothing
She's loyal to you
am sure of it
If you say so
[Tristan is tortured by Markes proclamation and burns his and Isoldes meeting place
Isolde finds it in ruins
The Irish arrive on ships for the coronation ceremony] count nine If they move they will warn us with a black flag [The King of Ireland arrives and shakes hands with a waiting Marke] You bring an entourage
can let myself be alone in my position Lord Marke
But dont worry, they will stay offshore
miss you
My nephew, Merlot of Cornwall And Tristan, slayer of my best general, winner of Isolde, defender of the alliance
You are a fortunate man
Indeed
[Inside the castle the coronation is held in Latin
Marke and Isolde are crowned and take their seats on their thrones
Back at the lookout point the flag bearers are stabbed by the Irish
Dancing happens at the coronation celebrations] Tristan
Seems  worried for nothing
May  dance with the Queen, or does Tristan have the next one
Thats right, you have never danced with Isolde before
[Tristan is pushed forward to dance with Isolde] new song for Tristan
Slow
Why did you burn it
You know
Meet me there in an hour or Ill die
[The dance ends] could still teach you a thing or two, dancing being one of them
Accuse him now
No, no, no
Well have more than accusations
[Tristan leaves] Is something the matter
Im just feeling a little weary thats all
might just go and have a lie down
Of course
[Isolde leaves] Friends, friends hear me
Weve forgotten the full moon isnt it time to ride out
No
Tonight it cause for exception
But the coronation should uphold tradition, surely it is not to be neglected already
We honour it
In half a night
Ride out
Wheres Tristan
[Everyone leaves to hunt while Tristan and Isolde race to be with each other] miss Ireland Isolde, this must end
Thats like asking me to stop breathing
It cannot be
[Elsewhere Wictred leads the hunt to where Tristan and Isolde are] Please dont leave me
Please
[They kiss only to have the hunting party come upon them] Isolde
There is someone
No
see how it is in Cornwall
My money is good enough, my alliance is good enough, but my daughter you pass amoung your lieutenants like a whore
Its not like that
see no relation to me here
will see this peace end
You have brought the allegiance to shame
Who would fight for this
[Wictred and King Donnchadh ride off] Seize him
Seize him
Behold your hero uncle   would have no heroes now
[Further away the Irish march towards Dor
Bodkin speaks to King Donnchadh] Theyre ashore
Prove your worth
If a man cant rule his woman, how can he govern an entire Kingdom
He cant
We have suffered peace
Its all been coming apart
can feel it Youre right
[Wictred rides up] There is very little time
Fortunately, Donnchadh has no quarrel with anybody here
Hes asked me to give you a message
Whats this
It is compensation for the men you will lose attacking Castle Dor with Donnchadh tomorrow
Lets be honest, our people need a stronger leader
And who might that be, Wictred
Melot
Too long the ablest amoung us has been denied his rightful place
pledge you my legiance and offer him my services as his second
like this plan
[Tristan is in chains in the keep
Marke comes down to see him] came to apologise
Ive been selfish arrogantly thinking that perhaps Id given enough
At least enough to merit if not your love then at least your respect
You have a home
kingdom
Why was it not enough
Tell me
Tell me
You do not know what you have done
Everything is destroyed, everything
All because you did not have enough
Shes loyal to you  am sure of it
You bloodsucker
What could it had been had  not stretched out my hand to save your life
How  curse that day, how curse it
And so be with your defence
Then  will go complete your punishment, Donnchadh marches on us as we speak
[Marke strides away
Bragnae catches up to him in a corridor
She bars entrance to his bedroom] Shes young
will not let you harm her
[Marke moves Bragnae out of the way and enters the room] How long
Since you thought he was dead
found him wounded on the beach in Ireland
hid him from my father and  told him my name was Bragnae
So when he came to the tournament at Dunluce to win Donnchadhs daughter he didnt realise it was me
All this time my heart has been his, and  am sorry
He tried harder than you can possibly imagine because he loves you
[Marke leaves the room in silence] [Merlot and Wictred walk through the forest discussing plans] will coax him out, make sure Donnchadh knows this
Of course, of course
You know as things moved along  suspected them for some time
Tristan and Isolde
You know what  could never work out
How it was conducted
How she got in and out of Dor unseen
The tunnel
What
The Roman Tunnel
Show me
[ henchman released Tristan from the prison and takes him to the riverside where Isolde and Bragnae are waiting with a boat] What is this
The will of the King
Farwell
told him about Ireland
Hes given us our freedom
Why does loving you feel so wrong
Get in
Tristan, if  do this
For all time, they will say it was our love that brought down a kingdom
Remember us
[Tristan pushes the boat away] Tristan, dont
Tristan
Tristan
Tristan
Why
Tristan
[Tristan runs back to Dor] [At Dor they bring everyone into the castle and close the gates
The armies close in on Dor] Get the livestock and fuel undercover
Put some archers on the ramparts
All the archers have deserted us as has half the household
And you stay
If you are surprised then they have won already
Come on, hurry
[The armies gather outside the keep] Burn it
Their will is as strong as milk
The seas will unravel us
Where is Wictred with his key
[At the tunnel entrance] It comes up to the Roman foundations at the lowest level
This is a godsend
[They both enter it and Wictred gestures for his men to follow] [There is much fighting as the forces of the Irish and traitorous barons besiege Castle Dor
In the tunnel, Wictred and Melot move towards the keep] What will you say to him
That he will not make any more mistakes and that it is time for him to move ba  whats that
[The two turn to see Wictreds men following them down the tunnel
Melot fights to stop them going down the tunnel but is stabbed] [The enemy forces break through the outer gates and are attempting to get into the keep] Aim for the front of the line They are waiting
[As Wictred and his men enter the keep from the tunnel below, Tristan enters the tunnel from the forest entrance] The Irish are inside
Follow me
Bar the door make sure no one gets in
[In the tunnel, Tristan comes upon a wounded Melot] You
What happened here
reward for idiocy
dozen Irish have blazed your way
Melot,  came to aid Marke
Everyone lies
didnt lead them here
No,  did
Why
thought someone believed in me
It will be undone
TristanIm for the wormsswear to me that you are true
As we were brothers
Build my boat
[Melot dies] [Tristan makes his way to the keep while Marke and his men do battle with Wictreds] Theyre here
Keep them back
Wictred
Hes trying to lower the bridge Traitor
Give me your shield, were pinned down
[Tristan attacks Wictred and his men] Tristan
Him too
No, hes with us
[Marke and his men jump into battle, but not before Tristan is stabbed
Tristan manages to stop the drawbridge falling with his sword
He is again stabbed by Wictred] Tristan
[Tristan stabs Wictred and kills him
Tristan pulls the sword from his body as the battle subsides] Tristan
How did you get here
Secret
Secrets, in the bowls of the keep
In the bowls of the keep
They have reached the palisades
Then we must keep hope
[Tristan cuts the head off Wictreds body and slowly stands
Marke nods] [As the drawbridge of the keep is lowered, King Donnchadh makes his way to the front] Get back
Ha ha ha
Ha ha ha
[Tristan slowly steps out with the head of Wictred in his hands] Behold
The head of a traitor
[Marke and his generals step out] Will you always be little men, who cannot see what was and could be again
There is no middle ground
So slay us  or slay him
Oblidge them
Oblidge them
[He attacks people around him, but is shot in the back by an arrow
Suddenly the Irish and the British start to fight
Tristan falls to the ground and Marke runs to his side] Take me out of here
Take me to the river
[Isolde comes to the battle and is grabbed by General who drags her to the riverside] Hurry
Bring her
Marke, you must come, the battle needs you
Well lose everything
must heed their call,  am the King
Weve driven them back as far as we can but they are holding us at the throat
Goodbye my friend
[Marke and his generals leave and Isolde goes to Tristans side] Know that  love you Tristan
And wherever you go, whatever you see,  will always be with you
You were right
do not know if life is greater than death, but love was more than either
[Tristan dies and Isolde weeps
We see Tristan and Isolde back in the hut in Ireland as she reads to him] "My face in thine eyes, thine in mine appears, And true plain hearts do in the faces rest; Where can we find two better hemispheres, Without sharp north, without declining west
Whatever dies, was not mixed equally; If our two loves be one, or thou and
Love so alike, that none can slacken, none can die
" [They kiss] Their love did not bring down a kingdom
Legend says that Marke defeated the Irish, rebuilt Castle Dor and reigned in peace until the end of his days
Isolde laid Tristan beneath the ashes of the Roman ruin, planted his grave with two willows that grew forever intertwined
then disappeared
