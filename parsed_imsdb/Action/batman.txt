"Batman", early draft, by Sam Hamm Screenplay by Sam Hamm Based on the Character Created by Bob Kane October 20, 1986 : - The place is Gotham City
The time, 1987 -- once removed
The city of Tomorrow: stark angles, creeping shadows, dense, crowded, airless, a random tangle of steel and concrete, self-generating, almost subterranean in its aspect
as if hell had erupted through the sidewalks and kept on growing
dangling fat moon shines overhead, ready to burst
- Amid the chrome and glass sits a dark and ornate Gothic anomaly: old City Cathedral, once grand, now abandoned -- long since boarded up and scheduled for demolition
On the rooftop far above us,   gaze down from their shadowy, windswept perches, keeping monstrous watch over the distant streets below, sightless guardians of the Gotham night
One of them is moving
- The pulsing heart of downtown Gotham, a neon nightmare of big-city corruption, almost surreal in its oppressiveness
Hookers wave to drug dealers
Street hustlers slap high- fives with three-card monte dealers
They all seem to know each other
with one conspicuous exception: , Mom, Dad, and little Jimmy, staring straight  ahead as they march in perfect lockstep down the main drag
They've just come out of a bit show two blocks over; the respectable theatre crowd has thinned out, and now -- Playbills in hand -- they find themselves adrift in the predatory traffic of Gotham's meanest street
For God's sake, Harold, can we please just get a taxi 'm trying to get a -- (shouting) Three cabs streak pass and disappear
grimaces in frustration as   consults a subway map
We're going the wrong way
Nearby,   are beginning to snicker

Put that away
We'll look like tourists

) We'll never get a cab here
Let's cut over to Seventh
Seventh is that way

-   - deserted access street, sidewalks lined with the husks of stripped-down cars
, , and  take a deep breath and march down the darkened street
startles them
Hey, mister
Gimme a dollar
The  belongs to a  -- nineteen or twenty, acne-scarred -- who sits between two garbage cans, his palm uplifted
His ratty t-shirt reads: '
' , , and  pause for the merest of seconds, then move on -- pretending not to hear
Mister
How about it
One dollar
(standing up) One dollar , man
Are you deaf Are you deaf -- Do you speak English By now the  are halfway across the street
Mercifully, the  doesn't seem to be following
They pick up their pace
They don't see the in the alleyway
They don't see the  until a gloved hand brings it down, butt-first, across the back of 's neck
crumples
grabs  and backs up against a brick wall, too terrified to scream
The  races across the street to join his confederate, the  , who's already searching for 's wallet
's mouth opens in panic
They can see she's about to snap -- so  the  , still in a crouch, trains his gun on
Do the kid a favor, lady
Don't scream
The poor woman is utterly horrified
stream down her face
But she keeps her wits about her, stifles the urge to shriek, and hustles  off down the street
The two  watch them break into a run -- then chuckle, slap hands, race off in the opposite direction
- Six stories up
The  --  and  -- hunker down on the tar-and-gravel roof, sizing up their take
(emptying the wallet) All right
The Gold Card
(tossing the credit card in 's face) Don't leave home without it
chill wind whips across the roof as  extracts the cash and begins to count it
There's a distant, indistinct : metal on metal
hears it and tenses up
Let's beat it, man
don't like being up here
What, scared of heights
dunno, man
After what happened to Johnny Gobs -- Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right
No big loss
That ain't what  heard
That ain't what  heard at all
(beat) heard the bat got him
Gimme a break, will you
Shut up
Five stories, straight down
There was no blood in the body
No shit
It was all over the pavement
has no patience with campfire tales -- but here on the roof, in the pale moonlight, he can't ignore the slight tingle at the base of his spine
There was no blood, man
(beat) My brother says
all the bad things you done
they come back and haunt you
Listen to this
How old are you
There ain't no bat My brother's a priest, man
No wonder you're such a chickenshit
Now shut up (conclusively) There ain't no bat
As they speak our attention shifts to a point at the opposite corner of the roof, some fifteen yards away
where, at the end of a line, a    is dropping slowly, implacably, into frame
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man
You shouldn'ta -- Do you want this money or don't you
Now shut up
Shut up -- at the sudden, inexplicable sound of They turn slowly
Their Standing at the edge of the roof, bathed in moonlight, is a stands rooted to the spot, a choked gurgle in his throat, as if he's just seen his own death
The advances, spreading  its arms
Or rather, its : , flapping in the wind
drops to the gravel, gropes for the gun, brings it up
And still the   draws closer, deliberate, menacing
On its chest:     , in an oval yellow field, glowing like a target in the darkness
The strange black figure is knocked bodily to the roof
Trembling, sweating buckets,  gets to his feet
He whacks a motionless  on the arm -- (cont
) 'm gettin' outta here
-- and bends to retrieve his loot
lets out a strange, pre-verbal squeal
and  sees   ,    , , ,
Panic
Sheer, raw, unrelenting panic
Stolen money flutters out of 's hands
He scuttles around the periphery of the roof, his feet skidding on the gravel as he searches for a way down
The   is blocking his path to the fire escape
Trapped like a rat,
is frozen in place, his eyes glazed over, his face drained of blood
The  treads calmly past
snakes out
catches  high on the chest -- --       -- --
slams into a brick chimney and slumps to the roof unconscious, a broken, weightless puppet
,  , sees his chance and past the black wraith, scrambling toward the fire escape
slices through the air, and  pitches forward, his legs ensnared in a tangle of
Screaming now, he drags himself across the gravel roof, the looming figure of the  at his heels
until there's no place left to go
cowers against the ledge, his pants torn, his hands and knees bloody
He has dissolved into total mindless hysteria
Almost by reflex,  keeps shooting
He'd do better if he could manage to open his eyes
By now the hammer is falling on an empty chamber, but  continues, obsessively, to pull the trigger
He weeps; he moans; he wails
grabs a fistful of 's shirt, and with supernatural ease   into the air
(cont
) Don't kill me
don't kill me
When  finally opens his eyes, he realizes   is standing on the ledge of the roof --   , at arm's length, over six stories of nothingness
The gruesome black apparition speaks, in a rasping whisper: won't kill you
want you to do me a favor
looks down
Far, far below,  wink silently past
He looks up
And sees, in the mirrored lenses where 's eyes should be, the twin reflections of his own stricken face
(cont
) Tell your friends
Tell all your friends
Almost as an afterthought,   heaves him roughly back onto the roof
And then -- casually, without a moment's hesitation -- ,
Trembling,  crawls to the ledge and looks over
finding    of the Batman
is still screaming as we   to the bilious yellow globe of Gotham's moon
: : '  - An oversized   fills one wall: "

We   to find the man himself, determined, dynamic  , addressing a crowd from behind his podium
it is no longer enough to go after the small-time punks and petty criminals who infest the streets of Gotham City
Crime and corruption must be attacked at the root
- Civic-minded politicos decked out in fund-raiser finery
They applaud 's tough talk wildly
They've just shelled out $500 a plate for a chicken dinner, and by God they're going to enjoy this
Tuxedoed  move among the tables, deftly refilling water glasses
As they do, we  an    -- the only one in the hall
Some well-meaning moneybags has laid out half a grand and then neglected to show up

Original paintings and sculptures everywhere

This most unusual deck sports a

Decent people shouldn't live here
They'd be much happier someplace else
, 32, is right-hand man and chief enforcer to Boss Carl Grissom
His features are delicate, almost feminine, and he takes a vain, gangsterish pride in his appearance
He is also absolutely merciless
He trains a cold eye on 's televised image as -- 26, beautiful, Carl Grissom's kept woman -- glides over in her negligee and snuggles up
Anything new
The usual gas
If this clown could lay a hand on Grissom
would've had to kill him by now
finds 's necktie draped over a nearby chair
She begins knotting it playfully about his neck
If Grissom knew about us he might kill you seems uninterested in her affections
His eye darts back and forth between the  and his own reflection in a nearby vanity
Don't think so, angel
'm too valuable
That's the way 've planned it
(pause) And besides, he doesn't know
checks his watch, reaches for his topcoat, and stands in front of the vanity
He runs a hand through sculpted hair, checks out his Albert Nipon ensemble
You look just fine, Jack
He smiles at himself before turning to the door

: - The scene of the earlier mugging, a half-block off Gotham Square
Only now, the deserted alleyway is a beehive of activity: police cars, an ambulance, a forensics van
goes past on a stretcher, catatonic
Watching him are a porcine cop,
, and a That one there won't say a word
The other one's raving his head off
Variety, huh
The spice of life
At the mouth of the alley, we find   -- thirty, hyperactive, a crime reporter for the Gotham Gazette At the moment, he's chatting with a uniformed They found him hugging a drainpipe
He was scared to come off the roof
Great, but tell me: is this another you-know-what
'Cause if so, it's the third one this week
(testily) dunno
What's "what"
Good answer
'm gonna put you in for a commendation
spots  and the , waves cheerily, and saunters down the alley
curses under his breath
Oh Christ, it's Knox
Hiya, gents
This anything  should know about
Nothing out of the routine
At this exact moment two uniformed  drag a brain- fried  past the mouth of the alley
bat ,  tell you, a giant bat He wanted me to do him a favor tilts one eyebrow
and the  trade disgusted looks
No offense, boys, but these guys are seeing something up there
No comment
Print what you like
Come on
One question
Is there a six-foot bat in Gotham City
's tone is jokey, but only half-jokey
snorts in disgust and turns away
shouts after him: (cont
) If so, is he on the police payroll
If so, what's he pulling down after taxes
-   - We pick up
as he emerges onto the side street
He's headed for his car when he spies a   idling across the street
Leaning on the hood, waving hi, is the dandyish   -- flanked by two impressive

He turns left, gestures to  to meet him farther up the block
By the time he reaches the corner  has swaggered up alongside him
takes a fat brown envelope from  and stuffs it quickly in his coat
You didn't show up
We had another bat sighting
'm sure that was vitally important
Listen: things are heating up
Someone is leaking information to Harvey Dent

There's no love lost between these two

If it's a problem -- Eckhardt
our problems are your problems
'll work on it
reaches out and grabs  by the lapels of his topcoat -- an Italian job, obviously expensive
He rubs the material between his fingers
Very nice, Lieutenant
But a little ostentatious on a cop's salary, don't you think
(knocking his hands away) answer to Grissom, punk
Not to you
You're a smart boy, Eckhardt
You should be thinking about the future
laughs in his face
Ambition
(nodding his head) Forget it, Jack
You'll never run that organization
And why's that
You're a psycho, friend
You're an -one crazy boy and Grissom knows it
lashes out and   across the face
The fat cop, stunned, turns bright red and
claps a hand on 's face and shoves him back full-force
The cop sprawls on his ass in the doorway of an all-night Cuban-Chinese restaurant
By now  are staring out of the restaurant windows
is livid
His hand goes instinctively to his gun
Here
Use mine
pulls an automatic from his pocket and tosses it in 's lap
He looks down and laughs, daring to pick it up -- just as the two enormous  from the stretch limo appear behind him for reinforcement
wipes blood from his mouth as  -- an -one crazy-boy grin on his face -- reaches down for the gun
(cont
) It's all right, boys
Lt
Eckhardt here is a good cop
real good cop

The caption at the top reads: "

(cont
) Nice, but
maybe a little more gore on the fangs, huh
He pats  on the shoulder, moves on spots him and calls out: Hey Knox, you got a visitor
'm real busy, Clark
Be a pal and dust him, okay
This one you might want to dust yourself
Curiosity piqued,  moves toward his desk
and stops in his tracks
Propped up on the desk are a

Vicki Vale
The hat tips back
, her face framed by a shock of bright red hair, flashes a dazzling smile
She pulls over for a quick smooch and laughs
How'd you know it was me
Honey --  would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale

He points at the oversized   on his desk
It bears the monogram "

) Where the hell have you been
nice, restful vacation
She reaches into the camera bag and pulls out a stack of glossy 8x10's:   from some unspecified war-torn corner of the world
leafs though them, impressed
God, a girl could get hurt doing this
do get hurt
She unbuttons her sleeve, rolls it back to show  a long fresh scar on the inside of her arm
He winces -- then points to the scar and adds, slyly: Got any more of those
Nothing 'm at liberty to reveal here
What's new and hot in Gotham City
It's too good, Vick
We got a six- foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers
(laughing) Evildoers, huh
Big or small
Small so far
mean -- they don't allow bats in boardrooms, do they
Speaking of which

Yeah
Hottest ticket in town
Every law'n'order freak in the city's gonna be there

It's just occurred to him that may have a purpose in all this

) Wa-a-it

You're not saying -- She reaches back into her camera bag and hands over an is all but panting with excitement
(cont
) Aw, Vicki
Vicki
(apprehensively) Got a date
She flutters her great big eyelashes, shakes her head no
grabs her face and plants a kiss on her forehead, nearly knocking her out of the swivel chair
(cont
) Vicki, baby,  love you, 've always loved you
Will you marry me
(straightening her clothes) No
Well, 'm starving
Will you at least buy me a hamburger
Yes, but please -- be gentle
Overwhelmed with glee, he offers her his arm

This spectacular penthouse suite is just one of the power perks available to  , kingpin of the Gotham City rackets, fat, fifty, and utterly without charm

Nine points ahead in the new poll don't like the way this is shaping up

We can always pop him

Let's feed him to the bat
This suggestion draws  from several members of the crowd

He's going after our front companies
Specifically Ace Chemical
Which would tie us in with Councilman Kane, Senator Miller
on up the line
(pause) We have to clean out our files before the subpoena comes down
How do we go
The usual fire
'm thinking break-in
Trash the office, remove the relevant documents
"Industrial espionage
" That's right
And Jack -- (pause) 'd like you to handle this operation personally
has just turned up the third ace off the top of the deck
His hand freezes in midair

She's carrying a handful of
Hello, sweetheart
wonder if you'd mind waiting in the other room
's gaze meets 's as she vanishes through a side door
The eye contact is not lost on
Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in
(emphatically) Because  want someone  can trust bridles, but doesn't protest
Nervously, he turns the fourth card off the top of the deck
It's not an ace
It's a  -- a Joker with a neat, round,
22 calibre through its face

) We'll work out the details later
But it's got to be soon

It's casino night at Wayne Manor; the ballroom has been outfitted with roulette wheels, blackjack tables, etc

She smiles and takes his arm
Yeah,  guess we move in different circles

We're going out

Okay, boys, let's broaden our minds

Unfortunate, but  think we can work around it

She won't run

Much worse
Strong stomach, huh

The current time is 7:09
He sits cross-legged on the floor, slumps forward slightly, and closes his eyes

His muscles relax

Across the Harbor, Ace Chemical is going up in flames -- but as far as the crowd can tell, with all the noise and excitement, it's just another part of the celebration

The frightened  turn in unison
An abrupt flurry of motion -- feet and fists flying -- quick flashes of red and green -- -- and   lie paralyzed on the street

His ribs are crushed

Then   appears, hot on his trail, sprinting up the steps two at a time

He kneels behind a rear pew, brings up the gun, and squeezes off at the
The  dives, takes cover, and '
Then: silence
In a crouch, groping his way along the wall, finds what he wants: a small door opening on a wooden stairway, leading to the belltower
He ducks inside and starts up
'  drops with a thud
His hand slips from the back of the pew
In the second before he slumps to the floor, unconscious, he sees a curious sight: a , imbedded in the flesh of his leg
Behind him -- framed in the arched doorway -- begins his final unholy march down the center aisle of the old cathedral
-  - tiny stone chamber, 8'x8', open on four sides to the wind
The enormous church bell has long since been removed
The  stands in an archway, gazing at the gargoyles on the roof below
He hits a button on the walkie-talkie: 'm in the belltower
Don't land
-  - replies through his radio headset
two minutes
Hang on
The  swings the copter right in a wide, swooping arc
-   - Broken, beaten, his right leg useless, he hauls himself up the steps one at a time
He should be dead Dried blood cakes his face, his chest
Dizzy, exhausted, his body strained to the limit, he slumps against a wall to steady himself, then reaches into his utility belt for a painkiller -- and forces the capsule back onto his dry, swollen tongue
Quaking all over, he tries to draw himself erect
and , landing with his full weight on the rotten wood of the belltower stairs
, turning to splinters beneath him
And suddenly  finds himself , hanging by one hand to an upper step
It would be so much easier to let go
He looks down at the fragments of the shattered stairway,  , vanishing into the dark depths of the stairwell
Then he looks up
At the trapdoor
mere six feet away
His   in a monstrous grimace ,
For a full five seconds he's blind with pain is buried in his right shoulder
Twitching, trembling, he reaches up and    with his last ounce of strength
The trapdoor is a foot above his head
It could be a mile
finally realizes he's not going to make it
He reaches down and rips open a Velcro seal on his utility belt, revealing the strange   we saw him making earlier
Before he can activate it his hand falls limply at his side
is out like a light
-   - The  glances casually down at the trapdoor, wondering what all the noise is about
He draws his gun, moves cautiously to the trapdoor, and lifts it a few inches
just enough to see the unconscious form on the stairs
Batman
No reply
The  stands there and lets out a little snicker
He looks out through the archway, sees no sign of his rescue copter
Then -- a look of curious amusement on his face -- he steps down    and up into the belltower
He props  up against a wall
Still no sign of life
The  crouches beside him and -- almost tenderly -- pats his face

The  makes a futile grab at the rope ladder, almost losing his purchase on the archway parapet
He gestures wildly for the copter to make another pass
0:12 to go
maelstrom of swirling leaves
And now, among the leaves -- roused from their resting place in the rotten rafters of the old cathedral -- --    , Filling the air like a black cloud, , taking flight in blind uncomprehending fury -- The  leaps into empty space, grabs hold of the ladder, cackles in mad triumph -- -- , , - -- -- --     --      -- -- and plunges into the night
Six seconds remain
There is still time if he makes his choice now
Surrounded by the flapping of leathery wings, his body working on pure adrenalin, he unbuckles the belt
Lurches into position
Heaves it out into the darkness
It snags on the bottom rung of the dangling rope ladder
-  - The - is hanging out one side of the copter, just enough to see what's going on

The world has grown suddenly silent
We're looking down at the , whose body lies splayed and broken on the flagstone surface of the churchyard
Slowly, elegantly -- we have all the time in the world, now -- we  , closer, until his , the familiar chilling grin still intact
Sad clown, -one crazy boy, staring aimlessly at the stars
Suddenly his face is bathed in a brilliant gasoline
Looking up he sees a beautiful display of fireworks, bursting and burning, spirals of color snaking through the sky as the helicopter explodes in eerie silence
-  ' It's all so lovely
The 's expression is happy, almost childlike, as he gazes up at this private show
Gradually, though, the bright colors fade; and the 's face begins to relax, the twisted grin dissolving at last as darkness sets in
