There is a  at the end of the alley

He's watching with

But there's nothing there
He continues on
Then the Intruder comes sliding down the - from above
He kicks the Hacker into the wall, knocking him out
The Intruder pulls off his mask, revealing the chiseled features of a dashing
His name is hate to drop in unexpectedly
Sterling searches the Hacker and pulls a from his coat
Inside the case is a
Sterling tucks it away
Sterling unzips his black jumpsuit, revealing a crisp underneath
He pulls out
In a quick insert we see the "-"
As he strolls back out the alley, he  something and flattens against the wall

The 's  illuminate the slumped Hacker

Cornered, Sterling heads deeper into the alley, staying in the shadows
He gets to that  the Hacker was heading towards
As he    Sterling can hear  from inside
He smooths his hair and prepares to "blend in" with the crowd
- Sterling comes through the door and his face falls
He's stepped into a loud
We see a -  in
Onstage is , a bizarre German industrial-metal band
The tattooed   slam dances and swings glo-stix over their heads
Some wear rubber   outfitted with fiber optic lights
It's a sea of   and Sterling squares his jaw and starts pushing through the crowd
With his tuxedo he sticks out like a penguin in a chicken coop
stands a wild haired young with
With him is a - with multi-colored hair
They look like a post-Apocalyptic Bonnie & Clyde
They are  and
Yorgi checks his watch
His delivery is late
Then his rings
He's getting the news from outside
He looks down, spots Sterling amidst the moshing crowd
With that look, that tux, there's no mistaking what he is
They make   and Sterling gives a little nod
Yorgi calmly issues orders into his phone
Immediately  starts moving in Sterling's direction
Viktor is huge, with a  and a six-inch
Sterling sees him advancing and makes for the exit, pushing through the freaky crowd
- Sterling's -  screeches away from the curb

He plugs the into the dash and punches buttons

He sees a -  racing up behind him
He accelerates and hits a

Viktor rolls down the passenger window, readies his
The rear bumper of the spy car opens

They explode in  , obscuring the narrow, street
Sterling skids around a corner
The blinded bad guys drive straight into a
Glass and merchandise flies as the  gets stuck
The Aston-Martin rounds another corner and slides to a stop
Blocking the road ahead are two more 's
slides to a stop in front of them
The rider is , a leather clad biker who looks half Viking
Anders pulls out a  -  and starts into the Aston-Martin, cracking the bullet-proof glass, shattering headlights, and
Sterling jams it into reverse and backs around the corner on the

Sterling looks around desperately
Somehow he's got to get this data out of here
Straight ahead is the
Chugging up the river: a in formal attire dance to an orchestra is in the middle of the deck for a perfect water landing
Time for a slow boat to China
He hits a

Flames spew as he jams down the accelerator
Sterling is pushed back into his seat by the -forces

Anders  with his gun, but Sterling is getting away
But then  steps around the corner
He's academic looking, a   intellectual with - He's also a highly proficient and cold-blooded Kirill puts his lit cigarette behind his ear and unslings a --   from his shoulder
The Aston-Martin reaches the riverbank and goes
It through the air towards the party barge
We see the car  in Kirill's glasses as he
On a little  we see the missile launcher   on the   of the jet engine
The missile locks-in and
- we see a   with all its hot spots Camera  towards the flying car
- -  - Sterling sees the missile streaking at him
Oh bloody hell
- The Aston-Martin  in mid-air
Partygoers shriek as the  and   rain down on the deck
Kirill takes the cigarette from his ear,
Finally, Sterling's flaming   flutters down and lands on a   - above a tantalizing : over the city
We make a sudden left turn and
We shoot over to the    of
In the middle of  we dive towards a -  - Inside it's modern, cold and high tech
An elevator to a deep basement level
The doors open and a   man with a strides down the empty hall
is African- American, a battle-scarred
Even with a limp he looks sturdy, confident, deadly
At the end of the hall is a
- Gibbons walks into the   of the ()
There are  , on  ,  monitoring everything
If a nuclear war broke out, you could run the country from down here
Gibbons takes an elevator up
'  - The office is expensive yet devoid of personality, reflecting the shadowy nature of it's owner
One wall is , looking down on the information room
, grizzled  chief, looks down at the activity below
Come
Gibbons enters, stands by the desk
Evening, Sam
Sam remains in shadow
What do you have
Not a whole helluva lot
His final transmission was mangled
About something or someone called "Ahab"
Whatever it is, it cost him his life
He was the best there was
That makes three agents lost
They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower
It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night
Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys We're gonna have to step in, Sam
Those  boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus
Let me take care of it
How will you fix it
'll go in with a team
But first 'm going to need some intel
'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming
One of their own
So you'll dredge the bottom again
You've done that before
The results were
uneven
You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat
've had my people put together a talent pool
downloaded it to your desktop
Gibbons snaps on the giant  on Sam's desk
He starts cycling through    of
The usual prospects
Convicts, contract killers, murde
The scum of the Earth
But programmable
And expendable
've seen enough
Turn it off
Gibbons clicks off the screen
They're degenerates
There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over
That's exactly why we need them
Sam sighs, stares out at the information room
Get these "scum", Mr
Gibbons, bring them in
Test them
Train them
Find your man

The elevator arrives and the door swings open
But there's
One Guard steps forward and suddenly a bicycle from the ceiling,
He falls back, another Guard
Jacket Man drops down onto his bike and pedals through the chaos before the Guards know what hit them
There's a in the room, some kind of modern art statue
Jacket Man rides up the artwork like a ramp and does a over a
He hits the ground pedalling, the Guards hot after him
Jacket Man enters a    with a in the middle
He bunny hops onto a desk and He tosses back his hood and we get a good look at him for the first time
He is
He's got a shaved head, bizarre all over his body and multiple
He's lean and heavily cut, even dangerous looking
The Guards charge at him and he  up onto the top of the This thing is maybe    and He pedals across the top of the cubicle wall, the Guards scrambling after him
Xander bunny hops over one guy's head onto the next set of cubicles and pedals hard
The Guards fall all over themselves trying to catch him
At the other end Xander catches air and lands on a He does a  across it's length with Guards closing in
Xander springs up and does a  , knocking them back with his rear wheel
He lands and pedals to the stairwell untouched

From here he can drop down onto another level that is strewn with   and
Guards rush onto the roof and try to corral him
Xander tears off his jacket, revealing a  on his back and   on his chest
He pulls out a and

Then he    off the building
- The Accomplices see the flare drop
#'s 1, 2 & 3 pull and start filming
- Xander races around the roof like a trapped animal
He evades Security Guards, picking up speed
With Guards right behind, he drops off the   and lands on a massive
Using the dish as a ramp, Xander  himself We're talking 90 some stories here
He spins through the air, his bike on fire
He's doing end over end backflips
One
Two
Three
Four
He's looping through space on his bike, a crazy man on a flaming bike against a backdrop of sleek skyscrapers and night lights
The stunt is covered by the various Accomplices and Xander's own chest camera, in  8 and  , from four different angles
Xander ditches the bike, kicking it away from him and plummets towards the ground
At the last moment he throws out a "bucket" and his - The bicycle comes flying down and  into the pavement
It bounces a full   back up before coming to rest
Xander glides down and makes his landing
Accomplices #4 and #5 rush out to help him gather up his chute and jump in the van
as the van makes it's escape
As   screech up to the skyscraper, one of them the smoking wreckage of the bike

: - Xander, now on a , zips through traffic
He's smiling, leaning it way over on the turns
He's got another on his back
-  - Xander drives his motorcycle into the garage of his building
'   - rises up, bringing Xander and his motorcycle into the loft
There are     on the walls, and  on the floor, and everywhere there's    of every description
Sky, you there
Start packin' cause we are out of here
There's a    hanging in a slightly crooked on the wall
Xander straightens it as he goes by
He hears her in the sectioned off "bedroom" and heads back there
Did  promise you a fat vacation or what
Get ready to get down in paradise
He comes into the bedroom to find , his long-suffering girlfriend
She's a wannabe artist type
She's got and  scattered around and she's
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation
Unless this ain't for going on vacation
'm through, Xander
can see that
Why
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance
It's insane, can't take it anymore
'm having fun, what's the problem
You have all this talent, and you waste it
You won't take a single endorsement deal
Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games
But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that
don't wanna go mersh, you know that
But hey, if this is about money
He opens up the backpack, revealing
got an advance on the next bootleg
Let's get out of here, just you and me
We'll chill out in Bora Bora for a couple months
She sorts through the money
French Polynesia
This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel
Do you know how expensive it is down there
Alright, so 'll get more
It's not about the money,
You never plan for anything
can't live like that anymore,  need some stability
Well if you're bailing,  guess 'd better give you your surprise now
He pulls off his shirt
Pierced through his nipple is a What
was gonna wait till the islands, but
You're serious
Of course 'm serious
bought it, didn't
(shakes her head) This is so typical
can't believe you
've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this
Are you out of your mind
don't know
thought this is what you wanted
You want stability, here it is
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere
You think that's going to solve our problems
'm sorry,
It was a kick for a while, but it's over
You're just not going anywhere
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself
You're wrong about that
'm heading out that door right now
She heads towards the front door
Just then the door
-- the windows   too
Then the as  in black body armor rush in, weapons drawn
It's a blur of ,  and
It's scary as hell
professional take-down
They slam Xander against the wall
Just like that it's quiet again
Sky hyperventilates, a gun in her face
She had nothing to do with the tower jump
She's nobody
just met her last night
Tell them
(with meaning) hardly know you
The Stormtrooper looks at Sky
She nods
The Stormtroopers take their guns off her
Sky grabs up here stuff
She looks back at Xander
Keep the ring
It looks better on you anyways
She heads out
God,  hate cops
What's the charges this time
The Stormtrooper pulls out a   and  Xander
He pulls a   from his chest, examines it
(groggy) You
pussies
Xander slides to the floor
'  - : an out of focus
Xander wakes up with his head on the counter of a
He shakes out the cobwebs
What the hell
as a  walks by
Xander blinks
Hey
Where am
How did  get here
don't know, you wandered in ten minutes ago and put your head down
told you we were closing
Xander looks around, sees a  chewing with his mouth open
buried in his
Xander gets up
Where the hell is he
He takes a step towards the door
Want some coffee
Huh
The Waitress pours him coffee
: her hands are shaking
You alright
(smiles) Fine, just fine
Come on and sit
'll get you something to eat
Yeah, sure
Xander sits
When he swigs his coffee, he notices something written on his napkin in shaky ballpoint: "
" What the hell
He looks at the Trucker
The Trucker's staring at the waitress
: The Trucker has a underneath his vest
then  : The Salesman's eyes darting about suspiciously, newspaper pulled up to his nose
Something is going down
He hears a    and glances back at the Trucker, who's now fixing him with a
Xander snaps from his reverie
What
said, you got a problem, boy
Problem
No, no problem
You go right ahead
With what
said, go right on ahead with what
Whatever, dude
The Trucker and the Salesman look at each other
Suddenly they jump up
The Trucker pulls a  from his vest, the Salesman brandishes the  he had behind the paper
The Waitress cringes
Alright, nobody make a move
(to Xander) Shoulda walked away when you had the chance, dumb shit
Forget him, Buck, let's just do it
Shut up
(in Xander's face) You keep still or 'm gonna make damn sure you stop breathing today
Got that
Xander stays strangely calm, his senses now fully focused
(shrugs) Alright, "Buck", whatever you say
The Waitress let's out a whimper
Keep your gotdam mouth shut and empty that register
Couldn't just let him leave, could ya
You know what 'm gonna do to ya for that
Huh
Do ya
She goes to open the register and knocks a tray of glasses on the floor
Xander springs into action
He  down on the Trucker's arm and  him in the face
Xander twists the gun out of his hand and kicks his legs out from under him
The Salesman pumps on his shotgun, but it seems to be jammed
Better shoot me quick
The Salesman fights with his gun but can't get it to work
Xander advances on him
Too late
He unleashes with a series of rapid front kicks to the jaw
The Salesman goes crashing through the kitchen doors
Xander turns to the terrified Waitress
Alright, bitch, what's going on
She stares at him, unable to speak
He raises the gun
Talk
What's the game
Who are you people
The front door bell
guy with an impeccably tailored suit and a cane hobbles in
It's Gibbons
There a problem, Mr
Cage
Who the hell are you
The name's Gibbons
You were saying
What is this place
Looks like a diner
Diner, huh
Let me tell you what the problem is
wake up drugged to find what
You've got a "salesman" over here reading a three week old newspaper
He's pulling a 211 with a "trucker", who happens to be packing a cop issue & 9mm
get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note
How's that for twisted logic
How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before  "walked" in
And if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until  woke up to gaffle the money
Then  notice how beefy they both are
Hell, even the waitress is cut
All three of them look like they went through the same training program
Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems
That's how  knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if  gave him all day
Why
He aims at the Waitress and
She's startled, but unhurt
Cuz there's nothing but blanks in these guns
And no offense, but their performances were terrible
Xander tosses the gun on the counter
Gibbons gives a sly smile
Not bad
Not bad at all
Have a seat
Gibbons sits in a booth
Xander sits across from him
In the background the Waitress helps the Trucker and Salesman up
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place
expected you to do the same
That shows me already that you don't have a clue
What's it to you, anyway
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct
That tells me something about your character
Good for you
Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want
You didn't go through all this for my benefit
It's your lucky day
You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy
Fed,  shoulda known
Who else would have this kind of budget
Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch
Alright, Cage, you've got me
This is one of those moments
"Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing
Your government needs you
Are you up for the challenge
If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy
Why is that
Look at me, dude, do  look like a fan of law enforcement
Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me woulda saved you a lot of trouble
Oh  don't know,  think the tests work pretty well
Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years
Are we done now
You've got nothing on me
So if you ain't booking me, 'm walking
You've got this wrong
You're not under arrest, you've been abducted
And until  say different, you belong to me
Is that a fact
Sure as gravity
've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage
It's nausea
(smiles) You know what  hate
Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God
(smiles) You know what  hate
It's always the assholes that pass the tests
There's a  and Xander clutches his stomach
Gibbons tosses his   onto the table
Xander blinks at him
He pulls another   from his gut and examines it
You bastards love to see me sleep
He goes face down on the table
: - ' He comes to, blinking in low
He's shocked to find that he's
- Xander's on the floor of a military aircraft are waking up next to him
One's a greaser named , the other is
, ex-Navy
Xander notices as they each pull out
They sit up, looking at each other
Xander chuckles
What's so damn funny
Been to any good diners lately
The three laugh, realizing they're all in the same boat
We must be the final "candidates"
They quiet down as they notice for the first time, Sitting silently on benches facing them are They wear   over their faces
They are a nasty looking
Nobody told me this was a costume party
The Black Ops Team, just stares
've worked with guys like this before
Black Ops
Serious government spooks
Virg notices something
They all have them
Heads up, man
What's this thing on my back
parachute
This does not argue well
Then the red light switches to
One of the Soldiers opens the
The rest of the team advances on Xander, Virg and
This is bullshit
Hey
They drag Virg to the door and
goes next, kicking and fighting
Then they turn on Xander
get the picture
Xander jumps out on his own
We see him tumbling away from the airplane
Far below his chute
- We see three chutes coming down
The first two
We   on the last chute as Xander lands like a pro
The other guys run up to him
Then they hear  in Jee-zus, man
What the hell now
Another damn test
We should head for those trees
Don't look at me, brother
It's every man for himself
They wrestle out of their chutes and push past each other as they
Xander runs low down a culvert
There's  all around
He flattens down and crawls up over the rise
What he sees stuns him
You gotta be kidding me
We crane up to reveal
There's a along the field's edge
The whole place looks exactly like a Central American
run around with -47's
Xander sneaks past  covered in
squad of Narcos runs by and Xander makes his move
He rounds another pile of equipment and comes right into the of a truck
Narcos hop out and charge forward
Xander raises his hands
You boys are too good for me
Guess failed this one, huh
They grab him and haul him away
- We see a
is wrapped around it
Attached to the chain, his arms over his head, is Xander
He's in the middle of a bleak looking room
There are on the wooden walls, the floor strewn with filthy Behind him against the wall Xander sees
and Virg both -
So much for "every man for himself"
Nice to see you again, fellas
They really went all out on this one
This is a pretty gnarly setup
Check the table in the corner
There's a     a  near the door
This oughta be good
Then they hear talking outside and the door is
very nasty looking Marco comes in
By his look he's the This must be el jefe
How's it goin' jefe
Some weather we're havin'
Narco Guards bring in one of their  and toss it on the floor
They exit, closing the door behind them
Jefe goes to the table throws back the towel
Beneath it are ,    : a  , a , , , a
What's on the menu tonight
The old blowtorch-to-the-family jewels routine, 'll bet
Hey, you want roasted nuts, let's break out the Planters
and Virg both crack up
Jefe gives them a withering look
Do you know what we do with people come round here
You know what we do with people come in our business
Jefe passes his hand over the various tools
He finally settles on a crude
He walks amongst them brandishing it
We cut the Achilles tendon
Your feet flop around like a marionette
You ain't walkin' nowhere no more
Sound good, tough guy
Or maybe instead you wanna tell me something
He stops in front of Xander
Whatchu doing here
Oh,  don't know
It was an accident
That's some accident, hombre
You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard
He  Xander across the face
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know
Army
You got some friends here, jump out with you guys
We're anti-social
We don't have any friends
Jefe  him again
No friends, huh
That's funny, don't know no
Army that comes without no friends
That's cuz
Army is pussies
They always come with the five hundred guys and the helicopters and the see-in-the-dark glasses
So don't you tell me you all alone out here, my friend
You bullshitting the wrong guy
Xander looks over at
and Virg
Who's writing this dude's dialogue
He's a pretty good actor, though
Makes the diner look like a sixth grade play
He's even got them crazy eyes
You ain't begun to see crazy yet, amigo
We're on to the game, ese
You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools
It's all very cute
But come on, let's quit while you're ahead
'm only trying to save you a beatin'
You saving me
You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling
(shrugs) Alright
You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest
Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy
Now 'm gonna take the whole foot off
Whatchu think of that
low  is heard outside
It's the sound of approaching , lots of them
Then the night  in
It sounds like a full scale assault outside
What's that, eh
thought you didn't have no friends
Jefe goes into a fury
He  his machete at Xander's legs
Xander  , grabbing on to the chain above, and Jefe in the chest
Jefe falls back and Xander climbs up to the roof
He grabs onto the beam with his legs and  his chain from the meat hook
He drops down, six feet of chain still hanging from his cuffed wrists, and Jefe comes charging at him
Xander dodges a few wild swings
He grabs Jefe's   and dumps him on his ass
Jefe scrambles to his feet, drawing his
Xander swings his chain and  the gun out of Jefe's hand
With another swing he  the chain around Jefe's neck and pulls it taught
Keys
You got 'em
Jefe nods, choking, and reaches into his pocket
Hand 'em to me
Instead Jefe hurls them out the window
hope you're getting paid extra for this
Xander jerks the chain, slamming Jefe head first into the wall
Jefe drops, knocked out
Outside it sounds like a full scale
Xander gets the machete and  the ropes holding
and Virg
Then a    sprays through the room
All three guys hit the deck but
gets shot
He clutches his side,  all over his hands
'm hit
'm hit
They're shooting for real
This is all real
Xander knows this is true
Aw shit
He checks out
's wound
Help me with this guy
It's like you said, every man for himself
Virg bolts for the door
That only works if you're a man
- Narcos are shouting, running to and fro
cut through the air
They are trying to repel an
Overhead    buzz the compound like Apocalypse Now, their   lighting up the place
Xander comes out of the torture building holding
in a fireman's carry
His hands are still , the length of chain dragging
Xander crouches behind some equipment, putting
on the ground
You alright
used to be a , it's not the first time 've been shot
Thanks, man
Keep your head down, 'll be right back
'm gonna steal us some wheels
Xander moves on, finds cover under the camouflage netting
He can see Narcos shooting into the trees at the
Looking the other way, he spots Virg running back his way
He's been corralled by one of the Helicopters
He's zigzagging, trying to stay out of the beam of it's Night Sun
Xander darts out and  him, pulling him under the camouflage netting
They're all over the place
What the hell's going on
Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war
The Helicopter lights up the camouflage netting
They're pinned down
Alright Mr
free-for-all, you go that way, 'm gonna go this way
They can't follow us both
They squat down in runners stances, the helicopter kicking up  all around them
Go
They jet off in opposite directions
Xander books, running for all he's worth
His cuffed hands and the dangling chain make it difficult
He's heading straight into the
Suddenly the massive  picks him out
Shit
The  swoops down after him
Its big   turn, aiming right at him
The guns cut loose, tearing up the ground right behind him
Xander sprints, the chopper after him like Cary Grant in "North By Northwest", except instead of corn fields, Xander's running through a field of
Xander hits the deck and the chopper soars over him
Xander cuts over a couple rows and hunkers down amongst the plants
All around him it's a chaos of Helicopters and
Two choppers attack the factory building,  it with their guns
Narcos run terrified
Xander notices a    on the plant right in front of him
He
'm gonna need to hit the trees after a night like this
He tucks it-into his shirt and takes off through the Xander finally spots a vehicle
It's a He heads for it
Then the  finds him again and the Chopper swings around
The gatling guns  the plants to pieces all around him
Xander hauls ass, heading for the truck
Bullets chew up the dirt all around him
As the helicopter passes overhead, it's guns
There is a  as the   goes up
-  erupts into the night air
Xander dives into a
He tumbles down into powdery cloud washes over him, dusting the trees white
Near him is a big  leeching sewage
Xander crawls inside
The Chopper makes another pass overhead
The big spotlight plays over the area, then moves on
Xander gives a sigh of relief
He crawls out of the drainpipe
race by on the road right above him as flood the compound
There's no going back
Xander turns and makes his way along the tree line
The chopper and gunfire are in the distance now
Things are quieter here and he starts to relax
Bad idea
As he goes by, one of the  moves
He takes a few more steps and the grass he just walked on reach out, tackling Xander from behind
Another  of    bursts from the weeds, the bushes, all perfectly camouflaged like the landscape
They fall on him like a curtain
'
- Soldiers hold him down while a is pulled over his head
- As the     we can see  taking off and landing
load Jefe and his Narcos onto a
Virg resists and is
can be seen being loaded into an
The hanger doors slide shut with a
We see Xander's  as the  are cut away
Xander sits in a chair with the   still over his head
He blinks when the hood is torn off
Black Ops Soldier smirks as he walks away
Xander looks around, sees the Black Ops Team unpacking some Two of them are dumping bottles of a into a
Nice of you to draw me a bath
Is it Saturday already
The Black Ops guys grin knowingly
On the other side, Xander sees a   readying a for travel
Gibbons steps up from behind him
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class
You're a cold piece of work
You almost got three people killed out there
Good thing you were there to save the day
Come walk with me
Xander gets up and Gibbons leads him on a stroll around the You've really got me confused, Cage
On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew
and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic
Help me out here
'm not following your evolution
You want the cheap backstory
The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes
Gimme a break
You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy
You're perceptive too
forgot to add that to the list of surprises
'm with the National Security Agency
And unlikely as it may sound,  need your help
'm not interested
've already got a job
You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary
You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger
plan on getting a lot older
And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead
That's too bad
thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge
As they walk by the Black Ops guys, Xander sees they're getting busy
One spreads out a plastic
Another plugs in a
What's this
You're gonna try to scare me now
Gibbons grabs a   from a guy eating lunch
Do you know the reason why  try to recruit guys like you
There's no risk
He tosses it into the tub
Instantly it starts to  and The tub is full of
There's nobody back home who's gonna ask questions if you just
disappear for a while
In seconds the entire leg has been consumed, leaving only a oily cloud of residue
Gibbons eyes him coldly, nailing the point home
Now 'm the one who's nauseous
So what's the deal
What do you need me for
There's some folks  want to keep tabs on
Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized
Your kind of people
What do  get out of it
If you find out what  want to know, and if 'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life
If not, you take a bath
You're one sick bastard
sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission
think no matter which way  go 'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic
So here's my answer: kiss my ass, Hop-along
Gibbons kicks the back of Xander's leg and dumps him on his ass
Gibbons was so quick, Xander never saw it coming
The Black Ops guys clap and cheer, always interested in a fight
Not bad for a gimp
What's with that "" on the back of your head
Does that mean you're "extreme"
've got some news for you, Mr
, you're a three time loser
So maybe you should tattoo another couple of 's on your head
Xander gets up
'll take that under advisement
Maybe  can be like you and lose a leg for the old Stars and Bars bet the flag's a great comfort every time you need help climbing stairs
Gibbons lunges and grabs Xander's throat in the vice-like grip of his thumb and middle finger
One twitch and my finger and thumb will meet inside your esophagus
Believe me, Mr
, 've put foot to ass for my country on many occasions and  don't feel the urge to stop just yet
So think carefully before you tell me: Is "kiss my ass, Hop- along" your final answer
The fingers are so powerful that Xander is paralysed
He looks over, sees the bone saw start revving
(choking) No
Gibbons releases his grip
thought you might see it my way
Then Xander starts walking away
Where you going,
said where you going
The Black Ops guys grab weapons, ready to stop him
You tell me
Xander climbs up the steps of the Gulfstream
There better be a movie on this Goddam flight
- Xander sits with Gibbons in big leather chairs
They are surrounded by   in suits
snaps an  around Xander's ankle
How about a pedicure as long as you're down there
What's this
Lo-Jack
Wherever you go on the planet, 'll find you
There's no quitting
If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground
Is all that clear
Yeah,  spy or  die
- Orange light floods this beautiful airline lounge
There's a fully stocked bar, a snack table, all unused
That's because it's been sealed off for  use
(: perfect product placement opportunity for an )
Xander, Gibbons and his Men are all silhouetted against the smoked glass windows
The Nerdy Agent hands Xander a Palm Pilot sized This is your communicator
You'll identify yourself by a call sign
From here on out you're Bulldog Omega 5
You must stay up late to come up with shit like that
expect you to call in regularly with progress reports
Fine, but 'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5
Gibbons checks his watch
They get up and start walking
- The phalanx of Agents surrounds Xander and Gibbons as they walk to the gate
The Nerdy Agent hurries to catch up
Uh
Call signs derive from the parameters of the mission
If he doesn't like it, we can make an exception just this once
We'll call him "Triple "
They walk past the gate, down the jet-way, the Agents to the
Up yours
Crude and defiant as always, Triple It fits so well because you're obscene
Xander is the last one to board the plane
Is that all
Just remember, 'll be watching
As the door closes, he looks back at Gibbons and his phalanx of Agents
've got something for you to chew on
Next time you send someone to save the world, make sure they like the planet the way it is
The jet's door
- Xander is in the last row against the bulkhead
He's got a personal  player and headphones and he's reviewing his mission
The high-tech screen shows photos, maps, cool graphics
The  sitting across the aisle leans over for a look
What game is that
Slick graphics, huh
See these dudes
They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses
Do they have any special powers
The bosses always have special powers
You wanna check it out
Come here
The kid moves to the seat next to Xander
Onscreen see photos of the    from the opening sequence
We   to the computer as Xander describes them
For each of the baddies, we'll see 3-  and  , all enhanced with   and -
First we've got Anders, the psycho looking biker
In charge of transportation and smuggling
Controls every trucking union in Eastern Europe
Don't look too clean, either
We see , the wild-eyed and unclean Swedish biker, against a backdrop of  and
Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor
Into snowmobiles and snowboarding
So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade
Naturally
We see Viktor, with the goatee and belly, doing some hairy snowboarding
This guy's kinda dorky lookin'
Kirill, the sniper
Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God"
Assassination and weapons
We see Kirill in  with his well used
Who's the hottie
He indicates Petra, the tough gangster chick
With her and  she looks like she could mop up the floor with Lara Croft
You like her, huh
Petra
She runs their finances, money laundering, computers
Joined the gang after spending some time as the girlfriend of this dude, Yorgi Azar Zimin
Capo of Anarchy 99
Finally we see , the unlikely looking Mafiya Don
We see    that illustrate his exploits
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans
Cops called it "blood week"
He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99
(skeptically) "Anarchy" 99"
What are you gonna do
They're Euro- trash
What weapons do you have
Xander clicks on ""
He scrolls through a staggering array of  and
Just about anything  want, it looks like
This is gonna be tough, though
There's no way to save this game gotta get it right the first time through
What do you get if you finish
Nothing, really
My guy is just doing it to stay alive
Oh
bet by the end he gets something out of it
Like what
He gets to be the hero
The Kid's mom calls him back to his seat
Xander looks at the kid, then gets back to his research
: - We   from the   as a - races by
We rise up, revealing  in all it's glory
-  - Xander sits in the back, wedged between If you were to call Central Casting and ask for a couple of cold war spy types, this is what they'd send
They're both 6' 4", have sloppily cut hair, square jaws, wrinkled overcoats
This is bullshit, man,  wanna see some
The two tough guys flash their  's
Xander studies them
" " and " "
You're both named Ivan
That's gotta be confusing on Valentine's Day
So where we headed
Fellas,  said where we headed
(beat) Yeah, whatever
He looks out the window, sees a
They drive right on by
- It's a crumbling old dump in a nasty part of town
Xander shakes his head
James Bond never had to put up with this shit
Ivan 1 pulls Xander's gear bag from the trunk and throws it on the sidewalk
Xander picks it up and carries it into the building
- Dumpy furniture, roaches, cracked windows
Xander is ushered in
There's another  in a   waiting
He is Sit down
've been on a plane for twelve hours, think 'll stand
Ivan 1 shoves him into a chair
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police
When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what  say
If you become any kind of an inconvenience, 'll shoot you
Here we go again
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government
This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with
will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn
Get whatever information your government seeks and get our
First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit
Two,  don't wanna be here either, so just step off
Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch
Now that we've got that sorted out, 'm gonna get some rest
Xander lays down on the bed
Slovo stares, burning with hatred
He heads to the door
Be ready in three hours
Slovo exits
Ivans 1 & 2 stay, staring at Xander
-  - fancy, flashy disco with an extreme sports theme
big bouncer in a leather coat works the door
This is a highclass, expensive joint but it still looks seedy and dangerous
Xander and Slovo walk up to the place
Xander's wearing a Tshirt that says " :  " complete with a photo of the Hedgehog
-  - that looks like a runway model  across the stage on  - while  cheer
The disco is a combination - and
All the are outfitted in ,  , - and
There's a    playing on a
On either side of the stage are two -  that the  are cutting back and forth on
sit in plush booths getting table dances while the dance floor is packed with sexily dressed Xander gets a beer from a    on - Nice hops
The corner
Anarchy 99
Slovo points them out in the far corner
They're surrounded by straight faced
What  99 is doing in their booth with the looks like Led Zeppelin on tour
Booze, broads, good times
These guys are living like rock stars
They're all here: Anders the biker, Viktor, Kirill
In the middle sit Yorgi and Petra
Petra's wearing an "  " Tshirt
See the one with the funny colored hair
Crazy bitch stabbed one of my men in the knee-cap
There they are, American
The low-rent millionaire criminals
And you thought only your country had white trash
American
He looks around but Xander is gone
He heads for the exit, pushing his way through the crowd
But then he spots him, not by the door but deeper in the club
Oh no
He sees Xander walk right up to the Anarchy 99 booth and start talking to them
Jesus Christ
Slovo can't hear a thing, but they're obviously interested in what he has to say
Next thing he knows Xander is pointing at him and waving him over
(horrified) What the hell
Slovo makes his way through the crowd to the booth
Yorgi looks him up and down
That's the guy
This pizda
Never seen him before
(to Slovo) Who you workin' for
What do you do for a living, dickhead
Uh
am
work in insurance
Xander grabs Slovo and starts searching him
(panicked whisper) What the hell are you doing
He slams Slovo up against the wall and pulls out Slovo's police badge
Look what we have here
Czech 5-0 on the mack
The Bodyguards pull out guns and Slovo rushes for the emergency exit in a panic
In seconds he's out and gone
Cops
Like a plague
No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out
How did you pick him out
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink
appreciate you bringing this to our attention
Whatever you want, the rest of the night, consider it on the house
Yorgi waves over some strippers
Thanks, but 'm here on business heard you're the  around here
'm looking for some cars, expensive ones
lot of them
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about
'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here
If you don't know about 'em, who does
Yorgi nods and the Bodyguards step in front of Xander
guess  heard wrong
Xander turns to leave
That's when Anders notices the "" tattoo on the back of Xander's head
He gets excited and alerts Yorgi
Xander Cage
Xander turns
Suddenly their whole demeanor changes
All five guys get up, awed, and push the Bodyguards out of the way
The  man
We seen your bootleg videos
You sick
You sick crazy on a board, on a bike
Everything
This is insane, man
Xander Cage in Prague
Come on, sit
Sit with us
Yorgi signals for more drinks
remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour
When else are you gonna do it
You almost died on that one
Cops arrested me while  was still in surgery
Did two months
We seen all your shit
So you want cars
We get whatever cars you need
What are you looking for
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's
high end pasta rockets
Ten to start
Ten
No problem
We do that no problem
Petra elbows Anders
Ten is hardly worth the effort
We're talking a lousy million five
have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after
And it's a mil two, max
Petra glances at Yorgi who nods
Do you know what a wire transfer is
Is she for real
Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation
My goodness, a word with four syllables
should get some ice before your brain gets too hot
Sure
Just chisel some off your heart
(smiles) So cute
He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife
Xander looks to Yorgi
(laughing) Don't look at me, , she handles all the details
It'll work faster if  have an account number
Petra scrawls numbers on a cocktail napkin
You'll have forty-eight hours to complete the transfer
Don't waste our time
Xander snatches the napkin
Wouldn't dream of it
'm even gonna throw in a few extra bucks to send you to charm school
Petra glares at him
Alright, now that business is finished, we party
Bitches, come
We have a drink and toast the deal
Yorgi claps and a flock of strippers descends on the booth
Anarchy 99 lifts their glasses
Xander joins in the toast
believe  can hang with you fellas for a while
-  - We see the  of   sprinting down the hallway
- Agent Polk looks around, spots Gibbons
He rushes to him, waving a
Gibbons grabs the communique, reads it
He looks up, stunned
- Xander is having coffee at his window when his communicator (into phone) guess you got my -mail
set up a purchase
Ten cars
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track
Don't make me question my own judgment,
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money
One point two million dollars
did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars
'm already on a first name basis with these dudes,  got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not
We're not after car thieves here
What the hell am  after
You're telling me dick
That information is classified
You're there to gather information on their operations, period
Call me crazy, but  thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side
What else
You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me
know, poison needles in my shins
You've got 36 hours
Peace, out
Xander hangs up
'  - Gibbons stands before Sam's desk
Sam scans over the communique
Ridiculous
Cut him off
'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time
think we should send him whatever he wants
You what
wire transfer of this size
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely
You're talking about a very expensive risk here
He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined
He got us an account number to boot
Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, say we back his play
(beat) put him out there, Sam
If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him
can't let that happen
Why not
You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you
Gibbons smiles
Alright, do what you want
But keep the screws on him
He's a wild card
That could be either good or bad
So the odds are up to fifty-fifty can deal with that
: -  - comes flying in, a  standing out on the strut
He's a disgruntled   from the
His name is Slovo and Xander watch from a distance as a series of is unloaded by
Slovo lets out a low whistle
Your government must know something we don't
Shavers walks up to them
Hate those Russkie choppers
Rattle- trap pieces of garbage
'm agent Shavers
Toby Lee Shavers
'm looking for what's his name
Three ' s
That's would be me
Shavers gives him a disapproving look
Figures
You got someplace we can spread out my gear or what
mean today
Slovo gestures towards the stairs and Shavers marches off, muttering to himself
'll leave you two alone to talk
Yeah, thanks a lot
-    - Down in the basement there is a   along one wall
squad of   is
They become distracted by the noise in the middle of the room
One of the metal boxes has been dropped by a Cop
The rest are spread out in front of Xander, Slovo and Shavers
Back off, just go away you klutz
Alright, here's the story
The items in these cases belong to me designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up
stole your beat, huh
Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people
Is that supposed to be funny
'm not laughing
've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy
And ar the last minute  get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt
Listen to you
Right away, sir, anything you say, sir
Shavers pops open the first metal case
Inside are various laid into the molded carbon fiber lining
What is all this
didn't even order some of this stuff
Shavers holds up a small
You're gonna need it, rookie, trust me
The metal ball unrolls into a six legged
An all-terrain mobile video monitoring system for surveillance
call it the "Roach Cam"
See the little camera it's got for a head
Xander picks it up
Kinda looks like you
Shavers snatches it back
He puts on a  , it's fingers are
"Terminator" climbing claws
He  the claw onto the metal case
It holds fast
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface
They come in any other styles or colors
He tosses the glove aside, pulls out a
This is your standard dart gun
That one 'm real familiar with
Shavers displays a case of
You've got your chromium knock-out dart, microphone listening dart, explosive dart, even one with a splatter blood packet, whatever you need
They also come in a special 9mm casing for use with your service pistol
Xander pulls out some
Multi-view binoculars
Nine different enhanced vision modes, plus a digital camera
Xander looks through them, starts cycling through the different modes
- we see the various modes as Xander scans the grounds
Infrared, starlight
Even a special "penetrator" mode to see through walls, curtains, almost anything
Xander aims at the shooting range
- we see through the clothes of the on the shooting range
(-13 style, of course)
We can even see the   of their
One of the Female Cops turns and gives Xander an approving look
think 'll hang on to these
Think again, that's government property
You have to sign for everything
've got one more that wasn't on your list
Shavers pulls out a
From the Beastie Boys collection
It's a stakeout suit
It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying
It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute
You're joking, right
Shavers just gives him a deadpan look
Now that 've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail
thought that was in detail
As Shavers drones on, Xander hangs his head
- The       are loaded on two Mafiya  keep watch
The Ivans (in Teamster garb) inspect the cars while Xander supervises
Anders hovers around him
So what you think
Beautiful
Sitting in an  watching are Yorgi, Kirill and Petra
Petra has a
Has it arrived yet
Petra checks her computer
she's monitoring their Nothing
He had two days
Perhaps he is not all he says he is
Outside the Ivans nod approval and Xander heads to the office
Yorgi looks to kirill, who puts his hand on his
Xander opens the door
Very nice
'm impressed
'm somewhat less so
We seem to have a bit of a problem
Just then Petra's computer  and the  floods into their account
Xander holds up a   and smiles
had to inspect the merchandise first
Of course
He nods for Kirill to stand down
- the two transport trucks are driven off by the Ivans
As they pull out they reveal   under a
What's this
This is a gift
From me to you
Anders pulls off the cover, revealing a cherry '72 It's a little nothing, you take it
Xander checks out his new ride
Yorgi gets in the passenger seat
Come on, get in
Xander sits behind the wheel and
The big engine You're alright, Yorgi
Next door to the warehouse sits an
Up on the sloped roof, Slovo spies down on the transaction
He's got a camera with a big zoom lens
Smile, bychara
Slovo snaps a few pictures but his view is obscured
To get a better vantage, he   onto a lower part of the roof
His foot
Down below, Kirill hears the noise
Yorgi
They all look to the abandoned building
Through the second floor window they can see Slovo's leg poking through the ceiling
Xander is taken aback
What in the hell
Yorgi turns to Xander, goes for his pistol
Thinking fast, Xander does the same
They draw simultaneously and hold the guns to each other's heads as they sit in the car
Petra, Kirill and Anders draw as well, all of them covering Xander
What's going on, my friend
You tell me
You got a sniper up there or what
He's not with us, Xander
He must be with you
(he cocks the hammer) Bullshit
You get your boy off that roof or  swear to God 'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of
Yorgi stares, finally believes him
He lowers his gun
Get him
Find out who he is
By now Slovo is down the fire escape
He hits the ground and goes running down the street
The Anarchy 99 crew heads for their cars
Xander  the cylinder on his
've got him
Buckle up
The  peels out
- Slovo is huffing and puffing as fast as he can when Xander comes skidding around the corner
He looks back and sees the speeding
That's the cop from the club
Xander does the only thing he can
He puts the car sideways and aims out the window as he slides to a stop
Slovo turns and
Xander  Slovo right in the chest
-: a spray of  erupts from his chest and Slovo falls backwards, his face frozen in a look of shock and betrayal
The smoking shell clatters to the ground
Slovo blinks up at Xander, gasping for words, then lays still
Xander hops out, rifles through Slovo's pockets
The other Anarchy 99 cars pull up, the whole group looking on
What are you doing
Get in the car
Xander heads back to the  and the cars peel out
-  - The rest of Anarchy 99 follows behind the
don't believe it
You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street
(grim) Had to do what  had to do
He pulls out the roll of
Yorgi laughs
You say you get a million, you get the million
Some cop gives us shit, he's dead
Jesus Christ, man, you're hard-core
- The Ivans pull up in their transport trucks
They see all the blood and rush towards Slovo
But something doesn't look right
Ivan 1  the blood and spits it out
1 It's sweet
Ivan 2 pulls a   from Slovo's chest
Slovo
- It's a crowded basement rave club
Hot and sweaty dance in provocative outfits
The Anarchy 99 group is standing on the best booth, right on the packed dance floor
Surrounding them are a handful of   who stand at attention like the Secret Service
Anders swings from a water pipe and then drops onto the table, smashing glass
tries to pull Petra onto the dance floor and she him
The Bodyguards drag the dude out for a proper thrashing
Yorgi shatters a  against the wall
Total chaos, man
Welcome to Anarchy 99
What's "Anarchy 99"
It's all this craziness
It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army
One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit
What for
He dies for what
Politics
Who's politics
Not ours
You wanna see my politics
Xander shows him a  on his arm
It shows with a giant  through it
Screw the world
If 'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money
That's what 'm talking about, man
That's why Anarchy 99 was born
Yorgi rolls up his sleeve, revealing an Anarchy 99 tat (a circled "" with "99" underneath)
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails
It's everybody does what he wants
People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue
There's an old punk song
It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free
" "
try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese"
'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals
You got it, man
It's stupid but it's true
True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want
That's when you know you're living, man
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere
Easy
You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss
Yorgi throws a fistful of money onto the dance floor
The Xed out ravers swat it around like confetti
You hang with us, buddy, taste some freedom
Petra
Dance with this guy
Yorgi melts into the dance floor crowd, leaving Xander alone with Petra
She gets up grumpily and starts dancing
Xander joins her, but she won't even look at him
This is great, dancing with the back of your head
She reluctantly turns around
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing
Yorgi asked me to
You do everything Yorgi says
Go to hell
It's gonna be like that, huh
You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else
Why's that
Mind your business
Did you guys used to date
That's it, right
He broke your heart and you're still soft on him
That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you
She glares at him and walks away
Xander follows
Where are you going
Why are you still hanging around
Your business is finished, you should go home
was invited
What's your story
don't know who you are or where you come from, but  don't like you
You ask too many questions
There's a big line outside the "ladies" and no line at the "men's"
Petra heads into the Men's Room
Some  whistles at her
She pushes him out of the way and enters a stall
Xander leans on the sink
Come on, don't front like that
You'll put a guy right off you
Don't even bother,  man, 'm not your type
That right
Why's that
The stall door flies open and Petra marches out
My chest is too small and my brain is too big
She shoves him to the door and stomps back to her stall
Xander walks back out, shaking his head and laughing
Across the room, Viktor shoves the
out of the way and puts on " " by the Vandals
The rave dance is interrupted by the pounding punk beat
Xander, check it out
The revolution begins
Viktor and Anders swiftly turn the dance floor into a violent mosh pit
Xander can't help it, he actually likes these guys
Let's get some air, man
Yorgi and Xander head outside
moment later, Kirill hurries out another door
- It's late
Yorgi and Xander stroll along the river
You got a great set-up here Yorgi
You really know how to live
It's a beautiful town, Prague
It's been good to me
've been here before, when  was a kid
My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg
You, an Army brat
don't see that one at all
Did you join the service as well
Hell no
My dad was a straight up tin soldier
Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged
Had a court martial and everything
The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere
My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him
So he swallowed a bullet
Me,  don't believe in nothing  can't see and touch
The camera suddenly  across the city, flying over streets and houses until, half a mile away, it finds Kirill in a window with his
- Xander's head is in the crosshairs
The scope pans over to Yorgi, who looks   and gives a small signal, calling off the hit
Yorgi looks up at a "  " banner
Next week these idiots are having a peace conference here
What the hell are they going to talk about
It's the system itself that causes all the world's problems
You're okay, buddy
Come on, it's getting early
They stroll off and Kirill stands down
- flotilla of  (Xander's  among them) drives through the gate in a massive, stone wall
It's a big manor house in the middle of town
-  -  - The , sedans, 's park in the courtyard
Xander sees a row of  parked here as well
Xander also sees a Guard hit a switch that  the Yorgi corrals a bunch of  he's brought home
This way, girls, let's go
He leads the whole troop inside
-  - As they go down the hall/Xander sees and
Diversified global operations
The sun never sets on our empire
Xander takes in  ,  ,
For all their screwing around, it's clear Anarchy 99 runs a large operation
-   - With leaded glass windows overlooking the river, this place is beautiful
Inside it's done up more like the house from 's "Real World", except trashed
There's cool fish tanks, a pool table, PS2 on a flatscreen and spray paint and holes all over the walls
welcome them with food and Yorgi's  gives him important messages
(sorting through messages) Not bad, yes
The original owners, they just one day decide to move out
Anders starts pounding on a drumset
Petra kicks a soccer ball at him
Yeb vas, z'opa
Shut up
Yorgi paws at a Stripper
've got meetings this afternoon, 've got to get some sleep
Just pick a girl
That's alright, 'm kinda tired
You want to insult me
This is my hospitality
Pick one
Xander points at one of the Strippers
She's wearing a fashionable
Good, now find a room to crash in
Petra, show him
The surly Petra opens a door, revealing a hall of doors
Xander and Flak Jacket follow
You gonna tuck us in
She just gives him a nasty look, walks into her room and slams the door
Xander scratches his head and picks a room
The others shuffle off to their beds with their Strippers
- '  - Flak Jacket is out of sight in the bathroom
Xander talks to her while he gets undressed
Listen, no offense, but 'm not in the market right now, okay
You can stay here, but let's not -- He trails off as she steps out of the bathroom
She's wearing just a -string and the flak jacket
You don't understand a word 'm saying, do you
She just smiles at him sweetly and pulls his shirt off
She looks at the   still pierced through his nipple and gives a puzzled look
Stupid, right
That's what  was trying to tell you
just got out of this heavy thing
She kisses him and lets the flak jacket fall (-13 style)
The things  have to do for my country
He gives in and starts making out with her
: -  - Xander sneaks out of his room and down the hail
Behind him, we can see Flak Jacket asleep amongst the tussled sheets
-   - Anders is snoring on the floor
Xander skirrs around him and goes through another door
-  - Xander finds an office and starts going through the desk
He finds a   and snaps a   to the bottom
In seconds he's copied everything on it
He moves on to some drawers
What are you doing
He turns, sees Petra standing in the doorway with a
Looking for a phone book
want to call a cab
Unless you wanna give me a ride
She shuts the door, advances, staring him down
Who are you
We hung out last night, remember
also remember you drove your car here
Who are you really
Make no mistake,  will shoot you and not feel bad about it
Who are you working for
Hey, take it easy
'm just a dude trying to make a buck
She  him, hard
Bullshit
see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions
know exactly what you're doing
Empty your pockets
You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid
She  him again and Xander goes for her gun
Before he can pry it from her hand, she's pulled another gun from nowhere and has it jammed against his neck
He lets go
Hey, you're good
Maybe we should start again, yes know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are
That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because  ain't buying your bullshit either
You're not like them,  can see it in your eyes
So you tell me, who's bullshitting who
'  - There are   asleep in bed
Yorgi is sitting at his  in his underwear
He's hacked in to the   network
Something bothers me about you, Mr
Xander Cage
He looks around a bit, doesn't find what he's looking for
He sits up, getting pissed
Get Kirill
Now
She heads out
Yorgi goes to the bathroom, splashes water on his face
Kirill enters, still half asleep
What's the problem
'm inside the police mainframe
Do you see anything
Kirill studies the screen while Yorgi pulls on clothes
What
've searched their -mail
No funeral announcement, no obituary, no call- to-arms
Nothing on the news, even
swear  saw a cop get shot yesterday
How come no one is talking about it
Kirill looks back at the screen
Nothing there
also check the wire transfer follow the money back to it's source, but there is no source
It comes from nowhere
First they bring , then British , now maybe they plumb the lower depths
Maybe now they send someone who looks like us
Maybe someone like our houseguest Mr
-  - Petra still has the gun on Xander
don't know what you're talking about
The eyes don't lie
All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra
You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun
Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore
Tell me if 'm wrong, Petra
Go to hell
Look at you
You're helping run things now
You're a gangster
bet that snuck up on you
You woke up one day and you were a criminal
She pulls back the hammer on her gun
It's cool,  feel you
might even be able to help
Here, let me show you something
You wanna see what's in my pocket, 'll show you
He makes a move and she jabs the gun at him
She reaches into the pocket for him and pulls out his little data recorder
What are you
'm an information gatherer
You wanna go somewhere and talk about it
-  - Yorgi creeps down the hall, Kirill in tow
They both screw onto their
They flatten themselves up against the wall and prepare to burst into Xander's room
One
Two
They kick in the door and aim their guns around
Flak Jacket sits up, terrified
Yorgi and Kirill lower their guns
Viktor stumbles by in his underwear
Where is he
They went to breakfast
- This is a beautiful and historic Prague location with and a nice view
It's rather fancy and  with Petra and Xander sit in the middle of the room, sticking out badly in their grungy clothes
takes their order
Perogies, potato pancakes, fried goose livers, the sausage plate and a pot of Turkish coffee
Xander shakes his head
'm just gonna have a garden salad
Oil and balsamic vinegar on the side
The Waiter takes off
Petra puffs on a cigarette, staring at Xander
That's how you eat
It's like a gerbil
(shrugs) 'm from
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for
They obviously have very deep pockets
Are you from a rival clan
Let's just say 'm freelancing and leave it at that
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing
You and Yorgi are practically twins
Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you
know where he's coming from
The only thing  really don't get is why he dumped you
Up until  found that out,  thought his judgment was pretty sound
Don't even start
'll be honest, don't trust you
Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that  want to leave
What can you do about it
The people  know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know
They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business
All  have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts
We could work together
Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here
There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it
beach named
That 'd like to see
So there you have it
guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out
She thinks on it
Then her cell phone
(into phone) Da
(
) (on phone) Listen very carefully, Petra
We think Cage may be an American agent, do you understand what 'm telling you
(into phone) Yes
(
) (on phone) Don't worry, 've got your back
'm right across the street, above the bakery
Just bring him outside and let me do the rest
Kirill hangs up
She looks back at Xander, shell shocked
What's up
Is there a problem
She studies his eyes, decides to risk it
They tell me you're an American agent
What are you talking about
There's no more time for games
They made you
There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye
Tell me if it's true
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less
Jesus Christ
You're going to have to go out the back
The data that you copied with your toy
Tomorrow, at six o'clock
Look it up
We're taking a trip
Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people
If  go out the back, he'll know you've warned me
That's alright, 'll figure something out
Not an option
Just get up slowly like everything's cool
Petra, trust me
You just hung yourself out to dry for me, 'm not gonna let you down
- Kirill lays on his stomach, peering into the scope of his Through scope - he can faintly see them inside the crowded restaurant
Xander and Petra are making their way towards the exit
Nice and easy, Petra
- They work their way through the lunchtime crowd
can't let this happen
want you to go out the back
'll make up some excuse
They'll kill you, you know they will
Besides, there is no back door
Keep smiling
Ready
Now
- Xander's timed it perfectly so that just as they get to the door, a  passes by
Kirill keeps focused, waiting for the bus to pass
- Xander's head is sporadically visible through the bus windows
Kirill's finger tightens on the trigger
As soon as the bus passes he
But Xander's not there, he's ducked down to tie his shoe
The glass door behind him shatters
Feigning surprise, Xander      and sprints down the block
He runs bent low, the parked cars protecting him from the sniper
Kirill fires anyway, taking out car windows
At the end of the block is a long staircase with a down the middle
As he runs by an outdoor restaurant Xander snatches the from a startled , sending food and drink flying
He hops on the serving tray like it's a skateboard and does a - down the length of the stairs
He's moving too fast for Kirill
He jumps off at the bottom and the tray Kirill  it like a clay pigeon
By now Xander is out of sight
Kirill pounds his rifle in frustration
Petra gets to the top of the stairs
She gives Kirill a "Where did he go
" look
Her nose is bloody, helping to sell her performance
Then she turns and looks off after Xander
She sees his speeding away
: - We're looking down at a  moving through the fjord, seen from high above
It's towing a   behind it
An airplane
No, we're at the top of the Trollveggen, Norway's legendary "Troll Wall"
It's a near 5,000 foot sheer drop to the ocean
Six figures stand at the edge of the barren cliff
They wear webbed "squirrel" jumpsuits, helmets and parachutes
On each thigh they have pistols and on their chests they have silenced -5 sub-machine guns
Together they stare down at the ship
Petra is among them
She looks down at her watch
It is precisely 5:59PM
She glances around
The top of the cliff is rocky and flat
Xander is nowhere to be seen
- we see Xander sneaking forward military style
He's got his "stakeout suit" on and is keeping low
: "6 " The members of Anarchy 99 put on their goggles and, without saying a word, they leap off the Troll Wall
Xander runs to the edge and looks down
He sees the group freefailing down the sheer cliff face
Very nice
The six plummet away from him at incredible speed
In a hard arch, they peak at 120 m
p
h
Then, using the webbed wings under their arms and between their legs, they go into aerodynamic "track" positions and rocket away from the wall
Like dark angels, they soar out over the water in formation
-- The ship below is a scientific research vessel
On the deck, a few  and  watch the sun set
The six dark figures close in rapidly
At the last moment they pull their chutes and deftly glide towards the ship
sailor looks up and spots them
Before he can shout, he's     and goes down
Seconds later, they're on the deck, tearing off their rigs
They race across the deck, taking over the ship in a surgical manner
They herd everyone back heading for the bridge
Petra hangs back
She looks back at the cliff, up towards Xander
'
Through his   we see them storming the bridge
As they head inside, they disappear from view
Xander hits a button on the side of the binoculars
Let's see what's going on inside
""
Now he can see
He sees  , herded into a room and   by Anarchy 99
- Anarchy 99 seals the door, locking the crew away
They slap five and bump chests, still totally amped up
- - a
It's white and twelve feet long
There are  on either side and a on the top of a periscope-like projection rising from the back
This is the
It sits in the   at the back of the ship, ready to be launched out the back sea doors
Ready the boat
There is a   moored to the back of the ship
Kirill and Viktor hop onto it's deck
They start to as they work
Sounds like the "Andy Griffith" theme
'
He takes   of the Ahab device
What the hell are you guys stealing
The smaller boat is launched and ready to do
Yorgi goes to the    and hits a switch
The aft doors open, letting water into the wet well
In seconds Ahab starts to float
Anders loosens it from it's moorings and they
Ready
Yorgi hits another switch, opening the   on the port side of the ship
Air flows out, causing the ship to list to one side
What are you doing
It all happened so fast
Such an unfortunate accident
Yorgi   the wet well control panel
Let's go
They climb onto the boat
Petra is the last to board
She looks up towards Xander and   the panel some more, making sure he notices
'
He sees the smaller boat pulling away, the Ahab device being towed behind
He pans over and   on the shot-up control panel
What the hell
He pans over to the wet well and sees it's flooding
With the ballast open on only one side, the ship starts The thing is going down
He pans over, clicks into "penetrator" mode, and sees the Crew pounding on the walls below decks
They're trapped, their      -
- Xander puts down the binoculars and gets up
No way, man, no way
'm just supposed to be an observer
Aw shit
This job sucks
He pats his jumpsuit, checking for the buckle
Toby Lee Shavers, if this thing don't work, your ass is kicked
Xander steels himself, takes a few deep breaths
Then he sprints to the edge and  off the cliff
And that's it
He's gone
One mile, straight down
Suddenly we're falling with him
We hear the rush of air as he free-falls a dozen feet from the craggy rock face
The force of the wind ripples his cheeks
He streamlines himself into a track position and jets away from the cliff like Superman
Before he gets too low, he
Immediately his jumpsuit     in , unfurling into a full sized
Xander looks up at his parasail, relieved, and glides towards the ship
- Petra spots the parasail and has to act quickly to keep Yorgi from spotting it
She grabs him suddenly and  him
What was that for
'd forgotten how exciting it is working together
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, thought you no longer cared
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline
(smiles) Viktor
Stay the course
Yorgi kisses her again and heads to the cabin below
- Xander comes in for a perfect landing
He lands on the listing deck and undoes his harness
He sees several  scattered on the deck
Son of a bitch
He looks across the water, sees the smaller boat far away
- Petra looks back one last time, catching sight of Xander on the deck of the ship
She smiles, relieved
Then she turns solemn as she heads below decks to pay the price
- Xander gets to the wet well and sees the water flooding in
With the ship listing like this, the water is pouring below decks
- Xander opens a hatch and lowers himself into the hold
Here is where the entire Crew has been left to drown
They are struggling to stay above water, their hands and feet bound
As the far end of the room is another
Water pours in from this one and Xander has to get it shut
He swims through the struggling Crew, spots the holding his   above water
The water is rising rapidly, filling up the compartment
Xander braces his feet against the bulkhead and , but the force of the water is too much
He surfaces
He's got to wait until the room floods before he can close that door
He watches as the Crew goes into a panic, the water rising up to the ceiling
They are gasping in the last foot of air that's available
He sees the Captain's Son, crying and clutching at his father
Xander takes a deep breath and dives down
He grabs the hatch door, braces his feet and
His muscles strain as the heavy metal door slowly swings Xander surfaces and swims to the ladder
He  the Captain's plastic cuffs
Is the boy alright
Yes
will cut the others loose, you must run the bilge pumps
The Captain takes the knife and swims to free his men
Xander takes the Captain's Son and climbs up the ladder
'  - Xander scans the controls but has no idea what he's looking for
The Captain's Son shows him the right switch
You sure
The Son nods and Xander flips the switch
start to - The bilge pumps spew out water furiously
Crew members come up from below decks
They are soaked and grateful
They go about tending to the wounded as Xander slumps down next to the exhausted Captain
Captain, huh
You get a lot of broads with that uniform
They both laugh, relieved, as the ship slowly rights itself
: - Xander is in a room with the  from the ship
They have blueprints of the torpedo spread out
The Captain's Son is wrapped in , shivering
Xander is talking to Gibbons on his communicator
(into communicator) They call it "Ahab", it's a solar powered submersible
It can circumnavigate the globe on it's own
They use it to track and study the migration patterns of whales
Gibbons jots down the information furiously
You did say "Ahab"
You're sure about that
Yeah,  sent you pictures
Here's what 'm thinking
If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing
You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac
This is good work, , damn fine work
You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab"
Hey, one miracle at a time
They're on to me now, remember
'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you
Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives
And
You done yourself proud helping those people today
Xander tussles the hair of the Captain's Son
Thanks
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that
Keep up the good work
You ain't seen nothing yet
: - The  screeches into the lot
Shavers is on his way out with his
Get in
We've got work to do
- - they're all laid out on the floor
50 cal
, , ,
We finally arrive at Xander leaning on his
He sparks a and lights a
want all that
(he pats the ) In there
Shavers looks on in shock
He's got a crew of  with him
Xander hands him the blowtorch and walks away
- This is a beautiful open air market in a town square surrounded by old buildings
The place is
In the midst of it all, we make out Petra moving through the crowd
She stops to look at some vegetables when Xander passes by her
Right behind you
They keep talking, pretending to shop
So what's the plan with this Ahab
Are they selling it or what
No, something worse
He says it's a surprise, but  know him
This is his masterpiece
We've got to find out what it is
Can you handle that
(beat) There's something  didn't have time to tell you before
What's that
'm a agent as well
've been undercover for over a year
You're what
What the hell have you been doing
don't know
Eight months ago stop hearing from my people
No explanation, just silence
So  stay and  wait like  was told
Soon 'm in so far, they'd kill me if  left
Now every day  get farther and farther away from what  was
'm like you said, a criminal
'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing
Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger
This stings her
She knows well the price she paid
No,  guess 've been no help at all to you
Get your head back in the game
There are lives at stake here
Of course
'll do what  can have to go, before they notice
When can  see you again
You can't, it's too risky
'm not much help anyway, remember
Then she's off into the crowd
- The craggy surface of the wall is swathed in shadows
Xander approaches and flattens himself against it
He's all in , packed with weapons and sporting a
He grabs a toehold on the wall and
He   up the side
He reaches the top in seconds and scopes out the manor house
,
It's not gonna be easy
Xander slips over the wall down to the courtyard below
-  - Xander places an  on a
He waits for a  to stroll by and then slips through a basement window
-   - Xander makes his way through a series of rooms
Finally he finds himself in a study with a window overlooking the of the Manor
Laid out below he can see the  , hanging from chains
are working with the Anarchy 99 crew to the thing
They are installing a   of
Xander can't hear a thing through the thick glass
He takes a   from his pocket
There's a sink in the corner and he drops the metal ball down the drain
We follow the metal ball as it rolls through the trap and down into the wall
The pipe zigzags around like a rollercoaster and then levels off
The ball rolls past a -intersection, stops, and unrolls like a pill bug
Six metal legs appear and we see it's the
It scuttles back up the pipe and makes the turn
-   - We're close on a sink as the Roach Cam comes up the pipe
It scurries into hiding just as a  reaches in to turn on the water
The roach peers out from between items on a workbench and we on it's   head
-  - -   -
We see a handheld video image of Viktor
Okay, fire one
Viktor pushes a button on Ahab and a   launches from tube one,  against the ceiling
Perfect
Pull back to reveal Xander watching the image on his communicator
Using a joystick he's able to control the roach
He steers the camera towards Petra, gets a low-angle shot of her legs in a punked-out
He smiles, enjoying himself
Great piece of hardware
He plugs his earpiece in and listens in
-   - Petra works on a
The roach scurries across the floor, circling to get a better look at Ahab
Anders pushes a  holding
Each canister is separated in two, with a   on top and a   on the bottom
He hands the canisters to Viktor one by one
(singing) "Silent Night
Holy Night" Viktor laughs and joins in
Then Kirill looks down and
He  it with his boot
-  - Xander jerks out his earpiece and rubs his ear
Damn
He looks down into the room, sees Kirill bending down to examine the roach
Time to go
-   - Kirill lifts the dead "roach" and sees its wires
There's some bullshit going on
Yorgi hits an  switch, alerting the guards
The Anarchy boys grab weapons and start racing through the house
-  - The Anarchy boys move swiftly from room to room in practiced close combat maneuvers
Cueing each other with hand signals, they run through each room, weapons ready
- Xander sprints down the hallway
With the Anarchy 99 boys and Guards roaming the house, he's having a hard time finding his way out
- He runs into a darkened dining hall, sprints across only to find the opposite door locked
He hides behind one of the many  as his pursuers enter the room
Kirill gives a thumbs up and puts on a pair of He scans the big room but sees nothing
Xander, hidden at the opposite end, waits breathlessly
Kirill advances slowly, his buddies covering him from the door
Xander, my friend, that can only be you
Why don't we put our weapons down for a few minutes and discuss this like friends
How would you like to come to work for us instead
We could Rage Against the Machine together
Across the room, Xander sees a small window leading to the courtyard
He has to run across open ground to reach it
He calls out to Yorgi
Speaking of people that are full of shit, funny you should mention those guys
Xander's voice echoes around the empty hall, making it impossible to pinpoint
They put their records out through Sony, one of the biggest corporate machines on the planet
Some revolutionaries, huh
He pulls out his gun as Kirill creeps ever closer
Against the far wall Xander spots a
Come on, you're the one who's fooling yourself
Why risk your life for your government when we can offer you a future that is truly free
Kirill is almost on top of him
Xander sights up and
The fire extinguisher , blinding Kirill
Xander makes a run for it
Everyone   (except for Petra), bullets tearing tapestries off the walls
Xander dives and crashes through the window
- Xander tuck and rolls, comes up running
Guards are running around, unsure just what the hell is going on
Xander hops on one of the   parked nearby and fires up the engine
He hits a remote switch and
The   he left earlier blows-up
He points the bike at a set of
They form a "ramp" that he can use to
He
Guard races across the wall with a rifle, taking aim
Xander races and    over the wail
As he goes by he does a - , before he can shoot
The Anarchy 99 guys run outside just in time to see him go
He blew the gate control
Anders
Get the bastard
Anders fires up the other trials bike, slings a submachine gun across his back and goes up and over
Petra watches him go, hoping for the best
- (: action will be re-choreographed based on actual locations
Any freestyle motorcycle moves will be motivated by a physical reason) Xander blazes down the street, Anders racing right behind him
wrong turn sends him into a dead end
At the end is a panel truck parked next to a stone wall
Xander slows the trials bike and drives it up the hood of the truck and onto it's roof
Balancing on the rear wheel, he hops onto the wall
The machine gun blasts again
Xander drives off along the top of the wall
Anders shoulders his gun and follows
They are riding a 15' high wall that's only a foot wide
They make several 90 degree turns, racing above a sleeping neighborhood
Xander sees the end of the wall ahead and takes a detour
He hops onto the second floor balcony of a - bolt out of the way as the motorcycle leaps into their building
Xander pops a wheelie and slams through a
Anders follows, demolishing their
Xander darts through the building, between beams and 2 x 4's, until he reaches a skeletal
More  appear at the bottom of the stairs so Xander goes up
He cranks up three flights of stairs and bashes onto the roof
- Xander looks around for a way out
The next building isn't that far away
He revs up and
Anders jams another magazine into his sub-machine gun and follows Xander
They jump from roof to roof, down a towards the river
Anders pulls up alongside as they race towards that last apartment building
Neck and neck they head for the brink
At the last jump, Xander pulls up behind Anders
They hit the last roof in a crunch of gravel
Anders clamps on the brakes and comes skidding to a stop, Xander right behind him
They skid to a stop at the very edge, with Anders balanced on his front wheel
He looks down, sees street five stories below
He glances back at Xander, sweat beading, struggling to keep his balance
Xander observes him coolly, totally in control
Anders reaches for his machine gun
Xander pops a wheelie and  Anders over the edge
The bike tumbles and  into the pavement
Anders tears through several  before slamming into the ground
Xander turns and rides to the next apartment building
He hops down a steep series of roofs that will eventually take him to street level
As he makes his way down, Anders stirs
The guy is a bloody, broken mess but he gets to his feet
He sees where Xander is headed and he scurries off to intercept him
- Xander is heading to the far end of a dead end alley
The only way out is fenced in
But there's a  leading up to a
Xander will have to use that ramp to jump the fence
Anders climbs to the second floor of the building
There is a small crane arm loaded with metal
If he pushes it at the right time, it will swing out and knock Xander from his bike
He giggles maniacally, blood dripping
Xander drops down into the alley and heads towards the jump
Anders times it perfectly and swings the crane arm out
: The bike leaves the ramp and soars up over the fence
The crane arm swings out, on a collision course with Xander
Xander sees it and     , grabbing onto the back in a  -
He passes the swinging crane arm
Anders's face falls when he sees Xander go by, hanging on with
In his   Xander's got his
Xander pulls himself back onto the bike and lands
He stops, sees Anders'   come bouncing into the alley
He tucks his pistol away and roars off
- Xander comes up the stairs and sees   in his apartment
He draws his gun and pushes the door open
Slovo
Slovo is sitting in the armchair
Dude, what are you doing here
You killed me, remember
Now  have to hide out here with you
Where have you been
Xander holsters his gun, searches around for his communicator
found something big enough for us to take these guys down with
They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash
Is this what you're looking for
Xander turns to see Slovo waving the communicator
Yeah, give it here
Slovo raises his pistol
Sorry, "dude"
(stunned beat) What's the deal
Oh come on, don't feel bad
You got played, so what
You're new at this
Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out
Why you dogging me up
(shrugs) They came and found me
They said they'd kill me unless  help them
Plus they offer me a lot of money
No big deal
These things happen
Dump your gun on the floor
Xander does so
Where do you want it
The head to be quick
Or the chest for an open casket
Suddenly  blasts through the closed door
Bullets shatter a , a , and finally tag Slovo in a wild salvo
Slovo crumples, never knowing what hit him
The door creaks open
It's Petra, her gun still smoking
She's with the Ivans
Are you alright
What the hell are you doing
You could've killed me
(shrugs) heard you talking
could tell where you were in the room
don't know what's going on anymore
thought  was square with that dude
Now everybody's switching sides like it's the
The Ivans go to Slovo's body, kicking the gun from his hands
One of them  on his corpse in disgust
What are you doing with the Ivans
know which cops are good and which are bad
Come with me
Come on, right now
She drags him to the door
- The beautiful and historic St
Charles bridge spans the river
There are  hanging in celebration of the coming Petra leads Xander across it
Where are we going
We're getting out of this place
We've done enough
Wait a minute, whoa
We can't go now
What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it
Of course it matters
Hey, hold on
What do we owe our governments
Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that
No, now it's about us
Let's do something for us before we both get killed
Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander
We can't leave now
We have to do something
Why
You're the one who believes in nothing
Screw the world, or whatever you said
Xander grabs her by shoulders
Alright, so  was full of shit thought believing in things was wrong
Turns out believing in nothing is worse
You might as well be dead
'm not thrilled with the world, but 'm not gonna let those idiots start killing people
Come on, you're a cop, we've got to get these guys
He's gotten through to her
She nods in agreement
They left
To a fortress in the mountains
We'll have to go after them
Aren't you afraid
long time ago  learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head
Maybe that's my problem
If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine
must be healthy, then, because 'm scared to death
guess 'd better get back to Yorgi
You don't have to do that
Yes,  do
You're right
can't just let him go free
Besides,  can help you from the inside
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been
(shrugs) was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop
They'll believe me
(beat) 've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us
Take a vacation
What the hell are we doing
We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet
Xander kisses her
That gives us something to live for
Together they walk back across the bridge
We crane up, revealing the    banners all over a big on the river
- We see a craggy, gnarly mountain
The front side is a rock strewn, near vertical drop
Then we see Xander come scaling up from the back side
He's got  strapped to his back and it looks like it's been a helluva climb
Xander sits at the very peak and catches his breath
It's beautiful up here
He pulls a   off his back, hits a switch and the thing   to full size
He clamps it on his feet
Xander moves to the edge and peers down
At the bottom of the mountain he can see the , an imposing medieval fortress in the snow
He leans over the edge and starts down the mountain
He doesn't get far before he notices something else
He slides to a stop on the near vertical face, clinging to rocks for balance
On the mountain below him, between him and the castle, is a Right now he's in full view and he's been spotted
He sees  scrambling out, hopping on From up here they look like ants
- Viktor, the goateed cold weather warrior, strides out of the Outpost and looks up the mountain
He shouts orders to his men
Guard runs up and brings him his weapon:  -
Viktor straps it on and
climbs onto his
All around him the Guards are driving into position
They form a gauntlet of -47's
There must be a  of them
Viktor rides up twenty yards and waits, his engine idling
Hold positions
He squints up at the speck that is Xander
- Xander pulls a   from his jacket
Nothing like fresh powder
He puts his goggles on and pulls the pin from the grenade
Then he
The grenade lands in the snow above him and starts Xander pushes off and starts bombing down the mountain
The grenade bounces after him and then
It goes up with a tremendous shock
There is a  in the snow, a  of shifting weight, then the   cracks loose and topples over the brink
Xander streaks down the mountain with that wall of snow at his heels
From down below it's an awesome sight
The slack-jawed Guards watch as tons of churning snow bear down on them
Shooting in and out of that powdery mass like a surfer, they can see Xander skipping like a stone down the mountain face
There's a mad scramble as Guards turn their snowmobiles and ride for their lives
furious Viktor spins around and makes a run for it as well
Nobody has a chance
The avalanche is coming like a freight train, frothing like white water
Xander blazes right through the scrambling Guards and hits a He goes soaring up and lands square on the sloped roof of the Outpost
The avalanche is right behind him, slamming down everything and everyone in its way
Guards are swallowed up and tossed, snowmobiles go tumbling under the onslaught
Xander grabs onto the chimney as the avalanche washes over the Outpost
He holds on until the ocean of snow comes to a stop
Then it's all quiet
Above him the slope is a battlefield of icy rubble
There's nothing moving up there anymore
Xander pulls himself free
Then he hears a gushing sound and a    , he sees the
It's Viktor and his flame thrower
There's another  and the glow fades for good
Xander boards to a rock and sits to catch his breath
He's right above the Castle now
Then his communicator starts to (into communicator) Gibbons, long time no talk
You wouldn't believe my day
What the hell has been going on, Triple
How about a status report
Xander looks down on the Castle
There seem to be all over the grounds
Snow covered fortress
Army of bad guys
The usual
'm on the way with a team to relieve you
What's the latest
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher
They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate
Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about
Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you
Yes it does
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent
The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated
The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud
When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with
Yeah, that's right
So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back
Kinda funny, though, isn't it
We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway
Guess we shoulda played by the rules
Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me
You've done your job, , head back to Prague
'll be landing in 90 minutes
This is my operation now
We don't have that kinda time, boss, don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer
've gotta go now
've got a lot of bad guys to kill
Xander hangs up and heads down the hill
- patrols the rocky grounds outside the castle
He stops for a smoke when Xander walks right up to him
With two quick blows he knocks him out and keeps walking
He's a man on a mission
He runs in a low crouch to the smooth castle wall
There's no hand-holds, it's, a perfectly flat climb
canyon of is below
Xander reaches into his jacket and pulls out the "" He pulls on the metal gloves and  into the solid rock
Just like that he starts scaling the vertical surface
We see him outlined against the mountains, steadily making this impossible climb
At the top is an overhang
It's a gnarly transition
As he's rounding it, his
His legs dangle over the rocky chasm below
Using all his strength, he pulls himself up the rest of the way with his climbing claws
At the top a  leans over, aiming his gun at him
Xander grabs him and pulls him over the edge
The Guard  into the chasm
Xander rolls onto the parapet, exhausted
Then another rushes him, grabbing for his rifle
Xander springs, the claws lashing out, and tears the gun from his hands
With the other hand he , taking the Guard down
He pulls off the claws and heads into the Guard Tower
-  - Xander exits the Guard Tower at the ground level
As he crosses the courtyard an  rocks the tower he just left
There is shouting as  race around the parapets, unsure where the attack is coming from
runs up to Xander
(in Russian) What's going on
Xander  him and catches his -47 as he drops
Up inside the castle he can see Yorgi at a window
Yorgi appears mildly shocked as they make
Xander takes aim
From up above, Kirill has Xander in his sights
The bullet hits Xander's , sending it spinning
Xander rubs his sore hand but stays put
Kirill could have killed him and he knows it
From a doorway comes Yorgi with some Guards
Yorgi walks up and  Xander in the face
That was for Anders
Don't forget goatee boy
greased him up on the diamond run
Yorgi punches him again
-   - Petra sits at a desk working on a
Yorgi enters with Xander and Kirill
Look who we found playing outside
Petra looks up
She can barely hide her shock
Petra, my sweet dove, do you notice anything strange about
He looks slightly less than dead
Kirill aims his gun at Petra
Yorgi,  thought he was -- Yorgi  her
Do you think  didn't know about you all along
My contacts in the told me you were coming
You show up undercover and,  must admit, you play your part to the hilt
When it's time to be cruel, you are cruel
When it's time to be passionate, you are very very passionate indeed
Petra is devastated by this revelation
could have killed you, but  thought this would be so much more fun
To twist you and use you how  see fit
And to be honest, you went much farther than  ever expected you would for your country
He runs this fingers through her hair and moves on to Xander
And you
Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend
Did you miss us that much
wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls
Not bad, man, not bad
You put things together quick
Prague it is
The Peace conference
Nice place to start, don't you think
What's the gimmick, Yorgi
That's the part  don't get
You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs
didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche
You think 'm after money
told you, my friend
Anarchy
Time for a change
Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world
Easier than that, buddy
'll get them to destroy each other
You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay
Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour
London, Cairo, Beijing
Pretty soon everyone's involved
These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys
Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days
No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want
Including rape, pillage, murder
Sure, if that's what you want
Why not
It's all human nature
So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it
And here  thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt
Come on, Xander
You used to stand for something
What happened to you, man
thought you'd get it
Don't you see,
For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three
He's a regular humanitarian
And all this time  thought he was just a tool
You both could have been a part of it
You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of -- Oh just shoot us already
'm sorry asked
Yorgi's eye twitches
Screw you too, buddy
He raises his gun and suddenly
massive explosion rocks the whole castle
Shrapnel shatters the windows, spraying glass, and Yorgi's shot goes wide
- The front gates have just been blown apart
Through the smoke and wreckage come Ivans 1 & 2 with a Their submachine guns rattle in threeshot bursts, sweeping Guards from the parapets
-   - Kirill looks down at the carnage below
Xander takes advantage of the distraction and charges at Yorgi
Yorgi goes to shoot but his hand won't work
There's a sticking through his forearm
By the time he pulls it out, Xander is on top of him
He body checks Yorgi, sending him flying over a desk
Kirill spins and starts
Xander ducks for cover
- The Czech Secret Police are having their way
They cross the courtyard and burst into the main building
-   - The Police whip through the building like lightening, mowing down everyone in their path
One Czech Secret Policeman is wounded and the others retaliate with a volley of 's that evaporates a pocket of resistance
In the main room upstairs, Kirill is blasting away
Yorgi starts rounding up the computer gear
Hurry up, kill him
Before Kirill can do so, Cops burst into the room, spraying bullets everywhere
Xander and Petra are pinned down, but Yorgi and Kirill manage to make a fast exit out another door
Hey
We're on your side
The Cops keep shooting
-  - Ivan 1 is talking on the radio when Yorgi appears behind him and shoots him in the back
They step over him and enter a
-  - The Ahab device is in the back of a flatbed
Yorgi and Kirill start up the truck and jam it into gear
-  - The truck smashes through the garage doors and rumbles across the courtyard
Police open fire, but the truck tears out the gate and starts heading down the mountain
-   - Meanwhile, Xander and Petra are still pinned down
Petra
Tell them something
Petra starts calling out in
Finally the cops stop shooting
-  - Xander and Petra are brought outside
They see the Police working on the wounded Ivan 1
Ivan 2 walks up
How's Ivan
2 He is okay
Thanks for coming, man, you guys were right on time
2 We are always on time
Two have escaped, in truck
Yorgi and Kirill
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them
2 Yes
Your friend, the angry one, he send something for you
- big truck pulls to a stop
Its ramp lowers and Xander's blown-out '72  comes rolling out
2 We'll be right behind you
Xander and Petra both strap on grenades and pistols
Did you do your homework
(nods) If they launch it,  know how to bring it back
Let's do this
They both climb in and the  peels out
- Xander drives all out, trying hard to catch up
He passes several of Ivan's Police Jeeps at a furious clip
Up ahead they see the truck winding it's way down the mountain
Where's he headed
He owns a big industrial complex on the river
He'll launch it from there
Xander floors it
Up ahead, in the flatbed truck, Yorgi drives
He can see the gaining on them
(in Russian, subtitled) They're coming
Get back there
Kirill loads his sniper rifle and climbs out of the cab
He lays down, resting the rifle on the Ahab container
As the  comes into view, he sights up and ,
The first shot goes clean through the windshield and blows the headrest off Xander's seat
You get down
'll take care of this fool
He pulls out an Mp-5 out and hangs it out the window
No
Don't shoot
He's hiding behind the nerve agent
Another shot blasts through, taking off the rear-view mirror
Goddamit
He's gonna stop playing around soon and shoot something valuable
Kirill laughs and takes aim once again
He puts Petra in the sights
Xander jerks the steering wheel and
the shot goes wide
The  veers onto a dirt road that cuts down the mountain
Xander fights for control as they slide around the turns
The road flattens out and they can see the Industrial Complex up ahead
They cut across a field, heading right for it
- The truck heads through the gates of the industrial complex
Quickly the gates are closed again
Armed  can be seen up above
The  comes at the gates at full speed
Let's see what my man put together
Xander opens a  , revealing a
He flips one
The  , revealing a -
The mini-guns spin
The metal doors are getting
Empty  spill down the sides of the
The metal doors come apart, falling in chunks
The  slams through the wreckage without slowing down
Guard comes tumbling down and  off the trunk as the zips inside
- The Anarchy 99 guys seem to have a whole other army in here
Guards spill onto the road, shooting at them from everywhere
on the  opens and ping-pong ball sized dump onto the road
The bombs send the Guards scattering
The  sizzles away
Where'd the damn truck go
Go to the water, it's that way
tactical (a pick-up with a
50 cal machine gun attached) pulls up behind them and opens fire
Toadies right behind
Let me
Petra punches another button
The   pop off
They roll along the road on their own
Inside they seem to be
As the Tactical pulls up in between the hubcaps they ,   at both sides of the Tactical
All four wheels   and the Tactical goes out of control
It crashes through a fence and pitches into the water, the men going sprawling
Fantastic options
At the riverbank Yorgi and Kirill pull Ahab off the truck and prepare for launching
They remove it from it's box and carry it waist deep into the water
Yorgi opens a panel and works feverishly on Ahab's insides
've got it, go
Cover me
Kirill grabs his sniper rifle and heads off
He climbs up to a second story window of a wooden building on a
From here he can shoot and
He takes his   and tucks it behind his ear
When the  rounds the corner he
The bullet goes through the window and  into the steering column
Xander jams it into reverse
They retreat behind a building
Petra clutches her arm, wounded
You okay
piece of shrapnel hit me
'm sick of that guy
Let's stop playing nice
Kirill chambers another bullet and waits for them to make their second approach
The  comes roaring out, spinning in circles wildly
Xander's is just doing donuts as fast as he can
Kirill aims, but with all the dust being kicked up he doesn't have much of a target
What are you doing
He doesn't notice Petra pop up from behind a fence with a - the missile launcher's
The green display shows a faint red glow in the upstairs window
Its the   of Kirill's lit cigarette
The Launcher  as it locks in and she
Kirill looks up to see the missile blazing down the wharf at him
He gets it immediately
In a panic he fumbles for the cigarette
Too late
The missile zeroes in on his head
The entire wooden shack blows apart
Xander walks up to Petra
guess the surgeon general was right
- Ahab as Yorgi flips a switch and let's it go
The electric motor purrs to life and Ahab zips out into the river
Xander and Petra run to the water's edge in time to see Yorgi escaping in a
In the opposite direction they see the ripples of Ahab as it speeds towards it's destination
Petra finds the  in the cab of the truck
She presses buttons desperately
He's shut out the communication circuit
You can't talk to it
No, it's like a safety
We are going to have to access the manual controls
manual control on a moving torpedo
This day keeps getting better and better
Xander starts running towards a second moored
Radio Ivan
Tell him what's going down
Have them evacuate downtown
- Yorgi is motoring away, smiling, when he glances back and sees Xander and Petra take off after Ahab
He pounds on his steering wheel and turns around
His bigger boat closes on them and he reloads his weapons
Xander drives while Petra checks her controller
It's running three meters down
Twenty knots
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right
By then it's too late
The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water
The chemicals will break down and dissipate
Use your grenades
Maybe we can blow it up underwater
They're heading into downtown Prague now, the riverbank getting more and more populated
Yorgi is closing fast
Down below them Petra can see the white streak of Ahab beneath the water
There it is
Hold it steady
Petra pulls the pin on a grenade
She tosses it out in front of Ahab
jet of water goes up, but too far behind
She pulls another pin and is ready to throw when Yorgi's boat pulls up alongside
Yorgi aims and  and the bullet Petra's arm
Petra
She loses her grip and the grenade bounces down into the engine compartment
Xander grabs Petra and jumps
Together they land in Yorgi's boat
The grenade explodes and their boat slams into a bridge support and shatters
They are in the heart of the old city now
We see piazza's full of tourists, markets packed with locals, children playing in front of cathedrals
And on the river Yorgi and Xander battle it out while Petra steers the boat
Xander
It's coming up
Xander glances down, sees Ahab nearing the surface
Yorgi clobbers him and Xander falls to the edge of the boat
Petra tries to help, but Yorgi slugs her in her wounded arm
Xander can see Ahab just a few inches under as Yorgi grabs him from behind in a chokehold
This is going to be exciting, buddy
Front row seats to the apocalypse
Come on, sing with me
(singing madly) " am an Antichrist /  am an anarchist /
wan-na be
Anarchy
" Xander elbow's Yorgi's gut and breaks the chokehold
He flips him and they both topple overboard
They land on Ahab and both grab on
They punch and pummel each other while desperately hanging on to the speeding torpedo
It surfaces as it approaches the magnificent St
Charles bridge
On the bridge is a chaos of ,  and They are desperately trying to herd people away from the river
Xander pounds Yorgi's face and dunks him underwater
Yorgi slips and falls back to the tail section, dragging along in the torpedo's wake
Ahab starts making noise and it's payload doors swing open
Inside Xander can see the row of glass cannister containing Silent Night
The first one rises up into
No you don't
He pries the first rocket off it's launcher
The thing is menacingly
- - Xander blinks at the liquid death in his hands
He looks over at Petra
She's shouting at him, but he doesn't hear a thing but his own
He looks the other direction, to the mass of  on the bridge above him
Total strangers
The fate of the whole world is in the hands of a former nihilist
Through the crowd, Xander sees Gibbons break through with his squad of Agents
Gibbons and Xander make eye contact
Then Yorgi lunges onto his back, trying to pull him into the water
Xander   on the control panel and Ahab starts to
- With Yorgi hanging on his back, Xander turns the rocket upside down and stuffs it
Ahab heads down to the bottom of the river, the two men fighting
We see one man get  , the other is caught up on Ahab and continues downstream
Then the booster rocket , giving off  and
It's all in silhouette now as
The rocket , setting off a
Ahab and it's unfortunate passenger are  by the
The chemicals   in harmless clouds
- blasts into the sky
The crowd recoils
- Ivan 2 helps Petra off the motorboat
They look down at the water, but there's no sign of Xander
Gibbons and his men push through the cordon of , scanning the water
Nothing
Tears well in Petra's eyes
Even Gibbons looks dejected
Then Petra let's out a gasp and they look downstream
There's a boat ramp leading into the water
At first they see a ripple, then the top of a   emerges
The whole crowd looks on as Xander rises from the water, walking up the boat ramp
His shirt is tattered, his tattooed body battered
But there's a look on his face, a calm, a self-confidence we haven't seen before
The Phoenix has risen
Petra runs down to him and throws her arms around him
Xander shakes Ivan 2's hand and then turns to Gibbons
Thought you bought the farm down there,
Glad as hell to see you
'm pretty happy to see me too
So are you done with me yet
You've kept up your end of the bargain, 'll do the same
But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent
But  hate cops, remember
Except for her
Cut the crap, ,  saw you down there
You're a hero
Don't be afraid to join the good guys
Who says you're the good guys
He starts walking off with Petra
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside
Oh yeah
Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle
The poison needles
On come on,
Did you really think we were that barbaric
No needles, huh
What about the acid bath
All for show
Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing
(smiles) You're a jerk-off, you know that
Gibbons waves
We'll be talking soon, you'll see
You'll be back
Xander and Petra move off through the crowd arm in arm
can't believe my mission is finally over
don't even know what to do with myself
You can't welch on me now
We had a deal
: - a big "" spelled out in  on the sand
The camera shoots up into the sky, showing a perfect white beach, a perfect lagoon, a lush green island
Then we hear the  of a
: ""       '
- His ink done, Xander walks out onto the back deck
- Craggy mountain peaks and perfect turquoise blue water
Xander steps out of a hut built over the water
We see Petra sprawled out on the deck in a bikini
She's got a bucket of   chilling down
It's a vision of heaven
He lays down next to her, starts pulling her bikini bottom off
(laughing) What are you doing
It's about your next mission
You need to be debriefed
- we see the two of them dive into the lagoon nude
There's too many bubbles to see any real skin, but we know what they're up to
Back on the surface we see  rising and catch glimpses of their outlines beneath the water
The Camera pulls back to the deck, where we see Xander's on the table next to the beers
We hear them surface and start  off camera
Then the damn communicator starts to
