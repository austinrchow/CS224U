Father 'Neal watches from the side
Why one child is born into a good home and another into poverty - that is but part of God's design
All of you are unwanted, put here because of the sins of your unwedded mothers

The guards move down the mezzanine; one jokes, the other laughs
They disappear around a corner
The Man in Black hangs from the girder with one hand; with the other he yanks the piece of window off his foot-mounted suction cups
He drops to the mezzanine
He rests the glass against the wall
He peers over the balustrade at the party below
Satisfied, he removes his hood,
This is
hard, self-reliant, crafty man
You should treat him as such or be very sorry you ever met him
It is unfortunate that a man of Templar's various talents can be so lacking
How
His journey has been through a tough world and he has come fast
This one gives no quarter
Ever
Though his outward self glows with life, he is dead inside
Templar, focused utterly, steals inside a corridor

Templar kneels, lifting an edge of the rug
Revealing  -
Templar produces a  (the size of a flare gun, silenced, with a spool of steel cable attached to the top)
He aims down the corridor and fires
explodes from the barrel, spooling out the cable, and imbeds above the door at corridor's end
Templar yanks the other end of cable from the spool
He looks around for something to secure it
Sorry about this
He ties the cable around Myaki's bronze neck
He hangs from the cable, testing it
It will hold
He pulls out an aluminum contraption with small wheels and two handle grips
It's   for the cable
He attaches the glider to the cable, grips the handles, and glides the length of the corridor
- Templar bumps up against the door
He pulls his knees up and over the handles of the glider, then flops over backwards, hanging upside down

Templar pulls out a
It's a really small, really powerful computer and its job is to run through every possible number combination in about a minute and a half
Templar wires the computer to the lock with two needlelike He activates the system
The little computer starts running through combinations of numbers
He waits, hanging upside down
Meanwhile-- -  - The Japanese guards are smoking by the elevator, joking, laughing
One of these guys is a riot
The elevator opens
The   comes out, tray in hand
Compliments of Mr
Myaki
(delighted) Ahh
Beaming, they each take a glass
They clink and drink
- The computer
It's finished
Templar turns the door handle; pushes open the door
He pulls himself up
Hangs from his hands again
He swings his legs back and forth, getting momentum up
He releases from the glider and lunges inside

And here, where the painting was, is
Templar unshoulders his backpack
He pulls out a 40-pound  & industrial diamond-tipped drill, as big as a jackhammer
No finesse here, people
No, there's no time for high-tech
He's going to drill right through the bitch, right through four inches of tungsten steel
He starts setting up the drill
- Two   lie shattered on the floor, and next to that mess lie the  , now unconscious
The champagne server's gone

Ilya stops just outside the interior corridor
With the ' , he shuts off the anti-theft mats and moves around the corner into the corridor
- Ilya stops short
His eyes spark
He sees Templar's cable and glider
- Templar, wearing goggles, leans into the drill as    into the tungsten lock
This is a violent exercise
spit out like shrapnel
He's through the lock in seconds
Templar heaves the drill aside; it lands with a  on the beautiful mahogany table

Slowly
Templar faces Ilya
Ilya has a silenced handgun
On your knees
(Templar sinks to his knees) Give me the box
Slowly
Templar pulls out the box
Tosses it to Ilya
Ilya raises the handgun at Templar's head
Smiles
Try something: throw an extension cord on the ground
guarantee it will land coiled in several places
Ilya happens to be standing inside one of the coils of the drill's extension cord
And this is not lost on Templar
Templar, on his knees, grabs the cord and yanks it; the coil tightens around Ilya's ankles
His legs fly from under him and he goes down, the gun clattering across the floor
Ilya tries to get to his feet
Templar floors him with a right cross
Templar grabs the box and his backpack and sprints across the room
Ilya gains his feet and grabs his gun; sprints after Templar
- Templar runs to the balustrade and climbs atop it
He jumps, clutching the ceiling girder above
He's going out the way he came in
Suddenly '  are around his ankles
Templar falls
He's going 12 stories to his death
No
His fingers clutch the outside of the balustrade
Templar dangles there, looking up at the sadistic face of Ilya
And suddenly below -- - --   , looking up, pointing at the man dangling from the balustrade above,
And now everybody looks up
Sound the alarm
Call the police
- Ilya and Templar
Ilya calmly compresses his foot against Templar's left knuckles
The box please
Templar, grimacing, reaches with his right hand and pulls the box from his pocket
Hands it slowly to Ilya, who reaches over the balustrade for it
stuffs the box in his teeth and grabs Ilya's hand, jerking him over the balustrade
Ilya falls 12 stories to his death
No he doesn't
He falls one story and miraculously catches the balustrade there Templar clambers up again, atop the balustrade
He jumps to the ceiling girder
Hand over hand, swinging like an acrobat, Templar's across the girder in seconds
He releases from the girder to the window frame
There's one further problem
Ricocheting all around him
Fired by -- , one floor down
Templar reaches over his shoulder
Pulls a  from his backpack

He pulls out his black hood and drapes it over the taught cable
He grabs both ends of the hood
And he jumps
/ Templar flies through space, across the cable, the hood acting as a makeshift glider
He lands on the roof of the adjacent building
Templar looks around
He runs across rooftops, disappearing into the St
Petersburg night

Women screaming, everybody running around
Ilya comes through the panicked crowd
Ten

He went out the window
Five policemen go for the elevators
Five more exit quickly
Ilya follows

Ilya curses silently
And peels away from the cops and commotion, off into the night

The plane is in flight
, young, perky, comes down the aisle pushing a magazine/newspaper cart
Newspaper sir
sits there, dressed as usual without much heed to fashion
Note this, reader: Templar is not a super-spy, super-hero, or super-rake
He is a thief
He's examining several antique Russian  and
He looks up at the stewardess
(Cockney) Wow, are those gorgeous or what
You have an eye for beauty
Of course - you see it every time you look in the mirror
She blushes, fidgets, as his eyes bore in on her
Why thank-you, Mr
(reads seat assignment) Templar
She continues down the aisle, smiling to herself
Templar resumes with his lockets
747 - The plane has landed

Goodbye, goodbye, enjoy your stay in London, etc
Templar moves past the Stewardess, carrying  -

Yemen
You're bloody joking
(shrugs) Call the embassy MacDuff whips the passport at Templar
Templar calmly moves his head; the passport flies by
Hits the wall
Shut it
MacDuff leans down, coming in close
Templar doesn't blink
His expression never changes
You pass through Russia for a day with that gear and, what a surprise, a prototype computer chip worth quarter of a billion quid is nicked from the Myaki Corporation the night you arrive
We know you didn't fence it in Russia
Where is it
The door opens
Teal enters, tossing several -  on the table before MacDuff
Two are of Templar's bags, two are of his body
(Cockney) All negative
He didn't swallow it
An embarrassing pause
You've got three options: charge me, or release me
What's the third
You can kiss my ass
dreadful pause
MacDuff smiles
He turns away, then turns back and viciously backhands Templar across the face; Templar's head jerks
The blow would knock most men out
Now Templar smiles
Like a serpant
And says calmly: 'm a busy man
Make up your mind
MacDuff stares at Templar, gritting his teeth
Templar rises
Begins collecting his things

How you got your job

Another round please
Ye're tryin' ta get me drunk, aren't you
Are you cute or what
gotta freshen up
(she rises) Where's the loo in 'ere
Back there
Leave your locket
'll polish it for you
She smiles crookedly; hands over the locket
Are you a dearheart or what
She blows Templar a kiss and lurches off to the bathroom
Templar watches her a moment
When she's gone he puts the locket on the table
He pries open the back of it with a pen-knife
-   - there is a compartment in which sits -
Templar plucks out the chip and drops it into an envelope
- as she returns to the table
She sits down
Looks around
Templar's gone
The locket's gone
The waitress appears
Maam, where's the gent who was sitting 'ere
He left, luv
Said you'd take care of the bill
She hands the Stewardess the bill
She stares at it

She sinks down, confused, blinking, near tears

Oh, and Harry

Very good sir
, a young Bellman, takes Ternplar's bags
Templar doesn't let go
An uncomfortable pause
Jimmy, Mr
Templar carries his own bags
Templar steps past Jimmy into the elevator
What's with the bags, gov'nuh
They're all he ever brings
The man's bills are paid by a bank in Switzerland and his mailing address is a corporation in Lisbon
Bloody strange
Mr
Templar, strange
No sir, he's just shy

He's waiting for something
The first digit, "4," vanishes
"5" appears in it's place
Now fifty-seven million

Templar recradles the receiver; He stares at it a moment and  : -  - Templar enters the lobby wearing a fresh suit under a black leather trench coat
He goes to the desk, where concierge Harry Winston looks up
Harry, 'm going for a walk over Blackfriars Bridge
Midnight
Pause
And Harry, just perceptibly, nods
And returns to his obsequious self
Very good, sir
Templar walks off through the lobby
Jimmy (Jimmy walks over) It's about time  taught you how to run the front desk
: - '   - Fog
The bridge lights cast everything in a sickly yellow glow
Below, plows the river, horn
The lights of Southwark twinkle beyond
Templar enters from Victoria Embankment
emerge from the fog
Templar approaches
One is a huge dim-wit with greasy hair, as tall and wide as a bookcase
His name, aptly, is
The other is middle-aged and strongly built
high forehead; clipped, irongrey hair; square jaw and aquiline nose; deep-set, ruthless, unblinking eyes
This is
To characterize him as the John Gotti of Russia is to demean him
He is vastly more powerful
Interesting
(sizes up Templar) You are not a big man
But men like you never are
It is my pleasure, Simon Templar
My name is
know who you are
Tell me what you want, or  keep walking
Suppose  don't want anything
Suppose  want to kill you
Suppose there's a high-powered rifle trained at your head
As Tretiak's eyes dart about, Templar raises his hand, waving, signaling to someone below the bridge -- - -- that someone is   , in a cloth cap and rain mack now, and yes, he has a 30
6 scoped rifle trained at Tretiak's head
Tretiak's jaw muscles twitch
He smiles thinly
Rumour has not lied about you, Mr
Templar
Last night something was stolen in St
Petersburg
My city
You talk about the place as if you own it
(sinisterly) do, Mr
Templar
May  ask who hired you
You can ask
won't answer
What you stole  wanted very badly

Ilya emerges from the shadows
Locks eyes with Templar
The thief from the Nikko
What is the saying - if you can't beat them, why not join them
An American phrase, no
Or are you British
Australian
'm nothing
Except bored
Get to the point
(smiles) Of course
An American scientist has worked ten years to develop a certain technology
am informed that the technology will be made public at the annual nuclear science symposium in Washington would like the plans and specifications for this technology
Before the symposium
What are we talking about
nuclear fusion generator
We have a man on the inside
Why can't he steal it
He's tried
The scientist trusts no one and keeps no hard records of the technology in the lab
Nuclear fusion
They say it's mankind's only hope after all the oil's gone
This guy's actually done it
She
Come again
She, Mr
Templar
The scientist is a woman
(hands over a dossier) Her dossier
All the information you will need
My fee is fifteen million
dollars, half up front, half when deliver
You'll hear from me
Templar turns and walks off
Templar, one question
Templar stops
Turns
ask you to steal a person's entire life's work
You have no reaction
Are you that cold
Templar stares back, expressionless
He turns and disappears into the fog
No, rumor hasn't lied about you, Templar

No chemicals, no preservatives

Satisfied, she looks at Templar

She puts it in her cart and wheels off and  : -   - Jillian is examining apples
There is a
It persists
Finally she looks over at -- He's standing in front of the watermelons
He's thumping one with his thumb
He notices Jillian
Hello again
These aren't ripe
How are the apples
Excellent
They're in season
Templar walks over to the apples
Picks one up
Studies it for a moment
wonder why He didn't want us to eat these
pause
She looks at him, puzzled
Who

In the Garden of Eden
Oh right
Sorry, little slow today
Bad headache
(looks at the apple) Uhm, actually,  don't know
Why wasn't it: "No bananas
" Or: "Avoid, at all cost, kumquats
" Wonder what God had against apples
She gives him a funny look and turns away
Sorry
Can't help you
How about William Tell
You really think he shot one of these off his brother's head with an arrow
Jillian turns around again
pause
Do  know you
Unlikely
just moved to New York
She stares at him
This is a very strange man
Intriguing yes, but also possibly a lunatic
She decides to take the dismissive route: Well uhhm, sir, to answer your apple questions, one,  don't know what God's problem was
Two, William Tell, like Paul Bunyon, never existed
And in case you're wondering, Isaac Newton discovered gravity through planetary observation not because one of those fell on his head, and  seriously doubt that eating one a day will keep the doctor away
(beat) Okay
She wheels her cart off
Says over her shoulder: By the way - welcome to the Big Apple
Templar watches her wheel off
His eyes glint
This is going to be interesting

Jillian sees something through the windshield
She turns down the volume and squints -- '  - sits on the road shoulder
As we pass the Rolls, we see standing next to it wearing a hopeless expression
- looks at the Rolls in the rear-view mirror
She frowns
Just keep driving
Jillian frowns again
Against her better judgment, she pulls over
Throws it in reverse
-    - Jillian's station wagon backs up to the Rolls Royce on the road shoulder
Jillian gets out
Hello
She walks up to him
Together they look down at
It's flat, a pancake
Where's the spare
well
'm not really certain
You do know how to change a tire
Sorry
(beat) 'm not very
mechanical
Jillian rolls her eyes
Give me your keys
Templar hands them over
They walk to the rear
Jillian opens the trunk
They both look down at --
'  -    is also flat
(sheepish) Sorry
Jillian rolls her eyes again
All right, where do you live
Close
It's your lucky day
(begins to walk off) Come on
Templar watches her walk off
He smiles grimly
: '  - The car winds through Westchester roads
(v
o
, cassette) Research has centered on a machine called a tokamak, developed in Russia, essentially a doughnut shaped tube that contains the gases to be fused
At this, Templar stares at the tape cassette
(v
o
, cassette) The tokamak hasn't worked because the two gases must be heated to a temperature of hundreds of millions of degrees, and kept together for several seconds
Try room temperature, idiot
The Tokamak's got it all backwards
Uhhm
Excuse me
Who is that
Him
powerful, well-respected man who doesn't know a goddarnn thing what he's talking about
If  got one tenth of his funding
Jillian reaches down and yanks off the cassette player
She looks out the window, grumbling
They drive on
It's the next left
First driveway on the right
-  ' Jillian's station wagon pulls into the circle of the largest mansion in Westchester County
Just stupendous
' Jillian stares, open-mouthed, at the mansion
You live here
(turns to him) Are you for real
He picks up Jillian's lemonade bottle
Like the label says
No chemicals, no preservatives
(points at the house) You work for this or inherit it
My father made shoes
inherited the company
Now  make shoes
(looks at the house) That's a helluva lot of shoes
Uhm listen, 'm not very good at this and  realize we just met, but 'm even-tempered, politically moderate, belong to no religious cults, have no children  know of, am free of communicable diseases, happen to find you attractive
Wait a minute, hold on
Are you asking me out on a date
Yes
How do you know 'm not married
believe the fourth finger on your left hand is
(quickly) Okay so 'm not married
could have a boyfriend
'd be surprised if you didn't have several
Be surprised
Lemme give you a hand
Jillian pops the wagon's back hatch and gets out
Templar follows
They walk to the wagon's rear
What about you
There's no wife stashed on some island someplace
No wife stashed on some island
They pick up Templar's groceries; each takes two bags
No mistress
'mon
No bimbo on the side
Not a one
They walk toward the mansion
Well, that's a start
Here's the deal with me:  am not particularly even-tempered, 'm staunchly liberal, belong to no religious cults but  do believe in God as a basic force of good, have no children because one has to have sex to do that and, well, let's not pursue that, am free of communicable diseases, see above, and you're an attractive man, if a little weird, and well
hell, why not
(smiles) You've got a date, shoemaker
What's your name
Michael
Michael Quinn
They reach the mansion's front veranda
They set the groceries on a wicker couch
'm Jillian St
Thomas
They shake hands
Jillian fishes for a pen
'll give you my number
Just say it
have a good memory
(looks at him) Eight seven seven, five two nine eight
Good
Great
'll call you
've heard that before
will call you
You saved me today
Thanks again
She walks off to her car
Templar turns toward the front door
Jillian suddenly stops
Turns
Hey
(Templar turns) What's my number
(without hesitation) Eight seven seven, five two nine eight
smiles and continues toward the car, mumbling: And he has a brain
What do you know
'   -  watches Jillian get in her wagon and drive off
Then Templar keys open the door and enters
- The place is empty
Totally
No furniture
Nothing
Just Templar's two -  on the floor in front of Templar
: -   - It's late now
About 10 p
m
Templar sits on a packing crate in the vacant living room with a glass of scotch, studying Jillian's life
There are pages of personal data and many photographs: Jillian in cap and gown; Jillian in a lab coat; Jillian at the beach, etc
: , with Templar's handwritten note: - stares into the screen of his mini-computer
It is two hours later
-  -  - Templar has entered every detail of Jillian's life
Looks like this: Home state: Massachusetts Hometown: Milton Highschool: Milton Academy Highschool mascot: Bulldogs University: Harvard University mascot: Crimson It just goes on and on: names of parents, family members, teachers, pets, boyfriends; favorite movies, colors, sports teams, hobbies, etc
: finishes entering the details of Jillian's life
He copies it onto a 3 1/4 disk, pulls out the disk and shuts off the minicomputer
He leans down and picks up a
Opens it
He lifts out a ' and jerks the heel, which lifts away from the sole on hinges
revealing a hidden compartment, in which Templar places a small transistor
He clicks the heel shut
-- : , now on Jillian's foot and   -- - -- Jillian and Templar at a corner table in Le Cirque
The meal is over
They're drinking coffee, laughing, at ease
The "date" is going well
am not eccentric
No
You live in the biggest house in America but do your own shopping, you talk to strange women about the history of apples, and you give a first-time date
shoes
Isn't the tradition flowers
You said you liked them
do
'm joking
They're beautiful
Thank-you
They smile at each other
brings more coffee
There's a sudden commotion
Jillian and Templar look -- - a group of  are clapping their hands for a seated at a table
(to the waiter) What happened
(smiles) He just asked her to marry him
Anything else
looks at the radiant young couple
Smiles
Just the check please
(the waiter exits; Jillian looks at him) You didn't answer my question
Maybe it made you uncomfortable
Maybe  should just shut up
No, it's all right
Okay: "Why Jillian never got married, chapter One:"  don't know where you're from
Canada
don't know what it's like there, but here, if a teenage girl doesn't want to be a cheerleader, or drink 'till she pukes every weekend, or talk endlessly on the phone every night about absolutely nothing, then she doesn't win many popularity contests, know what  mean
That pretty much took care of highschool

Can  ask a personal question
(she nods) What's your
(laughs) That's personal
My
Let's just say it's high
Very high
Yes, very high
As high as yours
You don't honestly mean that
Oh, you're a smart one, shoemaker
It's in the eyes
can always tell
They stare at each other
Neither averts eyes
just don't often get the opportunity
It feels nice
For me, too
(and he means this:) You're very pretty
Stop it
Flattery will get you
someplace
don't know where yet
She smiles
The waiter arrives with the check; gives it to Templar
Jillian picks up her purse and takes her wallet out
Templar sees her doing this
No no no, absolutely not
Put that away
It's not for us
It's for the couple over there
(points at the couple across the room) Waiter, put their bill on my card please
Maam
Are you sure
Jillian nods
The waiter takes Jillian's card, exits
Jillian smiles at Templar
[Due to his mean origins and evolution, Templar has witnessed approximately three charitable acts in his whole life, and this was the third
] Thus does Simon Templar smile uneasily back
: - '  - Neat, modest, non-descript
Jillian and Templar enter
Jillian walks across the living room into a bar alcove off the living room

No, but there's a liquor store five minutes away
She grabs her coat, heads for the door
Wait
Don't be ridiculous
She stops
Looks at him

(pause) Michael,  haven't had anybody over in
a long time
And happen to like you
want to do this right
Okay
(he smiles; nods) 'll be back in ten minutes
(points at fireplace) Build a fire
She winks at him and exits
Templar walks to the window and stands there, waiting
We hear Jillian's car start, see the headlights
You're making this too easy, dear
He pulls from his pocket a  , flips it open, turns it on
On a miniature computer screen is a detailed map of
Two locations are pulsing: 1) Jillian's house and 2) a moving object, transmitted from a homing device, which we now see '   - -- it's in '  as she stamps on the brake at a stoplight and waits and we   to the house

His eyes widen
Here we find -- '

Walks over to it

Because only you have the code
He unpockets the 3 1/4 disk containing the data from Jillian's life and pushes it into the disk drive
He types a command; a new screen appears: Press any key to begin Templar hits a key and the old screen reappears: *******     ******* : ______________________ But now, in the space next to "Retrieval Code," Templar's data appears

Templar's system suddenly stops
It has run through every word

frowns
He yanks the system disk from the disk drive
He begins pacing
Okay, think
Think
Templar suddenly gets an idea
He sits and types: "Tokamak
"   Templar stares at the screen in frustration
He looks at the  ; the pulsing light is getting really close
Templar concentrates with every brain cell
We can feel him think
He's remembering something
We're in Jillian's car again, when they first met
Try room temperature, idiot
The Tokamak's got it all backwards
Templar grabs a pencil and notepad and spells out: Under this he spells it backwards:
He turns to the computer and types: "" And instantly this flashes: Open sesame
The retrieval begins:   appears on the screen: Submitted by: Templar scrolls through the document; we see a dizzying display of graphs, tables, plans, specifications, etc
Templar pulls out the disk containing Jillian's data and shoves a fresh disk into the disk drive
He begins copying Jillian's research from harddrive to disk
He looks at the
Christ, she's almost back
and indeed -- ' -- Jillian's car comes wheeling into the driveway

Templar grabs the copied disk from the disk drive and rips the slip of paper from the notepad
He flicks off the computer and sprints across the lab, then up the stairs
' Jillian reaches for the doorknob and enters -- ' She comes in

He smiles: That was quick
She walks past him to the bar alcove
Now Mr
Michael Quinn, let's have that scotch
Hey, what happened to the fire
thought we'd create our own
(smiles) Down boy
He gets up; goes to the fireplace; grabs some logs and lays them across the andirons and we -- : , now gently burning
Cole Porter is playing
past Jillian's shoes on the carpet, past the Oban Scotch on the coffee table, now half empty, to -- -- the couch, where Jillian and Templar are locked in a heavy kiss
Jillian stops
Whoah whoah whoah, time to put on the brakes
Those lips oughtta be licensed buddy
Sorry
wasn't trying to
know you weren't but if we keep going 'm gonna be the one who gets us both in trouble
Whew
(fans herself) Haven't felt like that for awhile
(she brushes a lock of hair from his eyes) Am  going to see you again
pause
Perhaps, just perhaps, for the first time in his black life Templar's having a hard time lying
Michael
(smiles at her) How about breakfast
It's a date
'll walk you out, shoemaker

Good-night
'Bye
Drive safe
Templar walks off to his Rolls Royce parked in the driveway

Tretiak's guards surround him; they move quickly up the mansion's marble steps, dodging the thrown debris
Four large police vans roar up, the back doors flinging open

Tretiak looks at Zubov's

Again we see: Submitted by: (confused) Cold fusion
Yes
Fusion at room temperature
Regarded as an impossibility by the scientific community

Zubov begins scrolling through the document; again we see the displav of graphs
tables
plans
Specs
etc
She first proves why hot fusion - the tokamak - is impractical
You must heat the hydrogen gases so high, more energy is wasted than created
Here she goes into the benefits of cold fusion
(scrolls more pages) The hydrogen isotopes needed
(scrolls more pages) The physical plant
She even estimates its cost
Extraordinary
(scrolls more pages) The next pages are the critical part, what no one in fifty years has discovered
(looks up at Tretiak) The combination of chemicals in which atoms will fuse at room temperature
Tretiak leans toward the screen, waiting
Well
Let's see
Tretiak -  think from reading this that the woman's done it
She may have found a source of unlimited energy
What do you mean may have
Show me
said there was a problem
Zubov hits the "scroll" key

: - Four hours later
Jillian sits, head bowed, unconscious
Yuri sits opposite
He is nodding off
If only Jillian could wake up
The  shouts back
We're over Helsinki
Yuri wakes, sits upright
Yawns
'   - Remy's peering out the window
Sees something
Simon, there
Two miles ahead,    roars past, heading east toward St
Petersburg
Remy jerks the stick, banking into a right turn behind the Russian jet
Remy looks at his
They're descending
Remy looks at Templar; Templar nods back
Remy pushes the stick; the Lear jet begins descending
- Jillian sits, still unconscious
Or is she
'   - Through the tiniest slit of eye, so as not to appear conscious, Jillian looks at Yuri, then at   shelved above the emergency exit
-  stands up and stretches
He goes to the window and looks out

Remy, his headset on, turns to Templar
The St
Petersburg tower wants us to circle
No
Follow them down
What do we do when we land
Haven't figured that out yet
- The aircraft is tilted forward in descent
The  shouts back to Yuri: (Russian, subtitled) Prepare for landing
The Pilot shuts the cockpit door
Suddenly '  are open; her hands are free and she's throwing off the blanket and gripping the wheels
She pushes; the wheelchair bursts forward
gets to his feet; the wheelchair slams against his shins
Jillian the detached armrest across Yuri's head
Yuri falls backward, dazed
Jillian rolls to the emergency door, one hand yanking open the door, the other grabbing a  from the shelf
Wind howls through the cabin
Jillian gets the parachute on
Her ankles are still bound to the footrests
To hell with it, she'll lose the wheelchair in mid-air
She pushes forward as -- --  lunges across the floor, grabbing the wheels teeter on the edge of emergency door exit, half in, half out
Yuri clings to the chair wheels
His body jerks forward
He's sliding on his stomach
Jillian and the chair are pulling him out
Terror in Yuri's eyes
He grabs for the door frame
His fingers slip
Jillian, the wheelchair, and Yuri hanging from the wheelchair, plunge from the aircraft
'    - Templar's bagging his computer and homing device
suddenly clutches his arm
Simon
Templar looks up
'  /'   -      fall from the aircraft
The pilot, looking down at Jillian and Yuri, clicks on his short-wave radio: We have a problem
- freefalls in the wheelchair, her ankles still bound to the chair's footrests

He tries to pull himself up

Yuri can't take the "" force; his hands rip away from the chair
He plummets, , and 3000 feet later he will hit concrete in St
Petersburg
Jillian pulls out the footrest pins (the footrests separate from the chair in the same manner), freeing her ankles
The chair releases, falling away
'   - Templar turns to the cockpit storage hatches behind him
He yanks open one designated:
Don't
fly out of the hatch
They flap around the cockpit
Templar looks askance at Remy
Remy
get ten grand for them in Paris
Maybe a Russian would pay more
Templar grabs a   and races to the back of the plane
He the
Cold air blasts his face
Put down in Helsinki and wait for my call
And Templar jumps and -- : - An autumn day in Peter the Great's city
Peaceful
Normal
Pedestrians walk the streets
[note: St
Petersburg is called "Venice of the North" because it's built atop marshy islands connected by canals
There are over 400 bridges; on the canals, boat traffic is often as dense as automobile traffic
] , glancing up, notices something
(Russian) Look
(points skyward) Look
Other pedestrians stop
They, too, look up at -- (Jillian of course) descending into the heart of the city
And down she comes, landing hard in the middle of an intersection and  swerve aside, nearly killing her
Others  to a stop

She looks around at -- staring at her
Help me

Police

radio and gets out
He approaches Jillian
- Across the Neva River from Jillian is a city park with a
Under the statue, two    are playing chess, smoking pipes, arguing, etc
Down  comes
The parachute snags on the  '
Templar dangles 15 feet off the ground
He looks at the  directly below
Hello there
Sorry about this
He shrugs off the parachute pack and falls, landing on the chess board, scuttling the pieces
The Geezers fall backward on their behinds
Templar gets to his feet, gaining his bearings, looking for Jillian
He takes off running
,  -  - Jillian sits in the back seat, catching her breath
The Young Cop looks at her in the rear-view mirror
Do you speak English
Yes
Some
Thank God
(takes a deep breath, composes herself) 'm an American scientist
Last night, in New York, a man stole something from me, then this morning  was kidnapped by my lab assistant, god this sounds like a bad novel
Suddenly a  bounces off the windshield
What was that
- The police cruiser moves past carrying placards and banners
They begin pelting the cruiser with rocks and bottles
- The cruiser clears the Romanov supporters
Rocks and bottles smash on the back windshield
There could be revolution maybe
City very dangerous
-     pull into the street, blocking it
The Young Russian Cop brakes; the cruiser comes to a stop in front of the other cruisers
An   , followed by a , approach the young cop's cruiser
-  - sprints across the Neva River Bridge connecting the Peter and Paul Park with downtown St
Petersburg
He suddenly stops short, seeing -- '   - --  in the cruiser, the Older Cop and the plainclothesman approaching
-  - The Older Cop leans in the window
(Russian) Is this her
(Russian) Yes sir Sergeant Ravik
The plainclothesman emerges from behind the Older Cop
In one shocking, effortless motion, he places a silenced handgun to the Young Cop's head and squeezes the trigger
Blood spatters the windshield
gasps in horror at the plainclothesman
It is
The Older Cop opens the door, shoving the Young Cop's corpse to the passenger side
Ilya gets in back next to Jillian, pressing the  into her ribs
The cruiser  off into St
Petersburg traffic
- looks around
He sees    filled with
Runs to it
Chooses a big, powerful, Honda street machine
He pulls out his burglar's tools; jams one in the ignition
He has it running in seconds
He throws it in gear and  off
-  - Templar blasts through traffic on the Honda
He's on a street parallel to Jillian's
Templar looks to his right, where he can see, one block over on the parallel street -- moving through traffic
Templar guns the motorcycle
The engine
He races ahead, accelerating through the gears
-  throws the cycle into a skidding, hair-raising turn
He's going 'round the block to cut off the sedan
- The police cruiser moves through the intersection
Suddenly ' , Templar-less, veers into the path of the cruiser
The cruiser hits it head on
The motorcycle rides up the cruiser's hood and smashes through the front windshield
The cruiser careens out of control
It fishtails twice and crashes into
- , the Older Cop is unconscious; he's taken the full brunt of the motorcycle through the windshield
, Ilya is groggy, semi-conscious
is reeling also; there's a gash on her forehead
The    jerks open
lunges inside
Ilya raises his gun but he's weak, disoriented
Templar yanks it from his hand and pistol whips him
This has all happened so fast
Jillian looks at Ilya then at Templar
What
And Templar yanks Jillian out
-  - The intersection is chaos:  running up, surrounding the police cruiser, vehicles stopping, etc
Templar, virtually dragging Jillian, plows through the crowd, passing a Russian Army Corporal who's just gotten out of his
(Russian) Let me help
(Russian) (pointing back at the police sedan) Help them
The Corporal runs to the smashed cruiser, and -- and  run to the Corporal's
- The driver's side door opens
In comes Jillian, then Templar
Templar shoves Jillian across the front seat and gets in, behind the wheel
He floors it
They accelerate into traffic
Templar looks at Jillian
She's trembling, staring catatonically straight ahead
Who are you
Tell me who you are and what the hell is going on
was hired to steal your research, but you know that by now
You left the critical data off the disk
Where is it
memorized, right
(she doesn't answer) That's a bad cut
Here
He hands her his
She swats it away
Look, you're in big trouble
The guy who hired me will do anything to get your research
Once he has it, you're a corpse
Give me the missing data and 'll get you out of here
You can trust me
She stares at him in disbelief
Trust you
(chews the word) Trust you
She grabs the door handle and yanks it open
Templar grabs her arm, pulling her back
They wrestle back and forth
Damn it, don't be stupid
She picks up the '    , sitting in a holder on the console between them, and throws it in Templar's face
Templar recoils, blinded, releasing Jillian
He jerks the steering wheel to the side and stomps on the brakes
lunges out before the supply truck fully stops
She hits the pavement running
She hurries off, blending into the crowded sidewalk
- Templar gets out, cursing, wiping the hot liquid from his eyes
He looks around
Runs off in Jillian's direction, abandoning the supply truck
: - Templar, running, out of breath, rounds a corner onto Lomonosova Avenue, in the city's shopping district
It's jammed with , , , etc
Templar moves through the crowd, eyes scanning left and right
There's no sign of Jillian
Then he sees her
Just a glimpse
50 yards ahead
Moving through the crowded sidewalk toward the  (the largest and most beautiful of the city's grand canals)
-    - Templar runs over the Fontanka Canal Bridge
Nothing
He comes back the other way
Nothing
He stops in the middle of the bridge, exhausted, out of breath
Below him, passing under the bridge, all types of   (skiffs, barges, dinghies, etc) are navigating the canal
And emerging from underneath the bridge, seated in the back of a ,
is Jillian
Templar races off the bridge
-   - Templar sprints down the sidewalk promenade next to the canal
The water taxi is 50 yards past the bridge
sees him coming
closes the gap
30 yards
20 yards
Now 10
Now he's running alongside the taxi, staring at Jillian
And she stares back at him, stony, expressionless
The canal is wider now, and the water taxi accelerates, pulling away from the slower skiffs
Templar slows to a jog
He stops, lungs heaving
The sun is setting to the west
The water taxi speeds off into the setting sun, leaving Templar with this image of Jillian: eyes unblinking, staring at him with pure, unadulterated hatred
: -   - Night is falling
Down the street from Tretiak's headquarters, rolls up to a traffic light
- has arrived in St
Petersburg
She sits at the wheel in a Federal Express uniform
She pulls out a charge of -4 plastique with a timer
She opens the van door; tosses it into a sidewalk
She accelerates through the light, now green, and takes a left into ' , parking behind a  which has just entered
The limousine's doors open
Several dark-suited men get out
One of them is (the Russian mafia figure shown on the
broadcast)
'  - is spread out on Tretiak's desk
Tretiak, Ilya, Zubov, and ten men are present
There could be another solution
The woman is not-the only scientist working in this field
Is she
Tretiak turns to Zubov, who nods
No
There are others
Get on a plane
Leave tonight
The door opens
Zero, the huge bodyguard, enters
Gracha is here
Tretiak goes immediately to his desk, pressing the ""  on a v
c
r
within
The surveillance camera in Tretiak's office begins taping the meeting
and six bodyguards enter
This had better be important
It's my wife's birthday
My apologies to your wife
An apology from Tretiak
An historic moment
(placating) Come now, Ivan, why must we feud
We feud because we hate each other
It is true there have been harsh words between us
We are rivals
But rivalry is bad for business
Upon what conditions would you accept a partnership
Be reasonable
Fifty percent of the drug trade in St
Petersburg and Moscow
third of prostitution and gambling
Agreed
(they shake hands) need the men in your areas, Ivan, for two days
Particularly Moscow and points South
Why
Tretiak hands   to Gracha
One is of , taken somewhere in Westchester, wearing her "atomic" jacket
The second is an Interpol photo taken of  in a cafe in Amsterdam
To find this woman
and kill this man
(smiles) This is a private matter,  take it
(Tretiak smiles) Then you'll have them
Ilya - some wine for Ivan Gracha
'   - man the guard station, eyeing the bank of six video monitors
Frankie enters with a big
(Russian) Delivery
Frankie hands Guard 1 the box and hands Guard 2 a clipboard for his signature
Frankie looks at the surveillance monitors and raises an eyebrow
'   - we see Tretiak with Ivan Gracha raising a toast
In the screen's lower corner are the letters "
" The meeting is being taped
-
-4 in the trash receptacle blows
It blows up   and monstrously concussive explosion
' Gracha drops his wine glass; it shatters on the floor
Gracha and his men unholster their weapons
Tretiak's men go for theirs
tense stand-off
What is this, Tretiak
Put your guns down
Tretiak goes to his desk; stabs an intercom button -- '  - The guards, save one, barge out the front door
The remaining guard answers the intercom, leaving  unattended by the surveillance monitors
Her hand moves to  -  behind the video monitors, yanking it
She plugs a  into the monitor, then replugs the co-axial cable into the transmitter
The guard turns to Frankie
What was that
: -  - stands in a shop doorway
He pulls out his homing device
Adjusts the screen
- The computerized screen now shows the
Two pulses: 1) a fixed pulse (Templar) and 2) a moving pulse (Jillian) on the other side of town
Templar turns his collar up; walks off into the night
-  - comes down a street in a scummy part of town
in a doorway swigs a vodka bottle, looking dangerously at Templar
few pass
Templar pulls out the homing device
-    - The   is one block from Templar, emanating from inside a huge building, the
- Templar pockets the homing device and walks across the street to the train station
-   - An enormous facility, 100 yards long with a vaulted ceiling and entrances at the north and south ends
Templar-enters from the north, looking around
He walks quickly to the center of the station concourse
(v
o
) Next train to Moscow boarding on platform 8
Templar approaches Platform 8
Passengers are boarding the next train to Moscow
Against the wall, a gang of ten  are smoking, drinking vodka, laughing
Templar freezes

Her back's to Templar, but it's her
Same "atomic" jacket, the shoes Templar gave her, same height, same weight
Templar isn't the only one who's spotted her
, obviously Tretiak's men, are converging upon Jillian from the other direction
They haven't yet seen Templar
Templar moves off quickly, drawing his gun
As Tretiak's men move in for the kill
falls in behind them,  the barrel of his gun over one, then the other
They fall, unconscious
The , alarmed, whirl around and
It's not Jillian
Templar, thunderstruck, looks at  ' feet
She's wearing '  and
On her wrist is '
Templar turns
The    is pulling out of the station
Templar sprints away, back toward the station concourse
It's all clear now; Jillian sold her clothes and watch and bought a ticket to Moscow
- are parked in front of the station
Templar picks a
out come the burglar's tools
Templar's through the door lock in two seconds
He gets in and shoves a tool in the ignition lock
: '
- Templar speeds down the highway, moving in and out of traffic
His cellular phone chirps
He unpockets it, clicks it on
Simon
Good news
-   - In the b
g
through a window, we see Tretiak's headquarters looming down the street
Frankie sits in front of six   like those in Tretiak's headquarters; they are receiving the video transmissions from Tretiak's surveillance cameras
We see exteriors, Zubov's lab, corridors, etc
Frankie is looking at    ' ; Tretiak is pacing, talking on the phone
They haven't found her and they don't know where she is
-   / She's on a train to Moscow
That's bad news
They're 'stopping every train leaving the city
Call you later, Frankie
Templar tosses the phone and jerks the wheel
The

: - The St
Petersburg city outskirts
Templar's

- Templar stares ahead through the windshield
'  -    -  half mile ahead is a street crossing
We see the blinking caboose lights of the
It's stopped at an intersection in front of    parked across the tracks
- sits alone, looking around nervously, wondering why the hell the train's stopped
Her hair is brushed over the gash on her forehead
She wears the prostitute's ratty jacket and shoes
- Two of Tretiak's men enter the first passenger car, heads swiveling back and forth, checking every passenger's face
-   - Templar runs up to the rear passenger car
-   - Tretiak's men come through the third car
-   - Templar comes the other way looking for Jillian
Through one car and into the next
He sees
This time it is her
-   - On come Tretiak's men, into another car
They're one car away now
- ' sits up in her seat; she looks through the connecting door into the next car, which '  are entering
She rises to flee, running into -- --
Jillian's eyes bulge
She's going to scream
Templar clamps her mouth and shoves her forward to the exit door which opens to the parallel tracks
Templar wrenches open the door and sticks his head outside, looking down the tracks
We hear a   and
Templar comes back inside
'  are half-way through the next car and approaching fast
We're going to jump
Okay
Jillian, terrified, wide-eyed, nods
And they jump
- Templar and Jillian lunge from the train onto the parallel tracks

Jillian looks up; her face contorts with shock at -- bearing down on them at 60 m
p
h
100 feet
Now 70
50
Jesus, it's right on top of them
grabs her hand and yanks her across the tracks with 10 feet to go
The   past them
- '  enter the car where Jillian was
Outside, the St
Petersburg train flashes by, blocking any view of Templar and Jillian on the other side of the tracks
They continue down the aisle, into the next car
- The train to St
Petersburg is gone
Jillian stares at Templar with hateful eyes
He gets up and yanks her to her feet
Pulls her back toward the train to Moscow
-   - is having a heated conversation on a cellular phone
Outside, we see '  walking toward their vehicles
Templar and Jillian enter the private berth across from the businessman
It has reclining chairs and a curtain for privacy
The train again
Templar and Jillian sit, regarding each other
You can't get rid of me
Like a bad flu
Pretty smart, selling the clothes and watch
You were going for the
embassy, weren't you
Present tense please am going
Before we discuss the present, let's discuss the past
She stares hard, malevolently at him
Who the hell are you
want full name, address, profession, and don't - don't - say Michael Quinn of 112 Mason Street, shoemaker
My name is Simon Templar
don't have an address because live in hotels
'm a professional thief
Good
We're getting somewhere
'd like to respond to that
The German Businessman is looking at them
Jillian pulls the curtain shut
Then she  Templar, hard, across the face
You wicked man
(slaps him again
You liar
(slaps him again) Thief
She draws back to slap him again
He catches her arm
They freeze this way, faces inches apart
She's trembling, her face a mask of hatred
hope you rot in hell
He lets go of her
She stands up
Where are you going
As far away from you as  can
Templar pulls out his 9mm pistol
Sit down
Jillian stares at the gun
You're joking
Michael Quinn jokes
don't
She glares at him
Slowly sits
Templar pulls out his cellular phone
Punches numbers
Remy
Be at Moscow Airport at eight a
m
, fueled and ready to go
Templar clicks off the phone and pockets it
Then he pockets the gun, its barrel pointing at Jillian through his jacket
With his free hand he grabs her arm and puts it under his arm, clamping it to his body
We're going to sit here and not make a scene
'd get some rest
Templar leans back, shutting his eyes
sleep light
Jillian, out of the corner of her eye, notices something through the curtain
-    is folding up his cellular phone and stuffing it in his satchel briefcase on the floor
He leans back and closes his eyes
The satchel briefcase sticks into the aisle
Close enough for Jillian to touch
: ,  -  - The exquisite, astonishing city on the Ganges River
- courtyard in the traditional Indian style
Zubov and two of Tretiak's men approach a building
Zubov rings the doorbell
Seconds pass
The door opens
An Indian gentleman peers out
He's about 50, in a madras shirt and nehru jacket
This is
, whose taped lecture we heard in Jillian's station wagon
Dr
Singh
Dr
Vijay Singh
Who are you and what do you want
My name is Vapin Zubov
would like to discuss something with
(scowls) Come back at a decent hour
Dr
Singh begins to shut the door
Zubov puts his hand in the door, jamming it
would like to discuss cold fusion, Doctor
Dr
Singh's demeanor changes
Pushes open the door
Come in
: - are yawning, pulling up their window blinds
Sunlight streams in
passes by
Thirty minutes to Moscow, thirty minutes
The Porter moves past the German Businessman; he's asleep and snoring
Across the aisle -- '  are darting from the German Businessman, to , who's looking out the window
need to use the ladies' room
think you can trust me to
don't trust anybody
Jillian gives Templar a disgusted look
She rises and moves into the aisle
Ternplar follows
Tell me something
How much were you paid
It's not your business
Move
think it is
'mon
Tell me
Fifteen million dollars, but it didn't work out
Did it
They pass a  serving snacks (fruits and cheeses) from a cart
Jillian looks' at the cart
Does it bother you
What you do
No
You have no conscience
No sense of morality
Define morality
It's a commonly used and generally understood word
Not by me
They've arrived outside the
Jillian opens the door, begins to enter
Wait
You are not going in there with me
Templar brushes past her, leaving the door open
He steps up on the toilet, examining the  above
Okay, how about: Do unto others as they would do unto you
How about: Do unto others before they do unto you
Templar pulls up the window
It opens only five inches; it's prevented from rising further by    drilled through the frame
How about: love thy neighbor
The man who said that was crucified by his
Satisfied, Templar steps down and walks back to Jillian
She shakes her head, laughs mirthlessly
Were you raised by wolves
Who were your parents, Lucretia Borgia and the Marquis de Sader The two people in question weren't as nice as that
wouldn't know
never met them
Are you through
It's all yours
She gives him a look and shoves past him into -- Jillian enters, closes the door and locks it
She stands on the toilet and examines the window
Sees the safety screws
She steps down
She turns on the sink, then kneels and pulls up her pantleg, revealing '   stuffed in her sock
She pulls it out
She turns the sink on full blast, creating as much noise as she can, and punches numbers
International operator please
(pause) The American Embassy in Moscow, please
Jillian waits for the call to connect and  : -   - Jillian exits the ladies' room
You really will rot in hell, know that
Good, all my friends will be waiting for me
They move down the aisle, passing the  , Jillian's hand dangles over the fruit and cheese cart
She plucks up a   with two fingers and slides it up her sleeve
Friends
thought you trusted no one
don't
Give it to me
(innocently) What
The knife you just took
Jillian sighs
Pulls the serving knife out of her sleeve and hands it over
When she turns back toward her berth, she doesn't like what she sees -- has woken up
He's yawning, opening up a stack of business correspondence sitting on the armrest of his chair with a continues down the aisle, sweating it out
If the guy discovers that his phone is missing
Each step is a mile
Finally Jillian and Templar come to their berth
The German Businessman is reading a letter
The letter opener is sitting on the stack of unopened letters
Jillian "accidentally" knocks the stack of letters and letter opener off the armrest
They fall to the floor next to the German Businessman's satchel briefcase
Jillian quickly drops to a kneeling position and begins gathering up all the letters
'm so sorry
As Jillian rises and hands the German Businessman his letters, we see that is back in the German Businessman's satchel briefcase
Templar and Jillian sit down
: -  ,   - The train pulls into the station
- The Porter comes down the aisle, calling out: Moscow Station, Moscow Station
Templar and Jillian move with the other passengers toward the exits
As they pass the ladies' room: Give me a second, will you
don't feel well
Make it quick
Jillian goes in the bathroom
- ' Jillian enters and stands on the toilet
Out comes the German Businessman's She centers the opener in one of the screw heads, leans into it, and twists
She begins unscrewing it
-   ' Templar is impatiently looking at the ladies' room door
The passengers are filing past him
He knocks on the door
- ' Jillian's got one screw out
The other is coming
Templar  again
Just a second
-   ' Templar knocks again,
No response inside
The German Businessman passes by him
Porter,  seem to have lost my letter opener
Templar stares at the guy
- The door  open, splintering the lock
Templar bursts in
Something instantly gets his attention
The fully opened window
And no Jillian
Templar bolts out
: -  ,   - Jillian hurries up the escalator to the main concourse
stupendous, vaulted interior
As impressive as Grand Central in New York or Victoria in London
She moves through the crowd
Eyes scanning everything and nothing
She bumps into  , who scowls
Jillian takes cover by one of the immense marble pillars
She pulls her collar up
Waits it out
-   studies her
He's tall, blonde, looks like he played linebacker for Ohio State
He approaches
She eyes him
Everyone is a potential enemy
But this guy is obviously American
Ms
St
Thomas
Jillian
Yes
The Blonde Man opens his wallet, flipping out his   and
John Whitehead, Special Agent, Central Intelligence Agency
Was your trip all right
Yes it was fine, oh who cares, 'm finally safe
(squeezes his hand) Do you have a car
Yes, outside
First 'd like to ask you some questions
That was an interesting story you told the embassy
Interesting
It's true
Please understand: the United States Embassy receives fifty calls a day
My husband's been murdered, my daughter's been sold into white slavery, you get the idea
So before we waste a lot of people's time, Ms
St
Thomas, you say you have p
h
d
s in chemistry and nuclear physics
What's the atomic symbol for, say
gold
Pause
Jillian stares at Whitehead
You've gotta be kidding me
: -   -   - Templar dashes across the platform, looking everywhere
Jillian has vanished
Suddenly his cellular phone chirps
He unpockets it and clicks it on
Talk to me, Frankie
- '   - , red-eyed and drinking coffee, is staring at the video transmission from Tretiak's office
Tretiak and Ilya are talking
(as deemed necessary) She called the
Embassy a half hour ago
What
(considers this) Does Tretiak know
Simon, the
Embassy has more leaks than a Polish submarine
Who do you think intercepted the call
As  says that, she doubletakes at the monitor showing Tretiak's office
Frankie's eyes widen
-    has entered the room
It is the crusading reformer,
Frankie stabs a button on a tape recorder next to her monitors
It begins taping the transmission from Tretiak's office
Thanks, Frankie
Simon, wait
Frankie turns some dials, bringing into   Tretiak and Romanov
She ups the volume
We hear this: Hail Michael Romanov, Czar of the Fatherland
How will that sound to the average Russian
(a whisper) don't believe it
: -   -  - runs up the escalator, plowing through the disembarking passengers, taking two stairs at a time
-  ,   - Templar comes off the escalator
The place is packed with
He moves off, eyes darting in all directions for Jillian, while meanwhile ,    - Cd, that's big "" little "d," cadmium's valence is 2, its atomic number is 48 and its atomic weight is 112
411 or would you like that carried out five more decimal places
Good enough
(smiles) Good enough
Come this way, Ms
St
Thomas
He ushers her off
As they move from behind the pillar, 50 yards away -- -  sees Jillian and Whitehead
He looks around, thinking
He sprints for the side exit
-   -  / - The circular drive where travelers are picked up and deposited by taxis, buses, automobiles
Jillian and Whitehead exit the station
-    are waiting
Several darksuited  stand next to an open back door
(shakes her head) What a nightmare
To think my work could just be taken from me
You're safe now, Doctor St
Thomas
We'll have you back in New York in no time
They continue toward the parked Mercedes
Suddenly Jillian blinks
She sees something
It's , driving a Russian sedan
He rolls to a stop across the circular drive, staring a hole right through Jillian, grimly shaking his head at her, trying to warn her
Agent Whitehead
Whitehead looks at Jillian
Pause
Jillian eyes Templar across the drive
Yes
Jillian looks at the men waiting by the Mercedes
She looks at two Moscow police officers standing to the side
Something's wrong
Something doesn't feel right
Ms
St
Thomas
You had a question
They're drawing closer to the waiting Mercedes
Nothing,  was just thinking that when my research was stolen  felt like the Buffalo Bills after they lost four World Series
Hah hah,  bet you did
'm a baseball fan too hah hah
Jillian looks at him differently
The Buffalo Bills lost four Super Bowls, Whitehead
They continue toward the waiting sedans
'  dart around
Her forehead is sweaty
And she bolts from him, taking Whitehead by surprise
sprints across the circular drive for Templar's car, Whitehead after her
The men by the waiting Mercedes converge on Jillian from the side
throws open the passenger side door for Jillian
The men coming from the Mercedes open fire on Templar, blowing in the sedan's side window
Templar ducks
' almost there
She reaches the open sedan and dives inside
She tries to shut the door;  gets hold of it
at Templar
Go
Templar floors it
The car  away from the curb
Whitehead runs alongside, trying to get the door open
The car accelerates
Whitehead sprints but can't keep up
His feet leave the ground; he clings to the doorframe through the blown-out window
Whitehead pulls his gun from his shoulder holster and aims across Jillian's body at Templar
His finger squeezes the trigger as Jillian shoves his hand up
blow holes in the roof of the car
hits Whitehead, hard, in the head
Whitehead's head snaps back
She hits him again
Whitehead falls away from the car
He rolls twenty feet and stops, dazed but alive
'    - Templar guns the sedan through a
Cars to the left and right to a stop
The sedan flies on
We're going to the airport
Templar guns the accelerator
-   -   - The   pull up to Whitehead, who staggers to his feet
He gets in the lead Mercedes; the two cars race off after Templar and Jillian
'   - Templar floors it through another intersection
he looks in his rear view mirror
There's no sign of the two Mercedes
They've escaped
Good
Is it
Who's worse them or you
Templar looks down and registers shock -- - -    ,    with a walking stick is tap tapping across the intersection
Jillian cringes, expecting the worst
Templar throws the steering wheel and -- -  - -- The sedan swerves, clearing the   by two inches, skidding wildly through the intersection
'   - Templar fights the wheel but he's losing
The skid can't be corrected
Jillian
-  - The sedan slides sideways, hits the curb and flips over, spinning like a top across the sidewalk
: '  - The Mercedes moves through traffic
Whitehead and the other men look around
The Mercedes rounds a corner
Across the intersection is the   on the sidewalk, surrounded by gawking
- The Mercedes pulls up
Whitehead and his men get out
They warily approach the sedan, drawing guns
The pedestrians back off, getting the hell out of the way
Whitehead and his men surround the car
They kneel, guns trained inside
Templar and Jillian are gone
Whitehead barks at his men
Fifteen block radius
Go house to house
Whitehead looks around at the surrounding buildings
We  on one of them, a    several blocks away, under scaffolding and mesh wire, in the process of renovation
pushes in on the church's
- and we're in the turret's interior: round, with stained glass windows, a desk and chair
trap door leading to the vestibule below
comes up, followed by Templar, his gun in hand
They're cut and bruised, exhausted
Jillian slumps against the wall, shivering
Templar puts his equipment on the desk and goes to each of the windows
From this elevation he can see the entire city
'   -  , a mile across town, where a thousand Muscovites are listening to a pro Michael Romanov speech
Shifting from Red Square to the city outskirts, we see , where Remy waits
'   -     is just a few blocks away - we see the American flag flying from the roof stanchion
In the intersections around the embassy, Tretiak's men stand by their vehicles, watching
Every point of access to the embassy is sealed
We see
Mercedes pulls up to him
gets out
The embassy's surrounded
- is staring at Templar's computer
The modem is engaging
sits up, staring at the screen
Jillian reads an   which appears: , 20
Jillian's eyes grow wide with terror
Templar looks out a third window
'   - Tretiak's men are going building to building in a fifteen block radius sweep, closing in on the church
The airport's out
They're drawing a noose around us
We don't have much time
turns away from the window
He sees Jillian looking at his computer
He walks over to it and reads the message
Jillian gets slowly to her feet, watching Templar
's mouth quivers as Templar types:
Templar looks at Jillian
She stares back
long moment
Neither moves
What are you going to do
Tell me
deserve at least that
(desperate now) 'll die
If you take their offer, they'll kill me
And if  don't, they'll kill me
Interesting situation 'd say
Jillian sinks to the chair, her voice shaking
Oh god
It's over, it's all over
You're not human
You're an animal
'm a businessman
perform services for profit
And spare me the lecture
You didn't spend ten years in that mildewed basement for the good of humanity, you did it to get rich
Richer than anyone on earth
Richer than God
(beat) 'll make you an offer - pay me my fifteen million out of your royalties - should come to about one month's
Pause
She slowly looks up at him
don't hold the patent rights to cold fusion
What
You fool
Don't you understand
(her voice cracks; she begins to softly cry) It wasn't about money, it wasn't about becoming rich
If you don't own the patent rights, who does
foundation in my name
The royalties were going to go to scientific research, curing cancer,
christ how can you understand this
She lowers her head, weeping openly
in on Templar, staring at her
Even the darkest of men have a seed of goodness
Here, for the first time, does it flower in Simon Templar
But we don't know this
Templar betrays nothing
He picks up his homing device and clicks it on
He types in this command:
The device beeps;     appears
He types a new command:
Moscow's   appears superimposed over the street grid; we see the guts of the city; the Moscow subway, water and gas mains, etc
In a corner of the screen is a
Templar analyzes the information on the screen
He quickly rises; goes to Jillian, pulling off his belt
He pulls her up
She stands limply, still weeping, no longer resisting
He's bigger and stronger, there's no use
Templar gathers Jillian's wrists together and ties them with the belt
He pulls her to the trapdoor and  : - Several pedestrians walk by
Templar walks Jillian quickly to a He kneels and hoists the cover off
He points into the hole
Jillian, her wrists bound, steps down uneasily, her feet finding the top rung of a
She descends into the manhole
Templar follows
-    - Jillian and Templar come down the ladder, dropping to the steel-gridded walkway over the Moscow sewer
Templar pulls Jillian twenty feet down the walkway
At this point in the wall there is a  with a compression , the turning of which opens the hatch, like on a submarine
Within the hatch we hear
That's a municipal water main
In one hour you're going in there
Templar pulls out a
Clicks it on
Jillian, shivering with terror, stares at the blade
Listen
They shut it down twice a day for five minutes to clean the filters
Once at noon, once at midnight
Noon is in one hour
How do you know all this
Part of my job
Now ask the logical question
where does it go
Very good
Under the United States Embassy
There's an exit hatch into the embassy courtyard
That's where we're going
We
Templar lowers his gun
He lowers the blade to her wrists and cuts the belt
You heard me
long pause
They stare at each other
Then what happens
Let's get to the embassy, then we'll talk about it
Templar - about that night at my house
Don't talk about it, okay
He turns away from her
She watches him
Okay
: -   -  - The Michael Romanov supporters are marching past the Kremlin with ' , chanting: Ahead, awaiting them, are -- Two units of   in riot gear
clicks on a megaphone
Disperse
Disperse
On come the Romanov supporters
Rocks start flying
The Romanov supporters push into the line of police
The police push back with shields and truncheons
melee breaks out
The Romanov supporters surge past the police
It is a wild, uncontrolled, chaotic scene
-     - flood past the embassy gates, chased by Moscow Policemen
Fights rage allover the street
full-fledged riot is breaking out
are burning
run through the streets with stolen goods
We hear the sporadic  of small arms fire
and    detachment, grimfaced and heavily armed, stand silent vigil inside the embassy's wrought-iron gates
, embassy c

, exits the embassy and approaches the front gates
smashes at his feet, showering him
Jesus
Christ
Ilya and his men stand next to their vehicles, silently watching the embassy
: - The  water in the municipal water main begins to subside
Templar looks at this watch
- '  - it is exactly 12 noon
Right on time
The water subsides to a trickle
Templar grips the hatchwheel and turns it
Opens the hatch
Residual water spills out onto the walkway
Templar pulls himself into the water main
He extends his hand to Jillian
Jillian looks uncertainly inside
Four blocks
Right under Tretiak's men and up into the embassy compound
You can do this
She grabs Templar's hand
He pulls her up and inside -- -    - -- a four foot diamater pipe
Templar pulls out a , switches it on and sticks it between his teeth
On hands and kneess Templar and Jillian move off through the water main
- Templar and Jillian crawl up
Templar shines his penlight at the ceiling; is above them
It doesn't seem like we've gone far enough
We haven't, up there's the street in front of the embassy
(looks at his wristwatch) Come on
We've got two minutes
They crawl off through the water main
Templar and Jillian crawl toward
There it is
They reach the exit hatch
They look at it
Jillian trembles
Oh my god
The   has no hatchwheel
It's sealed
Jillian, panicked, looks down the water main
We
we've got to go back
(checks his watch) Not enough time
(thinks) The hatch under the street
What about Tretiak's men
Better than drowning
They scramble off
We hear   coming down the pipe
The water's back on
Back they go, crawling as fast as they can
- Templar and Jillian reach the exit hatch under the street
Templar grips the hatchwheel as -- through the pipe, hitting Jillian flush, blowing her backward; she desperately clings to Templar's shoulders as he spins the hatchwheel
The water rises mercilessly
There's a foot of air, then six inches, then just three, then none at all, and they're under water
desperately turns the hatchwheel, spinning it one last time and , the hatch door blows open - - - and  against      running along the wall of the service manhole,  a fissure in it
blows out of the pipe
pulls himself up
He reaches down and pulls Jillian up
Templar kicks the exit hatchdoor closed and spins the hatchwheel shut
looks at the  spewing from the cracked pipe
She sniffs the air
Templar looks at the pipe
warning is printed in five languages:  -
City gas line
We can't stay here, we'll asphyxiate
Templar and Jillian clamber up the steel runged ladder to the manhole cover
Templar pushes up the manhole cover, popping his head out, looking around
widen with alarm --- is rolling straight for his head
He ducks and closes the manhole cover as the   over it
Templar listens
Above, the van has stopped
Templar pushes up the manhole cover
The  has stopped directly over the manhole
- Templar slithers out
Pulls up Jillian
They're under the van now
The van's rear door opens;   jump down to the pavement
We see their  ; they are  , arriving to arrest the looters
Templar and Jillian crawl toward the van's rear
Templar looks toward
It's 100 yards away, but looks like 100 miles
Both of us will never make it
But one of us can
(draws his gun) Give me ten seconds, then break for the embassy and don't stop running until you're at the gates
It's a hundred yards, so move it
What are you going to
That's my business
Wait
(he stops) Simon
Don't do this
They'll kill you
long, tense pause
The world can do without Simon Templar
It can't do without you
(smiles grimly) See you around sometime
He takes a deep breath and logrolls out
-  gets to his feet in the street, gun drawn
He races from the van, heading in a direction away from the embassy
-  double takes, seeing Templar sprinting from the van
Kill him
Ilya, Whitehead and Tretiak's men sprint down the street after Templar, firing as they run, leaving -- with a clear path to the embassy
She counts it off:  three
four
five

' Colonel Crosby watches the situation unfold
What the hell is going on

Templar returns fire from behind the car

Jillian logrolls out from under the van
She sprints for the embassy gates

As he returns fire, he exhorts her under his breath
Go
Faster

He spins, running in a new direction
He's going to get Jillian before she can reach the embassy
, sprinting, screams to the embassy marines
Open the gate
-   turns to his second in command, a Lieutenant
Do it
Lieutenant Jones and a   push open the embassy gates
watches Jillian helplessly
There's nothing he can do
Not until she reaches the embassy
On Jillian comes, legs pumping, feet pounding the pavement

She can feel his breath he's so close
Twenty yards

-  dodges bullets, corning thick and heavy now, and watches in terror as --- , with a desperate reach, collars Jillian
She shrugs off her jacket, leaving Ilya with the jacket but no Jillian
Jillian lunges through the embassy gates
and is instantly surrounded by
Marines
Jillian looks up at Colonel Crosby, panting
'm an American citizen
You have our full protection ma'am
(looks at Ilya) Back away from the gate
Ilya's black eyes stare at Colonel Crosby
He backs away from the gate
He turns and sees - , out of bullets with his hands raised, surrounded by Tretiak's men behind the overturned automobile
Ilya, fuming, walks across the street to Templar
-  walks up to Templar
With the calm efficiency of a hangman, Ilya puts his hand on Templar's shoulder and forces him down, down to his knees
He sticks his gun to Templar's head
He's going to execute Templar right there, behind the overturned car in the street
- , watching, frantically turns to Colonel Crosby
Do something
That's Russian soil out there, ma'am
Jillian turns away, horrified, shielding her eyes
- (Russian) Wait
cigarette
It's customary
Ilya looks at Templar
Looks at his men
And Ilya laughs
Chuckling at first, then open-mouthed
All of '  laugh in Templar's face
Ilya takes out a cigarette
Hands it to Templar
Lights it for him
(Russian) Thank-you
And Ilya and Tretiak's men continue to laugh
They won't be for long
Because Templar is looking at   above the municipal lines below
And '  are sniffing the air, wondering why it smells like rotten eggs
Templar flicks the cigarette into the grate and dives away as -- blows sky high as ignites
Ilya, Whitehead, and the other men are blown off their feet
Some are killed
Asphalt and dirt rain down, followed by -- , as the municipal water main goes up
Ilya and Whitehead get to their feet, looking around, water falling like a monsoon
Templar is gone
And the police van is  away
- Templar guns the van through Moscow streets
He pulls out his cellular phone
Punches numbers
- Remy stands by his jet, smoking a cigar, looking impatiently at his watch
His cellular phone beeps
Simon, where the hell are you
You want me to do what
Remy clicks off the phone and scrambles up into the cockpit of the Lear
- Templar guns the van straight for -- group of '  conducting the building-to building search
They pull two sedans into the intersection, blocking it
- Templar doesn't slow - he accelerates, and hits the two cars where their bumpers meet,  through them -- -- and races on past the intersection
'    - Remy's Lear jet skirts Moscow rooftops, just 200 feet off the ground
As the jet clears the  roof, we see majestic Red Square spreading before us
- '   roars into Red Square as -- - '   touches down
In Red Square
It taxis to a stop next to Lenin's tomb
The police van  up next to the Lear
Templar races from the van to the jet, dodging  fired from -- ' , firing from sedans entering the square
The Lear jet accelerates straight for the oncoming sedans, lifting off, almost scraping the landing gear against their windshields
It wings into the air, clearing the top of the Ivan Memorial by a foot
And heads west
To freedom

What about your data
It's in my head
'll wing it
(draws closer to her) You need to conduct further research anyway
'll help you
What are we researching
Jillian draws closer
Their lips are almost touching
The benefits of warm fusion
Templar pulls her lips to his and
'  - There follows a love scene
Afterward, in each other's arms: It is in the eyes
You're not bad
Being bad is the only thing 've ever been good at
You can be good at being good

If tomorrow morning the sky falls, have clouds for breakfast
If the birds forget their songs, listen to the wind
And if between right and wrong, do what is right
Who said that

Whispers to her

The two men are side-by-side
They begin inching across the sill to a - ladder leading to the concrete floor below

His arms flail
He tries to keep his balance, but fails
Templar catches Ilya's wrist

The plexiglass box has two' compartments, one empty, the other filled with Templar positions the plexiglass box over the radiation detector
He unpockets     and bolts the box tightly to the concrete floor with the cordless boltdriver
(The plexiglass box has a steel mount with holes for this purpose
) - The naval guards reach the end of the perimeter wall, then turn back toward the nuclear situation facility
-    - Templar turns a knob on the plexiglass box;   separating the two compartments within the box
Inside,    releases
It wafts into the radiation detector's sensors
Templar watches anxiously, talking to it
Radon isn't plutonium but you don't know that
The detector's   begins
Boom, you just got nuked

He stands, turns, and freezes

Friends, countrymen,  give you Major Antonin Scarpinin
Major Scarpinin (the Special Forces Major), climbs atop the tank turret
Twenty minutes ago a team of Russian Special Forces, acting on confidential information, raided President Karpov's office

As Tretiak moves through the crowd,   and twenty of his men approach
Thank you for coming, Ivan, it is a great night for Russia
don't give a damn who's president

Maybe you should take greater interest in politics, Ivan Gracha
Tretiak and Gracha turn to Major Scarpinin, listening

Templar and Frankie exchange a steely glance

Seeing Templar and Frankie atop the tank, they stop in their tracks and watch

Shockingly, we see

Simon Templar stashed the tape Frankie recorded of the Tretiak/Romanov meeting in Karpov's office
We see: Hail Michael Romanov, Czar of the Fatherland
How will that sound to the average Russian
The average Russian is a fool
there is confusion, incredulity
' eyes widen
and  stare in disbelief at the screen

He exists to be dominated
To partnership in government
No Romanov to partnership in crime

Tretiak's men go for the upstairs staircase

Dr
Singh and Zubov, having seen everything that just transpired, are frantically destroying their data and records
Zubov is burning the cold fusion hardcopies in a waste basket
Dr
Singh is deleting the computer files
Tretiak and Ilya come down the stairs
Zubov pops a 3 1/4 disk from the computer
We reduced the fusion formula to one disk and destroyed everything else
Good
And Tretiak draws his gun
As does Ilya
Zubov and Dr
Singh stare at the guns
What
what are you
Tretiak shoots Zubov
Ilya shoots Dr
Singh
The two scientists fall, dead
So much for honor among thieves
Then Tretiak wheels on Ilya, his gun coming up
Yes, so much for honor among thieves
Tretiak freezes, startled
Because Ilya has his gun leveled on Tretiak
Tretiak tries to speak
Words won't form
Ilya
Tretiak pitches over backward
Ilya walks past Tretiak's corpse, yanks the computer disk from Zubov's lifeless hand and turns -- stands across the lab, gun in hand
Ilya's eyes dart around the room
We can share this, Templar
We don't own it
Who does
(eyes glinting) The Jillian St
Thomas Foundation
There is a sudden shrill
Templar and Ilya look around
Don't be a fool
'm a fool
You thought you could get away with murder
Used curare didn't you
Induces blood-clotting
Templar clicks back the hammer
What do you want
The  is louder
Anyone with military service knows the sound of incoming ordnance
What do  want

revenge
Now give me the disk
There's a massive  above
The laboratory is teeters over, falling on , knocking the gun from his hand

Templar grabs for his gun, lying in a puddle of
He grabs the gun; the acid burns his flesh
He drops it and races for the stairs
'   - Ilya emerges from the basement stairwell and races for the front door
Templar comes up; sprints after Ilya
Ilya, with Templar hotly behind, gets to the front door, flings it open, and
freezes
And Ilya and Templar are suddenly staring down the barrel of -- Just sitting there in the mansion courtyard
Russian soldiers behind it
Ilya and Templar duck
The tank
The   explodes from the tank's barrel, flies through the mansion's front door over Ilya and Templar's heads
wings across the interior of the mansion
and  into the rear wall of the mansion, exploding, blowing the wall down, revealing   at the mansion's rear, lumbering toward it
Ilya slams the door shut and whirls on Templar
They trade blows
Ilya has the better of this
He shoves Templar aside and races back through the foyer
Templar recovers and races after Ilya, tackling him in the middle of the floor
They roll on the floor, trading vicious blow after vicious blow, when --- --     into the mansion's domed cupola
Templar and Ilya look up in horror as -- 20     descends
Templar and Ilya dive away
The chandelier spectacularly in the middle of the foyer, exploding like a glass grenade hits Templar in the side of the head, opening a gash, dazing him
There's no place to go
Except up
Ilya races for the staircase
Templar recovers and takes up the chase again
Up the staircase they go
slams into the dome, imploding it
and  fall on Ilya and Templar, knocking them both backward
'  - '  - The lab is rocked by the explosions
in beakers fall to the floor,
The chemicals begin to ooze together

The mixing chemicals begin emitting smoke

Two men drag a crate into the office
They open it, revealing an -
They pull it from the crate and set up the tri-pod

Ilya reaches the mezzanine
He climbs atop the balustrade and jumps to the lip of the crater in the dome
He pulls himself up
Templar repeats Ilya's actions: climbs atop the balustrade and jumps to the lip of the crater
As he pulls himself up
appears
He compresses his foot against Templar's knuckles
Templar grimaces
There's no way out this time
There's a burst of   as    explodes on the roof, knocking Ilya off his feet, allowing -- -- Templar to pull himself up to the roof
'   /   - The tanks continue firing
Russian Marines fire round after round into the mansion
Tretiak's men inside return the fire
Harry, Remy and Frankie run up, looking with alarm at the vicious firefight
Realizing Templar is within
' The anti-tank grenade launcher is operational
One of Tretiak's men loads, the other fires, and -- '  - -- an -  launches from the window and hits the tank in the courtyard, blowing its turret off
Tretiak's men fire assault rifles from the windows
No one's surrendering
It's a fight to the death
'  -  - Templar and Ilya, on the mansion's roof
The view is mind-boggling: the nighttime St
Petersburg skyline looming in the background and, below, three Russian tanks firing shell after shell into the mansion
Across the exploding, crumbling rooftop, Ilya and Templar go explodes in front of Ilya
Ilya falls, concussed by the shell
Templar dives upon him, wrenching the from Ilya's pocket
Ilya slams his forearm into Templar's head
The disk flies from Templar's hand, scuttles across the roof shingles, falling through a crater
it flutters to the mansion floor, 50 feet down
They get to their feet, circling each other
Their footing is not trustworthy, like ice in Spring
Tank shells  into the mansion's upper architecture and roof
shell hits the mansion's east wall, detaching the   running up it
Ilya draws a
Backing Templar up
Templar's at the very edge of the building
There's no place to go
Templar's feet are unsteady
Because the cornice of the building is crumbling beneath him
And Templar falls
He looks over his shoulder, his wrists turning, hands opening, and
Templar catches the detached
The drainpipe sags under Templar's weight, bending
And it stops
Templar hangs there, bobbing up and down above the alley between the mansion and the adjacent building, fifty feet below
Ilya turns back
He's going after the disk
Ilya jumps through the crater to the mezzanine and races down the staircase
while in the basement
'  - '  - Another whole shelf of chemicals falls, smashing
The chemicals continue to mix
'  - Templar dangles from the drainpipe
-
It gives
It gives again
The drainpipe is about to break
Templar looks down into the flames and demolition below
's  - / - Ilya races reaches the foyer
The building is imploding, chunks of stone falling all around him
Ilya's eyes are wild
He wants that disk
Ilya gets to it
Clutches it
It's finally in his hands
He goes for the staircase
'  - '  - The chemicals are steaming now, in a froth, becoming more and more and more volatile
'  - Templar, dangling from the drainpipe, looks wildly around for an escape
If he could just get to that adjacent building
It's too far
And his hands are slipping
Then, from the mansion's basement, the very guts of the building, the chemicals in the lab detonate and -- '    -  - Ilya's eyes bulge in terror as the staircase collapses under him
Ilya falls, engulfed in flame, still clutching the cold fusion disk
'  - The drainpipe fully detaches from the collapsing mansion wall
It falls away from the mansion, with Templar still holding on
Templar releases from the drainpipe and catches the lip of the roof cornice of the adjacent building
Templar pulls himself up and looks back at

The entire building comes apart at the seams
It crashes into a heap of rubble

Anderson at the Met gave a thousand this year
Lucy
But ' not listening
She's staring at a check
Her eyes are like hubcaps
Oh my goodness gracious
(looks at Delores) Get Mr
Thomas, Delores
What is it
check for fifty
(gulps) million dollars
Delores gets up, goes to Lucy, who's hyperventilating
Lucy hands her the check
Delores starts hyperventilating
Lucy reads the letter: It's from a "Jillian St
Thomas Foundation," for the benefit of scientific research
Never heard of it
Lemme see
Lucy hands Delores the letter
-   is printed under a letterhead with a logo design: the stick figure man with halo, the same design as the tiepin Jillian gave Templar
Delores looks at Lucy
Lucy looks back
And over this we hear a voice
We've heard it before
If you're afraid of the dark, remember the night rainbow

The spires of Manhattan rise above him
The sun is setting
If tomorrow morning the sky falls, have clouds for breakfast
If the birds forget their songs, listen to the wind

And if between right and wrong
And Simon Templar joins Jillian here, speaking with her soul
do what is right
And Simon whispers to himself
will do what is right
, we see that the sunset has cast rays through the bridgework
And we can't be certain, it is vague, but the rays filtering through the bridgework seem to cast a halo over Templar's head
He is, now, The Saint
to be continued
