First Blood 2 : by James Cameron December 22, 1983 : - drab   with
printed on the door stops at the steps of a fortress-like colonial-style building
Iron bars cover the windows
The lawn sprinklers snap mindlessly to themselves
-style printout appears at the bottom of : - 117 , as the doors open and   MPs, one of whom was driving, emerge
The other opens the rear door for who stands, eyeing the imposing facade of the hospital
Trautman is in his early fifties and wears the mantle of command sternly but without arrogance
He takes the stairs with purposeful strides, the MPs falling in behind him
above the main door as they go inside: gray metal door bearing the sign " " bangs open and a massive  in white passes through
He is followed by the two MPs, Trautman, and a who hustles to keep up with the others
the entourage as they stride forward
The MPs are grim-faced and walk in step
Trautman and a doctor  silently walk through the corridor
They pass the open day-room where somnambulistic patients sit like statuary watching "The Young and the Restless" or watching the wallpaper fade
Bleak light from an overcast day filters through the barred window
The vets seem older than their years and although some show the physical scars of combat, there is no doubt that the greatest trauma for these men is behind the eyes
As they pass the open doors of the rooms of the "chronic ward", haunted eyes turn toward them
As they approach the nurse's station for the "chronic ward" the orderly nods
The   turns to her console
-  ' hits a button on the console
as a solenoid-operated bolt snaps back with a loud The orderly's good hand shoves the door open
"" The entourage enters a long narrow corridor lined with locked doors
Occasionally faces appear at the safety-glass windows set in the doors
Men whose souls have fled
Their eyes track us as we move past
An emaciated  in an untied hospital smock and bare feet stands as if lost in the center of the corridor
as they detour around the man, whose clawlike hand catches at Trautman's tunic
hoarse, demented  issues from one of the doors, a desperate  from another
as keys  and the door opens
as the group enters a dark service stairwell
The single fluorescent light flickers stroboscopically, a pulsing twilight
Shit
Maintenance never gets down here
They descend two flights to a door of steel bars on a sliding track
The MPs flank Lewis as he unlocks the door
So what am  supposed to do
Can't transfer him to Leavenworth
He's civilian
So  put him in an isolation cell that hasn't been used since the Spanish Inquisition
rolling aside on metal tracks
This area of the hospital's basement has been used for little but storage in recent years
Stacks of obsolete equipment gathers dust, leaving only a narrow walkspace
The steel doors of the isolation cells yawn open, except for the last one
Maybe you should have tried cutting him some slack
Lewis opens a cabinet near the single locked cell and removes a
He feeds a -  into the single-shot bolt action
(continuing) What's that
Tranquilizer syrette gun
Borrowed it from the Animal Control Department
Trautman pushes the barrel aside with a contemptuous snort and steps up to the cell door
Gimme a break
(nods toward door) Open it
The two MPs flank the door
One pulls on the latching lever
Bolts slide
The door swings open, revealing blackness
(muttering) Thinks he's the fucking Prince of Darkness
One  tries the switch beside the cell, flicking it several times
Nothing
He glances apprehensively at the other  and they step into the dark cell
, dimly outlined, as it twists a light bulb a half-turn in its socket
In the sudden light the MPs face an imposing figure
, wearing only a pair of filthy jeans, stands "ready" before them
The single light bulb on the low ceiling sends glistening highlights over his taught body
nasty piece of machinery
Long, matted hair coils onto his shoulders, and an unkempt beard heightens the cheekbones beneath eyes which are deep, reptilian
Intense
His position, though not overtly threatening, suggests a willingness to strike without warning which gives the 's pause
Trautman steps forward between the MPs
At ease, Rambo
rising from his slight crouch to stand composed, balanced
parade rest
(continuing to MPs) Wait outside
He closes the door until it latches
Hello, John
Colonel
Mind if  sit down
Rambo motions to the narrow bunk, dropping into an Oriental squat himself as the Colonel sits
Trautman's manner with Rambo is familiar, somehow paternal
bit of an ironic grin twitches briefly
(continuing) hear you're not enjoying it here
could take it or leave it
Trautman sighs and leans back
Seems like 'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it
Am  out of here
That depends on you
(pause) Christ, look at you
give you this easy duty until  can get you an assignment
all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas
and you have to make it Rambo's last stand
There were treating me like a headcase
Hard to believe
You shoot up one little town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun
one little dogpatch town
and everybody figures your wrapper's broken
No sense of humor
(pause) What did you expect
An engraved plague from the chamber of commerce
Rambo looks at his hands
When he finally speaks his voice seems distant, disembodied
In 'Nam  flew gunships
Million dollar equipment
Back here nobody trusts me to park cars
keep thinking it's going to be okay
but 've been out six years and it's not okay
Sometimes  feel like 'm coming right out of my skin
The colonel nods slowly
He notices a battered shoebox on the floor beside the bed
The cell is absolutely devoid of personal articles otherwise
This your stuff
That's it
My life
as Trautman flips through a number of worn snapshots of the men in Rambo's special forces unit
They are horsing around, in and out of uniform younger, cleanshaven Rambo is among them
He is grinning broadly in one shot
It seems uncharacteristic of the hardened man we see now
Hardcore outfit
The best  ever trained
(coldly) Those men are all dead
(glancing up) You're not
He fishes something from among the pathetic debris of Rambo's life
(continuing) Congressional Medal of Honor
(bitterly) Yeah
Big time
Plus, what else
Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and
uh, a handful of Purple Hearts
Five
never wanted that stuff
What did you want
(haltingly) just wanted
don't know
after all that
just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John
" And mean it
That's all
(pause) After all that
You just picked that wrong war to be a hero in
The colonel studies Rambo a moment, then stands abruptly
(continuing) Let's take a walk
: - Rambo and Trautman cross the manicured grounds, escorted by the two grim MPs
number of wheelchair-bound vets enjoy the sunshine
and a desultory game of volleyball is in progress
Still, the impression is of the detritus of war left scattered on a huge lawn like broken toys
As the two approach a conservatively dressed  waiting on a bench under a plane-tree, stands
Jason Kirkhill
John Rambo
Kirkhill extends his hand in greeting, but Rambo coolly half-turns to reveal his hands, locked in - separated by a steel bar so that they can hang comfortably at his sides
Kirkhill grins affably
Drops his hand
Good to meet you, Rambo
How are you
Rambo scans Kirkhill's face, noting the cold scrutiny all but concealed in the smile lines
(coldly) You a spook
Kirkhill drops the smile
That's right
Special Operations Division
Rambo turns to Trautman
don't work with spooks
Not after that op in Cambodia
'm authorized to get you out of here
thought that's what you wanted
(considering) What's the job
Classic special forces op
hit fast
in and out
Two men
Two days
Why me
(shrugs non- committally) We like you
(pause) At least the computer at Langley likes you
Pulled your file because of various factors
Service record
Area familiarity
Where
Not yet
'm not jumping blind
Kirkhill's eyes get hard
It's yes or no
In or out
now
If it's "out," we will not have had this conversation
If you come in, you will not be working for us
No knowledge
No comment
Do you understand
Rambo seems about to turn away
(to Kirkhill) Tell him
'll take responsibility
Kirkhill looks pained, like he has gas
North Vietnam
What they call the Democratic Republic of Vietnam now
as he takes that in
His eyes seem to see all the way there already
Emotions go through him
Exhilaration mixing with terror of the demon he can't turn away from
He nods slowly
We left some people behind there, John
POWs
This just occurred to somebody, now
We don't leave our men, Rambo
Rambo and Trautman lock eyes
Something flows there
Trautman knows his soul
You got it
'm in
He whips one hand around from his side, tossing the manacle bar at a surprised Kirkhill's feet
The wrist-cuffs are still closed
: ' Rambo stands alone in his cell, the door open behind him
He hefts the shoebox filled with his worldly possessions, the scraps of memory, dead friends, and symbols of valor and violent death
He upends the box, spilling everything into the open toilet
Flushes it
And walks out
: - - 84 , clomping in rhythmic lockstep as a platoon of recruits marches past in close order drill
The drill sergeant bellows cadence
(
) Three-fo-your-lef, lef-right-lef
Other lef shithead
Square those pieces away
square 'em away girls
said
as the platoon marches past,   to reveal a sign mounted beside a security checkpoint in a formidable chain-link fence
Kirkhill, accompanied by his basilisk-eyed , strides past Rambo's two MPs flanking the door, into a small room
The room is an austere cubicle with the army's typically drab furniture in "early functional
" The cold eye of a surveillance camera stares down at a single table with a seated figure
Rambo, looking like he may have been there for centuries
The aide hands Rambo a sealed folder and extends a clipboard and pen for him to sign off
This is your mission packet
(quietly overlapping) Sign here, please
And here
Memorize it here
It doesn't leave this room
Rambo unseals the folder, removing a sheaf of photocopied documents, as Kirkhill perches on the table next to him
(continuing) The twenty-four hundred American servicemen missing in action in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are officially listed "Presumed Killed
" Certainly most of them are
Rambo is leafing through the contents of his
He skips a stack of reports and fishes out several grainy 8 10 prints
(continuing) But reports keep filtering in
Sightings by refugees
Nothing verified
Finally, we feel we've got enough to proceed on
Rambo studies the prints
They seem to be high altitude surveillance photos of a small   , surrounded by forests
(continuing) Memo -7 on top will cover the details
An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp
As you can see the intelligence is soft
These photos show huts
barracks
It could be anything
(flat) What's the plan
This operation is in two phases
Recon and rescue
You are phase one
Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them
Negative
Absolutely not
The phase two assault team will get them out
(not pleased) We just take pictures
Don't look so disappointed
It should be hairy enough
even for you
: - Kirkhill's  continues over the image of: The crowded airport terminal, as Rambo, carrying a cheap flight bag, weaves among jostling Orientals
(
) Your flight to Bangkok is at 06:30
Commercial carrier
Low profile
Rendezvous with Colonel Trautman at the Indra
Room 618
You'll meet your number two man, Lieutenant Brewer
He doesn't get a packet
you brief him verbally
After a flurry of passport stamping Rambo clears customs and makes his way to the main exit
-  - Rambo emerges into the stifling humid heat of Bangkok in May and stands, scanning for a cab
- 51 , Bangkok is a city of fervid motion and the street is chaotic with traffic
Stepping through throngs of Asians and tourists Rambo reaches for the door of a beat-to-hell Citroen taxi hunkered low at the curb like some metal lungfish
He spins as a hand lightly touches his shoulder
Sorry old buddy,  saw it first
An American in his late twenties, the man speaks with one of those hard-to-dislike Southern accents
Probably North Carolina
He is lanky but muscular, with boyish good looks and hair cut so short it barely qualifies as stubble
Though dressed in a loud Hawaiian shirt and Madras slacks, it is painfully obvious the man is military
His arm is draped around a gorgeous but overly made-up Thai girl
(affable) kinda got an important date
Rambo's eyes narrow as he turns wordlessly and climbs into the taxi
The American grins cockily and tosses his bag to Rambo
No problem
We'll share it
Get your tail in there, sweet thing
/ The American and the girl pile into the broad front seat, to the chagrin of the lizard-faced Thai driver
(to driver) Indra Hotel
And don't take the scenic route, Smiley
know my way around this burg
Comprende
Rambo speaks quietly to the driver in Thai
(Thai/subtitled) Same place for me
The girl giggles as the American slips his hand up from her stockinged knee, between her thighs
Ah, you fair flower of the Orient
She giggles, like a chirping bird
(continuing to Rambo) She thinks everything  say is funny
Don't you, Angel-pie
Man, Thai women are the best
Got the kinda legs  like
feet at one end and pussy at the other
He turns to Rambo, who hasn't commented or taken any observable notice of him
(continuing) You don't say a helluva lot, do you, pal
You speak English
(coldly) Sometimes
The girl coos to the American in pidgin English
You got money
stay you whole week
Sweet thing, there's nothin' 'd like more than to wugga-wugga with you for a week, but tonight's all we got
He lowers his voice conspiratorially, leaning close to her
(continuing) See, 'm on this secret mission, and tomorrow mornin'  head out to
Rambo grabs the man brutally by his collar
That's enough, Brewer
The American freezes at the sound of his name
Turns slowly
(realizing) You're Rambo
(pause) Ke-rist
Rambo speaks sharply to the girl in Thai
(Thai/subtitled) Get out
Now
The driver, confused, skids to a stop and the girl gets out into the din of a cluttered shop district
flash of slit skirt and then only fading curses behind them as the taxi moves on
(brightening) Jeez,  never would have guessed
You undercover, Lieutenant
Great disguise
: - Trautman, sipping a gin tonic at the window, spins around as the door flies open
Brewer storms in, followed a few paces back by Rambo, who closes the door
(to Trautman) He says he's team leader on this show
That's correct
(controlling his fury) Begging the Colonel's pardon but understood  was up to lead my next mission
Not this one
You're on communications and camera
Same image-intensified gear you used in El Salvador last year
This clown almost blew mission security on the street
'm not jumping with him
(spinning) Clown
Now back up there, buddy
(sharply) Listen up
You two are married as of now
Get used to it
(to Trautman) say we tape him to a chair
: - - 36 , small airstrip transects a meadow bounded by rain- forested slopes
Wreathed in low clouds the mountains march into the distance in increasingly subtler shades of gray like a Japanese watercolor
Near a cluster of small buildings the scene is one of manic but efficient activity as the high tech base camp is assembled
An enormous  -54 " " lowers a Winnebago- sized conex container as another roars by
An Army Corps of Engineers work crew, stripped to the waist, scurries through the rotor wash
The blasting air raises curtains of muddy spray and drowns out the yelled commands of the supervisors
Vietnam era  -1D  nimbly touches down nearby
Rambo, in the pilot's seat, slips off his and climbs down
Brewer and Trautman, in fatigues, jump out and join him as Kirkhill approaches
as they emerge from the rotor noise and Kirkhill motions them toward the ()
didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo
was crossed-trained in gunships
(to Kirkhill) How long have you been setting up
About 22 hours on site
Nice work
They pass a tent-like   under which an -  -60 ""  squats ominously
It has no markings or insignia
There is another canopy behind it, the contents of which are screened from view
Nearby is a cluster of   , two of which are joined together to form a building like a double-wide mobile home
Another unit contains a roaring generator, a fourth is topped by
Cables snake through the mud, connecting the units
Kirkhill notices    "" kibitzing nearby, taking pictures of each other with a pocket Instamatic
He snatches the camera from a surprised young corporal
This is a covert operation, numbnuts
He opens the camera and drops the film in the mud
The corporal reaches petulantly for the camera
Kirkhill drops it casually in the mud as well
(to Trautman entourage) Check out the command hut
He opens the door to the large conex unit and follows the others inside
The "hut" turns out to be a humming electronic womb
In the subdued light banks of   glow, and the status lights of    line one wall
Workstations for , ,  - create a claustrophobic jumble of modular equipment racks
Mission control
They wipe their muddy feet and enter the air-conditioned command center
Rambo gazes around at the jumble of gear
He runs his hand over one console, causing a seated technician to glare at him
All this is for us
That's right
(to Rambo) They call us the field-unit meat- puppets
: /
- Rambo and Brewer walk in under an expanse of net camouflage on poles
Sunlight streams through the foliage cover, creating bright mottles on a black object
and   as Rambo moves forward to reveal the object as an -
It is a modified Gulfstream "Peregrine," a small sleek single-engine executive model, with all insignia and
numbers removed
as they consider the aircraft
Ever do this from a jet
No
(
) It's easy
They turn to see a lanky long-haired man in a leather flying jacket duck under the fuselage from the far side and approach them
(grinning) Just have to jump fast
Two other air crewmen jump down from the open rear passenger door of the plane
You the pilot
(extending hand) Yeah
Doyle
(he gestures to the two in the door) Lifer and Fuhrman
Doyle is a product of the sixties' school of ultra-cool, his brain a little torched by too many methed-out night- missions
Fuhrman, the co-pilot, grins too much and Lifer's eyes are just plain scary
You boys Air Force
Marines
'Ex' though
We're private contractors now
You ever do a tour 'in-country'
Two
'Eye-corps' mostly
(to Brewer) How about you
(defensive) Vietnam was a little before my time
So was Korea, know what  mean
Rambo and Doyle glance at each other
solidarity before new-meat bozos
as the head of a torque-wrench finishes a rough map of local Southeast Asia, scratched hastily in the dirt
(
) Thailand
The Mekong
Laos
'Nam
With each word he plops the torque-wrench onto the appropriate place
Gesturing as he continues
straight dash across the Laotian panhandle, through the Annamese Mountains
some good dicey bits there
and on to the drop zone
Eighteen minutes each way in communist airspace
We go low to stay off radar
In the rhubarb, babe
(grinning) Mowin' the lawn
Dig it
- Trautman, looking a bit uncomfortable in Kirkhill's electronic lair, paces behind the seated Special Operations Officer
How long before you're fully on line
Couple hours
Let me buy you a coffee
He turns to a vending machine nestled improbably between two racks of electronics
You think they'll find any
(feeding in change) POWs
don't know
But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks
Cream
Black
No sugar
The League of Families leans on Congress
Then they lean on us
Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries
Damnit
He pounds the machine, which refuses to vend
Trautman watches the Special Operations Officer banging ineffectually on the  , amid a million dollars worth of equipment
tent next to the camouflage canopy serves as a flight shack for Doyle and his ground crew
Crates serve as tables and stools, and 50-gallon fuel drums are the back wall
Doyle, with Rambo and Brewer, continues the game plan
couple klicks from insertion we go vertical to ten thousand and you punch out
Navigate in free fall like a regular  jump
You'll have a good moon
(to himself) got your moon right here
No problem
Duck soup
Doyle notices that Brewer has casually lit up a cigarette
Hey, man
we got fuel on the deck
don't like flying without a plane
Brewer glances at the pool of jet fuel around the pumping area
Rambo plucks the cigarette from Brewer's lips
No smoking on this mission
It's not healthy
He looks Brewer in the eye and flicks the lit butt into the pool of gas
Which puts it out
Son of a bitch
Rambo saunters away
(appreciatively) Nice trick
Works nine times out of ten
-  - The steel planking of the pre-fabricated runway rings under their feet as Rambo and Brewer run laps
Brewer, between breaths, is chanting a monologue as they draw near
Again
Insertion
Call in to base camp by Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact
Indigenous agent
Co Phuong Bao
(in same tone) We've been over this three times
You stopped
Brewer rolls his eyes
Co Phuong Bao
The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban
at Ban
Bo Peep
Shit
(flatly) Start over
- Face-down in the dirt near the flight-line, Rambo and Brewer are banging off pushups under the floodlight
(mechanically) to target at Ban Kia Na
We probe the site
(to himself overlapping) Ninety
then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta
Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo swear to Christ
One hundred
They both collapse, face-down, breathing heavily
Brewer rises first
Gettin' old, huh
Yeah
(pause) Second set
Let's go
When Rambo rises it is in pushup position, only this time using one arm
He starts
One, two, three

It looks like a large field radio with a complex console set in the top
Transponder-satellite relay
He taps a small collapsible   on a tripod connected to the box by a curly-cord
(continuing) The signal's coded into infrared pulses, picked up by the spy satellite, bounced to the ground station in Okinawa and relayed to the hut
He points to the  nearby
(continuing) No radio source
Nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on
Show me how it operates
That's what 'm here for
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land
(frustrated) We're leaving tonight, not in a week
He sees Rambo's expression
Alright
Alright

With surgical precision he hones the trigger mechanism of a -
Rambo raises the crossbow, cocked but empty
It fires smoothly, to his satisfaction
- as a crossbar pries the lid off
as he raises a telescope-like piece of equipment
revealing Brewer surrounded by shipping crates
He sets the scope on a long empty table and attacks another crate, working under a harsh fluorescent lighting unit
- Brewer pulls electronic test gear out of bubble-pack and sets the units on the table
He hefts an automatic rifle and checks the action
Another electronic gadget joins the growing array on the table
Another, smaller automatic, a -10  , is lifted out of packing

The effect is unearthly
Brewer, wearing headphones, is running a calibration tone through the audio-processor of his

Using a candle he expertly darkens the blade of his Lile- knife
Brewer is standing at the end of the long table which is now laid out like a banquet with an incredible assortment of gadgets, weapons, supplies, kits, canteens, rations, etc
Doyle lounges nearby watching the bugs dog-fighting around the fluorescent work light

) You jumping with all that
They turn to see Rambo watching them from just outside the pool of light
spectral figure
Brewer glances at the array of stuff
Yeah
Why not
You break your leg, 'll have to shoot you
He turns and vanishes in the dark

Crazy fucker
Well, son
You got that right
Anybody ever tell you about that guy
Brewer turns quizzically toward him
What about him

Keep it clean, Rambo, or 'll nail your hide to the shed

Trautman exits and the steps are rolled away
Doyle is all business now
Zen Rollercoaster, requesting clearance

The wheel jacks are pulled
The jet rolls forward
The aircraft hurtles down the runway, gathering speed

Brewer watches the forest below through the open doorway
The door itself has been removed

Rambo, sitting impassively, removes his blindfold
The plane begins to pitch and plummet wildly
Brewer lets out a rebel yell
Whoo-ya

It slithers between the mountainous flanks
Rambo is methodically checking his pack and harness, seemingly oblivious to the insanity outside

The jet has gone into a ball-busting vertical climb and is instantly lost among the stars

Doyle's voice is matter-of-fact despite the gees they are pulling
Approaching ten thousand
Eleven seconds to insertion
Ten, nine
Slowing to two-thirty
The ready light changes from red to yellow
Rambo unbuckles from his seat
Rises
Brewer follows
Lifer steadies them at the door

Have a nice day
The ready-light turns
Go
Rambo takes a single, powerful running stride from the opposite wall and is out the door
Gone
Brewer is right behind him
The jet dwindles and is gone in a moment above the tumbling figures
stabilizing his fall
He switches on his pack strobe
(shouting into mike) You read me, Brewer
(
) (faint) Read you
Home on my strobe
diving skillfully
He sees the distant flash of Rambo's strobe below him and banks toward it like a fighter plane
He comes alongside the Team Leader and they dive together
Rambo cuts the strobe
as a solid layer of cloud rushes up
They plunge through and the landscape below is an awesome vista
An unbroken carpet of dark rain forest with a narrow, meandering river, like a platinum ribbon
Rambo sights on a distant bend in the river, spreads his feet and dives

and up
mahogany tree lunges like a huge hand
The dark maw swallows us in blackness
Moonlight filters down through the foliage of massive trees, showing as shafts in the swirling night mists
This is one of the most primeval forests on the planet, a place of violent growth and death-filled shadows
Massive tree roots grip the earth, entwined with vines that climb swaying into the vaulted canopy above
Water drips constantly
And life is everywhere
Furtive
Timeless
Churning in the shallow pools, under the bark, in the sweating fruit
leaping through the matted foliage above

Rambo removes his goggles and headset, then shrugs out of his chute harness
He looks around slowly
Taking it in
(to himself) Man, what are you doing back here
Brewer's voice is a reedy chirp from his headset
He raises it to his ear
You okay
(
) Keep it down, man
got problems
: - Brewer is face-to-face with a mangy , which grunts its annoyance
He is stuck up to his knees in the mud of a small fenced yard containing a few pigs and chickens
The yard is adjacent to a large  , and four or five additional  are visible farther downslope, nestled among the trees
Brewer holds a finger to his lips, cautioning the pig to silence
He lays backward in the black slop as a in peasant pajamas comes to the door of the nearest hootch, an island of light in the dark forest
Smoking a cigarette he looks around, perhaps scanning for the source of the faint crashing he heard a moment before
Following a dirt road, little more than a trail between the hootches, an   approaches
She is barefoot, and pushes a rusting bicycle laden with an enormous bundle of firewood
Brewer struggles to free himself, straining in silence as the pigs step disdainfully around him
The man flicks away the cigarette
He laughs raucously at something the old woman says and hurries to help her carry the firewood inside
Brewer looks up, at his chute billowing quietly in the branches overhead
The old woman pauses at the door, spits a shot of betelnut juice into the yard, and goes inside
The door bangs shut
sighing with relief
, seizing him
Brewer's head snaps around
The object is Rambo's hand, painted camo-green
Rambo drags him with a sucking  from the mud
The Team Leader glares
(a freezing whisper) That's one
Brewer pauses a moment, assimilating the implicit warning
Then reaches for his harness buckles to free himself
: - With the hootches visible
, Rambo moves silently off along the trail
Brewer, lumbering under the enormous pack,  through foliage to catch up
He curses under his breath
Rambo moves wraith-like through the undergrowth, appearing and vanishing, there
then not there
Brewer stumbles over a root,  to the ground
Rambo stops, looking back
His expression grim
He turns and moves on, disappearing into the foliage
Brewer scrambles up, following
- as the last letters of the following message appear: /  / / revealing Brewer hunched over the tiny  screen atop the transponder box, typing at a keyboard the size of a pocket calculator
Rambo squats motionless, watching intently
Brewer hits the "" button
: The chief telecom tech turns to Kirkhill
It's coming in
Kirkhill watches the message print out on the main screen
Turns to Trautman
They're in
On the money
cheer goes up in the command center
The home team just scored
- Rambo squats, studying his
He glances at Brewer who has finished assembling his weapons and gear
looking like a Martian stormtrooper with his exotic weapons and surplus equipment
He is sighting through the scope of his assault rifle
Fully assembled it is as big as a Chrysler and looks straight out of Star Wars
What do you call that
(crisply) Modified -16 A2 and over-under -79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and /-100 Laser sighting system
Batteries not included
(wounded) This is state-of-the-art firepower
Rambo picks up another device, a cylinder like a flashlight with a curly-cord running to a pair of earphones
What's this
-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor
Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters
Rambo gazes around him
Cocktail party
Uh huh, right
(pause) Let's saddle up
Where's your stuff
Rambo flips open his rucksack
(incredulous) That's it
Some -4, a map and a knife
There's a compass in the handle
Brewer gestures at the Russian-made -47 slung over Rambo's shoulder
And a beat-to-shit
Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those
Exactly
Brewer hefts the separate rucksack containing the
Uh
this thing's pretty heavy
You got room for it
Rambo snorts disgustedly
Just a thought
Using a stream bed to navigate through dense growth, Rambo glides his legs smoothly through knee-deep brackish water
Brewer follows, swatting and batting at clouds of mosquitos
glides past them, roiling the surface, and disappears into twisted tree roots
You wanna know why  stood up for this show
(moving off) No
was in the brig
They gave me a deal
blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an -19
He wasn't in it or anything
it was the symbolic value
Seemed like a good idea at the time
That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam
've seen worse places
There are no worse places
- Rambo leads them up a steep trail as a dense creeps over the ridgeline above
- as he moves along a narrow game trail
Shapes loom out of the mist, revealed as harmless trunks or vines only at the last second
As they top the rise, the trail opens out onto a plateau- like cleared area
Ahead, an   , wreathed in vines, looms from the mist
as the two walk into the atrium of a  "", or Brewer looks awed
Serene despite the ravages of centuries, two stone Buddhas thirty feet tall sit flanking the stairs to the ruined temple
Trees and vines all but obscure the cracked and tumbled forms of ornately carved walls
The central courtyard is open to the sky
Spire-like structures are dimly visible in the fog beyond
(hushed) This place is a trip
Buddhist monastery
Fifteenth century
Damn
Leeches
He has pulled up his pant-leg to reveal attached to his calf, sucking on him
Rambo moves off, scanning, unconcerned
Get used to 'em
lighting a cigarette, his hands tightly cupped around the glow
Rambo slaps it out of his hand
Stomps it out
(hissing) You fucking crazy
need it to burn these things off
No cigarettes
had it cupped
Rambo takes the pack from Brewer's breast pocket and grinds it into the mud under his boot
Look, Rambo
've had enough of your bad-ass Indian-scout bullshit
You're years out of date
'm makin' a career out of teaching you the hardware
As far as 'm concerned you're just along to back me up
And  heard about you
about how twitchy you really are
Kill any civilians lately
Brewer is hurled against a stone wall and pinned with a knife to his throat so rapidly he's not sure how it happened
Rambo is in his face, speaking very softly
Listen real careful, freshmeat don't know why they sent you
Maybe they didn't want to waste a good man
But you screw up once more and 'll kill you myself
Rambo whips away, moves quietly off
Shaking with rage, Brewer levels his weapon at Rambo's back
Then he realizes how silly that would be
Frustrated, he jogs to catch up
Man, are you strict
Moving in the shadows, Rambo walks through the ruins noiselessly
voice emerges from the mist behind them, an almost childlike lilt
(
) You are first tourist here in long time
Brewer whips around, centering the   of his sighting laser on a  sitting on a ledge above them
Sitting cross-legged and unperturbed is a diminutive of about 28
The dot of Brewer's laser is centered on her forehead like a Hindu prayer mark
She is absolutely beautiful, with wide, calm eyes and strong but sensuous mouth which curves now in a small quirky grin
You come here see Buddha
ask for truth
Or just lost
(whispering) Should  waste her
Rambo pushes his rifle barrel aside and takes a step forward
When he speaks it is in
(Viet/subtitled) 'm not lost
Just looking for someone
(Viet/subtitled) Someone called maybe 'Night Orchid'
(Viet/subtitled) That's right
(Viet/subtitled) 'm Co Phuong Bao
(to Brewer) She's our contact
(grudgingly impressed) didn't know you spoke Vietnamese
Co slides down from the ledge and stands before them, almost two heads shorter than Rambo
Her lithe figure is not entirely concealed by her loose black "pajamas"
She wears her hair in a long single braid and has the delicate hands of a child
'm Rambo
This is Brewer
(to Brewer) Her name is Co
It means "virgin
"  My mother was comedian
Howdy, Co
He sticks out his hand but Rambo motions "no"
She bows slightly
Uh, you speak pretty good English
Where'd you learn
University of Saigon
Have Masters Degree in economics
Not use too much now
Communists in charge
You got time
want to eat
Sure
Whattaya got
Co reaches up onto the ledge, her previous perch, and pulls down a small , actually a   of the sort worn over one shoulder by Viet Cong and other Vietnamese guerrillas
(opening it) Nuac mam
She unrolls several rubber tree leaves holding rice with a pungent sauce
Rambo takes the food and the proffered and, squatting, begins shoveling it expertly
You really got a Masters Degree
Sure
only sound like forty-year- old in your language
Brewer fumbles with the sticks
Switches to fingers
What's this stuff on the rice
Fermented fish sauce
Brewer's expression is less than enthusiastic
: -   - With Co leading through the maze of aimless game trails the group makes its way parallel to a modest , How do we get upriver
have arranged transportation
We meet soon
But  think you to be disappointed
Why's that
go up to this camp two months ago
Nobody there
Empty for years
Rambo stops, puzzled
Why would they send us to a deserted camp
Who cares
Let's just do it and get out
Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok
Know what  mean
Rambo moves on, still concerned
something's a bit off
We'll check it out
How come we didn't just drop near the camp
save this hassle
Brewer
Does a jet make noise
Yeah
(switching to Viet subtitled) Where did you find this clown
(Viet/subtitled) thought he was with you
(Viet/subtitled) Crazy motherfucker
What's she saying
She likes you
Says you're dinky- dau
What's that
Powerful warrior
Yeah
Dinky-dau, that's me
Hey, Co
You wanna meet Jake the one- eyed snake
Rambo motions suddenly for a "freeze"
Co walks on ahead, toward the river, as the Americans melt into the shadows
- - wallows among the naked tree roots in a brackish inlet off the main river
On deck are  , loosely speaking
Possibly two of the most misbegotten specimens the Orient has to offer
They raise their -47s as Co approaches
Exchange a few quick syllables and Co turns, motioning Rambo and Brewer forward
As they pass, two more equally unwholesome-looking men emerge from concealment and follow them to the sampan
Everybody grips their weapons tightly
(under his breath) These guys look like they'd sell their mothers
Sometimes they do
They're river pirates
Opium runners
(hissing) Pirates
No kidding
Before they step across onto the sampan, Co introduces the "captain" in Vietnamese
Wearing all manner of jewelry, including four wristwatches and a pair of filthy western-style jeans a size too large, grins and motions them aboard
The grin reveals bare gum where his upper front teeth would be
Obviously broken out in a fight
Wa-ky number one
You come number one sampan
(Viet/subtitled) Thank you, Captain, for your hospitality
You speak English very well
Grinning wider, Captain Kinh motions them inside the , a rambling and dilapidated structure of corrugated sheet metal and woven bamboo
Kinh barks orders at his men, who cast off from their moorings and jump aboard
The first light of dawn is breaking through the trees
raisin-faced  in an ao-dai, holding an infant, shuffles aside as Rambo steps down into the dim smoky interior
Brewer, Co and Kinh follow
The two Americans must stoop in the scaled-down structure
Every conceivable space is crammed with scavenged or looted detritus: ammo cases, hubcaps, radios, a  with no back, books, dead chickens, an ice-cube tray, a Toyota bumper, outboard motors
there is no operant logic to most of it
Looks like my room in college
We sleep here today
Safe here while go up river
What about patrol boats
Kinh opens a greasy wooden locker, takes out his pride and joy, a Russian-made -7 -
His grin glistens evilly in the gloom
: - beautiful sunrise backs the treeline, stretching long shadows across the quiet camp
' The interior resembles that of a motor home, complete with bunks, kitchenette and a small bar
Kirkhill is on the phone, pacing
agitated
His reptilian aide lounges on a bunk
(to phone) No, sir
we're already committed
They're in the jungle right now say we play the hand through
if they find something we just bury the report later
It's still airtight
(pause) Yes, sir
He hangs up
Runs a hand through his hair
(to aide) Goddamn it
Now the goddamn satellite shows the camp occupied
some trucks or something
(grimly) Oh, boy
It's getting dicey
Their manner becomes guarded when a  at the door interrupts them
The aide unlocks it and admits Trautman
What's up
Listen, Kirkhill
'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here thought 'd go out with the extraction team tonight
Unless you have an objection
(not liking it) It's not necessary
know
That's a pretty hairy ride
Full Colonels are supposed to be above that sort of thing
Trautman is calling him on it with a deadpan response
know
(shrugs expansively) Have fun
- Kinh's hideous sampan churns upriver slowly, powered by an ancient outboard motor
It passes other river traffic, small hand-powered sampans manned by figures in broad conical coolie hats
With the exception of a rare powered craft, the scene is that of a Vietnam unchanged by centuries
The ebb and flow of regimes and ideologies has little altered the basics of life here
Rambo watches through a chink in the sheeting of the cabin as the timeless landscape rolls past
' view of the shoreline as brown children splash naked in the shallows where a row of hootches marches up the hill on stilts
The  and  come clearly across the water
Rambo turns his gaze to the sampan interior
Two of Kinh's men, Co and Brewer all sleep soundly
Rambo watches Co, her face serene in sleep
Childlike
Beautiful
: - The water is coppery, silhouetting the sampan as it churns on
Kinh's wife squats on the foredeck, smoking a long-stemmed clay pipe
: /
- The walnut-faced woman hands Rambo two bowls of nuoc mam
He passes one to Brewer
Have some armpit sauce
Brewer groans
Opens a -ration can
(to Co) How did you get started working for the spooks
Spooks
Intelligence work
Oh
They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon
Make deal
Everybody's makin' deals
My brother captain in
need papers to go United States, or North Vietnamese will execute
They make deal
stay here and do work
my brother and my son can go United States
Your son
Co's eyes drop and her whole demeaner deflates slightly
Nguyen
He twelve now
Not see him for eight years
Where's his father
Co shrugs
Dead
Killed in war
Her voice and expression convey the fatalistic acceptance of one who has seen death in all its forms
Expects it as an element of daily life
Where's Nguyen now
What city
(noting his concern) Huntington Beach, California
It's nice there
He's probably digging every minute
Got a surfboard
Breaking girls' hearts
(distractedly) Nguyen is good boy
Co gazes at the sunset beyond the door
tear runs down her cheek
She catches herself
Wipes it away almost brutally
She abruptly goes on deck
Some hardened guerrilla fighter they gave us
Rambo freezes him out with an evil look
Suddenly there is a commotion on deck
The roar of a powerful
Co bursts in a moment later
River patrol
roars toward them, silhouetted by the setting sun
on deck bring twin 50- caliber machine guns to bear
Rambo and Brewer dive under filthy bunks
Lock and load their weapons
Co pushes junk in over them
Kinh rips open the cabinet
Slams the shaft of a rocket grenade into the launch tube
Co barks an order at him
He hesitates
Lowers the weapon
Co removes a small packet of North Vietnamese bills from inside her blouse and hands it to Kinh
The patrol boat pulls up in an arc, almost swamping them
The soldiers on deck wear the uniforms of the North Vietnamese navy
The deck gunner racks the bolt on his
The captain shouts   on a loud hailer
Kinh's men lounge on the sampan indolently, looking like fishermen on an evening trawl
The scrawny woman feeds an infant at one sagging breast
The   draws his service pistol and jumps down into the sampan, entering the cabin
Co sits demurely on one bunk as Kinh greets the officer
The officer begins poking through Kinh's possessions
He tugs at the crate under the bunk where Rambo lies concealed
absolutely motionless
The crate beside his head moves
The officer's boot is visible through a widening crack
An    is heard heating up
grips the -11 tightly, releases, grips, releases
Sweat runs into his eyes
looks severe as he contemptuously thumbs through a sheaf of bills
Kinh, gesticulating pathetically adds some more to the stack
After a tense moment the officer kicks the crate next to Rambo and stalks out, tucking the payola in his tunic
He jumps off the sampan and the patrol boat  on
Rambo and Brewer allow themselves to exhale
How you doing, Brewer
(shaken) need a vacation
-   - With Co leading, Rambo and Brewer move furtively along a tortuous trail
It has rained recently and the forest is alive with glistening reflections, dripping water
The trail winds up a steep embankment
As they reach the top of the rise,    over the shoulder of the embankment to reveal a beyond, dark except for moonlight
watches from concealment in the foliage
He is invisible with his camo-makeup except for darting eyes
' looking between the leaves, scanning the prison camp
Two shabby    stand at diagonally opposite corners of the compound
There is a simple fence of barbed wire on wooden posts enclosing the area and a main gate with a sentry box
form a , filling most of the compound
The place seems deserted
Check the tower with your scope
Brewer raises the rifle, sighting through the massive starlight scope
'  - The image is bright, lurid
black and white with a greenish cast
Like contrasty daylight
He pans up the tower
Russian-made
7
62mm machine gun sits pointing skyward
The tower seems unoccupied
Nobody home
Wait a minute
Cigarette
brief glow of light illuminates the face of a hidden in shadows
What's he here for
Nearby, another  saunters out of the forest dressed in  regular private's uniform with the sleeves rolled up casually
His -47 is slung over his shoulder
slips the telescopic microphone out of his rucksack and clamps it to the side of his scope
He slips on a pair of small earphones and pans the rifle- scope-mike over the nearest barracks unit
(intently) Snoring
Five, six guys
Mumbling
Vietnamese
Somebody talking in his sleep
toilet flushing
Guard barracks
Take some shots
Brewer locks a 35mm  camera to an adapter on the starlight scope
He starts clicking off some shots
Brewer then scans the long hut across the compound
Breathing
Moaning
(suddenly) Shit
He whips off the earphones in pain as a   echoes across the camp
It fades into a delirious moaning
Stops
(nodding grimly) Bad dreams
Prisoner's barracks
Shoot some
Brewer clicks away
draws their attention to the main gate where a   on a   pulls up to the sentry shack
Brewer zeros on her as she greets the
Cyclo-girl whore from village
Business slow there
Rambo takes the earphones, listening to the girl's distant chattering
She's making him a pretty good deal
Apparently the guard agrees because he opens the gate and the girl slips inside
What's that
By the far tower
Brewer pans to the distant shape
It's a guy in a cage
American
Can't tell
Pretty tall
He's real scrunched up in that thing
Let me see
' The image is of an   slumped in a bamboo cage
The man's skin is ghostly white
He seems almost a living skeleton, dressed only in ragged shorts
His wrists are clamped in a wooden  and blood runs down his arms from the abraded sores
,
Though gaunt and filthy, he is clearly
Roundeye
Alright
Home run
(angrily) Torture cage
Can't stand
can't sit
for days
Sometimes weeks
Bastards
Let's get some shots
as he hands the kluge back to Brewer
That guy's not going to make it
(
) Nothing we can do, man
Rambo decides in that moment
'm getting him out
What
Are you crazy
We're supposed to take pictures and split
You're gonna blow the whole program
You never been in one of those things
suppose you have
Rambo holds his wrists up, right under Brewer's nose
showing the chafing scars
It's orders
You remember
when they tell you to do something and then you do it
John Wayne is dead, man
(rising) You take pictures and split
'm going in
Brewer throws down his rifle
He's apoplectic
He can barely form words
Fuck it
Fuck it
Aw
ke-rist
Then a slow grin spreads
How we gonna do it
: - as he belly crawls to the edge of the cleared area, just a few yards from the wire
He is right under one tower, hidden among ferns
' as Rambo's silhouette crosses to the wire farther down
at ground level as he crawls under the wire and undulates from shadow to shadow
He reaches the nearest building
Hugs it
Rambo moves on in silence
He is barefoot, the pale skin smeared with mud, and carries only the
Without rifle, pack, harness or grenades to clatter, he moves like a spirit in the material world
Rambo raises one eye slowly over a window ledge
Inside several guards sleep soundly under mosquito netting
Their rifles are stacked against the far wall
snoring ludicrously loud
He bats at a mosquito, grunts
turns over
with Rambo as he crawls among the support posts
He freezes as a light is snapped on above him
It streams down through cracks between floorboards
Moving very slowly, Rambo squints through a gap
' on a   rummaging in a tiny prehistoric refrigerator, humming to himself
He takes out a can of , recognizable, although the label is in Chinese characters
Rolls it slowly across his sweaty forehead
Pops it
The foam now runs onto the floor, drips into Rambo's eyes
The light snaps off
Rambo moves on
' There are two rows of rusted iron bunks set out like a hospital ward
Most of them are empty
Seven aren't
Like the man in the cage they are gaunt, scabrous
Dressed in ragged peasant clothes too small for them
One man, bathed in sweat, moans and tosses with malarial fever
Another is wrapped so tightly in a fetal position his face is between his knees
They have padded the bare springs of their cots with mattresses of rubber leaves
Rambo stands a few feet from them as if giving a benediction, the crossbow raised in one hand
He moves on, leaving no trace
The  reclines in a folding chair, nodding to the beat of unheard music
is clipped on his belt and he has the earphones over his
He takes a last drag and tosses a cigarette over the parapet
- hugging the ground as the smoldering butt lands five feet from him
in the pool of light from a floodlight
He groans, watching the smoke curl up
Starts creeping his hand toward the butt
- The man inside opens his eyes when Rambo touches his broomstick neck, feeling for a pulse
His lips are parched and there is a horrible bruise around one eye
(barely audible) Who're you
American
Come to get you out
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker
Can you walk
could a couple of days ago
Gonna be
stiff
Rambo quickly picks the lock on the wrist clamps and then slips his   from its sheath
Starts cutting the lashings on the bamboo cage
What's your name
De Fravio
Dave De Fravio
Lieutenant
Air Force
The door gives way and Rambo steadies De Fravio as he slumps forward
(shakes his hand) Good to meet you, Dave
'm Rambo
Okay, 'm going to carry you
Don't cough or make any noise
Sure thing, Rambo
You gettin' the other guys, too
Not this time
We'll be back
Rambo slings De Fravio's gaunt six-foot frame over his shoulder in a fireman's carry and heads off in a crouching run
crossing a pool of light
as the sentry lounges in his shack
- Brewer seems to have lost sight of Rambo
He scans the camp to the treeline and back
The filterless cigarette is smoked almost to his lips
on his rifle, pinning one hand
He looks up at
who holds an -47 in Brewer's face
With his headphones on Brewer hadn't heard the quiet approach from behind
Brewer closes his eyes in profound misery
There is a soft
Brewer opens his eyes as the -47 falls into the grass
Looks up to see
The guard is leaning back against a tree, motionless
The   of a   protrudes from his neck under the jaw
He is pinned to the tree, quite dead
Rambo appears from the undergrowth, still carrying De Fravio, crossbow in hand
(to Brewer) That's two
Brewer and Rambo, carrying the , rejoin Co on the ridge, where they had left their gear
Rambo sets De Fravio down and reaches for his boots
The  looks dazedly at his rescuers
His eyes, in hollow sockets, track from one to the other
(weakly) You guys are real
aren't you
Huh
Sorry,  mean
talk to people all the time
know a lot of them aren't there
But this is real, isn't it
You're taking me home now
That's right, buddy
De Fravio sits frozen for a moment, then a dry sob wracks his entire body and he puts his arms around Brewer
He cries with utter abandon, quietly, while Brewer looks at him helplessly
Thank God
thank you
Brewer looks at Rambo with a stricken expression
Then puts his arms clumsily around De Fravio, like somebody holding a baby for the first time
Co touches Rambo's hand
Motions "let's go" with a cock of her head
He nods
: -    - stocky     stands over the partially concealed body of the guard Rambo killed
He raises his whistle and sends a   across the camp
Lights come on in the guard barracks
: -   - The sampan waits beyond a screen of trees as Brewer calls in on the
Co is helping De Fravio walk unsteadily down to the boat,
The river bandits eye the tall, death-like figure suspiciously
We'd better go for the emergency at point Zulu Sierra
Tell them we've got some heat but don't mention De Fravio
Brewer starts typing
: - Doyle's ground crew is removing the camouflage canopy from the -60 "Blackhawk" helicopter
The turbines are warming up with an
Doyle and Trautman,
, turn as the door to the command trailer bursts open and a  runs out
You're go for extraction
Mr
Kirkhill says wind 'er up
Here's the hardcopy
Trautman takes the printout
(to Doyle) Alternate  Zulu Sierra at 0500
It says "May have heat
Don't be late
All our love
" (scowling at his watch) Let's get that tent down
: -   - De Fravio seems a little more in focus as he sits huddled with the others in the cramped cabin
gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did
They move us around a lot
We only been at that camp a week
Got a smoke
(pointedly) No
What kind of raggedy-ass rescue you call this
Why were you in the box
Well,  caught this cobra, see
You mean the snake
Yeah
It's not hard once you get the hang of it
In the wrist
Anyway,  did what  always do when get one
What's that
(straight-faced) Put it in the guard's barracks
(pause) Man they got pissed
They beat the crap out of me, but
it's kind of a tradition
You oughta see 'em run around
(chuckling) You got a bad attitude
De Fravio grins, showing bad teeth as well
know it
De Fravio eyes Co as she hands him a plate of rice and meat
Thanks lady
You're pretty cute
doing anything this weekend
(smiling) Eat slowly
Don't make yourself sick
She exits with the dirty cooking utensils
When Co closes the door to the cabin, Kinh sidles up to her and rapidly whispers something in Vietnamese
He seems to be eliciting a response and eyes her warily
Co freezes indecisively, then nods yes
In the stern,
, one of Kinh's men is talking quietly on a beat-up military-style
His voice is masked by the sound of the outboard motor
Co whispers something and holds out her hand, palm up
Kinh grins, gaptoothed
He pulls a
45  from his belt and slips it to her
Runs his finger along the curve of her neck
She quietly pulls the cocking slide, chambering a round
- The sampan glides into the brackish estuary amid half- submerged trees
It is the original rendezvous point
Everyone assembles on deck, with Rambo helping De Fravio through the cabin door
Brewer checks his watch
Twenty-five minutes
We'd better roll
Rambo freezes
looks down
An -47 muzzle is pressed into his kidney, held by one of Kinh's men
Two more are covering Brewer, who had just handed his rifle to Co, while donning his pack
Kinh steps up, grinning
Takes Rambo's rifle
fourth guard eases an arm around his neck, a long knife held under his jawline
It has all happened smoothly and with precision planning
Wa-ky number ten
Do-ma
Yeah, fuck your mama-san, too
In the
Kinh backhands him to the deck
his eyes cold, looking at Co
She advances on him
Her black almond-shaped eyes glitter, alien as the depths of space
She spits in his face
Kinh snorts a feral laugh
Rambo doesn't react
Her eyes dart to the side
something, a microsecond flash of understanding, passes between them
(enraged beyond belief) You slope bitch
She whirls on him, drawing the
45
It is enormous in her child's hand
Her expression is terrifying
The renegade behind Brewer  , his Rambo moves, slapping his guard's elbow, driving the knife across and away
His teeth snap shut on the man's forearm
The knife falls
Rambo's hands are simultaneously seizing the other guard's -47 just as he fires
Rambo holds his hand on the man's trigger hand,
on the third man standing opposite them
, his rifle   harmlessly into the sky
Co places the muzzle of the
45 against Kinh's temple
His grin is long gone
Rambo drives the butt of the second man's -47 into his stomach twice
The bandit lets go
Firing blind over his shoulder, Rambo vaporizes the head of his guard, whose hand he still grips viciously in his teeth
He releases the hand
Almost like spitting out the dead man
Clutching his stomach, the last bandit leaps to the shore
'  -11 stutter quietly into him
He pitches face-down in the mud
cloud of blue cordite smoke disappears in silence
The whole thing lasted four seconds
(slowly) Wow
What just happened
Rambo moves over to Co
She seems to sag, depleted
In shock
He takes the
45 from her limp fingers
(Viet/subtitled) Are you okay
(answering in English) Yes
But  lose many merits in next life
Very bad
Why'd they want us
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio
Make deal
More than we pay
They sold us out
Now 'm pissed
They were fools
To think there would be reward
And to ask my help
Rambo puts his hands on her shoulders
Thanks
Rambo
coming
Pig dog Kinh say meet them here
Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out
(nodding grimly) Let's go
: -  - At treetop level the all-black -60  down a forested valley at 180 mph, using no illumination but the moon
as it rises and drops with the terrain
-60 Once again Doyle is night-flying in a blacked-out cockpit, putting the landing skids through the treetops
Trautman stands behind the seats in the main bay
Night air  in the open door and Lifer, on door gun, dangles his legs in the windstream
The rain forest is a dim blur very close below
(shouting) Back in Indian country
Just like old times
He racks the bolt on his -60 and grins
Trautman nods politely and looks at his watch
: -   - - Rambo's group circles the ruins as they head for the landing zone
The trail skirts an escarpment which drops over a hundred feet to the Ca River below
Not far from the overgrown spires of the Wat is a stream which breaks over the cliff in a graceful waterfall dropping unimpeded into a lagoon
The vista is quite stunning in the moonlight
Brewer is struggling with both packs plus the heavy Transat, since Rambo has De Fravio and Co has her own pack
Brewer scrambles, slipping back on the steep trail
Let's ditch this Transat
We don't need it
Rambo considers for a moment, then pulls away some underbrush beside a collapsed wall of the ruin
Bury it here
Work fast
Brewer gets out his entrenching tool
cold pre-dawn light suffuses the rain forest, giving it an expectant quality
Rambo scans the ridgeline with Brewer's scope
'  - Figures of      can be seen threading among the trees

Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing
My orders stay here

Rambo touches her shoulder
She turns
See you in California
Her grin is ironic
Land of big
Maybe  take you for a ride in my Cadillac
Rambo watches her go

Roger, Slam Dunk One
what is your position
-   - Rambo is crouched with Brewer and De Fravio in a hollow beside an earth dike
They are taking    from the trees nearby
Spurts of earth leap up around them
Rambo is shouting in a controlled articulate voice into a small -90   while Brewer lays down with his -16 A2
(yelling) Zen Hammer
the heat's on
We're taking fire
Watch for my smoke
Red and green
Northwest corner of a big paddy
(to Brewer) Let's move
Rambo and Brewer, carrying De Fravio, charge up and over the dike as the ground is ripped around them
Rambo hurls two   down the dike wall
Columns of red and green smoke begin roiling upward
The dike on which they are pinned down forms part of the enclosure for a complex of terraced   which occupy the few flat acres of this hilly terrain
The flooded fields reflect the pre-dawn sky like plates of burnished metal
Rambo slams in another clip and fires in short, controlled burst
Brewer hands a captured -47 to De Fravio
The ex- opens up with a vengeance
Go for it, man
Good therapy

Mortars are set up
Roughly aimed

Brewer picks up the -90 mike

The paddies rush by below in a blur
Roger

We are coming in
How many are you

We got an American  with us
Relay to command
They have one of ours

Kirkhill

Zen Hammer reports the ground team has an American  with them
Kirkhill's reaction is unexpected
He whips around
What did you say

-60 Fuhrman can't believe it
Say again, Coach One
He presses the helmet-headphone tight to his ear, then turns to Trautman, cupping his hand over the mike
(to Trautman) He wants us to abort before pick-up
Confirm it
It is confirmed

Doyle looks at both of them and shrugs
Turnin' around

But they ain't payin' the rent, Jack
Stay on your heading, Captain
Sorry, Sir
Can't do it
That's an order
(implacable) Sorry, Sir
Trautman has his hand on the butt of his
45 when he hears the clack of a rifle bolt over the rotor noise and turns
Lifer has an -16 in his lap, not exactly aimed at the colonel, but not aimed away, either
(smirking) We ain't Uncle Sam's misguided children no more, Colonel
We're independent contractors
That's right, Sir
We don't like this, but we are working for Mr
Kirkhill
You pathetic scum
(looking down) Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now
Rambo half-supports De Fravio with one arm and fires his with the other as they slog through the calf-deep water
Mortar rounds explode on all sides
They watch the -60 skimming in low across the paddies, blasting up a curtain of spray
Almost to them
It veers in a tight bank and climbs out
Heads away
Where's he going
(to radio) Hey, Zen Hammer, where are you going
(pause) Do you read, Zen Hammer
Over
Son of a bitch
They're ditching us
The water is shot into spray around them
mortar shell lands so close it knocks them down, drenching them with slimy black mud
The radio disappears in the water
Rising, Brewer takes a round in the thigh
Drops
Disappears for a second
comes up gasping
Rambo watches the -60 diminishing to a black dot
He is so consumed with rage that his expression goes slack
blank
a murderous disconnection from conscience
And yet, in that same moment, a tremendous surge of blind will clears his mind, a determination to survive, to get out at whatever cost
to find whoever did this
It is no longer just a mission
It is a very personal piece of business
He turns and lets his rifle drop into the water
He takes De Fravio's and throws it away
(through gritted teeth) The fuckers left us, man
they left us
Brewer wallows weakly, his blood streaming out into the muddy water
De Fravio looks stunned, lost
eviscerated
He sags to his knees
Oh
God
It gets quiet
In a ragged line, the  soldiers advance to the top of the dike

: ' Kirkhill is pouring scotch over ice in two glasses as the door behind him bangs open
Trautman's expression could slice a steak
Have a drink
Kirkhill offers a glass to Trautman who ignores it
Why
Kirkhill sets the glass down and sits at the dinette, motioning Trautman to sit as well
(shrugs) You got five hours
'll tell you about Secretaries of State, and funding committees and diplomatic relations
Trautman slowly sits opposite him, his demeanor becoming more reasonable
Take your time
Look, Colonel
we're all adults here
This is a war
very quiet, very intense war
People get sacrificed
Not my people
Kirkhill freezes, glancing down
The muzzle of Trautman's service
45 is jammed into his groin
(continuing) But you're right
some people do get sacrificed
Now tell me why you pulled the plug
You think 'm some whacko
like to hurt people
'm doing a job here
If  knew what's right or wrong 'd be a goddamned priest, right
So  follow directives do what 'm told
It's simple
If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem
Don't dance me, Kirkhill
You'll be walking funny
Trautman leans on the
45 a bit and Kirkhill backs into the seat cushion
Look, it was a screw-up, alright
They weren't supposed to find anything
We thought that camp was empty
This mission was a scam from the word go
Word came down
they wanted an answer
And they knew the answer they wanted: no POWs
But it had to look good
Best effort
The whole dog-and-pony show
Kirkhill takes a healthy pull from his scotch
(realizing) Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs
It was clean
Very clean
Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former  himself
if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it
He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own
If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and
Airtight
But no
Rambo's gotta be a hero
Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something
He put me in a corner
No choice
"Terminate with extreme prejudice
" That's a crock
We don't say that
Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy
If it went public
The White House would have to act through channels
We're talking ransom
Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back
That's billion, Colonel
With a ""
For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years
pain in the ass to everybody
No way
There's no way
The colonel has let the pistol drop, until it is dangling, forgotten
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team
Of course not
You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran
After a long silence, Trautman nods
understand
Kirkhill relaxes
It's going to be okay
The colonel is one of the boys
Here
Drink
Trautman doesn't take the glass
(reasonably) understand your position
(pause) understand how a maggot like you can just slide out of a jam on a trail of slime
And call it -- expedience
(viciously) Expedience
Kirkhill slams his empty glass down
His tone becomes self-righteous
You're out of your depth, Trautman
Way out
'm acting correctly here
Not you
Not your gung-ho jungle ace

Walk away
It's not over
You made one mistake

revealing him under guard, arms bound painfully tight behind him, in the back of a troop truck
He is seized by    and dragged forward, off the truck
De Fravio hits the ground behind him, and Brewer, moaning on a stretcher, is unloaded
His fatigues are matted to the skin by dried blood from hip to knee
Camp commander     strides across the compound
He is fairly twitching with suppressed rage at the loss of face brought on by his useless guards
He screams orders as the troops dismount, roughly dragging forward the three captives

The instant Vinh stops shouting Tay begins, like a relay
The prisoners are prodded forward
Rambo walks beside a wide-eyed Brewer
Are they going to torture us
(distantly) Yes

(looking back) Hope they kill you by mistake
Rambo's guard slams his rifle butt into the American's belly, half-doubling him over
No talk
The door to a tiny fetid room is opened and Brewer is dumped off the stretcher and flung inside
He lands on his knees and gasps in pain, clutching his leg
The door clangs shut, leaving stifling gloom
(groaning) This ain't happening
' De Fravio is helped back to his bunk by one of the other prisoners
There are few moments in human experience as devastating as the return to prison (especially this prison)
The absolute abandonment of hope
Several of the POWs sit near him, silently offering their support
It is evident that two of the men,

Rambo sways in the spotlight, glistening with sweat, stripped to his
shorts
In the four corners of the small room are guards with rifles
Others crowd in the doorway, grinning and jostling to see
The truncheon descends against Rambo's face
He sprawls onto the floor face-down, nose streaming blood

The two officers exit at a run, leaving Rambo on his face before the guards

The Viet officers and guards cringe against the rotor blast as the ship settles

Vinh points to the concrete blockhouse and the officers stride past him without slowing
He falls in behind them, trying to keep up
' Jensen turns from the window as the  -24's jet-whine fades
It's those Russian interrogators again
Everyone looks grim
Vinh sends the gawking guards scurrying with strident yells as he follows the two Russians into the room
The Soviets stand in front of Rambo
The shorter of the two, , has the slight build and unremarkable features of a bank clerk, though for a man in his forties he is in superb condition
The other, , is another story
He is a tall broad slab of combat muscle, his black hair cut short as a scrub brush
Thick and functional as state sculpture, his features cannot fill his broad, flat face
Both wear the khaki field dress and black beret of the Naval Spetznatz Brigada, The "Special Operations Brigada"
At Palyushin's feet, Rambo finds himself looking up at his Soviet opposite number, the

Palyushin hauls Rambo onto a wooden stool against the wall
Podovsk sits next to him on a small metal desk
It is almost dark and the only light is from a single bare bulb
(Viet to Vinh) Thank you, Captain Vinh
Leave one guard, please
Vinh exits with Tay and the other three Viets
Podovsk adjusts his wire-rim glasses and considers Rambo
He turns Rambo's bloodied face gently, examining the injuries
These people are so
vulgar in their approach
am Lieutenant Commander Podovsk
do not know who you are
Will you tell me
Podovsk's English is lightly accented but clear and articulate
He has a nasal condition, however
Rambo doesn't answer
(continuing) No
Not even your name
(silence) This is a poor beginning for an intimate relationship
By tomorrow or the next day you will tell me things you would not tell a lover
Podovsk notices the long criss-crossed scars on Rambo's chest and back
(continuing) see you are no stranger to pain
Then of course you must know how senseless it is to resist in the long run
Is it possible you have been among my Vietnamese comrades before
Podovsk catches something as Rambo breaks his gaze, looking away
(continuing) Yes
think that must be it
Where were you held
Hanoi
Son Tay
apologize
'm getting ahead
Sometimes  get too eager
My comrade and , in our capacity as advisors, have been sent from our center at Cam Ranh Bay to discover from you certain things
for example: whether you are working directly for the American government
Who your contacts were
and on and on
Quite a list
Will you tell me these things now
Rambo gazes at a point in space
(continuing) Of course you won't
But, as a moral man,  felt compelled to ask
He stands with a shrug of finality and gestures to his massive assistant
This is Lieutenant Palyushin
To him you are a piece of meat

He unlatches the gate
An    has been brought in and leaned vertically against the wall opposite the door
Rambo has been tied to the frame spread-eagle by lengths of    around his ankles, neck and forearms at the elbows
Palyushin is setting up a box-like    on the small desk
There are wires running from the bedframe and from a   about the size of a paperback book taped to Rambo's belly
Palyushin clamps the other ends of the cables to terminal posts on the box, which has a large  knob and several switches and dials
was sent here because of my command of your language
It will be frustrating if we cannot have a nice chat
Very frustrating
(Russian to Palyushin) Ready
Palyushin nods and douses Rambo with a
(Russian) Test please
Palyushin, without ceremony, twists the knob
Rambo convulses with an explosive muscle contraction
Slams against the springs
His veins swell as if to burst
The lights of the camp dim, flickering, under the current load
Rambo slams convulsively against the electric grid formed by the steel bed
His teeth are clenched as if he has tetanus
' The lights come up to normal brightness
De Fravio closes his eyes, sharing a ghost of the pain
Rambo hangs from his bonds, heaving and shivering
Podovsk turns to him conversationally, as if he were an acquaintance at work rather than a man being tortured
Oh, yes
Here is something you might be interested in
He draws a folded piece of paper from his pocket
Opens it
transcript of the conversation between your helicopter pilot and his commander, intercepted and unscrambled by our overworked cryptography staff
(reading) Mmm
"Zen Hammer
Slam Dunk
" Colorful names
Here we are: "Ah, Coach One
we have them in sight
" And the reply: "Abort immediately
Return to base camp
" He graciously shows Rambo the printout
It seems they intentionally abandoned you on direct orders
There are the people you protect with your silence
With your pain
He snaps his fingers and Palyushin cranks the knob
The lights dim
Rambo fights the scream unleashed within him with every fiber of his being
Straining like a demon, every muscle sharply defined and rock hard
(almost kindly) But you must scream
You must
There is no shame
It bursts out, a roar that frays his vocal cords
Co, moving stealthily in the shadow of a wall, pauses at the  of the scream
Notes its direction
In the darkness Brewer rages against the inhuman screaming, pounding the wall
Bastards
Rambo hangs so limply that he might be dead
Podovsk moves in to check as Rambo's head begins to rise
as he looks up
His eyes seem like diamond drills
There is such determination born of rage in his expression that Podovsk stops
Takes a step back
Snaps his fingers
Rambo convulses and begins to scream
Podovsk nods to his assistant
- ' cuts off the current
But the scream The Lieutenant looks up, puzzled
Rambo is going berserk
His body is an out-of-control machine, lashing and tearing at the frame
The scream breaks and becomes a
The Viet guard steps forward, alarmed and unnerved
His rifle is raised, warding off evil
Podovsk motions him back and steps closer himself
The bedframe begins to twist, creaking and warping under Rambo's frenzied assault

Podovsk takes a reflexive step forward
Rambo's hand shoots out, free suddenly, like a grappling hook

Co cuts his throat in one motion with a
She covers Palyushin with the guard's -47 as she circles to Rambo who is still enmeshed in metal wreckage
Rambo smashes the Makarov into Podovsk's temple twice, then holds Palyushin transfixed by his pistol sights as Co works quickly at his bonds
There are superficial cuts on his forearms, ankles and neck from the wire
Rambo  hideously and with cold premeditation to mask the sound of her work
The effect is bizarre, surreal, maniacal
(whispering) We get out
Split up
They not want me
Rambo steps from the wreckage and advances on the hulking Black Beret, pistol ready
Again he screams, almost a war cry now, and smashes his fist into the Russian's face with the force of his entire body behind it
The big man's head ricochets off the wall into a second piledriver punch
Palyushin goes down
Podovsk groans and stirs until Rambo twists the knob
Despite a bad connection, Podovsk jerks spasmodically under the collapsed metal frame, lying in the puddle of water
Before Co can use the knife on Palyushin, Capt
Vinh enters, his expression agape
He turns and bolts
Vinh dashes out,
Behind him Rambo hurtles through the door, a blur, and smashes Vinh against the concrete wall
Vaulting over the crumpled camp commander without slowing, Rambo hits the outside door at a full run
Just as Sgt
Tay is opening it from outside
Tay's  flies from his hands as he tumbles back
Rambo spins into him with a    which pitches him onto his back, an inert heap

The lights of the camp go out completely
With Co close behind him, Rambo runs toward the compound fence

The guard dives for cover
Rambo lifts the wire for Co to wiggle under
She reciprocates for him as the   spins his long- unused    and opens fire
Co fires from the shoulder
The tower guard flinches at the unexpected return fire

His shots go wild
Co's  empties

She spins and sprints away along the trail, disappearing in a moment
Rambo hesitates an instant, then runs the other way

He hurls the metal frame off his superior, who groans feebly

Tay's shoulders as he retches

He dives over the edge of a muddy ravine, dropping through tangled vines
Catching, clawing, dropping

Totally manic
They can't target him
He hits a solid trail and sprints, really covering ground
The shaft of light scans back and forth behind him
Then farther away
They've lost him
For the moment
as the choppers circle, seemingly dueling with lances of light
- Rambo, moving rapidly, but more carefully, glides among the trees
He stops at the     , setting down knife and pistol
Scooping stinking   from the stream bed, he begins to slather it over his pale skin with quick, sure strokes
Arms
Legs
Body

His eyes open
It is a neolithic, feral visage that turns away into the foliage
moving forward cautiously
Unfamiliar with tracking, and little else really except bullying weak prisoners, they crash around clumsily, falling and cursing in the dense thicket
moving in absolute silence nearby
He freezes
Fifteen meters away is a   , asleep under a knot of vines

It squeals and leaps up

They hear something crashing through the undergrowth to the right
Movement in dense brush
They open fire
The     is deafening
They blast blindly away, lighting up the forest
Their attention is so focused, the din so loud, they do not notice a dark figure moving up behind them
Rambo snatches the wayward last guard into a thicket, knife buried to the hilt, hand over his mouth
Tay shouts repeatedly to cease firing and the others finally stop
They move away, advancing on their "target
" Tay gingerly parts woven branches, revealing the pig, riddled with hundreds of 7
62mm rounds
He turns to the others
(Viet/subtitled) Where's Trang
The other guards look around, puzzled
shadow in shadows
He slips the clip from the -47 he has liberated, but finds it almost empty
Sets it down quietly
Tay spreads his men out to sweep the area in an arc
The guards advance, stricken with a growing unease
through the trees as the Soviet assault helicopter passes overhead, its searchlight sweeping
The canopy of foliage lashes violently as the rotor wash blasts through it
Monkeys  and leap about
- as the godlike shaft of light moves through the brush behind him
Searching
Passing within a meter of him
He moves quickly off
The disk of hideously bright light passes over two guards, blinding them
One trips and goes down
The other, the outermost man of the sweep, waits for him to rise
And waits

You alright
The guard moves cautiously to his friend's last position

Approaching the body warily, the guard plays his flashlight around him in a full circle

The pilot directs the searchlight as he flies
Palyushin touches his nose gingerly
It is clearly broken, becoming a thickened, purplish mass
Realizing they are without their flankers, the two call out and move toward their last positions
They stand together at the top of the mudbank, gaping at the two bodies sprawled below
isolated, calling for his men to sound off
He hears a distant shout, then a quick burst of gunfire
Bui
Phong
Than
There is no answer

The pilot banks, arcing around his searchlight's target
Tay moves forward hypnotically, as if transfixed
The celestial shaft of the searchlight burns down ahead
He approaches
Like a vision he sees the sprawled in the quivering disk of light
One has been stripped of his clothing
He stares around, terrified, staggers back, lip quivering
Tay drops his rifle and runs back through the jungle
- Rambo climbs steadily
The mud, dissolving in sweat, runs in streaks off his body

He looks haggard
Soul-weary
With the receiver cradled at his ear he is waiting for a call to connect
Bob, hi
Did you get my telex
(pause) Yeah,  know what time it is there
do you know what time it is here
Look, is there anything you can do up the line
You owe me one

Back off

There is a swaying   of rope and woven vines crossing to the jungled slope beyond
Looming at the top of that slope is the ruin of the Wat on its plateau, wreathed in streamers of blowing mist
Not far away is the waterfall, pouring itself into the gorge below
Rambo stops at the far side of the bridge, examining the vine-cables

Rambo looks up along the tumbled stone wall
Sitting near the top in shadow, perched on a tree limb, is Co, beaming like a Cheshire cat
(relaxing) Christ
How'd you get here

knew you would come here
He helps her down the last few feet, and stands looking at her, marveling
And how'd you sneak up like that
Carefully
Don't want to get shot by you
Bad karma
Anyway, you need me

Rambo has to laugh
Yeah
We're a pretty good team
Co looks him over carefully
She touches his forehead
You look like hell
Wounds infected
Come up to the ruins, have medical kit
Rambo lets her lead him to the path up the hill
The stone Buddhas look on complacently as Co attends to Rambo's minor wounds
During the ensuing conversation she cleans, applies salve and bandages the wire-lacerations and the numerous slashes from brambles and saw-edged elephant grass

Got some business there
What are you gonna do

Co stops her work and replies very quietly
Yes you can
How
Co's gaze holds his and her Cheshire grin flickers
As wife
Rambo realizes she is serious
The silence drags when he realizes how good that sounds to him at this moment
And how small a price that is to repay her
(with finality) Okay
Done
You got it
She seems a bit shocked, then smiles impishly
You too easy
Co's hands have been all over him but only now does he become aware of them on his shoulders
She draws her face up to his but Rambo pulls back from the kiss
Co looks puzzled as he slowly disengages from her contact
You don't feel love, Rambo
He leans back against the wall
Look, Co
Why you don't feel love
Not allowed
(her tone becomes aggressive) Dead inside, maybe
You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you
In-vulnerabo
Bullshit
She advances on him until her face is close to his, her words finding their mark

The  is not that of a machine gun but rather a , like a god belching
One of its nicknames was "Puff the Magic Dragon

Trees are blown to kindling
The foliage is pulverized, and blown upward like mist
The tracers hit the ground like an orange curtain stripping the stones of growth, blasting up a cloud of emulsified jungle
In their crevice, Rambo and Co huddle, covering their ears

Suddenly, the thunder cuts off
Rambo rolls out

Slaps him on the shoulder
You're gonna love it
(shouting) How much we got left in that minigun
Brewer opens the enormous ammunition canister
Pretty low
Couple of seconds worth
Rambo is plugged into some insane second sight, knowing the curves before they curve
He flies with absolute concentration
The pilot is sweating, trying to stay on Rambo's Huey
We're in Laos, Sir
know that
(to gunner) Fire all your rockets
Take him down
/ As the forest explodes around them
The chopper is buffeted
The forward canopy is shattered by shrapnel
Rambo is hit in the shoulder and chest
His left arm broken above the elbow
One of the prisoners is moaning, holding his bloody forehead
Rambo pulls up on the collective, sending blinding pain through his arm
The Huey shoots up out of the jungle, spinning as it pops up
It slips sideways through the air, seemingly going out of control
Then it arcs back,
Podovsk watches Rambo's turn, realizing he has stood to fight
(Russian/subtitled) We've got him
The pilot stares apprehensively as the Huey comes at them
In the weapons bay, the tone of the ranging-radar rises to a shriek
The gunner tenses to fire
Rambo throws the gunship sideways and climbs in one motion
bringing the minigun to bear
He is a samurai and the Huey his sword
facing the Soviet leviathan, clear-eyed, in the Void Way, as they say
It will be a battle of one stroke
He waits
Feeling his breathing
Feeling the ship like an extension of himself
The minigun
watching
shadow passes over him
as the Soviet ship thunders over them and flies on
The barrels of the minigun continue to rotate, dry- firing
empty
Clicking like an air-ratchet
showing the riddled, glassless cockpit
the slumped bodies
as the  -24 slowly brodies sideways and drops, gracefully, into the rain forest
It shears through trees, breaking up, and Rambo is tensed, like a thousand volts are flowing through him
Slowly, he relaxes
He knows they have made it
(exultant) The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
Rambo banks the Huey, ascending toward the mountain pass and, beyond, Thailand
: -  - Lifer lounges in the gun door of the "Blackhawk" as the ship sits at ready, turbine idling
(
) Getting ready to go somewhere
Lifer turns to see Trautman step around the fuselage of the chopper
Hey, Colonel
You're not cleared to be on this base anymore
(quietly) know
: -    - - 60 The battered Huey lumbers and dips over the terrain, barely in control
/ Rambo seems drained of color, sunken into the seat, flying on nerve
Several of the prisoners are asleep
The wounded man's forehead has been bandaged
Brewer is holding court
and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword
except it's not a sword, it's light
There's the Mekong
They look forward as a broad river appears beyond a ridge- line less than a kilometer ahead
The Thai border cheer goes up
home run
seeing something as they approach the river
- The   rises slowly above the trees directly ahead
, he blinks, trying to clear his vision which has become light and shimmery
The hovering ship looks like the Archangel of Death
It seems like a vision
He flies straight toward it
Kirkhill has cleared the operations center
He is alone
(to mike) When the unidentified helicopter has crossed the river into Thailand, shoot it down with air-to-air rockets
Then proceed to the crash site and fire your remaining rockets into the wreckage
Is this understood, Zen Hammer
(
) (filtered) Ah, Sir
'm experiencing a little hearing problem
What are you talking about
Why
(
) (filtered) Well, uh
've got something in my ear
/ What Doyle has in his ear is the muzzle of Colonel Trautman's -16
Behind them on the deck of the gun bay Lifer is out cold
tarpaulin among a stack of ammo cases where Trautman had been hidden is thrown back
Doyle knows better than to mess with him
Trautman switches off the radio as Kirkhill shouts incoherently
/ As he approaches the black Sikorsky Rambo sees Trautman with a rifle to Doyle's head
He nods as they pass
/ Rambo's Huey passes by them, crossing into Thailand
Escort them on in
Rambo's Huey, followed by the Sikorsky, descends toward the landing field
As the techs and other camp personnel stand watching, Kirkhill raises a pair of powerful field glasses
'  - The image of the Huey seems to waver insubstantially through the long lens
It looks like a death ship, the Flying Dutchman with a crew of corpses and a demon at the helm, coming in out of the dusk sky
He slowly lowers the glasses
Face ashen, Kirkhill backs into the command center and closes the door
The Huey sheers sideways across the staging area
Its skids clip the top of the , shearing off communications gear
It hits the ground
Bounces
Slews around, scraping hideously
And stops
The Sikorsky settles behind it
The two choppers whine-down
Standing beside the cockpit, Trautman gets on the Sikorsky's loudspeaker
All base personnel
Prepare medical facilities to receive American POWs
cheer is raised among the ground contingent as they surge forward
sliding painfully out of the flight seat
Brewer gawks at the pool of blood collected in the hollow of Rambo's seat
Rambo goes to the gun door
Takes De Fravio's -47
as he limps toward the  with relentless determination
The well-wishing ground personnel fall back, letting him pass
Trautman,
, sees him and strides forward to intercept
' , as he approaches the command center
Kirkhill's aide, in dark glasses, moves forward to restrain him
Rambo motions him aside with the
Goes to the door
It is locked
The lock is shattered by a   from Rambo's
The door is kicked open
Rambo stands silhouetted
He looks like what we never saw in "The Monkey's Paw
" He moves into the humming command center, among the mission control electronics, reeking of the jungle, blood and death
as Rambo walks to Kirkhill, looming
Stopping
Kirkhill quails as Rambo grasps him by the collar and flings him backward into a chair
He raises the
Muzzle to Kirkhill's forehead
Mission accomplished
Pulls the trigger
The weapon ,
, trembling
Rambo steps unsteadily out into the waning light
He takes a deep, slow breath
Starts to walk
He salutes as he passes Trautman but says nothing
In the

Rambo watches Brewer posing with his arms around Jensen and another  for the grunt we saw earlier
His pocket Instamatic is clicking away
(expansively) Cover of Time Magazine, baby
Rambo walks away
alone
(
) Hey, Rambo
Rambo turns
De Fravio, propped up on one elbow on his stretcher as he is carried past, gives him a broad, appreciative grin
You did good, buddy
Real good
Rambo stands blinking for a second
He raises his hand in a big "thumbs up" and allows himself to grin
