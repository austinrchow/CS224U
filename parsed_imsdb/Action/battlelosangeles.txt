You're on that training assignment right now
Why don't you just ride it out for a month or two

Roy takes this in, nods
He stands, holds his hand out

Lenihan, you as good with an -16 as you are with your mouth

Lay off him
What
Just wanna make sure the rookie won't fold under fire
Correggio shoves a beer into Kerns' hand
Relax, dude
He throws an arm around Kerns' shoulder, smiles at the girls

My buddy's jumpy 'cause he got an assfull a' shrapnel our last tour
'm jumpy
You're crawling up your own ass 'cause we train with Sgt
Nantz tomorrow
Correggio eyes Kerns
This was the wrong thing to say
One girl, smiling seductively, steps to Correggio, takes the golf club
from him
#1 If this is the officer's course, what happens if they catch you out here
She readies to take a shot
Correggio snuggles up behind her, ostensibly teaching her how to swing
We can handle it, baby
We're experts at night maneuvers
Nearby, the   chats up Adukwu
#2 So you're from where again
Imlay pops a beer, interrupting
Nigeria
Adukwu's our corpsman
Like a medic
Saved Kerns' ass
( ) Daktari, tell her about Nigeria
Adukwu starts to talk, but Imlay interrupts again: Adukwu's a green card marine
(motions to Lenihan) And Lenihan here-- He's just green
Mom signed so he could join at 17
'm looking after him since he don't know his ass from a hot rock
Lenihan suddenly ducks behind the Tahoe, throwing up
#3 You're doing a good job

Yeah
We always take the new meat out here to christen 'em
Lenihan shuffles back out from behind the Tahoe
Hey, barfy
Grab your beer
toast
Everyone holds beers aloft
Lenihan joins in reluctantly
To Lenihan
Who gets his first taste a' those hills tomorrow
He points off to the ,   near the course
Good luck, rookie
The marines chuckle knowingly, about to drink
Then they hear the sound of  skidding to a halt
They look toward the hillside, see the  'of MPs

The marines grab the goggles and clubs, pile

He stops, smiling back at her now
She waves coyly
Then Martinez is
Moving with the grace of the college football player he was just a few years ago
We don't go with him

Martinez arrives at Anna, who laughs as he leans down, kissing her stomach now

Nantz, running up ahead
Heard Nantz put in his papers
He's out
Good
Wish he done it years ago
Lenihan, struggling, breathing hard, looks up at this, as he does
Nantz, looking back at the chatter, sees
Imlay grab hold of Lenihan, helping him forward now
Goddamn it, Imlay, you gonna wipe his ass for him, too
Every man carries his weight
Nantz drops back, runs alongside the struggling Lenihan
Just quit, Lenihan
Do us all a favor
'Cause the squad's only as strong as the weakest man

Lenihan  and
And right now you're getting us all killed
You hear
On these words,     , further back in the pack
Nantz looks away, sees
Imlay, suddenly at Lenihan's side, helping him up
Nantz shoves Imlay away, knocking him onto his ass

You think you're helping him, Imlay
You think you're making him stronger
Nantz puts a boot into Imlay's chest, shoving him flat
Correggio stares at this, steaming
Stay on the goddamn ground, Imlay
You've just been gut-shot
( ) Your buddy's down, bleeding to death, Lenihan

You gonna let this man die in the dirt on some stinking hill
Or are you marine enough to save him
Lenihan stumbles to his feet, wiping dirt from his mouth
'm gonna save him, sir
Lenihan bends, strains, somehow heaves Imlay up
He begins    , carrying Imlay on his back
Come on, goddamnit
It's a hot
The chopper's gotta move

Lenihan staggers, knees trembling, weaving back and forth
Then his foot comes down on a

Correggio takes a step towards Nantz now
Kerns stops him
He's injured, Sergeant

moment as they stare at each other
Nantz, voice like ice: He's not injured
He twisted his goddamn ankle
Nantz' looks over the men, sweaty, covered with grime
We are marines
"Can't" is not the code we live by
"Can't" gets marines killed
Do things the right way, the marine way, maybe you get to come home
Maybe your buddy gets to come home
Correggio stares back sullenly on this
Dying's easy, ladies
Everything else takes balls
Nantz spits on the ground
Adukwu
Run a bag of saline into Lenihan and tape that ankle

Harris looks pained
But before he can speak up: Well,  think it's a no-brainer
You're only getting married once

Cherise looks expectantly to Harris, who smiles back weakly

, a spaced-out surfer vibe, sit on boards in the water, staring at
MPs, on the beach, waving them in
don't know why they always have to give us shit
It's not fair
Question is, why does everybody think life's supposed to be fair
Why do bad guys want to kill us
Why can't  have a nipple ring
Why is it the more power we get, the more we want
Nothing's fair, Simmons
() Whatever, Corporal
just like to blow shit up
Suddenly, a  begins  from the base
Grayston and Simmons exchange a glance
They start paddling in quickly
- Nantz is running with another platoon of
Everyone slows as the   from the base

Hold
The squad stops, following Nantz' gaze to
An approaching dust cloud, being kicked up by

Everyone is silent as they watch the  and  pull up
This is not normal
1st Sergeant Roy hops from the Humvee, shouting: 1ST Marines
Into the trucks
Now
Proceed to the armory and draw weapons
The marines exchange glances, heading for the five-tons
Roy motions to Nantz, who follows him to the Humvee
What's going on, John
1ST Look, Mike,  know you're burnt out, ready to move on
Whatever you want to call it
But everybody's being deployed right now
And the platoon's down a sergeant
We need you
For what
Do  have a choice here
They arrive at the Humvee
Roy turns to Nantz
1ST No
You don't
It's all hands on deck, Mike
Nantz nods, resigned
Starts climbing into the Humvee
Just don't lose my paperwork

1ST Meteor storm's hittin' up and down California now
All  know is, this is a helluva lot more than just some space rocks fallin' out to sea
What d'you mean
He turns
, stares at Nantz
1ST Whole base is being mobilized
There's some kinda' bad shit hittin' the fan
- The Humvee and five-tons swing into the base past a mass of activity:  being loaded with supplies,  driving onto flat cars,  racing about
- 1ST You're assigned to 1st platoon, under Lt
Bennie Martinez
His platoon sergeant was rushing back to base, got in a car accident
What are the odds
As the Humvee pulls to the  , Nantz sees
hurrying to meet them
1ST There's the lieutenant
Young, been with us three months, straight outta basics school
Bright kid, but this is his first deployment, so keep an eye on him, Mike
15
-    - Lenihan and Imlay, Correggio and Kerns are getting their gear together, hurriedly packing
Lenihan checks and double checks a  with the contents of his pack, ticking off 'poncho liner,' 'gore-tex jacket,' 'socks,' 'vest,' 'first aid kit,' flashlight'
It's probably just a drill, right
They shifted Nantz into our unit
Something must be going on
heard Nantz kicked ass on his last tour
Went into a compound by himself, killed, like, ten insurgents
That what you heard
You don't know shit, Lenihan
Correggio, pissed, grabs his pack, heads for the door
Move your asses
They want us in the armory
And he's gone
Lenihan, confused, looks at Imlay
What's his problem
Nantz lost a lotta guys on that tour
Correggio's brother was one of 'em
Lenihan nods, somber, getting it

All around them, hurry, all responding to

Nantz looks askance at this
Martinez catches it
Look, Sergeant, let's be clear know your rep, know what you've done
But this is my unit
We're not gonna have a problem, are we
No problem, sir
It's all yours

Martinez barks: Let's move, men
, The platoon grabs gear, runs for the helicopter, climbing aboard
Nantz hurries them along, grabbing packs, throwing them on after the marines
Then he grabs Correggio's pack, about to throw the pack on
Correggio grabs it back from Nantz
Nantz turns, faces off with Correggio
You got something to get off your chest, Corporal
No
It's cool, Sergeant
You got a Silver Star and my brother came home in a box

Beat
Get aboard, Corporal
Correggio jumps into the chopper
-46   - The marines, helmets on, packs between their knees, sit facing each other
The sound of the -46's massive rotors is deafening
Some shout over the din, too nervous to remain quiet
What the hell you think those things are
Gotta be extraterrestrial

You mean, like, from space
No, Imlay
From Canada
Correggio looks down at his hand
Sees the ' written on it

Nantz nods
They're flying into the unknown and Martinez seems as nervous as the younger men
Kerns leans in to Nantz, desperately needing reassurance
How many a' them you think there are, Sergeant
Nantz just stares out, stone-faced
We'll know soon enough, private

In the distance, of  moving away from the ocean

At 9 p

We're
leveling it, Captain
We've got an infestation of god- knows-what
It's an enemy ground force only, they have no aircraft
So our jets'll tear 'em a new asshole
We will rule the air
But
there must be civilians stuck behind the line, sir
That's affirm
We're getting distress calls, sending squads out

Police were using it as an evacuation point
They got overrun
Get there, any civilians you find, get 'em back here to the for evacuation
You got three hours

Nantz yells over the sound: What do we know about these things, Captain
Not much
But police have shot 'em
They bleed
The captain, hurrying to the next chopper, yells back: It's our job to kill 'em

Grayston, Correggio and Kerns, Stavrou and Harris, Imlay and Lenihan, Mottola and Guerrero, Simmons and Adukwu)
As they approach Lincoln, they slow, eyes widening
to see what they're staring at: Being fortified into a defensive line

Martinez turns, rallies the squad, most of whom look shocked
Let's go, marines
Clock's running
Focus on the mission
We're gonna get to that community center and get those people safe
screams overhead, firing into the distance
Martinez turns to Nantz, shouting over the din: Something to add, Sergeant

Billowing rumbles from the west

The lack of visibility is clearly adding to the marines' fright
Numerous  become visible in the smoke

Lenihan grimaces
Ahh, shit
It's burning
His  is being eaten away by the liquid
Imlay is immediately at Lenihan's side, pulling the helmet off
Lenihan's skin is blistering, oozing

How's my face
Ugly as ever, bro
The squad hunkers down, trying to find any cover-available-- behind cars, trees
Martinez drops   , pulls out his , checking it for escape routes

Chaos as    increases, exploding around them
Martinez looks desperate, forced to    by the alien fire

Then something grabs Grayston through the bushes
Nantz sticks his  into the bushes, fires
And Grayston is suddenly free
Nantz drags him into

Guerrero, Imlay and Simmons lay down an awesome barrage with powerful  (Squad Automatic Weapon), covering

Trees and bushes are shredded, houses are splintered
All this mayhem allows the squad to

The marines are sweaty, bleeding, scared

You okay
Kerns stares back, deer in the headlights
He nods

These things'll kill me
Adukwu smiles
Grayston stares at his arm, ironically: Hell, now that just ain't fair
Nantz moves to Martinez, who is staring down at the wounded Grayston and Guerrero
Sir, what are your orders
Martinez turns, stares at Nantz
led us right into that ambush
Sir
Your orders
Beat
Martinez nods
Let's figure out how we get out of here
We'll medevac the wounded from that park

Nantz nods, turns to Mottola
Radio the
Get us a medevac at that park by the community center
As Mottola works the radio, he's startled to see Guerrero, who has been  across both eyes

Mottola, horrified, steadies his voice
You'll be okay
slight beat
Then
You're one shitty liar, bro
Hey, where the hell is Lenihan
Everyone stops, stares
- Lenihan, pressing a hand into his side,  oozing between his fingers, peers     at
, its water gently lapping
nearby
Lenihan, startled by the  of   in the alley behind the house, takes cover
He struggles to remain calm
Then the sound
He waits
Silence
Lenihan starts to edge,out as
rings out on the far side of the garage
Lenihan spins back behind cover, eyes desperately searching
- Nantz shoulders his -16
Martinez eyes him
'll go for Lenihan, sir
33
All right
We'll package the wounded, then rally on 10th street
() Mottola, Imlay
Go with the sergeant
The two quickly step to Nantz
We got your six, Sergeant
Anything you need
What  need is for you to keep quiet
And stay close
Right
Got it
Quiet
Starting now, Private
As Nantz turns, Mottola slaps Imlay in the helmet
Lenihan creeps around the garage, spies a   leading into it
He grabs the handle
Mercifully, the door opens
- Lenihan falls
Boxes and old furniture
Just one dirt-stained  on an opposite wall
Lenihan crouches in the dim light, coughs, spitting up blood
He turns on his radio, says into it: Motorola
You copy
His  buzzes back with Nantz' voice: (

This is Sgt
Nantz
Sergeant, Jesus,  had to turn the radio off

These things are everywhere

What's your location
- Lenihan looks across the garage, out of the window
'm in a garage

House is white with black shutters
Just as something  against the garage

Lenihan stares, his eyes going wide, panicked
(
) Lenihan, is the house a
Lenihan  the radio
Then waits, very still, listening, -16 held tightly
His breathing turns shallow-- from loss of blood and from fear
Lenihan sees the  of a bush  outside the window, as if something just brushed past it
- Nantz, Mottola and Imlay moving through the thick smoke
Nantz still trying to raise Lenihan on the radio
Lenihan
Lenihan
Imlay taps Nantz on the shoulder, motions to his ears
He hears something
The marines freeze, Nantz clicking the radio off as
Nearby, they hear  of aliens running
Somewhere
35
The marines crouch, weapons up, straining to see through the smoke
They remain stock still
Then
The sound fades into the distance
Nantz looks at the men
Motions
They creep forward as
- Lenihan moves   , searching the garage floor, desperate not to step on anything that would make noise
He edges forward to peer through the dirty glass
Then
More
On the garage roof now
Lenihan looks up, panicked as
The  suddenly
Lenihan spins,  wildly, lighting up the garage as
He stumbles to the door, fumbling for the handle, falling
- Lenihan staggers back, eyes darting along the garage roof, gun aimed
Nothing there
As Lenihan continues backing away, peering through the drifting smoke at the garage, he's unaware that  him
Lenihan doesn't see it, but he senses it
He turns,
as the shadowy alien figure is blasted back , disappearing under the water
Quickly, nervously, he loads another mag, edging to the pool
He peers over the pool edge
An indiscernible   lays on the bottom of the pool
Lenihan is transfixed a moment
Then he raises his rifle to punch more rounds into the thing as
The creature launches
36
As Nantz, Mottola and Imlay burst into the yard
They fire, as does Lenihan
The fusillade of bullets tears the creature up
The marines   as the alien falls to the ground
They stare amazed at the 7 ft
tall
Rigid skeleton bursting out of its skin, some strange layer of machinery intertwined with its flesh
Oh my God
What the hell are these things
They're butt ugly, that's what they are
Nantz grabs onto Lenihan, noticing his wound
We're gonna get you to the medevac, Private
Thank you, Sergeant
Thanks for coming for me
But Lenihan
Yes, Sergeant
Ever get separated from your unit again, 'll find you and shoot you myself
Yes, Sergeant
Imlay slings Lenihan's arm around his shoulder and they're instantly moving,
- The men meet up with the others
Adukwu and Kerns carrying Grayston on a litter, Simmons holding onto the blinded Guerrero, guiding him
37
All right, let's get to the community center
They head off, Simmons still supporting Guerrero as
An alien projectile slams  '
Choking, he to the ground
Guerrero stands, blind, helpless
Panic
The marines spin, searching for targets
Move
Grab Simmons
Go, go
Stavrou hoists Simmons as the marines run off,  to cover their retreat, as
The  of    are visible on distant rooftops, watching the rifle squad disappear down the street
- Nantz, Martinez and the rest of the squad hustle silently through the street, supporting their wounded
They take cover behind cars, peering out to see
The  in the distance

There are distant sounds of warfare, but the area here seems strangely quiet
Then, out of the smoke, an
Something The marines all shift, aim forward, about to blast away as

Nantz signals with his flashlight
The marines hurry over, silently falling behind the cars
You guys are 2/5
2nd squad, 3rd platoon
Where's the rest of your unit
This is it, Lieutenant
Everyone else is dead or missing
The news hits Martinez hard
He eyes Nantz
We were on the street, like, ten minutes and they ambushed us
As soon as we radioed for help, it's like they were everywhere

All right
Stay with us

The crewman relents in the face of Stavrou's impressive bulk, tries to make room
Imlay and Stavrou get Simmons and Grayston on
Mottola helps Guerrero in, squeezing his hand

Thanks, dude
Think 'm gonna need it
Lenihan crawls onto the chopper's deck with Imlay's help

Lenihan smiles back

Imlay bumps fists with Lenihan, backs away as

The marines are breathing hard, looking stunned
Goddamn flying saucers now
All those guys on the chopper
Why'd those bastards have to come down here and start this shit
That is not relevant, Imlay
They're here
They're trying to kill us
Kill them first
Martinez eyes Nantz on this
Then barks orders: Secure the perimeter
Stavrou, give me an ammo check
Cpl
Correggio, take three men, set up an Observation Post on the roof
You heard the lieutenant
Move
The dazed marines begin  doors and hallways
We see in their  that it's a very different fight now
Nantz turns, can see the   out a window
His solemn stare hints at a growing desperation
Martinez steps up to him, looks out
Quietly: They got air power, too
Knocked that medevac right out of the sky
So much for ruling the air
Nantz just keeps staring out
42
Listen, Sergeant
These men are scared
little compassion would go a long way
Nantz turns on Martinez now
How's that gonna help them survive, Lieutenant
() 'll lead these marines
But don't ask me to get close to them
Nantz walks off
- Marines on post, watching various windows and doors
Imlay kneels by the kids, who look devastated by the day's events
Imlay wets a rag with water from his canteen, wiping the dust and dirt from the kids' faces
The younger girl, , 8, begins crying
She suddenly hugs Imlay
Imlay, startled by this, looks uncomfortable at first
Then hugs the little girl back, smiling at the older
girl, , 10, Kirsten's sister
You're not gonna leave us, are you
beat
Then Imlay smiles
No way, sweetheart
The woman, Michele McDermott, is clearly rattled, struggling for composure, eyes constantly moving to the kids
Mr
Rincon, a calm, watchful air about him, stands with his son, , the kid who Nantz had carried to the chopper
My son and  came here
There were only three cops, spread pretty thin
Then those things attacked
Police couldn't stop them
43
What happened to everyone
don't know
Most people ran
We hid in a side room, found Michele and the girls
Couldn't see what happened
Just heard
Screams

My sister and her husband are in Hawaii for their anniversary
Is it safe there
heard this is happening in other places
Martinez is at a loss for words
What do they want from us
Why are they here
don't know
Right now, our job is just to get you to safety, okay
Harris appears from the hallway
Lieutenant, something you should see
/   - The door opens
Nantz and Martinez edge out with Harris
As they peer into the smoke drifting past the building, an becomes clear
An
On the ground nearby
Ripped by bullets
They step to it cautiously, realizing

The alien , turning as if to stare back at them
Without a word, Nantz lifts his rifle, shoots it in the head
- Hector sits with Kirsten and Amy, digging candy Nerds out of his backpack
He turns to the other kids, holding the box out
Both kids reflexively accept handfuls of candy
44 Then Hector notices Imlay standing nearby
Want some Nerds
Imlay holds his hand out
Hector shakes candy into it as
Nantz enters, calling to Adukwu: Adukwu, bring your kit
Adukwu is immediately up, moving to Nantz
We're gonna cut one of these things open
See if we can figure out what makes 'em tick
Michele overhears, offering: Maybe  can help, sergeant
'm a vet
You're a veteran
(can't help but smile) No, a veterinarian
Oh
Okay
Well, thanks, um
Nantz has forgotten her name
She smiles
Michele
Right
Michele
(smiles, embarrassed)) Sorry
Mottola walks up
Sergeant
Can't raise anybody on the radio
We're cut off
Off Nantz' look
45
Kerns, Correggio and  2nd   are on watch, peering down to the street from opposite sides of the roof
All on edge, exhausted, dirty
No one says a word
Correggio eyes the other marines
They exchange an 'all- clear' sign
Then Correggio pulls up a radio
( ) reporting
We're clear up here
Correggio and Kerns look over the destroyed streets, smoke and flames rising from buildings in the distance, glimpses of white phosphorous raining down
beat, then
fucking aliens
Kerns looks at Correggio, starts to chuckle at the absurdity of it all
Then Correggio laughs
It's infectious
It's desperate
Then the laughter slows
Stops
You think those things get scared
They're probably just grunts like us
Probably dumped into battle, told to go fight
Kerns looks out
The constant thud and crack of warfare
city crumbling thought  could handle it
You are handling it
Thing 'm worried about is Nantz
Sergeant saved our ass at that ambush
He knows what he's doing
Yeah
Tell my brother that

Stavrou and Harris are in the room with Martinez
They step aside, revealing
The on the floor
Michele stops, stares
She and Adukwu are both taken aback at the sight of one of these things up close
You sure you can do this
was more sure two minutes ago
She looks to Adukwu
They step to the body together as
Nantz approaches Martinez
What's the plan, Lieutenant
Mission is still to get the civilians to the Forward Operating Base
We've got a battalion there, all that firepower
was thinking,  saw a bus couple of blocks back on 11th
Maybe we should stay on foot
Martinez looks at Nantz
Then opens a , pointing to 'Santa Monica Airport' on it
The  is here, at the airport
That's miles to cover with those kids
And those bombs are gonna drop in a little more than an hour
(thinking, deciding) We've got to move fast
We have no radio contact, nothing to let us know the best route to take
And a bus is a big target
made the call, Sergeant
It's my responsibility
47
Beat
Then Nantz nods, turns
Harris, Stavrou, lieutenant needs recon on a
bus
It was abandoned two blocks south off 11th
If it runs, get it back here
Can you hotwire a bus
(gestures to Stavrou) He's from Jersey, sergeant
nod from Nantz on this
- Correggio and Kerns are surveying the street
Correggio pulls the  up, talks quietly into it: Stavrou, Harris
- Stavrou and Harris peer out an   as they hear Correggio (

They exchange a quick glance
Every day a holiday, buddy
every meal a feast
They slip outside, running off silently
- Correggio and Kerns watch Harris and Stavrou run down the street, covering them with their -16s
48
- Adukwu and Michele, scalpels in hand, hover over the alien body
Its thick leathery skin has been sliced open
Martinez and Nantz observe, Imlay on post nearby
How's it going
Well, Lieutenant, 'm a medic, Dr
McDermott's a vet
We weren't sure who was most qualified to cut this thing open
Martinez smiles
Look
It's been surgically modified
He pulls tissue aside, revealing where the alien's 'gun' is attached to its arm
Part of its arm has been amputated to fit this weapon
Talk about commitment to cause
Adukwu examines a   just to the right of where the alien's 'heart' would be
Thick, fleshy veins run from it
What is that thing
He's from Nigeria, Lieutenant
Not a different solar system
Nantz looks over at Imlay
Thank you, private
Adukwu twists the cap
It comes free, revealing
Slimy, viscous fluid seeping from it
Everyone steps back, reacting to the putrid smell
49
Whoa, that stinks
Everyone steps back except Michele, that is
Unfazed, she takes her scalpel, makes an  across the organ

Swear to God, 'm gonna puke
Whatever you do, do it quietly, Imlay

Harris covers, staring off to the
Tree branches there cast   which sway with the breeze

The indistinct  of an  scout appears in the shadows

First thing  wired was a school bus
Trying to impress this Betty
She had a huge rack

Stavrou doesn't look up

What the hell was that
They exchange glances with the other marines across the roof
All four move quickly, converging on one side of the building, look down the side of it
An   leading into the center is

As Michele touches her scalpel to it, it
Then starts rhythmically
Looks like it's receiving a signal

Nantz sees the '   now, the whole arm , spreading through the alien's body like a seizure
This thing's still alive
Nantz pulls his -  , thrusting it , twisting viciously

The organ stops vibrating
The glow fades
The body slumps
Not so hard to kill when you know where to aim
Mottola appears in the room, a sense of controlled panic
Lieutenant
There's a breach

Harris and Stavrou exchange a quick glance
Stavrou drops below the wheel again

Nantz stands, staring     with his -16, surprised as Martinez steps up next to him
We're in it together, Sergeant
Martinez slams a grenade into his launcher now
'mon, Mottola
Get that bus here
Mottola is on the radio, frantic: Where the hell is that bus

Harris looks out to see  rounding the corner in the distance
Get this thing started
Hey, why didn't  think a' that

We're out of time
Martinez looks   , sees the kids staring back
Go
Get 'em out
Imlay swings the   , moving the civilians out
Nantz and Martinez stand together, aiming at the hall as

Those alien ships took the whole line out

Stavrou lays on the gas, speeding away as, in the back, the other marines stare out
Mottola peers into the sky

Rincon holds Hector, Michele with her arms around both girls
Marines on the seats above, weapons ready
Nantz hears Imlay whispering to Harris: Why the hell'd the lieutenant wanna take a bus
We're sittin' ducks
56

You so eager to decide the fate of all these people
Imlay is stone silent
Didn't think so

The vibrations grow louder,
Suddenly
An   rips overhead
Then another, and another, and another
All heading east
The image of their speed, their power, their other- worldliness is overwhelming, devastating
Nantz stares, relief flooding his face, as the armada flies on
Leaving them behind

It's coming back
The children scream, marines agitated

Mottola turns off the radio

And that alien we cut open had something in it receiving signals
They must have one helluva command and control center
Martinez pulls his map out, eyes Nantz
That was some real John Wayne shit, Sergeant
Nantz tries to shrug it away
But Martinez nails him
Don't do it again
We work as a team, Sergeant

Nantz nods
We're clear, Lieutenant
Nearby, Imlay whispers to Mottola: Who's John Wayne
Martinez looks up from the map, turns to Stavrou
Take the freeway, Corporal
Cuts half the distance off our drive
Sir
We get on that freeway, we'll be exposed
It doesn't seem like we're much safer out here
We've got two shitty options-- 'm choosing the one that gets us there fastest

Stavrou, get down that ramp, secure the street
Kerns, Adukwu, help get the civilians off the freeway
Stavrou starts off the bus for the broken off-ramp

Amy and Kirsten, terrified, look up at Michele
She hurries the girls to the door of the bus as Kern runs up
It's okay
'll be right behind you
Adukwu picks up Amy
Kerns picks up Kirsten
66
(takes a breath, telling them, himself) It's gonna be scary but we can do it, okay
An alien round flies through the bus, shattering the back window
The girls scream
Kerns and Adukwu race away, running with the girls
Rincon grabs Hector
He and Michele follow
To the off-ramp
It seems like a long way off
They run past Correggio, rocking a  full auto
The  is deafening
Come on
Come on
Get some
Rincon and Michele, breathing ragged, feet pounding, look up
They're getting closer and closer to the off-ramp as
Alien rounds blow chunks of concrete off the roadway
, Kerns and Adukwu rush the girls to the , hurrying to get them down as
Rincon and Michele   - now
Kerns grabs Hector,      -, getting the boy safely handed down to awaiting Stavrou as
Rincon spins, sees the marine drop,
Rincon looks back at Adukwu, who is busy getting Michele down the off-ramp now
Then Rincon looks back to the freeway, sees Mottola writhing in agony
Rincon runs to Mottola, kneeling next to him
Mottola looks up at Rincon, fear in his eyes
It's okay, son
got you
67
Rincon starts to  Mottola   -
Struggling to get him to safety
Mottola's body starts to convulse
Rincon stops, tries to control him
Sees Mottola's eyes rolling back in his head
Then Rincon is horrified when he looks up to see
Heading his way
Moving in and out of the sea of abandoned cars
Rincon redoubles his efforts, pulling on the injured Mottola
As he does, he looks back up to see
The        now as
The first alien is shot by
Nantz, suddenly there, -16 poised
Rincon looks from Nantz to
coming at them
No choice-- Rincon   the injured Mottola's
Scared, but resolute
He looks at Nantz
What do  need to know
The slightest beat, then
It's set to fire in three round bursts
We're low, so don't waste your shots
Rincon holds the -16 against his shoulder, aiming
Just sight down the barrel
And give 'em hell
Rincon sights down the barrel of his rifle at   in the distance
He squeezes the trigger
- Adukwu sees Rincon and the wounded Mottola now
He runs to them, incoming rounds  by as
68
Adukwu bends over Mottola, seeing that he's dead
Adukwu closes Mottola's eyes as
An   from behind a car, It is about to  as
Rincon , blowing the alien away
Adukwu looks up, realizing Rincon just saved him
He,meets eyes with Rincon, who stares back, stunned a moment by his own actions
Adukwu immediately shouts a
warning
: Keep fighting
Rincon snaps back, turns to fire
moment too late as
Rincon is
He falls
Adukwu grabs Rincon, sees the pain and fear in the civilian's eyes
Adukwu rips open packages of QuickClot, begins spreading the fast-clotting powder on Rincon's wounds as
, Harris and Imlay firing
From this height, they can see the full expanse of freeway: More    coming, using abandoned cars as cover
Shit, Lieutenant, we're gonna be overrun
/ Nantz and Martinez exchange a desperate glance on this
Then Nantz
looks around, assessing the situation
Gimme two of your smoke cannisters
Martinez pops two canisters off, hands them to Nantz
Take someone to cover you
Nantz turns, sees Correggio
Then he turns the other way, sees Kerns
Kerns
Come on
69
Me, Sergeant
'm not worried about fightin' next to you, Kerns
Now let's go
slight smile from Kerns on this as he follows Nantz
Who sprints low, scurrying between cars
10
20
30 yards closer to the enemy
Nantz and Kerns arrive at a large
Kerns ducks low, covering Nantz
Nantz crouches, opens the gas tank
Unscrews the fuse from the smoke grenade body, tossing the canister aside
pulls the pin
flips the 'spoon' off
Get ready to move on my word
Nantz holds the fuse over the open gas cap
Now
Nantz drops the fuse into the gas tank
They go      as
B0000M
The   in a ball of flames
Nantz and Kerns dive   , Kerns crouching, laying cover fire
Nantz pulls a fuse
Again
Ready
(pops up, fires) Ready
Nantz drops the fuse, they run
The   in flames
Nantz runs to  , making sure Kerns is with him
Harris and Imlay see what Nantz is doing
70
He's creating a
Funneling the enemy into one
Forcing them through the  between the
Damn, Sergeant sure as shit's ninja
He just gave us a kill zone, didn't he, Corporal
Soon as they come through, blow 'em back to hell
The first alien appears
Imlay blows it away
Harris blows away the next
It's working
;
Nantz and Kerns fall back   , next to Martinez, Correggio and a 2nd squad marine
Along with Harris and Imlay on the bus roof, they are the only ones left holding the aliens off
All  forward as
More and more aliens begin pouring through, braving the flames
Into the line of fire
Many aliens go down
But because of their sheer numbers, few start to make it through,   at the marines
Martinez sees the 2nd   go down in front of him
Martinez rushes to his side
'
Martinez rises to shoot and
Martinez is hit
He looks down, blood running over his belt
Shock on his face
He's been shot in the stomach
Martinez looks around
The remaining aliens now only cars apart from them
Two forces taking cover behind spraying glass and punctured metal, firing directly into the faces of their enemy
Martinez pulls himself together, struggling over to Nantz
Pull the men back
Pull 'em all back now, Sergeant
'm gonna stay and cover
71
Nantz looks at Martinez about to say something
Sees the blood draining from his stomach, down his legs
Nantz grabs Martinez, pulling him up
Lieutenant
We gotta get you outta here
No way we're leavin' you
said  got it
'm not leaving you here to die
That's not your call, Sergeant
Now get your men outta here
He pushes Nantz away, looks around, the chaos slowing down for him
He reaches into his vest
Martinez hands the  we saw earlier to Nantz
moment between them
Nantz nods, then spins, moving, yelling to the men
We're pulling back
Head to the lower street, now
Nantz runs toward the edge of the destroyed off-ramp, laying cover as the men head down
Harris and Imlay slide down off the roof of the bus, joining the others running to the off-ramp
Correggio sees
, shooting at the aliens, drawing their fire
( ) What about the lieutenant
Keep movin', corporal
Go
All the men climb   -
Nantz turns to go back to get the Lieutenant himself, sees
Martinez hauling himself toward the rear of the bus
72
Martinez, behind the back of the bus, struggles to breath, still drawing fire
Grabs his radio
() This is Lieutenant Bennie Martinez', Marine Corps
Aliens converge toward the back of the bus
Ten
Fifteen
Twenty  heading for the signal
Heading for Martinez
() 1st Platoon, 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines
He turns, sees Nantz coming back for him
Martinez pulls a smoke canister from his vest
Holds it up for Nantz to see
Then unscrews the fuse, pops open the gas cap of the bus
Nantz turns, dives for cover as
Martinez drops the fuse into the gas tank
flash of fear across his face as
Aliens are on him as
Massive fire ball shooting 300 feet into the sky'
Nantz raises his head, debris raining down, sees
His eyes wide at Martinez's sacrifice, the burden now on him, he's in charge of the men, the civilians
Nantz gets to his feet
Runs for the off-ramp
73
-
- Nantz drops down the destroyed off-ramp
Runs to the marines and civilians
He sees Adukwu working on Rincon, Hector crying in Michele's arms
Package Mr
Rincon for transport
We've got to move
Sergeant
Did you just leave Lt
Martinez back there
Lt
Martinez stayed behind
He knew he was dying
So you left him
Is that how it is with you
He sacrificed himself to save our asses
(steps to Correggio) Now you get your head straight, Corporal
This is my unit now
Nantz looks at the men, who stare back, shaken
Let's move
We need shelter
Those bombs are gonna drop
- frantic dash through the street, rubble and fires all over
Marines carry the kids
, in Harris' arms, head swiveling, eyes searching for his dad, sees
Imlay and Adukwu  rINCON, who appears lifeless
5    - dark, empty store
The marines burst in, aiming rifles
Tighten this place down
See if we can establish communications
Hard line only
Nothing wireless
74
The marines move into position, covering windows and doors
Nantz turns to Michele, huddling with the kids
Listen, we're out of the bomb zone
But when they fall, we will definitely be rocked
Make sure the kids are prepared for that
Hector suddenly breaks free, rushing forward
as Imlay and Adukwu enter with Rincon, setting him down
Nantz pulls blankets from a nearby rack, covering Rincon
As he does, we see a glimpse of Rincon's -
He is very pale
Blood flecks his lips
Hector stares into his father's face, eyes filling
Rincon touches Hector's face lightly
It'll be okay
We'll get your dad fixed up
But when Hector looks to Nantz on this, he can't meet the boy's gaze
Hector can see this isn't the truth
Listen to me, son
'm not going to make it
(a slight beat) But you will
don't want to go without you
know
But you have to
Now wait with Michele a minute
Let me talk to the sergeant
Reluctantly, Hector allows Michele to lead him away
Mr
Rincon, we can take you and
Rincon turns to Nantz, steel-eyed
Don't waste time, sergeant
You and  both know what's going on here
75
can't leave you
No
You can't take me
Nantz is silent, at a loss
Imlay stares at a  on the wall, calls out: Four minutes and those bombs drop, Sergeant
looks over at this
But his expression is blank
He turns back to Rincon, who's staring straight into him
keep playing it over in my head
If 'd done things differently
Maybe  could have gotten Hector out earlier
You can't look back
You make the best decision you can
beat
Just promise you'll get my son out of here, Sergeant
Nantz looks like he has the weight of the world on him
promise
Rincon holds out his hand
Nantz takes it, meeting his gaze
'm trusting you with the only thing  have in this world
Nantz stares, nods
Sergeant
Hard wire connection
76
Nantz turns to see Harris behind a , at a -- an   on its screen
The marines crowd around, reading the ominous
"  -- Alien 'Creatures' Attack From Oceans" of  racing through urban streets, swarming over cars stuck in massive lines,of traffic
Underneath these pictures we see , a litany-of doom: Battle: Tokyo
Battle: Cape Town
Battle: Los Angeles
Then a   pops up on the screen, an  : 'baby, is that you
' Damn, that's Cherise
Harris quickly types back a response: 'you ok
' The message comes back: no, real scared
' Harris responds: 'where are you
' He hits
But the message doesn't go through
He clicks the mouse
But the computer has frozen
Then 'Internet Connection Lost' pops up on screen
Everyone stares
Harris stands, walks from the computer
Stavrou watches him go as
5 steps back to his dad's side
Rincon's eyes open slowly
He looks at Hector
Manages a small smile
Reaches out, wipes a tear from his son's face
'm very proud of you, son
You're being so brave
Hector throws his arms around his father, hugging him tightly
love you, Hector
Mr
Rincon smiles
His face peaceful
Hector is silent, tears rolling down his face
77
Thirty seconds
Get away from the windows
Get those kids behind cover
The marines back away from the windows into the center of the store, hunkering down with the civilians
Everyone stares at the  on the wall as it ticks
'mon
Fry those bastards
Those bombs drop, then everything's gonna change
Get to the , get some goddamn ammo
Some goddamn food
Some goddamn tanks
Beat
Everyone stares as
The  ticks to
They wait
Fear grows on everyone's faces
They shoulda' dropped, right
We'd feel it from here, wouldn't we
That much ordinance
They'd feel it in Nevada
Something's wrong
Maybe it's good
Maybe we turned the tide
Yeah, right, Imlay
'Cause we were kickin' ass out there
What's happening, Sergeant
What's that mean
don't know
78
Adukwu quietly approaches Nantz now, voice low
Sergeant
Mr
Rincon is dead
Nantz turns, staring off at Hector, sitting by his father
It's all too much
Jesus
Nantz takes a deep breath, his mind racing, the world closing in on him
He turns to Michele
Listen, our Forward Operating Base is about a mile away
We have to go on foot
'll need your help with Hector now
Michele nods
Watches as Nantz slowly walks to Hector
Nantz kneels by the boy
'm sorry Hector
Your dad
didn't make it
You understand
Hector, sobbing, overwhelmed by grief and fear, looks up at Nantz
don't wanna be here
want my dad back
want it all to go back to the way it was before
Stavrou, eyes on the still street, sees
appear
They crouch by a car
Sergeant, we got hostiles in front
All the marines stiffen, the clatter of rifles being raised
But Nantz, tearing up himself, just stays focused on Hector
Me too, Hector
wish it could go back, too
79
appear now, moving
Out of time, sergeant
Tries to lead Hector away
Hector struggles
( ) We have to go, Hector
() No
No
want my dad
Nantz lifts Hector
We see Hector's face, stricken, staring back at his father as he's carried off
The other marines gather up Michele and the girls
And everyone is moving silently    as
The plate glass window is  as
An  smashes through it
The alien is very still, peering around
Then it begins to creep forward as
, then a third, a  follows, leaping into the store with sinewy power
Nantz peers out a
It's clear
They   just as
leap in
They move in formation as

He signals to Kerns and Correggio
Check it out
The two marines run down the alley to the
Nantz sets Hector down
Looks the boy in the face
This is the hardest thing you'll ever have to do
Michele, arms around Kirsten and Amy, watches Nantz

But we'll get through it together
promise, Hector
Hector nods, still crying
Nantz exchanges a glance with Michele, who moves to Hector, comforting him
Nantz steps away as Kerns and Correggio run up, reporting: Looks good, both directions
Out of earshot of the civilians, Nantz spins to his men with fiery intensity
We are not losing one more of these civilians
Period
Am  making myself clear
() Let's move
The group jogs silently
- Nantz leads the group down the residential street, tidy bungalows on either side
You okay, bro
hadn't a pushed Cherise to get married, she'd still be in Chicago
Suddenly, Nantz stops, fist raised
The squad halts as
fades in, a deep
The marines    now, pulling the civilians down with them as the  continues to
Under the cars
Now
The marines frantically shed their packs, squirming with the civilians, pulling the kids under as

The mass of aliens  , the ground shaking,
The humans    , peering out to see the legs and arms of the aliens flying by
Some bound   , which bounce up and down,  with the aliens' weight
The   as the aliens disappear into the distance
- The squad moves in formation, surrounding the civilians
Little Kirsten comes up behind Correggio
He's surprised as she slips her hand into his
Correggio looks down, seeing how scared she is
He smiles, grips her hand tightly
Up ahead, Nantz leads,  in hand
How far, sergeant
One block over
Imlay smiles at Kerns
We'
re gonna make it
Dude, we're gonna make it
But as they approach a
Nantz stops, exchanges a glance with his corporals
What's the matter
The smell
An ominous beat
The squad moves down the dark street as
here from the sky
Like a beautiful early winter snow

We slowly    and  on Nantz
Until we are   '

Nantz stops, looking horrified
We  to see
rising into the night sky from that rage within the fence line of
As they approach the Forward Operating Base, the devastation is slowly revealed: -18  and   line the runways
and    litter the airfield
Jesus
They wiped our Forward Operating Base right off the map
Now we know why those bombs never dropped
They took our jets out
This was a dug-in marine Corps position that had armor, air and ground
Maybe we got nothing left to fight with
Michele
His look tells us everything-- '
Nantz turns, spies an    by the runways
Let's get under cover
Now
- The marines enter cautiously, rifles up
Then they hustle the civilians inside when it appears safe
Lock this place down
The marines fan out, securing doors, checking windows as
Nantz kneels by Hector, tries to comfort him
84
You're a brave kid
When this is over, you're going to be a hero
People always say that
"He's a hero
" () No one even knows what a hero is
Your dad was a hero
Hector just stares back
He saved Pvt
Adukwu up on that freeway
Hector exchanges a glance with Adukwu
Something passes between them
One man died so another could live
You save a marine under fire, you get a medal, y'know
Nantz pulls out a , the  of the 2/5 on it
This is our medallion
It's yours
For your dad
() You're 2/5 now, Hector
Hector takes the heavy medallion, looks it over, pointing to the 2/5  on it: What's that mean, "retreat hell
" During World War , an officer from our regiment was ordered to retreat
He said, "Retreat
Hell, we just got here
" Nantz is happy to see a slow smile from Hector now
Harris calls out: We're secure, sergeant
85
Nantz stands on this, addresses the marines: Listen up
We need ammo
Kerns, Adukwu stay with the civilians
The rest of us, let's move
Nantz puts a hand on Hector's shoulder
'll be right back
- Black plumes of  fill the night sky as Nantz and his men head silently toward the bodies of dead marines and aliens
The tarmac is a smoldering : Empty, bombed-out buildings on its outskirts, burning aircraft and vehicles litter the runways
Fires crackle
As they go, the marines rifle the pockets and pouches of their fallen comrades, pulling out any available ammo
whispers a low, heartfelt refrain to the dead marines he searches
Sorry, bro
He moves on to another fallen marine, searching
Sorry, bro
Across the runway, Nantz pulls ammo from the pouch of a dead marine
Then looking up, he sees
-25
Nantz moves to it
Then turns
from him and the marines look up
They hustle to Nantz
Everyone gives the  an excited once-over
Looks like it just rolled off the goddamn assembly line
Good job, Sergeant
86
( ) Can you drive this thing
Hell, if it's got an engine, sergeant,  can drive it
Good
Get it running
Seems like vehicles are targets
minivan's a target, Correggio with a Bushmaster chaingun
That's an asset
Imlay grins
Nantz motions to him, starting off
Come on
() Me
Where, sergeant
Nantz points to the  , its windows blown out
High ground
We need to see the big picture
- Kerns has a tub of ice cream, scooping bowls for the kids
My dad's a fireman
They love their ice cream
Used to visit the firehouse with my little brother, they always had tons of it
(re
the kids) My brother's not much older than these guys
You don't look much older, either
She gazes at the kids, pain and anger washing over her
87
Is this day ever going to end
Maybe the Sergeant'll find a way outta here
() What's with you guys anyway
Doesn't anybody have a first name
Emmanuel
Manny
Pete
You married
Family
'm single
Lots of family back in Nebraska, though
Hopefully they're safe
She shakes the thought away
What about you guys
Little Rock
Nigeria
came here to be a doctor
You should be a surgeon, the way you cut into that thing
Adukwu smiles
Then his smile fades as he looks around
Yeah
Maybe
- Nantz enters with Imlay
They look around
The  have been
The wind rustles papers through the ghostly space, blowing them out into the night
88
On one desk, a  is flashing a : Happy of someone's family vacation
From this, high vantage point, they can see for miles
Nantz looks out one end of the control tower, sees all the way to the ocean
Then he turns, looks the other way, dead east
vista of , spreading-into the distance engage -18s
One jet is blown up, spiralling to the ground
Look how far east they've gotten
That's almost the whole city
Nantz looks out through : Sees the   ablaze in the hills
Then pans to a mid-city area
Stops when he sees one quadrant of the city, blocks wide,  an
Some kind of    emanating from the ground
What the hell's that
Imlay peers out
There's zero activity there
And the area does seem completely devoid of activity-- No alien or human aircraft above it
Like a
What are we gonna do, Sergeant
Nantz, panning with the binoculars, sees a in the distance now
Nantz grabs a  on the desk, eyes roaming over it
Then looks back to where he saw the chopper
That must be the alternate extraction site
Maybe we can evacuate the civilians there
He turns to Imlay
89
Get them in the
'll radio for an evac helicopter
When do, they'll be coming, so we have to move fast
Think we can make it, Sergeant
We're gonna give it one helluva try, Imlay
He reassures the young marine with each-word: We're not dying here
- The marines, absent Nantz, surround the civilians protectively as they hustle them into the
-    - Nantz standing alone with a   looking out into the black night, wind blowing through the tower
The      below, engine running
Nantz takes a deep breath
Presses the button on the
() Any station, this is Foxtrot 2 November
have four civilians and seven marines, we're heading to Alternate Extraction Point Charlie
Requesting evacuation
say again, this is Foxtrot 2 November heading to Alternate Extraction Point Charlie
Out
Nantz turns immediately, hurrying out
- Nantz runs from the tower and climbs into the
90
- Nantz sees the civilians and marines crammed together in the back amid gear and guns
He turns to Stavrou behind the wheel
Use the thermal sight
No lights
Stavrou drives, spins away as Nantz climbs
He mans the -240
Imlay beside him on the 25MM Headlights off, running dark, Stavrou drives, peering through the
' Washed green, the city a war zone, massive destruction
An   winging toward the airport as
,     - The  moves fast in total darkness down a car-strewn street
Santa Monica Airport fading behind them, suddenly
-
Bright burst of light
And the Control Tower explodes in a ball of fire
- Nantz watches the alien drone fly off into the night
-  - Miles away, the  drives through a  , surrounded by  , the area a desolate wasteland now
- Stavrou drives, hands gripping the wheel as he maneuvers carefully through wrecked abandoned cars
91
Nantz eyes a nervous Imlay
Extract site's only a couple more miles, Imlay
Imlay nods back
Nantz peers down to
,
Eyes focusing tensely through the thermal sight scope
Green wash of the city passing by
Tall, empty buildings all around
Suddenly, a big   in the street
Stavrou
Civilians and marines in the tight passenger compartment are thrown around
Right in front of the
massive
The street's impassable
We gotta go around
The  backs up, Nantz scanning the sky, gripping the -240 machine gun, trying to see out into the darkness
Then they
And a is harrowing
hovering
Then turning
Flying toward them
Get ready, Imlay
Here they come
Stavrou looks out to see
in the distance
Think  see our ride, sergeant
Get us there
Cause we're about to get lit up
The alien drone ships are winging at them
They are only 200 meters out when
92
See what that Bushmaster can do, Imlay
Imlay   on the 25MM
Come on, you martian bastards
The Bushmaster is a rapid-firing  spewing 200 rounds a minute, each capable of destroying a light tank
For once, the aliens are overmatched
The   take from the Bushmaster
One goes down  , the others  , flying behind buildings
Where'd they go
Where'd they go
Nantz is scanning the sky, then
Imlay, on your six
Imlay spins in the turret, picking up
The three remaining   coming back around
The lead alien ship
,  next to the
Imlay rocks in the turret
Son of a
Imlay targets, fires the Bushmaster
The lead alien ship is , winging out of control The    into a building as

The last aircraft is hit

Stand on it, Stavrou
Stavrou pushes it,    the burning wreckage
Which is almost on top of the  as
Stavrou spins   , escaping
The wreckage explodes into a building behind them as
-  -
The sound of a -1'Medevac
The chopper
Nantz looks out, sees the   in the street
The  screeches up amid the  and
Last stop
Everybody out
The marines rush the civilians
Nantz and Imlay scrambling out last
Pretty decent shooting, Imlay
() Goddamn, you did it, sergeant
We're gonna get these people out
The marines begin loading the civilians in, the old-school hopping off to help the kids in
You are in the middle of the shit, Sergeant
Everything's been pulled back
What are you talking about
94
We've lost most of our air assets
We're abandoning Los Angeles
This city's done
(to the pilot) Let's go
The chopper powers up, Nantz   with the others
- The
As it rises, Nantz gazes out at the
He sees fires, wreckage everywhere
Then he looks off to see
Nantz watches the
But as it gets closer
The   precipitously, suddenly losing altitude
The kids
The marines hang on
Nantz sees the   with the controls
The '  are going crazy
The pilot    from the area, reversing course
And the helicopter
What the hell happened
Something there was playing hell with our power
Nantz stares at this
Then notices Hector watching
him
He sees the 2/5  clutched tightly in Hector's hand
Sees the words "Retreat Hell
" Nantz looks back at the    of cityscape
Then he turns to the crew chief
Set us back down
What
The other marines in Nantz' unit look over, alarmed now
95
We need to recon that area
We can't land
May not have power to take off again
Nantz looks out
Spies a  with a
He points to it
Then we'll rope down
What the hell, sergeant
What's going on
There's something over there
We could be the only ones left here to figure out what it is
(to the others) Let's go, marines
The marines look frightened, confused
They start to pull themselves up
are dropped from the chopper as it hovers over the building
Go
Go
The marines start to  , one after another as
Nantz exchanges a glance with Michele
They'll get you safe
He smiles at the girls
Then turns, nods at Hector
Puts a hand on his shoulder
See you soon, buddy
What are you gonna do
We're gonna fight
Nantz turns, grabs a , drops out of the chopper
96
- As the chopper hovers, Nantz drops to the roof, hunkers down with the other marines
Nantz watches the evac helicopter fly off to safety
Then he turns to the marines, who stare back hopelessly, clearly at their lowest point
Why'd we get off the chopper, Sergeant
'Cause we have a job to do
But we were getting out
You have some hunch and now we're stuck out here in the shit
That's right
This fight's not over
Sergeant's gonna get us killed
Just like my brother
beat
Nantz eyes Correggio
It's laid open now
Believe me, Correggio,  grieved for every marine  ever lost
Nantz looks around now, from marine to marine
But we are in the fight of our lives right now
And our duty is to keep moving forward
Keep fighting
That's how we honor men like your brother, Correggio
And Lt
Martinez
And Hector's father, who saved Adukwu's life
He wasn't trained for that
He just picked up a rifle and did what needed to be done
If a civilian can do that
() 97
(cont'd) Well then  better square my shit away and do whatever  have to do to defeat this enemy
But  can't do it alone
Nantz stares
The tension is palpable
need you men
And maybe we'll die fighting today
Not because we're heroes
But because we're goddamn United States marines, and always will be
() 'm willing to give my full measure for you
'm hoping you'll do the same for me
, glances exchanged
Sergeant
We'll follow you to hell and back
Nantz smiles, nods
Good
'Cause that's where we're going
- The squad is moving in unison, covering all around, approaching the
They jump in
- Stavrou fires it up, drives off as
Nantz eyes the jumble of gear
He grabs his  , a portable , which he makes sure is
Then an olive case marked:
He stuffs it in his pack
Laser target, sir
Might have to get some cruise missiles in here
Shit, yes, Sergeant
98
( ) Hostiles
Twelve o'clock
Nantz looks up to see
appearing on the street now
Nantz goes back to stuffing his pack
Just hit the gas, Corporal
We got plenty of armor
Everyone looks up at this
Then looks out to see
The aliens attacking,  on the  as
Stavrou floors it,   pinging off the 's armor as
Nantz looks out the back to see some
Reverse, Corporal
Aye, aye, Sergeant
As he  , mowing back over the remaining aliens
The marines cheer
- The  cruises slowly
Nantz stares forward
The    looms ahead
As they get closer, it seems like the whole area is absent of light
black hole
Nantz stares out, about to answer when the  , then lurches again
Stavrou  the engine
What's going on
Losing power, Sergeant
Gauges are dropping
losing voltage
The  slows
The engine skips
Then the

Stavrou
She's dead, Sergeant
Nantz looks around, warily
The streets are quiet, deserted
All right, dismount
Grab anything you think we can use
The men nod, and move     to
- Correggio and Kerns on one side of the street, Stavrou and Harris on the other
Imlay with Adukwu
Nantz watches his men move forward, covering each other's advance
Scanning' the buildings, searching for targets
Then Nantz halts them
They crouch together, peering at
The middle of the   just ahead of them
It is very dark
No lights are visible from any source
The men
Hot as hell here
No lights
My watch stopped
Something's generating heat
Messing with our electronics
Sucking up all the power
Nantz scans the street
The sweat dripping into his eyes
Where would you put a critical asset if you wanted to protect it
Or hide it
Underground
Nantz points to
100
- The squad runs to the subway entrance, stopping just inside
Harris, Adukwu, stay here, watch the street
Harris and Adukwu nod
Taking position at the entrance
Nantz motions to the others
Let's go
Nantz leads Stavrou, Correggio, Kerns and Imlay down the stopped escalator to the
Nantz stands, gazing around at the empty subway platform
Silent
Spooky
train is stopped
Doors open
It is dark, the only light bleeding in from the street above
He motions Stavrou to guard against anything coming from above
Then he moves forward with the others
huge number of  line the dark cavity above the train tracks, taking cover themselves, roosting quietly
Nantz sees a  in the tunnel wall, heads to it
He pulls his -  out, sticks the blade into the door jam, pops the
Nantz turns to Correggio and Kerns
() You two stay here, watch our backs
( ) Imlay, come with me
Nantz and Imlay slip through the doorway
- Nantz and Imlay stand very still, peering down the long, dark hall, looking for movement
Nantz motions and they move forward silently, guns ready
They turn a corner and stop
It is   here
Nantz clicks on his flashlight
They move forward
After only a few feet, the
Imlay clicks on his flashlight
101
() No
Save it
Something is killing anything electronic we use
Imlay clicks his flashlight
But now we see
dim light ahead
Nantz and Imlay creep forward, very slowly
Turn a corner, see
at the end of the hallway fiercely, as if it's shining through the floor
Nantz, silhouetted by the light, signals Imlay to stay put
Nantz steps forward, toward the strange glow of light
As he approaches, he realizes it's coming through
An   in the floor
Nantz moves to the grate, kneels,
Fifty feet wide, the dim tunnel has been further
It is a huge  now, extending off into the distance further than Nantz can see
The huge space is illuminated by
An
Tending the machinery:   , bigger than the others
One of the  , focusing up, right at Nantz
Nantz spins, runs back into the darkness
Calling to Imlay: Run, Imlay
Run
The iron   into the air
Nantz and Imlay, race along in the dark
They hear of the alien pursuing him
glimmer of  ahead
Along the floor
It is, a
They burst through a , into

Nantz follows Imlay    as
The   below is
Nantz spins, swinging his shotgun
The blast  the huge , filling the stairwell with its horrible bulk
Nantz backs up the stairs, pumping the shotgun, firing
Each blast    in a
The alien moves up the stares
Nantz
The    in the enclosed space
Then the
And we're left
Imlay clicks on his , revealing
The  at Nantz' feet, its strange "hand" on his boot
Nantz, terrified, aims at the alien, waiting to see if it will move
It doesn't
- Nantz and Imlay re-enter, running up to join the others
Up the stairs, by street-level, Harris and Adukwu keep watch
Harris motions: " "
Nantz nods
Signals for all the marines to head down the stairs
The marines gather around Nantz
To Harris: How many
Hard to tell
lot
think  got their attention
Nantz kneels
He opens his pack, pulls out the radio and the case marked
Look
There's something big down in the tunnels
It's sucking up a lot of power, could be a major Command &
Control asset
103
Nantz stares at his men
We need to destroy it
But we got no jets left, right, Sergeant
Hopefully, they can still fire cruise missiles from Pendleton or Vandenburg
'll radio in a strike, paint the target from the street
You know what that means
The man nod solemnly
We gotta hold 'em off long enough to paint the target
If we can get a transmission out before the radio dies
And the targeting laser lasts long enough for command to get a lock on the target
Hell, dying's easy, ladies
Everything else takes balls, right
They all laugh softly
Let's do it
He takes a deep breath, raises the radio, and : () Any station, this is Foxtrot 2 November
Priority Fire Mission have identified a major enemy command and control asset-- located grid 459083

) Foxtrot 2
You have visual confirmation of this & asset
We can't waste resources
Affirmative
They're building a huge complex underground
think it's the head of the snake
Repeat
will be
Alien fire  now, rocking the station
Nantz and the marines cover their heads as the station starts to come apart, chunks of concrete fall
The walls crack
Dust fills the air
Nantz  as a chunk of concrete
Then, it's over
All is silent
Nantz,  in , strains to lift the concrete chunk off his ankle
He
The marines rise
Pale, sweating, Nantz hobbles to his feet
He slings his rifle, and carrying the , hurries on his bad ankle to the stairs
Nantz looks up
Rubble nearly fills the stairway
There is only a small opening of daylight near the ceiling
The men all unclip their web gear, begin climbing
- chunk of rubble falls from the pile at the subway entrance, and Nantz emerges, rolling down the pile to the street
The other marines follow, set up a perimeter as
,
Nantz takes cover behind a berm of rubble,  down, flattening himself to the ground
He sets the  ( ) up on top of the pile
Nantz removes his flack jacket and places it over the laser designator
( ) Here we go
105
Nantz switches on the
shoots from the designator to a fixed point in the center of the street
Nantz looks up to see
The street fill with   rushing out now
Here they come
The marines      ,   on the aliens as
The mass of aliens surges forward like a wave
Hold them back
We have to keep the laser on target
Nantz
An alien goes down
He picks another target and
The alien staggers, keeps coming
Three more rounds and the alien goes down
But the rest
closing in
Nantz is picking his targets
,
Turning, finding targets, reloading, the aliens getting closer
Then his rifle runs dry
pulls his sidearm
He aim, , shooting a closing alien in its 'heart
' It drops
Rounds impact around Nantz as he shoots another alien
Then the next
The next
Then his sidearm is out of bullets as
An  rips near Nantz
Knocking the laser away
Nantz struggles
- it as
The marines are pushed into a   around the laser
Fighting nearly back to back
106
Kerns is
He is thrown to the ground, but is back up, arm bleeding, firing
An alien    who spins just in time, repeatedly until the alien goes down
Stavrou swings his rifle butt,  another alien
It staggers back
Stavrou puts numerous rounds into it
An alien reaches , knocking him to the ground, about to blast him
Harris runs the alien through with his bayonet, twisting and firing his rifle at the same time
The alien falls
The marines are
All focused on
Imlay notices the laser beam is gone
Did we get a lock
don't know
Then
An ear-splitting
The marines look up, see
Nantz looks up at his men, yelling: Fall back
This way
Nantz and his men begin
Firing as they do, trying to hold off the aliens
Nantz, limping on his injured ankle,
Correggio is there to help him up
Think you just twisted your ankle,
sir
And through it all, Nantz still smiles at this
Don't stop
We're too close to the impact point
The marines start running as
107
,
The first missile strikes
Then another
and another
piercing  sounds
Nantz looks into the sky as
Suddenly
2000 pound laser-guided explodes
of fire and smoke erupting from beneath the surface
as
Buildings shatter, cars are tossed, flames erupt
Then  descends a moment
Only the crackle of flames, falling glass
The dust and ash settles in a grey haze
Nothing could have survived this
Then
out of the grey destruction
, the men rise out of the ash, standing tall
The marines fall in
with Nantz at its center
They move forward
Precise
Deadly
The seven remaining marines   on the mass of aliens
The Drone Ships fall from the sky,  on the ground
The aliens, in disarray, are mowed down
The rest
And as the smoke drifts away, there is silence again
Nantz looks up to see
108
His warriors
Standing with smoking weapons, ready for more
Correggio staggers up, covered in dust, bloody
You know what, Sergeant
My brother said you were a bad ass
() had no idea
Your brother was one helluva marine, Correggio
( ) So are you
: Nantz sits in the rumbling chopper
Surrounded by his marines
Imlay stares out at the city below
Man, it's quiet
(
0
) They're in full retreat throughout Los Angeles, heading back into the ocean
Units are mopping up
On this, Nantz turns to his
Beat
This has been a hell of a battle
Plenty of other battles to go
Everybody good with that
The marines don't hesitate
Yes, Sergeant
Well, uh, actually, Sergeant
there's this girl  was supposed to meet up with tonight
() 'm sure she'll understand
Nantz looks at his marines
109
think you men earned the right to call yourselves marines today
'm damn proud of every one of you
Retreat
