"Assassins", early draft, by Larry & Andy Wachowski Written by Larry and Andy Wachowski August 12, 1994 : We know that we are looking at something because its polished surface shimmers with light
, other squares are revealed; the black and white tiles of a chess board
The board rises and spins, slipping beneath us we find ourselves   the board,   a chess game
The pieces are everywhere, checking and covering other pieces
It has reached that critical moment when pieces are traded and the board begins to clear as two strategies unravel towards a final outcome
Standing above the pieces around him, we see the black king
We    his face,   his chiseled ebony features,   we are staring into his cold black eyes
: -  - The red setting sun is reflected in the black lens
Two men are tromping through the calf-deep mud of an end- less marsh
It is fall, the first frost not far away and the foliage is brown and bare
With the red-orange ball of fire melting into the horizon, the two men at first appear as only silhouettes or shadows slogging through the mire
The man with the sunglasses walks behind the other man
He is very well-dressed in a dark suit
22 caliber gun, fitted with a long silencer, dangles from his hand
His name is
The other man is
He is also wearing a very expensive suit though it is being destroyed by the brambles and mud
As he lifts his foot his Gucci shoe is sucked off by the mud
Aw-shit
He balances on one leg, holding his silk-socked foot in the air
He looks at the shoe, already filling with mud
He looks at Rath
How much farther
Just a little ways
Up to those trees
About a half mile further into the thickening marsh there is a small cluster of trees
Oh, fuck it
He pulls his sock off and plunges his foot into the mud
He smiles
It feels good
He hurls the sock
Lifting his other foot he pulls his shoe off and hurls that
He grabs for the other sock, struggling to get it off, laughing at himself as he slips and falls into the mud
Rath waits, a faint smile
He manages to get the sock off and then stands digging both feet into the dark, wet earth
Hey, this feels kinda good
They move on, Ketcham almost playing, sinking his feet deep pulling them out to make a ,
Hey, do you mind if  talk a little
feel like,  don't know, talking  guess
Sure
Funny, 've never been a talker
My wife was always getting on me about that
'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me
' never would though
Not really
Why not
don't know
Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do
'   don't know
Maybe didn't trust her
He picks up a handful of mud and begins shaping it like a snowball
My Margaret
loved her but you know what
cheated on her
All the time
don't even know why
It wasn't the sex, Margaret was great in bed
think if  wasn't married  wouldn't have even looked at some of those women
knew she couldn't trust me, so how could trust her
If she was here right now 'd think that  would tell her that  was sorry
'course, if she were here right now, maybe wouldn't feel like talking
He throws the mud ball at the grove of trees but they are too far
think 've heard of you
It's possible
You're pretty famous aren't you
hope not
know this may seem like a strange question, but can  ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything,  know you're a professional, but just for me,  was just wondering
It's a common question
Oh yeah
guess we still need to see that price tag
Like art, right
You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle
dime
One hundred thousand
That's it
Jesus
Is that a lot
Average
Shit
oh well
Ketcham laughs
have been thinking about this for a long while
knew this day was coming
knew someday someone would make the call on me
never thought about anyone that had whacked
What do you call it anyway
Taken
'Taken
'  That's nice
When  had someone taken  would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as  hung up the phone  forgot about them
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules
That's exactly what  told myself
Ketcham laughs again
He is getting kind of giggly, like he's high
always wondered what 'd be thinking at this exact moment imagined that  would be thinking about the fucker who contracted this, trying to figure out who it was
Something occurs to him and he looks back at Rath
Don't know
That's how it works
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that
Right
thought that  would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that 'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but 'm not
'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but  can't
It seems very funny to me
What are you thinking about
'm thinking about Moonpies
Ain't that funny
haven't had a Moonpie since  was ten years old
Right now, 'm thinking how much 'd love one
And an
He's 'laughing' and Rath laughs with him
Ketcham suddenly stops laughing
They are nearly to the cluster of trees
Can  ask you something
Go ahead
What do other guys do
He looks at the trees, his voice dying in the
Everyone handles it differently
Some are ready, some are not
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying
Some
When  thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying
It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me
It was something that  could never get away from
but now,  feel it's okay
feel good
Can  ask you a question
Anything
Why didn't you fade
You mean quit
Yeah
used to think about it
had Margaret
She wanted kids thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe
could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but  couldn't see that next part
'Then what
' So 'd stop thinking about it and go back to work
You understand
Yeah
Ketcham smiles and looks around at the grove of birch trees
always pictured that  would end in some land fill, under someone else's garbage
kept picturing those plastic diapers filled with some baby's green shit, covering me
But this is nice
He looks at the sun, bloody red seeping into the black horizon
Look at that
haven't watched the sun set in a million years
Do you mind
No
Ketcham stares at the last of the light
Nice
real nice
With his face hidden from Rath he begins to cry
Rath watches Ketcham staring at the setting sun
Rath looks down at the gun limply held in his hand
When the sun is gone, a red glow at the bottom of a dark- ening sky, we hear the , , , then the After a beat we hear Ketcham is lying face down, already sinking into the mud, a red cloud mushrooming around his head like the red haze left by the dying sun
Rath breathes in deep and lets the air out slowly, stand- ing alone in the middle of nowhere
- The room is dark and still
man is standing at a wall of windows that glow from the amber wash of urban light
Snow is falling, heavy white flakes glittering in the city's electric night
The man finishes his bourbon,   in the empty glass
He is slightly drunk and he sways forward until his forehead rests against the window
In the dim light, we recognize the man as Rath
Outside there is a beautiful stone church decorated for Christmas
He watches the snowflakes drift to the distant street below
He is wondering what it would feel like to let himself fall, when there is a  at the door
Crossing the room, he opens the door
Backlit by the bright hallway light is a
She has already removed her coat and though she is only a silhouette we can see that her dress is very short and very tight
() Hi
Did you call -- Yes
Please come in
Her    against the tile foyer as she enters and he takes her coat
Goodness, it's so dark
She reaches for the wall switch but he stops her
prefer it like this
How can a beautiful man like you be shy
He smiles
prefer it, that's all
She moves closer to him, the sexual confidence of her body radiating like heat
It's okay, honey
We can do it anyway you want
Rath is obviously uncomfortable
Would you like a drink
'd love one
Whatever you're having
They move into the room, from a distance, as featureless as two shadows
She stands at the windows watching the snow-bubble of a city night
Beautiful
He hands her the drink
Her smile is bright and perfect
Good will towards men
Their glasses clink as he drains half his drink
If she drinks at all, we can not tell
Why are you working today
Holidays are our busiest days
No one likes to be alone on holidays
know  don't
She touches his face, the caress and her expression of tenderness seemingly genuine
You're very good at this aren't you
think you're supposed to answer that question
Her hand slides down his chest, but before it goes any farther Rath turns away, returning to the bar
know what you expect, but don't want
He pours himself another drink
That's okay, hon,  always expect the unexpected
called because  just want need to talk
She sits on the couch, her body language changing, as she becomes a listener
've been thinking about my life, about things  have done
What do for a living is in some ways similiar to what you do
He sits on the other end of the couch, his words thickened by the alcohol
know that everything has a price
want you to understand that 'm willing to pay
He takes out an envelope and puts it between them
She picks it up, glancing inside at a stack of hundred dollar bills
For what
Honesty
She puts the envelope down
just want to ask you some questions
Uncomfortable, she waits as he searches his drink for the right words
Do you ever regret things you've done
Everyone regrets something
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them
Sometimes
Do you think about their wives or their families
No
They call me,  don't call them
If they didn't call wouldn't exist
Rath nods
His next question is barely audible
Do you ever think about starting over
All the time
Can you tell me about it
For the first time we really see her take a drink
She closes her eyes
Sometimes  dream that  meet a man, this good, honest man and we fall in love
imagine us living on a boat, reading books, sailing to places where no one knows who we were or cares what we did
She opens her eyes and looks at him
And what if you never meet that man
She smiles
Then, 'll sail alone
Do you believe that
Are you asking me if  believe in another life
Rath nods
have to
She finishes her drink
Is that all you want
Yes
She picks up the money and stands
Thank you
Anytime
- It is the same room but now it is very cluttered, room service trays and empty liquor bottles tossed about
He has been here for a while
He is sitting at the table, staring intensely at a chess game; we see the board and all of the pieces set in the same positions as in the opening sequence
He rubs at the whiskers that have darkened his face and then finishes off another bottle of bourbon
He flings the empty bottle across the room as he reaches over the board and moves one of white knights, taking a black rook
sequence begins, obvious, and he works through it moving both the black and white pieces
Suddenly he stops
He gets up and shifts to the other side of the board, studying the game from white's perspective
Another sequence emerges and he trades the pieces through it as he moves around the table, returning to his place behind the black king
The games reaches its end as black is check-mated
He slumps down onto the table and looks across at the white king
Fuck you, Nick
- Rath is at a desk where he has set up his computer office; a cellular phone is plugged into a modem with cables winding through a scrambler and then into a fax machine and the latest high-powered lap-top computer
On the table near the desk, we see the
22, dismantled and cleaned, spread out on a white towel
He types in a complicated access code sequence, then waits, staring at the blank screen
/ Where have you been, Robert
/ Sick
The flu
/ don't believe you
don't give a fuck -- / It's true
/ have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts -- / need a rest
/ That's impossible, Robert
You're at the top of your field
These are the best contracts
To stop now would be self-destructive
He looks away from the screen and sees the chess game on the table
/ Send the file
'll have the estimate tonight
/ 'm worried about you, Robert
You fucking should be -- / Don't be
On the screen the word "Transmitting" appears
Rath slowly gets out of his chair
The    and  to life as a photograph of a smiling, old Italian man curls onto the desk
Rath begins destroying the hotel room, smashing anything he can get his hands on
- Rath is in the middle of the room which he has demolished
Having showered and shaved, he is now standing naked, in the midst of the rubble, practicing the slow and graceful art of Tai Chi
- Rath is working at the desk
He is tallying numbers, materials, totaling his estimate
Spread out over the table are several faxed photos of the old Italian, Leevio Valli, usually surrounded by bodyguards
The file details Valli's life and his daily routine
It includes:  phone bills, credit card and bank account statements, driver license and vehicle registration, the real estate listing of his house and even a copy of his income tax return
Satisfied with his figures, Rath plugs the phone into the modem and makes a call
The network comes on-line as the General Contractor types: / You're too late, Robert
Rath types
/ What
/ The contract was stolen
Rath stares at the screen
/ Who
/ new player
He's using the name Nicholai
The name hits Rath and he sits, unable to breathe
/ You know what must be done
The screen goes black as the network shuts down
Rath looks down at the pile of assembled facts
He lifts a credit card bill on which the name of a restaurant appears every Friday
The name of the restaurant has been circled in red pen by Rath:  "Trattoria Roma
" - red awning spans the entrance of a popular Italian restaurant
It is a large establishment with many tables and booths
The dinner crowd is a mix of yuppies and older Italian families who have been eating here for years
Rath is sitting alone at a booth
With very subtle changes to his appearance, he looks like an older Italian
In front of him is a glass and a carafe of dark red wine
He touches neither of them
His eyes shift as he studies the room
pushes into the restaurant surrounded by five gorillas in Italian suits
The owner hurries to greet them, hugging, kissing, speaking only Italian
The entourage moves through the restaurant to the over- sized booth in the back
Rath does not look twice at them
Immediately he is watching everyone else, looking for the other assassin
Leevio slides into the booth as his goons stand and sit around the table, obscuring him from all parts of the room
wine steward immediately brings a bottle of red wine and fills their glasses
pretty waitress sets a steaming loaf of garlic bread out and a giant bowl of minestrone in front of Leevio
He tells her something and she giggles
They joke in Italian, watching her ass as she wiggles back to the kitchen
At Leevio's table the wine steward returns to fill their glasses
It is the goon standing against the wall that is the first to realize that it is not the same wine steward
He is the second assassin, much younger than Rath
His name is He smiles
The goon reaches for his gun as -- Bain  the  of wine into his face
He screams
Leevio coughs a spray of minestrone, as a  flashes free from the white linen towel hung over the steward's arm
It happens instantly
and the goons are dead
Leevio screams
Don't
,  and
Leevio's body falls forward and softly thuds on the table
Bain whips around drawing a small - from his belt expecting an attack
Facing the screaming crowd, he begins to  anyone who moves or stands, men or women
There is chaos in the restaurant
People scream, falling to the ground, scrambling under tables
Bain is sweating, his eyes shifting wildly from one end of the room to the other
The restaurant falls quiet except for several people who are sobbing
He moves through the room, watching, searching
Don't anybody move
You move, you're dead
He passes the table Rath was sitting at, but it is empty
Come on, you chicken shit motherfucker
know you're here
Let's go
Across the street from Trattoria Roma, Rath jacks together a German assault rifle with night scope
Bain looks out the window at the dark street
He turns and searches through the people huddled on the floor
He aims his gun
You
Get up
quivering wine steward stands
He points to another
You, too
Up
the   we see the front door to the restaurant open and a group of wine stewards clumped together slowly back out
Bain is second from the end, both guns aimed at the stewards
One of them begins to cry
Not yet
Don't move or you're fucking dead
Rath moves the scope back and forth, unable to pick out the assassin
Shit
Just do them all
All of them
Shit
He can't pull the trigger
The group moves toward the street
Now run
Like dogs out of the gate, they bolt
Rath watches as they scatter, finding Bain in his scope
chunk of   from the wall just behind Bain's head as he drops behind the row of parked cars along the curb
He laughs
We get the idea that Bain is enjoying this
Rath looks over his scope, talking to himself
He is sweating
Shit
What are you doing, old man
You're too fucking slow
He looks back into the scope and begins scanning the line of cars
Okay
Which one
Which one is yours
Bain is crawling alongside the tightly parked cars, staying low and out of sight
He works his way up to a black Mercedes that is parked illegally next to a fire hydrant and takes out his keys
He hits the remote unlocking the doors
Rath finds the fire hydrant in his scope, almost obscured by the parked Mercedes
Amateur
He takes aim
Just as Bain starts to open the door, the front Another second, the back
Fuck
Rath waits, steely calm, his finger on the trigger
Your move
Bain hears the growing wail of
Thinking for a moment, he opens the car door and pulls a long handled switchblade and a roll of electrician's tape from the glove compartment
Rath sees the car light go on, but can't make out what Bain is doing
The  are
There's a lot of them
Bain finishes taping the knife to his forearm and rolls his shirt sleeve down
From his pocket he takes out a Gameboy and begins playing "Tetris
" Rath watches as the police cars come racing down the street
The   to a halt in front of the restaurant
The  jump out, drawing their weapons
Bain throws his guns down, raising his hands in the air
Don't shoot
Don't shoot
give up
More  come  up as the two officers hold their beads on Bain
Hit the ground
Face down
Spread your legs
Bain follows the orders as the second cop edges up to him, frisking him
In this position the Cop is unable to find the knife strapped to Bain's forearm, but finds the Gameboy
Hey, don't touch that
Shut up
The Cop twists Bain's arms behind his back, handcuffing him tightly
They drag him to his feet, a swarm of police and paramedics in the street
Rath holds them in his cross hairs as they move to the police car, but is unable to get a clean shot
Bain is using the cops for cover, keeping his head low
Son of a bitch
The Cops shove Bain into the back seat
Rath very quickly walks to his car, tossing his gun into the trunk
He gets in and  the
The two Officers are outside the car talking with the sergeant
Bain, laying low beneath the windows, peeks up at the shadowy parking garage
He smiles
The two Policemen get in the car, the second picking up the radio
The driver  the  and the black and white  down the street
#2 This is 181, returning with suspect involved in multiple shooting at Trattoria Roma
Repeat, en route with suspect
He hangs up the radio and looks back at Bain through the metal caging
#2 Jesus Christ, do you know who you shot in there
Bain almost laughs
#2 What are you
Some kind of a hitman
Bain looks out the window
#2 You know what we call guys like you
Bain looks at him
#2 Sizzle lean
They're gonna fry your ass
He laughs at his own joke, looking at his partner, who chuckles
Rath's car races down the street trying to catch up with the patrol car
Bain stares out the window, silent
Behind his back, he takes hold of his left thumb with his right hand
The Cop is playing with the Gameboy
With a quick jerk, he yanks the thumb out of its socket
His expression remains perfectly blank
The thumb hangs unnaturally from the hand
The skin stretches strangely as he pulls the metal cuff from his wrist
The Cop turns as the   and Bain sticks the knife through the wire mesh, into the cop's eye font of blood arcs onto the windshield
Grabbing hold of the driver's shirt collar, Bain jabs the blade into the back of his neck
The driver screams trying to pull free of Bain's grip
He slams on the brakes, groping for his gun and the out of control
Bain stabs the Cop again, his    as -- The patrol car starts to flip and roll
' Rath turns as he hears an , several blocks away
The   as he makes a hard right
Orange flames lick up from the belly of the overturned patrol car
Oil black clouds billow into the night sky
Rath's car cruises past
Rath sees the back seat window shattered, kicked out
Bain is gone
'm not done yet
brand new cab is sitting at a red light
The cabby looks into the rearview mirror, as a pair of headlights roll up behind him
The car gets closer, the lights brighter; they don't stop
He shrieks as the    , The cabby jumps out, rattling off a string of obscenities
Rath gets out of the white car, starting to apologize, as the cabby moves toward him
When he's close enough, Rath decks him, knocking him unconscious
He picks him up and puts him in the white car
Rath then gets in the cab and when the light changes to green, he drives off
Rath circles the area, turning up the cab's
couple of   through the speaker, before he hears what he's waiting for; an airport fare in this area
At the intersection of Adams and Nine
He picks up the mike
This is 1242
got it
It is a deserted intersection
The buildings are dark and some of the street lights are out
The cab sits by itself,  , its taillights glowing through the exhaust
Rath holds his gun cocked beneath his coat
His other hand grips the door handle
As he waits, watching the intersection, he notices the cabby's  pinned to the dashboard
Leaving the gun in his jacket, he reaches for the  card
He rips it from the dash and as he drops it under the seat, the door behind him opens
Someone gets in and closes the door
Rath peers into the rearview mirror
It is Bain
For the first time we realize that the front and back of the cab is separated by an inch of bullet proof glass
There is an awkward silence as Rath sits, unsure
Bain looks at him
Is there a problem
No
No problem
The airport, right
Right
The cab pulls out of the intersection
Rath studies Bain
There is a thin line of blood down his temple
Bain is oblivious to it and pulls out his Gameboy, resuming his game of Tetris
How'd you cut yourself
Their voices are distorted through the small electric amplifier set in the bullet proof glass near the metal money exchanger
Bain touches the blood on his forehead, looking at it a bit surprised
Oh
Working
little accident
He wipes it off as best he can
You a waiter
You look like a waiter
Bain is uninterested
Yeah
Yeah, 'm a waiter
Where
What
What restaurant
Uh, Fontella's So you're from around here
No
No 'm not
Bain is getting agitated
Where you from
What is this
Not too good at small talk, eh
Look, 'm real tired and 'm not interested in fucking chit-chat
know just what you mean
'm pretty beat myself
Silence
Since you looked like a waiter, had to ask what restaurant because of what happened at the Trattoria Roma
Bain looks up
Why
What happened
Didn't you here all them sirens
It's been all over the radio
Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma
No shit
Yeah, it's terrible
mean Valli, and  don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook
He probably had it coming, but all the other people
Real sad
Yeah
But they caught the guy
heard it all
Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco
Shooting anybody
Drugs, probably
Probably
'd love to sit in that jury
Send that
right to the chair
Bain allows himself a bemused smile
Sizzle lean
The cab passes the intersection for the airport
Bain sits up
What are you doing
What
That was Peterson back there
That goes to the expressway for the airport
You're right
Talking too much again
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal
What
You think 'm running you up
Just do your job
Rath pulls over and slaps the cab in park
What are you doing
Get out
You think 'm running you up
Get out
You can't -- The hell  can't
It's my cab don't like you
So, get the hell out
Bain can't figure out what is wrong, when he sees the dashboard and the missing
Their eyes meet in the rearview mirror
Holy fucking shit
The cab rocks as both men move
Instantly guns fill their hands
Bain ripping out a
357 lifted from one of the dead cops
Rath rolls to the side whipping the gun free from his jacket
Bain throws open the door, about to run, but stops
He looks at Rath
He wants him to run
Anyone who moves away from the bullet proof glass is dead
Both men are silent, each holding the other in their gun sights
Bain blinks, sweat forming on his lip
get out, you got me
Bain reaches over and closes the door
He smiles knowing it is the right move
Now what
Rath calmly uncocks his gun
We're both going to the airport
Bain nods
Sit back
Put your seatbelt on
No fucking way
Okay, don't
Bain thinks
If either of us fucks around, the other can blow the fuel line
He points his gun at the floor where the fuel line runs
Bain sits back, aiming his gun, watching Rath
Rath eases back into the driver's seat, also holding his gun on the fuel line
He puts the car into drive and slides back into traffic, turning back towards Peterson
They sit in silence, studying each other, when they hit the expressway
Bain can't contain himself, giddy on adrenaline
Jesus -- 'm being driven to the airport by Robert Rath
He laughs
can't believe this
You rolled some cabby for the radio, then waited for an airport fare
He laughs again
Boy, that's fucking genius
You're a fucking genius
Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me
Man, no way  coulda done that
What's your name
We both know it's not Nicholai
Holy shit
Robert Rath wants to know my name
He leans back
This is a big moment for him
Bain
Michael Bain
How long have you been freelance
Two years
Two long fucking years
Something occurs to him and he leans close to the window
Hey
What  don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant
mean you had me, a free shot
That's what  would have done
It's just a shoot-out then
Sixty- forty, at best
Not my odds
Sounds like chickenshit -- He laughs hard
Listen to me calling you chickenshit
He stops laughing and looks closely at the back of Rath's head
Is that a wig
Shit,  hate wigs
Wigs are the worst part of this job
'd rather dye my hair than wear a wig
Rath studies him
You're wearing a wig now
Bain chokes on his laugh
God damn are you good
Everyone says you're so fucking good
just can't believe 'm still alive
If believed in God, 'd be down on my knees
Right now -- Hey, how come you just didn't plug us all when we came through the door
Rath does not answer
Bain smiles
He knows something about Rath now; he doesn't like killing innocent people
Shit if  was you, back there -- He holds his gun up to the bulletproof glass behind Rath's head
Game over
He laughs
Do you mind if  ask you a couple of business questions
You know  was wondering how much you bid this job at
Rath says nothing
You don't have to tell me that
It's just,  know my bid was low, but was it too low
mean, did seem like an amateur, like  didn't know what  was doing
We both know what you were doing
Bain moves close to the glass again, checking out Rath's gun
Smith and Wesson
22 with an eight inch silencer
Classic
When first heard you used that, thought, shit, that's a lady's gun
Now, it's all  use
Clean, real clean
He looks at the gun, still trained at the floor
Would you really blow us
Rath does not have to answer
Oh
got a question
Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me
sound like some fucking fanboy
'm sorry, but just got to ask you
Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov -- Tachlinkov
Yeah, that's it
And he's like a fucking genius
They said he shaded you over and over
And in the end, he aced you again
Shaded and faded
They say he's living on some Greek island, but  say that's fucking bullshit
say you're the best and that you planted his ass
Am  right
Rath says nothing
bet 'm right
The car passes under a sign indicating the ramp for the Cleveland airport
Robert Bain, driving me
Jesus fucking Christ
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland
Who the fuck cares about Cleveland
Cleveland blows
What kind of marks have they got here
Greasy mobster, teamster or some hand job politician
want the money marks
want the marks that you get
long beat of silence
The   up onto the "departures" ramp which circles past all of the terminals
So what happens now
We go around once
Bullshit
He throws off his seatbelt
You tell me that we're gonna go around once, then, while 'm checking out the lay of the land, you bail out and send me flying over the bridge
Right
Am  right
Rath doesn't answer, studying the terminals, noting the police and airport security
Rath studies the terrain
Bain studies Rath
Soon they have passed the entire airport
Rath nods
Steering the car through traffic in onto a circle interchange that will bring them to the beginning
Bain wipes the sweat from his face
Okay
What
What's okay
Rath begins to accelerate, rounding the interchange
What are you doing
There's a sand barricade up ahead; 'm going to ram this cab into it
The cab has an airbag, odds are good 'll survive
But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good
Bain laughs
Oh man, that's sweet
That's fucking sweet
The speedometer continues to climb
You're bluffing
Rath says nothing
Ahead, at the ramp to the terminals, is the sand barricade
You're fucking with me
You want me to jump
jump, you hit the brakes and bang -- Game over
The cab is flying at its target
No, no
Wait
You don't want me to jump
You're going to jump
'm stuck back here until it's too late
Wham -- over
know you're going to jump
Bain looks at him and then at the barricade
You're still young
Young enough to still think you're indestructible
Invincible
You believe with utter certainty you can bail out at the last second and survive
The barricade hurtles toward them, rising up, filling the windshield
If you do survive, we'll see each other again
Bain screams, throwing open the door and hurling himself out
Rath jams on the brakes,  , steering into the steel side rail, banking the car into the drums of sand as -- Bain hits the pavement, bouncing like a stone skipped across water
driver hits his brakes, swerving, just missing him
from the impact and the cab bounces up over the median into the bus-only lanes as the driver's airbag balloons out of the steering wheel
Bain rolls and rolls, finally stopping sprawled out like a piece of roadkill
The cab careens up onto a curb, slamming into a pole, the radiator spitting out a cloud of
Several cars lock up and collide to avoid Bain; one car stopping inches from him
woman jumps out, rushing to the front of the car, but Bain is gone
Police   up into the midst of the accident
One of them pulling alongside the demolished cab
The door is open, the airbag popped
Rath is gone
- large six flat leans out from a hill in San Francisco
'  - The apartment is always dark; heavy drapes cover the windows
The dining and living rooms look like the control booth of a network television show, stacks of video monitors and consoles, cables, electric wiring, coils of fiber optic cord duct-taped to the floors, walls and ceilings
They snake through holes punched in the plaster walls and hang everywhere like some technological jungle
At the center of this tangled web is , a beautiful athletic looking woman wearing only her underwear and a worn robe
She is curled up in an overstuffed chair, a bowl of popcorn in her lap
On the monitors, she is watching what at first might be mistaken for a soap opera; a young couple are having an argument
What is strange is that the angle never changes; a fish- eye lens staring down into the room
(
) don't give a shit what your mother thinks
'm not sleeping with your mother, 'm sleeping with you
(
) You won't be for long, with that attitude
(
) Jesus, Jennifer, if you're so god damned worried about your mother's approval, why don't you move back home so she can pat you on the head when you do something right
Jerk
Jennifer is too stunned to say anything
There is a long pause that is not at all like television
It seems very real
She starts to say something, but stops, trying to keep herself from crying
(
) Oh good
Go ahead and cry
() (
) Would you please leave
Electra lifts her head, smelling the air
Mmm, smell that, Nikita
Nikita, Electra's black cat, is stretched lazily across the top of a chair, her tail twitching absently
Every corner of the chair has been clawed open
Electra reaches for the control board and throws a series of switches
The monitors flicker as the image changes
We are now looking down into a kitchen
stove is beneath us, almost like a cooking show, where a round woman is taking out a tray of chocolate chip cookies
Electra smells them again, smiling as she inhales
hope she saves some for us
There is a , a   in another apartment, and a
Electra switches back to Jennifer's apartment
The man is still in the living room, but Jennifer is gone
(
) Do you think slamming doors is going to help work this out
Electra punches a command into a keyboard
Several of the screens change, showing different rooms of the same apartment
Jennifer is in the bedroom, lying on the bed sobbing, her face buried in a pillow
(
) can slam doors too
We hear the front   in the hall outside of Electra's apartment and through the monitor speakers
His stomping   as he storms down the hall and staircase out of the building
Electra switches all of the screens to Jennifer
She watches and listens to her cry alone in her bedroom
Electra reaches out; her fingers lightly touch the monitor screen
Electra's front door opens slowly
Timidly, she steps out of her apartment and walks down the hall until she is standing in front of Jennifer's door
She starts to knock, but stops herself
She isn't sure she should do this
She paces, then turns to the door
She knocks, so softly it's almost impossible to hear
She stands, trying to force herself to knock again, when she hears Jennifer
(
) Hello
Ken, is that you
Electra panics
The door knob turns, the door opens and  looks out into the hall
It is empty
' On the monitors, Electra watches Jennifer pick up the phone
(
) Hi, Mom, it's me
Ken and  just had a big fight
Electra's  suddenly
She shuts down the screens and pulls out the pager, checking the number
Crap
' There is a system set up that is not unlike Rath's system; all of the same components, though the equipment is bigger, more powerful and less portable
On a table there is a bank of phones, several cellular
Electra is talking on one
(
) Electra, they are not paying you to sit at home and watch television
Electra is fiddling with five plastic computer disks; each has a MicroCell trademark and is labeled "Back-Up
" wasn't watching television
(
) The point is, they are paying for information
Real information
Not tooth paste brands
Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper
And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex
You are wasting everyone's time with this shit
thought it was interesting -- (
) God damnit, Electra
This is not a game
This is business
Right
In my hands  have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night
(
) Jesus
Why didn't you tell me
'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus
(
) Electra -- pleasure doing business with you
She hangs up
Electra comes down the stairs
Outside the large glass door she sees , Jennifer's boyfriend, leaving
On the lobby floor is a letter, apparently slipped under the door, addressed to Jennifer Morgan
Electra looks out the front door window, making sure that Ken is gone
She picks up the letter and stuffs it into her pocket
- Rath is at his computer system
He is staring at it, like it is a living thing, a person that he despises, the blank screen reflecting his own face
It is an effort to bring himself to touch the keyboard, to type in his code
He waits
/ Hello, Robert
Rath wants to type something but hesitates
/ know what happened
bet you fucking know
/ It cost us
Rath jumps out of his chair, screaming at the screen
give a fuck
'm done
quit
Do you fucking hear me
'm fucking gone
/ He stole another contract
Rath turns from the monitor, pacing
Trying to collect himself
'm being set up
Fucking set up
He looks at the chess board
He hovers over it, the pattern completely familiar
Is this how it went, Nick
/ Robert
Robert
Rath turns back to the screen, speaking as he types
/ How did he know
/ Know what
/ The fucking contract
How in the fuck did he know
long beat
/ Such language in front of a lady
Rath still talking and typing
/ don't know what the fuck you are
/ know
It was a joke
Rath stands, no longer typing
joke
joke
Rath takes out his gun and levels it at the face of the screen
You think this is a fucking joke
/ $1,000,000
Rath looks at the number
/ That's the bonus on the contract
Rath puts the gun down
/ Deadline
/ Tomorrow
The buyer is Japanese
His retirement a condition of the bonus

Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus
' Rath looks at the fax; almost entirely black except for the wide, slit-iris cat eyes
- There is a  and  of  as a 747 touches down, heat rising off the tarmac
- Several passengers walk through the gate into the terminal
Across from the gate, Rath sits in a grungy airport cafeteria, reading a folded paper
He is wearing an airport security uniform, a gun holstered to his side
Taped inside the newspaper is a faxed Interpol photograph of a Japanese man wanted for "industrial espionage
" At the gate, five Japanese men emerge
Leading the group is the man in Rath's photo
The other four are obviously muscle
Rath watches as they walk down the crowded terminal hall
When they are almost out of sight, he folds his newspaper and begins to follow
His pace and manner is that of a cautious predator
His focus shifts continually from face to face, expecting to find Bain's
His hand hovers near his gun
Ahead of him a thin young man, wearing a long blue trench coat, stops
Rath cannot see his face
The man starts toward a drinking fountain
Rath catches a glimpse of his face
It could be Bain, but he isn't sure
The young man bends over and slurps at the stream of water
He rises into the barrel of Rath's
22
mouthful of water coughs from his mouth
It is not Bain and in the next instant, the gun is gone
Sorry
My mistake
Rath continues
They young man is unable to move
- The five men stride through the automated terminal doors and towards a waiting limousine
Further down, Rath, now wearing a black -shirt and jeans, exits and hails a cab
Hi
Up ahead my boss is in that black limo
We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them
Sure
Rath sits back studying the faces exiting the terminal as the cab pulls away
The five men sit in silence
Strangely, a  begins to The older man, whose name is , opens his briefcase, removing a cellular phone
Hello
We hear Electra's voice
She speaks in Japanese; he uses English
(
) trust your flight was comfortable
Your Japanese is excellent
(
) Tell the driver:  the Hyatt Hotel
- Electra is pacing, talking into the cellular phone
'll call you again in twenty minutes
She punches a button and shoves the antennae down
The hotel room looks like her apartment
There is a computer and a series of monitors stacked on top of the wood laminate desk
Cables whip and wind across the carpeted floor to the central air duct
The panel has been removed and intertwined black and gray coaxial run up inside the duct
Immediately, Electra is busy finishing her preparations
She snaps in several power cords and the system comes on- line
On the monitor screen, we see an empty hotel room that looks exactly like the one she is in
Rath stares out the window, watching the surrounding traffic, the limo still in sight
Something occurs to him and he looks down at the folded newspaper where he had hid the contract file
He flips past several documents before finding what he's looking for; the cat
He pulls the dark fax of Nikita and stares at it
Laying on the bed, in a patch of sunlight, Nikita watches Electra rush about
Electra grabs the sheet from under the comforter and yanks it out
Excuse me, your Highness
Nikita casually walks off the bed
Electra takes the sheet to the open duct and tears off a long piece of duct-tape
The limousine pulls up in the lavish circular driveway
The cab pulls in behind it
Electra checks her watch and picks up the cellular phone
The Japanese men stand in a cluster looking very rigid and uncomfortable
The
Electra is pacing again
Room 1414
With several other guests, the Japanese men crowd into an elevator
The doors close
Across the lobby, Rath enters, walking past the elevators
As the elevator rises, we begin to hear a , a familiar sound
Cramped in the corner is Bain
He is  "," wearing dark sunglasses and a into his ears
Electra continues to pace, checking the monitors
At the switchboard, a    wearing an operator's headset, takes a late breakfast order, typing the order in the hotel computer
(  ) Yes, sir
That'll be up in about thirty minutes
You're welcome
He turns around and Rath is right behind him
The fourteenth floor; the  , the doors slide open and the clump of Japanese men get out
Just as the doors begin to close, Bain steps out
Bain follows them down the hall, still  the
There is again an ominous sense of predator moving in on its prey
As Akira finds 1414 and opens the door, another door burst open, a large family, heading for the pool
The moment is gone; the Japanese men close the door and Bain continues down the hall again,  the
When the Japanese men enter the suite, we realize that this is the image on Electra's monitors
Surveillance camcorders and microphones are mounted in various locations to display every inch of the room
The group hesitates for a moment, under the electronic eyes
The four goons have their hands in their jackets
small   sits on the coffee table It is the only noise in the room until a speaker crackles
/ (
) Good morning, gentlemen apologize for the arrangement, but we all know those aren't business cards you're reaching for
If anyone leaves this room, the deal's off
The operator is unconscious, slumped in the corner
Rath studies the hotel computer screen intently, the information rolling by
We see that it is the previous night's room service receipts
One vegetarian plate and a can of tuna fish
Room 1014
Electra stands in front of the monitors watching the men as she speaks into the microphone
Ten thousand dollars per disk
Insert the first disk now
On the monitor, we see Akira at the coffee table shove the first disk into the laptop disk drive
Akira turns from the small computer screen and nods at a goon, who drops a green brick of bound one hundred dollar bills, down the central air duct
The little clock on the laptop ticks away as it copies
Bain is sitting on a bench entrenched in a fevered game of "
" Suddenly, he stops
Yes
The display of the game reads "Game Over" and congratulates Bain on a new high score
Bain stands, smiling
He puts the game in his pocket and starts down the hall
Electra is crouched at the open duct, grabbing another stack of money, stuffing it into her bag
out of the  and she looks up at the monitor
The lock on the door has been broken and standing in the frame is Bain
Surprise
He raises his arm, his  spitting
Electra stares in horror at the monitors as Bain grabs the nearest bodyguard,  a  into his belly
Oh, God
Another  and the second bodyguard falls
The other two draw their handguns and Bain shields himself with the lifeless body of his first victim
They  at Bain but are unable to hit him
Bain squeezes off    and the two men fall dead
He lets his human shield fall to the ground and levels his gun on the shaking Akira
Don't kill me
Bain looks at him and smiles, then
Electra leaps at the computer, ripping the cord from the modem
Bain sees the fiber optic cable and looks right into it
(
) Tricky
Boy, you just can't trust anyone these days
He licks the lens, leaving a smear of saliva
She stuffs the disks into her bag
She puts Nikita in her "travel kitty" and charges for the door, grabbing her coat
Flinging it over her shoulder, she does not notice the letter from Ken slip out of her pocket as she bolts from the room
Electra explodes through the door and suddenly freezes
She is staring down the barrel of Rath's
22
Don't be stupid and you will live
The elevator behind Rath opens and closes against a hotel lobby ashtray
He waves her into the elevator with his gun
Hurry
- Electra's black   out of the garage, onto the open street
- The door swings open
From the hall we can hear the familiar  of the
The room, 1014, is the same as Electra had left it when she ran out
Jutting from a shadow on the floor is the corner of Ken's letter
' Electra drives, obviously nervous, as Rath watches out the rear window
Turn here
No one follows
He turns back to her
How many bodies were there
He checks his watch
What
He has to clean up
How many bodies were there
Um, five
One hour per man
Rath sets the timer on his watch for five hours
- Bain has returned to room 1414
Wearing rubber gloves, he clicks open a black leather attache and pulls out a can of rug cleaner
He picks up the phone for room service
Hi
This is room 1414 -- Behind him, in the bathroom mirror, we see one of the Japanese men hanging from the shower by his feet
He is naked
Yes, could you send up a pot of coffee and my friends are going to need some more towels
Thanks
He hangs up the phone and walks over to one of the large blood stains on the carpet
He points the rug cleaner at the stain covering it with white foam
' Rath sees the entrance for the expressway
Get on the expressway
Where are we going
Rath glances back
Nowhere yet
Electra turns onto the highway and   from the "travel kitty" in the back seat
Nikita, hush
wants out and  again
She won't stop unless you let her out
Rath reaches back and opens the box
Nikita springs into the front seat onto Rath's lap
Nikita
She helped me find you
What
How did you know  had a cat
Took a guess
Lucky for you, guessed right
Who the fuck are you
Who do you work for
work for the government
Yeah
She studies his face, his eyes
Bullshit
Yeah
You're one of them, aren't you fucking pro
'm part of the game, just like you
Electra pounds the steering wheel
Jesus
He reaches into the back seat, grabbing her bag
What do you think you're doing
Rath plucks out the bundles of money
Twenty large
That's all
What do you mean, 'that's all'
What in the hell do you know
The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars
Electra seems ready to jump out of her skin
The speedometer is floating around 90
Slow down
He pulls out the disks
figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more
Ten million -- Now you understand why 'm here
Electra wants to scream
The speedometer is climbing over 100
really think you should slow down
- The room is immaculate; near the door, several over-sized suitcases line the wall
Bain is sitting at the desk
His  is on, , as he flips casually through the telephone directory
His finger eases down a column stopping at "Morgan Jennifer
" There is a  at the door
He smiles and tears out the page
There is another,   which Bain hears this time
He   the  and opens the door; a  is waiting with a luggage cart
Hello, sir
Have you some luggage you need carried
Bain gives him a wink and a smile
Indeed  do
'  - The red "low fuel" light is on
Now what
Turn off the engine
Electra twists the ignition and the
Rath glances around and we see the car is parked in a gas station
You want me to pump
No, stay in the car
want you to understand something
If  intended to kill you, you would already be dead
Electra says nothing
He reaches over and takes the car keys
When he is out of the car, Electra slowly releases the strangle-hold she had on the steering wheel
Okay, Nikita, stay calm, think, breathe, think
Electra checks the rear view mirror, listening as Rath pumps the gas
Her eyes flash down to her bag
Outside, Rath watches Electra through the windows
She appears motionless
The electric gas counter races like a stop watch
In the car, Electra eases her hand into her bag
The tank full, Rath re-hangs the pump
He walks around the car and heads for the station
Electra waits until his back is turned
She pulls her tool pouch from her bag, throws it open and finds her wire stripper
Reaching under the dash, she yanks out a tangled handful of wire
She looks up; Rath is inside paying
Come on, come on, it's a cake walk
Her fingers fly with surgical precision, snipping, stripping, twisting
Rath steps out of the station as her head pops up, looking for him
It takes only a second for him to realize what she is doing
Oh shit
He runs at the car as she strips the last set of wires and strikes them; the
Please, please
He is almost there when the
She stomps on the gas, ramming the shift into drive
, the car swerves forward as Rath slams into it
He bounces backward, falling to the ground
The car fishtails away, accelerating as Rath rolls to one knee, his gun automatically in his hand
He draws a bead, but, he does not shoot
With a concerted effort, he puts the gun away
Dammit
'   - Electra's car is parked out front
She unlocks the lobby door and drags herself inside
' Standing at the mailboxes flipping through her mail is Jennifer Morgan
What she was hoping for is not there
She looks up and sees Electra
Excuse me -- Electra stops
You live here, don't you
Electra nods
'm sorry, this may sound really weird, but my friend told me he slipped a letter under the door here and  was wondering if you happened to see it
Electra is in a daze, her hand moving into her pocket
Letter
Yeah
He said he saw a woman with dark hair going into the building when he dropped it off
No
don't have it
Electra's mouth opens and she backs away
Jennifer is bothered by her reaction and she doesn't push it
'm sorry
didn't mean to -- 'm sorry
She shrugs and unlocks the interior door, leaving Electra in the lobby
Electra watches her, as her hand moves from pocket to pocket
worried expression tightens her face; the letter is gone
She opens the interior door, following Jennifer up the stairs
Electra climbs the stairs, her mind pouring through the possibilities, filled with fear
By the time Electra reaches the top floor, Jennifer is entering her apartment
Electra hurries past Jennifer's door to her own
'  - Electra flies across the living room to the monitors
She clicks them on, putting on Jennifer's channel
On the screen we see Jennifer in her living room checking her phone messages
One from her mother
Electra throws a few switches so that Jennifer's entire apartment is in front of her
On one of the monitors we see a shadow slide across the oak floor as something moves along the edge of the room
Jennifer has moved to the bathroom and is drawing a bath
Electra clamps her hand over her mouth when he steps out
Bain moves into the dining room where Jennifer had just been
Wearing rubber surgeon's gloves, he picks up the mail that she had dropped on the table and sorts through it
Bain moves about the apartment with complete indifference to Jennifer's presence; as if he were invisible, as though he knew she couldn't see him
He moves into a room, just as she moves out
Electra watches, dizzy, sick with terror, but she is unable to turn away
Bain searches through a desk drawer, while Jennifer starts undressing for her bath
He walks down the hall and stands outside of the bathroom
If Jennifer would turn around she would see him
Electra is about to run, to call out when -- Something catches Bain's eye
He moves into the bedroom, and is turned so that he is looking straight up into the camera
He inches towards it, not sure what it is
The fiber optic cable is hidden in the light fixture hanging over the bed
Staring at it, he is looking right at Electra
Bain steps up onto the bed, his face distorting as he moves close to the fish-eye lens
Poking it with his finger, he realizes what it is
warped smile stretches across his face as he whispers -- (
) Oh, you sick little bitch -- Electra tears away from the screen, panic seizing hold of her
She rips entire drawers out of her dresser, dumping them into a suitcase, stuffing in anything that looks important
She grabs Nikita in the "travel kitty
" The door opens and Electra jumps out, slamming it behind her as -- Bain turns from the back stairs
She leaps back inside as he whips out his , in the door
' She scrambles from the kitchen, throwing her suitcase, still clutching the "travel kitty," as -- The back   from its hinges, Bain charging, his
past her, Electra crashes through the front door into the hall
The stairs are at the far end
She is only halfway, when -- Rath rises up the stairs, his gun cocked
Electra drops to the floor as -- Behind her, Bain barrels from the apartment
Rath
The wood  ,   surrounding Bain
Off balance, he lunges back into the apartment
Rath continues , grabbing hold of Electra
They run down the stairs
Bain leaps down the flights
Bain rushes into the street, looking in every direction
They are gone
Fuck me
- Somewhere in the city
Electra and Rath enter the room together but they are both immediately alone
She walks across the room to a chair in the corner, curling into it even as Nikita jumps up and curls into her lap
He sets his briefcase on the table at the opposite end of the room and sits
They watch each other
Silence
Between then is the liquor cabinet
Rath knows a good idea when he sees one
Want a drink
Her face is as expressionless as Nikita's
He pours himself a very large bourbon and slugs it down
Takes a deep breath, then pours himself another one
Okay
He returns to his table with his drink
'm not good at this sort of thing, but we don't have a lot of time, so 'll just go ahead and get started
First:  you
ask myself, 'What is she thinking
' Her body tightens, coils
Simple
She's scared
She's almost been killed twice and now she is alone in a room with a man that she believes is an
assassin
Another deep pull on the bourbon
Furthermore she was brought here not entirely on her own accord which only increases her fear and suspicion
Thus, as long as she is afraid, her first, maybe her only thought will be escape
Does that leave me any other option
He slugs down the rest of his drink and stands, whipping out his gun
No
Crossing the room, he turns the gun around and offers it to her
She looks at it
Back at him
He puts it on the bed beside her, turns his back and walks to the bar
She picks up the gun
The gun is silenced
She could shoot me right now
She stands, Nikita jumping from her lap
She could take the car and be far from here before the maid comes in the morning, but -- She starts squeezing  ; the  , the around him , tufts of white stuffing leaping into the air
Shut up
He freezes, bottle in one hand, glass in the other
Stop trying to tell me what 'm thinking
She moves closer to him, the gun squeezed in her fist
'll tell you what you're thinking -- you think 'm not going to shoot you but right now you're not so sure, are you
slight shake of the head, no
You're thinking that maybe it was a mistake to give me this gun, that maybe 'm not going to think about things logically because 'm a woman and 'm freaked out and 'm going to do something impulsive and irrational -- right
She  the  to both sides of his head
He's surprised to be alive
You don't know shit about me
Now sit down
He returns to his chair and sits with the same expression she had worn sitting a moment ago
She opens the cabinet and grabs one of the sample bottles of liquor
She sucks it all down and throws the bottle across the room
Grabbing another, she sits on the edge of the bed
Okay
How did you find me
You're the computer hacker, you tell me
You didn't know anything about me
Nikita rubs up against her leg
Nikita
Yellow Pages
for veterinarian
There aren't that many
She nods, slurping at her bottle
You're one of them, aren't you
'Them'
An assassin
Until a minute ago
What does that mean
If  still was what  used to be, you would not be pointing that at me
Electra eyes him, considers shooting him right now
Who is that other guy
Another contractor
Someone hired both of you
No
They hired Bain
The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one
So this is something between you and him
He stole the contract knowing that would come after him
Why
Because he is trying to retire me
He wants to kill you
Yes
Why
The nature of the business
You remove your competition
And you want to use me to get him
Yes
Forget it
We don't have a choice
She  the , pocking the wall behind him
Don't tell me  don't have a choice
Right
'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why  shouldn't shoot you
It's simple
You need me
need you
And we will both need money
don't need you to get the money -- my money
If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead
She's up pacing, knowing there is some truth in that
don't need the money
This is something that is never going to end
You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you
To survive, you have to go into deep hiding
And that's going to take money, a lot of money
Then you can have the disks and 'll just walk out that door -- If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you
Why
Because he took a contract on you
He'll come for you and he'll find you
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me
No
It's the truth
know what you are
Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world
You don't have a social security number
You don't pay taxes
You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years
long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy
You think you can do it again
But 'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing
No matter what you do, where you go,  swear to you that Bain will find you
How
Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment
He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets
He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books
If you keep a diary, he is reading it
He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke
In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled
If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them
She is coming unglued
Imagining him watching her tapes, going through her possessions
She is moving, pacing, ready to explode
Oh Jesus Jesus
He will know everything about you
Everything
know, because 've done it
Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head
If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because  was the best and couldn't take him
She whirls and starts  the , firing it everywhere, fear and anger rocketing out of her in hot wads of
When she stops, he starts to say something but she levels the gun at him
Shut up
All right
You've said enough
She forces herself back, grabbing handfuls of the sample bottles
need to think
To be alone
With the gun and an armful of booze and Nikita following at her feet, she goes into the bathroom and slams the door
She locks the door and then collapses
Her body seems to fold up onto itself as she slides down the wall; the and the  falling from her arms, on the bath rug as she buries her face in her hands
Very mechanically, Rath begins setting up his chess board, putting the pieces into the same positions
It is a ritual, and with it he enters a kind of trance
From the bathroom, almost inaudible, he hears Electra With her head now buried in her arms and knees, she is sobbing, her body rocking
The crying seems very similar to Jennifer's; a complete emotional release
Rath stares at the board
The  grows
He stands and walks to the door
He starts to knock but stops himself
Like Electra with Jennifer, Rath would like to help, he just has no idea how to
He turns back to the desk, to his chess game
Her eyes are now burning red
She stops crying long enough to suck down an entire sample of Scotch
Nikita rubs against her and she strokes her
Oh shit, Nikita
Rath is setting up his computer system
He hears the Nikita jumps up onto the toilet seat and starts drinking
Cheers
Electra finishes another sample and drops it to the floor where we see that many of the bottles are now empty
In the tub, steam rising off the surface, she wrings out a wash cloth and covers her face, sinking deeper into the water
When Electra comes out of the bathroom, Rath is again at his chess game
She sits down across from him and sets the gun on the table between them
Rath looks up at her
Listen --  don't even know your name
Rath
Robert Rath
Electra
Just Electra
Yeah
As in daughter of Agamemnon
No
Just Electra
The conversation dies
What 'm trying to say is that -- 'm not sure  can do this, help you, unless  know more about you
What do you want to know
If Bain hadn't taken the contract on me, would you have
He stares at her
No
Why
Because 'm done
This is crazy
can't trust you
You can't trust me
How can we possibly help each other
They sit in silence, the gun and the chess game lying between them
Do you play
She looks at the chess board
With computers
It's not the same, is it
Better than playing with yourself
He smiles
had an opponent
She understands that he is trying to tell her something
Had
He was Russian
Nicholai Tachlinkov
legend in the business when  was just starting
admired him
When  heard he loved chess  became obsessed with the game
Electra studies the board
He was white
Rath nods
It looks like white's game
We played with a code using The New York Times obituaries
Over three years we played twelve matches never won
Why didn't you finish this game
She reaches over and lifts a White Knight and takes a Bishop
Rath counters, taking her Knight
He was
taken
He was killed
Rath nods
Throughout the entire conversation they continue to play out the chess game
By who
long beat
killed him
Why
Because that's how it works
That's what it's about
He was the best
He was on top
Where you wanted to be
Yes
As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top
That's all there is
Until then, there is nothing
You are nothing
How did you get into the business
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency
The
More or less
How old were you
They recruited me when  was in high school
Jesus -- why
Languages
was already fluent in nine languages
You were like a boy genius
Some people said that
never thought so
Why not
was just different
You went from high school to the Agency
No
graduated from George Washington University
Then entered the Agency training program
They didn't give you a choice, did they
No, they didn't
But you knew what they were training you for
Of course
was going to be James Bond
Ahhhh
They are very good at what they do
It's very seductive
The training, the weapons, the travel -- The exotic women
Women
No
not really
Why not
Women
don't
don't want to talk about women
Why
Because you are a women
Why did you leave the Agency
The same reason everyone does
You hear your name on - and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you
They tried to kill you
Yes
It didn't matter much to them as long as  disappeared
Then you went freelance
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money
Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets
Tell me about the first time
My first take
Yes
Why
Because  want to know
It was
mechanical
Very precise
It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline
Are they usually like that
No
Just the first one
After that
They become complicated
messy
Did it ever bother you
Did it ever bother James Bond
That's fiction
This is fiction
Don't you see that
This is another reality
And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them
They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks
Do you understand what  am saying
No one is innocent -- including you
Does that mean it didn't bother you
Rath leans back and stares at her
She waits
You get a job swinging a hammer, the first day you get a blister, it tears open, it bleeds and it stays sore a long time
You keep swinging the hammer, you get a good hard callous that covers that spot and it never bothers you again
Electra says nothing
He leans forward and slides a rook into her back row
Check
He leans back
Is that what you wanted to hear
Something cold blooded
something remorseless
No
Something honest
beat
Rath likes this woman
She moves her Queen
Mate
He smiles
hope your plan is better than your game
- The room is ugly
Shag carpeting, wood paneling and polyester patterned curtains
We hear a    away as we a table
The hotel phone is in a modem, which is held together with duct tape
Between the modem and the computer is a scrambler constructed out of a series of naked circuit boards
It is a very similar set up to Rath's, only it has been put together with a fraction of the resources
Bain sits, typing at the computer, his shirt off
Beside the desk-top is a six pack of Old Style beer, a bag of Doritos and his Gameboy
On the floor, disassembled neatly on a small white towel is his cleaned gun
Bain finishes punching in a code, sits back and sucks down his beer
/ Where have you been, Michael
He belches
He is communicating with his General Contractor
On the table is a collection of personal objects, much of it stuffed in pillow cases, taken from Electra's house
/ Tracking the mark
Bain fingers a pair of satin panties
He smiles as he smells them
'm on the scent
/ You're too late
Bain slams his beer down
/ 've learned from MicroCell, Rath fulfilled the contract
/ How
/ He took out the mark and sold the disks back to MicroCell
Bain falls back in his chair, thinking
He runs his hands through his sweaty hair
/ Michael
No
No
No
don't believe it
/ They money will be standard bank transfer
We believe we will know where and when
What
/ How
There is no response
/ How in the fuck do you know that
long beat
/ Such language in front of a lady
don't give a fuck what you are asked you -- He hits the repeat key
(types) How in the fuck do you know that
/ Do you want Rath or not
Bain stares at the screen, thinking
Thinking hard
- Another computer screen, but we don't know that it is different
/ It will take three days to arrange the transfer
Three days
We are in Electra and Rath's hotel room
She is standing behind him, reading as he types
/ Which account
Are you going to tell him
It
Tell it
For all  know it could be a machine
You said you didn't trust it
don't
/ Which account
What kind of bank is going to allow us to withdraw ten million dollars the day it is transferred
The kind preferred by drug smugglers, arms dealers and politicians
Rath types in an account number
Do you have a passport
Several
Good
Where is it
Mexico
- Rath and Electra are sitting in the first class section, which she is obviously enjoying, smiling and sipping champagne
God,  love first class
remember when  was a little girl,  would wonder what it was like up here would always try to peek through the curtains
Rath says nothing, staring out the window
Electra shakes her head
hope Nikita's all right
He still does not respond
Hey, where are you
Thinking
About
Nothing
Electra sips the last of her champagne
've never been to the Gulf of Mexico
Is it as nice as they say
don't know
You were there
long beat
Yes
- The plane lands
Rath and Electra hand their bags to a  who puts them in his trunk
Rath speaks perfect Spanish
(in Spanish) Good afternoon
We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca
(in Spanish) Yes, sir
- The cab pulls up in front of a large, brand new glass hotel, which shimmers in the blue green reflection of the gulf water
Rath is upset
(in Spanish) No, no
said the Hotel Paraiso
(in Spanish) Yes
This is the Hotel Paraiso
(in Spanish) No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city
Near the Plaza del Sol
(in Spanish) 'm sorry, sir
year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso
This is the new Hotel Paraiso
(in Spanish) Take us there
- American tourist dollars have built up the coasts, but much of the out-lying city is very poor
The old Hotel Paraiso is a five story blackened husk
The face of the building is burnt black and it seems to hang in space as something non-corporeal, like the shadow of the building rather than the building itself
Rath stares at it, remembering
Electra is behind him, standing in the midst of the Plaza del Sol
He looks up to the fifth story window, then turns directly opposite of that
The International Banco de Mexico, an enormous, beautiful old building; its exterior walls are white-washed concrete, blindingly bright white
Electra looks at the bank and smiles
So, that's where all that  & money is
Rath is not listening to her
He is somewhere else
He turns back to the fourth story window
That's where he'll be
What
wasn't expecting this
need to think
- Beyond the lights of the hotel the gulf darkens to midnight oil
On one side of the elevator is a young couple who look like newlyweds
They are cuddling, kissing and giggling as though they are alone
Electra and Rath are on the other side of the elevator
It is a strange contrast
Electra is staring at them
Rath, behind his sunglasses, is in his own world
The   and opens
Nobody moves
The   again and start to close, as everyone realizes that this is their floor
Rath and the other man grab the doors, which spring back open
It is a funny, awkward moment, as everyone apologizes and smiles politely, on the way out
The couple move down the hall, the newlyweds finding their door first
Rath reaches the door to their room, opens it and enters
Electra lingers, watching the other couple, watching as he fumbles for his keys, her hand running up between his legs and over his ass
He finally manages to open the door and she pushes him inside
Electra softly closes her door
- Rath is sitting in a desk chair staring out of the sliding balcony doors at the dark gulf water
Did you see them
Electra moves about the large suite
They looked like they were in love
Rath says nothing
Well,  think 'll take a bath
Come on, Nikita
The two of them walk into the bathroom, leaving Rath to himself
Electra sits on the edge of the over-sized tub, water running through her fingers as she adjusts the temperature
After a beat she hears a  , a
It is followed by other  , a and a
The sounds are coming from the other side of the tub wall, from the other suite
Electra puts her ear against the tile to listen
The   her  is too loud for her to hear
She turns it
There is more  and , the   and then, the   into
Electra hangs on each sound, slowly lifted by it, moving up toward the over-head fan and ducts
The  get  as she moves closer to the vents, until she is standing precariously on the edge of the tub, listening to what is clearly the sounds of Their  and   and Electra smiles
It is dark now
single desk light is on, under which Rath is setting up his chess board, putting the pieces in their familiar pattern
Electra comes out of the bathroom
She seems very clean and fresh, wearing a long white -shirt and thin robe
That felt great
You should try it
She watches him setting the pieces onto the board
Don't you ever get tired of playing the same game
He looks at her
No
Why not
It helps me to focus
It centers me, helps me think
Oh
What do you think about
Work
The things  need to get done
She sits across from him looking at the board
Do you think about the game
Yes
But you've never figured out a way to win
No
Not even a stalemate
No
What happens if you do
This strikes Rath as a very strange question and he is suddenly annoyed by her
Can  ask you something
He knows she will anyway
What will you do if this works, if we get the money
don't know
maybe 'll live on a boat, sail to all the places 've never been
That sounds nice
He finishes his glass of bourbon
She is not sure what to say next, if she should say anything at all
'm kind of tired
think 'd like to try and get some sleep
You can have the bed
The chair is fine for me
He pours himself another drink, dropping in some ice from the ice bucket
Thanks
She slips out of the robe and in between the sheets
Rath sits across the room, his back to her
She tries to make herself comfortable, but cannot
Do you think he's here
Here
In Costa Blanca
Yes
She thinks
What do you think he's doing
don't know
But 'm sure he's not sleeping
She pulls the covers tightly to her chin
Her eyes do not close
( ) - small hotel in the city, away from the beaches, built before there was such a thing as central air conditioning
Bain is naked, except for a small pair of camouflage jockeys and his Walkman strapped to his shoulder
His head is pumping wildly with the speed metal thrashing in his ears
He is tearing open a long box wrapped in "Happy Birthday" paper
Inside the box is a massive black hi-tech assault rifle
He smiles
He assembles it quickly, snapping it together with automatic ease
When the sight is tightened in place, he jumps up
In the mirror over the dresser, he poses down with the gun
Not satisfied, he grabs his shades and checks himself again
He starts moving with the music, playing with the gun, first as a guitar, then whipping it around, spinning it expertly, like a drum and bugle corpsman
The gun zips and flashes around as he whirls in place, then freezes
The butt of the rifle to his shoulder, he peers down the scope at his own head reflected in the mirror
He is sweating and breathing, but the barrel does not move
You're dead, motherfucker
- Electra leans out over the railing, smiling, inhaling the warm air, the scent of the shimmering blue-green sea
Rath stands in the shadow of the door frame
Breakfast
Why don't you bring it out here
It's beautiful out here
Rath steps a little farther out
He looks down either side of the building, checking sight lines
He looks out and sees another hotel with windows facing them
He turns to her
Says nothing
Moves back inside
The breakfast trays are empty
Rath is sipping coffee, scribbling notes and diagrams on a piece of paper
Electra comes out of the bathroom dressed for the beach
He stops working
know what you are thinking
'm not going to disappear, okay
'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach
got to get out of this room, just for a little while
Okay
Really
He won't be looking for you
Just be careful
Buy a book
Keep your sunglasses on
Book
Sunglasses
Great
Electra steps out of the hotel room ready for the beach
At the end of the hall, she sees the newlywed couple get on the elevator
She starts to call to them to hold it for her, but she stops herself
The elevator closes
She edges slowly down the hall, stopping outside the door to their suite
She touches it with the tips of her fingers
- Rath is still at the table
The curtain begins to billow, a soft breeze blowing through the open patio door
They swell open and fall
It seems for a moment that there is a figure, a shadow, in the changing shape of the curtain
Rath stands
He walks to the open door
Standing in the frame, he looks out at the blue ocean below
He slides the door closed, and the curtains fall still
- Bain moves through the market, booths lining the edges of the plaza
His eyes shift rapidly behind his sunglasses
He buys an apricot and strolls into the center of the plaza
He looks at the bank, at the military-style security guards that patrol the front
He turns in the plaza, checking the perimeter, his gaze falling on the tall, burned-out building
He looks back at the bank, imagining the sight line
He bites into the apricot, its juice gushing, running down his chin
Rath is leaning back in the bed,   in his lap
He did not sleep last night and is very tired
His eyes fight to stay open
The sound of the  momentarily hangs in the hotel room as he sleeps
The program is a version of
The door bangs open and Rath springs off the bed, a gun flashing in his hand, leveling it at a dazed, blinking Electra
Rath sighs slowly, letting the hammer of the back into place
You should knock
Sorry
How was the beach
The beach
It was nice
She smiles
- The sun burns a tropical red against the mirrored windows of the hotel
Electra is sitting on the bed, her back against the wall
In her hands is a paperback romance novel that she is looking over the top of, staring intensely across the room
We can hear Rath, his breathing deep and even
He is doing Tai Chi, wearing only his boxer shorts
His body is coated in a sheen of sweat, his muscles strained as he moves fluidly through space
Electra begins to breath with him
She moves her body slightly, her hips rising as though to meet his
He empties his lungs entirely in one exhale and stops, his eyes closed, rested
That was beautiful
He looks at her
Tai Chi, right
He nods
Where did you learn it
Taiwan
Not that  would know, but you look like you're really good at it
Thank you
've always wanted to learn something like that
You should
It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it
Electra nods, watching him bend, reaching for a change of clothes
'm going to shower
If you're hungry, go ahead and order some dinner
Electra nods again
- Bain is doing push ups
He is naked except for his camouflage bikinis
He has his feet up on a chair, making it harder, the dip deeper
His body is gushing sweat, his face a burning red
He is like a piston firing up and down
The muscles in his neck and shoulders are bulging cords
Slowly, his arm begin to tire, the strain seen in his knotting and twisting expression
Half way up, he collapses, feet falling off the chair
He rolls onto his back, rubbing a tricep
It hurts
He licks the sweat off his upper lip and smiles
- Rath checks his watch
It's after eight o'clock
He lifts the phone and plugs it into the modem
'm going to call
Electra drops her book and climbs off the bed
He dials, types the code and waits
/ Hello, Robert
/ The contract
/ Paid in full
Oh, my God
Ten million dollars
/ Transferred to the specified account
Rath stares at the screen
/ Goodbye, Robert
Rath disconnects
The
Electra picks it up, placing it back in the cradle
Sit down
She does
He opens a case and pulls out his gun, some paper and pens and two small mikes that look like hearing aids
Okay -- He starts drawing several squares on the paper, as Electra picks up the mike
She looks over it, frowns
Two way
Transmits and receives
Cheap as shit
He looks at her
paid a lot for these
They saw you coming a mile away
If had known we'd be using -- It's too late now
Okay
We'll have to deal with these
Fine
He goes back to his drawing
This is the bank
This is the hotel
In the morning  will enter the bank
Check
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd
He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank
But he won't shoot you right then
No
It would be amateur
risk
He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming
Once 'm inside, he'll move to the hotel
He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front
He draws another square
You'll be here
restaurant public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside
Okay
Then what
Then, we wait
Aiiee
More waiting
don't know if  like this plan
It will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself
He will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow  slipped by and am already on a plane to Europe
He describes this as though remembering it
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed
5:45
5:50
He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank
Why won't he wait until the bank closes
He won't be able to
He'll have to go inside
He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not  am there
If the bank closes, he won't know for sure
He'll come
'm sure
And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun
What
What if he brings it with him
He shakes his head
He can't
The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and -ray machines
That means you won't have a gun
That's right
And with the mikes, 'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank
If things go well,  don't have to
You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me
You'll have the money
How do know that you won't -- 'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed
You'll have the gun and 'll drive the car
We split the money
Five million apiece
You get on your plane,  get on mine
Sounds pretty well figured out
've been thinking about it for a long time
Except -- What
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel
told you, he will
You can't know for sure, how can you
mean, you're not him
was
She waits for him to explain
Ten years ago,  sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting -- For Nicholai
Yes
You killed him here
In this city, outside that bank
Rath nods
What is it
don't like this at all
What is going on here
don't know
It just happened was here ten years ago, 'm here now
That's it
don't believe that
It wasn't planned or premeditated
swear
Things happened beyond my control
understood;  saw where they were leading and  suppose that it just made sense
Ten years ago
Yes
What happened
waited until  was insane and then walked into the bank
He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me
What did he want
He wanted what  want now; to get out of the business
To disappear to some empty Greek island
What did he say
He said  couldn't win
That no one wins at this game
Was that it
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business
You didn't take it
No
went back to the hotel
And waited
Ten years later, here you are again
Yes
Here  am again
-    - The cross-hairs of a telescopic sight are lined-up on the head of a marble statue
- Bain is laying on the floor in the dark
The rifle is under him as he aims out of his balcony, down the street at the statue
He looks up from the scope, checking the street
It is dark and empty and he shifts back looking into the sight
His finger squeezes, the   , as -- : chunk of   out the head of the statue
Again, the   and another cloud of dust and from the head
His finger is pumping the trigger, until the head cracks and falls
He's laughing, hysterical, looking down the street at the headless statue
He rolls onto his side still laughing
Then, suddenly, he stops, staring up at the stars in the night sky
- Electra is still at the table, staring at the diagrams, in another world
Rath pours a glass of bourbon and sets it in front of her
This has been the longest day of my life
Rath nods, pouring himself a drink
Electra looks at the drink, downs the whole glass
He refills it
Do you have ulcers
No
think  got one today
Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids
She smiles
They both gulp down their drinks and he fills them again
What do you suppose he's doing now
Rath shrugs
He is no longer looking at her; staring at the board, moving his mind into the chess game
She watches him and then begins to study it with him, the way a child does, almost imitating him
She does not want to be left alone right now
She reaches over and moves a white knight
He blinks
His eyes shifting, sorting the possibilities
He picks a bishop and counters
After another sequence, he takes her bishop and she takes his knight
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight
hate bishops
They're useless like knights
They're worth less points
So
There is no point in arguing
As they continue to play, we begin to hear in the distance, the  in the adjoining suite  very vigorous
Electra watches Rath to see if he hears them
He shows no sign of it, concentrating on the game
Do you hear them
He looks up
Listen
He hears it
Not interested
Did you think they were newlyweds
didn't notice them
When  first saw them  thought they were married
How do you know they're not
went into their room this afternoon
What
It was no big deal
saw them leave,  went in
Jesus, if someone had -- Nobody ever sees me
Why in the hell would you take that chance
heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them
wanted to, so  did
Rath shakes his head
In the b
g
, the  is She is married, but not to him
Another man, much older
She has four kids
The young guy works for her
And  think she likes kinky sex
Thank you
Isn't it interesting though mean, look at us, in this room
Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market
mean, we look like just another couple
But what are we
Doesn't it seem so crazy
No
No
It's always been that way
The world has always functioned on two levels
know
It makes me crazy
Why
don't know
When  was in college,  was forced to go to a psychiatrist because  was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor
And you were drilling these holes
So  could watch the girl that lived under me
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation
Did he explain how this happened
He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl watched my parents have this big fight, really big
thought my mother was going to kill my father
Then they went into their room and made up
And  watched them make love through the keyhole
The   a final time in
Electra moves her queen, taking his other knight
What are you doing
What
That's a ridiculous move
Why
Because, 'll take it
'm playing white, remember
You can't tell me which pieces to move
It doesn't work that way
He shrugs and takes her queen, the game continuing
Can  ask you something
'm sure you will
Am  attractive
This gets his attention
Yes
Are you attracted to me
Yes
Why
Why
don't know
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing
Both
good answer
Electra smiles
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before
didn't want to complicate the situation
Attraction is a complication
It can be
It happened to you before
Yes
Who was she
Someone like me, like you
pro
What happened to her
She was taken
Did you -- No
tried to stop it couldn't
Was she the only one
After her,  realized that to survive  had to live without
It's dangerous to let things become complicated
Is this becoming complicated
'm not sure that  care anymore
He looks up from the game
Were you attracted to me right away
No
When did it start
Honestly
Uh-huh
When  gave you my gun and you almost shot me
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist
Why
That doesn't sound normal
'm not normal
know
That's why 'm attracted to you
mean, you make me nervous
You're intimidating
Maybe it's my curiosity/self-preservation thing, but all  can really think about right now is kissing you
They rise up from the table, together, knocking over the chess game
The pieces fall to the floor
They grab at each other, kissing, both of them hungry, aggressive
They tear at each other's clothes and at their own clothes; it has a very awkward sense to it, as they become naked in front of each other
There is nothing smooth or fluid about it, which makes it seem very real
He takes her, lifting her onto the table
She scoots and wiggles back, the chess pieces falling out of the way
She opens her legs and he moves in between them
wanted to tell you -- Her breath rushes out, then back in
My real name is Anna
He smiles
Martin
Martin
Her legs wrap up around his hips and he pushes deeper into her
Nice to meet you, Martin
-  - Outside of the room, we can hear the   of - We are   the street, ,  the old flagstones,  the marble statue that Bain shot
On the ground are the shattered pieces of the head
We see one of the pieces is part of the face, the eyes, which seem like the iris-less eyes of a chess king
We   the blank white of that eye
: We  ,   and , and see other squares, black and white like a chess board
woman's    past
, we see the woman walking
man crosses behind her, in another direction
, and we realize that we are looking at the black and white marble floor of the -- - It is a strange and beautiful bank
The ceilings are vast, the suspended lights elaborate, baroque, the enormous clock on the wall, built to resemble a sun
It looks almost as though it could be a museum, with its massive oil paintings and bronze statues of important Mexican figures
Already it is crowded, people and security guards moving about beneath us
Rath steps onto the checkered floor and remembers
The cafe is off the plaza
Electra sits at a patio table
Down the street she can see the back of the burned-out hotel
She hears Rath in her ear-piece
(
) All right
'm in the bank
He'll move now
How are you doing
She is nervous
'm ready
Good
Rath is wearing a well-tailored, gray silk suit and dark sunglasses
In his hand is a very large briefcase
He crosses the checkered floor to the teller windows
May  help you
Yes
Could you check on a transfer for me
Your name, or account
Rath
Robert Rath
Electra smiles when she hears him, mouthing the name "Martin
" walks over to the window, carrying a printed receipt, with a very bright smile
Senor Rath, we have received your transfer
He hands Rath the receipt
He glances at it, checking the zeros
There are seven of them
Good
Now 'll need to close this account
'd like you to ready the paperwork
The smile fades
You wish to close this account today
That's correct
How would you like the funds
American currency
This will take some time
have all day
Electra looks up over her book and Bain is there, moving down the side street, gliding through the crowd with the menacing indifference of a shark
The Official is talking to the teller in Spanish, when Electra whispers in Rath's ear
He's here
Rath freezes
Electra watches as Bain moves along the plywood wall, covered with bills and posters, built to keep people out of the burned hotel
He is carrying a long nylon duffel bag
At the corner, a section of the plywood has been pulled loose and Bain squeezes through, into the hotel
He's inside
Rath is sitting in one of the high backed leather chairs set in pairs along the wall of the bank
He glances at the enormous clock, which reads 10:10
He checks his Rolex
Now, we wait
The center of the hotel is open
Interior hall balconies, which line each floor, look down onto an old atrium courtyard
The fire did the most damage here, spreading easily throughout the entire building
The skylight and ceiling at the top of this open area, has been destroyed and sunlight streams through throwing broken patterns of shadow and light onto the blackened floors and walls
Bain enters, and carefully begins climbing the charred staircase to the fifth floor
The room has been heavily burned, stained black from smoke
The charred carpet crunches and cracks, as Bain walks across it to the window
As he nears the exterior wall, several with a brittle  and he almost falls through
Shit
He pulls his leg free
Outside the window, across the plaza, he sees the bank; a perfect site
Quickly he unzips the bag and lifts out the gun
He grabs a magazine and snaps it into place
He aims down at the bank's bright white stairs
man is walking down the steps and Bain finds the center of his forehead in the cross-hairs of the scope
Bain makes a gun noise, followed by the sound of a head bursting open
He giggles
Leaning against the wall, in the shadows of the window, the gun in his lap, he waits
Time slows to a crawl
Without taking his eye from the bank, Bain rummages through his bag and finds a pack of cigarettes
He pulls one out with his lips and lights it
Taking a deep drag, he lets the smoke slowly leak out and drift up into the night
: White hot
There are five cigarette butts ground into the blackened window sill, where Bain extinguishes another
What in the fuck are you doing in there
The room is hot, a streak of sweat up his back and front
It is difficult to breathe
man walks out of the bank, wearing a suit similar to Rath's
Bain's body snaps erect, rifle instantly leveled
He sights the man's head, his finger tightening on the trigger, but he is not sure it is Rath
He looks over the scope, looks back
The man reaches the bottom of the stairs
Bain's body sags
That's not him
Jesus, Bain, baby, chill the fuck out
He takes a deep breath and wipes the sweat from his forehead, leaving a smear of black from the charcoal wood
He again fumbles through his bag, finding a container of bottled water
He chugs the whole thing
The Official walks over to Rath with a number of papers to sign
Your signature, senor
Everything is ready
Rath signs them, but does not get up
Excellent, senor
If you could follow me
'm sorry, but  am waiting for an associate
Can you hold everything for me until he arrives
Of course, senor
Thank you
Electra is sipping at some iced tea, dizzy at the thought of all that money
Ten million dollars, sitting there
Waiting
this is insane
There is a faint smile on Rath's lips
The shadows are getting longer
Bain is rocking back and forth, breathing through his teeth
He has to urinate
Bad
He is checking every face that comes out of the bank with the scope
Still nothing
This is fucking insane
He grabs the empty plastic bottle, unzips his pants and begins refilling it
man in a suit appears on the steps and Bain fumbles the bottle, spilling it as he lifts the gun
It is not Rath
Fucking God dammit
He hurls the bottle of piss across the room
The sun clock on the wall, perfectly still, reads 5:20
After a long beat a single minute clicks off
The sun is getting low
The room much darker now
Bain sits at the window; his body a knot
large group of tourists flow out of the bank and Bain's eyes light up
One by one, the scope passes over each face
They trickle down the steps and into the plaza
The stairs are again empty
Bain screams, pounding the butt of the gun down, splitting open the floor
He looks at the bank
Nothing
He checks his watch
In fifteen minutes the bank will close
He stands up
Electra is watching the back of the hotel, when Bain emerges from the shadows
Oh my God
He is moving like a bullet, knocking into people who don't get out of his way
He's coming
Rath looks up at the clock, smiles
Four minutes
What
waited another four minutes
Shit
Wait until he is on the stairs
Right
'm taking off my mike
Okay
Electra -- What
Last night -- Electra smiles
Was nice
Yes
She sees Bain storming up the stairs
She stands, tosses several bills on the table and leaves
Bain charges into the bank, tearing off his sunglasses, scanning the room
His face is a twisted grimace, streaked with black charcoal
His body and clothes are covered in sweat and large salt rings
His breathing labored
He sees Rath sitting comfortably, calm, his suit not even wrinkled and realizes that Rath has been waiting for him
His first instinct is to turn and run, but he stops himself
He is confused, unsure
Then, as though understanding he has no choice, he puts his sunglasses back on and strides over to Rath, against the polished
Bain sits down in the leather chair across from him
How'd you know
Just tell me that
How'd you fucking know
knew the same way in ten years you're going to know
What does that fucking mean
It means that 'm going to tell you things, even though  already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing  say
Electra carefully moves up to the fifth floor, then navigates around a large hole, towards the last room
It's irony
That's what it is
But the real irony is that you won't know it's irony until you're sitting over here
Bain isn't listening
Instead he's watching, everyone who walks near them
When you walked in here and you saw me, sitting here, waiting; the first thing that went through your head was that you were a dead man
This catches Bain's ear
You're thinking that you've been sold out
That's the only way could know you were out there
Why would you think this
Because you don't trust your contractor
You don't trust anyone
It's automatic
It's the first and last commandment
It's the only thing that keeps you alive
So, try as  might to tell you the truth, you can't believe me
Do you see the irony of the situation
It's kind of funny, isn't it
Bain is not laughing
Inside the burned out closet, Electra finds Bain's nylon duffel bag
Digging through it, she finds his Gameboy, his Walkman, his
22, ammunition clips and several issues of Soldier of Fortune and a Punisher comic book
The rifle is not here
Listen to me, Bain
Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where  was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell
You don't know how they got the information
It bothered you, but you didn't care
How do  know this
Because ten years ago,  was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now
ain't scared of you
Yeah you are and you hate it
You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't
That you're sweating your balls off and 'm not
You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it
All right, Bain
Pay attention, because this is where everything changes
Electra is beginning to panic
She cannot find the gun and has started looking in other rooms
You're a businessman, right
This is a business deal
Behind that counter,  have over ten million dollars
'll give you half of it, more money than you'll make in the next ten years if, you walk away
Bain's face changes, muscles relaxing, the tension slipping out of him
Five million dollars
That's right
Shit
That sure is a lot of money
Bain is smiling
Did you see how  did that
Magic wasn't it
What
You understand what's going on
It makes sense, right
Oh, yeah
What  just said, no assassin would say
What 've said, only a mark would say
They stare at each other
You think  would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars
You would be
You don't know a fucking thing about me
You don't have the slightest fucking clue
Why don't you tell me
'll tell you this
After Cleveland,  thought  was lucky to be alive
But now, here,  just realized that you were the lucky one
Now 'll tell you something
It wouldn't fucking matter if  offered you one hundred million dollars
You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me
And here  am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing  can think is that, in just a few minutes 'm going to take you
Bain jumps out of the seat
Yeah, okay
'm ready
Let's fucking go
He's walking, turning, watching everything, everyone
He's out the door
Electra is on the fourth level, searching desperately for the gun, rushing through the black skeletal remains of the hotel
In her ear she hears Rath
(
) Electra
She shrieks
Rath is at the counter, as the Official loads perfectly stacked blocks of crisp one hundred dollar bills into the case
Electra
Electra is frantic
God,  can't find it
can't find it
can't find the fucking gun
For Rath, everything has changed
In long, pounding strides, Bain crosses the square, twisting, glancing back, watching
Electra nears the room below the fifth story window
It wasn't with his other stuff
Rath is now afraid
Electra, get out
Bain nears the opening in the plywood wall
Electra looks up and there is the gun; supported by black plumbing pipe and charred lathe
It hangs in the space between two joists, hidden in the upstairs floor
(
) He's coming, Electra
Get out now
Oh, God
see it
She reaches for it, but it's too high
(
) Electra, listen
You have got to come to the bank for the money
The money
She is not listening; she is rushing down the hall, back toward the stairs
Just as she grabs the rail, she hears below
She begins climbing the stairs, quickly but quietly
Bain is a rampaging beast, lunging up the stairs
The bank is almost empty
Rath has begun to sweat
Electra
The Official looks at him strangely, stacking the last of the green paper blocks
Electra peeks over the rail to see Bain right behind her
(
) Electra
The voice screams in her ear and she tears the mike off, stuffing it in her pocket
Electra, what's happening
What are you -- The Official closes the case and snaps the clasps shut
Finido, senor
Electra turns into the hotel room just as Bain reaches the fifth floor
There is no time
She slips into the closet, as Bain whips around the corner into the room
He rushes to the window, slamming himself against it
You're gonna take me
Come on
Come on, motherfucker
He bends down and from the hole that he fell into, pulls out the assault rifle
Take this
Take this, you fuck
Electra watches through the slits of the blackened wood lathe
He pounds his fist rapidly into his thigh and then through the wall
Motherfucker
He stands suddenly, perfectly still, gun aimed at the bank
Comeon-comeon-comeone-it'sover- gameover-comeon
The sun clock reads six o'clock
There is no one left in the bank except for employees and guards
The Official is at Rath's elbow leading him towards the metal gates
We are closed, senor
Thank you for banking with us
It is happening as it happened ten years ago
Rath knows that he is unable to stop it
Bain is rigid, cast in iron, the rifle rammed under his chin, sight tight to his eye, finger wrapped around the trigger
Electra silently, ever so delicately opens her bag, lifting out her gun
Make me shit, you sorry ass piece of mark meat
Come on, come on
It's over
know it
You know it
We know it
In the
we watch Rath step out of the bank, the doors closing behind him
Bain smiles
Electra slowly rises, still watching Bain
The sun has begun to set and the entire plaza has a deep orange and auburn cast
Rath looks down at the descending, white, stone steps
He steps down to the first stair
Lift your head, motherfucker
Electra is standing
The gun clenched in her shaking hand
Look up here
The cross-hairs are an "" on Rath's head
Look up
Look at me
want to see your face
Rath looks across the square, up the side of the hotel, at the window; there is only black shadow
He knows it is over
Yes
Electra shoves open the door, leveling the gun -- As Bain turns
Wha -- She
His shoulder explodes, blood spraying the black wall
Rath hears
Electra
His eyes, his whole body comes to life
Bain is twisting in mid-air, diving as -- She  again, moving at him
chunk of as she misses
He falls, the burned  , charred with the sound of
She watches him fall through, hears him  the below,  and   around him
The gun trained on the hole, she peers over the edge, but he is gone
Rath races wildly across the darkening market square
Bain, lying on his back, aims the rifle at her
Die, bitch
He , finger pumping,   through the floor around her feet
Screaming, she leaps out of the room, into the hall
His shoulders oozing blood, Bain clenches his teeth and rises, listening as -- She sprints for the stairs at the far end of the hall
Beneath, he moves to the railing and aims at the staircase, waiting, until -- Electra freezes at the top of the stairs, realizing that they are exposed
She flashes her head, quickly dipping back as the  is with
Fuck
God damn bitch
What are you doing
don't believe this is happening
She can hear him coming, his voice  through the hollow building
She looks down the stairs, the hall, above; there is nowhere to go
You're dead
You're fucking dead
'm going to kill you a hundred fucking times for this
Bain  up at the ceiling, the  tearing through the floor,  past Electra's head
If she moves he'll know her position
He  another
Electra sinks down, her back against the wall and aims at the floor
Another
She  back
Bain closes, as they both start , silenced , flashing,   at unseen targets
Her gun empties first
He laughs hearing the
Game over, bitch
Bain
Rath's scream  up through the building
Before Bain can target him, Rath is gone; a shadow, a ghost
He scans the hotel's courtyard
The last light from the setting sun slips through the slits, cracks and broken window panes, casting patterns; a surreal dream- like grid resembling a chess board
Electra sees her chance
She leaps to her feet, throwing the gun over the balcony
The two men watch the   to the floor as she races back to the room
Fuck no
Rath grabs the gun tracking Bain hurling up the stairs to the fifth floor
Rath pulls the trigger and finds the gun is empty
Shit
Bain reaches the top of the stairs before Electra gets to the end of the hall
Rath sees it all happening
Electra
Bain snaps into a targeting stance
Electra is flying toward the door, her feet hardly touching the floor -- When the cross-hairs find her back
Electra
Time becomes syrup
Down
Get down
Bain
Electra dives
The blackened   - in front of her
She bounces, scrambling on all fours into the room
Bain hurries down the hall after her as Rath bolts for the stairs
Seeing Rath exposed on the stairs, Bain whips around and , the   behind Rath as he dives back down into the shadows
Ripping open Bain's duffel bag Electra grabs Bain's
22
Bain advances steadily, the rifle trained on the door
Inside the room Electra grunts, hurling the duffel bag out the door
It spins over the balcony and plummets to the ground and bursts open
across the stone tile coming to rest in the middle of the courtyard
Rath and Bain both see it
Staying hidden, Rath immediately circles towards it
Bain sweats, looking at the door, down at the clip, then back at the door
Something's got to give
Unsure what to do Electra waits, the gun clenched between her two hands, covering the empty, dark space of the door
Bain makes his choice, moving towards room 502
Rath sees that Bain is going after Electra
He takes a slow breath and tears from the shadows -- Bolting into the open, Rath is focused wholly on the clip, the ground a blur beneath him -- Bain reacts; the rifle swings, rushing, arcing after Rath
Two more steps and Rath dives, sliding, snagging the clip as -- The   -- Rath screams, his leg erupting with blood
The scope glides up zeroing the back of Rath's head
Rath rams the clip in place
Game -- Bain squeezes the trigger -- -- the rifle is empty
Bain screams in disbelief
Rolling over, Rath jacks back the slide and sights the balcony but Bain is gone
Electra searches the room for a way out
Keeping the gun trained on the door she steps carefully over to the hole that Bain fell through
Grimacing, Rath struggles to his feet
Electra
Bain explodes through the wall, charred wood and plaster flying
Electra spins to shoot but the  suddenly  , swallowing her
Limping, lurching up the stairs, Rath hears the
Jarred by the fall, Electra drags herself away from the open ceiling
The gun
He needs the gun
Get rid of it
Throw it
She looks up for Bain but he has again disappeared
She looks at the gun, thinking, turning it over in her hands
His leg soaked with blood, Rath rumbles down the hall
Black with soot, Bain descends soundless, serpent-like to the fourth level through another burned opening
Electra moves towards the door aiming at every sound, at every dark corner
She is almost there when we see Bain, a shadow coming to life, emerging behind her
Lumbering, Rath is halfway there, his eyes riveted on the door to room 502
Hearing Bain, Electra turns
In one smooth motion, he snatches her arm and breaks her wrist
The gun falls
Rath hears her scream
Electra kicks at his groin but he drops, leg sweeping her to the ground
She gropes for the gun when he kicks her in the face, jack-knifing her body back, knocking her unconscious
Bain grabs the gun
Rath whips into the room  -- Bain as he disappears into a blackened hole
Rath goes to Electra not knowing if she is alive or dead
Gently he turns her, cradling her head, her face, smeared with blood
From within the labyrinth, Rath hears  begin to
(
) Hey
Tell me something, Bobby-boy
Electra comes to, her eyes blinking open
(
) Are you still thinking that you're going to take me
Electra is trying to focus, as Rath listens to the voice, searching the shadows but the voice seems to come from everywhere
(
) No,  don't think you are
You know what  think
The voice is closer
Rath wipes the stinging sweat from his eyes
(
) think you're thinking what 'm thinking
Still dizzy, Electra taps her fist against Rath's chest
(
) You know what 'm thinking, Bobby-boy
It seems as though Bain is in the room
(
) You know what 'm thinking
Electra opens her fist and inside Rath sees the handful of bullets from the other gun
Bain whirls  , his gun whipping around to Rath who turns too slow
Bain pumps the trigger
And The gun is empty
Yeah,  know what you're thinking
He levels his gun
Game over
Rath ,  and , emptying the  into Bain's head and chest, even as he crashes through the balcony railing and falls, twisting through lightless space, slamming to the stone floor dead
- The sun is gone, the market is closing, the crowd drifting from the plaza
man and a woman emerge from the shadows of the alley beside the boarded hotel
Although they walk a bit slow, leaning on one another, they become it seems, like just another couple, arm in arm, holding tightly to each other and to a very large suitcase
