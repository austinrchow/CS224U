2 sleek British sports car talks directly to us in a pixilated, garbled video
He's
Crates are visible behind him
We're in the shadowy bowels of a steel room
This is Agent Leland Turbo
have a flash transmission for Agent Finn McMissile
: Finn
My cover's been compromised
Everything's gone pear-shaped
: You won't believe what 've found out here
He angles our camera view, reveals a  through which we can see flames rising in the distance
This is bigger than anything we've ever seen
And no one even knows it exists
Finn,  need backup
But don't call the cavalry - it could blow the operation
And be careful
It's not safe out here
Time for Turbo to go
Transmitting my grids now
Good luck
Coordinates appear: 40 6

Alright buddy, we're here
Right where you paid me to bring you
Question is, why
metallic blue sports car, circa the `60s, emerges from the 2
shadows
Cagey, smooth, he'd turn heads driving through any intersection in the world
Meet
'm looking for a car
car
Hey pal, you can't get any further away from land than out here
Exactly where  want to be
Well  got news for you, buddy
There's nobody out here but us
Suddenly, a  -- a  , the size of most cruise ships
quickly backs into the shadows, out of sight
What are you doing out here
What does it look like, genius
'm crabbing
Well turn around and go back where you came from
Yeah
And who's gonna make me
laser sight hits Crabby between the eyes
Alright, alright
Don't get your prop in a twist
(as he turns to leave) What a jerk
Sorry, buddy
Looks like it's the end of the line
Buddy
' : Finn is gone
: - He  off the side of  , clandestine
We're with Finn as the ship continues on, cuts through the darkness with purpose
Suddenly small flames appear, perhaps a knot or so away
Then
flame rises above Finn, the ship
It illuminates an

Finn fires a   to the derrick and toward it
He's going to  into the side with brute force --- ---   sprout a magnetic exoskeleton
He  to the derrick and now
From this vantage point, hundreds of derricks appear
-   - Finn approaches a loading bay from above, hides
He watches as ,  and assorted other cars scurry about
( ) Leland Turbo, this is Finn McMissile
'm at the rally point
Over
No response
( ) Leland, it's Finn
Please respond
Over
below
boxy, monacle-wearing German car enters
This is
(in German and English) Too many cars here
Out of my way
Professor Zundapp
(
) Here it is, Professor
Zundapp approaches a   who idles next to a
You wanted to see this before we load it
Ah, yes
Very carefully
forklift opens the crate -- inside is a  , packed carefully in foam
Finn
Oh
camera
What does it actually do
4
This camera is extremely dangerous
( ) What are you up to now, Professor
Finn, angling for a better view,    --- --- which sail clear to the other side of the derrick --- ---
They hook tightly onto a steel girder
Finn slides out    like an acrobat, then expels another cross-wire for support
This is valuable equipment
Make sure it is properly secured for the voyage
You got it
Finn
He snaps more pictures
(
) Hey, Professor
Zundapp turns as a    -
and , an orange Gremlin and a green Pacer, flank it
This is one of those British spies we told you about
Yeah
This one we caught sticking his bumper where it didn't belong
Finn  -  from his side, readies himself for a tag-team spy fight with his buddy Leland
Agent Leland Turbo
The crate is lifted, revealing a ,  Leland Turbo
Finn's eyes go wide
Suddenly ---
Another derrick flame rises behind him, casts a Finn-shaped  over the Professor
He looks up
5
It's Finn McMissile
He's seen the camera
Kill him
Finn  with bullets as he starts to retreat --- He : are waiting for him on the catwalk where he just came from -  ready
Finn, stuck in midair, notices an angry
Finn , having just found his escape
Finn releases three of his four cables, swinging, Indiana Jones-style on the last one --- --- where he lands on its , drives  and where he  -  - onto another deck
Finn now , spraying oil and screeching around corners
in pursuit hits the oil patch, loses control --- --- and   the side of the rig
The Gremlin
it's like an eternity
He smashes into the water and breaks into a million pieces
- Now set upon by 20 or 30  pursuing cars
He has nowhere to go but    a ramp toward the helipad
He spies some  , fires a   which cuts through its leather straps, sending barrels  the ramp, --- ---  the pursuing  --- --- to the bottom where they  in a   back , taking out at least 15
- Finn blasts into view, pulls to a stop
No more road
Nowhere else to go
The 20    that are still in pursuit surround him, fire up their blowtorches
About to pounce
Finn
The second time we've seen this grin
It means he's got something cooking
Finn's   appear
He   off the edge of the helipad to the  of the other cars
Finn falls
He turns himself so he's grill first, cleanly cutting into the water
6
He , now sprouting  and speeds away
() Get to the boats
- an army of combat ships quickly  into the sea and   with unprecedented fury as they quickly make up the distance between them and Finn,   as they do so
He's getting away
Not for long
The    quietly drops a  into the water
It skips along, connecting with Finn in his rear and with such force that water skyrockets into the night clouds
- McMissile
Then, he blinks
He
We're starting to like this grin and what follows it
He now into a submarine
From his trunk he releases four tires which float to the surface like body parts
- Professor Zundapp watches it all from far away
( ) He's dead, Professor
Wunderbar
With Finn McMissile gone, who can stop us now
- , a rusty tow truck, putters into view
Mater
Tow Mater, that's who
is here to help you
He approaches a broken-down sedan on the side of the road
He drives around to the front, catching ' face for the first time
Hey, Otis
7
Hey, Mater
Gosh, 'm so sorry thought  could make it this time, but
(he tries to start his engine, stalls) Smooth like pudding, huh
Ah, who am  kidding
'll always be a lemon
Mater hooks his friend and starts towing him
Well dadgum, you're leaking oil again
Must be your gaskets
Hey, look on the bright side: This is your tenth tow this month, so that means it's on the house
You're the only one that's nice to lemons like me, Mater
Don't sweat it
These things happen to everybody, Otis
But you never leak oil
Yeah, but  ain't perfect
Don't tell nobody, but  think my rust is starting to show through
Mater and Otis drive past
It has been amended to say: "Home of Lightning McQueen
" Hey, is Lightning McQueen back yet
Not yet
He must be crazy-excited about winning his fourth Piston Cup
Four
Wow
8
Yeah, we're so dadgum proud of him
But  sure wish he'd hurry up and get back `cause we got a whole summer's worth of best friend fun to make up for
Just me and -- Ahead of them, a half-mile off, a    is visible
--- McQueen
Mater  , dragging poor Otis behind him
Uh, Mater
'm in no hurry
You don't need to go so fast
Boom
They hit a bump
Otis catches air
- Lightning McQueen is surrounded by his hometown friends
Oh, Lightning
Welcome home
Good to have you back, honey
Congratulations, man
Welcome home, soldier
The place wasn't the same without you, son
What
Did he go somewhere
It's good to be home, everybody
(
) McQueen
They all turn around, see Mater speeding into town, with Otis swerving behind him
Mater
9
McQueen
Mater skids into main street and in one swift motion, slingshots Otis forward --- Woaahhhhh
--- right through Ramone's front door --- ' - --- where he lands perfectly on the hydraulic lift
Ramone lifts him up, routine
Hey
How far'd you make it this time, Otis
Halfway to the county line
Not bad, man
know,  can't believe it either
- McQueen, welcome back
Mater, it's so good to see you
You too, buddy
Mater and McQueen do an    (fist bump style)
Oh, man
You ain't gonna believe the things  got planned for us
Everyone watches as the tire bump continues
(to Lizzie, an aside) These best friend greetings get longer every year
10
( ) You ready to have some serious fun
Well, actually 've got something to show you first
- It has now changed, been adorned with a small likeness of Doc
It says "Hudson Hornet Piston Cup
" Wow
can't believe they renamed the Piston Cup after our very own Doc Hudson
McQueen and Mater are alone, the museum closed to the public
McQueen approaches a "Hudson Hornet" wall with Doc's three Piston cups, framed articles, other racing ephemera
know Doc said these things were just old cups, but to have someone else win it just didn't feel right, you know
Well, Doc would've been real proud of you
That's for sure
McQueen takes this in
- McQueen and Mater exit the Doc Hudson Museum
Alright, pal
've been waiting all summer for this
What've you got planned
You sure you can handle it
Come on, you know who you're talking to
This is Lightning McQueen
can handle anything
11
- Mater and McQueen roll on an old train track, their tires off
They're on their rims
Uh
Mater
Just remember, your brakes ain't gonna work on these
As they head     --- (
) Mater
(
) Relax, these train tracks ain't been used in years
From inside the tunnel a loud
The two friends emerge, going as fast as they can on train tracks, uphill, with no tires
Come on, come on
Faster, faster
Moments later a harmless   appears, oversized horn visible, cackling and laughing at his prank
-    - An    sleeps
McQueen and Mater sneak up
This is gonna be good
They blow their horns and he  , tractor-tipping style
They  at the gag, but soon realize the earth mover's    is directly above them
Uh-oh
This ain't gonna be good
The exhaust pipe
McQueen and Mater are  out of view
- The sun sets
McQueen and Mater roll into town
McQueen looks exhausted
Mater is still full of energy
12
Boy, this was the best day ever
And my favorite souvenir
Mater proudly shows off a dent
This new dent
Boy, Mater
Today was, uh
Shoot, that was nothing
Wait til you see what  got planned for tonight
Mater, Mater
Whoa
was kind of thinking of just a quiet dinner
That's exactly what  was thinking
No,
meant with Sally, Mater
Even better
You, me and Miss Sally going out for supper
McQueen pulls around in front of Mater, stops
Mater,  meant it would be just me and Sally
Oh
It's just for tonight
We'll do whatever you want tomorrow
() Okay
Thanks for understanding
Yeah, sure
'all go on and have fun now
13
Alright, then
See ya soon, amigo
McQueen drives off
Mater watches him go
- It's been converted into a white-tablecloth restaurant, with cars dining al fresco and a hopping gastropub inside
have a prime table with a view of Radiator Springs and the starry night sky
This is so nice
can't tell you how good it is to be here alone
Just the two of us
Finally, you and me --- (
) Good evening
Mater is at their table, dressed as a waiter
My name is Mater and 'll be your waiter
( ) Mater the waiter
That's funny right there
Mater, you work here
Well yeah  work here
What'd you think,  just snuck in here when nobody was looking and pretended to be your waiter, just so  could hang out with you
McQueen and Sally exchange a look
Oh, yeah
How ridiculous would that be
Now, can  start you two lovebirds off with a couple drinks
14
Yes
'll have my usual
You know what
'm going to have that too
Mater blinks
Uh, right
Your usual
: - Fillmore and Sarge watch as Guido mixes drinks, ala "Cocktail
" Mater arrives
Guido
What's McQueen's usual
(in Italian, subtitled) How should  know
Perfect
Give me two of `em
Quiet
My program's on
(
) Tonight on "The Mel Dorado Show"
- "   ," a cable talk show, begins with file footage of  , a sleek
( ) His story gripped the world
Oil billionaire Miles Axlerod, in an attempt to become the first car to circumnavigate the globe without , ironically ran out of gas and found himself trapped in the wild
We see images of newspaper headlines, search crews
( ) Feared dead, he emerged 36 days later, running on a fuel he'd distilled himself from the natural elements
Since then he's sold his oil fortune, converted himself from a gas-guzzler into an electric car, and has devoted his life to finding a renewable, clean-burning fuel
15
Images of oil derricks torn down; Miles Axlerod getting converted to electric; lab scientists testing chemicals
( ) Now he claims to have done it with his Allinol
Images of fields, rivers, vegetables, and mountains all combining to form the Allinol logo
( ) And to show the world what his new superfuel can do, he's created a racing competition like no other, inviting the greatest champions from around the globe to battle in the first ever World Grand Prix
Welcome Sir Miles Axlerod
arrives, parks across from Mel's desk
( ) Thank you, Mel
It is very good to be here
Now listen to me: Big Oil
It costs a fortune
Pollution is getting worse
mean, come on
It's a fossil fuel
Fossil
As in dead dinosaurs
And we all know what happened to them
Alternative energy is the future
Trust me, Mel, after seeing Allinol in action at the World Grand Prix, nobody will ever go back to gasoline again
( ) What happened to the dinosaurs, now
( ) And on satellite, a World Grand Prix competitor and one of the fastest cars in the world, Francesco Bernoulli
Across the screen:   ,
We meet Formula race car
( ) It is an honor, Signore Dorado
For you
16
( ) Miles, why not invite Lightning McQueen
Mater, collecting his drinks, looks up, half-intrigued
( ) Of course we invited him
But apparently after a very long racing season he is taking some time off to rest
( ) Lightning McQueen would not have a chance against Francesco
Mater doesn't like this
( ) can go over 300 kilometers an hour
In miles that is like, uh
way faster than McQueen
( ) Let's go to the phones
Baltimore, Maryland, you're on the air
( ) Am  on
Hello
( ) You're on
Go ahead
( ) Hello
( ) Go ahead, caller
Dial tone
( ) Let's go to Radiator Springs
You're on, caller
'  ( ) Yeah, that Italian feller you got on there can't talk that way about Lightning McQueen
He's the bestest race car in the whole wide world
Fillmore and Sarge look around
Mater is visible in the back of the bar on an office phone
17
Uh-oh
( ) If he is, how you say "the bestest race car," then why must he rest, eh
'  ( ) Cause he knows what's important
Every now and then he prefers just to slow down, enjoy life
( ) Ah, you heard it
Lightning McQueen prefers to be slow
Of course, this is not news to Francesco
When want to go to sleep  watch one of his races
After two laps  am out cold
Audible  from the bar
crowd has been forming ever since Mater started talking
'  ( ) That ain't what  meant
: - They hear the commotion inside
Hey, what's going on over there
: - Sally and McQueen push through the crowd, see that they're watching Francesco on the television
( ) Oh, it's that Italian Formula car
His name is --- Francesco Bernoulli
No wonder there's a crowd
When Sally says his name, she enunciates each part, as if Italian were her mother's tongue
Wait, why do you know his name
And don't say it like that
It's three syllables, not ten
18
What
He's nice to look at
You know, open-wheeled and all
What's wrong with fenders thought you like my fenders
'  ( ) Well let me tell you something else there, Mr
San Francisco --- Mater
'  ( ) McQueen could drive circles around you
( ) Driving in circles is all he can do, no
'  ( ) No
mean yes
mean he could beat you anywhere, anytime, any track
On McQueen - he looks at Guido who gives a nod over to --- --- Mater, turned away from the crowd, still on the phone
( ) Mel, can we move on
Francesco needs a caller who can provide a little more intellectual stimulation
Like a dump truck
He doesn't like this at all
Ha ha
That shows what you know
Dump trucks is dumb
Suddenly, Mater is  from the booth and replaced by McQueen
( ) Yeah, hi, this is Lightning McQueen
Look,  don't appreciate my best friend being insulted like that
19
( ) McQueen
That was your best friend
This is the difference between you and Francesco
Francesco knows how good he is
He does not need to surround himself with tow trucks to prove it
Those are strong words from a car that is so fragile
( ) Fragile
He calls Francesco fragile
Not so fast, McQueen
"Not so fast
" What is that, your new motto
Francesco goes ballistic in Italian
They cut his mic
( ) Well, this sounds like something that needs to be settled on the race course
What do you say, Lightning McQueen
We've still got room for one more racer
Well,  would love to
The only thing is my crew's off for the season so --- sound
McQueen turns to see Fillmore, Sarge and Luigi flank a tablecloth which is hanging off the bar
Ramone backs away, having spray painted "  " on it
Guido quickly uncorks three wine bottles
Pit stop
McQueen turns back to the phone
You know what
They just got back
Deal me in, baby
Ka-chow
The place
- General excitement as McQueen exits the phone booth where Sally waits
Off her look: 20
know,  know
just got back
But we won't be long and --- Oh, no, don't worry about me
've got enough to do here
Mater's going to have a blast though
(off McQueen's silence) You're bringing Mater, right
You never bring him to any of your races
McQueen turns to the bar where Mater privately tries their drinks, hates it, spits it back in the glass
Just let him sit in the pits, give him a headset
'mon, it'll be a thrill of a lifetime for him
Mater arrives
Your drinks, sir
Mater
didn't taste it
How'd you like to come and see the world with me
You mean it
You got me into this thing
You're coming along
: - McQueen is given a new paint job and headlights by Ramone
Mater, now sporting a "Team McQueen" emblem, seems psyched as well
- An airport   advertises the next flight: Tokyo, Japan
- Mater waves goodbye with his hook alongside McQueen, Guido, Luigi, Fillmore and Sarge as --- 21
--- the rest of Radiator Springs watches them board a plane
Red bawls
-   ,
McQueen and Mater are the only ones awake, watch an insane Japanese game show
-
stylish Tokyo cityscape of neon, glamour, scrolling billboards, vending machines and high-tech skyscrapers
-     loaded with McQueen toys: Mater and McQueen enter
tourist sees McQueen and faints
-
Team McQueen watches a methodical dance
Mater, dressed in Kabuki makeup, arrives
He looks insane
-    - Two    wrestle over a parking space
Mater, now in his element, cheers
The   on this high note as we   --- -  - ----  , as they roll up the red carpet
Press is held at bay behind ropes
and  logos are strategically placed for maximum press exposure are interviewed by press behind the red-carpet ropes
- Team McQueen enters via a second floor landing which overlooks a massive indoor party in a converted museum
As they roll down a ramp to the party, they are awed
Guido, look
Ferraris and tires
Let's go
() Hey, look at this
Okay now Mater, remember: best behavior
You got it, buddy
Hey, what's that
He sees something, peels away
Mater
Hey, McQueen, over here
22
It's fellow racers   and
McQueen now has no choice but to let Mater go
Hey, Jeff
Lewis
: as he approaches a -   where a pitty  rocks with precision
He knocks on the glass with his hook
Hey
You done good
You got all the leaves
People turn at the noise he's making
: ,  and
Check out that tow truck
wonder who that guy's with
Will you guys excuse me just for one little second
He zips over to Mater's side, quickly pulls him out of sight
Mater, listen
This isn't Radiator Springs
You're just realizing that
Boy, that jet-lag really done a number on you
Mater, look -- things are different over here
Which means maybe you should, you know, act a little different too
Different than what
Well, just
help me out here, buddy
--- 23
You need help
Shoot, why didn't you just say so
That's what a tow truck does
Hey, looky there, it's Mr
San Francisco
is visible across the room, holding court
'll introduce you
Mater, no
(already on his way) Look at me -- 'm helping you already
On  -
Mater approaches, giddy
Hey Mr
San Francisco, 'd like you to meet --- Lightning McQueen
Buona sera
Nice to meet you, Francesco
Yeah, nice to meet you too
You are very good-looking
Not as good as thought, but you're good
( ) Excuse me
Can  get a picture with you
Anything for McQueen's friend
As Mater poses for a photo with Francesco: Miss Sally is gonna flip when she sees this
She's Lightning McQueen's girlfriend
Oooh
24
She's a big fan of yours
Hey, she has good taste
Mater's prone to exaggeration wouldn't say she's a "big" fan
You're right
She's a huge fan
She goes on and on about your open wheels here
Mentioning it once doesn't qualify as going "on and on
" Francesco is familiar with this reaction to Francesco
Women respect a car that has nothing to hide
Yeah, uh
Let us have a toast
McQueen doesn't like where this is going, covers
Let's
(raising a drink) dedicate my win tomorrow
to Miss Sally
Oh, sorry
already dedicated win tomorrow to her
So if we both do it, it's really not so special
Besides,  don't have a drink
'll go get you one
You mind if borrow a few bucks for one of them drinks
25
(could kill him) They're free, Mater
Free
Well, shoot, what am  doing here
Mater
should probably go keep an eye on him
See you at the race
McQueen starts to leave
Yes, you will see Francesco
But not like this
Francesco does a 180, so his rear end now faces McQueen
You will see him like this, as he drives away from you
Francesco wears a bumper sticker that says "Ciao, McQueen
" That's cute
So you had one of those made up for all the racers
No
Okay
He rolls off
He is so getting beat tomorrow
- Lights caress the main stage where a crowd has formed
Ladies and gentlecars
Sir Miles Axlerod
drives through an infinity fountain, appears
26
It is my absolute honor to introduce to you the competitors in the first-ever World Grand Prix
From Brazil
Number eight
He appears from the shadows, keeps a careful distance from the stage
He     --- ---       which roll, catching Miles Axlerod's speech for publicity and posterity
Finn's    each one, compares to the photos we saw him snap on the oil platform
Each one is " " His view is suddenly disrupted by She approaches Finn
Meet
Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator
That's because it's air-cooled
'm Agent Shiftwell, Holley Shiftwell from the Tokyo Station have a message from London
Not here
() You must try the canapes on the mezzanine
He moves her onto an elevator
The doors close on them
,
So the lab boys analyzed the photo sent
What did they learn about the camera
It appears to be a standard television camera
They said if you could get closer photos next time, that would be great
This was London's message
27
Oh -- no, no
No sir
Um, the oil platforms you were on
Turns out they're sitting on the biggest oil reserve in the world
How did we miss that
They'd been scrambling everyone's satellites
The Americans actually discovered it just before you did
They placed an agent on that platform, under deep cover
He was able to get a photo of the car who's running the entire operation
The doors  and they exit onto the Mezzanine
Who is it
Has anyone seen the photo yet
No, not yet
The American is here tonight to pass it to you
He'll signal you when he's ready
--- Finn suddenly
Oh no
Professor Zundapp is visible below them
He talks with a few Pacers and Gremlins
Finn quickly retreats into the shadows
Holley follows suit
What is it
Change of plan
You're meeting the American
What, me
28
Those thugs down there were on the oil platform
If they see me, the whole mission is compromised
No, no
'm technical, you see
'm in Diagnostics
'm not a field agent
You are now
: as he grabs a drink, keeps moving
'll take one of them
He snatches it, drops it in the back where we now see a large assortment of drinks balanced
Never know which one McQueen'll have a hankering for
He approaches a sushi bar
Hey, what you got here that's free
How about that pistachio ice cream
He refers to wasabi, of course
No, no
Wasabi
Oh, same ol', same ol'
What's up with you
That looks delicious
The chef starts to carve a small scoop aside for Mater
Uh, a little more, please
It is free, right
(the chef adds more) Keep it coming
little more
Come on, let's go, it's free
You're getting there
Scoop scoop
The chef gives in
Scoops a baseball-sized ball out
29
There you go
Now 's a scoop of ice cream
(in Japanese, subtitles) My condolences
: - He's now nearly done with his intros
and now, our last competitor --- Number 95, Lightning McQueen
approaches the microphone, flashes his headlights
Thank you so much for having us, Sir Axlerod
really look forward to racing
This is a great opportunity
Oh, the pleasure is all ours, Lightning
You and your team bring excellence and professionalism to this competition
As if on cue, Mater arrives with a piercing scream of pain
Everyone turns as he charges head first toward the stage, making a bee-line for that
Somebody get me water
He laps up water from the fountain like a diabetic cat
( ) Sweet relief
Miles Axlerod is shocked
The crowd can't believe it
Francesco cackles
Mater, now sated, approaches the mic
(to the crowd) Whatever you do, do not eat the free pistachio ice cream
It has turned
Sir Axlerod,  can explain
This is Mater
30
know him
This is the bloke that called into the television show
( ) You're the one  have to thank
No, thank you
This trip's been amazing
( ) He's a little excited, isn't he
to reveal a pool of oil beneath Mater
Mater
But wait,
oh, shoot
McQueen quickly pulls Mater aside, out of earshot of Miles Axlerod and the others
McQueen is beside himself
Mater, you have to get a hold of yourself
You're making a scene
But  never leak oil
Never
Go take care of yourself right now
Mater drives off
- He drives through the party, frantic
Coming through
Excuse me, leakin' oil
Where's the bathroom
Thank you
gotta go
Someone points Mater down a hallway
He whips around the --- --- and
Finds himself in front of   , neither of which clearly indicate  or
31
() What the
Mater chooses one, drives inside
is heard and Mater zips out
Sorry ladies
He heads into the other door --- : '  - Mater rolls in, still `holding it in' like a kid
never leak  never leak  never leak
He sees someone leaving a stall
He heads in
- Mater enters, looks up
Wowee
The stall is a complicated apparatus with buttons and lights
High-tech Japanese
It suddenly  , hoists him up as if he's going to get an oil change
What in the--- Japanese style cartoon  appears on a  , followed by images of waterfalls and rivers
() Hey, that tickles
The caricature starts talking in Japanese
Suddenly underneath Mater's undercarriage, goosing him
He freaks out
- With Mater's yells audible we see a enter, furtive
Suddenly, inexplicably, his frame like an egg, revealing an underneath
The pieces of the Gremlin disappear under him, clearly his disguise
This is   - American Agent
32
Okay, McMissile
'm here
It's time for the drop

Nervous
Her rearview monitor springs to life
( ) The American has activated his tracking beacon
( ) Roger that
Move in
- Rod Redline, waiting at a sink, feels a presence behind him
and  have entered, hesitate briefly when they see Rod Redline
Rod Redline, careful, slides a gun out of his tire
He is suddenly  by the AMCs --- Rod   and gets a shot off but is
, - begins --- - Mater, still , is now being  as if in a car wash
He is helpless
- Rod is being pulverized
Just when he scrambles away from one car, the other one takes over
- Mater is mercifully released, but when he backs out --- --- Rod Redline is   '  , crunching it and sending Mater --- ---     of the insane toilet
- Holley isolates the tracking beacon's location in the party
Oh, you've got to be joking
What's the problem, Shiftwell
He's in the loo
33
So go in
can't just go into the men's loo
Time is of the essence, Shiftwell
- Rod Redline is in bad shape
He backs away, betrays a look of concern
He's in trouble here
burns rubber, ready to finish him off
Just as he shifts into  --- --- '    , knocking  out
Mater jumps out, face-to-face
(out of breath) Whatever you do,  would not go in there
The door  shut, revealing the pulverized Acer
Gremlin and a Pacer
Rod Redline, now behind Mater and sensing an opportunity here, quickly produces
(to Grem and Acer) No offense to your makes and models, but you guys break down harder than my cousin Betsy after she got left at the --- Rod Redline, surreptitiously attaches the device to Mater's undercarriage
(as he's goosed) --- altar
He spins around, sees Rod Redline for the first time
Are you okay
'm fine
34
Hey
Tow truck
Mater turns back to Grem and Acer
We'd like to get to our private business here, if you don't mind
Oh, yeah
Don't let me get in the way of your "private business
" Oh
little advice: When you hear her giggle and see that waterfall, you best press that green button
Thank you
It's to adjust the temperature
Got it
Remember it's in Celsius, not Fahrenheit
Get outta here
Alright then
Mater exits, leaving Rod Redline to a now even angrier Grem and Acer
- Holley arrives at the door
She takes a breath, is about to enter when Mater
Excuse me, ma'am
He passes her, expelling some exhaust in the process
Holley's rearview tracking confirms that the device is on him
( ) Dadgum pistachio ice cream
35
( ) This cannot be him
( ) Is he American
(driving off, to himself) Look out, ladies
Mater's fittin' to get funky
( ) Extremely
( ) Then it's him
It's settled
Holley takes one more nervous breath, quickly closes the distance between her and Mater, cuts him off
He is forced to
Hello
Well, hello
Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator
Well of course it doesn't
That's `cause it's air-cooled
() Perfect
'm from the Tokyo Station --- Course, Karmann Ghia's weren't the only ones
Besides the Beetles you had your Type-3 Squarebacks, with the pancake motors
Yeah
Okay,  get it--- And before both of them, there's the Type-2 buses - my buddy Fillmore's one of them
36
Listen
We should find somewhere more private
Uh, gee
Don't you think that's a little, uh --- ( ) You're right
Impossible to know which areas here are compromised
So, when can  see you again
Well, let's see
Tomorrow 'll be out there at the races
Got it
We'll rendezvous then
- Mater returns to his team, lost in thought
There you are
Where have you been
What's a rendezvous
It's like a date
date
Mater, what's going on
Well, what's going on is 've got me a date tomorrow
Guido makes a crack in Italian
Guido don't believe you
Well, believe it
My new girlfriend just said so
Hey, there she is
Mater points out Holley, who's within earshot
37
() Hey
Hey lady
Holley, caught in plain view,
See ya tomorrow
Guido makes another crack in Italian
Guido still don't believe you
-   - An industrial dock, outside of the city proper
- Rod Redline dangles from a car magnet
He's been beaten up, clings to consciousness
(
) gotta admit --- Grem, Acer, and a bunch of nasty looking troublemakers look up at Rod amidst crates and shipping containers
--- you tricked us real good
And we don't like being tricked
Rod Redline laughs to himself
Hey, what's so funny
Well, you know,  was just wearing a disguise
You guys are stuck looking like that
This doesn't help him
They   onto a , lock him down
container is wheeled forward and Rod is plied with Allinol brand gasoline
Allinol
Thanks, fellas
hear this stuff is good for you
38
(
) So you think
The Professor emerges from the darkness, behind Rod
Allinol by itself is good for you
Zundapp hits a button and the  starts Rod's wheels spinning at a high rate of speed
But after microscopic examination, have found that it has one small weakness
When hit with an electromagnetic pulse, it becomes extremely dangerous
--- Grem pushes a World Grand Prix  - the same one that was in the box back at the oil derrick
He points it at Rod Redline
--- for the camera
Is that all you want
got a whole act
You were very interested in this camera on the oil platform
Now you will witness what it really does
Whatever you say, Professor
Acer pushes a   toward Rod
On it, surveillance footage from the party
Clearly, they were watching and recording him there
You talked up a lot of cars last night
Which one's your associate
Your mother
Oh no, 'm sorry
It was your sister
You know,  can't tell them apart these days
39
( ) Could  start it now, Professor
Fifty percent power
(to Rod Redline) This camera is actually an electromagnetic pulse emitter
(re: a girl on the ) What about her
Did you give it to her
The Allinol is now heating to a boil, dramatically expanding, causing the engine block to crack under the stress, forcing oil into the combustion chamber
Rod Redline's engine starts to  and
(re: a guy on the ) How about him
You talk to him
(to Professor Zundapp) What do  care
can replace an engine block
You may be able to, but after full impact of the pulse, unfortunately, there will be nothing to replace
How about him
Does he have it
The monitor reveals , rolling out of the bathroom and down the hall
Rod Redline, seeing this, does the world's most subtle double take
We caught it, but there's no way anyone else in the room could have --- That's him
He's the one
Roger that, Professor
40
No
As Grem turns up the machine even , the Professor makes a call
( ) Yes sir
We believe the infiltrator has passed along sensitive information
(beat, listening) will take care of it before any damage can be done
The Professor hangs up, turns to the room
The project is still on schedule
You will find this second agent --- Zundapp kicks the camera's power into the
--- and kill him
On the  - With Mater's frozen image on the screen we see Rod  in the reflection
- Over television pre-roll of Japan: (
) Japan
Land of the rising sun
Where ancient tradition meets modern technology
Welcome to the inaugural running of the World Grand Prix
as they introduce themselves: 'm Brent Mustangburger, here with racing legends Darrell Cartrip and David Hobbscap
There's never been a competition like this before
as the racers fuel up
(
) First, Allinol, making its debut tonight as the required fuel for all these great champions
() 41
(
) (') Second, the course itself, and it's like nothing we've ever seen
David, how exactly does this competition work
(
) Well, Brent, all three of these street courses are classic round- the-house racetracks
are shown
They're labeled Japan, Italy and England, and are different in shape and size
(
) This means that the  and Formula cars should break out of the gate in spectacular fashion
as they weave up the track, practicing
(
) Look for Francesco Bernoulli in particular to lead early
Francesco, featured in an inset
(
) And with a series of technical turns throughout --- of the course, now highlighting the tech turns
(
) and Touring cars like Spain's Miguel Camino should make up some ground but  doubt it'll be enough to stop Francesco from absolutely running away with it
(
) Woah, now just hold your horsepower
You're forgetting the most important factor here
That early dirt track section of the course
The dirt is supposed to be the great equalizer in this race
now isolate a stretch after the first couple turns, label it "
" 42
(
) French Rally car Raoul CaRoule is counting on a big boost headed through there
(
) And don't forget Lightning McQueen
His mentor, the Hudson Hornet, was one of the greatest dirt track racers of all time
In my opinion, McQueen is the best all-around racer in this competition
Really, Darrell,  think you need to clean your windshield
You're clearly not seeing this for what it is: Francesco's race to lose
- (
) It's time to find out
The racers are locking into the grid --- Engines rev as everyone gets ready to go
Everyone's bright eyed and alert except for McQueen who we find in the back of the grid
He  his eyes
( ) Speed
am speed
McQueen opens his eyes
Francesco is next to him on the grid
Really
You are "speed"
Then Francesco is triple speed
(closes his eyes) Francesco
Is
Triple speed
Francesco likes this, McQueen
It's really getting him into the zone
He is so getting beat today
The starting lights click down from  to  to
The race begins
Francesco quickly grabs the lead
He's pulling away within seconds
43
- We   as the various Crew Chiefs on their crash carts bark orders to their racers
We end on Team McQueen
No Crew Chief, just a solid looking team
His suspension stats look good
Tire pressure is excellent
He's got plenty of fuel
And he's awesome
: The same view of Mater but now
Reveal Finn and Holley watching from high above in a downtown office building, behind reflective glass
Why is he in the pits
He's so exposed
It's his cover
One of the best 've seen, too
Look at the detail on that rust
It must have cost him a fortune
But why hasn't he contacted us yet
There's probably heat on him
Be patient
Right, of course
He'll signal us when he can
And then we find out who's behind all this
-      through Tokyo as Francesco extends his lead and McQueen attempts to make up ground
44
'  - Mater watches the monitors, sees them approaching the dirt section
McQueen
It's time to make your move
Get on the outside and show 'em what Doc done taught you
( ) Ten four, Mater
- Francesco hits the dirt section and loses all control
He  to a halt, his tires getting no traction
(
) Francesco is brought to a screeching halt
skids into view, turning right to go left, passing Francesco, followed by other cars --- (
) Lightning McQueen is the first to take advantage
And just like that, folks, Francesco's lead is left in the dust
Nice call, Mater
Keep it up
McQueen now leads the pack, zooming out of the dirt now starting to relax
(
) Who-hoo
Man, McQueen looks happier than a rollbar at a demolition derby
- The field of cars thunders into a tunnel
(
) Everyone's jostling for position as we hit the asphalt again
Francesco crests the hill, in last place
He bites down, determined, then
(
) Francesco lost a lot of momentum in the dirt
He's got some serious work ahead of him if he wants to get back in this race
45
as the racers move through the Rainbow Bridge
Bit by bit, Francesco ekes his way toward the front, toward Lightning McQueen as we   --- ---  , and a
Grem and Acer are manning this one
They focus it on the racers as they approach
( ) It is time
Roger that
-  racer (Miguel Camino) suddenly and skids out
(
) Oh
Miguel Camino has blown an engine
(
) Very unusual, Darrell
He's been so consistent all year
Camino quickly pits, passing McQueen's pit where Mater is visible
, watching from above
You gotta be kidding me
What is it
It's that tow truck from the bathroom
The one from the bathroom
Yeah, the one the American Agent passed the device to
What about him
What about him
He's in the pits
46
Not for long
Acer exits, with purpose
, still in their office hideaway
Holley's onboard computer flashes an
Hold on
think 've got something
What is it
The Pacer from the party last night
She's spotted Acer, moving swiftly forward
Cross-referencing with the photos from the oil derricks
Yep
His numbers match
Anyone with him
He won't be alone
Conducting analysis on the target
The computer finds more and more bad guy Pacers and Gremlins are in the crowd
He's not the only one here
Three
five
they're everywhere
And they're all closing in on
oh no
We   to see it's
Finn
Finn, where are you
She turns
He's , leaving only an open window
( ) Get him out of the pits now
'
car
47
Wow
Some of them fellers is really loud
( ' ) Can you hear me
Over
Uh, what
( ' ) Get out of the pit now
Do you hear me
Mater realizes this girl has somehow broken into his radio
( ) Hey,  know you
You're that girl from the party last night
You wanna do our date right now
- McQueen boxes out Francesco, holds his slim lead, but barely
Guys, a little too much chatter
Let's keep this line clear
racer behind McQueen suddenly expels black smoke, skids out of control
- laughing
That was clearly his handiwork
'  - ( ' ) There's no time for messing about
You've got to get out of the pits
Is there gonna be cable where you is so  can watch the rest of the race
- Watching from the downtown building
( ) You're running out of time
( ) They're coming, Shiftwell
( ) Yes,  know
48
( ) Get him out of there
( ) 'm trying
( ) Get out now
We    --- ---
He gives in, exits the pit
Well, all right but  usually like to have a proper detailing done before  meet a lady friend
He moves toward the back  , is about to open it
-  and another Pacer approach McQueen's pit door on the other side
Ready to pounce
The doors , --- --- Finn, holding a fire extinguisher
Finn McMissile
But you're dead
Then this shouldn't hurt at all
He empties the extinguisher in their eyes, speeds past
They try and follow, but have been blinded
One of them crashes right into a
- Already on the move, along a side street
Miss Shiftwell
- Tracking everything on a grid map
Mater looks like Pac Man, weaving through the streets as bad guys close in all around him
've got him in the back alleys east of the garages
Multiple assailants are closing in quickly
( ) Keep him moving
'm on my way
- He turns a corner, sees a flower shop
49
Hey, new lady friend
You like flowers
- McQueen, hearing this, is taken aback
What
- Slowing at the flower shop
( ) No
Don't go 'in' anywhere
Just keep moving
Stay outside
Gotcha
Outside
McQueen drifts outside allowing Francesco to slip past
Grazie and arrivaderci
(
) cannot believe what  just saw, Brent
That was a bonehead move
You don't open up the inside like that
- As Mater moves on he's followed by Pacers and Gremlins
Suddenly --- ---  whip in front of them, pulling over flower vending machines and sending the shop's owners into a frenzy
They direct their attention to the AMCs, who try and explain
, admiring his handiwork as he appears
Just as he turns to leave he's  and pushed
- Finn finds himself boxed by two Pacers and pushed toward --- --- , who now holds a
This time 'm gonna make sure you stay dead
He hits the flame
50
- Mater clicks along, still looking for Holley
Just as he passes the alley entrance where Finn stares down death: ( ) You're doing brilliantly
Now just stay focused
What's that
You want me to head toward that ruckus
Mater turns  the alley
( ) No
Don't go down that street
- Finn, now nearly pushed completely into the flame thrower, leaps into the air
He  , using his wheels, axle, indeed his entire car frame as if he were human, kicking and tossing and shooting his enemies
Mater witnesses the whole thing
Wow
live karate demonstration
- McQueen, now playing catch-up again, scowls
Stop it, Mater
Just sign off
- Finn polishes off the AMCs by firing a bullet into a gas main line, causing an  that tosses Acer through the air where he lands in a  '
- The end of the race is nigh --- (
) They're bumper to bumper as they approach the finish line
The Formula car gets there first
(
) Francesco's the winner, McQueen's number two
- Finn heaves breaths, surveys his damage
That was cool
Hey, can  get your autograph
51
Mater approaches when a     burst out a door, momentarily blocking Mater's view of Finn
Once the fans have past, Finn has disappeared
Hey, where'd he go
( ) Our rendezvous has been jeopardized
Keep the device safe
We'll be in touch
Dadgum, did  miss our date
- Post race press conference
Francesco is center stage
Francesco, over here
Hey, what was your strategy today
Strategia
Francesco needs no strategy, it's very simple
You start the race, wait for Lightning McQueen to choke, pass him, then win
Francesco always wins
It's boring
McQueen, waiting in the wings, rolls his eyes
He suddenly notices something
McQueen's
- It's , appearing from a side street, moving toward the pits, oblivious of the press conference
( ) gotta tell you, dude
You were in trouble for awhile
That dirt track section had you crawling
As McQueen   --- To truly crush one's dream, you must first raise their hopes very high
'   - Mater looks around for everyone as McQueen approaches
52
Mater
Hey McQueen
What happened
Is the race over
You won, right
Mater, why were you yelling things at me while  was racing
Yelling
Oh, you thought
that's funny right there
Nah, see that's `cause  seen these two fellers doing some sort of karate street performance
It was nutso
One of them even had a flamethrower --- flamethrower
What are you talking about
don't understand
Where were you
Going to meet my date
Your date
She started talking to me as a voice in my head, telling me where to go --- What
Wait a minute --  didn't screw you up, did
lost the race because of you
Well, 'm sorry
didn't mean --- An imaginary girlfriend, flamethrowers
This is exactly why don't bring you along to these things
53
Maybe if ,  don't know, talked to somebody and explained what happened  could help
don't need your help
don't want your help
(
) Hey, there he is
The press finds McQueen, swarms him
Mater is pushed backwards as the questions fly again
- McQueen, you had it in the bag
- Yeah, what happened
made a mistake
But  can assure you, it won't happen again
On Mater
He takes this badly
Look, guys
We know what the problem is and we've taken care of it
: and various other highlights: Lightning McQueen loses in the last lap to Francesco Bernoulli in the first race of the World Grand Prix and three, count em, three cars flamed out leading some to suggest that their fuel, Allinol, might be to blame
, speaking to an aggressive press
He must  over the press
Allinol is safe
Alternative fuel is safe
There is no way my fuel caused these cars to flame out
54
- Darrell, Brent and David talk to camera
Well the jury may still be out on whether Allinol caused these accidents, but one thing's for sure: Lightning McQueen blew this race
Off a   of McQueen crossing the finish line, a look of severe consternation across his face --- Team McQueen can't be happy right now
---    --- -  - --- McQueen's  , on a Team McQueen poster
to reveal Mater looking at it, sadly
He drives on, passing (but not noticing) --- ---  and
-
Cars take off their tires, move through the metal detector
Mater waits in line
approaches Mater
(in Japanese and English) Come with me please, sir
But 'm gonna miss my plane
'  -
The Security Car leads Mater inside
Right this way
As they move past us the Security Car covertly drops a which rolls into a corner
The ball bearing then sprouts  , tripods itself and  out, revealing itself to be a tiny
- '  - Mater follows the Security Car in, nervous
55
Doggone it
This is about my hook, isn't it
know  should've checked it, but  can't really, look -- it's attached to me
The Security Car suddenly  himself, reveals himself to be Finn McMissile
Hey,  know you
You're that feller from the karate demonstration
never properly introduced myself
Finn McMissile
British Intelligence
Tow Mater
Average intelligence
Who are you with
,
Let's just say 'm triple- affiliated
You know,  know some karate
don't wanna brag or nothing, but 've got me a black fan belt
Finn's rearview alarms
His camera has picked up Grem and Acer
They've just entered the lounge, are right around the corner
Hey, you wanna see some moves made up
You're being followed
Finn quickly turns, fires a tiny    at the window
As Mater talks, oblivious, the beetle cuts out a round hole
This first one  can reach into a car's hood, pull out his battery, and show it to him before he stalls
call it, "What accidentally did to my friend Luigi once
" 56
Mater does his best (worst) karate moves as Acer and Grem turn the corner
There he is
The glass drops away, leaving a car-sized hole
(eyes the clock) Look,  probably ought to go
'm about to miss my flight
Don't worry
Finn  Mater from behind
He   forward --- 've taken care of that
Hang on
--- and
-  - Finn pulls Mater down  onto the tarmac, towing him away from the terminal
This is First Class service
You don't even have to go through the terminal
and  appear, chasing them
Mater, who is facing backward as he is being pulled along, faces them
They're about a hundred yards back
( ) Your karate partners are back here
They kinda look like they're trying to catch up
Drive forward
Whatever you do, don't stop
Finn  around, whipping Mater in a 180 so that Mater is now towing Finn
Grem produces a , lines up Finn as his target
57
Finn, without hesitation, fires a  -
The jack toward Grem, anchors itself under his frame and flips him like a turtle but not before Grem gets the rocket --- - it flies toward Mater and Finn
aims and launches a  back
-,
(only hearing this) Is everything okay back there
(
) Finn, it's Sid
'm on approach
wings into view overhead
This is
Roger that
Mater looks up:  screeches into view up ahead, dragging a long row of luggage carts in Mater's path, attempting to create an accident
( ) You remember that whole thing about me not stopping no matter what
Just as it looks dire --- descends, hawklike, fires bullets and blows the luggage carts sky-high
Mater and Finn burst through them, luggage now raining down from above
knew  should've done carry-on
( ) Thanks, old boy
Siddeley   on the tarmac ahead of them
No time to stop, he  his back open, revealing
Hey, doggone it
It's my imaginary girlfriend
Come on
Get in here
58
Mater   toward Siddeley's ramp, Holley
( ) Boy  tell you what, you really do want this first date, don't ya
That's a no-quit attitude right there
Just as Mater's wheels touch the ramp,   around him in a spray
Siddeley is , a tire
He yells in pain
Hold on, Sid
Siddeley peels off the runway onto the grass
gunfight ensues between Finn and Acer
Finn  ' , blowing it and throwing him off-course
Acer  out of control, drives up and    --- ---     where he lands in an oil tanker
- He's headed toward the edge of the tarmac, where the grass and runway meet
He   , his only hope
Finn, it's now or never
Finn , 180s and grabs the ramp just as Siddeley gets air
Hold on
Mater, the only thing not in the jet, dangles and recedes from our view as Siddeley climbs toward the clouds
As he's in through the back hatch: (
) By the time you read this,  will be safely on an airplane, flying home
-  -  - a handwritten (er, tire-written
)  in childish scrawl
We don't see all of it, only a bit
Mater's voice begins the note with the first sentence, but we into McQueen's voice
59
"'m so sorry for what  did don't want to be the cause of you losing any more races
want you to go prove to the world what already know - that you are the greatest race car in the whole wide world
Your best friend, Mater
" McQueen takes this in
didn't really want him to leave
Wait, there's more here
() "
Please tell the hotel didn't mean to order that movie thought it was just a preview and didn't realize  was paying for it
That's funny right there -- " (to the others) There's a few more pages of
's here
( ) Well, at least  know if he's at home he'll be safe
- breaks through some cloud cover, flies with purpose
- well-appointed spy jet
Various computers line the walls
Now that's how  like to start the day
You never feel more alive than when you're almost dead
( ) hope that device didn't fall off
That's the closest  ever been to missing my flight
That was --- 60
With a  , Holley grabs the   that Rod Redline hid under Mater
She yanks it out with a
() Yow
Still in one piece, great
Holley drops the device into a mainframe computer
It starts "
" gotta go to a doctor
keep getting these sharp pains in my undercarriage
Downloading the photo now
Hey, lemme introduce you two
( ) This here is Finn McSomething-or- other
He's a First Class airport whatchamacallit
And Finn, this here's my date
( ) never did get your name
Oh yes, sorry
It's Shiftwell
Holley Shiftwell
( ) It's Shiftwell
Holley --- The computer is done analyzing
The cabin lights dim
Finally
Time to see who's behind all this
is blasted between the three of them
It's of a photograph, a complicated melange of metallic parts stuck together
(to Mater, expectantly) What is this
61
Well, that's one of the worst engines ever made
It's an old aluminum V8 with a Lucas electrical system and Whitworth bolts
Shoot, them Whitworth bolts is a pain, tell you what
Them ain't metric, they ain't inches
Yes, , right
But who's engine is this, Mater
Well, it's kinda hard to tell from this picture, ain't it
But you're the one who took it
Holley
Oh, right
Yes, of course
" good agent gets what he can, then gets out before he's killed
" Sorry
Agent
You mean like insurance agent, like, () `Like a good neighbor, Mater is there'
Wait, you mean secret agents
You guys is spies
Holley, in how many makes and models did this type of engine appear
Holley has these stats in seconds
Kid's play
It was standard in seven models over a 12-year period
At least 35,000 cars were made with this engine
Mater    , through one part of the hologram so he's face-to-face with Holley
You're pretty
62
() Yes, alright
Thank you
And so nice
Just pay attention
She moves the engine photo so it's now blocking Mater again
This seems like a dead end
If there were something in the photo that could narrow this down a bit 'd be a lot happier
You might not be happy, but  bet this feller is
See how he's had most of his parts replaced
And see all them boxes over there
Them's all original parts
They ain't easy to come by
Rare parts
That's something we can track
Exactly
Holley drops her screen down
Well done, Mater
would never have seen that
( ) know of a black-market parts dealer in Paris, a treacherous lowlife
But, he's the only car in the world who can tell us whose engine this is
Mater, what would you say to setting up an informal task force on this one
Wait, what
63
You obviously have plenty of experience in the field
Well yeah  live right next to one
(thinks about it) don't know, Finn
ain't exactly been much help to anybody recently
You're helping me
Please, Mater
Well, okay
But you know 'm just a tow truck, right
Right
And 'm just in the import/export business
Siddeley
Yes, Finn
Paris
Tout de suite
Yeah, two of them sweets for me too, Sid
( ) You know,  always wanted to be a spy
( ) Really
Me too
Afterburners, sir
Is there any other way
- Siddeley   , they kick forward like a mule as we --- : Mater attempts to merge into roundabout traffic; mimes annoy tourists at the Eiffel Tower; a painter works his magic on an unattractive couple; a couple kisses on the most romantic spot in the world; we might even catch '
64
The charming, low-key introduction ends with a of Paris's center from far away as we    --- - --- a dirty street in the 1st Arrondissement
Finn and Holley drive along together as Mater, playing "spy," darts back and forth behind them from doorway to dumpster, "hiding out
" He's having a ball
( ) Once we're inside, stay close
Don't bother checking  numbers for criminal records, they're all dodgy here
No  scans
Got it
Don't talk to anyone
Don't look at anyone
And absolutely, positively no idling
Are we clear
Yes, right
No idling
Yes, sir
Mater
Yeah, Finn
We're not here to go shopping
As Finn and Holley and Mater turn the corner
Shopping
What do you mean
Why would  --- Mater turns the corner and enters a massive Les Halles- inspired Parisian market filled with car parts
tow truck's dream
Dadgum
- Parts for sale, Monsieur
- Monsieur
Parts for sale
65
- Mater rolls along, impressed by the goods for sale
You gotta be kidding me - they've got everything here
Look at them hoods
could use a hood
Mater continues on though, heeding Finn's advice
Sorry fellers,  gotta go
- Mater, now out of sight of Finn and Holley, passes a darkened stall
He , peers in
There's someone in there
Excuse me
What are you selling
It suddenly  its headlights revealing
In French, the mutant car pitches his wares to Mater
Mater , speeds off,
- few car lengths ahead of Mater
They roll along, looking for
Aha
Finn and Holley recede into the shadows
In '  : , a three-wheeled parts dealer, argues with a French customer
There you are
Mater suddenly turns the corner, sees Finn and Holley
Man, there are some great --- Mater, get back
Too late
Tomber sees Mater, then notices , reflected in a hubcap
He
Finn and Holley give chase
Hey, wait for me
Tomber, skidding away, kicks a tent in Finn's way
Holley quickly pivots  and disappears
Where did she go

Finn, hot in pursuit, leaps another obstacle and loses ground --- --- Tomber who turns a corner and finds himself grill to grill with
He whips to the left but  , rolling sideways and  to a stop
Holley  him with
Finn suddenly arrives, stops her
( ) Have you lost your mind
But  thought --- Mater
This chap needs a tow
Hook him up
Sure thing
: - Mater tows Tomber, following Finn and Holley
You rusty piece of junk, get your dirty hook off me
- Finn throws open a door
Cars scatter like cockroaches
(to the cars) Allez
Maintenant - vite
Mater unhooks an angry Tomber who spits in French
Finn pulls the door down
As it   --- ( ) Electroshock
Are you kidding me
Easy, Tomber
This is her first field assignment - she didn't know you were my informant
Informant
67
rookie, eh
never liked new car- smell
Holley  with anger
Tomber was doing 20 to life in a Moroccan impound the first time saved him, if  recall correctly
Speaking of recalls, you're getting up there in mileage aren't you, Finn
Alright, we get it
You both know each other, you're both old
So
Holley shoots a   of the engine in front of Tomber
There you go, informant
Inform us
Tomber eyes the photo
He recoils, unimpressed
That is the worst motor ever made
Suddenly, Tomber narrows his gaze
Wait
That oil filter
those wheel bearings
Do those parts look familiar, Tomber
They should
sold them
To whom
No idea
He's my best customer, but he always does his business over the phone
was always wondering why he needs so many parts
Now know
68
Well, a lemon needs parts
Ain't nothing truer than that
"Lemon
" Yeah, you know
Cars that don't ever work right
Lemons is a tow truck's bread and butter
Like them Gremlins and Pacers we run into at the party and the race and the airport
Holley, pull up the pictures from the oil platform
want to know what other type of cars were out there
Holley complies and suddenly hang suspended in the air in front of them
Right
Let's see
There were Hugos
And Trunkovs
Mater, are these cars considered lemons
Is the Popemobile Catholic
Finn
Everyone involved in this plot is one of history's biggest loser cars
Holley refers to the  , which now rises forward as the prominent picture, perhaps the only one in view
And they're all taking their orders from the car behind this engine
This explains it
What, Tomber
69
Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo and Trunkovs never get together
But they're having a secret meeting in two days
Where's this meeting taking place
Porto Corsa, Italy
That's where the next race is
Then there's a good chance our mystery engine will be there too
Your chances are more than good just sent him a new clutch assembly yesterday
to Porto Corsa
Holley, contact Stephenson and have him meet us at Gare de Lyon
Good work

It  into a --- (
) Boy, 'll tell you what
That three- wheeled feller had to be right about a big meeting
-  - Mater, Finn and Holley scroll through surveillance-style photos of  on an Italian street
They're in the front train car, which doubles as a luxury seating area and intelligence command center
You never see this many lemons in one town
Unless there's a swap meet, or something
( ) () 70
(') Hey, how'd you get all them pictures
Well,  remotely reprogrammed Porto Corsa's red light cameras to do recognition scans
Wow, not only is you the prettiest car  ever met, but you the smartest too
Thank you
think
That's a familiar sight
Mater refers to a photo of  , the  Lemonhead, being towed by an
Hugo being towed
But he looks absolutely perfect
Of course
They must be the heads of the lemon families
Makes sense
If  was rich and broke down every day, 'd hire me to tow me around all the time too
We've got to infiltrate that meeting
It's the only way to find out who's behind all this
( ) Hang on a minute
What
Hold still
Holley  Mater's picture, temporarily blinding him
Ahh
71
Holley turns back to her monitor
Mater's face appears on screen
She quickly  it over the Hugo's tow truck's
Good job, Miss Shiftwell
Holley isn't sure what surprises her more: the compliment or how pleased it makes her
Thank you, Finn
Boy,  sure wish my friends could see me now
-  -    - quaint Italian piazza
pristine  , complete with ancient trident, looms in our view
Luigi and Guido roll into view
Guido, your eyes do not deceive you
We are in Italy
We are home
Sarge, Fillmore and McQueen exit a  transport truck
Hey, Luigi
Which way to the hotel, man
What
No friends of mine will stay in a hotel in my village
You will stay with my --- Uncle Topolino
, a distinguished 1937 Fiat Topolino, rolls forward
He greets them warmly with affectionate Italian salutations as word of Guido and Luigi's arrival spreads
The square  with family and friends
- festive homecoming party
Lights strung across the square
Music and dancing
Fillmore and Sarge are at a dining table
How do they do it
These are the same ingredients as back home, but it tastes so good
72
It's organic, man
Tree hugger

Uncle Topolino beckons McQueen over
You look so down, so low
Is like you have flat tires
, a hefty Italian grandmother pipes up, a mile a minute then drives off, now a car on a mission
She said you look like you're starving
That she's going to make you a big meal, and fatten you up
No, Mama Topolino, please
You don't need to make a fuss
Too late
She's disappeared inside her kitchen
Capisco
understand
Is a problem, yes
Between you and a friend
How'd you know that
wise car hears one word and understands two
McQueen takes this in, impressed
That, and Luigi told me
While Mama cooks, come and take a stroll with me
They amble forward, Uncle Topolino setting the pace
73
brought my friend Mater along on the trip
And  told him he needed to act different, that we weren't in Radiator Springs
This Mater
He's a close friend
He's my best friend
Then why would you ask him to be someone else
McQueen considers this - a realization
What did  do
said some things during our fight
You know, back when Guido and Luigi used to work for me, they would fight over everything
- Guido dances with a girl
Luigi suddenly They begin to
They fight over what Ferrari was the best Ferrari; which one of them look more like a Ferrari
There were even some non-Ferrari fights
Guido now  Luigi, cuts  in
So  tell them, va bene
It's okay to fight
Everybody fights now and then, especially best friends
McQueen takes this in
Seems to take some small comfort
But you gotta make up fast
McQueen's comfort quickly evaporates
No fight more important than friendship
74
Guido and Luigi now dance together with the girl and her friend who has just arrived
All having a great time
They dance past us, crossing in front of We   them
Chi trova un'amico, trova un tesoro
What does that mean
() Whoever find a friend, find a treasure
Mama Topolino drops a tray of food in front of McQueen
Now, mangia
Eat
, distant, taking all of this in, lost in thought as, in the background, Uncle Topolino and Mama Topolino talk, then argue, then make up (all in Italian) all while we stay on McQueen's pensive face --- - Stephenson glides along, all business
Finn, one hour to Porto Corsa
-  - Thank you, Stephenson
Finn watches as  attaches a new   on Mater's roof
It looks exactly like his old one
That should just about do it
Perfect
So Mater, it's voice-activated
But you know, everything's voice- activated these days
75
What
thought you was supposed to be making me a disguise
' Voice recognized
Disguise Program Initiated
disguise suddenly umbrellas out, emitted from Mater's roof
It drops a clean cloaking image of the     over Mater
Cool
Hey, computer
Make me a German truck

Mater suddenly wears lederhosen and a German hat
Check it out
'm wearing Materhosen
Make me a monster truck
' Request acknowledged
He's transformed into Dracula, complete with fangs

Now make me a taco truck
' Request acknowledged
funny car
' Request acknowledged
Finn suddenly pushes a button, stops the madness
The idea is to keep a low profile, Mater
Mater, chastened, moves on
76
So  just go in, pretend to be this truck
And leave the rest to us
Now hold still
Holley turns back to her work
The disguise's cloaking is larger than Mater
As a result, Holley must dial it back to fit his body
As she carefully calibrates the hologram: have to do the final fitting on your disguise
Holley
The 3D disguise is now flush with his frame, but dents
Oh dear
That's no good
She deploys    on a robotic arm, moves it toward one of Mater's
Mater pulls away
Hey, what are you doing
The disguise won't calibrate effectively without a smooth surface to graft onto
Oh
For a second there  thought you was trying to fix my dents
was
Well then no thank you
don't get them dents buffed, pulled, filled or painted by nobody
They're way too valuable
Your dents are valuable
come by each one of them with my best friend Lightning McQueen
() 77
(') don't fix these
want to remember these dents forever
So you were being serious in Paris
McQueen isn't just part of your cover
Friendships can be dangerous in our line of work, Mater
But my line of work is towing and salvage
Right
And Miss Shiftwell's is designing iPhone apps
No,  meant for real
--- It's okay
Say no more
'll work around the dent
In the meantime
Finn hits a button
The walls transform into a You look a little light on weapons

) Well Brent, they call this place "The Gem of the Riviera," and it's easy to see why

The big news continues to be Allinol
Sir Miles Axlerod spoke to the press earlier today to answer questions about its safety
- Miles Axlerod, at a podium, addresses the press throng
He looks a bit exasperated
79
An independent panel of scientists has determined that Allinol is completely safe
Okay
Safe
There it is
So the race will go on, folks
show Francesco with 10 points at the top of the race standings
But the question everyone is asking: Will the real Lightning McQueen show up today
- As the racers begin to get into position on the grid
(
) Well, he better
Talk about a home- track advantage
Francesco Bernoulli grew up racing on this course
(
) Signore e signori, in the pole position, numero uno
The crowd is cheering already, knows who this is
(
) Francescoooooo
The Italian crowd roars and chants for their hometown hero
(to the crowd) Bellissima
Thank you for your support
( ) And your big mistake, McQueen
McQueen missed this comment
He approaches his grid position, lost in thought
(
) In the secondo position
Numero novantacinque
Lightning McQueen
Cheers (not so thunderous, obviously) from the crowd
McQueen doesn't seem to notice
80
'  - His team exchanges looks, worried
McQueen
Is everything okay
If you're worried about your fuel, man, don't
It's perfectly safe
No, guys,  just really wish Mater were here
(
) Francesco understands, McQueen
Francesco parks next to him, grinning
Oh, great
Here it comes
What've you got, Francesco
For famous race cars like Francesco and well
you, to be far away from home is not easy
think you forgot the insulting part of that insult
Is no insult
When Francesco is away from home, he misses his mama just like you miss your tow truck amico
Gee,  maybe misjudged you, because that's exactly how  --- Of course,  am at home
And my mama is right here
Francesco refers to his  who sits in a special box in the crowd, cheering him on, blowing him kisses
() Mama
Don't worry, Mama

will beat his cry-baby bottom today
And there's the insult we were missing

Scusatemi, tutti

Holley arrives, sporting a decent Italian accent
Mio nonno, my grandfather, has broken down
If one of you would help  would be so thankful
,      (the one Holley and Finn prepped Mater to impersonate), drives forward
Sounds like you need some "roadside assistance"
She was talking to me, Ivan
82
Oh really
Prove it
No, no, don't fight over me
Holley directs her interest toward Ivan
Signore Tow Truck, per favore
: - He watches this from a safe hiding spot around a corner
(
) Get ready, Mater
: , at an outdoor cafe on the casino grounds
You're on any moment now
: , now looking a bit nervous
He backs out of sight
don't know about this, Finn
What if  screw things up
( ) Impossible
Just apply the same level of dedication you've been using to play the "idiot tow truck" and you'll be fine
It's just that them guys look pretty tough and --- Wait, did you say "idiot"
Is that how you see me
( ) That's how everyone sees you
Isn't that the idea
tell you, that's the genius of it
No one realizes they're being fooled because they're too busy laughing at the fool
Brilliant
While Finn talks, Mater takes this in
He catches his own reflection in a nearby window
Seems to be seeing himself with new eyes
83
Mater jumps at the sound, turns in time to see Ivan by Holley's
Why aren't you in disguise
, uh--- Come on, there's no time
Go
Okay, okay
Computer: disguise
' Request acknowledged
- Mater, now disguised as Ivan the Tow Truck, approaches the Hugos
Another    arrives
It's the boss
He is coming
The carrier parks and the back opens
waits
Ivan
Mater realizes Victor is talking to him
He hops to it
Ivan, why do you insult me so by making me wait
Mater, now with Victor hooked, tows him in the front doors of the casino

He's in
-   - McQueen and Francesco battle for first place --- (
) The racers are now making their way around the hairpin, and headed downhill toward the casino bridge

- Cars play craps with  ; slot machines with odometers for jackpot numbers; cigarette girls sell car items
Air Freshener, antenna balls, sparkplugs
- He tows
They are flanked on all four corners by Hugo thugs, ala a presidential motorcade
The largess of the interior design seems to finally snap Mater out of his funk
(-) Wow, this place looks like it's made out of gold
The Hugos on either side of Mater exchange a look
( ) That's because it is, Mater
Now, be careful what you say
Why is that
What do you mean don't talk to you
(more talking from Holley which we cannot hear) So you want me to stop talking to you
Right now
You are acting strange today, Ivan
have no idea what you're talking about
'
-  digital readout isolates the Hugo and starts to scroll reams of information alongside
Alexander Hugo, aka "Chop Shop Alex
" we realize this display is invisible to all but Mater
Some of Alex's other alias' include "Alexander Hu- Don't Go" and "Alexander the Not-So Great
" 85
Hey, you got a lot of aka's, Alex
But  guess that makes sense seeings how you's wanted in France, Germany, the Czech Republic
(cutting in to his ) Mater
Stop it
Alexander Hugo, unaware of Holley's interruption, whispers to Mater as they turn a corner
Okay, okay
Keep your voice down
You're gonna make me arrested
(to the other Hugos) Don't mess with Ivan today
He's in a bad mood
- Holley, hearing this, can't believe it
He's so good

It's Zundapp

Everyone looks disappointed
It's just the Professor
Zundapp, when is he coming
He's already here

On them, an image of - the same bloody engine from the photo
But this is a image
The car is being worked on
Welcome, everyone
The  is garbled, scrambled
No way to determine who

my clutch assembly broke
You know how it is
The Lemons all nod in understanding
87
Been there
Forget about it
We know how you feel
Descramble that voice
(already on it) 'm trying
It's too sophisticated
-  - We are here to celebrate
Today all your hard work pays off
The world turned their backs on cars like us
They stopped manufacturing us, stopped making our parts
The only thing they haven't stopped doing is laughing at us
They've called us terrible names

On

And finally back on the monitor
The

Mater is freaked out
They laughed at us
But now it's our turn to laugh back
Another racer blows an engine

) Another crash
It's number nine, Nigel Gearsley

) Embrace your inner lemon

Where
On the tower

) This was meant to be alternative fuel's greatest moment

One drives over an Allinol sign
They're fed up with it

) After today everyone will race back to gasoline
We   to reveal another fan as he  an Allinol banner down angrily

And we, the owners of the world's largest untapped oil reserve, will become the most powerful cars in the world
- Finn ducks, weaves, speeds, and pushes his way through --- Get out of the way
Andate
He speeds furiously through town
-   - McQueen and Francesco
- They will come to us and they will have no choice, `cause they will need us
- He  up a road, Grem and Acer visible ahead of him
He  over the crevasse toward the  cousins --- Suddenly,
He's immobilized in mid-air
He looks up
with a   hovers over him
( ) We figured you might stop by
(
) And they will finally respect us
So hold your hoods high
After today you will never again be ashamed of who you are
Grem and Acer turn back to the camera
They line up Shu Todoroki, who's a bit further along now
No

Grem
Flames burst from Todoroki
He loses control
(
) Number seven is loose
Shu Todoroki
Shu takes down three more cars with him and others follow suit
It's a nightmare pileup
- Holley sees Finn being flown away by the chopper
Finn
-   - (
) Bumper to bumper as they approach the finish line
McQueen  out Francesco for a win, both oblivious to what's just happened
(
) McQueen's the winner, Francesco's second
And they have no idea what happened behind them
Yeah
Dah
This is impossible
That's what 'm talking about
Kachow
Hey, where are all the other cars
What is going on
They see the pile-up from an overhead monitor
Sirens blare as a   flies to the scene of the pile-up
92
() Oh no
: -
He's near the casino
He's completely surrounded, 360 degrees, by press
He's drowned out by a blizzard of questions
Sir Axlerod
Is the final race in London still going to take place
to reveal we are watching this on monitors in the with the Lemonheads, Zundapp and Mater
( ) suppose that
Look, "the show must go on" as they say
But now is not the time to talk about
can't believe this is really happening
Shh, quiet
( ) And Allinol
Will you require all the racers to still run on Allinol
Here it comes
On Miles Axlerod: He's devastated
( ) cannot in good conscience continue to risk the lives of any more race cars
The final race will not be run on Allinol
fill the room
Lemonade corks are popped
( ) There you have it
clearly devastated Sir Miles Axlerod announcing that he will not require the cars to use Allinol for the final race
93
toast
To the death of Allinol and alternative fuel forever
- Holley is already on the run
Speeding away
Mater
Abort the mission
They've got Finn
Get out of there
Get out of there right now
She turns a corner and
Her escape is now blocked by the same   she tricked before
Another vehicle appears  ,
How is your grandfather
-  - The Lemonheads celebrate, chant "Long live lemons
" Mater, scared, turns to leave
He's stopped by
Isn't this a great party, Ivan
Oh yeah, it's unbelievable
You are not leaving, are you
Uh, of course  ain't leavin'
(
) 'm just in shock like everybody
McQueen
He turns, sees that McQueen is being interviewed on the monitors
( ) Crashes are part of racing,  know
But something like that shouldn't ever happen
94
( ) They're letting you choose your fuel for the final race
Do you have any idea what it's going to be
( ) Allinol
The excitement suddenly  from the room
- What
- Did he just say Allinol
After today
( ) My friend Fillmore says the fuel's safe
That's good enough for me didn't stand by a friend of mine recently
'm not gonna make the same mistake twice
On Mater
He takes this in
( ) So a surprising revelation from Lightning McQueen
Zundapp is already on the phone with their Big Boss who, based on his angry
voice, sounds ticked off
Yes, sir
Of course
Zundapp hangs up, turns to the room
Allinol must be finished for good
McQueen cannot win the last race
Lightning McQueen must be killed
Mater's eyes open wide
No
Mater backs up,  his emergency light against one of the monitors
His holographic disguise flickers away then quickly   all of his previous disguises, finally revealing rusty old Mater
It's the American spy

McQueen disappears into the press crowd
No, no, where are you going
Please, Mr
McQueen
McQueen pushes through the press
Scusi
Mater
Scusi
McQueen tracks the tow hook, gets closer
He pushes through the last few vehicles --- Mater, 'm so glad to see you
'm so sorr --- It's
It's , the Hugo Thug's tow truck
Lightning McQueen
am a huge fan
() Oh, 'm sorry
thought  heard--- Yes, but that was me
said, "You killed out there today
" You're the best
What
Oh
mean, thanks
Right this way, signore --- Now the Press Liaison and his assistants are pushing McQueen back in the other direction --- (as he's pulled away) really thought  heard my friend
As he's pulled away, press and onlookers start to come between him and Ivan, who hasn't moved
99
( ) In England you'll be finished
At the finish line
Ivan is now obscured again
Wait, what
The   being to swarm
Please, the world press is waiting
You come with me, please
McQueen is pulled back --- -   - --- just as Mater, now  and with   , is pulled away and thrown into the back of a transport vehicle
He lands hard on his side, spits out his
Let me go
You actually care about that race car
pity you didn't warn him in time
As the doors close on Mater --- thick, noxious gas starts to fill the truck
On  as the knockout gas works its magic

) Idiot
Is that how you see me

) That's how everyone sees you tell you, that's the genius of it

It's the same moment from before except now we are watching it from a ,

Mater makes a spectacle of himself,    in the stands with the face paint on
Domo arigato
McQueen, Fillmore, Guido, Luigi, Sarge and patrons eye Mater, embarrassed and angry
-     - The moment of Mater banging on the Zen rock garden's glass
Except that now we see all sorts of disappointed and eyebrow raising reactions
You done good
You got all the leaves
Check out that tow truck
wonder who that guy's with
() Will you guys excuse me just for one little second
We now  that this ,    is He's  his past, watching it from others' points of view
He doesn't like what he sees

You're making a scene
-  '  , after the Japanese race
Wait a minute
didn't screw you up, did
lost the race because of you
Maybe if  talked to somebody, or--- don't need your help
don't want your help
- Now    , a moment we didn't see before but which presumably happened
Mater is  a ceremonial , to the horror of Japanese guests
Bang a gong, get it on
--- On the ,  ,   - they're all laughing at Mater as McQueen's final words blend in, making a Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs
This is exactly why don't bring you along to these things
Off the  at the party --- - --- to the  of a

All around him, all he sees are and  are here too, strapped bumper to bumper in the divots of large clock movements

Where are we
We're in London, Mater
Inside Big Bentley
- The   finishes  one minute
It's 3
- Suddenly Mater   down toward --- --- whirring, scary machinery
Woaaaah
--- The chain yanks to a
Mater, instead of being 30 feet from death, is now 20
Finn and Holley are only a few clicks closer to being crushed themselves
The clock ticks to 3:01
This
this is all my fault
Don't be a fool, Mater
But  am, remember
You said so
When did
Oh
Mater,  was complimenting you on what a good spy you are
'm not a spy
This echoes throughout the clock
103
've been trying to tell you that the whole time
really am just a tow truck
Finn and Holley take this in
Finn, he's not joking
know
You were right, Finn
'm a fool
And what's happened to McQueen is `cause 'm such a big one
This is all my fault
and  arrive on a lift, roll into view on a catwalk
Good, you're up
And just in time
Professor  wanted you to have a front row seat for the death of Lightning McQueen
() He's still alive
Acer whips a sheet away, revealing the  , turns it toward the clock face
Not for much longer
He pushes the camera through an open small window, turns it toward the course
Mater  down again --- and
- Big Bentley's big hand  ahead another minute
But we're a bit farther away from it than before
(
) We came as soon as you called
104
'  - Sally, flanked by Red, Flo and Ramone, are in front of ---- --- McQueen and the rest of the team
called to talk to Mater
It never occurred to me that he wouldn't be there
Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard right now
And Sarge is in touch with his friends in the British military
You just need to focus on the race
know, but Sal, with everything going on 'm not sure  should--- Someone's entering the pit
Everyone parts, revealing
Sir Axlerod
'm sorry to interrupt
No, no, it's all right
just wanted to come down here and personally thank you
Because after Italy,  was finished
And then you gave me one last shot
Listen,  --- And  probably shouldn't be saying this at all but
hope you win today
Show the world that they've been wrong about Allinol
McQueen takes this in
He looks at Sally
105
Mater would want you to race
All right
For Mater
- --- ,  and the other racers   --- We   to reveal the  watching from a  box
-  - McQueen leads Francesco as they approach Big Bentley
-  - Here he comes
Grem turns up the juice to the , -
Holley and Finn watch, helpless
Mater closes his eyes
Grem
- McQueen   Big Bentley, unharmed
Oblivious to what was supposed to have just happened
- Zundapp suddenly  over the radio
( ) What happened
don't know, Professor
What did you do
( ) didn't do nothin'
Shh
'm talking to the Professor--- They're all talking at once and for a moment we cannot understand what is being said
106
You broke it
Quiet
( ) understand, sir
Yes
Grem hangs up
What'd he say
We go to the backup plan
Backup plan
We snuck a bomb in McQueen's pit
The next time he makes a stop, instead of saying "ka-chow," he's gonna go "ka-boom"
They
Mater shudders, upset
Don't feel bad, tow truck
You couldn't have saved him
Oh, wait
You could have
Grem and Acer laugh
As they board the elevator: Dadgum lemons
' Request acknowledged
Suddenly, Mater's   rotate out again - a surprise to Mater
But they   , empty
Grem and Acer just laugh more
What, you didn't think we'd take your bullets
Mater
107
:  small piece of his ropes have been shaved away by the Gatling
He carefully rotates his guns  , pretending like he's seen nothing
That's right
You got nothin'
(as the elevator descends) Who's the lemon now, huh
They're
Nice try, Mater
Dadgum
' - The guns   ,
Mater watches as the spinning barrels   the ropes, do some damage
Dadgum
Dadgum
Dadgum
The  responds with each "dadgum

Mater
Mater   his tow cable around, hooks a pipe and tosses himself to the ramp with a heavy
He doesn't : gotta get you all out of there
There's no time
McQueen needs your help, Mater
108
But  can't, 'm just a tow truck
It's up to you
Go to the pits and get everyone out
You can do that
What about you guys
We'll be okay
Go and get some more dents, Mater
- Mater  out the front door, a bat out of hell --- -  - On Finn and Holley, now closer to death
So we'll be "okay"
Really
He wouldn't have left if 'd told him the truth
(re: his death trap) Being killed by a clock
Gives a whole new meaning to "your time has come
" At this mention Holley seems to perk up, gets an idea
Time
That's it
She spies a  below them, at least 20 feet down
Holley --- --- but they miss their target
She recoils them back
What are you doing
Trying to turn back time
If  can just reverse the polarity

Finn and Holley's wheel now rotates  from danger
Good job
Quick thinking, Holley

Fast

What's everybody on the wrong side of the road for
- Finn and Holley are now moving in the opposite direction, toward
And it's going
They're seconds from a crushing death
Oh no
Drive
They both , fast as they can with   --- Burn rubber
They drive , separating bumpers with just enough room for the descending gear to
Their tires spinning, they both  off in opposite directions,   on opposing platforms
As Finn squeals around to Holley's side of the clock: We've got to get to the course
Calculate the fastest way to --- Holley pops  out of her side
Done

() Miss Shiftwell
They're standard issue now
You kids get all the good hardware
They turn to leave when they , see
It's an on the ground
Oh no
That's Mater's
knew his escape was too easy
- Finn  out the front doors of Big Bentley, speeds off as through the clock face, careens into view flying over the traffic --- -   - Mater bursts through the security gate with aplomb, tears through the pits and stops at '
Mater
Everybody get out
Get out now
'all gotta get out the pits
The     is here
Hey, what are you guys doing here
We're here because of you, Mater
Is everything okay
No
Everything's not okay
There's a bomb in here
'all gotta get out
Now
111
-  bomb
- Huh
- Woah
( ) Mater
( ) Finn
You're okay
- Mater, listen to me
The bomb is on you
: We can see that a  has been detected, anchored to Mater's air filter
They knew you'd try to help McQueen
When we were knocked out they planted it in your air filter
'  - Mater , blowing his air filter cover off
Cross-eyed, Mater sees the explosive device attached to him
He looks up: An   hangs ominously over his head
Uh-oh
Mater
There you are
Mater turns
McQueen enters Pit Row, 100 yards away and closing in
Stop right there
Oh man, 've been so worried about you
: The view of this scene through the window of a luxury box
Reveal Zundapp in the window's reflection
He's watching from inside
He's poised to push a
As Zundapp's front tire approaches the detonator --- 112
'  - Don't come any closer
Are you okay
No, 'm not okay
Stay away from me
Mater   , out onto the track
No, wait
Wait
: - He hesitates, can't believe it
(
) Hold everything
tow truck has just raced onto the track
And he's driving backwards
' Mater, wait
He breezes right through his pit, goes after Mater
(
) Normally an emergency vehicle on the track means there's been an accident
(
) Wait, wait
Lightning McQueen is chasing him
- Mater drives up the track
McQueen gains, fast
Because Mater's going backwards, they're face-to-face (but still with some distance between them)
Mater, wait
113
Stay back
If you get close to me, you gonna get hurt real bad
know  made you feel that way before, but none of that matters because we're best friends
: (
) And McQueen seems to be having a conversation with the tow truck
(
) don't know who that truck is, Brent
But 'll tell you what, he's gotta be the world's best backwards driver
is watching this footage from his luxury box
The closer McQueen gets to Mater the farther his tire onto the detonator
But he holds back ever so slightly so as not to jump the gun
- McQueen gains on Mater
McQueen, you don't get it
'm the bomb
Yes, Mater
You are the bomb
That's what 'm trying to say here
You've always been the bomb
And you'll always be the bomb
Stay away
No
Never
He watches as McQueen
Almost there
He's had enough screwing around
Here he comes
'm not
letting you

He's going to catch him now

What is happening
It's a bad dream
- Mater takes a turn, and skids around a corner out of sight white, smoky   is all that remains
'  - All of Radiator Springs watches the television monitors, dumbfounded
(
) And Lightning McQueen just blasted away, hooked to the now rocket- propelled tow truck
: - Overhead
: Mater and McQueen swerve through the streets
115
- Zundapp is still furiously hitting the button as Holley drops into view just beyond the glass
Freaked, Zundapp does a 180 and  out a plate glass window, lands on a ridiculously large balloon tethered to the ground, and speeds off --- - The  watch, baffled, as Zundapp drives away
The Professor's on the run
Someone's gotta get McQueen
Get McQueen
Grem and Acer are already out the door --- - Finn speeds into view, in time to see Zundapp turn a corner out of sight
Holley
'll get Zundapp, you help Mater
- Holley, still in the air, turns --- Got it
- Holley  past Francesco and out of sight
What is happening
- Finn screams around a corner, sees --- --- Professor Zundapp, speeding toward docks along the Thames where a   waits
116
Hurry, Professor
- With Finn gaining fast, he accelerates
Suddenly ---
He's been  by Finn with tensile cables now attached to his rear end
Zundapp  like a little girl
Do you really think 'm going to let you float away, Professor
Finn reels him in
Zundapp spins his wheels, caught
Suddenly Zundapp miraculously, inconceivably,
Now it's '  that are spinning
- the  has been turned outward and switched on
He's with the magnetic force
He pulls out a laser,  it at Finn's windshield
: - Mater, still towing McQueen, rockets around a corner, zips down another street --- McQueen, let go
Never
They pass a Gremlin with a headset
- Down another side street
They get this message, take off in the opposite direction
: - , tires squealing, loses more and more ground to the boat
Zundapp, the "rope" in this tug-of-war, buckles under the tension
Give it up, McMissile
Finn releases a mess of bullets, grenades, and other weaponry into the air --- 117
it in quickly like a black hole --- It all sticks to the magnet, right next to Finn's bullets
They're , ,  and one little detonator with a flashing, beeping light
Off the boat's  --- : , -
distant explosion (miles away) festoons into the air, visible over the rooftops
Holley suddenly into view
She sees --- Mater and McQueen, speeding up the street
Mater, stop
No way
You could get hurt
Then she looks over, catches a glimpse of   , bearing down on them from a side street
They're going to broadside Mater and McQueen
Oh no
- They're not aware of the impending impact
Holley    , hits the pavement,  into the path of the AMCs and
They   Holley, Finn and McQueen and sail --- ---    --- --- where they skid across the room and  into the bar, knocking a     to the ground
- Grem and Acer are pulverized by the bar patrons
- Holley, McQueen and Mater are now stopped
Mater, we've got to get that bomb off you
118
She's already  the bomb, working away
Bomb
Yeah, they strapped it to me to kill you as a back-up plan
Back-up plan
Mater, who put a bomb on you
(
) Ahhhhh
Professor Zundapp suddenly  to a stop next to (a now totally freaked) McQueen, entangled in grappling hooks care --- --- Finn, who has him leashed
( ) You
Why didn't my death ray kill you
Death ray

Holley immediately shoves a  in Zundapp's grill

Say it

Goes from 4:48 to 3:48 to 3:47

Would anyone else like to try
Holley shocks him unconscious
( ) You read my mind
He was getting on my nerves
What do we do
(
) It's very simple
blocks the entrance to a side street
He's surrounded by Hugo relatives
You blow up
The four streets surrounding them are now blocked by each of the Lemonheads and their families
( ) 'm gonna go out on a limb here
These are the guys that want me dead, correct
It's nothing personal
(to the Lemons) Fellers, listen
() 120
(') know what you're going through
Everybody's been laughing at me my whole life too --- McQueen turns to Mater - he wasn't expecting that
The Lemons all eye each other, considering Mater's words
--- but becoming powerful and rich beyond your wildest dreams ain't gonna make you feel better
Yeah, but it's worth a shot

are strewn all around him as Guido tries wrench after wrench to take the bolts off
No dice
Guido gestures wildly, spits Italian a mile a minute
What's he saying
What's wrong
None of his wrenches fit the bolts
This is a light bulb moment for Mater
He eyes the bolts
get it
get it
know what needs to be done
Then do it
What
No,  can't do it
Look, nobody takes me seriously
know that now
This ain't Radiator Springs
Yes it is
Mater looks at McQueen
It is
You're yourself in Radiator Springs
Be yourself here
And if people aren't taking you seriously, then they need to change
Not you
know that, because  was wrong before
Now you can do this
You're the bomb
122
Thanks, buddy
No no no, you're the actual bomb
Now let's go
Oh, right
Hang on
Mater  McQueen and they're off
They   , who's in the middle of battling lemons
Where's he going
- Flying down a side street
Computer
' Yes, Agent Mater
need that thing you done before to get me away from McQueen
' Request acknowledged
The   kick in
They head right for a
Mater
Now  need you to do the chute, the second kind not the first
' Deploying chute
Mater's chute  , catching air and sending Mater and McQueen
Mater starts to steer them the direction he wants
He and McQueen are
-   - The , her attendants, assorted dignitaries are here
123
Who's winning the race
Mater and McQueen drop from the sky
They land and skid to a halt just before the Queen's guards who
' Back up
Back away
(-) It's Lightning McQueen
' Get back
No, no, it's okay
Tell them, Mater
Explain
Okay
Somebody's been sabotaging the racers and hurting the cars and know who
Oh wait
Your Majesty
Mater  to the Queen
In doing so, the angles into view
The clock's at -minus 1:53
' - Bomb
- It's a bomb
- Everybody down
- Look out
(
) Hold your fire
He can't disarm it
Finn dives onto the platform and rolls between the Queen and Mater
Mater,  don't know what you're doing but stand down now
(aside, to McQueen) This ain't nothing at all like Radiator Springs
Mater, just cut to the chase
Okay
124
He turns to Miles Axlerod
It's him
What
Me
You've got to be crazy
Everyone exchanges confused looks, including Finn and Holley
figured it out when  realized you all attached this ticking time bomb with Whitworth bolts
The same bolts that hold together that old British engine from the photograph
Holley
Show that picture
-kay
Holley projects the much discussed
And then  remembered what they say about old British engines - "If there ain't no oil under `em, there ain't no oil in `em
" What is he talking about
It was you leaking oil at the party in Japan
You just blamed it on me
Electric cars don't use oil, you twit
Then you're faking it
You didn't convert to no electric
We pop that hood we gonna see that engine from that picture right there
Mater moves toward Miles Axlerod to pop his hood
This lorry's crazy
He's going to kill us all
Miles Axlerod   to the edge of the stage
125
Stay away
But Sir Axlerod created the race, Mater
Why would he want to hurt anyone
To make Allinol look bad so everybody'd go back to using oil mean, he said it himself with that disguised voice
"Dee-sguised voice
" What are you talking about
You're nuts, you are
The '  have had
As has the
This is going nowhere fast
We really should go, Grandmother
One moment
'd like to see where this is going
Mater, he created Allinol
Yeah, but what if he found that huge oil field just as the world was trying to find something else
Mater sticks his ticking bomb-nose into Miles Axlerod's grill
What if he came up with Allinol just to make alternative fuel look bad
"What if
" You're basing this on a "What if"
Okay, that's it
And the '  spirit the Queen and Prince Wheeliam out of there  --- 126
Wait
Somebody save me
The lorry's crazy
Now it's just Miles Axlerod, Mater, McQueen, Finn and Holley
Miles Axlerod's back tires slip on the edge of the podium as he is cornered by Mater
Keep away, you idiot
00:00:08
Mater
Mater
00:03
00:02
Someone do something
Everyone ,  or    except McQueen, Mater and Axlerod --- You're insane, you are
Deactivate
The bomb  at 00:01
' Bomb deactivated
Have a nice day, Sir Axlerod
General shock all around
Miles Axlerod realizes what he's done, looks terrified
Police surround him
Mater  Miles Axlerod's hood open with his hook, revealing    , oil dripping from all sides
It  the photo
The engine from the photo
It's a perfect match
How did the tow truck figure it out
127
( ) It's official
You're coming to all my races from now on
Now you're talking
Tire bump
- massive crowd packs the adjacent streets and parks
- Mater does the requisite "silly faces" in an attempt to break the composure of a Buckingham Palace Guard
It isn't working
McQueen approaches
Mater, let's go
You're on
'  -   - The Queen sits in attention at the front of the Main Ballroom
As Mater and McQueen approach: Your Majesty
May  present for the investiture of honorary Knighthood of the British Realm
Tow Mater of Radiator Springs
Go get `em, buddy
McQueen joins his friends from Radiator Springs
Mater rolls forward
He bows, as if he's practiced it all day
hereby dub thee "Sir Tow Mater
" Applause from all around
( ) "Sir
" Shoot, you can just call me Mater, Your Majesty
don't wanna hear none of this "Sir" business
By the way, have y'all met each other

He continues introducing everyone as we   --- - The town sign now reads "    - " ' - Cars surround Mater and McQueen
The rest of the Radiator Springs gang is here too, watches
and  are front and center
So there  was: rocket jets going full blast, McQueen hanging on for dear life when suddenly them two nasty lemons come out of nowhere, guns drawed
We was goners
But then out of nowhere, this beautiful spy car swoops in from the sky to save us
That's a very entertaining story, young man
Oh, Minny, please
Come on, none of this happened
Rocket jets
Flying spy cars
No, you're quite right
It does sound a bit far-fetched
The crowd turns, sees , wings out, swooping in
is right below her, driving up the street
Holley
Finn
Hello, Mater
It's so nice to see you again
What're you doing here
129
Our satellites picked up an urgent communique
So you got my e-mail
Oh, man
'all is gonna have a great time
Everybody
This here's Finn McMissile
He's a secret agent
() Don't tell nobody
And this is Holley Shiftwell
She's --- 'm Mater's girlfriend
It's so nice to meet you all
Everyone is shocked
Including Mater
Guido's jaw drops
( ) Guido believe you now
( ) Whoa, honey
You got a nasty dent there
Indeed, Holley still wears the dent from when she saved Mater from Grem and Acer
(already crushing on her) Was that from when you swooped in and saved them in London
Van
What
'm just asking
( ) Don't you worry, sweet pea
My baby Ramone can get that fixed up for you in no time
Yeah, sure thing
No problemo
Just let me go get my tools
130
Oh no no
'm keeping that dent
It's way too valuable
Mater takes this in
"valuable" dent
Oh, she's as crazy as Mater
Those two are perfect for each other
You know, there's one thing  still don't get
The bad guys hit me with the beam from the camera, right
So why didn't , you know
Explode in a fiery inferno
Yeah
We couldn't figure that one out either
Our investigation proved that Allinol was actually gasoline
And Miles Axlerod engineered it so that when it got hit by the beam it would explode
Wait a second
Fillmore, you said my fuel was safe
McQueen turns to Fillmore
Everyone does
If you're implying that  switched out that rotgut excuse for alternative fuel with my all- natural, sustainable, organic biofuel just because  never trusted Axlerod, you're dead wrong, man
(: ) It was him

Just racing - the way  like it
Francesco likes it like this too
McQueen  Sally
He and Francesco approach her
Francesco
'd like you to meet --- Signorina Sally
It is official: Lightning McQueen is the luckiest car in the world
() Why, thank you --- Which he will have to be to have a chance against Francesco today
Francesco turns to leave
As he's moving away: 132
See you at the finish line, Mc--- Francesco
What is that
McQueen has a new bumper sticker: "Ka-ciao, Francesco
" It's just something  had made up for the occasion
Is good, McQueen
Very funny
It was funnier when  did it, but it's very funny
What are you going to do next
Are you going to take off your fenders
Try it
You'll like it
Francesco leaves
We stay with McQueen and Sally
So he's not so good-looking
Yeah
Nice try

That's why  love you, Sally

Holley gets an alert
Finn, time to go
Siddeley's gassed, geared and ready to fly
Finn starts to back up
You're leaving already
We've got another mission, Mater
Just stopped by here to "pick something up
" They both eye Mater, expectantly
Something tells me you're not talking about souvenir bumper stickers
Her Majesty asked for you personally, Mater
But  told you all before
'm not a spy
We know
134
Spy or not, you're still the smartest, most honest chap we've ever met
Don't forget massively charming
Mater looks over at Holley
He looks touched
Well, thanks
But as much fun as it was hanging with y'all, this
He looks over to his friends who watch the race, This is home
That's alright, we understand
But 'll be back
You still owe me that first date
If there's ever anything  can do for you, just let me know
Well,  sure appreciate that, thank you
