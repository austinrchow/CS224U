: " " -  - Far down the slope, perhaps forty feet from the foot of the massive mountain, 's head pokes out of the confusion of junk and he looks down at the  below
Seen more closely, the  are more distinct, but no less mysterious
Heavy outer garments like huge parkas and hoods blur their individual shapes as they inch across the landscape, apparently clutching one of several crisscrossing wires that stretch tautly for miles across the bleak terrain like "roads" through the wind
watches as one of the  moves off the "road
"  He's trailing rope that attaches him to the others as he struggles through the wind, walking almost on all fours like an ape
watches the  moving among bits of junk until he locates something he wants, picks it up, and starts to struggle back toward the others, dragging his burden after him
is watching what would seem to be some sort of scavenging process by these strange unearthly  as we
: -  - The four suns are changing color, dimming in the sky, as we
: " " - Tiny in the distance, the four  are moving together along a cable, headed away from the junk mountain
At ground level now,  is watching them, crouched behind a massive transformer that teeters slightly in the wind in spite of its great bulk
Peeking around the sheltering transformer, he spots one of the taut cables lashed to an enormous piece of junk near the foot of "his" mountain
The cable is twenty yards away in a "canyon" of junk and he'll have to move across open space partially exposed to the wind in order to get to it
He starts out from behind the transformer
Screaming wind lifts him and hurls him thirty feet, his arms flailing
He comes down even further from the cable, struggling to keep on his feet
Gritting his teeth, he fights the wind, struggles toward the cable
Suddenly a chunk of steel whips at him and he ducks just in time as it whistles close to his head
drops to the ground and starts to crawl "under the wind," toward the taut cable, and we
: " " -  - Seen by , the four tiny  are far ahead, disappearing in the distance and the dusk
Following them on a taut wire,  is passing through a barren landscape punctuated by strange ruins, great shapes of steel thrusting out of the ground and looming over and around him, vaguely recognizable as the wreckage of a space vehicle that must have crashed long ago
The mountains of junk squat a mile behind him
He's come a long way, it's almost dark, he's weak
He hangs onto the wire, walking with effort
He can no longer see the creatures ahead of him on the wire
He notices something thirty yards off the wire to the right
Steel crosses
Maybe a hundred of them
cemetery
Just then, the wind catches , yanks him, but he hangs onto the wire, holding on desperately, as the wind pulls at him and makes him flap like a pennant in the breeze
Then the wind dies enough for him to get both hands on the wire and get weakly to his feet
For a moment he looks like he might collapse, but he doesn't, and we
: - At night the four suns glow darkly like night lights
is alone on the planet, punished by the savage wind, struggling along the wire, shivering
Every stop is an effort, but the eyes stare into the dark and they reveal no emotion, not even when he suddenly tenses, seeing something ahead
In the distance a faint light glows
considers it as we
: / -  - The window is detached plexi from some kind of vehicle, embedded in a low mound of "earth" like a skylight
Whatever is making the light comes from below in a sort of hut that slopes only inches above the ground
is hanging onto the cable only ten yards from the strange window
He can see more of them glowing all around him, as well as silhouetted pipes issuing smoke to the wind
drops to his belly to keep under the wind
He crawls ten yards to the window and pears through it
'  of a fantastic confusion of color and movement seen through the thick scratched plexiglass window
The wild blurs of activity make no sense to him whatsoever, nor do the very of sound barely audible over the deafening  of the wind
(What he's seeing in the room below is a violent pillow fight between eight  and  ranging from four to ten years old
Wearing cotton shifts dyed red, blue, or yellow they're smacking each other violently with rag pillows and laughing happily in a dormitory-style full of stacked bunks
) , prone on the "roof," mystified
He's never seen anything like it
His grease-covered face barely reveals his puzzlement when he is suddenly distracted by a change in the wind
The   that has dominated the environment since he first arrived has diminished to a strong breeze
tries sitting up
The breeze doesn't overpower him
He looks around
The meaningless  of the pillow fight, though still muffled by heavy plexiglass, are  now, but 's attention is on the other window/skylight that glows from this strange "roof" and on the strange sound that's coming to him, borne on the breeze
a  sound
Struggling weakly to his feet,  staggers toward the next window
The  is  as he approaches -- it's waltz music played on an accordion
drops to his knees and peers through the next window
'  through the second "window," another mysterious vision
The color and movement are more subdued, but  is just as puzzled
What he's seeing indistinctly through the thick plexiglass is an of a man and a woman gliding across the floor, moving as one, first this way, then that, in time to a
In the corner, another person is making a strange movement that seems to initiate the music
, flat on the roof
Now that the weak breeze has given way to a deathly stillness, the mysterious (to him) is clearly audible as  peers through the plexiglass at the warm scene below, as puzzled by the waltzing couple as by the pillow fights
Then he gets to his feet again and in the stillness makes his way past a smoking chimney toward the next window
Halfway there he freezes
listening
strange haunting  sound is coming from somewhere
looks around at the blackness beyond the roof windows
There's nothing visible
The mysterious sound is louder now, drowning out the music ominously, drowning out everything, everything, everything
Suddenly  understands, but he's too late
It's the , back with renewed fury, more powerful than ever
is hurtled into the air, tossed head over heels by the wind, struggling, clutching at empty air in vain, buffeted, slammed to the ground, lifted again before he can flatten himself, tossed violently, somersaulted helplessly
is slammed face first to the ground
For a long moment he's motionless, untouched by the   for reasons that aren't clear
Finally he rolls over weakly and looks up
In the weak light he can just make out the steep earthen walls of a narrow trench looming eight feet straight up, protecting him from the wind howling overhead
tries to get up
but the fall has injured his leg and he slumps to the floor of the three-foot-wide trench, too weak and injured even to crawl
Lying there, barely conscious, gasping for breath, he suddenly sees something
Shoes
Less than a foot from his bloody face
He manages to lift his head a little and look up
Silhouetted by the light spilling from an open door in the trench wall are four children
, ten, , six, , five, and , eight
Barely conscious,  can just make out the astonishment on their blurred shadowy faces as they look down at him in amazement
Then they go    altogether as  slumps unconscious and everything goes   , and we
: - ,
About fifty people are jammed into the low- ceilinged meeting room, all of them talking at once
They are , men and women of all ages and many races, a hardy, weathered-looking group dressed in plain clothes of muted color
Their faces seem to have been etched by the wind with deep lines, the skin burnished, and even the younger ones have crow's feet around the eyes from squinting
As they chatter excitedly, asking each other what happened, who found him, where, and so on, a sharp-faced fifty-ish woman, , is standing behind a table in the front of the room, calling for order
Please
Quiet, please
Just as the hubbub finally dies down, a grizzled pioneer named bellows loudly at her
Just tell me one thing
How many of them are there and are they armed
stares  down, refusing to speak until she has real silence
When she finally speaks, her voice is calm and controlled
There in a man
one man
He was found in the trench by several children
sudden murmur dies away quickly under ' hard stare
This man was not armed
murmur goes through the crowded room, then a woman named speaks over the hum of voices
How could there only be one
How could he get here
glances toward , a muscular, bearded man, about thirty
He was unconscious
We couldn't ask him anything
He -- commotion in the back room causes  to break off as , a clean-shaven burly-looking pioneer in his thirties, pushes his way in, followed by four more
All five of then are wearing their huge hooded parkas, strange Eskimo-type wind goggles, and carrying weapons
Nothin' out there
We couldn't see nobody, couldn't see no ship, no vehicles, nothin'
plus the wind's up again real strong
An excited hubbub
is trying to restore order when shouts over the commotion
They're hiding,  bet
ignores him as she speaks with firm authority
Let's everybody calm down right now
(beat; silence; then) We have an injured man among us
One man
traveler
Unarmed
(another pause; then) We all want to do the decent thing
The decent thing is to help him
Mace's wife, Sandra, is looking after him now
Now, 'd like a vote of support on this course of action from all of you
The way she says it, you know she's used to getting her way, and, in fact,  are exchanging glances and nodding when shouts again
You keep an eye on him, Mace
You watch him
: - is on his back in a bed in a tiny earth-walled bedroom
He stares stupidly at the woman bending over him
She is , a woman of twenty-five who is attractive, but not in a glamorous way
It's a very natural beauty worn with intelligence and dignity
She's wiping away blood and grease from 's face
's eyes flick around the room even as he lies motionless
He sees a window high on one wall
He sees old-fashioned magazine pictures and bits of patterned material hung here and there for decoration
Clothing hangs from pegs on the walls
He doesn't see the look in 's eyes as she discovers the savage scar on his forehead or the sergeant's tattoo on his cheek
Eyeing these telltale marks,  pours liquid into a spoon and holds it to his lips
Want to try some more of this
swallows weakly
smiles, stands up, moves toward the door
You rest now
'll give you more later
watches her exit
He hears her  in the next room
a low murmur
He's looking around again when a  makes him look back toward the door
two-year-old is crawling into the room on hands and knees
The baby boy, , stops just inside, seeing  in the bed
looks into 's eyes with childlike interest and wonder
meets the look with those blank soldier's eyes
" " second tiny room next to the bedroom is the rest of the Mace/Sandra/Nathan living quarters
and  are deep in conversation
What do you mean he's survived worse
Did he say something
No, but he's covered with old wounds, all sorts of scars
Knife scars, bullet scars, burns
(worried) soldier
There are words on his shoulder
Tannhauser Gate, the Argentine Sector, Montana, Bolivia, Shanghai 2012
The Tannhauser Gate was a battle
and  look into each other's eyes, very worried
Then
We'll have to sleep on the floor
(suddenly alarmed) Where's Nathan
is looking around
He spots the open door to the bedroom, hurries to it, and disappears
starts after him, looking worried
but before she gets to the door,  reappears with  safely in his arms
If there's any danger to Nathan -- (interrupting grimly) won't permit danger to Nathan
and  lock eyes in firm understanding as we
: - "" We're in some kind of war ship in outer space during a battle
The interior is a lot like the interior of a submarine, cramped even in the best conditions and right now the conditions are awful as  in bulky space suits stumble through thick smoke while a   urgently and wounded  scream in agony
Another
Part of the bulkhead is shot away and the suction is like wind, ripping  out of the hole into space
We   a soldier in a space suit who's wedged himself behind a cannon
As we look closely at his visor, we recognize who's firing back at the enemy while all around him  are screaming and dying as we
: - blinks awake
He looks around
It's the same bedroom, but morning light is streaming in the high window
He can hear
coming from beyond the door
is wobbling forward with wide eyes as  holds one of his hands and  holds the other
They're teaching the child to walk, encouraging each step
But when they let go, totters forward only one step before landing flat on his ass
and  laugh, making the whole thing a game, and , after a moment of confusion, joins in the laughter
It's a warm moment until , sensing a presence, turns toward the bedroom, suddenly serious
follows her look
is standing in the doorway, supporting himself on the door frame
his soldier's eyes full of unspoken menace
one leg heavily bandaged
(nervous) You must be
you must be feeling better
says nothing
His eyes flick to
is watching  sharply
We're teaching the boy to walk
(nervously filling silence) He's late learning
He was sick for a long time
says nothing
His eyes follow  who's gone to the corner where he's seizing a heavy metal rod that might be a weapon
tenses
Ready
Dangerous
As  turns toward him,  doesn't notice the danger in ' eyes
got something for you
He innocently approaches with the metal rod
Super alert,  watches  hold the rod out to him
Here
looks mistrustful
Like this
demonstrates, using the rod like a cane
See
Expressionless, watches  use the cane
Practice with it
In a day or two maybe you'll be strong enough to go out to the garden with Sandra
never even realizes how much danger he was in
: -  - 's heavy boots come close to , the cane clumps down, just missing him
looks up with open-mouthed innocence and childlike wonder at  who looms past him, walking very cautiously with the help of a cane
looks down at
Their eyes meet for a moment is wearing one of the heavy parkas the pioneers wear
answers a  at the door, opens it, revealing , the ten-year-old, in the doorway
Behind her are  and , as well as several other  of various ages
came for Nathan
But 's eyes are on  and so are the others crowding behind her to peep over her shoulder
They all want to get a look at , but when he looks in their direction, they retreat shyly
is wearing a parka too
She picks up  from where he's sitting near 's feet and carries him to the door, giving him a kiss, then handing him to
starts to cry and holds his arms out to his mother as hugs him and comforts him
watches the drama as  and  comfort the child and soothe his fears at being separated from his mother
Nothing shows in 's eyes
but affection seems to fascinate him
As  and her cohorts hurry off with , they sneak over- the-shoulder glances at the strange monster,
Just then , dressed in a heavy parka also, comes out of the bedroom and heads for the door
Let's go
Come on, Sergeant
is heading out the door as we
: -  - Single-file, a dozen  move along a trench as the wind overhead
We  the cane and boots of  among them
The  in front of  glances back at him occasionally, curious, while and  walk behind him
As they pass huts, there are windows high in one sloping wall of the trench
doesn't notice the distorted faces of the peering out at him, their noses pressed against the plexiglass, full of curiosity as we
: - Three trenches meet
Some of the  move off to the left, some to the right
is going left, but  guides toward the right with her
This way
gives her a wave
He waves at  too
looks confused at the wave, then he salutes
is startled by that
He sort of grins as we
: -  - nasty little snake, a ten-inch , slithers through the dirt among the neat rows of seedlings growing there until
One neat blow from the sharp edge of a trowel decapitates the
flips the still wriggling thing aside and wipes her trowel clean in the dirt as  watches with those blank snake eyes of his
They're on all fours in a garden
The garden is simply a much wider trench covered by a trellis so the light can be regulated
There are already neat rows of vegetables are growing
Behind them, kneeling  are planting new seedlings and weeding around more mature plants
turns back to place a seedling in the dirt with only an offhand glance at the dead
You have to watch out for them
They probably wouldn't kill someone your size, not if you were healthy anyway
But they'd make you pretty sick
Someone smaller
like me, or a child
Her meaning clear,  continues to demonstrate to  how to plant the seedling in the earth
In a month this one will be as big as those
follows her look to the other side of the trench where the plants are already eighteen inches high
Other , working on their hands and knees also, are sneaking glances as , among them, a middle-aged woman named and an older woman,
frowns one of their looks away protectively as she selects another seedling from a tray and hands it to
Here
You try one
looks at it
He doesn't exactly look scared, but he handles it gingerly, seemingly intimidated by the delicate seedling
He starts to plant it carefully as we
: - Jabbering , the click of utensils
Heaping plates of food are being passed the length of long tables set up in communal style
is kicking  under the table,  flips a piece of food at  when his mother, , isn't looking, and the outspoken  is lecturing a pioneer named
You can't talk to a soldier no more than you can talk to a
a
bomb
Or a bullet
They're trained, they're killing machines
They got an objective and they go after that objective and nothing stops them but killing them
(a glance over his shoulder) Just one
To kill us all
The conversation gets the attention of  and  who stop food-fighting to listen to the adults talk
First off, if there's one, there's more
That's how it is, soldiers travel in bunches
Second, they don't waste soldiers on folks like us, that's for police
Training soldiers to kill weaklings like us is not what they call "cost effective
" Then who do they fight
Other soldiers
There's a saying, "Soldiers deserve soldiers
" noticing  and  listening
Slade, hush up
and  glancing toward the next table
where , wedged between  and , is eating like a machine, looking neither right nor left as people jabber all around him
whispering to  at a nearby table as she watches  eat
You see how much he's eating
who turns now and boldly addresses  across the gap between the tables
don't see how you can not remember how you got here, Sergeant
There's a sudden hush in the noisy room, broken only by a few urgent whispers and a cough
looks up from his food and meets ' look
scowls at  as  persists
You're not a deserter, are you
Sergeant
The silence is even more charged than before
looks alarmed
Someone coughs
The tension is unbearable
No, sir
sigh of relief from everybody
But  presses on
Then how come you're not with your unit
Oh, come on, Slade, let the man eat
It's not an unreasonable question
(to Todd) How about it, Sergeant
, actually struggling with the question
remembering
Suddenly he blurts
was
replaced
Replaced
hesitates for half a second before answering
By a better soldier, sir
There are looks exchanged among the  as we
: - little seedling is fitted into the earth gently
's strong hands pat the earth around it
reaches for another seedling
He's one of a group of ten , all on their hands and knees, all working intently, silently
They seem to have accepted him
Nobody stares
is carefully patting the next seedling in the ground when something causes him to look up
Five   in torn and dirty uniforms are looming over him, weapons pointed at him
All around them is a desert of sand stretching forever under a baking sun
One of the soldiers kicks
, , and several other   exchanging nervous glances as they look back to where 's kneeling
There are no soldiers
but somehow, he's trampled several rows of seedlings
looks toward them, confused, disoriented by his "memory
" The women look away quickly, frightened, and we
: - is changing 's diaper as she chatters, her back to And it got worse and worse
My father hadn't had any work in three months and
also
there were other things
violence
political feelings
My father said he'd heard it was better in the Trinity moons
lot of other people must have had the same idea because the ship was jammed with people
mostly families
That's probably why it broke down
overloaded
Across the room, , wearing a -shirt and baggy pants is sitting on a stool, his face impassive as ever
As  talks, her back to him, 's eyes are on the contours of her body against the shift she's wearing
It's very
erotic
Even after they made the repairs, it barely got off the ground, it was an old converted mining transport, a piece of junk to start with
It just
dropped
Maybe you saw what's left of it
out there in the wind
lot of people died
And we couldn't make any radio contact
So we were stuck here
Nobody was happy about it
few years later, when the dumpers started coming over and dropping stuff, people tried to get their attention with explosions and fires
But it didn't work
They must be unmanned
or they just don't care
Maybe they think we're garbage too
' face is as impassive as ever while his eyes caress the shape of her body
and she, unaware, continues to reminisce
So there really wasn't any choice
People had to pull together and make the best of it
We became a
community
As  maneuvers ,  catches glimpses of her breasts pushing against the material of the shift
She continues, still not noticing where his attention is
One good thing
nobody bothers us
Who'd want to fight over a godforsaken place like this
wry laugh
She turns to put  down on the floor and catches 's eyes just as he shifts them quickly from her breasts
For a moment it's awkward
she looks at him
then she recovers
guess that's what you like
The fighting,  mean
The wars
(unsure, a question really) You must
you're a soldier
doesn't answer as we
: (  ) - The  are peeking around a doorway, watching something in the meeting room
, coming along the dirt-walled corridor, spots the ahead
You children are supposed to be doing lessons
The  barely acknowledge her as she comes even with them
She looks at what they're looking at
What they're seeing through the doorway is , shirtless, doing an eerie sequence of tai chi exercises
His muscular body ripples, revealing an incredible map of scar tissue that speaks eloquently of the life he's led
gash marks, long zippers of stitches, the puckered patches of burns
watches for a long moment, her eyes worried
In the midst of a slow graceful movement,  suddenly whirls and delivers a lightning blow to an unseen enemy with amazing speed and fury, the terrible force contained in the movement all too obvious
Even as  and the  gasp silently,  returns to the graceful, almost balletic movement, even spookier now, that preceded the deadly thrust
The 's eyes are like saucers, their jaws agape
shudders
and breaks the hypnotic spell, speaking aloud to the children
Lessons
: - It's dark, the wind's  just above the trench walls as peers into a faintly lighted window in the wall of the trench
'      reveals a tender moment between  and  as they enter the bedroom and kiss flickering candle on a low table, the only light, exaggerates their shadows
, his face revealing no feelings as he turns away
Light spills from other windows, some more brightly lit, as begins to jog along the trench, gradually picking up speed, until he's running hard through intermittent pools of light in the maze of dark trenches
: - Stillness
No wind
Everything is quiet
Bits of junk are strewn across the landscape under the four suns
'  (
) She's down now, but she'll come up again
Always does
As  continues talking to , he loads the pockets of his heavy parka with miscellaneous hunks of metal
(continuing) That's why we're weighing down
And that's why we're always on the wire even when the wind's down, like now
You don't get much warning
Here, load up, you'll want the weight, promise
hands heavy hunks of metal to  who's wearing a parka like '
He pockets the metal obediently
Behind them a small crowd of  are doing the same: , , , , a woman named  and several
In addition to the parkas, they wear eskimo-style eye-protectors and carry canteens, tools, and coils of rope attached to various parts of their outfits
noticing  eyeing the rifle   is carrying
Oh, we're not going to shoot anything
That's not what we mean by "hunting
" (then, laughing, to Jimmy Pig) Jimmy Pig, you're not going to shoot anything, are you
(laughing) What could  hit
(to Todd) It's how we call for help
Two shots
There'll be someone on duty, listening in case we get off the wire and get lost or something
We have flares too
Come on
Other are already climbing the ladder out of the trench to the surface above as  urges  to follow
: " " - It's very still, no wind
The little group of  is moving along a wire that passes close to the towering ruins of the wrecked spaceship
They are tiny figures in the vast landscape
as they plod along in the line of indicates the wreck off to the right
Sandra said she told you how we wound up here
Our parents and so on
(turning left, indicating) Over here, we call these "catcher trenches
" follows his look to a long open trench leading, apparently, nowhere
(continuing) Smaller stuff that blows across the ground, it falls in these trenches, it works sort of like a filter
We go through the trenches sometimes and get some good stuff
As they pass close along the trench,   looks in and observes the trench is knee deep in muddy water with rusty machine parts and assorted junk protruding
chuckles at the sight
We try to work 'em when they're dry
It's lousy going in there when they're flooded
You can see
sudden , "
" distracts them
looks forward, sees  pointing to a chunk of steel a hundred yards off the wire
, already fastening his safety rope and a second rope to the wire, then heading off toward the piece of steel, trailing the two ropes
, explaining the procedure to
Whatever looks useful, if we can get a rope to it, we'll go for it
But you can't ever go further than your safety line because it'll come up on you with sometimes maybe ten seconds or even less
is watching   as he approaches the piece of steel and starts to attach his rope to it
Like right now
You hear that
listens
Nothing at first
then a very faint
The sound he heard that first night when he was on the settlement "roof
" It's close when you hear that
can see
He's attached the rope to the steel and he gives a signal
As  start to haul on the line, pulling the steel toward them,  shouts at
'  ,
waves, starts back toward them
indicates for  to help haul the steel and the two of them are just joining in the effort when
,
follows ' example and, like the others, grabs the wire and hangs on as the wind  and tears at them
One of the pioneers, , shouts, points
They all see   being blown faster than he can run, his legs churning desperately to keep up with his wind-propelled body
To no avail
He's suddenly airborne, his legs still churning like cartoon legs as he flaps helplessly at the end of his safety tether like a kite, fifty feet in the air
An eighty-pound steel barrel blows past, tumbling in the wind
Bits of junk zip dangerously around like missiles
, crouched low on their knees against the wind, clutching the wire with one hand while they pull on ' safety line
But the wind is too strong
until suddenly is pulling, and ' strength makes the difference
slowly   is pulled toward them
and Pioneers exchange amazed glances at ' strength
As he pulls,  notices what the others don't
dropped by  , ten yards away
as he's hauled safely in to the group of who clap him on the back and hug him
is laughing so hard he can barely stand up as he tries to describe and mimic ' desperate effort to outrun the force of the wind
(shouting, guffawing) ' '
breaks off, suddenly sober, staring off, and the others turn to see what he's looking at
Everybody stops laughing
, carefully moving away from the wire to retrieve the rifle
The  is dropping off some, enough to stand
and the other  reacting with alarm at the sight of  picking up the rifle
as he turns, rifle in hand
'  of the  staring at him, the  diminishing further
looking toward them
Nothing shows on his face
looking sour
Trouble
Just what he expected
, taking a deep breath, smiling as he moves toward , holding out his free hand for the rifle
Uh, thanks, Sergeant
Thanks a lot
But  breaks off, realizing that ' attention is elsewhere
is beyond  toward the landscape
(and the other ) turn to see what ' looking at
" " in the distance, several miles off, where, hovering high above the junk mountains, an ancient issues a steady stream of metal and concrete debris onto the junk heaps far below
The faint  of the refuse tumbling onto the steep slopes is just audible over the  of the wind
, as realizes how he got here
, reacting to ' intense interest
Dumpers
They come every twenty or thirty days
As  turns and looks at ,  puts out his hand again for the gun
seems to notice the weapon in his hand for the first time
Unhesitatingly, he hands the rifle to
As  casually takes the weapon, the  breathe a sigh of relief, grinning again as the tension eases
has turned his gaze back to the  , fascinated
So that's what they did to him
Just then,   claps  heartily on the shoulder
Thanks, partner
These no-goods woulda just let me blow away
, reacting to the smack on his shoulder, looks at like what was that
Are you hitting me
But all the  are gathering around  in such a jovial manner that the puzzled soldier sort of understands this isn't an attack
: ( ) - The corny little tree with plastic needles, blinking lights, and topped with a super cute angel is only a foot high
It's sitting on 's cluttered desk next to framed photographs of 's wife and children
We can hear 's voice badly transmitted
(
) Sorry to disturb the tranquillity of outer space on Christmas Eve, but 'm off to the Caribbean in a few hours, and  wanted to make sure you'd got the transmission on the security sweep
Glowering at the monitor where 's badly transmitted is quivering and distorting,  waves the print-out map he's holding in his hand, a map showing hundreds of little dots against a vast field, stars and moons in the vast sea of space
and  watch as  addresses 's image indignantly
We got it all right
This is an outpost here, not the Third Army
You've got us securing thirty-four locations and erecting monitor units in one month and -- (interrupting) Piece of cake, guys
These are totally remote, totally uninhabited territories
All you do is set down, send out a patrol purely as a formality, then have those veterans of yours put up an -Type unmanned monitoring unit
You should be on about number twenty-five by the time get back from my vacation
What if we do run into people
say squatters or refugees
(a frown) Well, you sure as hell don't want to get involved in evacuating people and that sort of thing
(then, meaningfully) My advice would be to
"avoid paperwork
" Eliminate them, you mean
Well, no one's out there, but officially these are "hostile zones
"  Therefore you'd be within your rights to classify anyone as "hostile,"  think
But  repeat, you should be worried about boredom, not action
Any other questions before  go
hesitates
and  look at him
Then blurts a question, his voice breaking
Down there
is it snowing
(a smirk) Not in the Caribbean
Have a good Christmas, guys
See you when  get back
'  disappears and the video screen goes blank, leaving a glum silence broken only by the  of the rain on the roof
moodily strolls toward his desk, and his eyes go to the photographs
His wife and children smile back at him from the pictures

Their eyes glitter in the lurching beam, their faces are ghostly like vampires

Hi, fellas
At ease
Merry Christmas, everybody
Eyes riveted on the  , the   are unresponsive to Christmas cheer
In fact, they look almost angry, like big dangerous animals, as the three  stagger stupidly down the row of bunks, every eye following them
We brought you a little Christmas tree

And some good cheer

How about some Christmas pussy, guys
Anybody for a quick piece

There's a six-foot carved wooden tree festooned with makeshift decorations and ringed with heaps of presents in crude wrapping
There's an appetizing looking buffet and a punchbowl

This is the craziest shit  has ever encountered

He hasn't a clue what it is or what he should do with it
Laughing,  and  hover over him, showing him how to pull the wrapping off
Great idea
likes pulling wrapping off
That's fun
and  watch joyfully as  tears at the wrapping enthusiastically
getting to his feet
pulling away the last of the wrapping to expose a pull toy, a   on crude wheels made of wire and junk
takes the toy, demonstrates pulling it
The wings flap as the wheels turn
reacts with delight and amazement
Then grabs it
looking alarmed
He's on his way to the door, but is charging at him,
Not sure whether this is an attack or not,  watches the older woman scramble onto a stool next to him, still  giddily
As  eyes her (and everybody else) warily, she gives him a peck on the cheek and points over head
looks up, sees a strange cloth decoration with a sign on it that says "

There's a burst of applause as scrambles off the stool
Somebody starts to sing " " :   "" , , , , , , , , even ,
No sign of

The merriment has evolved into a more spiritual mood as the  join in the solemn hymn
But  spots  trying to pull his pull toy along so the wings flap

Immediately  disengages from the adults and rushes to the sobbing  and clutches him to her breast, soothing him

As the two boys make their ritual grunting noises, HAWKlNS frowns a worried frown, and we

She shows him the fat edible root
We'll eat these

Then all of a sudden
he's an expert
Whump

(a laugh) Well, not quite an expert
watches  go to  and hug him affectionately
Turning back to the vegetables, stone faced,  cuts his finger
Blood flows
He ignores it, continues working
But , returning to the vegetables, notices 's cut finger and immediately grabs a rag and takes his hand

Then, staunching the blood with the rag, she looks him in the eye, curious
Sergeant Todd
what's it like
what's it like being a soldier

Seeing his difficulty  tries to help

No answer, a stare
Do you think about food

His blank stare could pass for stupidity
What about feelings then
You must have feelings
You must feel something

He seems about to answer
and yet it's difficult for him
He could kill a person easier
On the floor   happily, oblivious
(at last) Fear
(startled) Fear
You mean
you feel afraid
(as he nods) That's when you're in battle
What about other times
Now, for example
Fear
(amazed) Now
Always
stunned silence
Finally  speaks
You don't
look afraid
You look fearless
looks at her
This is incredibly difficult for him, like physical labor
He wets his lips and take a breath
Fear and
discipline
(growing horror) Oh, my God
But there's nothing to be afraid of here
can't hurt you

Always
It makes us
alert

She reaches for him, hugs him to her breast like a little baby, holding him
But  is as tense in her arms as steel
He can't relax
He's even trembling

You're not supposed to do that anymore
He's speaking to  who is doing martial exercises
So what
'm a soldier
They're gonna kick him out
looks up from the blocks
They can't kick him out
They're gonna
My father -- (interrupting strongly) My mother says when someone's sick or hurt, you have to help them
You don't have a choice
(getting interested) Yeah, but what if the hurt person is
evil
You still have to help them
because if you don't, you're evil
(importantly) My father says
uh
he says, "Soldiers deserve soldiers
" Yeah
That's what my father said too
My father's making Sergeant Todd a scarf because he saved his life one time
He's knitting it
That's dumb
Your father's dumb

Blood oozes from his nose

That's what scares people
He gets stronger every day
They're both silent for a long moment

Yes

Dangerous
He draws his face back enough to avoid being touched

You're different from us, Sergeant
We don't hate you for that, but we have agreed that to try to include you would pose an intolerable risk to the community itself

Sure enough, veteran  speaks up

He stares at the bleak, windy landscape outside his shelter
He looks primitive, like a caveman, and very very alone as we

He reaches up and touches the strange water with his finger, then studies the finger, as though a tear were the most remarkable thing he's ever seen
He cannot remember anything like this; he cannot remember ever having cried

They continue dressing obediently, their eyes the sullen eyes of robots

You're afraid of the dark, Sergeant Caine
607 No, sir
But the manual says -- That's what nightscopes are for, soldier
For the dark
607 Yes, sir

He says nothing as he looms closer to then, heading for the door
The two of then shrink hastily out of his way
Stepping into the trench,  hears the wind  overhead
He approaches crude steps dug in the side of the trench and begins to pull himself up into the wind
As he climbs, the  wind changes pitch radically, and by the time he bellies over the lip of the trench, the wind is only a breeze
Getting to his feet and finds even the breeze is dying, replaced by a terrible stillness
As  looks off into the darkness, a voice calls to him from the trench behind biz

Just as he reaches the ladder he whirls again
Again his light illuminates the spooky trench
Again, nothing but water and junk
Relieved, he's just about to switch off his light when

Before    can cry out,  lunges at him

Sitting up now, using a flashlight,  607 is examining a terrible gash in his thigh that reveals tissue and tendon
The right side of his face is also badly injured, flesh torn, swollen and distorted
He pulls the first aid kit from his utility belt, opens it, focuses the light on the contents

Takes another needle, stabs his bloody cheek

His face is hideous

Backing,  trips, goes down flat on his back
607, only six feet away, hurls the door at him

Before  can pull the trigger,  607 snatches the rifle barrel and yanks the weapon out of ' hands
rolls, scrambles to his feet
And  607 clubs him to the ground with the butt of the rifle, crushes his skull with three brutal blows

607 doesn't bother to avoid obstacles, shoving beams aside like twigs, dragging his bad leg

For halt a second their eyes meet, then -- 607 advances on
Still encumbered by  clutching at him,  sees his weapons, but can't get to them

Vaguely,  sees  607 parry her thrust effortlessly and grab her
As she beats at  607 bravely with her fists, the big man slams her into a wall brutally
As she crumples, he hits her again
struggling to his feet, staggering as he shakes his head to clear it
His eyes go to , slumped against the wall, bloody
Terrified  look up at  607 as he towers over them

607 only flinches
and, as he  the knife from his neck by the handle, he turns to see who threw the blade

Air goes out of  607, the knife drops from his hand
But that's it for 's victory
Six-five, two-sixty,  607 is bigger and stronger than

Combining a martial arts feint and lunge with a vicious kick
But 607 counters expertly, brushing aside the attack
lunges again employing yet another skilled move
607 outmaneuvers  again, punishing him brutally
This time  jolts the bigger man with a terrible combination of moves, smashing him in the Adam's apple, kicking him in the knee, driving an elbow into the jaw
This time it's  607 who has to back away to recover
And now he seems to re-consider , revealing for the first time a genuine respect

Both men are bloody and exhausted their breath coming in gasps, but it's  607 who's on top, beating the last bit of resistance out of  who struggles desperately one more time
before he slumps unconscious
Horrified,  sees  607 smash the unconscious  with the last of his strength, "finishing him off

He toddles toward  607, who's still on all fours, and attacks, his tiny fists raining blows on the amazed monster's bloody face
