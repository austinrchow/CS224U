in darkness
Light begins to spill on her from the right - revealing her face, lost in thought
This is - pretty, painfully young looking
surgical dressing covers half her face
As we pull back a little we see that two   sit either side of her
They are   (thirties) thick- set, capable, and   (late twenties), dark-haired and pale-faced
The three faces in the darkness, each looking straight ahead - something from a Caravaggio painting
The roaring, which we realise is the sound of , gradually runs down into silence
The light from the bay door which is opening off-screen begins to flood the scene with  , revealing the inside of a
Stephan turns to look at the growing light
Then he turns to Rachel
Breathe
He stands
Rachel turns to look at David but he is standing too, his face a mask
Rachel gathers herself, then stands and turns to follow the other two, walking towards the light
As the three approach the opening and descend the ramp of the bay door, we hear a woman's voice: (

Rachel's daughter -  - stands at a podium, reading the Dedication to a rather large audience who have come for the launch of her first book
She's 31, and clearly her mother's daughter
The cover image from the book is projected on a screen behind Sarah - a black and white photograph of a young Rachel, David and Stephan
Above their faces, the title - In Our Hands
Their mission had been to return him to Israel to stand trial
Instead it ended with his death on the streets of East Berlin

People around Rachel begin to applaud, the sound almost startling her
Automatically she gives the same bob of the head, acknowledging the applause
Sarah, cheeks burning with a mixture of embarrassment and emotion, hasn't finished yet
She locks eyes with her mother
(') Mother, 'm so very proud to be your daughter
More applause
Rachel manages to smile

Rachel moves against the tide of the audience with a fixed social smile, murmuring thanks to well-wishers, trying to get out, trying not to look like she's trying to get out

-         7 She emerges onto the empty patio, slides the glass door shut behind her, muffling the chatter from the room beyond
She lights a cigarette, inhales greedily, trying to calm down
She stares at the sun blazing over the Mediterranean ahead of her
Her glasses darken against the reflected glare
As if sensing something she turns to see a   - her - watching her from behind the glass of the patio door, something  in his direct gaze
Rachel stares back at him in silence
Sarah appears behind the boy, her son, and scoops him up into a hug
Still the boy stares at his grandmother, who gives a tight smile and turns back to the sea
Another guest walks up to Sarah and she nods, smiling, at what he is saying to her but her eyes slide back to her mother, standing on the other side of the glass

After a moment it is answered by  , now 62
David Peretz
Yes
You were expecting me
David looks at this young version of himself
Yes
was expecting you
Would you come with me sir
David stares at him, then walks back into the apartment
The door almost swings shut and the Agent catches it, considering walking in after him
But before he can, David re-emerges carrying his jacket
Let's go
- We  with David,  on his face as the two men begin the long walk down the staircase
He doesn't say anything to his companion, doesn't look around him, and we  on that face as his mind tries to catch up, tries to work something out, to decide

They cross a busy carriageway, and wait for a moment on the central reservation for a break in the traffic
Parked on the far side of the road, two identical cars, their windows tinted
The Agent moves to the leading car, opens the driver's door and gets in
David stops in the road, opens the rear passenger door and throws his jacket inside
He pauses for a moment and turns to look back at the second car

He watches as David straightens up, hands on hips, squinting up at the sun

The Agent turns
What, sir
(Beat) -  think
He stands like that for a moment and then suddenly in front of an on-coming
The impact sweeps him out of the frame
The shocked Agent scrambles out of the vehicle as other cars screech to a halt in front of David's lifeless body

Rachel is re-joining the table, taking her place beside her daughter amidst the dinner party chatter
Sarah watches her

If you'd rather read something else, mother

She is staring at a black and white photograph in the book
We see that the photograph is of a   in It's titled:  , "The Surgeon of Birkenau

Rachel looks up at her, realizes what Miriam is talking about
( little automatic) It's a wonderful achievement
'm very proud of her
And 'm sure you were invaluable in the research
(Keeping it light) Actually, my mother withstood all interrogation
My father was the talker
(Trying a joke) 'm the only journalist in Israel she won't speak to
Miriam laughs obligingly but Sarah instantly regrets the remark
There is a sudden excited  from the table
The women look over to where Stephan approaches the table
He is in a motorised
The Mossad Agent attends discreetly in the background
Rachel's face hardens
thought he couldn't come

Several of the local  have stood up to greet Stephan, who is all smiles and handshakes

Rachel watches as he takes a place at the table, picks up a copy of the book and examines the cover photograph, holding his glasses a little from his eyes to focus

More polite laughter from the table

That's very good
Rachel takes a sip of water and notices Stephen's hands, crumbling some bread - they're
She looks up at his face, reads the hidden  there

'm sure we're all particularly thrilled to have two of the heroes of this story at the table
And even more thrilled that one of them has agreed to read for us
Applause
She gestures to Rachel who stands, still looking at Stephan
The table quietens down
Rachel opens the book at the marked place and hesitates, only now realising what she is about to read
Then
(reading) "On the evening of the 31st of December, it began to rain more heavily
So isolated had they become from the outside world that it was only when she looked out of the window that Rachel remembered it was New Year's Eve

Rain lashes on the window
She stares out at some  exploding nearby, then turns away and begins to gather three from the shelves

He's bound, his mouth taped, apparently asleep
Rachel doesn't, of course, react to this sight
Instead she begins to clear away some pieces of from the floor
We  with her as she walks back down the short hallway into the kitchen, drops the pieces of bowl into the bin
From the living room comes the three distinct  of rainwater dripping in the pots

She stops suddenly, puzzled
It's a moment before she works out what she's noticed - something has changed in the sound of the rainwater next door
There are only two drips instead of three
She walks back towards the living room
'
- through the living room door we can see that one of the pots has been overturned
Rachel slows to a stop
sudden wave of adrenalin causes her to turn but
it's too late
Vogel steps out of the alcove he's been standing in so that he is directly in front of her
Before she can even cry out he has slashed her face open with a
Instinctively she cups her hands to her ripped face
Vogel grabs her by the hair and stepping behind her, tries to worm his other hand underneath her raised arms to reach her throat with the glass
Her training kicking in, Rachel uses a krav magah move to grab and twist Vogel's forearm, breaking his hold on her and turning the arm until, with a yell of pain, Vogel drops the shard
He swings wildly at her, but Rachel ducks the fist and drives the palm of her hand up into his face
Vogel stumbles back, surprised by her speed and the sudden pain of the blow
Rachel is about to press home the attack but is blinded by blood from her wound washing into her eyes
As she wipes her eyes clear, Vogel grabs a  from a small chest of drawers in the hall and smashes it into her face
She falls
Vogel begins to run, but, driven by adrenaline and desperation, Rachel scrambles onto all fours and lunges at him, catching hold of his trouser leg as he moves towards the front door
Vogel stumbles, manages to pull a leg free and stamps down on Rachel who lets go with a moan
He stamps again, steps free and kicks her hard in the head
Rachel rolls with the force of the kick and comes to a rest, losing consciousness

Then he turns and hurries to the front door

We hear the clatter of Vogel's feet on the stairs below
She raises the gun to the railings, to take aim

-                                         21 Bursting from the stairwell, Vogel starts to run across the courtyard towards the street

And, improbably, incredibly, the tiny figure of Vogel drops
Rachel hangs over the banisters far above us, gun in hand, staring at us with disbelief

-                      23 Rachel finishes reading and puts the book down
Nobody   moves
The air of bonhomie has been replaced by an uneasy   silence
Not knowing what else to do, one of the guests   begins to clap and the others hurriedly join in
Rachel   doesn't acknowledge the applause

The air is charged with tension
(Of the driver) He's driving too fast
Stephan ignores her
She turns to the window, watches as they streak past another car
(') This is ridiculous
What's so important
Tell me where we're going
We're going to David's apartment
Rachel turns to him, startled

What did he want
Fuck you
What did he tell you
Something about his intensity unnerves her
He didn't tell me anything
(Off his look) He didn't
He told me where he'd been travelling, that he'd been teaching
We spoke for a few minutes and then  had to go
Stephan is still staring at her, reading her
(') (Bristling) If you don't believe me ask him yourself
And then he can't keep it from his face - and she knows
Something terrible has happened

Piles of newspapers
Used cups
mound of laundry
Rachel as she looks about her, looking for something, some sign from the man she knew
But there's nothing personal here
These are the rooms of a man who had no real home

As the door behind him opens he stands aside and watches Rachel  past him down the stairs, without giving him a glance

She opens it and examines the contents - an - and
Stephan takes out a small   and slides it across the table towards her

Stephan sits playing idly at a battered old upright piano, a cigarette in his mouth
He looks up as David and Rachel walk in and stand framed in the doorway, looking every inch the young married couple
Stephan looks at them for a beat, then starts to play the first few bars of Mendelssohn's wedding march
The other two blush furiously, not amused
Rachel takes her case from David
Where do  sleep
You're in my room
He waits just long enough to enjoy her reaction

Both men can hear the   in the bathroom, both very aware of this new female presence in the house they've been sharing together for the last month

(examining the steel) don't know
Two years
All the places we've been to
You don't look at women
Before  get into that bed, is there anything you have to tell me
David sighs, blows on the steel strip and holds it up for Stephan to examine
We hear the bathroom door open and there is a quick glimpse of Rachel wrapped in a towel as she slips past the door heading for her room
The two men watch her pass

Well, well

There's an element of showing off and Stephan uses a little more force than is necessary
David winces but doesn't say anything

Yes
Rachel nods and they change places
David picks up the knife and repeats the "attack" move on her
She disarms him easily
(') Now an attack from behind
David takes his position, grabbing Rachel from behind, but he's so awkward with her the attack seems a little tentative
Stephan talks as Rachel practises breaking free from the hold
(') Where have you come from
Argentina
Really
Whereabouts
Cordoba
What were you doing there
My husband is an Industrial Chemist
Stephan glances at David, amused
He does look like a chemist

She sits down at the table, stares at a  before her
She hesitates then opens it, forces herself to look at the terrible  inside - a pile of severed legs, bodies covered in mustard gas wounds, phosphorus burns, a naked woman, barely a skeleton, held up by two Nazi nurses, a row of  , rulers laid beside them to indicate dimensions

He makes a small move - perhaps to go to her - then stops himself and slips back into the darkness

-                                         53 tram trundles down the wide Berlin street
Rachel and David are walking to Vogel's surgery, holding hands
She's pale, very frightened
David walks, trying, and failing, to think of anything to say to her
He suddenly notices an odd sound
It's Rachel, humming tunelessly to herself, very low
Something about this pierces him
He gives her hand a squeeze

-                                             54 The two stand in the doorway, at the foot of the stairs leading into the clinic, their husband and wife routine
(In German) 'll be waiting for you
She nods, trying to smile
(her throat is tight) won't
be long
They kiss
She turns to go, looking so young and lost
David hesitates, staring after her, then walks quickly away
Rachel walks up the steps towards the entrance

Rachel sits staring at the board
She turns her attention to the frosted glass door to the doctor's surgery

With a smile, the Nurse gestures for Rachel to enter

All we can hear is the sound of   and Rachel's tense breathing
Finally she takes off her skirt and unbuttons her blouse with trembling fingers
She puts on the gown, and slips out of her underpants, stumbling as she steps out of them
We  with her as she walks out from behind the screen into the large brightly lit room
She walks towards the at the centre of the room
On the far wall, behind a screen, someone stands washing their hands at a basin
As she walks, Rachel passes a tray of  , her glance lingering on it
She reaches the chair and climbs onto it
pause and then, tentatively, she lifts her feet into the stirrups, tugging the gown to cover herself as best she can
She tries to steady her breathing, focussing on the ceiling
bright  shines down on her
We hear footsteps approach
Rachel closes her eyes
Good morning, Frau Roget
'm Doctor Bernhardt
Rachel opens her eyes
Vogel is sitting on a small stool, taking a speculum from the tray of instruments, his back to us
Good morning, doctor
He turns and smiles at us - and he has a wonderful, warm smile, the air of a gruff but kindly Uncle
Alright now, just relax
We're going to do a little examination
If you feel at all uncomfortable, you just say
Alright
- 26

09   25
She manages to nod
(') Alright, this is my hand
and this is the speculum
It's going to feel cold
Rachel reacts as Vogel pushes the speculum into place, opens it and begins the examination
She stares up into the light
(') Can  ask how old you are
Twenty five
And how long have you and your husband been trying for a baby
Nearly two years
Uhuh
Well, the ovaries look fine
Alright, let's see
your cervix is slightly retroverted
Tilted backwards
Rachel raises her hand to her   and begins to fiddle with it
Really
The angle from which we next see , and the way the image of his face freezes in black and white, tells us clearly that this locket conceals a
Mmm
But that generally shouldn't affect fertility
Oh, good
You have a slight accent, Frau Roget
Where are you from
Argentina
We just moved here
few months ago
- 26

Whereabouts in Argentina
Buenos Aires
He looks up at her and Rachel instinctively moves her hand away from the locket
She finds herself nodding
Vogel looks away again
Rachel bites down on a wave of panic
(') Oh, Buenos Aires
Beautiful went once, when  was young
We went to the Opera house remember
What's it called again
Rachel stares at the light
Beat
Teatro Colon
He turns back to her, holding a swab, the warm smile
That's right
Beautiful
This might sting a little, dear
Rachel winces
(') 'm sorry
Now, there's a couple of tests we need to run, make sure there are no problems
Is that alright
Rachel nods
He pats her hand
(') Brave girl

-                                              57 Rachel walks out and finds David waiting, smoking
He takes her hand and they walk off without speaking
58
-                                        58 The two turn the corner, out of sight of the clinic
David glances at her
She looks pale, shaken
He feels a wave of sudden tenderness for her, opens his mouth to say something then catches himself
on their hands

Rachel and David appear beside him and join him
There is an awkward silence for a moment
Stephan sips his coffee
(in German) So
Everything
(in German, abruptly) Next appointment is on Wednesday
She looks at David but he is staring at the table
Like Stephan he is uncomfortable with the thought of what Rachel has been through
She takes his hand
He looks up, surprised, searches her face
But then Rachel lets go and walks off towards the toilets
David looks down at the   lying in his palm

As he nears Stephan, the man fumbles the keys and they drop
Stephan dips down to pick them up and hands them back to the man with a smile

We can see that on the other side of that high wire fence is a and a long, low building

Stephan stubs out his cigarette
That's the wrapping
Now all we need is the present
Rachel realises both men are looking at her

(Flirting) Nice
Rachel ignores this, begins to pin the cuff of one of the sleeves

Rachel examines her dish
(Politely) What is it
(Beat) It doesn't have a name
Stephan tastes his
(Grimacing) Shit
David lifts his spoon, blows on it
(Solemn) Now it does
They laugh a little, settle into eating
David stares at his bowl, deciding whether or not to say something

The place is almost empty
In the back of the bar the three sit in a corner drinking beer - just young people, laughing, a little drunk
They could be students
Rachel is reciting something from memory
Uh, at ten - study the Mishnah, at fifteen - study the Talmud
By eighteen - stand under the wedding canopy
We're too late for all of those
They laugh
Uh
twenty
In your twenties you are to "pursue your life's goals
" (Flirtatious) What are you pursuing Rachel
Rachel thinks about it, shrugs
don't know
'm waiting to find out
(smiles to himself) Youth
What about you, grandfather
Have you got a goal
(Smiling) Oh yes
We believe in goals in my family
We're very driven men
My father was Director of Collections by the time he was fifty

So what's your goal
Director of Collections by forty
They laugh
(To David) What about you David
What "life goal" are you pursuing
David smiles, stares at his drink
This is it
Rachel laughs, looks around at their less than glamorous surroundings
This is it
This is all you want
David laughs
He would obviously rather change the subject but Rachel is a little drunk, a little curious
Seriously, what do you want out of life
(Beat, shrugs) want this
want to get Vogel
want him to be put on trial and want the world to watch so everyone knows what he did want them all to know the truth
He looks up at their faces, embarrassed at having darkened the atmosphere
And

He gets up and walks off to the bar
Rachel stares after him
Stephan watches her
Forget about it
Forget about what

Nobody knows him

) All of them

Suddenly he drops them
He's about to pick them up when a man dips down and hands them back to him
We recognize the moment

Stephan walks on
In his hand he is now holding a small 76A

Rachel flinches as she feels the speculum

Who told you about me
Who
told us
Were you referred by a doctor, or
(trying to conceal her relief) Oh, Doctor Eisenberg
Ah-ha
How is the old Jew
Very good
Vogel busies himself for a moment
Any history of infertility in your family Frau Roget
No
Are your periods irregular
Rachel stares up at the light
Yes
Yes

Rachel stares at him - she didn't know there was a problem

There's something we can use, a little injection
Do you want to proceed
Rachel nods, dumbly
Vogel nods, turns back to his tray of instruments, begins preparing an injection
Vogel turns back to her with the
Instinctively Rachel stiffens
He injects her

(Stiff) None
An only child
Rachel nods
Vogel smiles, not unkindly

Vogel stares at her
Then, to her dismay, he , and pats it with such a sad, sympathetic look, that she feels her eyes prick with tears
Then he lets go and turns back to the examination

David is sitting smoking
Rachel pauses in the doorway and then walks in
small two bar electric fire provides the only light in the room
Rachel kneels down in front of it to dry her hair
David looks at her as Rachel spreads her hair around her shoulders
She looks very beautiful
She starts to comb her hair
On impulse, Rachel   the comb to David
David takes it
He starts to comb, pulling it slowly through her hair
Then stops
The atmosphere is suddenly charged
It's a brave thing you're doing
'm not brave
'm terrified
But you're doing it anyway
Because you know how important it is

Another stroke and then he stops again, stares at the comb in his hand
You're very brave

Rachel turns round and stares at him, overcome with longing

For a moment David hesitates, but then it's as if something inside him closes and he pulls back from Rachel, his face cold
Without a word he gets up and walks out
Rachel sits, crushed

She's been crying
Stephan stands watching her from the doorway, holding a drink - something slightly predatory about him
He crosses to her, sits down beside her and starts to match her notes
They work out a nonsense tune between them

It's whiskey
Defiantly Rachel drains the glass, grimaces a little
Stephan watches her
He continues to play, moving the melody up in octaves until his hand is beside hers, then covering hers
Rachel brushes him away
He puts his hand back and starts to caress her wrist
(') You're so beautiful

David holds it open for Rachel
As they turn into the street, David takes her hand
Both stare fixedly ahead, only too aware of what happened the night before

Alright, this is my hand
And this is the speculum
Okay
Vogel begins the exam
From beneath her  Rachel slips a You had intercourse last night

What about your patients in Birkenau
Vogel looks up in shock
Rachel grabs a fistful of his hair and pulls his head to one side
With her other hand she jams the needle into the side of his neck, and begins to depress the syringe
Vogel gives a grunt of surprise, opens his mouth to speak but no sound comes
He grabs vaguely for Rachel's throat with one hand, struggles with the needle with his other, eyes dull with fury, fighting the drug racing through him
Rachel fights to hold him, bucking on the chair, pinned beneath his weight, struggling for breath
Weakening,  manages to pull the needle free and it drops to the floor
which we see still contains some
rope of spittle drools from Vogel's contorted mouth onto her face
Then his eyelids flutter and close and he collapses onto her
Rachel pulls his hand from her throat, gasps for air
Finally she pushes him to the ground
She leaps up and deliberately knocks the tray of medical instruments to the floor

The Nurse runs in, reacts at the sight of the prone

-                               104 The winter evening is gathering outside
David and Rachel are in the back of the van
David has taken off the white coat
David checks his watch
(Tense) know,  know
He accelerates
Rachel grabs hold of the back of the seat to avoid falling
She looks down at the stretcher - Vogel lies unconscious

One of his hands jolts free and drops onto her foot
Gingerly she steps free
105
-                              105 The depot car park is dark - rows of postal vans parked up
An eerie silence
Through the high fence behind the vans we can make out the tracks and dimly lit   beyond - patrolling in the little pools of light
As we watch a   comes out of the depot and walks through the carpark and out of the gate, his shift finished
106                                                     106 - We're watching the  walk in front of us and leave the car park
In the dark of the back of the van, Rachel crouches, watching him leave
She turns back to where Stephan and David wait by the van doors, bolt cutters in their hands
On the floor of the van lies Vogel's unconscious form
They wait in absolute silence, listening to the fading footsteps of the worker
David checks his watch, holds up a single finger to Stephan
Moments later we hear the sound of an approaching Stephan raises a hand and counts them down - five, four, three, two, one
The two men open the van doors and run at a crouch to the base of the foot-bridge stanchion, as the train roars from the darkness and begins to pass them, screening the two men from the
Rachel closes the rear door behind them and runs along the line of the fence to the other end of the yard and crouches down by a junction box, screened from the platform, standing watch
She looks over to Stephen and David in the shadows of the bridge stanchion

Again silence falls
Then faintly we hear another engine approach
Moments later another train begins to roar past
Instantly the two men rise from the shadows and begin to through the wire fence, working with fierce concentration
(Softly) One, two, three, four, five, six
107                                                  107 Rachel checks the car park behind for workers
108                                                        108 The train is almost past
The two men work feverishly, snipping through the remaining links, working their way towards each other - forming a four foot long split in the fence
They sprint for the stanchion again
(As he runs) Twenty, twenty one, twenty two
As they dive for cover the last carriages of the train pass
guard on the platform glances over but sees nothing but darkness and the vague outline of the postal vans beyond the fence
He continues walking down the platform
109                                                          109 Rachel holds her breath, but nothing disturbs the new silence
Along the fence she can just make out the two men crouched in the shadows
Stephan raises his hand in an , signalling they're ready
Rachel suddenly hears  echoing in the car park
Through the window of a van, she can see a emerging from the depot and crossing the car park
As she watches he takes out a cigarette, starts to light it but then stops
He is staring over at the footbridge, as if he can faintly make out those dark shapes at the base
He takes a few steps forward, puzzled
little closer and he might really see something
- 26

Rachel looks to the  - the two guards visible there are talking to each other, looking the other way
She takes her chance - moves up behind the parked vans
as he takes a few steps closer to where Stephan and David are crouched
(
) (calling) Do you have a light
The man turns and takes in this pretty postal worker, who has emerged
He smiles and walks back towards her
He lights her cigarette, studies her face
You new
First shift
The girls said it was okay to come out for a smoke
110                                                        110 David and Stephan lie listening to the murmured conversation
Yeah, it's okay
Are you working until midnight
Yes
After the late shift most of us go to the Vetter
Do you know it
David checks his watch again, nods at Stephan
We hear another
111                                                          111 smiling, pretending to be listening to the Worker
- 26

it's just on the corner
You should come along
She glances through the fence and down the track to where the train's  can be seen approaching in the gloom
This is it
111A                                                  111A The inert body of Vogel, lying on the floor
His hands, bound at the wrist, suddenly twitch involuntarily
112        - '  -                      112 - the Border Guards on the platform
The driver begins to
113                                                     113 The Border Guards watch in surprise as the train slows
114                                                        114 As it passes them, the train screens Stephan and David from the platform
The two men rise and swiftly begin to cut the remaining section of fence
As the train comes to a halt the last carriages stop directly opposite them, empty and dark
They're almost there
114A                                                 114A In the distance, at the head of the train, the driver can be seen stepping down and gesturing to the guards, pointing up ahead
There's something on the tracks up here
The Guards peer doubtfully into the gloom ahead
One sets off to investigate

Well, maybe 'll see you there finish in half an hour
Why don't you go and get me a drink ready
The Worker can't believe his luck
Half an hour then
He starts to move towards the gate
Suddenly the   , shattering the silence of the car park
115A                                                     115A Stephan and David turn back to the van

The Worker too turns back in surprise
116                                                          116 Vogel, hands still tied has wormed his way over the seats and is pressing frantically on the
He claws at the tape over his mouth, manages to pull it free
Stephan leaps into the van and is upon him in seconds
Vogel manages to give a  , then Stephan uses a krav magah move to silence him

He lifts a inside
(Softly) Fuck
He heads for the van at a crouching run

think it came from over here
No, it was one of those
He steps past her, peering at the shadowy vans ahead
Rachel stares at him wondering if she can take him down silently
(
) Stay where you are
She turns to see two   approaching the side gate of the car park
120A                                                 120A as the Border Guard comes back from checking the lines ahead
There's nothing there
Get moving now
His part of the mission completed, the Driver climbs back into his cab
120B                                                      120B as one of the Guards approaches her, pistol drawn
The second guard fans past, walking slowly towards the bridge
The first guard    into Rachel's face

What are you doing here
work here
'm on a break
Show me your papers, both of you
The Worker nervously fumbles for his papers, passes them to the Guard who inspects them
121                                                       121 David watches Rachel offer her papers to the Guard as the train starts to rumble back into life
He moves back towards the van
(hissing) We have to go
David stares over at Rachel
Stephan grabs Vogel
We can make it
Help me with him
122                                                         122 (Handing them back) You can go
The Worker gratefully hurries away
Rachel is watching tensely as the Second Guard closes on the van
123                                                         123 Stephan watches the train pulling away,
He has pulled Vogel's body to the door
(Hissing) We're going
Now

David shakes his head
Not without her
He moves up the blind side of the van
124                                                   124 The Second Guard takes a few more steps and stops in surprise- the  in the fence
(Startled) Hey
Over here
David appears behind him and downs him, fast
Guard on the platform has turned to see the opening in the fence, and yells out
125                                                          125 As the Guard beside her turns his attention to his comrade, Rachel grabs the guard's gun hand, sweeping it away from her, at the same time stepping in close and punching the guard's throat with her other hand
As he staggers back choking, she twists the gun free
126                                                           126 127                                                     127 Another guard hits an

shot rings out and a suddenly strikes the ground beside her
She looks up to see a  has appeared up on the bridge, rifle aimed at her
Other Guards open , jumping down onto the tracks and advancing towards the cut fence
Acting on instinct, Rachel returns fire with the pistol, and takes cover behind the wall

David scrambles into the back, barely making it before Stephan is peeling out, the back door hanging open
128A                                                       128A as more guards appear at the side-gate behind her - she's caught between them now
She watches in dismay as the van heads for the exit
Suddenly it brakes
Stephan throws the gear into reverse
and the van begins to reverse with a scream of tyres towards Rachel
The Guards at the side-gate open fire on the van hurtling towards them, bullets pocking the rear doors
The side door is flung open and Rachel dives in, just as Stephan roars forward again
128B
-                                       128B - The Guard from the bridge has run down the stairs and is now between us and the exit
As we watch he raises his rifle
Down
The three duck as the Guard fires, punching a neat hole in the windscreen
Seconds later the van thuds into him, sending him flying

129
-                                129 ' On the road ahead a Border Guard Jeep appears, driving directly towards them
Stephan has no choice - he floors it
At the last second the jeep tries to pull right but the van catches its rear side and barrels straight through, the jeep spinning off and smashing into the wall
130                                                          130 Stephan fights to keep the van under control, screeches into a turn and off down the road
Is he dead
(Beat) Is he dead
Who
The Guard
The one who saw your face
Is he dead
No
Stephen's grim silence says everything
He glances back at the unconscious Vogel lying between the other two
How did he come round
How the fuck did he come round
You gave him the full injection
Rachel hesitates
Did you give him the

Stephan can't believe it's all fallen apart so quickly
We could have gone
It's not over
We could have fucking

We still have him
Stephan glares at David but doesn't say anything
The van roars on

-                             131 Rachel sits on the floor looking towards the living room, staring at something
' three  have been placed under drips from the ceiling inside the room
We hear the three distinct notes of the water drops
Rachel stares dully at the water dripping, feeling exhausted and numb
key scrapes and Rachel turns to the door as Stephan and David walk in, hair soaked from the rain
(Standing up) What did he say
Stephan stalks past, ignoring her
You made contact
David nods
David looks after Stephan who's walked on into the living room in grim silence
What did he say
- 26

09   56
It's going to take time
They need to open up a new route, they need to find political help
Maybe the Americans
Two weeks
maybe three
Rachel reacts with dismay
Rachel moves after David towards the living room
The camera continues after her
We work four shifts guarding him
We feed him at the end of each shift
We never leave him alone
(turns to Rachel, hard) And you're compromised
You don't leave the fucking house
We can do this
We just need to stay focussed
The three turn to stare at something off-screen
The camera continues into the room to find Vogel's body slumped on the floor, bound to the radiator, mouth taped, slumped, unconscious
We continue towards him
closing on his face
Then his eyes open and he looks at us

-                   132 Rachel's   and she lies in bed listening to the muffled sound of Vogel  and  in German next door - a breakfast ritual that has been going on for days
(In German) Fucking assholes
Fucking pig shit food
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck
David and Stephan are wrestling with an enraged Vogel, trying to feed him
clatters to the floor
Vogel's shouts are muffled as his mouth is taped again
- 26

He continues to swear at his captors as best he can through his gag
Rachel tries to block out the sound with her blanket
133                                                           133 Rachel walks in and finds a flushed David wiping oatmeal off his trousers, the empty bowl on the bench beside him
(Off her look) At this rate he's going to starve himself to death before we can get him back
134      -                                            134 Rachel sits in the armchair near the end of her shift, watching Vogel who is slumped asleep
He looks dishevelled, the oatmeal he refused to eat smeared down his chin
She can't delay the moment anymore
She takes a bowl of prepared oatmeal from the table beside her and walks towards Vogel, stirring the bowl with an unsteady hand
She kneels down in front of him
In the silence, we hear rain falling heavily outside
Vogel wakes, stays slumped, staring at her with dull eyes
She takes the napkin that was covering the bowl and wipes the food from his chin
Finally she removes the tape from his mouth
Vogel watches her without moving
She offers him a spoon of oatmeal, waiting for the sudden yelling and abuse
He says nothing, just opens his mouth obediently
Rachel feeds him a spoonful of oatmeal
He speaks to Rachel in German, subtitled
My wife
Rachel ignores him, feeds him another spoonful
(') Is she hurt
Another spoonful, and another
- 26

(') Is she alright
An   on the table, rings - the end of her shift
She wipes his mouth, tears some tape from the roll
Vogel closes his eyes, a look of such genuine suffering it stops Rachel
(') Please
Tell me she's alright
Rachel puts the tape over his mouth and stands
David walks in and takes his place in the  facing Vogel
Rachel begins to leave
She looks back at Vogel who is staring after her, eyes pleading
She hesitates then gives a small nod and turns to walk out of the room, passing Stephan who has been standing in the doorway, watching her
135     -                                          135 Rachel starts to wash the oatmeal bowl
Stephan follows her in
You can't talk to him
didn't say anything
You can't listen to him
know
just
(overlapping) 'm not angry - He rubs her back
Rachel stiffens a little
(') - 'm just telling you - we don't talk to him
We don't listen to him
He isn't there
He isn't a human being
He
He stops himself
(') We have a date
Ten days time
The Americans are going to help
Rachel looks at him, relieved

Good
He smiles, stares at her, moves a little closer but Rachel has already side-stepped him and walked away
136      -                                             136 Stephan sits on the armchair in front of Vogel, taking the apart, cleaning it
137      -                                             137 Vogel thrashes around on the floor as best he can, David holding him down
Stephan tries to force oatmeal into him
He spits it back out
138     -                                                 138 Rachel is cleaning, trying to keep busy, trying to keep the encroaching decay of the kitchen at bay, scrubbing and scrubbing
139     -                                             139 An exhausted David, finishing his shift, walks out of the living room as Stephan walks out of his bedroom to take his place
Rachel walks out of the bathroom and into her bedroom, for a moment the three criss-crossing each other's paths
Rachel's bedroom door closes
Both men avoid looking at each other as they pass it
140     -                                             140 Stephan and David are carrying a struggling, cursing Vogel towards the bathroom
Before they can get there Vogel pisses himself, the urine puddling on the floor at their feet
Fuck
Stephan drops Vogel in disgust jumping back out of the way
Vogel lies in the pool, staring up at him, eyes triumphant

-                             143 Vogel leans against the wall, staring blankly at the window, sunk into a profound depression
He looks filthy, jaw dark with beard growth
Rachel watches him from the doorway
144                                                            144 Rachel is washing Vogel's face with a towel
He pays no attention, continuing to stare out of the window
Rachel picks up a bowl of shaving cream, strips the tape off 's mouth, and begins to brush the cream over his face
She produces a  and carefully begins to shave his cheeks
She stops suddenly, a  is running down Vogel's cheek, cutting a line through the soap
He turns his eyes to her
Why don't you just kill me now
Rachel pauses for a moment
(') How can you keep me waiting to die like this
Rachel keeps on shaving
know what you want
You want to hand me over to the others, let there be some fucking sham of a trial
Then, when they kill me, you can tell yourself that there was no blood on your hands
Rachel switches to the other cheek
Vogel's getting more animated, tears in his eyes, a kind of bizarre indignation
(') But that isn't true
There will be blood on your hands
() - 26

09    61
(') You will be my murderer
You fucking hypocrite
You fucking
Rachel tilts his chin up a little and puts the razor to his throat
He falls silent, tenses, waiting
Then
(') (Softly) Yes
Do it
You want to do it
Rachel finishes with a trembling hand
Vogel slumps back against the wall, the tension in his body easing away
He gives her a long, calculating look
And as we watch some  seems to come over him, some new fire beginning to kindle in him - a sense of cold contempt for Rachel and with it, perhaps, a fresh determination to survive this
(') That's right
'd forgotten
You Jews never knew how to kill
Only how to die
Rachel wipes the razor clean on the towel,  fresh tape onto Vogel's mouth and gets up
145
-                                         145 Rachel is cleaning the kitchen again, clearing some of the mess of dishes into the sink
She moves a dirty pan which has been left overnight and stops, staring at the  which is crawling inside
sudden wave of  hits her
146     -                                        146 Rachel crouches at the toilet, vomiting
She finishes, rinses her mouth, looks at her pale reflection
She opens the door and steps out
Vogel stands
Rachel stands frozen - a split second of total panic
Then Stephan steps into sight behind Vogel, gun in hand - the morning bathroom visit
- 26

Rachel flattens herself against the hall wall, quickly wiping her mouth dry, as Stephan pushes Vogel past her towards the bathroom
147
-                                          147 Stephan is walking back home
wails somewhere nearby and Stephan hurriedly cuts into an alley, waiting in the shadows until the siren has faded away
Then he hurries on his way
148      -                                          148 Rachel uncovers the dish of prepared oatmeal and kneels down beside a sleeping Vogel
She removes the tape
Vogel wakes, breathes out, watches her
After a moment
was dreaming about my wife
She feeds him some more
(') One of the great regrets of my life is that we were unable to have children
My wife would have made a wonderful mother
Vogel watches her, then suddenly
(') It's a great blessing
Rachel stares at him
(') You should try lemons
For the morning sickness
Rachel can't move
(') They say it helps

Rachel spoons in another mouthful

Retribution

Rachel shovels in another mouthful
He chews it thoughtfully, examines her face
(') Yes
understand you perfectly
(Beat) You weren't lying at the clinic when you told me about your mother were you
About her death
Rachel loads the spoon with more oatmeal, determined not to show any emotion
(') 'm very sorry for your loss
It almost takes her breath away
She tears the tape and puts it over his mouth, gets up and walks away, determined not to show him any emotion
Vogel watches her go

She gives in to them, turns and finds David behind her
What happened
What's the matter
She can't speak at first
Nothing
He
nothing
She wipes her face
(') He can understand us
What
He can understand every word we're saying
He just spoke to me

Her face contorts as she tries to compose herself
David reaches out to hold her
It's alright
It's alright
It's nearly over
He pulls her close, holds her, rests his forehead against hers
They stand like that, eyes closed
The moment hangs
(Suddenly) Why didn't you go
At the station
You could have got away
Why didn't you
She looks up at him
He stares into her eyes
Beat
Then, suddenly he kisses her
It's what she's waited so long for and she's stunned for a moment, then puts her arms around his neck, returning the kiss hungrily
They are helpless with desire for one another
There is a sudden scratch of a key at the front door and, instinctively, the two break apart
Stephan enters, hair wet from the rain
He stops, seeing them, sensing the atmosphere
They stare back at him
Rachel steps away a little, wiping her face
(') What did they say
Stephan stares at them in silence
He unbuttons his coat
Stephan
It's not happening
They stare at him aghast - this is the last thing they wanted to hear
What the fuck does that mean
The Americans have pulled out
(To Rachel) Has he been fed
So
so what does that mean
Oh God

Did you feed him
What does that mean
What's the plan now
(rising panic) We just need to get him to the airfield, there must be some other way, some
Stephan starts down the hallway towards her, angry
said has he
David instinctively steps in front of Rachel, raises a hand
(overlapping) 'm asking you
(overlapping) 'm talking to her
Supposedly it's her shift now, but instead of doing what she's supposed to be doing she's out here with you
(To Rachel) Now answer the fucking question: Did you feed him
fed him
Stephan stands glaring at her, then turns abruptly away
(Beat) There's no plan
There's no fucking plan
They said the operation is being "re- evaluated
" He turns to David
You know what that means
They're going to cut us loose
They stare at him shocked

It's a fucking mess and they're backing away from it quickly as they can
(') (Beat) No
It's happening

They can't just leave us
Yes they can
Because we fucked it all up
We fucked it all up and now we're on our own
Suddenly we hear someone  on the front door
The three , staring at each other

Stephan walks into the living room and aims the gun at Vogel

If it's them, he dies
Vogel lies, breathing hard through his nose, eyes on the gun aimed at him

David suddenly steps in between the two, the gun now pointing at his chest
(') Move
You're not doing this
He's not getting away from me
This isn't the mission

If say he dies, he dies
We're finishing this mission
We're taking him back
Get out of the way
There is another  at the door
David and Stephan stare at each other, the tension building
Abruptly Rachel turns and walks down the hallway towards the door
Stephan calls after her
Rachel
Rachel
From the hallway we hear the sound of the door being opened - the murmur of conversation
The two men stand frozen, listening
Vogel lies, breathing hard through his nose
We hear the door close
The three listen as footsteps approach down the hall
Rachel walks back in

151                                                       151 Vogel is tied in his usual place
Stephan sits in a dangerous mood
He's playing the piano
lyrical rendering of Deutschland Uber Alles
Vogel is watching him
152                                                          152 As the music continues the two men's workout grows more intense - the punches and blocks build in speed, faster and faster, both men breathing hard with the exertion, neither willing to stop, a real violence simmering under the surface
153
-                                        153 Stephan knows he's watched and avoids Vogel's gaze until he can stand it no longer and looks
154                                                          154 David is the first to break through the blocks - his fist stopping inches from Stephen's face
The two men freeze, staring at each other, breathing hard
The music crashes to a halt
155                                                       155 Stephan is staring at Vogel
He begins to play the anthem more discordantly, hitting the keys more violently, as if the music is possessing him
Then suddenly he stops, stands up and walks away from the keyboard
Stares at Vogel
Vogel is very aware of the sudden change in atmosphere, a sense of impending violence
Stephan doesn't move
The moment hangs
156                                                            156 David is taking over the shift from Stephan
They pass each other in the doorway without a word

David stops, staring
Vogel lies in his usual place
has been placed over his head, hooding him
The effect is deeply sinister
157     -                                        157 Stephan sits eating with Rachel
David walks in and throws the  on the table
Stephan glances at it, continues eating
What are you doing
It's your shift
(To Rachel) Did you know about this
About what
(To Stephan) His mouth's taped
You want him to suffocate
was sick of seeing his face
Go back in
Don't do that again
Stephan gets up and walks calmly towards David as if shooing him back out the room
You don't give orders David
It's your shift now so you can go back in there
He has his hands on David's chest, gently pushing him back
David takes his hold of the hands, pulling them free and suddenly there's a flurry of violent movement as Stephan yanks his arms free of David and the two men shove at each other
Stop it
They stop, breathing hard

09    70
We're not animals
Just remember what we are
Remember what we're not
He walks back out
Stephan sits back at the table, starts eating again
He glances at Rachel, but she won't look at him
After a moment she gets up and walks out
158
-                                 158 David looks up from his chair to see in the hallway
Something purposeful in her manner alerts him
159     -                                           159 David appears in time to see Rachel is putting on her overcoat
What are you doing
Rachel doesn't look at him
have to get out
(Gently) Rachel
Rachel tries to unbolt the door
David bars her
Rachel tries to talk calmly but she's fighting panic
Get out of my way, please
'm just going to go out for a few minutes
That's all  want to do
Stephan walks out of the kitchen, taking in the scene
She wants to go out
(appealing) No one will see me
Tell him, David

air
Please
Stephan shakes his head

Rachel tries to unlock the door, but David has hold of it
She struggles against him
Don't be stupid
He takes her arm
Rachel jerks free
Then she slumps against the door, her back to them
She's crying brokenly
beat as the two men stand over her, not attempting to comfort her any further
Stephan turns and walks away
David leans his head against the door, waiting for her to stop
160
-
160 It's raining heavily outside and water is dripping through the cracks in the ceiling
David kneels next to  with a bowl of oatmeal and strips the tape from his mouth
Thank you
David
David doesn't react
Vogel hums a tune to himself in between spoonfuls, watching David, his mood strange
(') David and Stephan and Rachel
He gives a soft laugh, finding something amusing in the sound of the names
(') If  had a choice 'd prefer Rachel to feed me
So gentle
in another life, the makings of a Nurse,  think
in another life
David continues to feed, careful to appear immune to Vogel
(') How is she today
- 26
03
09   72
(') You should let her get more rest
It's a dangerous time, the first month or two of the pregnancy
David stares at him, unable to hide his shock
(') (Beat) You didn't know
Vogel absorbs this thoughtfully
(') You're not the father then
(Beat) thought it would be you
thought
don't know
The way you look at her
The way she looks at you
David stirs the oatmeal, trying to think about what he's just discovered
Vogel doesn't take his eyes off him
(') Women can be like that, they like to make you dance first, remember
(As though to himself) So, she chose the other one
He shakes his head, shrugs
(') That must be hard, watching them together, right in front of you
And you not saying a word
Like the Poet says - "Great souls suffer in silence
"  wouldn't have taken Stephan as a family man
Too ambitious, too
Whereas you
David,  see you with children
(Quietly) Shut up
Vogel stares at him
This is the first time someone has spoken to him in weeks
He's quick to hide his sense of triumph
am expressing my sympathy
For your suffering
What does a monster like you know about suffering
- 26

09   73
'm a doctor, David
David stares at him
doctor
(beat)You blind children trying to change the colour of their eyes
You inject people with petrol
You
you replace people's hands and legs and you watch as they
He stops himself
(') This isn't medicine
This is disease
This is sickness
Vogel seems to consider this
So we were all insane
Is that the answer
(Beat) There's no answer
'm not looking for an answer
'm not looking for
He forces himself to be silent, tries to regain control of himself
He offers Vogel another spoonful, but his hand trembles a little with the violence of his emotions
You're trembling
David pushes the spoon into Vogel's mouth, starts to load another spoonful
(') It's strange
Here  am - the victim, kidnapped, bound, soon to be murdered, but  think you are the one that is afraid, David
(Beat) Afraid of the monster
He leans closer to David
(') (Softly) Boo
They stare at each other, eye to eye
Vogel senses a new brittleness in David
His tone becomes more assured
- 26
03
09    74
(') Yes
Do you know why it was easy to exterminate you people
Your weakness
saw it
Every day  saw it
Every one of them, thinking only of how to avoid being flogged, or kicked, or killed
Only thinking of themselves
David looks up at him with a strange, crooked smile, eyes glittering
(') Why do you think it only took four soldiers to lead a thousand people to the gas chambers
Entire families
Because not one, out of thousands, had the courage to resist, the courage to be the first to fall
Not one would sacrifice himself
Even when we took their children from them knew then that you people had no right to live, no right to
He may have begun his speech hoping to get a reaction from David but he has lost himself in his rant and so rather than triumph we see only a moment of startled fear in his eyes as David suddenly swings the bowl violently at his head,   on the pipe to which he is tied
He grabs Vogel by the collar and begins to punch him, hard, again and again
Vogel slides sideways, limp
And still David punches him in a murderous rage, possessed, wanting to break his skull open, to kill him
Rachel and Stephan run in, with Rachel reaching him first
She throws her arms around him, trying to stop him, but - instinctively - he throws a punch behind him
It connects, splitting her lip and sending her flying to the ground
Stephan runs at him, knocking him to the floor, and remains lying on him, the two of them breathing hard, the assault finally over
slumps forward, held up only by the rope at his wrists binding him to the pipe on the wall
Stephan is still struggling with David, who's panting, adrenalised, staring wildly at Vogel's slumped body
Out
We're going out

He begins to drag him out
Stephan nods in the direction of (') (to Rachel) Are you going to be alright
Rachel nods
As she hears the door close, she turns to stare at Vogel

162 Rachel cleans the blood from 's face
He has his eyes closed
(Mumbling, in German) Thank you
She tears off a new strip of tape and places it over 's mouth, gently
She notices the rain leaking in through the ceiling and walks off towards the kitchen
We hold on Vogel, apparently sleeping
Then his tied hand reaches out, straining and manages to reach one of the  of broken bowl
163     -                                          163 Rachel gathers three

as she finishes with the pots and notices the pieces of shattered bowl scattered around Vogel
She kneels down in front of him and collects up the pieces
She glances up at Vogel, checking him
He is still slumped, eyes closed
We  with her as she walks back into the kitchen
From the living room comes the three distinct  of rainwater dripping in the pots
She drops the pieces of bowl into the bin and stops, puzzled
It's a moment before she works out what she's noticed - something has changed in the sound of the rainwater next door
There only two drips instead of three
She walks back towards the living room
'
- through the living room door we can see that one of the pots has been overturned
Rachel slows to a stop
sudden wave of adrenalin causes her to turn but
it's too late
Vogel steps out of the alcove he's been standing in so that he is directly in front of her
Before she can even cry out he has slashed her face open with a
Instinctively she cups her hands to her ripped face
Vogel grabs her by the hair and stepping behind her, tries to worm his other hand underneath her raised arms to reach her throat with the glass
Her training kicking in, Rachel uses a krav magah move to grab and twist Vogel's forearm, breaking his hold on her and turning the arm until, with a yell of pain, Vogel drops the shard
He swings wildly at her, but Rachel ducks the fist and drives the palm of her hand up into his face
Vogel stumbles back, surprised by her speed and the sudden pain of the blow
Rachel is about to press home the attack but is blinded by blood from her wound washing into her eyes
As she wipes her eyes clear, Vogel grabs a  from a small chest of drawers in the hall and smashes it into her face
She falls
Vogel begins to run, but, driven by adrenaline and desperation, Rachel scrambles onto all fours and lunges at him, catching hold of his trouser leg as he moves towards the front door
Vogel stumbles, manages to pull a leg free and stamps down on Rachel who lets go with a moan
He stamps again, steps free and kicks her hard in the head

Rachel rolls with the force of the kick and comes to a rest, losing consciousness

-   - Fluttering in and out of darkness - Vogel's feet as he stands beside us, breathing hard
Then he turns and hurries to the front door
and out

164 Vogel hurries along the walkway and sets off down the spiral staircase of the apartment building

We wait for her to cough as we saw her do before
But she doesn't
She just continues to lie still

/ -                          168 Vogel clears the stairs and bursts into the courtyard
There is a lurid flash of fireworks from nearby and for a moment we see Vogel lit, as he passes the point where earlier we saw him drop to the ground
He reaches the gate and goes through, his shadow disappearing on the pavement
He's gone

David sits, staring ahead, in shock
Stephan bursts in, out of breath
Nothing
Not a trace
Nothing at all

He hurries to the drawers and takes out the gun, puts it into his waistband
(') He might go to the house, might try and get a message to the wife
(Without looking up) He's not going back to the house
He's gone
Fifteen years, it took them to find him
And he's gone
And no-one's going to find him again
So we what
We
are you going to make the phone call
Are you going to tell them how he got a fucking piece of broken bowl
Wonderful
But don't try and take me down with you
've done nothing wrong
Remember that
Stephan kicks at the chair, at the drawers
(') (muttering tensely) This can't happen
This is never going to go away
take responsibility
It was my shift
(Quietly) This happened because of me let him go
And no-one's ever going to find him again
He closes his eyes, struggling with the enormity of his guilt
Stephan drops the gun onto the table, sits down
Outside we hear more fireworks
Suddenly
No-one's ever going to find him again
Something in his voice causes Rachel to look up at him
(') (Beat) What if he didn't escape
- 26
03
09   79
What are you talking about
Only four people know what happened in this room
Us, and him
And he's not talking
No one will ever hear from him again
(Realizing what he means) No
Nobody needs to know what happened here
He escaped
That's the truth
But that doesn't have to be the truth we take home
The truth can be anything we want it to be
The truth is Vogel tried to escape, you struggled with him and got hurt
The truth is, seconds before he got away, Rachel got the gun and shot him
The truth is we got rid of him
got rid of the body
got rid of every trace of the Surgeon of Birkenau
We can't lie about this
No, you know what
We have to
We have to
This is
this isn't about us
This is about Israel
This is a national humiliation
We can't be seen to fail
And in the end, Vogel rots away his life in some jungle, looking over his shoulder, waiting for the bullet
Who's to say
He looks at them both, trying to convince them, trying to convince himself
(') Maybe that's a worse fate
Maybe that's
The important thing is justice
justice is seen to be done

Rachel turns to David, waiting, expecting him to say something
But David looks like he's been barely listening, lost in his own thoughts
He notices Rachel staring at him
He's gone
What does it matter
(Beat) He's gone
Stephan seizes on this, sensing he's close to convincing them
(Seizing ) He's right
It makes no difference
No difference
All we have to agree is that we never talk about this
No matter what happens, we never tell anyone
The truth stays in this room
Between us
Agreed
Rachel looks at David again, wanting some kind of sign
(') (To Rachel) Agreed
Say it
(Silence)  need to hear you say it
She's still staring at David
He's still avoiding her gaze

Say
Agreed

Instead of relief she feels a kind of immense disappointment

Rachel is packing, folding clothes neatly, precisely, silently - but all the time there's a terrible tension about her movements
She tries to close a drawer but it sticks, She keeps trying, then in a sudden rush of fury yanks the drawer free and hurls it across the room
She stands breathing hard
Then something we didn't see - her gaze settles on a photograph beside her table -  holding her son, smiling at us
Rachel stares at the photograph, her breathing slowing

Sarah and her husband are on the beach below, playing with their son
Stephan watches them
He senses a presence and turns to find Rachel behind him
She sits down, stares down at the beach through her dark glasses
Stephan watches, almost holding his breath, working through lightning calculations of how to handle her
But Rachel is the first to speak

Finally she drops the cigarette and climbs back into her car

Rachel approaches a young male  at
(Russian) Good morning

Schevchuk
The man squints at her, checks his register an squints at her again
You're from the newspaper
Because  have a man's name here
Oh, no, no

Well, our visiting hours haven't changed, 'm afraid

Rachel looks away, unnerved
Someone has just walked in and is talking to the Receptionist
Rachel's view is obscured by the pillar and she leans slightly to see who it is
'
-  stands showing his press card to the Registrar
The Registrar passes the press card back
Mr
Schevchuk is in room 414
Visiting time starts at eleven o'clock
You can take a seat over there
Yuri walks across the lobby, towards where Rachel is waiting, but as he clears the pillar we see her seat is Rachel waits for Yuri to pass and then slips back out of the lobby

Time is almost up
What can she do
210     /
-                 210 Rachel's car is speeding down a narrow road that runs behind the hospital
Two stone arches frame the road, where the building meets the hillside
'
- high fences - the forbidding facade of the hospital - rows of barred windows
Rachel is scanning the building, looking for some way in
211     /

It stops, engine idling, and the  begins to climb down to close the doors after him
Before he clears the side of the truck, Rachel slips into the darkness
The , oblivious, reaches the doors and begins to swing them shut

The clock says: 10:50

She stares about her, picks a corridor and begins to run again
217
/  -                         217 Rachel reaches a  on the wall and scans it, frantically trying to locate the room she needs
She hurries on to an ancient looking  and gets in, jabs at the fourth floor button
With a groan of its motor the elevator begins to rise
218                                                          218 '

She takes the   from her handbag and opens it
Inside is a pen
She lifts this and the false bottom of the case away to reveal a and an  of a clear liquid
With trembling hands she begins to prepare the injection
She can't quite believe what she is about to do

The curtains are drawn and Rachel hesitates for a moment, her eyes adjusting to the gloom
sits in a chair, angled towards the window, his back to us
An  drip hangs on a stand, its tube running into a cannula on the back of a withered hand which hangs from the chair
The only sound is the faint, rasping breath of the man
Rachel moves a little closer
On the bottom of the bed hangs a medical chart
The name reads Ivan Schevchuk
Rachel moves closer, carefully taking the from her pocket

She can inject directly into the tube - and it will be over
She holds the tube, rests the tip of the needle against it
She struggles with herself
Just one tiny push
She can't do it
She stands frozen for a moment then slowly lowers the needle
Beside her, the steady breathing alters
The Man stirs and a cadaverous face half turns towards us

Rachel and Schevchuk stare at each other
The face is ancient, lined
but  '
(Weakly) Are you the journalist
(Beat) Do you know who  am
(Beat, meaning it) No
No,  don't
My name is Dieter Vogel

Yes
've heard of you
Schevchuk looks at his withered hands
(Simply) have killed thousands
You can take my photograph
The last photograph of the Surgeon of Birkenau
He struggles to raise his arm in the Nazi salute, a pathetic sick man
Rachel sits down at Schevchuk's desk, feeling suddenly exhausted

Yuri holds the doors, as the Nurse approaches, escorting an with a walker - the two moving at a snails pace
Yuri watches, amused

He pays no attention to Rachel as he passes her, sitting on a bench, dialling her cell phone
She listens to the other end ring

There's a knock at the door and an  appears
Sir
Stephan doesn't move

237
-                          237 From the other end of the corridor, as the small figure of Rachel steps away from the bench
She straightens her scarf and wipes her eyes, then begins to walk towards us
-   - As she walks towards the end of the corridor
238
-                 238 As she moves down another corridor
She reaches an opening on her left, which reveals a winding around a central lift shaft, caged in frosted glass panels
She glances through it as she passes
And just for a second we see an   walking down the stairs
Rachel has walked on a few steps before it registers, and she stops - She walks back to the opening
- 26

The figure seems to have retraced their steps, because they are now walking   the staircase, on the other side of the lift shaft - a shadowy figure through the frosted glass which quickly disappears from sight
Rachel stares after him, frozen
What did she just see
239
-                                239 She begins to climb the stairs
240
-                                           240 Rachel comes through double doors and finds herself in a long   -  and some  grouped around the room
Rachel begins to walk through the room - elderly men all around her, playing cards, reading, some sitting staring vacantly
She walks through them, staring at faces
Is he here
Is he amongst this ordinary world
She feels her pace quicken as she's drawn on through the room
It's as if she's back at that terrible night
Vogel's ahead of her somewhere, escaping all over again
She  through   into a junction area - a long, empty corridor leading away from her on the right, ahead another set of double doors
She bursts through these doors and finds herself in
241
/ -                               241 long, white tiled corridor of a room
row of windows down the right, under which sit
There's a row of  and  along the left
Rachel walks on, feeling increasingly as if she's in a dream
She's deep into the room before she realises it's a dead- end - there's no exit ahead of her
(a dull rasp) Why did you come
She turns and freezes
Vogel has emerged from one of the doorways on the left
Now he's between her and the doors on the far side of the room

(') Why did you have to come
You didn't have to follow me
He begins to advance slowly towards her
(') Was it Schevchuk
Did he talk
Rachel stands frozen as he creeps closer
He reaches out a hand as if to reassure her, a ghastly attempt at reasonableness
can stop him
won't tell him anymore
(Almost pleading) Nobody needs to know
As if the spell has broken Rachel makes a sudden dart for the doors
But before she can pass him, Vogel has moved with surprising speed and, almost before Rachel has seen the  in his other hand, he has stabbed them into her shoulder
She reels over against the opposite wall, dislodging a which shatters into a  behind her
Vogel goes after her, pinning her against the basin, one hand on her throat, the other hand trying to stab her again
Rachel manages to grab the scissor hand and the two struggle frantically
The scissors inch closer to her , to her
Her other hand emerges from the basin behind her holding a piece of the broken glass shelf, which she whips across Vogel's face
He gives a horrible shriek and lets her go, clutching at his cheek
Rachel collapses gasping to the floor
Moaning, Vogel stumbles to a basin, blood dripping down onto the white porcelain from his slashed face
He suddenly notices Rachel has made it to her knees and is trying to crawl towards the door, He walks after her, pulls back her head, gets ready to stab the scissors into her throat
You Jews never knew how to kill
Only how to die
- 26

Then he gives a gasp of pain, eyes closed, his whole body doubling with the pain, hands weakly scrabbling at the Rachel has stabbed into his thigh
He falls, almost on top of Rachel, and she finds herself pressed against his contorted face as he hisses and spits in agony
His hand searches blindly for the dropped scissors
Rachel grapples with him, almost embracing him, apparently trying to prevent him for reaching it
His searching hand locates the scissors and his eyes open in triumph, staring straight into Rachel's
He raises the scissors above his head
Then he stabs Rachel in the stomach
Rachel jack-knifes, as if she's been punched
Then
nothing
Both lie still
The only sound is Vogel's rasping breathing
Slowly Vogel gathers himself, drops the scissors, gets onto his knees - the victor
He climbs to his feet and begins to limp towards the door
242
-                                           242 as he walks down the corridor, breathing hard, trying to make it back to his room, back to safety
Suddenly he staggers against the wall
Something's wrong, something in his back
He twists around trying to locate the source of the strange sensation
And there it is - the   Rachel has stuck between his shoulders
He touches it with his fingertips, eyes wide with horror, feeling the rush of lethal chemicals through his blood
He twists again trying to pull the needle free but his legs are already giving way and he collapses to the floor
Moments later he's dead

He's evidently finished his fruitless interview with Schevchuk, who is sitting slumped by the window
Yuri turns, about to leave, when he suddenly notices a  upon the desk,
Surprised, he picks up the note and begins to read it
We see the first line - "My name is Rachel Singer
