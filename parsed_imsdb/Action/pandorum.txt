All from a bad case of cabin fever-

Eden was mechanical failure, not human error

They move through the room, passing the empty sleep chambers and the control console, seeing the entire pathway of dripped blood across the floor
Where's
your lieutenant
He's not my lieutenant
She frowns off his look and turns to see
on the floor in a pool of blood, throat slashed, dead
pulls the gun and heads into the open doorway leading towards the bridge as  follows behind
: -
tunneled stairwell widens out into the main flight bridge
stunning sight, a split-level glass control deck, rows of blinking control panels and flight chairs
It appears undisturbed, a thin layer of silt floats out from under their footsteps
leads the way, panning the weapon throughout the room with no sign of
On the far wall; cockpit windows coated with a black fungus that obscures the view, but hints to the illusion of outer space, a haze of cosmic dust without stars
( ) What's happened
to us
Where are we
goes to the nearest control console, tapping the keyboard
The computer instantly responds, data scrolling across the screen
Flight log
It'll tell us how long we've been out
and how far we've gone
types in a command and the computer begins to scroll through the flight computer's time-code
Starting with the launch date and time the numbers begin to roll faster and faster

: walks towards the windows and suddenly jumps back with fright to realize one of the flight control chairs has a sitting in it
, motionless and gazing toward the windows
Off her gasp,  grabs his gun and approaches as the computer time-code continues to roll even faster with no sign of slowing
months becoming years
approaches from behind
his identification tatto now clearly visible
>>004>>012>>
He cranks the lever on the gun with a  of magnetos and the laser sights flare brightly onto ' back
(') Seems my little memory lapse has finally worn off
"Lieutenant"
slowly approaches, moving closer to his profile, the stream of blood from ' ear shown running down his neck
() Mine too
Who the hell are you
keeps his gaze towards the windows, emotionless
(') You're team four
Why would you
switch bunks
Pretend to be someone else
What would you be wanting to hide
Who the hell are you
was younger then you when  first came on board
Funny,  can't even remember what it was like
before this flight began
It's all  know
You were the one
who first received the final transmission
Who refused to go back to sleep
You stayed awake
for all those years
What were you doing
what crimes were you hiding from when you took Payton's bunk
The time-code display rolls faster, years rolling into decades

: (2) () How the hell would you know all that
Is it true
What have you done to us
Where are we now
lazily nods towards the windows
Go ahead
Take a peek
You tell me
hesitates, looking toward the darkened windows
He stays with the weapon on  as  wanders toward the front control console, towards the glass
With the lights fading on the weapon,  gives the lever a quick whirl, motioning the barrel closer
( '  ) What are
you gonna do, Bower
There's no one left to hand out merit badges
No one left at all
And that makes it okay
To play God
You think God survived
He's gone
with the rest
There's no one left to judge you, Bower
approaches the glass, squinting towards the heavily smudged glass
She frowns, trying to wipe away the layer of sludge
Judgement will come for you
You think you could cover it
Your victims survived
Evolved
That's your creation out there
Your crime
jabs the gun into his back with force
(') And you thought you'd be able to hide it
Who would ever suspect that
Who would ever remember
remember

The time-code display rolls faster, decades into centuries

: (3) No world left
No law
No order
Only us
You the law now
You gonna be the one that brings order to what's left
Wanna take a shot at it
did my best with what  was given
Wanna be King for a day
Give it a whirl, Corporal
'd like to see how you fare
With the laser sights fading on the weapon,  quickly cranks the power lever, keeping the gun raised- slow grin spreads across ' face as he finally looks to him, revealing the thick streams of blood that have dripped from his nose, coating his chin and neck
(`) Try to imagine it
Imagine
yourself for five minutes without morality
'll bet you'd surprise even yourself, kid- Shut-up
( ) What's out there
shakes her head, rubbing away the sludge from the glass, squinting harder
Imagine
us both
What's left to stop you
offer you the kingdom and you- -- There's still quite a few sleeping beauties down there
a thousand flavors
You up for a little window shopping
Shut-up
(licking his lips) wanna see it
'll bet you'd be a - suddenly shoves him out of the chair, slamming him to the floor, jabbing the barrel into the back of his neck
() 121
: (4) There will be law
in whatever world we create
And you'll pay for what you've done
Believe me
chuckles with his face pressed to the floor
real boy scout, is that it, kiddo
suddenly
flinching away from the cockpit windows, having just seen what's outside
Her expression is ghostly as she back pedals
(') What is it
looks up with a blood-soaked grin
(') What do you see
You ready for the new world, corporal
keeps the gun on him as he goes to the windows has a ghostly expression, unable to speak
leans toward the glass, squinting into the darkness and
An object moves past the outside of the glass
He leans closer, squinting to see
a school of   dart past
The shin is underwater
staggers in shock, back pedalling as  continues to chuckle
() We've
we've already crashed
We've already
we're
The time-code display rolls centuries past, more then a thousand years accounted for as it finally slows to a stop

down here
all this time
All this

: (5) staggers against the console in shock,
the weapon lowering to his side
guess this thing does land itself
Just doesn't float too well
lunges towards him and  is ready for this one, quickly countering his move and   into the console
He unleashes a vicious  into ' throat
collapses, choking for air and  kicks the gun away
He kneels over , slowly pulling out a blade
G_ALLO (') And you thought you could be King
He slides the blade under ' neck and
there's a of magnetos
He looks up to see  cranking the lever on the energy gun
She tries to turn the gun towards him and
lunges toward her just as she's able to
The of energy goes into the console with a  of 1 , knocking everyone off their feet
Shattered glass and metal  the cockpit window like a spray of shrapnel
sending a thin crack across the surface of the glass
She struggles to crank the lever again as  charges, hitting the gun away
He  her over the console
(') My apologies
Ladies first
of course
/ The crack on the window begins to spiderweb across

Water explodes through the windows, hitting the room like a hundred fire hoses

The tremendous  of rushing water rolls them down the stairwell and into the sleep chamber compartment in a raging torrent, a tidal wave slams into the wall
grabs onto  and they claw themselves along the wall as computer terminals  and  go black
He pulls her to a sleep-chamber and he jumps inside the open hatch, pulling her with
Are you crazy- He pulls her inside and turns to the control panel
He hits the keypad to read: >>>   >>> struggles to close the hatch as water rushes in, it shut on top of them
struggles to keep his head above water as the fast moving current  him into the edge of the doorway
His fingers claw at the manual lever for the door, tugging and tugging with no effect as the water rises above his head
: and  are squeezed together inside the pod as water quickly rises above the porthole
() Not like this
can't- like this
Hold on
Under the roar of the rushing water, hydraulics ignite
Micro-jets  and
The pod launches, shooting down a tunnel until they're  with a tremendous
They are sent spinning into a wild tumble as bubbles and gas erupt across the outer surface
and  slam into one another as the chamber turns end over end
Its roll seems to slow for a brief moment and  squints toward the porthole to see

: They are pulling away from the side of the ship
The exterior hull of the massive space ship slides past at a high rate of speed with a swirl of ocean water and bubbles
The pod  into something as  fly and seals are ruptured as  sprays in with a blinding
The chamber is sent into another violent roll as  and tumble head over feet, as if caught within a washing machine
The chamber finally steadies as water washes across the control panel, one last burst of sparks knocks out the lights, taking them into
Only their gasps are heard as they squirm towards the upper corner
only a foot of air remaining
He grabs the mask connected to tubes in the side and pulls the straps over her head
What are you doing
1 Put it on
No
can't- Not like this
'm not going to wake up and drowned- He pulls it over her face as the water rises with only several inches of air inside the chamber
gasps desperately into the corner
gasps the air through the mask, making her eye-lids droop, slowly going unconscious
gasps one last breath and the water rises over his head
watches her body go limp and squirms for air as
a warm  of   grows brighter through the porthole
As sunlight dances through the porthole, he kicks at the hatch and
: 125
- kicks open the hatch, gasping for breath
gentle breeze ripples across the water with a sunlight flickering across the surface of an ocean
He pulls  out of the chamber, ripping the mask off her face
Her eye-lids slowly begin to flicker back to consciousness
Hey
Hey
She chokes on the air and struggles to orientate herself, looking up to see him gazing down at her, coated with bright sunlight
() Where are we
What happened
() It's all right
It's safe to wake up this time
With eyes of disbelief, they turn to see
They sit on the edge of the sleep chamber as it lightly bobs within the ocean waves
They're just off shore from a stretch of mountainous tropical islands with waves crashing against the beaches
The unusual shape of the islands and their geography are nothing like we've ever seen on Earth
Several moons dot the sky and the sun is rising with a brilliant glow on the horizon
: Pitch black
low  is heard, a motor that is pumping as the water lowers, allowing us to see across the dishevelled command platform, the walls dripping with water
The water is being drained through the grates in the floor as unseen bilge pumps are heard loudly
The pump motors whine down and shut off as
hand flips off the switch for the ventilation ducts

: standing at the console, having changed clothes and recovered from the ordeal
He examines the empty tank where ' sleep chamber once sat
He eyes the other sleep-chambers, deeply contemplating
He goes back to the control console, scanning across the numerous surveillance monitors that reveal
and  engaged in a variety of activities all across the ship
Some are seen fighting, some searching for food, some searching for a way out, some alone weeping kingdom, for the taking
He pulls out a coffee packet and slowly begins mixing himself a cup, deeply contemplating as he looks across the screens
He glances over to see
, the younger version of himself, who is seated nearby, watching with a grin
The blood is gone from his face, appearing clean-cut, clean uniform
Well, if you're gonna be captain
what are we gonna do now
Off his look
: - Doors open to another sleep chamber compartment, completely undisturbed
Four undisturbed sleep- chambers are lined against the wall
enters, now wearing the ' uniform, he straightens his collar and kneels next to one of the pods, typing into the panel
grin appears as he removes the wedding ring (' ring) he'd forgotten he's still wearing
What is a King
without his Queen
He hits the control panel switch and

her  opening wide with a as she stares into
