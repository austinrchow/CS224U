: Over darkness a '  speaks to us

) Italo Calvino once said that myth is the hidden part of every story, the buried part, the region that is still unexplored because there are as yet no words to enable us to get there
(beat) But  was there for the end
took part in it
And  think my words can help shed light on what happened
My name is Abigail
This is our story
: - Harsh sunlight beats down over a bleak, unforgiving stretch of rocky desert
Amidst this desolation rise the ruins of an ancient Sumerian ziggurat, a massive stepped pyramid of mud brick that was once the center of the city known as Ur
:	 , kneels by the ziggurat, tending to a ragged band of sheep
He is conducting the first of his daily prayers, listening to a religious broadcast from Baghdad on a tinny
Presently, we hear
The sheepherder looks up -- -66 approach from the East
They touch down near the base of the ziggurat, rotors stirring up clouds of dust
disembark, their bodies covered in desert camo-gear
They wear helmets with polarized face-plates and are armed to the teeth
To the sheepherder they might as well be aliens
One of the figures turns to the East
We can see the rising sun reflected in the face-plate of his helmet -- and a hint of a skull-like under-mask/respirator beneath the face-plate
He raises a gloved hand, gives the "finger" to the new day
Another figure (a woman) waves a hand, urging them onward
They mount the central steps of the ziggurat
-  - The shrine is empty
The woman activates a wearable computing device, calling up a schematic of the ziggurat
She kneels, studying the floor
In the corner of the room she identifies a particular brick and presses it
We hear hidden - shifting and the floor opens up -- -- revealing a stone stairway leading down
-  - Dark
Sepulchral
Spooky
The figures descend into -- -   - -- an empty room with an earthen floor
The sunlight from above barely penetrates down here
One of the figures takes out a battery--powered lantern, turning it on, illuminating -- -- walls covered with
The male figure who flipped off the sun speaks via radio headset
That's great
We've got dick
(turning to the others) Is there any reason we had to embark on this cluster-fuck during the day
The woman removes her helmet
This is vampire
Intense, appearing to be in her 30s
Possessing a regal air
She wears a silver crucifix around her neck
Night-time's too tricky, Grimwood
You know that
One by one, the others remove their helmets
All vampires: (30s), a hulking vampire with an imposing physique and an even more imposing set of surgical steel teeth/fangs
(4Os), a natural-born leader with easygoing charisma
(30s), quiet and deliberative
Right now he's readying a portable ground-penetrating radar unit
Grimwood studies the writing on the walls
What is this chicken-scratch
Cuneiform
Dates back about four thousand years
So why here
Because this was the cradle of civilization
He would've been comfortable here
don't know, Dan
Seems like another dead-end
'm not so sure -- Wolfe looks at his unit, excited
The others gather round
There's something beneath us
' We see a cross-section image of the soil and subsurface features beneath them
has been buried down there
Is that a body --
Wolfe makes a few adjustments on the unit
The image resolves further
It's definitely a
Then, we hear the low of more hidden counter-weights and -- slides down from above the stairs, sealing off the vault
What the fuck --
Grimwood pounds his fist against the stone
It's solid
He tries to find a hand-hold, tries to shoulder it open in some way, but the barrier is unmovable
They're trapped
Radio back-up
See if they can open it from the other -- (0
) Guys
Wolfe points at the ground
tiny depression has formed, with sand funneling into it
Wolfe sets his radar unit down and kneels before the hole
The grains of sand are falling faster now, the depression gradually widening
Curious, Wolfe leans closer -- , suddenly  upward from the ground
It latches onto Wolfe's neck
dragging him down head-first
Wolfe , his head still buried beneath the sand
He knocks over the lantern, which , shorting out
Asher rushes to Wolfe's side
Then Grimwood
They grab Wolfe by the shoulders, , trying to pull him back
Asher is  by Wolfe's thrashing legs
He flies upward, hits the ceiling, falls back onto the ground, stunned -- Danica joins Grimwood
Abruptly, they wrest Wolfe free -- headless
erupts from the sand
Then -- unearths itself,
It's difficult to make out in the flickering light
But what we do see is terrifying
Spiked, demonic armor, clutching a sword
An elongated, helmeted face with a blood-splattered set of hinged fangs -- hinting at an inhuman physiognomy within
The hinged jaws open, coming at us
And just as the lantern goes out for good we -- : : -  - Danica moves down a modern architectural corridor lined in glass and steel
stand ready nearby, outfitted in body armor, clutching automatic rifles
Asher, Grirnwood, and another vampire,  are gathered by a titanium door outfitted with a biometric security system
Danica joins them, studying a   which offers a darkened view of the interior of the vault
We can just make out a  sitting there in the shadows
What's he been doing
Nothing
Just sitting there since we brought him here
(nervously) Do you think we've got enough security
Hendrix, if he wanted to out of there - there isn't an army in the world that could keep us safe
We didn't capture him
He allowed us to take him in
You understand
(nodding to the door) Now open up
The others look at her like she's insane
Nevertheless, Danica places her hand on the biometric scanner
Hendrix keys in a series of commands on a nearby computer console
The vault doors open with a , allowing Danica into -- - She steps inside
The vault closes behind her
We hear as the air is cycled
open -- -  - Danica steps into a nearly pitch-black "clean room"
We hear Despite her calm demeanor, she's frightened
From the darkness,   -- a voice low and rumbling, laced with an ominous gravity
(
) Why have you woken me
Your people need you, Sire
She kneels, bowing her head
(0
) (mocking) "My people"
You think 'm your messiah
Your Savior
We hear
pair of   pierce the gloom -- and God help us, even though he remains partially shadowed, this guy has to be the scariest mother-fucker we've ever seen
What makes you think  wanted to be brought back
hand emerges from the darkness, armored
Danica wants to bolt
Instead, she fights to keep herself from flinching as a taloned finger brushes her throat
Times have changed
Science has made great strides
Your blood, the sacrament you provide -- it can set us free now
see
And the one  killed earlier
He was vampire
(off her nod) You must forgive me
It had been centuries since  last fed
understand
Then offer yourself to me, child -- (lifting her chin) -- and let me quench my thirst again
-  - The vault doors open and Danica stumbles out, all but falling into Asher's arms
She's bone-white and there are fresh   on her throat,  staining her shirt
Danica
Are you alright --
She nods, shaking, struggling to recompose herself
Let him out -- he wants to see what's become of his world
: launching into the intro of his show
Tonight, Dr
Edgar Vance, forensic psychiatrist and author of the New York Times best seller "Human Health: The Whole Being Breakthrough"
Also with us is Martin Vreede, Chief of Police
They're here for an hour and they'll take your calls
Next on Larry King Live
-  - Taping is underway
Larry King sits at his desk opposite (40s), a smooth-talking pundit with a magnetic demeanor and movie star good looks
(50s, square-jawed), joins via remote feed
Dr
Vance -- you're a psychiatrist and a biochemist, isn't that right
Yes
've long believed that in order to achieve true health, we have to reconcile the body and the mind
Of course that also requires letting go of a lot of our old notions and superstitions, which is what my work is all about
Let's talk about that
How do you account for the fascination with things that go bump in the night
Movies, books, videogames -- seems like we can't get enough of our boogeymen
Vance leans forward, skillfully playing to the cameras
Monsters provide a means for us to transfer our more primal and darker urges into something external
In the case of vampires, you're dealing with taboo issues like predatory rage and sexual sadism
These are scary subjects for people to own up to
So we pass the buck to someone else
Exactly
Historically, people suffering from medical conditions have always been our psychological scapegoats
In the Middle Ages schizophrenia was often attributed to demonic possession
And vampires
Well, there's a hereditary blood disease known as porphyria that has symptoms remarkably similar to the classic vampiric traits
People suffering from this disease are anemic, they become sensitive to sunlight, they can't tolerate garlic -- Which is too bad, since my doctor tells me that's good for the heart
(turning to Chief Vreede) Chief Vreede
What's your take on all the recent rumors we've been hearing about vampires
The only vampires 'm worried about are the ones passing the bar exam
(laughing) Seriously, if vampires existed, don't you think we'd be on to them by now
The truth is, our streets have never been safer
Homicides, assaults -- violent crime is down across the board
If people want to be concerned, they should focus on criminals like Blade
Now who's this
Tell me about him
He's a sociopath we've been pursuing
Blade is a very disturbed individual
Even the name he's chosen for himself is troubling
According to witnesses, he operates under the belief that a vast conspiracy of vampires live amongst us
You have to look at the psychiatric underpinnings here
What does a person like Blade really want
Odds are, he's really trying to work out some kind of inner trauma
He thinks he's slaying monsters, but he's really trying to murder aspects of himself
The sound of  pre-laps over from the next scene as we -- : /  - -- a   ripping through an industrial building
Banks of windows  ,  ROlLS, brick walls , raining debris everywhere
, goes tumbling into the night air
Buoyed by the explosion, his body flies upward, trailing fire like a human comet
() race out, some of them on fire
as a   resolves out of the swirling flames
It's Blade, striding towards us in slow-motion, body bristling with weapons, the exaggerated sounds of his  ringing out like drums of doom
He looks like the God of War
We ramp back up to real-time
Then faster as -- -- a    - (, , and ) run for their lives towards their vehicles are pulling out; a Mustang and an Eagle Talon
Gedge is climbing into the Talon even as it starts to move, pulling the door shut
At the same time -- -- Stone and Campbell climb atop two stretched and lowered hardtail chopper cycles
Blade starts forward, drawing two of his custom  pistols, but -- --	the Mustang comes     him
Blade makes a -  over the speeding car
Momentarily upside down, he  through the windshield and engine block as he flips
Within the car, the vampires
The Mustang
flipping over and -- --	Blade, now facing frontward again, continues to  as he lands, aiming at -- , which haul ass out of the parking lot, swerving into the traffic on the street beyond
Blade   until he's out of bullets
Then -- (
) No more bullets, Blade
Guess it's time for you to fall down and go boom
, from the conflagration, their clothes still smoking, surround Blade
Call them , , , and
Blade holsters his  pistols
Then reaches for a wicked looking - strapped to his thigh
The knife has a button on either side of the hilt
As Ellingson  him -- -- Blade triggers the first button
The knife-blade ejects from the hilt, trailing outward six feet on a razored chain
The blade penetrates Ellingson's chest
He  as he starts to
But before his disintegration is complete -- -- Blade hits the second button
The knife-blade retracts, the razored chain  back into the knife-hilt
Blade , triggers the first button again -- The knife-blade  , the razored chain whipping around Denlinger's throat
Blade tugs
The razor chain cuts through Denlinoer's neck, decapitates him
As he  -- -- Blade triggers the knife again
As it ejects, he whirls it over his head, making a sound like a -
Blade drops low, swinging the razored chain
The chain slices through Emond's legs
Emond's amputated legs , the rest of him tumbling onto the asphalt
He
Blade retracts the knife-blade, whirls,  it through Doh's abdomen
who was coming up from behind
As Doh , Blade returns to Emond, finishing him off -- -- and Blade is on the move again,  after the vampires who escaped
-  - The bike-riding vamps cut across traffic, then  down an on-ramp to a busy street below
, sprinting from the parking lot to the sidewalk
He touches a hand to his ear
We  a tiny receiver tucked within
Whistler
'm on the Stonebridge overpass at Clemons -- ' Got it
Heading eastbound, 'm just beneath you -- Blade dodges past a  car, stepping onto and over the trunk, then leaps atop the safety rail of the overpass as -- - hauling a semi-trailer  beneath the overpass, sounding its
It has safety cables running along the perimeter of the trailer roof, like an aircraft carrier
' --
- Blade   into the air
He lands atop the semi, then tumbles, nearly slipping off the edge as he -- -- snags one of the safety cables atop the trailer
He dangles above the asphalt then  himself into the open back of the trailer
We  for a beat, then hear the of a high-performance  turning over as -- ' - out of the back of the trailer, sailing right over a car that was tail-gating the semi, heading into three lanes of on-coming traffic at fifty miles an hour
Blade hits the brakes, sending the battle-scarred muscle car into a spin, clipping other vehicles in the process
'  - As cars continue to brake and  around him, Blade puts the pedal to the metal once again
The Charger accelerates, tachometer red-lining as Blade pulls alongside the cab of the big-rig, catching a glimpse of -- Whistler grins, gives Blade a little salute and -- --	Blade reaches between the seats,  the newly installed nitrous oxide fuel-injection system
- Hyper-speed
The Charger jets forward as the  nitrous system boosts the car's speed by another 300 , leaving any and everything in its dust
In seconds, it has caught up to -- They draw -9s,  back at Blade
The bullet-proof windshield holds as do the kevlar body panels protecting the engine -- but the rounds chew the shit out of the bodywork
'  - Blade gives his car another jolt of nitrous
The Charger as Stone and Campbell fall back, veering to either side
Now Blade is ahead of them
He checks their position in his rear-view mirror, then stands on the brakes -- - The Charger drops from a hundred to fifty in a heart beat, causing Stone and Campbell to rear-end Blade
The vamps are ejected over the handle bars of their bikes like crash-test dummies
Stone  through Blade's back windshield, continuing into the front seat-- -- while Campbell tumbles over Blade's roof and across his hood, somehow managing to cling to one of the windshield wipers at the last minute
'  - Blade clutches the wheel
He's got a  vampire in the front seat, upside down, covered in windshield fragments and another perched on his hood, obscuring his vision
Stone tries to right himself, clawing at Blade
Blade struggles, keeping one hand on the wheel while he -- --	reaches for a shotgun secured between the seats
He As the vampire , Blade hits a button on the dash
The passenger door opens, spills Stone onto the road -- - -- right into the path of an oncoming bus
Stone is ground to paste and -- - , mostly elderly
The passengers are jolted in their seats as the wheels of the bus - over Stone's remains -- hope that wasn't a dog
'  - -- and we're back in Blade's Charger as Campbell continues to away at the windshield
The windshield spiderwebs
Campbell manages to get a clawed hand through -- Blade swings his shotgun over, shoving it in Campbell's snarling mouth
He pulls the trigger -- Campbell's - blow over the cracked windshield
Blade hits the wipers, spritzes window cleaner - but the mess turns to ashen sludge
making the view worse
- The Talor is up ahead, weaving in and out of traffic
Fighting to see, Blade accelerates, gaining ground -- The   leans out of his own wihdow, looking back at Blade,  an   -- '  - Blade's windshield, already weakened by Campbell, , blowing glass fragments all over him
Undaunted, Blade calmly reaches for his dash, hitting a button labeled ""
/'  - Roof-mounted   come on, bathing the car ahead and (more importantly) the vampire driver with
The vampire at the wheel , , leaving the car driverless
Gedge tries to lean over and take the wheel -- '  - blow back at us
Then the view clears and -- - --	Blade  his charger into the Talon
The cars briefly lock, grinding
Then they disengage
Blade jerks his steering wheel, gives the Talon
The Talon hits the curb, riding halfway up onto a sidewalk, newspaper vending machines and table-top displays piled with cheap wares, then a phone booth, a food cart
duck for cover and -- -- the Talon gets some serious air,  onto its side as it comes back to earth
- ----- the wreck skids to a stop against a streetlight
The streetlight ,   on the wreck gather, murmuring amongst themselves -- Gedge drags his bleeding body from the wrecked Talon
He staggers to his feet, clutching a pistol, limps away -- ' pulls up
Blade climbs out, shotgun in hand
The shotgun has an under-mounted stake launcher
Blade  at -- -- Gedge
The stake hits him in the back
him onto the street
Bystanders , falling back, taking cover -- Blade approaches, puzzled
Gedge is still alive,
He looks at Blade, eyes crazed, flashing his fangs
Staked you with silver
Why aren't you ash
Gedge coughs blood, struggles to speak: Why aren't you smarter
Not a vampire, dumbshit -- set your sorry ass up -- Gedge tugs at his fangs
They're fake,
Gedge is looking past Blade
Blade turns, looking up -- Danica is perched there
She backs into the shadows
But Blade doesn't have time to investigate because -- --	  are drawing near
Blade retreats to his charger
He  it, speeding away as we -- : '  -   - Blade's Charger pulls up to a boat house at the water's edge
Blade climbs out, disappears inside
(
) What the fuck happened tonight
'  -   - New digs
Built into the decaying boat house, retrofitted for Blade's combat needs
Blade is taking off his body armor, tossing weapons onto a work table
He's frustrated
How should  know
He was human
Whistler reaches for a bottle of whiskey, takes a sip
You've been getting careless, Blade
You kill a vampire, they ash, don't leave any proof of their existence
But something like this, a human corpse, it's messy -- (shaking his head) -- you better hope nobody IDed you

Somebody screwed us
Your face is all over the papers, the television
Media's eating it up
Like  care
You should
Something like this -- (gesturing to the tabloid) -- taking out a human, even one working for the vampires -- far as the rest of the world's concerned, you're public enemy number one
Didn't realize this was a popularity contest
Whistler shakes his head, frustrated
Damnit, Blade, don't you see what's happening
The fuckers are finally getting smart
They're waging a goddamn campaign
Now it's not just vampires we have to worry about, we're gonna have to take on the rest of the world too
(beat, adamant) They've got us on the run
These last few months we've barely been staying ahead of the curve
You worry too much, old man
've been doing this since before you were born, Blade
The moment you stop worrying, you're dead
Then Whistler's face softens for a moment
Since the day  found you, you've been like a son to me
taught you everything know

Baby on board
() moving below, her figure camouflaged beneath layers of clothing
She's in her 20s, lugging a  in a BabyBjorn carrier that's strapped to her chest, clutching a bag of groceries in either hand
She looks a little haggard
As we watch, she reaches an elevated rail station entrance
- Dingo nods and smiles approvingly
Looks like we got ourselves a combo meal
-  - series of shots as Abigail makes her way into the station, passing a few other  here and there
- depressing, dimly lit, partially open-air station
Abigail moves out onto the platform, which is now deserted
She glances around, a bit nervous, and finally sits on a bench
Beat
Just the wind  in the tunnels, across the platform
Then we hear a   -- Abigail looks right, sees nothing
We hear  , this time from the left -- Abigail looks up, briefly glimpsing a  ducking behind a concrete pillar
Unnerved, she stands, moving a protective hand over her baby

Before Dingo has a chance to act, Abigail gets him in a leglock,  him back onto his ass

She holsters her bloop gun, withdraws another   -- Scream if this hurts, chica

Coughing and half-blind, he hurries to a bank of computers, types in a series of commands -- around him synch up, showing the same protocol message: Data protection routine enabled --	Server 1 protection enabled

In response, a rack of network storage equipment and removable hard drives

The timer reaches zero
rock the workshop, knocking the agents back
'  -   - and    , catching all unawares, sweeping them up off their feet with a hurricane force
In the midst of the conflagration -- -- Blade briefly manages to tear free of his captors -- -- but the wall of  and  is rushing onward, sweeping up everything in its path, turning the world to white
-   - We are   Blade's perspiration-beaded face
His eyelids flutter as he slowly regains consciousness
(
) Rise and shine, sleepyhead
We are in a room with a one-way mirrored window
Blade sits, hands cuffed behind him,   shining down on him
He looks disoriented, battered
Very weak
Cumberland and Hale are sitting across from Blade
Who --
Special Agents Ray Cumberland and Wilson Hale,
We've been tracking you for a long time
Whistler -- Dead
Just like all of your victims
Blade shuts his eyes -- as if he could just wish them away
How many people have you killed
Thirty
Forty
hundred
Those were familiars -- people who worked for them -- And by "them" you mean vampires, right
suppose next you'll be telling us that Bigfoot's in on the conspiracy too
So what kills these bloodsu~kers, tough guy
Maybe you can give us some pointers
(counting on his ringers) You can stake 'em, right
Then there's sunlight -- what about crosses, Wilson
Do those still work
don't know, Ray
What if a vampire's Jewish
That's a good point
And does garlic work on a Hindu vampire
Or do you need saffron or something
Hale laughs
Cumberland shakes his head, his smile fading
You can keep doing your song and dance as long as you want, Blade, but it's not going to play
You're a stone-cold killer
And you're sick as fuck
(
) Let's leave the diagnosis to the professionals
, standing in the doorway
He's the man we saw on Larry King
He takes a seat by Blade, sets a leather case on a table
Hello, Blade
My name is Doctor Vance
'm with the Department of Mental Health
've been charged with conducting a psychiatric evaluation of you
(to Cumberland and Hale) Gentleman, would you mind giving us a few moments alone
Cumberland nods
They rise, exiting the room
Vance smiles, trying to project a sympathetic air
imagine this must be very frightening for you
But  want you to know that 'm here to help
In order to do that, however,  need to ask you some questions
(beat) Now
Can you tell me what day it is
Blade just stares daggers at Vance
What about the President
Do you know who's in the White House at the moment
An ass-hole
(sighing) Alright then, let's talk about vampires -- what can you tell me about that
-   - On the other side of the mirror, Cumberland and Hale have joined Chief Vreede
We hear Blade and Vance via speakers: There's nothing to tell
They exist
And are you one of them
-   - Vance sits forward, drawing closer
What about blood
When you drink it, do you find yourself sexually aroused
Blade just glares at Vance
You see, it strikes me that this business of vampirism has strong connotations of sexual confusion
Bodily fluids being exchanged, that sort of thing
You have to ask where that comes from
'm wondering, for instance, what your relationship was like with your mother
Were the two of you close
Blade glares
If he escapes, he's going to kill this guy
-   - Dr
Vance steps into the observation room, joining Chief Vreede, Cumberland, and Hale
What's your assessment, Doctor
He's psychotic, with paranoid features, possessing dangerous levels of sociopathy
He's exhibiting disorganized behavior
He obviously doesn't have a properly formed conscience -- (spreading his hands) For his safety and the public's, 'm recommending that he be transferred to County Psychiatric for further treatment
That's unacceptable
This man's wanted in connection with a laundry list of federal crimes
need him on a plane to the Detention Center in Washington tonight
Agent Cumberland, that man is in no condition to undergo prosecution
Cumberland and Hale look to Vreede with disbelief
Chief, we've got a federal arrest warrant here that clearly supersedes -- don't care about your warrant
We're in my jurisdiction now
You've got an issue with that, you take it up with the local magistrate
Dr
Vance shrugs as if to say he's sorry
'm sorry, gentlemen, but the call has already been made
team from the hospital should be here momentarily to oversee the transfer
-   - Asher, Danica, and Grimwood enter, followed by dressed as orderlies
The orderlies carry a straightjacket, various restraints, and a collapsible transport gurney
Danica approaches the  , flashing a hospital
Hi
We're here to transfer a patient to County General
-   - Vance enters once more
He opens the leather case on the table, removing a syringe and an ampule of fluid
(speaking softly now) Just a little something to keep you compliant
The normal dose is two, maybe three hundred milligrams
But for a strapping young hybrid like yourself -- Vance pokes the needle of the syringe into the ampule
--  think we'll kick it up to a couple thousand
Vance reaches for Blade's arm
Blade struggles, tries to pull back, but Vance manages to inject him nonetheless
There
That wasn't so bad, was it
(smiling) You're weak, aren't you
In need of your serum
Who would've guessed a mere human like myself could overpower you
(realizing) You're with them -- a familiar -- Going on five years now
Vance extends his arm, pulling back his shirt cuff a little to reveal a   tattooed on the underside of his wrist
Then he pulls his cuff back down, smiles at Blade
It's the end-game, Blade
All their plans are finally coming to fruition
So just sit back and enjoy the show
Blade looks to the one-way mirror,
He's one of them
Damnit, he's working for them
Vance looks to the one-way mirror as well and shrugs as if to say -- "The man's deranged
What can  do
" -   - On the other side of the glass, Blade looks like a raging lunatic
Vance enters
He extends his hand to Vreede
They shake
As they do so, we  a vampire  on the inside of Vreede's wrist as well
Another familiar
-   - Blade stares at his own reflection in the mirror
He blinks, trying to focus -- but the drug is starting to kick in
-  - An elevator door opens
Asher, Danica, and Grimwood exit, followed by the orderlies who are now wheeling the gurney
As they move down the corridor, they pass -- -- Cumberland and Hale, who are chasing down Chief Vreede
Just hold it right there -- Danica shoves Cumberland aside, hard, keeps moving past him
Cumberland looks to Hale
Something isn't right about this
-   - Blade struggles, in the full throes of the drug now
' His vision is blurring, various objects in the room leaving trails as he shifts his head from side to side and -- , , enter, followed by two of the orderlies
Despite his incapacitation, Blade attempts to rise
Danica plants her heel in his chest, shoving him back down
Easy, lover
You're not going anywhere
She draws closer, enjoying herself
We moved the humans around like, pawns, Blade
Used them to flush you out
Blade tries to  from his chair at her and --
Grimwood punches Blade across the jaw
brutal blow
Don't worry, Captain Sunshine
Soon as we get you out of here, you'll get a chance to play
Danica motions to the two vampire orderlies
They step forward with the straight-jacket, start to put it on Blade
Blade  madly
Asher , enjoying this
Don't make this any harder than it has to be
You're all alone, Blade
No one can help you now

The one-way mirror , exploding outward in a shower of -  , carrying with it -- -- a , one of the vampire mental health flunkies -- in mid-air as he sails into the room
Seconds later -- through the blown-out window, simultaneously drawing two high-tech electronic pistols
Meet   (30s), an audacious vampire hunter with an irrepressible grin
Slapped to his chest is a "Hello, my name is" sticker with the words " " written where the name should be
Why'd the Polish vampire starve to death
Danica spins, enraged, recognizing King instantly -- He kept biting his own lip
King
The lights go out
Immediately, backup lights come on, followed by
In the ensuing confusion ~ both pistols at Asher, who drops, allowing one of the vampire orderlies behind him to take the hit
But unlike Blade's victims, he disintegrates from the inside out
(The reason is King's signature bullets --  , explosive rounds that give off concentrated  light
) King whips around,  at -- -- Danica, who  behind the table
She quickly upends it, using it as a shield,  it at King
He shifts his weight, throwing himself and the chair he's sitting on to the floor
Then he     -- -- connecting with Grimwood's mid-section, sending him -- straight through the wall into the next room
King holsters one of his pistols and hauls Blade up
At the same time, he  on Asher again, missing him -- Let's , kemosabe
King drags Blade to the door -- -  - -- into the neighboring corridor
Cumberland and Hale them
They reach for their weapons -- He's getting away
King  into the room behind him, then pulls a secured to a bandolier and tosses it through the doorway -- An  rocks the interrogation room, filling the corridor with smoke, knocking Cumberland and Hale back
King turns his attention to Blade's handcuffs,  between them, freeing Blade's hands
Blade collapses against the wall
He's shaking, close to passing out
Don't die on me, you undead motherfucker
King drags Blade up
They continue down the corridor to -- , we met earlier
She's engaged in hand-to-hand combat with a half-dozen
Three of them are already down
In seconds, she finishes off the other three
Whistler
We need that serum
Whistler
Abigail spins, dispatching the last officer with a kick to the mid-section while tossing a   at King
He snatches it, places it in Blade's hands
Blade injects himself in the neck
Moments later, he's reenergized
He looks to King, clear-eyed
Hey Blacula, you ready to shake and bake
Blade responds by  King across the jaw
Call me that again and 'll give you fucking brain damage
King massages his jaw, tossing Blade a pistol even as -- --	Grimwood rounds the corner, hungry for blood, behind him
Blade  round after round of  , causing Grimwood and the others to fall back
Blade and King move, joining Abigail
, darkness, only the emergency lights to illuminate the station
, a group of  spill from a stairwell, armed with bullet proof vests
They   -- Blade, King, and Abigail retreat into an alcove
They're pinned down between the vampires and a group of policemen
We're pinned down
(to Blade) Can't you do something
can't shoot around corners

As King and Blade lay down  , Abigail reaches behind her, withdrawing a device that's been secured there
She gives it a  and it springs open, taking the shape of a -- Crafted from aluminum, its limbs imbedded in key positions with vibration-dampening modules, this bow is capable of firing an arrow upwards of 300 feet-per-second
Abigail withdraws a   with a time-delay explosive tip from her quiver, nocks it in her bow and takes aim at -- mounted at the end of the corridor
She lets her arrow fly -- as it banks off the side of the fire extinguisher, continuing down the side corridor where it embeds itself in -- -- the shoulder of one of the vampires

Grimwood ducks away from the blast as the other two vampires  -- , , come racing out of the alcove
They reach a stairwell
Blade a steel door clear off its hinges, tossing it down the stairwell at a phalanx of   who are charging up the stairs
The cops go down like ten-pins
Blade and company have an opening
But as they charge downward -- (as King and Abigail freeze) My sword
They still have it
(apoplectic) Are you insane
We're practically home free
We can't go hunting for your fucking butter-knife now
But Blade is already heading back the way they came and -- Hey
This is supposed to be a rescue
-- Abigail grabs King's shoulder, pulling him to the stairs
Forget it, King
Let's move
- King and Abigail rush outside
The station is gated are surging through the mouth of the gate
They're trapped
Then -- window on the third floor of the station
Blade drops three stories, landing before King and Abigail in a cat-like crouch
With his sword in his hand
He looks at King, grins, flips him off
Now we can go
(nudging Abigail) Is he epic or what
The police close in around them, pinning the trio down with Yet King and Abigail seem unconcerned because -- are washing over them
beefed-up, 70s Land Cruiser is up the street
The Cruiser jumps onto the sidewalk, right through the gated wall
to a stop between our trio and the police cars
() leans out his window, gives a little wave as the rear doors pop open
Gruff and compact, he looks like a prize-fighter
My name is Dex
And 'll be saving your ass this evening
Blade, King, and Abigail scramble into the back of the Land Cruiser
Dex reverses, backing out the way he came
The police from the squad cars are , but the Land Cruiser is armored and the bullets harmlessly  off
- In the backseat, Abigail looks through the rear windshield -- ' Grimwood is running after them, actually gaining on the Land Cruiser
Chewing up the asphalt like a cheetah
- Abigail leans out the rear window, nocking a non- arrow in her bow
She takes aim at Grimwood, lets the arrow fly -- The arrow sinks into Grimwood's eye
He goes down, his somersaulting figure quickly receding into the background as the Land Cruiser speeds away
- Safe for the moment, King basks in the adrenaline rush of a battle well fought
Meanwhile, Dex is on a cell phone
We have him
We'll be there soon
(to Blade) So my entrance back there -- what do you think
Too flashy
Right on the money
King unhuckles his combat harness, revealing a bullet-proof vest bereath it that's been riddled with imbedded slugs
Who are you people
My name's Hannibal King
'm a hunter, like you
(re: Abigail) And this little hellion is Abigail Whistler
Abigail just stares back at Blade, silently appraising him
That's right, Blade
You're not hearing things
She's Whistler's daughter
You see, Abby, Dex, myself -- we're all part of Whistler's "contingency plan"
King reaches into an inner pocket, pulls out a pack of gum
He selects a stick, offers one to Blade
Juicyfruit
- The Land Cruiser rockets away, disappearing into the night
- The Land Cruiser moves across an abandoned lot towards the weed-choked ruins of an old amusement park
We pass by the skeletal remains of a roller-coaster, a tilt-a-whirl, the vandalized and wood-rotted remnants of a carousel
Finally, the Land Cruiser turns towards a motorized loading door in the side of a large warehouse and disappears inside
/ - As the door grinds closed, the Land Cruiser stops
King and Abigail lead Blade through the darkness
In the gloom we see a half-dozen vehicles in various stages of being retrofitted with armored panels and weaponry, etc mounted above track their progress
thought the vampires murdered Whistler's family
They did
'm the product of an earlier fling of my Dad's, born out of wedlock
After the murders happened, he kept me hidden
He wanted me safe
Away from all of this -- (gesturing around them) -- but  guess hunting just runs in our blood
As King and Abigail lead Blade towards a stairway, Blade catches sight of -- (5) peering down at him from atop one of the rafters
As soon as he spots her, she ducks into the shadows
They reach the stairway

When  came of age,  tracked my Dad down, told him  wanted in
(beat, shrugging) Been doing it ever since
- We enter a sprawling industrial facility that is equal parts mechanics shop, firing range, and laboratory
We glimpse a virtual arsenal of new weaponry and medical equipment, including  sequencers, microfuges, and electroporaters
The new equipment fights for space alongside the old - mountains of mothballed parts from the park's broken thrill rides
Here and there we see the oversized fiberglass head of a grinning fun-house creature or the mildewed torso of a fortune-telling mannequin, frozen in its upended booth
Welcome to the honeycomb hideout
(looking around) How do you bankroll this place
Internet porn
See, we're using cock suckers to pay for the blood-suckers
(off Blade's look) Joke
Come on, man
This isn't some piddly little hoopty-ass operation, Blade
We take our jobs very seriously
, pause in their work as King approaches
Dex falls in behind them
(20s) is an engineer, always lost in his own world
(30s) is a frail-looking geneticist
She's also blind, operating her computers via a voice-synthesis program and Braille keyboard
You met Dex
This is Hedges, Sommerfield-- King gestures to them in turn
They're all refugees in one way or another, sharing a common guardedness, their lives having been shattered by the vampires
(nodding back) The runt you saw earlier is Sommerfield's daughter, Zoe
We call ourselves the Nightstalkers
You sound like rejects from a Saturday morning cartoon
We were gonna call ourselves the Super Friends, but that was taken
Abigail rids herself of her weapons -- bow, arrows, silver stakes and knives
She hands her compound bow to Hedges
Tiller needs adjustment
'll run it through the bow press
Blade examines some of the equipment being developed
How many of you are there total
Enough
We operate in sleeper cells
When one goes down, a new cell activates to pick up the slack
Consider us your reinforcements
Sorry
Never been much of a team player
don't think you understand, Blade
Whistler meant for us to help you
When he died, he activated an emergency protocol
All his knowledge -- She gestures to the computer equipment around her
--was transferred to our servers here
And what makes you think you know so much about killing vampires
King reaches for his collar, pulling it down to reveal a telltale mass of scar tissue in the shape of a
Well for starters,  used to be one

As we isolate a penthouse apartment atop one of them we hear an
(
) Fucking Hannibal King

Danica slams her fist straight through the wall, then spins around, enraged
Asher and Grimwood are there too, their wounds being treated by Hendrix and a
At tie moment, they're trying to remove the arrow protruding from Grimwood's eye
An enormous  sits nearby, attentively watching flinch with every act of violence
Danica is strong
Clearly, no one wants to get in her way
should've ripped his ripped his bleeding heart out when  had the chance
(pointing at Asher) And don't you dare tell me " told you so"
Asher raises his hands as if to say "no harm, no foul"
Danica continues her tantrum,  a statue apart, a heavy glass tabletop
Finally, she gives it a rest, collapsing into a chair, shoulders sagging
You through remodeling
Blow me
Face it, Dan
We got caught with our pants down
We underestimated the Nightstalkers
Pants down
They practically fucking ass-raped us
Grimwood  in pain as the arrow is removed
Asher broaches a more serious subject
Has he been told yet
(
) About your failure
(30s) enters the room
The same being we glimpsed in the vault
He has a haunting gaze and a commanding presence
We will learn who he is momentarily
But for now, it's enough to know that everyone in the room pays him deference
Yes, 've been told
He places a hand on Danica's shoulder
She tenses
Perhaps it's time  entered the fray
: - King buttoning his collar back up
Blade, Abigail, and Sommerfield are gathered around him
You know the kind of woman that just screams trouble
You see her and every warning bell in your brain starts going off but you still ask for her number
Well that's all  ever hook up with
But this betty blew 'em all away in the shitstorm sweepstakes
King reaches out to a keyboard, calling up a piece of surveillance footage on a nearby monitor
The footage features Asher and Danica and Grimwood
It's been slowed to a near standstill and now advances frame by frame
Her name's Danica Talos
You met her earlier
The man on her left is Asher, her brother
King types a command
The image  , tracking Grimwood
The neanderthal behind them is Jarko Grimwood
King freezes the footage on Danica's grainy, pixelated face
picked Danica up in a bar, had a one night stand with her -- then spent the next five years playing step-and-fetch-it as her little vampire cabana boy
(beat) Eventually Abigail found me
Sommerfield here managed to treat me with a cure
Now kill them
(beat) That's called turning a frown upside down
We need to pool our resources, Blade
Why
Because He's come back
King tosses a    comic book over to Blade
Blade glances at the cover, then looks at them, incredulous
You gotta be kidding me
He's real, Blade
Dig beneath all the movies and myths
All the layers of bullshit that've cluttered our culture for the last five hundred years and eventually you'll strike the truth
(incredulous) So the movies are true
(shaking his head) The movies are just a comforting fairytale compared to the real deal
There's no happy ending with this guy
Peter Cushing isn't going to run in at the last second and save the day with a cross and some holy water
(re: the comicbook) See, good old Brain Stoker, he wrote a nice yarn
But the events he described in 1897 were only a tiny piece of the mosaic
The rea1 Dracula's origin goes back much earlier than that
How early

Goth Guy looks up, wiping his mouth with a napkin

Uh, yeah -- look around, we might have a few things
He and the Goth Vixen have a snicker at Drake's expense
Then she tries to be a little more helpful
We've got Dracula lunchboxes
Did you see those
And there're bobbleheads, Pez dispensers
We've got just about anything -- (selecting a vampire- shaped vibrator, playful) -- even vampire vibrators
As Drake looks around, what he sees matches his ascending rage
Costumes, candles, vampire Christmas ornaments
Posters from different films -- Nosferatu, Lugosi, Lee -- then Love at First Bite and The Little Vampire

The label reads: "-" and has a stylized vampire on it
"Dracola"
Makes you want to cry, doesn't it
Drake just stares at the can
His mind seems to have retreated elsewhere
Back through the ages
Was there something special you needed
Drake doesn't respond
kind of melancholy has settled over him
He's an outsider now
The world has moved on

She's still cautious and shy, but she's also curious
Why wake up Drake now
That's what we've been trying to figure out
When  was under the fang there used to be talk about some kind of vampire 'Final Solution'
But  could never figure out why they'd want to destroy their food source
mean, seems stupid, right
They've always had plans for the human race
Seems likely that whatever they're cooking up, Drake's return is a part of it
Blade nods, pensive
(') Let's face it, Blade -- we're fighting a losing battle
So we kill a few hundred of them a year
Big deal
There are thousands of them out there
Maybe tens of th'usands
We need a new tactic
Like what

Sommerfield moves to her Braille keyboard, types

We're calling it DayStar
Think about it, Blade
We could wipe them all out in a single move
So what's been holding you back
(sighing) We've tried it on a number of captive subjects
We've got the disease vector worked out fine -- it's easily transmittable
But the lethality in vampires is still spotty
Bottom line is, we need a better sample to work with
(beat) We need Dracula's blood
Vampire  is a hodge-podge of different genes, mixed in with all sorts of useless junk
Because Dracula's the progenitor of the vampire race, his  is still pure
It hasn't been diluted by a hundred generations of selective mutation
It still has all the necessary cellular compounds for the virus to code to

Drake opens his eyes,  Danica hovering in the darkness, just on the edge of a shaft of light
This world sickens me
The humans have soiled it with their filth
We can raze their cities to the ground
We can bring the old world back
Drake just stares at her, not convinced
Come closer
(re: light) can't
And do you know why
(off Danica's silence) Once, all of my kind could brave the day
We were true predators
The world was ours
And then, somewhere along the way, the purity of our bloodline became diluted
Polluted with human
That's impossible -- Is it
Drake stands, drawing close to Danica
He grips her wrist -- You are bastard children
No longer as pure as you pride yourselves on being
-- and pulls her hand towards one of the sunlight shafts
To her credit, Danica keeps staring at Drake
She'll be damned if she will give him the satisfaction of seeing her break
Drake pulls her hand closer to the light -- to the very edge
And the tips of Danica's fingers begin to burn
She winces, clearly in agony -- -- and Drake releases her hand
She cradles it against her chest, blinking away tears that have welled up in her eyes
My people
How far you have fallen
Drake reaches out, brushes a tear from Danica's cheek, then turns and walks away -- through the alternating shafts of sunlight and darkness

Fires a three-shot burst in 1/500th of a second
Bullets can also be triggered remotely
King tosses Blade a bullet
He studies it -- it's more complex than a standard round
Explosive rounds
But with a concentrated burst of  light instead of your standard hollow-points call 'em sun dogs
(to Hedges) Hedges -- super-size me, baby
Hedges tosses King one of the four-barreled firearms
On the stock is an irreverent decal of the mud-flap girl silhouette
This little mamacita -- a modified version of the Army's Objective Individual Combat Weapon
Pick your poison -- stakes, sun dogs, heat-seeking mini-rockets
Whatever gets you hard, this puppy will pump out
(gesturing to Blade's sword, sarcastic) Of course it doesn't have the range of a sword but -- Next, Hedges shows Blade the -  that Abigail used
He gives the device a twist and -- We call this the  arc -- The device extends from either end, telescoping outward
Connecting the tips is a concentrated
You hold the arc in the center, curved away from you
Connecting the tips is a powerful  laser beam
Because of its high focus, the laser cuts through vampire flesh like a knife through butter
We're still trying to sort out fact from fiction when it comes to Dracula
Turning into mist
Kinda doubt it
But general shape-shifting
Maybe
(off Blade's look) Not into a bat or a wolf or anything like that
But another human, someone with the same approximate body mass -- given enough practice it might be possible
How
He wouldn't have a traditional skeletal structure
Probably something more like a snake, with thousands of tiny bones in the place of a normal array
Commensurate with this would be an exquisite control of electrical potential across his tissues, resulting in an ability to effectively change shape at will -- (raising his hand) Question

Time to apply some pressure

She's making playlists
Likes to listen to MP3s when she hunts
Her own internal soundtrack, you know
Dark-core, trip hop, whatever kids these days are listening to

Finished, Abigail slips her earbuds into her ears, turns on her portable MP3 player

In each new location, Blade, King, and Abigail resort to oldfashioned strong-arm tactics: -- Blade - a familiar
-- King  a familiar across the jaw
-- Abigail  a familiar in the stomach
Cut to a flurry of  - of   being exposed on the backs of familiar's necks, one after another -- as familiars have their heads cainfully  against -- -- walls -- -- car hoods -- -- pool tables -- -- into windows and doors and garbage cans
The bullying moves come faster, the shots becoming more and more abstract until -- - --
Blade tosses , a skinny familiar, off a roof
It's a four story drop
Hoop falls,  -- but then jerks to a stop about twenty feet down, dangling upside down
We see now that Hoop has rope tied around one of Hoop's ankles
And Blade is clutching the other end of the rope
Blade hauls Hoop back up -- but still keeps him dangling upside down
King and Abigail look on
Want another spin, ass-hole
Eventually, your head's gonna pop off
Shit
Oh Jesus, please, please -- Who's your handler

As Blade walks off -- (') Hey, they can't all be gems

His throat has been ripped out
And this body is dressed like a doctor
King puts it together first, reaching for a silver stake even as we hear the sound of   coming from beneath the Vance double's flesh -- Jesus, it's him

She spins, falling -- -- and Drake is moving like a hurricane,  through the window that was shattered by Blade's shotgun blast

He looks out the window,  Drake landing on the ground, some three stories below
-   -  - Drake runs with inhuman speed
He effortlessly scales a chain link fence, then  straight through a wooden barricade, sailing over a trash dumpster
Seconds later, Blade follows, catching sight of Drake rushing out into -- -  - -- a crowded urban market
What unfolds is a foot-chase at super-human velocity
Vampire and hunter are moving at least twenty miles an hour,   various pedestrians, through and over stalls of merchandise
- Drake emerges onto the sidewalk of a busy street, four lanes of rush-hour traffic
Abruptly, Drake cuts into the traffic,  atop the hood of an oncoming car
The car's  sounds, brakes
, jumping onto the hood of another car
More sound
In this manner
Drake and Blade race across the flowing traffic itself
using the hoods and roofs of the cars like moving stepping stones
Drake mounts the steps of an older apartment building, his way through the main entrance -- - / - Blade is on Drake like a shadow
We're internal now, the sound of Blade's   moving to the foreground of the soundscape

Another story, a third, a fourth
As he reaches the top, Blade jumps, catching the edge of the roof above him -- -  - --  himself over and onto the roof
He lands in a cat stance, drawing his sword, quickly scanning the area
(
) So you're the hunter they all fear
Blade spins -- stands on the ledge of the roof, cradling an  in his arms
In the full glare of the afternoon sun
(re: infant) Just so we understand each other, Daywalker
With his free hand, he massages his jaw
We hear a few more Pieces of   as the very last of Drake's cermanent features seem to settee into clace
Why did you kill Vance
He'd outlived his purpose
He'd become a liabi1ity
Drake nods at Blade's sword -- Your sword -- 've seen that hilt before
Eight or nine centuries ago
The hunter who carried it was an accomplished fighter

Drake tears the sword from the hunter's grasp, turns it around, thrusts it back through the man's chest
And as the man  we are -- -  -  ( ) -- back to here and now
He was honorable, in his own way
He died a good death
wouldn't know about that
You lie
You're part of a grand tradition, Blade
You hunters have plagued my people since the day we first walked the earth
And  have vanquished them
One by one
Blade pauses, looking for some kind of opening
How can you exist in the daylight
've always been able to
Haven't you read Mr
Stoker's fable
was the first of the vampires
am unique
(realizing) That's why they brought you back
Yes
My children seek to isolate the properties in my blood that make me immune to sunlight
Through me, they believe they can all become Daywalkers
Drake glances down at the street people
Throngs of are massing there, pointing up at him
The world's changed much since  went to sleep
How crowded it's become
Look at them down there
Lives brief as fireflies
Do you think they can ever grasp what it means to be immortal like us
You're not immortal
must've heard a hundred of you people make the same claim
And every one of them's seen the end of my sword
Drake smiles, intrigued by an obviously worthy opponent
Perhaps  will as well, then
But  think it's more likely that you will fall before mine
(beat) Catch
Drake tosses the infant at Blade
Blade twists around to catch it, scooping it safely up
But when he looks back -- -- Drake is gone
(
) Shit
- '  - King being propped up against the wall by Abigail
Blade has joined them
King is in terrible pain
Jesus, it hurts
wanna be a vampire again -- fuck
Did you see that guy
We're gonna lose, man
We're gonna fucking lose
Abigail ignores King, cuts open his shirt
She removes a small aerosol cannister from her belt
What's that
Fibrin sealant foam, it's an elastic protein
Help me spread the wound open
The foam should seal the hemorrhaging in his body cavity from within -- Together they spread the wound apart
King is really hurting, breathing hard as he tries to fight back the pain
Hey, hey -- what'd the one lesbian vampire say to the other
Shut up, King
-- see you in twenty-eight days -- King's voice trails off as he passes out
Abigail triggers the dispenser, spraying a jet of compressed foam into it
The foam condenses, sealing the wound up
- Blade and Abigail enter the , hauling King between them
Dex and Hedges rush to meet them, relieving them of King
Exhausted and covered in blood, Abigail retires to her quarters, stripping off her clothes
'  -  - Abigail stands beneath (he showerhead, turning her face up into the scalding spray, rinsing the blood from her body
the drain by her feet,  swirling down it
-  - King drowses on a cot
His shirt is off and his chest has been bandaged
He opens his eyes,  Blade above him
Hey, Blade -- say we're successful
Say we wipe the vampires out
What happens then
You ever ask yourself that
(weakly) Somehow  don't picture you parked on a porch with a jigsaw puzzle
King drifts back into unconsciousness again, leaving Blade left to ponder his words
-   - Later, Sommerfield and Hedges consult with Blade and Abigail
So basically we're in an arms race
They're using Drake's  to build themselves a better vampire -- (noddin) -- and we need his blood to kill them
(to Sommerfield) How's this weapon of yours coming along
We're almost there -- She gestures to a series of ampule-like prototypes
(We'll see the completed version of this device later on
) The virus is harmless to humans
So we decided to go after the vampires' food source
The one thing we know for sure about vampires is that they have to drink blood
If we manage to pull this off, we'll be able to contaminate every blood source on the planet
They won't have anyone left to feed on
Doesn't do us any good if we don't have time to finish it
We can't just sit here
We need to take the battle to them
Sommerfield lowers her head, thinking
If the vampires are trying to isolate the hereditary factor in Drake that makes him immune to sunlight, they'll require certain kinds of laboratory equipment and provisions
For instance, there's an enzyme called Taq Polymerase
And there are only a limited number of suppliers
(beat) Give me a few hours
'll see if  can't hunt us up some leads
: -  - Moving towards the mirrored windows we hear
- '  - hands clasped together -- a man and a woman's
Danica' s face, covered in sweat, in the throes of passion
She looks up, eyes glazed -- to reveal Drake, propped above her, thrusting away
Danica has her limbs wrapped around Drake, holding on for dear life
Both are awash in moonlight
The two of them climax
Drake withdraws, studying Danica
She's naked but for the tiny silver crucifix she wears around her neck
Drake nudges the crucifix with his finger
Why do you wear that -- symbol
(defensive) Old habits -- She sits up, draping a sheet over her

Drake nods, his thoughts distant

He died -- for their sins, not mine
(playful1y) And what are your sins
Would you care to confess them
(shaking his head) Too numerous to remember
(nodding at the crucifix) Take it off
Why
'll make you a better one
Drake draws her in, biting her gently on the neck, sinking his fangs into her flesh
He pulls his head back
Two rivulets of  trickle from the fresh wounds
There's an old saying -- Drake reaches for the sheet, pulling it away from Danica's chest
Then he dips his fingertips into her flowing blood - a long streak of it down between her breasts
Kill one man, you're a murderer
Kill a million, a king
(smiling) Kill them all, a God

to reveal Blade injecting himself with his serum
No pain
No violent spasms like before
Blade's body now accepts the serum

Why do you do that

This keeps it from getting out
Zee considers this

They've been buying up all sorts of supplies -- Taq polymerase, bone marrow growth supplement, genetic sequencing enzymes
We'll check it out

-  - Hendrix, the vampire doctor we saw earlier, sits at a computer workstation
Chief Vreede confers with him
We hear a at the door
Hendrix looks to Vreede
They obviously weren't expecting anyone
Hendrix moves to the door, checking a surveillance monitor
He can't see anyone outside
He shrugs, turns to leave and -- The door is  inward, taking much of the door frame with it, flattening Hendrix
Blade and Abigail step inside
As Blade hauls Hendrix up from the ground, Abigail points her already drawn gun at -- He was reaching into his jacket for his own piece, now thinks better of it
Doing a little moonlighting, Chief
Blade nods to Abigail
She reaches onto Vreede's jacket to disarm him
Blade grips Hendrix by the shirt collar

We need to talk
Blade  Hendrix in the face
Hendrix sags for a moment, stunned
Now spill it, bite-boy
(wiping a bloody nose) You know what we're doing
Drake has come back to us
Soon we'll all be Daywalkers
And when that day comes, the world will truly be ours
Blade nods towards the back of the lab where another door -- a very secure one -- is located
What's back there
Hendrix shoots a quick look to Vreede
Then he turns on Blade, all fangs and claws, trying to tear Blade's eyes out -- Abigail  her  gun with blinding speed and -- -- Hendrix is dead before he knows it
all over Blade
Blade brushes Hendrix' s remains from coat collar, shoots Abigail a look:  "Did you really have to do that
" (dryly) Thanks
Abigail cringes
Mea culpa
Blade looks to the floor
Aside from some cinders, all that remains of Hendrix are his glasses and a singed keycard
Blade picks up the keycard, looks to Vreede
What's behind Door Number One
They'll kill me -- (an evil grin) So will
But 'll enjoy it more
Vreede nods
They move towards the door
Blade slides the security card
An inset light changes from  to
Vreede punches in a numeric code
The doors slide open -- -   - Blade, Abigail, and Vreede emerge into a cavernous room
God in Heaven -- hang from gantries, preserved in fluid-filled pods, suspended by wires like nightmarish marionettes
The bodies are hooked up to an elaborate system of biosensor feeds and IVs which are designed to replenish vital nutrients
What was this place
Vreede pauses before answering, looking uncomfortable
It's a blood farming facility
(elaborating) They decided that hunting humans on a piece-meal basis was too inefficient
Why kill your prey when you can keep them alive
Productive
Under optimal conditions a donor can generate anywhere from fifty to a hundred pints of blood a year
(sickened) But where did you get all these people
The streets
In any given year you've got two to three million homeless people wandering around America -- (shrugging) No one cares about them
We're doing the country a service, really
Blade shakes his head, admiring the horrible efficiency
The vampire Final Solution
Abigail moves towards one of the pods, touching her hand to the glass, studyihg the comatose person within
Are they aware
Do they feel anything
(shaking his head) They're in a chemical-induced coma
They're brain-dead, vegetables
Blade angrily  Vreede's face against one of the pods
Look at this
Is this the future you want
You think there's a place for you in their world
Vreede starts crying, blubbering
We don't have a choice
They're going to win, don't you see that
He's come back
There's nothing stopping them now
Blade pulls Vreede back so they're nose to nose -- There's me
-- and Blade releases Vreede
Go
You've got thirty seconds
Vreede turns and runs, stumbling towards the door
Despite his promise, Blade lifts his
Without even looking in Vreede's direction, Blade
We hear Vreede drop
Blade turns to Abigail
She can hardly contain herself
Nearby is a control console
Blade  his  pistol into it, damaging the interlinked life support systems

She considers the lockers, discounts them
Then settles on -- near the floor
It's about fourteen inches wide -- just barely big enough for her to squeeze into
Zoe kneels, prying the grate off
Inside, a heating duct extends four feet before making a ninety-degree turn upward
Zoe climbs into the duct feet first, scooting her body backwards
Then she reaches for the grate, securing it back on, sealing herself inside

It's cramped and claustrophobic inside the duct
She's managed to force herself all the way back to the ninety degree turn by curling up into a near fetal position

King tries to twist his head away from the dog
The rottweiler
Back off, pooch -- The rottweiler's jaws open, revealing more teeth than any dog should probably have
Its muzzle splits in two as both sides of the rottweiler mandible fold back on either side of its head, disgorging a hellish and barbed tongue stalk
The mutant dog , ready to bite King's face off and -- Jesus Christ

His name's Beau
We've been experimenting with porting the vampire gene over into other species
As Asher pets the rottweiler, its muzzle closes back up again
It looks up at him, panting happily, tongue lolling
You made a goddamn vampire dog
Yeah
Cool, huh
Poor little King
You look so distraught
Danica wipes a little blood from the corner of King's mouth
She touches her fingertips to her tongue, tasting his blood
You're tasting a little bland, lover
Not getting enough fatty acids in your diet

How about you take a sugar-frosted fuck off the end of my dick
Oh, there'll be time to play doctor later, believe me
But for now, we need to have a little talk

Grimwood steps forward, throttling King for a moment
Spit it out, you fucking fruitcake
Okay, here's the deal with the weapon - (coughing) It's a new flavor crystal formula
Twice the chocolaty-goodness, half the calories
Plus, it helps prevent tooth decay -- Grimwood moves in to choke him again, but Danica intervenes
You're brave, King, 'll give you that
But underneath all your swagger -- She leans closer, caressing his face
--  know what you really fear
What would hurt you more than anything else
King's smile falters for a moment
Maybe she does know
She rubs her cheek against his
You don't want to go back to being one of us -- (her lips grazing his) -- do you
King tries to turn his head away, but Danica grips his chin, turning his head back
He's sweating now
Worried
'm going to bite you again, King
And then 'm going to leave you here while you turn
'm going to watch you, day after day, while the Thirst keeps building and building
And then, when you can't stand it anymore -- She nods
Drake appears, holding Zoe
She's alive
Terrified
Held firm in Drake's arms
-- 'm going to bring the little girl for you to feed on
Would you like that, King
Would you enjoy taking her life
King shuts his eyes, sickened at the thought
Danica smiles
Now we're getting somewhere, my pet
: '  -   - Abigail sits in her workshop area, restringing one of her bows
Nearby is a table with an assortment of equipment -- a bow press, vise stand, string jig, bow scales and wrench sets
Across the way is a shooting range with a variety of targets set up, a wall of netting behind them to catch stray arrows
There's also a chronograph outfitted with a ballistic computer to measure arrow speed
Abigail's hands as she works with a quiet precsion, re-setting the arrow rest, making minor adjustments to the center-shot position and wheel timing, etc
appears in the doorway, watching her
You alright
(brusque) 'll be fine
Blade nods
He's going to leave her alone -- but then he hesitates, wrestling to say something
Don't let it turn inward
Abigail takes a deep breath, pausing in her work
It already has
Since  can remember 've had this knife of sadness in my heart
As long as it stays there, 'm strong
'm untouchable
But the moment pull it out -- (turning back to him) -- 'll die
Blade nods
He understands all too well
He leaves
She stands, moving to the shooting range
She straps on a quiver, takes aim at 3- - about a hundred feet away
Just in front of the target is the chronograph, which looks like a miniature set of goal posts
Abigail  an arrow
It flies through the arms of the chronograph, sinking into the targets s chest
On the screen of the ballistic computer, the arrow's speed is clocked at 240 feet per second
We move  to her now as-- Abicail  again
The speed is 242 fps
-- Now the speed is 269 fps
-- 285 fps
302 fps
315 fps
The arrow speed creeps up and up as we move    to Abigail until we -- --
Abigail has fired every arrow in her quiver
The arrows have formed a cross in the target's chest
One vertical grouping running up, another horizontal grouping bisecting it
-  - Blade stands at the open entrance
Abigail steps out
Looks like she's made peace with herself for the moment
'm ready to go
appear in the distance
Another Land Cruiser approaches, weaving through the amusement park
It pulls to a stop in front of them
The driver's side window rolls down
() sits behind the wheel
He raises a hand in greeting
My name is Caulder
And 'll be your driver this evening
'   - Caulder's Land Cruiser glides through the streets
Where are you taking us
Another safehouse
We told you, Blade
We operate in sleeper cells
When one goes down, a new cell activates to pick up the slack
-   - Caulder pulls up in front of a fish supply store
-   - Caulder unlocks an accordion security gate, opens the door
He leads Blade and Abigail through the darkened aisles
There are fish tanks on either side, aerators , aquatic animals of every kind swimming about
is another arsenal/lab area
This one is smaller than the Nightstalkers' main headquarters
Caulder moves to a computer, calls up a file
dialogue box for a media player opens
Caulder activates a video file
Sommerfield left a video message for you
The video plays
We see Sommerfield's face on the screen
She looks grave, as if she might have been crying
(on video) If you're watching this, 'm already dead
If Zoe's still alive,  want you to promise you'll take care of her
've been reading her The Oz books every night
We just started The Emerald City of Oz, the one with the Nome King -- Her voice cracks and she pauses, wiping away a tear
think 've managed to cultivate a workable strain of the Daystar virus
As a precaution,  transmitted the genetic sequence to Caulder, in case our main stock was destroyed
In order for it to achieve maximum lethality, you'll need to interfuse it with Drake's blood
If it works, any vampires in the immediate vicinity should die almost instantly
After that, it should take only a few weeks for the virus to spread throughout the rest of the world
Zoe hesitates, deciding how to broach the next subject
There's one other thing, Blade
You need to know that there's a chance the virus could destroy you too
Because you're a hybrid, 'm not sure whether your immune system will be able tolerate it
(beat) 'm sorry
We didn't have enough time to properly test it
The video cuts to
Abigail turns off the monitor, looking to Blade
God only knows what he's thinking
Take a look at the plague arrow
Caulder reaches for a refrigerated aluminum case, snapping it open
Inside, resting on a bed of form-fitting foam, is a glass ampule that's been fitted into a stake-like contraption
It looks like the head of a high-tech harpoon
only had time to fabricate a small batch of Daystar
outfitted it with a compressed gas projectile, so you should be able to fire it from one of the fourbarrel rifles or a bow
(beat) Just make sure the shot counts, cause we don't have enough for a second try
Abigail sits before a laptop, creating another custom MP3 playlist
We watch as she hi-lights songs with her mouse, moves them over to her portable device with a few
Abigail unhooks her MP3 device, slips her earbud headphones into her ears
The  of Fluke's track Atom Bomb fade up, gradually shifting from tinny source music to
Blade and Abigail suit up, arming themselves
We : Blade loading rounds into his pistols
Abigail selecting arrows, checking the range-dials
Blade sliding silver stakes into his bandoliers
Abigail working with Caulder, affixing the plague capsule to one of her arrowheads
Blade polishes his sword
Finished, he sights down the length of it, takes a practice swing, then secures it in his back scabbard with a flourish
-   -   - We hear the  of two motorcycles
Blade emerges from the alley astride his signature Ducati ST2 crotch-rocket
Abigail appears a moment later on her own customized bike
Blade revs his engine
Then the two bikes take off
: - '  - Drake sits before Zoe, who has been shackled to the wall, his right arm encased in one of the armored gauntlets from his burial armor
The rest of the armor has been propped up on a stand nearby
Do you know who  am
You're the Nome King
Drake smiles at this
The Nome King
like that
(leaning closer) Tell me, child
Do you want to die
Zoe is terrified but tries to remain defiant
'm not afraid -- 'll go to Heaven
There is no Heaven
No God
No angels
No happy ending for good little girls
The only thing you have to look forward to is nothingness
As Drake talks his pupils seem to widen -- until the darkness nearly occludes the whites of his eyes
Zoe stares at him
Can't tear her gaze away
His eyes are hypnotic
But what if you could change that
What if you could remain a child forever
He reaches out, running a sharp fingernail over her cheek
What if you could keep this little doll- like face of yours until the sun itself cooled to a cold, hard rock
(beat) Wouldn't you like that
Wouldn't you accept that gift
Zoe reaches out, calmly touches Drake's cheek
My friends are coming to kill you
-  - Grimwood  King, whose body sags, weakened from the beatings he has undergone
Asher and Danica look on
-- gonna be sorry you did that -- Nobody's coming for you, King
Sure they are
Left a trail of digital bread crumbs -- Excuse me
One thing you need to know about us Nightstalkers
When you join our club, you get this nifty little tracking node surgically implanted in your body -- Bullshit
Scout's honor
One of us gets lost, the others just dial up the satellite and presto, instant cavalry
Grimwood looks to Asher and Danica, unsure
He's bluffing
(smiling, playing along) Okay, King, where did they put this tracking node of yours
He motions for her to draw closer, whispering
It's in my left ass-cheek -- Danica slaps King's face, making him see stars
Alright
alright, it's in my right ass- cheek -- Danica slaps King again, this time knocking his head the other way
He spits out blood -- No, seriously -- (gasping) -- it's in the meat of my butt, right below my Bart Simpson tattoo -- Danica  King's mid-section
He sucks air
Despite his attempts at humor, he's hurting now
His body sags -- -- pull down my tighty-whities -- see for yourself
It's not funny anymore
Behind Danica, Grimwood and Asher both
King lifts his bruised face, staring up at Danica through blood-shrouded eyes
For the first time, we get a sense of his true hatred for her
No, it's not, you horse-humping bitch -- (wincing as he breathes) -- but it will be a few seconds from now
(coughing) And what happens then, lover
Hammer time
(beat) See, that tickle in your throat you're feeling right now
Danica  again, blinks repeatedly, as if her eyes were irritated
She rubs them, looks to the others
They're feeling the effects too
And Grimwood's face is smoking
That's atomized colloidal silver
Danica keys into the  of the air-conditioning system and a   beneath that
She looks up -- It's being pumped into the building's air conditioning system
We  , shrinking down until we see a blowing into the room
The particles are dusting the vampires, being unwittingly inhaled by them and -- ' as the vampires react en mass, suddenly gagging, their throats and faces on fire
Which means that the fat lady should be singing right about -- has caught the worst of it
whole lung-full
He  as He coughs up blue-tinged , the flesh on his face simultaneously burning away and -- -- as Blade crashes down
He lands in a cat-like stance, then flips over into a cartwheel,  Grimwood in the face
As Grimwood goes down, Asher and Danica scatter -- Blade tackles Grimwood, sending both of them over the railing into the lower level of the penthouse
-  - are ringing
Asher and Danica rush down the hall, trying not to breathe the silver-contaminated air
We other vampires staggering from doorways, ,
- '  - Drake hears the
He reaches for his sword, which rests in a nearby stand
As he heads out, he strides past Zoe, still chained to the wall
-  - On the lower level, Blade and Grimwood are going at it
flood in from multiple entry ways
It's an all-out melee
Blade is seriously overwhelmed, but the sheer number of vampires and humans is actually slowing them down
Blade takes on a half-dozen of them at once, stunning one of the familiars, using him as a human shield,  him aside to trip up another on-rushing pair
Then he pauses, instantly calculating the geography of the room, the relative positions of the other combatants, assessing decorations and furniture as possible weapons
His battle plan ready, Blade engages his enemies once again
, Abigail appears at the lip of the smashed-in skylight
She lowers herself down on a rope, rushes to King's side -- You alright
Nothing a hot tub full of Bactine won't fix
Abigail hits the release switch on the high-tech pillory and the cuffs around his wrists open
As Abigail helps King out: Zoe -- Drake's got her
Abigail nods, handing King her pistol
Then she's out the door
Seconds later, King follows -- -  -  - Abigail pauses, slipping her earbuds in, turning on her MP3 player
The bumping-strains of Fluke's Absurd track kick in
Abigail uncilps her  arc, telescopes it outward and -- -- suddenly it's like we're in a first-person shooter video game
She moves through the corridors with mathematical precision, feeling the  in her bones, slicing through every vampire she encounters with deadly efficiency
are coming out from every doorway
Abigail  one in the solar plexus,  another, finishes off the first
Then she's moving on, taking down a third, fourth, and fifth vampire with her rapid-fire stake dispenser
Throwing stakes with blinding speed
After a half-dozen stakes, her dispenser is empty
Without missing a beat, she presses a tab on the dispenser, ejects the clip, then reaches to her belt where a back-up is secured and slaps it in place
The mayhem continues
-  -   - Blade unsheathes his sword
He parries two combatants with clubs, then whirls around,  a  from a third with the flat of his sword
Grimwood is furious
His men are tripping all over themselves
He grabs an antique battle axe that's secured to the wall
He sees an opening,  at Blade's head -- -- Blade drops and the axe slices through one of Grimwood's own men
In an eye-blink, Blade is up again, advancing
He cuts down another familiar, pushes forward, cuts oown a second -- Now Blade and Grimwood are face to face
Grimwood swings his axe again
Blade hooks his sword beneath it,  it from Grimwood's hands
Blade sweeps his sword around in a wide arc,  straight through Grimwood's mid-section
The upper half of Grimwood's body topples away -- -- then he rights himself
half-vampire
He's still alive, running forward on his hands, trailing viscera
He at Blade, all claws and gnashing teeth
Blade catches Grimwood by the throat, whirls him around -- --  and manages to  what's left of Grimwood with his sword-point
Grimwood  in Blade's arms
The only thing left are his steel teeth, which  to the floor at Blade's feet
- '  - Abigail enters,  Zoe
stand nearby
In a flash, Abigail flings    at them
Both stakes hit their mark and the vamps crumple to
Abigail hurries over,  apart the lock on Zoe's shackle
Zoe wraps her arms around Abigail, hugging her tight
Abigail takes Zoe by the hand, pulling her towards the door
Come on, hon
Let's get you out of here
-  - King stumbles out into the hallway, pulling his shirt back on
As he limps down the corridor, a  makes him pause -- ' Beau, the vampire rottweiler, lopes around the corner
Then -- emerge behind Beau
They're all  now
(under his breath) Fuck
Me
Sideways
The three of them break,  like crazy, snouts splitting open as their jaws flower apart
T0: -  -   - Blade moves into the upper gallery of a vast atrium
stands before him, waiting, sword in hand
He extends it, touching the tip to the floor
challenge
Are you ready to die, Blade
Been ready since the day  was born, mother-fucker
(with a smile) Then allow me to accommodate you
Drake does a back-flip over the balcony
Forty feet down
Blade follows, drawing his sword as he  -- -  -   - -- and lands
Now the two warriors face each other, swords raised, eyes locked, their stances frozen
Like classic samurai
Whoever moves first, loses
Beat
on both men,  around them
Slow the heart
Slow the breath
Find the opening
breaks first, bringing his sword over in less time than it takes to blink an eye
No one could possibly deflect the blow
And yet -- manages a - with super-human grace
He advances, parries, his sword  and  like a blacksmith's hammer on sheet metal
Cut, thrust, block, diagonal downward slashes
The moves come faster
Drake , barely avoiding being decapitated
Blade's sword cuts right through a column instead
Drake retaliates
Blade locks swords with him
For a moment, the two warriors are nose to nose
Then Blade twists his sword free, cutting open Drake's cheek -- Drake , back-flipping up onto a ledge
He touches his fingertips to the cut, tastes his own blood
Then we hear the telltale sounds of
For a brief moment, his facial features shift, giving us yet another glimpse of his true form
As his anger increases, Drake begins to devolve
He  at Blade, , raking his  at Blade's face
He strikes out,  Blade across the atrium
He forward, dragging Blade up by his throat, sinking his fangs into Blade's shoulder
Blide  and we -- : -  - -- as King runs
He hazards a look back
The vampire dogs are quickly gaining on him
It's a dead-end
Just plate glass windows and a whole lot of nothing beyond
The dogs are almost on King when suddenly, King , snagging an overhead pipe
As he swings his body upward -- skid on the floor, unable to stop their momentum, and straight through the plate glass window
-  - An    as two of the vampire rottweilers tumble into the night
They fall like stones -- twenty stories down into the traffic-clogged intersection below
-  - King drops back to the floor, cackling, pleased with himself
It takes him a second to realize that -- () -- didn't take a swan dive out the window
He's right behind King
And now he's   -- King is hit in the chest by the  beast
He drops the pistol as he's knocked back onto the floor
The dog again -- With one arm, King struggles to keep his face from being bit off, while searching blindly for the discarded pistol
King locates it,  into the beast's chest -- , disintegrating all over King's face
King gets a mouthful of the charcoal remains, tries to  them out
(making a face) Bad dog
: -  -   - Abigail emerges onto the gallery with Zoe
She spots an alcove, indicates that Zoe should hide
Then she slips a silver stake into Zoe's hand
Just in case
Abigail rushes to the handrail, looking down at Blade and Drake
Her view is obscured
She can't get a good shot
-  -   - Drake digs his fangs into Blade's shoulder
Blade struggles, manages to slip a stake from his bandolier -- Blade  the stake into Drake's ear canal
The beast  in pain, dropping Blade
But all the gambit has done is drive Drake into a berserker rage
Drake swings his fist
Blade ducks
Drake's fist goes through the wall,  a steam pipe
Steam vents -- Drake reaches in,  an eight-foot section of the pipe from the wall, bringing a  nest of electrical cables along with it
He swings the pipe section around,  Blade
Drake swings the makeshift club again
He's a one man demolition crew, decimating everything in his path
He's holes in the floor, the walls, plowing through partitions of glass and steel
-  -   - Abigail moves down the gallery, looks up -- span the length of the atrium ceiling
Abigail balances on the handrail, then jumps out into space -- -- catching hold of one of the crosspieces
Like an acrobat, she monkey-swings her way beneath the gantry
If she loses her grip, she'll fall more than fifty feet
-
bullet strikes just in front of Abigail, showering her with
follow
from below, trying to pick her off
Suddenly, strike each of the vampires
As they  we -- -   , having dragged his battered body out onto the upper gallery
He's playing guardian angel to Abigail, laying down cover fire so she can continue
But then -- appears behind King
She  him, wrestling him to the floor, pummeling his face with her fist
King tries to ward of f the blows, but he's sorely outmatched
He swings his electronic pistol up -- Danica twists it from his grip, ejecting the clip from the stock
King's sun dog bullets spill out all over the floor
She tosses the gun aside, reaches for King again -- -   - Back to Abigail
She's breathing heavily, trying to call up new reserves of strength
She glances down -- Big mistake
She forces herself to look back up
She swings herself pendulum-style, manages to snag yet another crosspiece -- , down below, armed with a rifle
He  again -- -- grazing Abigail's shoulder with the bullet
Abigail , nearly losing her grip
-  -   - King rolls on his side, spits out a bloody tooth
No offense, Danica -- (gasping in pain) -- but 've wanted to kill you since the moment we slept together
was that bad, huh
King reaches a palsied hand for his discarded pistol, points it vaguely in Danica's direction
She
No bullets in your gun, King
Yeah, but here's the beauty -- (wiping his bloody mouth) -- these babies can be triggered remotely
King pulls the trigger
The scattered sun dog bullets with
Danica , trying to shield her already burning face from the glare
She runs, horribly wounded
-  -   - Drake pummels Blade, flinging his body about like a ragdoll
He grabs Blade by his ankle, swings him upwards some thirty feet -- Blade collides with the underside of a massive hanging glass chandelier/lighting fixture
Blade  back to the ground, stunned, dropping his sword
Drake pounces on him
Blade can barely fend off Drake's blows anymore
In desperation he digs his fingers into Drake's eyes
Drake swings both fists downward, Hulk-style,  an entire section of the limestone flooring
- ripples out from the point of impact, sending waves of two-foot stone tiles flipping up into the air, knocking Blade off his feet
-  -   - King loads a sun dog into his pistol, steadies his aim on the railing, and  at Asher -- screams across the atrium, striking dead-center in Asher's open mouth
The bullet
causes Asher's skull to burn up from the inside out
His headless corpse falls forward over the gallery railing
Then it too carbonizes and
Relieved, King sinks to his knees
, we  Zoe slip from the alcove
She makes for the stairs
-   - King has bought Abigail more time
She swings her body forward, hooking her legs over the next crosspiece
Then she lets go with her hands
Now she is hanging upside down, secured only by the tension in her calves
Abigail reaches behind her, removes her bow
from her wounded shoulder drips down over her collar bone, reaching her cheek, briefly obscuring her vision
She wipes it away
Then she reaches back once more and -- -- because her quiver is pointed downward, a number of arrows slide out
Abigail panics, twisting her body -- -- managing to lust barely snag the ~la~ue arrow as it tumbles Past her
Beat
Abigail shuts her eyes, trying to find her center
With her eyes closed, she nocks the arrow and draws the bow back
Then she opens her eyes
She's only going to get one shot -- and she's going to have to take it while hanging upside down
168 a       '                                       168 a On Drake and Blade below, locked in combat
She tracks their progress, waits for Drake to move into a better position -- -  -   - Drake shoulders a support column,  it in two
An entire section of the gallery walkway above comes , burying Blade in debris -- -- but it's not enough for Drake
He  forward, fishing Blade out, hauling him up -- Drake head-butts Blade -- once, twice
Blade's eyes roll to whites
Drake looks down,  Blade's discarded sword
Drake scoops it up,  at Blade -- Blade manages to roll to the side, avoiding the blow
Drake  again, dealing Blade a glancing blow -- -   - Waiting
More blood has trickled down her neck, into her eyes
But she can't wipe them anymore
She's already got her bow drawn
She's committed to the shot
We can hear '  as she settles
She takes a final breath, holds it -- and lets the plague arrow fly
as it streaks downward, hurtling towards Drake at more than 300 feet per second
Then, at the last possible instant	-- -  -   - Drake deflects the arrow with his sword
It harmlessly falls to the floor, rolling a few yards away
, stunned, her expression melting into despair
swinging Blade's sword around
it into Blade's side
As he pulls it back out again -- , sinking downward
He's on his knees now, in shock
Drake  again shifting, conjuring up seventy centuries of violence and predation
And the nightmare shape that was only hinted at before, finally takes center-stage
suffuses Drake's flesh, turning his skin crimson
His canines elongate, his lower jaw distends
Jagged bone spurs erupt all over his body -- like he's growing a suit of razor-sharp thorns
He doesn't need a sword anymore
He's become a living weapon
Drake is gone
Now he is -- Drake swings the sword overhead
He's going to decapitate Blade
And just as the sword reaches the top of its arc -- emerges from the shadows behind Drake, clutching a silver stake
She  it into Drake's back,  pushing with all the strength her little body can muster
Drake staggers
The blow wasn't lethal, but it hurt all the same
He turns on Zoe, enraged, his attention distracted for one crucial second -- , summoning the last of his reserves
He pitches his body forward, managing to snag the end of the plague arrow
And before Drake even realizes what is happening -- Blade sinks the plague arrow deep into Drake's chest
Drake drops the sword, turning back to face Blade -- Exhausted beyond measure, Blade sags
'  - as the arrowhead dispense the bio-weapon
We  the virus flooding Drake's internal organs, causing them to blacken as his circulatory system carries it throughout his body
' , letting loose an  , vomiting up a spray of blood mist
His monstrous features begin to melt, reshaping into his more familiar face
At the same time we -- MACR0 Shrinking until we are amidst the spray of blood Drake expelled
We continue shrinking until we are moving with the individual molecules of Drake's breath as the plague virions latch onto them, causing them to blacken and become necrotic
Moving with the twirling molecules until they are inhaled by -- , having retreated from her defeat by King
She clutches her throat
We can see the virus infiltrating her system as tiny expand across her face
She sways, falling onto the floor
She reaches a beseeching hand towards King -- -- then dies, a final still-born curse on her lips
are feeling the effects now too
One by one they drop, choking, going into convulsions
As they writhe on the floor, we watch the Daystar virus ravaging their bodies
Drake slumps against the wall
Hero and villain are now separated by only a few feet
Both at death's door
Well done, hunter
Well done
Blade stares back
At this point, he's just trying to remain conscious
He's lost a ton of blood
You fought with honor -- Drake shudders, his breathing becoming increasingly shallow
-- as  knew you would
The humans are coming for you, you know
In their eyes, you and  are the same
Allow me one last indulgence, then -- (gasping) -- a parting gift -- Drake grows still, his eyes locked on Blade's
rush to Blade's side
Zoe joins them
Blade is dying, fading fast
Abigail shakes Blade -- Blade
Her voice sounds distant and muted, overridden by Blade's own which is fading up, dominating the soundtrack
Blade's eyes can't focus anymore
They're clouding over
' We drop away from Abigail and King -- like we're falling down a dark tunnel
Then the world

Cumberland and Hale are among the first out
They rush towards the Phoenix Towers entrance, guns drawn, and  behind them

Danica, Asher, and the others all ignite

Then we hear  coming from the back of the atrium
they find Blade
He's dead, slumped against a wall
There's no sign of Drake
The vampire king is gone
- Blade's face, his body being wheeled on an autopsy gurney
to reveal that we are in an  morgue
Cumberland and Hale stand nearby, overseeing everything as -- lift Blade's body onto an autopsy table
They turn on a bank of overhead  lights
The lead examiner reaches for a scalpel
But as he touches the scalpel to Blade's chest -- (

as they react with varying degrees of shock
We realize that it's not Blade lying before them
It's Drake
Somehow, even in death, the vampire king managed to take Blade's shape and temporarily retain it
(
) The virus didn't kill Blade
But the authorities very well could have
So in the end, realizing that own his people were doomed, Drake decided to give Blade a gift
(beat) ( AaD) By taking Blade's shape, he bought Blade enough time to escape
Offering Blade a second chance at life - - : - bright summer day
Blade stands at the edge of a cliff, looking out over a sun-struck ocean
For the first time since we've seen him, he's not wearing armor or sunglasses or handguns or rifles
And were it not for the sword he holds, we might even mistake him for an ordinary man
(
0
) And so Blade took it
Blade flings his sword over the cliff, into the ocean below
(

) We never saw him again
We see the sword sinking, reflecting the refracted sunlight from above as it twirls end over end
At peace with himself at last
After a moment's reflection, he turns and walks away

(beat) But that's what heroes do
They simply fade out
And in this way -- as Blade moves further and further away from us, dwindling into the horizon until he disappears entirely

Over darkness we hear the sound of
- We are moving towards a local punk dive wedged into a crowded block in the meat packing district
() stands outside, checking ' IDs
We hear    coming from within
approaching
King holds his four-barreled rifle
Abigail peels away, disappearing into an alley as King nears the front door
The doorman recognizes King, knows he's trouble
Evening Lucius
King, what the hell are you doing here
Just a little sport hunting
- belts out a cover of Sam and the Shams' Little Red Riding Hood
The band members look a little lupine
As King weaves his way through the crowd, Lucius hurries alongside
Ain't no vampires left, King
So who do you have to hunt
That's an interesting question, my friend
And 've got a question for you in return
-   - As King pushes his way through to the bathrooms, we hear an coming from the men's room
What do you get when you cross a vampire with a werewolf
The door to the men's room
Abigail comes flying out
She hits the far wall of the hallway, slides to th floor
But she's up in an instant, pulling a knife on -- (raising his four-barrel) fur coat that sticks to your neck
-  -, wearing a blood-soaked Stray Cats-style suit
The ephedrine nightmare creature looks at King, opening his elongated snout to flash a set of razor-sharp canid teeth
Don't you know fur is murder
