href <b>// --> </b> An original screenplay By Kevin Jarre Fourth draft March 15, 1993 :  a collage of old photos, prints, etc
, and silent live-action vignettes, all dark and heavily shadowed like a dimly-remembered dream
The first images show the opulence of the Gilded Age, the epic vistas of the west, cattle drives and cowtowns with all their violence
"The economic explosion following the Civil War created an unprecedented nation-wide market for beef
Previously worthless cattle running wild throughout Texas were gathered into herds And driven north to the railheads In Kansas
Fortunes were made as Cowtowns sprang up on the Prairies, wide-open centers of Commerce and vice, their streets Choked with heavily-armed young Men fresh from the cattle drives
In those days the correct term For a cowhand was 'drover'
'Cowboy', like 'cowpoke', was originally an insult implying deviant sexuality and was rarely used
But these invading drovers were a wild breed for soon shootings and wholesale drunken riots became so frequent that ordinary citizens literally could not walk down the street
In fact at their height the cowtowns had higher murder rates than modern New York or Los Angeles and there Was no law but that of the gun
" dashing  in a Prince Albert coat appears, long locks tumbling down his shoulders, twin Navy Colts thrust into a red sash at his waist, a tin star on his chest
Next we see him in action, downing 3 barroom opponents at once, pistols around the room like a strobe light: "Straight-up at 75 yards or eye- to-eye at point-blank range, the greatest gunman of all time was an Illinois abolitionist farm boy named James Butler Hickok, better known as Wild Bill, the Prince of Pistoleers
But Wild Bill worked His trade on the side of justice And as marshal of cowtowns like Hays City and Abilene he became a Legend, the one man who stood Between law and chaos
" Now Hickock sits facing us, playing poker as a shabby-looking with a gun steals up behind him and
"Wild Bill's fame spread nation- wide but his end came quietly in the spring of '76 when a strange cross-eyed little drifter put a bullet through the back of his head, apparently for no other reason than he wanted to kill a celebrity
" Now a group of cowhands carouse a streetcorner, raising hell as 2 mustachiod young  walk up, trying to quiet them down
"In Dodge City meanwhile, Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson were Becoming known as fast-guns
But Their fame had nothing to do with Shooting
" Seeing it's hopeless, the lawmen whip out their pistols and start clubbing the drover's making them stagger and grimace, holding their heads
"Earp and Masterson operated more like modern policemen, using teamwork and persuasion to keep order
Still, sometimes things got out of hand
" An   creeps up behind the lawmen, about to fire
"But Wyatt had a guardian angel
" -  with a sawed-off shotgun steps from the shadows behind the drover and
The huge blast - the screen for an instant, making the drover seem to disappear
The lawmen spin around
The thin man breaks the shotgun open then calmly holds out his wrists to be cuffed
Earp looks at him in shock, mouthing the word "thanks"
"John Henry 'Doc' Holliday was the son of an aristocratic, highly cultured southern family
Trained in Philadelphia, he had Embarked on a career as a society Dentist when he contracted Tuberculosis
Advised to practice In the west where it was thought The climate and clean air would Prolong his life, Doc soon Realized it was all only a matter Of time and gave up dentistry to Become a professional gambler and Gunman
" The scene shifts to an elegant Victorian home: a stern Jewish patriarch orders his darkly beautiful  upstairs as her weeping mother looks on
The girl huffs up the stairs followed by her little white dog
Next, the girl and dog are seen escaping through a window to the street below and a waiting cab
"Others headed east
Bent on becoming an actress
Josephine Marcus defied her wealthy and Very proper San Francisco Jewish Family to run away with a Traveling theatrical company, Braving the perils of the Frontier on her own
Dangerous as This might seem, it was another Age and women were so rare, their Presence so cherished that they Could travel virtually anywhere In the west in perfect safety
" Now we see  silhouetted against the night sky, a hand knocking on a door, figures conferring in darkness, then more riders, moving west in restless haste toward the rising sun
"At about this time the Texas Rangers, having eliminated the Commanche threat, turned their Attention to the outlaw gangs Marauding along the Rio Grande, Cleaning up the border strip in 4 Years of hard riding
Those they Could not indict or convict the Rangers put down in their Black Book, letting it be known that They could either leave Texas or Face summary execution
This Resulted in the mass migration of The absolute dregs of the Texas Underworld to the most dangerous, Uncivilized part of the entire Country, the southeast corner of The Arizona Territory
" jagged, moonlit landscape, a lone prospector and his burro moving along a ridge, a pick digging into a rocky ledge, an ore car emerging from a mine shaft, finally a hilltop cluster of tents becoming the skeletal wood-frame beginnings of a town
"Harsh and inhospitable, savaged in turn by the Apache and Mexican bandits, this had always been an accursed place, a virtual hell on earth where it was thought life itself could never prosper, much (cont
) less civilization
Then in 1879, a prospector named Ed Schiefflin set off alone into the Dragoon Mountains
Friends told him he Was crazy, that the only thing He'd find in this Godforsaken Place would be his tombstone
Instead he found silver, lots of It, and overnight the town of Tombstone sprang up
Mining Taking out millions in ore
Land Value shot sky-high and Speculators and gamblers and Opportunists of all nations Scrambled in by the thousands to Make Tombstone queen of the Boomtowns, so rich that the Latest Paris fashions, hard to Find even in the biggest cities, Were sold there by the wagonload From the makeshift storefronts
" An engraving of a stagecoach holdup, herds of cattle moving north, a newspaper story of a massacre in Mexico, congressmen railing at each other, shaking their fists
"Meanwhile, the exile Texans had banded together to form the nucleaus of an organized gang
Seizing controp of the Surrounding countryside they Robbed stagecoaches at will while The big absentee business Interests employed them as tax Collectors and strongarm men
But The backbone of their trade Remained border rustling, Periodic raids into Mexico to Steal cattle while engaging in What was described as a virtual Orgy of murder and violence
The Raids became so frequent and so Bloody that the Mexican Government formally protested to President Chester
Arthur, Prompting heated debate in Congress
General Sherman Declared that the only possible Way of bringing order was to send In the army but in the wake of Civil War Reconstruction federal Intervention in civilian affairs Was politically impossible
" Pounding hooves, flowing manes, a pack of night-riding kicking hell-for-leather across the desert moonscape
"With only some 100 members, the gang was an elite body of gunmen, known by the red silk sashes they wore around their waists
Fiercely proud of their Terrifying reputation and Answerable to no one, they were a Law unto themselves, finally Emerging as one of the earliest Examples in American history of Full-scale organized crime
" as the screen fades to an ominous black and
"They called themselves the Cowboys
" -  /  - Burning daylight, hard reality
squad of uniformed rides through the Sonora desert, sabres glinting in the sun
Approaching the mouth of a rocky canyon their hard- bitten  signals them to stop, leaning down to study a jumble of hoofprints on the ground
He turns to the anxious- looking   on his right, speaking in Spanish via subtitle: It's them, only an hour north
But this is the border
You saw what those animals did at That rancho
You think a border Is going to stop me
No, 'm Going to see them suffer for what They did
swear it on my soul
The Captain spurs his horse and they ride on at a gallop, plunging into the canyon
-   - The full moon throws fantastic shadows across the high walls of the canyon as the Rurales ride through
At the bend the Captain halts them
The young one starts to speak but the Captain shushes him, peering into the darkness
few beats then: Turn around
Fast
Now
But suddenly  erupts from the shadows all around them, blasting them from the saddle, each powder flash lighting up the canyon for an instant, freezing each victim in the moment of his death
Then, just as abruptly the firing stops, leaving only the Captain, the young Rurale, and a 3rd Rurale alive
Dazed and bloody, they struggle to their feet as 6 armed  emerge from the shadows, walking into the moonlight toward them
With broad-brim hats swept up in front, silk scarves and red sashes, high boots and silver- studded gunleather, they look like 17th century pirates
These are the Cowboys:    , the ageless, white- bearded leader;    , 2nd-in-command, smiling, bull-necked;   and  , the old man's sons; , a Mexican half-breed;  and  , dark, Byronic, with an air of something very strange
The Old Man nods to Florentino: Tell 'em to get on their knees
Florentino does so in Spanish
The others kneel but the Captain remains on his feet, steely-eyed, defiant
He will not kneel
He is proud
So how'd you like our little Carry-on over at that rancho
Kinda hit the spot didn't it
Animals
Butchers
Hey, somebody get that stick on His knees
Curly Bill casually  his shotgun into the Captain's legs, dropping him into a splayed lotus position
Curly Bill knods
Gracias
They call me Old Man Clanton
'm What you might call the founder Of the feast
Now maybe you ain't Heard, but we skylark through Your dingy little country just About any time we damn well Please and big-hat, crummy- Lookin' free-holes stumblin' Around in the dark ain't allowed
Messican po-lice, huh
Think You're bad medicine, don't you
Hell, 've let stronger stuff run Down my leg
So next time we come Better step aside
Get in our Hair again, we'll saw your prods Off with butter knives and stuff 'em in your gobs
Ain't kiddin' neither
You been told
Now git
The others rise and dash away but Curly Bill stops the Captain: Hold up, jefe
Got a joke  wanna Tell you
The Captain speaks grimly in Spanish
Florentino smiles
He say he know you killing him
Now how'd he figure that out
He say he is no' afraid, someone Will revenge for him
sick Horse
sick horse
What the hell
Scattered chuckles from the others but we notice Ringo frown and draw his pistol as the Captain repeats the words
Something,  don't know, he talk Fancy, you know, like a priest
Is like, "a sick horse who sits---" That's not what he said, you Ignorant wretch
Your spanish is Worse than your English
Come on, Let's get it over with
Ringo takes aim
The Captain sneers, suddenly in English: You go to hell
You first
-   - as the Cowboys fire their pistols and shout, running their stolen herd out of a draw into a clearing where the McLaury brothers wait:  , older, edgy; and , younger, easy-going
Looks like you had a party
Oh, we had a big time
The Old Man, Curly Bill, and Ringo rein up and look out at the sun rising magnificently from the desert floor
The Old man stretches his legs in the stirrups, taking out a whiskey flask
Ain't that sweet
That's why Stay out here
Thank you, God
He raises the flask and drinks
Curly Bill turns to Ringo: What'd the Messican mean, a sick Horse's gonna get us
Didn't make No sense
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him
" Well now that's a little more Like it
-   /  - , a fabulous thoroughbred stallion, rears and neighs on an open flat-car where it's tethered with 4 near- identical geldings
small boy tries to pet it as a strong- featured, fair-haired  appears, quieting the horse
Tall and slim in a black frock coat and black flat-brim hat, he moves with assurance and grace, a man in control
This is "Dear Governor Gosper-in re yours directing action against Cowboys, stop
Beg to inform have Twice sent deputies to serve Warrants on Cowboy suspects, Stop
Nothing to show for it but 2 dead deputies, stop
Short of deputizing
Army am at loss- (points at Wyatt) The tall man over there, Marshal
'm not sure but  think that's Wyatt Earp
Wyatt Earp
Oh, right, Dodge City
Back down the platform Wyatt strokes the stallion gently, looking up as Dake approaches
Mr
Earp
My name's Dake, Crawley Dake
'm the
Marshal for- Forget it
Excuse me
said forget it, answer's no, Don't want the job and that's Final
'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me

But wait, you don't understand- No Marshal, you don't understand

That is if you don't Mind
Jesus
Good day now
see, off to strike it rich, Huh
All right, fine, wish you Luck
Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience
Already got a guilty conscience, Might as well have the money too
Dake retreats
Wyatt turns back to his horse testily
Suddenly: Boy, 'd know that sour face Anywhere
Wyatt turns
His brothers stand behind him, smiling
Though is a little older and heavier
a little younger and slimmer, they're otherwise identical to Wyatt, right down to their style of dress
Wyatt breaks into a grin, hugging them both, his cool replaced with an almost boyish enthusiasm
Well how do we look
Hey
Virgil
My God
Morgan
Hey, Boy
You look great
Both of you
Virgil's blonde wife , small, fierce, and Irish, steps up with Morgan's fair, cameo-lovely young  in tow
Wyatt, you remember Allie Good God, well he better
(hugs her, laughing) Allie-girl
And Louisa
You're So lovely
'm at your feet, Darlin'
Just at your feet
(turns to Morgan) Guess it's only right
Ma always Said you were the prettiest
But she doted on the frowner Wyatt's handsome blonde wife  enters from the street: Wyatt,  couldn't find a single Store that had laudanum any- Mattie, they're here
Folks this Is Celia Ann but you can call her Mattie
Or even Mrs
Earp if you Prefer
Mrs
Earp
Land ' love, it finally happened
Mattie it's a Pleasure
All exchange greetings and hugs
Wyatt positively beams: Boy,  sure been dreamin' about This
God
Since forever
Wait
He turns them toward the stationhouse window, arranging them in a group and pointing to their reflection
There, look at that
God Almighty Wyatt smiles, shaking his head
Morgan's starts to speak, but: Don't talk, just
yeah
They stand silently, studying themselves, together as a family
Wyatt still shaking his head happily, drinking it in
Finally: All right, now let's go make our fortune
-  - large woman, Wyatt's black horses tied to the rear, crosses the majestic, forbidding Arizona desert with its red volcanic rocks and the giant saguaro cactus dotting the landscape so mysteriously, like huge, spiny hieroglyphics
-    - camp by the river under a clear night sky dripping with stars
After dinner
The women, Virgil, and Morgan sit by the fire
Morgan petting his dog, a sweet little foxhound
Louisa sits behind him, twirling his silky blonde hair, turning to Mattie: Don't you love their hair
They All have the same hair
Just then Wyatt appears on his stallion, galloping across the moonlit plain toward them, sitting his horse like a centaur
It's clear he's a magnificent horseman
Virgil smiles: Look at him go, will ya
tell You, that's the real Wyatt, born In the saddle
Oh, he can go all right
Can he then
Rather ride than eat
The women cackle lasciviously
Virgil groans at Allie: Try to be a lady, will you
Wyatt rides up and dismounts, unsaddling the horse
Give him some good exercise
Sure Some stud
Some string in fact
What're you gonna do, race 'em
Hope so
Clean up with this boy
Louisa turns to Mattie, fishing in her bag: Mattie hon', did you say you Needed some laudanum
have a Bottle right here
Just be Careful
It's full of hop
You're a lifesaver
Don't worry, just get headaches sometimes
As Wyatt leads the horse away the women get up, Allie and Louisa going to the river with dishes, Mattie crossing to the wagon
Virgil and Morgan watch her appreciatively: Mighty fine
Wonder where he Found her
Same place we found Ours probably At the other end of camp Mattie climbs into the wagon and lies down
Wyatt appears and starts to stroke her head
Come up to the fire, honey
think 'll just lie down awhile coyote starts  from the far darkness
Mattie shudders: Long as  live 'll never Get used to that sound
They're just lonely is all
Hell, howl myself sometimes
You get lonely
She seems genuinely surprised
Wyatt looks genuinely confused
Over at the fire, Morgan hugs and mashes Louisa playfully
Come up, Lou
Come up here, girl
Stop
She fights loose
Wyatt walks up, sits, shaking his gold watch
Look at that
Busted
Brand new Money Ward, too
33 years old And  don't even have a decent Watch
'Bout time  started Lookin' out for myself
Well here we are a family again

Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, 'm serious
Well that's your problem
Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott
Hit a streak when we left
Him And Kate
(from the stream) Uh, that woman
miss Doc
miss that ol' rip
don't Neither do
He makes me laugh
-   - handsomely appointed saloon
At a corner table, the pot is so rich 2 players have folded leaving  , a big, sullen, tough-looking gambler, facing gaunt, elegant Full of southern refinement and languid, almost feline grace
Doc has such unerring style and aplomb that he makes his constant tubercular coughing sound as if he's merely clearing his throat
Bailey leans forward, seething with impatience: said that's 500 to you, Holliday
In or out
500
Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand
, Doc's voluptuous Hungarian consort enters, refilling his engraved silver stirrup cup
She has a faint accent: Here, Doc
Bless you, darling (puts arm around her) Darling
Are you mad
You're not Wearing a bustle
How lewd
Oh, for Christ's sake
Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst
Well call me fool but  guess 'll just have To call
Cover your ears, darling
Doc covers the bet and shows his hand
Bailey pounds the table
God damn son of a
Isn't that a daisy
Just pick up your money and go
Sick of listening to you simper
Now Ed, are we cross
Doc leans forward, revealing an ivory gun-butt under his coat
Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me
Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'
Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say
Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore
You know, Ed, if thought you weren't my friend Don't think  could bear it
Now a Cheshire cat smile we will soon come to know very well steals over Doc's face as he takes out his nickel-plated
38 Colt Lightning and
45 Peacemaker and lays them on the table
There, now we can be friends Again
But remember, Ed, Friendship is trust-so please Don't hurt me
Doc bats his eyelashes
Bailey jumps up, boiling
long, sweaty moment, then Bailey
Doc spring up, grabbing him by the hair and jabbing his fist into Bailey's armpit
Bailey screams and doubles over
Doc gives him two more blows, so light they hardly seem capable of the effect they're having
But as he turns to give him another we suddenly that there's a  in Doc's hand
The bartender reaches for the shotgun under the bar
Kate pulls a Derringer from her muff and puts it to his ear
Touch that gun,  burn you down
He backs off
Kate covers the room
Bailey drops to his knees
Oh, my God
Does it hurt
lot
Good
Eyes gleaming cruelly, Doc blows his cigarette smoke into Bailey's face
Bailey sinks to the floor in a fetal position
Kate gathers up the pot as Doc retrieves his guns, looking around the room
Then both back up to the door
Well, good evening then
They exit
The others look down at the groaning Bailey lying in a pool of his own blood
shakes his head: 1ST Judas
-   - Doc and Kate stride quickly down the board sidewalk to the hotel
calculate that's the end of This town
And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling
been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started Kate points to 2 horses saddled and packed outside the hotel
My sweet clever Magyar, so that's Why you're not wearing a bustle
Doc gives Kate a peck on the cheek as they mount and ride off
-  / - small cottage at the edge of town
As the Earps drive up we a sobbing woman sitting splay-legged in the middle of the street while her husband tries to comfort her
3 small children stand alongside them, watching in stunned silence as Cowboys  , cocky, arrogant, and  , lean, dark, heave their furniture and belongings out of the cottage into the street while snarling things like, "shut up
deadbeats
move it
"  The Earps stop, staring at this scene in shock, Allie looking ready to fight
Virgil restrains her, Stillwell looks up: What're you lookin' at
Virgil looks at Wyatt who shakes his head
They drive on as
-  ,  - Unlike the dreary, weather-beaten western towns in movies, Tombstone is new and colorful, part town, part mining camp, a wild mixture of brightly painted wooden storefronts and half- finished stone buildings rimmed by clusters of tents and shanties, all perched atop a hill with a magnificent view of the desert and the purple Dragoon mountains beyond
We the vibrant din of hammers and saws, player pianos, hurdy- gurdys, clip-clopping horses' hooves, and pealing laughter as the Earps drive up Allen Street, the main drag, lined with saloon after saloon, sidewalks bustling with drovers, miners, Chinamen, and sullen gun-toting hard-cases
They pull up in front of the Grand Hotel and step down
, handsome, well-dressed, wearing an ornate crescent-shaped gold sheriff's badge and a ready smile walks up and shakes hands: Newcomers, eh
Names John Behan, 'm Cochise County Sheriff
Just Hit town
Just this minute

The one next door and the one Across the street are vacant too
Same rent and 'll throw in a Good cleaning
Believe me, you Won't find a better deal within Town limits
Wyatt looks enquiringly at his brothers
They shrug
He's calling the shots
Wyatt shrugs back
Finally: Guess we'll take all three
-
/
- large stable and corral backing up into a vacant lot
Wyatt's big horses feed in their stalls while Wyatt faces the stableboy: and easy on the grain,  don't want 'em too fidgety
Morgan and Virgil enter with  , the jovial old town marshal
Shaking hands, all 4 go up Allen, taking in the town
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal
Lotta law around here

He ain't no law, only Real law here's the Cowboys

On Account of the element
Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days
Regular slaughter house
High-rollers won't go near it
Too bad, nice place
Wyatt nods, suddenly very interested as they walk on and
-   - We feel the sensual delight of going from hot sun into cool dark as Wyatt enters, going up to the ornate mahogany bar
Though a large, handsome saloon complete with gaming tables, it has only a few patrons on hand
"The Lilly and the Rose" is on the player piano as bartender   appears: What can  get you
Let me have one of those cigars
(lights up, looks around) Kinda nice in here
You run it
Milt Joyce, owner-operator
Well, excuse me for askin', Milt, But isn't it kinda dead in here
Joyce points to the faro table in the corner where , an unshaven plug-ugly with a big
Colt
45 carried ostentatiously in a shoulder holster, deals to a couple of scruffy-looking drifters
You see that bird at the faro Table
That's Johnny Tyler
He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the High-class play
Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs
Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer
Well sure, neighbor, easy to say
-   - As Wyatt walks up Tyler starts snarling at one of the players: You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, 'll blow you Right out of that chair
(looks up, sees Wyatt) Somethin' on your mind
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair
That a fact
Yeah
It's a fact
Tyler looks Wyatt over, noting he is unarmed
He stands, sneering: For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you
That a fact
Yeah
It's a fact
Well 'm real scared
Damn right you're scared
can See it in your eyes
Wyatt steps forward suddenly, eyes cold and hard like a shark
Suddenly realizing he's in way over his head
Tyler shrinks back reflexively, his hand moving toward his gun
The other players scatter
Wyatt nods, his voice calm and steady: Go ahead
Skin it
Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens
Listen Mister, 'm getting' tired- Wyatt abruptly  his face, making his teeth clack together
'm getting tired of your gas
Jerk that pistol and go to work
Tyler goes pale, all pretense of courage gone
Wyatt slaps him again
said throw down, boy
Another slap
Tyler stays frozen, blood dripping down his chin
You gonna do something or just Stand there and bleed
Tyler's done
Wyatt plucks his gun away, handing it to Joyce
No,  didn't think so
Here, Milt
Keepsake, hang it over the Bar
All right, youngster
Out You go
Wyatt takes Tyler by the ear, dragging him across the room like an unruly child
At the door he gives the ear a twist
And don't come back
Ever
Tyler winces
Wyatt shoves him out into the street then turns to Joyce casually: See how easy that was
-    & 5TH  () - Later
Wyatt walks up to his brothers at the corner
Well we're off and running
Just Acquired us a quarter-interest in The game at the Oriental
Acquired
So to speak
Down the block, unseen by the Earps, a wild-eyed Tyler is advancing on them with a sawed-off shotgun
He is within 20 feet when suddenly: Why Johnny Tyler, you madcap, Where are you going with that Shotgun
Tyler spins around to see Doc standing in a doorway, smiling
Tyler freezes
Doc
didn't know you were in town
Wyatt spots Doc and walks up, brothers in tow
Though they don't so much as shake hands, we sense a strong bond between the 2 men
Doc
How the hell are you
Perfect, Wyatt
Simply perfect
Wyatt
Wyatt Earp
Going into business for Ourselves
Wyatt just got us a Faro game
Since when is faro a business
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade
said poker's an honest trade
Only suckers buck the tiger
The Odds are all with the house
Depends how you look at it Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads
That's what  love about Wyatt
He can talk himself into anything
They laugh
Frozen there
Tyler begins to tremble
Finally: Oh sorry, Johnny,  forgot all About you
You can go now
Just Leave the shotgun
Thank you
Tyler scuttles off as Behan approaches affably
Doc sniffs
Sheriff Behan, Doc Holliday
Forgive me if  don't shake hands
So how's Tombstone treating you
Fine, fine
But  was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track
Actually, you know, that's not a Bad idea, send a signal we're Growing up
Little ahead of yourselves, Aren't you
This is just a mining Camp
See how everyone dresses
Awfully Toney for a mining camp
No, the Die's cast, we're growing, be as Big as San Francisco in a few Years
And just as sophisticated
can hardly wait
As if on cue, a bullet  past Behan's head
Everyone ducks
More  as a man holding a bloody hand to his throat reels out the door of the nearby Crystal Palace, his gun firing wildly like a sputtering engine before he pitches face first onto the sidewalk, dead
Immediately 2 more men appear: a staggering  with a bullet hole in his shoulder; and    , a leathery plainsman with his gun at the ready
crowd forms as the drunk raises his pistol, bellowing
You son of a bitch
That's right, keep comin', keep comin'
(turns to Behan) Very cosmopolitan
know him
That's Creek Johnson
Suddenly a 3rd man,   , long-haired, hawk- nosed, appears, pistol at the ready, keeping bystanders at bay
Easy, gents
Private affair
(spots Wyatt) Wyatt
Doc
Hey
Jack
You bastard
The drunk now has raised his gun to where it's almost level and: Yeah, good
Right about there
Johnson
The drunk drops in a heap
Johnson spots Wyatt: Hello, Wyatt
Hiya Doc
What was that all about
Drunks
Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar
saw the whole thing
(turns to Behan) Sheriff, may  present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion
Watch your ear, Creek
Doc points to his bloody ear
Johnson touches it, sees the blood, gives a silent start
Just then White arrives, looking weary, facing Johnson and Vermillion
'Fraid 'll have to have those guns
Fair fight
We were legal
Sorry, boys
Gotta take you Before Judge Spicer
Well law and order every time, That's us
They hand over their guns while Virgil looks at the 2 dead men lying in the street, shaking his head: What kinda town is this
Nice scenery
They look
stagecoach stops in the street looks out the window, her little white dog under her chin
She and Wyatt spot each other instantly, both impressed
That must be the theatrical Troupe
There's a show tonight at Schieffelin Hall
Hey, Wyatt, you goin' to the Show
Maybe we'll see you there
(turns to White) Won't we
Yeah, probably
White leads them off to jail
Wyatt and Josephine hold each other's gaze as the coach drives on
Doc smiles: Well, an enchanted moment -   () - Pony Deal and McMasters watch as the actors exit the coach for the hotel
Josephine turns to the pretty 1st actress: Interesting little scene Wonder who that tall man was
1ST Typical frontier type
Long and Lean
And those gray eyes
Like a Wild hawk
You see quite a few of His type out here
Oh,  want one
- ,   - The actors enter, going to the desk while Josephine looks for a place to sit
fat, well-dressed easterner with a newspaper sits nearby, ignoring her
Seeing this from outside, McMasters instantly barges into the lobby, hoists the easterner out of his chair, and hurls him bodily out into the street
Josephine nods her surprised thanks
McMasters tips his hat shyly, exits as the 1st actress returns with her key
They exchange looks
-   - full house, pandemonium
Curly Bill, Ringo and their Cowboy entourage form a block in the center Rows while  , Behan's bespectacled, slightly effeminate little Deputy makes his timid way down the aisle, looking for a seat midst the off fist-fight and yelling match
2 cocky young Cowboys,   and  , call out to him: Hey, Sister Boy
Shut up, Zwing
Sit here, Billy
Curly Bill beckons
Happy as a lark, Breakenridge takes the seat next to him
Up above, the Earps sit in a box, the women thrilled: This is so much fun
We haven't Been to a show since years
hope they're good
(shouting from below) Lady, they better be good
Doc enters, Kate on his arm
The  women exchange uneasy nods
Kate, you know the Earps
They sit as White enters with Mayor   and wife
Wyatt, this is Mayor Clum and his wife
Your reputation precedes you
wonder - Not a prayer
Nice meetin' you
While the orchestra tunes up and the crowd's excitement rises, White sits next to Wyatt, pointing out the different Cowboys and giving a thumbnail sketch of each as we  over them: Well everybody's here except the Old Man
Got the blade, Billy Grounds, Zwing Hunt, Billy Claiborne, Wes Fuller, Tom and Frank McLaury, Billy Clanton's The youngest
Wild one
Then the Breeds, Hank Swilling, Pony Deal
Florentino's Mex-breed
They all Hate Mex, but he hates 'em Special
Johnny Barnes, Frank Stillwell
That's Behan's little Deputy, Billy Breakenridge
Follows the Cowboys around like a Puppy
And the big boys: Curly Bill Brocius, he's the Old Man's Rimrod; the one looks like an Actor, that's Johnny Ringo
Best Gun alive they say
He's kinda Different
Curly Bill's the only One he talks to
mean they're All rough boys, but Ringo Don't know
really don't Music
The house lights dim
The audience hushes spotlight hits easel at the end of the stage: "Professor Gillman and His Ballet of Gravity
"  Out in the audience, Barnes groans: Professor Gilllman
Oh hell, Seen him in Bisbee
He catches stuff
The curtain goes up
, a 3rd rate juggler in white tie, tailcoat, and black tights steps out and starts tossing Indian clubs in the air
The audience starts groaning but the Professor's rictus-like smile never changes
Having seen enough, Frank Stillwell stands up and shouts: Hey profesor
Catch this
Stillwell raises his pistol and
An Indian club explodes in the Professor's hand
Screams and scattered laughter in the audience
The Professor is frozen in utter shock, staring at the bullet graze on his hand and saying out loud: They shot me
don't believe it
chord of music and the curtain drops like stone
Applause
-  - The other acotrs hustle the Professor off the stage, appalled
The 1st Actress turns to
, a handsome, slightly raffish classical tragedian
1ST My God, they're shooting at us
They're actually shooting at us
What'll we do
Only thing we can do, dear-be Good
In any event, at least we Won't have to wait for our Notices
Exciting, isn't it
Now This is theater
-   - More music and another card reads: "Selections From the Bard of Mr
Romulus Fabian, Tragedian in Excelsis
"  The curtain rises and Fabian steps out, a purple velvet cloak wrapped resplendently about him like a toga
In the audience, Curly Bill's mouth drops: Prettiest man  ever saw Fabian throws open his cloak, revealing his lithe form in doublet and tights
The whores in the gallery hoot and cheer
Fabian bows
How come he ain't wearin' no pants
(points to whores) That's how come
Ladies and gentlemen, the St Crispin's Day Speech from Henry
To set the Scene, England is Now at war with France
Everything rests upon the battle About to begin
Henry, the young King of England, addresses his men Thusly: "My cousin Westmorland
No, my fair cousin-" Another  and a bullet  into the column next to Fabian with a shower of plaster
Without missing a beat, Fabian casually flicks a chunk off his shoulder and continues: "If we are marked to die, we are enow/ To do our country loss; and if to live
/ The fewer me, the greater the share of honour
" In the audience Barnes holsters his smoke pistol reflectively
He's got nerve, 'll say that
What do you think, Billy
Starry-eyed, Breakenridge answers without thinking: Oh, he wonderful
Uh-oh, looks like somebody's in love
Raw laughter from the others
Breakenridge sinks in his seat
Let him alone
On stage Fabian is in full cry, giving the local a slice of the ripest ham: "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;/ For he today that sheds his blood with me/ Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile
/ This day shall gentle his Condition;/ And gentlemen in England now a-bed/ Shall think Themselves accurs'd they were no Here
/ And hold their manhood Cheap whiles any speaks/ That Fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day
" Wild applause and cheering
Fabian bows with elaborate modesty
That's great
That's our kinda stuff
The curtain falls
Another card: "Faust - or the Devil's Bargain" and the orchestra whirls into "Danse Macabre" by Saint-Saens, the rising curtain revealing a wild pained backdrop, all black and red, covered with weird, Beardsley- esque designs and images of death and damnation
light comes up, revealing an ancient white-bearded scholar sitting alone with his books
Then a hooded Satan dances across the stage, slender and lissome in paned black doublet and breeches and black hose, tempting the old man with images of wealth and youth in the form of a shimmering blonde ballerina
The old man succumbs, signing Satan's contract
The audience watches in rapt attention, especially the Cowboys: He's gonna some up short on that one
Know what 'd do
'd take the Deal then crawfish and drill that Ol' Devil in the ass
How 'bout You, Johnny
What would you do
already did it
Satan makes a flourish
flash-pad  transforms the old scholar into a young student
The ballerina flits by
The student offers her gold
They dance, swirling about the stage in a mad waltz with Satan hovering behind them, mirroring their every move like a puppet master
Finally, having gotten all his gold, the Ballerina drifts away leaving the young student alone, lost in bitterness as he changes back into the old scholar sitting with his books
Satan appears over him, exultant and triumphant, ready to collect the debt as the curtain falls with a final crashing chord
Thunderous cheering and applause
The curtain rises again and the performers come out for bows, all except Satan
Very instructive But who was the Devil
Suddenly Satan bounds out, removing the hood
It's Josephine
It's that woman from the coach
'll be damned
Josephine spots Wyatt's box and smiles
Doc raises an eyebrow: You may indeed
If you get lucky
-   - After the show and theatergoers, including the Earps, stroll homeward arm-in-arm down Allen, all looking up at the clear night sky above
At the Oriental Wyatt stops, turning to Virgil: Comin' to the Oriental, Virge
Not tonight
Tonight me and my Old man're gonna have some fun
Get moving, old man
She laughs, shoving Virgil down the street
He looks at Wyatt: Her maiden name was Sullivan
(kisses Mattie) Better go with 'em, honey
Here's Where  leave you
(grabs his hand) No, stay
Please stay with me
Honey,  gotta start makin' money
Oh, all right
Well  guess  don't have to go Right now
guess  could stay a little while
No, no,  don't want to keep you
No really,  can stay a while
Just go
It's all right
Wyatt, Really
Work well
All right, well, good night
Another kiss and he heads for the Oriental with Morgan
Mattie walks on after the others, fishing through her bag for her bottle of laudanum
-  - The saloon is packed
along the bar at floor level past a wild array of high-button shoes, patent leather pumps, and stack-heeled boots with jingling silver spurs
Track again at shoulder level past an equally wild array of slouch hats, pork-pies, derbys, and wide-brim sombreros
Wyatt sits against the wall, dealing faro with Doc at his side, Morgan on lookout while a sweaty overdressed   makes bets, gnashing his teeth and drumming his fingers n a fever of impatient greed: All right, 'm on fire
Black Seven, seven stickin' spades
Let's go
'm your man
(deals card) You win again
Well played, sir
You are on fire
Told you
'm red hot, 'm Blazin'
Now, red seven
Seven Stinkin' diamonds
Look out
Five Thousand
Let's go
Awful lot of money
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen
You're the doctor
(deals card) sad news, friend
Damn
All right, wait a minute
The high roller lays a set of deeds out on the table as
-  - break in the game
Wyatt studies the deeds as Morgan and Doc look on
Kate sits to one side, blowing smoke rings contentedly
So now we're in the mining Business
Turning into regular Tycoons
Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock
Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, 'm sure
Hey Doc
Come on now
Just his style, Morg
Doesn't Mean anything
So tell me, Wyatt
'm curious
Do you actually consider youself married man
Forsaking all Others
Well yeah
Pretty much
mean Was no angel when we met but People change Doc
mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up
see
And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now
"She"
You know damn well who  mean
That dusky-hued lady Satan
don't know
Probably ignore her
Ignore her
'd ignore her
People can Change, Doc
'll remember you said that
Doc point
Josephine has just walked in with the other actors
Oh, hell
She spots Wyatt and starts toward him but he looks away, as if ignoring her
She stops
Behan steps up to her, tipping his hat, very gallant
They move toward the bar
Wyatt turns to Doc
Satisfied
stand corrected
Wyatt
You're An oak
Josephine and Behan chat at the bar
White nudges Joyce: Since when'd you start servin' Ladies in here
Actresses
It's different
Mr Fabian enters, dramatically gotten-up like Lord Byron
The whole bar bursts into applause
He bows
Breakenridge jumps up from his table, excited: Here, Mr Fabian, have this table
He seats Fabian near the faro game, gets him some champagne
Oh, thank you
You're very kind
Mr
Fabian, 've got to tell you, That's the most wonderful thing Ever saw
What was that
Henry's all right but he's no Match for the Melancholy Dane
(sees his confusion) Hamlet, dear friend, the supreme Role of any actor worth his salt
(leans in, points to Wyatt) Here's a man you should meet, Mr
Fabian
Excellent character study For you, the real-life actual Melancholy Dane
Indeed, sir
How so
Well he hems, he haws, he talks Out of both sides of his Mouth-but all on a very high Plane, just like Hamlet
Getting drunk, Doc
Doc chuckles
Suddenly Curly Bill looms over the faro table with Ringo and a drunken Ike Clanton
Wyatt Earp, huh
heard of you
Listen, Mr
Kansas Law-dog
Law Don't go around her
Savvy
'm retired
Good
That's real good
Yeah, that's good, Mr
Law-dog, 'cause law don't go around here
heard you the first time
Shut up, Ike
(steps up to Doc) And you must be Doc Holliday
That's the rumor
You retired, too
Not me
'm in my prime
Yeah, you look it
And you must be Ringo
Look, Darling, Johnny Ringo
The Deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill, they say
What do you Think, darling
Should  hate him
You don't even know him
Yes, but there's just something About him
Something around The eyes,  don't know, reminds me Of
me
No
'm sure of it, Hate him
(to Ringo) He's drunk
In vino veritas
Age quod agis
Credat Judaeus Apella
(pats gun) Ecentus stultorum magister
(Cheshire cat smile) In pace requiescat
(enters, appeasing) Come on now
We don't want any Trouble in here
Not in any language
Evidently Mr
Ringo's an educated Man
Now  really hate him
Ringo looks at Doc, holding his gaze while suddenly whipping out his
45
Everyone but Doc flinches
Ringo does a dazzling series of twirls and tricks, his nickel-plated pistol flashing like a blaze of silver fire, finally slapping it back into his holster with a flourish
Cheers and hoots
Doc rolls his eyes, hooks a finger through the handle of his silver cup, then launches into an exact duplication of Ringo's routine using a cup instead of a gun
The room bursts into laughter
Doc shrugs
Ringo lets a strange little hint of a smile cross his face then exits with the others
White exhales, turns to Wyatt: See what  mean about it getting Spooky
Curly Bill, huh
Who was that Other idiot
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son
Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable
Yeah, and dangerous
Sitting up on the bar to see the show, Josephine turns to Behan: The man dealing faro
Who is he
That's Wyatt Earp
Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas
peace officer
Impressive man Yes, very
And very married
Oh, so that's it
-  / - Curly Bill steps out with Ike and Ringo
He looks around
feel like doin' somethin'
Getting woolly
(looks up) Hey, Chinky
Come here a minute
An old Chinaman minces by
Curly Bill dashes after him
&  / -  /   - Later
Doc is at the piano, drunk as a lord but playing Chopin flawlessly
Kate pours him another drink
That's my lovin' man
Just can't Get enough
Enough
Never
Now the High-Roller comes reeling up, loud and gratingly drunk
Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"
Sounds like "Old Dog Tray"
What
You know, Stephen Foster
"Oh, Susanna"
"Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster
see, well this happens to be a Nocturne
which
You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin
Doc plays on
Josephine leaves with Behan
Morgan sighs: Now that wounds me
Little tin Swain walkin' off with that black Beauty
mean 'm a married man And all but still, it ain't right
Wyatt grunts and nods, perturbed
Outside the others mount up but Curly Bill stands drugged-up in the middle of the street, arms out, head back, eyes closed, luxuriating in the moonlight
Boy,  feel great
Full of that Hop  got from Chinky
feel Just capitol
You boys go ahead
'm gonna stick around awhile, Howl at the moon
The others shrug and ride off
Curly Bill pulls his pistol, spinning it
Back inside the Oriental it's late, few patrons remain
few beats then suddenly everyone jumps as echo from outside
White goes to the window, looks outside: Curly Bill
He's over across the Street shootin' out the lights
This is great, this is just great
Just then Behan dashes in, white as a sheet, Josephine in tow: Have you been out in the street
Somebody's got to do something
You're the Sheriff
It's not County business, it's a Town matter
Outside Curly Bill starts taking potshots at a passerby's feet, making him dance down the street and scurry for cover
Curly Bill cackles
Inside White turns uneasily to Wyatt: Why don't you just leave it alone
No,  gotta do something
don't Suppose you'd card- None of my business, Fred
Wyatt keeps dealing, Doc keeps playing
White draws himself up and exits
Outside, Curly Bill reloads and keeps shooting
White steps out into the street
We feel a sense of inverted terror as he draws his gun and we  that his hand is trembling
He crosses the street, coming up behind Curly Bill: Hey, Curly
Come on now, boy
Curly Bill spins around
White's gun stares him in the face
Well, howdy, Fred
Back in the bar, Wyatt puts his cards down, looks over at Doc
Maybe  ought to go out there
You will or you won't
Don't look To me
'm going to sleep
Doc lays his head down on the keys, passes out
Wyatt frowns for a moment
Finally he stands, turning to Morgan: Go wake up Virgil
(turns to Joyce) Hey Milt, lend me a sidearm, will you
Joyce hands him a Colt from under the bar
Outside White covers Curly Bill, trembling harder now
An adrenaline rush in a man White's age is hard to look at, he seems so frail, so vulnerable
Even his voice has a quavering edge to it: Hand that over
Come on now
Why sure, dad
'm only in fun
Here she is
With a reassuring smile, Curly Bill holds his pistol out butt- first
White reaches for it, visibly relieved
But quick as a snake's tongue Curly Bill spins it around and into White's chest, blowing him over backward, the blast so close it sets his clothes on fire
Curly Bill turns just as Wyatt flashes into frame and  him over the head with his pistol barrel, laying him out in a groaning heap
Wyatt glances at White lying semi-conscious in the street, chest heaving, eyelids fluttering, making weak little bird-like sounds, smoke rising from his smoldering shirt and vest
Clum runs up: Put his clothes out
Clum pats the embers out in White's clothes but as Wyatt starts to haul Curly Bill up he suddenly finds himself surrounded by Ike, Billy Clanton, and six other Cowboys
Turn loose of him
He just killed a man
He said to turn loose of him
Well 'm not so go home
Swear to God, Mister, step aside Or we'll tear you apart
The Cowboys tense up, ready for action
Wyatt holds his ground, his hard, steady gaze zeroing in on Ike: You
Come here a second
Ike steps up, full of brass
Without warning Wyatt jabs the muzzle of his pistol into his forehead, snapping his head back
Wyatt cocks the pistol
The other Cowboys hush
Ike freezes
Wyatt's eyes bore into him
You die first, get it
The others Might get me in a rush but before That 'm gonna make your head Into a canoe
Understand
Ike stands stock still
Billy steps forward, undaunted: He's bluffin'
Let's rush him
This is it
The Cowboys poise themselves, ready to start, but: And you, you simpleton, you're next
Again a hush
Doc stands behind Wyatt, still drunk, but with his
38 trained on Billy
Billy sneers: Hell, he can't hit nothin'
He's So drunk he's probably seein' Double
Doc pulls out his
45, training it, too, on Billy: have two guns
One for each of you
Billy pauses, chastened
Suddenly there's another commotion as Virgil and Morgan bull their way through the crowd from behind with shotguns
All right, look out
Break it up
Go home, all of you, go home now
This breads the group's will and things suddenly calm down dramatically as the Cowboys disperse
Wyatt lowers his pistol, heaving a sigh of relief as he pulls the still-groggy Curly Bill to his feet and hauls him reeling toward the jail
Come on, you
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull
Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop
- / / - Later
As the Earps and Doc step out on the sidewalk we can see the semi-conscious Curly Bill through the front door of the jail laying in one of the cells, holding a bloody kerchief to his head
Wyatt closes the door, locks it, gives Clum the keys
There
He'll keep till morning The street is quiet as they start back toward the Oriental
Virgil and Morgan following at a discreet distance, smirking: Keep your eye on that brass ring
Don't let anything side-track you
know,  need a keeper
Meanwhile across the street at the hotel Josephine turns to Behan
Well  guess you can see, never a Dull moment
Maybe you should Stay around to see what happens Next
Who know
You might find a Future here
Maybe even my destiny
-  - Morgan's hound sleeps in the corner while Virgil and Morgan shoot pool
Wyatt looking on
but he says did  actually see it happen and  said, no, when arrived Fred'd already been shot
So the judge said, can't have a Murder without a witness-case Dismissed
Can you beat it
After All that
Oh hell, who cares, None of my business anyways
Clum enters, frowning and anxious, just as Morgan sinks a shot
Boy,  love this game
When we're Finally set we gotta each have a Billiard room in our houses
Excuse me, Wyatt, just a moment, Please,  wanted to try and Reason with you
We still haven't Found a Marshal and- Come on Mayor, he already told You no
What about you
You were a lawman
'm busy
We're all busy
Sorry, Mayor, but you're really barkin' Up the wrong tree
You tell 'em, Virge
Clum exits shaking his head
They keep playing
After a beat: You know,  was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place
That's the real money
Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings
Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots
can't hardly believe it
It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt
We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday
Pretty fun too, isn't it
Kinda, actually, yeah
gotta admit
-      - Virgil and Wyatt walk down a quiet, tree-shaded lane on the outskirts of town
Suddenly a rubber ball rolls into their path
small  plays in the front yard of a nearby cottage
Virgil and Wyatt approach, Virgil returning the ball: What're you up to today, son
The boy stands stock still, staring at the men in silence
Cat got your tongue
He turns and walks back to the street without another word
Wait a minute, Virgil
Where you goin'
Virgil keeps going
Wyatt starts after him, leaving mother and child in confusion as
- '  - In tight on a gleaming silver shield, "Town Marshal, Tombstone,
"    to reveal it pinned to Virgil's breast
He sits by his parlor hearth with Morgan at his side
Wyatt sits opposite with his head in his hands
couldn't help it, Wyatt Looked at that woman and it was Just like somebody slapping me in The face
mean these people're Afraid to even walk down the Street and 'm trying to make Money off it like some kind of God damn vulture
That's not me, That's somebody  don't even know
Virgil, please
Don't do this to me
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt
It's- Nothing to do with me
'm your Brother for Christ's sake
God, Don't believe this
(turns to Morgan) Talk to him, will you
Or hit him
(no answer, pauses) Oh no, don't tell me
Morgan looks down in sheepish silence
Then he pulls back his coat, revealing the Deputy's badge on this vest
Wyatt groans
Like you said, Wyatt
We're Brothers
Gotta back your Brother's play
Just did like Figured you would
Listen to me, both of you
This Is no good
This is trouble we Don't need
For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family
Do this and you throw it All away
You saw what happened To Fred White
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights
Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all
Yeah
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em
Old Fred Wasn't up to it
We know that We're doin', Wyatt
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed
There's something else
(turns to Morgan) It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone
But it's Not too late for you, Morg
What're you talkin' about
Wyatt exhales wearily then crouches down in front of his baby brother, looking deep in his eyes, his voice soft, plaintive: All the years  worked the Cowtowns,  was only ever mixed Up in one shooting
Just one Man got killed
Wasn't my fault, Just doin' my job
don't even Know if it was my bullet that Dropped him, but
don't kno, It's sort of hard to explain
At First  just felt funny, you Know, kind of clammy inside
But When it finally sunk in what 'd Done
Believe me, boy, you Don't ever want to feel that way
Not ever
(pauses) Didn't even make a dent, did
(stands, exits) You're both makin' a big mistake
- ,   - Armed with a borrowed pistol and carbine, Wyatt gallops through the desert on one of his other big blacks, eyes scanning the tracks beneath him
He rides up and stops at a well near a large ranch house
He dismounts, studying tracks as rancher   rides up, strong, noble-looking, like something from a Frederic Remington canvas
Wyatt nods
Hooker nods back
This Hooker's ranch
That's right
And 'm Hooker
You seen anything of a man on Horseback leading a black Stallion
Hooker suddenly falls silent, looking at the ground nervously
Well you must've seen somethin', The trail runs right by your Waterhole
(no answer) Oh,  see
So it must've been a Cowboy, right
Really got you People treed, don't they
Look, Mister, it's fine for you Boomers to court trouble, you're Just passin' through
Us Cattlemen gotta live here
Best Can do's point you up to the cut
That's their roost
Wyatt nods his thanks
Hooker looks down, ashamed
Wyatt stares at him a moment
There's something genuinely troubling about so strong a man living in fear
Wyatt rides on, shaking his head
-   - small camp near a clump of trees
Pony Deal brews coffee while McMasters leans against a fallen oak log feeding an eager pack of mongrel pups from a block of jerky as Wyatt rides up
Run for your lives, boys
It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas
McMasters, isn't it
Listen, you Seen a black stallion with- Look,  got a rule
don't talk To lawmen
Dog-catchers neither
'm not a lawman, 'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back Well in that case,  saw your Horse
Billy Clanton was takin' Him up to the Cut to show him Off
The boys're all up there Right now, branding
And in a Mood
Still want your property Back, Mr
Private Citizen
-   - Wyatt and McMasters ride along side-by-side through the hills
So what about you Cowboys anyway
If  had to explain it you Wouldn't understand
Just say We're brothers to the bone
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done
There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there
Same with Cowboys
What they do's their affair Don't preach and  don't judge Ain't no dog-catcher
- '  - wide plateau in the mountains dotted with tents, water and fee troughs, rope corrals, etc
Cowboys cut out steers while others crouch around fires, cooking, looking up with naked hostility as Wyatt rides up
McMasters points to the edge of camp where Billy Clanton is currying Wyatt's stallion
You seem like a nice fella
Like To've know you better
Had you lived
Wyatt rides on, making for Billy
Ike steps up with , the giant half-breed
They walk alongside Wyatt
Hey, law-dog
The hell you doin' here
How 'bout  just drag you off That horse and eat you blood raw
Wyatt ignores them, riding up to within 20 feet of Billy and dismounting
Billy looks up, supremely confident and unconcerned
Where'd you get that horse
Beauty, ain't he
asked where you got him
Where do you think
stole him
Everyone laughs
More cowboys gather, jeering
Wyatt steps closer
Look,  don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and mean to have him back
One way Or another
Come and get him
Look kid,  know what it's like, was a kid, too
Even stole a Horse once
But you can't-- Don't sweet-talk him, make a move
Yeah, go ahead, Mister
Make a move
Billy steps back, poised
Ike and Swilling do the same
3 more Cowboys move up behind him
The scene seems on the brink of explosion when Curly Bill suddenly  into frame on his buckskin mare, majestic and 10 times life size as he pulls back and  to a stop in front of Wyatt, raising a giant roostertail of dust, making everyone but Wyatt recoil
Give him his horse, Billy
Come on, Curly
Don't let him- Shut up
Give him his horse, Billy
Billy reluctantly hands over the leadline
Wyatt mounts and rides off with Dick Nailor in tow, Curly Bill riding alongside
Feel bad about ol' Fred
Just Can't hold back when 'm feelin' Woolly
Still, feel kinda bad
But now we're square
Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge Deserved a rap in the head
Make you a deal
My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone
Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans
You and Your boys stay out of his way, 'll make sure he stays out of yours
Fair enough
You know  got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this
They were all gonna jump me back There
What ever happened to one Against one
Ain't our way
We go all on one, One on all
Fight one of us, you Fight us all
That's the Cowboy way
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys
Cowhands ride for the brand
Oh, we ride for a brand all right
(gives Wyatt the finger) This brand
How 'bout you
(points thumb at self) This brand
We're gonna get along just fine
-   - lazy afternoon
The Earps and Clum lounge in front of the hotel
can't thank you enough
Since You took over there hasn't been a Single problem
We're finally Becoming a civilized town
Nothin' to it
Maybe  jumped the gun
Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted
You know Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys
Business is business
Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em
Not If there's money in it
You are the one, Wyatt
You sure are
-   - Old Man Clanton leads 4 other Cowboys with a herd through the rocky canyon, slipping a flask and singing as the first shot from the rocks above, becoming a
When the dust settles, all are dead except the Old Man who lies pinned under his horse, semi-conscious
emerge from the shadows
It's the Rurales led by the same Young Rurale from before
He bends down to the dazed Old Man, speaking carefully: The old one you kill
This was my father
(sits up suddenly) What, and 'm supposed to Tremble
Kiss my ass, Messican
Hissing gleefully, he jams a derringer under the Young Rurale's chin and , blowing off his sombrero as he falls
The other Rurales fire, emptying their guns into the Old Man as if he were some monstrous rattlesnake that might bite them
- '  - Curly Bill, Ringo, and the others are by the fire, passing a bottle, as Frank Still well gallops up and dismounts, breathless: Old Man Clanton's dead
Ambushed In Guadaloupe Canyon
Messican's Got him
In tight on Curly Bill as the news sinks in
He clenches his fist in rage, then bites a knuckle, getting his control back
All right, first thing's first: It's my outfit now, 'm runnin' The show
Ringo's number two man
Your outfit
'm next in line
You ain't got enough in your Britches
Think you can prove Otherwise, go ahead
Seething with humiliation, Ike mounts up and rides off
Anybody else
No takers
Curly Bill turns back to business: All right
Billy, go after Ike And cool him off then go find the McLaurys, tell 'em what happened And keep an eye on things
Wes Fuller and Bill Claiborne, too
Rest of you come with me
We're Goin' to Mexico
They mount in a bunch and take off south like the wind
-  - Wyatt is up on his stallion, riding along the foot of a high hill
Coming to a cut, he suddenly stops
Josephine is 100 yards up ahead, gorgeously impressive in a black velvet riding habit, riding side-saddle through the cut on a pretty mare
Oh, hell
Looking for an escape, Wyatt turns up a narrow trail on the side of the cut
He follows it as it winds around the hill then abruptly drops back down and comes out on the other side of the cut right in front of Josephine
She waves
He groans: Well, hello
We've never actually met
My Name's- Wyatt Earp,  know
was Beginning to think we'd never Meet
This is fortuitous
That Means lucky
know what it means
Suddenly Wyatt's stallion groans nervously, throwing its head, aroused by the presence of the mare
What is it
Easy now
That mare's in season
Oh
(calms her horse) Now she's starting
How do they know
They know
It's the scent
We Better split 'em up
have a better idea, let's run It out of them
Before Wyatt can stop her she's off at a full gallop
Wyatt pauses, debating with himself
Finally: Yeah, 'm an oak all right
He takes off at a dead run
Catching up, the horses find their rhythm, breaking into a smooth gallop, flying over a jet black plain of volcanic ash into a rolling meadow carpeted with yellow desert poppies, so bright it almost hurts your eyes to look at them
Coming off a rise the desert floor shears off into a wide crevice
Josephine heads right at it
You're not that crazy, are you
Oh, yes  am
crack of her crop and she streaks toward it
Wyatt grits his teeth and follows suit
The sound of their hoofbeats stops for a long instant as they take the jump together, sailing through the air side-by-side, Josephine giggling like a little girl
They light on the other side and gallop on
-  - They pull up at a huge desert stone formation, a canopy of white sandstone with vermillion streaks swirling through it looming over them like a giant oyster shell
Wyatt dismounts, helping Josephine
He takes his long duster from his saddle and lays it on a wide, table-shaped rock for them to sit on
That was lovely
You know you almost got us both Killed back there
Fun though, wasn't it
You'd die for fun
Wouldn't you
You're laughing Was sure you never laughed
laugh sometimes Yes, but how often
Tell me, are You happy
Am  happy
don't know
Happy As the next man,  guess
don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean
You're a little touchy about it
'm not touchy,  just, it's a Silly question, that's all
Am Happy
Are you happy
Of course, 'm always happy
Unless 'm bored
That blonde Woman, is that your wife
What about her
Nothing
Tell me, what do you Want out of life
Where do you get these questions
Just answer
don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know
Doesn't suit you
How would you know
Just doesn't, that's all
Well  ought to know my own mind And 'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids
That suits Me right down to the ground
In Fact, that's my idea of heaven
(pauses) All right, what's your idea of heaven
Room service
Wyatt laughs, almost in spite of himself
Josephine beams
See
You're laughing again
But That's what  want
Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun
Forever
That's my idea Of heaven
Need someone to share It with, though
You mean Behan
(sees her shrug) Then why are you with him
Well he's handsome and he's Charming
He's all right
For Now
Don't say it,  know, 'm Rotten
can't help it
've Tried to be good but it's too Boring
The way you talk
Never heard a Woman talk like that
Oh look,  haven't got time to be Proper,  want to live
'm a woman,  like men
If that's Unladylike then  guess 'm not a Lady
At least 'm honest
Well you're different, no arguing That
But you're a lady all right
'll take my oath on it
He looks at her, enchanted, but suddenly his face clouds
What's wrong
don't know, doesn't make any Sense
almost can't look at You
Like it hurts
know, me too
What should we do About it
He takes her in his arms and kisses her
She sinks in his arms
He kisses her again then falls to her knees, throwing his arms around her legs and pressing his face into the folds of her skirts
God
She runs a hand through his hair
He stands, lifting her with him until they are face-to-face and she can feel him pressing into her
After a beat: You know this is adultery
You Burn in hell for that
Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth -  - They loll on the rock, facing each other, clothes in disarray
must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall
Fortuitous even
And  don't even know your full name
Easy to fix
Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp
And 'm Josephine Sarah Marcus
My friends call me Josie
Josie
No, 'm gonna call you Sadie
hate Sadie
Well you'll always be Sadie to me
Always
Getting late
We better get back
He looks away and stands, helping her up
They go to their horses
He lifts her up into her saddle and stands awhile, arranging the folds of her skirt
After a beat: So  assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude
Look, it's too much of a tangle
already cast my lot
can't go Back and  can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is
You feel bad about this
About me
didn't mean it that way
You know you don't have to sneak
You could stay with me
know Things, Wyatt
Sweet things Could make you so happy
can't, 'm sorry
Forgive me
He mounts and rides off with a wave
She watches him awhile
- '   - Victorian photographer's studio behind the
Corral large skylight overhead illuminates the backdrop as , the prosperous-looking owner prepares his camera
Josephine is o
s
in the dressing room on the left: What mood would you like for this Picture, Miss Marcus
Any Particular occasion you're Commemorating
want to remember exactly how Looked on this day so  want you To take a picture of me
She steps out wearing a diaphonous veil shrouding her from head to toe
Though it partially obscures her form, we can see that she's completely nude underneath
Fly gasps
all of me
Fly fumbles with his camera, his composure gone
She turns to a nearby mirror, studying herself-black tresses, rounded lips, maddening curves, and smokey eyes-a dark angel
She smiles: Because 'm wonderful
- '  - Mattie lies in bed, lost in an opium dream
She snaps out of it and sits up as Wyatt enters and gives her a kiss, glancing at the half-empty laudanum bottle on the nightstand
That the bottle Lou gave you
Better go easy on that stuff
know what 'm doing
Where have You been
Out ridin'
So
how you doin'
don't know
'm all right
Really
You sure
Sure 'm sure
What is this
Wyatt sits down on the bed, suddenly intent, his face alight: Well,  was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money
Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on
And we could Stay on the move, you know
Just Keep going, see the world
Live On room service the rest of our Lives
How'd that be
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about
Just thinkin' out loud
Forget it
-  - Dark circles under his eyes, looking dreadful, Doc is at the corner table with Virgil, Behan, Ike Clanton, and the McLaurys
Josephine lounges by the piano, luscious in a white gown, singing "Frankie and Johnny" in a torchy voice
Wyatt enters, blanching at the sight of Josephine
Joyce appears at his elbow: New singer
Ain't she somehin'
Wyatt nods weakly
Josephine gives him a half-smile
Wyatt blushes
Morgan approaches
Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours
Clanton came in an hour ago, they Switched over to poker
Tried to Get him to bed but he just won't Let go
know
And nobody can make him
They go over to Doc's table and sit down
Doc beams drunkenly: Wyatt
Just in time
Pull up a chair
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc
Nonsense,  have not yet begun to Defile myself
(touches his shoulder) But Doc- won't be pawed at, thank you Very much Sorry, sorry
(puts arm around Doc) That's right
Doc can go all day And all night and then some
Doc's my man
Doc's my lovin' Man
Have another one, lovin' man
She kisses Doc
Behan nudges Wyatt: What d'you think of the singer
Nice voice
That's not what  meant
Behan gives him a wink
Wyatt shifts uneasily in his seat
This hand is down to Doc and Ike and the pot is huge
Doc shows his hand
Ike throws his cards down in a drunken rage: Son of a bitch
That's twelve Straight hands
Nobody's that lucky
The Earps stiffen as the Cheshire cat smile comes over Doc: Why, Ike, whatever do you mean
Come on, boys, take it easy
Maybe poker's not your game, Ike
know, let's have a spelling Contest
(stands) 'll wring your scrawny neck for you
(grabs him) That's enough, Clanton
You takin' his part
'm the one Was cheated
God damn pimps, You're all in it together
Nobody's in anything, Clanton, You're drunk
Go home and sleep It off
Get your God damn hands off me
Don't you ever put your hands on One of us
Don't you ever try to Man-handle a Cowboy
We'll out Your God damn pimp's heart out
Understand, pimp
Don't you threaten me, you Little- Violence seems imminent
Wyatt jumps in, separating them
Behan notices as Josephine gasps, a look of alarm crossing her face
Virgil, don't
Take it easy
Ike, Just go home and forget it, will you
ain't forgettin' nothin
Ike lurches to the bar
Behan takes Josephine aside, whispering: saw that look on your face just now
What's between you and Wyatt
Absolutely nothing
Well that certainly was a bust Want my money back
Come, Darling, let's seek our Entertainment elsewhere
Doc stands up, taking Kate's arm to leave
But he falls back down dizzily, suddenly breaking out in a sweat and coughing
What's wrong, Doc
Nothing
Not a thing
'm right As the mail
Again he tries to stand
This time he keels over onto the floor and starts coughing up blood
Wyatt rushes to him
Get a doctor
Virgil, give me a hand
They lift the unconscious Doc off the floor
Ike turns to Joyce
What's wrong with him
Lunger
- '  - Later
Doc sits up in bed, revived but looking like death warmed over, mouth gaping open, eyes swimming with every breath
stands by the bed, putting on his jacket
Your condition is quite advanced
'd say you've lost some 60 percent Of your lung tissue
Maybe more
So what does that mean
Two years, two days, hard to say
If you have any chance, it's to Stop now-smoking, drinking, Gambling, night-life
You must Have a healthy diet and most Importantly, you must have Complete rest-meaning you must Attempt to deny your marital impulse
Well, that sounds inviting
Sorry but 'm afraid you've no choice
He takes his bag and exits, leaving Doc alone with the abyss
Kate enters, going to his bedside, and starts rolling him a cigarette
How you feeling, Doc
Better
That's good
knew it wasn't nothin'
We must talk, darling
It appears We have to
redefine the nature Of our association
What's that mean, Doc
You know Don't understand when you talk up High like that
You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more
Not exactly
'm a good woman to you, Doc
Don't  always take care of you
Nobody cares for you like me
'm good woman
Yes,  know
You are a good woman
Kate smiles, licking the cigarette
She puts it in his mouth and leans over to light it so her ample bosom bulges over her bodice
As Doc stares at her chest something behind his eyes seems to shut down
He takes a long drag from the cigarette
Then again, you may be the Antichrist
-  - The cold blue light of dawn peeks through the windows
Ike drinks at the bar, brooding
He reaches behind the bar for his guns, leaning his rifle against the brass rail
Bastards think they can cheat me
Nobody cheated you, Ike
Go home
Ike reaches across the bar and slaps him
Joyce scowls, more irritated than hurt and too tired to make anything of it
The few other patrons left look up drowsily
Ike nods in drunken satisfaction, picking up his rifle: And  don't take no mouth from Any bartenders neither
There, See
Give somebody a rap on the beezer, get some God damn respect Around here
Now you tell the Earps and Doc Holliday if  see 'em on the street, 'm gonna send 'em all to hell on a shutter
You tell 'em that
Ike and the McLaurys storm off as Virgil and Morgan step out onto the street
Wyatt turns to them in disbelief: What the hell's going on
-  /  - Walking down Allen, Ike stops the group at the telegraph office: want to send a telegram
-   - We start to feel a growing sense of dread as 3 grim come galloping out of the desert toward us
Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne ride into town, trotting by the jail with the Earps looking on
Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne
Now there's six Of 'em
This is like a bad dream
Just stay calm, use your head
It'll be all right
Just the Same, though
(pauses, sighs) Guess you better swear me in
- '  - In tight on a brass-mounted wooden case
It opens to reveal a gleaming Colt
45 with an extra long barrel, the gold shield inlaid on the burr walnut grips engraved with, "To Wyatt Earp, Peacemaker
"  This is the Buntline Special, Wyatt Earp's legendary sidearm
Wyatt takes it from the case and puts it in his coat pocket as Mattie looks on
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again
Yeah, well,  swore a lot of things
-   - Behan and Jospehine watch from the hotel as the 6 Cowboys, all but Ike armed with pistols, walk side-by-side down the middle of Allen
'm terribly afraid this looks Like the end of the Earp brothers
Josephine goes pale
-  / - The Cowboys swagger by defiantly, giving the Earps sidelong glances
Meanwhile, the street starts to , townspeople beginning to notice that something is happening
Here they are again
Look at 'em
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on
Suddenly Doc appears from around a corner, a little the worse for wear in a long, dark Inverness cloak and carrying a big gold-headed walking stick
What're you doin' out of bed, Doc
What the hell's going on
've Had five people walk up to me Saying the Clantons and McLaurys Are gunning for me
-
- vacant lot behind the  Corral with Fly's Gallery on the left and the Harwood house on the right
The Cowboys stand in a knot near their horses, passing a bottle around
Like to teach those bastards a lesson
Probably already scared them to death
You call it, Ike
What're we gonna do
(grabs bottle) Gimme that
-  / - Virgil comes out of the nearby Wells Fargo office with a huge Stevens 10 gauge shotgun just as Joyce runs up
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out
They're down in That lot right now behind the Corral
Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem
You don't have to mix up in this
Doc turns on Wyatt, genuinely shocked and hurt
That's a hell of a thing for you To say to me
What the hell're we gonna do
Wait till the liquor wears off
Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives
You'll never make that stick
They're carrying guns in town
Virge, that's a misdemeanor
You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas
You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor
(pauses, thinking) No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law
(pauses) All right, Virge, your call
But Give Doc the shotgun
They'll be Less apt to get nervy if they see Him on the street howitzer
Virgil trades the shotgun for Doc's cane
Doc folds the shotgun under his cloak
They get set, waiting for Wyatt's cue
Finally: Well
Come on, boys
They start down Allen, footsteps pounding the board sidewalk, Virgil and Wyatt in front, Morgan and Doc in the rear
Bystanders step aside, trading whispers as they pass, turning onto 4th St
-
- Behan dashes around the corner into the lot, facing the Cowboys
They're on their way over here
-  /  - The Earps and Doc turn off 4th onto Fremont St
Creek Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion watch as they pass the grocer's
There they go
Look kinda like preachers
Yeah
Or undertakers
The vacant lot starts to come into view and the Earps are fighting nerves now
Fists clenched, gritting their teeth, eyes darting all over the street, they look all too human and nothing like their legend
It's only Doc, bringing up the rear, who couldn't care less
Wyatt narrows his eyes: Virge, you're makin' the arrest
You make contact, 'll back you Up
Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble
And Keep your hands on your guns
They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em
Right over the head
Wyatt,  know what 'm doin'
(sees onlookers) Look at 'em all
They love it
How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this
Just then Behan walks up holding up his hands, reassuring: You don't have to worry about a Thing
just went down there and Disarmed them
You did
Great, thanks
Come on, boys
The Earps quicken their step as Behan enters Fly's gallery
Seeing the approaching Earp party, the Cowboys glance around at each other, setting themselves
Now at the end of the sidealk, the Earps can see that the Cowboys are still armed and their relief evaporates
Wyatt mutters under his breath: Oh, great
Disarmed my ass
The Earps slow their step, gathering themselves
This is it, no turning back now
The Cowboys spread out
As the Earps get closer and closer, it seems as if the very air is electric with tension
But as they step into the street and fan out for their final approach, they suddenly do look like their legend, 4 tall figures in long black coats advancing in a line, grim and unstoppable, a fleeting moment in time frozen forever in our minds
Finally they stop
The 2 groups are facing each other, perhaps 20 feet apart
Doc raises the shotgun, the Cheshire cat smile spreading over his face
Virgil steps forward, his face set, holding up Doc's cane: We've come to arrest you
Throw Up your arms
weird moment of confusion where nobody seems to know what to do
Then Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury  their hands to their guns
The Earps instantly tense up, hands on their pistols
Virgil waves his hands frantically, afraid they've misunderstood: Hold
don't want that
Suddenly realizing what's happening, Fuller and Claiborne bolt and dash into Fly's gallery
Everyone else stands frozen, breath short, pulses pounding, each staring into the other's wide-open eyes
Then something in Billy Clanton's eyes seems to go dead and Wyatt groans under his breath as the awful realization hits him: Oh, my God
Billy and Frank jerk their pistols and the scene , everything happening in   as Wyatt draws and , knocking Frank down with a gutshot
Morgan , blowing Billy back against the wall of the Harwood house
Tom darts for the cover behind his horse as Ike dives onto Wyatt shrieking like a woman: No, no, please
don't have a gun
This fight's commenced
Get to Fightin' or get away
Wyatt hurls him aside
Ike sprints for the gallery
Tom over his saddle at Doc who tries for a shot but is blocked by the horse
Billly bounces back up, howling, and , the bullet piercing Virgil's calf
He drops to one knee
Tom  again
Doc  one barrel into the air, the  making the horse rear up, exposing Tom for a split second
Doc  again
Tom's side  into red mist, the full charge of red mist, the full charge of buckshot him into the Harwood house
Tom drops his gun and teeters into the street, talking eerie little mincing steps, already dead but still moving, like a chicken with its head cut off
Billy  again, dropping Morgan with a hole in his shoulder
'm hit
Doc pull his Lightning and    1-2-3 times, hitting Billy in the abdomen while Frank bounds back into the fight,  wildly
Virgil gets up,
The whole scene now bathed in thick smoke, the fight starts swirling into the street, each man jockeying for position
Inside the gallery, Behan and Fuller watch at the window as Ike dives in
He snatches Fuller's pistol and  through the window
Ike's bullets  past Wyatt's ear
He spins around, calling to Doc: Behind us
In a flashing move taking less than a heartbeat, Doc pivots, replacing the
38 in this right hand with his big
45, then with one pass of his left hand   quick as a machine gun burst 1-2-3-4-5 times, the bullets  through the gallery, showering Ike and the rest with splinters and broken glass
Come on
Behan hauls Ike up and they dash out the back door, Fuller and Claiborne right behind, all frantically running for their lives
Outside Billy gets to his knees, seemingly indestructible, and  at Wyatt,  Wyatt
Eyes wild and bulging, a bloody hand clutching his wounds, Frank staggers across the lot, bearing down on Doc through the smoke: got you now, you son of a bitch
You're a daisy if you do
Doc opens his arms, giving Frank a clear shot at his chest
Frank
The bullet grazes Doc's holster
Frank trudges closer, about to fire again but Doc  him through the heart while in the next millisecond Morgan  from his prone position on the ground, the big
45  carrying away the top of Frank's head
As the last shot echoes through the hills, Frank flops limply to the ground like a rag doll while out in the street his brother Tom finally runs out of steam and pitches face first in the dirt, leaving only Billy, leaning against the Harwood house, legs splayed out in front of him, absolutely shot to pieces, clicking his empty gun and wailing piteously as the smoke clears: More cartridges
Somebody load my gun
He keeps repeating it with sinking volume as townspeople step timidly into the street
Fly bends down and takes Bill's gun from his hand and the fight is officially over, having lasted only some 20 seconds
Wyatt helps Morgan to his feet as Behan strides briskly onto the scene, addressing Wyatt: All right
You're all under Arrest
Wyatt looks at him in utter disbelief
Finally: don't think 'll let you arrest Us today, Behan
Maybe tomorrow
More bystanders arrive, a crowd scene rapidly developing
The Earp women run up from the west end of Fremont
Josephine fights her way through the crowd from the east
She and Wyatt catch sight of each other
She grins, tears in her eyes
He nods, smiling
Seeing the whole thing, Behan fumes
And so does  who turns and walks away while Allie and Lou run to their men, hugging them
Meanwhile Doc stands over Frank's body, fingering the graze over his thigh, jeering under his breath: You call that shooting
(comes up to Wyatt) The McLaurys are both dead
Billy Clanton's just about gone
Wyatt nods, pocketing his gun, sadly surveying the bloody scene
Guess we did our good deed for today
-   - Fireworks  in the darkening sky as a cortege of 50 Cowboys in their finest parade down the street toward Boot Hill, the crude little grave yard, Curly Bill and Ringo in the lead, Ike right behind with the 3 coffins and a banner saying: "Murdered On The Streets Of Tombstone"
As they take places at the gravesite Wyatt approaches Curly Bill
'm sorry
If there was any other- know
Just did what you had to
That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike
Don't worry about it
Wyatt nods, tips his hat, walks off
Looking after him, Curly Bill whispers: Don't worry about a thing - '  - Morgan lies in bed, his shoulder in bandages
Wyatt sits by him How you doin', boy
Fine
Better
Morgan looks out the window, staring at nothing
He looks tired, older, all the fun and youthful zest gone from his face
You were right
It's nothin' like thought
almost wish
know, kid
know
Me too
Wyatt touches his arm, a look of unutterable sadness in his eyes
This is the one thing he didn't want for his little brother
- '  - The Cowboys are gathered around a huge bonfire, sparks drifting up toward the heavens, faces vivid in the firelight like an ancient warrior host
Curly Bill faces them, bottle in hand: Here's to the memory of Billy Clanton and Tom and Frank McLaury
They went out real Cowboys, dead game right up to Their last kick
They won their Places at the big table with Davy Crockett and Wild Bill and Old Man Clanton
They're up there Right now tradin' shots with 'em
And they'll never be forgot
Not Ever
Hundred years from now There'll be men settin' around a Campfire, passin' a bottle, Tellin' stories about those boys
They're what you call immortal
And  say God bless 'em
They all drink, long and deep, Ringo wiping away tears
Then: All right, first we hang back, Just bide away till everybody Thinks this's blown over
Then
-  /, '  - Mattie irons shirts in the adjoining bedroom while Wyatt finishes shaving in the dressing room, wiping foam from his face, looking in the cabinet for a towel
Opening the bottom drawer, a nest of small brown bottles clatters onto the floor
Laudanum bottles, all empty
Mattie looks up as Wyatt comes out, bottle in hand: Mattie
What about this
(looks up, keeps ironing) need it
'Least you admit it
Admit what, 'm an opium fiend
No, Wyatt,  just said  need it
need something to keep me warm At night
Look, Mattie,  know you're- You know nothing
What you don't Know would fill a book
Jesus, Feel like it's when you're around need it most
You're never Yourself, you never relax
Never
Everything's so stiff and dead
You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself
Oh, You smile sometimes, 've even Seen you laugh
But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm
And  get cold, Wyatt
get so cold
(pauses) What's between you and that Jew woman
This catches Wyatt off-guard
He looks at her
She sneers
Then: All right, look
can make it Right,  can make this up to you, Mattie
can,  swear
Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you
Right out loud so can hear
Tell her she's Nothing, tell her she's nobody, Just dirt
Will you do that
Wyatt falls silent
Mattie stands, staring at him a moment, then: Until you can do that we've got Nothing to talk about, Wyatt
Nothing
Now leave me alone
She keeps ironing
Wyatt looks as if a building fell on him
-   - Behan comes out of Nellie Cashman's, spots Josephine going down Toughnut
He catches up to her, pacing her
She keeps walking
Listen,  want to talk to you
Not now
don't have time
(grabs her) saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight
Listen to Me
You're mine
Understand
You're my woman and 'm your man
My man
You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men
Do you Actually believe after that Could see you as my man
You're Just a dirty little fixer
You whore
You filthy whore
reaches into frame, spinning Behan around
Morgan stands there, arm in a sling, red in his eye: You don't talk that way to a Female human being
Not ever
Look,  don't want to take Advantage of an injured man but You better- With his good arm Morgan  Behan in the mouth
Behan drops like a leaf, as much to avoid a further injury as from the blow
Morgan turns to Josephine, leading her away
Across the street Curly Bill and Ringo share a flask, watching, Ringo looking even odder than usual
Curly Bill chuckles: So she's Wyatt's slice now
Looks Like we got another name for the Tally book
-  / - Later
The Earp brothers stand in front of the Oriental
Dropped him, that was it
Sorry If  made a worse mess for you
'm the one made a mess
Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing
Wyatt looks down, miserable
Virgil looks up at the sky: Getting warmer
Guess spring's comin'
Just then Morgan sees Breakenridge passing by in silence
Hello, Billy
say hello, Deputy
(turns to them) don't want to talk to you
Those Men you killed were my friends
'm just a nothing, but if Wasn't 'd fight you, 'd fight You right now
So  don't wanna Talk to you
He hurries away, eyes tearing up
The Earps look on in amazement
All they ever did was make fun of him
Sister Boy should've stuck around
They turn
liquored-up  stands behind them on the sidewalk like an apparition, murder in his eyes, hands thrust into the pockets of a long black buffalo coat, ivory gunbutts peeking out
What d'you want, Ringo
want your blood and  want you Souls and  want them both right now
Don't want any more trouble, Ringo
(steps up to Wyatt) Well you got trouble and it Starts with you
'm not gonna fight you, there's No money in it
Sober up
Come On, boys
Wyatt turns into the Oriental
His brothers follow
Ringo howls: Wretched slugs, don't any of you Have the guts to play for blood
'm your huckleberry
Ringo turns
Doc stands there, smiling that Cheshire cat smile
That's just my game
All right, lunger
Have at it
They face each other, eyes blazing, about to reach critical mass
On three
You call it
Here it come: one-two- At the last possible instant, Curly Bill flashes into frame along with Stillwell and Spence, grabbing Ringo from behind while the Earps step in front of Doc
Johnny, don't, Jesus
Come on, Son
(turns to Earps) Never mind
He's drunk
They haul Ringo up the street, out of earshot
Ringo is boiling: want them spitting blood
Easy, Johnny
Now ain't the time
(turns to others) tell you, boys, even 'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit
God have mercy
He pulls Ringo into a doorway, away from the others
Tears in his eyes, clawing the air, Ringo is beside himself
There's no God, there's no devil, hate the God damn world
want To die
Easy, son
You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All
Come on, boy, let's kick South
Down to the old playground
-   - An adobe rancho in the Sonora desert, small, humbly furnished
Inside a Mexican family, 3 children, a husband and young wife eat dinner
Suddenly Curly Bill and Ringo  , guns drawn, shouting in Spanish
Everyone freezes and as the children start crying we feel the family's sense of inner terror
Curly Bill looks the trembling young wife over, nodding at Ringo: See son, there is a God after all
-  / - Nightfall and the wind  down the street, kicking up dust in swirling columns
of lightning streaks down from the purple clouds and a  crashes in our ears, echoing through town into the hills, making the horses neigh and fidget
-  - But inside it's bright and warm
Florentino is alone at the bar, nursing a drink while Wyatt deals for Morgan and a few others
Virgil looks out at the storm, shaking his head: Gonna be one of those nights
- '  - The Cowboys are gathered on a rise
Curly Bill stands before them, silhouetted against the boiling sky, arms outstretched, exulting in the storm's fury
He turns to his men, eyes ablaze: All right, boys
Now's the time To get woolly
- '   - Josephine sits by the window, reading Swinburne
at the door
She answers it
Behan enters
She bristles, but: Easy
just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here
Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play
None of 'em
don't understand
You will after tonight
Bet on it
- , '  - Allie and Louisa sip tea by a blazing fire in the hearth, warming themselves against the storm's cold
Mattie sits nearby, sewing
God, it's a cold night
Come up To the fire, Mattie
Suddenly there's a  at the door
Louisa looks out the window
Outside is the tall silhouette of a  in a dark cloak
It looks like a woman
Allie opens the door
Josephine enter, breathless, comes into the parlor
Mattie sits up in shock
The others gather round
Please,  know it's awful me Coming here, but listen,  can't Say why, but  think something is- Another
Allie goes to the window
There's a weird sense of deja vu as outside we again see a cloaked woman's Now who in
It's another woman
Allie starts to open the door but Josephine suddenly leaps up and: No
Look out
With her dancer's quickness she dashes across the parlor, grabbing Allie and pulling her to the floor just as a tremendous   rips through the open doorway
The chandelier overhead explodes, showering the screaming women with broken glass and a harsh   cuts through the air as the shrouded figure dashes into the darkness: ' Everybody dies
-  - The sound of the gunshots are lost in the wind and thunder as Virgil gets up, yawning: Getting late
Guess 'll turn in
Bundle up, Virge
Cold out there
Virgil nods, exiting with a wave
Wyatt and Morgan keep playing, hardly noticing as moments later, Florentino walks out
-    & 5TH  - Virgil turns off Allen onto 5th, the wind whipping his coattails
He glances up as Florentino walks by, crossing 5th and ducking into a doorway
Virgil stops
seems to be moving in the shadows of an unfinished building on the opposite side of 5th
-  - echoes outside, muffled by wind
Morgan looks up: That thunder's sure somethin'
That didn't sound like thunder
Moments later Virgil walks back in, pale, hatless, a blank look on his face
He moves with odd, shuffling steps, holding himself sideways
Wyatt and Morgan exchange puzzled glances, then: Virgil
Wyatt
Virgil does an unsteady stutter-step, his face taking on a pleading, almost childlike look of panic
But as he turns his body toward Wyatt we suddenly see that his whole left side is in bloody shreds, his left arm dangling unnaturally by a few gory ribbons of flesh
His voice is a frightened sob: Wyatt
He starts to swoon
Wyatt rushes over and grabs him as
-   () - The hotel room where they've taken Virgil
He's on the bed, wrapped in bandages, semi-conscious
Wyatt and Morgan stand in the doorway with Doc and the women
Allie is at Virgil's side, hands over her mouth as Dr
Goodfellow speaks in somber tones: 'm afraid your husband's been Very badly hurt
had to remove The entire left elbow joint
What That means is, well 'm afraid- Oh, no, no, no,
She starts wailing
Suddenly alert, Virgil sits up, taking her in his big right arm, pulling her close, his voice calm, reassuring: No, no, don't worry, honey Still got one arm left to hug you with
She buries her face in his chest and sobs
He holds her, rocking her back and forth
Wyatt turns away, shutting his eyes
-   () - Virgil lies in bed, staring blankly into space
Wyatt sits at his side, hands over his face while Allie hovers in the b
g
It's all my fault
If  hadn't been So damn smart, if 'd just
Oh God, Virge, 'm so sorry
Look, Wyatt,  don't want to talk Right now
Virgil, what am  going to do
For God's sake, just leave me alone
Virgil grimaces in hopeless agony
Allie touches Wyatt's arm
He doesn't want to talk now
Wyatt stands, backing away
He turns pleadingly to Mattie standing in the doorway
She looks away
He walks out
-   - Wyatt comes into the lobby and freezes as McMasters approaches
Wyatt starts to walk by him, but McMasters steps into his path: No, wait
Please
know nothin' say'll fix things but  want You to know it wasn't me
No
Brothers to the bone, right
Not anymore, not after this
Wyatt looks into McMasters' eyes and we can see he means it
-  - Morgan is by himself in the empty saloon, calmly shooting pool, his dog jumping enthusiastically at every shot as Wyatt enters
Get down, boy
Morgan, are you crazy
They're Out gunning for us
What the Hell're you doin'
What's it look like
They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, 'm not crawlin' into my hole
Morg, use your head
am usin' it, Wyatt
Been Wonderin' how the hell we got in This tangle
You know they hit Clum's house, too
Shot up his wife
His wife
Who ever heard of That
Men sneakin' around in the Dark, back-shootin', scarin' Women
They're bugs, Wyatt
You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live
Ain't no live And let live with bugs
know,  was wrong
But Morg, Look, we got to get out
Listen to yourself, Wyatt
Lie Down and crawl or you might get Hurt
What kinda talk is that
That's Virgil lyin' over there, Wyatt
Our own brother
Ruined For life
No sir,  ain't going No place
You want to go, fine
'm stayin' right here and have It out with those bastards
Morgan pulls back his vest, revealing Virgil's badge
Wyatt drops into a corner chair, defeated
Morgan makes a shot, leaving only the 8 ball
few beats
Seeing Wyatt's misery, Morgan softens, poking him with the cue
Wyatt looks up
Morgan taps the middle pocket
Wyatt shakes his head
How much you wanna bet
Wyatt holds up his watch
Morgan frowns
Wyatt raises his brows: just got it fixed
You're on
Morgan has to lean over the table but he sinks the 8 ball, looking over at Wyatt in triumph
Wyatt applauds, rolling his eyes just as a   into the wall by his head
Wyatt dives for the floor as   pierces the window
Wyatt jumps up, bounding to the door to see several  cash into the darkness
Wyatt turns back and freezed
Morgan lies across the table with one leg dangling over the edge, jerking and shuddering involuntarily
Wyatt rushes to him
The dog whines as Doc rushes in with Kate and McMasters
Wyatt is trembling
No, no
Get the doctor
Jesus Christ
-  - The curious crowd outside, watching through the windows
Morgan is on the pool table, lying on his side with his shirt pulled up
The dog cowers in the corner, whining while Dr
Goodfellow digs into the wound with a steel probe, making Morgan writhe in perfect agony
The doctor turns to Wyatt: Hold him
Wyatt takes Morgan in his arms
The doctor probes
Morgan jerks violently
Suddenly we hear a blood-curdling
Louisa is in the doorway, tearing her hair, lost in utter hysterics
Oh, no, get her out of her
Jesus
And now the whole scene sinks into hellish confusion with the dog whimpering, Louisa shrieking as others restrain her, and Morgan gives a violet jerk, breaking Wyatt's grip
The doctor snarls, about at the end of his rope
said hold him, God damn it
Somebody shut that dog up
Morgan takes Wyatt's arm, his voice like a child's
You were right, Wyatt
They got Me good
Don't let 'em get you Too
Will somebody get the damn dog out- Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'
Easy Morg, don't think about that now
Isn't true
can't see a damn thing
Tears well up in Wyatt's eyes
He touches his brother's face
Morgan's eyelids start fluttering
Wyatt squeezes his hand
Morgan
Morgan
The dog starts howling, long and loud and pitiful-and in the next moment the air is  with howls as every dog and coyote for miles joins in the mourning
Wyatt backs away from his dead brother and trudges out onto the sidewalk, staring at the blood on his hands
Standing in the crowd across the street, Josephine sees Wyatt and starts for him
Behan grabs her
She wrenches free and with the whole town watching, starts running toward Wyatt
Seeing her, Wyatt backs away in horror, shaking his head: No, no, get away, get away from me
Wyatt
She keeps coming
Wyatt panics
Finally, in desperation: Whore
Filthy whore
Get away From me
She pauses, unable to believe her ears, then runs away crying
Fuming with rage, Kate starts after Wyatt
Doc pulls her back: Can't you see why he did it
The howls continue as Wyatt trudges down the street alone
Suddenly he doubles over, clutching his abdomen in agony, staring at his bloody hands
-   - The wagon bearing Morgan's pine coffin waits in the street, hitched and ready
Virgil is up front with the women, arm in a sling, pale
Doc and Kate wait on horses nearby
Finished loading, Wyatt looks around
People line the street, watching in silence
Clum and his wounded wife turn away from the window of their lodgings next door, unable to meet his gaze
The very air feels charged with paranoia and recrimination, as if the whole town has suddenly become morally radio-active
Bystanders gape as Josephine steps out of the hotel, regal and impervious as a queen, wearing a gawking scorn like a mink coat, her little white dog scampering after her
Passing Behan, he gives her nasty look and spits
She doesn't even break stride
Lounging in front of the Crystal Palace with the other Cowboys, Stillwell gives Curly Bill an enquiring look
Naw, she's nobody
Wyatt junked her
Passing Wyatt, she doesn't even glance at him
Doc sighs: And so she walked out of our Lives forever
Without a word Wyatt climbs onto the wagon and shakes the reins, driving off
He pulls up in front of the Cowboys
They make a show of pretending to hide their guns
Wyatt looks straight ahead: want you to know it's over
We're leaving and we're not Coming back
Well
'bye
(sniffs) Hey, you smell that
Smells like Something died
(stifling a laugh) Oh, Jesus, Johnny
Allie's eyes flare, Louisa stifles a sob
The Cowboys snicker
Wyatt clenches his teeth, still staring straight ahead, and drives on
few beats then Curly Bill turns to Ike: Take Frank and finish it
-  ,  - train pours steam onto the platform in puffs and clouds while 2 porters load Morgan's coffin into a boxcar
Up ahead, Mattie and Louisa fumble with luggage while Allie boosts Virgil into a passenger car
As we  the conductor's voice shouting, " 'Board
", Ike and Stillwell emerge from the shadows near the scales, crouched behind shotguns
They exchange nods and start forward, cocking their weapons, squinting through the steam: That's Virgil with the women
But Where the hell's Wyatt
Right behind you, Stillwell
They spin around
Wyatt stands behind them, looking down the barrels of Virgil's big 10 gauge
Stillwell raises his shotgun, Wyatt
Stillwell hits the floor in a crumpled heap, his torso a smoking bundle of bloody rags
Screams Page 87 cut off right side Page 88 missing Rest of us're 3 months out of Independece but we're from Carthage, Illinois originally
Carthage, really
'm from Monmouth
Another Illinois man
Practical Neighbors
Step down, Marshal
Have a feed
-    - Lucinda's ever-silent son sits at a nearby wagon, staring at Wyatt while Lucinda rolls dough, lovely as ever
Just finished telling his story, Wyatt sits by the fire with the wagonmaster and several others
They shaker their head: Ain't got law, ain't got nothin'
Only thing between us and the Animals
Always the way it goes, Though
Only way to down an Illinois man's from behind, the Dogs don't dare face 'em
Mr
Lincoln, Wild Bill, now your Brothers:  Illinois men all and All downed from behind by dirty Dogs and Democrats
Guess an Ordinary man'd be out for Vengeance but  don't figure That'll answer here
It's a Reckoning you're after
If the Lord is my friend
Let not your heart be faint, let Your arm be steel-that's all you Need of the Lord
Wyatt pauses, nodding, suddenly understanding the truth of it
Looking up, his eyes meet those of Lucinda
She smiles, wiping flour from her hands
Wyatt smiles thoughtfully, moved by this unexpected encounter
-    - Next morning
Doc gallops into camp with McMasters, Texas Jack Vermillion, and Turkey Creek Jack Johnson, exchanging greetings with Wyatt who leads him over to the center of the camp, then: Know why you're here
Way ahead of you, Wyatt
You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan
Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers
They're nothing
They're nobody
want the Cowboys
All of 'em Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory
Are you out of your mind
What on Earth'd make us- (takes out wad of bills) 'll pay you 500 each in advance And 'll mount you on those
He points to his 5 magnificent blacks tied nearby
They look them over as Wyatt takes out a stack of warrants
Got a sheaf of federal warrants
Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served
That means we got the Cowboys without quarter
The Black flag, brother
No Prisoners, no mercy, amen
(to Johnson) 500
Year's wages
And  never even saw a horse like that
You crazy
It can't be done
It might be done
If we hit the Waterholes through the southern Dragoons, the Whetstones and Huachucas, we could take 'em on In pieces, run off their herds
(faces Wyatt) Keep your money, 'll show you Where those waterholes are
Just Promise me you'll finish it
No Matter what happens you'll see it Through to the end
'll have Your hand on that
They shake
Vermillion and Johnson confer in whispers, then: We come through this in one Piece, can we keep the horses
Wyatt nods
Vermillion nods to Johnson who crouches down with a pair of dice
He makes one pass, two passes
Finally: Crapped out
Okay, we're in
-   / - The thoroughbreds are saddled and waiting, each with a rifle in a scabbard and a double-barreled shotgun across the saddle fork
Lucinda's son looks on with gathering awe as Wyatt's men, each carrying 2 pistols, face their boss
The minute we start we'll be Going against local and county Law
If we fail the
Government won't be able to lift finger to help us
Nevertheless want you to understand we carry The full force and authority of The law of this land
They exchange glances, each man feeling a little shiver at the magnitude of what they're about to attempt
Wyatt faces them: Raise your right hands
Do you Solemnly swear to uphold the laws And constitution of the United States of America and to protect her citizens to the best of your Ability, even at the cost of your Own life
All chorus, " do", except for Doc who rolls his eyes
Finally: Oh
All right
Wyatt hands each a Federal Deputy's badges
Doc waves his away: You know why 'm here
My Hypocrisy only goes so far
Wyatt shrugs
They mount up, about to begin, but suddenly: Wait
Lucinda runs up to Wyatt, reaching up and tying a blue and gold silk scarf around his neck
Your colors
Wyatt nods his surprised thanks as the wagonmaster steps up: Good luck, boys
And give 'em hell
They shake hands then Wyatt motions to his men
They take off at a graceful lope, riding through camp toward the deadfall and the desert beyond
Unable to contain himself any longer, Lucinda's son bounds up onto a wagon, waving and shouting, spurring them on with a spontaneous frontier toast: ' Wyatt Earp, the two-gun man, Whistling death and bloody Murder
Wyatt the widow-maker, Avenging and bright, purple Poison on horseback with Lightning in his eye and thunder In his heart
Wyatt and his he- Devils, holy terrors and true, Five black centaurs blowin' fire And quicksilver
Ride out and Charge and shoot and strike and Cleave and hack and thrust home
Don't let up and give no rest and Never call retreat till the last One's smashed and smote and Runnin' for cover
Best 'em all And break 'em up and bang their Heads together in a bunch and Give no quarter though they be Ten times ten thousand
Wyatt turns in the saddle, sweeping off his hat with a cavalier's flourish as he and his men take the deadfall in a single bound and pass into the desert
An immigrant grabs his infant son, lifting him up
What're you doing
Someday he'll be able to say he Was there when Wyatt Earp rode Out to bring the law
Music up, avenging and bright, as Wyatt and his men ride through the desert, 5 abreast on their giant chargers, glossy black coats shimmering in the sunlight, hoofbeats pounding in unison
All right, let's wring 'em out
They break into a dead run, streaking across the frame
As they crest a rise the ground seems to drop from under them and for a single perfect moment it appears as if they're airborne, flying across the skyline like the winged horsemen of myth
Johnson turns to Vermillion, laughing at the sheer joy of being alive: Like flyin', son
Just like flyin'
-   - The sun just starts to dip behind the near end of the ridge overlooking the camp where on one side Florentino and several Cowboys sit in a circle, playing poker while others recline on bedrolls, laughing and drinking
On the other side, at the foot of the ridge, Spence, Pony Deal, and 2 others crouch over a fire, cooking
Suddenly the cattle nestled under the far end of the ridge start bleating
Spence turns to Pony Deal who shrugs: Maybe they smell a wolf
(turns to other Cowboy) Go up there and take a look
The Cowboy mount a pinto pony and lopes up and over the far side of the ridge
Spence and the others continue cooking
Moments later a   comes echoing over the ridge like thunder
The Cowboys look up, startled
Pony Deal points: Look
The pinto gallops riderless back over the ridge
The Cowboys exchange confused glances, all attention focused on the far end of the ridge
Then the five black horsemen ride out of the sun, gliding like apparitions up and over the near end of the ridge and bearing down on the unsuspecting camp with the speed of a flame
They are within a few yards of the fire when Johnny Barnes suddenly spots them and: Look out
Spence and the others turn and just have time to gasp before Wyatt and his horsemen  into them with terrifying impact, the bodies disappearing under their horses' hooves
The Cowboys recoil in total shock, jumping up from bedrolls, stumbling in confusion, scrambling to get out of the way as the possemen plow through the fire and roar into camp, pistols in air, horses rearing and snorting
United States Marshals
Reach
Everyone freezes
worried-looking Florentino shrinks back behind the others, trying not to be spotted
Meanwhile Doc leans down and pokes his pistol into a nearby Cowboy's forehead
Say something witty
They herd the Cowboys over to one side of camp, shouting, "Get over there
",  "Move it
", etc
But Barnes brazens up to Wyatt: Hey, you can't come- loud crack as Wyatt's quirt lays his face open to the bone
One more word and 'll blind you
Get over there
(to McMasters) Hey brother, what're you doin'- ain't your brother,  ain't None of your damn brothers
Move
All right, run 'em off
Doc and Wyatt cover the Cowboys while the others scatter their herd with pistol shots
Indignant, Swilling sneers at Wyatt: Bastard
Stinkin' bastard
Like To eat you blood raw
queer look in his eye, Wyatt dismounts and faces Swilling
All right, breed
Dig in
And then Wyatt  him in the jaw with a straight right hand
Swilling drops like a stone
Wyatt hauls him up by the hair and hammers him left-right-left, steps around, digs down, and pile-drives a left hook to his gut
Swilling topples back into a seated position then rolls over with a moan and passes out
Meanwhile, seeing his chance, Florentino ducks down and makes for the remuda as Doc looks down at Swilling
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut
(faces Cowboys) Felt his liver go on that last One
Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours
At the remuda Florentino leaps on a horse and gallops off bareback
McMasters point, pulling his rifle from its scabbard: Florentino
He's getting away
Drop his horse
McMasters draws a bead on the retreating form with his '76 Winchester and
100 yards away, the bullet hits Florentino's horse in the shoulder with a "thunk"
It drops, tumbling end over end and plunging Florentino face-first into the ground
He jumps up, spitting out a mouthful, and starts running
Wyatt leaps on this black and it streaks forward, closing the distance in seconds
Florentino gasps and runs faster, pulling a bellygun from his sash, Wyatt almost on top of him
He turns and  on the run
branch next to Wyatt's head
Wyatt keeps coming, drawing his Buntline, impervious, unstoppable
Florentino turns for another shot just as the black  into him, sending him flying and tumbling him down an embankment
He scrambles to his feet as Wyatt dismounts, starting toward him with deliberate step, eyes blazing, long-barreled pistol held in front of him
Florentino backs up in terror, gun at his side, shaking his head: don't kill your brother Don't even know him
was only Lookout
It was money, they give Me twelve dollars
It was money
human life
Twelve dollars
Wyatt nods, still coming, cold-blooded murder in his eye
Florentino screams, raising his gun: No
Wyatt , blasting Florentino to the ground
He advances, over and over, emptying his gun into him
- '  - The Cowboys watch as Wyatt gallops up, dragging Florentino's bullet-riddled body behind him
He reins up, un-dallying the rope
The corpse flops at their feet
They jump back, horrified
Look at him
That's how you'll All end up if you don't get it Through your head: it's over, The Cowboys're finished
Forever
So tell the others and get out of The Territory 'cause next time Leave no one alive
Understand
No one
You been warned
(to his men) All right, burn it
Everything
As his men prepare to fire the camp, several Cowboys move to pick up Floretino's body, but: Leave that trash where it lays
- '  - Wyatt and his men ride through the blazing camp, the flames lighting up his eyes like a demon's
-   - The possemen crouch by their fire
Doc sits shivering miserably by himself as Vermillion turns to Johnson
You know, we might just pull this off
Not so sure
Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in
(pauses) Should've held out for more money
Meanwhile Wyatt and McMasters confer over a map
Wyatt points to a specific point on the map, very interested: know that cut
You mean there's waterhole near there
But this time they'll be ready
We'll see about that
- /  - Now we see what so interested Wyatt-it's the same mountain cut where he and Josephine met
Pony Deal and a party of 10 Cowboys ride through the desert 300 yards from the cut, pushing a herd
Keep your eyes open for Earp's Bunch
Swear to God, ain't gonna Get the drop on us this time
1ST Riders up ahead
four, five
It's them all right
They look
Wyatt and his horsemen stand waiting at the mouth of the cut
They tense, the 1st Cowboy squinting against the sun
At the cut, Wyatt and his men poise themselves, Doc nodding: They saw us
Here they come
The Cowboys charge forward, outnumbering them better than 2 to 1 and only 100 yards away
The possemen choke up on their reins, alerting their horses for action as: Wait
wait
steady
75 yards and the first shots  out, richochetting off the walls of the cut
The others blanch but Wyatt stays cool, waiting, 50 yards
40 yards
till we can see their eyes and: Now
They whirl around and disappear into the cut
The Cowboys keep coming
Wyatt's group reaches the little trail leading up the wall of the cut he used to avoid Josephine
They clamber up the side of the cut at a bounding gallop, unseen, as moments later the Cowboys gallop by and continue through into the desert on the other side
Wyatt's group careens up and around the high mountain wall as if on a roller-coaster, following the tiny, narrow path at a breathtaking clip, the trail finally plunging them back into the draw behind the Cowboys
They speed up to the opposite mouth of the cut, drawing their pistols as the Cowboys gallop into the desert before them, unaware
Lay on
They  forward
Seeing the empty desert ahead, the Cowboys pull up, looking around in confusion
Suddenly a of  hits them from behind, knocking several from the saddle
They spin around just as Wyatt's group  into them -, guns , Cowboys tumbling from the saddle left and right, horses rearing and toppling over backwards
Run
The remaining Cowboys turn and dash into the desert
Wyatt shouts: Come on
Wyatt's group , the thoroughbreds closing the distance in seconds
Vermillion stands in his stirrups, roaring like an animal as he  into them, swinging his quirt like a saber and  a Cowboy across the face, making him tumble to the earth and bounce over the rocks like a rag doll
McMasters closes with another, throwing an arm around him and him from the saddle,  his neck
Doc overtakes a 3rd, jams his pistol into his face and  point-blank, blackening his face with soot and  out the back of his head as he falls
Reins in his teeth, shotgun at his shoulder, Johnson comes up behind a 4th and
The Cowboy's head  in a cloud of pink vapor, the body dropping like a stone
Wyatt bears down on Pony Deal at a dead run
Pony Deal turns in the saddle and  at him
We feel a surge of breathless exhilaration as Wyatt swings out of the saddle like a Commanche and ducks his body down against the side of his horse, hiding in its lee
Pony Deal turns for another shot only to see an apparently riderless horse overtake him
But in the next instant Wyatt darts around under his horse's neck and , blowing Pony Deal head-over-heels off the back of his horse
Wyatt bounds back into the saddle as McMasters rides by, drawing a bead with his rifle on the lone survivor, the 1st Cowboy
Only a few yards in front of them, he whips his horse frantically, trying to get away
McMasters is about to fire when Wyatt rides up, deflecting the shot
The Cowboy makes it over a rise and disappears
What'd you do that for
So he can tell the story
-   - Curly Bill studies a map drawn in the dirt, listening with Ringo, Ike, etc
while the 1st Cowboy describes the battle: 1ST Didn't make any sense
One minute We're chasin' 'em, next they're Right on top of us
We couldn't Stop 'em, they got everybody
Just everybody
Easy now, it's only five men
Been havin' it their way 'cause They been surprising you
Hittin' The waterholes and that Judas McMasters is showin' 'em right Where they are
Pretty damn cute
But nobody's cute as me
(points to dirt map) Next up's Black Draw
But that Smart Wyatt'll say no, that's Where they'll expect us to hit, We'll hit the one after
Iron Springs
That's where they show Next
Only 'm gonna be there First
And throw a little party
Curly Bill grins, his coarse face radiant in the firelight
- '  - Doc sits by the fire, shaking and shivering and sweating
Vermillion comes up and tries to cover him with a blanket, but: Don't touch me
Sorry
He pulls back
Doc wraps himself in the blanket
After a beat: You really look awful
Not half as bad as  feel
Then why in hell're you doin' This
You ought to be in bed
Wyatt Earp is my friend
Hell,  got lot's of friends
(turns, glares at him) don't
Meanwhile at the other side of the camp, Wyatt and McMasters huddle over the map, Johnson walks up: Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt
don't know if He's gonna make it
There's no reasoning with him
(points to map) Next waterhole's Black Draw
We Could be there by mid-morning
They're wise by now
Which is Next, Iron Springs
Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs
-   - camp near a waterhole with 2 Cowboys crouched by a fire, sipping coffee
Wyatt's men ride up to the rocks overlooking it and dismount, unseen
There they are
No herd though
We'll go around that way, come up on foot
They pull shotguns from their saddles and start down over the rocks on foot, creeping up on the camp, seemingly undetected
But suddenly the Cowboys by the fire dive behind a log and: Ambush
Get down
And suddenly the deadfall on the opposite side Vermillion takes a graze and drops with the others, hugging the rocks
bullet  into a rock at Johnson's head, biting his face with fragments, making him wince: Christ
Hunched behind the logs on the opposite side with 15 more Cowboys, Curly Bill raises his head, grinning and shouting: Hey, Wyatt
How the hell are you
Wyatt and his men react to his voice
The fire continues
Suddenly there's  in the rocks above them
Doc points: Look
Got some boys workin' around Those rocks behind you
Another Minute or two, gonna have you in crossfire
How do you like that
Seeing the spot they're in, McMasters turns to the silent Wyatt: He's right
They get set up in Them rocks it's the end for us
And now for the first time we see fear in these men, actual naked fear
But Curly Bill laughs, having the time of his life
'Course you could give yourselves up and we could have a party
Then what larks
Crouched by Curly Bill, Barnes chuckles
confident ripple of laughter goes through the Cowboy line-they know they've got them
On the other side, Vermillion shakes his head grimly
Ain't takin' me alive, damn it
McMasters looks at the still silent Wyatt, shrugging helplessly: Think of somethin' fast or we're cooked
They really are at the end of their rope, all looking to Wyatt for a solution
He remains silent
Then suddenly, in this supreme moment, a strange, almost supernatural calm seems to come over him and he says simply: No
What
No
And now we can almost hear the ether  in our ears as Wyatt takes his shotgun and, while the others look on in horror, rises to his feet
Wyatt
Bullets  around him
Doc jumps up to grab him but a drives him back down
Wyatt advances quickly across the clearing, walking right into the teeth of their guns, repeating: No
Wyatt's clothes jerk and ripple as bullets pass through, but he just keeps coming
Seeing this, Curly Bill also stands, a weird, manic elation coming over him
He hoots and howls: Look at that
Yeah
Come and get Some, boy
No
Curly Bill waves away his men's fire and walks toward Wyatt, 12 gauge shotgun in one hand,
45 in the other,  away
Let me, let me, yeah
Die, you Bastard
No
Curly Bill  again
Wyatt's hat flies off
He again, digging a gash in Wyatt's boot-heel
Now Curly Bill takes dead aim with his
45 and--it's empty
He tosses it aside
Suddenly a sharp wind gusts up, making the tails of Wyatt's duster swirl around him like a halo as he advances
Eyes wild with battle rage, Curly Bill quickly raises his shotgun
Die
Son of a bitch
Die
He
Wyatt's coattails  into swirling shreds as he takes deliberate aim with his mighty 10 gauge, hissing through clenched teeth: No
And with that, Wyatt lets go with
Curly Bill's mid-section , the huge double-charge of buckshot The other Cowboys flinch as they're sprayed with flecks of blood and gore
Barnes screams: Jesus Christ
No
Eyes burning like two twin hells, Wyatt pulls his Buntline and Barnes doubles over
Wyatt  again
Barnes drops
The others recoil, their faces looking as if they are living in a waking nightmare as Wyatt advances on them, Another goes down
Doc leaps from the rocks, gun in hand, and: Come on
Now they all rise and  , advancing 4 abreast, a driving the remaining Cowboys off, running for their horses
Wyatt keeps snapping his empty gun as the others run up
No
Beside himself, Doc helps Wyatt to a nearby rock, sitting him down and examining him, running his hands all over his body
The others  at the Cowboys retreating on horseback
Wyatt, my God
You're shot to pieces
No
Yeah, better run, you bastards
(turn to Doc) How is he
(looks up, amazed) don't believe it
He's clean
What
But  saw 'em- 'm telling you, there isn't a Mark on him
They look
Meanwhile Wyatt starts to tremble
-  - They're camped by a running stream
Wyatt stares into the fire
Doc crouches opposite him, shaking his head: 'm a man without fear, Wyatt Literally don't care if  live or Die
But even  can't fight human Instinct
Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me,  duck
But you
what on earth were You thinking about
don't know
It all happened so Fast
If 'd had a chance to Think about it  guess  probably Would've been scared but
Swear To God, Doc,  just don't know
At the other end of camp, Vermillion and Johnson sit together
After a beat: Hey Creek, you ever see anything Like that before
Never even heard of anything like it
Vermillion nods
Both look shaken to the very core of their beings
Finally: just thought of somethin' Never thought about before
(pauses, looks at him) don't want to go to hell
-  - Wyatt sits by the fire, sipping coffee
Vermillion and Johnson approach
Johnson drops a wad of money on Wyatt's bedroll
Wyatt looks up in surprise: Talked it over
We decided we Don't need the money
Took out 13 Dollars each, though
Federal Posseman's fee
That all right
Sure
One thing
We come through this Alive, can we keep the badges
Wyatt nods, picks up the money and quietly moves off toward the stream by himself
Moments later, McMasters approaches: Where's Wyatt
Down at the creek
Walking on water
-   - Ringo crouches by the fire with the other Cowboys, his face a deeply shadowed mask
2 Iron Springs survivors stand before him: 1ST We hit him half a dozen times but He just kept comin', walked right Up to Curly Bill with that 10 Gauge and blew him up
Curly Bill
He killed Curly Bill
Ringo starts making strange little inarticulate sounds, inhaling and exhaling like an animal, eyes swimming in panic
2ND He didn't just kill him, he Burned him down
Blew him in Half
mean all the way in half, Like a melon
Then he turned Around with that big Colt and Killed Johnny Barnes, shot up a Couple more 'fore we got out of there
But it was his face, you should've seen his face
He's just a man
1ST You didn't see his face Ringo looks up at them, suddenly dead calm, his face a blank
You see my face, don't you
Out of nowhere, Ringo draws and  2 shots so quickly they sound like one
The 2 survivors drop with bullets through their brains
The others jump, transfixed by the insane brutality of what he's just done
Ringo draws himself up, in full possession of the situation, the new leader, fearsome, matchless: Everybody get this through their Heads
Wyatt Earp dies
'm Running the show now and 'm Telling you, Earp dies
His men Too
They all die
Understand
We're gonna kill 'em
For what They did to Curly Bill we're Gonna ride 'em into the ground And slaughter 'em like rabbits
'Cause this is my time, children
This is where  get woolly
-   - Later
Most of the others are asleep or talking among themselves as Billy Grounds turns to Zwing Hunt, whispering: What d'you think
didn't think Curly Bill could be killed
'm Tellin' you, this whole thing's Gone sour
We got hands droppin' Like flies and Ringo's flat out Of his mind
mean, hell Brother, you feel like ridin' Against Wyatt Earp
Hell no, brother
Then brother let's you and me cut out
Right with you, brother
They steal away toward the horses as
-   - Ringo faces Behan, grim, intent, while Behan sputters, holding up a San Francisco newspaper: Are you crazy
It's front page News all over the country
It's Getting out of hand, Ringo
If Things don't settle down soon- You heard me, Behan
Ringo, you don't understand- Ringo glares at Behan, his eyes burning, implacable: No, you don't understand
-   - Ringo rides up with Behan and dismounts
3rd Cowboy steps up: 3RD Billy Grounds and Zwing Hunt ran Out
Four, five others, too
Who cares
Separate the wheat From the chaff
Behan looks worried as Ike and the other Cowboys gather around
Just then Breakenridge rides up
What're you doing here, Billy
Curly Bill was my friend
'd Like to come with you
Sure, why not
Ringo slaps the little deputy on the back and turns to his men
His unaccustomed good humor is very troubling
told you it was time to get Woolly
Now gather 'round, Children, gather 'round
And Raise your right hands
-  - Now we've come full circle as Ringo rides across the desert at the head of his men 30 strong, armed to the teeth, full of fight-and all wearing Deputy Sheriff's , a posse of outlaws, a miserable Behan bringing up the rear
-   - Wyatt and his men watch from a plateau as far out on the horizon, the Cowboy Posse rides out of the sun, drawing closer: That's Ringo out front
And There's Behan
Must be 30 of 'em
What the hell
they're wearin' Badges
They all exchange looks of disbelief, then: Mounts're getting jaded
We're Gonna have to find a place to Rest 'em up
Suddenly looking very sick, Doc sways dizzily in the saddle
Wyatt dismounts, reaching for him
The others do the same: Doc
Don't touch me, God damn it
Just Don't touch me
Come on
Doc turns his horse, as if to ride on, then faints dead away
Grab him
They all catch him, easing him to the ground as
- '  - Wyatt's group rides over the hill overlooking the ranch house Vermillion keeping Doc in the saddle
Hooker and 3 of his hands rides out to them: Horse're pretty well fagged and We got a sick man with us
You can put up at my ranch if you want
Wyatt nods
Hooker motions down the hill toward his house
- , '  - Doc lies in bed, semi-conscious, white as a sheet, drenched in sweat
The others look on, worried
Hooker shakes his head: 'm no doctor but he looks pretty bad
His face creased with worry, Wyatt sits down next to Doc
McMasters motions to the others
They file out, leaving Wyatt alone with his friend
-    - Grounds and Hunt ride up and stop on the top of a hill overlooking a mountain crossroads somewhere in the Whetstones
What's it gonna be, brother
don't care
Colorado, New Mexico, 'long as we're out of the Territory
Suddenly a  comes into view, making its winding way through the crossroads below
Hunt points, grinning: Just what we need
Travelin' money
They spur their horses down the hill, drawing their guns
-   # 2 - The Cowboy posse is camped in a draw up in the Whetstones
They look up as the stage rolls up and stops
Shouting and commotion as Behan and Breakenridge approach and confer with the driver, then Behan turns to Ringo: Robbery
2 men stuck 'em up and Killed a passenger
One of 'em Rode a Mexican saddle, the other Had a Mother Hubbard
Billy Grounds and Zwing Hunt
Behan opens the door
Mr
Fabian lies inside cradled in Josephine's arms, surrounded by the other actors in the troupe
Reclined at full length, head back, he looks like the dying Hamlet, even more beautiful than in life
Breakenridge gasps: Oh, no
We're headed for a booking in Denver
They tried to take my Watch
He cursed them for cowards And they shot him
He may've been Vain and an actor but he was Better than all of you
And Gentler and braver
don't Understand any of this,  only Know it's ugly
You're all ugly And he was beautiful, he tried to Put something fine into your ugly World and you killed him for it
Anyway the ones who did it are headed north
Not that you care
Ringo shrugs
His soft face suddenly turning resolute
Breakenridge goes to his horse and mounts
Where're you going
Get back here
The little deputy straightens his spectacles, turning to Behan: 'm sorry, sir, but we got to Have some law
And he rides off alone into the Whetstones
Behan sputters, but: Let him go
Who cares
- '  - The stage is stopped out front
The driver waters the horses and the actors mill around silently
Wyatt and Hooker walk out: Had a holdup
Came her to water Their horses before pushin' on
Seeing each other, Wyatt and Josephine freeze
Wyatt approaches: Sorry about your friend
(pauses) And 'm sorry about
forgave you the moment you said it
You did
Well
thank you
The driver jumps back onto the stage, motioning to the others
have to go
Wait
She stops
Wyatt falters
There's so much he wants to say, but
Finally: Goodbye
Wyatt opens the coach door for her
She gets in
It pulls out with a crack of the driver's whip
She and Wyatt hold each other's gaze as the stage recedes into the distance
Then: Damn
Damn
Creek Johnson steps up next to him
Wyatt looks at him: See how she breezed out of here
Like she had wings
Funny thing But  can't really remember how She looked
can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package
Can't put it Together for some reason
Good God, you're really- Cards in spades
'm in love with Every second of her life
Hell, 'll probably love her when 'm dust
-   - cold camp in the hollow of a mountain
Wrapped n blankets, Grounds and Hunt sip cold coffee
Grounds shivers
Hunts pats him: No fire tonight, son
Too many Riders out
Grounds grunts
Suddenly there's an
Both jump up
Who's that
Breakenridge steps from the shadows, Winchester at his shoulder, squinting through the dark with his spectacles
It's Deputy Breakenridge
They relax and lower their pistols, heaving sighs of relief
Sister Boy
Thank God, we was afraid- You shouldn't've killed Mr
Fabian
You shouldn't've done That
It was wrong
'm takin' You both in for it
What
You gotta be kiddin'
Look, Just go home 'fore you get hurt
Don't want to kill you but  will If  have to
'm warning you
No, 'm warning you, Sister Boy
Grounds steps forward menancingly
Breakenridge tenses: Don't try it
Sister Boy, just go to hell
Grounds raises his pistol
Breakenridge recoils in fright, stumbling backward in the dark, and his rifle accidentally Grounds drops like a stone, a look of utter disbelief on his dying face
Hunt looks at him in shock then turns on Breakenridge, raising his gun and snarling
Breakenridge again
Hunt grabs his midsection, dropping his gun and falling to his knees
He looks up at Breakenridge who shrugs timidly: Sorry
Hunt falls over, dead
Breakenridge stares at the bodies, hardly believing it himself
-  , '  - Wyatt and his men are on the porch, listening to Hooker: brought 'em in draped over their saddles
Little Billy Breakenridge
Sister Boy
He done It
So  guess the law's finally Arrived in southeast Arizona
Wyatt shakes his head, hardly comprehending what he started
-   #3 - The Cowboys are camped on a mountaintop overlooking Hooker's ranch in the valley below
messenger rides up with a letter for Behan as Ringo paces, studying the set up with Ike
Hooker's got around 15 or 16 Hands
We could take 'em right Enough but it might be a mess
Keep the place bottled up for Now, see if we can figure a way To flush 'em
Behan suddenly steps up, beside himself, holding up his message: It's too much
It's completely Out of hand
Governor Gosper's Talking about asking the President to send in the Army
Listen Ringo, you've got to get This over with and you've got to Do it now
One way or another
-  , '  - Wyatt stands on the front porch, looking through the front door to the back bedroom where Doc lies unconscious while Hooker and the others look on: We should get moving
Doc's just in no kinda shape
Don't have to bother about that
Took a vote
Cowboys or not, you Can stay here as long as you want
Anyway maybe you done enough Mean you whittled 'em down Considerable, now there's talk of Sendin' the Army in here
Ask me, You done enough
(rides up, points) Rider comin' in under a white flag They look up as the 3rd Cowboy rides up with a white kerchief
3RD Got a message
Ringo wants McMaster to come over to our Camp for a parley
He didn't figure on all the stink This is causin'
Might be he's lookin' to strike a bargain
If So, he probably figures he needs Somebody like me who talks his Language
Could be we got him
don't like it
Might as well hear him out
Anyways, what choice we got
(Mounts horse, whispers) But no matter what happens, see It through to the end
If you don't 'll curse the day  ever laid eyes on you
Before Wyatt can answer, McMasters rides off with the Cowboy
-     #3 - McMasters rides up with the 3rd Cowboy
Riding through camp, all his former comrades flares at him with pure hate
Only Ringo smiles, stepping up as McMasters dismounts
Well hello, Sherm
You wanted to talk
Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us
That what you got me up here for
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother
Come back, no hard Feelings
Forget it, Ringo
Isn't there anything  can say That'll change your mind
You're Gonna stay with your new friends
'Least they don't scare women
You're the boss
One thing, though
Ringo moves closer, looking him in the eye and smiling: How you gonna get back to 'em
- '  - The 3rd Cowboy rides up to the ranch house, dumps a large in front, and gallops back to just within earshot as Wyatt and his men run up
The object is a human corpse and though we can't see what was done to it, the expressions on their faces are plain enough
Why couldn't they've jus killed him
3RD (shouts) Ringo wanted to be sure he got Your attention, Marshal
He wants straight-up fight, just you and Him, settle this thing once and For all
You win, we quit the Territory; Ringo wins, your Deputies get safe conduct to the Colorado line
Sundown today in The oak grove at the mouth of Sulphur Springs Canyon
Ride out With your escort, we'll meet you
You tell Ringo
just tell him 'll be there
Wyatt, are you crazy
made a promise
Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him
You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class
Hell, He's the best that's ever been
'Cept maybe for Wild Bill
He's right, Wyatt
Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him
But 'd do it, 'd get that one Into him
So help me God,  would
All right Wyatt, maybe you can
But you gotta die to do it
Understand
You gotta die
In tight on Wyatt as these words sink in and
- ,   - It's late and the last rays of the sun come through the window, falling on the bed where Doc lies, awake but looking like hell
Wyatt sits next to him, staring at the floor
After a moment: What makes a man like Ringo, Doc
What makes him do the things he does
man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it
He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it
And it drives him mad
Sick mad
Cold and dirty
So what does he want
What does he want
He wants revenge
Revenge
For what
Doc looks at him, a look of purest sadness in his sunken eyes
Being born
Wyatt looks down again and it's a long time before he speaks: Remember how  said it all Happened so fast with Curly Bill didn't have time to think about it
Well 've had plenty of time To think about this
spent most Of my life since  was born not Knowing what  want out of life, Just chasin' my tail
But now, For the first time  know exactly What  want
And who
And that's The damnable misery of it
(pauses, looks at Doc) can't beat him, can
Doc shakes his head
Wyatt nods then stands, ready to exit, but: No, wait, 'll go with you
Doc struggles to sit up, sweating and trembling, finally falling back down, almost passing out
Wyatt puts a hand on his forehead
'm sorry
'm sorry, Wyatt
God, 'm so sorry
That's all right, Doc
Don't worry
Never got to wear one of those
Doc points to Wyatt's badge
He takes it off, pressing it into Doc's hand
Doc smiles then does pass out
Wyatt exits
-  ,   - It's late, almost sunset
Wyatt steps onto the porch where Hooker and the others wait
He glances back into the house, looking at the unconscious Doc through the open bedroom door
Don't worry
They want him They'll have to go over us first
Wyatt nods gratefully, offering his hand
Hooker takes it, abashed
Wyatt mounts up with Johnson and Vermillion
They ride off at a slow gallop, 3 figures against the twilight sky
-  /  #3 - Ringo waits atop the hill with Ike and the 3rd Cowboy watching as Wyatt's group rides out: Only three
They left somebody Behind
Let's go take a look
-   - Ringo and the others ride up
Hooker steps up with several hands
What're you doin' here
Who's in there
It's Holliday
He's sick
Imagine He's dyin'
Ringo squints through the front door of the house to the open bedroom where Doc lies unconscious, chest heaving, sweating
Drag him out here, let's have a look
looked the other way when you Did a lot of foul things but Ain't lettin' you torment a dyin' Man
Not as long as he's under my Roof
draw the line there
Hooker and his men look resolute
Ringo smiles, nodding: All right, Hooker
'll be back In about an hour
We'll see how Brave you are then
'll be here
Ringo and his men ride off
At the crossroads they stop, Ike peeling off
Soon as 'm through with Wyatt, Swarm down with the whole bunch And finish off Creek Johnson and Texas Jack
And they gallop off in opposite directions as
-    - 2 Cowboys, Ringo's seconds, ride up to where Wyatt and his men stand dismounted, waiting
One points to a thicket nearby: 3RD He's waitin' for you by the big Oak, quarter mile up that trail
-   - Behan and the other Cowboys wait at the road above the canyon
30 strong, mounted and ready
Ike rides up, full of anticipation: Get ready
Soon as Ringo's done We're gonna take care of the others
Aren't we giving them safe conduct
Sure we are
All the way to hell
-    - Sunset
Ringo's seconds wait nearby as Wyatt whispers to his men: They're not givin' you any safe Conduct
Soon as the shooting Starts kick east for the New Mexico line
Well
Wyatt shakes hands with Vermillion who turns away with emotion, hiding his face
Wyatt turns to Johnson
Wyatt,
ain't got the words
know
Me neither
Wyatt pats his shoulder and walks off alone into the thicket, the only sound the musical clinking and chiming of his spurs
-  - gorgeous sunset, yellow and red and magenta
Making his way down the trail, Wyatt looks up at the sky
flock of wild geese fly overhead in -formation, oblivious to the human drama below
Wyatt stops, drinking it all in, as if trying to grab all he can in the time left
Suddenly he closes his eyes, falling to his knees, trembling, afraid for the first time
He clasps his hands: Dear God, this is the last Battle
worked it out in my Head every which way and  know There's no way 'm comin' through This alive
You've preserved me This far so  only ask one more Favor: just let me live long Enough to kill that man
Thy will Be done and there's an amen to it
Wyatt stands back up, his fear gone, replaced by calm, his face luminous, almost angelic
He walks on, spurs still chiming as
-   - clearing by a creek with a cluster of small oaks
Ringo leans against a tree, sipping from a hip flask, smoking a slim cheroot
We  the  spurs approach
Ringo looks up as the tall silhouette of his enemy emerges from the shadows of the thicket
Well, didn't think you had it in you
(smiles, sets himself) Shall we
'm your huckleberry
Ringo stiffens as the silhouette steps into the waning light
It's , pale and drawn, looking like death itself, but awake and ready just the same: Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave
(sees his shock) Oh,  wasn't quite as sick as Made out
My fight's not with you, Holliday
beg to differ
We started a Fight we never got to finish
Play for blood, remember
was kidding about that
For the last time, that Cheshire cat smile comes over Doc's face: wasn't
(pins on Wyatt's badge) And this time it's legal
Ringo nods, his hock replaced by a growing malice
As they set themselves, once again their eyes begin to blaze, boring into each other, their concentrated rage focusing on each other, about to reach critical mass
All right, lunger
Let's do it
Say when
long tense moment then both grunt in unison
Blurred movement, the  of a
Doc slaps his gun back in it's holster as Ringo stumbles, a bullet hole in the side of his head
-  - Back in the thicket, Wyatt  the gunshot and starts running
-   - Blood coursing from the hole in his head, frenzied messages flickering all through his shattered brain, going only on pure hate, Ringo stumbles and jerks, struggling to raise his pistol
Doc dances in front of him, urging him on: Come on
Come on
But finally Ringo falls over into the crook of the oak tree, his pistol firing into the air harmlessly
Doc looks down at him, shaking his head: Oh Johnny
You're no daisy, no Daisy at all
Just then Wyatt appears, looking at Doc in total shock
What happened
Doc looks at him like he's a fool then points to Ringo: Poor soul, he was so high-strung
Afraid the strain was more than He could bear
Suddenly we hear  crashing through the brush toward them
Let's go
My horse is over here
They dash off into the thicket
Moments later Ringo's seconds ride out into the grove
Seeing Ringo's body, their jaws drop
-   - Vermillion and Johnson practically jump for joy as Wyatt and Doc emerge from the thicket, Doc leading his horse
Praise Jesus
'll be dipped in shit
will, too
-   - Alert by the shots, Ike turns to Behan and the others
All right, get ready
-   - Vermillion and Johnson are mounted, watching while Doc tries to climb up into the saddle with excruciating slowness
Though on his feet, it's clear Doc is as sick as ever, sweating and panting, running on sheer animal courage
Wyatt stands behind him, his hands poised to help, trying to will him into the saddle, jerking his hands behind him every time Doc looks back
Finally, with a last grunt, Doc throws a leg over his horse and drops into the saddle
Wyatt mounts, turns to his men, pointing: All right, what's it to be
New Mexico's that way
Colorado's closer So're the Cowboys
They're up That road right now, waiting to Jump us
We're the law, ain't we
Well the Law don't ride around vermin- It rides right at 'em
Like McMasters said, see it through to The end
Wyatt looks at Doc, who shrugs
Wyatt swings his horse alongside, suddenly noticing his badge on Doc's chest
Doc smiles wanly: just wanted to see what it felt Like
Here
He starts unpinning it but Wyatt stops him, pressing his palm onto the badge over Doc's heart
last look around each other then Wyatt signals and they start up the north road at the lope, four abreast, the last charge of Wyatt Earp and his immortals
-   - From a lookout position above, a  calls down to the others: 4TH Riders comin'
Behan heaves a sigh of relief, glancing around at the others
Well  guess Ringo did it
But suddenly Ringo's seconds gallop up from the flank: 3RD Ringo's dead What
Straining to see in the falling light, the cowboy on the rock shouts excitedly: 4TH That's Wyatt Earp's bunch
The word starts to spread, the crowd of horsemen
Suddenly, off in the distance, the 4 horsemen come into view, coming straight at them at a lope
3RD They're comin' right at us
Down the road, Wyatt asnd his men pull their shotguns, holding them at the ready as they break into a gallop
The Cowboy on the rock jumps down, mounting his horse
4TH Here they come
Get ready
The Cowboys line-up on a rise, blocking the road
They draw their guns
Wyatt and his men keep coming, now 200 yards away
Behan groans, panic sinking sour and heavy, churning his bowels: Oh, no
Now Wyatt's men break into a dead run, hurtling toward them at top speed, their thoroughbreds eating up the distance, now only 100 yards away
The Cowboys tense up more and more, biting lips, grinding teeth
The 4th Cowboy turns to the nearby 3rd Cowboy: 4TH What d'you think
3RD think it's time to start Workin' for a livin'
Me too
They break and run
So does another
Suddenly the whole mass of them  in panic with horsemen riding in all directions, scurrying away like cockroaches from a light
Ike looks around, screaming at them, beside himself as the 4th Cowboy rides by: Kill 'em
Kill 'em
It's only Four men
Why don't you kill 'em
4TH Why don't you
The others keep going, leaving him behind
But seeing Wyatt bearing down on him, Ike finally bolts himself, pounding off hell-for-leather into the hills
Wyatt and his men keep coming at a full gallop and as they crest the rise, suddenly, as before, the ground seems to fall out from under them and for another burning moment they once again appear airborne, grim-faced avenging angels on winged horses, now even more majestic in the twilight, like a myth made flesh, awesome, superb, and unutterably beautiful
As they approach, only Breakenridge remains, giving them a tentative wave
Wyatt points a finger at him as they ride by in a flash, cresting another rise and passing into legend
-   - The  on the wall of this private  hospital room ticks gently but inexorably as Doc lies in bed with , a Catholic priest, sitting at his side
Painfully emaciated, his breathing shallow and labored, Doc is so weak it's all he can do to even move his eyes
But he brightens as Wyatt enters: Well hell, Wyatt
Wyatt,  want You to meet Father Feeney
Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome
You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds
How you feelin', Doc
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree
better one might be how Do you feel
(sits down, sighs) Hurts
Hurts pretty bad
imagine it would, yes
So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties
All right, Doc
You think 'm kidding
You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass 've ever Known
Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope
All  ever wanted was to live a Normal life
When will you wake up
You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass
That's great coming from you
played the cards  was dealt, Wyatt
Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's
Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life
There's Only life, that's all
Just life
The rest is relative
Then what do  do
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own
All right
Then what
Run
Take that girl and start Running
Run and don't look back
All your life you been running And looking back and just barely Existing and calling it getting By
This time run and don't look Back and call it living
Live Every second, live it right up to The hilt
Live, Wyatt
(pauses, takes his hand) Live for me
Wyatt stares into his eyes, letting this sink in
Just then, Doc looks up, as if something were pressing on him
Then: Wyatt, please, if you were ever My friend, if you ever had even The smallest feeling for me, Leave
Leave now
Please
They look at each other and something passes between them, something so personal and powerful it transcends emotion
Wyatt starts to speak, but: Never mind, Wyatt
know
Just go
Doc turns away
Wyatt exits
Doc looks over at Father Feeney: Now let's see, Father
What was That monkey show you were talking about
You mean Extreme Unction
That's it
Better start that ball rolling
Father Feeney nods, picking up his Missal
As he starts to intone the Last Rites, Doc looks down at the end of the bed and sees his feet poking through the sheets
They are bare
Doc smiles: 'll be damned
(looks at Feeney) This is funny
-    - lively road company production of "
Pinafore"
Josephine and 3 chorus girls, all adorable in out-size sailor suits do the seamen's hornpipe to the resounding applause of the audience
-   - Josephine and her fellow chorines, including the 1st Actress from before, all in various stages of undress, sit at the long mirror, removing their make-up and chatting: 1ST can't get used to this thin air Here in Denver
thought  was Going to faint on that last buck- And-wing
know, it's- Suddenly the door bursts open
Screams and stunned reaction
Wyatt rushes in and goes to Josephine who sits in stunned silence
He falls to his knees and grabs the hem of her robe
Wyatt
My God
Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies
It hits all of sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven
Wyatt stands, pulling her close, clasping her hands in his: have nothing left
have Nothing to give you
have no Pride, no dignity, no money Don't even know how we'll make a Living
But  promise 'll love You every second of your life
Don't worry, Wyatt
My family's rich
/ -  - Brilliant sunlight, clean, crisp air as a train hurtles through a pass high up in the Rocky Mountains, blowing its whistle and sending a giant plume of steam billowing up over the sheer, towering, snow-topped mountain walls into the crystal-clear sky above
Wyatt leads Josephine by the hand through the parlor car, both hardly able to contain themselves, brimming over with excitement and anticipation, like children waiting for Christmas morning and trying to ignore the group of  dogging their footsteps, swarming around them, calling out to Wyatt: 1ST Mr Earp
One minute, please
You And your four men have just Accomplished in one week what it Took the Texas Rangers four years To do
Please, do you have any comment
Wyatt and Josephine hunch down and duck through a knot of porters into the next car
Only the 1st Reporter gives chase
Moving into the passenger car furthest forward, Wyatt leads her through the door to the platform over the coupling between cars
Chugging up a steep grade toward a high crest, the train is immersed in shadows
Wyatt points ahead to the approaching crest: There
It'll come up over that ridge
Inside meanwhile, the 1st Reporter comes through the car and spots them up
business-type  tugs on his sleeve: What's the commotion
Who are they
1ST Don't you know
That's Wyatt Earp, the Lion of Tombstone, and His lady fair
Outside, still bathed in shadows, Wyatt and Josephine hang onto the railing and lean out, watching in as the train nears the top
Get ready, here it comes
Here it comes
Then, as if on cue, they crest the mountain and are suddenly bathed in golden sunlight, their heads leaning from the train, Wyatt's blonde hair and Josephine's black tresses flowing in the breeze, their faces luminous, looking straight ahead toward their future

"Wyatt and Josephine embarked on a series of adventures throughout the west, making and losing several fortunes, always living the high life, spending every winter, just the two of them, prospecting for gold in the desert foothills of southeastern California
Up or down, thin or Flush, in 47 years they never Left each other's side
" The figures of the old man and woman fade away, leaving only the desert and the mountains which are eternal
"Wyatt Earp died in Los Angeles in 1929
Among the pallbearers at his funeral were early western movie stars William
Hart and Tom Mix
" Flickering images from early Hollywood silent films split the frame: on one side the grim but impassioned figure of William Hart, the original western good-badman crouched menacingly behind a pair of sixguns, his costume dusty and severe; and on the other side Tom Mix, the original western fantasy hero, so light-hearted and optimistic with his sunny grin and fancy white outfit
"Tom Mix wept
