In a time of great strife, a legendary interdimensional being known as Zordon, came to the city of Angel Grove to establish a vanguard in the never ending struggle against evil
with the aid of his trusted assistant, Alpha 5, the noble master sought out six extraordinary teenagers and gave them the power to transform into an unstoppable fighting force
In time of great need, the young heroes could now call upon colossal assault vehicles known as "Zords"
while the identity of the six remained a guarded secret, their courageous exploits soon became the stuff of Legend, earning them the title

Angel Grove Police have cordoned off the area until it can be determined whether or not the unidentified object poses any threat
The injured workman was quoted as saying

Rangers, you must act swiftly
The planet is in  danger
Danger from what
Six thousand years ago a morphological being known as Ivan Ooze, ruled the world with a reign of unparalleled terror
Finally, a rebel factor known as the "Order of the Meledon" lured him into a hyperlock chamber and buried him deep underground

The chamber has been accidently You must return it to the depths
or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released

- On cue, the Power Rangers  into the construction site
They're surrounded by rock piles, pools of water and a plethora of building supplies
Billy looks down at the mud puddle he's standing in
Remind me to have a word with Alpha about his teleporting calculations
They survey the construction site for a moment
Anybody see anything
Let's take a look over there
They advance up a slope -- the egg comes into view
(alarmed) It looks like it's been opened
The kids get close to the egg, looking it over with fascination
Suddenly a hand falls on Aisha

Ivan puts his hands to his face in mock fear
Ooooh, where's my autoqraph book
He looks them over reproachfully
Power Rangers, huh
So Zordon is still using a bunch of rug-rats to do his dirty work
And speaking of rats
Ivan raises both hands -- and the kids   as the bolt

The rats chase after Saba as he heads into a water-slicked area
There's a large power cable running across it
Once all the rats are in the water, Saba kamikaze dives into the cable,
The water and the rats
Fried mice, anyone
We see the six original small rats scurry away,
Suddenly, there's an     and the Rangers watch, stunned, as their  - and they appear back in civilian clothes
What's going on
Billy tries his wrist communicator
Alpha, come in
There's no response
We'd better get back
They all hit their communicators and nothing happens
(worried) Something's wrong
Come on, guys
They hurry off

Up ahead, there's a     rising from the Command Center

-                           22 The place is trashed -- there's  debris, ravaged  panels, exposed wires and mechanisms
The kids move through the wreckage in numb silence

Adam spots Alpha's arm protruding from a mound of rubble
Guys
The kids quickly uncover the battered robot
Alpha, are you okay

He must've blown an anitromic demodulator
(stunned) Oh, no
Everybody follows Kimberly's gaze, thunderstruck expressions coming over them
Laying on a destroyed bed of crystals is Zordon
He is still a being, only now he s aged a good fifty years
The kids stand over him, forlorn
What's happening to him
' Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate
We have to help him
Zordon opens his eyes
Rangers
thank goodness you're safe
The kids drop down beside him
We have to get you back inside your time warp
'm afraid that's impossible
The power has been destroyed
It's gone
The Zords, the weapons
all of it

The kids are stunned
Kimberly gently takes Zordon's hand
Zordon
you can't leave us
Ever since you came into our lives
you've been like another father `to  us  all

Ivan almost overthrew the planet once
and now 'm afraid he has the strength to see his scheme through
Zordon closes his eyes
Tommy puts a hand on Kimberly's shoulder
The kids slowly rise, all of them looking utterly despondent
Billy turns to Alpha
what're we going to do

Billy opens a panel on Alpha's back, makes an adjustment
Alpha's head rolls back like he's going to sneeze
5 Ah-Ah-Ahhhh-

He
5 Thanks, Billy
Rocky hands Alpha a hanky, Alpha wipes his nose area
There has to be something we can do
Come on, guys, think
Aisha turns to Alpha
Alpha
Is there any way we can defeat this  monster
Any way at all
5 Perhaps there is a way have heard tales of another power
What
5 They say that somewhere beyond the Hyperion Constellation there exists a mythological power that is beyond all comprehension
How can we get to it
5 As the legend goes, the power is impossible to obtain
We have to try, Alpha
It's our only hope
Alpha shakes his head
5 It's far too dangerous
Zordon would never allow it
If we don't try, Zordon won't survive
If Ivan  Ooze  isn't  stopped, nobody will survive
Alpha heaves a sigh
5 Ay, yi, yi, yi
(beat) The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos
This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power
How can we reach Phaedos
Alpha heaves a

The kids exchange curious looks as Alpha opens a compartment and removes a vile filled with

It should be enough to get -you there
He approaches a damaged panel, loads in the vile
5 There is one problem
only have enough reserve to send you Phaedos
can't bring you back
So how do we get back
Alpha gives them a grim look
5 You'll have to pray that the legends are true
Alpha keys in coordinates
5 You're sure you want to do this
The Rangers share purposeful looks
It's our only hope
Alpha shakes his head, punches in the final codes
Safe journey, Rangers

Ivan turns menacingly to Goldar and Mordant
Now you have a choice, either serve me, or join those insufferable cheesedongs
Mordant and Goldar exchange a look, then turn back to Ivan
We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place
Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way

It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer
You want me to place a few calls
Ivan shakes his head
No need
'm going to use the young minds of Angel Grove
digs for buried treasure deep in his nose
No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting
Yes, well,  suppose you'd know a little something about that
(beat) Not to worry
'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils
And what better way to entice them
than with a little Ivan's Ooze
Ivan approaches an enormous vat, turns a tap -- it  and as   pours out
But boss, what about their parents
Ah, the old and doddering
'm going to  their puny minds, reducing them to '
And then 'll put them to work rebuilding my empire

Hey
Kimberly glances up
You okay
Kimberly takes a moment to answer
was just thinking about Zordon
everything we've been through together
You know, meeting Zordon
teaming up with you guys, it's the best thing that's ever happened to me
It's the best thing that's ever happened to all of us
He's gonna make it, guys
The others nod in agreement
We'll get this warrior
save Zordon
and send that Ivan Ooze back to the he crawled out of
Tommy's words sink in
He stops suddenly, sensing something

That was amazing for such a little dude
The figure speaks in a

How did this happen
Tommy just gapes
Kimberly gives him a cold glance and him one with her elbow
The lady asked you a question
Huh
Oh, uh, we re, ah
Kimberly intervenes
He was attacked by this horrific being -- Ivan Ooze
Ivan Ooze is free
We are all in mortal danger
She moves off - the Rangers just stand there staring at each other

Kind of bossy, isn't she

Ranging in age from eight to seventeen, are swarming Bulk and Skull, who have set up a booth with a large banner that reads:      "
" Some kids  the ooze, others  it, others  it at each other
It's an ooze free-for-all
Boys and girls, girls and boys, gather round and feast your eyes
This ain't sludge and this ain't guck
this is the one and only Ivan's Ooze

It's ooey, gooey and even kind of chewy
But best of all it's Bulk and Skull run a booth

Kids crowd around
Here you go
No pushing
There's enough for everybody
Fred approaches
So where'd this guy come from
Bulk and Skull exchange apprehensive looks
Uh
that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information
If we told you -- we'd have to kill you
Fred looks at the container in his hand but he doesn't open it
Skull sees a kid  some ooze at him
Skull ducks and Bulk gets  in the face

They're called squirbs
Kimberly lifts out an - , and watches it between her fingers
Mine seems to be a little undercooked
Dulcea sprinkles hers with brown flakes
Add a few dried weevils and you'll never know the difference
The other Rangers watch as Billy holds one of the squirbs over his mouth and drops it in
He chews a few times, lets out  a Not bad
Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time
Dulcea looks to Tommy
What do you know of the Great Power
Only that we need it to defeat Ivan Ooze
Dulcea's eyes move from Ranger to Ranger
It is said that to those who possess the Power
all things are possible
Where did it originate
In another time, another dimension
It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct
They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies
(ominous) For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it
have perished
Dulcea's words hang heavily in the air
So how can we get to it
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being
And how do we do that
By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti
It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja
(beat) It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit
Look, Zordon doesn't have much longer to live
And for all we know, Angel Grove could already be under attack
We don't have for this
As Rocky is talking, a flubbery looking  works it's way over Kimberly's shoulder
She hasn't noticed it yet
You don't understand
If you do not have the Ninjetti, the power will destroy  you
(beat) To reach the Monolith we must traverse the Neola jungle
We will train today, and set out on foot tomorrow
The snout works it's way underneath Kimberly's chin -- she '

Ninjetti  - man and animal, together as one
(beat) Now, put your hands inside the flame
Yeah, right
It will not harm you
The kids hesitate a moment, then reluctantly put their hands inside the flame
Aisha makes a horrific expression
Just kidding
They remove their hands -- they're filled with sand
Wow
Sand

Aisha studies the sand for a moment -- it (bedazzled) see

Oh, it couldn't've gone better

Well

Fred decides to be tricky
Look, Ivan wants me to go dump a load of garbage all over them
Well, why didn't you say so

how do you and Zordon know each other
Dulcea reminisces
We belonged to an interstellar Peace Keeping Force known as the "Order of the Meledan"
(beat) Zordon was widely regarded as the finest Commander in the Galaxy
He was a true Legend
If it wasn't for him, the Universe would be a very different place from what it is today
The kids are overwhelmed by what they're hearing
So
what happened
Over time our enemies were defeated
returned to Phaedos, Zordon moved on to continue the struggle elsewhere
(beat) Until you kids showed up, hadn't heard from him for centuries
The Rangers are silent for a moment
He was always an inspiration
Dulcea speaks with grim-visaged intensity
This is why 'm taking you to the Nathadian Monolith
That is why 'm teaching you the Ninjetti
(beat) If Zordon dies
then a piece of all of us dies
and the force of good within the Universe will be dealt an irreparable blow

The kids strain to get a better look
This is as far as  can take you
The kids are thrown by this
You're leaving us
have taught you all that know
Now you must achieve the Ninjetti on your own
The kids share glances, not quite knowing what to say
It is said that once you've reached the power
you have only ten triacs to release it
What's a Triac
About twenty seconds in your time
And how do we release the power
The legend goes that you release the power with the power
What does that mean
That is a question that even cannot answer
(beat) Remember, ten triacs
After that something bad will happen
Like
how bad
Dulcea gives them a grim look
They say the power will throw off a super-heated, radioactive fireball, instantly reducing you to ash and bits of charred bone

Finally, after centuries of waiting, my Ecto-Morphicon machines are ready to take on the world
Mordant gets the camera a little too close to Ivan
Ivan  Mordant and the camera  up through the air and against a wall
Oh, man, that was a rental

Ivan steps up onto a platform

They peer over the ridge -- their eyes wide
Before them, a tenuous rope bridge leads to a vast rock landing
The ocean
On top of the island is the Nathadian Monolith
It's a  mind- boggling wonder from another time and place
Between the Rangers and the bridge, the Tengu Warriors are on patrol
Man, these are the last guys wanted to see
Whadda we do now
Kimberly surveys the area
That's the only way to the Monolith
We can take these guys
Tommy pulls all of them into a huddle

-                                    68 The Tengu are on full alert
One of them hears something, snaps around, there's nothing there
Another Tengu looks down as a frog hops between his leg
He and  down his taloned foot, missing the creature by inches
We hear a  and the Queen Tengu squints as she spots a falcon circling in the sky above
The Queen is perched on top of a 20 foot rock face
She looks around hesitantly
Now the Rangers , some of them   , others out of crevices, others coming over the walls
Billy wields his  sticks -- misses several times, then starts  and  the feathered beasts
The Queen     from her eyes -- it before Tommy
Kimberly battles another Tengu and the creature forces her back on to the rickety bridge
The Queen
Rocky , knocking Aisha away from the bolt
Adam and one of the Tengu circle each other warily
The frog silently assesses its target, then strikes out
Suddenly the Tengu is We didn't even see Adam move
in the blink of an eye
Tommy steps up behind a Tengu
Yo, Tweety
The Tengu turns around and Tommy     - Tengu faces down Aisha and she goes into a bear stance
The bear is sturdy as a towering tree
Nothing can uproot it
The Tengu    ,
She holds fast and the bird
Bye, bye birdy
Kimberly continues balancing precariously on the bridge as she with her foe
She finally drops into a crane stance
then just like Dulcea she    , and sends the birdman
In a movement that seems to defy gravity, she lands perfcctly back on the swinging bridge
Hasta la Pasta, Bigbird
Billy swings his sticks,  one of the Tengu in the beak -- the creature
Tommy reaches the top of a rack
He sees a Tengu making a , -- They  the ground and Rocky  another Tengu in the beak,   -- the creature is
Tommy    ,  two Tengu in the beaks
They The Queen shoots another    --  a rock , Aisha turns to Rocky
It's up to you
Rocky takes a deep breath, goes into a crouch position
Incredibly he and lands right before the Queen Tengu
He looks her dead in the eye
Polly wanna cracker
With that, he executes a devastating -  and the Queen

Instantly, the remaining Tengu retreat,  and   in rage
The kids turn to eaeh other, sharing in a moment of triumph

There's all sorts of charred bones and skeletons strewn around it, some of them human, some of them alien
They approach the massive block, stand before it in awe struck silence
In the middle of the Monolith there's a large circle with the six animals of the Ninjetti carved into it
The Nathadian Monolith
Kimberly looks at all the bones -- instinctively puts her hand on her animal symbol
guess these guys weren't so lucky
few of the kids walk around the Monolith, examining it more closely
We've come all this way for a rock wall
There should be a way to open it
Billy &;Tommy latch their hands over the block, searching for an opening
Nothing
Release the power with the power
Rocky steps back,    into the Monolith with a , winces in pain
Not that kind of power
The kids exchange discouraged looks
There has to be something we're missing
The kids look crestfallen
It can't end like this
