a small and distant cylindrical object tumbling end over end, but we can't determine exactly what it is yet

-                                         2 vast and undulating sea of wheat
We become aware that there are two  sticking out of the stalks of wheat: two men are standing and looking up at the sky
As we move towards them,  we begin to hear their conversation
and we can see that the two men are and , dressed in civilian clothing
(points to sky) There he is -- there, to the South
(peers upward) What are ye, blind
That's a bird
As they stare up at the sky

-                                          4 As before, Chekov and Scotty staring at the sky
(concerned) Repelling the Crystalline Trench
rafting down lava flows
orbital skydiving
it's like the man is running a bloody decathlon across the galaxy
Suddenly we hear a double
(re: sound) That should be him now
think he's just crossed the sound barrier
They shield their eyes against the sun and look up

His body-suit is charred, scorched, wisps of smoke still curling off of it
There are small thrusters attached to his backpack and boots
Scotty and Chekov move to him
The man removes his helmet
Revealing that it is
He smiles broadly, like a child who has just come off a roller-coaster
Right on target
jump out over the Arabian Peninsula
and  end up here, right on the dime
Kirk gets to his feet
Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters
(points) That way
Thanks for pointing that out
Kirk starts to pull off his suit, reacts to a sudden pain in his back
Oh
've warned ye about that back of yours
You should have a doctor take a look at it
Kirk waves him away, and continues to remove his harness

(-)                                          6A The tumbling bottle rushes past, and we can now see that it is a   - Dom Perignon, 2265
Follow the bottle as it tumbles through space
6B
-                                        6B Kirk, Scotty and Chekov as before
Tomorrow  want to make a tri- elliptical jump
That's where you jump out over Northern China, and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry
Captain
Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony
This strikes a nerve with Kirk -- we see a flash of hesitation and irritation cross his face
'm not going
(beat) Scotty, help me with this chute
What do you mean, you're not going
We promised
When  retired,  swore 'd never set foot on a starship again, and meant it
Captain
(firm) don't want to hear anymore about it
'm not going, and that's final

The window is filled with people in Starfleet uniforms, applauding the christening of the ship (but we hear nothing)

(-)                     8A The people are still applauding and we can see that they are looking out over the ship in its berth

bright light shines into their faces and they react
- that the bright light is coming from a futuristic with a small bank of lights attached to it
The camera is a holographic recorder with two lenses and is worn on an operator's head
There are four clustered in front of the Turbolift -- one associated with the camera, the others using  to make notations
Also clustered around the door are the   of the Enterprise-
Everyone is  as Kirk and the others blink under the bright lights and  the Bridge
(overlapping) Captain Kirk, how does it feel to be back on the Enterprise Bridge
Captain, can  have a Minute
Captain Scott, do you have any comment on
Commander Chekov
etc
pushes through the crowd
Excuse me, excuse me
there will be plenty of time for questions later
The journalists edge away, and the cameraman moves to get a good angle
(continuing, to all) 'm Captain John Harriman
'd like to welcome you all aboard
It's our pleasure
Harriman is young, confident, eager -- this is his first command and he takes it very seriously
just want you to know how excited we all are to have a group of living legends with us on our maiden voyage
(beat) remember reading about your missions when  was in grade school
The original Enterprise officers all stop and give him a look
Harriman looks a little embarrassed -- he didn't mean to insult them
But Kirk gives him a little smile, lets it roll off
Well
may we have a look around
Please
please
Chekov sees someone in the background, calls out to her
Demora
Chekov moves off
(breezy) So, Captain
this is the first Starship Enterprise in thirty years without James
Kirk in command
How do you feel about that
The Journalist has unknowingly touched a nerve
Kirk's eyes flash for a moment -- the longer he's on this Bridge, the more he realizes he doesn't feel good about it at all
He tries to shrug it off with a smile
Just fine
'm glad to be here to send her on her way
He tries to move away from the Journalist, who dogs him
What have you been doing since you retired
've been
keeping busy
At this point, Chekov approaches with a young, (mid- twenties) attractive, Asian female Ensign named
(to Kirk) Excuse me, Captain
'd like you to meet the Helmsman of the Enterprise-
Ensign Demora Sulu -- Captain James Kirk
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir
My father's told me some
interesting stories about you
Kirk is shocked
For a long moment, he stares at her in amazement
Your father
Hikaru Sulu is your father
Yes, sir
You met her once before, but she was
Chekov holds out his hand and indicates a very short height
But that wasn't so long ago
it couldn't have been more than
Twelve years, sir
Yes
well
congratulations, Ensign
It wouldn't be the Enterprise without a Sulu at the helm
Thank you, sir
(to Chekov) Let me show you the new inertial guidance system
Demora and Chekov move off and Kirk looks after them for a long beat
The expression on his face changes from shock to sadness
Something is clearly bothering him
Scotty moves over to Kirk, with a smile on his face
(to Kirk) Damn fine ship if you ask me
But Kirk's mind is still on Demora
He watches her as she moves to the Helmsman's position
You know, Scotty
it amazes me
And what would that be, sir
Sulu
When did he find the time for a family
It's like you always said -- if something's important enough, you make the time
Kirk nods absently
Scotty realizes something
So
that's why you've been running around the galaxy like an eighteen-year-old
Finding retirement a little lonely, are we
Kirk gives him a look
With that kind of tact, 'm glad you're an engineer and not a psychiatrist
Harriman interrupts
Excuse me, gentlemen
if you'll take your seats
Oh
of course
10                                                       10 Revealing that three  have been neatly arranged to one side
Scotty, Kirk and Chekov all take their seats
The Journalists take positions on the opposite side of the Bridge
Harriman moves to the command chair and the rest of the Bridge crew go to their stations
(to all) Prepare to leave spacedock
Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping
(beat) Captain Kirk, 'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway
No
no
Thank you
Please,  insist
All eyes on Kirk -- he has little choice
He stands uncomfortably
There is a moment of anticipation
(to all) Take us out
Everyone breaks into
Kirk sits down in acute embarrassment and  annoyance
(sotto) Very good, sir
(sotto) Brought a tear to my eye

- -                                   12 short time later
Harriman turns to his guests
Well
we've just cleared the asteroid belt
Our course will take us out beyond Pluto and then back to spacedock
Just a quick run around the block
(beat) If we have time, we'll conduct a few tests of the warp -- Suddenly the communications console starts to
The   hits a few commands in response
(to Harriman) We're picking up a distress call, Captain
This grabs everyone's attention
On speakers
We hear the voice of a crewmember who sounds panicked and urgent
(fritzed) This is the transport ship Lakul
We're caught in some kind of energy distortion
We can't break free
need immediate help
It' tearing us -- The voice is drowned out by
The checks something on his console
The Journalist with the Holo-camera turns on his light and pans it around to capture the action
The Lakul is one of two ships transporting El-Aurian refugees to Earth
Harriman blinks a couple of times, surprised at this unexpected turn of  events
Kirk watches him intently
Harriman clears his throat, then turns to Demora
Can you locate them
The ships are bearing at three one zero mark two one five
Distance: Three light years
Signal the closest starship
We're in no condition to mount a rescue
We don't even have a full crew aboard
The  checks his console
We're the only one in range, sir
The Holo-camera light is shined on Harriman as he shifts in his seat, hesitant to take the plunge
Kirk is drumming his fingers impatiently on his leg
Finally, Harriman takes a breath and straightens his jacket a bit
Well, then
guess it's up to us
(to Demora) Helm, lay in an intercept course and engage at maximum warp
Kirk fidgets in his chair, itching to get in on the action - his instincts taking over
Scotty shoots him a side-long glance
Is there something wrong with your chair, Captain
Kirk gives him a look
13
- - (-)                           13 The ship snaps into warp
14
- -                                   14 few minutes later
Demora is watching her console
We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain
On screen
15     (-)                                  15 Which now shows a directly ahead of the Enterprise-
Everyone reacts to the bizarre sight
What the hell is that
(off console) 've found the transport ships
15A     (-)                                 15A The Viewscreen now shows    trapped like insects in the violent torrent of energy
The ships are being buffeted and thrown about by large of
(cont'd) Their hulls are starting to buckle under the stress -- they won't survive much longer
The ship suddenly
The Navigator works his console
We're encountering severe gravimetric distortions from the energy ribbon
We'll have to keep our distance
we don't want to get pulled in too
Harriman frowns at the screen, trying to figure out what to do
Kirk can barely contain himself -- to him the answer is obvious
He blurts out the answer -- Tractor beam
Scotty quickly elbows him in the side -- this isn't Kirk's ship
Kirk shuts up
Harriman glances at Kirk
We don't have a tractor beam
You left spacedock without a tractor beam
It won't be installed until Tuesday
(beat) Ensign Sulu
try generating a subspace field around the ships
That might break them free
Aye, sir
When Kirk hears this order, he shakes his head slightly and mouths the word "no" under his breath
He knows that won't work
(continuing; shakes her head) There's too much quantum interference, Captain
Harriman frowns again, trying to come up with another solution, but it isn't easy -- it's his first day in command; his ship is under-manned and ill-prepared
It's a nightmare come true
Kirk is itching to get in On this, his fingers digging into the arms of his chair -- but he restrains himself
What about
venting plasma from the warp nacelles
That might disrupt the ribbon's hold on the ships
Aye, sir
releasing drive plasma
tense beat
Harriman glances over at the journalists, then glances over at Kirk
Kirk gives him a pained smile, trying to be encouraging even though he knows this is not the right course of action
(continuing) It's not having any effect, sir
think -- Sir
The starboard vessel's hull is collapsing -- 15B     (-)                                 15B Suddenly the right-hand ship on the screen is engulfed by a fiery  of energy and it
The other ship continues to be thrown about and buffeted
Everyone reacts with shock on the Bridge
How many people were aboard that ship
Two hundred sixty-five
Harriman pales at the sight
seems shell-shocked by the destruction of the ship
He's overwhelmed now, at a genuine loss as to what to do next
(urgent) The Lakul's hull integrity is down to twelve percent, sir
Harriman looks over at Kirk, who has remained quiet during this entire sequence only through great effort and out of deference to the young Captain
This is a delicate moment -- Harriman doesn't want to look incapable, but at the same time, he needs help
Captain Kirk
would appreciate any
suggestions you might have
Kirk is out of his chair like a cork out of a bottle
He moves down to stand next to Harriman
(sotto) First -- move us within transporter range and beam those people to the Enterprise
Harriman looks at him with surprise
What about the gravimetric distortions
They'll tear us apart
(gently) Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair
Kirk gives him a supportive look
Harriman buckles down and grimly looks at the image on the screen
Helm, close to within transporter range
Kirk glances at the Cameraman, who's still shining the light on them  all
And second -- turn that damned thing off
The cameraman turns  the light
: 16
- - (-)                           16 The ship edges in yet closer to the crackling ribbon
The tendrils from the ribbon lash out at the ship, just missing it
17
- -                                   17 As before
We're within range, sir
(to lieutenant) Beam them directly to Sickbay
(concerned) How big's your medical staff
(embarrassed) The medical staff
doesn't arrive until Tuesday
Chekov turns to the two journalists
You and you
You've just become nurses
Let's go
Chekov and the journalists  to the turbolift
Main Engineering reports fluctuations in the warp plasma relays
By-pass the relays and go to auxiliary systems
The  is having problems at the aft console
Sir, 'm having trouble locking onto them
They appear to be
in some sort of
temporal flux
Kirk turns to Scotty
Scotty
Scotty quickly moves to look at the Transporter console
What the hell
Kirk moves to him
Their life signs are
are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum
Phasing
To where
Scotty begins to work
Sir
Their hull's collapsing
18
-   (-)                               18 The ship is destroyed by an energy tendril
19
- -                                   19 All eyes on Scotty
got forty-seven of them
(beat, grim) out of one hundred fifty
Suddenly the ship is rocked violently
and alarms start to wail and the lights  on and off
, sending metal fragments screaming across the Bridge and  the Navigator
Scotty quickly takes over the dead man's console
Report
We're caught in a gravimetric field emanating from the trailing edge of the ribbon
All engines, full reverse
20
- - &  (-)                   20 The ship is turning sideways into the  of the ribbon, but cannot break away
It is clearly being pulled along, out of control
Tendrils leap up from the ribbon, lashing against the ship
21
--                                   21 The room is filled with the  of the Lakul
They are all members of the -  race -- humanoid and dressed in distinctive clothing
The survivors are in various states of shock
Many sit on the floor, staring into middle distance
some lie on tables, unconscious
others are mumbling incoherently to themselves
Chekov and the Journalists are moving from person to person trying to get control of the situation as the ship is  and  about
Chekov has a tricorder
(incoherent, overlapping) The colors are touching me
'm caught in the glass
Help me
can see the seconds
Over here
etc It will be all right
We're going to take care of you
He looks at the tricorder
(off tricorder) Only minor injuries so far
(beat) But it looks like they're all suffering from some kind of neural shock
One Journalist moves past a man sitting on a bio-bed with a dazed look on his face
He has a nasty-looking wound on one side of his face
(We will later learn that this man is named
) The journalist is about to turn away when suddenly Soran  him roughly -- clearly a man of great Strength -- and pulls him close
Soran's eyes are suddenly wild, crazed
Why
why
It's all right
you're safe
you're on the Enterprise
No
have to go
have to get back
You don't understand
Let me go
Soran begins to attack the journalist, but before he can do any real damage, Chekov injects Soran with a hypospray and Soran falls unconscious
What was he talking about
Suddenly a  with her back toward us stumbles nearby
Chekov quickly grabs her arm and catches her before she falls
Easy there
The woman turns around and we see her face for the first time -- it's
She seems dazed and confused
Chekov smiles at her warmly
It's going to be okay
Here, just lie down
As he guides Guinan onto a table

- -  (-)                          22 Energy ribbon on viewscreen
Inertial dampers failing
Engines not responding
Harriman is gripping the arms of his chair with one hand
His face pales
(quiet) didn't expect to die my first day on the job
Kirk tries to buck up the young captain
(sotto) The first thing you learn as Captain is how to cheat death
(beat, then louder) Scotty
(outraged) There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude
Hull integrity failing
Kirk looks at Scotty expectantly for a moment
(continuing) But  do have a theory
thought you might
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead
it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away
photon torpedo
Aye
(quickly, to Demora) Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command
Demora turns to him
Captain
we don't have any torpedoes
Kirk glances at Harriman
Don't tell me
Tuesday
Harriman nods, a little embarrassed
The  gets worse
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish
(onto the idea) Where are the deflector relays
Deck fifteen, section twenty-one alpha (to Kirk) 'll go
You have the Bridge
Harriman heads for the turbolift, and there is a moment as Kirk is sorely tempted to take command of the ship and sit in the Captain's chair one more time
But he pulls himself back before Harriman can exit
No
a Captain's place is on the Bridge of his ship
(beat) 'll take care of it
Harriman nods in acknowledgement
Kirk heads for the turbolift
(on the move, to Scotty) Keep her together until  get back
(matter of fact) always do
Kirk smiles as the turbolift doors slide shut
23                                                        23 24

Kirk rushes in and rips off one of the large wall panels
He quickly begins to re-route cabling and circuitry
26
- -                                   26 As before
The ship is  badly
Forty-five seconds to structural collapse
Scotty is working the consoles frantically
Bridge to Captain Kirk
: 27
- -                            27 Kirk working furiously
Kirk here
Captain,  don't know how much longer  can hold her together
Kirk finishes working and slams the wall panel closed
That's it
Go
28
- -                                   28 As before
(to Demora) Activate main deflector
Demora works the console

We're breaking free
31
- - (-)                           31 The ship now begins to turn away from the crackling ribbon
But just as it's turning, one final  of energy suddenly leaps out and hits the ship
32                                                        32 33
- -                                   33 The ship is  so hard that everyone is knocked off their feet
Gradually, the
Demora scrambles back into position
We're clear
Everyone reacts with relief
(excited, to com) You did it, Kirk
(to Demora) Damage report, Ensign
(off console) There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle
(reacts) We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section
Emergency forcefields are in place and holding
Where
Sections twenty through twenty- eight on decks thirteen
fourteen
(looks at Scotty with meaning) and fifteen
Everyone turns around and looks at Scotty
(to com) Bridge to Captain Kirk
(beat) Captain Kirk, please respond
Still no response
Scotty's face falls
(continuing, to Demora) Have Chekov meet me on deck fifteen
Harriman, very concerned, gets up and follows Scotty
They  to the Turbolift
: 34
- -                                 34 Scotty and Harriman head down the Corridor
They round a bend
and then stop short
They react to something ahead of them

flickers on and off, holding the vacuum of space at bay
Scotty and Harriman look at the awesome sight for a moment
Chekov comes running up the Corridor behind them
He stops and reacts
My God
(beat) Was anyone in there
long silent beat as Scotty looks out into space
Aye

- - (-)                           36 huge chunk has been ripped out of the Engineering section, looking like an open wound
Scotty, Chekov, and Harriman can be seen standing inside the small Corridor, looking out into space
37
--                                    37 short time later
Scotty, Harriman and Chekov are listening to Demora, who is working the Helm console
've checked the entire ship and the surrounding space
there's no sign of him
silent moment
Chekov looks to Scotty, hoping to hear some sort of miracle
Scotty takes a moment looks at the empty command chair
Then he shakes his head
long beat as everyone is forced to accept this terrible truth
(quiet) Just a quick
run around the block
never thought it would end like this
All things must end, Mr
Chekov
Harriman finally breaks the stillness of the Bridge
Let's go home
Harriman steps down to the Captain's chair and takes command of his ship
Scotty and Chekov exchange a final look
Off the reactions of these two friends who've just lost someone very dear to them both

Everyone is dressed in full-dress naval uniforms of the period, complete with cocked hats, epaulettes, etc
The crew is standing at attention

Picard moves to Worf and peers at him closely
Mister Worf
always knew this day would come
Are you prepared to face the charges
Worf doesn't answer and Troi jabs him in the side
Answer him
am prepared
Picard looks to Riker, who then pulls out a large, rolled piece of parchment
He opens the scroll and begins to read from it
In the b

Geordi removes Worf's shackles

That he has been a good and solid officer on this ship for one score less twelve years
And Three
Most seriously
that he has earned the respect and admiration of the entire crew

Picard continues to smile at him for a moment

Worf's face registers surprise as everyone and hauls him toward the side, where a long plank is being pushed out over the water
Into the sea with him
feed him to the sharks

Picard gives Riker a questioning look
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One
When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember
Picard shrugs it off
it's not exactly his cup of tea, but he'll go along with it
Worf is hustled to the rail where  is waiting patiently by the plank, holding a long
Worf is put on the plank and Crusher prods him with the pike until Worf is nearly at the end

It's all done in good fun, Data
Get in the spirit of things
Ah
Data thinks a moment, then he  Beverly with one hand and hold her over the rail

Data lets go and Beverly  into the ocean
Data looks around -- no one is laughing
They all look a little surprised

Well, now that we're all aboard

Aye, aye, sir

They're all back in uniform, holding phasers and palm beacons
Worf has a tricorder and Beverly has a medical kit
The room is cramped, there are fallen bulk-heads and blown-out consoles

These blast patterns are consistent with type-three disruptors
Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan
Beverly follows her tricorder readings

That rules out Klingons
Riker gives him a look
They would not have left anyone alive
Over here
They pick their way carefully through the carnage of the station
and come to the body of a Starfleet Science Officer
He has taken a disruptor blast to the back and there is a nasty-looking scorch mark on his uniform
Beverly immediately takes some devices out of her medical kit and begins to treat him
Worf, you're with me
Paskall, you and Mendez search the upper deck
The Security Guards climb a nearby ladder while Riker and Worf head down a dimly-lit corridor
Riker stops at two bodies in the hall, checks them over -- but they're dead

He puts Spot down and moves to a bulkhead
He activates a control panel and a small compartment slides , revealing a small    which is suspended in a glass and metal framework
Data looks at the chip for a beat and Geordi moves to him in concern
Data
you're not thinking about using that thing are you
It has occurred to me on several occasions
But  believe this may be the appropriate time
Wait a minute
thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net
That is true
However,  believe my growth as an artificial life form has reached an impasse
For thirty-four years  have endeavored to become more "human" - to grow beyond my original programming
And yet  am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor
(re: chip) This emotion chip is the only answer
Geordi considers a moment, looks at the chip
and reluctantly has to agree
All right

Picard seems distracted during the scene, his mind clearly elsewhere as Riker finishes his report
We found two dead Romulans aboard the station
We're analyzing their equipment to see if we can determine what ship they came from
Picard nods absently
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station
We think they were looking for something -- they practically tore the place apart
Hmm
(beat) Inform Starfleet Command
This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector
You want me to contact Starfleet
Is there a problem
No, sir
Thank you, Number One
Picard keeps his back turned, looking out the window
Riker hesitates, awkward
There is something else, Captain
One of the scientists
a Doctor Soran
has insisted on speaking with you

Understood
That will be all

No
Thank you

Guinan comes over -- she has not aged at all since the Enterprise-
She sets down an exotic-looking container full of dark liquid
You two just volunteered to be my first victims
(re: liquid) This is a new concoction picked up on Forcas Three
Trust me, you're going to love it
She pours two glasses of the liquid
Data takes one and sniffs it, then takes a drink
Geordi watches him closely
Data frowns
Well
believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response
Really
What do you feel
am uncertain
have had little experience with emotions
am unable to articulate the sensation
Emotions

concentrates, tries to make sense of the rush of feelings
His expression is one of disgust

Soran is sitting at the table, staring out at the stars, lost in thought
His observatory uniform is distinctive, and sets him apart from everyone else in the room
Picard walks up to the table
Doctor Soran
Yes, yes, Captain -- thank you for coming
The men shake hands and Picard sits down
Soran is an imposing physical presence, but at the moment he seems very much the eccentric scientists consumed with his work
Picard waves away a waiter
Nothing for me
(brusque, to Soran) understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me
Yes
need to return to the observatory immediately
must continue a critical experiment was running on the Amargosa star
Picard's reaction is a little impatient -- this doesn't sound that imperative to him
Doctor
we're still conducting an investigation into the attack
Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory
Until then -- The timing is very important on my experiment -- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost
We're doing the best we can
Now if you'll excuse me
Picard moves to stand, but Soran reaches out and gently but firmly grabs him by the arm
The unexpected physical contact and the change of intensity in Soran's face stops Picard in his tracks
(cryptically) They say time is the fire in which we burn
and right now, Captain, my time is running out
(beat) We leave so many things unfinished in our lives -- 'm sure you can understand
For some reason, Soran's words have struck a deep chord within Picard
He looks away from Soran's compelling gaze and thinks for a long moment
When he finally speaks, his voice is barely above a whisper
'll see what  can do
Picard walks away without a word before Soran can thank him
Soran looks after him with relief, then pulls out an    and opens it
He looks at the watch for a long moment
then snaps it closed and head for the opposite exit from the one Picard took

She turns, looks in the direction where Soran was just standing, but there's no one there now
She shakes off the feeling and goes back to work

Romulan tricorder is connected to some diagnostic equipment near a console
Worf is talking to Riker
Worf activates a  which shows a complex diagram of sensor information
One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder
We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium
Trilithium
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on
In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon
But they never found a way to stabilize it
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory
It doesn't make any sense
Riker considers
(cont'd) Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team
tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium
Aye, sir

62 The station is still a wreck
Geordi and Data are scanning the room with tricorders
(off tricorder) There's no sign of any trilithium in here
Geordi continues to scan
then suddenly Data lets out a quiet
Geordi stops and turns to look at him
Data giggles louder
(laughing, to himself) get it
get it
You get what
Data laughs again
When you said to Commander Riker
(imitating Geordi's voice) "The clown can stay, but the Ferengi in the gorilla suit has to go

What
During the Farpoint mission
We were on the Bridge and you told a joke
That was the punch line

Geordi runs his finger in a vertical line along what appears to be a smooth bulkhead

Data steps forward and  a small panel on wrist and makes a quick adjustment to the circuitry within

They put their tricorders away and begin looking around the room
Data continues to snicker and giggle as he tries not to laugh at jokes his mind conjures up
Geordi begins inspecting the probes
finally stops at one probe which has    attached to the side
Data, take a look at this
(Data comes over) You ever seen a solar probe with this kind of configuration
Data uses the tricorder as if it were a puppet as he opens and closes it like a mouth
(making tricorder "talk") No, Geordi
have not
It is most unusual
Data giggles and Geordi reacts with the irritation of someone listening to a very bad comedian
Just help me get this panel open
Data helps Geordi as they try to open a panel on the casing of the probe
They open the panel and Geordi looks inside
he reacts to something
Whoa

There's a damping field in here blocking our com signal

Over the above dialogue, Soran glances over at the solar probe Geordi was inspecting
He notes the opened panel and a disturbed look crosses his face
Soran looks back at Geordi
'd be happy to
Soran moves toward them

Well
appreciate your concern, but 'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you
But Troi won't be brushed away so easily

It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies
(sensing more) But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it
can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you
In a way, he was as close as ever came to having a child of my own
Troi eyes an open photo album on the table
She reaches over and flips through the pages for a moment
There are many photos inside
from many periods in time including one of Picard's brother standing next to his young son
This is the Picard family album
Your family history is very important to you, isn't it
(nods) Ever since  was a little boy, remember hearing about the family line
The Picards that fought at Trafalgar
the Picard's that settled the first Martian colony
When my brother married and had a son
Picard hesitates -- this is difficult for him
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line
(nods) My brother had shouldered that burden
allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs
There's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life
your own career
Picard moves to the window, stares outside
shadow crosses his face
He's getting to the heart of the matter
You know, Counselor

Beverly activates the wall monitor and a picture of Doctor Soran along with some biographical information appears
He's an El-Aurian
over three hundred years old
He lost his entire family when the Borg destroyed his world
Soran escaped with a handful of other refugees aboard a ship called the Lakul
The ship was destroyed by some kind of energy ribbon, but Soran and forty-six others were rescued by the Enterprise-

Soran
That's a name  haven't heard in a long time
Guinan's Quarters, which are unlike any of the others on the Enterprise
None of the standard furniture, consoles or decoration are present
The floor is made of tile, not carpet
the walls are draped in exotic fabric
The lighting is moody and subdued
Picard is standing before Guinan, who is sitting cross- legged on the floor
They talk to each other with an easy familiarity
two old friends who know each other well
Do you remember him
Oh yes
remember everyone who was on the Lakul
every face
even the ones who didn't make it
Guinan stands and begins to move about the room
she's clearly troubled by the memories
She hesitates, looks off into the middle-distance for a few moments
Picard moves to her
Guinan
It's important that you tell me what you know
We think Soran's developed a weapon
a terrible weapon
It might give him enough power to -- Soran doesn't care about power or weapons
All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus
What's the "Nexus"
Guinan moves to a table and begins to shift around some exotic-looking alien artifacts
distracting herself
this is difficult for her to discuss
It's a place 've tried very hard to forget
She makes the decision to plunge ahead
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon traveling through space
it's a doorway
It leads to another place
the Nexus
It doesn't exist in our Universe
and it doesn't play by the same rules either
What happened to you
can't remember very much
what it looked like or how long  was there
but  do remember how it felt
She turns to him and her face is filled with some kind of awe at the memory
It was like being inside
joy
As if joy was a real thing that could wrap around myself

But then you were beamed away
Guinan shows a rare burst of anger
was pulled away
didn't want to leave; none of us did
felt like 'd left a part of myself behind
All  could think about was getting back
didn't care what  had to do
Guinan moves to a window and looks out at the stars
It took a long time, but eventually  learned to live with it
And  began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me

about events
about time
Your "sixth sense"
've always wondered where it came from
(beat) And what about Soran
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back
And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again
But why destroy a star
(beat) Thank you, Guinan
He heads for the door
Let someone else do it, Jean-Luc
Picard stops, looks at her
Let them send another starship
Don't get near the ribbon
If you go into that Nexus, you're not going to care about Soran or the Enterprise or me

What's normal
Normal is what everyone else is

Some people call us a race of "listeners"
We listen

It felt like an eternity, didn't it
Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage
No
didn't know that
We learn something new about ourselves every day

Maybe  didn't make myself clear
It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows
told you everything

Soran's features soften as he smiles slightly
For a moment, he looks genuinely compassionate -- and it's a disturbing contrast to his usual dark intensity

Data is sitting at a computer console which has a great deal of complex information on the screen
Picard is standing next to him
Throughout the following, Data seems distracted and preoccupied
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every thirty-nine point one years When is it expected back
Data doesn't answer right away
Data
Sorry, Captain
The Ribbon has already entered the galaxy
It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours
Picard moves about the room
he's frustrated
tired
but determined to find out what's going on
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon
if that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector
However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon
Give me a list of those effects
want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed
no matter how insignificant
It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information
Data works the computer and then the computer begins to work
Data sighs -- his expression becomes downcast and gloomy
He sits down and puts his head in his hands
Picard finally has to say something
Data, are you all right
No, sir
am finding it difficult to concentrate believe  am overwhelmed with feelings of
remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory
What do you mean
wanted to save Geordi tried
but  experienced something  did not expect
(beat) believe it was fear
Picard regards him sympathetically
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome
It's something we all have to learn to deal with
But  did not deal with it, sir
let it prevent me from helping my friend
(beat) Does that make me a coward
No
And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which  believe you're beginning to experience
guilt
(considers) Guilt
It is a most unpleasant feeling

According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by five percent
the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction
a research project on Gorik Four was halted due to increased neutrino particles
ambient magnetic fields have decreased by -- Wait
The Bozeman
why did it change course
(matter of fact) The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector
Any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction

He moves to a large table in the center of the room

shows the position of the ribbon
This is its current position

still obsessed with his own emotional turmoil
Picard finally has to lay down the law

But right now,  need your full attention on the task at hand
If you can't provide it
then 'll have to relieve you of duty until Doctor Crusher can remove this
emotion chip of yours
'm sorry, but you leave me no other choice
This snaps Data back
he considers this for a long moment, then looks  determined
do not wish to remove the chip, sir
Although these emotions are proving difficult to deal with
cannot imagine going back to a life without them

Picard is beginning to realize what's going on
That's what Soran's doing
he's changing its course
(beat) But why
Why try to alter its path
why not simply fly into it with a ship
Data thinks for a moment
Our records show that every ship which has approached the ribbon has either been destroyed or severely damaged
Picard thinks about this
then has a flash of insight
He can't go to the ribbon

He stands and turns away from the tree and looks out a nearby window -- it's snowing and the beautiful image of snow soothes him for a moment
Then he reacts to something
160   '  (-)                                       160 reflected on the pane of glass is the image of the ornament -- it's still blinking
Picard now realizes that this image is not going to go away
he can't hide from it
No
this isn't right
this can't be real
' It's as real as you want it to be
Picard turns to see 161    (-)                                             161 standing before him
She is wearing the same outfit seen in the beginning of the movie on the Enterprise-
As they talk, the children and the woman continue to move about their business as if Picard and Guinan aren't there
Picard is stunned
Guinan
what's going on
Where am
You're in the Nexus
Picard looks around
This
is the Nexus
For you
This is where you wanted to be
But  never had a wife, children, a home like this
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc
Picard tries to make sense of it- he focuses on Guinan
Guinan, what are you doing here
thought you were on the Enterprise
am on the Enterprise
am also here
(off his puzzled look) Think of me as
an "echo" of the person you know
a part of her she left behind
Left behind
When the Enterprise- beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus
The transporters locked on to us
but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind
Soran
All of us
Where is he now
Wherever he wanted to be
Guinan smiles at him
' Papa, help me build my castle
Picard glances over at the boy, who is building a play castle out of the 24th-century equivalent of "Lego"
For a moment, Picard is tempted to drift back to the warm embrace of the fantasy
(to boy) In a few minutes
Picard looks around at the children
the lure to stay here becoming more powerful
(continuing, awed, to Guinan) These are my children
my children
(smiles) Yeah
They're great, aren't they
You can go back and see them born
go forward and see your grandchildren
time has no meaning here
' Dinner's ready
Let's go
There's a general rush toward the adjacent dining room
The youngest boy looks at Picard, goes over to him and takes his hand
Papa
are you coming
Picard looks down into the face of his child
His heart swells, the temptation to stay here and live this out is profound
Almost in a trance, he takes a few steps with the child toward the dining room
His eye is caught again by the unusual ornament on the tree for a moment
torn between the two images
and then, in one of the most difficult moments of his life, he bends down to the child
Go on
go on without me
The boy looks at him quizzically for a moment, then obeys his father and dashes off toward the dining room to join the others
Picard straightens up and tries to steel his voice
Guinan
can  leave the Nexus
Why would you want to leave
(insistent) Can
Yes
where would you go
don't understand
told you, time has no meaning here
If you leave, you can go anywhere
any time
Picard realizes the opportunity before him
know exactly where  want to go
and when
Back to that mountaintop on Veridian Three
before Soran put out the star have to stop him
What makes you think things will be any different this time
You're right
'll need help
(beat) Guinan, will you come back with me
Together, we could -- can't leave
'm already there, remember
Picard looks crestfallen for a moment
Guinan gives him an enigmatic smile
know just the guy
Suddenly there's the cry of a  from offscreen
Picard turns at the sound -- 162
'  -                                      162 Picard finds himself standing outside a rustic, but Architecturally striking house with spectacular views in the Canadian Rockies
hawk is circling overhead, making the crying sound that Picard heard
The air is cold, frigid -- Picard can see his breath
Picard is just starting to adjust to this sudden change in location when he hears the sound of wood being from around the corner of the house
Picard moves to look around the corner and sees - James
Kirk
He's still in his uniform and looks exactly as he did the last time we saw him aboard the Enterprise- at the beginning of the film
He is vigorously chopping wood with an axe
He's enjoying himself, lost in the sheer pleasure of the manual labor
He's never felt this good in his life
There's no trace of back pain or any other ailment
Picard recognizes the famous Captain - as would any 24 Century Starfleet officer
James Kirk
Kirk pauses, looks up at the strange man before him
His expression is wondrous, almost child-like
Like in Picard's Christmas sequence, Kirk is immersed in the sensual feeling of the Nexus
It's like a dream that's over-powered him
Beautiful day, isn't it
Yes
yes, it is
Kirk points to a nearby log on the woodpile
Do you mind
It takes Picard a beat before he realizes that Kirk wants him to put the log on the chopping block for him
Oh
Picard places the log on the block and Kirk gives it a vigorous chop with the axe
Captain, do you realize what -- But Kirk interrupts as he sees something o
c
Wait a second
think something's burning
Picard follows his look to see  billowing out of one of the windows of the house
Kirk rushes into the house, and Picard follows
163
' -  -  -                163 Kirk rushes in
The kitchen's decor is 19th century with a few 23rd Century touches -- copper pans and an antique stove mixed comfortably with computer consoles and Starfleet paraphernalia
Picard hesitates in the doorway -- a little unsure about rushing into some stranger's house
Kirk yanks a burning frying pan of food off the stove
It's very hot -- he quickly sets it down near the sink, waves the smoke away with his hand
Looks like someone was cooking eggs
(to Picard) Come on in, it's all right
This is my house -- or at least it used to be,  sold it years ago
Picard comes in and tries to orient Kirk to what's going on
'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the starship Enterprise
Before Kirk can react to this remark, an antique on a shelf  as it strikes the hour
Kirk moves to the shelf and looks at the clock in surprise and wonder -- he is entranced by this experience, beginning to connect with things and memories from his past
This clock
gave this clock to Bones
(pressing on) 'm from what you would consider the future
the twenty-fourth century
Kirk hears what Picard is saying, but like Picard in his fantasy, he is more interested in the sights and sounds around him
dog barks from o
c
They both look as a large black dog bounds into the room and greets Kirk with enthusiasm
(affectionately) Jake
Jake, you miserable old Mutt
How can you be here
(to Picard) He's been dead seven years
Kirk is still looking around the kitchen when suddenly we hear a '  from somewhere upstairs that stops Kirk in his tracks
As she speaks, we can see the shock on Kirk's face
' Come on, Jim, 'm starving
How long are you going to be rattling around that kitchen
beat
(amazed) That's Antonia
Kirk looks at the food on the stove
He's beginning to realize something
Wait a minute
Kirk glances at Picard
The future
what are you talking about
This is the past
Kirk moves to a drawer and opens it
Inside is a with a tiny red bow tied to it
This confirms things for Kirk
He picks up the horseshoe
This is nine years ago
the day told her  was going back to Starfleet
Kirk is swept up in the moment, overwhelmed by memories, sensations, feelings
He goes back to the frying pan and looks at the contents with a sudden burst of recognition
These were Ktarian eggs -- her favorite
was cooking them to soften the blow
(re: horseshoe) And  gave her this
Picard steps in
know how real this must seem to you, but it's not
This isn't Really your house
We've both been caught up in some sort of temporal nexus
But Kirk's mind is clearly elsewhere
he's being swept away by the emotion of the moment
realizing the opportunity he suddenly has
Dill weed
Kirk indicates a shelf, as if asking Picard to go to it
There's a bottle of dill weed on the second shelf to the left, right behind the nutmeg
Kirk moves to the stove and tosses out the ruined eggs
He cracks open two new eggs on the skillet and begins preparing a breakfast
Picard waits for a moment, then goes to the shelf, grabs the dill weed and hands it to Kirk
How long have you been here
Kirk takes the bottle and uses it to season the eggs
don't know
was on the Enterprise-
in the deflector control room
keep stirring these, will you
Kirk moves to a cabinet and begins putting plates on a breakfast tray
Picard is getting a little impatient, but stirs the eggs anyway
(continuing) The bulkhead in front of me Disappeared
then  was out there chopping wood
(back to stove) Thanks
Kirk takes the pan of eggs back from Picard
History records that you died saving the Enterprise- from an energy ribbon eighty years ago
But Picard's words mean almost nothing to Kirk
He is Thoroughly enjoying himself and Picard is almost a distraction
Kirk begins serving the eggs onto the plates and grabs a small vase of flowers to put on the tray
(amused) So you're telling me this is the twenty-fourth century
and 'm dead
Not exactly
As  said, this is some kind of
Temporal nexus
yeah,  heard you
(frowns at tray) Something's missing
Then he remembers and turns to look at a nearby toaster -- as if on cue, two slices of toast pop out
Kirk grins and puts the toast on the plates
Kirk picks up the tray and heads for the door
Captain,  need your help
want you to leave the Nexus with me
Kirk goes out of the kitchen and Picard follows
164
'  -   -  -           164 Kirk and Picard both on the move
Kirk heading for a staircase
We have to go back to a planet called Veridian  and stop a man from destroying a star
There are millions of lives at stake
Kirk tries to keep it light, hoping this man will go away
You said history considers me dead
Who am  to argue with history
You're a Starfleet Officer and you have a duty to -- (hard) don't need to be lectured by you
was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers
And frankly,  think the galaxy owes me one (beat) was like you once
so worried about duty and obligations that couldn't see anything past this uniform
And in the end, what did it get me
Nothing
Not this time
Kirk brushes past Picard and stops at the foot of the stairs
(looking up the stairs) 'm going to walk up these stairs, march into that bedroom and tell Antonia that  want to marry her
Kirk begins to climb the stairs
This time things are going to be different
He goes through a bedroom door and closes it behind him
Picard glances around the room in frustration, then gets a determined look on his face and marches up the stairs after Kirk, grasps the doorknob, opens it and steps through the door into 165
-  -                                165 Picard suddenly finds himself standing in the doorway of a wooden barn
Straw on the floor
farm implements on the walls
sunlight streaming in through the slats
There are stalls in the barn with a few horses visible
Kirk is standing a short distance away -- he looks surprised as well
and he is no longer holding the tray of food
(re: barn) This doesn't look like your bedroom
Kirk looks around for a moment, the pieces starting to fall into place
He smiles with a growing realization
No
no, it's not
It's better
Better
This is my uncle's barn in Iowa
He points to a horse with a saddle on it
(re: horse) took that horse out for a ride seven years ago
on a spring day
Kirk moves to the barn door and opens it revealing a beautiful spring day
Just like this
If 'm right, this is the day  met Antonia
He turns to Picard
This Nexus of yours is very clever
can start all over again -- do things right from day one
Kirk grabs the horse, swings up onto the saddle, and rides out of the barn, filled with excitement
Picard watches him for a moment, then looks at one of the other horses in the barn
he makes a decision and then moves toward a saddle hanging on the wall
: 166
-  (-)                             166 Kirk is riding his horse hard over the countryside -- and across a stream
through a thicket of trees
and finally out onto a rolling plain
There is a large up ahead
Kirk sees it and smiles tightly
He spurs his horse faster toward the ravine
The horse is tearing along
comes up to the edge of the precipice, and makes a daring leap to the other side
Horse and rider land together and Kirk spurs the horse on
But as he rides, we begin to see a change come over him -- a look of doubt crosses his face
Something's not right
He slows the horse to a trot
and then to a complete stop
He sits there for a moment and frowns
turns and looks back at the ravine, which is now a fair distance away
Something about that jump is nagging at him
He turns his horse around and then digs in his heels
The horse breaks into a gallop, racing back toward the ravine
Kirk grips the reins tight in his hands and then the horse makes the  across yet again
This time when Kirk lands, he brings his horse to an immediate stop
We can see on his face that something is very wrong
He turns and stares at the ravine with a mixture of shock and sadness on his face
In the distance, Picard can be seen approaching on a horse of his own
He stops next to Kirk
There is a long, quiet moment as the two men sit there side by side
Kirk is introspective as he sorts through his feelings
(re: ravine) must have made this jump fifty times
and every time it scared the hell out of me
But not this time
(beat) Because
it's not real
quiet beat
Kirk turns and looks toward a particular hill in the distance, shading his eyes against the bright sun
Picard follows his gaze and we can now see the distant figure of a  walking her horse
(re: woman) Antonia
(nods) She's not real either, is she
Nothing here is
nothing here matters
All euphoria is now gone from Kirk -- It's a moment of self-revelation
He glances around
It's kinda like
orbital skydiving
Exciting for a few minutes
but in the end, you haven't really done anything
you haven't made a difference
Kirk takes a beat, then looks at Picard
And in a way, he's truly seeing him for the first time
Captain of the Enterprise, huh
That's right
Close to retirement
hadn't planned on it
There is a passion and a fervor in Kirk that we haven't seen until now
Well, let me tell you something - don't
Don't let them promote you
don't let them transfer you
don't let anything take you off the Bridge of that ship
(beat) Because while you're there, you can make a difference
The two captains face each other for a moment
Picard hears what Kirk is saying but also knows that's not the whole story
Picard gives him a direct look, and there is something in Picard's eyes -- a glint of resolve and determination
You don't need to be on the Bridge of a starship
Come with me
Help me stop Soran
(beat) Make a difference again
long, silent beat as Kirk considers Picard
And slowly, unexpectedly, a smile spreads across his face
How can  argue with the Captain of the Enterprise
(a beat) What was the name of that Planet
Veridian
That's right
take it the odds are against us, and the situation is grim
You could say that
(musing) Of course, if Spock were here, he'd say  was being an irrational, illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that
And for the first time, we can see the twinkle in his eye that tells us Jim Kirk is back
Sounds like fun
The two men turn and walk away from Antonia
and as they walk, a , as seen before

-  (-)                             167 Soran is standing in front of the forcefield, facing Picard
Now, if you'll excuse me, Captain, have an appointment with Eternity and  don't want to be late
We realize we are watching the same events play out again
Soran turns and begins to climb up the scaffolding toward the top of the rock face
Picard drops to the ground on his back and begins to wriggle underneath the forcefield
Picard accidentally  the field
167A    (-)                                             167A turns at the sound of the field, sees Picard, and then draws his weapon
Soran quickly  at Picard

-- Soran jumps down one level, his disruptor still in his hand, ready just in case Picard somehow survived
Soran peers through the cloud of dust and debris
-- The dust
but Picard is gone along with several feet of the ground where he was crawling
167C    (-)                                             167C Soran glances up at the sky and sees the  , then begins to climb the scaffolding
Suddenly a kicks him in the head
168                                                    168 who is attacking Soran in Picard's place
The two men begin to fight
169     (-)                                          169 as Picard rushes to the probe launcher and steps up onto the control platform and desperately begins trying to shut down the launcher
The following happens very quickly: -- Kirk fights with Soran, hand-to-hand, brutal
-- Picard works the control panel, trying to make sense of it all
It won't respond
The control panel is bizarre and confusing -- many different screens and alien graphics
The alien countdown graphics continues to race by
169A     (-)                                           169A the distant energy ribbon can be seen getting closer
169B       					           169B Soran tries to pull his disruptor, but Kirk knocks it to the ground
There's a struggle for the weapon
-- Picard looks helplessly at the control panel
Nothing he does has any effect
He keeps hitting buttons
looking for other control panels, anything to affect the launcher
169C    (-)                                             169C Suddenly, Picard touches one particular control and the screen  to an image of the Veridian , held in the center of the alien -
169D    (-)                                            169D begins working the control panel
desperate
he looks at the screen
hits a control
Suddenly the probe
Picard reacts at his mistake
Picard is left standing on an invisible platform three feet in the air -- a bizarre sight
Picard isn't sure what to do -- he can feel the console, but he can't see any of the controls
-- Kirk punches Soran and sends him flying backward
Soran lands heavily on the ground, unconscious
Kirk stands over him, breathing heavily
He holds his back in pain -- that old back pain from the beginning of the movie
(desperate) Kirk -- there's a control  in his right pocket
169E    (-)                                              169E sees Picard standing in mid-air and then reaches down, pulls the control  out of Soran's pocket
He begins working it
170                                                  170 His eyes open
he sees what Kirk is doing
looks around quickly
sees the disruptor lying a few feet away, just beyond his reach

The twenty-fourth century isn't so tough
Without warning, Kirk is  forward, shot from behind
Reveal Soran on the ground with the disruptor in his hand
He gets up, whirls around, points the weapon at Picard
172    -                                          172 The probe is suddenly  in a roar of flame
Soran freezes
His eyes follow the probe as it arcs into the sky
The two men watch the probe as it heads toward the sun
172A     (-)                                         172A makes a sweeping turn to the right and arcs back down toward the planet
Soran watches in horror as the probe crashes harmlessly into the distant jungle
We hear a muffled explosion
172B    (-)                                             172B can't believe his dreams have been shattered
He looks into the sky and sees the distant ribbon streaking overhead
The disruptor falls from his hand as he rushes to the top of the scaffolding

but the ribbon passes by and disappears
No

He turns to Picard

Kirk's eyes flick open, and he takes a ragged breath
Nice shot
Kirk coughs
His eyes flutter
He's fading fast
'll find a way to contact the Enterprise
You're going to be all right
Did we do it
Did we make a Difference
Yes

Least  could do

Kirk coughs again Try to hang on

What about Doctor Soran
You needn't worry about the Doctor anymore
Picard moves toward the shuttle
