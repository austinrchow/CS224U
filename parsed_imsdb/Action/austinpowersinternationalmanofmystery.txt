As you know, gentlemen, Dr
Evil had himself frozen in 1967
Soon after, Austin Powers volunteered to have himself frozen, in the event Dr
Evil should ever return
We believe Dr
Evil has begun yet another plot to take over the world
And that, gentlemen, is why we're here

Is he a British operative
No, he worked freelance, an internationally renowned swinging photographer by day and the ultimate gentlemen spy by night

His hands cover up his private parts

You're in the Ministry of Defense
It's 1997
You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years
(shouting) The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process
Yes, 'm having trouble controlling&emdash; (shouting) You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation

You'll be working with Ms
Kensington
You mean Mrs
Kensington
No, Austin, Mrs
Kensington has long- since retired
Ms
Kensington is her daughter

She is wearing a very conservative, business pantsuit
Her hair is up and she wears glasses

(out loud, to himself) My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body

How do  tell them that because of the unfreezing process,  have no inner monologue
(pause) hope  didn't say that out loud just now
There is an uncomfortable
Mr
Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties
You know, a lot's changed since 1967
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, 'll be sound as a pound
My mother's told me all about you
If it's a lie, goddamn her
It it's the truth, goddamn me
(pause) God,  hope that's witty
How's your mum
My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much
Yes, well
Agent Kensington will get you set up
She's very dedicated
Perhaps, a little too dedicated

thought  was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country
It's very boring
My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi

That's fascinating, Vanessa
Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag
beg your pardon
've been frozen for thirty years, man,  want to see if my bits and pieces are still working
Excuse me
My wedding tackle

They're not dressed very sexily

We're called 'flight attendants' now, thank you very much
Oh,  get it, it's like ''m not a whore, 'm a sex worker', baby
My name is Mrs
Wilkenson
There are a few things we need to discuss
First of all, we're not wearing these
She holds up some skimpy, lingerie-type flight outfits

Seems pretty straightforward, don't you think
listen darling,  think you're a fabulous bird

The flight attendant gives him a chilly stare and then exits
Brrrr
She must be frigid
There's two things  know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer
Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag
They're shag-mad, man
Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest
Sure
Do  make you horny
What
Do  make you horny
Randy, you know
To you, am  eros manifest
hope this is part of the unfreezing process
Listen, Vanessa, 'm a swinger&emdash; that's what  do,  swing
understand that, Mr
Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting
will never have sex with you, ever
If you were the last man on Earth and  was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation,  still would not have sex with you

There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr
Evil

It's all gone perfectly to plan except for one small flaw
Because of a technical error, my right arm was not frozen
was therefore by definition only partially frozen
He is terrified and sweaty, eyes darting left and right
But my design was perfect
Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left
Can't you see 'm only half a man
Look at me, 'm a freak
He holds up his older right arm, which looks normal
But Dr
Evil, all you need to do is&emdash; (holding up tennis ball) --work with this tennis ball
Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day

Why does everyone always laugh when  say that
They are after me lucky charms
They cannot contain their

Finally,  come to my number two man
His name:  Number Two
, a good-looking 40-year-old man with an eye-patch
For thirty years, Number Two has run Virtucon, the legitimate face of my evil empire
He hits a button
The conference table slowly rotates to reveal a large, illuminated map of the United States dotted by various miniature models
Over the last thirty years, Virtucon has grown by leaps and bounds
About fifteen years ago, we changed from volatile chemicals to the communication industry
We own cable companies in thirty-eight states
The thirty-eight states illuminate on the map
In addition to our cable holdings, we own a steel mill in Cleveland
steel mill miniature illuminates in Cleveland
Shipping in Texas
ship off the coast of Texas illuminates
Oil refineries in Seattle
An oil refinery illuminates in Seattle
And a factory in Chicago that makes miniature models of factories
The miniature model factory lights up in Chicago
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors
(holds up plate) Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved
Gentlemen,  have a plan
It's called blackmail
The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world
Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce
There is an uncomfortable silence
Um, Dr
Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair
He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually
People have to tell me these things
've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here
(pausing) , no problem
Here's my second plan
Back in the Sixties  had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser
"  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer
"  Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer
That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom
There is another uncomfortable silence
Umm, that also has already happened
Right
(pause) Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do
Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage
(pause) Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days
Here's the plan
We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom
(dramatic pause) There is an uncomfortable pause
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars million dollars isn't that much money these days
All right then
(dramatic pause) There is another uncomfortable pause
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year
(pleasantly surprised) Oh, really
(slightly irritated) One-hundred billion dollars
(pause) , make it happen
Anything else
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever
Yes
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient
Dr
Evil,  want you to meet your son
My son
Yes

He is fifteen, grungy, and wears a Kurt Cobain -shirt
Hi
Hello, Scott

The glove compartment revolves to reveal a display of various dental hygiene products&emdash; floss, toothpaste, toothbrush, dental mirror, and cleaning tool
Let me guess
The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device

Personally, before 'm on the job, like to give my undercarriage a bit of a how's-your-father
(off her angry reaction) 'm just joking, Vanessa
Trying to get a rise out of you
They both laugh
Let's unpack
:  In the inside flap is a types list of contents
All of her items are in separate, labeled plastic bags
Gor blimey, nerd alert
:  He pulls out a Nehru jacket and a huge Remington shaver with huge English plug
:  She pulls out a compact clothes steamer/travel iron and a Braun blow drier
:  He pulls out a vintage 1967 Playboy and a bottle of Jurgens lotion

" :  He pulls out the Swedish penis enlarger pump
Vanessa sees it
Hey, who put this in here
Someone's playing a prank on me
Honestly, this isn't mine
(suffering) 'm sure
think 'll give that stew a ding-a- ling
Austin casually dials the phone while looking at his palm
After a beat we hear a loud   coming through the handset
(through handset) Hello
And welcome to 777-
Austin covers the mouthpiece and whispers to Vanessa
got her answering machine
Austin and Vanessa walk through the casino
Austin gives two-handed handshakes
They stare like he's a freak
love Las Vegas, man
Oh,  forgot my x-ray glasses
Here, use mine
'm going to use a cover name
It's important that it be a generic name so that we don't draw attention to ourselves
Austin and Vanessa join the high-rollers table
Number Two is there, complete with eyepatch
On one side of him is a beautiful   (a la  ) in a white dress with a white kerchief on her head
On the other side of him is an extremely large-breasted
Do you mind if  join you
Not at all
The  deals
Seventeen
Zoom in on Number Two's eyepatch
' :  "- "
We see everyone at the casino in their underwear
He looks at the next card in the shoe
It is a 4
Hit me
You have seventeen, sir
The book says not to, sir
like to live dangerously
The dealer draws a card from the card shoe
Four
Twenty-one
Everyone at the table applauds
The dealer deals to Austin and Number Two
(to Austin) Eighteen
(to Number Two) Sixteen
' :  "- "
He looks at the shoe at the shoe and sees that the next card is a ten
'll stay
(to Austin) Sir
Smugly, Austin puts on Vanessa's x-ray glasses
' :  "- "
Everyone is in their underwear, but it is completely blurry
(to Austin) Sir
(quietly) What's wrong
(quietly, to Vanessa) can't see a bloody thing
Oh,  forgot to tell you, they're prescription -ray glasses
have very bad astigmatism
Sir, the table is waiting
(panicking) Uh, hit me
The table
On an eighteen, sir
Yes,  also like to live dangerously
The dealer deals him the ten
You're very brave
Cards are not my bag, man
Allow myself to introduce
myself
My name is Ritchie Cunningham
Vanessa is mortified
(indicating Vanessa) This is my wife, Enid
My name is Number Two
He extends his hand to shake
Austin extends his hand, but misses and begins to shake the bimbo's breast
There is an awkward pause
Austin takes off his glasses
(rescuing him) Number Two
That's an unusual name
My parents were hippies
(indicating Italian woman) This is my Italian confidential secretary
(Italian accent) My name is Alotta (quickly) Alotta Fagina
'm sorry, 'm just not getting it
It sounds like you're saying your name is a lot of
never mind
Listen, cats, 'm going to crash
It's been a gas
Bye-bye, Mr
Cunningham
Peace, baby
Austin and Vanessa leave
Why did you leave so soon
That cat Number Two has an -ray eyepatch
get bad vibes from him, man
Listen, we should go back to the room, but first  have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog
He heads to the rest room
- Number Two has been watching them
He presses a
- Austin enters to see a gregarious  in a huge cowboy hat
Austin enters a stall
The Texan enters the adjoining stall
Good luck, buddy
You don't buy food, you rent it
Too right, youth
Austin sits down
Behind him, a panel  , revealing Patty 'Brien
His charm bracelet
Austin looks back
Patty's bracelet is now garotte wire
He wraps it around Austin's throat
Austin gets his thumbs between the wire and certain death
(grunting) Uh, uh
' The Texan can only see Austin's feet, which are moving about frantically
He can hear the Hey pardner, just relax, don't force it
Use some creative visualization
' Austin  and snaps his head back into Patty 'Brien's crotch
Patty 'Brien  in agony
' (groaning) Ughhhhh
Austin breaks free of the charm bracelet/garotte, grabs Patty 'Brien's head, and pulls it between his legs so that it hovers above the toilet bowl
Who does Number Two work for
' That's right
Show that turd who's boss
' Who does Number Two work for
' (quietly, straining) Go to hell
Austin drops Patty's head into the toilet and
We hear    from Patty 'Brien
' The Texan hears all of this, and is now concerned
' Austin reaches into Patty 'Brien's wallet
We see his Dr
Evil  card and Alotta's Virtucon business card with her address
Austin is leaving his stall
The Texan can see Patty 'Brien's dead body head-first in the toilet
Jesus Christ, what did you eat
' Patty 'Brien's lifeless hand hits the floor
The charms come tumbling out: a heart, a moon, a star, and a clover second later, a blue diamond falls out
:  Psychedelic Wa-wa Pedal Funky Drummer Beat :  Love Power Austin and the go-go girl dance crazily
- - Vanessa is on the phone on the bed sifting through photos and files on Dr
Evil, Virtucon, etc
In the background, through an open door, we see that Austin is asleep on the couch
(into phone) Hello Mum
'  - An older Mrs
Kensington sits in her suburban English front room
(on phone) Oh, hello Vanessa
How was the flight
(
) Great
How's Austin
(
) He's asleep
You didn't
Oh, God no,  made him sleep on the couch
In the background, we see Austin get off the couch
He is very naked and very hairy
strategically placed vase of flowers blocks his naughty bits from view
(
) 'm proud of you
Why
(
) Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms
Austin moves towards the bathroom away from the flowers
Right in the nick of time, Vanessa holds up a photo of Number Two and looks at it, blocking his naughty parts
Well, God knows he tried, but 've been rather firm with him, Mummy
You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex
It's bizarre
(
) You can't judge him by modern standards
He's very much a product of his times
In my day he could have any woman he wanted
What about his teeth
-  /
' You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth
It didn't matter
just don't see it
Just wait
Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out
Did you ever
Of course not
was married to your father
Did you ever want to
Austin is very charming, very debonair
He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer
Women want hin, men want to be him
He's a lover of love&emdash; every bit an International Man of Mystery
We hear the
Mrs
Kensington  off the screen
Austin re-enters from left to right, still
Vanessa holds up Austin's Fab Magazine shoot from the Sixties, and in perfect timing blocks his crotch from the camera
You didn't answer my question, Mum
(
) know
Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend ever had
will always love him
(
) Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with
(to her mother) Do you want to talk to him
(
) No, it's been too long
Best to leave things alone
(to Austin) 'm on with a friend
(to her mother) Look, 'd better go
love you
(
) love you, Vanessa
Vanessa hangs up
Austin enters wearing an "Austin Powers" robe
Good morning, Vanessa
hope you have on clean underwear
Why
We've got a doctor's appointment&emdash; an evil doctor's appointment
-  - - We see a black limousine pull up in front
Random Task and another  exit the limo and secure the area
- We see that the binoculars belong to Vanessa
She and Austin are on a stakeout
Austin's Jag is in the background
limousine has just pulled up
Let me see
Austin pulls into frame an extremely long telephoto lens attached to his vintage camera
Two more  leave the building and approach the limo
Number Two exits the building holding Mr
Bigglesworth, the hairless cat
He's not happy about this, and has a scratch on his cheek
:  Camera motor drive
Hello, hello
That's Dr
Evil's cat
How do you know
never forget a pussy
cat
Number Two hands the hairless cat through limo's window
:  Camera motor drive
The limousine speeds off
Let's go get him
He's too well-protected right now
We can't just sit here, Austin
Let me tell you a story
There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below
The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow
', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows
' don't get it
Well, you know
cows, and shagging
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr
Evil has escaped
No worries, luv
We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone
He notices the way the desert light catches her beauty
My God, Vanessa, you are so incredibly beautiful
Stay right where you are
Austin changes lenses and begins
hate having my picture taken
You're crazy
The camera loves you, Vanessa
Vanessa does a few coy poses
Go, Vanessa, go
Vanessa lets go a little bit more
Austin and Vanessa are in the midst of a full professional photo shoot, and she's loving it
Austin begins  pictures, all the while changing her look, touching her hair
Alright, luv
Love it
Turn
pout for me Vanessa
Smashing
Crazy
Give me some shoulder
(pause) Yes
Yes
Yes
He motions to her two top buttons of her blouse
She nods no
Austin nods yes
She sheepishly undoes them of her in various gowns, one more exotic and exciting than the other
Show me love
Yes
(beat) Smashing
Vanessa is flanked by two buff   a la Madonna
Great
Great
Smashing
(beat) Yes
Yes
Yes
(beat) No
No
Love it
Give me love
Give me mouth
Give me lips
() Going in very close now
He goes in closer
Give me eyes
(closer) Give me cornea
(closer) Give me aqueous humour
(closer) Coming in closer
Give me retina, Vanessa
(closer) Even closer
Give me optic nerve
(beat) Love it
(beat) And
done
He throws the camera down
'm spent
What say you we go out on the town
-  - Austin and Vanessa are on the top deck of an open air double- decker English bus having a full-course formal dinner
They're drinking champagne
Austin is cutting sausages into ever-smaller pieces, holding his cutlery very English
He has cut one piece to the point to which it's a speck
puts it on the fork and offers it to her
Fancy a nibble
couldn't have another bite
They laugh
They drink
It's  , serenading them
They begin to dance
Austin gives her roses
Austin is wooing her
- They walk along the brightly-lit streets, laughing, enjoying each other's company
Austin gives Vanessa a pet rock
She graciously accepts
64    - Austin and Vanessa stroll against a changing series of backgrounds&emdash; neon signs, Vegas icons, dice showgirls, etc
Sounds of  and
We see Austin's backside sticking out above a piece of furniture, then Vanessa's high-heeled leg straining upwards
(
) Watch out, you're on my hair
(
) Sorry
Move your hand to the left
There you go
Gorgeous
(
) Go
Just go
We hear a
(
) Left hand, blue
We now see that Austin and Vanessa are playing
She reaches for left hand blue and they fall over, laughing
Wait a tick,  forgot something in the lobby
(moving behind the couch) know what
'll take the stairs
Behind the couch, Austin mimes going down stairs
Maybe 'll take the escalator
Austin mimes the smooth descent of an escalator
Why take the escalator when  could take a canoe
Austin mimes rowing a canoe behind the couch
haven't had fun like that since college
'm sorry
Why
'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die
She laughs too much, making a  sound
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell
No, this is me in a nutshell
Austin mimes being trapped in a nutshell
Help
'm in a nutshell
What kind of nut has such a big nutshell
How did  get into this bloody great big nutshell
Vanessa laughs again, , tipsy
You're smashed, Vanessa
am not
Oh, yes you are
'm not
'm the sensible one
'm always the designated driver
They are both on the bed
She looks at him
He looks at her
There is an awkward silence
She's about to kiss him, then he pulls away
can't
You're drunk
It's not that 'm drunk, 'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about
(pause) What was my mother like back in the Sixties
'm dying to know
(sentimental) She was very groovy
She was so in love with your Dad
If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me
But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed
Austin hears
He looks over and sees Vanessa asleep
distinctive   and a Austin opens one of his funky suitcases to reveal a It's Basil Exposition, on an airplane
(on the picture phone) Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence
Thank you for confirming the link between Dr
Evil and Virtucon
Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan
'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately
Right away, Exposition
Where is Vanessa, by the way
Austin looks over at Vanessa's sleeping figure
She's working on another lead right now
Then you'll have to go it alone
Good luck
Thank you, Basil
Oh, and Austin&emdash; (knowing) Yes
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation
Oh, yes
Thank you
There's one more thing, Austin
Yes
Be careful
Thank you
Austin looks at Alotta's Virtucon business card
' Austin is in a dark penthouse suite
Austin passes a piece of art that is very suggestive of the female anatomy
Paging Dr
Freud
He goes over to a credenza where there is a briefcase
He opens it
- Austin's photographing the dossier with his miniature camera/pendant
(photographing) Give it to me baby
Super
We now see that the document outlines all of Virtucon's holdings in a flow-chart fashion
Pout for me, luv
Smashing
Yes
Yes
Yes
No
No
One side of the chart is labeled "Secret Projects
"  Under that we see "Human Organ Trafficking", "Carrot Top Movie", and in -&emdash; "Project Vulcan
" We see schematics for some sort of subterranean probe and a cross-section of the earth labeled "Crust, Mantel, Core
" And 'm spent
The front door opens
It's Alotta
You seem surprised to see me
thought you'd quit while you were ahead
What, and watch all my earnings go
(smug) Down the toilet
What do you want, Mr
Cunningham, was it
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina
May call you Alotta
(pause) Please
You may
Your boss, Number Two,  understand that cat's involved in big underground drills
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes
How did you know
(smug) didn't, baby, you just told me
It's for the mining industry, Mr
Cunningham
We can talk about business later
But first, let me slip into something more comfortable
Behave
:  "The Look of Love" by     66 Alotta goes behind a Japanese screen
In silhouette she takes off her clothes and puts on a robe
She opens a pair of sliding doors to reveal an elaborate Japanese bath grotto
She slips off her robe, revealing a
on her shoulder, and enters the water
Come in
'd rather talk about Number Two
Don't you like girls, Mr
Cunningham
Come in, and 'll show you everything you need to know
Austin takes off his clothes
He is extremely hairy
He goes in
Alotta produces a soapy sponge and swims over
May  wash you
Groovy
She washes his back
Behind his back, she pulls out his wallet and looks through it
It reads " ,
" :  ,  ,
trousers
In Japan, men come first and women come second
Or sometimes not at all
Care for some saki
Sak-i it to me
Alotta pours them saki
Alotta unscrews the diamond in her ring
sign on the inside of her ring reads "Relaxation Pills
"  She drops two  into his drink
Austin takes a sip
His eyes glaze over
He's instantly woozy
How do you feel, Mr
Cunningham
Mmmm
feel extreme relaxation
big  comes to the surface, right in front of Austin
(reciting poem) 'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food
It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below
' That's very clever
Do you know any other poems
(reciting in a lofty tone) 'Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the corner fudge is made
Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll
' (genuinely moved) Thank you, that's beautiful
To your health
To my health
Kiss me
They go to kiss
She notices   , -
Do you mind if  ask you a personal question
Is it about my teeth
Yes
Damn
What exactly do you do at Virtucon
'll tell you all in due time, after we make love
But first, tell me another poem
think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem:  'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train
' Oh, you're very clever
Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man
She glides over to him
:  Psychedelic Wa-wa Pedal Funky Drummer Beat : The Party Austin and the go-go girl dance crazily
'   - Dr
Evil, Number Two, and Frau Farbissina sit at the large conference table
Austin Powers is getting too close
He must be neutralized
Any suggestions
Ya wohl&emdash;  mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor
have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers
Bring on the Fembots
:  Sexy Matt Helm-type theme   enter
They are beautiful buxom multiracial girl/robots in Sixties clothes and white go-go boots
Breathtaking, Frau
These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers
These are the latest word in android replicant technology
Lethal, efficient, brutal
And no man can resist their charms
Send in the soldiers
come in
They are immediately attracted to the
They throw down their guns and come to the girls zombie-like
When they get within range, guns  out of the Fembots' bras and begin , killing the guards
Quite impressive
Thank you, Herr Doctor
like to see girls of that caliber
By caliber,  mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character
Forget it
:  60' That would be the video feed from Kreplachistan
Dr
Evil and Number Two watch a large screen
We see stock footage of a Russian warhead
We cut into a close-up of being taken prisoner by in the front of a military vehicle
Gentlemen, Phase One is complete
The warhead is ours
Let Phase Two begin
Patch us through to the United Nations security secret meeting room
of various countries in their traditional garb around a large -style meeting table
The  are dressed in bowler hats
The  all look like
The  are dressed as Mounties
The  are dressed in ceremonial robes, etc
Gentlemen, my name is Dr
Evil
They all look up at the
In a little while, you'll find out that the Kreplachistani warhead has gone missing
Well, it's in safe hands
If you want it back, you'll have to pay me
The  representatives are confused
Number Two
(frustrated) Sorry
-
The representatives  amongst themselves
Gentlemen, silence
(to Dr
Evil) ,
&; (angry) Doctor Evil
didn't spend six years in evil medical school to be called 'mister'
Excuse me
Dr
Evil, it is the policy of the United Nations not to negotiate with terrorists
Fine, have it your way
Gentlemen, you have five days to come up with one hundred billion dollars
If you fail to do so, we'll set off the warhead and destroy the world
You can't destroy the world with a single warhead
Really
So long
The screen goes
(to evil associates) Gentlemen, in exactly five days from now, we will be one-hundred billion dollars richer
(laughing) Ha-ha-ha-ha
(slightly louder) Ha-ha-ha-ha
(laughing with him) Ha-ha-ha-ha
& (   ) ----
(louder again, and even more evil and maniacal) -------
() Ohhhh, ahhhhhh
(pause, quieter) Ohhh, hmmmm
(pause, very quiet) hmn
There is an uncomfortable pause, because clearly we should have
The evil associates look around the room, not knowing what to do with themselves
Okay
Well
think 'm going to watch some
Okay
Sure
They exit the frame awkwardly
Austin and Vanessa enter past two
There is a communications center, a makeshift armory, bunks, etc
We see Basil, dressed as the Vegas-era Elvis
Hello, Exposition
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed
Dr
Evil has high-jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars
If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world
Thank you, Exposition
Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war
What's the other
Excuse me
What's the other thing you're scared of
Carnies
What
Circus folk
(shudders) Nomads, you know
They smell like cabbage
(suffering him) Indeed
If we could get back to the business at hand
It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle
(hands him the photos) 've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan
It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system
Good God, and underground missile
We've long feared such a development
When did you find that out, Austin
Austin did some reconnaissance work at Alotta Fagina's penthouse last night
Oh
Our next move is to infiltrate Virtucon
Any ideas
Yes, Virtucon runs a tour of their facilities every hour
suggest we pose as tourists and do site-level reconnaissance
Top drawer, Kensington
Oh, Austin, want you to meet somebody
Basil waves to an extremely frail
Austin, this is my mother, Mrs
Exposition
She's in from Tunbridge Wells in Kent
Can you believe, she's ninety-two years old
Austin hauls off and  the lady in the face
My God, Austin, what have you done
That's not your mother, that's a man
Austin begins tugging on her hair
Owww
my hair
Get away from my mother
Austin, have you gone mad
The two guards come over and help Mrs
Exposition to a cot
(through pain) Who is that man
Why did he hit me
Don't worry, mother
Lie down
Austin, you have a lot of explaining to do
'm sorry, Basil,  thought she was a man
Damn it, man
You're talking about my mother
You must admit, she is rather mannish
No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick
Really, Austin
Look at her hands, baby
Those are carpenter's hands
All right, Austin,  think you should go
think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag
'm leaving
(pause) Oh, and Austin
Yes, Basil
Be careful
Thanks
Basil escorts his mother out
Austin, may  have a word with you
Of course, luv
Listen,  know 'm just being neurotic, but  can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms
Fagina
mean, don't want to sound paranoid, but 've had some bad relationships in the past, and  have some jealousy issues
You went to her penthouse
It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but  can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused
well, jealousy
'm sorry
Don't be sorry
You're right to be suspicious
shagged her
shagged her rotten
(stunned) can't believe you made love to her just like that
Did you use protection
Of course,  had my nine-millimeter automatic
No, did you use a condom
Only sailors use condoms, man
Not in the Nineties
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port
Alotta meant nothing to me
(pause) Well, it means something to me
If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man
It was just a shag, Vanessa
You're everything to me
You just don't get it, do you, Austin
Good night
Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely
- :  "What the World Needs Now" by   Austin looks at his address book
:  We see a list of names crossed out, with comments written in beside them
Beside Jimi Hendrix we see "Deceased, Drugs"; Janis Joplin, "Deceased, Alcohol"; Mama Cass, "Deceased, Ham Sandwich"; Jerry Garcia
"Deceased, Gratefully"; Jane Fonda, "Square"
Austin looks at his old pair of Sixties-era canvas sneakers
He picks up his new pair&emdash;   - He pumps them too much and they explode
Austin looks out his window at the lonely city below
We see the CDs he's just purchased, including  ' and  '
Austin goes over to the kitchenette and puts a can of unopened Campbell's Tomato Soup in the microwave and turns it on
It explodes in a shower of sparks and soup
He puts the  on a record player and drops the needle
The is awful
Austin plays
His fighter gets his head ripped off, and blood spews out
Austin is genuinely frightened by this
Austin attempts to use the Water Pik, but the head is too loose and water shoots all around the bathroom
-     - Austin drives alone and sad against the rear-projection of Las Vegas
- Austin drinks by himself while a gaggle of cavort
They look at him like he's a freak
Austin raises a bottle of  as if to say "hey, 'm down with that"
They shoot him sarcastic peace signs
Austin is pleased
- Austin sits watching the - The Last Thirty Years video on
Vanessa enters
Hello, luv
Thirty years of political and social upheaval
The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang
Yeah,  can't believe Liberace was gay
Women loved him, man
didn't see that one coming
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night
Out and about, doing odds and sods
'll tell him
By the way, 've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional
'  - We're in the middle of a group therapy session, containing six or seven  with their teenage
It is emotionally charged
lot of pained expressions and coffee in Styrofoam cups
1 (crying) love you, Dad
1 love you, Son
They hug
Everyone
We see Dr
Evil and Scott
That was great, Mr
Keon, Dave
Thank you
, group, we have two new member
Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr
Ehville
Evil, actually, Doctor Evil
Hello, Dr
Evil
Hello, Scott
(into it) Hello, everybody
So, Scott, why don't we start with you
Why are you here
Well, it's kind of weird
We don't judge here
Well,  just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago
He was partially frozen for thirty years
never knew him growing up
He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business
And how do you feel about that
don't wanna take over the family business
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when  die
Not me
What do you want to do, Scott
don't know
was thinking, maybe 'd be a vet or something, cause like animals and stuff
An evil vet
No
Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something
An evil petting zoo
(shouting) You always do that
(calm) Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil
We don't label people here, Scott
No, he's really evil
Scott
No, the boy's right
really am evil
Don't be so hard on yourself
You're here, that's what's important journey of a thousand miles begins with one step
just think, like, he hates me really think he wants to kill me
, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here
They say it, but they don't mean it
The group
Actually, the boy's quite astute am trying to kill him
My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you
The details of my life are quite inconsequential
That's not true, Doctor
Please, tell us about your childhood
Yes, of course
Go ahead, etc
Very well, where should  begin
My father was a relentlessly self- improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery
My mother was a fifteen-year-old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet
My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims, like he invented the question mark
Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy
sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament
My childhood was typical
Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons
In the spring we'd make meat helmets
If  was insolent,  was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds
Pretty standard, really
At the age of twelve  received my first scribe

My hand, dammit
Look at it

Don't try to suck up to me
It's a little late for that

Look at it, it's been rendered useless
He moves his arm around to show them, but it's virtually normal, just slightly aged

Oh forget it
As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr

The world's most powerful subterranean drill
:  Stock footage of volcanoes erupting and animated charts of magma squirting through the Earth's layers
(voice over) So powerful it can penetrate the Earth's crust, delivering a 50 kiloton nuclear warhead into the planet's hot liquid core

To his right, sits Mrs
Exposition with a hideous
Why should we pay him the money
He's only got one warhead and he's going to detonate it deep underground
(the light shifts towards dramatic as he speaks) My God, man, don't you understand
It won't just be active volcanoes, inactive ones will erupt as well
Seven-eighths of the Earth's land mass will be deluged with hot magma
Tectonic plates will shift, causing massive earthquakes
Imagine no United Kingdom
Think of it, no cricket, no tea, no freshly toasted crumpets smothered with Devonshire clotted cream, the diving mystery of Stonehenge
Imagine severing forever the continuity of Britannic majesty, the demise of this sceptered isle, this jewel, this England

In due time
But what if he escapes
Why don't you just shoot him
What are you waiting for

'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death
Why don't you just shoot him now
Here, 'll get a gun
We'll just shoot him

Done
One more peep out of you and you're grounded
Let's begin
grabs Austin and Vanessa
Dr
Evil hits a button
One whole wall slides out to reveal a tank
Mr
Powers, Vanessa, some friends of mine are joining us for dinner
They're quite delighted you'll be part of the meal
The soldier takes Austin and Vanessa to the tank and puts them in the dipping mechanism
Dr
Evil, do you really expect them to pay
No, Mr
Powers,  expect them to die
Even after they pay me the money, 'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma
(to guard) All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism
The guard do so
Austin and Vanessa begin to descend slowly towards the surface of the water
Release the sharks
(to the room) All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads

(clearing her throat nervously) Dr
Evil
Yes, what is it
You're interrupting my moment of triumph
It's about the sharks
Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List
We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape
(disappointed) Right
(to Austin) Mr
Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads
Frau clears her throat again
What is it now
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are
They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died
have one simple request&emdash; sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done
Remind me again why  pay you people
What do we have
Sea bass
Right
They're mutated sea bass
Really
Are they ill-tempered
Please allow me to demonstrate
Frau Farbissina throws a leg of lamb attached to a rope towards the tank, where the   and sea bass arch through the air
The sea bass devour the lamb
She pulls the rope back
The lamb has been eaten to the bare bone
Fine
Whatever
Mutated, ill- tempered sea bass it is
(to the room) Come, let's return to dinner
Close the tank
Aren't you going to watch them
They'll get away
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan
have a gun in my room
Give me five seconds, 'll come back and blow their brains out
No Scott
You just don't get it, do you
Dr
Evil presses a button; the wall closes back over the tank
Austin and Vanessa slowly descend towards the water
They can see the   beneath them
What's your plan
Just then, a   jumps out of the water, just missing Austin
First,  plan to soil myself
Then, plan to regroup and think about the next move
Any thoughts
Sadly, no
Hold on
always keep this on me just in case
She pulls out a container of dental floss
All right,  get it
have bad teeth
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth
It didn't matter
No, no, no
We'll use the floss to get to the ledge
Smashing idea
Give it to me
Austin takes the container and draws out four feet of dental floss and spins the container above his head like a bolo
He throws it and it wraps around a  and it catches like a grappling hook
Austin begins drawing out the floss to take up the slack
Meanwhile, the slow-dipping mechanism is edging towards the sea bass
Unfortunately, Austin is still drawing out the floss
He keeps pulling out floss
More floss still
The mechanism continues to sink
Finally, the floss line goes
Austin ties it off high on the pole of the slow-dipping mechanism
Austin holds out his hand like a surgeon&emdash; Vanessa places a tube of toothpaste in his hand
Meanwhile the guard is reaching to undo the floss
Austin places the open tube on his palm, aimed at the guard
Vanessa at the guard loudly
He turns around

Austin folds the tube across the top of the wire, grabbing both ends
Hold on, Vanessa
She grabs onto him and they slide down the floss to safety right as the dipping mechanism goes under the water
Meanwhile, the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared all over his face
He and Austin
The guard manages to get Austin pinned to the ground, Austin's head dangling over the water circle
The water boils, dangerously close to Austin's head
(shouting) Austin, watch out
Austin  the guard over
The   chew the guard's head off like a blender
Not a good time to lose one's head

That's not the way to get ahead in life
