Whimpering, starving  appear and disappear in the flickering light of the wall torches
large rat nibbles some stale bread in the corner, watching the guards
Finally, the two guards reach a cell whose  is not at all whimpering or starving
huge Scotsman with a proud defiance in his eyes, a    dangling around his neck, glares through the bars
This is  McCULLEN
The guards unlock his cell door,   at the ready
McCullen stares at the muskets, unimpressed
He speaks with a thick Scottish brogue
Still using matchlocks, are ya can get you a pair of flintlocks, you let me sneak out of here
Everyone else in this sequence speaks with a French accent
#1 () Good ones
The other Guard glares at him
McCullen goes for the kill
The best
From Spain
And perhaps a couple of pretty young ladies to teach you how to use them
Guard #1 is even more tempted, but his partner is a Loyalist

The two prison guards muscle McCullen into the room and start to fasten him to a standing rack as a  begins reciting the Lord's Prayer in Latin
The Warden steps up and reads the charges off a
James McCullen, you have been found guilty of treason for the sale of military arms to the enemies of our Lord King Louis
even whilst you sold arms to our Lord himself
Your King is a vile bag of filth who murders his own allies should've charged him double
You tried to overthrow the Crown in conspiracy with its enemies
They offered me a Chancellorship, because unlike your simpleton King, they know that is the McCullen destiny, to run the wars, the true power, not simply to supply arms
Do you have anything else to say before the sentence is carried out
Yes,  do
Clan McCullen is far bigger and more powerful than any of you could ever imagine
My sons will continue to rise along after am gone
As will their sons
And, God willing, their sons
() It shall not end with my death
The Warden smiles back sinisterly
Oh, we're not going to kill you, McCullen
We're going to make an example of you

The Warden gives a nod to the prison workers who remove the from the fire
McCullen sees what it is before we do and his face fills with fear
It's a being carried towards him, the hinges open with a hideous creak
McCullen begins to struggle against the rack
(') So that no man, woman, nor child may ever see your treacherous face again, you shall wear this mask for the term of your natural life
The mask closes around his face
The workers melt the lock

Like his doomed ancestor, McCullen carries a proud defiance in his eyes
Tragic as they are to fight, wars must be won

McCullen is briefing twenty-two , many of them listening in

Perfect little soldiers
Their size can be programmed as well as their intended task
Originally developed to isolate and destroy cancer cells, but at Mars Industries, and with the help of a little funding

few laughs around the room
McCullen soaks it up
(') we discovered how to program them to eliminate most anything
For instance

:   fires a shoulder-launched missile at a tank
The warhead bursts into millions of - which eat away the metal like piranhas devouring a horse
Then the - fan out from the consumed tank and quickly head for a nearby jeep
(') Once the target has been destroyed, the launcher triggers a kill switch unique to each warhead that short- circuits the nano-mites, preventing any unwanted destruction
: The Soldier hits a   on the launcher and the - instantly "drop dead" around the nearby jeep
(') Each warhead contains seven million nano-mites and has the ability to eat anything from a single tank to an entire city
(to consummate salesman) But without innocent casualties
Which is why this has been such a priority for me and my company
The room breaks into

Guess you'll be the first arms dealer up for the Nobel Peace Prize
Laughter in the room
McCullen smiles, being a good sport

As the case is closed and locked we see the Industries     on its cover

We see the name: ",
" Still not seeing his face, we watch our soldier strap into his   and clip on his His   simply reads: ""
He loads his into the mirror (is that a look of disdain
) and we get our first glimpse of our hero, a handsome, rugged combat veteran with a under his right eye
The sound of  comes from the stall behind Duke
There is a flush and a strapping young Special Forces Soldier, , steps out
He goes to the sink next to Duke and splashes water on his face
He's pale and sweaty
The hell's wrong with you, Stalworth, you didn't eat that Chicken  La King at chow did ya
The mission, sir
What about it
Another day, another run
Never had anything to worry about before
Stalworth's shaky hand pulls a photo out and shows it to Duke:    with a  in her arms
(') Three weeks old
Be seeing him for the first time next leave
Duke looks at the picture, then at Stalworth
His eyes go distant thinking about his own past, then they harden again
6
You're off the mission
Sir
That's what you want, right
Stalworth doesn't argue
Duke hands him back the photo
(') If your head's with them, you're no good to me
Stalworth nods
Duke steps closer, now one mean s

(') One thing, though: you step off this one, you're out of Special Forces
Gonna find you a nice desk and chair back at the base
You're be run of the mill
Regular
guess  can live with that
Then you should
Stalworth nods, grabs his kit, and leaves
Duke's hard eyes watch him go, then a slight smile creases his lips
-   - McCullen exits the briefing room into the corridor outside, shaking hands with various Military Commanders
Hawk watches with his aide, a gorgeous German Lieutenant,  " "
When McCullen is alone, Hawk makes his move
Mr McCullen, Clayton Aernathy, British Army
(shaking hands) know who you are General hawk
As sharp in a briefing room as your reputation is on the battlefield
7
Not hardly
You gave me a broad target,  couldn't resist
It's an honor to meet a man of your many accomplishments
McCullen smiles, then offers Hawk to walk with him
(') What's on your mind, General
Your warheads
Securing them in transit
Forty pairs of ears in that room now know the when and where
Those "ears" all have top security clearance
We both know what that's worth
Look, General, delivery is my responsibility and it's not one take lightly
had  assign an elite American Special Forces unit, a fully armored convoy with air support
assure you, my warheads will be quite safe
've made a career of showing up where 'm needed, whether ordered to or not
And if your warheads are half as effective as you say they are
Then my unit is needed
This is no time to play catch up
The  team's been drilling for weeks
They're lit up and ready to roll
My unit doesn't need mission specific training
They're chosen because of their ability to handle any situation
8
Maybe next time, General
(moves to go, stops) What did you say your unit was called
didn't
just said they were always ready
McCullen continues on down the hall
Hawk gives Cover Girl a look, she reads it and nods
: -   -   - escorts two   as they enter a high-tech delivery bay and wlak past two "" and a huge  " , all armed with state-of-the-art rooftop weapons stand at attention in front of Duke
All right, listen up, the Cougars will be front and back, Grizzly in the middle carrying the package
Minimum distance at all times
Choppers will cover us overhead
The Lab Workers step up
#1 Captain Hauser
Duke turns to them and start signing forms as ""  takes the case while a little short on academic credentials, Rip is long on confidence, charm, and courage
These two guys are as close as brothers, for better and for worse
Rip looks at the Lab Guy with a jokey grin
Not gonna explode, is it
(dead serious) They're not weaponized yet
And the kill switches are attached to the launchers
All the same, 'd avoid potholes if  were you
Ripcord stares, then quickly hand the case off to another soldier
Duke shoots him a look and Ripcord shrugs, what
9
Why not stick it in a chopper and fly it out
If you want,  could-- --We have our orders
Okay, people
We're on the clock, let's move
Duke gives Rip another look
Rip throws him a cheesy grin
The team mounts up

And the convoy rolls out
-  - The convoy charges out of the heavily guarded factory gates, passing a sign: "   "
Two swoop in and follow the convoy
-   - Ripcord drives the lead Cougar, Duke beside him
Two more guys in back, remotely panning a rooftop
(into radio) Mother Goose, this is Bird Dog
We have the package and are on the dot to make Ganci Air Base ar 0900
You know,  hate all the Mother Goose, bird Dog crap,  just wish they'd let us say, "Hey, Pete, it's Bill, see ya in a few
" Not me,  joined up for the jargon
Roger that, Bird Dog
Mother Goose out
Just saying, you know, if  ran things
10
Rip, if you ran the Army we'd stay up all night, fill our canteen with tequila, and call each other "Bro"
But we'd be badasses, right Bro
(with a sigh) Yeah, we'd be badasses
Eyes on the road, Rip
-   - The two Blackhawks sweep through the skies, silhouetted by the rising sun
Below them, the convoy is thundering down a winding road amid the magnificent Tian Shan Mountain Range

Inside, a watches the  , clear except for two steady :signatures", the Blackhawks

-   - In the lead Cougar, Duke and Ripcord keep their eyes out
Hey Duke, ya know how they always tell you to empty your head of distracting thoughts on these runs
Keep your eyes on the road, Rip
And you know how people sometimes joke that it must be easy fr me to keep my mind empty
Don't listen to 'em
you got plenty of thoughts up there
(into radio) Keep rear security tight, boys
11
Well, the second  try and make myself not have thoughts,  always have 'em
Like now, know what 'm thinking about
Please don't say the Air Forces
The Air Forces
thought we were done with that discussion
You were done with it, not me
Look,  loev flying
Duke "mouths" the following sentence as Ropcord says it: (') 've been flying since  was thirteen years old
Ripcord shoots him a look
Duke just smiles
don't think your daddy's crop duster counts as hours logged
Jets, man, jets
You know  always qualify when 'm on leave
Yeah, yeah, look, you want to get up in the air, we'll get you a trampoline back at the base
We've done ten years in the Army, just think we should see if the grass really is greener
This continues to be the stupidest idea you've ever come up with, nd that's saying something
Funny
Real funny
12
don't wanna transfer to the Air Force, okay
It's always about you, isn't it
Give me one good reason
want to be in the fight, not flying over it
Won't be saying that when you call in an air strike and  come screaming in to save your-- --Eyes on the road, Rip

blurs our view of the aircraft, but we can tell that it's pursuing the convoy

-   - On the rear Cougar's  , we see the two Blackhawk signatures still appearing in position
but nothing else

Ripcord grimaces, then realizes-- Hey, on the training run weren't there herders around here
This puts Duke instantly on the alert
-   - Too late

They fire simultaneously
The punch into the front Blackhawk, crushing it like a beer can on your forehead
It explodes and drops

-   - Duke and Rip see the hall of flaming metal crash in front of them, blocking the convoy's path
Rip hits the brakes
Jesus Christ
Bird Down
(urgent, but utterly calm) Back up
Back up
Back up
(into radio) Mother Goose, this is Bird Dog
We are under attack
Repeat --we are under attack
-   - The second Blackhawk pivots to see the dark shape, --it's like a giant helicopter without rotors, hovering on six It's a next-gen ""
The Blackhawk hoses the Typhoon with its six-barrelled - But the rounds bounce off the Typhoon's angled armor
The   fire at the second Blackhawk, catching it on the nose, crushing it into a flaming ball and sending it reeling ass-over-tail-rotor into the ground behind the rear Cougar, hemming in the convoy
The Grizzly launches two -  off its roof- turret, but the Typhoon guns them down and fires again
The blast lands directly on top of the rear Cougar, literally flattening it as well as every tree within a hundred feet

-   - Duke sees it all in his rear view mirror, yells into : Out
Everyone get out of the vehicles
Now

-   - final   lands between the last two vehicles now
Spinning the Grizzly
It's   and a thousand lethal   shoot inside, killing the drivers
The Cougar flips end over and lands in a ditch
14
-   - Duke and Ripcord land on the upturned ceiling, beat to shit
Duke quickly checks on the two guys in back crushed to death where the blast caved in the Cougar's armor
He looks at Rip
You okay
() Yeah, except for all the blood
Duke sees blood on the back of Rip's head
Then they hear a and turn to see the Typhoon hover by the Grizzly
(') Who the hell is that
Duke grabs Ripcord and starts dragging him out

They exit the Typhoon and spread out to kill anyone left
The decimated Special Forces troops in the Grizzly with  , but the bullets can't penetrate the Viers' armor
The Vipers fire back, the impact from their pulse rifles crush the soldiers' bodies, armor and all, and fling them backwards
Two Soldiers pop two   and toss them toward the Typhoon
The Vipers shoot one grenade out of the air with their pulse rifles
It  well out of range as the other grenade lands on the ground int he middle of the pack
Another shot from a pulse rifle punches the grenade six feet underground
, lifts the ground by a foot
Meanwhile, another figure emerges out of the Typhoon
Long, slender legs in high black boots, the rest if her covered in black, form-fitting
She's beautiful, exotic, and most of all, lethal
She's known in certain circles only as " " but we will know her as
Her glint menacingly as she strides towards the Grizzly
The two Special Forces Soldiers who threw the grenades pop up to shoot her
But she quick-draws a pair of
The shots crush both soldiers

Ana flips the pistols back into her holsters as a Viper blows the back door off the Grizzly, allowing her to climb inside
She blithely steps around the corpses and removes the Duke now has Rip ver his shouders and is running like hell
Duke
Shut up
If  die
You're not gonna die
just want you to know
you never could run worth a damn
Jesus, Rip
'm just saying, it's be nice if you could move a little faster
And that's when the Cougar blows, a concussive blast
Ana turns with the weapons case in time to see Duke and Rip go ass-over-teacups down into a ditch
She touches the stem of her glasses which   on Duke
: Duke rolls over and looks at Rip
Stay here
(really messed up) Sure
'm gettin' that package
Duke leaps up and hauls-ass down the ditch, then crouch-runs up the embankment
--And comes face to face with a Viper, who raises his pulse rifle, about to blow Duke away
hand clamps down over the barrel
The Viper looks at Ana beside him
Duke also looks at her, a flash of shocking recognition ripples across his face
16
Ana touches the stem of her glasses and the   turn clear, revealing her gorgeous eyes
(') What the hell
Her face softens hesitantly
Hello, Duke
Then she round house kicks him with her boot across the face, knocks him out on his ass
(') You have to admit you had that coming
Ana struggles with something going on inside her head
Then her face reluctantly hardens and she takes her hand off the first Viper's gun barrel, giving Duke an apologetic look
(') Good-bye, Duke
Duke can't believe it
Ana suddenly glances up at something behind Duke
It's a ""  rocketing onto the scene, its four-winged   rotating ninety degrees to slow it into a hover
Duke takes the opportunity to jump to his feet and lay out in the Viper
Ana turns and hauls- ass
-  fast ropes down out of the Howler and lands behind a Viper and  his neck
Moving in a blur, he draws and buries a   into another Viper
Then he glances at the last Viper who's lining up on him, too far away to reach with his sword
He quick-draws a
Right between the eye slit in his helmet
All this in the space of six breathless seconds
Duke glances at the almost mystical figure of - sheathing his sword on his back while holstering his smoking Glock
on his tri-cep
Bad-ass defined
Snake-Eyes leaps behind the Cougar wreck as a pulse burst just missed him
Duke immediately takes off after Ana, his eyes locked on the weapons case in her hands, crackling past his head
He curses under his breath: Air Force
right

Viper lines up on Duke, but a laser-like   rips through his eye-slit and  him, courtesy of "" ' who fast-ropes down from the Howler, holding a gas-propulsion
She lines up on another Viper, but he's too quick, ducks behind the
But Scarlett's   viewfinder snapped an image of his
She darts behind the   with Snake- Eyes, swiftly targeting the Viper's eye-slit on her pistol's Then she fires behind her, in the complete other direction to the Viper, the arrow bolt flies away, then turns around and zeroes in on the Viper, finding him behind cover, the smart-arrow slams right through his eye-slit
Another Viper sees this and bolts toward the Typhoon, but " "  leans out of the landing Howler holding a dual  /
Only a man this big can carry such a weapon
Time to lay down some bass
He fires a grenade and the Viper flies back
You blink, you miss it
The Typhoon fires at Heavy Duty, but the Howler is just as nimble, fires its - which roll it onto its side
The whip past and decimate the forest behind it
Hanging awkwardly, Heavy Duty fires a double blast of hand grenades
The Typhoon's mini-gun quickly shoots them out of the air
The Howler fires  which hit the and rip them apart
The Typhoon
Ana races for the recovering Typhoon
Duke races after her through a hail of pulse-fire and draws his
Ana
She whirls around, drawing the weapons case over her chest and face, using it as a shield
Duke hesitates, because of the warheads or Ana
Heavy Duty goes to shoot at her
The warheads
Heavy Duty reluctantly doesn't shoot, everyone watching Ana backpedal towards the waiting Typhoon
Duke charges like a bull and tackles her
Ana sprawls and the case tumbles free
Duke and Ana go eye-to-eye for a split second, then Duke goes after the case while the Joes take the opportunity to spray gunfire her way
Ana zigs, zags, and dives into the Typhoon, which is raked by the bullets
18
Duke grabs up the case as the Typhoon launches into the sky and disappears over a rise
Scarlett, Snake-eyes and Heavy Duty now approach Duke, who whirls around at them, pistol up, eyes wild
Stand down
Stand the hell down
Lower your weapon, Sir
We're not the enemy
Pointing weapons at me doesn't make you my friend
""  jumps out of the Howler wearing a computerized  , a French/Tunisian : Please hand over the case, sir
don't know who you are, and sure as hell don't know who they are, and until  find out, 'm not lowering anything or handling anything over
-
They turn to see Ripcord shouldering a rifle
What's your unit
That's classified
Snake-Eyes discreetly grabs    from his belt, but a look from Scarlett makes him out them back
Someone would like a word with you
Breaker sets a holo-projector on the ground in front of Duke, which projects a 3D
Duke is stunned
State you name and rank
you first
19
My team just saved your life
now's the part where you say "thank you"
Those aren't the words that come to mind just now
We weren't told about any support for this mission, so you better tell your team to stand down
Ripcord eyes his sight
Happy to turn this into a turkey shoot
Someone - hands Hawk a file, he looks at it
You must be
Ripcord, expert marksman, weapons specialist, jet -- (to Duke) Told ya
'm General Clayton Abernathy
You may have heard of me,
Duke
glint of recognition flickers across Duke's eyes, he nods
General hawk
Afghanistan, Forward Command
Breaker sees his chance and gingerly steps up to Duke and starts sweeping a scanner across the case
Hawk smiles
That was my last job
(a twinkle in his eye) 'm in a whole new outfit now
Duke swivels his gun to Breaker's head
Breaker flinches
Just need to deactivate its tracking beacon, for security
20
Hand over the weapons case son, and let us deliver the warheads
No way
signed for 'em
My mission, my package
carry them, deliver them
Breaker's scanner
He keys a button
The promptly stops
He throws a look at Duke
Wasn't hard, was it
Fine
But you seem to be a little short on transportation a the moment
Team Alpha will deliver you to me
(') And where exactly are you, General
-   - Hawk stands in front of a - amongst a sea of computers, Cover Girl behind him, Duke on a monitor
Come see for yourself
-   - The Howler skims over the    , a caravan of camels below
The aircraft continues out into the golden desert, too fast for anybody to get a good look at it
- - Scarlett is cleaning Ripcord's head wound
Hey, you're cute
He's going into shock
What's your name, darlin'
21
Snake-Eyes stabs Ripcord hard int he arm with a drip-needle, Rip angrily eyeballs him and stifles a scream
thought all the Special Ops guys were tough
We are tough
but also sensitive
(feeling the drugs) Whoa, that's some mucho primo stuff you gave me
Rip is high now, his eyes float up to Heavy Duty who stares back at him
Rip reaches out to touch his well-cropped hair
(') and a kung-fu grip
The name's Heavy Duty
Duke has the weapons case on his lap
What kind of outfit is this
Not regular Army based on the accents
(to Scarlett) have you as an Aussie
(looks to Heavy Duty) And you're a Johannesburger
(then Breaker) And you: French North Africa
Algiers
Tunisia
Where were you born
Are you kidding me
Duke wasn't born, he was Government-Issued
But somehow you're all in the same unit
One you can't tell me the name of right
We'd get tossed for telling
22
Duke, Duke, don't you get it: they're super secret, they're Mission Impossible
This tape's gonna self-destruct in five-- --You're gonna go after them aren't you
The ones that hit my convoy
() Then whoever you are, whatever this unit is,  want in
Not our call
Ripcord sits up, really woozy, looks at Scarlett
want in too
That way we can spend some bunker time together
suddenly slices across Rip's face, an inch away
It's Snake-Eyes, checking his blade, seemingly innocent
But the message is not lost on Ripcord
Scarlett looks at Duke
You two a team or something
We've been together forever
(off her look) But not like that
Hi, 'm Ripcord
Why do they call you that
Breaker laughs, reading Ripcord's file: Because his name is Wallace Weems
-   - Eight   sit around an island console in a small, windowless room
Working their keyboards and watching the   of the Howler soaring across the dunes
technician hits a   on his console

The Howler's  twist vertical and it drops like a helicopter into the hole
: Global Integrated Joint Operating Entity
-   - The Howler descends beneath the surface onto a dark platform as the roof spirals shut and   switch on
The door of the howler opens and the team steps out
Duke and Ripcord follow hesitantly with the weapons case
calls out to them from the shadows: (
) Welcome to the new Pit
Duke and Ripcord turn to see hawk and Cover girl walking out from behind the lights
(') Duke
General
've read a lot about you two
Okay, look,  didn't "steal" that Blackhawk,  was borrowing it
Duke shoots him a look
Hawk steps right up to Duke
Matter of fact,  saw that one of my subordinates tried to recruit you to our little operation a while back
was never asked to join any Op group
Remember a tall gentleman approaching you in Thailand when you were on leave, four years ago
24
Vaguely
Right before you tore up the bar
Four years
My man had some issues
Duke shoots him another look, then turns back to Hawk
This doesn't look like any Tac Op 've ever seen
Where are we
Okay, you trusted me by going with my team, so 'll trust you
There's a loud   and part of the  begins to descend
They pass the    where  and are training with next-gen urban warfare equipment
(') Technically,   doesn't exist
But if it did, it'd be comprised of the top men and women from the best military units all over the world
The alpha dogs
They see a pretty woman sip into a next-gen -, which reflects and refracts light, making her nearly invisible
Oh man,  want one of those
The suit or the girl
Both
Scarlett's eyes roll
They descend into the level, where soldiers train with desert warfare equipment
Ten nations signed on in their first year
Working together, sharing intel
Now we have twenty- three
25
've never seen combat gear this sleek, what's the trick
Liquid armor
They reach the     where dozens of men and women are testing fantastic next-gen
(
) Good news is we've been pretty successful so far
The bad news is whenever we manage to shut down one organization, another springs up in its place
Who could possibly fund all this
Oprah
-   - Hawk now leads the group into the Control Room where more man consoles
Duke still has the weapons case
#1 Mr
McCullen's standing by, Sir
Patch him through, please
So who hit us out there
Currently unidentified
And how'd that bitch in leather get a jump jet like ours
Whoever she is, she's clearly well- financed, with access to highly classified intel and state of the art weaponry
Their capabilities are beyond anything we've ever encountered
26
That's the reason we got our asses kicked
Duke betrays nothing
Hawk looks at him
We're going to need to find out everything we can about her
Knowing is half the battle
What's the other half
McCullen now appears next to Ripcord and walks through him
(') Jesus
And we realize McCullen is here courtesy of a -
ring of cameras provides him with images of the Joes
Gentlemen, this is James McCullen, of  Industries, the man who built these warheads
McCullen standing in front of a - in a small room somewhere
of hawk, Duke, and the others around him
General, most men 've encountered in this business over-promise and under-deliver
You're the opposite
Clearly, you were the security option  should have chosen
: Steaming behind his military demeanor
My team did everything we could out there
lot of good men went down-- --But not you
That mission was classified, sir
Clearly, somebody sold us out
27
've spent ten years and thirteen billion Euros creating these four warheads
Your job, Captain, was to protect them, and if it wasn't for General Hawk, you would've failed
That's not a fair assessment
He followed his orders to the letter
Well that wasn't enough
Duke bristles
McCullen turns to Hawk
(') What are your coordinates
'll have  send another special ops team to retrieve the warheads, company strength this time
Apologizes, Mr McCullen
It's not that  don't trust you
don't trust anybody
() Are you sure you're not a McCullen
don't talk smooth enough to be a McCullen
You do just fine, General
Now, so the bastards who attacked you can't find you, you need to disable the tracking beacon hidden in the case
We already have
Good man
So, can  count on you to deliver the warheads to  now
think it unwise to expose them at the moment
This group might make another attempt
() 28
(') We need to find and neutralize them before we can consider moving your weapons
Alright
But allow me to check the warheads to see if any have been damaged
Duke begrudgingly sets the case down
Breaker turns on his suit's -
It goes into -  and we see the - crawling around inside the four warheads
(') Open it, please
My scan says they're intact
General
What's the code
, listening carefully
Five-two-nine-four-four-oh
Breaker enters the code
As the case opens, Breaker discreetly watches McCullen in his -
McCullen runs his holographic fingers over the warheads
Satisfied, he turns to Hawk
(') Please keep me informed of your progress, General
Duke and McCullen share a quick glare
And then McCullen cuts the feed
Scarlett notices concern on Breaker's face
Breaker
That bloke's Beta waves were going up, down, and sideways
think he's hiding something
And off the faces of the rest of the group    : 29

This was supposed to be the easy part
If you'd let me stage the assault at your precious factory, we could have contained the situation
And lost the trust of our clients in the process
It had to be 's fault

Did you hesitate
You're implying this was about some ancient history
That's as laughable as your Intel
What went wrong was the Joes appearing out of nowhere
He stares at her suspiciously, then softens
Forgive me, jealousy isn't my strong suit
Forget that, where are we now

McCullen whispers menacingly

Business first
Besides, 'm married, remember
Her holo-form blinks off, leaving McCullen alone in the room

McCullen turns to see  , a well-tailored Korean man whose soul has long since departed, standing on the other side of the room
There can't be any more mistakes
The schedule can't be compromised any further
If you had sent me, it would be done

Storm Shadow nods, McCullen continues on  him

The Doctor keys a demand and that particular Neo-Viper steps up and sticks his bare arm into the case through a portal
They feel no fear
The Neo-Viper grabs the cobra and squeezes, the cobra bites his arm, latching on, sinking its venom into his veins
The Neo-Viper doesn't even wince
(') Cortical nerve clusters revealed complete inactivity-- --Doctor
They feel no pain
The Doctor keys another command and the Neo-Viper obediently lets go of the cobra and removes his arm from the case

The Doctor looks at impressed McCullen
(') So you tell me: is it working
-   - The Doctor follows McCullen through various corridors
The science is staggering isn't it
You've done well
You've thrown the caber clear out of the yard
But research and science are expensive propositions
If  can make a suggestion
McCullen stops and looks at him, there is something truly menacing and evil behind this Doctor's mask
(') Selling one batch of warheads on the black market could fund-- -- appreciate your thirst for knowledge, Doctor
But this world is messy enough
Factions fighting and scrabbling for control, for resources, and it's only going to get worse as the century progresses

McCullen strides off
The Doctor stares after him
-   - Duke, still holding the briefcase, stares at a from the ambush, now up on a monitor
We grabbed an image from Heavy- Duty's helmet cam
Ripcord looks stunned, he leans closer to Duke and whispers: Hey, that's-- Duke cuts him off with a look
Breaker extracts a full 3D - of Ana's face from the photo
Then on an adjacent monitor, he runs an endless series of

We'll find her
Duke just stares at Ana's photo
Ripcord whispers quietly: You okay

For once, Ripcord doesn't know what to say
Cover Girl walks in and hands a document to Hawk, who looks through it
From

Your mission is complete
Once you hand it over, that is
Duke nods, hands over the case with a hint of defeat
When you move it, she's gonna come after you, you know that, right
(off Hawk's look) And with her Intel, and her toys
she'll find you
And your point is
You're going to go after her first
And  want to help
Let us in on this, General
Our team just got wasted

You don't ask to be a part of You get asked
You scouted me four years ago, now 'm ready
Let's have at it

've lost men too, Captain
Good men
But attempting to-- know her
Excuse me
You said knowing is half the battle
Well,  know who she is
Duke reaches into his pocket, pulls out a photo and shows Hawk
: Ana, four years earlier, much softer looking, staring lovingly at Duke as they're about to kiss
(') Her name is Ana Lewis, and  can tell you everything you need to know about her until
four years ago
After that, well, obviously sa lot's changed
Hawk just stares in disbelief
'  - Hawk sits down behind his desk and looks up at Duke, still standing at attention
Before this goes any further, need to know what 'm dealing with, a man looking to settle a score, or a man who can put the mission first
Because the battlefield is the wrong place for emotion
(he pauses for effect) Could you kill her
If  had to
Chances are you will
But if you flinch, hesitate even an instant
what 'm trying to say is, unless you can kill her graveyard dead don't want you

Of course

You were gone a long time

She spots Storm Shadow standing in an ante room and quickly spins to face her husband
She pulls Decobray close and kisses him
Storm Shadow makes a move, but ana warns him off with her eyes, She finishes the kiss and looks at Decobray
Let me change and freshen up and 'll meet you for dinner
Of course
Decobray smiles at her and leaves
The smile falls from Ana's face as she spins around and heads for Storm Shadow

Mr
McCullen gave me explicit orders to sever the Baron's spine if he so much as touched you
He's my husband, of course he touches me
Tell McCullen to grow up
Besides, the Baron says his work in the lab goes much better after we've
touched
And that's the important thing

Slightly younger and with none of the cold viciousness she displayed earlier
She's dancing with Duke who's wearing his officer's  , replete with bars and medals

Duke
it's beautiful
It's too nice you lunatic
Only time 'm buying one of these, so why not
They stare a each other, a touching beat
Then Duke screws up his face, worried
(') Well, what do you say
She's too emotional to speak

He threads the ring onto her trembling finger
Rex smiles, but in his eyes is a glint of instability
Ripcord comes   through shuttered doors and sprawls out next to them, arms and legs akimbo

Ripcord rolls over and yells back through the doors: How was  supposed know she was married

Hey, are you proposing

Don't tell me, Snake-Eyes
No, me
Ripcord glances at Scarlett's
You can do this whole course with that thing in forty-five seconds
If you're going to shoot at something, kill it
Otherwise take up knitting
When  want something,  don't just shoot at it
(steps close to her) When  get a target in my sights, take it down
His meaning is clear
She holds his gaze, slaps a magazine into her   and hands it to him
Here
Go on
Try it
wouldn't want to show you up
Oh, that's so thoughtful of you
What can  tell you
guess 'm just a considerate, humble guy
You'll learn that about me

You've got ten rounds to "take me down"

They're training arrows
The most 'll feel is a little jolt

Scarlett walks back and faces him
He glances aside at Duke who is loving this
Ripcord readies the pistol
Scarlett darts left
He shoots and misses
She darts right
He misses
'mon, Rip
Ripcord tries harder, genuinely doing his best
But Scarlett us too fast
Ducking and weaving around Ripcord, as nimble as a cat
Five more shots miss her
And now Ripcord's feeling the pressure
He waits for her to move
Fires
She leaps up onto a corner wall and the bolt passes underneath
He fires again as she lands, ducks under it and rolls up to him
He fires his last bolt point blank
She catches it in her left hand by the stem as it leaves the chamber
Slamming her body up against his
Right hand behind his head, left hand holding the bolt

Lips closer

Ripcord and Duke jump back
Ripcord glances at the underside of the pistol's magazine
Three words: ":  "

The Joes grimace, feeling Duke's pain
Snake-Eyes turns away, done with him
Duke pops back up again
Again
They go at each other, fast and furious, the electrified pugil sticks crackling and sparking
Duke spins and attempts a stroke similar to Snake-Eyes' earlier move
Snake-Eyes blocks it, drops, and sweeps Duke's feet, taking him down hard before finishing him with another
Again, the Joes react
Snake-Eyes turns away
Duke shakes it off and pops to his feet once more
(') Again

Snake-Eyes nods, a little more respect in his eyes now
This time after the high blows are parried, Snake-Eyes tries the sweep
Duke jumps it, rolls, comes up behind Snake-Eyes and Snake-Eyes barely blocks it
They trade half a dozen blows, the electricity popping and crackling before Snake-Eyes tries a finishing blow
Duke stuffs it with his stick and tackles Snake-Eyes
They fall to the ground, both receiving
They go eye-to-eye
It wasn't pretty, but Duke is getting effective
Snake-Eyes pops to his feet
This time he offers a hand to pull Duke up
Across the room, Hawk watches with approval

They're between the clay wall and the of the Pit's generator station
The foundation of this fence is a hundred feet deep
No going under
Ten Neo-Viper mole pods start to burst out the wall
And then there's a crashing sound as one of the wall girders bends, obviously a mole machine in the clay behind it hit it
Ana can hear the engine grind to a halt
(') If we don't get him out he'll suffocate
Storm Shadow gives her a look: Like  care
(') Just thought 'd mention it
All that matters is the mission
Ana pulls out a hi-tech   which shoots out six in a 360  , creating a of the Pit, showing rooms and people moving about them
She points down a tunnel beyond the electrified fence
Storm Shadow gestures to one of the Neo-Vipers
The Man immediately walks over and grabs the fence, electricity him violently, but the man ignores it and shakily starts climbing the fence
The skin on his hands and arms starts to burn and bubble
48
(') Acceptable collateral damage
(trying to out-tough him) Is there any other
Near the top the Man finally falls backward and drops down dead
Storm Shadow nods to the next Viper
Without hesitation the Man walks over and grabs the fence
He is immediately , but keeps climbing, burning and bubbling
This guy makes it to the top, throws himself over, and crashes to the ground, then crawls over and pulls the , cutting the electricity before dropping dead himself
Ana, Storm Shadow and the others quickly scale the fence

Rip whispers to Duke, nodding towards Scarlett
Heavy told me she graduated college at twelve
No response from Duke, who is trying to get comfortable
(') She's like a freaky genius deadly, freaky genius
You like her,  get it already
(making a chess move) You can't learn this stuff in a book, Scarlett
You have to at least kiss a guy, before you're an expert on romance
The guys all laugh
Scarlett blushes, then raises her bow
Who am  shooting first
The laughter stops
Rip looks surprised
You haven't kissed anyone
Now Scarlett looks really furious
Rip instantly wishes he could take his words back
Duke just shakes his head

Breaker nods to Ripcord, stopping near Scarlett's chair
Ripcord sees Snake-Eyes taking in his every move
Scarlett now has her nose in a book

He peers closer and    , on which, though in English, is a damn near
Beach reading, huh
She groans and lowers the book only slightly
(') Hi,  guess we kinda got off on the wrong foot
Without changing expression she goes back to her book
(') Okay look, 'm attracted to you
And you, you're attracted to me
And him-- (nods towards Snake-Eyes) The Zen Master, he creeps me out, but what 'm saying is-- "We're attracted to one another
" 51
Thank you
That's what you're saying, not what 'm saying
Okay, what are you saying
Attraction is an emotion
Emotions are not based in science
And if you can't quantify or prove that something exists, well, in my mind
it doesn't
Okay, 'll get back to you on that

Hawk steps in
Everyone comes to attention

Stop, Ana

will if  have to
Deep down, you're still the same man  fell in love with

She takes another step
Duke levels his pistol right at her forehead
Storm Shadow flinches
Duke gives him a glance
Move and 'll blow her away

Ana takes another step forward, daring Duke to pull the trigger
Ripcord, gun drawn and fixed on Storm Shadow, moves slowly forward to retrieve the briefcase
Ana is now an inch from the extended barrel
Ana and Duke are close enough to feel each other's breath
Their eyes lock
Do it, Duke
You already killed me once
And in Duke's eyes we see him falter, just a bit
Ripcord passes Ana, and wit hone lightning quick hand she slaps at Duke's pistol
Storm Shadow lunges at ripcord,  his pistol in half with one sword and about to kill him with the other
When suddenly, Snake-Eyes lunges
Snake- Eyes'   saves Ripcord's life by a half inch
The rest of the Neo-Vipers arrive and immediately open fire, pinning both Duke and Ripcord down
All hell breaks loose
Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow lunge at one another, swords flashing at impossible speeds, then they lock swords

Ana fights the invisible Scarlett as best she can, but Scarlett lands several unseen blows on her
Ripcord and Duke take out a pair of Neo-Vipers
Storm Shadow climbs back into the Arclight
Looking at ana as she falls near a vehicle on the blocks
Ana grabs an   and flings the oil, which sprays over everything, including Scarlett, making her visible
Ana leaps on Scarlett, knocks her to the ground and angrily begins to choke the life out of her
Storm Shadow ignites the Arclight which jumps into the air, powered by an arc of blue light shooting out of its engine pack
He quickly swoops towards the two women and grabs ana by her arm, pulling her along
Ana grabs the weapons case and they soar up out of the motor pool and over the landing pad
The battle raging below them
Ripcord and Duke fire after them, but they vanish up into the next level
Heavy Duty, now back in action, takes out the last of the Neo-Vipers

#1 Four, Mr
President
Any threats
Any demands
#1 None so far, sir
#2 We take this to mean the terrorists are unfocused, no clear goals
The President stops, glancing gravely back at his staff
No,
it means they're going to use them

(') As  have never forgotten what the French did to Clan McCullen
- In the shadowy operating chamber, the Doctor approaches Zartan who sits on a gurney, scanning his
Dozens of warm up as the Doctor flicks on switches
Are you ready, Mr
Zartan
This is going to be the achievement of a lifetime
For you and me both
Eighteen months of studying the subject, learning the mannerisms, adopting his eating habits, losing sixty percent of my muscle mas
Your commitment has been inspiring
McCullen enters

It's a useful tool
You should understand that
Ah
The transfer just hit my account
Zartan puts the  aside, leans back on the gurney and 59
(') Let's do this
The Doctor straps Zartan down, then starts the which converge on Zartan, injecting his body with dozens of long needles
He remains conscious, not feeling any pain
into a   which  an  behind his right ear
The needle feeds thousands of tiny - into Zartan's head
Zartan's eyes bulge, he starts to and fight his restraints as the nano-mites begin to reshape his appearance, reforming facial bones and changing the texture and elasticity of his skin and even changing the color of his eyes
The Doctor grins proudly
McCullen looks disturbed
-   - Joes are busy cleaning up the mess
Snake-Eyes sits by himself, hasn't moved in several hours
thousand yard stare in his eyes
: - , cold from the rain and desperately hungry, scavenges for food in a garbage can, he looks up and notices a warm light coming from the other side of a wall and gate
: Young Snake Eyes sneaks in through the Kitchen window and goes to a rice pot on the counter
As he takes a first bite, another young boy enters, we see the on his forearm, it's a young Storm Shadow, healthy, wealthy, and well fed
Thief
He picks up the   and tries to cut Young Snake- Eyes, who blocks the strike with the rice pot
They fight fiercely for two little kids, using all sorts of utensils and furniture
Snake-Eyes has desperate street skills, but Storm Shadow's classic training gives him the edge
He finally traps Snake-Eyes under his foot, a triumphant look on his face
He starts to choke Snake-Eyes with his foot

Storm Shadow
Ninja Master steps forward
Storm Shadow turns to him

(Japanese, subtitled) Father, he was stealing

The two young warriors glare at one another

Snake-Eyes glares up at Storm Shadow, narrowing his eyes furiously
Hard Master just smiles, AHl : Snake-Eyes in the motor pool, he stands up and walk off
- Battered and bruised, Scarlett hurriedly enters the barracks
Checks around to see that she's alone
Then she heads for a mirror over one of the sinks, peeling back her collar to check the   on her neck
Her hands are trembling
She turns on the water and cleans her face with a
Ripcord enters the barracks behind
Like Scarlett, he looks around to see if he's alone
He catches Scarlett looking at him in the mirror, as if he's unwanted
Then he notices the choke marks
He is genuinely concerned
Jesus, you okay
'm fine
You're not fine, let me look at that
61
looked at it, it's fine
Take it easy, just trying to help
know what you're trying to do
And what is that exactly
don't have time for this
You know, not every guy you meet is an asshole
You do know that, don't you
Scarlett stops and returns to the sink, he ignores her, cleaning the blood off his face
She softens
It's not you,
didn't really want anyone to
see me in here
Why not
don't know
All the people we lost last night
General Hawk
My neck is not that important
You almost died
You're allowed to be concerned
First fight 've lost since  was a kid
My father would be
he was my instructor
Think he's be disappointed
He taught me to win
don't know how you teach anybody to win at everything every time
() 62
(') But  do know you can teach someone to get up when they get knocked down
Ripcord turn her gently in the mirror
(') Look at you
Still here
Maybe this is what he wanted you to learn
Scarlett stares at her reflection briefly
(') But of course, that would be an emotional response, one that can't be explained or quantified
Ripcord turns and heads for the door
Scarlett watches him
We're not a couple
Snake-Eyes and me
We're
close, he's like a brother, but
we're not a couple
Ripcord looks back at her, nods, then walks on out
- Hawk is hooked up to a
Duke sits nearby, his shoulder being bandaged by a Medical Officer Duke's eyes, staring into oblivion, : '    : Can you kill her
And then   : Ana strangling Scarlett, a smile on her face
Squeezing harder, harder
Pure evil
(
0
) () That ought to hold you
- Duke "comes to" as the Doctor finishes and walks away
Duke takes a breath, looks to Hawk in his bed, then stands and walks over
He stares down at Hawk, then, a promise-- Graveyard dead
63
-   - Duke, Ripcord, Scarlett, Snake-Eyes, and Heavy Duty stare at some next-gen computerized ultra-sound  of a dead Neo-Viper
Snake-Eyes points in question to an area
Nano-mites
wrote my thesis on the theory behind them at Oxford
They've been surgically implanted behind the ear, all programmed to accomplish different tasks
Like what
Theoretically, the possibilities are endless
Increase their speed, agility, resilience
You program, they perform
That's the genius of nanotechnology, it can do pretty much whatever you want it to
Mind control
don't see why not
-   - Duke and Ripcord move with the others through a corridor
Their weaponry, financing, intel, it has to be McCullen
Doing an inside job on his own warheads
You may be right
Maybe he needed to pay for his
The weapons case
Everyone stops and looks at Ripcord like he's nuts
(') Remember he had us open the case for him
Remember that
64
What about it
'll bet that code he gave us like re-activated the tracking beacon or something
Looks pass among the group, it starts to make sense
And who says you're not a thinker
All of the sudden, Breaker rushes up to them, out of breath
think  found her
-   - Breaker leads the group into the control room where a DeCobray is up on screen
Duke stares at the photo, gazing at her face
Ripcord sees her and knows, too
Yeah, you found her all right
Her name is Ana DeCobray now, Baroness if you're feeling formal
Wow, she traded up, huh
(off Duke's look) mean
financially
Who is he
Baron DeCobray
Big shot French scientist
Runs a lab in Paris
Lab
Breaker call up an image of DeCobray standing in front of a huge   along with some other scientists
Particle accelerator
65
They're gonna use him to weaponize the warheads
That's where she's going
Who likes croissants
- And then a lighted aircraft in the distance approaches at Mach three
It's the Howler
- The Joes are silent, eyes ahead
Scarlett shares a smile with Ripcord, next to her, Across from them Duke watches, almost smiles, then lays back his head and closes his eyes : - a village choked by thick jungle as erupt in - and a  circles, beating hypnotically, giving the images a dreamlike quality
,  - Duke, Ripcord, Rex, and the rest of an insertion team, sit with their backs against the chopper walls
Per the briefing, we fast rope in, form up and assault the main lab
(a glance at Rex) Rex--uh,
the science officer, stays back with Fireteam Alpha until Bravo enters and secures the building
Alpha holds the perimeter while science officer secures the WMDs
Five minutes before extraction and the airstrike
The squad nods
Duke looks to Rex again
Rex is sweating, trying not to show it
Duke hands him a piece of gum
66
(') Double Bubble
Rex takes it
Duke blows a bubble, smiles at Rex
(') Always helps me
You good
(weak smile back) Yeah
They chew their gum
-  - : Duke leads a frontal assault of the main building
They take fire from some , but put them down
Other  flee
The way to the door is cleared
Duke gives hand signals along with his commands
Go, Bravo
Bravo, a - fire team hit the door of the building
They disappear inside
Rex, a kit bag over his shoulder and a
45 Colt  on his hip, waits in a crouch, Duke next to him puts a hand on his shoulder
Duke scans the treeline for any treats
One of Bravo Team appears in the doorway and signals " " Duke double taps Rex on the shoulder
(') You're good to go, Rex
You don't find it in four minutes, get out of there, because that house won't be standing in five
already called for the air strike
Rex nods
Duke gives him a smile
Rex takes off and runs low to the door, entering the house
Duke watches him go, then looks back to the jungle and hears the  of mortars
Duke takes one more look, Rex disappears safely inside, then the mortar rounds start to hit
The ground is torn apart, dirt flying in the air, as Duke, Rip and the rest of the squad takes cover
We catch glimpses of the enemy, lots of them, in the jungle, firing
Duke and Ripcord pop up and return fire
67
've gotta level with ya
hate it when you level with me
Gonna be a long five minutes
Duke just grits his teeth and keeps firing
Then, in the distance,  coming from the sonic roar of
(') love that sound
But then he looks to Duke, confusion on his face
No, no, no
It's too soon
: The -16s in formation streaking toward them across the sky
Duke looks back at the main building
(') Rex
Duke runs for the building
Tracer fire and mortar explosions all around him
Then the whistle of a bunker buster
Duke dives and
The building is flattened by the bomb
Duke is tossed through the air like a rag doll
Lands hard, barely registers the pain, staggers up, bloody and ripped, stumbles toward the smoking
Flaming rubble that was the building
The Blackhawk comes sweeping low, ready for extraction, the tracer fire and explosions intensify
Black smoke washes over Duke
Ripcord finds him in the debris
Blackhawk's waiting
Come on, we've got wounded
And incoming enemy
Lots of 'em
can't
Nothing you can do
Come on
Gunfire bursts around them as Ripcord pulls Duke away from the ruins of the house
68
- Duke's haunted, soot-streaked face as his eyes take on a thousand-yard stare
: - Duke is wide awake, his eyes have on a thousand-yard stare
-  - Paris by day, the Eiffel Tower in all her glory
-  - Ana's    pulls up to a   outside a large building which is surrounded by an steps out of the shed and taps on the driver's window
The Neo-Viper behind the wheel lowers the , revealing Ana and Storm Shadow in the back
The guard smiles at Ana
They speak in French, subtitled
Good Morning
Baroness
Good morning
Gene
My husband's expecting me
Absolument
The Security Guard opens the   and the Scarab drives up to the building
-  - Two   look up from their desks as Ana and Storm Shadow stride through the  with two Neo-Vipers
Storm Shadow throws something
Both guards fall dead in their heads
The Neo-Vipers steal behind the desk, throw a switch, open a   for Ana and Storm Shadow
-  - Ana and Storm Shadow enter a colossal chamber which is all but consumed by the
69
swarm all over it, taking readings and making adjustments, under the eyes of DeCobray who sits at a control station surrounded by monitors
Ana gives the weapons case to Storm Shadow who hangs back as she walks up to her husband
Ana
need you to do something for me and  don't have much time
(sees Storm Shadow) Who is this
She beckons Storm Shadow who sets the weapons case down on DeCobray's desk, opening it up to reveal the four and their launchers
DeCobray stares, bewildered
(') don't understand
what are these things
What's going on
They're warheads, dear
And  need you to weaponize them for me
(looking around) or we'll kill everyone in here
DeCobray stares at her, shocked
He looks at Storm Shadow who removes a   from his belt and shoots a
Chaos erupts
DeCobray shouts to the room, calming the others somewhat
He stares at Ana and Storm Shadow, terrified
This is a civilian laboratory
We don't have the correct programming protocols for weaponizing
The protocols are in the case
(he hesitates) told you,  don't have much time
DeCobray reluctantly takes the weapons case
-   - charges through the streets
On the outside it looks like your Uncle's
, but inside it's all next-gen
70
-  - Heavy Duty drives the Brawler while Breaker mans a hi-tech terminal next to him
In the back, Snake-Eyes loads his guns while Scarlett, Duke, and Ripcord put on
Heavy  and Breaker will stay in the Brawler, watch our back
The rest of us will break into the lab with the accelerator suits
Once the warheads are weaponized, they'll be extremely volatile
We can't afford to let any of them go off inside the city
Ripcord looks at Snake-Eyes
What about you
Don't you get a suit
Snake-Eyes just looks at him, "Are you kidding me
" He doesn't need one
-  - echoes through the chamber as the particle accelerator come to life,  evenly
Storm Shadow backs up a little
Ana glances at him
He shrugs, what
Technicians quickly finish up and back away from the accelerator
Firing
DeCobray hits a switch
The   charges and begins hurling atoms through miles and miles of underground tunnels
Inside the accelerator, the four warheads begin to spin in a    -- then, as the power grows, they begin to rise, each one hovering as they spin
Ana and Storm Shadow watch with mild curiosity as the noise inside the chamber builds
The atoms catapulting faster and faster through the tunnels, bombarding the warheads again and again
Until finally, a   rings out
And the warheads slowly sink back down and stop spinning
DeCobray keys another button and the emerges from the accelerator
71
Technicians open the chamber and very carefully remove the warheads, returning them to their case
Storm Shadow locks the case and picks it up
(') Careful
they're alive
Thank you, Leon
think  have never seen the face of evil until  looked at you now
Ana looks at him and falters, something in his words piercing her hard veneer
She feels Storm Shadow watching her and with a flick of her eyes, the walls go up again
She drop a on DeCobray's desk and heads for the door
Adieu
DeCobray watches her go, then opens the envelope
We see the printed on the first page: "  "
/
-  - The Brawler races up towards the lab, they see it out their forward windows
There it is
/
- Ana and Storm Shadow emerge from the lab and climb into the back of the Scarab as the two Neo-Vipers climb in the front
- DeCobray stumbles out to the foyer, finds the two Security Guards dead, and quickly picks up a phone
- The Security Guard in the guard shed puts down his phone and glances at the oncoming Scarab just as a Neo-Viper leans out with his   and blasts the whole shed to pieces
The Scarab crashes right out the gate
72
/
/ - At the same time, the Brawler reaches the laboratory and there's a split second where both sides see each other in their windows
Duke and Ana lock eyes
Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow do the same
That's them
Snake-Eyes is already moving, lunging out a   onto the street as the Brawler still moves, running right at the Scarab which turns to get away
Scarlett immediately follows him out, landing in a roll with her accelerator suit
Ana leans out of her window and fires her   at the Brawler, keeping Duke and Rip inside
Then she fires at Snake-Eyes and Scarlett
Snake-Eyes dives, but the blasts nail Scarlett
She crashes hard
Snake-Eyes glances at her
Keep going
With that, he leaps after the Scarab, just grabbing the back of the vehicle as it tears away
The Brawler stops right next to Scarlett, out of breath, her accelerator suit (') (to Duke and Ripcord) Don't worry about me, go and help Snake-Eyes
Duke doesn't need to be told twice
He leaps out and runs after the Scarab
Rips starts to follow, Breaker grabs him
Careful
They're worth millions of dollars
each
Millions of dollars, got it
He promptly trips and crashes to the pavement
Picks himself up
Gets hit by a car
Picks himself up again
(') (to Driver) Sorry
Excusem moil (to a stunned Breaker) Won't happen again
73
Then Rip hauls-ass after Duke
/
-   - An   passes casually through an intersection
All of a sudden, the Scarab bursts through it, ripping it in two and barrelling on down the busy street
Snake-Eyes is still barely clinging to the back
/
-   - Breaker watches the two halves of the bus whirl around on his as Heavy Duty drives through the city streets
Christ, they just shot right through a bus
-   - Duke and Rip charge after the Scarab
Their speedometers reading 15mph
then 30mph
then 40mph
they leap over and around speeding cars and trucks
/
-   - The Scarab smashes through any vehicle in its path, leaving a trail of destruction for Duke and Ripcord to leap over or dart around in their suits
Ana and Storm Shadow hear Snake- Eyes on the roof and drop their windows and lean out and shoot at him
But Snake-Eyes quickly clambers down the side of the vehicle, escaping their shots by disappearing beneath the undercarriage
And that's when Ana sees Duke and Rip following
She sits back down inside and keys a button on a console
slide open on the outside of the Scarab to reveal two , one on each side
They fire
The  streak back towards Duke and Ripcord
No time to get out of the way, they dive and roll in various directions, extreme kinetic energy hurling them forward
The two missiles whip between them and detonate, one on a '  and the other on a
The from the car knocks them down
The Scarab tears away around a corner
74
/
-   - They see Snake-Eyes on their monitors in the Brawler
They're turning the corner
Go through that building at 6 o'clock
-   - Duke and Ripcord see the building in front of them
There's no door
' Make one
Duke charges directly at the building
Ripcord reluctantly following as Duke smashes through the wall into
-  - crowded bar
Neither of them slow for a second
Duke bolts through
Rip grabs a , opens his visor, downs the drink, then places the empty glass on the tray of a stunned waitress
Behind her a sign reads: " "
Duke and Ripcord  through the opposite wall
-   - back out onto the city streets where they turn and level their -  at
nothing
puzzling beat
And then the Scarab thunders up behind them at full speed
Ripcord dives out of the way just in time
Duke has no such luck
He spins and catches the  , digging his feet into the road in an attempt to slow the Scarab down
But the Scarab now angles towards a busy intersection, threatening to crush  in the criss-crossing traffic
Duke throws himself onto the hood just as an   into the front grill and is chucked away like so much garbage
Duke tumbles up onto the roof
pops up
Duke dives off the back as the weapon fires
He tumbles to the pavement as Ripcord speeds up to him, firing his - at the Scarab
Duke fires with him
75
/
-   - Their rockets nail the Scarab and knock out the
But its armor saves the vehicle
: Storm Shadow and Ana are knocked around
Storm Shadow pops a hatch and grabs one of their own Hands it to Ana
Mr
McCullen would be quite unhappy if  let you die
Ana quickly and nervously starts to buckle in
How thoughtful
- On the monitors, Scarlett and Breaker watch the Scarab via Snake-Eyes speeding through the streets
Look at the moves they're making, they're heading somewhere
Breaker widens the map, plotting a route
This's their route from the lab
On the screen, they see the lab, the current position of the Scarab, and what lies just ahead
the Eiffel Tower
() Metal
Oh God
/ - Snake-Eyes is now desperately clinging to the undercarriage
Duke and Rip are catching up behind him
' Guys, you have to stop them
Yeah, we're working on it
76
' mean right now
They're going to detonate one of the warheads on the Eiffel Tower
Ripcord glances up and sees the Eiffel Tower looming up fast
Oh, man
Under the Scarab, Snake-Eyes pulls out his   and fires into the unprotected insides of the  , which promptly rip to shreds
The Neo-Viper loses control of the vehicle,  through a   onto train tracks
Snake-Eyes sees something, lets go, rolls free and crashes into garbage cans just as a   barrels into the Scarab, which  into the air, hood-over-tailpipe
Duke and Ripcord are running too fast to stop
Duke manages to leap into the air, his boots barely scraping the top of the train while Ripcord covers his face with his hands and headlong into a window on the side of the train
-  - flying across the aisle, whipping past a group of stunned morning , and smashing out through the far window
- The Scarab, Duke and Rip all   to the pavement and tumble
Sparks and flame and flying metal everywhere
Duke and Rip finally stop tumbling, a hundred yards away from the wreck of the Scarab
/
-   - Scarlett, Heavy Duty and Breaker see this on their monitors
/ Holy shit
() You guys okay
-   - Duke and Ripcord's visors lift, both looking a bit wigged
77
What happened to you
went through the train
What happened to you
jumped over it
You can do that
Yeah, you didn't know
: We see the Neo-Vipers are dead
Storm Shadow is incredibly beat and bloody, but Ana is just fine in her red Accelerator Suit
Storm Shadow grabs the weapons case and he and Ana leap out
Duke and Ripcord pick themselves up while Snake-Eyes crawls out of the   nearby
They see Storm Shadow and Ana emerge from the Scarab and hurry off towards the tower
(') 'mon
Snake-Eyes follows Duke and Ripcord, charging after them
- swarm around the south base of the tower to buy their tickets and start their tours
Storm Shadow and Ana burst through them, slamming past   as they bound onto the stairs
People scream at the sight of Ana
Duke and Ripcord arrive seconds later, rushing up in their Accelerator Suits like beings from another world
They spot Ana and Storm Shadow on the stairs and hurry after them
The Security Guards draw their pistols and start  at Duke and Ripcord
The  ping off their suits
(to Duke) How do you say "we're the good guys" in French
Meanwhile, Snake-Eyes evades all the chaos by leaping up under the south base, scaling the iron lattice like a monkey
78
: Ana and Storm Shadow crest the stairs and rudely push through the crowd to the stairway on the opposite side of the floor
Another   draws a gun on them but Storm Shadow snatches the weapon out of the man's hands, swatting him with the butt, all without missing a step
The crowd panics and runs screaming for the stairs-- --where Duke and Ripcord are struggling to catch up
The avalanche of tourists slows their progress
Underneath the stairway, however, Snake-Eyes continues to climb fast without a safety net
He makes it to the first floor and races after Ana and Storm Shadow
: The Brawler screeches up
Scarlett's first out with Breaker and Heavy Duty behind her
All of them carrying weapons
The Security Guards instantly go on the defensive as they hurry up to the stairway
Guns go up
Scarlett speaks to them urgently in French
(French, subtitled) Don't shoot
We're a special anti- terrorist unit
There's a bomb up there
are now rushing up behind them
: Ana and Storm Shadow speed over to the main tower  and barge their way inside
Storm Shadow hurls the   out as Ana opens the weapons case and removes one of the   and its
Through the stunned crowd, they see Snake-Eyes reach the top of the stairs behind
Ana rolls the warhead towards him while Storm Shadow lines up on him with the Security Guard's pistol as if to shoot him
Snake-Eyes glares defiantly at Storm Shadow who just grins and lowers his gun at the warhead
Snake-Eyes recoils
: Everyone hears the warhead detonate
: Duke and Ripcord freeze
:    - spreads out in all directions
Storm Shadow closes the   and hits a button for the top
The elevator races upwards as everything else gets eaten by the ravenous -
The floor begins to disappear
Tourists stampede towards the stairs
is thrown from her '
The mother screams out for her child as the girl goes over the railing
79
: a hundred feet up, Duke and Rip see her coming
Ripcord swings out and catches the girl just in time
Above them, the tower is dissolving before their eyes
Duke sees Snake-Eyes being pushed down the stairs by the tourists
He leaps up onto the iron lattice
Where you going
Each warhead has a kill switch
It's too late
We gotta get off this thing
Those nano-mites will level the entire city
Duke climbs up the side of the tower with his Accelerator Suit
Rip things about following, but then looks at the little girl in his arms, who smiles and hugs him
Snake-Eyes grabs him and they join the flow of people down the stairs
The - chasing them close behind
Below them, Scarlett, Breaker, and Heavy Duty are helping the police evacuate the Tower
: Ana and Storm Shadow race to the top
(into mike) Be ready to pick up in thirty seconds
: The Typhoon gunship rockets towards the top of the disintegrating Eiffel Tower, its   opening
: Duke scales the tower, the - chasing him up
His eyes on the elevator as it reaches the top deck just above him
The Typhoon fires a blast of its at Duke, knocking him off the tower
He falls, but manages to catch the tower just below, the - almost on top of him now
The climbs even faster
: The elevator arrives
Ana and Storm Shadow calmly walk out and climb the railing as the Typhoon hovers up beside them
Below them, Duke sees them board
The tower groans and wobbles
It's a long way down
Time has run out
Ana and Storm Shadow jump into the Typhoon
80
With the - at his heels, Duke clambers up and jumps up off the side of the Tower, sailing up through the air and latching onto the   of the Typhoon
: The gunship rocks with his sudden weight
Ana and Storm Shadow almost lose their footing
Duke springs inside
He smacks Storm Shadow down and grabs the from Ana, pressing the trigger
Immediately, the - pulse with light and fall to the ground around the Eiffel Tower
The Tower groans, half-eaten, then topples over on its side
Ripcord and Snake-Eyes scurry out of the way as it crashes down onto the Seine, sending up an enormous explosion of water
The shock on the faces of everyone around reverberates through the entire Joe team
Ripcord keeps his eyes on the Typhoon as it pulls away
Breaker suddenly gets an idea
Come on
He hauls-ass
- Ana looks at Duke, a pursed smile on her lips
You just saved Paris
Storm Shadow is not happy at all, he  Duke, who drops hard to the floor of the Typhoon

Heavy Duty yanks one of the dead Neo-Vipers out
Breaker yanks off the guy's  then removes a needle-like   from his Scarlett moves into position to help him
Ripcord kneels down
What are you doing
Plugging into his cerebral cortex
With a  , Breaker plunges the needle into the top of the Neo-Viper's head
Ripcord winces at the sight
81
The brain survives for a couple of minutes after death
We can read his most recent memories
Can you find Duke
If this guy remembers the way home we can
:     appearing on Breaker's
Duke shooting him in the face, racing along the highway, driving the
As the images continue, we on the Neo-Viper's open eyes and  : -   - McCullen watching Breaker and Ripcord through the dead Neo- Viper's eyes on a screen
He turns to the Doctor urgently
Destroy that unit immediately
The Doctor removes his  and taps a key to draw up the Neo- Viper's file
He clicks a button that reads ""
- Instantly, the Neo-Viper's body snaps rigid and begins to shake
Everyone gets a shock
Backing up
He's still alive
He's not alive
You ever seen a dead guy do that
They activated a self-destruct
The Neo-Viper's body starts to decay before them
Thousands of - literally eating away at his flesh and bones
Nano-mites

They're eating him
Hurry, Breaker
But the - are too fast
The Neo-Viper's legs are now gone
His chest and arms next
Breaker rapidly scans through the
But now the - consume his head

He gives the Doctor a smile

Ripcord kneels beside him, stunned and bereft
You did the best you could
Relax,  got it

Sir, How do you say "lawyer" in French
If we could get on a Might be to computer we longitude able Input the partial les g es latitude, and Viper, figu the downloaded from tha t re out their locati - (to Ripcord) It'll be a military when they're done tribunal
need a lawyer
We with us And 'll need diapers
84
(to himself) Think, think, think
(to the Joes) At some point they gotta feed us or take us out for the interrogation
When they do 'll jump the lead Guard
Heavy, you go for his weapon and-- --Start an international incident
'm not gonna just sit here
This is bigger than Duke
What if it was one of you
What if they had Heavy or Scarlett, what would you do
The Joes trade looks - rock and a hard place
(') We're not doing Duke a damned bit of good sitting here
If it was reversed, Duke would be kicking down every door between here and the freakin' moon 'til he found me
And we'll do the same for him as soon as we get out of here
She has a thought and turns to Breaker
(') Partial
You said partial latitude and longitude
We only got the one coordinate-- 90 degrees, then the image went to snow
Maybe it was the whole coordinate, just 90 degrees latitude
(they all look at her) () 85
(') Before the image went to snow,
it's the polar ice cap
'   hit the floor and slide to his feet
The Joes all look up to see several   looking at them
- The Joes are led down a hallway
They did away with the guillotine, right
They arrive at a door
The door is opened to reveal a man in a wheelchair, back turned
When he spins around, it's Hawk
General
Hawk just shakes his head and sighs heavily
- The Joes sit around the General, mid-discussion
How long before we're released
The French government is allowing you to leave on the condition that none of you ever return
Other agencies will be handling this from here on
/ What
The heads of state of every member of   are recalling their operatives
We are now considered a rogue unit, uncontrollable
Shut down
We're to report to Washington for debriefing
Hawk rolls his wheelchair to the door
That's it
They've got Duke
86
Hawk stops his wheelchair, turns to them
said you were to report to Washington
didn't say when, or which route to take
Maybe a northern one
Hawk smiles and wheels out the door
-  - rockets through the orange skies, through the sound barrier with an ear-tingling
-  - Storm Shadow sits in a meditative state
Duke is shackled, hands bound, out of his
Ana steps out of the cockpit area and approaches him, nods to Storm Shadow
He thinks  should kill you
Why don't you
James wants to meet you in person
James
Mr McCullen
Ana listen-- --Talk softly, or he'll tazer you again
(raises his bound hands) Loosen these, he'll never taser anything again
She taps the bonds on his wrists
87
should've thought of this before
They almost share a smile
Let me get this straight
You're with McCullen
You're married to that Baron
And you claim you're still in love with me
'm a complex woman
Maybe you just don't know who you are anymore
Who  was died long ago
No, this isn't you,  still see the person  loved behind your eyes
Her eyes soften for a moment
Tell me what she was like
She was smart, and funny
She was loyal as hell
She loved those she was close with, me, her brother
(agonized pause) did my best
With Rex
'm sorry
He was my responsibility
should have
It's why  left, Ana
Why  couldn't be with you
You were in so much pain thought the sight of me just give you more
She seems to be affected by this ever so slightly, then
a hard, cold look comes to her eyes, she shakes her head
It doesn't matter now
No, it matters very much
We have the chance to make things right
88
Nothing will ever be right again
Duke stares at her, his heart ripped apart the two of them and  : -
-  - Rain is drizzling on a military cemetery
Ana sits alone, without family, without Duke, staring straight ahead as Rex's casket is lowered into the ground
Parked on a nearby road is a lone car
Duke sits inside it, staring at the funeral in the distance
His face tells us the anguish he's living with
He pulls out and starts to drive away, the rain on the windshield : /
-    - The Night Raven zeroes down on a stretch of ice near a huge appear under the ice, guiding it in for a smooth landing
The cave swallows the plane whole
- The Night Raven rolls to a stop inside the cave
The side door opens
Storm Shadow exits with the weapons case
Ana leads Duke out, two Neo-Vipers behind them
Storm Shadow clicks a hand held remote and a    opens to reveal a -   awaiting them
Duke uses the moment to lunge forward, grab the case and haul ass towards the cave door
Storm Shadow spins, Shurikan throwing stars in his hands
The Neo-Vipers whip up their pulse rifles
McCullen has plans for him
Storm Shadow throws a star, it whistles across the cave and nails Duke in his shoulder, Duke goes down hard, staggers back up, but the Neo-Vipers are already on him, they start beating the living shit out of him
Ana jogs up
(') Enough
Storm Shadow picks up the case and looks at Duke, face down, bloody and beaten
89
And what was your plan
Run three thousand miles across the ice
He rips his star out of Duke's shoulder
Duke sucks it up
(') Stupid soldier
Duke rolls over and stares up at them, breathing hard
- Ripcord, Scarlett, Snake-Eyes, Heavy Duty and Breaker are in the conn tower of a next-gen submarine, going over a 3- of the polar ice cap
That's a lotta ice
It's gonna be like trying to find whale spit in the ocean
Breaker sees a   flashing on his Ball-Eyepiece
That's strange
What
When they stole the weapons case, set my suit to scan for the tracker beacon in case it came back on, and it just came back on
Ripcord just smiles
That's my boy
- The   comes shooting down out of a shaft in the bottom of the ice cap and rockets down towards the facility
90
- As the diving bell descends, Duke stares at the facility out the portal
He is awed by the immense size of the place, he looks at Ana, proud of her office
Certain work needs to be done away from the public eye
- The diving bell entry port opens, guarded by two Neo-Vipers
McCullen stands waiting
His eyes first move to the weapons case in Storm Shadow's hands
Storm Shadow opens it and shows him the three remaining warheads
McCullen runs his fingers over them, then nods, Storm Shadow closes the case
Take them to the drones
want them ready to launch in one hour
It will be done
And only then does McCullen greet Ana
My beautiful Lady of the Lake
He kisses her
Ana kisses him back with slightly-feigned affection, her eyes open and on Duke
Duke stands there, impassive
McCullen finishes the kiss and turns to Duke
(') This bother you
Duke says nothing, so McCullen steps closer
(') Isn't it funny, with the entire balance of power in the world about to shift, a couple of guys can still have a stare down over who gets the girl
Duke takes the opportunity to   McCullen
The Neo- Vipers instantly pummel Duke to the floor
McCullen wipes a small trickle of blood from his nose
91
(') The interesting thing about my Neo- Vipers is they still think the same thoughts they always did, they just can't act on them anymore
Instead, they do what  want
imagine that must be very frustrating
He gets right down in Duke's face
(') 'm going to make you very unhappy
(grit teeth) 'm already happy
McCullen glances at Ana, watching the display with conflicted eyes
McCullen heads for the door, beckoning the Neo-Vipers to make Duke follow him
- Duke trails behind McCullen and Ana, flanked by Neo-Vipers
What're you gonna do with the warheads
You take to your training well, that's good
Still trying to develop information
Still planning to escape and stope me
Moments from now, you'll see that won't ever happen
Then you won't mind telling me
Isn't it clear
'm a business man
'm going to use them
Millions of people are gonna die if you launch those warheads
What is it you want, McCullen
92
Merely to strike fear into the hearts of every man, woman, and child on the planet
Only then will they look up to the man who wields the most power, and obey him
- The control room is alive with  squirreling about various stations
Monitors show three large sitting in vertical launch bays
Duke sees the drones and his face registers the horror of what McCullen's about to do
He glances at Ana, she quietly looks away, a hint of remorse in her eyes
The Doctor rises to greet McCullen, glancing at Duke for several moments, as if struck by the sight of him
Meet the genius behind all my nanotechnology
My genius lies only in taking what others created to the logical next steps
All modern gains in science are made through theft
You'll have to excuse his modesty, when  found him, he was -- (interrupting, re: Duke) --Another "recruit"
Albeit a rather unwilling one
The Doctor's nano-mites can control all manner of brain functions
When you wake up, you'll be working for me, and your past will be a distant shimmer that floats in and out of your mind like a leaf on a breeze
'll prepare him for the surgery
The Doctor beckons the Neo-Vipers who shove Duke after him towards another door
Duke and Ana exchange one last look
McCullen keeps his eyes on her as she watches him go
93
-  - school of fish swims past the facility, one fish breaks away from the school
: it's not a fish at all, but a mini robotic underwater spy system
-   - sleek submarine drifts silently through the arctic waters
(
0
) Picture's coming on line now
-  - In the Conn Tower of the sub, our team gathers around Breaker who sits at a monitor watching what the "fish" is watching
It's an underwater facility
McCullen's home away from home
Dukes' gotta be in there somewhere
Wait, what's that
Breaker   on a massive -
Oh, Jesus
That's an automated, phased array turbo-pulse battery
(off their looks) really big gun
Could it take out our sub
That thing could take out a dozen subs simultaneously
Then that's our first objective
No, no
Duke's our first objective
94
The main force can't attack as long as that cannon's online
How you figure getting it offline
Snake-Eyes points to the    n the monitor
Elevator cables
They've got a surface entrance
Shipwreck
She turns to the submarine commander,  "" , a fiery Spanish naval combat veteran
Going up, senorita
Scarlett nods and leads the others down a corridor
Snake-Eyes, Breaker, Ripcord, and will infiltrate the factory from above and destroy the cannon
Heavy , as soon as we give the word, you lead the assault from outside
(nods grimly) Go, Joes
-    - quiet wind blows across a remote stretch of arctic ice
All of a sudden the ice pack begins to tremble like the mother of all earthquakes
It cracks and ruptures and then erupts as the   of the submarine crashes through, then grinds to a halt
and two   launch out, landing hard on the ice and speeding away
Ripcord and Breaker on one
Scarlett and Snake-Eyes on the other
-   - McCullen, Ana, and Storm Shadow watch monitors showing securing the warheads onto three rocket propelled -
As the last one is secured a Technician says: All drones prepared and ready, Sir
95
Good, commence the launch sequence immediately
is that a ripple of concern flickering across Ana's face
/
-    - Our team races into the ice cave on their   and park beside the dormant Night Raven
Weapons up
Scanning the place from top to bottom
Ripcord stars at the awesome plane towering before him
That McCullen's got some gadgets
Breaker gestures to the ice wall
Snake-Eyes uses his Katana sword to slice a circle in the wall and yank it out, revealing the   , but no diving bell
Maybe we could slide down
Snake-Eyes shakes his head, doubtful The arctic water would kill us
-   - McCullen, Ana, and Storm Shadow watch the drones sitting in the launch bays on the screens
Technicians are working hard
Three
two
one
ignite primary engines
The entire control room begins to shake
The screens fill with fire
/
-    - The Joes run outside, wondering what the hell is causing the earthquake
large circle of ice near them
And then the first drone   before them and  into the morning sky, peeling away to the east
Before they can react, the second drone   a hundred yards away, peeling off to the west
They hear the third one about to rocket up-- 96
Snake-Eyes thinks fast, sprints into the cave, jumps on a Rock Slide, hauls-ass outside, hits a   on his Rock Slide, prepping two -  on either side of the vehicle
The third drone   from two hundred yards away
Snake-Eyes locks onto its exhaust and
The missiles race up after the drone and knock it out of the sky
It
Metal
Snow
-   - The technicians see this on their monitors
We lost one
Lost one
What do you mean
Bird Three is down, Sir
McCullen looks at the monitors, enraged
Storm Shadow smiles
We're under attack
Alert all defences
Charge up the pulse cannon
He turns to say something to Ana, but she has left the room
-    - Topside, the team watches the two remaining drones race away
What about the other two
We find the kill switches and short out the nano-mites
(shakes his head) They're already way out of range
Then somebody has to go up there and shoot those things down
97
() That's me
-   - Ripcord climbs into the Night Raven's cockpit
Scarlett steps up to watch
He's already flipping switches and putting on a Can you even fly this thing
can fly anything
You just track those warheads and guide me in
We don't have long until they hit
Ripcord
He glances at her, a moment between them
Then she presses forward and kisses him on the mouth
He stares back at her
(') Good luck
Do me a favor
Save Duke
She gives him a nod, then leaves
Ripcord grins to himself
-   - The   tears across the ice and launches into the sky
Ripcord  with adrenaline
Scarlett, Snake-Eyes, and Breaker fast rope down into the first launch bay as the ice  behind them, hiding the hole
-   - We now find Duke, wearing only  , strapped on the operating gurney we saw Zartan on earlier
The warming up around him as the Doctor approaches
The atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima destroyed seventy percent of the city
Seventy percent
Did you know that, Duke
98
Duke looks at him, something familiar
There was a bank situated less than one hundred yards from Ground Zero, destroyed of course
Only one thing survived
It's four bank vaults
And when those vaults were opened, they discovered everything inside them had survived completely unscathed
Who are you
Of course, the vault  took shelter in wasn't that well-made
He unclips his   and lowers the mask to reveal a scarred and burned face
(') Double Bubble
Duke is beyond shocked
Rex
Rex immediately has trouble breathing and returns the mask over his face
(') You sonuvabitch
Ana buried you
moving ceremony, 'm sure
The three volley salute
The flag on the coffin
Why
Why didn't you come in
Because  found out the truth
:   - Rex moves through the building with Fireteam Bravo
99
Intel says the lab's in the basement
Fireteam Bravo kicks open a door
They lead the way down a staircase toward the basement
Rex follows, nervous as hell
The soldiers round a corner, suddenly, Rex hears , he freezes, then silence, Rex pulls out his
45 And rounds the corner to see Fireteam Bravo down
is trying to clear a jam in his machine gun
As he clears the weapon and raises it, Rex raises his
45 and fires first
The Guard drops
Rex checks Bravo, but they're not moving
He looks around the basement, no lab, but he sees a massive  , closed
He heads for the vault, 45 raised, breathing hard
, a blast of refrigerated air hits him as he opens the door
Rex enters a small room filled with   in huge > Something inside the animals is constantly reshaping their appearances, reforming their facial bones and changing the color, texture and elasticity of their skins
There is a scuffling noise, Rex points his gun
small, stooped old  in a lab coat appears
Are you going to shoot me
Rex doesn't respond
(') We knew you were coming
But couldn't walk away from it
Rex stares in awe, not what he was expecting
Stay where you are
His gun up, he finds a   and begins accessing various files, starts reading them
(') These aren't chemical or nuclear-- No
Something much
better
This is beyond anything
This is light years ahead of anyone in the field
100
You see why  couldn't leave
Rex nods, hypnotized by the science in front of him, an instant bond formed with the man who created it
The distant sound of Jets
The Scientist moves to the vault door and begins pulling it closed as we hear the -Dam Bunker Buster whistling towards them
(') If we live, 'll show you everything
- Duke tries to absorb what he's learned
The Doctor continues
The man who created this technology was not our enemy
In fact, he was hired by our very own government to create it
When it was deemed too unethical, they sent us to kill him
He didn't survive the blast
But
lived
(touches his face) And  escaped with his research
Unfortunately  tested it on myself first, and lost my lungs and vocal chords in the process
But now 've perfected it, and you will get a first-hand experience
(his biggest concern) Does Ana know about this, about you
No
and she never will
He glances at the   and Duke realizes
You sick bastard
you did this to your own sister
() loved my sister
Do you have any idea the state she was in
Me dead
You
Depression, drugs
() 101
(') So,  had her brought here, gave her a way to deal with her pain, gave her purpose
Made her strong
gave her a new life, Duke
Why work for McCullen
He saved my life, for starters
Now to mention infinite resources to work in the field of my choosing
That's bullshit
You could have had any job you wanted
didn't want any job
You can't play nice with science, Duke
It's sometimes necessary to experiment, to fail, even to destroy to attain a goal
It's a fact that McCullen has the guts to embrace
(still shocked) Everything she's done, everything she's become, started because she thought you died that day
And because you then abandoned her, let's not forget that part
And with that, he leaves Duke to the  , which menacingly begin to move in
- Scarlett, Snake-Eyes, and Breaker drop down into the launch bay
They see a chrome corridor leading into the facility
It's pressure plated and laser protected
Anyway around it
No
Any object larger than a quarter will fry your britches
Snake-Eyes shakes his head with a sigh, then steps forward and leaps onto the floor, landing on his fingertips
102
Then, with incredible strength, he proceeds to walk across the floor on his fingertips, aware of the continuous crackle and hum of lasers around him
Scarlett and Breaker watch with baited breath
Snake- Eyes now reaches the doorway
(') What you'll have to do is rewire the laser panel's brain by-- --Snake-Eyes swiftly balances on one set of fingertips while his other fingers grab his sword and  the laser panel
The sound of the laser net instantly vanishes
(') or you cold just stab it
- Duke lies on the operating table as a   makes an incision behind his right ear
Duke grimaces
long needle zeroes in on the incision
As the needle dives towards Duke's head, a hand hits a switch and the needle quickly retracts
Duke looks over to see Ana by the controls, gazing at him
don't have much time
She rushes over and unties him and they stare at each other, then kiss passionately
All of a sudden, Duke feels something behind her right ear, he turns her head, --an
He looks at her, but before he can say anything, Ana's body snaps rigid and falls limp in his arms
Ana
Duke looks over to see the Doctor holding his , McCullen and two Neo-Vipers beside him, their rifles on Duke and Ana
Duke gazes at Ana, desperately feeling for her pulse
- Two  man the firing controls of the huge Snake-Eyes takes them out and shuts down the cannon
sends a quick message on his -
- Heavy Duty sees the message appear on a screen
" - " Heavy smiles and turns to Shipwreck
103
Let's get in this fight
- The   submarine peels around a rocky headland now, in full view of the underwater facility
series of fire out of the submarine's launch tubes
Most are blown up by the facility's Harpoon Cannon defenses, but several manage to hit the facility's exterior
-
- The whole place
Scarlett and Breaker blow the control room door and cut down the Technicians trying to shoot them
Breaker takes over a station console
Okay, 've got a lock on the two remaining warheads
Target one is Moscow
Target Two is Washington
Give Ripcord the coordinates
- Snake-Eyes spins to see a pair of   come crashing down at him from behind
He spins, but one of the blades cuts him on his left arm, sending him reeling backwards, it's Storm Shadow
Who quickly powers the laser cannon back online
Snake-Eyes dives to stop him, --and as their swords meet    : , where two sixteen year- olds, Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow, trade blows with wooden katanas
Storm Shadow drops Snake-Eyes, who falls hard, Storm Shadow steps on his throat, sword point in Snake- Eyes' face
Hard Master looks on without expression
: , where Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow's blades flash like lightning, they battle fiercely around the room Neo-Viper charges up the controls
Snake can't stop him
104
- Outside, the massive - swings wildly towards the submarine and fires
ripples through the arctic sea, glancing the side of the vessel
- The submarine shakes hard
Rivets burst
Water pours in
The hull's been ruptured
Everyone into the attack boats
- Hatches open along the sides of the submarine, deploying ten carrying dozens of Joes
At the same time, batches begin to open on the facility and a dozen attack craft carrying dozens of Neo-Vipers emerge
/
-  - Heavy Duty and Shipwreck pilot one of the
The huge opposing force coming at them is quite terrifying
Keep tight everybody
He fires a   which  a Mantis
The mantis craft
The whole area explodes in a pulse fire and harpoon blasts
The Joe submarine sinks and  at the base of the facility
- Duke cuddles dead Ana, clearly emotional
McCullen steps up
Is she still alive
For now
You said this couldn't happen
105
didn't think it could
've never seen anyone defeat the programming, even momentarily
Duke recovers and angrily grabs one of Ana's  and kills the two Neo-Vipers, then turns the gun on the others
The Doctor lifts his , finger on the ""
(') If  press this, Ana dies
Put it down
Your choice, Duke
Put it down
The Doctor doesn't move
McCullen watches the stand-off his right hand discreetly drawing   out from his sleeve
/
-  - Ripcord streaks into the upper atmosphere in the Night Raven, the curve of the Earth visible out his windows
Ahead, he can see a
see it, dead ahead
- Breaker speaks into his headset
You have to knock it down before it re-enters the atmosphere so the nano-mites don't reach the ground
/
-  - Ripcord flicks a switch and opens a   on the nose
Uh, 've got a problem
The fire controls are not in here
106
' What do you mean, not in there
mean  can't see them anywhere
- Scarlett hears this and realizes
It's gotta be voice-activated
' What
You have to say the words into your flight helmet

-  - Ripcord lines up the missile in his sights, gets a lock
Fire
(nothing happens) Shoot
(still nothing) Blast away
Still nothing, the missile streaking onwards towards the Earth
- They hear Ripcord yelling over the speakers
' Nothing's happening
Must be a different language
(to Ripcord) Try "teine"
' What
107
It's Scottish for fire
/
-  - Ripcord's not sure about this, the missile arcing down
Teine
Listen to my voice, "Teine"
Teine

' That's because you're not saying it right
How many different ways you want me to say it
' One way
The right way

And at last the   fires
Blasting the missile out of the sky
The   - floats aimlessly away
- They all see the missile disappear on their screen
Nice work, Ace
You just saved Moscow

-  - Ripcord sighs with relief, already peeling away
Just doing my job
Guide me to the other drone
() 108
(') (under his breath) man,  freakin' saved Moscow
-  - The White House glistens in the midday sun
- The American President's Bodyguards rush him and his staff down into a fortified bunker beneath the White House
How soon will it strike the city
Seventeen minutes, Sir
This will be a disaster the likes of which we have never seen
As the   behind them we see the on the doors
- Another blast from the - destroys a

-  - Heavy Duty sees this as he takes out a
That cannon's going to kill us all
My guy will take care of it, trust me
-   - Snake-Eyes kills the Neo-Viper, who falls down a large shaft into freezing waters
Storm Shadow lunges at Snake-Eyes and the two of them tumble down into the shaft, but land on a gangway
They both leap up and begin to fight again
The Neo- Viper tries to crawl out of the freezing water, seemingly unfazed as he slowly freezes solid
109
All of a sudden, there's   and a series of power on up and down the shaft between various circuit modules
This is where the energy is charged to operate the cannon
One of the lasers catches Storm Shadow's shoulder and burns him severely
Snake-Eyes sees this and ducks just as an fires on beside his head
- Outside, the - fires
The Joe craft desperately weave and dodge
- and the   fades
Instantly, Storm Shadow and Snake- Eyes continue their desperate fight
Swords  and , two masters at their best

Storm Shadow knocks Snake-Eyes to the ground again and places his steel sword against Snake-Eyes' face
Again, Hard Master watches without expression

Storm Shadow twists his body to avoid the   while Snake- Eyes lifts himself up to his toes to avoid a laser that threatens to disintegrate his crotch
Storm Shadow sees this, grins to himself

It seems somebody's shot down the warhead heading for Moscow
Thank God
As he says this, a    draws a and kills the other Agents and Staff
We see an behind his right ear and realize he is a Neo- Viper
The President stares, stunned and horrified
The Neo- Viper holds his pistol on the President as-- 110

An emerges and the President stares in shock

-  - Up in the skies, Ripcord spots the second drone rocketing down towards the lower atmosphere in front of him
Second drone in my sights
- Breaker and Scarlett watch in the control room
Hurry, Rip
You've only got thirty seconds before it enters the lower atmosphere

-  - Ripcord's feeling the pressure
He targets the missile
Taine
But nothing happens
Scarlett's voice yells in his head
' Teine
Teine
Don't yell at me

Ripcord takes a breath, stealing his nerves starts beeping on his control board
Rip does his best to ignore it, focusing on the missile as it begins to disappear into the lower atmosphere
The light beats faster and louder
Teine
The   fires, blasting straight at the missile which is lost in the atmospheric haze below
For a moment, he can't tell if he hit it or not

You missed
The warhead has entered the lower atmosphere

The spread of
Far below him now

McCullen slowly approaching Duke who keeps Ana's pistol on the Doctor, Ana still in Duke's arms
Did you think she loved you
Stay back
Did you imagine your life with her
said stay back
Don't you know you've lost, Duke
All  know is that neither of you deserves her
McCullen suddenly lifts the   in his right hand-- --    tears out at Duke who reflexively fires the   at it
The intense air blast from the pulse pistol catches the flames midway between them and blows them back onto McCullen
McCullen  as his face is literally burned off
The Doctor freaks and drops the , then yanks McCullen out into the corridor
Duke fires after them, then grabs the , removing Ana's screen with a sigh of relief

Getting real close this time
No way he can miss

Actually,  think 'm just about close enough

Then: ' asked you not to yell at me
Relief comes rushing back to Scarlett and Breaker

Are you okay
' Yeah, did it work
Yes
yes, it worked

Snake-Eyes draws his  , its blade shimmering in the laser-light as he redirects the laser back into its module
Storm Shadow does the same with his sword, barely saving his neck
