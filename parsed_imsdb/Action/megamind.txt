perfect view for our guardian hero
He watches the thriving metropolis, bristling with life as people happily go about their day
Yet, we can't help but detect a hint of sadness in Uberman's expression

You look so peaceful from up here
His serenity is suddenly interrupted by a loud coming from his wrist
He looks down at a  (a manly one) on his right arm
It's a silver band with a  red letter ""
(') Looks like Roxanne's in trouble again
Uberman leaps off the building and into the air
His cape gracefully flows in the breeze behind him as he shoots off into the distance like a speeding bullet
- Grime and moss decorate the outside of this long abandoned building overlooking the
Once a place of knowledge and wonder - now home to a great evil

He's dressed in the kind of costume only a super villain could pull off: a ""

One, a hulking brute, is dressed as
The other, a small intellectual-type carrying a clip-board, is dressed as the philosopher
hate the outfits
mean,  get it: we're all supposed to be "masterminds" - very clever
() 3
(cont'd) just feel stupid
mean, what the hell did Einstein really do anyway
Theory of relativity
Einstein starts feverishly scratching his side
Well, you'd think he'd invent a wool sweater that didn't itch so much
Da Vinci and Plato's eyes suddenly grow with concern as they see Master Mind walk up behind Einstein
Einstein notices his colleague's staring over his right shoulder and turns around
He turns around and Master Mind      with his metal gauntlet
The real Einstein once said, "God does not play dice with the world
" He was right, because the world is dice
Is that understood
& Sir
Yes, sir
(gasping for air) Yes, sir
Master Mind undoes his grip on Einstein's throat
Alright, then - clean slate
Do we have the girl
Yes, sir
She fell into our trap just like you knew she would
Reporters are a curious lot, and easily manipulated
He quickly checks his physique in a  , adjusts his posture and sucks in his gut
4
Alright, let's not keep the lady waiting
Da Vinci escorts a  and bound woman, , to the back of the room where Plato and Einstein are standing guard over a large  - facing away from us
She pulls free of Da Vinci's grasp and waits for him to undo the blindfold
Her face uncovered, we finally see Roxanne's striking features - all of which seem overshadowed by piercing eyes that seem more put off by the situation than afraid of it
(
) Miss Ritchi, we meet again
The chair turns menacingly slow, finally revealing Master Mind
You didn't need to turn around like that
can recognize the stench of failure
Master Mind unleashes a wicked laugh
trust you gentlemen know the very sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly regarded investigative journalist who some say has a more than friendly relationship with our super powered foe Uberman
And Miss Ritchi,  trust you've already met my new crew: The Mad Geniuses
Roxanne gives Einstein a once over
Looks like a real group of winners
At the risk of sounding cliche', you'll never get away with this
In a way,  already have
Roxanne unleashes an exhausted
5
We go through this every time
You kidnap me to get to Uberman, he immediately finds your hideout, escapes whatever lame trap you've come up with, and takes you and your cronies to jail
propose we just save everybody some heartache this time by  letting me go, and forgetting this whole thing ever happened
What about my revenge
We can say it was wasting everyone's time
You have a wicked tongue
hope you rid yourself of that when you're my queen
Roxanne unleashes a snort-filled laugh
'm sorry
What makes you think would want to be your queen
Power corrupts absolutely, Miss Ritchi
And when  have ultimate power over this city,  have absolutely every intention of corrupting you with it
Sir
Master Mind turns to Plato who's now standing at a computer terminal
(annoyed) What is it
- Uberman flies toward the Observatory like a rocket
6
- Uberman crashes through the wall to the room we were just in
He looks around, but there's suddenly
: '  - The boat is shooting through the ocean, away from the observatory
- Machines, cables and terminals criss-cross the craft's main bridge
Through the enormous surrounding windows we can see the observatory shrinking in the distance
Master Mind watches Uberman on a small  monitor as the hero intently searches his hideout
(on monitor) Master Mind
- Uberman throws up his arms in frustration when suddenly - (
) Over here, old friend
He turns to see a What's the matter, miss your old jail cell
Uberman starts walking toward the monitor
( ) Actually,  wanted to share the experience with my oldest friend
shoots out of the floor, suddenly trapping Metro City's protector
Totally unfazed, our hero stares on

You can't possibly believe this will work
Master Mind pulls out a    with a on it
( ) Oh, can't

doubt even you are strong enough to withstand the He presses the button
sinister-looking  orbits Earth's atmosphere
Its bay doors suddenly open, deploying two huge
The panels shift, angling themselves in the direction of the sun
They immediately start  as they absorb the burning star's power
The front of the satellite begins to make a loud as it prepares to unleash its unholy power
- From the giant window we can see the boat is a good mile from the observatory
We're now at minimum safe distance, master
Master Mind turns from the  he was broadcasting on and puts down the control box
Excellent
Stop here,  like this view
Twenty seconds until impact
Master Mind turns to Roxanne who is being held by Da Vinci and Einstein
She almost appears a little bored
Disappointed by her lack of horror, he walks over to the monitor now showing Uberman trapped in the cage
8
Any last words
Uberman looks up at the screen with a cocky smile
( ) Yes: there's no caging the power of justice
Ten seconds to impact
On the screen we see Uberman take two of the cage's bars in his hands
He yanks
(') Nine
Master Mind stares at the monitor, slightly confused
(') Eight
Uberman yanks on the bars again, this time using his foot as leverage
(genuinely concerned) What's going on
(straining) Hold
on
a second
Master Mind looks back at Plato and Einstein
They're equally befuddled at the hero's sudden weakness
Seven
Uberman loses his grip and
Master Mind and the minions all cringe in unison
Da Vinci turns to Roxanne not believing his ears
What did he just say
9
Six
Five
Master Mind begins to laugh
What kind of trick is this
Uberman looks up at the camera with a very grave expression
Like you don't know
These bars are made of copper, aren't they
Four
Yeah, so
Uberman tries to shield his grief with his hand
You figured out my weakness, damn you
'
Three
Your weakness is copper
Two
one
Everyone turns to the window
The satellite fires a giant    toward the earth
- The beam hits the observatory
The building instantly in a white nova blast of fire
- The blast is so bright everyone turns away from the window
Then, as suddenly as it began, the awesome light dies out
One by one, the passengers unshield their eyes and look out toward the observatory
10
All we can see through the haze of destruction is fire and smoke
don't think even he could have survived that
Einstein suddenly turns giddy with excitement
Whoa
Is it me or did you just finally destroy Uberman
(carefully skeptical) Well
let's not get ahead of ourselves
Da Vinci suddenly sees something outside
Look, there's something in the sky, coming this way
Uberman
Master Mind turns toward the window
An object is in the air, flying directly toward them
As it closes in we can just make out the ' Everyone scatters and braces themselves for the impact
Master Mind, seeing all the good places taken, doesn't know what to do with himself
He just covers his giant head with his hands
The figure     and lands at his feet
He looks down to see a
Around its neck is the unmistakable black cape of Uberman
(') (horrified) 11
Roxanne breaks out of Da Vinci's hold and runs over to the body
Uberman
She stares down at the still smoking corpse, the tattered black cape with the yellow "" on it
Roxanne turns to Master Mind, who's still visibly dumbfounded at the grotesque sight before him
(') You killed him
Roxanne's eyes roll back
Da Vinci catches her from behind as she
Einstein turns to Master Mind, looking at him as if he's just walked on water
You did it
Now that he's committed the impossible - our villain is at a complete loss
so  did
mean,  know you always wanted to
mean, all the schemes all the plots -  never thought you'd actually be capable of it
Giddy as a school girl, Einstein turns to his fellow henchmen
This is history
Every villain and lackey in the history of villains and lackeys dream of this moment, but when does it actually happen
sudden realization comes over his face
Good lord
You do all realize what we get to do now, don't you
12
His question is met with acquisitive looks from Master Mind and the others
We get to go on a crime wave
-   "Fun Fun Fun" by The Beach Boys
: "' " It's driving along when the men inside suddenly notice something - '
We   to see the truck being carried by a giant claw at the bottom of a
Inside the cockpit Master Mind and his henchmen laugh maniacally
: "- " Da Vinci and Einstein run out the front of the bank holding Two beat officers see them and take chase after them around the corner and into an alley
After a moment the police reemerge from the alley screaming and running for their lives as a    after them
The robot stops, then suddenly it's head opens up like convertible car top with Master Mind and Plato at the driver's wheel
They smile and shake hands at a bad deed well done
: "
" It's heading for downtown Metro as Master Mind and the lackeys coolly look on
Three large   pull up, filled to the brim with bricks of
13
The  jump out as the lackeys take the driver seats in the three trucks
Master Mind is about to climb into the passenger seat of one when a drivers taps him on the shoulder and motions toward the tornado
(absentmindedly) Oh, right
Master Mind pulls a television  from his pocket and aims it at approaching windstorm of death
He presses the button marked "Tornado Off
" The tornado shrinks and disappears just before it hits the city
As they drive through the city streets, Master stares out the window with a hint of something in his eyes
Is it melancholy
- It's Metro City's premier bowling alley
On top of the neon lit building is a  30
- (early 30's) takes careful aim with his It's a sport of honor, focus and grace
Honor the ball, focus on the pins, release the ball not hard and fast, but as if you were releasing a baby dove
He takes a step, pulls back his arm, and releases the ball, following it with his eyes
It's a horrible shot -
An aged barmaid type with a cigarette hanging from her mouth looks over at him
Okay, do something like that - but center it more
14
She picks up her custom made   and takes aim
Tell me how my form looks, honey
Hal focuses on the misshapen bumps of her enormous Johnson administration era derriere
Oh, it's lookin' good
It's lookin' good
It doesn't get anymore clear
This man is a pig
(
) Hal,  want to see you in my office
Hal turns to see , owner of the bowling alley, calling him
Now
- '  - Hal sits down, facing Vinnie who's sitting at his desk
You're fired
Leave your shirt and locker key
This bit of news hits Hal like a freight train
Fired
Are you going to tell me why
Showing up to work late
Showing up to work late drunk
Sexually harassing customers
Stealing from the register
Vinnie,  don't know where you're getting these accusations - Vinnie takes out a video tape from his desk drawer and puts in a
15
Oh, which one do you supposedly have here
This is all of them at once
walks up to a   and hands him a pair of shoes
As the employee turns to the wall of shoes, a very drunk and disheveled Hal comes running in and pushes him aside
've got this one, Benny
So, Cinderella
Can  help you find your glass slipper
Yeah, 'm looking for a seven
He folds his arms on the counter and leans into her with a cat-like grin on his face
(with a leer) Seven - Well, maybe  could interest you in something in an Namely, me
Disgusted, she walks off screen
Lesbo
Suddenly realizing the register's open, he quickly grabs a stack of cash and shoves it in his pocket
Vinnie turns off the television and waits for Hal to respond
From the angle of the camera,  can see where you might have gotten the wrong idea
Listen, Vinnie,  don't think you've thought this through
If you fire me, who's gonna be captain of the alley's bowling team
16
Um,  don't know
Maybe somebody who can actually bowl
You guys have never won a game
hired you because you said you were on the pro circuit
No,  said    on the pro circuit
Please, a loser like you will never amount to anything
This harsh remark seems to leave Hal genuinely stunned
Wow
If that's how you feel guess we should then talk about what kind of severance 'm gonna get
- open the door and throw Hal out onto the street
He quickly picks himself up and turns back toward the building
Hey
what about my ball
bowling ball sails past him, just missing his head
Thank-you
7   - The massive building with a giant 7 on the roof stands in the heart of Metro City
7   -  - The cubicles and offices are alive with the hustle and bustle of a busy news day
Phones are ,  are , and Editors are The elevator doors open and out steps Roxanne Ritchi
17
Everything stops as the entire office suddenly falls
Somewhat taken aback by the reaction, Roxanne scans the room to see every eye on her
It's
um
It's good to be back
Thanks for everyone's cards and concerns
really appreciated it - now 'm ready to climb back on the horse
No one is budging - their looks of pity are really starting to make her uncomfortable
The back office door suddenly opens and out comes , the gruff, middle-aged Producer of Channel 7 News
Noticing the silence, he looks up and sees the sad expressions on everybody's face
Someone die or something
He suddenly notices Roxanne - both feet are placed firmly in his mouth
(cursing himself) Oh, Jesus
It's okay
Frank quickly walks up to Roxanne and takes her gently by the arm
Come on into my office, sweetie
7   - '  - He sits her down on his leather couch, then quickly turns toward his door
Can we get this woman some water for God's sake
(to Rebecca) gave you two months off
What're you doing back
People are gonna think 'm a slave driver
18
Aren't you
Yeah, but  don't want people to think it
Frank, listen
want to go back to work
to go back to work
You're hysterical, aren't you
Frank sits down on the couch and blankets Roxanne with What're you doing
Keeping you warm before you go into shock
(toward the open door) quickly enters with a bottled water
She sets it on the table in front of them and leaves
Roxanne pulls herself out of Frank's grasp and stands up to face him
It was a traumatic experience
Yes, everyone knows Uberman and me were
close
But what  really need - what would really make me better is getting back to work
There's a sudden awkward silence from Frank
Well, that's going to be
thought you'd be happy to have me back
19
Oh, we are
Honey, nothing makes us happier than to have our girl back, but
Yes
Things have sorta
changed
In three weeks
Listen, 'm not one who likes to open up wounds - especially ones that are just starting to scab, but you were sorta our go to girl for the exclusive on Uberman
And now that he's gone
moved Brad into your anchor spot
(disgusted) Brad
Brad Helms
The man is an idiot
It's the suits
They think it's time to switch things up
Oh, because they can't use me to get the big story
'mon, Roxie
Using is in the nature of what we do
They used you, you used Uberman
Everybody's happy
(defensive) didn't use him
Oh,  didn't mean that
know you two were in love or something
My bad
We were
20
And that's great
Very in love
There's a hind of self-doubt in Roxanne's expression, as if she's failed to convince even herself of this
Okay
So, where are they going to move me if Brad has my spot
Human interest
Bake sales and pet stories
told them  wouldn't be surprised if you just upped and quit
You busted your ass for that desk
Roxanne can hardly get it out - she's busy swallowing her pride 'll take it
Frank looks up at her, not believing what he's hearing
What
- Amongst the jungle of high rises, one small building stands out from the rest -  tiny, forgotten piece of 19th century Gothic architecture
, revealing    holding a cracked plaque, reading:
- mixture of old and new
Dusty Victorian furniture and dilapidated bookshelves sit side by side with pristinely futuristic machinery
The building has been converted into Master Mind's new 21
In the center of the main room is a three storey tall At the base of it is a sign that reads "Reactor - Don't Touch
" We   to the   where Master Mind is sitting on a couch watching
(
) It's been nearly six weeks, and still no word on the whereabouts of billionaire playboy, and philanthropist, Wayne Scott
Tune in at 11:00 as we look into what has become Metro City's biggest mystery
(
) We now return to "The Hero of our Hearts: The Uberman story
" Einstein and Plato come into the room holding a
Just robbed the diamond exchange
(feigning pleasure) Great, great
Put it on the pile
Einstein tosses it on a   of purloined valuables in the corner of the room
Anything else today
No
Master Mind turns his attention back to the screen
Plato sees that Master Mind is in a funk and tries to snap him out of it
(cheerfully) Sir, the new reactor is installed
Plato nods to the giant orb
Do you want to throw the switch know how you love to start reactors
22
Maybe later
Einstein gives Master Mind a funny look then exchanges glances with Plato before leaving the two of them alone
Without turning away from the , Master Mind addresses Plato
(') What is it, Plato
(nervously) Sir,  can't help but notice that you've been
a little down lately
When  want your opinion 'll beat it out of you
Yes, sir,  know, but please forgive my impertinence
It's just that you seem to have lost your lust for our profession
You've stopped going on jobs and spend most of your time watching Uberman specials
Master Mind relaxes slightly and turns to face the window in a classically contemplative pose
After an overdramatic beat
have defeated my greatest enemy
have free reign over Metro City
have more wealth than a thousand Sultans
've achieved all  have worked for
so why am  so unhappy
He walks over to a   that looks almost exactly like him, except slightly older, maybe meaner -  ' mean, my father, god rest his evil and tormented soul, raised me straight from the test tube to be a symbol of evil
() 23
(cont'd) And,  have accomplished something he had only dreamed about - the destruction of Metro City's champion
tell you, 've always lived with this unquenchable thirst
thought it was to make him proud or to get absolute power
But now that 've pretty much accomplished both,  am at a loss
sort of have a theory about all that
(snippy) Oh, really
Well, for one thing, maybe Uberman was more important to you than you thought
He was a worthy rival
Sometimes wonder, did he consider me his evil equal or was  just an annoying, little gnat to him
What's the second part
think you sort of have a thing for Roxanne Ritchi
Master Mind quickly takes his lackey by the throat
Sir, your plans always involve Ms
Ritchi either being kidnapped or placed in danger
If that's not love,  don't know what is
It's the grown up equivalent of dipping her pigtails in the ink well
Don't you see
She's the one treasure that's always escaped you
From Master Mind's expression, we see Plato's words beginning to ring true
24
- Roxanne is having lunch with several girlfriends sitting around her, gabbing
#1 can't believe you came back so soon
#2 Are you sure it's not  , honey
just wanted to get back to work
#3 What we need to do is get you back on the saddle
the love saddle
Friend 1 and 2 give 3 disapproving looks
#3 It's been three weeks
#2 She just lost the love of her life, Grace
comes by with a tray of   and begins setting them out for the ladies
keep trying to tell people it wasn't really like that
Uberman and  - We were kinda having problems
We broke up
The waiter
The women are too shocked by Roxanne's revelation to notice
#1 You broke up with Uberman
#3 You must have ,  high standards
mean, you were dating a god
mean, what's it take
Maybe someone who's a little more aware of his faults
Someone a little more sensitive
25
#3 Right
Someone who listens, sexy but attainable with cute little cheeks like a hamster and heartbreak in his eyes
She turns to Friend one and two to explain
#3 She wants John Cusack
#2 The actor
#3 No, the famous pediatrist - Yes, the actor
Ever since we were teenagers, Roxanne's totally had the hots for him
Well, until he miraculously comes walking into my life, 'm just going to take a little reflection time for myself
The waiter gets a confused look on his face then slips away as Roxanne and her friends continue to chat away
- The waiter tosses his apron in a trash can, then rolls up his sleeve and presses His image gets staticy, like a  station going out, then disappears - revealing the man's true form underneath: Who the hell is John Cusack
- pushes her baby stroller past a building construction site
local  addresses a group of  on the sidewalk, including Roxanne
26
The Fifth Avenue Renovation Project, which  championed, will breath new life into the downtown area
New life means new jobs and new revenue
Councilman, is it true that your brother-in-law's construction company won the contract for this project
Well
er
yes, but
look 'm not here to answer a lot of crazy questions
The young mother stops halfway down the block, reaches into the stroller and tries to comfort her now crying baby
Above her, a  is maneuvering a pile of   to an upper floor
Hal comes around the corner and heads in her direction
The crane
The  has a confused look on his face as he moves levers back and forth in an effort to fix the problem
Hal stops a few feet from the woman and stoops down to tie his shoe
The operator's hand slips off the lever, hitting a To his horror the crane
The woman looks up to see the girders seconds from crushing her and her baby
She screams
Hal looks up and sees it as well
He starts to run out of the way and crashes into the woman and stroller
27
The reporters turns their cameras just in time to catch on film what appears to be Hal pushing the woman to safety just as the
Tears of joy in her eyes, the woman picks up her baby and kisses it
Hal struggles to catch his breath as the mother turns to him
Thank you
Thank you for saving me and my baby
She hugs him with her free arm, weeping with joy
(not knowing what she's talking about) Huh
He's a little uncomfortable with the woman's public display of affection and the small child in-between their embrace
(') There, there
Hal slowly eases out of the woman's grip
(') Okay, we better
well,  hear these little guys smother easy
The reporters rush over and surround Hal and the mother
What's it feel like to be a hero
Hal looks up at Roxanne
Instantly, he's captivated by her beauty
Well
'm just a man doing what men do
You're Roxanne Ritchi, aren't you
They're suddenly interrupted when another reporter pushes his way in between them
Were you scared
28
Scared
Who had time
The reporters eat this up
- John Cusack stands in the rain looking up at a window of a two story house
He holds up a  and "In Your Eyes" by Peter Gabriel begins to play
From the couch, Master Mind and his minions watch
John Cusack, huh
So all  have to do is have a cute puppy dog stare, be willing to make a fool of myself and - Oh,
He turns to see Da Vinci watching the movie and wiping a tear from his cheek
Please, get a hold of yourself
- Roxanne is carrying a large paper coffee cup in her hands as she peruses the isles
She sets it down on a shelf to pull a book out and ends up
Shit
She goes to pick it up when someone bends down and picks it up for her
Looking up to thank him, Roxanne is suddenly stunned speechless - It's popular and critically acclaimed actor , or rather Master Mind disguised as him
" " Oh the humanity - it was a Venti
(stunned) You're
you're
" " Yes, it's me
John Cusack
the actor
29
He notices the book she's reading
" " Hey, is that Shelly
Wait,  think remember something from that one - Let's see: "My head is screaming ` want you and need you' - my heart it keeps reaching to see you and feel you - yet in the end, 'm alone once again
" Wow,  scare even myself
'm sorry
'm just really into poetry
Probably because 'm so sensitive and always going to great lengths to express myself
But enough about me
Can fill you up
(captivated) Yes
(catching herself) mean, excuse me
" " Can  fill you up
Your coffee
Right
' - Roxanne talks as John Cusack listens to her every word intently
did have a boyfriend - until fairly recently
She suddenly begins to feel the stares around her as passers- by being to notice who she's with
'm sorry - this is so surreal
" " Yeah, they charge way too much at these places - Now back to your boyfriend
'm interested and compassionate
want to know about you
30
Things were complicated
He was a man married to his work
There was
there was a lot of competition in his line of business
'm sure you know what that's like
" " Sure
In my business, one thing have is
For example, mine is
uh
Lou Ferr
igno
The body-builder who used to play The Hulk on
" " Did he
Well, we're always up for the same roles
Did your boyfriend have someone like that particular rival that was always getting his goat - so to speak
Well
one rival in particular seemed to get more of his attention than  ever did
But enough about my problems
" " ,
Suddenly realizing his outburst, he begins  to mask it
" " (') 'm sorry
got a whooping cough
Had it ever since Serendipity (fakes cough) See, there it goes again
Please, go on
Right, well, he seemed to need him more than he needed me
" " How do you mean
31
It was conflict he thrived on
He always said he wouldn't know what to do with himself if Master - mean, this guy were gone
It was like he needed it, like oxygen
The answer to his mental funk hits him like a bolt of lightening
He turns away from her as if for private time
" " (almost to himself) think  finally understand
The only logical answer is to recreate that rivalry - or if that's impossible, create one of equal structure
That's it
What
John Cusack snaps out of his dream-like haze realizing she's heard every word
" " Oh, sorry, sorry
Just rehearsing for a part
where  play a man who talks to himself at inappropriate times
In a sudden rush, he rises out of his chair
" " have to go right now, but 'd really like to see you again - if that's alright
Roxanne looks up at him - She can't help but laugh at the craziness of the situation
'd love that
- Master storms in the office to find Plato and Einstein playing darts with the original Mona Lisa
Got her nose
've got it
32
Everyone stops what they're doing upon seeing that their master has returned
've got it
It's plain and simple
Extraordinary minds need extraordinary stimulation
Without that stimulus they wither and die
Therefore, there is only one logical conclusion:  must create a new superhero
Yeah, maybe that's not such hot idea
(ignoring him) Prepare for Operation Superhero Genesis
-  - The lab is slick, white and ultra modern
Dressed in a lab coat, Master Mind enters through a rubbing his hands excitedly
Prepare the subject
He glances down into a large  in the floor to see a naked thirty year old man, , shivering
Above the hole, a huge vat dangles precariously
Master Mind steps behind a glass partition next to Plato and Einstein
(') Plato, pour the toxic waste
Plato throws a switch causing the vat to tip hundreds of gallons of green and brown goo into the hole
(') Drainage
The slime is sucked out through the floor, leaving a goo- soaked Severs
33
Master Mind looks into the pit
(') Well, Severs
feel fine
Just a little sticky, but aside from that everything's completely - - Severs explodes
hail of blood and tissue covers Master Mind and his men
For a good ten seconds nobody moves an inch
Finally
Okay then
-  - Through a glass   we see a man breathing normally
And this one
We attached gills to him
He can breath under water
Ah
Does he have extraordinary strength
Well
no
Can he fly
No
Resilient to weapons fire
No
He just breathes under water, then
Ah
yeah
34
Master Mind rolls his eyes and walks away
-  - The next guinea-pig, , is standing in a sealed glass tube not much wider than himself
Plato, the radioactive spider, please
Plato throws the switch     onto Stenwick's arm
Stenwick looks and winces as it bites him
Ow
He brushes the spider off
Anything, Stenwick
(shaken) No
Ah
sir,  didn't know this was about spiders
have a pretty severe case of arachnophobia
Master Mind thinks for a moment, then turns to Plato
We're gonna need more venom
Plato throws another switch, this time on poor Stenwick
His  begin to fade as he's engulfed with swarms of crawling arachnids
(') How `bout now, Stenwick
Stenwick
-  - Master Mind is pacing back and forth
The muted  plays in the background
This has proven to be a challenge
just don't know what  want
What do  want
35
He stares at Einstein, Da Vinci and Plato, but they offer no advice
(') want a man of moral fiber with a strong sense of right and wrong
Someone who doesn't seek power - instead, they must have it thrust upon them and find, within themselves, the courage to rise to the occasion
Einstein lets out a short laugh, getting everyone's attention
Yeah, well, it sounds like what you want is Uberman
Master Mind snaps the fingers of his non-metal hand
That's it
Why make a copy when the real thing will do
The lackeys look at each other, they can't believe what they're hearing
was just kidding, sir
In case you forgot, you actually burned Uberman alive
Then we'll make a new one
Plato, bring me the box
Master Mind and the lackeys stand in a circle around a small table
Plato places a    in the tables center
As Master Mind opens it, he's immediately doused in emanating from inside
Behold - Uberessence
The very thing that gave Uberman his superhuman powers
36
Where the hell did you get that
Oh,  shot him with a power sucking gun and had this idea to use this to clone a whole army of evil Ubermen
'm not sure why  never got around to following up with that
believe he defeated you before you could, master
Right
Man, he was good
You want another volunteer, sir
Not another volunteer driven by the need for personal gain
Somebody else, somebody pure
Master Mind turns to see an    playing on the muted television
Underneath his face is a blue caption with white lettering that reads: "Hal Stewart - Metro City's Newest Hero
" who risked his own life to save that of a young mother and her child
Please, please, you're embarrassing me
saw someone in need and helped them
What more can we ask of ourselves
ask you, what more
smile creeps across the evil one's face
(') Somebody like him
- Plato is sitting in the van, staring into a pair of binoculars as he speaks on a cellphone
37
Yeah, sir
This guy is a real piece of work
He used to teach bowling at Kingpin's
'  - Master Mind is sitting with his feet up on a computer console as he speaks to Plato
(into phone) modest profession to brilliantly hide his true heroic nature
love it
- Then you are absolutely going to love this - We follow Plato's line of sight across the street where we see
- He volunteers at a school for the blind
'  - Intrigued, he suddenly sits up in his chair
He volunteers
He doesn't ask for any reward for his deeds
The fates are shining down on me
This Mr
Stewart is truly an unselfish soul
- From a distance, Hal seems to be consoling an upset child who's sitting on a rock
But up close
You greedy little bastard already gave you a twenty
Hey, you want me to play along
Then pay up, bitch
38
Fine, but you better be convincing
He gives the kid a bill out of his wallet and looks over his shoulder to see a   walking toward them
Here she comes, go to work
Like a miniature Brando, the blind kid buries his face in his hands and begins to cry
(weeping) Why can't  see
Why God
Hal puts a warm consoling hand on the weeping boy's shoulder
Hey, Peter
'mon champ, let me look at you
The Hot Teacher stops and curiously watches from a distance
The boy looks up at Hal, tears running down his dark sunglasses - he should get an Oscar
You know, in life we're all given no more than we can bear
This happened to you maybe because you were meant to rise above it - Maybe to be an inspiration to the other little Peteys out there
You really think so, Hal
Hey, does it  like 'm lying
Now c'mon, go feel your way to class before you get your little butt suspended
The boy stands up and is about to take off
Petey, wait a minute
Hal uses his shirt sleeve to wipe the tears away from the boy's face before sending him on his way
39
The Hot Teacher grabs her chest
Her heart is about to absolutely melt
Don't run into anything
- Plato lowers his binoculars
From his perspective, Hal should be next in line for popehood
think 've seen enough, sir
This is your guy
(
) (over radio) Then return to base
We have much work to do
Plato starts up the van and pulls away
- It's a busy night
couple of trucker types are shooting pool as the bartender slings drinks
Hal is nursing a beer at the bar when he suddenly notices a very   sitting next to him
As he goes to straighten his stool-posture, Hal suddenly catches himself on the bar's  - it's a story about how he saved the woman and her baby at the construction site
He turns back to the Attractive Woman next to him, then back to the
plan of attack is forming
(obviously playing it up for the woman's benefit) Oh, there it is again
This is really getting embarrassing now
The woman looks up at the screen and gives Hal a double-take
Oh my God
It's you
You're the man who saved that woman   and her baby the other day
It is   you, isn't it
#1, getting a drink at the bar next to them, 40
Hal rolls his eyes and puts his hands up in the air
(to Attractive Woman) Oh, crap
You got me
#1 taps Hal on the shoulder
#1 Let me tell you something
That was just about the bravest damn thing 've ever witnessed
(he turns to the rest of the bar) Hey, everybody
This guy's the hero from The bar
Hal is riding on the shoulders of #2 and #3 as `'m Holding Out For  Hero' plays on the jukebox
#1 suddenly puts his hands in the air
The room quickly goes silent
#1 want to give you something
He reaches into his pocket and takes out a medal
He holds it up in the air for everyone to see
#1 (') Lost my whole platoon
They were a lot a good boys, a lot of good boys
That was just the way things were in "The Grenada
" 'd rather a real hero have this
Trucker#1 gives the medal to a speechless Hal
Hey, you're on  again
The crowd looks up at the Television
- The anchor man,   (early 40's, amazing mustache), suddenly has a memo passed to him
41
This just in
Upon a second look at that tape from this morning, which we'll now replay for you, it appears it was not the heroic act it first seemed to be
The tape shows Hal running in slow motion
(
) (') With the tape slowed down you can actually see the man push the woman and her child out of the way in an effort to save his own life
The tape shows Hal, in a clear act of self-preservation, pushing the woman and child out of the way
: - In unison, everyone turns their heads back to Hal
guess that looks kinda bad
Trucker#1 snatches his medal back
- Master Mind, Da Vinci and Plato look down, spotting Hal cutting through a dark alley
There he is, boss
Da Vinci hands Master Mind a fantastic looking silver rifle
Now, we're sure this won't kill him
Yes, sir
He'll just feel a slight electrical shock
Good
Master Mind raises the rifle and aims it at Hal
42
- Hal wipes the blood from his nose with his shirtsleeve
suddenly zaps Hal in the back
His teeth spark and arc electrons as his entire body shakes and shudders violently
He finally collapses, knocking over a row of garbage cans
- An angry Master Mind slaps Plato
Slight electrical shock
- Hal lies flat on his back, his jacket smoldering
Dazed, he slowly rises to his feet and looks up at the sky
God,  hate the weather in this city
Hal walks off into the night as he attempts to slap the emitting smoke from his jacket
- Master Mind turns to Da Vinci
Follow him
'  - It's a dirty, small studio
Laundry lies everywhere, dishes are piled in the sink and the litter box looks like a minefield
Hal comes staggering in
Through his  we see the lights wobble and streak like a hallucination
He shakes his head trying to clear thing up, but it looks worse
Hal makes his way to the kitchen table and plops down on a chair
The room begins to swim
His  jumps on the table and sits down in front of him
43
From Hal's  the cat's face looks like we're seeing it through a kaleidoscope
Hal seems fascinated by it
You don't look so good, man
don't feel good
was struck by freaking lightening
Suddenly Hal realizes his cat's talking to him
(') You can talk
No, you're just hallucinating
By the way, we're out of orange juice
Hal jumps up, trips over a cardboard box and knocks himself out on the coffee table
'  - Hal lies in the same position we left him last night
He sits up and grabs his head
He looks like he has the worst hangover in the world
Finally, he remembers last night
He looks around, but not really sure what he's looking for
Man
Shaking his head, he walks to the kitchen and opens the refrigerator
He pulls out an orange juice container and puts it to his mouth
It's empty
As if suddenly remembering something he looks from the carton to the cat, who is busy cleaning himself
He shakes the thought from his mind
Hal lifts the seat and unbuckles his pants
44
' He stares at the ceiling with half closed eyes
The inevitable sound of urine hitting water starts
content look washes over his face
There is a distinct sound of porcelain  and The sound intensifies
Hal looks down to see his (') Oh, God
He whips his stream away only to cut a
(') Oh, God
He freaks out and begins to lose control of his flow as it destroys everything he accidently aims at; the bathroom mirror, a bottle of cheap cologne, the bathroom window
(') Oh, God
He aims back for the toilet, which is pretty much rubble now, to see the floor give way
Finally, the pee stops and he glances down the hole
He sees his downstairs  sitting at his breakfast table
He has a fork halfway to his mouth as he stares at the smashed toilet on his pancakes
- Hal turns the corner to see his bus pulling away from the stop
Wait
He starts running after it
-
(') Whoa, whoa, whoa
Unable to stop, he        and falls back to the ground
45
As the bus continues on he sees an  of his torso right below the rear window
Stunned, to say the least, he rises to his feet
(') Something's not right here
He slaps himself in the face as hard as he can
(') Wake up
Wake up, Hal
Hal spins around to see a car barreling toward him
He goes to jump out of the way -  - he , nails a building and comes crashing back down to the sidewalk
Hal sits up, disheveled and scared
(') Okay, okay
Let's get it together, man
He closes his eyes in an attempt to will back his sanity
(') This is just some sort of
episode
It will pass, it will pass
He opens his eyes and looks down the street is coming toward him
(') Well, not too fast  hope
As she passes him and turns the corner out of his view he catches    - an old disgusting one
(') Yes, fast, fast
He turns away from her in horror only to see going about their business
He rubs his eyes and looks down the street again
Everyone has returned to a clothed state
46
He relaxes a little until he looks down and notices that he's floating a foot off the ground
(') think  need to go home
'  - Hal's front door  as it slowly opens, revealing Master Mind
He walks over to the bathroom and smiles to himself as he notices the giant hole in the floor
Welcome to your second birth, Hal Stewart
Master Mind continues to survey the room
He stops to look over a " "  on Hal's living room wall
He focuses on the majestic image of Pat Morita teaching a young Ralph Macchio to kick
(') Instruction is very important in the formative years
Every hero needs a mentor, a father figure to look up to
He presses his special watch, causing his body to -
" " Perfect
'  - Hal enters, grabs a bottle of vodka from atop of the fridge and takes a long pull from it
(
) man will usually find that if he drinks from a bottle, eventually, the bottle drinks from him
Hal does a
In the corner a darkened figure stands
Who are you
47
am the guide on your journey
Fate has chosen you to be it's champion
Pat Morita steps out from the shadows
Hal passes out again
We are close on Hal's face as his eyes flutter open
He appears to be lying on the couch
He hunches up on his elbows, looks around, but everything is as it seems
He lays his head back down
Thank God
It was a dream
Man, must be losing it
voice sounds right next to his ear
" " (
) You know you're out of orange juice
Hal leaps up to find he's been resting his head on Pat's lap
Jesus
This isn't happening, this isn't happening
Hal backs away and trips over a box
" " Calm
All things must be filtered through calmness
Bullshit
Sometimes it's best to freak out
" " think we must work on your attitude first
Look 'm gonna call the cops in about two seconds if you don't get out of here
48
Pat rises and walks to Hal
He's so calm it makes Hal calm
" " Are you calm now
Yeah, 'm okay
Pat slaps him across the face hard
" " Good, because we've got a lot of work to do
Hal grabs his jaw
What the hell was that for
" " Rule number one: expect the unexpected
Can you just tell me what this is all about
" " The heavens are not in the habit of bestowing a gift such as this to just anyone
You are being rewarded for being a man of great moral fortitude with an unwavering belief in humanity
That's me alright
" " am to train you so you may fulfill your destiny to defeat the great menace to Metro City: Master Mind
Pat gets up and walks toward the door
" " (') Come
We're are we going
49
" " To train
'  - Pat is sitting in the driver's seat
The car is bumping up and down
" " Strength is just as much in the mind as it is the muscle
Remember, both need to be exercised
We   to see Hal lifting the car up over his head
He's hardly straining
'
Pat leans on the
" " Hey, Corky
You listening
Two highly attractive female joggers run by
They're clearly impressed with Hal's show of strength
He smiles and mouths a "hello
" Yeah, work both muscles
- Pat cocks back the chamber of a
357
He holds it up and carefully takes aim
at Hal's chest
" " Trust me
What are you doing
" " An invulnerability test
Something wrong
Uh
yeah
would prefer not to get shot
Do not fire that thing
Frustrated, Pat lowers the gun
50
" " You're bulletproof
Okay, do you know that for sure
Pat quickly aims and fires
Hal lets out a high pitched scream as the bullet ricochets off his chest
" " do now
Hal looks down at his chest, not so much as a scratch
You suck
- Hal is in the air flying in a sitting position
He's weaving back and forth
Ice Man,  got a bogie on my tail
Two Russian Migs coming in hard and fast
" " Hey
What
Hal looks down to see Pat Morita yelling at him from the roof of a building down below
" " What did  tell you
Stomach down, hands up
Hal sighs and assumes the proper superhero in-flight position
God,  feel so gay
Pat's   begins to
He answers it
" " (in Master Mind voice) What is it
51
(
) John
Pat panics
He looks up to make sure no one is in earshot
He sees Hal now doing somersaults in the air
Pat turns his attention back to the phone, talking in his John Cusack voice
" " (in Cusack voice) Yes, it's John Cusack
(
) Hi, it's Roxanne
Listen, really enjoyed talking with you the other day
" " As did
(
) Great
God,  feel really silly, and if you have a lot going on totally understand
But,  was wondering if you maybe wanted to have lunch
He can't believe what he's hearing
" " (excited) 'd love to
He quickly recovers his composure
" " (') mean,   a little hungry
(
) Great
How does the park sound, around noon-ish
" " Sure
(
) Great, see you then
52
Pat hangs up the phone and returns it to his pocket as Hal lands behind him
Man, that is so cool
It's like fly - Oh my God,  almost said it was like flying
" " For the rest of the day  want you to continue to practice your flying posture
Why, where're ya going
" " To do something
mysterious and Asian
Say no more, bro
'll just keep at it, then
- John Cusack and Roxanne eat   while walking through Metro City Park
How's your sandwich
" " It's quite delicious
Hope you don't think 'm too forward
Some men are intimidated when a woman asks them out
just find you really easy to talk to
" " And  you
You know, you're not at all like you are in the movies
" " 'm not
53
Yeah
don't know - You have this strange, refined way of speaking
" " do
That is most interesting
Anyway, when we were talking the other day  just felt, even though we only talked for a couple of hours, that we've known each other for years
" " know just what you mean
Roxanne bites into her sandwich
You know what
This sandwich is disgusting
She tosses it in a nearby garbage can
(') Of course  already ate half of it
wonder what that says about my character
" " It means you don't give up on a sandwich
You see that it has potential, and you give it every chance to be all it can be
Roxanne smiles at his analogy
Thanks, but knowing me,  was probably projecting my expectations of what a lunch should be on the sandwich
It might have been okay at first, but  just made it bitter
John Cusack notices Roxanne's smile starting to fade
" " Is that what happened with your last sandwich -  mean, boyfriend
54
When  look back,  probably shouldn't of expected so much from him
He was already a giving person
You know, one of those go out and save the world types
" " 've run into a few
was selfish,  guess
didn't want to share him with anybody else
" " It sounds like he was a special man
They broke the mold
John Cusack arches his eyebrow in a very familiar manner
" " Perhaps not
- Hal walks up to Pat Morita sporting a Lone Ranger-type mask and wearing a purple and red superhero costume
It's not unlike Uberman's except for a giant "" on his chest
(From here on, Hal is referred to as ) What's the "" stand for
" " Titan
What's that supposed to mean
" " It's from Roman mythology
Zeus's father
oh, just go with it
You look perfect
don't think this mask is big enough
Are you sure no one is gonna recognize me
55
" " It's fine, just don't slouch
It's all in the posture
He grabs Titan's shoulders like a proud papa
" " (') It is time
- There is a long line of people snaked around the velvet ropes
They're all waiting for their chance at the one open teller window
Four men wearing  (,,, )and enter the bank
John fires a shot in the air, sending everyone into an immediate panic
Alright folks, this is a robbery
Nobody moves - yadda, yadda, yadda
Ringo jumps over the teller wall and starts stuffing bills into a bag
As John and Paul cover the crowd, George goes to the corner office and puts a gun to the  ' head
The safe
Let's go
Okay, just don't hurt anyone
Yeah, yeah, yeah
George leads him out by the collar
- Titan smashes through the window and lands in a bold superhero stance with hands on hips
Well, boys, there's no need for all this just to get the free toaster
Paul cocks his gun
56
What are you suppose to be
We move in for a nice dramatic close up
Justice
Well, justice, suck on this
George, John and Paul open fire on Titan
He just stands there and yawns as the bullets bounce off him
With their guns empty the three just stare at him in amazement
Now it's my turn
He turns to George
(') Hey, George, here comes the sun
Titan grabs George and throws him into a fluorescent light fixture in the ceiling
Paul tries to run for the door
Titan snatches the collar of his jacket
(') Say, Paul, your mother should know
that you're a scumbag
He tosses Paul out the window and into a parked Titan turns around just as John hits him with the butt of his shotgun
It instantly breaks apart in his hands
Titan lifts him like a rag doll up into the air
(') John, all you need is love
He throws John who lands on top of a cubical wall - (') and a good urologist
57
Titan effortlessly hops over the teller wall to find Ringo cowering on the floor
He grabs him by the shirt and lifts him up
Well, Ringo
um
um
you're under arrest
- Titan walks out of the bank with Ringo and George under his arm
He's suddenly swarmed by a group of television reporters, including Roxanne
Across the street is Pat Morita
He watches Titan's first news conference with great anxiety
(to Hal) On behalf of the First National Bank of Metro City, 'd like to offer you a reward for your act of bravery
He hands Titan a check
(reading) Ten thousand dollars
Titan looks over to Pat, who violently shakes his head no
(') (unenthusiastically) can't except this
Law and order is it's own
um
reward
Pat gives him the thumbs up
Pat turns, suddenly seeing Roxanne with her camera crew
Captivated, his eyes lock on her
Meanwhile, Roxanne and her cameraman, , are maneuvering around the crowd to get closer to Titan
(
) Not so fast, Roxanne
They both turn to see Roxanne's reporter rival Brad Helms, Geraldo without the class, and his cameraman,
This story's mine
58
Listen, Brad
We were just in the area
was just trying to - 've been in this business long enough to know pretty well what you were "just trying to do
" Besides, heard you couldn't take the big game anymore and were put on fluff detail
Dejected, Roxanne turns and motions for Seth to turn the camera off
You're not gonna take that from him, are you
He's right
Old habit,  guess
(to Brad) We'll get out of your way
As they walk off, Brad makes a comment to Frank loud enough for her to hear
Besides, 'm sure there's a pancake supper somewhere that needs covering
-  - We see the news conference on the bank's steps
In the corner of the screen is written: "recorded earlier
" For months now, since the death of Uberman, the citizens of Metro City have been holding out for a hero
Well, it appears they won't have to hold out for much longer as a new costumed crusader has suddenly stormed onto the scene
Today, at the Metro Savings and Trust, a masked mystery man single-handedly defeated "The Fab Four Gang
" Just who is this new caped avenger
Brad holds the microphone to Titan's face
59
'm sure all of our viewers are now wondering, what's the "" stand for
It's a message to all the scum out there
Uberman may be gone, but Metro City has a new protector, and his name is "Tighten
" Another reporter leans in
How do you spell that
We   to see Plato and Da Vinci watching this spectacle
Master Mind is sitting with them, reading a (reading paper) Oh, for heaven's sake
can't believe it
He misspelled his name
Master Mind holds up the newspaper
The headline reads "Metro's New Hero: Tighten
" (') No matter,  suppose
Master Mind throws the paper on the floor and begins to pace around the room with his arms folded behind his back
(') We've now fully established Titan as Metro City's hero
They will love him just as they loved Uberman
Everything is going according to plan
Einstein leans over and whispers in Plato's ear
(whispering) Yeah, if the plan is getting us in jail
Master Mind turns around, facing Einstein
He walks over, standing face to face with the rebellious henchmen
60
You know, Einstein, maybe  should have called you Socrates
He also didn't know when to keep his thoughts to himself
just fail to see the point in all of this
mean, why are we creating another superhero when it was such a pain in the ass for you to get rid of the other one mean, Uberman is destroyed, we should be using this opportunity to
to
To what
don't know
To take over the weather, space, the world - whatever super villains are to do
The reason someone like you will always be a minion is because you have no foresight
We take over the earth, like you said
Then what
Women
Cars
Money
Even the grandest treasures will lose their lustre if you don't have someone to hold them over
Einstein throws up his hands
He's had enough
He pulls off his wig and throws it to the floor
That's it
This balance of the force bullshit is getting way too Oprah for me
'm blowing
Who's with me
You dare
Yeah,  dare
'm sick of wearing stupid costumes, and 'm sick of working for a super villain who's turning into a softie
61
Plato and Da Vinci's mouths drop to the floor
They turn to Master Mind for his rebuttal
What - did - you - call me
You heard me
You used to be an inhuman monster, now look at you
You're creating super heroes, you don't go with us on robberies anymore, it's been days since you threatened anyone, oh, and not to mention this Roxanne Ritchi thing
is none of your business, knave
Hey, you guys haven't sealed the deal yet, have you
Silence
(In a woman's voice) Oh, Master, your head is so big
'm warning you, Einstein
(In a woman's voice) Take me
said silence
With his metal gauntlet Master Mind grabs Einstein by the throat and lifts him into the air
Einstein looks frightened as he tries to pry himself free of Master Mind's grip
Master Mind's eyes soften as if his heart is suddenly not into what he's about to do
He let's Einstein drop to the floor
(') Get out of my sight
62
- Roxanne and John Cusack are eating on the outside patio of a fancy restaurant
Don't get me wrong,  love being a reporter
don't think  could do anything else
It's the consequences of what we do that 'm having a problem with
He listens intently as he refills her glass with wine
" " That's where journalistic responsibility comes in, no
It's supposed to
" " Sounds to me like you're running from something
got someone  cared about killed
If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't have been involved
John suddenly gets a disturbed look in his eye, realizing what she's talking about
He reaches across the table and takes her hand
" " You can't blame yourself
My father used to say each of us must answer the great call to truly feel alive
Was he an actor
" " No
He was
a landscaper
And a horrible one
mean he would fail time and time again at his
landscaping
And sometimes he'd get pretty beaten up or thrown in jail - Jail
63
" " My point is he took the good with the bad
He grew a little each time
Improved, learned
Was he ever successful
" " God, no
but don't let deter you
Roxanne
Thanks for this
You know, this is embarrassing, but it's been a long time since  - It's starting to lightly sprinkle
Roxanne looks up
(') think it's starting to rain
We might want to find a table inside
" " What were you gonna say
Oh,  was gonna say
It's been a long time since
well, 've been with someone
enjoy being with
John Cusack smiles warmly and raises his glass for a toast
" " To people who enjoy being with each other
They go to clang glasses, when the rain suddenly causes John Cusack's disguise generator to short
His true form of Master Mind is briefly revealed to Roxanne as a    encircles his body
Roxanne drops her glass and jumps out of her seat
(') Oh, no
Don't look at me
the image keeps switching between 64
As Master Mind starts to franticly slap at his watch, the Cusack disguise begins to hold steady
He nonchalantly returns to cutting his steak
" " Okay, never mind that
Now, where were we
Roxanne grabs his glass and throws the drink in his face, causing the generator to short out permanently
Master Mind now sits in his true blue form
Oh my God
You're not gonna get all freaky about this, are you
This
this is too much, even for you
God,  go out with you, tell you my innermost thoughts
only did this because  wanted to talk to you on the same level
You know, without all the baggage
Baggage
You burned my boyfriend alive, you sick son-of-a-bitch
You see, that's exactly what 'm talking about
Roxanne starts to walk away
(') Roxanne
Stay away from me
Master Mind sinks back down to his chair
Despite the now heavy rain bombarding him, he returns to his food
Several resturaunt patron's are looking at him through the window
65
Our villain turns to them, giving them a villainous glare
What
'  - Master Mind is lying on his back, wide awake
(mumbling to himself) Stupid
What was  thinking
Plato, it's his fault
He's the one who sent me on this weak-willed path
'll filet his scrotum for this
Me, a creature of evil, in love with Roxanne Ritchi
Preposterous
hardly give such matters thought He rolls onto his side
He yawns and closes his eyes
Suddenly, they shoot back open
: '  - Master Mind pulls up in a blue Rolls Royce, across the street from Roxanne's apartment He stares up at the building, hoping to catch a glimpse of her
Finally, she appears, primping her hair in her apartment window's reflection
should just go up there and just lay it all out to her
"Roxanne, like you -  always have
Oh, and 'm sorry  blew up your ex
(realizing the absurdity of his words) Yeah, that would go over like a pants-less clown at a child's birthday party
What the hell am  even doing here
Who cares what she thinks
'm a supervillain and here  am acting like a love struck schoolboy
Forget this
control my own destiny
66
He turns the ignition key -
He repeats but gets the same results
(') (disgusted) Perfect
'  - She pulls a pack of smokes off her night stand
Empty
Damn
She grabs her long coat and throws it over her robe
' Roxanne steps outside
Please be open
Across the street is a liquor store
The light is still on
(') Thank God
She walks across the street, passing in front of Master Mind's car
Spotting her, he sinks down in his seat
Roxanne walks by, totally unaware of his presence
Relieved, Master Mind sits back up and watches her go into the store
- Roxanne walks up to an elderly Korean  at the counter
pack of Lady Strikes, please
'  - Master Mind is talking on his cell phone
Hello, Triple
67
He suddenly spots something across the street
- walks up to the entrance of the store and pulls out a gun from under his coat
'  - Master Mind stares in shock
'll call you back
He hangs up the phone and watches the Hoodlum go inside the store
- The Hoodlum reaches across the counter and grabs a fist full of cash from the register
Hey
Shut up, Gramps
He turns to Roxanne, spotting a   around her neck
(') Gimme that necklace
don't think so
The Hoodlum cocks his shotgun
said give it to me
(
) The lady said no
The hoodlum turns around to see Master Mind in the doorway holding a -   ( ) with knobs and blinking lights
The hoodlum starts to laugh
68
What the hell's that
super soaker
No, it's a goo gun
The hoodlum turns his gun to Master Mind
Yeah, what's it do
It goos
Master Mind fires the cannon
It instantly covers the store in a cloud of
The smoke clears to reveal the hoodlum    , covered in a thick,
Roxanne stares at him, dumbfounded
(') It's
a prototype
Master Mind starts to walk out when he's suddenly confronted by the shopkeeper
know you
You Master Brain guy
You a hero
Master Mind points the goo gun at him
Don't -  - say that again
- Master Mind walks out with the cannon resting on his shoulder like he's a short timer in Da Nang
Roxanne follows shortly behind him
Hey
Master Mind turns around
(') Are you following me or something
69
Don't flatter yourself
He turns away and continues walking
Roxanne runs in front of him blocking his way
Don't walk away from me when 'm talking to you
Finally it occurs to her what's going on
(') What a minute
all that stuff you use to say to me when Uberman was alive - about me being the loyal queen by your side as you rule over Metro City
That wasn't just super villain rhetoric, was it
You actually meant it
My, someone has a rather high opinion of themselves
They stare at each other in silence, their glares locked in conflict
(coldly) Do you really think  would be with someone like you
This stings Master Mind to the bone
And after a brief contemplation, he reaches the only logical, painful conclusion
No
With that, Master Mind exits into the night, leaving Roxanne with a baffled expression on her face
- Master Mind enters in a huff
Da Vinci closes the door behind him as Plato notices his master's agitated state
Everything alright, sir
Master Mind      with his metal gauntlet causing Plato's eyes to bulge in pain
70
(overly calm) Fine, why do you ask
You
just
seem
Master Mind tightens his grip
Go on
distracted
Master Mind releases him
Just with business, my minion
Just with business
've decided it is time
You mean
Yes, we've created our hero, now it's time to give him a little motivation
How do we do that
To be simply good is not enough hero must be driven by an almost relentless desire to right a wrong that can never be corrected
You mean
Yes, he must lose someone near and dear to him - his father figure
Gentlemen, it's time for Operation Mentor Kill
- Titan flies high over and through the city, under bridges, between buildings, etc
He's not really working, just enjoying himself
71
'  - sits at her makeup table wearing nothing but her bra and panties
Through the reflection in her mirror we see a large window directly behind her
As she applies lipstick we see Titan fly quickly by in the background
After a moment he slowly slides back in view and begins ogling the girl
She sees him in the mirror and quickly covers herself with a robe
Titan tries to hide his face as he zooms off
Titan looks down to see an
Emergency lights flash around it as swarms of people run around in chaos
Man, what the hell happened down there
Wait a sec - He stops in mid-air as he comes to the striking realization
(') '
'   - Titan lands in front of the rubble that was once his home
Reporters stand just beyond the police line
Crap
From the wreckage crawls a dying Pat Morita
(') Titan goes and kneels beside Pat, holding him in his arms
(') You okay
" " 'm dying, kid
There is just one last lesson  have for you
It is the most important of all
72
What's that
" " Master Mind did this, you must avenge me
Master Mind
Why
" " Because he's evil
You must stop the evil Hal - stop the
Pat's body goes limp
The cameras begin to pop and flash around them
Titan gently lays Pat's body down and stands respectfully over him
The reporters rush over
1 Tighten, Is this the work of Master Mind
2 How will the death of your mentor affect your resolve
3 Was that Pat Morita
Titan walks up to one of the cameras
This injustice will not go unpunished
Master Mind, if you can hear me, Tighten is coming for you
In the background we see Plato and Da Vinci, , load pat's body onto a stretcher
As he bends down to pick it back up, Pat quickly slaps him, then goes back to playing dead
- Master Mind and the boys prepare the fortress for Hal's revenge attack
Master Mind is as giddy as a schoolboy
73
Alright, people, we don't have much time
Titan should be here any minute, so let's get the lead out
There is a     in the middle of the hall being tinkered with by Da Vinci
(') How's the death ray coming
Nearly up to full power, sir
Hum
Let's turn it down a few notches
It's his first time and we don't want to get in a lucky shot, now do we
Plato enters the room
(') Anything on the radar yet
Not yet, sir
see
Well, he must be planning something big
Are the flame androids deployed
All twelve
Master Mind rubs his hands in anticipation as he sits down on his throne
Wonderful, wonderful
Plato, Da Vinci, take your places next to me
They move to either side of the chair
(') No slouching
Da Vinci straightens up and sucks in his gut
They remain this way for several long moments
Master Mind occasionally glances at a   on the wall
Still no Titan
74
Apparently quite some time has passed
The bold stances have degraded to fatigue
He's certainly taking his time
He'll be here
That's the way it works
Master Mind reclines in his chair and taps his metal gauntlet impatiently on the armrest
Plato has squatted down, resting his chin on his hand
(') Unprofessional, that's what this is
No, it's disrespect for the craft
Master Mind rises and begins to pace back and forth
(') Would Uberman have kept us waiting like this
Of course not
He was a pro who knew the score
It's time we spelled out a few things for this Titan
will not be made a fool of
He storms out of the room
'   - Titan's sitting on the floor in a barren apartment wearing his costume top and some tighty whities
He sips his beer as he watches a basketball game on a tiny
Much to his annoyance, there's a  at the door
Oh, for crying out loud
He gets up and opens the door
It's Master Mind
Do you know who  am
75
It takes a few moments to register, but Titan's suddenly excited
Yeah, you're Master Mind
Yeah
You're actually the guy  want to see
Oh, so  you want to get down to it
Well,  want to get a few things off my chest first
Master Mind walks past Titan into the apartment
He spins around, pointing at him accusingly with one of his metal fingers
(') Of all the inconsiderate - Do you have any idea how long we waited for you
We're you even planning on coming to me and getting revenge
Titan shuts the apartment door, and turns back toward his guest
Well, at first  was going to
You know, because that's what  figured was supposed to do
But then got to thinking- (interrupting) -You got to thinking
There's nothing to think about
'm the villain
do something bad, you come and get me
-  got to thinking
what's the point
Master Mind throws up his hands
Maybe you're right
What's the point
He suddenly notices something in the corner of his eye
He walks over to a futon in the living room
On top of it is a , 76
(') What are these
That's what  wanted to talk to you about
(baffled) Where did you get all this
(proudly) Get this:  stole them
From where
From all over
You see, once you killed Pat and ruined my other apartment building  was pretty pissed off, so  figured 'd go, find you and kick some ass
Then thought to myself: "Okay,then what
"  mean, if we were to fight, what would  get out of it
Would get my apartment back
Would  be able to pay the bills
Well, what about your mentor
Tell you the truth
He was kind of a dick
mean, being a hero is dandy and all, but it's volunteer work
Now you've always had the right take on all this
mean, when you rob a bank or take over the diamond exchange you get something out of it
mean, when you don't get caught, which, no offense, isn't very often
And that brings me to what  wanted to propose to you: Who could catch you if 'm by your side
Perplexed by his proposal, Master Mind just stares at Titan awe-struck
You want to team-up
77
You got the brains,  got the brawn
We could even call ourselves that: `Brain' and `Brawn'
Look at this
Titan picks up a piece of   off the floor and shows it to Master Mind
(') even designed us some new costumes
The picture is crudely drawn with magic markers and crayons
big headed man (Master Mind) is standing on a plate of grass in a blue costume with a picture of a brain on his chest
Next to him, is a picture of Titan in a red costume with a black cape, but his chest is mysteriously blank
Titan proudly points to the two figures
(') See, you'd be brain, so you got a little one on your costume, and then 'll have brawn on mine
once figure out the best, you know, visual interpretation of it
What do you think
What do  think
Master Mind shakes his head tiredly
(') think you're probably the biggest idiot 've ever met
mean, can't believe you
All your gifts, all your powers, and all you want to use them for is your own financial fulfillment
You know what
Your kind of people make me sick
Titan puts down his drawing
worked hard on this
Oh - gee -  am so sorry
78
Master Mind looks to Heaven in disgust
(') (under his breath) Of all the people to pick, it had to be this loser
This strikes a cord with Titan
Now, hold on
You're going a little too far
wish your mother said that to your father the night of your conception, they would have saved me a whole lot of heartache
Hey,  mean it
Master Mind gets right in his face
Oh, yeah
What are you gonna do
'   - We see Master Mind's body  through the building and land in a  across the street
car pulls up
The driver's door opens
Da Vinci gets out and runs to help his master
Master
(
) It hurts
Da Vinci peeks into the dumpster to see Master Mind's body cushioned by a stack of trash bags
What hurts
It
The overly large henchmen starts to pull his master from the dumpster when they suddenly hear a voice from above
It's Titan peeking through the hole in his apartment wall
79
don't need you,  don't need anybody
have the power to do and take anything  want
And now, 'm gonna take back everything this city owes me
Beware Metro City, it's time for Titan to collect
Titan shoots up into the air
(') Oh, and from now on - ' He takes a sitting position and flies away as if he were piloting an invisible jet
Master Mind climbs out of the dumpster and watches Titan disappear into the distance
How'd the plan go, boss
just made myself redundant, old friend
Da Vinci gives Master Mind a whiff
It's not that bad
- Titan, with a happy bounce in his step, enters the bank
The last time he was here he thwarted a robbery
He looks nostalgic
shyly walks up to him like a kid meeting his idol
Morning, Tighten
Morning
Is there something we can do for you
80
Oh, don't bother about me
'm just here to make a withdrawal
Titan walks across the lobby, drawing stares of admiration from all
little girl waves to him sweetly
He gives her a good- natured  as he heads straight for the vault
The security guard watches him enter and come out with a Sure he must be misunderstanding what's going on, the security guard just stares at Titan as he passes by and out the door
The bank manager comes over to the guard
Say, did he just rob us
Not sure
Sort of looks it, don't it
Yeah
Should , you know, stop him
Umm
Yeah
As the security guard exits the bank, the manager stares out the window
His eyes suddenly grow wide with terror
The guard's body suddenly smashes through the window, landing at the startled bank manager's feet
(') (looking down at the guard) He did rob us, didn't he

"Absolute power corrupts absolutely
" When Lord Acton stated that, in a letter to Bishop Mandell Creighton in 1887, no one thought much about it, but today Metro City is reeling from that very prophecy
Tighten, who many thought of as our savior, has turned his back on the cause of justice
: - - Titan flies through the window of the building
He emerges seconds later laughing with his shirt full of booty
- woman screams from the window of a
Titan flies up to her, grabs her fur coat and zooms off again, leaving the woman behind, slightly confused
- Titan steals a little boy's lollipop and gooses his mother
- Dozens of people run through the streets apparently to get out of a downpour
We cut to the top of a building and see Titan     and laughing
- Master Mind paces back and forth in front of Plato and Da Vinci
don't understand it
He seemed to have every characteristic we were looking for in a superhero
Well, there's no use crying about it now, we must take action
'm not going to play second fiddle to that crass buffoon
We must destroy Tighten
82
It won't be easy
Uberman had a sense of decency and genuine love for the people
That was his weakness and was easily used against him
Yes, but he possesses the same flaws present in Uberman's  - copper
It's like Benjamin Franklin always said: "If something works don't dick with it
" - It looks like a war zone passed through here
Smashed police cars and debris lay everywhere
This seems to be the only building left untouched
- very tipsy Titan is sitting at the bar, looking deep into the bottom of his beer glass for answers
can have anything  want
'm like a god
The  just listens as he wipes down a glass with a dirty rag
Point to any woman in this bar could have her in a second
He follows the bartender's gaze to -  passed out,
(to Old Barfly) Hey, you wanna get with this
Buddy, what do you want
Titan carefully considers this for a moment
What do you want
That's the question, isn't it
mean, what do you want when you can have everything
() 83
(cont'd) suppose what  really want is to never be forgotten again
want to do something that can never be cast aside or one-upped
want a - what's it called
-  legacy want a legacy
Yeah, that's it like the sound that
meant, what do you want to drink
Oh
- Titan stumbles out of the bar, carrying a large sack of money
(
) Your time has come to an end, Titan
He looks up to see Master Mind suddenly standing before him
What
There can be only one master criminal in this city - and it's me
Really
Titan melodramatically throws up his arms
(') guess  should leave town then, huh
have a better idea -
Two floors up Da Vinci releases a rope
, like the one that caged Uberman, drops down on top of Titan
Titan nonchalantly surveys the cage
He walks to the bars, tries to pull them apart but can't
(') That's copper my good man
Your one weakness
() 84
(cont'd) For all your amazing gifts of brawn you are no match for my intellect
Titan thinks for a moment
Suddenly, he starts to  like a human top,
As he disappears beneath the surface, we see a shocked look on Master Mind's face until Titan suddenly explodes out from under the street in front of him
Master Mind stares up at him, dumbfounded
Titan makes like he's going to strike him down, but stops
You know what
You're nothing but a bug
Not even worth my effort
He turns his back to Master Mind and continues down the street
Plato makes his way from the shadows to join his master
They watch Titan shrink into the distance
He's not as dumb as  thought
guess not
Funny, though
What's funny
Funny Uberman didn't think of the same thing
- As Titan flies, he looks down at the rooftops of the city below
Suddenly, something catches his attention
That's it
He stops, hovering in place as he looks down below
The buildings, which make up the heart of downtown Metro, are in a   with a long strip of street leading up to it
It sorta looks like a bowling lane
85
Hello, Legacy
- Vinnie and his goons come running out as the hear a They look up to see Titan ripping off from the top of the establishment
Hey, that's my ball
'   - Roxanne enters the building's elevator
Just before the door closes an   slides in
That was a close one
Sixth floor, please
Roxanne smiles and goes to press the button
The elderly woman suddenly pulls out a  , shooting a -  into Roxanne's face
She falls to the floor unconscious
'  - Roxanne awakens, finding herself tied to a chair in her living room
We hear  from a  in the background as she tries to adjust her vision
Slowly, the blurry figure before her becomes clear
It's Master Mind
He sits on her Lazy-Boy, reading what looks to be some kind of
Wow,  always thought Uberman was your first superhero - but it looks like our little Roxanne dated a linebacker in college
That's my diary
So it is
86
It's personal
Well, then  wouldn't leave it in your underwear drawer for just anyone to find
He throws the diary over his shoulder
What do you want
need your help
So you knock me out and tie me to a chair
You're not going to like what 'm about to tell you
As she tries to shake off her headache from being knocked unconscious, Roxanne spots something on the
Brad Helms is huddled behind a van
It's chaos here in city square as city police - Behind him, Titan picks up a   and throws it at a Both vehicles  on impact
He's really out of control
Tell me about it
As if finally realizing something, Roxanne looks back at Master Mind
should have known
You have something to do with this, don't you
- With Titan turning evil
87
Well, the evil thing he did by himself
My goal was to give purpose by creating an intellectual sparring partner
(confused) You're talking like you made him
And they call me Master Mind
Let me get this straight
You missed getting your ass kicked, so you made a new guy to kick your ass
That's pathetic
In hindsight
Roxanne turns back to the  to see a group of open fire on Titan
The bullets just deflect off his chest
And his powers, they're just like Uberman's
Why would he have his powers
(almost ashamed) had some left over from something
infused him with it
Driven by rage, she struggles to tear out of her bonds
She finally relents, giving Master Mind a look fueled by pure hatred
Yeah, that's why  decided to tie you up
You did all this because you wanted purpose
He seemed nice
88
Titan is standing on top of a destroyed police car
He waves for the camera to zoom in on him
Closer
want to show the people my real face
He pulls off his mask, revealing himself as Hal Stewart to the public for the first time
(') Recognize me
Hal Stewart
He's the guy we thought saved that woman and kid
Turned out he was just trying to save his own ass
Yeah, good to know -
Titan throws the mask over this shoulder and hops off the car
That's right, 'm really Hal Stewart
Former hero and bowling teacher at Kingpin's Bowling
Roxanne turns to Master Mind, condescending him with her eyes
You picked a bowler to give super powers to
It's a modest profession
89
With my new found power, 've recently started to wonder what sort of legacy  should leave
Should  be a hero
tried that once before - even saved a lady and her baby from being squashed
was treated like a god until everyone started to shit on me - Okay, so what if  didn't "purposely" save them
He walks over and puts his hand on a large circular concrete shape just off camera
Well, 'm going to make something that can't be taken away from me
'm going to create a permanent monument to my greatness
One that won't be so easily forgotten or erased
The camera pulls back revealing from Kingpin's
intend to create a new category in the Guinness Book of World's Records by rolling the biggest strike in the history of bowling
He grabs the camera and points it to the
We realize they are My thanks to the city planning commission
This wouldn't have been possible without them
Titan grabs the camera so it's pointing back at him again
Tell your friends and family to tune in right here to this station at noon tomorrow
My god, he's nuts
That'll destroy the whole business triangle
90
Master Mind seems to be contemplating something - something bad
What
My lair is in the direct path of the ball
Oh, real nice
Wouldn't want anything to happen to your hideout, would we
You don't understand
have certain equipment that's - that's highly unstable
What do you mean
sort of have a hydrogen reactor, okay
reactor
It's experimental - only one in the world
Well, how do you think power all my inventions
Someone like me can't pay for electricity
The bills would be outrageous
It creates 100 times the output of a nuclear one
If destroyed it could
- Vaporize the entire city
(proudly) Pshaw
the whole eastern seaboard, actually
That little baby is amazing
'm quite proud of it
() 91
(cont'd) (off her deadpan reaction) mean
we'd better find a way to stop him
Master Mind thinks a moment
Did Uberman have a hideout
What
cave, a solitary fortress of some kind
'mon, all heros have a place to hang their capes up in
Roxanne, it may be our only chance to find something, a clue, anything that could give us a fighting chance
It's under his house
Whose house
Roxanne can hardly believe what she's telling him
Wayne Scott's
Master Mind shoots up out of his chair
Wayne Scott
Uberman was Wayne Scott
Wayne Scott, the wealthy philanthropist
But he disappeared - (interrupting) He disappeared just over two months ago when you killed him
Not only did you rid the world of a hero, you killed a kind, noble, generous man
Perhaps ashamed, the super villain hangs his head
Master Mind walks behind Roxanne and undoes her bonds
Rubbing her wrists, she watches him as he walks over to the door
92
(') Looks like you got what you always wanted
Uberman is out of the picture and Metro City is doomed
He grabs the door knob and stops, considering her words
"Metro City doomed
" You know, never thought 'd say something like this, but here it goes - He slowly turns to her,
(') Not if  have anything to say about it
'  - Master Mind stands before the huge, Gothic structure in awe
Such a dark place for one such as you
wonder, underneath your noble deeds, what inner demons drove you to your endless crusade for justice
He walks to the front entrance
The double doors have been sealed shut with boards and nails
Master Mind begins to tear them off with his metal hand
'  - The doors opens
beam of moonlight immediately pierces the darkness, forming an illuminated path into the heart of the manor
Master Mind enters
Covered in dust and cobwebs, the hall looks like a gigantic crypt
Good lord, man
You've only been dead for two months
Master Mind walks, coming to a gigantic painted He stops to reverently admire the image of his fallen foe
93
(') disguise so simple, it's ingenious
No wonder  never caught on
Besides the Armani suit, there's nothing to hide the fact that this is the same person as Uberman
In the picture, he's even standing in the same cheesy, heroic pose with his fists on his hips
(') Two lives, yet in both you were an ideal
Perhaps it was you who was victorious in the end, old friend
sound suddenly bellows through the dark halls
Master Mind comes to a grandfather clock standing next to a gigantic
On the twelfth bong it falls silent
Master Mind begins to slide it across the floor until he hears a loud
The bookcase slides into the wall, (') 'll miss how predictable you were
The passage way leads Master Mind to a
Master Mind gets off the escalator to see a long hallway with stone walls
He begins to hear strange , almost like , coming from a doorway at the end of the hallway
Master Mind starts walking towards it
As he steps closer, he begins to notice a light cracking through the bottom of the door
(') Hello
Anyone here
besides
all the   who are with me now
Nothing
(') (to himself) What's the worst you're gonna find
() 94
(cont'd) The man was a boy scout, not a serial killer
He opens the door to his immediate amazement
It's some kind of screening room
shoots an image onto     hanging on the wall litter the floor; a table in front of a ripped-up couch is covered in discarded snack goods; and a Kiss Pinball machine stands in the far corner next to a
Master Mind turns his attention to the action on the screen
woman dressed in a leather   is whipping an overweight man lying on a swing-like device with his butt sticking out
She whips him three times
The man  out in pain
Master Mind's eyes are transfixed on the disturbing imagery
The door by the pinball machine suddenly swings open
, dressed in raggedy sweats, steps into the room carrying a    and a bowl of -
Master Mind cannot believe his horrified eyes
Ahhhhhh
Wayne Scott is just as startled
Jesus
He drop his drink and snack to the floor
The two men stare at each other as they struggle to regain their normal breathing patterns
Wayne Scott walks over to the couch, brushes off a thick layer of chip crumbs, and sits down
(') What the hell are you doing here
95
might just ask you the same question
had thought incinerated you
You scared the bejesus out of me
How'd you figure out  was still alive
Wait, how do you know my identity
Roxanne told me
As for your ruse, forgot to line the bottom of the copper cage - Somebody pointed that out to me recently
Figured if they could do it, so could you
But one thing  couldn't figure out - The skeleton
Something "borrowed" from a medical school a few months before
few months
How long had you been planning this
always planned to retire - eventually
mean, come on, you can't do this sort of thing in your fifties
You'd just look ridiculous
The pieces of the puzzle appear to be coming together in Master Mind's head
see it all so clearly now
'  - Master Mind and his minions cover their eyes as the observatory explodes
(' -
) You must have done it just seconds before the observatory exploded
96
- Similar to what Titan did, Uberman bores out from under the cage
(' -
) You bore out from under the cage
Then, using your Uber-Speed, - - Running in a blur-like haze, Uberman screeches to a halt in front of some bushes
(' -
) - you made your way to safety, where you had the skeleton safely hidden away somewhere
-  - Uberman soars high above the clouds
He looks down at the observatory, which is a mere speck in the distance
(' -
) (') Then you must have flown to a safe distance and waited for the explosion, then
Just as the observatory explodes Uberman aims and throws the like a javelin
It soars through the air like a missile, tearing through the flames of the explosion, and crashing right into the windshield of Master Mind's hydrofoil
Wayne stares at Master Mind, clearly impressed
Man, you  smart
But why fake your death
Why go through all of it
You could have just quit
But the responsibility would still be there
() 97
(cont'd) cop can retire and stop handing out speeding tickets - but people expect more from superheroes tell you, a volcano couldn't erupt in Zimbabwe without everyone expecting me to do something about it
figured, out of sight, out of mind
And Wayne Scott
Why did he have to disappear
Both of my lives have so much baggage
It's time for new baggage, you know
Master Mind's is absolutely flabbergasted
just can't believe it
This whole time you've been in hiding while a force of great evil is tearing your city apart
Wayne rises to his feet, waving his hands for Master Mind to say no more
don't want to hear about it
That's why  don't have a television in here to remind me of all the things   be doing
Hell,  could get a wife to do that
There's a demented supervillain out there about to destroy our - mean, your city
Wayne shrugs indifferently
You're really going to do nothing
Good and evil have a way of balancing themselves out
If this guy is as bad as you say, somebody will rise up to fight him
It's just the order of things
You found me, didn't you
98
Wayne puts a condescending hand on Master Mind's shoulder
(') know it's hard, but you'll find someone else someday
He then starts walking to the door
You're the only one who can stop him
Wayne turns around
Couldn't if  wanted to
Gotta a plane to catch
plane
Going to Barbados for a little change in climate
Now, if you'll excuse me,  got to go pack
He reads the still defeated look on Master Mind's face
(') You were a good foe
'm sorry if 've let you down
If it makes a difference, you were the best foe a hero could ask for
Not smart enough to come up with a full-proof trap
Well, you did almost have me when you figured out my weakness was copper
Now that made me sweat a little
Took me way too long to drill out from under that cage
got lucky
Anyway, it's a good thing for my sake that  could always count on you for an out
99
(suddenly confused) What do you mean
'mon, we always threw each other a couple of bones
You would always leave me an out in one of your `full-proof' traps, and 'd never had you incarcerated at a penitentiary that you couldn't eventually escape from
It kept our little game going
Master Mind seems deflated
Game
- Was that all this ever was to you
You know,  was trying my best every time  fought you
Those `outs' as you call them were unintentional
Oh
guess  was never really a match for you, was
Wayne shrugs
(') (thoughtfully) Then how can  expect to be one for Titan
beaten man, Master Mind heads for the door, but stops and turns around
(') What about Roxanne
Wayne unleashes an exhausted sigh
think we both got what we wanted out of our relationship
She got a career out of me, and  got plenty of other things out of her
But 'm ready to move on to greener pastures

Master Mind's steel hand clinches into a fist at his side
Wayne's oblivious to this
guess  wasn't the villain thought  was, and you
you weren't the hero  thought you were
He turns to make his exit when he suddenly sees Wayne is almost at a loss for words
Roxanne
How long have you been
Long enough
Roxanne looks at Master Mind
(') Don't you have something else you can go do
Master Mind leaves Roxanne and Wayne facing each other in silence
- Titan emerges with Brad and Frank
He's holding a and a bag of
Alright,  want this whole thing to look  professional, understand
distant   can be heard
The noise rises, signaling the approach of something powerful
Titan and his crew walk out to the center of the plaza as the sound becomes almost deafening
as it moves over the street
We   to see a whole line of  rolling along the street
From the five streets branching off the plaza, a dozen tanks roll toward Titan
101
Titan turns to Brad and Frank
(') You guys are about to get some good footage
might need a little room, though
Brad and Frank look at each other and run to take cover behind a nearby building
Meanwhile, Titan nonchalantly sips from his beer as the tanks begin to surround them
belts out of one of the tank's loudspeaker's, causing Titan to do a mock wince
Titan, we have orders from the city of Metro to take you into custody
If you do not give your self up willingly, we will be forced to open fire
There's a long pause as no one says anything
What is your answer
Titan takes a sip of his beverage and - The shockwave of which sends several of the tanks flying into a nearby building
Two of the remaining tanks close in on the villain
Both have him dead to rights at point-blank range with their massive guns
Titan sets down his beer, then calmly plugs a fist into each barrel
They
The where they  into nearby buildings
Titan bends down and pick his beet back up
(to beer) Miss me
Titan is suddenly bombarded by a massive barrage of machine- gun fire
The force sends him flying into the windshield of a nearby car
102
He looks up to see an
It's nose- mounted - is turning toward him
Titan gets up to his feet and looks down at his beer can
The bottom of it was blown apart in the blast
(') Didn't mean to get you involved in all of this
He stared daggers up at the helicopter pilot just as the gun gets a bead on him
(') Hey, man
You killed my suds
Titan throws the can up and slaps it with the palm of his hand
It flies with so much force it knocks the helicopter blade clean off
The rest of the Apache crashes to the street like a car dropped off a building
(') That's one was for you, beer
Titan salutes the wreckage and walks away to find Brad and Frank still hiding behind the building
Guys, please tell me you got that last bit
Huh
You're kidding me
give you my sexiest moves and you mean to tell me it was for nothing
We were afraid something might hit us
Looks like 've given the story of the century to the wrong man
He thinks about this for a moment, then it hits him
103
Wait
What about that other reporter
Blond
Not so lumpy on the topper half, but killer legs
Roxanne
You want Roxanne
She's a much better reporter than  am
You want her
Where can  find her
We're actually not supposed to give out that sort of information
1314 Mockingbird Lane
believe she lives in a penthouse
You've been very helpful
He tosses Brad over his shoulder like a discarded ice cream cone
In the faint distance we see him splash down in the middle of the Metro City river
- Master Mind, pacing anxiously as Plato and Da Vinci pack boxes
Obviously Master Mind is going on the lamb
Hurry, we must be on our way as soon as possible
Master, why must we flee
told you, Titan is too powerful
If he's set on destroying us, there's precious little we could do about it
Where are we going
104
To another city, someplace with a shitload of superheroes to fight
We'll start over, we'll go back to doing what we do best
With our tails between our legs
The old Master Mind would never have let this comment slip by, but as we have seen, he's not the same man
Plato, do you have a better plan
Master Mind's cell phone rings
He turns in shame from his men and answers it
(') Hello
Roxanne
' Roxanne paces back and forth on the phone
What are you going to do about Tighten
between Master Mind and Roxanne on phone
Right now 'm packing, later 'll have a snack on the train
You're running away
In a word - yes
You created this monster
didn't create this - the god's of irony did and  am eating the crow so richly deserve
There's no time for self pity
105
'll make the time
Roxanne can't believe what she's hearing
(') You can leave with us
You'll be safe
'm not going anywhere
Will you listen to me, no one can stop him
You have to try
The city needs your help
'm afraid you have an inflated opinion of me
What the hell's happened to you
The Master Mind  knew would never have run from a fight even though he knew deep in his heart that he didn't have a chance in hell of winning it
It was your best quality
You need to be that man right now
What
(heart felt) believe in you
Master Mind is taken aback, in a good way
But he catches himself before the words swell his heart
Sweet words, but that man is dead
Please, Roxanne, just come with me
No
guess you are a coward after all
Suddenly, there's a loud crash
106
Roxanne looks up to see a huge hunk of her ceiling has been completely ripped off
Titan is flying above, holding the debris as casually as if it were a paper plate at a barbecue
He looks down at her and smiles
Man, have  got a story for you
Master Mind can hears Titan's familiar laugh from his side of the line
Roxanne
Roxanne
- Titan is standing in front of the bowling alley, trying to decide on an appropriate pose for the occasion
What pose would be best
The corny folded arms thing
He demonstrates, arching his chin proudly in the air
Or maybe on the hips, like this
It's the classic Superman pose, only not as masculine
No, makes me look like a flamer pirate
As Titan starts to fix his hair in the window, Frank pretends to fix the lens on his camera as he speaks to Roxanne
(whispering) Shouldn't we be making a run for it right about now
(whispering) The guy can outrun bullets
don't think either one of us is in that kind of shape
She's right, Frank
107
Frank looks up, stunned that Titan could have possibly heard him
Also got super hearing
promise not to keep the both of you long, but you'll thank me when this is all over
Frank and Roxanne exchange helpless expressions
- Master Mind reverently stares up at the painted portrait of his father
Dad, it's me
(he looks around to make sure no one can hear) Bubsy
know we haven't talked in a while, and 'm sorry
It's been a little crazy trying to live up to a legacy
The painting's menacing stare seems to reach into his very soul
Anyway
You raised me to be the worst that  could possibly be
And 've tried to live up to that as best as  could - even dropping out of dentistry school like you wanted me to
But 'm about to do something now that would really piss you off
'm going to go against everything you ever taught me
hope
hope that maybe you'll look down at what 'm about to do as not so much a good deed, but more like the outright defiance of a hateful and ungrateful, son
If you could do that, then maybe - in your own little way - you could - for probably the first time - find a reason to be proud of me
He looks back up at the picture
Is it our imagination, or does the painting's stare suddenly seem even angrier
108
Well
either way, you're probably going to see me real soon
(calling over his shoulder) Men
Plato and Da Vinci suddenly stop what they're doing and look up at him
Yes Sir
Stop packing
Our work is not finished here
news report shows an aerial shot of Titan setting the giant ball down in the middle of a vacant city street
We interrupt your regular afternoon programming to show you live footage of a potential dangerous situation in downtown Metro
The former hero knows as Titan is placing what appears to be a giant ball
- Da Vinci stops in front of a television set, seeing the news report in progress
Hold on
It appears our own Roxanne Ritchi is somehow at the scene
We now go to her with a live report
Sir,  think you should see this
: 109
- Roxanne is standing in front of a camera with a mike in her hand
'm here with the cause of the destruction in Metro City
He has kidnapped me and a cameraman to chronicle what he refers to as the creation of a monument to his invincibility and overall "Asskickiness
" He will use this giant concrete bowling ball to play the largest game of bowling ever using the buildings of downtown Metro City as his pins
Titan suddenly steps into the shot
And 'm going for the biggest strike ever
He leans into the camera
And you, Metro City, have a ringside seat as  cement my name in the anal of history
Annals
What
Nevermind
- Titan holds up the massive bowling ball, lining up his shot
(in quiet professional bowler announcer voice) Like Tiger before him, a young savior has come to raise a sport from the ashes
Rookie Hal Stewart, a young man with a dream, realizing that dream here today, folks
() 110
(cont'd) One might click there heels and say "There's no place like home" upon finding themselves in such a fantasy
Well, Hal looks very much at home right were he is - with a ball in hand and glory in his sights
- In the bowels of Master Mind's hideout, the glows and
Roxanne just stand helpless as Frank films away
Hal,  know everyone treated you like shit, but you don't have to do this
You're right
don't  to do anything
Isn't that cool
Titan lines up his shot
Here's one for the record books
Titan flies a few feet and rolls the ball down the main street
Her face is utter horror as she watches the inevitable destruction of Metro City
As the ball rolls - it demolishes everything in it's wake; cars, street lamps - windows shatter as the giant concrete sphere brushes along side buildings
He smiles in anticipation and uses "body English" to direct the ball
It's nearly halfway to its target
111
She closes her eyes
Titan's smile fades
He looks around as if he hears something we don't
About two hundred feet in front of the first building a flies across the path of the ball, creating a defensive barrier
An enormous letter "" is etched in the web's center
(') What the
The ball breaks through the web, but it's speed is greatly reduced
Look, what's that flying in the air
We suddenly see He quickly pulls out his goo gun and starts laying down a path of sticky plasm to stop the destructive sphere's path
'mon, slow down Master Mind looks down to see the meter of the gun close to empty
'mon
The ball slows drastically then starts rolling to the side
It heads off an embankment and rolls harmlessly into a
Gutterball
He's furious to say the least
Master Mind gives him a mocking grin
Bowling
What other trailer park sports can you play
112
You are becoming a real pain in my ass
should have done this a long time ago
Titan lunges at his tormentor
Master Mind hits the on his jet pack and heads back toward the other side of the city with Titan in hot pursuit
(') (into walkie   talkie) Plato, Da Vinci
Secure Roxanne, he's falling for   it
flustered Titan lands
He begins searching the city streets, but Master Mind is nowhere in sight
He turns upon hearing an  sound to his left
Sitting on the ground is a  wearing a strange collar
It smiles at him
What the hell
From behind, Titan is immediately set upon by five more (') The critters bite hop and hit Titan
As soon as he throws one off two more jump him
Titan breaks free and with his mighty breath blows them across the street into a fruit stand
With Titan out of their sight they begin to attack the fruit
He's a block away frantically hitting his remote
Shit
Stupid monkeys and their fruit
Titan flies away from the mad monkeys and lands to find Master Mind sitting on the ground wrapped in a long cape with only his head sticking out
113
(') No more games
Titan       's
Master Mind pulls the cloak away to reveal a
Titan's   burn through the hydrant releasing a high pressure stream of water
Master Mind uses the last remote which dumps two tons of mix into the truck
The crowd, police and news crews move in closer when Titan doesn't emerge
Master Mind drops his last remote and walks toward the truck cautiously
Could it really be that easy-- -  - The back of the truck explodes, throwing dust and concrete everywhere
When the dust clears we see and enraged Titan
(') Didn't think so
As the villain walks toward him, he pulls back his fist to give Master Mind the killing blow
If you don't mind, 'm going to punch trough your face now
Preparing himself for the end, Master Mind shuts his eyes as a
Titan goes to strike, a Stunned, Master Mind begins to feel around his body as if to make sure everything's still in place
'm alive
He turns to see  standing next to him
Uberman
114
The terrified bystanders start to notice the figure standing next to Master Mind
1 It's Uberman
2 Uberman's alive
3 We're saved
As the  ,  confused Master Mind turns to Metro City's newly resurrected champion
thought
So did
He puts a hand on Master Mind's shoulder
Thank you, old enemy
For what
Showing me the error of my ways, Showing me 'm meant to be this city's savior, showing me that, while we can try, there is no running away from our true destiny
With that,       , Master Mind turns to see Titan smiling with his Oh
Did  interrupt something
Master Mind turns to run, but, suddenly Titan is before him
Where you going, buddy
Titan grabs Master Mind by the collar and throws him across the street into a parked car
115
(') Welcome to Paintown
Population: you
Master Mind manages to stand on shaky legs
He seems in a daze, unable to move
Titan flies up in the air
(') Time to finish this
With his fist front and center, Titan speeds toward Master Mind
He's like a human torpedo, coming in for the killing blow
Master Mind comes to his senses and puts up his hands
Titan screeches to a halt and stops just in front of him like an old Warner Bros cartoon
What
Quick joke - What's the capital of Thailand
Huh -  don't know
It's bang cock
In a sudden surge of strength, The once mighty man instantly drops to his knees, searching, with tears in his eyes, for the proper word to express the pain suddenly surging through his member
(') Ow
Baffled, he looks up at Master Mind's hand and sees his gauntlet is now made
So,  guess pennies are good for something
116
He punches Titan in the face, knocking him out cold
Master Mind looks down on Titan with more than a little pride
Suddenly he hears something behind him
He spins to see the crowd making a strange noise -
Roxanne comes up to him
The crowd starts to go wild and cheers for Master Mind
He's not sure what to make of it
Pretty strange, huh
They're cheering for me
You saved them
You saved everybody
How's it feel
Master Mind looks at the smiles all around him
He begins to well up a little
It's a
it's nice, you know usually don't get a lot of feedback
(whispering) But  also kind of caused all this
What happens when they find that out  was the cause of some of this
Roxanne looks at the cheering crowd, then back at Master Mind
What they don't know won't hurt them
guess that is all in the past
You're the hero
don't think 'd go that far mean  just
er
Master Mind
117
Yes
Stop talking
She kisses him
The crowd erupts in a cheer
The channel 7 he channel 7 logo zooms in followed by the title "Eye on Metro City
" picture of Master Mind smiling appears on the screen behind her
Who's bad
Well, not Master Mind
It seems the former villain has done a career 180 after defeating Tighten and saving Metro City from certain enslavement
And here he is getting a full pardon by Metro City's Mayor, Steve Dent
Cut to ceremony on capital steps
The  is shaking Master Mind's metal gauntlet when it suddenly Ahhh
Secret service men quickly start to draw their weapons and take aim at Master Mind
Realizing what's happening, he quickly lets the mayor's hand go and puts his arms in the air
Sorry - Metal hand
Force of habit
He elbows the mayor
(') We're okay, right
Wincing, the mayor signals the men to put their guns down
to video of Titan behind bars in a regular prison
118
And what about Tighten
Is there a prison in existence that can hold this super powered menace
Well, the answer we found is no
man in a white lab coat stands in front of Titan's cell just out of reach
Of course normally he could break out of there anytime, but as you can see we've taken some special precautions
The news camera pans over see Titan in his cell wearing a copper   with electrical cables hooked to it
Back to Samantha at the desk
What is a Hero
It seems never has that question needed to be asked more than it does tonight
We go to our very own Roxanne Ritchi, making her triumphant return to our news desk for the answer
Brad turns
The camera pans over to Roxanne who we now see has been sitting beside him
What is a hero
Well, there are many different kinds
There are those who hear a call, like the policeman or doctor, then there's the kind the public creates in their search for meaning and hope
Then, there are those who have the courage to change
- woman is being chased by two large thugs
They're gaining on her
She comes to a brick wall - a dead end
The thugs laugh
#1 Hey, gimme that purse
119
(
) don't think it would go with your outfit
The thugs turn around to see Master Mind, standing with his arms folded across his chest
#2 It's Master Mind
Thug #1 draws a knife
#1 So
It's not like he has any superpowers
Thug #1 puts his fingers to his mouth and whistles
Suddenly two more Thugs appear behind Master Mind
'm gonna give you a chance to surrender
#1 Four against one
For a Master Mind, you're really bad at math
Master Mind throws a hand signal up in the air
Suddenly a giant robotic foot crashes down on the two men behind him
Thug #1 and Thug #2 drop their knives and raise their hands in the air
Master Mind looks up and waves
Way to take out those two goons, guys
We see Da Vinci and Plato at the wheel of a gigantic robot
What two goons
The giant robot lifts its foot to check the bottom of it's sole
It     in the process
The woman looks at Master Mind, horrified
120
(apologetically) Sorry, we're new at this
