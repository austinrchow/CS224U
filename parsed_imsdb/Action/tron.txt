0222 Fourth Draft Screenplay by Charlie Haas April 6, 1981 1                                               1 On one side of the screen, computer programming language is being printed, and we  the sound of an electronic keyboard
In the center of the screen, glowing lines inscribe a rough computer simulation of a figure, in response to the programming
Gradually the figure is completed and refined, as we  a resonant voice speaking
As astonishing advances in computer science are made, artificial intelligence programs are being designed to assist us in every area of life
We see that the completed form is man-like, heroic and muscular, wearing a form of flexible armor
The face is calm, handsome and intelligent
As the voice continues, the form becomes rounded by the computer until it appears three dimensional and begins to rotate
(
) In a world-wide network of electronics, they travel through miles of circuitry at the speed of light
We created them to calculate and research, to help us design and heal and think
With all that they can do, are they only electrical impulses
or are they a new form of life
The figure is rotated completely around, and as it comes back to face us, a glowing disk appears beside it; again in response to the programming printed out at the side of the screen
The disk moves towards the man-like figure and is rotated into position above it
As the voice reaches the final word, the disk is slammed into place on the back of the figure
There is an explosion of colored light, a resounding crash of  and the title appears across the top of the screen in huge letters
The   as the glow fades and we  that the figure has become real, a living being, although filled with glowing light, as if it had an inner core of electricity
The following is a     in   as the The montage takes place in two worlds, the and the
The Electronic World is a mirror of our own, consisting of the electronic information in our computers, television sets and telecommunications network
It is peopled by computer programs, data, and the characters from countless video games
For the first time, we are seeing their world as it really is, rather than through the window of television screens
: 2                                                        2 standing on a glowing grid against a dark background
Each holds a bar between his fists, and as a , a glowing light cycle is inscribed around them, completely encasing them
: 3                                                         3 as the cycles take off
We see that each leaves a solidifying laser trail behind it
One turns abruptly, creating a wall in front of the other

5                                                     5 We see teenagers, strangely lit from below with bluish light, their hands on electronic controls, levers, knobs
We electronic beeping and popping

One , and the other disappears when it is hit, to reappear, spinning wildly, in the distance

On the screen is a typical version of Tank Wars with computer generated representations of tanks in a 2- maze

We see the one colored blue throw; his disk smashes into the second warrior, and he dissolves into thousands of glowing lines

version of Jai Alai, in which the two players stand suspended in space on glowing colored rings, and throw a pellet of solid energy at each other
14                                         14 He is huge, evil looking
His body is enormous, his head mechanical
This is
He glows ominously blue
He is catching the pellet thrown from his opponent who is much smaller, glowing yellow
15     -                                  15 fearful, nervous, poised on one ring
16                                                            16 sneering, as he uses his electronic cesta to hurl the pellet back with violent force
16A                                              16A desperately trying to catch the pellet, but it smashes into the ring, which explodes into a million pieces
One last glimpse of the yellow warrior's tortured, desperate face as he falls to instant death
17                                                            17 triumphant,
High above him, etched in enormous glowing computer printed 3- block letters, are the words: ":   -

God, Lisa,  almost had you that time
: 18     -                                   18 We see two  playing a table model video game, where we can see the words: "Winner - Blue" printed
The game console is prominently marked with the letter logo of the manufacturer: "

(holds out a hand) Yeah, if you've got another quarter
, : 19                                                19 Sark is striding through a wide corridor where other tough looking blue warriors are lounging around, leaning against the walls, sitting on the floor against the wall
They look up as Sark comes in and one of them calls out: 1 Sark, my man
You are hot
2 That knuckleball gets 'em every time, boy
Sark and the other blue warriors  , and Sark moves on
: 20                                   20 overlooking the video game grid
We see Sark walking onto the bridge, removing his cesta and tossing it aside carelessly

Sark plugs himself into the feet sockets with a  of satisfaction
The buzzer stops and we see the holographic image of a cylinder forming around Sark, at first translucent and then solidifying so that we can't see through it, and Sark is hidden from view
21
- '                                    21 of this happening
We can see the inside surface of the cylinder a wavering image of a stretched out face, just features, appears superimposed on the cylinder
The face speaks
() You're getting brutal, Sark
Brutal and needlessly sadistic
The feet sockets glow and we see Sark absorbing the energy like a drug addict, eyes glazed
Thank
you, Master Control
We might be capturing some military programs soon
that interest you
Sure, 'd love to go up against some of these guys
be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me
Which branch of the service
Strategic Air Command
(impressed) Nice
The sockets glow 'more intensely as the hologram disappears, and we a   of Sark's satiated face to: 22                                     22 long, darkened, sinister
dejected and disheveled character () is being escorted by a guard
() Look, this is all a mistake
'm just a compound interest program,  work at a savings and loan
can't play in these video games
Sure you can, pal
You're a natural athlete,  ever saw one
Come on
Are you kidding
Me
run out to check an the -Bill rates,  get out of breath
Hey, really
you're gonna make my User, Mr
Henderson, really mad
He's a full branch manager
(rolls his eyes) Great, another religious nut
They stop in front of a cell, the guard opens the door and shoves the protesting captive inside
The door  shut, locked
23
23 as the captive falls against one wall from the force of the guard's shove
The cell is small, one-man, and in each wall next to the door, an opening gives a view of the next cell
Through one of the windows, we can see the back of another captive program, and through the other, a face looking over at the newcomer
The character speaks: () Welcome to luxury living
The new captive looks up, nervous
Uh, thanks, but
don't even know what 'm doing here
You believe in the Users
Sure, if  don't have a User, then who wrote me
That's what you're doing here
Master Control Program's been snapping up all us programs who believe
if he thinks you're useful, he takes over all your functions so he gets bigger
an' if he can't use you, he sends you down here to the Game Grid to get the bits blasted outta you
What's your name
Crom
'm Ram
They'll train you for the games, but
well,  hope you make it okay
Hey, what's going on in the other sectors
've been stuck in this Grid for 200 microcycles
He points to several hash marks on his cell wall
It's murder out there
You can't even travel around your own microcircuits without permission from that Master Control creep
Hauling me down here to play games
who does he calculate he is
(holds his head in his hands) If only Tron was still around
He looks up as Ram makes a  under his breath
Ram has a strange, still expression on his face
You ever see that guy in action
Hundred-percent independent couldn't tell him what to -- He stops
Ram is looking over his shoulder
(continuing) What's wrong
What did  say
There's a slight noise from cell beyond Ram's
: 24                                            24 It turns slowly, silhouetted by the light from the outer corridor

Oh my User
Tron--they've got you in here
26      '                                26 with Ram to one side, smiling slightly, and Crom staring
Not for long, friend

-               27 Here in a maze of complex pathways, we see a lone tank moving along one of the paths
28
28 lone program sits at the controls
His armor is worn and beaten and his glow subdued
This is
With his thermos of glowing coffee and his suicide-jockey manner, he reminds us of a truck driver on an all-night run
Think we can merge into this mem'ry okay, good buddy
spot of glowing light zips around the tank, stops and expands into a solid glowing green sphere with the suggestion of a face as it speaks
(eagerly) 10-4
As soon as it is finished speaking, it goes back to being pure light
Now, ol' Flynn said to look over in here
28A
28A The tank makes a quick run through a maze-like path with rounded corners -- a computer memory microcircuit
28B
28B but  don't see what he's looking for
'd better get over to that input/output tower and let him know
28C                                           28C at the instrument panel

-                     29 shot    of a figure typing on a computer terminal keyboard, talking to himself in a low voice
He stop typing, waits for some information to read out
Beyond him we see a couple of large video parlor game consoles
Come on, you scuzzy little data, be in there
30                                           30 He's a young, blonde guy in his mid-twenties
Very attractive, charming, innocent looking, but with a devilish gleam in his eye
've got such nice blue paper to print you out on, if you'll just sit still
on that gleam in his eye and see the brilliant colors of the  screen reflected there
: 31    --                                    31 The tank heads along a path of circuitry toward a tall, glowing "tower" -- an input/output component
32                                                    32 red light flashes on the control panel
Clu comes alert and sits up
He stares at the warning
Spot of light that is Bit zips up next to his head
Uh oh
we got company
(coming into shape again, but red this time) No
You said it
one of those Recognizers comes after me, gonna hafta jump clear out of the data stream
: 33     -
'   -                   33 We see Flynn sit up abruptly, and his fingers start flying over the keys
34     -
34 We see the turret of the tank swivel around
In the distance is an immense block-like robotic bluish black form, -shaped, with a small head and a glowing yellow bar for eyes-- a recognizer
It hovers above the ground
35                                 35 second Reco is coming up behind the first
36
36 (in dismay) Oh my
the long arm o' the law
: 37
37 at the first Reco
That one falls heavily to the ground and the tank speeds up, swiveling around to try to fire at the second Reco, but it moves too fast and can't avoid a gulley
The tank goes in and is stuck - no traction
38     -                                           38 Clu standing on it
The Bit zips by him, and they both head away from the tank, fast
39                                                        39 glowing static field appears between the two legs of the Recognizer, and it sweeps over the tank, de-rezzing it
We can see more tanks approaching over an edge of the landscape
40                                                             40 running, looking up as the Reco closes in
We see the dead Reco up ahead, and the streak of the Bit making for it
41     - '                                         41 reacting in fear, looking up as the screen

43                                                 43 Flynn
Ah, hell
busted again
He tries clearing the monitor, but the repeating line just comes right back, monotonously moving across the screen
44       -  as we:                             44 : 45     -                               45 Clu is in electronic energy ring chains, his feet in sockets like Sark's, but this time the energy from the sockets is deadly, torturous
Hovering in front of him is the hologram of the
Beside Clu stands one of the memory guards
Got a pirate program here
says his name's Clu
The  responds in the manner of a -movie police sergeant grilling a suspect
What'd he pull
Came into the system with a stolen password
an' we caught him tryin' to raid a high-clearance memory
(looks up, his face wracked with pain) No
must've gotten in there by mistake,  - The pain overwhelms him as the energy from the feet sockets momentarily becomes unbearable
Who programmed you
The guard gives Clu a shove to keep him from losing consciousness
(
) You're in trouble, pal
big trouble
But if you tell us who put you up to it, you could make it easy on yourself
Come on, who's your user
Forget it, Mister High 'n' Mighty Master Control
you're not makin' me talk
Suit yourself
The feet sockets really let loose, and Clu  in agony, but doesn't speak
Suddenly his body appears to dissolve into the broken pattern of a fading television picture and disintegrates into electric static
Get me Dillinger

) Hello, please hold a moment for the Master Control Program As we fly over the grid, descending, the image comes into clearer focus, and we realize that this is not a circuit board, but rather an actual landscape, a suburban grid at twilight
We are approaching a skyscraper which is yet too far off to distinguish accurately
As we descend, a thumping, rhythmic noise gradually increases in volume until it is very loud, and we realize it is the sound of a , and we are in the cockpit looking down at the landscape

Several technicians are at hand, and as the helicopter touches down, they rush out to secure it
52-57                                                        52-57 58

Dillinger stands behind a table
We see that the entire surface of the table is a gigantic computer terminal
His fingers punch out a code on the touch-sensitive keyboard and we see printed out on the screen: : access to Master Control Program, User code 00 - Dillinger
Password:
The computer's screen clears, and the Master Control Program addresses Dillinger, simultaneously speaking in a human-sound voice through a pair of studio-quality stereo  and printing out its words on the computer screen, The 's  is the same as that of the "bad cop" who grilled Clu, but its tone is now that of a compassionate psychiatrist working with a favored patient
Hello, Ed
Thanks for coming back early
Dillinger settles into a chair
No problem, Master-
If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show
(shrugs) What's up
It's our friend the boy detective
He's nosing around again
Flynn
Yes
It felt like Flynn
He's still looking for that old file
can't you just appropriate it
would if  could find it
it's stashed somewhere off in the system
out of my range
Meanwhile
Meanwhile, he might find it
'm afraid so
spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time
think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file
Just to be safe
There's a 68
71 percent chance you're right
Cute

Come on in
Alan
Alan Bailey
Oh, yes
The algorithms on cloud seeding
great piece of work
How's it going
He waves Alan to a chair; they sit
Well,  don't know
just tried to run this program 've been working on, and  was denied access all of a sudden
thought maybe 'd been laid off and nobody told me
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you
Yeah
We have to close that down, just briefly
Security reasons
Someone with that access has been tampering
hope you don't think it's me
don't even balance my checkbook on downtime
've got a Honeywell at home for that
No, no, 'm sure, but -- you understand
It should only be a couple of days
What's the thing you're working on
It's called Tron
It's a security program itself, actually
Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems
If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down
sent you a memo on it
Mmm
Part of the Master Control Program
No, it'll run independently
It can watchdog the  as well
Ah
Sounds good
Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, hope
Ok Alan rises, goes to the door
As soon as he leaves: (trouble) Oh boy
The Master Control Program comes back to life, on the screen and through the speakers
Ed,  am so very disappointed in you
'm sorry - (sharply) can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me
Do you have any idea how many outside systems 've gone into
How many programs 've appropriated
(nods) It's my fault
programmed you to want so much
And  was planning to hit the Pentagon next week
The Pentagon
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was
But now
this is what  get for using humans
Now, wait a minute --  wrote you
've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then
What do you want with the Pentagon
The same thing  want with the Kremlin
'm bored with corporations
With the information  can access,  can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human
If you think - You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a  at the New York Times, would you
You wouldn't dare
So do as  tell you
Keep that Tron program out of the system
And get me those Chinese language program  asked for

Interesting, interesting
You hear what you said

The "firing" end of the giant laser is aimed straight at the sphere
Five feet away is an identical plat-form -- empty
Let me make sure we're running She crosses to a   nearby
The console is connected to the laser by a few dozen wires and cables
Pulling her goggles into place over her eyes, she sits at the console
Gibbs, adjusting his goggles, takes a position near the platform bearing the sphere -- safe from the laser, but close enough to watch
74    -                                                  74 She types a series of commands on the computer keyboard
Looks good
(
) Let 'er rip
75     -                                          75 The laser shoots a bolt of blindingly bright  at the polymer sphere
For a moment, the sphere has the look of a wavering, poorly received television picture -- wobbling lines of dots -- and then it disappears entirely
As Gibbs watches, a Lora works feverishly, the laser pivots to point at the platform a few feet away
second discharge of  hits the surface of this platform, and -- like a film-in-reverse of the ball's disappearance -- it is reconstructed, five feet from its original position
When the beam shuts off, Lora rushes to join Gibbs in examining the born-again ball of plastic
(quietly) Perfect
At the
of an appreciative pair of hands clapping, Lora and a Gibbs turn to  Alan, in hard hat, goggles, and paper shoe-covers, walking toward them
Beautiful
Hello, Alan
Boy,  sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun
He gives Lora an embrace and a quick kiss
Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing
While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it
The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam
Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and
(indicates ball) voila
75                                                       75 Great
Can it send me to Hawaii
Yes
but you have to go roundtrip, and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance
Hah
The three start walking out of the laser lab, Alan and Lora with their arms around each other's shoulders
How's it going upstairs
Frustrating
had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system
Gibbs looks alarmed, but doesn't say anything
(continuing) Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store
Well, you have to expect some static
Computers are just machines after all, they can't think
They'll start to soon enough
(wryly) Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop
Lora, 'm going to stay and run some data through
See you tomorrow
goodnights

have to put on the protective suits, or at least dirt-free shoes
Lora is pulling off her white suit, and Alan pulls white paper protectors off his shoes
Did you say Group 7 access
Yeah
pain in the neck, you know, was all set Did he say why
(shrugs) Something about tampering
Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the & budget into his checking account,  don't know
Why are you so interested
Flynn had Group 7 access
Flynn had access to you, too
'm not interested in talking about him
Oh,  wish you'd forget about that
It was all so long ago
've totally gotten over it
Okay, okay
want to go to his place
You call that getting over it
mean  want both of us to go
She closes her locker
He follows her into the corridor

What for
To warn him
Of what
That Dillinger's on to him
They get into the elevator
For what
For being on to Dillinger

We see dozens of individual machines, where scores of and , teenagers mostly, but older and younger kids too, are playing the games, watching, milling around,
As the kids play, colored glows from the video games light up their faces eerily

They are slightly bewildered and confused by the weird noises
Lora approaches a junior high school girl who's watching a hot game of "Battle Zone
" Hey, where's Flynn tonight
The kid looks at Lora, then turns towards the center of the room and points
Alan and Lora look
: 92                                                           92 playing a game called Space Paranoids,    into his face, catching the orange glow from the console
The game has a prominent  logo under the screen
Flynn is a cocky kid in his mid-20s, unshaven, wearing a -shirt, jeans, jogging shoes
He's racked up a terrific score
Kids are grouped around him, tensely watching the game -- fans
As we watch, the machine's nine-digit scoreboard goes to 999,999,999 -- then flashes the word "" as lights blink and a  sounds
The kids cheer wildly
It's all in the wrist, friends
He grins tiredly and turns away from the game to find Lora approaching him, with Alan in tow
(continuinq) Hey
Good to see you guys
Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple
We have to talk
Good luck
You can't even think in here
He leads them toward the back of the arcade
(
) Come on
93-96                                                          93-96 97

), and a couple of video games -- Flynn's favorites
As Flynn, Lora, and Alan enter, they find the arcade noise considerably muffled
Flynn settles into a chair; Alan leans against a game, nervous; Lora paces
(stretching his arms, relaxing) So
how's the world of serious science
Have you been sneaking into the system
Whew
You never were much for small talk
(to Alan) She still leave her clothes all over the floor
Alan looks profoundly uncomfortable
Flynn
Uh, no
mean, not that often - Flynn laughs
(to Alan, indicating arcade) You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old
Touche, honey
Yeah, 've been doing a little hacking here
Which 've got every reason, as you well know
You did break in
Tried to
(nods toward terminal) Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though
If  had a direct terminal
Are you embezzling
(Sydney Greenstreet) "Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey
(normal voice) No, actually 'm trying to get a legal brief together
don't get it
(to Lora) You haven't told him
She shakes her head
(
) (sighs) Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for
oh, 1973
Kevin Flynn (points to himself) is one of the brightest young software engineers at
He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called
(waves at one of the games in the room) Space Paranoids
You invented Space Paranoids
Yepper
And Vice Squad, and Meltdown
whole slew of 'em
was this close (gestures) to starting my own little enterprise
But: enter Ed Dillinger
Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky
One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and
nothing
big blank
We now take you to three months later
Ed Dillinger presents  with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion
Thus begins his meteoric rise to
what is he now, Executive
Senior exec
Oh my
Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and 'm not seeing one dime
still don't get why you're trying to break into the system
Because somewhere
in one of those memories
is the evidence
If  got in far enough,  could reconstruct it
(
) My password
Dillinger's instruction to divert the data
'm afraid it's a little late for that
Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access
He must know what you're up to
Boy,  bet  know who's workin' late tonight
Dillinger
Yeah
Tryin' to find the file and erase it
Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him
Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high
Don't even say that
You've got to find that file before he does
Not much chance of that now
The  can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it
Not if my Tron program was running
That would seal the system off
If your file's in there
Boy, if we were inside,  know how to forge us a Group 6 access
They all look at each other
After a beat, Lora holds the keys to her van aloft
Shall we dance

Gibbs, standing, faces him
Ed, all 'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs
you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research - Walter,  sympathize, but  have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy -- That , you know, that's half the problem right -- The  is the most efficient way of handling what we do
can't sit and worry about every little user request that -- User requests are what computers are for
Doing our business is what computers are for
Look, Walter, with all respect -- isn't the business you started in your garage anymore -- As he speaks, he types a quick command into the console key board, and a series of  appear on the computer's screens: vast computer banks
rows of-magnetic disks
's globe logo spinning in space, covered with a glowing circuit pattern, then a shot of millions of cancelled checks being counted electronically; then 3- computer representations of vessels (aircraft carrier and Solar Sailer)
On another screen, we see statements of 's wealth adding up, accounts receivable and assets
(
) We're billing accounts in 30 countries, we've got one of the largest systems in existence
Gibbs turns wearily away from the display
Oh,  know all that
Sometimes  wish was back in that garage
It can be arranged
Gibbs turns to face Dillinger again
That was uncalled-for
'm sorry, Walt
So much pressure lately
you feel like going for a drink
Thank you, no
have some work to do
assuming  can still log on
He exits

-                                    102 Lora's van pulls up on a side street, around the corner from 's main gate
The  building looms high above them, an ominous box
102a
102a digital  on the dashboard reads 12:12
Lora is at the wheel, Alan next to her
You better get in back with Flynn
And keep down
She jerks her thumb over her shoulder
Do  gotta
But he climbs over the seat, and Lora starts to drive slowly forward
103                                            103 Hi, Alan
(resigned) Hi, Flynn
Flynn pulls a bag of doughnuts from his pocket
(explaining) My dinner
was wondering where you got that glow of good health
Want one
Uh
got any cinnamon
Flynn smiles, hands Alan a doughnut
'  (
) Keep it down, you guys

-     -            104 Lora's van pulls to a stop beyond the door at the rear of the building, and the three get out
Lora inserts her
card into a magnetic reader beside the door
Nothing happens
don't think 'm cleared for this
'm certainly not
Move aside
Let the kid have some room
He gestures Alan and Lora out of the way, takes out a small black box, with several buttons, a -digital counter- with  numerals and a small calculator keyboard
He leans over the security lock, his     and  a couple of notes
There's a distinct , an the door starts to swing open
and open
and open
We see that this door is about twenty feet thick
Flynn starts
105
105 The three of them walk along a semi-darkened corridor, trying to nonchalantly avoid the security monitor camera mounted on the wall
But as they go past it, it swivels and aims right at them
Okay
Flynn, 'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab
We'll be up in Alan's office
Swell
'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running
As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here

-                           112 from the rotating security camera outside the elevator on the floor of the laser lab
We see Flynn's face peek out and see the camera
His head pulls back in
113                                                  113 As the security camera aims away from the-elevator, Flynn and Lora make a mad dash down the hall and we see Alan's face watching
114
-                          114 from the camera at the entrance to the laser lab
We see Flynn approaching the camera, stuffing the last donut from his bag into his mouth
He takes the empty bag, raises it up, mugging to the camera, and pushes the bag over the lens

Don't spill anything
Flynn  as Lora goes out
120                                               120 settling in, loosening his fingers, like a concert pianist, or a safecracker
He types in a code number, presses the "enter" key
121                                               121 We see a camera emerging from a sliding panel
122                                                       122 from this camera

You realize  can't allow this

We can see as the door rises more of the laser equipment, and it is this section that is being activated

Now, how do you expect to run the universe if you let a few unsolvable problems throw you like that
'mon, big boy, let's see what
You're entering a big error, Flynn
'm going to have to put you on the Game Grid
Games, huh
'll give you -- Suddenly, before Flynn can go on, the gigantic laser mechanism behind him sends a brilliant beam of  directly at him
He freezes
We see his body beginning to break into scan lines, like a video image -- the same thing that happened to Gibbs' polymer ball
We can see the terminal also glowing in the intense light, being scanned by the laser
The colors change, become monochromatic - with Flynn's body glowing orange - and the image of his figure blurs and becomes indistinct
on Flynn and : 129     over a circuit pattern, like the one      129 we saw at the opening of the film'
The pattern changes, dissolving into another image and we are rushing forward at great speed
We see the circuits rushing by and getting larger and then the picture dissolves into darkness with a glowing, spinning globe beneath us, like the globe from 's logo, covered with circuits
We are rushing at it, circling it, diving closer and closer, so that the detail on the globe becomes clearer with every second and we realize that the circuits are structures, angular towers and buildings, huge mechanical looking mountains and deserts covered with a glowing grid pattern
Everything glows with an internal energy
We continue diving, down, down, faster and faster and we see the structures of one city-like area across electronic mesas and cliffs, and then we're right over this area and diving straight down, everything blurring with the speed
: 130    -                                    130 made up of rings of energy, and we are diving straight down it

: 132                                     132 We see Flynn, or what looks like Flynn -- same face, etc, but now covered with a strange costume, made of electronic circuitry, glowing with energy
Flynn shakes his head dazedly
Oh, man
this isn't happening
It only thinks it's happening
He looks up and  something
133  '                                                   133 horrendous, towering character, carrying a long, glowing staff, is right in front of him
This character reaches out an arm and grabs Flynn

Take it easy
Look, if this is about those parking tickets,  can explain everything

We see Sark in his feet sockets, his hands spread out flat on the table in front of him fills the chamber and a holographic image begins to form, shimmering into awful shape
We see the stretched out face dissolving into the cylinder of the

Sark suddenly snaps to awareness, directing all his attention to the

He's not any kind of program, Sark
He's a User
Sark looks up, shocked
User
That's right
He pushed me
in the other world
Somebody pushes me,  push back
So  brought him down here
What's the matter, Sark
You look nervous
Well,  -- it's just --  don't know, a User,  mean
Users wrote us
User even wrote you
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me

You rather take your chances with me
Want me to slow down your power cycles for you
The circuits going into the energy sockets fade; we see Sark weaken
Wait
need that
Then pull yourself together

They turn a corner and continue, finally stopping in front of a cell
The door opens automatically
Flynn holds back

The guard shoves Flynn inside and  the door, cutting off his voice

137 The same type of cell Crom was thrown into in the title sequence
Flynn is leaning against the door, staring at his hands

Hey
Who are you guys
What's the story around here
But as his hand reaches the dividing point between the two cells, it hits an invisible barrier, and we see a brilliant energy field come instantaneously into existence, stopping his hand, and then disappearing
Flynn pulls back in shock
142                                                            142 turning towards Flynn as he hears this noise
You want to watch those force fields
He goes to the window opening
(
) You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that
Look
just so  can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay
Where am
You're a
"guest" of the Master Control Program
They're going to make you play video games
(relieved) Well, great, that's no sweat --  play video games better than anybody
Ram gives Flynn an astonished look, but before he can say anything, there's a tremendous  , and the door of Flynn's cell opens
143                                                    143 we see guards pulling out other  from their cells, and as Flynn is led off down the corridor, Tron and Ram are taken in the opposite direction

Overhead, the aircraft carrier hovers menacingly, casting a shadow on the programs below
The new captives are led out onto the ledges, herded by the guards
They pass some of the Blue Video Warriors, who  and make fun of them
Flynn is in the front of the line
Look operative, you guys

Sark speaks from the bridge of the carrier, and his voice is amplified over the grid

Flynn goes to the bars
Hey, Ram
what were you

(nostalgic, brightens) Oh,  was an actuarial program
worked at a big insurance company
It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really (about to get bored) Yeah, yeah -- that's great
How 'bout yourself
Oh, uh
don't remember too much
(nods) Sure, a little disorientation
That's normal, when they transport you
It'll come back to you
You're doing real well in training
Remarkable, really
The  on Flynn's cell begins again
187                                  187 We see Flynn being led down the hall on the big screen behind Sark's console
Sark is staring up at the screen, frowning, nervous, frightened of this new User-warrior
(over his shoulder) Wait a minute
put this guy against one of the other recruits
188                                                           188 189                                 189 We see they are entering an open part of the Game Grid, with two bridges of energy extending across open space to two separate circular platforms, made up of concentric glowing rings
Crom marches across-one of these, and Flynn follows suit on the other
When they each reach the circular platforms, the bridges disappear
We see Flynn turn and stare back across the empty space, then turn and face his opponent
Above them a third floating disk hovers
He looks over at Crom, who's anxious
Looks like we're in the same boat here - (jumpy) You think you're gonna wipe me right out, don't you
No, buzzer sounds
The game begins
Crom hurls a glowing pellet upwards
It strikes the upper platform, ricochets off, and heads straight for Flynn
Flynn lunges, but misses
The pellet strikes one of the rings of his platform, and that ring dissolves
Flynn's lunge takes him right to the edge of the open space created, and he just catches himself in time to keep from falling over the edge
190  '  -                                            190 down, down between the rings into an infinite pit
191                                                    191 staring down
There's a  and he looks up
192                                                         192 Another pellet hits the mirror platform and hurtles down at him
Hey
193                                                          193 reacting, judging where this one will fall, racing to the farther edge of his platform, leaping over the empty ring on the way, and catching the pellet before it can' hit
He throws it back
194                                                           194 Flynn's pellet hits the mirror, flashes down on him
Crom strains, but misses
One of his rings disappears
195   reacting                                               195 (happy he's scored) Okay
196  '   -                           196 High above the game we see Sark watching
197                                                          197 racing for another catch
He makes it and hurls the pellet again
We see that Crom's platform is disappearing fast
198                                                           198 199                                              199 Here's an easy one
Flynn throws again
The pellet hits the mirror platform and heads straight at Crom, who misses it
The pellet destroys the ring he was standing on, and Crom has to grab frantically at the edge of the next ring to keep from falling
200-201                                                          200-201 202                                                          202 He is sent another pellet from above and catches it, holding it ready, waiting for his opponent to get back up on the ring
203                                                           203 His face lit from below by the glow of the Game Grid

Suddenly a voice rings out from above
Flynn looks up
There, appearing in the mirror disk above, is Sark's face, furious, huge
Finish the game
205                                                          205 staring at this apparition
He grits his teeth
(shouts up) No
205A   -                                      205A In a Greyhound station waiting area, two kids are playing a video game, which appears to have broken down
What's wrong with it
2 don't know
on the blink or something

205B   - , ,

Flynn holds up the pellet
and drops it down into the abyss below
He stares back up at Sark's immense image
No
206  '                                     206 in the mirror platform, towering above Flynn
You'll regret this

209                                             209 with Flynn visible, staring down, and the huge face of Sark above him
210                                                           210 on the bridge
His finger wavers over another button, almost presses it
We see him-straining, trying to overcome his conditioning
Then he snatches his hand away
(looking up) No
You said he could die in the games 211                                                          211 staring up
The image on the mirror wavers and dissolves
212                                                           212 He  his palm down on a panel on the console, and a 213                                                          213 as the bridge to his platform reappears, and we see guards starting to run across to him

couple of big Blue Warriors go by and deliberately brush into Flynn
(turning on Flynn, snarling) Outta  my way, rookie
Flynn stares at him; then, in one smooth motion, reaches to his back and pulls out his disk
Out of my way, zero bit
He moves as if to throw the disk
(backing away) Sure, sure
just kiddin'
The other warrior grabs this one by the arm and pulls him away as Flynn and his guards continue on
216                             216 Ram and Tron are escorted in as Flynn is brought in from another corridor
Three blue warriors are lined up, waiting
Flynn
Look, Tron, he survived
(under his breath) Tron
He leans over to get a better look at Tron and  in surprise
Alan

Well, isn't it --
The name of my User, yeah
But how

on the section of the grid where the game is about to start
218                                                 218 The three Blue Warriors are lined up facing our friends, on opposite sides of the large arena, about a half mile square, surrounded by high bulwarks, and surveyed by Recognizers
We can see the carrier hovering high overhead
219                                                    219 That's what my User wants, too
220                                          220 holding the handlebars of the cycles in front of them

221    -                                            221 With a sizzling electrical discharge, the light cycle is inscribed around him

225                              225 We see the six solid walls being formed behind the cycles
As we watch the outer four cycles veer off to either side, leaving Tron and his opponent speeding suicidally at each other: 226                                                           226 227  '                                                    227 of the other cycle heading straight at him
228                                                  228 We see these two cycles come together and almost crash
but both turn at the last second to the same side and continue rushing forward
The other cycles can be seen racing around the edge of the arena
' (into mike) Nice one
229                                       229 They start making turns, passing walls they have already created, each trying to box the other in

Tron is on one side, but the Blue Warrior is on the inside
Tron forces the warrior to smash straight into the wall
There is an explosion as the cycle de-rezzes, and a crack forms in the bulwark
We see that the walls created by the de-rezzed warrior dissolve as he does
234                                                    234 rushing alongside his opponent

At the last second, the Blue Warrior turns, but Flynn races right at the crack

He turns and races up next to Tron

250                                   250 racing through the narrow crack in the bulwark, barely enough room to get by

The cycles rush around corners of the ledges, pursued by the tanks, high above the flat surface
They come around a corner onto a wider ledge with several dark openings in the face of the cliff
They stop for a moment

258
258 We see the three cycles descend a long sloping ramp into the darkness, down, down into the dry rot section
The cycles come to a stop and de-rez
Leaving each man standing with just the handlebars between his fists
They all let out a long  and relax
Oh man
when you're on the other side of the screen
it all looks so easy
Ram and Tron look at Flynn as if he's crazy, then start smiling and grinning, until all three are

There's no place else they could be
Sark's lieutenant is watching the wall-sized screen behind Sark, where we can see a diagram of the area, with the tanks visible, moving through it

261 Ram, Tron and Flynn are climbing up to an opening in the wall of the cave
Beyond them we can see a cluster of structures, like a cityscape, and one enormous  with a golden beam of light rising from it, farther up than the eye can see
No tanks are visible
(looking out) It's all circuits
(points at tower) Must be an input/output component
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from
(sitting down against a rock) Well
my home "sector" was called Paramus
(sits also) wonder what those initials stand for
(starts counting them off on his fingers)
probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place
(shrugs) It grows on you
He notices that Tron is not listening to them any longer, but is gazing upwards
(murmuring) can feel it
Flynn and Ram turn
Feel what
You okay
Alan-One
Yes
he's got something to tell me
Ram and Tron look out at the distant tall tower
You think we can make it there
We have to
(pointing to a corner of the cave) Hey, what's that
They all look back, into the darkness behind them
glowing stream can just be seen
Ram gets up
it's just what we need
262
262 Ram and Tron are drinking, kneeling at the stream of flowing, brilliant
Oh, that's nice
You always forget how good fresh energy feels, till you get to a pure source
(to Flynn) Have some
you'll need it
Flynn goes to the stream, dips his hands in, takes a drink
(wiping his mouth) well
when do we pay a call on the ol' Master Control
Tron and Ram are taken aback
What, just the three of us
(shrugs) You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine
but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out
An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker
feel like hittin' him now, while 'm good an' mad
Some nerve
what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters
(to Tron) Do you know what he's talking about
(to Flynn) have to find out what Alan wants
that comes first
Okay, that's first
Maybe he knows what to - Suddenly, we hear a
Flynn looks up sharply
(
) What's that
Tanks
coming back
Let's go
With that, there's an  from outside the cave
Each of the men holds up his cycle handlebars, and the three cycles  back into shape and race up the ramp, and on out
263-265                                                          263-265 266
266 The three cyclists pause at the cave opening, sizing up possible avenues of escape in the terrain below
(points) How about over there
that empty memory
(shakes head) No good
they might block off the old chip
(points) This way
The cycles race out of the cave entrance and head down, away from the approaching tanks, through the electronic canyons, shells around them
We see the tanks close behind
267                                                 267 from inside of the tanks, of the three bikes heading into a narrow arroyo
268                                                268 They just make it around the corner when an  boasts the entrance to the arroyo, entering what appears to be a maze of very narrow canyons with short walls
They turn another corner and come to the edge of a gaping ravine
Several hundred feet to their left a narrow bridge connects their ledge with another canyon wall, and a wider ledge, which leads down to the floor of the entire area, and on to freedom
' The bridge
Come on
The tanks are following through the maze, smooth gray automatons, lifeless, inexorable nemesis
Tron's cycle is in the lead as all three race for the bridge, but behind them, we see the first tank turning the corner
: 269                                              269 as the turret swings around and focuses on the bridge
270                                                270 Tron races out on it, Ram and Flynn behind
Just as Tron reaches the other side and Ram has just started to cross, there's a tremendous  of electronic , blasting Ram and tossing him back on top of Flynn
Both cycles de-rez
The bridge disappears, and a mass of rubble falls, partially Obscuring Ram and Flynn
Tron to a halt and swings his bike back around
He looks around -- Ram and Flynn are nowhere in sight
in the ravine below, he  a pile of motionless rubble
The tank fires again, narrowly missing Tron, and he  up again, speeds off down the ramp, and is gone
: 271-272                                                          271-272 273                                                    273 Ram is badly injured, unconscious
Flynn struggles to his feet, sees the tank turret swiveling towards him, grabs Ram and picks him up
274                                                    274 struggling with Ram's limp body, wedging himself into a narrow crack
: 275                                                           275 in the carrier above
He is watching the action on the wall screen behind his console, back to the camera
The picture is coming from the lead tank
To him, it appears as though Ram and Flynn had been blown up, since no sign of them is visible
We can see his lieutenant nearby, operating the communications
(to lieutenant) Make contact with master Control
(smiles) he'll be pleased to hear we're all finished with that User he sent us
276
- '                                    276 speeding through the flat, desert-like terrain, heading straight for the cityscape tower in the distance
277       -                                277 Far behind him, we see the image of Sark's carrier ponderously moving in his direction
: 278                                                    278 Flynn is supporting Ram, half carrying him, and it is getting darker
You gonna make it
Ram weakly nods, but doesn't look very convincing
Flynn bites his lip and struggles on
They are down on the floor of the desert, leaving the towering canyons behind
large, dim shape can be made out
Flynn peers at it hopefully and struggles towards it
: 279                                                          279 arriving in front of a block-like shape, with a narrow opening
Exhausted, Flynn lets Ram down to the ground, goes to the opening and looks in
Looks okay, so he comes back
: 280                                                    280 sitting down inside the hiding place, collapsing
Ram is unconscious anyway, and Flynn's eyes soon closed
: 281                                                281 Some light comes in the opening, and we see Flynn lying on a platform across from Ram
Ram's glow appears to be almost gone
Flynn's eyes open
For a second he doesn't know where he is, but then he spots Ram, and comes fully awake
Ram is watching him
Flynn looks around
He gets up and stretches, his hand reaching up towards the ceiling
It brushes against one panel and suddenly the energy glow from his body seems to leap from his hand to the panel, leaving it with a glow of its own
The entire chamber starts to shake and (holding onto the wall) What's goin' on
(looking around, weak) We're inside a Recognizer
(to Flynn) You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer -- (stumbling, trying to keep his balance) Are you kidding
think it's stealing us - Flynn tentatively places his-hands on separate parts of the instruments
An energy flow starts, and with a mighty heave and shudder, the chamber they're in turns over, knocking both Flynn and Ram to one side
The Recognizer is now in its standard upright position
: 282
282 as it stands up, covered with a static overlay, partially de-rezzed
283
283 Through the head of the Reco, we can look out at the landscape below
Flynn sits stunned for a moment, then stumbles over to Ram, who's going fast
You okay
You don't look so good
Ram nods weakly
(
) Hang on
We'll get you outta here
Flynn touches panels, trying to get the Recognizer going, but with no result
(
) Damn
Never fails
minute the warranty runs out
Come here
Flynn goes over to him and kneels
Ram grabs his hands
Suddenly Ram's fading glow begins to flow through their clasped hands into Flynn
Horrified, Flynn tries to pull away, but Ram holds him fast
Hey
Little more juice's all it needs
Ram's last bit of energy flows into Flynn and Ram's body de-rezzes
Flynn watches in horror, frantically trying to reverse the flow, but it's too late
Ram disappears before his eyes
Stunned, he gazes at the empty space for a moment, then stands up
: 284                                               284 Tron arrives at the city, gazing around an empty, surreal, burnt-out landscape
Buildings seem two dimensional, barely there, at a low rate of power, so drained by the
The cycle de-rezzes
There's a from above, and Tron looks up
285  '                                                    285 Recognizer floats over the city, moving towards him
286
286 He hides behind a building as the Reco passes
strange, zombie-like figure comes down one of the streets, and the Recognizer swoops over it, the static field flashing between the legs, passing through the figure, dissolving it
287    '                                          287 Very grim
He looks out onto the street and sees two more of the figures, standing together, staring at each other, barely moving
Dead, lifeless, but animate
Tron comes out on the street, staring at these figures
He locks around the city in confusion, shaking his head sadly, but walks on
288                                               288 Up ahead we see a large, multi-storied factory-like building
289    -                                         289 This is what he was looking for
He looks from side to side, figuring the best way to get to the building
In front of the building stand a small group of the memory guards
: 290
-                                          290 of the city, and the tower and beam rising high into the air, with Sark's carrier far away, nearing the city
: 291
-                                        291 over the complex landscape, of the distant city and tower, with Sark's carrier far away, nearing the city
: 292
-                                       292 This was his  out of the window of the Recognizer
His face is sad, he is still mourning Ram
This is a very low point
He sighs, then looks around, putting his palm on one panel after another
One of them glows brilliantly as he touches it, and the Recognizer gives a violent shake, then stops
Never gonna figure out how to work this thing
There's a  from above
He looks up
293                                                         293 We see a bright glow behind one of the pieces of equipment
294                                                          294 His eyes widen, then narrow
He non chalantly turns away, pretending to be still examining things
: 295                                                        295 Appearing again, peeking around the corner
It comes forward, trying to get a look at Flynn
The
296                                                       296 Flynn whirls around, fingers poised like a gunfighter
The Bit gives a violent start and leaps back, out of the way, but immediately comes back, peering at Flynn
Flynn is moving closer
Okay -- hold it right there
The Bit is still in its pure energy form, but then it suddenly recognizes Flynn (thinks he is Clu), expands in a smooth green sphere -- the "Yes" mode and shouts: Yes
The Bit subsides into energy form again
(still suspicious) What do you mean, "'yes"
Yesssss
Yes
Yes
Yes
From now on, whenever the Bit speaks, it is a ball-shaped character, red or green, with a hint of a face, but as soon as it stops speaking, it reverts to a brilliant spark of light
That all you can say
(of course not, you know better) No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way
Oh
Anything else
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha
only yes and no
(it dawns) You're a bit
(hippie) For sure
where's your program
Won't it miss you
(confused) No
Flynn eyes the bit cautiously
'm your program
(emphatic) Right on the money
(sighs) Another mouth to feed
you don't by any chance know how to drive this crate
In answer, the Bit moves toward the center of the cabin where a platform supports a four-foot tube with a crossbar
Flynn follows, stares at the setup for a moment, then steps onto the platform and grabs the cross-bar
(
) Like so
Before the Bit can answer, Flynn's power flows into the Recognizer, and it takes off like a bat out of hell 297-298                                                          297-298 299
299 heading for the city
It lurches forward unevenly, crashing drunkenly into a wall and bouncing off another one
300
300 Way to go
We're haulin'
Yes, okay, exactement
301-302                                                          301-302 303
303 This is the building Tron was eyeing when we left him
We see him inside now, in a corridor, passing a large opening which gives views of partially completed structures: an aircraft carrier, a strange elongated craft that resembles a sailboat on its side
All composed partially of glowing lines, and partially of flat smooth surfaces
We see several female programs working in these rooms
This building only has female workers, but they are all pale and listless, no interest in anything, staring at their feet as they shuffle along
Tron looks farther down the corridor
: 304                                                         304 We see a file of the female workers coming down the corridor towards Tron
: 305                                                           305 as he moves back against the wall, into a niche
As the first girl passes his vantage-point, his hand flashes out and grabs her around the mouth, yanking her back into the niche with him
The line of workers mechanically files on past
We watch from the rear of the niche, as Tron holds the girl against his chest until all the workers are gone
She struggles feebly, half-heartedly
'm not gonna hurt you
She stops struggling
(
) 'm going to let you go now
don't scream, or 'll be very sorry
His hands loosen, and he releases her
: 306                                                306 We see the faint pale image of the girl from full face for the first time
She looks tired and uninterested
Her face
is Lora's face, still beautiful in its pallor
Put your hand behind your back
Slowly she obeys
307    -                                               307 slow smile appears on his face
308                                                 308 He extends his own hand to touch hers, palm to palm
As contact is made, a rich glow appears between the two hands, strengthening as we watch
look of wonder crosses her face as the energy flows into her
She turns, entwining her fingers in Tron's
She throws her arms around him
(smiling, hugging her tightly) Yori
hey
Oh, Tron
knew you'd escape
they've never built circuit that could hold you
She-looks around nervously
(pulling him by his hand) This way
Come on
They walk quickly toward a flight of stairs
: 309                                                     309 Tron and Yori are cautiously passing along the sidewalk
We can see the glowing beam of the 1/0 Tower over the tops of all the buildings, and several half-gone programs standing around
As they pass, they hear snatches of conversation

That's all going to change, Yori
How
Don't know yet

He was going to tell me how to Suddenly Yori looks up, sees something, grabs Tron's hand and pulls him back into a nearby alley
She points up in the air

: 312
'  -                               312 Tron and Yori arrive at the ground level entrance
313
313 Tron and Yori walk through long hallways and arrive at her door
She whistles and the door disappears
They step through
: 314
'                                         314 As Tron and Yori enter
The apartment appears to be a box, with one window overlooking the cityscape, and the /0 Tower
At first it looks empty, with strange murals of one dimensional furniture on the walls and floors
My quarters
Why is everything
like this
It's a flat
But wait a micro
She lays her palm on the wall near the door
The door reappears, and a glow starts to fill the room, softly, slowly
Tron looks around; the flat paintings of furniture are expanding, filling out, becoming three-dimensional
The room glows a soft rose color, becomes charming, soothing
It is still small and limited, but the light in the air and the few pieces of furniture give off a loving, seductive aura
Tron turns back to Yori, smiling, and stops
315                                                         315 With her hand still on the wall panel, she is glowing absorbing extra energy, changing
The severe work clothes metamorphosize into shimmering, diaphanous drapery, twinkling with thousands of diamond-like points of light
silvery tinkling  comes from her robes as she moves forward; her beautiful face, now surrounded by a soft mane of hair, glows with pleasure at the expression in Tron's face
She smiles lovingly, and reaches out her hand
Come here
316                                                           316 His face tells the story
The fugitive, returned from long exile, is being fully rewarded for his efforts
You're beautiful, Yori
317                                                 317 as their hands touch, and the glow springs out between their flattened palms
Tron pulls her close to him, sliding his hand up her arm, leaving a glowing trace, and her hands move up over his chest
You've grown, big program

in the games
They move together into an embrace, but their lips never touch
All the energy is transmitted through their hands
They sink down onto what looks like cushions made of stars, their glow increasing
The room fills with the brilliance of the energy they are giving each other, and we hear their sighs, as the  comes up
Each of them moves their hands over the other, moving slowly, as if they were trying to touch the other's entire body at once
They roll over and are enveloped in the cloud of stars

320-321                                                          320-321 322
322 Flynn is having trouble controlling the Reco
This honey doesn't handle so good in town
(agreeing) No, nuh-uh, never in a million years
He lays his hands from panel to panel, causing one after another to light up in a random pattern, almost with a beat, but the Recognizer only slams into another building and keeps going
The Bit starts shouting: Ix-nay
Noper
Under no conditions - Flynn looks frantically around, spies a large panel to one side that he hasn't tried yet, and slaps his palm down on it
(that's more like it) Right, confirmed,  couldn't have put it - 323
323 as the Reco screeches to a screaming stop
but the head of it, with Flynn and the Bit, breaks loose, and flies through the air, landing in what looks like a garbage dump
: 324
324 as Flynn shakily pulls himself out of the debris, the Bit nervously hovering over him
(to Bit) Catch me listening to you again
325
325 group of low resolution programs are walking by
Flynn emerges from the broken-off head, stunned, but unhurt, the Bit flying by his side
He blearily sees the passing programs, but doesn't realize they are at such a low state of consciousness that they can't see him
Hey
Hi
Hey, everything's okay
Fine
Little trouble, but we're okay
Thanks for your concern
So long
They move on
(to the Bit) This town's full o' live ones
Not a chance
328
328 Tron and Yori are crossing an open plaza-like area, on their way to the /0 Tower
They pass by more zombie-like programs and overhear bits of conversation, all in dead-sounding monotones

330                                                    330 on a long curving walkway which encircles the base of the Tower, approaching a wide door in the wall
331    '                                            331 We see that it opens onto a wide elevator platform, which is now rising upwards at a steep angle, carrying Tron and Yori smoothly and silently towards an opening in a floor a hundred feet overhead
332                                              332 looking upwards as they move
333                                                  333 as the elevator platform arrives, and they step off
We get the sense of massive, over-size ceilings, floors, windows and machinery, dwarfing the programs who come to the Tower to communicate, preparing them for the experience, as a vaulting cathedral prepared the sinner for confession
But here, everything is composed of clean, sharp, angular surfaces
On this second story there is floor and ceiling, but no outer wall, so we can still see the city-grid below and beyond
Tron and Yori cautiously move forward across the floor, heading for a door into the inner parts of the Tower
334-349                                                          334-349 350                                              350 of the /0 Tower
large, raised circular altar stands against one wall, with a darkened opening behind it
square, secondary altar supports the first, about fifty feet up a side
In the middle of the altar we see a structure of stacked, diminishing steps, the final one forming the shoulders of an armless, padded suit with a puffed headdress revealing the face of the /0 Tower priest,
His eyes are shut
His face is lined with age, but still holds a sprightly sensitivity
It is the face of Dr
Gibbs, from the laser lab in the Real world
There is a large, -shaped opening behind the altar, and the circular steps glow a hot neon, each a different color
The stripes of color thus formed bleed upwards onto the wall, lining either side of the  opening
There is only blackness beyond

352                                                   352 Tron and Yori walk toward him from an entranceway across the wide room, their footsteps
353-374                                                          353-374 375    - , ,                          375 Tron and Yori stop at the foot of Dumont's altar
(quietly) Dumont
The priest's eyes flicker open
He looks at Tron and Yori, doesn't recognize either one
Yes
(nervous) have come to communicate with my User
Hmm
difficult proposition
difficult proposition at best
(indicates empty chamber) Perhaps you've noticed
we're not exactly packing them in these days
Yes
what--
You know, not so long ago, you could've come in here and seen programs lined up all the way back to those doors, waiting for communion with their Users
The building fund was doing well too
but now
(sighs) this so-called Master Control Program is going around cutting programs off from their natural creators, grabbing all our believers and making them ride around on little motor scooters and shoot things at each other and Weiner knows what all-- oh, it's enough to give you a crisis of faith
Well  want to communicate -- Oh, you want to -- hah
could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here
They hate this tower
They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while
And you should hear the way they commune
Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it
No,  don't think you Tron steps closer, speaks quietly to Dumont
Dumont
my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again
Hah
Really
You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no  looking over your shoulder
(sighs) When you've been in the system as long as  have, you hear many promises
many reassurances
many brave plans
He pauses, sizing Tron up, considering it
Finally: (
) (falling into ritual) Who is your User, program
Alan-One
He calls me
may  pass
All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible
Dumont nods, and the neon glow fades a little
You may pass, my friend
Tron runs lightly up the steps, past Dumont, into the darkness beyond

1/0                                                376 We see Flynn and the Bit walking towards the Tower, staring curiously at the zombie-like characters on the streets
: 377
377 We see a face peer around it
Flynn
This is where Tron said he was going
Below him, at waist level, also peeking around the corner, we see the glow of the Bit
Flynn moves out from the wall and starts going down the hall, Bit following
(
) Looks like his kind of place, too
real serious
and watches him walking quickly away from us
We the sound of many feet marching as Flynn reaches the end of the corridor
He stops and glances over his shoulder

As far as he's concerned he's just going in for a final, easy kill of one renegade program who is trapped

The file of men is moving away
We can see that there is a wide ledge about ten feet up the wall, containing the lighting source
: 382                                                   382 looking down at the file of men going by
The last one passes
: 383                             383 Flynn suddenly drops down to the floor
The warrior turns snarling, lifting his staff

) All right
Flynn looks up   , finger to his lips
: 387                                    387 We can see Sark's men marching on away from us, and Flynn leaning over the warrior with the Bit hovering over him
As we watch, Flynn places both his hands on the Blue Warrior's chest
Quickly, the blue static pattern covering the guard flows into Flynn's hands up his arms, and transfers entirely to him and the warrior derezzes
: 387A The Bit, upset,  around Flynn nervously
387A Sshhh 'm still me
Just a different color

: 388                                                   388 marching fast down the corridor, after Sark

is looking up, eyes narrowed
: 390                                         390 We see that he is standing in front of the huge, closed door to the /0 Tower central chamber
The guards have formed two long rows, and Sark's lieutenant is standing by his side
That old fruitcake Dumont
he'll pay for this
: 391       '                     391 He turns
Bring in the logic probe
392                                             392 We see Tron approaching a bell-shaped structure, with the brilliant golden beam emerging from the highest point of the bell
It is surrounded by a cylinder of energy hundreds of feet in diameter
Tron walks into an opening at the base of the bell
393
393 Tron stands on the rounded rim of a dish-shaped room, the floor of which rises to a cone in the center
The top of the cone is a flat, sliced-off surface
Tron walks down into the dish, a soft, padded surface, and then climbs up to the flat, central podium
We see that this surface is round, about four feet in diameter, and glowing from within, with a complex circuit pattern embedded in it
Tron looks down, and then up
394                                                         394 The curving inner surfaces of the bell culminate in a round opening
395                                                 395 We see Tron's upturned face
He steps up on the podium, hands gripped into fists at his sides
His face is gradually filling with a deep inner excitement and anticipation, his eyes searching the space above
His expression remains still, his mouth closed and even
Only his eyes project the emotion he is feeling, burning with the knowledge of the experience to come
396      ,   ,
396 He takes out his disk, grips it in both hands and slowly raises it high above his head
He stands stiffly, willing the response to happen
At first nothing stirs
Then a splendid, radiant beam of light bursts down from the opening in the top of the bell, illuminating Tron and the disk
His hands start to shake with the force of the communication beam, and suddenly the disk is ripped from his hands, to rise, glowing brilliantly, upwards to the source of the light
397  '                                          397 filled with a quiet awe, eyes narrowed against the strong light
His hands drop to his sides
The disk rises out of sight, and we : 397                                                 397 intensifying with every second

look, before we get cut off again
In the air above Tron, images begin to materialize, shifting, transparent forms
First we see a network with pinpoints of light at each intersection; it rotates, and becomes a globe, with a bright light at the center
We see one of the intersection lights become very bright, and the others dim

The beam continues to bathe Tron in its glow, and gradually we see an object emerging from the glow
The disk
It slowly descends, Tron raises his hands to catch it, gripping it, pulls it down and stares at it
: 405   -                                                 405 It is glowing with a new power
Superimposed on its surface is a complex mandala pattern, changing kaleidoscopically as we watch, shifting swirling liquid color

Behind Dumont stands Tron, framed in the entry to the Communication chamber
409                                                           409 410                                                   410 He is rising from the altar, the rest of his body emerging from the neon steps, until he is standing in front of Tron
We see that he has on a floor-length robe with huge shoulder pads forming winglike supports for the fabric

It is time for the new order to begin

As we watch, Tron comes forward, and grips Dumont's shoulder briefly
Then he holds out his hand to Yori

-                                        412 We see it is almost transparent, and as we watch, there is a burst of energy and the door disappears into thousands of sparkling dots of light

Framed in the center of the opening, stands Sark

The blue warriors race by him, pouring into the chamber
: 414    -                                           414 We see Dumont standing on the top of the steps, no sign of Tron and Yori
The guards spread out through the room, Sark strides towards Dumont
Where's the program

there's a simulation we can use

418         ,             419 ,
419         ,            419 We see that this vessel is a simulation of a futuristic spacecraft, designed for travel in the Real world using solar energy, with an enormous metallic sail to catch the rays of sunlight like wind, and move with the speed of light
The sail is at the bow of the craft, and a long, slender walkway connects it with the deck area, which is made up of several connected flattened box-shapes, giving it the look of a dragonfly
In this world, the Sailer catches data transmission beams instead of sunlight, and is propelled along the information paths to the Central Processing Unit
Can it carry us
0
The design is good
We don't know why the User abandoned the project
The elevator platform brings Tron and Yori through the center, forming part of the deck as it reaches a level position, locked into place
420        ,            420 We see Yori bending over a console of touch panels

As we watch, a head leans into the frame from the right
memory guard
Then we see a hand gripping a staff, and the legs of another guard on the left
: 423                                      423 On the console, as Yori leans over it
We see that she is looking at a map of the system, a flat grid, and on it, in miniature, are the beam transfer points and transmission location
: 424    ,                        424 silently
We can see Tron's back as he hears a noise
His head snaps up; he sees the guards

We see Tron move forward and then stop, letting them come
: 431  '  -                                         431 looking down at the walkway
Beyond it we can see the great door starting to rise
432                                                           432 throwing his disk
It smashes into the guards in front, tossing them backwards
: 433                                433 The great door is almost all the way up
We can see the Sail with its tip ready to emerge
Below, on the ground, more guards are racing towards the hangar
434                                                           434 Beating back the guards, tossing them over the side of the walkway
We see one last guard standing on top of the bunker that forms the connection of the craft to the sail
Tron advances on him
the guard stares at him, then looks down
then jumps off, intimidated
There's a sudden lurch forward, and Tron is thrown back, losing his balance
435                                                           435 smiling
We're off
436
436 The transmission beam is flowing, passing directly through the craft, from behind, hitting the sail bunker, and passing through, so that it looks like a headlight
The Sailer starts moving, fast, accelerating so that it reaches a tremendous velocity in a matter of seconds
437
-  -  &                   437 Back on the bridge of the carrier, Sark is in the  hologram
In front of him, we see a view of the city below, and the hangar, and the Solar Sailer -- racing away
hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark
wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator
maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year
Now, sir
We did take care of that User you sent us -- Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation
We'll get them, sir
These things take time
don't have time, Sark
And neither do you
End of line
438-439                                                          438-439 440    -  -                                 440 from the stern
Tron picks himself up from the floor where he was thrown when the Sailer took off, and heads for Yori (at the camera)
He stops, seeing something
Tron, are you all right
Tron waves at her
then
441                                     441 He looks over at the guard rail
: 442  '                                                    442 fingers gripping the rail
on the fingers
: 443                                       443 Several yards away from it
We see one of the blue warriors hanging on, trying to get a leg up on the rail, and we see Tron race to the edge, look over and see this guard
444                                                444 By the rail with the blue arms and head in the shot
Tron raises his disk to slam into the intruder, when suddenly a spherical glowing shape comes into the frame from bottom right
(buzzing around Tron's head like a fly) No way, not on your life, no siree
Nothing doing, forget it
: 445    '                                        445 Flynn
: 446  '                                             446 Who looks down, really seeing the face below for the first time
Flynn
447                                             447 Greetings, program
(dumbfounded) You're alive
Yeah,
oops
He loses his grip, and starts to fall
But Tron, just in time, grabs Flynn's wrist and starts to pull him up
We see the blue static guard disguise fade off Flynn
449                                                           449 leaning over the control console anxiously, watching Tron come up the steps towards her with Flynn and the Bit
450                                                      450 As they reach her
(nervously) Who is this
We see Flynn look at Yori and silently mouth "Lora" in surprise
but then realize his mistake
(smiling) Flynn
(he turns to Flynn eagerly) Where's Ram
'm sorry, Tron
he's
he didn't make it
Tron shakes his head, sadly
(to Yori) This is Flynn
the one who busted me out
(to Flynn) Then  owe you some thanks
No big deal
ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine
mean,  did write the program for it
(mystified) Wrote the
It's time  levelled with you, Tron
'm a -- well, 'm what you guys call a User
Tron and Yori are stunned and awed
User -- in our world
(nods) Guess  took a wrong turn somewhere
But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan
(laughs) You wish
Man,  haven't had a second to think since  got down here
mean in here
Out here
Whatever
Then
Look, you guys know how it is
You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but -- hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too
Stranger and stranger
You said it
(pats Tron on back) So
Nice ship you got here
What's our next move
(smiles) Remember you wanted to pay a call on the
Flynn nods
(
) We're on our way

Thank God
Alan stayed awake, at least
451                                                       451 The aircraft carrier rolls past the camera

Sir, what do you want done with the tower guardian, Dumont
Put him with the others
No, bit brain
Sark turns to face him
Prepare him for inquisition
need a little relaxation
But first rez up the carrier for pursuit
And one other thing
lie stares at the lieutenant, paranoid (continuing) Don'tthink anymore
do the thinkingaround here
453                                 453 speeding through the System, right on target

Yori is at the controls, with Tron beside her, his arm around her shoulders, looking at Flynn
What about our friend - Sark
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky
lot of illusions
rough navigating
Programs have a way of just
disappearing here
Not us,  hope
(shakes his head, indicates disk) Not with this disk
'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori
You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs
He moves off down the walkway, the Bit following
Flynn turns and leans out over the side
Boy the view from up here
you know the territory
little
(points out sights) Over there, the Mountains of Data

(sadly) The  blasted it
There are very few domains left with any power at all
Lousy utility companies
they're the same wherever you go
456-461                                                          456-461 462
462 Where we see Dumont plugged into energy foot sockets
Two memory guards stand by his side holding their staffs against his chest
Dumont's face is wracked with pain, his robe torn, but his expression is full of determination
As we watch, another blast of torturous energy comes from the boots, and his face contorts to the second level where we see Sark looking down into the pit that is Dumont's cell

: 468                                        466 We see Tron at the bow
Flynn and Yori are up on the deck near the controls, with the Bit hovering over them
Yori is, pointing something out to Flynn
469  '                                                   469 reacting to the sight of something ahead of the Solar Sailer
470                                            470 We see the transmission beam which carries the Solar Sailer increasing in brightness, throbbing with a pulse of mad glowing energy, coming towards the ship
It hits the sail, and the ship shivers
The whole beam is now tripled in brightness
: 471
-                471 As Tron runs up to Yori's side
He grabs her shoulder, pulling her against him
they have to shout to be heard above the noise of the increasing beam
(shouting) What is it
Power surge
the transmission beam's too strong
We have to get off this beam
(frantic) can't
There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds
472                                                           472 473                                                       473 The ship is throbbing and jerking, bits of it de-rezzing
474                                              474 Flynn looks around, points to one side
There's another beam
It's too far
Flynn suddenly looks to the bow of the ship, makes a decision, and races forward
: 475   D0WN  ,                           475 We see Flynn race to the bow, where the horrendous power of the beam is blasting away at the sails
He slows down, but keeps going
: 476  '                                                   476 Watching - Where's he going

The beam connection
but he'll be de-rezzed
: 478       ,                   478 We see Flynn emerge, leaning out into the beam, his face brilliantly illuminated by the beam
He reaches forward with one arm
: 479  '                                                  479 Entering the beam
: 480                                             480 He is lying spread eagled at the bow, with one arm in the light
He raises his other arm and points at the beam which was so close, but too far to reach
Suddenly his whole body glows with the same intensity as the beam
: 481                                                    481 Shielding their eyes from the light
: 482                                             482 His body glowing, arm outstretched
Suddenly another beam blasts out from his arm
: 483                                                       483 We see the new beam from Flynn's arm flash over to the neighboring transmission beam and connect
We see the ship pulsing, and then breaking free of the old beam, following the new path, and connecting to the safe beam
The craft starts to travel safely on its way

: 486                                                     486 Carrying Flynn towards the stern, carefully, gingerly with Yori watching
: 487                                                      487 as they reach the deck in front of Tron, as he holds Flynn
We can see Yori's anxious face to one side
Flynn's head comes up for a moment, dazed
(weakly) Did we make it
Yes
Flynn smiles weakly
Hooray for our side
He faints

Hey
you guys
(nods) How about you
Aah, 'm fine
little hung over is all
How did you do that, Flynn
(sitting up) Elementary physics
a beam of energy can always be diverted
ooh, my head (looks around -- to Yori) Are we there yet, Mommy
Almost
just have to adjust our course at the next junction
'd better go check the instruments

Quietly, Yori

Flynn looks down at his hands and turns away, leaning against the wall
He's dead

He's a User, Dumont
He came to our world
trying to help us
Her voice breaks, she turns away
(despairing) If the Users can no longer help us
His voice trails off
Suddenly, a stronger  flashes on in the cell, the door opens, and we see Sark standing there, framed in the cell door
So
we have erased the program that - As he catches sight of Flynn, his voice falters
(
) You
No
Flynn looks up curiously

Not me, boss
Well
we can take care of that soon enough

The top edge of the cliff is encrusted with irregular shapes and the pod is headed for one opening among the shapes, fitting itself neatly in between so that it becomes a part of the structure

549 There is a minor jolt and Sark lays his palm on another panel
From the rear wall of the pod we see the entire front wall rising slowly
Sark and his lieutenant stand by either side of the door, and we gradually are given a view of the , two or three miles away at the center of the plain ahead
The structure is a series of gleaming black blades, forming a great cylinder, and the communication beam rises out of the center of this cylinder

She is de-rezzing too
Her whole body becoming transparent
She looks up dimly at Flynn, with no expression

Their faces are very close as he stares down, terrified that he is too late to save her
Her eyes are half-closed

Flynn bends closer, their lips almost touch
Suddenly her eyes widen as her form returns to solidarity, and color floods back into her
Her mouth opens in wonder and she looks up at Flynn
He pulls a little away from her, still holding her
(in awe) You
you brought me back
Why
How
Flynn lets go of her
'm gonna need your help
Hey, Bit
He looks around, spots a small glow in one corner of the cell, runs to it and stoops down, cupping the glow in his hands
It wavers
Flynn wills his energy back into it, frowning with concentration
Suddenly the Bit pops into life
Yes
Let's get outta here
They head for the door

its arm is raised, and
the disk slams back into the hand

Moving forward, through the entrance, the  is finally revealed
giant cylinder, a hundred feet high, with a network of circuit lines, and stretched across all the visible surface

Flattened, stretched, bizarrely distorted, the face is capable of moving to any section of the-cylinder
The impression is similar to the look of a grotesquely fat person's face, but more so
It's horrible
Beneath the floating cylinder face two inverted cones of light, meeting at their apex, support it
We continue moving forward, the  looming over us
Then the and the doomed programs file past us, separating and going to the inner walls

They are sucked back, pinned, immobile, and we see them starting to de-rez
You're very lucky, all of you
You are participating in the creation of the single most powerful program in the history of the system

It is de-rezzing, parts of it gone already
We see the  approaching, as the carrier rises

His back is to the camera
Sark turns, curious, eyes widen incredulously

573                                                  573 as the disk races at Tron
He dodges, drops to one knee and ducks under it
Sark's disk circles like a homing missile and attacks again
Tron deflects the second attack with his own disk, and the two meet with an explosion of light
Sark's disk ricochets off and races away, back to Sark
We see Tron throw his own weapon

575                                                       575 as Yori runs to Flynn's side and-peers down
576    -                                               576 tears of joy streaming down her face
577                                                         577 the fight continuing
577A   -                                         577 Flynn, we've got to help him
Let's get some power here
His hands, laying on the control console, begin to send forth great pulses of glowing energy into the carrier
: 578                                                        578 Sark's face
You are very persistent, Tron
579
579 Tron's disk circles Sark, attacking twice
Sark deflects it and immediately throws his own disk
580                                               580 racing almost side by side through the air
581                                                     581 as the two disks come at him
'm also better than you
He leaps into the air, grabs his own disk, pulling his legs up as Sark's disk passes under him
582    '                                           582 Making a sharp turn in the air
583                                           583 He looks over his shoulder, sees the disk coming at him
584  '                                                   584 As he slams his own disk into Sark's, using his as a shield
584A
584A Very clever, Tron
You know you should have joined me
585                                                    585 Tron hurls again
586                                                   586 Flynn is at the controls, transferring power
Any response
It's starting She looks down at the battle
Her hand reaches over and grips Flynn's tightly
: 587                                                           587 He catches his own disk, spots Tron's coming at him right behind, and holds up his own disk as a shield
We would have made a great team
588  '                                                   588 turning sideways in its flight, edge on
589                                                           589 With a  and explosion of light, Tron's disk cuts right through Sark's disk, and on through Sark's head
The disk shatters, and we see Sark's surprised face, hands still in position to hold the disk
a jagged open slash right through his forehead
We can see energy pouring out of this wound like blood
590                                                     590 Sark falls, dead, face first
591                                                        591 592                                                           592 wailing past Sark's body
593                                             593 as he goes in the 's inner chamber
(before he sees Tron) It is very good that you
594                                                        594 595                                                     595 framed in the doorway
don't think it is good for you,
596                                                      596 Sark
How have you allowed this program to 597                                                        597 598                                             598 Sark's out
Would you like to leave a message
am the message
The only message
Sark
Tron throws his disk
It's deflected off the base of the , and returns to him
(continuing) As Tron is preparing to throw again he notices Dumont and races over to him
599    -                                             599 Dumont is transparent
Tron runs up to him
(trying to pull Dumont away from wall) Dumont
No
Tron
must
destroy first
Dumont
Where's Yori
Where's Flynn
(very weak) They may be
de-rezzed
on the carrier
hurry
600
-                                              600 He turns, murder in his eyes, draws back his arm for the throw
Program
stop
This is not allowed
Tron throws
601                                                      601 The disk smashes into him
Once, twice
will not allow this Sark
(thundering) The voice reverberates, shaking the chamber
Tron continues to throw
602                                                        602 603                                                         603 Sark's dead hand
We see the circuit pattern of the mesa top begin to glow around the hand, throbbing with energy
The hand moves
604                                                           604 throwing again at the , hitting, catching his disk again
(thundering) 605                                                           605 His body is glowing, expanding
He starts to rise, his face looks up
606    -                                               606 It is vacant, staring with white eyes
His head still has the gaping hole in the forehead
He's a zombie, the living dead
He rises
607                                                       607 Carrier floating over the , near the 's beam
Flynn looks out, from side to side, quickly assessing the possibilities
He spots the beam
608                                                        608 609                                                   609 very close
610                                             610 Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it
(going to controls) Why
What are you going to do
(staring down) Jump
Yori looks up
But
won't you be de-rezzed
(turns to her) Probably
611
-                                               611 about to fire again
There's a sudden roar and Tron turns
612  '                                         612 Who rips open the doorway into the  and advances
613                                                         613 Yori has steered them right next to the beam
She turns to Flynn, goes up to him
Flynn
you can't (lays finger on her lips) Shhhhh
He takes her in his arms
(
) (whispering) 'm sure Tron wouldn't mind if
just once
His head bends down and their lips meet
Yori's body begins to glow, change, metamorphosize until she has the same appearance as in the love scene with Tron, sparkling and gorgeous
Her eyes are closed
614    -                                         614 Finally Flynn pulls away from her
Her eyes stay shut for a second, then open
Don't worry
615                                                     615 He releases her, steps to the edge of the observation port, poises on the brink, and then leaps off, directly in the beam
We see Yori shakily grip the edge of the port and lean out
616                                                         616 Flynn is diving through space in the beam, falling in slow motion directly into the center of  itself
617
617 Sark is much bigger than before, advancing on Tron
He speaks, but his voice is that of the
/ End of line, program
We can see the  in the b
g
Suddenly there is an explosion of static, as Flynn falls into the
We see a weird 2- image of Flynn's face circling in the cylinder with the  as they battle
Sark falters, stumbles, distracted by this, and Tron ducks under him and hurls the code disk for the last time
It circles the  once, and then hurtles straight for the target, the apex of the energy cones
And connects
618                                                  618 brilliant explosion of lights bursts out
619                                                     619 Dead face wracked with the pain of a second death
He begins to melt into a column of pure energy, dissipating completely
620                                                   620 We see something materializing in the apex of the energy cones
It is dressed like Dumont was at the /0 Tower, an old man in the padded altar costume, spinning, slowly, finally stopping
We see the wizened, wrinkled face of the true  for just a few seconds, and see that he is furiosly  on an old Remington portable
Then he too dissolves into liquid energy, and disappears
The cylinder of the  glows brighter and brighter
621                                                  621 on the bridge of the carrier looking down at this
622                                                         622 fountain of energy explodes upwards like a Supernova, right at the camera
623                                                           623 shielding her face from the power of the blast
624                                                       624 The nova of energy bursting upwards
We start to see the glow returning to the surrounding domains, as the nova dissipates, leaving the sky full of sparkling stars
625                                                           625 still shielding her eyes, but looking out in wonder at the domains regaining their life
626                                                         626 one domain after another, scattered around the horizon, glows brightly, increasing
627                                                       627 The carrier starts to descend
: 628
-                                          628 Leading Dumont out of the chamber with several of the other guardian programs that were saved
He looks up, spots the carrier descending
629                                                  629 Basically all that is left of it is the bridge, with only a very faint image of the rest of the body
It lands on the mesa
630
630 Tron catches Yori as she jumps down
He hugs her close and looks at her, about to speak
But she reaches up and presses her lips to his in a quick, intense kiss
Then pulls back
(laughing) Nice
It's something Users do
Where's Flynn
He looks up at the bridge
He's gone
He went into the beam
He saved you
He saved all of us
Tron stares at her, holding onto her shoulders
Then he looks up at the sky, thoughtfully
She also looks up
He really was a User
(quietly, sadly) Yes
631                                           631 of the landscape, glowing again with new life, every / Tower a shining beacon, a symbol of the new found freedom of communication
: 632                                    632 and returning to the real world
633     -                                     633 on the business end of the huge laser in 's lab
bright blast of  shoots out of the mechanism
the laser pouring its light onto the floor, near the chair where Flynn was sitting when he was digitized
Slowly -- in a reverse of his disappearance -- Flynn's  takes shape on the floor
As the laser shuts off, he is revealed intact -- back in his real-world body and clothes
and as bewildered to find himself here as he was when he first arrived in the electronic world
He studies his hands -- and  that they're now nonluminescent flesh and blood
He looks out the window and  that it's shortly past dawn, with weak sunlight coming in
And, at the  of light  at work, he turns to look at Lora's computer terminal, where a hard-copy computer  is coughing out a long document on wide blue paper
Flynn gets up off the floor, goes over to the printer, and  the document
As he does so, his eyes widen, and a  appears on his face
The printer finishes its run, clicks patiently
Flynn, exuberant, tears the printout from the machine and rushes to the door with it
: 634
'  -                              634 Bleary but excited, they gaze happily at the information on Alan's screen as Flynn bursts into the room, waving his printout
Hey -- you guys Before he can say anything more, Alan turns to greet him, holding up a seven-inch computer software   in its cardboard sleeve
Flynn
made it
worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running
know,  met him
Alan and Lora look at him -- the same sort of mystified look he got from Tron and Yori in the other world
He checks himself
(
) mean,  saw it read-up - hey, look at this
He shows them the printout
It takes Alan and Lora a few seconds of reading it to figure out its significance
Your old files --
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on
Oh, that is beautiful
You've got the goods
Flynn folds up the printout, puts it in his pocket
Alan and Lora get up, stretch, start wandering slowly toward the door with him
You're telling me
As they talk,   over to Alan's color   and on it
635                                                      635 The lines of printed information that had filled it up wipe off, and are replaced by a number of shapes very much like the ones in a typical video game: , poised on a   -- resembling the  in the electronic world
And
They move randomly at first, then converge on the blue figure from three different directions

The yellow rockets all hit the blue mesa at the same time
It in typical video-game fashion -- radiating lines of blue The yellow rockets fly away from it and form a vertical formation, heading together toward the side of the  screen as we Flynn, Lora, and Alan heading for the door
(
) Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games
cheap
(
) You're getting out of the business
(
) Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled
(
0

at the  of the  to Alan's office closing
