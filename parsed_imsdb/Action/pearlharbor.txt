- by Randall Wallace by Randall Wallace Out of  we hear the sound of an airplane roaring by
Flying over American heartland
We see the earth through the pilot's perspective as sky and ground swap positions, the plane swooping down and storming over the ground
is a biplane, racing over a field lush with young plants
It releases a trail of crop spray, and climbs again
Up into a crystalline blue sky where sunshine pours like honey over family farms stretching to the horizon
Maybe it's not heaven, maybe it's just Tennessee
But as long as there's been an America, men have fought and died for this place -- as volunteers
Far off, but visible from the plane is - The barn is unpainted except for hand lettering that says "McCawley Crop Dusting
" Another plane noise, this one made by kids, brings us to  , sitting in the shell of an old plane propped on crates, scavenged of it's engine, seats, and wheels
The boys sit in it's cockpit, butts crowded onto the nail keg they've replaced the seat with
They've even attached a 2x4 as propeller, as if their imaginations needed any help
They wear overalls and have bowl haircuts:   and , 10 years old
Bandits at 2 o'clock
Power dive
They buzz their lips in a flying noise and work the controls, Rafe's bare feet on one pedal, Danny's on the other
It's Germans
Kill the bastards
Rafe looks at Danny in shock -- then they both laugh and go right back into their game, manufacturing their own machine gun and engine sounds
Good shooting, Danny
Good shooting, Rafe
Land of the free
Home of the brave
There's another one
Their vocal motors roar again
But a man's hand grabs Danny by the straps of his overalls and jerks him from the cockpit
It's Danny's  and he's a fearsome sight; drunk, his hair uncombed, his face unshaven, his teeth -- those still left -- are rotting
He's also missing an arm; but the one that's left is potent, and he's shaking Danny with it
' You no count boy
Johnson come lookin', said he'd pay a dime for you to shovel his pig shed, and  can't find you no place
Daddy,  told you  was comin' here
His father slaps him off his feet
Rafe is so horrified he can't get a sound out
Danny isn't even surprised
But when his father snatches him up again, twisting the overall straps so tight they choke him, he struggles
It does no good; his father starts marching across the field, dragging and strangling Danny
Da
Dad
The father's drunken anger makes him oblivious -- until The 2x4 propeller slams him across the back, knocking him to the ground and making him drop Danny
The father rolls over to see 10-year-old Rafe, holding the 2x4 like a bat
Let him alone
The father's eyes bulge in rage; he struggles to his feet
Rafe
Daddy
No
The man looks murderous, but Rafe draws back the board
'll bust you open, you
German
The words ring something deep in the man's booze-broken brain
He begins to cough, convulsively; it brings a blossom of blood to his mouth
He wipes it with his hand, but blood clings to his teeth
He chokes out -- ' fought the Germans
He looks at Danny in shame, with the realization of what he's just done
He turns and staggers away
Danny looks at Rafe -- a communication between boys joined by something deeper than blood
Then Danny runs off after his father
Daddy
Daddy
Wait
Danny catches him, takes his father's hand, and walks away with him
The crop duster we saw in the air has just landed, behind Rafe
The pilot, ' , shuts off the engine
' What's goin' on, son
Nothing
Danny's Dad just come to get him
Rafe turns back to the ramshackle plane and replaces the 2x4 propeller
His father looks toward Danny and his father, walking away, then looks at his own son
' Hey, boy -- you wanna go up
Rafe can't believe it; he runs to the plane and hops into his father's lap
As his father cranks the engine and tucks him into the harness, Rafe says -- Daddy, sometime will you take Danny up too
' Sure will, son
The engine races to life
and we -- : - American -40 fighters blast through the air, props screaming and wind singing by their wings
There are eight pilots in their individual seats, and we focus on two:    has grown lean and handsome
And   is very much the same
Their planes start swapping positions in the formation; while the other guys are flying along in a tight line, Rafe and Danny are playing, one of them gunning his engine to go high, the other diving and coming back up in his place, leapfrogging
It scares the other guys, having their planes flashing in and out, so close
The  , watching through binoculars on the ground, talks into his  -- McCawley
Walker
Cut that out
thought this was a training flight
'm just trying to give Danny some training
Not on your best day, boy
Rafe grins and guns his plane low, in the opposite direction he was moving before
Danny reacts almost instantly
leapfrogging in the opposite direction, scaring the piss out of everybody else
That's it, get into a wedge
The squadron responds, forming up into a tight , Rafe and Danny just behind and on either side of the center
Didn't you say test the limits
Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the cause  got  limits in the air
Rafe grins, loving the challenge
Then he and Danny do the leapfrogging maneuver laterally, swapping sides in the
Everybody down
- The planes land in tight order and taxi off the runway; shut down their props, slide back the canopies and hop down
We see young pilots we'll get to know:  , ,
Where are McCawley and Walker
-     - They've circled to opposite ends of the airfield and are now heading right at each other, like two bullets playing chicken
Aw shit
From Rafe and Danny's , the rush is awesome
watch in awe as the -40's get so close they can't possibly get out of each other's way
Billy, the most boyish-faced of the pilots, yells to drown out the sound of the collision
At the last instant, both planes snap a quarter turn so that their wings are vertical, and they shoot past each other belly to belly
Rafe and Danny burst out laughing
laugh and congratulate each other
You know what they say
You can take the crop duster out of the country -- but don't put him in a -40
Rafe banks to land, and Danny tucks in behind him
Danny has Rafe's plane in his sights
If  had guns 'd be chewing up your -- Rafe feints left, banks right, and appears behind Danny
If you had guns, you'd be pissin' on 'em
They're almost to the landing strip, Rafe behind Danny
But as Danny's wheels are about to touch, he guns his engine and snaps the nose of his plane straight up
stop laughing
He's doing an inside loop
Aw, shit
Danny pulls it off, just barely making a full circle to come in behind Rafe and bounce to a stop on the runway
Yee-hawww
Danny taxis his plane over to join the others
He's grinning as he slides back his cockpit cover; then -- Where's Rafe
Red, tall with flaming orange hair, tips his chin toward the air
Seeing Rafe's plane still in the air, Danny starts to refasten his harness
You're down, Walker
That's an order
What about him
He's not taking my orders anymore
Danny's just about to ask what the hell that means, when he notices Rafe climbing in a deliberate spiral
He's gonna do it
Do what
It
(beat) Aw, shit
Aw shit shit shit
'  reaches two thousand feet, just a speck above them, and seems to pause in the air
shouldn't'a done an inside loop
shouldn't'a done an inside loop
Why
Cause now he's gonna do an outside loop
Aw shit
Aw shit shit shit
Anthony and Billy join in, like an involuntary chant -- & Aw shit shit shit
,   , is tightly controlled, yet serene
He noses the plane into a power dive
The -40 screams toward the ground, picking up speed, going so fast it begins to shudder
are transfixed
Red is so nervous he can't get the words out
Aw sh- sh- sh- sh- Shit
Yeah
You can do it, Rafe
You can do it
The -40, hurtling toward the ground at nauseating speed, snaps into a half roll, streaking upside down over the runway
Rafe hangs inverted in his flight harness, the asphalt of the runway shooting past, ten feet beyond his head
He pushes the plane into a climb, his cockpit on the outside of the circle
The plane reaches the top of its arc, and almost stalls; but Rafe noses it over again, toward the earth, only this time he has very little altitude
The plane hurtles down, still with it belly on the inside of the curve
And makes it full circle
Rafe's head now is barely a foot off the asphalt as the plane shoots past, still inverted
burst into cheers
,    permits himself a smile
He lands, and the guys run out to meet him
all except for the Training Captain, who stands there shaking his head
Danny jumps on the wing, as Rafe stops and slides back his canopy
Danny grabs him by the harness and shakes him
You could've killed yourself, you stupid bastard
He dives into the cockpit, hugging Rafe
That was the most beautiful thing  ever saw
'  - , mid-forties, is commander of the base
He's as tough as he is good in the air
And right now he's frowning at Rafe McCawley, standing at attention before him
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it
Don't get smart with me, son
Never, Sir
just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit
And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, did it to say thanks
To honor you, Sir
What the French call a "homage
" That's bullshit, son
But it's really good bullshit
Thank you, Sir
Doolittle stands, moves around his desk, and shakes Rafe's hand
Good luck over there McCawley
admire your decision
Thank you, Sir
-  - The pilots are getting slicked up for a night on the town
Danny's at the mirrors with the others; he's putting on cologne, and looks terrific in his uniform
Anthony and Billy are combing their hair at the sinks
Billy declares to his image in the mirror -- You good-lookin' sumbitch
don't you die
That's your line for tonight, ya know
What, good-lookin' sumbitch
No, numbnuts, die
You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and don't know what'll happen
But if  die tomorrow,  wanna know that we lived all we could tonight
"  've never known it to fail
Red finishes brushing his teeth at the sink beside them
He's n-never known it to work, either
The guys head out laughing, running into Rafe coming in
Doolittle didn't kill you
Attaboy
Rafe catches Danny's arm
Danny, there's something  gotta tell you
- Rafe and Danny are walking on the parade ground; the other guys are already on the bus that will take them into town
Danny's upset by what Rafe just told him
How could you do this
The Colonel helped me work it out
don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it
'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots
Don't make this a joke, Rafe
You're talking about war, and  know what war does to people
Danny, you know how many times  saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother
or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit
You've made your sacrifice, Danny
It's time  made mine
(from the bus) The nurses are waiting
Let's go
Nah, you go on
have to talk to Evelyn
And  want you to meet her
Some other time
don't feel like a party
Danny walks away
The bus driver's ready to leave, and Red is honking the horn for Rafe to come
Rafe reluctantly lets Danny go, and heads for the bus, where the pilots are chanting -- Nurses
Nurses
Nurses
- The trains of 1942 have their own beauty, with felt seats, shaded lamps, and paneled compartments even in the economy section
But the glow of the train is outshone by She's one of ten young women, Army nurses, gathered at one end of the car as it rattles along the track
The other nurses are pretty and ripe -- maybe a bit too ripe
Their lips painted bright red, their faces powdered, their spirits high
Evelyn listens in amusement to , a cute blonde with unmissable boobs, and , a burnette equally endowed
Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform
You mean hiding them
Hide them
On a date with pilots
'm talking about how you make them show
, another nurse, speaks up
Loan 'em to me, 'll make 'em show
The boobs or the pilots
The girls laugh and shove each others' knees; it's a party wherever they go
But Evelyn can't keep her mind on the frivolity
She looks out the window and her thoughts drift away
We'll ask Evelyn
Evelyn
Evelyn
Ooo, she's thinking of her date
Come on, you've been dating a pilot
We want to know what we can expect
Suddenly all the girlish faces are looking at Evelyn
've been dating one pilot
And only for a few weeks
But  know he's different from all the others
Sandra throws up her arms and swoons onto her friends
True love
Morphine, give her morphine
Give her an enema
But  do have a warning for you
There's one line you all need to know, and you're likely to hear it from any man in a uniform
It goes like this:  "Honey, Baby
We never know what's gonna happen, and  may die tomorrow
so, let's live all we can tonight
" silence among the nurses
tell you
Any one of those arrogant, leather-jacketed, slick-lookin' flyboys tries that line on me
he's gonna get anything he wants
As the nurses laugh -- - Our pilots -- indeed leather-jacketed and handsome -- are waiting on the platform
Among then is Rafe, holding something behind his back, as the train pulls in and shudders to a stop, clouds of steam jetting onto the platform and giving the moment a dream-like haze
/
-     - The nurses start stepping out; both pilots and nurses pretend surprise to see each
At the door of the train, Evelyn whispers to Betty -- Stick with me, 'll find you somebody good
Betty spot's Rafe
'll take that one
He's taken
But come on, 'll introduce you
They move to Rafe; he crosses the platform to meet them, his eyes holding Evelyn
Hello, Lieutenant
Good to see you
You too, Lieutenant
Betty clears her throat
Oh, this is Betty
Nice to meet you, Betty
He draws his hand from behind his back; he's holding two roses
He hands one to Evelyn and the second to Betty
Danny would'a brought this
He escorts them along the platform
Danny's not coming
No, he
got some news today
He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight
was hoping to meet him
was hoping to meet him
We'll just have to find a substitute, won't we
Betty stops, and faces Rafe
just want to tell you one thing
If you're thinking this might be your last night on earth
'm prepared to make it meaningful
(leaning close) Very meaningful
At ease, Betty
- It's a party in full swing; swing music, jitterbugging, beautiful young men and women in high spirits
Rafe and Evelyn are sitting at a big table with the other pilots and nurses
Anthony's paired up with Sandra, Billy with Barbara, and Red, shyest of the group, finds himself next to Betty
Betty's already found a companion in Red Strange
He, 'm -Red
Red -Strange
Red
Strange
You know the football player, Red - Grange
Well the guys called me -Red, cause you know, 'm red
and they thought  was strange, so, you know, Red -Grange, Red Str-Strange
But
they called you Strange
Because of Red Grange
don't get it
Was Red Grange strange
How would  know
Beside her beer is an open ketchup bottle; he picks it up and swigs from that
Rafe and Evelyn see this, and try to keep from laughing
Do you always stutter
Only when 'm n-n-n- Nervous
Yeah
But if  have to get something out,  c-can always s-s-s- (he sings) She covers his hand with hers
Don't be nervous
Red looks at Betty with love in his eyes
Under the table, Rafe and Evelyn join hands too
There shipping us out
Hawaii
The Germans are overrunning Europe, and we're sent to paradise
How about you
Have you heard anything
He hesitates; then Evelyn is distracted by the conversation beside them, between Barbara and Billy
You're a very special woman, and
well baby, they're training me for war, and we don't know what happens tomorrow
So we gotta make tonight special
Barbara shoots a look at Evelyn, before she answers
hope you can back that up, flyboy
Cause you're not ever gonna forget tonight
She takes him by the hand and pulls him to his feet
They start dancing, sexy movements that won't stop till they've been in bed
Rafe pulls Evelyn to her feet, and leads her through the dancers, outside
- They find a quiet place on a balcony that overlooks the river, and Manhattan beyond
Evelyn takes in the view, breathes in the air; she still holds the rose
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it
Or it wouldn't be so hard to say
The only reason it's hard to say is that keep thinking  don't have the right to say it
But 've got to because it's true
love you
(beat) That must surprise you
It surprises me that 'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way
The power of hearing this from each other grips them both
There's one thing  have to say
'm going away
We're all going away
'm going to the war
The real war
Hitler's taken Europe
The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine
And not just there, but here
But you're in the
Army, how could you -- Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the
They need pilots, and we need experience
leave tomorrow
You waited til tonight to tell me
had to tell you in person
Because there's something else  need to say
He studies her face, burning it into his memory
Evelyn
you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable
What  feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that
If  don't come back,  don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life
don't know if you can choose that, Rafe
Maybe not
But  need you to know love you
And  will come back
'll find a way
And then we'll get a chance to know if what  felt the first moment saw you, and every minute since then, is real
Do one thing for me, before you go
She takes his hand and leads him inside
- She leads him onto the dance floor, and they dance, among the others, yet in a world apart from everyone else
And then they stop while all the others move around them, and kiss the kind of kiss that lasts a lifetime
- The nurses are entering the hotel
Pilots are going in with them
But Rafe and Evelyn stop on the street
last kiss
Their hands touch a final time, and then part
She moves inside the lobby, and looks out the glass doors as he walks away
- Rafe and Danny stand on the platform
Rafe's got his gear packed in a bag slung over his shoulder
' All aboard
Rafe glances once more toward the revolving doors from the station that lead onto the platform
Didn't you say you told her not to come
Yeah
Then why are you looking for her
It's a test
If  asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything
If  tell her not to come, and she comes
then  know she loves me
You're still a kid, ya know that
Take care of yourself
You too
Rafe sticks his hand out to Danny
Danny knocks it away, and hugs him
Rafe steps onto the train, and it pulls away
Rafe waves
Danny waves back and smiles, but he whispers like a prayer
Give 'em hell, Rafe
- Rafe finds a seat and sits down
He's the only one in the car, and he's deeply alone
- Danny walks to one of the three revolving doors back into the station
He takes the one on the far right
As he passes through it, he doesn't see Evelyn rushing through the door on the left side
She's told herself she wouldn't come, but couldn't help it, and now as she sees the last car of the train disappearing around the corner the pain of it all hits her
She stands on the empty platform, as lonely as Rafe
- Rafe and Evelyn travel in opposite directions, toward opposite ends of the earth
, ,   - as Rafe boards a Canadian naval vessel headed into the North Atlantic
-      - Evelyn and her fellow nurses ride the train through the American southwest
The scenery outside the window is beautiful, but her thoughts are far away
- Rafe's ship is in a convoy through the rough gray waters
The deck is loaded with military supplies bound for Britain
Rafe stands among the drab crates and seems oblivious to the rain, his thoughts on Evelyn
He looks toward the eastern horizon, where his ship is heading
deep, dark storm is brewing before them
- Evelyn stands on the deck of a ship headed in the opposite direction, on another ocean, the sky is clear, the breeze is warm, the light of a glowing sunset bathes her face
The , with them heading to different ends of the earth
-  - In the eternal dusk of England, everything is cold and gray
British fighter planes -- Spitfires and Hurricanes -- are surrounded by mechanics hurriedly ripping off bullet riddled fuselage panels and digging into overworked aircraft engines
Rafe walks across the tarmac, still carrying his duffel bag
He moves up behind a slim, pale    who is surveying engine damage on one of the Spitfires
Rafe McCawley, Sir
Rafe salutes as the Air Commander turns and then returns the salute, with his left arm -- his right arm is gone
Rafe freezes at the sight, reminded of Danny's father
On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it
That's me, Sir
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley
We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter
-  - Spitfire sits on the runway, and it's badly mangled -- a string of bullet holes punched through at mid-fuselage; a shot-off chunk of wingtip; but most striking is the blood still splattered over the inside of the cockpit
Good lad
Didn't die till he'd landed and shut down his engine
Welcome to the war
He walks away, leaving Rafe to stare at the bloody cockpit
-   - Evelyn and the nurses enter the base, riding in two jeeps
As they stop at the gate, the guards look at them, especially Evelyn in the lead jeep; one guard mumbles to the other -- 've died and gone to heaven
The guards lift the bar and smile at the nurses
The jeeps drive through
The nurses are loving this island paradise already
You know the ratio of men to women on this island
Four-thousand
to one
Barbara slides on a new pair of sunglasses with plastic palm trees glued on the sides, and calls back to the guards as the jeeps pull away -- See ya on the beach, boys
- '  -  - As the other nurses happily unpack, Evelyn leaves and crosses the grass in the drenching sunshine
We follow her into -- - She finds a small, immaculately clean hospital, twenty beds with luminous white sheets, all empty
Then she notices the view
It's of Pearl Harbor, with the entire American Pacific fleet riding at anchor
Battleships all in a row
Aircraft carriers too, in perfect stillness on the aqua blue water with a white sand bottom
The view is expansive and beautiful
The sound of an approaching fighter plane with wing guns firing as we -- : - Rafe, in the middle of an aerial dogfight, throws his Spitfire into a tight turn, swinging around to fire again into a squadron of Messerschmidts; they outnumber the British planes, and they're tougher and faster
Rafe darts through their line, machine guns blazing
One of the Spitfires in Rafe's squadron has taken hits in the engine compartment and is sputtering, losing power, its pilot, , frantic as the German planes swarm into finish him
() need help
Someone get them off me
Rafe slams his control stick hard right and goes into a power dive at one of the Messerschmidts
Rafe's bullets chew up its cockpit and the plane goes into a fast corkscrew spiral, down into the water
Rafe instantly climbs again
Nigel, in the moment of safety Rafe has bought him, bails out, his chute blossoming and carrying him toward the water
The    are impressed
(into radio) Nigel's out
'll call in the position
(to himself) That Yank is bloody good
Rafe swings his plane right back at the Germans; he attacks them head on, just like he went at Danny, only this time he's firing his machine guns
And   ferocious dogfight, we hear his letter to Evelyn
'  () Dear Evelyn
It is cold here
So cold, in a way that goes deep into your bones
The Messerschmidt in Rafe's sights breaks apart with the stream of precise fire he pours into it, its prop flying into pieces, its disintegration accelerated by its airspeed
Before it completely comes apart, it explodes
Rafe goes into another tight turn, to get at them again
'  () It's not easy making friends
Two nights ago  drank a beer with a couple of the pilots -- beer's the only thing here that isn't cold -- and yesterday both of them got killed
As Rafe starts another attack we see him in the cockpit, in the trance of battle, as other Spitfires around him are getting shot out of the sky
as we -- : -   - Evelyn, receiving the letter at mail call
She sits on the grass under a palm tree, in paradise, reading his letter
'  () There is one place  can go to find warmth, and that is to think of you
-  - Evelyn is off duty, and wears a light cotton dress
She's let her hair down, and her skin has the sheen of light sweat in the tropical heat
The restaurant is barely more than a shelter of palm wood posts with a frond roof, and it looks out over the harbor
Evelyn sits alone
She's brought writing paper
As the Hawaiian waiter serves her an icy tropical ambrosia with chunks of pineapple and a fresh plumeria flower floating at the rim of the glass, she lifts her pen
But before she can start to write, three naval officers move over to her table from the bar
They're out of uniform too, wearing garish tropical shirts
1 woman beautiful as you shouldn't be sitting alone
Buy you a drink
Thank you
Ensign
The guys look at each other, impressed that she could tell
1 Ensign
Smart too
2 So how about that drink
Or dinner
Thank you, but
really want to be alone right now
3 Want to see something long and hard
He shows her the tattoo of an anchor on his forearm
Evelyn looks away from them, toward the harbor
'm sorry
've got a letter to write
3 Cold bitch
His friends start to pull him away, but Evelyn's eyes flare
What did you say
3 said you're cold
Cold
No, 'm just thinking about a war
And maybe you should be too
They leave, shaking their heads
Evelyn picks up her pen, and writes
'  () Dear Rafe
It's strange to be so far from you in body, and so close to you in spirit
But if our spirits really give our bodies life, then you should know this:  Every night  look at the sunset, and try to draw the last ounce of heat from its long day
She looks toward the sunset now; then she writes again
-  - Rafe brings his battered plane in for a landing
- Rafe sits on his cot, reading her letter
'  () and send it from my heart to yours
Rafe is startled as the Air Commander appears beside his bunk
Air-Sea Rescue picked up Nigel
He'll be back with us tomorrow
Rafe nods, glad to hear the news
The Commander starts to walk away, then turns back
Some of us look down on the Yanks for not yet joining this war
'd just like to say that if there are many more back home like you, God help anyone who goes to war with America
The Commander salutes, with his left hand
And Rafe salutes too -- with his left hand
-
- The White House looks somehow whiter and purer in the glow of 1941
- , , and other advisors sit around the polished table -- all males, in suits and in uniforms
The door opens, and the men all stand
appears, in a wheelchair, pushed by a huge black valet,
The President's legs are shriveled, braced with the iron supports that attach to his shoes and are apparent beneath the cloth of his pin-striped pants
From the waist up Roosevelt is heavily muscled, powerful, and handsome even in his little spectacles
The valet rolls him to the head of the table; he's speaking even before he settles in
Please be seated, gentlemen
They sit, as one
Churchill and Stalin are asking me what 'm asking you:  How long is America going to pretend the world is not at war
We've increased supply shipments to them, Mr
President, and we're losing merchant vessels every day
Shift in every destroyer and anti- aircraft weapon you can find
Sir, our Pacific Fleet is already down to almost nothing
Gentlemen, at this moment the nation of Hungry has a larger military then the United States
We have no choice but to draw from whatever we can
-  - - The Conference Room is similar to that of the White House
But this table is low and all the men sit on the floor
And there are no civilians here; Japan is now a nation ruled by its warriors
The last man to enter the room and take his place is Harvard educated, Yamamoto is an object of veneration and suspicion among the men of the war council
Yamamoto bows, sits, and looks across the table at his friend Genda, who can't hide his fear
Yamamoto glances to the far end of the table where , chief of the War Council, sits glowering
(Their discussion is in Japanese, with subtitles
) So you join us, Admiral
Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then  have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese
The time has come to strike
Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future
know what you whisper to the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans are strong
Yet look at their leader
He motions to , an intelligence analyst, who opens a file and lays out pictures of Roosevelt
Franklin Roosevelt
Born into great wealth
Fifteen years ago, he was stricken with polio
Now he cannot walk, or even stand without help
Photographers will not take pictures of him in his chair; Americans do not wish to know how weak their President is
Yamamoto makes a low grunt
You have something to say, Yamamoto
The Council knows  have opposed fighting the Americans
No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours
If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover
In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace
You see us as capable of such a blow
The Americans themselves have made it possible
We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor
The members of the war council are so pleased with Yamamoto that they bow to him
Only Genda keeps his eyes raised long enough to see the sadness in Yamamoto's face
-   -  - Danny Walker and his pilot buddies have just arrived; they enter the barracks, talking happily
If  ain't n-never on a b-boat again, it'll be too s-soon
Where are the women on this -- Danny has stopped before the others; now all of them see that the other pilots who inhabit this air base are still in their beds, sleeping off hangovers
They wear Hawaiian shirts; they haven't shaved
They're s-still asleep
Danny pauses for a moment, then shouts -- Drop your cocks and grab your socks, boys
The terror of the skies are here
The sleeping pilots groan, and cover their heads with their pillows
They're all drunk
One guy sits up in bed, his hair pointing every direction of the compass, his tongue working as if to wipe a terrible taste from his mouth
As his feet dangle over the side of the bunk and one of them touches the floor, a sensation reaches his sotted brain; he raises that foot to look at its bottom, and finds a new tattoo, on the sole of his foot; he blinks as if trying to remember how it got there
Danny moves over to him, and dubs him with a name,
Hey
You
Mr
Coma
Where's that lizard
What lizard
The one that slept in my mouth last night
What the hell happened to you guys
Coma is one of those drunks who speak as if he's always about to burp
Ever hear of mai-tai's
Comes in a big
pot
Like
like
m-missionary
No, like
Coma emits a pukey, toxic burp that has Danny and his buddies wincing back from the fumes
This is an Air Base
Where's your squad commander
The question soaks through to Coma's brain
His right hand points
and his left hand points
in different directions
His hands float around in the air until finally both of them are indicating the same direction, behind his back
In the bunk beyond Coma's is another drunk pilot in a Hawaiian shirt
and to judge by the shapely bronzed leg that protrudes from under his damp sheet, there's a woman with him too
Danny and his buddies are speechless -- except for Red Strange
th-think 'm gonna like it here
You guys are new
Yeah
Mai-tai's
got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's
Coma's head drifts forward slowly; they think for a moment he's looking for something under the bed
Then he pukes
Danny leaps back from the splatter, and marches out of the barracks; his friends follow
-  - Danny and his buddies stride up to the airfield
It's full of fighter planes -- and they're all bunched together in clusters on the field
Danny grabs a
Hey
What is this, the planes all bunched up like that
The brass is afraid of sabotage
This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service
What about easier to hit in an air raid
Who's gonna to that
Japan is four thousand miles away
So you guys just arrived, huh
Yeah
We got a saying here
-low-
The mechanic walks off
Danny and the guys are left standing on the tarmac
Well guys
reckon there's just one thing to do
- Danny and the pilots are in Hawaiian shirts, their party in full swing
bucket-sized hollowed-out volcano sits in the middle of the table, with twelve straws emerging from the crater
It's full of booze -- or was; Danny and the other guys are pulling heartily at the straws, and they gurgle as the last liquid is sucked dry
More m-mai-tai's
Coma is sitting there with them, beside Red
Absolutely right
Everybody's having a ball, the new arrivals fitting right in with the others
Danny's a bit off to himself, lost in his own thoughts
Billy and Anthony are doing the hula to the Hawaiian music playing
No, you guys aren't doing it right
It's in the hands
They talk story
Coma stands and starts demonstrating, explaining the gestures of his hula
Fish swim in ocean
Happy in the Mother Sea
Girl, beautiful girl, with big jugs, walks into water
waves lapping at her thighs
never knew those dances were so sophisticated
Fish nibble at her breasts
Coma's really into his dance, his hands over enormous imaginary breasts; but as he turns toward the windows -- more beautiful girl walks by
The guys see Evelyn passing on the other side of the street, gorgeous in the sunshine
Coma's hands start squeezing the imaginary breasts of his hula
Hey, isn't that Evelyn
Danny moves up to look
Rafe's girl, Evelyn
You guys know her
gotta have an intro
Man, 'd like to -- Danny's hand is suddenly around Coma's larynx
friend of mine's in love with her
So you don't even look -- not ever
Danny releases him and Coma staggers back to the table to nuzzle up to one of the straws of the mai-tai volcano
Danny looks out the window again and sees Evelyn's beautiful form disappear around the corner, on her way back to the base hospital
Danny moves back to the table, and as two burly Hawaiian waiters set another full loaded mai-tai volcano onto the center of the table, he picks up a glass and dips it full of the potent liquid
He shouts to the whole room -- 'm a better pilot than any son-of-a- bitch on this island
So 'm the one to say this
Here's to Rafe McCawley better pilot
and a better man
than me
The other pilots drink up -- from glasses or from straws
To Rafe
Danny drains the whole glass at one chug, and slams it down onto the table
Then he blinks, puts a hand on his stomach, and frowns
Coma recognizes the look
Uh oh
Volcanic eruption
Danny bends at the waist; his head obscured by the table
Shit, he's puking on my feet
Well, you p-puked on his feet
Yeah, but he was wearing shoes
'  -  - is Commander of the American Pacific Fleet
Two members of his staff are standing uncomfortably in front of him, having delivered a message from the Joint Chiefs of Staff
transfer twelve more destroyers to Atlantic Fleet, and all the available anti-aircraft weaponry
Washington has gone insane
Kimmel's   speaks up
We've done what you ordered, Admiral, and war gamed the likely outcome of a Japanese attack against each of our major bases in the Pacific
Wake, Guam, Midway, the Philippines
In each case, we lose
You left out Hawaii
Pearl Harbor can't be attacked effectively from the air
It's too shallow for an aerial torpedo attack
Pearl Harbor's safe
It's everywhere else that we're vulnerable
Step up surveillance of Japanese communications
They're gonna do something somewhere
can feel it
- seaplane takes tourists on an excursion above Pearl Harbor and around the island of Oahu
One Japanese tourist shoots pictures rapidly
first of the ships as seen from overhead; then he leans to the other side of the plane and shoots pictures of the airfield below them
- Another Japanese tourist hikes through the hills above Pearl Harbor
He takes an excellent camera from his picnic basket, and shoots pictures
-  , being carried down a hallway, into -- - The courier places the pictures onto the table in front of Yamamoto, Genda, and the other
Look at the ships -- all grouped
Perfect targets
And the planes
They are -- what is that American expression
Sitting geese
Sitting ducks
How can they be so foolish
They think no one would be stupid enough to attack them at Pearl Harbor
Or perhaps they think no one is capable
Look at this
He moves to a diagram displayed on the wall -- a simple display showing water depth and ship displacement
Pearl Harbor's depth of only forty feet makes them feel safe
torpedo dropped from an airplane plunges to one hundred feet before it can level off
That is a conventional torpedo
But we have been experimenting
From a stand beside his diagram he takes a set of wooden fins, attached to a circular metallic band
Wooden fins
We are testing them tomorrow
- Yamamoto and his planners have flown to a quiet Japanese island, sunlit and pleasant
They are gathered on the shore of the island's natural harbor
Wooden targets -- basically huge plank barriers -- are sunk into the water like ships at anchor
squadron of Japanese planes zooms overhead, taking up attack positions
We have chosen this place because its depth is exactly the same as Pearl Harbor's
Genda speaks into a field radio
lone plane drops out of formation and goes into a low-level approach, speeding up and dropping its torpedo
we see the torpedo as it plunges at two hundred miles an hour into the sunlit sea
With the wooden fins the torpedo makes a sharp dip and levels off above the sea floor
the planners see the path of the torpedo; it hits the wooden barrier with a satisfying
The planners are impressed -- but Yamamoto is not satisfied
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance
have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission
Yamamoto nods; Genda speaks again into his radio, and another plane swoops down and drops a torpedo
Genda holds his hands to his ears, causing the others to do the same; even though they wonder at the need
The torpedo hits the barrier, and the explosion is deafening, and of shocking force; the entire barrier is blown to toothpicks
Of course against a ship the explosion will not be dissipated, and will have more force
The planners, nearly blown off their feet, nod as if they knew that all the time
- '  - The pilots are getting slicked up
Are you sure they're here
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here
Red moves up beside him to frown at the mirror
His hair is plastered down and parted, his uniform's immaculate
Looking good, Red
Shut up
Red moves away, to polish his shoes
What is it with Red
've never seen him this way
He's been like that all day
Hey Danny, you coming
Nah, 'm gonna stay here
Read
Anthony and Billy look at each other; Danny's in his bunk, and he's not reading, just staring at the ceiling
'  -   - The nurses are primping to go out; Evelyn is in her uniform getting ready to go back to work
Now listen, it's hands off Billy mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours
He was that good
No,  was
'  -  - Creeping through the vegetation, Red leads Anthony and Billy to a spot outside the nurses' barracks; they can see the girls through the barracks window
Red, Peeping Tom stuff can get us court- marshaled
Shhh
Anthony and Billy are baffled, even more so when Red strides into the open, right outside the nurses' window
And then, Red begins to sing
(singing) Oh
Betty, Betty, Betty, you're the one for me, Betty, Betty, Betty, Betty, can't you see
Anthony and Billy look at each other, dumbfounded
The nurses move to the open windows
Red's singing is pretty good -- though not that good
But he doesn't stutter when he sings
(singing) 'll be yours for eternity, Betty, Betty, Betty, Betty, Betty
Anthony and Billy are hysterical, trying to keep their laughter hidden
But then they see the effect this is having on the women -- especially on Betty
She's smitten
Red repeats the verse, really getting into it; when he finishes, Betty runs out and hugs him, as all the nurses applaud
They move off into the darkness, arm and arm
The nurses go back to their primping
Anthony and Billy are changed men
Anthony stands up; Billy's baffled
Anthony moves out and starts singing
(singing) Oh Sandra
like you
love you
He's terrible
The nurses pelt him with hairbrushes, curlers, shoes
-  - Coming out of the blustery skies at the end of another deadly day, a squadron of Spitfires chirps in for landings
The planes are shot up and battered
Rafe is one of the pilots; the fuselage below his cockpit is marked with four swastikas, symbols of his victories
He taxis to a stop, and is met by , a Scottish mechanic, who is dismayed at the state of the plane
Leapin' Jesus
(climbing down) The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit
Well which of those three ya want fixed
All of 'em
Rafe starts away, and Ian calls to his back -- If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German
Fook ya
Learn English, then
Fook ya dooble
Rafe moves to the barracks; Ian keeps the fueling hose going, and moves to help the armorers reload the guns
- Rafe falls down onto his cot, exhausted
The other pilots do the same, everybody spent from the day's combat
Then they hear the
Rafe's out of his bunk, with the others, everybody running
Bloody Krauts
Night raid
-  - They race across the runway
Rafe reaches his Spitfire, just as Ian is removing the fueling hose
have'na been able ta -- Crank her
Ian gives the prop a spin, and the engine roars to life
God speed ya, laddie
- It's dark, but there are breaks in the clouds, giving way to patches of light from a full moon
The squadron of Spitfires tightens up for battle
Rafe is positioned just right of the squad leader; he sees planes breaking out of the dark clouds ahead
Here they come
The clouds break, revealing a huge attack formation
Alpha group, on the bombers
Beta group, take the fighters
They peel off, into action
- We stay with Rafe as he and the Squad Leader rush side by side at the lead bomber, blasting away with their guns
-    - The Spitfires' bullets rip into the pilot and also kill the nose gunner; the bomber dips as the copilot struggles to take control
,    - As he streaks past, Rafe sees the bomber wobble in the air
We've got him hurt, stay on him
Rafe throws his plane into an ultra-tight, high speed turn, right between the tails of the leader German group and the noses of the second
His turn is so tight that the plane flexes with the g-force
Rafe comes out of his turn ahead of the Squad Leader, and races back up through the formation of German bombers, moving above them where their weapons and armaments are the weakest
He stitches a trail of bullets from tail to nose of the wounded lead bomber; it begins to smoke
The second Spitfire, the Squad Leader's, takes fire from the other German bombers, and shears off, heading through the smoke of the plane Rafe has on the ropes
We've got him going
Rafe does a half-loop and half-spin, to bring him around to face the bombers again
This time the g-force of the turn pops an oil line inside Rafe's cockpit; hot, pressurized oil begins to spray everywhere -- all over Rafe, his controls, and worst of all, over the inside of his cockpit glass
He wipes at the oil with his hands and that just smears it and makes it worse
His wingman sees him veering away from the bombers
and sees the German fighters moving up to meet him
McCawley
Get to the clouds
Get into the clouds
,   , is flying blind
can't see the clouds
His problems are just beginning; the fluid is dripping down onto his cockpit's corroded electrical wiring; the fluid causes an arc
a spark
and suddenly a fire is spreading through Rafe's plane
He grabs his fire extinguisher and triggers a cloud that snuffs the fire but fills the entire cockpit with choking smoke; between that and the smeared fluid on his glass, he can't see a thing
And the Messerschmidts are swarming over him
Rafe's wingman dives in, raking the German planes as he passes
Rafe tries to open his cockpit cover to clear the smoke, but it's jammed; he pulls out his
45 pistol and
He blows out the glass; the smoke clears enough for him to take a breath and try to see
He fights the stick, but the plane won't respond
The Messerschmidts rake him again, bullets riddling his engine
Get out of there, McCawley
Get out of there
Rafe's plane descends, ever faster, passing through clouds, then clear air again
The Squad Leader tries to chase and cover him, but Rafe's dropping fast, and still isn't out of the plane as the Germans dive on him again, firing
Rafe's Spitfire hits the broken fog over the water -- the Squad Leader loses sight of it for a moment -- and then the plane hits, splashing and exploding all at once
The Squad Leader winces, and ducks into the clouds as he reports on his radio
McCawley down
No 'chute
-   - The sailors have assembled on deck for the ship's heavyweight championship fight, a contest made more interesting to the sailors because one of the combatants is white and the other is black
The battle is more toughness than technique
The guys throwing haymakers and shoving each other around the roped area, as their shipmates cheer and make wild bets
The white guy digs a punch deep into the black guy's ribs, and the black guy slams a double left hook into the white guy's belly, making him back up and say -- You hit hard -- for a cook
The black guy rushes the white guy, only to catch a right cross that wobbles his knees and makes him stagger, with a fresh cut over his right eye
The white guy now rushes in, and the black guy (his name is  ) throws an upper cut that drops his opponent like a sack of rocks
The sailors cheer wildly
Dorie steps back, and rubs his glove across his brow
It's really bleeding now
- Evelyn is returning from church with six of her nurse friends
It's very quiet on a Sunday morning, almost nobody at the base; they walk along the path
Let's get into civvies and find a bar
Right after church
You've gotta sin some, to get forgiveness
Come with us, Evelyn
You need some sin
've got to write some requisitions
We're undersupplied with morphine
Morphine
We've been here a month and nobody's had worse than a sunburn
Evelyn smiles softly and walks toward the base hospital
wish she could forget him
You don't forget love, Honey
Not ever
-   - Evelyn approaches the hospital and finds the black boxer peering in the window
He's in a -shirt and navy pants
Can  help you, sailor
As Dorie turns, she sees the cut on his head, closed only with a band-aid; it's dripping blood down his -shirt
'Scuse me, 'Mam
All the ship's doctors is golfing, and  couldn't find nobody to look at this
Our doctor's gone too
Sorry to trouble you
Wait, let me look at that
You better come in here
- Miller is sitting on a stool; Evelyn bathes the wound
How'd you get this
Boxin'
Win
Yes'm
He says it without pride
She puts down the basin
What's your name
Dorie Miller, 'Mam
'm Evelyn
And 'm just a nurse
But 'm not playing golf, and that cut needs sewing, or else it's gonna make a big lumpy scar
Whatta ya say
-   - Evelyn clips the ends of her carefully applied stitches; Dorie's eyes are rolled up as if he could watch from inside his skull
How often you fight like this
Every other Sunday
'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia
What do you get for winning
Respect
She hands him a mirror
He studies her work
No doctor would'a give me that good
She walks him to the door
Thank you, 'Mam
Tell me something, Dorie
man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect
left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man
They made me a cook -- and not even that, really --  clean up after the other sailors eat
shine the officer's shoes
In two years, they've never even let me fire a gun
Now Evelyn understands
You take care, Dorie
You too, 'Mam
- Dorie walks away, down the path between the palm trees
She watches him go, and then is transfixed by someone else coming, silhouetted by the light of the setting sun
She can't make out his face, but he's wearing a pilot's dress uniform, and coming to her right out of the warm orange sunset that she has stared at so many times
Her heart slams against her ribs; she takes a few steps forward
Rafe
She moves toward him, and he draws near her, walking slowly
And then she sees his face
It's Danny
His face as sad as death itself
And even before he tells her, she knows
Lieutenant
'm Danny Walker
'm Rafe McCawley's best friend
Were
Isn't that what you mean
Were
Because he's dead, isn't he
And that's why you've come
-    - Evelyn and Danny sit on the bench, with a sweeping view of the harbor and the lights winking on all around it as the sun settles beyond the horizon
Evelyn is stoic, numb; Danny is the one who is struggling
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened
He told me about you
That he had no other friend like you
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes
Real straight, frugal
My father was the town drunk
Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along
Rafe and  were the only ones at the funeral
He took me back to his house, and  never left
You were more like brothers
taught him to drink beer
He taught me how to fly
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him
He said that
Evelyn nods, still staring away from Danny
This pierces Danny; he looks away, struggling not to let the emotions pull him completely under
Look, uh
Rafe's dad
he wrote me with the news, and it took me a couple of days to work up the guts to come here and tell you
'm not as brave as Rafe, or as noble
But if there's anything  can ever do to help -- you let me know, okay
She stares into the distance
He stands and puts his hand on top of hers, as much for his comfort as for hers
understand why Rafe loved you
You're as strong as he was
Since she's still not looking at him, he starts to move away
When he reaches the turn in the path, he looks back, and sees her figure in the gathering darkness
She's begun to break down; and as he watches, her whole body starts convulsing, and she doubles up in shattering grief
Danny can't just stand there; he moves back to her, and puts a hand on her shoulder
He sits beside her again, and suddenly she turns to him and sobs upon him
Danny wraps her gently in his arms, and then he breaks down, having found the first place he can truly grieve
-   - The Japanese have constructed a replica of Pearl Harbor on their practice island; erecting new target barriers and silhouettes of the various ships anchored at Pearl
Streams of Japanese planes skim overhead in practice bombing runs, dropping dummy torpedoes and bombs
From a control platform erected on the beach, Yamamoto and Genda oversee it all
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific
Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way
Brilliant, Admiral
brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war
He looks out at the planes roaring into his practice harbor at top speed
- Roosevelt's valet leans over him
Roosevelt wakes; beside the valet is a Presidential
Mr
President, we've received a message from the Argentinian ambassador to Japan
His sources tell him the Japanese are assembling their fleet to attack us
We're picking up warnings for every American base in the Pacific
Does this ambassador know the target
Not for sure
But he thinks it's Pearl Harbor
Tell the Pentagon
The Aide leaves quickly and Roosevelt starts to get out of bed; his valet comes to help him
No, George,  need the practice, in case there's a fire
Roosevelt drags himself out of bed, crawling toward the bathroom, his powerful arms dragging his lifeless legs
- and other  are gathered around a giant map of the Pacific
The attack seems inevitable
The question is where
The way to answer that question is to ask:  if we were the Japanese, how would we do it
He nods to a  , who stands over the map
Between America and the Far East are the sea lanes where the winds and the currents make the best route for shipping
Far above is the northern route, between Canada and Russia
Between these two is something they call the Vacant Sea
If  were the Japs, 'd send a task force there
You could hide the entire land mass of Asia in the Vacant Sea, and nobody would know
So they pop out and attack where
That's the problem, Admiral
They could hit anywhere they want
Nobody has any solution
- huge Japanese fleet steams toward Hawaii
It is an awesome sight
Carriers, battleships, destroyers, and entire battle group, traveling under complete radio silence, their hulls power through the waves
On the lower decks of the carriers are hundreds of planes -- fighters and bombers
- The American ships are lined up at anchor, calm, placid
- The sailors and soldiers bask in the sun, play volleyball
The aircraft carrier Lexington steams past toward the harbor entrance
1 Where's the Lexington going
2 Out on maneuvers, like the Enterprise
-  - Men in military haircuts -- officers -- stroll the golf courses, enjoying themselves
'  - The , an ethnic Japanese, is working on a patient with his mouth agape
The   intrudes
Dr
Takanawa, you have a call from Tokyo
Please excuse me
Just relax
Leaving his patient with a mouth full of instruments, the Dentist moves to his outer office, which looks directly out over Pearl Harbor
He speaks in Japanese
Takanawa
Yes
He seems confused by the call, but he responds by looking out over the harbor, then saying into the receiver -- Yes, they are all
no wait,  see the big one moving
The one that's flat on top, what do they call it
- Some tired Army Intelligence types --  , a , and an  , are sitting at a bank of phones
The  is a Japanese-American
Here's something, over the line from Tokyo
He switches on the recording equipment and looks to the , sitting at a battery of equipment
It's connected to a local dentist
His office is beside Pearl Harbor
This dentist, is he a spy
Sounds too innocent
His accent is from the old country
Somebody official- sounding calls, he thinks it's discourteous not to respond
- Admiral Kimmel is settling into the barber chair when his enters and nods for the barber to move a few paces away, so that he can speak privately
Sir, we just had an intelligence intercept
Someone from Tokyo called a local dentist whose office looks over Pearl
They wanted to know the exact location of the ships
Someone from Tokyo asks a dentist how the ships are sitting
What are we supposed to do about that
don't know, Sir
But it just seemed significant
Have intelligence keep monitoring him
The Admiral sinks back into the chair
- young amateur , about 16, wearing a hat with "  " printed on it's crown is ready to snap a shot of Evelyn and her nurse friends having a picnic lunch on the lawn outside the hospital
Closer, ladies
Closer
Now smile
Great
Next week 'll show you a print and you can order your Pictures of Paradise
He hustles off
Betty hands out picnic baskets
Barbara, here's yours
and Evelyn, here you are
Evelyn opens her basket, and finds a lei of Hawaiian flowers stuffed in the top
Betty scoots over and puts the flowers around Evelyn's neck
It's been a month and you haven't smiled
We just want you to know we love you
Evelyn's touched -- but before she can react two -40's zoom out of the skies, wings clipping the tops of the palm trees as they blast over head
'   -40' - Danny and Anthony are the pilots; as they pull up and away, they pass over some officers on the golf course, scaring the shit out of them as they putt
- The nurses have sprawled to the ground; now even Evelyn is smiling
What is it with nurses and pilots
-   - Evelyn walks out of the hospital
She's still wearing her lei
The sun is going down in a spectacular sunset
She stares at the orange glow at the edge of the world
She breathes in the sea air, and tries to breathe out the sadness
The water of the harbor laps close to where she stands, the sunset polishing its surface
She takes the lei from her neck, plucks a single flower, and holds it like the rose Rafe once gave her
Then she tosses the rest of the lei into the ocean and watches it float away, as the sun sinks behind the horizon
- Evelyn finds her purse, and tucks the flower into it
She's alone in the hospital, everyone else has gone; she turns her mind toward work, something to lose herself in
-   '  - Danny is walking toward the barracks when a  hopping mad, confronts him
You're Walker, right
Yes Sir
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base
You liked that
Oh yeah
liked it so much 'm cutting you out of the squadron
Sir
don't buy that hot dog shit
So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa
Hale-what
You'll love it
No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance
Sir,  -- Too late for apologies, Walker
wasn't gonna apologize, Sir
was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds
The Colonel glares at him and stalks away
- Danny and Evelyn are having coffee at the base canteen
How's everything
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet
Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us
That might not have been such a good idea
They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield
The real punishment is that  won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee
So  guess it's goodbye for awhile
was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes
Do you think that's why we're meeting
To help us say goodbye to Rafe
swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff  think ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to
Rafe was
he was lonely
He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty
The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring
He's been lost in his own thoughts of Rafe; now he notices the tears welling up in her eyes
Sorry
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret
Now that's all  have
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night
Well
sure
From the air
- -40 takes off from the remote airfield, lit only by the full moon
-40 - Evelyn sits on Danny's lap, like Rafe sat in his Daddy's lap years before
Danny flies easily, the cockpit open, his arms slipped under hers
The sky above them is startlingly clear; a billion stars dancing around a full moon
So beautiful
Hang on
He spins the plane in an easy half turn, inverting their heads above Pearl Harbor, gorgeous in the moonlight, the battleships aglow, the moon reflected in the peaceful water, embraced by the island of Oahu
- The -40 soars easily in and settles to earth
Danny shuts down the engine
Danny carefully removes the harness around her
She looks overhead
The stars are still bright above them
didn't realize until tonight that 've stopped wanting to live
She turns in his lap, and looks at him
Their eyes connect
Tentatively, almost reluctantly, they kiss
- The  of someone moving through the gathering darkness approaches the hospital
The lights from within the hospital, and the pristine white beds beneath those lights, give the place a kind of glow, where Evelyn moves alone and beautiful, like a ballerina in a giant's jewel box
Now we see the shoulders of the figure, from behind, and can tell that it is a man in uniform, but at first we can't tell who
He's standing dead still, transfixed in watching Evelyn through the windows
- Evelyn moves to her desk, and sits down
She looks at the calender turning back to October, where she wrote on the square of October 22, "Order supplies" -- she counts the weeks from then to today, December 6
- We see the full figure of the man watching her
And now we see his face
It is Rafe
His left hand is bandaged, but he is very much alive -- though seeing Evelyn has taken his breath, and even seems to have robbed him of the power to move
His eyes pick up every detail of her -- her face
her hands
And as Rafe watches Evelyn, he has the punctuated by fragments of the letter she wrote to him, and  with Rafe in the present, watching Evelyn
' Dearest Rafe -- , ' , crippled and trailing smoke, passing through a patch of cloud as Rafe hurls himself from the cockpit and jerks the ripcord of his chute
Rafe's face winces with the memory, and he rivets his eyes on Evelyn, as if to force himself to know that this moment is real
, and the shock of its coldness travels up his body faster than his body sinks into the water
He's cloaked in the fog; his parachute, pushed by the wind, is pulling him along face down
He fights with the straps, flips himself over, and pulls the release
But he's still in desperate trouble; in his flying clothes, his heavy leather jacket soaking with sea-water, he's going down; his body sinks beneath the surface
' Every sunset
, Rafe's chest trembles
Is it from the memory of the frozen water, from the emotion of seeing Evelyn again -- or both
-- Below the surface of the North Sea, Rafe's body drifts, but he fights his way back up
he kicks off his shoes, sheds the jacket, strips off his pants and starts tying the cuffs into knots
Then, in a , he is floating in the water, his pants turned into a makeshift life preserver, his body shaking convulsively from the cold
Then in another  we see him after he's been in the water for so long that his body no longer trembles; he's lost consciousness
He has no strength, no will to live
His face settles into the water
his body slips from his preserver, and drifts beneath the surface
' gather it's heat into my heart, and send it to you
, Rafe beneath the surface
His eyes come open
From his  beneath the water, he sees something above the surface
It's only in his mind, but that makes it no less real
an orange glow, the warmth of the sunset, and her face above the surface
His limbs come to life, and he fights his way up, breaking the surface
The whole sea around him is dark and empty, but he grabs his makeshift preserver and holds on for dear life
and for Evelyn
Rafe stares through the window, at Evelyn, but he can't go in
He backs away from the window
'  - Japanese-American   parks his motorbike outside and enters the barracks
Daniel Walker
Danny rises from his bunk and accepts the telegram
As the message boy leaves, Danny reads
The news he learns stuns him
-    - Rafe is still lost in thought
He hears steps running up -- and sees Danny -- who spots him at the same moment
Rafe
- Evelyn puts away the calender
- Rafe is sitting at the bench, his head down
- Evelyn on the path; she sees someone on the bench, his form hauntingly familiar
He hears her, and looks up
It's Rafe
From Evelyn's , the whole world spins
She faints
Rafe jumps to catch her before she slams to the ground
He gathers her into his arms, and she looks up into his face
He's real, very real
Evelyn
She's trembling, shaking
He lifts her to her feet, and moves her to the bench
sent telegrams,  guess the military traffic held them up
Why were you sitting here, instead of
saw you,  couldn't go in,
just stood there wondering if you knew
You looked
sad, and  had to sit down a minute
How did you
Survive
jumped in a patch of fog, and nobody could see me
hit the water hard
And it was so
cold
He looks toward the horizon, when the last light of day fades to black
There's something he thinks about saying, and doesn't
Then
don't know how long  was in the water
Norwegian freighter picked me up
They were headed to Spain
They docked in La Rota, right beside a German ship, and told me to stay hidden below
was afraid they'd turn me in, so  stole some clothes, jumped ship, and found a church, where the priest contacted the resistance, and got me on a freighter to New York
He looks at her, then looks down again
called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle
The Colonel sent a man to pick me up
They wanted to debrief me
told the Colonel  needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour
(beat) 've done a lot of talking
You haven't said anything
'm just
so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay
You are okay, aren't you
Nothing that won't heal
guess
At these words, she looks at him for a long, long moment
It's been
so different, being so sure you were dead
'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but 'm back
He sees the troubled look on her face
Maybe 've assumed too much
Has something changed
(beat) 'm afraid to ask what
And 'm afraid not to
(beat) Have you fallen in love
She nods; she can't even say it
Rafe's dying inside
It's all right
Danny always said  see things with my emotions instead of my eyes
It's not your fault, Rafe
The letter wrote you, they -- Don't worry about that
Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up
It's not that  didn't mean everything wrote
It's just that --  thought you were dead
And now -- Danny runs up, through the darkness
You're alive
Rafe and Danny stare at each other; Danny hesitates, looking from Rafe to Evelyn, wondering what they've said
Then Rafe looks at Evelyn, and picks up the look on her face
In that moment he puts it all together
Aw, God
Oh my God
Danny's speechless, and for a moment Evelyn is too
Rafe -- He puts up a hand, to silence her, and walks away suddenly
Evelyn and Danny are left frozen
- Rafe stares out at the harbor, seeing nothing
As he stands there alone and shattered, he has one more Rafe is in the water of the North Sea; he seems dead, but his makeshift preserver is keeping his face above the surface
Something slides through the water and stops beside him; it's a dinghy, and behind it is a trawler
Hands grab Rafe and drag him onto the dinghy
In a  , Rafe's body is laid out on the deck of the trawler
The crewmen think he's dead
His body is stiff, his lips white; and they say so, in Norwegian
But one of the other crewmen notices a quiver in his eyelid, then quickly covers Rafe with his on wool peacoat and presses back an eyelid to see his pupils
Rafe's white lips move
The crewmen realize he's trying to say something
And Rafe does utter something, barely audible; something the Norwegian crewmen don't understand
Evelyn
Rafe struggles to bury that memory so far that he'll never feel it again
'  - Danny escorts Evelyn back to her quarters
Don't worry
'll find him
He hugs her; their embrace earnest yet tingled with guilt, and Danny leave quickly
Betty steps out of the nurses' quarters and hands Evelyn a telegram
This came while you were gone
Evelyn knows it's the telegram from Rafe, to tell her he's alive
Without opening it, she begins to cry, and hurries away from the barracks so the other nurses won't see
- Danny crosses the tarmac toward the clustered -40's
He spots what he's looking for
Sitting in the cockpit of one of the -40's is Rafe
Rafe won't look at him
Danny climbs up on the wing, and sits down there
You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset
Upset
Why should  be upset
Let's go get a drink
Unless you're scared to talk about it
-  Mai-Tai volcano clunks onto a table
- Drink up
Then we'll talk
Rafe takes the challenge, and takes a long pull on one of the straws
Red, Anthony, Billy, and several others enter the bar
Rafe
They rush the table
- They're all drinking, and the whole bar is rocking
Rafe uses glasses to show his buddies tactics
They'll go under you because their planes are faster, then they run so you can't catch 'em
But then they'll come around and take you from behind -- like some Americans will
The last words bring the group to silence
The other guys drift away, to give them room
Sorry
Why be sorry
That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it
didn't mean it
Sure you did
So come on
Say what you think
Waitress
Four beers
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai
If you can't keep up, don't drink yours
The waitress delivers four bottles to the table
Rafe takes a slow sip, then stares at Danny
We gotta face some facts here
What facts are those
understand how it could happen
know why any guy would love her
And  can't blame you that it happened
You thought was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her
was grieving too
Yeah, right
Anyway, you didn't know
So what are you saying
'm saying now you do know
So it's time for you to fuck off
You left her
How's that for a fact
How's this for a fact
loved her first
Danny takes a long pull of beer, and Rafe does the same
You know, you're a lousy drinker
Drinking's supposed to make men feel bigger
It only makes you stupid
And weak
Rafe nods thoughtfully, and sets down his beer
How's this
He knocks Danny out of the chair, flat on his ass
Danny backhands the blood from the corner of his mouth
You want it, you got it
He kicks Rafe in the back of the knee, then mule kicks him in the chest as he goes down, and the fight is on
The bar's bouncer, a big Samoan, moves over to break them up -- but Anthony steps in his way
Let 'em fight, they need it
The bouncer tosses Anthony aside, but before he can move in to interrupt the fight, Red breaks a lava volcano of Mai-Tai over the bouncer's skull
The bartender picks up the phone to call the
's
Rafe and Danny are exchanging punches in the middle of the room
Sailors sitting at the bar have swung around on their stools to watch the action
The other pilots are wincing with the punches their friends exchange, and bobbing and weaving as if in the fight themselves
tapes Billy
Is this a private fight or can anybody jump in
Billy hits him
The whole bar erupts
Rafe and Danny are really having at it, fueled by so much emotion that nothing hurts
They're on the floor now, trying to rip each other apart
They struggle to their feet and Rafe manages to knee Danny in the balls
Danny doubles over in pain
That hurt
didn't think you had any balls
Without looking up, Danny lunges at Rafe, tackling him around the waist, driving him at the wall
But they don't hit the wall; they tumble through the back window of the bar -- not covered in glass, but fronds and wood -- and out into the back alley
They're lying there in the debris when they see the
jeeps coming
They drag each other to their feet, and run away
- The Japanese task force rumbles through the night, the bows of the great ships blasting through the crashing waves
- Yamamoto's flagship
The clock reaches midnight, and a sailor tears off it's calender
It's December 7, 1941
The submarines will be reaching the harbor soon
hope they don't set off the alarm too soon
-    - An American destroyer, the , leads a squadron of destroyers on patrol, near the entrance of Pearl Harbor
on the bridge think they spot something
-   - The   listens to a report on his headset and turns to the
Captain, lookouts report a sighting, two points off the starboard beam
The sonar operator looks up and nods
How big
've lost it
Probably a blackfish
've seen them look like subs
-    - Another destroyer, the  , cruises behind the Selfridge
On it's bridge, the   speaks to the Sir, Selfridge reports a contact, then lost it
Now our sonar reports the contact
The Captain looks toward the Selfridge, then trains his binoculars on the water were the Duty Officer points
He sees something dark and black slipping along beneath the surface
He gets onto his intercom
Radio room
Raise the Selfridge
Tell the Squadron Commander we have spotted a sub and request permission to depth charge
He looks again at the black shape, passing a few hundred yards from them
We're five miles from Pearl Harbor and it's moving in from the open sea
Prepare to move to attack speed
The  comes alive
Sir, the Squadron Commander on Selfridge denies permission
What
Denies, Sir
He says it's a blackfish
The Captain chokes back his frustration and shuts down the intercom -- but then he says to the Duty Officer, as they watch the shape disappear toward Pearl Harbor
If it's a blackfish, it has a motorboat up it's ass
-  - Danny has pulled his Buick convertible off the road; Rafe is bent over, his head out of frame; he's throwing up
Danny's banged up from the fight and still drunk himself; he waits beside Rafe, who chokes out between heaves -- How come you're not pukin'
guess 'm used to it
've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back
Rafe straightens up, but the waves of sickness come back over him and he bends over again
Danny looks at his friend, and the pain is written on Danny's face
Don't blame her, Rafe
It's not like you're thinking
(between heaves) Fuck you
She loves you
know that
And part of what she loves in me is how much of you she sees in me
Rafe doesn't seem to be listening; but Danny knows he is
We were both torn up
started dropping by to see her, because we understood what each other felt
We'd have coffee and try not to talk about you, but we always would
Rafe stands to face Danny; this is hard for Danny to say
She said  was so much like you
said, No, 'm not
'm like  am because of you, but 'm not you, not as good as you
Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder
But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me
You made me who  am
How sweet
Is that when you put the move on her
Danny slams his fist into Rafe's sick gut
Rafe doubles over again, coughing, nothing left in his belly to come up
Rafe stand slowly, nodding as if he knows the punch was what he deserved
Danny's about to apologize when once more Rafe knees him in the balls
Danny folds up, drops to his knees, and starts to retch
That's better
Rafe crawls into the back seat of the car and passes out, Danny still collapsed at the side of the road
- The Japanese task force storms on
- , the planes are being armed with bombs and torpedoes
' , the pilots individually sit before personal shrines, saying private prayers, writing letters
-   - The planes are brought up on the elevators; deck crewmen start rolling them into position
- Japanese submarine with a midget sub attached to its hull runs silently toward Pearl Harbor
- The periscope of the submarine breaks the surface
- The sub commander looks through the periscope and sees the lights of Oahu far in the distance
Prepare to launch midget sub
,   - The sailor who will drive the midget sub completes his ceremonial sponge bath, and places a handwritten letter on his personal shrine
'  () My revered father,  go now to fulfill my mission and my destiny
- We see the sub surface, and the sailor exit the main hatch of the big sub, then force himself through the tiny hatch of the midget sub
'  () hope it is a destiny that will bring honor to our family, and if it requires my life  will sacrifice it gladly, if you can think of me and my hope to be a good servant of our nation, and a worthy son
With love and devotion, Kazuyoshi
,   - single scout plane launches into the air
- The plane climbs to a high altitude, toward the dawn and Pearl Harbor
- The Japanese carriers turn into the wind and raise combat pennants
color guard raises the Japanese flag as the deck crew stand at attention, seeing the rising-sun flag snap potently in the wind
- The first wave of Japanese planes begins to launch
It is a stirring sight for the Japanese; the pilots waiting in their cockpits, the officers watching from the bridge, the seamen on the flight deck
The first plane taxis along the flight deck and lifts into the sky
The seamen cheer and wave their caps
-    - The American destroyer  cuts through the water, moving back into port after a night patrol
It's  is on the bridge, and its lookouts are still scanning the waters
Captain, do you see that, in our wake
The Captain raises his binoculars and looks out behind the ship
He sees something small and black there
That's a conning tower
Could it be one of ours
He's trying to follow us through the sub nets, into the harbor
Sink the son of a bitch
- The deck gun barks, aimed toward the conning tower of the Japanese sub in the distance
The first shot sails directly over the tower, missing
'   - The Japanese sub commander sees, through his periscope, the flame erupt on the Ward's deck; he's being fired upon
He snaps orders -- Dive
Dive
- The gunners snap in another shell and fire again
It's a direct hit, the sub is ripped apart, it rolls over
'  - The Captain watches the sub sinking and snaps an order
Fleet command, from destroyer Ward
Have fired upon and sunk enemy submarine seeking to enter Pearl Harbor
-   -   - -   - There are two guys left in the room, yawning over their new radar equipment
The Officer, , checks his watch; it's a few minutes after seven a
m
Time to shut her down
That was a good first session
You'll get the hang of this new radar soon
Thank you, Sir
Hey
what's this
His screen shows a huge cloud of blips, heading toward them
've never seen anything like that before
He gets on the telephone
- The phone rings and an officer answers
Watch command
Coming from which direction
Hold on
He covers the phone and tells his commander -- Radar station has picked up a cloud of blips, coming in from the northeast
He switches on the radio, and tunes it to ; hearing the Hawaiian music reassures him something
is on early
That means we've got a flight of -17's coming in from the mainland, they use the radio music for a homing beacon
-   - Dismayed, Ellis listens to the response from the headquarters
All right, Sir
(he hangs up) They say don't worry about it
He and the private look again at the cloud of blips -- growing ever larger, and moving in fast
- The Japanese formations are streaking through the sky
- The Japanese bombers, with three-man crews, are listening to the Hawaiian music of the radio station, using it for their homing beacon
They look out and see the sunrise -- it's beautiful, and resembles the Japanese flag
- The Japanese scout plane is high in the air
It radios -- Harbor quiet
Ships in place
Carriers gone
'  - Yamamoto is handed this message
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port
don't like this
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral
We must go ahead
This is our moment
'  - The Admiral, dressed in his golf clothes, is leaving his home when a naval  appears at his door
Admiral, one of our destroyers reports sinking a sub on its way into Pearl
Relay that to Washington
and cancel my golf game
'  -  - Kimmel enters his office, and is handed the latest dispatches
Any response from Washington
' Nothing, Sir
-   - telegram, addressed to Admiral Kimmel, lands in the regular, not urgent, dispatch box
The messenger handles it promptly, hopping on his motorbike to deliver it
- The Japanese planes increase throttle and nose down, diving toward the surface, hurtling into attack mode
- The harbor lies quiet
It's a sleepy Sunday morning
Children are playing, officers are stepping from their houses in their shorts to get the morning paper
-  - Hawaiian Boy Scouts are hiking on a side of one of the mountains overlooking Pearl
Suddenly booming over the mountain, barely ten feet above the summit, comes a stream of planes
The boys are awed
What is this
- - Between the approach of the Japanese planes, and sleepy Pearl Harbor
-- The planes, in formation, their propellers spinning, their engines throbbing
-- Pearl Harbor, with the ships silent, their engines cold, their anchors steady on the harbor bottom
-- The Japanese submarines heading in
-- The American destroyers docking, instead of going out to search for them
-- Another formation of Japanese bombers climbing high, into attack position
-- The Japanese torpedo planes dropping down to the level of the ocean, their engines beginning to scream
-- The American planes bunched on the airfields
--    , Yamamoto and his staff huddle tensely, over their battle maps
, the second wave of planes is being brought up and loaded with munitions
the Japanese flag snaps tautly in the wind
, American officers are laughing on the putting green near the club house, where the American flag droops from the flag pole, limply at peace
-- The Japanese planes roaring down just over the wave tops of Pearl Harbor itself
-- Children playing in the early morning sun, looking up as they see the planes flash by
The children look -- they've never seen this many, flying this low
but they are not alarmed, only curious
The images come faster and faster, the collision of Japan's determination and American's innocence
- Two sailors are standing on the deck, sharing a smoke, looking out over the quiet harbor
One of them sees the first few planes streaking in
1 Look at that
2 It's the Army again, practicing on us
Something drops from the lead plane and splashes easily into the water; the plane banks away
2 Practice torpedoes
white streak runs through the water at them
2 Now listen, you'll hear a little thud when it hits the side of the ship
They watch it rush at them
then, a
It throws up a fifty foot wall of water, hurling the sailors and everything else on the deck into the sea
- -- The first wave of planes drop more torpedoes; they plunge , their wooden fins working perfectly, the torpedoes speeding to their targets
We see their   against the anchored ships as the torpedoes hit home
-- The Japanese    come in; some drop their bombs directly into the ships; some skip their bombs across the water, the bombs glancing off the surface and then slamming the sides of battleships with tremendous explosions
--   , sleeping sailors are thrown from their bunks; those already awakened run for their battle stations, and try to make it up to the deck; but there's no escape there, as
-- Zero fighter planes strafe the ships, raking the decks and killing sailors with
- Fire and smoke are turning everything into chaos
some sailors rush to man the guns, they find the ammo boxes locked
Under the bombing and strafing, they find a wrench and start pounding on the lock, trying to break open the ammo box
Then they break open the lock -- and find the ammo box empty
Shit
'll get some ammo
He runs for the ladders, and is shot down before he gets there
- The dive bombers scream in
- Bombs are hitting the deck
Sailors are blown into the air and out into the oily water
Nearby ships are catching fire; the flames spread out onto the oily water itself
- Dorie Miller, the boxing champion/kitchen helper, is working picking up the breakfast trays when he feels the ship shudder
The intercom comes alive -- Battle stations
Battle stations
This is not a drill
Men run to the ladders, and the shaking of the ship from a bomb blast tosses them off; Dorie's at the foot of the ladder when men fall back on top of him
- The Captain of the ship has reached the command bridge, where most of his staff is lying wounded from a bomb blast
Stay calm
Find your positions
Medics, get the wounded to sick bay
Load and -- and  blast into the ship
big chunk of shrapnel tears into the Captain and rips his stomach open
The medics he was just directing to other men now run to him, as the men they were going to help have been blown apart
- Sailors run up from below and are gunned down and blasted down before they can reach their weapons
Dorie Miller emerges from below decks and sees the carnage, the confusion
bloody  grabs him
Boy
We need stretcher bearers on the bridge
Dorie runs into the fire and smoke, toward the bridge
- Dorie arrives to see the medics crouched over the disemboweled Captain, who is still giving orders
Radio for air cover
Organize the other medics
Initiate fire control
Dorie helps the medic lift the Captain to take him below
- Dorie carries the Captain down the ladder by himself, using one arm to climb and one to hold the Captain like a child's teddy bear
When they reach the bottom the pain has grown too much for the Captain; he know's he's dying
Put me down here
Dorie puts him down; the medic jumps down the ladder and reaches the Captain, who tells him -- Find my executive officer and tell him he's in command
Tell him to fire the boilers and
He trembles in death throes
Make sure the gunners have enough ammuni -- He's dead
The Medic runs toward the ladder, reaches the hatch, and is blasted back to the bottom by an explosion overhead
Dorie runs for the ladder, and climbs out into hell
- Dorie emerges into even greater carnage and confusion sailor, his body on fire, runs past and leaps into the oily water -- but it is in flames too
Then Dorie sees it:  an unmanned anti-aircraft gun
He runs to it, through the strafing
The gun already has a belt of ammo in it -- apparently loaded by the gunner who lies beside it with his chest shot open
Dorie swings the business end of the gun toward the Zeros coming in out of the smoke, and he begins to fire
The Zeros keep coming and he keeps firing; nothing on earth will knock him from that gun
'  - Evelyn is up, dressed; her roommates are just stirring
'  -  - Evelyn has stepped to the door when she hears a distant rumble and looks across the harbor to see smoke rising, ships taking hits
Oh my God
As she runs, Japanese planes are coming toward the base
- The men were sitting down to breakfast, but the machine gun bullets tearing up the outer walls have them clogging the doors, and it's so clogged they can't all get out
steel bomb crashes through the roof and slams through the room, taking out tables and chairs before bouncing off the wall and coming to a stop
, trapped within the mess hall, see it stop without detonating
They are bug-eyed, hearts stopped
Dud
The bomb detonated, blowing everything to bloody dust
- Evelyn reaches the hospital first and runs to the cabinet, withdrawing supplies
Barbara and Sandra appear at the far door, both terrified
Get everything out
Bandages, sutures -- oh God, the men in traction
Come with me
She races into the hallway, the other two following
-   - Four men from a jeep accident are lying in traction, their casted limbs roped in the air
Evelyn runs in, grabbing a razor blade from the medical cabinet -- and telling Barbara and Sandra
Cut them down, and take cover
Hurry
Bombs are falling outside, on the airfield this wing of the hospital faces
Evelyn slices the traction ropes of a man with both legs broken; ignoring his groans, she rolls him out of the bed and covers him with the mattress
The other nurses follow her lead
The bombs are coming toward the hospital ward; Evelyn finishes with the fourth man and covers him and herself with the mattress, just as a bomb craters outside the window
The nurses and patients look up after the explosions have passed; there's a chunk of smoking shrapnel lying on the springs of the bunk where the last man had been lying
- The Japanese low-altitude bombers, with Zero escorts, zoom in over the field, blasting the clusters of American warplanes, whole squadrons taken out with one bomb
The mechanics and pilots, caught in the open, run from the strafing
The Zeros rake them down with machine gun fire
It's carnage
'  - Sammy, the amateur photographer, is leaving his house for a morning of working his "Pictures of Paradise" business, when he sees the Japanese formations rumbling toward Pearl
He races back inside
'  - He fishes into his drawer for a film camera, and digs out cans of film, struggling to load it as he runs back out
-  - The pilots of Danny's squadron have returned from their night of drinking and brawling and are crashed on their bunks
Red stirs and staggers toward the head; he bumps into the wall, backs up like a wind-up toy and lurches blindly forward again, into -- -   - Red sleepwalks to the urinals and unleashes a marathon piss stream, still in his sleep
rumble penetrates his brain, and his eyes come open a fraction
Through the window slits above the urinals, he can see a cloud of Japanese planes rushing past
He squeezes his eyes shut, and looks again; the planes start bombing the distant hangers
Red pisses along the wall as he races to the barracks, trying to get his pecker back into his drawers
He shouts to the sleeping guys -- Th-th-th-th-th- He slaps his face with both hands, and stomps his feet
Th-th-th-th-Dammit
Th-th-th- He still can't get it out, can't wake them; bursting with frustration, he suddenly blasts out singing -- (singing) The Jaaaps
The Jaaaps
He's belting it like a baritone in a bizarre opera
His friends stir; what the hell
Red points outside and tries to talk, but now he can't mutter a syllable
The guys hear the explosions, and realize
-  - The pilots stagger out, half drunk, half dressed
Seeing what's happening, they race toward the flight line, where the clustered American planes are blowing up in groups, and the pilots are knocked to the ground
Goddamn Japs
Billy jumps to his feet and starts to run toward a cluster of fighters that hasn't gone up yet
Billy
Anthony tries to grab him and drag him back to earth but he misses; Billy gets a few steps before the fire from a strafing Zero catches up to him; his friends watch in horror as Billy gets shorter as he runs; the Zero's machine gun fire is sawing his legs off from the feet up
Billy falls, legless but still alive; then a bomb falls almost on top of him, sending body parts over the pilots
Their innocence, like America's, is gone in that moment
- Danny and Rafe are in Danny's Buick, hung over and asleep, Danny in front, Rafe in back, and they're a miserable sight -- their shirts ripped, blood dried in a leak trail from one side of Rafe's nose and the corner of Danny's mouth
The rumble of planes moving overhead makes them stir; the rumble grows huge, as the shadows of a massive formation makes the sunlight flicker
Danny and Rafe squint up, their heads pounding, and realize what they're seeing
Suddenly their headaches are gone, and Danny's gunning the Buick down the road, toward the base
- Danny blasts through the main gate; the guards are too busy taking cover and haven't even closed the barrier
He races to the tarmac, where some of the planes are still undamaged
Rafe is out the door before the car stops rolling, and Danny's right behind him
They're running toward a cluster of fighters, when it goes up with a bomb blast
Rafe and Danny dive at each other; their first instinct is to cover their best friend with their own bodies
They look at each other on the ground
They see machine gun bullets thudding into the planes on the flight line, and ripping along the walls of the buildings
It's as if the whole Japanese airforce is attacking this one base, and not leaving a single plane airworthy
Get me into a plane
Come on
Danny sprints; Rafe follows
Danny reaches a phone booth, and digs a dime from his pants
You're making a phone call
Danny dials, as waves of bullets sweep the area, and more planes blow up on the flight line
Rafe thinks he's lost his mind
(into phone) This is Walker
We're under attack
Get those planes fueled and armed
He runs back toward the car; Rafe, in the nonsense of battle, reaches in to hang up the receiver, before Danny grabs him and leads him on a sprint to the car, as the phone booth shatters behind them from the strafing
On the way to the car they dive back to the ground to avoid strafing -- and see their friends lying nearby, in shock
They got Billy
Come with us
He and Rafe jump up and run again
Anthony, Red, and several other pilots reach the Buick and dive in
Danny drives away, through the strafing
Where are we going
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here
What's there
Six -40's
As the Zero pilots see the Buick moving, they go after it
Danny drives like a madman through the strafing, zigzagging and gunning the Buick's -8
-    - The number of attacking planes seems endless -- and their strategy flawless
Torpedoes hitting one ship lifts its hull with a blast, enabling the next wave of torpedoes to rush under and hit the next ship anchored behind
The American battleships are bobbing like see-saws
The  takes an entire barrage of torpedoes, blowing thirty foot holes along it's hull; the ship immediately begins to list
- Doors are wedged shut by the deformation of the structure; vertical ladders are becoming horizontal, and water is pouring in
Men fight their way up against the water
- Water is up to the trapped sailor's waists when they grab a wrench and start taking turns pounding
in Morse code on the bulkhead
- As the listing grows more severe, sailors start jumping from the deck into the water
Still the Marines on deck are firing back at the planes; some Marines are even using handguns
But courage does not save them
The men still on its deck try to run, but it's not just the fires and the water they can't escape; the gun turrets' 1400 pound shells break loose with the capsizing of the ship and tumble through everything like massive wrecking balls
The sailors and marines, thrown into the water, struggle to get away from the suction as the giant battleship turns turtle
men are sucked down with amazing force, every hair on their heads streaming behind them as they're snatched to the depths
, everyone and everything is spilling upside down
The ship's generators sputter out and the lights go out
The flashlights of the few sailors who can find them cut raggedly through the darkness, and water spills in
There is no escape
, the Oklahoma's superstructure hits bottom; some men are crushed there
For others it's salvation, as the  blows them toward the surface
the men are launched almost completely out of the water, before splashing back into the water and burning oil
few feet of the steel hull and a portion of the propeller protrude above the surface, but most of the Oklahoma is under water
Men in the water swim toward a medical launch carrying wounded away from the wreckage
bomb hits the launch and blows body parts everywhere
- In one compartment there are a dozen trapped men
They've survived the roll-over, and are in a chaotic world where the floor is now the ceiling
The water is up their waists
Some of the  are panicking
One sailor has a flashlight and switches it on, flashing the light from face to face
Don't panic
Don't panic
The water's rising
It's coming up, we're all gonna drown
The air pressure will equalize it
But the water keeps rising, along with their fears
Several of the sailors are still screaming
The water's already to their bellies
One of them grabs a wrench and starts slamming Morse code against the bulkhead
One sailor in the middle of the room is particularly panicked, not just yelling but crying and whimpering -- Get me out
Get me out
Stop it
Come on
Save your air
'
He's at the lower end of the compartment, where the water is deeper -- the ship's nose is lower than her stern
The water's up to the guy's neck
The man with the flashlight dives down, and finds the guys foot wedged together in the pipes of the ships ceiling -- now their floor
He pops up again
The water's up to the trapped guy's mouth; he's already gagging
Is there a hacksaw in that locker
They open it; tools spill out -- among them is a hacksaw
They hand it to him; the sailor dives down and cuts off the guy's foot
The trapped man is underwater, muffling his scream
He comes free, and surfaces gasping
His severed foot floats to the surface and then the horror really hits them
The sailor with the flashlight pops up, in the blossoming of blood
He and another sailor tie a tourniquet around the stump, to stop the bleeding
The drama of this has caused the other trapped men to stop their signaling
Now they start banging, twice as loudly as before
-   - Haleiwa is a tiny airfield, tucked among the green volcanic hills; its barely paved, and it's only permanent building is a quonset hut
mechanic named , is out with the -40's; and these are spread out, not bunched
-40' The planes here have received loving care from Earl -- which means lots of cursing; as he's wrestling to load an ammo belt, he yells
Sum-bitch
The Buick, bullet holes punched through the truck, slides to a stop near the planes, and the pilots jump out
They ready, Earl
They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit
What stops him is the cloud of Zeros and dive bombers, shrieking in
Cover
The guys scatter
There are sandbags around the hut, and they run there, diving into it's shelter just before the first strafing pass, when a Zero strafes one of the -40's and a dive bomber blasts another
Earl stands up in shock and fury
You absolute mother-fuckin' son of a bitch
You shot one of my planes
Danny pulls him down, as the Zeros roar overhead
This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two
They're coming around for another pass
You got extra weapons and ammo
Cock-suckin' right  do
In the gun lockers
You guys get those
Earl, Rafe, come with me
Danny, Rafe and Earl run to the planes that got hit and strip out the 20mm cannons and ammo
- The other pilots run in, throw open the gun locker, and start grabbing weapons -- aircraft machine guns, ammo belts, one even grabs a rifle
The two groups run back and start to set up
Danny, over there
We're in a canyon, they'll come straight down it, we'll get 'em in a crossfire
Danny, Rafe and Earl run to a gully opposite the shed and set up there, as the other pilots brace the machine guns against the sandbags
The Japanese planes attacks again
This time the lead plane hits a wall of steel fired from the combined guns; the bullets chew into the bomb it carries and the plane
The airborne debris makes the following planes shear off
Red's standing, firing; he yells at the Zeros -- -don't like it when we fight back, do ya
Red runs out with his machine gun and keeps firing even when the planes have passed, trying to shoot them right up the ass
Earl
You said the planes were ready but -- but what
Of the four left, only one is full of fuel
Will the others get into the air
Earl shoots a look to Rafe, then turns to Danny
Danny,  don't like this fuckin' guy
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns
Coma, you cover the cannons
Joe, Theo, come with us
Earl, you get on the radio
We're gonna fight these fuckers
Two of the pilots, Joe and Theo, run to Danny
How do we do it
Your call, Rafe
Get rolling as fast as you can
Stay low
We'll use the topography to separate them and then we can take 'em one on one
They race toward the planes, and the Japanese attack again
Seeing the pilots running for the -40's, the Zeros aim for them; Rafe and Danny race for the most distant of the planes; Joe and Theo run for the closer planes, through the dusty bullet hits
Theo makes his plane and is just strapping himself in when bullets stitch his fuselage, wounding him
He still forces the plane forward
He taxis twenty feet and his cockpit gets chopped up and the plane arches into a right turn and putters to a stop, Theo dead at the controls
Joe doesn't bother to strap in; he hits the throttle hard and heads down the runway
The Zeros are on him as he gets ten feet of air at 120
The Zero's bullets eat his canopy and plane skin; the plane breaks apart in mid air, spilling in gouts of flame as it smashes down on the tarmac
Rafe and Danny have reaches the more distant -40's and are revving their engines as they see Joe and Theo's fate
They throw on their radio headsets
Their way seems blocked:  they've got no runway behind them, the wreckage of four -40's scattered ahead of them, and the Zeros screaming over the low hills to attack them
Now Rafe and Danny talk through the radio
It's tight
Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season
Don't hit the barn
They gun their engines and roll through the grass on either side of the runway, dodging the burning planes; they lift off, clearing the quonset hut by a couple of inches
They blow right through the strafing fire, and into the sky
Eight Zeros are all over them
Earl is in the hut, on the radio and watching through binoculars
see six
seven
eight of the cocksuckers
Don't let 'em hurt my planes
Danny's swiveling in his seat, looking left, right, back
They're all over us
Bet they don't dust crops in Japan
Danny understands immediately, following Rafe's tactic as he breaks into a sharp turn and uses the hut, palm trees, and low hills to shake the Japs
They fly like crop dusters, skimming down a foot from the ground, then bobbing up, banking left and right
The Zeros have divided into two groups to chase them, their wings clipping tree tops as they try to follow the Americans
It feels like a 200
car chase, 20 feet off the ground, Rafe and Danny skimming and bobbing over the terrain, but there are too many Japanese
Danny
Let's play some chicken
Danny banks in one direction, Rafe in another
- The two -40's are screaming, rushing at each other like they did at the training base back in the states, flying right into each other's propellers; the Japanese heading after them realize they're rushing headlong at the other group
Oh shit, oh shit
He can't even watch
At the last instant Rafe and Danny snap a quarter spin so the planes flash by belly to belly
Two of the Zeros collide in mid-air, exploding, as the other Zeros scatter
- Danny and Rafe rejoin each other in the open sky; they've lost the Zeros
The -40's are flying smoothly, side by side
The two pilots look across at each other, going into battle together
They speak through their radios
You hear my okay
Yeah
So you can call me if you need help
got a half a tank
You
Little less
He fires a short burst to see if his guns work; they do
Rafe does the same
Up ahead they see a formation of Japanese planes, headed toward Pearl
They're in strafing formation, we'll blow right through their line
They look across at each other
Land of the free
Home of the brave
Side by side the -40's scream in
-   - The Japanese planes are in tight, disciplined formation, their minds on the targets below them in the harbor
But their day of shooting sitting ducks changes as the two -40's blast in, wing guns blazing, chopping into Two Zeros
Both Zeros falter and begin to lose altitude
The -40's make almost impossible tight turns, still side-by-side, and go after the two plane they crippled on the first pass
Rafe finishes one Zero, making it explode in a ball of flame in the air
Danny finishes the other, shooting off its wing so that it spirals into the sea and crashes there
The -40's swoop up again
They're trying to hold formation
We can chew 'em up
The -40's dig in again, swooping down on the line of Zeros
Rafe hits first, machine gunning one plane, and Danny comes in behind it, finishing it off
The Japanese pilots are screaming at each other over their radios, but their   sees Pearl Harbor ahead, and tells them -- Hold the line
The -40's come through again, their guns spitting fire
- These planes are different -- high altitude bombers with three-man crews, high above the harbor
The bombardier looks through his sight and the bomb bays open
' , the ships look like tops, far below
The bombardier is ticking off the targets as they pass, the first two he mentions already burning
West Virginia
Oklahoma
Ah, Arizona
He flips his bomb switch, and a    falls away
- We stay with the bomb as it falls through the sky
The small propeller on the bomb's nose spins in the air, running the arming mechanism into the bomb's explosive core
The bomb wobbles a bit at first, but then as it gathers speed its fins stabilize it, and it falls faster and faster, at a dizzying rate, toward the Arizona
It slams through the teak wood deck, and breaks it like matchsticks
It's tremendous weight and speed carry it through the next deck, and the next, deep into the heart of the ship
toward the powder room, where two million pounds of black powder are waiting
The bomb hits there, and the explosion is almost beyond comprehension
Over 1400 men die instantly
- The battleship Arizona leaps into the air, the ship's spine is broken, it's guts ripped open in one explosive instant
Men on the deck are thrown into the burning oil already floating on the water from the other ruptured ships, but there are almost no survivors
The concussion of the explosion blows men off the repair ship Vestal, next to the Arizona, saving Vestal, as the explosion snuffs out the fires on Vestal; it also sends tons of debris down on her decks -- parts of the ship, legs, arms and heads of men, all sorts of bodies
Debris from the Arizona also cover the Tennessee and does more damage than the two Japanese bombs that hit her
-  - Medics have already started bringing in the wounded
Evelyn is like a frantic traffic cop
Put criticals in ward one, stables in two
Barbara
Fill every syringe you can find with stimulant and antibiotic -- Where are the doctors
On the third tee
Evelyn
Where's the morphine
Evelyn runs in, snaps open the cabinet, grabs a bag of morphine sticks, and is about to run out again when she sees the Arizona go up
For a moment she's frozen, then she actually sees the shock wave traveling across the bay and through the trees like an invisible wall
She's trying to cross her arms over her face, and dive to the floor, just as the windows blow out from the concussion, and glass flies over everything
- They see the results of their bomb, and are ecstatic
- The nose of Danny's plane is pointed right at the harbor and he sees the sudden devastation of the Arizona
It is a sight so awesome it freezes him for a moment
Zero comes up behind him, firing
Danny jerks his stick to maneuver but he's caught
Rafe comes in behind the Zero, chopping it up, even as he yells at Danny over the radio -- Ain't no time for spectatin'
They turn back after the line of Zeros
There are some Japanese planes coming after them now, but the -40's head at their noses, firing, then duck past in a double maneuver, and turn right back into the Japanese formation
Rafe has a plane in his sights, but his guns fire only a short burst before stopping
'm out of ammo
'm out of fuel
They head back
single Zero is on their way
Rafe charges it and draws its fire; Danny comes in behind the Zero and rakes its cockpit; the Japanese pilot backs off
The -40's dive back toward Haleiwa
handful of Zeros returning from Pearl see them and follow
-   - The second wave of planes takes off from the carriers
-   - Genda reports to Yamamoto
Second attack wave is in the air
- The  , handed a message by the army officer, stops playing the soothing Hawaiian music and announces
All Army, Navy, and Marine personnel to report to duty
'  - General  is in his office; he and his aides are working frantically
Mobilize everything
We're at war
Send a message to Washington:  Hostilities with Japan commenced with an air raid on Pearl Harbor
-   - President Roosevelt is having lunch in the Oval Room study with Harry Hopkins
The phone  and Hopkins answers
Oval Room
Yes, he is
(to Roosevelt) It's Knox, Mr
President
(taking phone) Yes
He listens, then puts the receiver down, shaken
The Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor
My God
Do we have damage estimates
Our Pacific Fleet, at anchor, unprepared
It's terrible
It has to be
And it's not over
-   - The two -40's drop out of the sky and bounce to a landing; Anthony and Red have been pushing the wreckage off the field with the Buick
Danny and Rafe pull the -40's behind the burning quonset hut, and it's like a pit stop at a race track; Earl rushes up and starts fueling the planes, their engines still running
We need ammo too
Earl shouts instructions to the pilots
Strip it from the wrecks
The other pilots race to the wrecked -40's and start pulling out ammo belts
Earl glares at the smoking engine of Danny's plane, and the bullet holes
Who the fuck taught you to fly
He did
Earl looks at Rafe's plane, more shot-up and abused than Danny's
Rafe grins and waves to him
Earl mumbles a stream of guttural and unintelligible obscenities
The Zeros that followed them sweep down, strafing
One mechanic, running across the field with a belt of ammo, goes down
Coma, running behind him, picks up the fallen man's ammo and his own, bringing both to the planes behind the hut
He, Red, and Anthony reload the machine guns in Rafe and Danny's planes
Rafe and Danny gun their engines and head back into the air, the grounded pilots firing a covering barrage and Earl even coming up with a 12-gauge shotgun to fire at the Zeros as they rush past
- The Second Wave of Japanese planes is in tight formation
- Lt
Commander , leader of the second attack wave, says calmly into his radio
Second wave, deploy over the military bases
High level bombers to the air stations, dive bombers attack ships in harbor
Fighters strafe and cover
He leads the second wave in on their attack run
- The navy's planes, bunched up on the naval airfield, are destroyed without ever getting into the air
- The harbor is already a mass of destruction and panic; screaming everywhere, men trying to fight fires, move the wounded; the second wave of planes hits, and tremendous explosions now rock the secondary ships like the destroyer , blasting it apart
But the Japanese pilots are now having trouble with the thick black smoke coming out of the damaged ships, and off the oil fires along the water
One torpedo plane, its pilot flying blind, clips the superstructure of a battleship and spins to a crash
Still, even      , the sailors struggle to survive, inventively
Men trapped on one burning ship use the severed barrel of a five-inch naval gun as a bridge to cross to the less damaged ship anchored beside them
Others jump into the water and swim through the burning oil, towing buddies too wounded to swim themselves
- Below decks, sailors have organized a line and are passing ammunition from the ammo lockers, hand to hand up to the guns on deck
Blasts from bombs hit them and ignite the ammo they're holding, setting off a chain reaction of explosions
On the deck, the sailors are out of ammo
An  grabs a Grab a dinghy and get ammo from the base ammo storeroom
The young sailor jumps to a dinghy and launches it through the oily waters and thick black smoke
- The sailors in the boat get strafed, the rounds cutting between them and blasting their boat in two
They jump into the oily water and swim toward shore
Other sailors are in the water with them, struggling, swallowing the vile black liquid as they battle to swim
Errant bombs and shrapnel hit beside them, killing some; other lose strength and slide beneath the surface
The sailors from the ammo boat make it ashore; it's hot there too, with bullets and bombs all around
One sailor has to stop and puke from the oil; his buddy grabs him and they run for cover; they find it in the dugout of the baseball diamond
- leads men in a race through strafing fire to the bases ammo storeroom
- The   is at his post
We need weapons and ammo
You need authorization
The fuck  do
He pushes the man out of the way and starts grabbing weapons
- The gunnery sergeant and his marines run with a water-cooled machine gun, across the open ground, under fire
The Marines set up in the windows of their already-strafed barracks, and start firing there, as the Zeros scream past
- Trucks are moving dependents -- women and children -- from the dependents' housing area
The Japanese strafe the trucks, dependents diving for cover
fire engine from the Honolulu Fire Department races up to the sight of buildings burning from the air attack
As the firemen jump out, a Zero strafes them, gunning down the firemen
As the strafing Zero starts to bank away, two -40's come in behind it, both of them gunning away
The Zero comes apart under the barrage, and crashes in a ball of flame
It's Rafe and Danny, back in the air
- The once-pristine hospital with its glowing white beds is now a bloody chaos
Every bed is already full; there are burned and broken people on the floor -- soldiers, sailors, civilians, firemen, all mixed in together
People are dying everywhere, and screaming in pain, or moaning and begging for help
At first we don't see Evelyn, and wonder if she survived the glass; then we see her, flecks of her own blood dotting her face and arms
The blood of soldiers on her surgical apron
steel calm has replaced her earlier frenzy, even as the other nurses are breaking down
can't tell who's gotten morphine and who hasn't
Take a grease pencil and mark an  on the forehead of everyone you stick
young doctor is trying to give an intravenous injection to a man who's badly charred; the doctors hands are shaking
Don't look for a vein, just poke
My pen's dry

Use ammo belts for tourniquets, use your own nylons if you have to
Barbara
Grab anything that will hold a pint of blood and sterilize it
The doctors are amputating limbs right there in the hallway
calls -- Evelyn
You have to do the triage
They're bringing them in with trucks
Evelyn moves to the door
Trucks are pulling up, loaded with the wounded, young terrified soldiers bringing them inside; Evelyn does quick triage as they pass
Critical -- front ward
Give him morphine, he can't wait
The next body through is a pilot, wings on his uniform, his chest riddled with bullets -- and his face shot off
For a moment Evelyn falters, then she forces herself to check the dog tags
It isn't Rafe or Danny
Evelyn sags in guilty relief
Take him outside and cover him; he's dead
She steadies herself as the next body comes through, a woman on a stretcher, her stomach shot open, pale hands clutching at the open wound
Evelyn feels for a pulse
She's gone too, take her -- It's Betty
And though the bombs are blasting and guns booming everywhere, the world goes silent for Evelyn
One of the sailors outside the door is pointing to the harbor, the Nevada has begun to move
- The battleship  is underway, plowing through the harbor, as the water erupts with bombs
'  - The Captain is struggling to save his ship
We can save her if we make the open sea
-     - The lead pilot in the next squad of Japanese planes spots the moving battleship, and leads his squadron on it
They come whipping in over the waves, dropping torpedoes and bombs
'  - The Nevada's Captain feels the ship shudder as it takes hits amidships
We're not gonna make it -- and if we go down here we block the channel
Beach her, there
His officers relay the order to the helm, and the ship's rudder turns as more blasts rip her hull
- The Nevada swings off its course and runs aground
'   - The impact jolts the boilers, already bursting with the steam pressure; gouts of steam from rupturing pipes scalds and blinds the engine room crew
- The Nevada, run aground at the shoreline, is now like a beast cut from the herd; the predators swarm after it with torpedoes and bombs
One torpedo, missing the Nevada, skims right up the beach itself and blasts a house on the shore to fragments
Bombs detonate along the Nevada, engulfing the entire upper deck in flames, ravaging the sailors
- The Nevada is grounded near the hospital; from the doorway Evelyn can see the whole ship on fire, burning sailors leaping off the decks
Her hearing, her presence of mind, returns; she lets Betty go, and grabs an
Go to the base hardware store and get some of those canister spray things they use for killing bugs
Insecticide
No, just the sprayers
We'll fill them with tannic acid, it'll sterilize them and cool the burns
The orderly races away
They can still hear the bombs falling outside
sailor staggers toward the hospital from the Nevada
He is completely gray
Everyone stares at him, and then realizes he is nude, burned gray, his skin ash
Evelyn rushes to help him, shouting back over her shoulder to the other nurses -- We're gonna need every bed
If they can breathe, make 'em get up and move someplace else
-   - The first wave of planes lands on the carrier
The flight leader rushes to the bridge
-  - Yamamoto's advisors are exultant
We have achieved complete surprise
The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes
We can launch a third wave, Admiral
The second wave has not returned
And we have no idea where their carriers are
What is the damage report
We have Commander Fuchida on the radio now, Admiral
Yamamoto nods and Fuchida's voice comes over the intercom
' am over the harbor now
- Fuchida is in a scout plane, high over Pearl
His vision is hampered by the thick black smoke, but he can tell there has been awesome devastation
He uses a diagram of the ships at anchor to note the damage to each ship
(into radio) We have a tremendous victory
Many ships damaged, some totally destroyed
But the Second Wave's attack is being hindered by the smoke
- The more we attack, the harder it is to find targets
And we no longer have surprise
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year
And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all
(beat) As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw
- The last planes touch down, and the lead carrier and the other ships in the Japanese assault fleet turn back toward home
-  - The harbor is a place of shattered bodies and shattered ships
Blood, body parts, debris everywhere, and all of it made more hellish by the oil fires on the water and the choking black smoke those fires produce
Every survivor has become an emergency fireman, stretcher bearer, medic, iron worker
They fish men from the water, extract them from the tangled wreckage of the ships
Everyone is screaming and yelling -- the wounded for help, the helpers for more help
Local firemen and civilians battle heroically too; the water mains are ruptured, so they put pump water from the base swimming pool toward the burning ships
The  records this with his black-and-white film camera
He is shaken, and yet he understands the magnitude of what he is recording -- the loss of America's innocence
-  - In one place, outside a barracks, soldiers hit by the bombs are just becoming conscious
One of them comes to
Sarge
Where are you, Sarge
He's crawling around toward the bushes; his legs are shattered, but he's spotted a body
He reaches it, turns it over -- and it's headless
He turns away in horror
and finds himself staring at the severed head
The medics appear
We've got two more over here
'  - The Western Union messenger, Tadao Fuchikami, delivers the telegram from Washington
'  - Short and his staff are assessing damage
want lookouts and sentries everywhere, with orders to shoot first and ask questions later
You think an invasion possible, General
After this morning, we better not consider anything impossible
An aide hands Short the telegram
He reads it -- From Washington
"Intelligence reports an ultimatum from Japan to be given precisely at one p
m
Washington time
Just what significance the hour set may have we do not know, but be on alert accordingly
" The irony is bitter in his throat
-  - The Honolulu police roar up to the embassy in squad cars, and burst through the doors
-  - The police storm through the embassy and find the Japanese there burning documents
-  - Divers are going down, trying to save the trapped men
But the tangle of the Arizona is horrific
One diver gets trapped, and another tries to extricate him, and the steel shifts and falls on them both
- , a naval oversees rescue efforts
The 17-year-old sailor he sent off for ammo now approaches him, with great concern
-- Sir,
lost the dinghy
The captain looks out over the wreckage, great battleships devastated in every direction
Well, son, we won't worry about the dinghy today
-   - Danny and Rafe arrive at the hospital
Their fears of what they might find aren't helped when they see the stairs into the hospital covered in blood
-   - Rafe and Danny enter
It's a scene from hell
Doctors are doing amputations in the hallway
The once-pristine hospital is now all red, with blood dripping through the mattresses, onto the floor
In the main ward, Evelyn and the other nurses are using the fly sprayers to spritz cooling antiseptic on the charred bodies
Evelyn looks up and sees both Rafe and Danny
Her eyes register relief, but they are the only part of her that can show emotion now; the rest of her is covered in blood
Rafe and Danny move to her
How can we help
-   - Rafe and Danny sit quietly as Evelyn adjusts the tubes conducting blood from their arms into sterilized Coke bottles for transfusion
What else can we do
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just -- She stops, afraid if she says more, she'll lose grip on her emotions
She can see the wreckage out in the harbor
There was a sailor, a black man on the West Virginia, named Dorie Miller
'd like to know if he's alive
She goes back to her work
- Rafe and Danny hop from the ambulance in which they've hitched a ride to the harbor
They see the awful devastation
- Rafe and Danny reach the West Virginia's pier, but in the darkness, they can't find anything
They stop a Where is the West Virginia
There
He points; the battleship has sunk, its superstructure barely showing above the water
It looks hopeless to find a single sailor here; but then they see a powerful black sailor, pulling to the dock with a dinghy full of dead men retrieved from the water
As workers unload the bodies, the black sailor sits down, exhausted physically and emotionally, his head in his hands
Rafe and Danny approach him
We're looking for Dorie Miller
That's me, Sir
friend of ours wanted to be sure you're alive
Evelyn
nurse
How is she
Like we all are
Miller nods, and looks out over the harbor, a hellish place where black smoke still hangs over everything, the shattered remains of men and ships still in the harbor
It's total devastation
And yet something about that scene stirs something else in Dorie Miller
There's something out there  need to get
Will you help me
-  - Dorie pilots the dinghy through the floating debris
Rafe and Danny sit with him
He stops over a dangerous pile of superstructure wreckage
The Arizona
Hold the dinghy steady, so it doesn't bust open
Rafe and Danny brace the dinghy so it doesn't move; but they still don't see what Dorie is after as he fishes down in the water, for something barely at the surface; he works for a moment, then pulls it up
It's the oil-soaked flag of the Arizona
- Men are working through the night to save the sailors trapped in the hull
- are in total darkness
From it we hear , then -- What's that
The light comes on and sweeps around the faces
The water is up to their chests, but it's stopped rising
Just hand on
They'll find us
How do you know
Because we would find them
He switches the light off again
- The welders are cutting away, the torches sending showers of sparks everywhere
- They are gasping, running out of air
Breathe easy
Stay calm
You hear something
Something stirs in the ship; a noise
from where
Then a point of light; sparks fly into the room; somebody's cutting through the wall
And the sparks illuminate faces suddenly filled with hope
But as the cut enlarges, the trapped air, compressed by the water, starts rushing out -- and the water starts rising again
The trapped sailors hope turns to terror
It's letting out air, and letting in water
The steel circle pops out, and they knock the welders down in their hurry to escape
Some of the sailors who were trapped are naked
They fight their way toward the escape hole cut into the hull, assisted by rescue workers
- The trapped sailors emerge, and they can barely take in the devastation
Destroyed ships everywhere, the smoking wreckage
The rescued sailors gaze around them in shock
They are shivering, and other sailors put blankets around them
- The entire Washington press corps is waiting, with fresh bulbs in the flash attachments of cameras that are already as big as a shoe box
The President is wheeled out of the White House, and not a single photographer takes a picture
not yet
Aides help Roosevelt from the chair, and the press people all see the President struggle on legs that have no strength, to the podium
His aides lock the steel clasps at the knees of his braces into place, and the President stands at the microphone
And suddenly, from the front, Roosevelt looks powerful, even majestic
Now all the bulbs pop and flash
He looks into the cameras
Yesterday, December 7, 1941 -- a date which will live in infamy -- the United States of American was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan
, we see the bombing, the aftermath, the bodies being fished from the oil-soaked harbor
The distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the attacks was planned many days or even weeks ago
During the intervening time the Japanese Government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace
- The Japanese fleet steams back toward Japan
The young officers are exultant
but Yamamoto is pensive
regret to tell you that many American lives have been lost
- We see rows of bodies outside the hospital where Evelyn works
The mess hall has been converted to a silent morgue, with bodies on every table
Yesterday the Japanese Government also launched an attack against Malaya
Last night Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong
Guam
,
- We see Japanese planes bombing islands, and soldiers attacking amphibious landings
the Philippine Islands
Wake Island
And this morning the Japanese attacked Midway Island
- The facts speak for themselves
With confidence in our armed forces -- with the unbounding determination of our people -- we will gain the inevitable triumph -- so help us God
ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, December 7, 1941, a state of war -- The words echoes out across America -- ' War
war
war
It rings through the radios of farm houses, to country boys gathered round; in the pool halls of big cities; in the fire houses and high schools
all across America -- men line up faster than the recruiters can handle them
- Roosevelt meets with his advisors
Gentlemen, the crisis we face is not the fact that our enemies believe they can defeat us -- it's the fact that our people believe it too
want a plan -- a workable plan -- to hit the heart of Japan, to bomb them the way they have bombed us
Mr
President, Pearl Harbor caught us because we didn't face facts
This isn't a time for ignoring them again
There are no planes in the entire American arsenal capable of covering the distance to Japan from any land base we control while carrying enough bombs to do any damage whatsoever
He's right, Mr
President
The Army has long range bombers, but no place to launch them from
Midway's too far, China is overrun by Japanese forces, and Russia refuses to go to war with Japan and won't allow us to launch a raid from there
The navy's planes are small, carry light loads, and have short range
We would have to get them within a few hundred miles of Japan, and therefore risk our carriers
And if we lose our carriers, we have no shield against invasion
What if the Japanese did invade
We've done studies
We're confident we would turn them back eventually
after they'd gotten as far as Chicago
Mr
President
with all respect
what you are asking can't be done
Roosevelt places his hands on the arms of his wheelchair, and struggles to lift himself
Aides jump to help him, but he waves them off
With inhuman physical effort, that has his neck veins bulging and sweat popping on his face, Roosevelt stands on his withered legs
Do not tell me
it can't be done
-   - There is a mass memorial service going on, with caskets draped in flags
There are also coffins covered in Japanese flags, their drowned fliers being treated now with respect
Everyone is in their best uniforms
The pilots -- Rafe, Danny, and the other guys -- are looking at Billy's coffin; Evelyn, next to Danny, on his appropriate side is looking at one that belongs to Betty
So is Red; he's grieving
Where is God in this
Our enemies believe a divine wind protects them
We see our friends laid out before us, and find it hard to believe in anything at all
Rafe and Evelyn exchange a glance, past Danny
Though we cannot understand why our friends should die while we live, we can affirm our truest selves in our belief that any God worth divinity would choose both justice and mercy, and would take these fallen brothers and sisters into eternal peace
Amen
As the mourners disperse, Evelyn puts a lei on Betty's casket; Red does the same, then breaks down beside Danny
As Danny comforts him, Evelyn moves to Rafe
Rafe -- need to tell you something
didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you
That you haven't lived and loved enough
didn't understand
Forgive me
Rafe
No
You forgive me
Of course  forgive you
know what you feel for Danny is real
And your choice is your choice
That's what  have to tell you, Rafe
It wasn't a choice
It -- An Army Corps  steps up and interrupts
Lieutenant Rafe McCawley
Yes, Major
Lieutenant Daniel Walker here too
Danny sees him and moves up
'm Walker
You're going Stateside
We fly out in half an hour
He hands them both orders
What for, Sir
Ask Colonel Doolittle
Those orders are from him
- The wrecked planes have been pushed off the runway and lie in piles
transport plane is fueling, and Rafe and Danny wait in the shade of a shelter
told her not to come
The Major, watching the fueling, gets a wave from the ground crew and turns and motions to Rafe and Danny that they're ready
They pick up their duffel bags -- and then Evelyn comes around the corner of the shelter
Rafe sees her first, but stops and looks away as Danny moves to her
For a moment he studies her eyes, and she does not look away
This hasn't been easy for any of us feel awful for how it's happened
But 've seen my first spring too
Thanks for knowing that's true
He takes her into his arms, kisses her tenderly but briefly, a final time
Evelyn's eyes find Rafe, but he can't look at her until the embrace is over
Rafe and Danny move to the plane and hurry up the steps
They turn before the door closes and wave to her
Evelyn's still standing there as the plane lifts away
- The transport has landed and taxied right to the door of a low, dark bunker, mostly underground
The Major leads Rafe and Danny inside
Rafe and Danny follow the Major down a spartan corridor; the whole place reeks of secrecy
-   - The Major opens the door for Rafe and Danny, then leaves, closing it behind him
Doolittle is alone at a desk
Rafe and Danny walk in and salute
Doolittle motions to the two chairs in front of the desk without looking up from the papers he's studying
heard what you did
We can explain, Colonel
Explain what
Whatever is was you heard about us
You mean the hula shirts you were flying in
Or the six planes you shot down
You're both being awarded the Silver Star, and promoted to captain
Is that the good new, Sir, or -- You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission 've been ordered to put together
Do you know what top secret is
Well sure, Colonel -- Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late
You can count on us
There's only one other thing  can tell you
Doolittle looks up from his paperwork for the first time
His eyes are fierce
You won't need any goddamn hula shirts
,  - Eglin Field is on the gulf coast of Florida
-   - room full of  are assembled, with and other
Danny and Rafe are there; Red and Anthony too
Attention
Colonel Doolittle strides into the room as all the men snap to attention
Be seated
The mission you've volunteered for is dangerous
How dangerous
Look at the man beside you
It's a good bet that six weeks from now, either you or he will be dead
Danny and Rafe whisper to each other -- Sorry you're gonna die -- cause 'm gonna make it
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes
You'll be flying multi-engines here
(whispering) Bombers
want to introduce a couple of people
Doc White is a flight surgeon; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission, because we can't spare the weight of an extra man
(whispering) long range bomber mission
And Ross Greening, who will oversee your equipment
Any questions
Who'll be the first one in, Colonel
'd like to volunt -- Rafe elbows his ribs so hard it takes his breath away
thought 'd made it clear, 'm not just putting this mission together -- 'm leading it myself
take it back, about the flowers
We're all gonna die
-  - -  -25 bomber, from different angles
The pilots look them over, liking what they see
This is what we'll fly -- the -25
There's one thing you have to be aware of from the very beginning
You see that private
They look down the runway a few hundred feet
private waves, and starts painting a red line across the runway
Another private, close by, paints a green line
Green means go
Red means dead
-   -   - The pilots practice takeoff's
Red is Rafe's copilot; Anthony is Danny's
Nobody can get airborne before the red line
-   - Doolittle is instructing the men
You're having trouble getting airborne in the shorter space because you're not revving the engines enough
You've got to push them to the limit before you ever start to move
Rafe is distracted; he's lost in though, looking at Danny -- and looks away just before Danny realizes it
-
- Pilots practice hard, revving the engines, taking off hard
all of them crossing the red line, takeoff after takeoff
Rafe pushes his engine hard and still crosses by twenty feet; Danny pushes even harder, and misses by ten feet
Doolittle watches with Greening from the edge of the runway
We've got to get the weight down
-   - Greening has removed the intensely complex Norden sight from a bomber and put in on a table for Doolittle
Okay, forty pounds gone
And in it's place, this
He shows Doolittle an aluminum strip on a swivel
Weight, 3 ounces
Cost, 20 cents
Does it work
- Doolittle pilots a -25 at treetop level onto a practice bombing range
Greening uses the makeshift sight, and drops a 500-lb sack of flour, right in the middle of the bull's-eye target chalked on the ground
- The -25's are practicing, flying at treetop level
Red is Rafe's copilot, Anthony is Danny's
Doolittle is flying the lead bomber
Right down to the treetops
Low as you can
Rafe brings his plane down, smoothly
Then Danny's plane appears -- under him
Rafe jerks his nose up quickly
Rafe's angry; Danny's laughing -- but he scares the shit out of his crew
- Danny's outside, looking up at the moon
Rafe appears and moves up beside him
Fun today
Like old times
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there
What do you mean
'm just doing what we've always done
No
You're trying to beat me
We've always tried to beat each other
Bullshit
We've played with each other, pushed each other
This is different
Like you want to prove that you're better than me
Who's that for -- Evelyn
Danny's anger flares for a moment -- but Rafe's hit home
Maybe just trying to measure up
What's between you and her is between you and her
But here's what's between you and me
Everybody has a hero, Danny
And you're mine
Danny's caught off-guard
When we were growing up,  had everything
You had nothing
You climbed out of a hole  couldn't even see the bottom of
think maybe when  went off to England,  was trying to measure up to you
Measuring up's over
Let's just look out for each other
Okay
They embrace, closer now than ever
- with the planes practicing their short takeoffs, we see Roosevelt in one of his fireside chats, his voice broadcast across America
' Good evening, America
Families all across America are gathered around radios, listening
' 'm told that 80% of American families are listening to these fireside chats of ours, and 'm happy we can come together, as one great American family
'd like each of you within the sound of my voice to find a map
The  do, gathering around encyclopedias, school books, any reference they have, spread on kitchen tables, suburban living room rugs, or farmhouse hearths
And the -25's, all sixteen of them, begin a journey in formation, flying at treetop level across America: Mississippi delta land, Texas plains, Arizona mesas
' Look at the Pacific Ocean
It covers half the surface of the earth
And look at the great Atlantic
The oceans both divide and connect us to our enemies, and either they will come to us, or we will go to them
The formation of -25's reaches San Francisco
- Doolittle leads the bombers to a landing
' , everybody's wondering why they're here
-naval station
What's g-going on
Wish  knew, Red
- The crews climb from their planes, and almost before they're out, teams of men use straps and cranes to hoist the bombers onto flatbed trucks
Doolittle walks up to Rafe and Danny, watching the baffling operation
Want to see where they're going
- Cranes lift the planes from the trucks and hoist them onto the flight decks of the carrier
The pilots stand on the pier, watching
guess that settles it
Somewhere in the Pacific
With a s-short r-runway
They all gather around Doolittle as he moves up to them
You have rooms at the Biltmore suggest a nice meal and a good night's sleep
We leave tomorrow
Doolittle walks to join a captain
/
- The pilots get off the bus and carry their duffels into the lobby
San Francisco, here we are
(grinning) don't reckon we can get hogbrains and grits, but  hear a man can eat good in this town
'm gonna turn in
hate being on the water
think this is the last sleep 'll get for awhile
- The other guys drop their duffels with the bell hops; Rafe moves to the reception desk
McCawley
The manager hands him a key, and smiles curiously
Have fun
- Rafe enters his room and finds the light on
and Evelyn's there waiting
What
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him needed to see you before you go
It must of been a convincing letter
It was
couldn't have you go away, wherever it is
to war
without knowing something
You think  made a choice, of Danny over you
didn't
didn't have a choice
'm pregnant
The blood drains from Rafe's heart
Yet he finds the strength to move to her
She turns away, so she won't throw her arms around him
Does Danny know
She shakes her head, refuses to cry
wasn't sure, until the day you turned up alive
never had a chance to tell him
Now  can't have him thinking about this when he needs to be thinking about his mission, and how to come back from it
She turns and faces him again
want you thinking about that too
Just come back
(beat) Rafe,  see it in your face
You're thinking you don't have anything to live for
Don't you dare think that way
'll never write a letter, or look at a sunset, without thinking of you
'll love you my whole life
And  want you to live
She looks at him, her eyes bright with tears, but still she refuses to cry
They both know they can't touch, or they'll never let go
She walks past him, out of the room, closing the door softly behind her
- The   clears the Golden Gate Bridge, with cruisers and destroyers rounding out its battle group
Rafe and Danny stand on the flight deck, watching the city recede behind them
Evelyn is on a hilltop watching them go
Danny can't see her, doesn't know she's there
Rafe can't see her either -- but he knows
' Army pilots to the briefing room
-   - The pilots are gathered expectantly in the carrier's conference room
Doolittle strides in
Gentlemen,  can now tell you that the target of this mission is Tokyo
The pilots love it
The ones who have not seen battle are grinning and vocal
Rafe, Danny, Anthony, and Red are quieter, savoring the prospect of revenge
And where's the secret base, Sir
The one we t-takeoff from
The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast
We'll launch off the carriers from there
Suddenly the pilots don't like the sound of this
Sir, has this ever been done, launching an army bomber off a navy carrier
No
Any other questions
-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but  ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne
Then wh-where do we land
have a phrase  want you all to memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi
"  It means " am an American
"  In Chinese
Absolute silence among the pilots
- The sailors who man the flight deck look at each other with bafflement as the worried pilots pace from one end of the deck to the other
They're in a line like ducks, Rafe in the lead and the others following, counting steps, each man measuring the distance
Shaking their heads, worrying
They stop at the end and look down at the sea far below them; it's dizzying
Anthony shoves Red for fun before grabbing his shoulder to stop him from falling
-a-asshole
Maybe it's l-longer going this way
He starts pacing back the other way, as if the ship's longer in that direction
The other pilots watch him for a moment, then follow him, counting again
Rafe and Danny are left standing alone at the end of the flight deck
Far over the surging sea
It's shorter than our practice runway
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch
That'll help
We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel
got another Chinese phrase for Doolittle
"Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork
"  It means "Who the fuck thought up this shit
" Doolittle appears right beside them
He was a navy man
Doolittle walks away
Maybe we'll be lucky with the weather
: -    - The Hornet tosses, bashed by a vicious storm
-   - The ships is rolling; most of the fliers are green
Doolittle stands at the podium
Since we'll be on our own once we're in the air,  thought  had a good idea letting each crew select it's own target
He looks at a pile of paper slips in front of him
Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace
and one for Tokyo baseball stadium
d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball
'd like to bomb their Emperor too
But think that'd just piss 'em off
The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge
We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior
So let's try this again
Military targets only
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy
To have strategy, ya gotta practice
And to practice it, ya gotta play -- No baseball diamonds, Red
-Yes Sir
- The storm is subsiding, but it's still raining
From the bridge of the Hornet, they spot the
The Enterprise will ride shotgun when we launch the bombers
They wanted our carriers at Pearl, and now we've come to them
If the Japanese get us, they'll be having dinner in San Francisco next month
-   - The preparations begin
Deck crews move the -25's to the rear of the flight deck
Fueling teams top off the bomber's gas tanks
Ordnance men hoist four bombs into each aircraft, and the army gunners load ammunition for the machine guns
Greening checks the planes' mechanical and hydraulic systems
And once again the pilots are out pacing the deck distance
It's turned into a game for them, walking off nerves
As Rafe and Danny pass
It's not getting any longer
Longer
It's getting shorter
-   - Doolittle is laying out the plan for all the pilots
We'll take off late this afternoon
'll hit Tokyo at dusk, and drop incendiary bombs
You'll come after me at night, guided by the fires
Then it's on to China, where you'll arrive at dawn, guided to their airfields by the homing beacons the Chinese are going to switch on for us
That's if everything is perfect -- like every other military mission 've ever been involved with
Doolittle looks around the room
No one's smiling
Listen you guys
'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you
'll have the shortest run
If  don't make it, you don't go
Colonel
we're all going
Whether you make it or not
know
- The cruiser Nashville is at the perimeter of the task force
It's lookouts spot Japanese patrol boats ahead
- The message is handed to Admiral Halsey
Sir, lookouts on the cruisers report patrol boats, ten miles away
The Japs have set up a picket line
Order the cruisers to open fire
We've got to sink them before they get a message away
- The cruiser  begins firing rounds at the Japanese patrol boat; round after round misses
'   - The operators hear the excited voices of Japanese radio traffic
They've reported our position
Tell the Admiral
- Doolittle hurries up to the command bridge, with the naval officers sent by the Admiral to fetch him
Doolittle sees the cruisers next to the carrier firing its guns -- at Japanese boats in the distance
- Doolittle finds the Admiral gathered with his staff, their mood is grim
How far are we from Tokyo
Seven hundred miles
'   - Rafe, Danny, and the other pilots are alone at their bunks, taking advantage of the lull before the mission
Rafe has paper and pen to write a letter, but he can't think of anything to write
Danny holds the "Picture of Paradise" that Sammy took, of Evelyn and the nurses in the sun
He tucks it inside his shirt, when he hears -- Army pilots, man your planes
-   - The pilots run onto deck
The cruiser next to the Hornet is still firing away at the Japanese patrol boat
Doolittle runs onto deck, shouting orders
Load in every bit of extra gas you can carry
And strip everything you don't need out of the planes
mean -   -    - It's starting to rain but the guys don't notice at all
They're stripping seats out of the planes, tossing out their own gear
Greening pulls the machine guns out of the rear of the planes and puts in broomsticks painted black
Off in the distance the Japanese patrol boat takes a hit and explodes
Rafe and Danny meet between their bombers
Broomsticks instead of tail guns
We'll get separated over the target, but you and  will rendezvous for the run to China
'm on your wing
And 'm on yours
Land of the free
Home of the Brave
They climb into their bombers
-   - The engines are revving
The tachs are showing redline
The crews are in their planes
Doolittle is first, just ahead of Rafe and Danny's -25's
The battle pennants whip, the props blur, the wheels strain against the brakes; from the cockpits the flight deck looks impossibly short
and the American flag cracks in the wind
And now every pilot looks at Doolittle's plane
Doolittle starts the run down the flight deck
faster
the end looming
He turns the plane almost vertical, standing it on its props
and lifts away smoothly
The sailors on deck cheer, like the Japanese did before Pearl Harbor
Rafe, Danny, and the others take off too
- The -25's head toward Japan
-     - Admiral Halsey, on the deck of the , watches as the last plane takes off
The planes recede in the distance, racing just a few feet over the water, toward Japan
Of all the other things this mission is doing that have never been done before
've never sent out planes that  wasn't going to see safely home
Let's get out of here
The task force runs for home
- At first the planes are together; Rafe and Danny can see each other off each other's wing, and Doolittle's plane is ahead
The others are grouped after them
They maintain strict radio silence, and can communicate only with gestures, hand signals, or a flasher for Morse code
When Rafe speaks to the crew of his own plane, it's by pressing an intercom sender to his throat
What's our  for Tokyo
The bombardier/navigator is already working out the numbers at his plotting table in the center of the plane
Almost exactly at 12 noon
High n-noon
k-kinda like that
Rafe looks over to Danny and gives him a thumbs up
'  - Danny calls back to his , who is watching the fuel supply
We got a 25-mile-an-hour head wind
How we doing with fuel
How do you think
The gunner is already pouring gas into the tanks from the extra cans
Anthony stands and moves back to the rear of the plane, pulls a piece of chalk from his pocket and writes on the nose of the bombs -- "For America,"  "For Pearl Harbor,"  "For the Arizona,"  "For Billy
" -- Rafe flies, lost in thought
-- Evelyn is back at Pearl, struggling to keep her mind on her work
-- Danny is looking at his gauges, then at the picture in his shirt
-   - It's a pleasant day, and the people of Tokyo are in a confident, happy mood
They're shopping, smiling, enjoying beautiful spring weather
The Emperor is on the garden of his palace having lunch
- The American planes are coming
'  - He and his navigator confer
' Time for the others to break off
His copilot uses the flashes to signal the other planes
They break off for their individual targets, every plane now on it's own
- This is the nerve center of Tokyo's defense
An receives a message and reports to his supervisor
Coastal stations report a low flying plane coming in off the sea
From the sea
That couldn't be right, it must be part of the air raid practice this morning
- The planes reach the Japanese coastline, and start skimming over treetop level
- The office of an anti-aircraft battery blows its whistle; his crew mount their guns and swerves them around
The officer whistle's again and checks his watch
- Not bad
The crew dismount their guns; just a drill
-   - The Japanese people are unaware of the drill
People are browsing through open-air shops, where new radios are turned on, playing music
And Tokyo Rose is talking -- in English and Japanese
(  ) It is another beautiful day in Tokyo, as all of Japan basks in a new day of victory
- Coma, Danny's navigator, picks this up
Listen to this -- it's Tokyo Rose
(  ) Our brave sailors and soldiers, inspired by our divine Emperor, have pushed the Americans from the Pacific
These words go through the plane; and in the other planes they hear it too
(  ) But hiding at home will not save them
Each time the Americans have tasted the samurai spirit, they have learned the bitter taste of defeat, while Japan is embraced by the divine wind that has protected our island for seven centuries
- The planes reach Tokyo, and flash across the rooftops
'  - We'll give that bitch something to announce
Danny and Rafe give each other a wave, and divert toward their separate targets
Each plane is on its own now
- Doolittle's plane flashes right over the Emperor's palace
The Emperor sits in the garden, meditating
-   - Mothers walking their children see the planes flash by overhead, and like the people at Pearl, they think they are friendlies
toddler points up and smiles
His mother picks him up and hugs him happily
Yes
So beautiful
- Rafe's bombardier works his 20-cent bombsight, as Rafe holds the plane steady, bringing it up to 200 feet
They scan for fighter or anti-aircraft fire
There isn't any
Open bomb bay doors
'  runs toward its target
'  races over Tokyo
Bomb bay doors open, sir
It's all yours
The bombardier hits the first switch
The bomb falls toward a factory
It strikes home, right on target
The blast is shocking -- it blows debris higher than the plane
-   - The individual planes drop their bombs, four per plane, on shipyards, factories, oil supplies, weapons facilities
Their bombing is highly accurate
On the ground, at the open-air market, for a brief moment Radio Tokyo goes silent; then -- (  ) We interrupt this broadcast
Tokyo is being bombed
'  - The Emperor looks up at the sound of air raid sirens and distant explosions
' Surely just a drill, Divine One
'  - Last bomb away
It slams into a factory, blowing debris everywhere and turning the factory into an inferno
Rafe's tail gunner sees Zeros swarming in with vengeance
We got Zeros
And they're pissed off
Rafe changes course quickly
'  - Anti-aircraft  bursts in the sky in front of them; Danny takes evasive action
'  -   - Rafe pushes the engines to top speed and changes course again; but the -25's can't outrun the Zeros
Their fire chews into the bomber's tail, hitting the gunner
Red scrambles back to find the gunner dead
Can you get 'em off us
Red reacting to bullets coming through the rear of the fuselage, looks at the brooms protruding from the rear of the plane
Whatta ya want me to do, sweep 'em
As the bombardier, navigator, and Red jump onto the other machine guns, Rafe looks for a way out
He dives down toward the city
The Zeros follow
- Rafe takes the -25 right down among the buildings, sometimes even having to spin the wings to get through
The Zeros can't keep up with this
But Rafe can't keep it up long, either; they break out into open ground rail yards, where there's no place for him to hide
The Zeros come in to chew him up
But they take fire from another -25 -- Danny's -- coming in to save Rafe's plane
Rafe now uses the radio
Danny, get the hell out of here
But Danny stays, mixing it up with the Zeros; with both -25's together, their machine guns down one Zero and damage another
But there are too many
Rafe sees clouds coming in, and fog
Danny, run for the clouds
The bombers race toward the clouds, and make it; the Zeros lose them
-   - Rafe and Danny keep broken contact through the clouds, and settle in for the long run to China
'  - We burned a lot of fuel back there
Flash them and ask about their supply
'  - Anthony reads the Morse code
"How's your fuel
" Danny looks across to Rafe and shakes his head
'  -  ,  - Roosevelt is at his desk when General Marshall enters
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr
President
Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement
Have the planes made it to China
There've been some complications, Sir
The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set
And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway
So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it
God help them
- They've climbed above the clouds; the fliers are exhausted
The sun is beginning to set
Rafe stares at it
-   - The place is white again -- the white of bandages and casts
Everyone is busy, and even the wounded are looking out for each other; a man with his arms in an airplane splint holds a spoon and feeds a badly burned buddy
Evelyn and her overworked nurses are looking after the critical cases
But as she covers the windows with blackout curtains, she stops for just a moment to stare at the sun's last rays
- Colonel Doolittle can make out mountains below them
We'll fly till we run out of fuel, then bail out
Just then his engines start to sputter
Chute
He puts the plane on auto-pilot and the men move to the hatches
Three guys go out; it's just Doolittle and his copilot left
Nobody else is gonna make it either
If live through this, they're gonna put me in Leavenworth Prison
They jump
'  - Coma moves up to Danny
We're running out of fuel
And  can't find the beacon
Danny gestures across to Rafe that he hears nothing in his radio phones
Rafe gestures the same thing back
They look down and the entire ground is covered with clouds
don't know if we're over sea or land
Drop flares and try to spot something
- They drop flares; they disappear into the cloud cover and tell them nothing
-   '  - Danny's engines are sputtering; his gunner pours the last drops of gas into the tanks
Flash Rafe
We're gonna bail
Red sees Anthony signal
They've gotta jump
Not unless we know he's over land
Rafe yells at Danny, as if he could hear -- You are not bailing out into water
' Coastline below
Through a break in the clouds they spot a rocky shoreline
We've got coast
Signal him to climb and jump
Red signals; Danny's plane signals back
They don't have fuel to make altitude
He's gonna set it down in the water
Rafe looks over at Danny, who is gesturing; he gives up on the hand signals and grabs the flasher; Red reads the Morse code
--
-
You go on
Rafe grabs the flasher and angrily flashes back two letters
-
We stay together
'll go in first
Rafe turns his bomber and Danny follows, their planes arcing down toward the rocky coast; it's hairy, the clouds masking their view, as the altimeter winds down
At the last moment they see rocks looming out of the surf
'  - He's shouting to his crew -- Hang on tight
'll put her in the smooth water and we'll swim in
'  - His engines are sputtering, catching, sputtering; he fights to stay in control
- Rafe's plane settles down toward the water; he guns the engine to level out, and the plane skims across the surface; then the propellers catch and the plane stops like it hit a wall, flipping over it's nose
'  is struggling; when he tries to add throttle, the engines sputter out
The plane drops, skips once on the surface, then hits a shoreline rock belly first
Danny and Anthony are ejected through the top of the fuselage; Coma is hurled forward right through the glass nose of the plane
'  - Rafe and Red come to in the plane inverted and sinking
They react, unbuckling, grabbing for their crewmates as the plane is quickly filling
The navigator and gunner are unconscious; the bombardier is dead
Red struggles with the hatch and can't make it budge
It won't open til the plane fills
They struggle to breath as the water envelops them
But as the water reaches the top, Rafe takes a last breath and dives to the hatch; it comes open, and they swim up, dragging the rest of the crew
- They break the surface, and struggle to shore with the unconscious navigator and gunner
Rafe's looking everywhere; he sees Danny's plane crashed against the rock
He fights his way through the surf to Danny's plane, Red following
Rafe finds Danny face up in the water
Red finds Anthony on the rock
He's face up, but as Red lifts him he finds the back of Anthony's head is gone
The rest of Danny's crew are floating in the surf, dead
Rafe and Red pull Danny to shore
Danny
Danny's eyes flutter open; he sees Rafe and mumbles -- 've made better landings
Danny's hand gropes to his throat; Rafe finds a  shaped shard of the fuselage hooked into his neck
Rafe grabs it, trying to bend it open; the sharp metal cuts his hands, but he keeps straining
It won't work, He pulls his
45 from his jacket and tries to pry the metal
It works a bit; he tosses the pistol aside and grabs the shard again, and opens it
You hang on, Danny
You hang on
You're gonna make it
Rafe's head snaps forward, crunched with the butt of a rifle; a Japanese patrol, four men, have arrived
They're angry, scared, hyped
They knock Red down too, yelling and brandishing their rifles at the fliers on the beach, living and dead
The Japanese officer is barking orders
They find the Captain's insignia on Danny's jacket, and begin binding him to a yoke, his wrists tied to the wood like a crucifixion, a wire around his neck
They find the navigator unconscious, but alive
The officer snaps a single word and a soldier shoots the navigator
The others wire Rafe's ankles together
Rafe is emotionless
'  fades in and out
He hears Danny choking, and his mind sees Danny as a boy those long years ago, being carried by the neck across the field by his father
Then Rafe sees  :  Danny being half-carried, half- dragged by the neck by two Japanese
The officer is pulling Red along, hands bound behind him
And Rafe starts moving, being dragged on his back, pulled by his feet along the rocky sand
His hand slides by the pistol he tossed behind the rock
The whole world slows down
He clutches it, shoots one of the men towing Danny
And as the man dragging Rafe turns around, Rafe shoots him in the face
The officer spins, raising his rifle; the soldier pulling Red, shoves him onto his face in the sand and aims his rifle too
The officer is pulling the trigger to kill Rafe when Danny slams him down from behind
The fourth soldier shoots Danny in the gut, then takes aim for Rafe's heart -- and is shot through the chest from behind
The Japanese officers rises in surprise and is cut down by scythes carried by the Chinese peasant soldiers who are just arriving
Rafe struggles to Danny, moving the Chinese aside
Danny lies on his back, clutching his wound as if to hold onto his life
Danny
can't make it
Yes you can
But Danny is silent, his eyes drifting shut, and in that moment Rafe thinks he is gone already
Then Danny's eyes drift open, finding him
Take care of Evelyn
The words almost kill Rafe, filling him with grief
From somewhere he finds the strength to say -- will
And your baby
(beat) You're gonna be a father
Did Danny hear
His eyes are closed again
But his head comes up; Rafe takes it, and Danny pulls him closer to whisper -- No
You are
Rafe cradles Danny in his arms
Danny's eyes are open, but Rafe sees no light there
Danny
Land of the free
Land of the free
But Danny will never answer him again
Rafe hugs Danny tight, and weeps
- The news of the raid hits Washington
and the rest of America
If it isn't wild celebration; when people see the headline:     , and   ; their faces change, as if finally told what they already knew -- that America would prevail
The Doolittle Raid was the pivotal moment of America's war with Japan
Before it, America knew nothing but defeat; after it, nothing but victory
(beat) One crew of Doolittle's raiders made it to Vladivostok, Russia, where they were interred for much of the war
Thirteen planes crash landed in China, where the Chinese people helped the Americans escape, and had their villages destroyed and citizens executed by the Japanese forces of occupation
Two crews were captured by the Japanese and three fliers were executed without trial, called "war criminals" by the Japanese
Jimmy Doolittle was promoted to General, and given the medal of honor
We see the ceremony at the White House, as Roosevelt presents Doolittle with the metal
- Out by the crop dusting landing field is a memorial to Danny Walker, with an American flag flying high above it
Standing at the memorial are Rafe and Evelyn
Rafe holds a child in his arms, a boy, named Danny
