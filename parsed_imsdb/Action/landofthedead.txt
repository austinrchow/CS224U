Wanna get a drink, Riley
Just ook at me, you can tell  could use a drink
Later
Gotta see a man about a car

Charlie follows Riley, who strides into
an alley, surprised to find a cadre of rough-looking , led by , a defiant man who stands on a soapbox
small audience is gathered in front of him
He takes a swig from a bottle of whiskey
Irish accent) How long are you gonna let him push you around
If there was enough of us
if you all would join up with us
we could pull him down off his throne
Some of the people in the audience nervously shift their eyes to the '  - ten blocks away
You can't fix a place like this, Mulligan
You just have to get out of it
We've got the firepower, Riley
If you and your friends would come in with us, we'd be unstoppable
Mulligan holds out his bottle to Riley, who passes it to Charlie, who takes a swig
Everyone's stoppable
We hear the sound of a boy coughing
Mulligan's son stands behind him, looking feverish
You alright, son
'm fine, dad
As Riley starts past, he stops, pulls something from his pocket, and presses it into Mulligan's palm
Antibiotics
For your boy
Mulligan looks down with gratitude at a bottle his hand
When he looks up again, Riley is gone

Riley pulls it aside and looks in

Where's the car

My new car

An instant after he pushes the button
the door is   by  , 50-something, an African American man in a white butler's jacket
Frightened, he's wielding a , poised to strike

The only light comes from another room somewhere inside
soft, rhythmic , like a child's swing moving back and forth,  through the apartment
It's an eerie, incongruous sound
On guard, eyes straining, Cholo moves inside
The squeak gets louder, the light brighter as he turns a corner and sees
a - ,   from a suspended from a light fixture in the kitchen slowly, the harsh glare making the man's face even whiter than it is
toppled chair lies on the floor at his feet
Cholo stands transfixed for an instant
And in that instant
He whirls, ready to kill, but finds only a - , 60-something, wearing a tailored suit and expensive jewelry, her perfectness blemished only by her hysteria
My Johnny, he killed himself, he killed himself
My Johnny

Cholo shakes her, hard
Keep it together, lady
Behind them, in the kitchen, unseen, a dazed  , walks up to the hanging corpse
He rights the toppled chair and steps on it, lifting a paring to knife cut through the noose

Almost as soon as she does, a  can be heard from the kitchen, followed by another , this one coming from the Young Man

He approaches the kitchen, using the  to light his way
In the  , he sees

She fumbles with the weapon, not knowing how to make it work
The bitten security guard starts to lose all strength in his legs
The Dead Thing holds him up, as if waltzing with him, again and again
Cholo takes the gun from the woman and shoots the Hanged Man

What comes is
Alive, badly bruised, her dress in tatters
Despite tarnish, she still looks sexy

In the ring,  reaches for  again
With one lightning-fast move, she kicks it in the chest, sending it flying into Red's arms
Red shoves Black aside
Black makes another try for the woman
Red grabs its rival
This time Black hangs on to Red's shirt

She's agile
Strong
But she almost falls as the cage with the force of

On their way back through the arena,  and  push through the crowd, trying to reach the center ring steps in front of them
No guns in here
Riley gives him a rifle butt in the face and moves on
lack continues to climb the cage, almost out of reach, but Black grabs one of her ankles, pulling her down and slamming her to the ground

The round from his Glock misses Charlie completely
Riley runs to the cage, where Slack stands, trembling, just on the other side of the bars
You okay

She nods gratefully
hihuahua is still on his feet
And now he is really pissed
Not because of the holes in his gut, but because
My suit
You fucked up my new suit
Riley turns to Chihuahua, but doesn't have time to lift the -16 before
The little man  at him
Slack delivers a powerful  into the flexible fencing, sending Riley sprawling to the ground and saving him from
Chihuahua's round, which misses Riley

Spun around by the impact, she falls face down

Sure, a high-toned man likes to drink out of a glass

Cholo tears open the box of Cohibas
He picks up two cigars, bites off the tips, puts one in his mouth, then, walking back to the Silhouetted Man, puts the other in his mouth, lighting them both with a wooden match that he strikes on his jeans

How long
This is an extremely desirable location
Space is limited
You mean restricted
Well,  do have a board of directors, a membership committee that has to approve

guess it takes more than money to become a "member"

Take my advice
Withdraw your funds from the bank and spend them somewhere else

Don't do this to me

No, no, no

Kaufman, who has drawn the pistol from his jacket, is still smiling
Maybe we should talk about this when you're less excited

They are in a jail cell that has brick walls and a small barred window facing a dark alley
, stripped of all his guns, stares outside longingly
(To Slack) Why you
In that arena
Why did the little fat man throw you in with those things
It wasn't the little man
It was the big man
The man upstairs
He's got his fingers in everything down here
If you can drink it, shoot it up, fuck it, or gamble on it, it belongs to him
He's just seein' that we get a few cheap kicks so we don't go thinkin' too hard about why he's eating steak and the rest of us are lucky to get the bones

All of them are nervous, pacing door opens and  is ushered into the room
Mister Denbo
Come in
Can  offer you a drink

Well, then
please sit down
Nobody else is sitting

While you tell me why 'm standing here
We need you to repossess a vehicle that belongs to us
The vehicle you designed, Mister Denbo
Dead Reckoning has been stolen
By your second in command
want him captured
Or killed
And  want my two-million-dollar piece of equipment returned
The truck
Which has guns
Big guns
That could do a great deal of damage if he were to aim them at this city
Why don't you just send out your troops
41
don't want to lose them
could send five hundred men against that thing and they'd all come back in body bags
It's your vehicle
Cholo was your man
You might be able to get close enough to
do what has to be done
(Refilling his scotch) Do this for me and 'll grant you something in return
Residence in the Green
Not me
That's what Cholo wanted, and you didn't give it to him, did you
That's why he's out there waving a cannon at your ass
Kaufman won't admit that Riley's right, but he looks at him with a glimmer of respect
(') Give me one of those vehicles, over in the depot, weapons, and enough ammunition to go north
But
there's nothing up north
That's the idea
Alright
You've named your price
An easy one to pay
One more thing
My friends
They go with me
Take them

He leads the way into the depot, his -16 at the ready
Behind him, all eyes peer nervously into the smoke
Everyone speaks in  tones
When the truck pulled out, it must have knocked the fence down
That's how they got in
That fencing was pushed in from outside
You know how many stenches it would take to do that
There's a thousand of them out there for every one of us
Good thing we're smarter

Kaufman leads Cliff into

Sutherland and the others can't hear, but can see, Kaufman and Cliff in

was just talking about how people can be replaced
You don't want to be replaced, do you
Nervous) No
No, and  don't want to replace you
You have promise
day may come when you earn yourself some responsibilities
Right now, the responsibilities are mine
All the responsibilities
It was my ingenuity that took an old world and made it into something new put up fences to make it safe hired soldiers and paid for their training
keep the people on the streets away from us by giving them their games and vices
It costs me money
But  spend it because the responsibility is mine
Now do you understand "responsibility"
Yes, but
No buts

Kaufman looks disappointed

Uses his pneumatic hammer to  at the safety glass
aufman can't take it anymore
He bolts for a stairway door
Cholo shoots
An arrows hits Kaufman in the back of his left calf
Kaufman sprawls, dropping both his bag of money and his gun, which skitters Kaway
Knipp rushes over to help Kaufman
Just let us go, Mister DeMora
Let us get out of here
(Calmly reloading) You can go, Knipp, but not him
Kaufman shakes Knipp off
His gun is ten feet away
He heads for it
Dragging himself on hands and knees
The chisel on Big Daddy's pneumatic hammer is the first tool to  the doors
The glass doesn't shatter; it  into tiny crystals stuck together by a thin plasticine coating
Puzzled by the sudden transformation of the glass into something that looks different, Big Daddy drops the pneumatic hammer and reaches out
The glass is different
It's soft
Flexible
Big Daddy    right through
Kaufman has almost reached his gun
Cholo shoots another arrow
This one hits Kaufman in the shoulder
You fucking spic bastard
think we should talk when you're a little less excited
Kaufman has a will of iron
He keeps going, gritting his teeth against the pain, reaching out for his gun, as
More tools  the doors
More through
aufman looks at his worst nightmare
Dead Things ripping their way through the cobwebbed doors, invading his temple

The commotion distracts Cholo just long enough for Kaufman to lift his gun and  nine rounds
ost of the shots miss
hit Cholo, one in the belly, one in the heart
He is slammed against the wall, his glazing eyes staring up into the atrium, the place he so desired
It's the last thing he sees before he keels over, dead
Knipp pulls Kaufman onto his feet
They look up to see
leading his army into the atrium
Kaufman aims and in the upper chest, blowing out of his back
The Dead Man feels no pain, but it focuses on Kaufman and starts after him with purpose
Kaufman sees something in Big Daddy's eyes
Something that's not dead
Kaufman fires again
He's out of ammo
Boss
We gotta get outa here
Knipp pulls Kaufman to a stairway door
They rush inside
The moment they're out of sight, the Walkers forget about them, moving on into the atrium
All except Big Daddy
That rage is still in its face as he lumbers toward the stairway door

In the distance, he sees

Riley hears the distinctive  of  ' engines, the  of its treads
He moves toward the sound as
a   looms three feet away
Riley lifts his pistol and puts a shell through the thing's skull
Blood flies, taking on the sudden glow of a halo as it is  by
the glare of  ' approaching headlights
The dead thing falls to the road, where
it is turned to apple butter by Dead Reckoning's enormous treads
Riley stands right in the vehicle's path

He doesn't move
tries to turn the wheel
Too late
(Pure anguish)
Three seconds later, Riley's figure comes scrambling across the windshield, climbing up toward

Kaufman disdainfully   the shanks of the arrows in his leg and shoulder
The two men reach a stretch
Knipp  the doors open and they get inside, Knipp behind the wheel, Kaufman in the luxurious back compartment, where he pours himself a scotch from the built-in bar
Knipp starts the engine
The   big-time in the concrete tomb
(Looking at the fuel gauge) We eed gas
Kaufman moans
Knipp steers the car slowly, carefully through the shadows, pulling in beside a   near the base of a  that leads up to the street
Knipp pushes a button that pops open the gas tank
He shuts the engine off and gets out, taking the keys, which have a Mag-Card attached to them

An scrolls "Thank you, Mr
Kaufman"
Knipp pulls the nozzle

You didn't gimme no gun, sir
Big Daddy moves to one of the rear windows
He can't see inside
The window is tinted
He returns to the clear windshield, looks back, at an angle, and sees Kaufman in the rear compartment
Big Daddy recognizes him
From upstairs
It's the man who shot him
The Dead Thing looks up
Sees the gasoline pump
His hand drops to the embroidery on its jump-suit
"Texaco"
He moves deliberately toward the pump
Pull out
Sorry, sir
Keys are in the pump
Big Daddy sees the nozzle on the cement
Picks it up, feeling the familiarity of it
Pulls the trigger
Gasoline squirts
The rage in his face turns to a kind of satisfaction
Using the nozzle as he did the pneumatic hammer, Big Daddy on the windshield, three times, before the He  the nozzle through the flexible fabric and pulls the trigger until it locks

Big Daddy pulls the driver side door open
As Knipp tries to run, he is  by Big Daddy

Sniffs him
Then flings him aside
Knipp is not his prey
With a glance at Kaufman, cowering in the back seat, Big Daddy slams the car door and, surprisingly, walks away
Up the ramp toward the street
The nozzle remains stuck in the "fabric" of the windshield
Gasoline continues to flow into the car
Kaufman crawls into the front seat, wincing from his wounds, and  the nozzle out of the window with his good leg, getting soaked with gas in the process
He opens the door
Limps to the pump
Grabs the keys

aufman shakes his head in disbelief
-no, y-you're dead
(Realization dawning) Oh my God
You're dead

aufman breaks for the driver's door
He never makes it
The Cholo Thing grabs him and  him down across the hood
Leans over him
Opens a drooling mouth
Kaufman whimpers

Kaufman looks up
It's not a bowling ball
It's an  , rolled down the ramp by Big Daddy

He looks at Brian, standing at Mulligan's side, his innocent face speckled with the blood of the dead
Riley shakes his head
It's all yours, Mulligan
