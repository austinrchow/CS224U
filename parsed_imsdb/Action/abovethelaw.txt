Burbank, California 91522               All Rights Reserved : 1     - show us   as a city boy in various growing-up , circa 1950's -- with street chums wearing a Wyatt Earp -shirt, in a communion suit
Then: in his first qi, a youngster studying the martial arts; he grows, we see news clippings of him winning trophies, his name on contest posters,  of him in action
Then: Japan
Nico now in his teens, studying with real masters, being dumped on his butt, posing smiling beside Japanese martial artists, then himself as an instructor
Now: a few military uniforms enter the picture, we see security clearance documents with Nico's picture and name on them
Then Nico near draft age with an American friend on some kind of training base
: 2
- Blowing through the roof of a dense jungle straight ,    to a
:  Viet - Cambodian Border, 1972
Jungle foliage whips in the fierce downdraft as -- 3   "" with  Army markings becomes discernible
The chopper lowers toward a crude landing zone hacked out of the wilderness
We  Cambodian troops and several machine gun positions around the
4
-    - watch from the edge of the landing zone
We recognize Nico and Fox, now in their twenties, dressed in the nonmilitary jungle attire that usually marks a  "spook
" 5 touches down
-- rough-looking, in their mid-thirties, all carrying some kind of medical bags -- disembark into the
They hit the ground nimbly, as if they've done it many times before
6 wears a khaki cowboy hat and packs a pearl-handled
45
7 don't know whether to react with laughter or uneasiness
2
You ever see chemical interrogation before
Nico's eyes stay on the approaching "cowboy,"  , for whom he plainly feels an instant animosity
These assholes are agency
8    ' the medical bag in the cowboy's hand
9 We're all
But these guys are from a page that ain't on the map
10
- Nico in the point,   leading Fox and the three  (Chemical Interrogation Team)   men down an unmarked, twisting trail
We see from Nico's   gait that he is athletic, a born leader and totally at home   in the jungle
11    - snakes along a ridge line, high enough to give us a view and let us know these guys are way out in the boonies
How long till we're across the border
We've been over for the past hour
The group continues along the ridge
: 12
- The sky glows from nearby bomb attacks
13 listening hard -- and even sniffing the air -- glances back at Zagon, who stands impatiently, drawing on a cigarette
What are you looking at, hotshot
(indicates cigarette glow) Why don't you light a bonfire
3
Irritably, Zagon ditches his smoke
Just drive the taxi, ace
As the party moves out, Fox flashes Nico a look as if to say, "Don't fuck with these guys
" 14
- pocket-fortified position
Armed Cambodian lookouts, several hooches, radio equipment
Nico leads the party in through the perimeter
Zagon eyes the layout like he's seen 100 of them
Fox indicates a hooch
(to Zagon) They're in there
The three  men start for the hooch
Nico casts a concerned glance around at the base camp troops, looking sloppy as hell
don't trust these yo-yo's
15     - We see Nico moving like a shadow from one defensive position to another, checking the perimeter
We can vaguely hear him the Cambodian lookouts, speaking in dialect
16     - hears a , looks back toward the hooch
17   '  - Two Asian prisoners, stripped to the waist, babbling in- coherently, are dragged out the back by a pair of Cambodian guards and hustled off into the darkness
can be heard inside the hooch
single lantern glowing inside gives the hut a creepy, frightening aspect
18 He's extremely uneasy about what's about to happen inside the hooch
19
-      - on which are spread a terrifying array of syringes, drug vials and surgical instruments
Zagon's hand picks up a hypodermic, squirt-tests it
4
20 are on their knees, shirtless, handcuffed with heavy nylon tape to a stake driven into the ground in the center of the hooch
One of the subordinate  men moves in, grabs the first prisoner by the shoulders
Zagon injects the first prisoner
Instantly the man begins shivering, convulsing
Zagon watches with professional satisfaction
That's the nice thing about modern technology
You don't have to wait for results
He moves close to the first prisoner
(to first prisoner) Where is it, Charley
You got six tons of our shit -- The prisoner tries to speak, but he's in such torment all that comes out is a blood-curdling wail -- 21
- hears this horrifying cry
He starts swiftly toward the hooch -- 22
- has moved as close to Zagon and the first prisoner as a fight referee to two boxers
The prisoner is convulsing wildly
Zagon grabs him fiercely by the hair
Don't you die on me, fucker -- (from the side) What the hell's wrong
(throws the prisoner down) This pussy can't hold his liquor
The first prisoner is plainly in a death spasm
23 enters at this point
He takes in the scene quickly, moves to a spot beside the entrance
Zagon doesn't look at Nico, but it's plain he is aware of Nico's presence
It is as if he wants to prove something to this muscular kid -- and prove it to the others, too
- Rev

24 dies in agony on the ground
25 watches with eyes like flint
He is in his mid-forties, scarred, missing several fingers
Probably a colonel or higher, he looks like he's been fighting these round-eyes since the French in the 50's
He is plainly one tough customer
The second prisoner meets Zagon's eyes, as if daring him to use the drugs on him, too
Zagon eyes the prisoner with barely contained hatred
The prisoner doesn't back down an inch
(to second prisoner) So my little doctor bag doesn't                      * scare you, eh
Well  don't need                     * it to open your yap
* Zagon reaches to a scabbard on his Western belt, pulls out a fearsome serrated blade -- a cross between a bowie knife and a scalpel
He steps toward the prisoner, displaying the blade in the lantern light
26 watches impassively
(
) (to prisoner) Where's our load, you sack of slime
What did you do with my shit
-- 27 punches  the prisoner full in the face, holding the knife handle  in his fist to double the force of the blow and to terrify  him with the proximity of the blade
The prisoner crashes  sideways, face bloody -- 'm gonna teach you good
'm gonna teach you never to fuck with my opium -- 28 seem to know exactly what this is about
29 didn't know, but the new kid on the block is catching on fast
Nico has difficulty containing his emotion
Zagon stands over the prisoner, as if daring him to get back up
6
The prisoner gets back to his knees, bloody eyes meeting Zagon's with defiance -- (to prisoner) You're a hard nigger, aren't you, boy
You took it from the Chinks
you took it from the French
You'll be fucked if some Yankee peckerwood's gonna start your gums flapping -- Nico watches Zagon move the knife blade closer to the prisoner
-- Well, you're gonna chirp for me, tough guy
You're gonna sing like a choir -- Nico takes a step toward Zagon
What the fuck does this have to do with military intelligence
Your orders are 'assist and observe' cherry -- Zagon turns to face Nico -- (to Nico) Back off, partner -- Zagon turns from Nico
He moves close to the second prisoner, close as a lover, displaying the blade in the lamplight
(to second prisoner) 'm gonna start carving at your ankles
We'll throw your feet in that box right over there
Then 'm gonna take off your arms -- One of the  men yanks the prisoner's leg forward, clamping it to the ground with his hands
The prisoner still hasn't flinched
He seems as locked into this dance of death as Zagon
(can't take much more) Fox -- Shut up, Nico
7
You can disappear as easy as this slope, kid -- Zagon starts for the prisoner
Here comes the blade
Suddenly -- Nico grabs Zagon's shoulder
Zagon spins with terrifying quickness, cocking the blade to slash at Nico
Before Zagon's blow even starts, Nico slams him with a ferocious elbow shot right under the jaw
Zagon literally comes off the ground, Nico's blow is so terrific
Zagon drops in an unconscious heap
In a flash the two other  men move to jump Nico
Smash
The second  man is swallowing his teeth
Fox leaps in the way of the third, shoves Nico out of the hooch -- 30
- Fox wrestles Nico away from the hooch -- Are you crazy
(as Nico jerks free) What the fuck's the matter with you
Nico is shaking with rage and fear
He takes several steps away from the hooch, then draws up abruptly
Nico pulls his 45 from his holster, pops the safety, starts back for the hooch -- Nico
don't cap him now, he's gonna do me later
The last  man appears, gun drawn, in the hooch doorway
Fox grabs Nico, hauls him back again -- 'll cover this
Get back to the -- (as Nico resists) -- 'll fix it
Get out
Get the fuck outa here
The  man calls out to the Cambodian troops, in dialect, pointing at Nico
The soldiers start toward Nico, as if to seize him
Fox, too, starts yelling to the troops in dialect, apparently countermanding the orders of the  men
The troops, confused, hold up for a moment
(to Nico) 'll call for a chopper
get outa here
- Rev

Nico gives a last look, turns and takes off down the jungle trail
Fox seems abandoned
The
Nico disappears into the darkness
: 31     - to reveal St
Elizabeth's, a huge parish church in an Italian/Latino neighborhood in Chicago
The church looks festive, we see a few formally-dressed people hurrying in, then a squad car pulls up
The cops run upstairs as if they're late -- 32
' - baptism in progress
Nico -- 15 years older than when we last saw him, is standing beside , his lovely wife        * -- watching a 60-ish priest,  , finish the final ritual on Nico's infant son Julian
The priest straightens the baby's baptismal garment, tugging the cloth around the little fellow's crotch
Smiles from friends and relatives clustered proudly around
Several cops, some in uniform are amongst them
Nico grabs his son from Genarro with a theatrical protective motion, tugs up the little boy's garment, kisses him smack on the bare butt
Laughter from all as Nico holds the lad high and proud
He puts his arm around Sara
* 33
'  -   - Huge trays of Italian delicacies are carried out into the sunlight by several "old country"-type women
Wine is poured from generous carafes
Friends and relatives are everywhere, laughing and enjoying themselves; apparently the party has come here straight from the church
Presents for the new baby are being opened by Nico's wife, Sara,        * and Nico's mother,
* Mama, look at this -- all done by hand
Sara lifts a cute baby outfit
* Nico had one just like this
Thank you, Cora
Cora, an aunt, proudly smiles
34 Holding the baby
Realizes that his little son has pooped in his pants
He turns for help to Sara
* - Rev
4/29/87                           9
think we got a little problem here
* (winking at the women) carried him for the last nine months, you take him for the next diaper
Assorted uncles and aunts watch with amusement as Nico tries awkwardly to deal with the problem
(to all) That's what you get for not marrying a Sicilian
Sara lets Nico struggle a moment, then takes over
* * My brave husband
He's not afraid of thieves and muggers, but he's terrified when his son poops in his pants
Toscani relatives look on with approval at the happy couple and their baby
35 Three Chicago cops,  and  in plain clothes and   in uniform wolf some Italian goodies while eying the group of celebrating relatives
(indicates Nico across the patio) Toscani holds the record
for havin' more relatives under federal indictment than any other cop in Chicago
36     ' and , who   look like they have been on the other side of a cop's work,   are in turn eying Lukich and Henderson -- plus a cluster of   other cops in civvies hovering around the buffet table like   vultures
Look at these stiff dicks
free meal and they come out like flies
37     '  - An unmarked police car pulls up
("Jax"), another undercover cop, tall, black, and elegant, enters the driveway leading to Nico's back yard -- - Rev
4/29/87                         10
38 Jackson enters
She's impeccably dressed and radiates intelligence
She's greeted warmly by Lukich, Henderson, Strozah, and a couple of other cops
didn't do nothing, Counselor
'm clean
Eight more days, Lieutenant
You better start preparing your defense
Baby, 'm gonna put you on retainer
You passed the bar
make it a point never to pass the bar
Jackson sees Nico and Sara across the yard, waves and          * starts toward them -- 39 Luigi indicates Jackson as she crosses the patio
Now this cop
She can bust me any day
40   ,    (' )                            * Jackson comes up, makes a theatrical appreciation of Nico's stylish attire, kisses Sara and greets Nico's mom warmly
* She starts oohing and ahhing over the baby
41 Young kids playing on the lawn, more guests arriving, Father Genarro dancing with an elderly matron
We see that Nico's friends are an electric mix
Cops, art-y types, people of varied ages and professions
42 Holding the baby
Look at this little bundle
What a cupcake
You give up being the
and hurry up and find the right fella, Jax
You might have time for one of these yourself
- Rev
4/29/87                        10A
* Nico, will you let the woman catch her breath
43     (
)                                  * moves in shyly on the fringe of the cluster
While Jackson and Sara continue their "mom" talk, Nico edges off toward      * Watanabe, shaking her hand with real pleasure
* Watanabe
Say hey, Doc
They begin jabbering in Japanese
We will meet Watanabe again later
She's a brainy-looking      * woman -- reserved, a bit mysterious -- who talks quietly and   * intensely in Japanese with Nico like they're old friends who go back a long way
- Rev
4/17/87                        11
* 44
- Branca, Luigi and several other Toscani patriarchs smoke cigars and sip beer in a cluster
Nico holds Julian
You're a father now
Are you gonna take me up on my offer
'm happy, Branca
like what  do
Branca glances seriously to the other uncles, then, with a smile, pats Nico's cheek
Look at this face
Six-foot-four, pretty as the statue of David
And he's a cop
Branca laughs
From a distance, Watanabe watches, missing nothing
Across the porch, Lukich and several other cops observe and try to listen
This face should be sticking up from a white shirt
It should be a banker, a businessman, someone who earns a decent living for his family
We're happy
Nickels and dimes
Your wife's a woman with class
What did she run -- a ballet school
An art gallery
Same thing
She wants a husband who carries a briefcase, not a shoulder holster
Jackson watches Nico trying to keep his good humor
This is serious stuff, despite the light tone
Branca's eyes meet Nico's
- Rev
4/29/87                        12
You wanted to get shot, you got shot
You wanted to get knifed, you got knifed
You've had your fun
Basta
Enough
Let your family help you, Nico
(lightly) Uncle Gio, that kind of help  don't need
'd rather get shot by someone don't know
Jackson and Lukich crack up
The others follow
For the moment, the tension is dispelled
45
'  -  - Nico comes out of the bedroom, adjusting his shoulder holster, tugging his jacket over it
He sees his mother standing near the head of the stairs, just outside another bedroom door
Concern on her face
What are you doing in here, Mama
Go join the party
Nico comes down the hall, tucking in his shirt -- stops to give his mother a squeeze
from the bedroom: the sound of
Nico glances in
46
-                                            * Sara and another woman sit on the bed, comforting a 60-ish   * grandmother Zingaro, who is crying
Nico comes in
He kneels before
, concerned
Mrs
(tries to be light) Is this a way to act on the day of my son's baptism
The poor woman can't meet Nico's eyes
* It's Lucy
She's gone again
Nico glances from Sara to Rosa
* Mrs
Zingaro shakes her head, choked with pain
Nico holds her, looking over her shoulder toward Sara
* It's that kid from the bar on Damen
The one with the drugs
- Rev
4/29/87                          13
Sara doesn't know
Nico does
He comforts Mrs
Zingaro   * another moment, then stands
Listen to me, Mrs
Are you listening
(as the woman nods miserably) have to go to work now
But 'll come by tonight
You'll be at the bakery
Si, Nico
We'll talk, okay
We'll find a way to take care of this
Nico kisses Mrs
He takes Sara's hand in goodbye,         * starts for the door
47
'  - Festivities still in progress
Nico passes through, nodding, thanking people for coming, taking farewells
Jackson waits for him, glancing at her watch
48
- Nico is driving
Jackson checks in on the radio
(into mike) Unit Ten Tango -ray
We're up and clear
49
- moves into the central city
50       -  - Bad-looking hombres on stoops, street corners
(
) promised the Lieutenant, 'm gonna take care of you
Broken windows and lost kittens for your last week
to include Nico and Jackson
And then you're gonna come visit me in a nice, clean, air conditioned office -- - Rev
4/29/87                          14
51
- '  -                         * The unmarked car pulls up outside a liquor store and bar
52 as it parks
Jackson gives Nico a look:     "What are we stopping at this dive for"
gotta take a quick leak
Stay put
He gets out of the car, starts for the bar
53
'  -                                  * Dim, smoke-choked, dangerous characters at the bar
Nico enters
- Rev
4/17/87                            15
His silk shirt and sport coat clash with the druggy, working- class attire of the bar's denizens
Hard faces check him out subtly, ignore him
Nico approaches the bartender, shows a photograph
The bartender ( ) shakes his head
* Why the fuck don't you assholes                        * leave me alone
* He continues mouthing off to Nico
Nico moves to one stool,     * then another; the same exchange is repeated
54                                  * hulking bruiser with an earring
He watches as -- 55 approaches him
Three   look up sullenly
Beefy arms, tattoos, greasy mustaches
Gentlemen
One Jacket treats him like he doesn't exist, and begins to pick his nose
(to others) thought this was a kosher bar
They didn't allow no pork in here
The two others snicker, then so does the rest of the bar
Nico holds out a photo of a young girl (Lucy)
You seen this girl
seen the top of her head
That's witty
- Rev
4/17/87                        15A
Nico takes a step away, as if moving on to the next stool
From behind the bar, the bartender swings a          * sawed-off baseball bat into view
Other bodies move         * ominously toward Nico
Suddenly he spins and, in a move     * almost too quick to see, he kicks the entire stool right out of its floor socket
Beer bottles fly, bodies crash
Nico slams the First Jacket in the face so hard it looks like his nose has exploded
Blood sprays onto Nico's silk shirt
He hauls the Second Jacket upright, nails him with a shot that crushes three ribs
savage elbow blasts the third, head over heels, out over the bar and careening into the sink
In three seconds 600 pounds of fat has been put in cold storage
The rest of the bar is on its feet
Four huge men confront Nico
Now five
Six
Seven
Nico's jacket and shirt are ripped, blood spat- tered; his eyes are like an animal's, daring the men -- Come on
Show me something
No one moves
- Rev
4/17/87                           16
* get it
It's a gay bar
Is that it
The men, led by the Bad Dude, are shifting to surround Nico
But no one attacks
Nico has Lucy's photo in his hand
He jams it in one man's face, then another's, slap- ping each one violently, spitting, raging for them to attack
You seen the top of her head, huh
Like  seen your mother's -- (to another guy) Or was it yours
(to a third) Or yours
(slaps him fero- ciously) couldn't tell, it looked like her ass -- Nico rages like a beast
Come on, motherfuckers
Do it
Do it
One man -- Nico lunges for the Bad Dude, grabs him like he's about to tear his face off -- Upstairs
(in terror) She's upstairs
4-
Nico drags the Dude from behind the bar
Holding him, Nico turns, glowering, to all
You cocksuckers are brave enough with 14-year-old girls
55A Nico throws Bad Dude down the hallway in front of him
56
-  - The door bursts in from a jackhammer kick
Nico stands in the hallway
Bad Dude stands next to him; hurt, shaking
(to Bad Dude) Get outta here
We look in the apartment
- Rev
4/17/87                         16A
- '                                            * young  -- quite  handsome in a boyish way -- stares up in panic from a grimy  mattress on the floor
Little is in bra and panties,  strung out, 14 and beautiful
Syringes and free-base  paraphernalia are on a table
* (to Pimp) This ain't your day, kid
Nico comes in, eyes taking in everything
- Rev
4/17/87                          17
Wait, man
It ain't like it looks -- Nico grabs the Pimp by the scruff of the neck, lifting him bodily
Lucy starts wailing in horror
Nico smashes the Pimp's face down into a mirror with white powder on the table -- That's two years
He jerks the Pimp back, rips open a drawer
More pills and glacene bags
That's four
(twisting the   Pimp's neck toward   Lucy) She'll get you eight   more
And 'm just warming up   -- Lucy is crying hysterically
Nico flings the Pimp, face          * bloody, toward the open door
* (to Nico, indicat- ing drugs) Take it, baby
It's all yours -- Get your clothes on, Lucy
There's money
Three grand in the mattress
(begging) can get ya more -- : 57
- Three young  have ambled to the window of her parked car
Hey, sister, what it be
With infinite boredom, Jackson lifts her badge -- and gun
The Studs shuffle away
58
- Other tenants stare from doorways as Nico drags the Pimp         * to the top of the flight of stairs, threatening to throw         * him down
* - Rev
4/17/87                        17A
* Don't you fuckin' move
* Nico steps back into the apartment, hauls out Lucy in      * a dressing gown
- Rev

59                                                  * The Pimp is dazed, bloody
Nico comes down with Lucy, hauls the Pimp to his feet -- Let him alone
He's beautiful
Not when  get through with him
Nico lifts the Pimp by the throat, pins him to the wall
No, man, wait
'll give you something
Something big
Please, Nico
Don't
It's huge
swear it shipment
coming in next Tuesday -- Shipment, my ass
This is square
On my mother's soul
You can't send me up -- Nico glances to Lucy
Half of him wants to tear the Pimp apart, the other half doesn't want to make the poor girl's life any more tragic
Besides, he's a good cop -- and maybe this "shipment" is on the level
heard it from a hooker friend of mine
She's banging some big coke lawyer, he told her
swear to Jesus
Nico relents -- a little
What lawyer
don't know
(sees Nico doesn't believe him) That platinum chola
Carla DeCarlo
she knows
Nico tightens his grip on the Pimp's throat
- Rev
4/17/87                          19
* She got popped this afternoon
She's downtown
Red dress, lizard shoes -- 60
- Jackson looks up from the car to see Nico -- wild-haired, shirt ripped and bloody -- emerging from the adjacent apartment stoop, leading young Lucy, who's tear-streaked, wearing a torn dressing gown
Instantly, Jackson is out of the car, moving to Lucy
It's okay, girl
Mama Jax is here
She wraps an arm around Lucy, helps her toward the car
(to Nico) That was some leak you took
From the door of the bar, several bloodied heads peek
Broken windows and lost pussy cats, huh
Jackson checks out her battered partner
You're one crazy bastard, Toscani
Nico opens the rear door, helps Jackson ease Lucy in
We'll get her some clothes and a bath
'm not bringing her home to her grandmother like this
: 61 62 63
- From the front seat of Nico's car emerges a tearful Lucy, in fresh clothes and looking miserably contrite
Nico walks her inside
- Rev

* The Zingaro family is busy preparing for the night's baking
Grandpa and Grandma Zingaro leave their work and receive their waif-like granddaughter
With eyes watering they thank Nico
They disappear upstairs with Lucy
Jackson, standing in the doorway, has seen all this
64
-  - Nico at the wheel has just pulled away from the bakery
Jackson, in the passenger seat, studies her partner for a few moments, shaking her head at the contradictions in this man
Educated, classy, an elegant dresser -- yet underneath an out-and-out wild man
don't get you, Toscani
(beat) What the hell are you doing being a shitheel cop
With your background
For a long moment Nico says nothing
Then, quietly, look- ing straight ahead: When  was overseas,  saw some things
Things that eat your guts out
Things that stay in front of your eyes like they were burned in and branded
He turns to Jackson
You can walk away from them, Jax
You can quit, but you know it's still going on
You try something anyway -- (smiles a moment) --  know 'm not going to change the world
can't stop the tonnage coming in,  can't fight the boys behind the desks pushing their buttons -- But maybe here, huh
(indicates street) Maybe in my own city, my own neighborhood, on my own block -- maybe here  can do something
He turns a corner
That's why 'm a shitheel cop

- Behind the desk, a few detectives man the phones
Latin attorney, , is at the counter
(
) You can see your client
As soon as she's through eating her dinner
65
- ""   - Hookers, female addicts, etc
in the downtown "cage
" Nico has the girl in the red dress and lizard shoes ( ) out in the hallway adjacent to the lock- up
Nico is Mr
Charm, offering her a heart-shaped box of chocolates
Carla

The hooker, Carla DeCarlo, slaps the box away, cursing in Spanish

Pinchi cabron, cabeza colon
Some of the chocolates tumble onto the lockup floor, the detainees snap them up, start munching
The girl con- tinues to spit curses at Nico, gesturing with her hands with Latin flamboyance
Nico grabs her by the elbow, as a jailer opens the lockup door
More curses are being flung at Nico from various females in the cage
Nico heaves Carla in among them
Carla flops down on a bench next to a tall black hooker
the black hooker
It's Nico's partner, Jackson, dolled up like a street- walker, playing her undercover role to the hilt
(to Nico) Why can't you sons-a-bitches ever treat someone with a little respect
(walking away) Take it easy, sister
ain't your goddamn sister
We ain't got the same mother, motherfucka
Carla fires one final parting salvo of obscenities, then sags back among the women
Carla starts to cry
Jackson comforts her; Carla responds, lets herself be comforted
: 66
-   - Jackson, back in her normal daytime wear, exits a building
She gets into Nico's car
67
- Jackson checks her makeup in the rearview mirror
Nico sits behind the wheel
The two are on some kind of stakeout
The lawyer's name is Abandano
He's on the third floor
got a look at him
couldn't get how he's connected, but according to Carla, he's a lousy lay
Maybe we can bust him for that

That's our stud
Nico and Jackson leave their car and follow him on foot

They go in
Jackson remains out on the street, while Nico follows the couple in
70 Jackson has been waiting, sipping some coffee
Nico emerges from the bank, signaling to his partner to follow him
Abandano and the woman exit from the bank's revol- ving doors and immediately jump into a cab
Nico and Jackson look at each other and step in front of another cab
Nico opens the cab door, flips his badge open, then asks the occupant to leave
Jackson gets in the front seat next to the protesting cabbie
71
- Abandano and the woman are crossing the plaza as Nico and Jackson run up the block
Near the entrance to the Federal     * Building, a small but vocal group of protestors are            * gathered, carrying signs and chanting slogans
The frus-       * trated cabbie watches them in the background
72 Jackson and Nico watch Abandano and the woman pass the        * crowd of demonstrators and enter the building
Jackson acts * indifferent, almost frustrated; Nico keenly senses something

No customers, just busboys readying tables for the evening's business
We notice one of the        * busboys is the "pimp" Nico found with Lucy
* 74 The owner's table
Stacks of dining checks, a cashbox and calculator, full ashtrays, wine glasses , a heavyset, swarthy Venezuelan dressed in a tux with the collar open, glowers across the table at a mus- cular, scar-faced Latin busboy -- the kind who looks like he does more for his boss than clean up the tables
The busboy () is nervous, apologetic -- - Rev
4/17/87                          23
(pissed off) --  brought you in for your muscles, Nardo, not your mouth
(scared) 'm sorry, boss
Your English is getting good
You're showing it off
Showing it off on the street -- keep quiet
never talk no more -- Salvano glowers at Nardo like he's about to punch him
Instead he reaches over, playfully chokes the busboy -- then releases him, as if all is forgiven
Make yourself useful
(indicates empty wine bottle on table) Get downstairs, bring me one of these
(as Nardo stands, starts for back hallway) Then get back to work
75
- Nardo enters at the top of the stairs, radiating relief
He trots down into the empty basement, toward a floor-to- ceiling wine rack
(to himself) thought  was dead, man
(whistles with relief) thought  was fucking dead
He crosses to the wine rack
It's dark, hard to see
He searches for the bottle
Suddenly: a  sound behind him
Nardo turns --   , a wiry, pock-faced Latino, stands in the shadows (it is clear he has been waiting there, hiding) -- holding a small silencer automatic
You were right, cabron

4/17/87                           24
One  between the eyes and Nardo  backward into the  , eyes wide with shock and bewilderment
Chi Chi  him ; Nardo drops like a stone
Coolly, professionally, Chi Chi pumps  more  into the prone busboy's head
Chi Chi ejects the clip into his palm, unscrews the silencer, holsters the gun
Salvano appears at the top of the stairs
Two busboys are behind him
One of them is the young pimp
The busboys hurry        * down, the pimp -- scared shitless but playing it macho-cool
* Salvano comes down the stairs
Chi Chi stands over his work
(to busboys) Clean up this mess
* Who knows who else is talking --                       * * He was a young fool
* 76 Salvano and Chi Chi emerge from the basement steps and walk toward their booth
We're crazy waiting for this bullshit 'shipment
' Let me waste the other fucker now
Salvano puts a hand on Chi Chi's shoulder
Be patient
This will be done the way it was planned
: 77
- Rusting cyclone fences surround   a mud-lot repair yard in a dingy industrial section
Young    Lation and black workers finish up for the night; through   the dirty, security-barred office window we can see Chi Chi   talking on the phone
The lawyer, Abandano, is also there
78
-    - Nico finishes connecting a small transmitter which has been hastily wired to the entering phone line
79

Nico wears earphones, a small tape recorder on the seat beside him
Jackson does not look happy

Toscani, you're going to have me doing time
Lighten up, Jax
No one's bringing this into court
Except against us
don't give a shit how we do it
just wanna get there
Jackson gives Nico a dirty look, but stifles her protest
thought you said you were gonna protect me
Cover my butt
Be my guardian angel -- Nico hears something through the earphones
Gestures for silence -- 80 Chi Chi listens with increased intensity to something on the phone
He starts writing it down -- 81 In unmarked car
He's writing it down too

On the sidewalks we glimpse theatergoers, fashionable white couples out on the town

The place is packed with fashionable people of all races

Nico and Jackson pass easily as a hip "uptown" couple
pretty Latin approaches them
Two for dinner
Two for drinks
They elbow up to the packed bar, standing
Nico squints toward the rear dining room
90   '  - Looking past numerous patrons, we see Chi Chi whisper something to a waiter and take a seat at a rear table (the same "owner's table" where Salvano sat before
) The waiter hurries off into a back hallway
91      - Jackson moves to the salsa beat
approaches
Gimme something stiff

Who doesn't
Nico's eyes never leave Chi Chi
92 From the back hallway Salvano emerges -- in his tux, looking prosperous
He sits down beside Chi Chi and Abandano
waitress brings two drinks
After a few words, Chi Chi removes the scrap of paper from his pocket, hands it to Salvano
(
) You'll have your engine block next Tuesday, boss
93 As the Barmaid brings their drinks
Jackson sees her peaceful week to retirement flying out the window
Why couldn't it be a week from Tuesday

Luke casts an impatient glance across the street to a lot with four parked meat trucks
We glimpse two "truckers" keeping low in the shadows of one cab
Down the block a seemingly empty pickup truck is parked in an alley
This ain't a bust -- it's a convention
Don't you like company, Luke
(sarcastic) We got all the scouts here -- Drug Enforcement Agency, the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms -- - (
) Keep this channel clear, Toscani
We realize Nico, Jackson and Lukich are wired, with mikes out of sight under their coats
Nico glances to the pick- up, near to which three men can be spotted in the alley
Apparently one of them is the walkie-talkie voice

It starts slowly this way

Everyone get their heads outa their ass
The meat truck men duck down out of sight, the pickup men back into the shadows
Nico and Lukich keep raking cow guts
The van passes slowly, checking out the area

And so  quit the police department

On a cross street

Behind it is an ancient station wagon
Both vehicles take a different cross street, but both heading behind the packing plant

Salvano couldn't answer if he wanted to
The other cops look at Nico with awe
Lukich whips the van door open, yanks a tarp off the cargo

Nico climbs into the van, rips the plastic sheeting off, grabs the wood slats of the shipping frame, tears them off

He's fuming

It's on the others' faces too
As all of you   are well aware, possession of   these explosives is a federal   offense and under jurisdiction   of the

What's the story on your partner, Jackson
Did he learn this style or was he born with a brick up his ass
Jackson checks Halloran out
He's black too and, despite herself, there's a certain rapport
He has ethics
Unlike certain others on this case
Halloran watches the illegal bugs and tapes come out of Nico's drawer
His 'ethics' are gonna cost him his badge and his gun
This "white" talk gives Jackson a pain
She slips into her jive mode
You don't wanna catch him without no gun

This must be your partner in crime

(with a wink to Nico) What a partner
Dolores Jackson (smiling, but impatient) Nico, we gotta go -- No, please -- (more serious now) It's good you stopped by

Please

Jackson keeps glancing back out the alley to see Salvano's car slowly driving by

The dark corridors resemble an underground bunker
Old trophies and furniture are stored along the walls
The two cops and the priest walk
Another priest emerges from a door, nods, passes

It looks like a break-in has taken place

(to Nico) This is Father Tomassino
How do you do
Nico shakes the young priest's hand
There is a moment between them as Nico meets Tomassino's eyes, liking what he sees
The refugees are relieved, however, when Father Genarro, Nico and Jackson take their leave
155   , continue down the hall
didn't know this church was a sanctuary, Father
Yes
But, perhaps not such a safe one
How long have they been here
Too long
At least the kids can go to our school
Who did it, Father

Father Genarro
have you to thank for getting my son back into church
It's amazing what shame can accomplish
Father Genarro smiles and continues on toward the pulpit

4/29/87                           42
She cynically smiles at Nico
Nico sees the woman in black pass toward the exit of the church
163    - It is the same woman Nico and Jackson were following with Abandano, the lawyer
164    - The woman has left it in front of the votive candles directly before the priest's pulpit
165    - His head spins from the shopping bag to the doorway -- 166   '  - The woman is hastily sneaking out
167 Instantly he pushes his family to the floor, covering them with his body
168    -  - erupts between the priest and his   congregation
Fragments of plaster, wood, and marble   come blasting past Nico and his family
Churchgoers in the   first rows are blown off their feet by the shock wave of   the blast
Pews overturn, smoke everywhere -- 169 is shrieking hysterically
Stone and plaster dust rain down on them from the ceiling
170 is in total pandemonium
Screams, cries, panic -- 171 has been blown to oblivion
Where Father Genarro had been standing is now nothing but smoke and rubble
172 Prone, covering Sara and the baby, groping frantically         * to protect his mother as well

We're okay
Nico checks them and his mother swiftly

Nico rises alone from this scene
(forcefully) Help each other move outside
Be calm
175
- From a doorway and a shattered window smoke pours forth
We hear  from inside
176 Nico on his feet, plainly the leader in this moment of terror
Worshippers, shattered and bleeding, pour past him toward the door
Nico grabs a stout-looking church- goer
Call 911
Tell 'em to send everything they got

Nico starts for the altar where the damage is worst
177

We see Nico's family -- they're all right

He hands the child over to two older women, races back into the church

He desperately tries to maintain the priest's life

Doctors and nurses have the scene more of less under control, but there's still plenty of pain and misery

doctor and several nurses are pulling the plugs on the terribly mutilated body of Father Genarro
nun is crying; a fellow priest is blessing the Father

Nico talks to her, aside

Everyone
Right
Then find those sanctuary people, the ones we saw in the church basement -- As Jackson makes notes
Find out where they're from, why anyone would want to harm them
Jackson flips her notepad shut, ready to go

4/29/87                        45
Sara wakes and picks up Julian
Mama knows Father Genarro     * has died
She begins sobbing softly
Other members of the congregation are in the hallway, mourning
Nico, with his family, takes several steps toward the exit
Suddenly, Nico stops
He sees Agent Neeley entering (the  man who    * ordered him off the case) accompanied by Lieutenant Strozah   * and two uniformed officers
Sara
go down to the car; 'll                    * be with you in a minute

Neeley nods
Nico leads him off the corridor, through a       * fire exit door -- 185 The door closes behind them
Nico and the  man are alone on the stairway landing
* (impatient) What the hell is it, Toscani
Without warning, Nico grabs Neeley by both lapels, slams      * him furiously into the wall
You
That's what the hell it is
* Get your goddam hands off me
Neeley tries to shake free; Nico won't let him
* You let Salvano walk

It's in federal holding now
Besides, why would he blow up a church

Two days ago
Him and one of his apes were in that church -- and they weren't taking communion

Now  want some goddamn answers
* You tailed him
After  ordered you off
Where is he
Where's Salvano

Not babysit him
Neeley brushes Nico's fingermarks off his lapels
* * You think you're rough stuff, Toscani -- martial arts hero, chop suey crap
Well 'll tell you something: you're not bullet- proof
You're not even a good cop
(composes himself; reclaims his dignity) You sneak around, playing your street dick games
But all you come up with is conjecture, wild coincidence and bullshit

Jackson       * talks with neighborhood people, asking questions

'  - Nico in the alley, grilling several tough guys we saw be- fore when he raided this bar
The answers are all zero; Nico's disgusted, worn out, frustrated
He starts out the alley -- At the edge of the street, a battered van pulls in
jacketed   leans against it, an unlit ciga- rette in his mouth
As Nico approaches, turning toward his car -- (polite, casual) 'Cuse me, sir
Can  bum a light
Nico slows, eyeing the   guy dubiously
As he reaches to his jacket -- The side   door of the van flashes open 38 is leveled straight   at Nico's head
Instantly three other Latino hoods leap   to the sidewalk
(machete under jacket) Don't even think about it, motherfucker
Machete Man (First Latino) snatches Nico's gun from its shoulder holster
Two hoods shove Nico back into the alley
Nico checks out his assailants quickly
Four of them
Machete, ,  ,
( ) You come to our streets
fuck with our people
Now our people gonna fuck with you
The five advance on Nico
We ain't gonna shoot you, man
We gonna beat you to death
You gonna learn what it means to 'get down
' 191 )   Nico is  trapped
The hoods advancing
Nico has a moment  of stillness, as if all senses are clicking out of  normal gear and into some hyper-combat readi- ness
Then: 49
)   Gun and Machete Man are side by side
As Machete Man starts to move, Nico spins in beside him, seizes his wrist, twists it violently, wrenching the machete away, keeping Machete Man between him and Gun Man so Gun Man can't shoot
In a flash, Nico swings the machete, slicing over the top of Machete Man, half-severing the wrist of Gun Man
Gun Man falls, clutching his wrist in agony; the gun skitters away beneath a chain link fence, out of reach
Nico flips Machete Man (who has Nico's gun in his pocket) sending him crash- ing, half-unconscious
)   Instantly, Pipe Man aims a home run shot at Nico's head
Nico uses the machete, matches the angle of the oncoming blow, slides under and, in the same arc, blocks the blow and turns it into a strike, slashing Pipe Man's tendons behind the knee
Pipe Man goes down on one knee, writhing, hamstrung, crying out in pain
)   Now Ball Bat attacks
Nico intercepts the blow, flips Bat Man ass over teakettle, sending him sail- ing -- feet first -- through the side window of the van
Bat Man   the , hung up with just his head and shoulders dangling free
)   Nico is spread out, feet wide, in a crouch
Crowbar Man sees his chance
He is the fiercest of the four, and the savviest fighter
He throws three consecu- tive vicious blows at Nico's head; Nico drops to one knee, dodges the blows, then intercepts the third, machete in hand, matches the arc of interception and whips the blade up -- straight into the crotch of Crowbar Man
Crowbar Man can't believe it
He re- mains frozen a moment, staring at Nico, then down at his own groin
)   Machete Man, the first to be flipped, struggles des- perately to regain his senses
He tries to get Nico's gun from his own pocket, but Nico bats it a- way
Machete Man scrambles to his feet, in terror, bolts
)   Nico snatches his gun from the sidewalk, glances to Bat Man who is still half-dangling from the van window
Nico gives Bat Man one parting punch to the head, then tears off after Machete Man -- 192
- Shrieks from passersby as Machete Man hurtles past, straight into the street
car nearly hits him, he vaults its hood
Here comes Nico, in hot pursuit
He too leaps the car, whose owner is staring, cursing -- 193 An all-out foot face
50
Machete Man is a speedster; he hurdles a row of trash cans
, on a stoop, whistle as he passes
Fly, baby
194 tears after this human cannonball
Amazingly, he's gaining -- 195
- Machete Man highballs off the sidewalk, straight into a Mom and Pop groceria
Customers scatter in shock as the hood blasts past them, out the back door
Here comes Nico
Patrons curse in Spanish as he barrels past -- 196
- Machete Man bolts from the bodega into a small patio with tables and chairs
He leaps the fence into the next yard, which belongs to a funeral home
He hurdles the headstone inventory, clambers up the fence on the far side -- 197 pursuing along the same route
198 claws his way to the top of the fence and onto a frame- work of two-by-fours which form an arbor-like canopy a- bove the third back yard
Plastic sheeting is tacked between the beams
Machete Man glances back at Nico, starts out -- tightrope-style -- across the two-by-fours
Nico reaches the fence behind the hood, starts also onto the two-by-fours
We hear   from below as the rickety structure starts to wobble precariously
Machete Man reaches the far side
fire escape is ad- jacent; he grabs for it, starts up
Nico catches him by the ankle
The two crash together back onto the two-by- fours, which give way, sending them plunging into -- 199       - Four young Oriental women, potting plants, react with terror as the two bodies  through
Machete Man scrambles away from Nico but is trapped in the corner next to the rear shop door
The flower girls can't move either; Nico and the hood are too near the door
The girls retreat to the far corner, squealing in fright
(to Nico, in terror) No, hermano
Please -- 51
Nico starts menacingly toward the hood, breathing hard from the chase
Who put up the money
What money
Nico grabs him by the hair
You didn't come after me for a piece of ass
(twists the youth's neck) Who paid you
told ya
No one
Nico slams him with a fierce shot to the ribs
The hood doubles over, gasping
The flower girls shriek even louder
Nico turns to the girls with a ferocious glare
(shouting) Shut up
The girls instantly go silent in terror
Nico turns back to Machete Man, spins him violently face-down, jacking the punk's right arm straight out behind him
We see that Nico can break his elbow with one blow
Give it to me
Nico raises his fist to strike
Jimmy Constanza
Nico shoves the hood into the ground, tearing the hood's wallet from his trouser pocket
Nico rips the wallet a- part, seizes the kid's identification and holds it up
He grabs the punk by the hair with his free hand
Machete Man is staring up in terror, wondering what this means
If you're lying to me, 'll come and kill you right in your own fucking kitchen
Nico dumps him on the ground and walks away
Instantly Machete Man changes his tune

But if it's drugs--Senate, it's got to be heavy
You got a weapon
Lukich knows he doesn't
He glances up and down the street, makes sure no one's watching -- then cracks the driver's door of his car
There's a bulge in the map pocket
Nico  pulls out a Sig Saur

( ) - the faces of the sanctuary refugees
They are faces that have known fear and tragedy
The kind of faces we see on newsreels after villages have been burned and family members murdered
The refugees have been moved from church basement to a back room in the day care center
Nico kneels, facing them
Jackson in the background
nun ( ) and a priest (whom we saw in Genarro's hospital room) watch over the people
Nico is frustrated; he can't crack the refugees' fear
(to nun) Sister
you know me
Tell them there's no need for fear

There is rubble all over the yard, Nicola
(        , ,   '
) (to refugees) was there
in the church
They tried to kill my family, too
Several of the refugees look like they want to speak, but they are terrified
know there was a man here, from an American senator's office
Who was he going to speak to
The refugees become increasingly anxious
(to one woman) Was it you, senora
(to a man) Was it you
More silence
Glances among the people
Finally: The priest
The others shrink
The Woman glances to them
Who
(gently) Father Genarro
The other one
Nico looks to the American priest standing there
No
The young one
From Costa Rica
Sister Bonifacia sighs
Father Tomassino
Jackson has her pad out, taking notes
Bonifacia knows too much has already been revealed; she must speak
62
He came alone
two weeks ago
He had papers
Papers to give to the senator
Nico tries to contain his excitement; not scare anyone by losing his calm
But the bomb
The bomb was planted to destroy the pulpit
Father Tomassino was going to give the Mass that day
(shaken) Father Genarro talked him out of it
The refugees' faces confirm this
(understands) It was Father Tomassino they were trying to kill
Bonifacia starts softly to cry
Nico puts his hand on her shoulder, comforting her
Where is Tomassino
Where is he now
The nun shakes her head
Nico looks to the refugees
They don't know, either
He run, mister
He go -- He gestures: "who knows where
" If you know where he is, you've got to tell me
want to help him
can help him
The refugees lower their eyes
Bonifacia continues her soft weeping
Nico glances to Jackson; her look says "Enough, let's leave these poor people alone
" Nico stands, touches Bonifacia one more time on the shoulder -- 218

Well, 'm not done
Nico admires his partner's guts, but he's worried
'm not a rookie, Toscani
Now, go home
Get your family out of here
Nico agrees
The pair starts to split

Urgency fear, exhaustion
He's deep in thought -- 220

An old lady pulls a shopping cart       * while a crossing guard takes some kids across the street

The men are cool, professional

On the ground, alongside the car, spent like hailstones

The last shells spring free, , blue smoke fills the air
The leader waves two men forward to check their kill
At that instant: 233 springs to his feet behind the men, the Sig Saur

Be my guest
The man lets the magazine clatter to the street
The others raise their hands
It takes all Nico's strength to keep from wasting all four of them on the spot
His gaze swings wildly around the intersection
He spots a corner grocery store
phone inside

Move it

The men are scared shitless
They put their hands in back of their heads; trot jelly-legged -- 234

Adrenaline makes his hand shake; the dials spin wrong -- One of the men sees Nico's dilemma
To hit 911, Nico has to take his eye momentarily off his captives
As Nico turns again to the dial --  free-standing sales display hurtles toward him, crashing into his gun hand
One of the men has lunged into the display; now he dives atop Nico a second later
The whole human pile crashes, thundering into a glass freezer
Somehow Nico gets to his feet
One of the men grabs Nico's gun; Nico swings one of the freezer doors -- Wham
-- smack into the man's face
The ; the man drops like a rock
Now it's three against one -- prime odds for Nico
He wades into his attackers

They killed the wrong priest
Lukich doesn't understand
There was a second priest

He was the one they meant to kill
Nico starts to remove a large piece of ducting from the basement heater
And you know where to find him
No

Jackson moves to join him
* You're our backup
If we come out running, then you can shoot
Nico's eyes meet his partner's
It's plain he'll break her leg if he has to, to keep her safe by the car
Jackson accepts this reluctantly

- Nico and Lukich exit the vehicle
Nico indicates an adjacent building; he and Lukich start for it
298 Father Tomassino is beginning to come under the influence of Zagon's chemicals
In spite of this the priest's spirit to resist is astounding
Speak to me, Father -- who did you tell
know what you are
know what beasts you are
299
- Nico and Lukich emerge from the roof door, guns drawn
The roof is empty
Antennas, skylights, clotheslines
The pair creep soundlessly onto the next roof
They cross toward the roof door like infantrymen, moving one at a time from cover to cover, covering each other
They reach the door that leads down into the building
Nico checks the far side of the enclosure, nods to Lukich
Lukich cracks the roof door open -- 300      - Nico and Lukich creep down the stairs from the roof
Nico opens the door leading to the top (third) floor
301 The drugs have taken hold
The priest's brain is an open memory bank for Zagon to probe
want to know who you told
(barely coherent) told them
you make the ninos

castrating their fathers -- raping
mutilating their mothers And

Quickly Lukich checks the stairs leading down
Nico crosses silently past the first apartment door, checks the far end of the hallway
Nico comes back toward the apartment door
Lukich approaches from the opposite side
They take up positions flanking the door, guns drawn
The from inside
304 Salvano and Chi Chi look on, revulsed
Whatever is happening to Father Tomassino is enough to make even cruel men ill
(
) -- Tell me the truth, Father -- The priest's eyes roll grotesquely; he convulses, sweat beading on his forehead
He looks like a man in the agonies of some narcotic hell
(close to priest) -- Can we kill him
If you told anyone, about our plans to kill the senator, we cannot do it
Nadie

* 305 we hear another    outside
Nico kicks the apartment door in
He and Lukich burst in, guns clutched two-handed
306 The first goon reacts, raises his pistol
Lukich  him
Nico  the second goon, just as Chi Chi aims his sawed- off pistol-grip shotgun at Nico
Nico has a split second to dive behind a heavy upholstered chair
Chi Chi's - blows the chair into powder
Almost instan- taneously Nico sees the priest -- just as Zagon slashes the priest's throat
Salvano  Lukich point blank, in the shoulder, sending Lukich's gun sailing
Nico, , grabs Lukich, dives out the door with him -- 307 Zagon and Salvano   from the apartment full-tilt

Nico shoves Lukich toward the stairwell -- Go

Nico is slamming a fresh clip in, Lukich is stumbling away toward the stairwell
Salvano and Chi Chi appear in the apartment doorway
Chi Chi levels his fierce "hogleg" at Nico's head
At that instant --  broadside of  slam into the wall around Chi Chi
It's Jackson -- on the stairs
Chi Chi is hit, but spins,
His shotgun blast catches Jackson square in the chest, blowing her back like a doll, down the stairwell, out of sight
Nico reacts with agony,     * twists on the floor,  Chi Chi in the face
Nico pulls the trigger as fast as he can, sending a  of  through the doorway, through the walls
Salvano clutches his hench- man, using his dead body as a shield; Nico's  blow Chi Chi apart
Zagon  back, hits Nico in the side by the ribs
Nico tries to fire back; he's empty
Now
Nico bolts for the stairwell to the roof, clawing for a new clip as he goes
Salvano and Zagon burst into the hallway, at Nico
308    - along the tracks adjacent to the building
309
- Nico highballs from the stairwell as the tarpaper roof erupts all around him with  from the floor below
He dives sideways, rolling to avoid the fire -- He recovers his footing in time to see Salvano and Zagon burst onto the roof from the stairwell
Nico's  miss them; they separate, taking cover behind two walls at the roof's margins
Nico is trapped -- in the open
310 pop back out, aiming at Nico -- 311 leaps off the roof

315      - crawls to the space between cars, lowers himself down
He clings to the swaying chains

Several affluent people look at him oddly, he ignores them, keeps going -- He makes his way up the street, weakening, to a tasteful brown- stone
Nico climbs the steps in pain -- : 320
'  -  - Nico over the sink, shirt off,   -- applying a makeshift bandage to his bloody ribs
We see Jackson's make- up stuff along the counter, feminine robes hanging on the door, law books around a reading stand
Nico is in real pain, exhausted, weakening -- 321      - Nico at Jackson's desk, its surface spread with the notes and papers she got from Senator Harrison's aide's place
We glimpse them: photos of Central American atrocities, dead bodies, etc
He tries to study them, quickly, but his attention shifts -- Nico glances around the apartment: more law books, Jackson's degree on the wall, her rowing machine on the floor, several framed photos beside him on her desk
Nico turns several toward him

(to Jackson's photo) -- Had to be a hero
another fucking hero
'm sorry Jax
He reaches for a small calendar, looks at it

" Nico circles another date, "Senator delivers foreign policy position paper/Committee for Democratic Policy fund raiser

gurney is wheeled down the corridor
Lukich, a shoulder bandaged, walks beside the gurney, holding the hand of Jackson

Nico makes no response
Instead, he lifts Julian, nuzzles him tenderly
Ever notice how clean babies smell
Like nothing in the world has touched them yet
Sara glances to Rosa
Rosa knows what she wants
Dis- creetly Rosa rises, exits
Sara and Nico are alone
If you won't go to him,  will

There's nowhere they can't find us
You don't know what the hell you're talking about

Nico is in agony
You know  can't go to him
Sara takes both his hands in hers
Do you know why  love you
Do you know what it is about you that 've always loved

It's what you have inside
You don't live the way other people live

An old man with a cancer
The two are like an old and a young lion, appraising each other -- using all five senses and more
don't have much time, Uncle
So must speak plainly

Then: - Rev

(this is very painful for him) -- For as long as 've been old enough to think, 've hated you and hated everything you stood for
Larusso takes this in without a flicker
was so sure that you and  were on opposite sides of the fence
and that you and your people were destroying this country -- Nico pauses, glances away across the grounds
-- The most painful realization of my life was that the people  worked for and you are not far apart
(meets Larusso's eyes) -- And there's not much difference between what you are and what  was
Larusso studies Nico a long moment
Then takes Nico's elbow
* 347                                                            * 348 continue across the grounds

knew what you would    ask
and  had every intention    of refusing you
He glances to Nico
But it is a form of wisdom to know when to cease relying only upon yourself
He keeps walking
You know, of course, that this Senator Harrison will never live to make his speech tomorrow

He quickly scribbles a few lines
Memorize this address
He holds the paper for Nico to see
Have you got it in your mind
Nico nods
Larusso tears the paper into tiny shreds
* 349

The guards stand by, waiting
Thank you, Mr
Carlucci
trust you will give my love to my niece, Rosa

When she releases him, we can't hear what she says, but it seems like, "Be careful, please be careful

Fox hands his ticket to the cashier, motions Nico to the side, away from the guests, still keeping his distance -- should Nico try to make a move
tried to warn you, old buddy
knew you had wiretaps
and  knew you wouldn't let 'em go
Only  was too dumb to crack it
was so busy trying to figure a code, didn't even recognize Zagon's voice
It's all crystal clear to Nico now
So we kill our own senators now
Why not
The Romans did
Cadillac pulls up; the valet hops out, two particularly florid, well-fed guests get in, tipping the valet
(to Fox, watching the guests) Are we the Romans
We're an empire too
Fox doesn't like the look Nico gives him
Would you rather spoon borscht and quote Lenin

You 'consult
' You 'assist
' You send checks to your family
Zagon won't touch you, you'll be on the team -- Fuck you
In five years you're out, with a fat Swiss account and a -15 pension
Nico stares at his old friend with contempt
He sees the gun under Fox's coat, but he's too tired and too disgusted to care -- You know, Fox, right now in Israel they're trying some 80-year-old camp guard for war crimes
And all around our country there are guys on Death Row for killing one person, two people
And probably they all deserve it -- He takes a step toward Fox
Fox's hand tightens on his gun
(emotion rising) -- but you and  know a couple guys personally who are responsible for the murder of at least what
60,000 non- military personnel
(ticks off the beats) Viet
Lao
Thai
Cambodian
Librarians, teachers, doctors
women, children
and that's just a sliver of it
Fox tries to maintain a hard face
But his own guilty conscience is working -- (presses closer) We've wiped out entire fucking countries
And not one agent -- (moves gun into Nico's view) Stop right there

Well

What a team we have here

Fox looks shaky, unnerved: Nico's words have hit too close to home
Now Nico backs away a step, ready for anything
One of Zagon's agents holds their car's rear door open
* Thanks for the help, Fox

Have you two been sharing fond memories
Reminiscing about the good old days
Zagon waves Nico and Fox toward his car

In the same instant, Salvano pulls his own trigger

45 to Nico, who snatches it from the ground just as a  of around him
Nico dives headlong behind a concrete column, which is instantly chewed to shreds by Zagon  his -10 on full automatic second agent hurries forward to outflank Nico
Nico pops from behind the column,  the agent broadside behind the ear, blowing the whole side of his head off
Guests and valets are shrieking in terror, hitting the deck in clusters, clawing and scrambling over each other for safety
(to first agent, advancing) Move
Nico springs from cover, , trying to bolt down the garage ramp, toward the lower levels
His path puts the first agent directly in Zagon's line of fire
Zagon doesn't hesitate; he   on Nico, cutting down his own man -- Salvano has gotten to his feet, wounded, but still handling his gun
He  joins Zagon, rushing forward -- 373 valet rounds a corner, unsuspecting, bringing up a car
Nico is on him like a cat, tearing the poor boy from behind the wheel, leaping in -- - Rev

The Guards drop
Zagon turns to -- 387    - on his feet, charging straight at Zagon
Nico grabs him, slams Zagon with incredible force into a concrete column
Zagon's gun goes flying, but miraculously he spins away
Nico dives for him, gets his neck in a grip that is certain to snap it in half a second
But -- 388   ' appears in the torturer's hand
It slashes Nico, right a- cross his already wounded ribs
Nico cries in agony -- 389 scampers free
Nico gets to his feet, bleeding
Nico is between Zagon and Zagon's machine gun on the ground
Zagon bolts for his car
Nico dives for the gun --                      * 390                                                                  * Zagon floors it into a  360,  up the exit ramp, out of Nico's line of fire -- 391 leaps   into the other, half-destroyed car
Its two front tires   are flat, windshield blown out,
Nico   does the only thing he can do: puts the pedal to the metal   in reverse,  across the ramp divider, takes off after   Zagon in reverse -- 392     - '                                              * Another car is coming down
Zagon sideswipes it into a wall, keeps going -- 393     - ' Rear   smoke,    on their rims

Zagon looks around wildly, then floors the   accelerator
Zagon's car bucks straight up the      * pedestrian   steps, onto the plaza
Strollers scream and scatter as   it fishtails wildly, careening toward the           * huge stone   fountain -- 397   ' Follows, pouring smoke, in reverse
Nico cuts Zagon off, into Zagon's car broadside, sending it skittering        * sideways into the fountain retaining wall -- 398 leaps free, sprints toward the hotel alley
Nico takes off after him on foot -- 399
-    - Zagon races down the darkest of alleys, rounds a corner -- 400 hurtles after him, gaining
Nico whips around the alley corner, straight into: 401 waiting beside a plain grey  remote van
Nico skitters         * to a stop as a shotgun, an -16 and two pistols cover him
Shotgun Agent raises his weapon to fire -- No

Nico, his wrists tied, is dragged into the basement of the hotel
Zagon follows

- Sweating, windowless concrete
Overhead pipes
Churning machinery
As the   this airtight dungeon -- (

We got work to do

(
) All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
405 in a metal chair, wrists taped in front of him
One agent stands behind him, clasping a thin cable noose wrapped tight around Nico's throat
Shotgun agent holds his weapon on him, its twin muzzles inches from Nico's skull
406 finishes washing his hands in an industrial-type sink
He is cleaned up, wearing a fresh shirt, his hair combed
When he dries his hands, he looks like a surgeon preparing to operate
We've got an hour before the honorable senator
(hands towel to pistol agent) You've got to learn to take time, smell the roses
Zagon turns to Nico
How are you gonna do him, Zagon
In a motorcade
Or passing through a hotel kitchen
The Noose agent jerks his cable tight, making Nico gag and choke
Zagon motions to slacken off
He stops at a small table before Nico -- unrolls a well-worn felt pouch
Zagon watches Nico's reaction as the tools of the inter- rogator's trade come into view -- drug vials, syringes, scalpels, surgical tools
've used these little beauties many times to extract information -- (lifts a needle to the light) -- This'll be the first time 've ever used them
just for fun
Zagon sets the syringe down, slips on a heavy, weighted glove
(to agents) Take his arms
Pistol agent and Bad Dude move in, one on each side,         * seizing Nico's forearms
Shotgun agent holds his weapon tight to Nico's head
106
Zagon punches Nico square in the face, so hard the chair reels backward, spinning out from under Nico -- Hold him up
Pistol agent and Bad Dude lift Nico
Zagon slams him again
Again
Nico's cheekbone is broken; blood drains from his nose
Zagon aims a two-handed blow; backhands Nico, crushing the other side of his face
Zagon backs off, chest heaving
Pistol agent and Bad Dude plop Nico back in the chair, gagging, choked by the noose
Nico looks like the Viet prisoner -- the one we saw in the opening sequence
Like the prisoner, Nico takes his beating -- still conscious, still meeting Zagon's eyes with defiance
This is where you came in, Toscani
Only, now it's where you're gonna check out
He takes off his glove, grabs the syringe
Pistol agent and Bad Dude clamp Nico's right arm down tight
Zagon injects Nico
407 reacts instantly to the hypo -- cursing, sputtering under the choking noose
He twists wildly trying to free him- self, but the agents' powerful arms hold him
That's it
Fight it, cherry
Fight it, so it speeds faster on its way -- Nico struggles more violently
Fight it
Till the vessels burst in your brain
Till the arteries rupture in your heart -- Slowly, the struggle goes out of Nico
His muscles go limp; he slumps -- drooling, babbling incoherently
That's my boy
That's what  was waiting for -- Zagon produces his famous knife
He motions Pistol agent and Bad Dude to release Nico's arms
Noose agent slackens his grip on the choke cable
Zagon moves in closer, gloating, cooing -- 107
fool learns from his own mistakes
But a wise man learns from the mistakes of others -- (moves closer, blade in hand) You should have killed me when you had the chance, Toscani -- The blade moves to Nico's throat
Suddenly: Nico springs to life (catching Noose man by surprise and jerking the cable from his grip) -- grabbing Zagon with his taped hands by the throat, lifting him bodily, slamming him ferociously into the wall
Zagon drops to the floor, half-conscious
Nico spins instantly to find: the Shot- gun agent right behind him, raising his weapon to Nico's face, about to pull the trigger
Nico sidesteps, grabbing the man's wrist
The   , missing Nico by inches, blasting a huge chunk out of the concrete wall
The Noose agent draws his weapon from his shoulder holster
Nico snaps the Shotgun agent's wrist, flipping him through the air, simultaneously grabbing the weapon, spinning behind the Noose agent, then using the shotgun barrel like a club to smash the back of his head in
Another swing wipes out Pistol agent
Bad Dude, now with a clear shot, aims his -16
Nico blows him away with a double-barreled
In a flash, Nico has spun to Zagon's surgical tool table, lifted a rzor-sharp scalpel and slashed the tape, freeing his hands
He yanks the choke cable off his neck -- 408    - On his feet again
He reaches swiftly to the floor, snatches up his famous knife
Nico confronts him -- face battered, bloody -- shaking, battling internal spasms
Can you feel the chemicals, cherry
You can't fight 'em much longer -- Long enough to finish you
Sweating, half-spitting, Zagon slashes at Nico like an animal -- Nico traps the knife, and enters, smashes Zagon in the face with one lightning blow
We see Zagon's nose and face completely cave in
Nico comes under Zagon's elbow, the arm that still holds the knife clamping it in a vise-like grip and bending it backwards, slowly, against the joint -- which now starts to rip in half
Zagon is screaming and cursing, writhing in agony -- The drugs have hit Nico full force now
He's weakening, his eyes are starting to roll
Zagon tries one last surge of strength to save himself; it almost seems he'll wriggle free when: the elbow   in half with a sicken- ing sound

4/29/87                             108
As the joint hangs, dangling grotesquely, Nico reaches up around Zagon's neck, still holding the dangling limb with one arm
He begins to now do to Zagon's neck what he did to his arm
We hear a terminal
Zagon's body crumples to the floor
Nico, in delirium, staggers toward the door -- 409
-   - woman at a pay phone
She turns, drops the receiver in shock as -- 410 bursts, delirious, from the stairwell door
411      - commotion as Lukich, Agent Neeley and Jackson, arm in a       * sling, race in from their car
412      -  - weaves wildly forward
He drops to his knees
Guests react in astonishment and horror
412A is the first to spot Nico
She runs up to him as he collapses
412B looks at Jackson
413                                                     * reach Nico and Jackson

Behind them we see a banner, announcing Senator Harrison's address
From the ballroom we hear  and
fiery address is being finished inside
The senator is now leaving
415     - Total confusion
Guests staring everywhere
From a side office, a man with a medical bag comes running
The senator sees the group around Nico

Newsmen are trying to gain access to the house, held back by several cops and some of Nico's more strapping relatives

The press surrounds it as Lukich, Neeley, Lieutenant Strozah and           * Jackson, her arm in a sling, disembark from the car
417A pulls up
Neeley walks over and opens the door as a court        * stenographer, carrying her transcription machine case, steps out -- followed by a federal judge,   and 418 shove mikes and cameras at the senator and the judge, shouting questions
Lukich, Neeley and Strozah clear a path for them

Sara, Jackson, and Rosa beside him

scandal to Congress

You are making it possible for a sliver of truth to finally come out
He holds out his hand
Nico takes it
The senator gestures to Judge Alspauch
And this is Clayton Alspaugh of the fifth circuit court

The Judge nods to his stenographer, who swiftly sets up her equipment, takes a seat
Rosa makes a face at Branca, who rises, clearing a seat for the Judge
