Episode From the by George Lucas Revised Fourth Draft January 15, 1976 long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away
vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title
War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls into infinity
It is a period of civil war
Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire
During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet
Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy
The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness
tiny silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers from the back of the ship, races through space
It is pursed by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer
Hundreds of deadly laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate
- An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2- D2) and See-Threepio (-3PO) struggle to make their way through the shaking, bouncing passageway
Both robots are old and battered
Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod
His face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye
Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of human proportions
He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic surface of an Art Deco design
Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way
Did you hear that
They've shut down the main reactor
We'll be destroyed for sure
This is madness
Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in the main passageway
They aim their weapons toward the door
We're doomed
The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that only another robot could understand
There'll be no escape for the Princess this time
Artoo continues making beeping sounds
Tension mounts as loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship
What's that
The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade Runner
The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the underside dock of the giant Imperial starship
The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons
Suddenly a tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make their way into the smoke-filled corridor
In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with laserfire
The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns creating huge explosions
Stormtroopers scatter and duck behind storage lockers
Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered arms and faces
An explosion hits near the robots
should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister
Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages around the two hapless robots
-   - death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon
The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations who looks much younger than his eighteen years
His shaggy hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable lad with a prize-winning smile
light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves
He is aided by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms
The little robot appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions
bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt
He stands transfixed for a few moments studying the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet above the ground on a magnetic-field)
He motions for the tiny robot to follow him
Hurry up
Come with me
What are you waiting for
Get in gear
The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and smoke begins to pour out of every joint
Luke throws his arms up in disgust
Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum madly
- The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his way into the blinding light of the main passageway
This is Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor
His face is obscured by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the Imperial stormtroopers
Everyone instinctively backs away from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through the Rebel troops
Several of the Rebel troops break and run in a frenzied panic
woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome
Artoo makes beeping sounds
Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered
Artoo is nowhere in sight
The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel soldiers can be heard in the distance
Artoo
Artoo-Detoo, where are you
familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke- filled alcove
beautiful young girl (about sixteen years old) stands in front of Artoo
Surreal and out of place, dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little robot joins his companion
At last
Where have you been
Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance
They're heading in this direction
What are we going to do
We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what
Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the subhallway
Threepio chases after him
Wait a minute, where are you going
Artoo responds with electronic beeps
- The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies of his foes
He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord
The Death Star plans are not in the main computer
Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles in vain
Where are those transmissions you intercepted
Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat
What have you done with those plans
We intercepted no transmissions
Aaah
This is a consular ship
Were on a diplomatic mission
If this is a consular ship
were is the Ambassador
The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp
Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to his troops
Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador
want her alive
The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways
- The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the stormtroopers search through the ship
She is Princess Leia Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate
The fear in her eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder
One of the troopers spots her
There she is
Set for stun
Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with her laser pistol
She starts to run but is felled by a paralyzing ray
The troopers inspect her inert body
She'll be all right
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner
- Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod
He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light begins to flash
The stubby astro-robot works his way into the cramped four-man pod
Hey, you're not permitted in there
It's restricted
You'll be deactivated for sure
Artoo beeps something to him
Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease
Now come out before somebody sees you
Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding the mission he is about to perform
Secret mission
What plans
What are you talking about
'm not getting in there
Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps and twangs angrily
new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris through the narrow subhallway
Flames lick at Threepio and, after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky robot jumps into the lifepod
'm going to regret this
On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified robots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft
There goes another one
Hold your fire
There are no life forms
It must have been short- circuited
Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship
Stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy
That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here
Artoo beeps an assuring response
Are you sure this things safe
-   -   - Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white buildings
Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty empty street of the tiny settlement
An old woman runs to get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist at Luke as he flies past
've told you kids to slow down
- Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been asleep in his lap
They grumbled as he races through the office, yelling wildly
Did  hear a young noise blast through here
It was just wormie on another rampage
Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly, handsome boy a few years older than the rest
His flashy city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics of the farm boys
robot repairs some equipment in the background
Shape it up you guys
Biggs
Luke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great joy and emotion
They give each other a great bear hug
didn't know you were back
When did you get in
Just now
wanted to surprise you, hot shot
thought you'd be here
certainly didn't expect you to be out working
(he laughs) The Academy didn't change you much
but you're back so soon
Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission
Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony
Of course  got it
Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week
First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service
(he salutes) just came to say good-bye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons
Everyone laughs
The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of it
almost forgot
There's a battle going on
Right here in our system
Come and look
Not again
Forget it
-  -  -   - The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun
Camie and The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes
Luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens
There they are
Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain to see something with the naked eye
Through the binoculars Biggs sees two small silver specks
That's no battle, hot shot
they're just sitting there
Probably a freighter-tanker refueling
But there was a lot of firing earlier
Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the building in the process
Luke grabs them
Hey, easy with those
Don't worry about it, Wormie
The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs his shoulders in resignation
keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here
doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system
Believe me Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing
Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why
The group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about Luke's ineptitude
- Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad of armored stormtroopers
Her hands are bound and she is brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly marching troops
They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader emerges from the shadows
The sinister Dark Lord stares hard at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move
Lord Vader,  should have known
Only you could be so bold
The Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic
Don't play games with me, Your Highness
You weren't on any mercy mission this time
You passed directly through a restricted system
Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies
want to know what happened to the plans they sent you
don't know what you're talking about
'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan
You're a part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor
Take her away
Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering hole blasted in the side of the ship
An Imperial Commander turns to Vader
Holding her is dangerous
If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate
have traced the Rebel spies to her
Now she is my only link to find their secret base
She'll die before she tells you anything
Leave that to me
Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed
Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander
They stop and snap to attention
Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship
And no transmissions were made
An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard
Vader turns to the Commander
She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod
Send a detachment down to retrieve them
See to it personally, Commander
There'll be no one to stop us this time
Yes, sir
The Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of the planet Tatooine
- Jundland, or "No Man's Land", where the rugged desert mesas meet the foreboding dune sea
The two helpless astro-droids kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily work their way across the desert wasteland
The lifepod in the distance rests half buried in the sand
How did  get into this mess
really don't know how
We seem to be made to suffer
It's our lot in life
Artoo answers with beeping sounds
've got to rest before  fall apart
My joints are almost frozen
Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds
What a desolate place this is
Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas
Threepio stops and yells at him
Where are you going
stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small robot
Well, 'm not going that way
It's much too rocky
This way is much easier
Artoo counters with a long whistle
What makes you think there are settlements over there
Artoo continues to make beeping sounds
Don't get technical with me
Artoo continues to make beeping sounds
What mission
What are you talking about
've had just about enough of you
Go that way
You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile
Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the direction of the vast dune sea
And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it
Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound
He turns and trudges off in the direction of the towering mesas
No more adventures
'm not going that way
Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant mountains
- Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a dune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless miles
He looks back in the direction of the now distant rock mesas
That malfunctioning little twerp
This is all his fault
He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better
In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand from his joints
His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving towards him
Wait, what's that
transport
'm saved
The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the approaching transport
Over here
Help
Please, help
-   -   - Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew
Fixer and the others can be heard working inside
(Very animated) so  cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail
was so close  thought was going to fry my instruments
As it was  busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad
Uncle Owen was pretty upset
He grounded me for the rest of the season
You should have been there
it was fantastic
You ought to take it easy Luke
You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous
Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall
Look who's talking
Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle
You've gotten soft in the city
've missed you kid
Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs
It's been so
quiet
Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke
Luke,  didn't come back just to say good-bye
shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one  can trust
and if  don't come back, want somebody to know
Luke's eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty
What are you talking about
made some friends at the Academy
(he whispers) when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the Alliance
Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless
Join the Rebellion
Are you kidding
How
Quiet down will ya
You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater
'm sorry
'm quiet
(he whispers) Listen how quiet  am
You can barely hear me
Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues
My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact
You're crazy
You could wander around forever trying to find them
know it's a long shot, but if don't find them 'll do what  can on my own
It's what we always talked about
Luke, 'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service
The Rebellion is spreading and  want to be on the right side -- the side  believe in
And 'm stuck here
thought you were going to the Academy next term
You'll get your chance to get off this rock
Not likely
had to cancel my application
There has been a lot of unrest among the Sandpeople since you left
they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead
Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sandpeople with one blaster
know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off
He needs me for just one more season can't leave him now
feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important
What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire
You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems
it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire
It couldn't happen here
You said it yourself
The Empire won't bother with this rock
Things always change
wish  was going
Are you going to be around long
No, 'm leaving in the morning
Then  guess  won't see you
Maybe someday
'll keep a lookout
Well, 'll be at the Academy next season
after that who knows won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure
Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend 've got
So long, Luke
Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the power station
-   - The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures fill the air
Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he goes
He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for a moment
Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way
In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall and a small dark figure darts into the shadows
little further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the narrow path
The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow
He manages one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his back
His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then off again
Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller than Artoo
They holster strange and complex weapons as they cautiously approach the robot
They wear grubby cloaks and their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be seen
They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down the trail
-   -  - The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank- like vehicle the size of a four-story house
They weld a small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot is sucked into the giant machine
The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport
- It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler
Artoo switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles around the scrap heap
The narrow beam swings across rusty metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and maimed astro-robots
He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end of the chamber
- Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling
In the middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various shapes and sizes
Some are engaged in electronic conversation, while others simply mill about
voice of recognition calls out from the gloom
Artoo-Detoo
It's you
It's you
battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him
-   -  - The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain ridge
-  - Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half- buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine
trooper yells to an officer some distance away
Someone was in the pod
The tracks go off in this direction
second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand and gives it to the first trooper
Look, sir -- droids
- The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune
Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped prison chamber
Artoo appears to be shut off
Wake up
Wake up
Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men
Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights pop on as he begins beeping
At the far end of the long chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding white light
a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the odd assortment of robots
We're doomed
Jawa starts moving toward them
Do you think they'll melt us down
Artoo responds, making beeping sounds
Don't shoot
Don't shoot
Will this never end
-  -   - The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small adobe block house
The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow
The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils should be
Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, a large burly man in his mid-fifties
His reddish eyes are sunken in a dust-covered face
As the farmer carefully inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker
One of the vile little Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales pitch in a queer, unintelligible language
voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the homestead
Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru standing in the main courtyard
Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce
It looks like we don't have much of a choice but 'll remind him
Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment for sale with the Jawa leader
have no need for a protocol droid
(quickly) Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why 've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that
What  really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators
Vaporators
Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter
very similar to your vaporators
You could say
Do you speak Bocce
Of course  can, sir
It's like a second language for me
'm as fluent in Bocce
All right shut up
(turning to Jawa) 'll take this one
Shutting up, sir
Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you
want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner
But  was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters
You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done
Now come on, get to it
All right, come on
And the red one, come on
Well, come on, Red, let's go
As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep and starts after his old friend Threepio
He is restrained by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box
Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa
Luke and the two robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly
Uncle Owen
Yeah
This R2 unit has a bad motivator
Look
(to the head Jawa) Hey, what're you trying to push on us
The Jawa goes into a loud spiel
Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract attention
He lets out with a low whistle
Threepio taps Luke on the shoulder
(pointing to Artoo) Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition
real bargain
Uncle Owen
Yeah
What about that one
(to Jawa) What about that blue one
We'll take that one
With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged astro-droid for Artoo
Yeah, take it away
Uh, 'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir
He really is in first-class condition
've worked with him before
Here he comes
Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry
Okay, let's go
(to Artoo) Now, don't you forget this
Why should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity
-   - The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber
Threepio lowers himself into a large tub filled with warm oil
Near the battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery with a cord to his face
Thank the maker
This oil bath is going to feel so good
've got such a bad case of dust contamination, can barely move
Artoo beeps a muffled reply
Luke seems to be lost in thought as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage
Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he slams a wrench across the workbench
It just isn't fair
Oh, Biggs is right
'm never gonna get out of here
Is there anything  might do to help
Luke glances at the battered robot
bit of his anger drains and a tiny smile creeps across his face
Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock
don't think so, sir
'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things
Not on this planet, anyways
As a matter of fact, 'm not even sure which planet 'm on
Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from
see, sir
Uh, you can call me Luke
see, sir Luke
(laughing) Just Luke
And  am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo
Hello
Artoo beeps in response
Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome pick
Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping oil from his bronze body
You got a lot of carbon scoring here
It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action
With all we've been through, sometimes 'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all
You know of the Rebellion against the Empire
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir
Have you been in many battles
Several,  think
Actually, there's not much to tell
'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories
Well, not at making them interesting, anyways
Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's neck joint
He uses a larger pick
Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good
Were you on a cruiser or
The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling head over heels
He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three- dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being projected from the face of little Artoo
The image is a rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly lit garage
Luke's mouth hangs open in awe
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi
You're my only hope
What's this
Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to translate
Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over
What is what
He asked you a question
(pointing to Leia) What is that
Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice the hologram
He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to translate
Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi
You're my only hope
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi
You're my only hope
Oh, he says it's nothing, sir
Merely a malfunction
Old data
Pay it no mind
Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl
Who is she
She's beautiful
'm afraid 'm not quite sure, sir
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi
think she was a passenger on our last voyage
person of some importance, sir --  believe
Our captain was attached to
Is there more to this recording
Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic squeaks and a whistle
Behave yourself, Artoo
You're going to get us in trouble
It's all right, you can trust him
He's our new master
Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio
He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts
And it's a private message for him
Quite frankly, sir  don't know what he's talking about
Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric
Obi-Wan Kenobi
wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi
beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about
Well,  don't know anyone named Obi- Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea
He's kind of a strange old hermit
Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few moments
wonder who she is
It sounds like she's in trouble
'd better play back the whole thing
Artoo beeps something to Threepio
He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system
He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording
Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't really heard what Threepio has been saying
'm
Oh, yeah, well,  guess you're too small to run away on me if take this off
Okay
Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off Artoo's side
There you go
The princess immediately disappears
Well, wait a minute
Where'd she go
Bring her back
Play back the entire message
Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in embarrassment
What message
The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards
women's voice calls out from another room
Luke
Luke
Come to dinner
Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning robot
All right, 'll be right there, Aunt Beru
'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter
Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and hurries out of the room
Well, see what you can do with him
'll be right back
(to Artoo) Just you reconsider playing that message for him
Artoo beeps in response
No,  don't think he likes you at all
Artoo beeps
No,  don't like you either
- Luke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well- used kitchen
She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls of food and starts for the dining area
Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red grain
You know,  think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen
What makes you think that
Well,  stumbled across a recording while  was cleaning him
He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi
Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but manages to control himself
thought he might have meant old Ben
Do you know what he's talking about
Well,  wonder if he's related to Ben
Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger
That old man's just a crazy old wizard
Tomorrow  want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed
That'll be the end of it
It belongs to us now
But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him
He won't,  don't think he exists any more
He died about the same time as your father
He knew my father
told you to forget it
Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow
In the morning  want them on the south ridge working out those condensers
Yes, sir
think those new droids are going to work out fine
In fact, , uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season
And if these new droids do work out,  want to transmit my application to the Academy this year
Owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress it
You mean the next semester before harvest
Sure, there're more than enough droids
Harvest is when  need you the most
Only one more season
This year we'll make enough on the harvest so 'll be able to hire some more hands
And then you can go to the Academy next year
Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle
You must understand  need you here, Luke
But it's a whole 'nother year
Look, it's only one more season
Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands
Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left
Where are you going
It looks like 'm going nowhere have to finish cleaning those droids
Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room
Owen mechanically finishes his dinner
Owen, he can't stay here forever
Most of his friends have gone
It means so much to him
'll make it up to him next year promise
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen
He has too much of his father in him
That's what 'm afraid of
- The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a distant dune range
Luke stands watching them for a few moments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the homestead
- Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in sight
He takes a small control box from his utility belt similar to the one the Jawas were carrying
He activates the box, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a short yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship
What are you doing hiding there
Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in sight
It wasn't my fault, sir
Please don't deactivate me
told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission
Oh, no
Luke races out of the garage followed by Threepio
- Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro- robot
Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his electrobinoculars
That R2 unit has always been a problem
These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand
Even can't understand their logic at times
How could  be so stupid
He's nowhere in sight
Blast it
Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him
It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around
We'll have to wait until morning
Owen yells up from the homestead plaza
Luke, 'm shutting the power down for the night
All right, 'll be there in a few minutes
Boy, am  gonna get it
He takes one final look across the dim horizon
You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble
Oh, he excels at that, sir
- Morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of the open courtyard
The idyll is broken be the yelling of Uncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead
Luke
Luke
Luke
Where could he be loafing now
- The interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru prepares the morning breakfast
Owen enters in a huff
Have you seen Luke this morning
He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early
Uh
Did he take those two new droids with him
think so
Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay
-   - '  - The rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio pilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast wasteland
/
'  -   -  - Luke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something in the motor compartment
(yelling) How's that
Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the wind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut
Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but  don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far
We must have missed him
Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well
Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault
(brightening) Sure
He needs you
He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so
Deactivate
Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt
Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner
It looks like our droid
hit the accelerator
-   -   -  - From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen gliding across the desert floor
Suddenly in the foreground two weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa
One of the marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs the gun before it can be fired
The Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimes called, speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an animated argument
The second Tusken Raider seems to get in the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain
-   - The Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tied to a rock
The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large as elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails
The Tusken Raiders mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs and ride off down the rugged bluff
-   - The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon
Luke, with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands before little Artoo
Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going
The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses menacingly behind the little runaway
Master Luke here is your rightful owner
We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish
and don't talk to me about your mission, either
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here
Well, come on
It's getting late only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop
No, he's not going to try anything
Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic whistles and screams
What's wrong with him now
Oh my
sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast
Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south
Sandpeople
Or worst
Come on, let's have a look
Come on
-   -  - Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars
He spots the two riderless Banthas
Threepio struggles up behind the young adventurer
There are two Banthas down there but don't see any
wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right
can see one of them now
Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his electrobinoculars
Suddenly something huge moves in front of his field of view
Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them
Threepio is startled and backs away, right off the side if the cliff
He can be heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles down the side of the mountain
The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in the heart of the local settlers
But Luke manages to block the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces
The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced to the edge of a deep crevice
The sinister Raider stands over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible shrieking laugh
-   -  - Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in the rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the inert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the speeder
The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts and supplies in all directions
Suddenly they stop
Then everything is quiet for a few moments
great howling moan is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the Sandpeople fleeing in terror
Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and leans over Luke
His ancient leathery face, cracked and weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating eyes and a scraggly white beard
Ben Kenobi squints his eyes as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy
Artoo makes a slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him
Hello there
Come here my little friend
Don't be afraid
Artoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and begins to whistle and beep his concern
Ben puts his hand on Luke's forehead and he begins to come around
Don't worry, he'll be all right
What happened
Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day
You're fortunate you're still in one piece
Ben
Ben Kenobi
Boy, am  glad to see you
The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly
Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far
Oh, this little droid
think he's searching for his former master
've never seen such devotion in a droid before
there seems to be no stopping him
He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi
Is he a relative of yours
Do you know who he's talking about
Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard
Obi-Wan Kenobi
Obi-Wan
Now thats a name  haven't heard in a long time
a long time
think my uncle knew him
He said he was dead
Oh, he's not dead, not
not yet
You know him
Well of course, of course  know him
He's me
haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born
Then the droid does belong to you
Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid
Very interesting
He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs
think we better get indoors
The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers
Luke sits up and rubs his head
Artoo lets out a pathetic beep causing Luke to remember something
He looks around
Threepio
-   -   - Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps
Luke and Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half buried in the sand
One of his arms has broken off
Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally the mechanical man's systems turn on
Where am
must have taken a bad step
Can you stand
We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return
don't think  can make it
You go on, Master Luke
There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account
'm done for
Artoo makes a beeping sound
No, you're not
What kind of talk is that
Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet
Little Artoo watches from the top of the pit
Ben glances around suspiciously
Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the air
Quickly, son
they're on the move
' The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and security
Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, as old Ben sits thinking
No, my father didn't fight in the wars
He was a navigator on a spice freighter
That's what your uncle told you
He didn't hold with your father's ideals
Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved
You fought in the Clone Wars
Yes,  was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father
wish 'd known him
He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself
And he was a good friend
Which reminds me
Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around
As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously
Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the table
Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle with several electronic gadgets attached to it
have something here for you
Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it
He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did
Sir, if you'll not be needing me, 'll close down for awhile
Sure, go ahead
Ben hands Luke the saber
What is it
Your fathers lightsaber
This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight
Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster
Luke pushes a button on the handle
long beam shoots out about four feet and flickers there
The light plays across the ceiling
An elegant weapon for a more civilized time
For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic
Before the dark times, before the Empire
Luke hasn't really been listening
How did my father die
young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights
He betrayed and murdered your father
Now the Jedi are all but extinct
Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force
The Force
Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power
It's an energy field created by all living things
It surrounds us and penetrates us
It binds the galaxy together
Artoo makes beeping sounds
Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend
And where you come from
saw part of the message he was
Luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful young Rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face
seem to have found it
Luke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers before his eyes
General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars
Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire
regret that am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and 'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed
have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit
My father will know how to retrieve it
You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan
This is our most desperate hour
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope
There is a little static and the transmission is cut short
Old Ben leans back and scratches his head
He silently puffs on a tarnished chrome water pipe
Luke has stars in his eyes
You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan
(laughing) Alderaan
'm not going to Alderaan
've got to go home
It's late, 'm in for it as it is
need your help, Luke
She needs your help
'm getting too old for this sort of thing
can't get involved
've got work to do
It's not that  like the Empire
hate it
But there's nothing can do about it right now
It's such a long way from here
That's your uncle talking
(sighing) Oh, God, my uncle
How am  ever going to explain this
Learn about the Force, Luke
Look,  can take you as far as Anchorhead
You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going
You must do what you feel is right, of course
An Imperial Stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet-like battle station: the Death Star
- Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black conference table
Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around the room
Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general, is speaking
Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable
The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped
They're more dangerous than you realize
The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair
Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station
The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as
Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial outland regions, enters
He is followed by his powerful ally, The Sith Lord, Darth Vader
All of the generals stand and bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his place at the head of the table
The Dark Lord stands behind him
The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us
've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently
The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away
That's impossible
How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy
The regional governors now have direct control over territories
Fear will keep the local systems in line
Fear of this battle station
And what of the Rebellion
If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it
The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands
Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained
This station is now the ultimate power in the universe
suggest we use it
Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed
The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force
Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader
Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort
Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's spell
find your lack of faith disturbing
Enough of this
Vader, release him
As you wish
This bickering is pointless
Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational
We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke
- The speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas Sandcrawler
Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble and scattered bodies
It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right
Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks
It's just
never heard of them hitting anything this big before
Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks
They didn't
But we are meant to think they did
These tracks are side by side
Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers
These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio
And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople
Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise
Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas
Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are inspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together
If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to
And that would lead them home
Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for the speeder and jumps it
Wait, Luke
It's too dangerous
Luke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with the burning Sandcrawler
- Luke races across the wasteland in his battered Landspeeder
- The speeder roars up to the burning homestead
Luke jumps out and runs to the smoking holes that were once his home
Debris is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great battle has taken place
Uncle Owen
Aunt Beru
Uncle Owen
Luke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and uncle
Suddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains
He is stunned, and cannot speak
Hate replaces fear and a new resolve comes over him
Imperial  fighter races toward the Death Star
- Two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow several Imperial guards to enter
Princess Leia's face is filled with defiance, which slowly gives way to fear as a giant black torture robot enters, followed by Darth Vader
And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base
The torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it approaches Princess Leia and extends one of its mechanical arms bearing a large hypodermic needle
The door slides shut and the long cell block hallway appears peaceful
The muffled screams of the Rebel princess are barely heard
- There is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of the Sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the dead
Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to him
There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there
You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire
want to come with you to Alderaan
There's nothing here for me now want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father
- The Landspeeder with Luke, Artoo, Threepio, and Ben in it zooms across the desert
The speeder stops on a bluff overlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley
It is a haphazard array of low, grey, concrete structures and semi-domes harsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor
Luke adjusts his goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where Ben is standing
Mos Eisley Spaceport
You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy
We must be cautious
Ben looks over at Luke, who gives the old Jedi a determined smile
-   - The speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combat- hardend stormtroopers who look over the two robots
Trooper questions Luke
How long have you had these droids
About three or four seasons
They're for sale if you want them
Let me see your identification
Luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his  while Ben speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice
You don't need to see his identification
We don't need to see his identification
These are not the droids your looking for
These are not the droids we're looking for
He can go about his business
You can go about your business
(to Luke) Move along
Move along
Move along
-   - The speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse cantina on the outskirts of the spaceport
Various strange forms of transport, including several unusual beasts of burden, are parked outside the bar
Jawa runs up and begins to fondle the speeder
can't abide these Jawas
Disgusting creatures
As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa away
Go on, go on
can't understand how we got by those troopers
thought we were dead
The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded
You will find it a powerful ally
Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan
Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here
Only watch your step
This place can be a little rough
'm ready for anything
Come along, Artoo
-   - The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina
The murky, moldy den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar
At first the sight is horrifying
One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over drinks
Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group of repulsive but human scum
huge, rough-looking Bartender stops Luke and the robots
We don't serve their kind here
Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's drift
What
Your droids
They'll have to wait outside
We don't want them here
Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the Galactic pirates
He notices several of the gruesome creatures along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare
Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder
Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder
We don't want any trouble
heartily agree with you sir
Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the creatures at the bar go back to their drinks
Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage- looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with fierce baboon-like fangs
His large blue eyes dominate a fur- covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance
Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, and little else
He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a sight to behold
Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets out a horrifying laugh
Luke is more than a little bit disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between Ben and the giant Wookiee
Luke is terrified but tries not to show it
He quietly sips his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear or whatever
large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove
Negola dewaghi wooldugger
The hideous freak is obviously drunk
Luke tries to ignore the creature and turns back on his drink
short, grubby Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the belligerent monstrosity
He doesn't like you
'm sorry
don't like you either
The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young adventurer
Don't insult us
You just watch yourself
We're wanted men
have the death sentence in twelve systems
'll be careful than
You'll be dead
The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar moves away
Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy
His three adversaries ready their weapons
Old Ben moves in behind Luke
This little one isn't worth the effort
Come let me buy you something
powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid
With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben
The bartender panics
No blasters
No blaster
With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life and in a flash an arm lies on the floor
The rodent is cut in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, cut from chin to groin
Ben carefully and precisely turns off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt
Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, attempts to stand
The entire fight has lasted only a matter of seconds
The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is given a respectable amount of room at the bar
Luke, rubbing his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe
Ben points the the Wookiee
This is Chewbacca
He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs
-   - Threepio paces in front of the cantina as Artoo carries on an electronic conversation with another little red astro- droid
creature comes out of the cantina and approaches two stormtroopers in the street
don't like the look of this
-   - Strange creatures play exotic big band music on odd-looking instruments as Luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and follows Ben and Chewbacca to a booth where Han Solo is sitting
Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years old
mercenary on a starship, he is simple, sentimental, and cocksure
Han Solo
'm captain of the Millennium Falcon
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system
Yes, indeed
If it's a fast ship
Fast ship
You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon
Should  have
It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs
Ben reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them with obvious misinformation
've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you
'm talking about the big Corellian ships now
She's fast enough for you, old man
What's the cargo
Only passengers
Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked
What is it
Some kind of local trouble
Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements
Well, that's the trick, isn't it
And it's going to cost you something extra
Ten thousand in advance
Ten thousand
We could almost buy our own ship for that
But who's going to fly it, kid
You
You bet  could
'm not such a bad pilot myself
We don't have to sit here and listen
We haven't that much with us
But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan
Seventeen, huh
Han ponders this for a few moments
Okay
You guys got yourself a ship
We'll leave as soon as you're ready
Docking bay Ninety-four
Ninety-four
Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork
Ben and Luke turn around to see four Imperial stormtroopers looking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some questions
The bartender points to the booth
All right, we'll check it out
The stormtroopers look over at the booth but Luke and Ben are gone
The bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement
Seventeen thousand
Those guys must really be desperate
This could really save my neck
Get back to the ship and get her ready
-   - You'll have to sell your speeder
That's okay
'm never coming back to this planet again
- As Han is about to leave, Greedo, a slimy green-faced alien with a short trunk-nose, pokes a gun in his side
The creature speaks in a foreign tongue translated into English subtitles
Going somewhere, Solo
Yes, Greedo
As a matter of fact, was just going to see your boss
Tell Jabba that 've got his money
Han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the gun on him
It's too late
You should have paid him when you had the chance
Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you
'm lucky found you first
Yeah, but this time  got the money
If you give it to me,  might forget found you
don't have it with me
Tell Jabba
Jabba's through with you
He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser
Even  get boarded sometimes
Do you think  had a choice
Han Solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table
You can tell that to Jabba
He may only take your ship
Over my dead body
That's the idea
've been looking forward to killing you for a long time
Yes, 'll bet you have
Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of light
Han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as the other patron look on in bemused amazement
Han gets up and starts out of the cantina, flipping the bartender some coins as he leaves
Sorry about the mess
Several  fighters approach the Death Star
- Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable
It will be some time before we can extract any information from her
An Imperial Officer interrupts the meeting
The final check-out is complete
All systems are operational
What course shall we set
Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion
What do you mean
think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station
(to soldier) Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan
With pleasure
-   - Four heavily-armed stormtroopers move menacingly along a narrow slum alleyway crowed with darkly clad creatures hawking exotic goods in the dingy little stalls
Men, monsters, and robots crouch in the waste-filled doorways, whispering and hiding from the hot winds
Lock the door, Artoo
One of the troopers checks a tightly locked door and moves on down the alleyway
The door slides open a crack and Threepio peeks out
Artoo is barely visible in the background
All right, check that side of the street
It's secure
Move on to the next door
The door opens, Threepio moves into the doorway
would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you
don't know what all the trouble is about, but 'm sure it must be your fault
Artoo makes beeping sounds
You watch your language
-   -  -  - Ben and Luke are standing in a sleazy used speeder lot, talking with a tall, grotesque, insect-like used speeder dealer
Strange exotic bodies and spindly-legged beasts pass by as the insect concludes the sale by giving Luke some coins
He says it's the best he can do
Since the -38 came out, they're just not in demand
It will be enough
Ben and Luke leave the speeder lot and walk down the dusty alleyway past a small robot herding a bunch of anteater-like creatures
Luke turns and gives one last forlorn look at his faithful speeder as he rounds a corner
darkly clad creature moves out of the shadows as they pass and watches them as they disappear down another alley
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well
94 - Jabba the Hut and a half-dozen grisly alien pirates and purple creatures stand in the middle of the docking bay
Jabba is the grossest of the slavering hulks and his scarred face is a grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer
He is a fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and a huge ugly mouth
Come on out, Solo
voice from directly behind the pirates startles them and they turn around to see Han Solo and the giant Wookiee, Chewbacca, standing behind them with no weapons in sight
've been waiting for you, Jabba
expected you would be
'm not the type to run
(fatherly-smooth) Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me
why haven't you paid me
And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that
after all we've been through together
You sent Greedo to blast me
(mock surprise) Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business
You're too valuable to fry
He was only relaying my concern at your delays
He wasn't going to blast you
think he thought he was
Next time don't send one of those twerps
If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself
Han, Han
If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice
you understand  just can't make an exception
Where would  be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship
It's not good business
You know, even  get boarded sometimes, Jabba
had no choice, but 've got a charter now and  can pay you back, plus a little extra just need some more time
(to his men) Put your blasters away
Han, my boy, 'm only doing this because you're the best and  need you
So, for an extra, say twenty percent 'll give you a little more time
but this is it
If you disappoint me again, 'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life
Jabba, 'll pay you because it's my pleasure
- Chewbacca waits restlessly at the entrance to Docking Bay 94
Ben, Luke, and the robots make their way up the street
Chewbacca jabbers excitedly and signals for them to hurry
The darkly clad creature has followed them from the speeder lot
He stops in a nearby doorway and speaks into a small transmitter
-   94 Chewbacca leads the group into a giant dirt pit that is Docking Bay 94
Resting in the middle of the huge hole is a large, round, beat-up, pieced-together hunk of junk that could only loosely be called a starship
What a piece of junk
The tall figure of Han Solo comes down the boarding ramp
She'll make point five beyond the speed of light
She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid
've added some special modifications myself
Luke scratches his head
It's obvious he isn't sure about all this
Chewbacca rushes up the ramp and urges the others to follow
We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here
The group rushes up the gang plank, passing a grinning Han Solo
Chewbacca settles into the pilot's chair and starts the mighty engines of the starship
-   94 Luke, Ben, Threepio, and Artoo move toward the Millennium Falcon passing Solo
Hello, sir
-   - Eight Imperial stormtroopers rush up to the darkly clad creature
Which way
The darkly clad creature points to the door of the docking bay
All right, men
Load your weapons
-   94] The troops hold their guns at the ready and charge down the docking bay entrance
Stop that ship
Han Solo looks up and sees the Imperial stormtroopers rushing into the docking bay
Several of the troopers fire at Han as he ducks into the spaceship
Blast 'em
Han draws his laser pistol and pops off a couple of shots which force the stormtroopers to dive for safety
The pirateship engines whine as Han hits the release button that slams the overhead entry shut
Chewie, get us out of here
The group straps in for take off
Oh, my
'd forgotten how much hate space travel
-   - The half-dozen stormtroopers at a check point hear the general alarm and look to the sky as the huge starship rises above the dingy slum dwellings and quickly disappears into the morning sky
- Han climbs into the pilot's chair next to Chewbacca, who chatters away as he points to something on the radar scope
- The Corellian pirateship zooms from Tatooine into space
- Han frantically types information into the ship's computer
Little Artoo appears momentarily at the cockpit doorway, makes a few beeping remarks, then scurries away
It looks like an Imperial cruiser
Our passengers must be hotter than thought
Try and hold them off
Angle the deflector shield while  make the calculations for the jump to light speed
- The Millennium Falcon pirateship races away from the yellow planet, Tatooine
It is followed by two huge Imperial stardestroyers
- Over the shoulders of Chewbacca and Han, we can see the galaxy spread before them
Luke and Ben make their way into the cramped cockpit where Han continues his calculation
Stay sharp
There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off
Why don't you outrun them
thought you said this thing was fast
Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace
Besides, know a few maneuvers
We'll lose them
- Imperial cruisers fire at the pirateship
- The ship shudders as an explosion flashes outside the window
Here's where the fun begins
How long before you can make the jump to light speed
It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer
The ship begins to rock violently as lasers hit it
Are you kidding
At the rate they're gaining
Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy
Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it
The ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red warning light begins to flash
What's that flashing
We're losing our deflector shield
Go strap yourself in, 'm going to make the jump to light speed
The galaxy brightens and they move faster, almost as if crashing a barrier
Stars become streaks as the pirateship makes the jump to hyperspace
The Millennium Falcon zooms into infinity in less than a second
Alderaan looms behind the Death Star battlestation
- Admiral Motti enters the quiet control room and bows before Governor Tarkin, who stands before the huge wall screen displaying a small green planet
We've entered the Alderaan system
Vader and two stormtroopers enter with Princess Leia
Her hands are bound
Governor Tarkin,  should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash
recognized your foul stench when  was brought on board
Charming to the last
You don't know how hard  found it signing the order to terminate your life
surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself
Princess Leia, before your execution would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational
No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers
Not after we demonstrate the power of this station
In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first
Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, have chosen to test this station's destructive power
on your home planet of Alderaan
No
Alderaan is peaceful
We have no weapons
You can't possibly
You would prefer another target military target
Then name the system
Tarkin waves menacingly toward Leia
grow tired of asking this
So it'll be the last time
Where is the Rebel base
Leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to Alderaan
(softly) Dantooine
Leia lowers her head
They're on Dantooine
There
You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable
(addressing Motti) Continue with the operation
You may fire when ready
What
You're far too trusting
Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration
But don't worry
We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough
No
- Commence primary ignition
button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever
Another lever is pulled
Vader reaches for still another lever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up huge beam of light emanates from within a cone-shaped area and converges into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan
The small green planet of Alderaan is blown into space dust
- Ben watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small "seeker" robot
Ben suddenly turns away and sits down
He falters, seems almost faint
Are you all right
What's wrong
felt a great disturbance in the Force
as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced
fear something terrible has happened
Ben rubs his forehead
He seems to drift into a trance
Then he fixes his gaze on Luke
You'd better get on with your exercises
Han Solo enters the room
Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs
told you 'd outrun 'em
Luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber
Don't everyone thank me at once
Threepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a game in which three-dimensional holographic figures move along a chess-type board
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours
Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table covered with small holographic monsters
Each side of the table has a small computer monitor embedded in it
Chewbacca seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur- covered arms over his head
Now be careful, Artoo
Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures to walk to the new square
sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot
Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and begins to argue with the huge Wookiee
He made a fair move
Screaming about it won't help you
(interrupting) Let him have it
It's not wise to upset a Wookiee
But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid
That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose
Wookiees are known to do that
see your point, sir
suggest a new strategy, Artoo
Let the Wookiee win
Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems frozen in place
humming lightsaber is held high over his head
Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements
Han watches with a bit of smugness
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him
You mean it controls your actions
Partially
But it also obeys your commands
Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a "seeker", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae, hovers slowly in a wide arc
The ball floats to one side of the youth then the other
Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face
Luke doesn't move and the ball backs off
It slowly moves behind the boy, then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood red laser beam as it attacks
It hits Luke in the leg causing him to tumble over
Han lets loose with a burst of laughter
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid
You don't believe in the Force, do you
Kid, 've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other
've seen a lot of strange stuff, but 've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny
Ben smiles quietly
It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense
suggest you try it again, Luke
Ben places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his eyes
This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct
(laughing) With the blast shield down,  can't even see
How am  supposed to fight
Your eyes can deceive you
Don't trust them
Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker into the air
The ball shoots straight up in the air, then drops like a rock
Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits Luke square on the seat of the pants
He lets out a painful yell and attempts to hit the seeker
Stretch out with your feelings
Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen
The seeker makes a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the bolt
The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original position
You see, you can do it
call it luck
In my experience, there's no such thing as luck
Look, going good against remotes is one thing
Going good against the living
That's something else
Solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the control panel
Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan
Han and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit
You know,  did feel something could almost see the remote
That's good
You have taken your first step into a larger world
- Imperial Officer Cass stands before Governor Tarkin and the evil Dark Lord Darth Vader
Yes
Our scout ships have reached Dantooine
They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time
They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems
She lied
She lied to us
told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion
Terminate her
immediately
The pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange surreal light show surrounds the ship
- Stand by, Chewie, here we go
Cut in the sublight engines
Han pulls back on a control lever
Outside the cockpit window stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then stop
Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently shake about
Asteroids begin to race toward them, battering the sides of the ship
What the
Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower
Some kind of asteroid collision
It's not on any of the charts
The Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool in the emergency
Luke makes his way into the bouncing cockpit
What's going on
Our position is correct, except
no, Alderaan
What do you mean
Where is it
Thats what 'm trying to tell you, kid
It ain't there
It's been totally blown away
What
How
Ben moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins to settle down
Destroyed
by the Empire
The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet
It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than 've
signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled alarm starts humming
There's another ship coming in
Maybe they know what happened
It's an Imperial fighter
Chewbacca barks his concern
huge explosion bursts outside the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently
tiny, finned Imperial  fighter races past the cockpit window
It followed us
No
It's a short range fighter
There aren't any bases around here
Where did it come from
The fighter races past the Corellian pirateship
- It sure is leaving in a big hurry
If they identify us, we're in big trouble
Not if  can help it
Chewie
jam it's transmissions
It'd be as well to let it go
It's too far out of range
Not for long
The pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the vastness of space after the Imperial  fighter
- The tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny fighter
In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter until it is obvious that the  ship is heading for it
Ben stands behind Chewbacca
fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own
It must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something
Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us
The  fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as they race toward camera and disappear over head
- The distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or planet
Look at him
He's headed for that small moon
think  can get him before he gets there
he's almost in range
The small moon begins to take on the appearance of a monstrous spherical battle station
That's no moon
It's a space station
It's too big to be a space station
have a very bad feeling about this
Yeah,  think your right
Full reverse
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power
The pirateship shudders and the  fighter accelerates away toward the gargantuan battle station
Why are we still moving towards it
We're caught in a tractor beam
It's pulling us in
But there's gotta be something you can do
There's nothin'  can do about it, kid
'm in full power
'm going to have to shut down
But they're not going to get me without a fight
Ben Kenobi puts a hand on his shoulder
You can't win
But there are alternatives to fighting
- As the battered pirate starship is towed closer to the awesome metal moon, the immense size of the massive battle station becomes staggering
Running along the equator of the gigantic sphere is a mile-high band of huge docking ports into which the helpless pirateship is dragged
- The helpless Millennium Falcon is pulled past a docking port control room and huge laser turret cannons
Clear Bay twenty-three-seven
We are opening the magnetic field
-   2037 The pirateship is pulled in through port doors of the Death Star, coming to rest in a huge hangar
Thirty stormtroopers stand at attention in a central assembly area
To you stations
(to another officer) Come with me
- Stormtroopers run to their posts
-  2037 line of stormtroopers march toward the pirateship in readiness to board it, while other troopers stand with weapons ready to fire
Close all outboard shields
Close all outboard shields
- Tarkin pushes a button and responds to the intercom buzz
Yes
(over intercom) We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system
It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley
They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess
She may yet be of some use to us
-   2037 Vader and a commander approach the troops as an Officer and several heavily armed troops exit the spacecraft
(over intercom) Unlock one-five-seven and nine
Release charges
(to Vader) There's no one on board, sir
According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff
It must be a decoy, sir
Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned
Did you find any droids
No, sir
If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned
Send a scanning crew on board want every part of this ship checked
Yes, sir
sense something
a presence haven't felt since
Vader turns quickly and exits the hangar
Get me a scanning crew in here on the double
want every part of this ship checked
- trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit
In a few moments all is quiet
The muffled sounds of a distant officer giving orders finally fade
Two floor panels suddenly pop up revealing Han Solo and Luke
Ben Kenobi sticks his head out of a third locker
Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments
use them for smuggling
never thought 'd be smuggling myself in them
This is ridiculous
Even if could take off, 'd never get past the tractor beam
Leave that to me
Damn fool
knew that you were going to say that
Who's the more foolish
the fool or the fool who follows him
Han shakes his head, muttering to himself
Chewbacca agrees
- The crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past the two stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp
The ship's all yours
If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately
All right, let's go
The crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound is followed by a voice calling to the guard below
' Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this
The stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of gunfire is heard
-   - In a very small command office near the entrance to the pirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices the guards are missing
He speaks into the comlink
-four-one-two
Why aren't you at your post
-four-one-two, do you copy
stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating his comlink is not working
The gantry officer shakes his head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an annoyed look
Take over
We've got a bad transmitter
'll see what  can do
As the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing the towering Chewbacca
The gantry officer, in a momentary state of shock, stumbles backward
With a bone- chilling howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow
The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper
Ben and the robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed as a stormtrooper
Luke quickly removes his helmet
You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here
Bring them on
prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around
We found the computer outlet, sir
Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of the city appears on the monitor
He begins to inspect it carefully
Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel
Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly
Plug in
He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network
Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information to the little robot
After a few moments, he beeps something
He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here
He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor
The computer monitor flashes readouts
The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave
Ben studies the data on the monitor readout
don't think you boys can help must go alone
Whatever you say
've done more that  bargained for on this trip already
want to go with you
Be patient, Luke
Stay and watch over the droids
But he can
They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan
Your destiny lies along a different path than mine
The Force will be with you
always
Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps out of the command office, then disappears down a long grey hallway
Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head in agreement
Boy you said it, Chewie
Han looks at Luke
Where did you dig up that old fossil
Ben is a great man
Yeah, great at getting us into trouble
didn't hear you give any ideas
Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up
Who do you think
Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak
Luke goes over to him
What is it
'm afraid 'm not quite sure, sir
He says " found her", and keeps repeating, "She's here
" Well, who
who has he found
Artoo whistles a frantic reply
Princess Leia
The princess
She's here
Princess
What's going on
Level five
Detention block  -twenty- three
'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated
Oh, no
We've got to do something
What are you talking about
The droid belongs to her
She's the one in the message
We've got to help her
Now, look, don't get any funny ideas
The old man wants us to wait right here
But he didn't know she was here
Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block
'm not going anywhere
They're going to execute her
Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured
Now all you want to do is stay
Marching into the detention area is not what  had in mind
But they're going to kill her
Better her than me
She's rich
Chewbacca growls
Rich
Yes
Rich, powerful
Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be
What
Well more wealth that you can imagine
don't know,  can imagine quite a bit
You'll get it
better
You will
All right, kid
But you'd better be right about this
Han looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt
All right
What's your plan
Uh
Threepio, hand me those binders there will you
Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs
Okay
Now, 'm going to put these on you
Chewie lets out a hideous growl
Okay
Han, you put these on
Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han
Don't worry, Chewie
think  know what he has in mind
The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as Han binds him with the electronic cuffs
Master Luke, sir
Pardon me for asking
but, ah
what should Artoo and  do if we're discovered here
Lock the door
And hope they don't have blasters
That isn't very reassuring
Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and start off into the giant Imperial Death Star
-   - Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive
Troops, bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio completely
Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious glance
Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters
can't see a thing in this helmet
bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away by Han
The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube
- Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main passageway
They pass several stormtroopers and a robot similar to Threepio but with an insect face
At the far end of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then disappears down a small hallway
His appearance is so fleeting that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion
No one in the hallway seems to notice him
-   - Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door slides open behind them
The giant Wookiee and his two guards enter the old grey security station
Guards and laser gates are everywhere
Han whispers to Luke under his breath
This is not going to work
Why didn't you say so before
did say so before
Elevator doors open
tall, grim looking Officer approaches the trio
Where are you taking this
thing
Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut up
Prisoner transfer from Block one-one- three-eight
wasn't notified
'll have to clear it
The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in the information
There are only three other troopers in the area
Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes
Han unfastens one of Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke
Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one of his ear-piercing howls
He grabs Han's laser rifle
Look out
He's loose
He's going to pull us all apart
Go get him
The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded
Luke and Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee
Their barrage of laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser gate controls, and the Imperial guards
The officer is the last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is about to push the alarm system
Han rushes to the comlink system, which is screeching questions about what is going on
He quickly checks the computer readout
We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in
Here it is
cell twenty-one-eight-seven
You go get her
'll hold them here
Luke races down one of the cell corridors
Han speaks into the buzzing comlink
(sounding official) Everything is under control
Situation normal
What happened
(getting nervous) Uh
had a slight weapons malfunction
But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now
We're fine
We're all fine here, now, thank you
How are you
We're sending a squad up
Uh, uh, negative
We had a reactor leak here now
Give us a few minutes to lock it down
Large leak
very dangerous
Who is this
What's your operating number
Han blasts the comlink and it explodes
Boring conversation anyway
(yelling down the hall) Luke
We're going to have company
- Luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door away with a laser pistol
When the smoke clears, Luke sees the dazzling young princess-senator
She had been sleeping and is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on her face
Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands staring at her with his mouth hanging open
(finally) Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper
Luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it
What
Oh
the uniform
'm Luke Skywalker
'm here to rescue you
You're who
'm here to rescue you
've got your R2 unit
'm here with Ben Kenobi
Ben Kenobi is here
Where is he
Come on
- Darth Vader paces the room as Governor Tarkin sits at the far end of the conference table
He is here
Obi-Wan Kenobi
What makes you think so
tremor in the Force
The last time felt it was in the presence of my old master
Surely he must be dead by now
Don't underestimate the power of the Force
The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe
You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion
There is a quiet buzz on the comlink
Yes
Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block  -twenty- three
The princess
Put all sections on alert
Obi-Wan is here
The Force is with him
If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape
Escape is not his plan
must face him alone
-   - An ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the elevator door
Chewie
Chewbacca responds with a growling noise
Get behind me
Get behind me
series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door through which several Imperial troops begin to emerge
Han and Chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke and flame
They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting up with Luke and Leia rushing toward them
Can't get out that way
Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route
(sarcastically) Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness
Luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as they continue to exchange fire with stormtroopers making their way down the corridor
See-Threepio
See-Threepio
(over comlink) Yes sir
We've been cut off
Are there any other ways out of the cell bay
What was that
didn't copy
-    - Threepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps and whistles a blue streak
Threepio yells into the small comlink transmitter
said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir
The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out; all other information on your level is restricted
Someone begins banging on the door
Open up in there
Oh, no
- Luke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as they continue to exchange fire with troops
Han and Chewbacca are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far and of the hallway
The laserfire is very intense, and smoke fills the narrow cell corridor
There isn't any other way out
can't hold them off forever
Now what
This is some rescue
When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out
(pointing to Luke) He's the brains, sweetheart
Luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders
Well,  didn't
The princess grabs Luke's gun and fires at a small grate in the wall next to Han, almost frying him
What the hell are you doing
Somebody has to save our skins
Into the garbage chute, wise guy
She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca look on in amazement
Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and says something
Get in there you big furry oaf don't care what you smell
Get in there and don't worry about it
Han gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the tiny opening
Luke and Han continue firing as they work their way toward the opening
Wonderful girl
Either 'm going to kill her or 'm beginning to like her
Get in there
Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness
Han fires off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover, then slides into the chute himself and is gone
- Han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck
Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit
He finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open
It won't budge
(sarcastically) Oh
The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea
What an incredible smell you've discovered
Let's get out of here
Get away from there
No
wait
Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch
The laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room
Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes almost on top of them
Leia climbs out of the garbage with a rather grim look on her face
Will you forget it
already tried it
It's magnetically sealed
Put that thing away
You're going to get us all killed
Absolutely, Your Worship
Look, had everything under control until you led us down here
You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us
It could be worse
loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the murky depths
Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins to back away
Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols drawn
The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls
It's worse
There's something alive in here
That's your imagination
Something just moves past my leg
Look
Did you see that
What
Help
Suddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage
Luke
Luke
Luke
Solo tries to get to Luke
Luke surfaces with a gasp of air and thrashing of limbs
membrane tentacle is wrapped around his throat
Luke
Leia extends a long pipe toward him
Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this
Blast it, will you
My gun's jammed
Where
Anywhere
Oh
Solo fires his gun downward
Luke is pulled back into the muck by the slimy tentacle
Luke
Luke
Suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and move in a couple of inches
Then everything is deathly quiet
Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca howls in the corner
With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke suddenly bobs to the surface
Grab him
Luke seems to be released by the thing
What happened
don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared
've got a very bad feeling about this
Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and edge toward the Rebels
The walls are moving
Don't just stand there
Try to brace it with something
They place poles and long metal beams between the closing walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant trashmasher rumbles on
The situation doesn't look too good
Wait a minute
Luke pulls out his comlink
Threepio
Come in Threepio
Threepio
Where could he be
-   - soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for See-Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand comlink, which is sitting on the deserted computer console
Artoo and Threepio are nowhere in sight
Suddenly there is a great explosion and the door of the control tower flies across the floor
Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber
Take over
(pointing to the dead officer) See to him
Look there
trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides open
See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside
Artoo follows his bronze companion out into the office
They're madmen
They're heading for the prison level
If you hurry, you might catch them
(to his troops) Follow me
You stand guard
The troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to watch over the command office
(to Artoo) Come on
The guard aims a blaster at them
Oh
All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here
If you don't mind, 'd like to take him down to maintenance
All right
The guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow, hurries out the door
- As the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and smaller
Chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his giant paws
Han is leaning back against the other wall
Garbage is snapping and popping
Luke is trying to reach Threepio
Threepio
Come in, Threepio
Threepio
Han and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole
Leia begins to sink into the trash
Get to the top
can't Where could he be
Threepio
Threepio, will you come in
-    - They aren't here
Something must have happened to them
See if they've been captured
Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall socket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from the tiny robot
Hurry
- The walls are only feet apart
Leia and Han are braced against the walls
The princess is frightened
They look at each other
Leia reaches out and takes Han's hand and she holds it tightly
She's terrified and suddenly groans as she feels the first crushing pressure against her body
One thing's for sure
We're all going to be a lot thinner
(to Leia) Get on top of it
'm trying
-    - (to Artoo) Thank goodness, they haven't found them
Where could they be
Artoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio
Use the comlink
Oh, my
forgot turned it off
- Meanwhile, Luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his head above the rising ooze
Luke's comlink begins to buzz and he rips it off his belt
-    - Muffled sounds of Luke's voice over the comlink can be heard, but not distinctly
Are you there, sir
- Threepio
-    - We've had some problems
(over comlink) Will you shut up and listen to me
Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you
Do you copy
- Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level
-    - (over comlink) Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level
(to Artoo) No
Shut them all down
Hurry
Threepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible screaming and hollering from Luke's comlink
Listen to them
They're dying, Artoo
Curse my metal body
wasn't fast enough
It's all my fault
My poor master
(over comlink) Threepio, we're all right
- The screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief
The walls have stopped moving
Han, Chewie and Leia embrace in the background
We're all right
You did great
Luke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch, looking for a number
Hey
hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number
where are we
-    - (over comlink) Three-two-six-eight-two-seven
-   - Ben enters a humming service trench that powers the huge tractor beam
The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep
The clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard
The old Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading to a control panel that connects two large cables
He carefully makes several adjustments in the computer terminal, and several lights on the board go from red to blue
- The group exits the garbage room into a dusty, unused hallway
Han and Luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster belts
If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here
Luke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster from Solo
Well, let's get moving
Chewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the garbage room, as he runs away and then stops howling
(to Chewie) Where are you going
The Dia Nogu bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a victim
Han aims his pistol
No, wait
They'll hear
Han fires at the doorway
The noise of the blast echoes relentlessly throughout the empty passageway
Luke simply shakes his head in disgust
(to Chewie) Come here, you big coward
Chewie shakes his head "no
" Chewie
Come here
Listen
don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as  tell you
Okay
Han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl
Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight
take orders from one person
Me
It's a wonder you're still alive
(looking at Chewie) Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way
Han watches her start away
He looks at Luke
No reward is worth this
They follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor
- Suddenly a door behind Ben slides open and a detachment of stormtroopers marches to the power trench
Ben instantly slips into the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few feet of him
Secure this area until the alert is canceled
Give me regular reports
All but two of the stormtroopers leave
Do you know what's going on
Maybe it's another drill
Ben moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers as they turn their backs to him
Ben gestures with his hand toward them, as the troops think they hear something in the other hallway
With the help of the Force, Ben deftly slips past the troopers and into the main hallway
What was that
Oh, it's nothing
Don't worry about it
- Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and stop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship
Troopers are milling about the ship
Luke takes out his pocket comlink
(looking at his ship) There she is
See-Threepio, do you copy
(voice) For the moment
Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship
We're right above you
Stand by
Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of the pirateship
Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and points out the window to the ship
You came in that thing
You're braver that  thought
Nice
Come on
Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the hallway
They round a corner and run right into twenty Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them
Both groups are taken by surprise and stop in their tracks
It's them
Blast them
Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges the troops, firing
His blaster knocks one of the stormtroopers into the air
Chewie follows his captain down the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor
(to Luke and Leia) Get back to the ship
Where are you going
Come back
Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear
He certainly has courage
What good will it do us if he gets himself killed
Come on
Luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck
Luke and Leia start off toward the starship hangar
- Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway
He is yelling and brandishing his laser pistol
The troops reach a dead end and are forced to turn and fight
Han stops a few feet from them and assumes a defensive position
The troops begin to raise their laser guns
Soon all ten troopers are moving into an attack position in front of the lone starpirate
Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops begin to advance
Solo jumps backward as they fire at him
- Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt to save his bold captain
Suddenly he hears the firing of laser guns and yelling
Around the corner shoots Han, pirate extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of furious stormtroopers
Chewbacca turns and starts running the other way also
- Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers
They quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an open hatchway
- Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity
The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, and Luke almost rushes into the abyss
He loses his balance off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of his arm and pulls him back
(gasping) think we took a wrong turn
Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby reminding them of the oncoming danger
Luke fires back at the advancing troops
Leia reaches over and hits a switch that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang
Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door
There's no lock
Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol
That oughta hold it for a while
Quick, we've got to get across
Find the control that extends the bridge
Oh,  think  just blasted it
Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making ominous drilling and pounding sounds
They're coming through
Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when laserfire hits the wall behind him
Luke aims his laser pistol at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across the abyss from them
They exchange fire
Two more troops appear on another overhang, also firing
trooper is hit, and grabs at his chest
Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft
Troopers move back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia
Here, hold this
Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt
It has a grappler hook on it
trooper appears on a bridge overhang and fires at Luke and Leia
As Luke works with the rope, Leia returns the laser volley
Another trooper appears and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well
Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet of more troops
Here they come
Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and he falls into the abyss
Luke tosses the rope across the gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes
He tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the princess in his arms
Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him quickly on the lips
Luke is very surprised
For luck
Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side
Just as Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at the escaping duo
Luke returns the fire before ducking into the tiny subhallway
- Ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway
He checks to make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the opposite direction
Darth Vader appears at the far end of the hallway and starts after the old Jedi
- Threepio looks around at the troops milling about the pirateship entry ramp
Where could they be
Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left and right, beeping a response
-  - Han and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several troopers hot on their trail
Close the blast doors
At the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in front of them
The young starpilot and his furry companion race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops before the doors slam shut
Open the blast doors
Open the blast doors
- Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar where the pirateship waits
Just before he reaches the hangar, Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not ten feet away
Vader lights his saber
Ben also ignites his and steps slowly forward
've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan
We meet again, at last
The circle is now complete
Ben Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive position
The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive stance
When  left you,  was but the learner; now  am the master
Only a master of evil, Darth
The two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right moment
Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain, as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him
He shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes
Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked by a lightning movement of The Sith
masterful slash stroke by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi
Another of the Jedi's blows is blocked, then countered
Ben moves around the Dark Lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar
The two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments with laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing sound
Your powers are weak, old man
You can't win, Darth
If you strike me down,  shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine
Their lightsabers continue to meet in combat
- Han Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back against the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the Imperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar
Didn't we just leave this party
Chewbacca growls a reply, as Luke and the princess join them
What kept you
We ran into some old friends
Is the ship all right
Seems okay, if we can get to it
Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission
- Vader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel
As they hit their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact
Troopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord of The Sith fight
Suddenly Luke spots the battle from his group's vantage point
Look
Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie look up and see Ben and Vader emerging from the hallways on the far side of the docking bay
- Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are in the center of the Death Star's Imperial docking bay
Come on, Artoo, we're going
Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who were guarding the starship rush past them heading towards Ben and The Sith Knight
He pulls on Artoo
- Solo, Chewie, Luke, and Leia tensely watch the duel
The troops rush toward the battling knights
Now's our chance
Go
They start for the Millennium Falcon
Ben sees the troops charging toward him and realizes that he is trapped
Vader takes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings his mighty lightsaber down on the old man
Ben manages to deflect the blow and swiftly turns around
The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts his sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene look on his face
Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half
Ben's cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it
Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the empty cloak
As the guards are distracted, the adventurers and the robots reach the starship
Luke sees Ben cut in two and starts for him
Aghast, he yells out
No
The stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him
The robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium Falcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns their fire
Solo joins in the laserfire
Vader looks up and advances toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down
(to Luke) Come on
Come on
Luke, its too late
Blast the door
Kid
Luke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it explodes
The door begins to slide shut
Three troopers charge forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close behind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the docking bay
stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his onrushing compatriots
Luke starts for the advancing troops, as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship
He fires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles to the floor
' Run, Luke
Run
Luke looks around to see where the voice came from
He turns toward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from the troopers and races into the ship
- Han pulls back on the controls and the ship begins to move
The dull thud of laser bolts bouncing off the outside of the ship as Chewie adjusts his controls
hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip
Okay, hit it
Chewbacca growls in agreement
The Millennium Falcon powers away from the Death Star docking bay, makes a spectacular turn and disappears into the vastness of space
- Luke, saddened by the loss of Obi-Wan Kenobi, stares off blankly as the robots look on
Leia puts a blanket around him protectively, and Luke turns and looks up at her
She sits down beside him
- Solo spots approaching enemy ships
(to Chewie) We're coming up on the sentry ships
Hold 'em off
Angle the deflector shields while  charge up the main guns
- Luke looks downward sadly, shaking his head back and forth, as the princess smiles comfortingly at him
can't believe he's gone
Artoo-Detoo beeps a reply
There wasn't anything you could have done
Han rushes into the hold area where Luke is sitting with the princess
(to Luke) Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet
-  - Solo climbs into his attack position in the topside gunport
- Luke gets up and moves out toward the gunports as Leia heads for the cockpit
-  - Luke climbs down the ladder into the gunport cockpit, settling into one of the two main laser cannons mounted in large rotating turrets on either side of the ship
- ' Han adjusts his headset as he sits before the controls of his laser cannon, then speaks into the attached microphone
(to Luke) You in, kid
Okay, stay sharp
-  - Chewbacca and Princess Leia search the heavens for attacking fighters
The Wookiee pulls back on the speed controls as the ship bounces slightly
- '  - Computer graphic readouts form on Solo's target screen, as Han reaches for controls
-  - Luke sits in readiness for the attack, his hand on the laser cannon's control button
-
Chewbacca spots the enemy ships and barks
(into intercom) Here they come
-  -  (  ) - The Imperial  fighters move towards the Millennium Falcon, one each veering off to the left and right of the pirateship
- The stars whip past behind the Imperial pilot as he adjusts his maneuvering joy stick
- The  fighter races past the Falcon, firing laser beams as it passes
- Threepio is seated in the hold area, next to Artoo-Detoo
The pirateship bounces and vibrates as the power goes out in the room and then comes back on
-  - fighter maneuvers in front of Han, who follows it and fires at it with the laser cannon
Luke does likewise, as the fighter streaks into view
The ship has suffered a minor hit, and bounces slightly
Two  fighters dive down toward the pirateship
- Luke fires at an unseen fighter
They're coming in too fast
-  / Pan with pirateship as two  fighters charge through the background
Laserbolts streak from all the craft
- The ship shudders as a laserbolt hits very close to the cockpit
The Wookiee chatters something to Leia
- Full shot of a  fighter as it moves fast through the frame, firing on the pirate starship
- The two  fighters fire a barrage of laserbeams at the pirateship
- laserbolt streaks into the side of the pirateship
The ship lurches violently, throwing poor Threepio into a cabinet fill of small computer chips
Oooh
-  - Leia watches the computer readout as Chewbacca manipulates the ship's controls
We've lost lateral controls
Don't worry, she'll hold together
An enemy laserbolt hits the pirateship's control panel, causing it to blow out in a shower of sparks
(to ship) You hear me, baby
Hold together
Artoo-Detoo advances toward the smoking sparking control panel, dousing the inferno by spraying it with fire retardant beeping all the while
- Luke swivels in his gun mount, following the  fighter with his laser cannon
- Solo aims his laser cannon at the enemy fighter
fighter streaks in front of the starship
- Leia watches the  fighter ship fly over
fighter heads right for the pirateship, then zooms overhead
- Luke follows the  fighter across his field of view, firing laserbeams from his cannon
fighter dives past the pirateship
- Luke fires at a  fighter
At his port, Han follows a fighter in his sights, releasing a blast of laserfire
He connects, and the fighter explodes into fiery dust
Han laughs victoriously
Two  fighters move toward and over the Millennium Falcon, unleashing a barrage of laserbolts at the ship
- Another  fighter moves in on the pirateship and Luke, smiling, fires the laser cannon at it, scoring a spectacular direct hit
Got him
got him
Han turns and gives Luke a victory wave which Luke gleefully returns
Great kid
Don't get cocky
Han turns back to his laser cannon
Two more  fighters cross in front of the pirateship
- While Chewbacca manipulates the controls, Leia turns, looking over her shoulder out the ports
There are still two more of them out there
fighter moves up over the pirateship, firing laserblasts at it
- Luke and Han look into their respective projected target screens
An Imperial fighter crosses Solo's port, and Han swivels in his chair, following it with blasts from his laser cannon
Another fighter crosses Luke's port, and he reacts in a like manner, the glow of his target screen lighting his face
The  fighter zooms toward the pirateship, firing destructive blasts at it
- Luke fires a laserblast at the approaching enemy fighter, and it bursts into a spectacular explosion
Luke's projected screen gives a readout of the hit
The pirateship bounces slightly as it is struck by the enemy fire
- The last of the attacking Imperial  fighters looms in, firing upon the Falcon
- Solo swivels behind his cannon, his aim describing the arc of the  fighter
The fighter comes closer, firing at the pirateship, but a well-aimed blast from Solo's laser cannon hits the attacker, which blows up in a small atomic shower of burning fragments
(laughing) That's it
We did it
The princess jumps up and gives Chewie a congratulatory hug
We did it
- Threepio lies on the floor of the ship, completely tangled in the smoking, sparking wires
Help
think 'm melting
(to Artoo) This is all your fault
Artoo turns his dome from side to side, beeping in response
- The victorious Millennium Falcon moves off majestically through space
- Darth Vader strides into the control room, where Tarkin is watching the huge view screen
sea of stars is before him
Are they away
They have just made the jump into hyperspace
You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship
'm taking an awful risk, Vader
This had better work
- Han, removes his gloves and smiling, is at the controls of the ship
Chewie moves into the aft section to check the damage
Leia is seated near Han
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh
You know, sometimes  even amaze myself
That doesn't sound too hard
Besides, they let us go
It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape
Easy
you call that easy
Their tracking us
Not this ship, sister
Frustrated, Leia shakes her head
At least the information in Artoo is still intact
What's so important
What's he carrying
The technical readouts of that battle station
only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found
It's not over yet
It is for me, sister
Look,  ain't in this for your revolution, and 'm not in it for you, Princess
expect to be well paid
'm in it for the money
You needn't worry about your reward
If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive
She angrily turns, and as she starts out of the cockpit, passes Luke coming in
Your friend is quite a mercenary wonder if he really cares about anything
or anyone
care
Luke, shaking his head, sits in the copilot seat
He and Han stare out at the vast blackness of space
So
what do you think of her, Han
'm trying not to, kid
(under his breath) Good
Still, she's got a lot of spirit don't know, what do you think
Do you think a princess and a guy like me
No
Luke says it with finality and looks away
Han smiles at young Luke's jealousy
The battered pirateship drifts into orbit around the planet Yavin and proceeds to one of its tiny green moons
The pirateship soars over the dense jungle
An alert guard, his laser gun in hand, scans the countryside
He sets the gun down and looks toward the temple, barely visible in the foliage
- Rotting in a forest of gargantuan trees, an ancient temple lies shrouded in an eerie mist
The air is heavy with the fantastic cries of unimaginable creatures
Han, Luke and the others are greeted by the Rebel troops
Luke and the group ride into the massive temple on an armored military speeder
- The military speeder stops in a huge spaceship hangar, set up in the interior of the crumbling temple
Willard, the commander of the Rebel forces, rushes up to the group and gives Leia a big hug
Every one is pleased to see her
(holding Leia) You're safe
We had feared the worst
Willard composes himself, steps back and bows formally
When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were
lost along with your father
We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander
The battle station has surely tracked us here
(looking pointedly to Han) It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape
You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack
It is our only hope
The surface of the Death Star ominously approaches the red planet Yavin
- Grand Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader are interrupted in their discussion by the buzz of the comlink
Tarkin moves to answer the call
Yes
We are approaching the planet Yavin
The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side
We are preparing to orbit the planet
- lone guard stands in a tower high above the Yavin landscape, surveying the countryside
mist hangs over the jungle of twisted green
- Dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display
Leia and several other senators are to one side of the giant readout
The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots, navigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots
Everyone is listening intently to what Dodonna is saying
Han and Chewbacca are standing near the back
The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet
It's defenses are designed around a direct large- scale assault
small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense
Gold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands and addresses Dodonna
Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that
Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense
An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station
Artoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping sounds, and turns his head from right to left
The approach will not be easy
You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point
The target area is only two meters wide
It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port
The shaft leads directly to the reactor system precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station
murmer of disbelief runs through the room
Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction
The shaft is ray- shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes
Luke is sitting next to Wedge Antilles, a hotshot pilot about sixteen years old
That's impossible, even for a computer
It's not impossible
used to bull's- eye womp rats in my -sixteen back home
They're not much bigger than two meters
Man your ships
And may the Force be with you
The group rises and begins to leave
The Death Star begins to move around the planet toward the tiny green moon
Tarkin and Vader watch the computer projected screen with interest, as a circle of lights intertwines around one another on the screen showing it's position in relation to Yavin and the forth moon
Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity
The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes
This will be a day long remembered
It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion
- Luke, Threepio and little Artoo enter the huge spaceship hangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters
Flight crews rush around loading last-minute armaments and unlocking power couplings
In an area isolated from this activity Luke finds Han and Chewbacca loading small boxes onto an armored speeder
' (over loudspeaker) All flight trooper, man your stations
All flight troops, man your stations
Han is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter pilots' preparation
Luke is quite saddened at the sight of his friend's departure
So
you got your reward and you're just leaving then
That's right, yeah
got some old debts 've got to pay off with this stuff
Even if  didn't, you don't think 'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you
Why don't you come with us
You're pretty good in a fight
could use you
(getting angry) Come on
Why don't you take a look around
You know what's about to happen, what they're up against
They could use a good pilot like you
You're turning your back on them
What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it
Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage
It's more like suicide
All right
Well, take care of yourself, Han
guess that's what you're best at, isn't it
Luke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him
Hey, Luke
may the Force be with you
Luke turns and sees Han wink at him
Luke lifts his hand in a small wave and then goes off
Han turns to Chewie who growls at his captain, What're you lookin' at
know what 'm doing
- ' Luke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter
What's wrong
Oh, it's Han
don't know,  really thought he'd change his mind
He's got to follow his own path
No one can choose it for him
only wish Ben were here
Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off
As Luke heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs his arm
Luke
don't believe it
How'd you get here
are you going out with us
Biggs
Of course, 'll be up there with you
Listen, have  got some stories to tell
Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up behind Luke and Biggs
He has the confident smile of a born leader
Are you
Luke Skywalker
Have you been checked out on the Incom -sixty- five
Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories
Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of his fighter
met your father once when  was just a boy, he was a great pilot
You'll do all right
If you've got half of your father's skill, you'll do better than all right
Thank you, sir
'll try
Red Leader hurries to his own ship
've got to get aboard
Listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back
All right
told you 'd make it someday, Biggs
(going off) You did, all right
It's going to be like old times, Luke
We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped
Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement
He heads for his ship
As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the back of the fighter
This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up
Do you want a new one
Not on your life
That little droid and  have been through a lot together
(to Artoo) You okay, Artoo
The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft
Now a part of the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps that he is fine
Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an his helmet
Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner into Luke's -wing
It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo beeps good-bye
Okay, easy she goes
Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back
Artoo beeps in agreement
You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you
Artoo whistles his reply
All final preparations are made for the approaching battle
The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments
The hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands
Coupling hoses are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled
Cockpit shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot
signalman, holding red guiding lights, directs the ships
Luke, a trace of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles
' Luke, the Force will be with you
Luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones
- All that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard standing on a small pedestal jutting out above the dense jungle

- Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main temple
Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows
Banners are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the beautiful young Senator Leia
Luke and the others solemnly march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia
From one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired Artoo-Detoo
He waddles up to the group and stands next to an equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the whole event
Chewbacca is confused
Dodonna and several other dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia

He winks at her
She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who is moved by the event
They turn and face the assembled troops, who all bow before them
Chewbacca growls and Artoo beeps with happiness
