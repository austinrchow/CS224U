And --
in his side
part of the wound oddly
He winces
Trying to solve this painful puzzle
Something  on his wrist: No clasp to pull it off
He touches the surface --  --  -- It's
And there's a   on the ground
The Man grabs it to shield his eyes
but : in the inner brim
Young, beautiful
The Man stares: does he  this woman
is this even  hat
The dog
The man turns --  -- his hand reaches toward his hip on  but there's no holster
: -- ,  and
Dusty and tough
Wes gallops right up to our Man, gives him the once over -- Howdy
( ) We're riding towards Absolution
You know how far west we are
The Man's got   what he's talking about
Maybe he's a dummy
Wes hops off his horse, right in The Man's face now -- There a reason you don't wanna answer my question, friend
And now, Mose nods to the  on The Man's wrist -- Wes, he's got iron on his wrist
and he's been shot
Bet he's a chain jumper
Luke spurs his horse behind him -- The Man's

If he escaped, there'll be a bounty
Let's bring him with us
Wes nods as he slides a - - from his back scabbard
both barrels
The dog  -- Not your lucky day, Stranger -- turn round and start walking
But The Man doesn't move
The Claibornes share glances
Wes steps forward --    -- (') Dead or alive, no difference
said -- ,      --  the rifle forward as  -- shot goes  -- suddenly the gun's in '  --  Wes is  backwards,
As Hose draws his Enfield, The Man  the rifle again -- as The Man rolls -- Luke's horse --  Luke's ankle -- suddenly Luke's  on his back -- , staring  at the double-barrel: -- -please, God -- d-don't -- -- The Man  the trigger but
The rifle's
Luke's  is short as The Man  the gun-butt down, knocking him out cold
And  of this took about ten seconds
This man is a cold-blooded
But somehow
he didn't seem to  that
Drops the rifle, looks down at his hands
covered in
And the  in his wake
The  loosens a piece of  from Wes's jacket
It on the breeze -- flattens against The Stranger's foot
He picks it up,   on what we now see is a  -- "   --  -- --  --         -- --   -- " (a hoarse whisper) Absolution

The Man sends two horses , mounts the third, wincing at that gash in his side
Starts to trot off
sees the dog following

(') Get outta here
Leave me alone
But the dog keeps following
Like they're  now
The man turns away dismissively as we   to reveal the below
and a  within it that is: -   - : "
" The town is dismal and forgotten
Crumbling buildings blistered by sun
The Man rides in -- dehydrated, the wound  him
His eyes fall on the first building he sees
- The door flies open and
The Man looks at the dog and says -- Stay
The dog sits by the door as The Man enters --  -- he's moving -- into a small kitchen area -- bottle of whiskey -- uncorks it with his teeth -- drinks -- pours some on the wound -- then    behind him -- Meet , town preacher, a tough, wash-foot Baptist: Palms to heaven, Friend
The Man freezes
Turns up his hands
Been shot
Only two kinds of men get shot -- criminals and victims
(steps forward; hard) Which one're you
don't know
Meacham hears the  in his voice
Knows a lost soul when he sees one
Lowers his gun, softening
Got a name, son
Don't know that either
5
What do you know
(a beat; then) English
Off Meacham,  -- we  : - -- a  passing through it -- it's  and Meacham's studying The Man's wound: Odd wound
Looks
cauterized
(off The Man's look) Means somethin' burned it half closed
The Man just stares
News to him
And now, as Meacham leans over the wound, the   around his neck begins to twitch
lifting ever so  off his chest -- towards the strange  on the Man's wrist
Meacham reacts -- (') Nice trick
That some kinds
magnet
The Man looks at him -- "What the hell is a 'magnet'
" Meacham shrugs it off, readies the needle -- (') Try'n hold still
He pokes the hot needle through the wound -- The Man winces slightly, but bears the pain
(') Where'd you ride in from
West
Woke up in the desert
Looking up at the sun like 'd been dropped outta the sky
Seems  remember a story about that happening once
fella by the name of Lucifer
() How 'bout  just call you "Luke," for short
But TheMan's distracted by his  in a cracked mirror: his own face unfamiliar
Meacham nods towards The Man's  -- 6
(') That blood yours or somebody else's
Three men rode up
Drew on me
( ) My hands
moved on their own
( ) Anything else you wanna confess to while you got my attention
And The Man senses somehow that, ygg, there is
but: Everything that happened before  woke up
(shakes his head) It's gone
Well
Too bad
Can't absolve you for your sins if you don't recall 'em
That bein' said
Meacham looks up, eyes twinkling
This is not a fire n' brimstone preacher
This is a guy who   -- (') seen bad men do good things and good men do bad things
Whether you end up in heaven or hell
it's not God's plan
it's yours
() You just got to remember what it was
The Man considers
Darkly -- What if  don't want to remember
(; ) Then you're probl'y goin' to hell
On cue --
The stained glass window  as a hurtles into the church
spreads around the pews --   -- tears curtains off the confessional and uses them to   the fire -- (') Dammit -- it's Dolarhyde's men
and  and  outside
The Man whirls to see , marauding through town -- 7

Something  in the way he emphasizes "daddy

With a growl, Percy , chucks the flaming bottle onto the  : '  - Meacham finishes putting out the fire, grabbing a couple blankets as he moves past The Man -- You wanna help or are you just gonna stand there and burn
-  - run for the sanctuary of the church, Meacham   the fire on the steps -- All right, folks -- don't panic
Get inside and you'll be fine
'mon
Meacham tosses The Man one of the blankets, nods across the street to the   which is just  to burn -- (') Put it out before it gets goin'

Before he can answer,  behind them -- and here's
He yanks the reins, pulls his  on our Man -- Who the hell're yam
Whatever the opposite of Love At First Sight is,  is it: Nobody
Nobody is right
You think you can just collect your fifty dollars and ride off
You signed up for the wrong side, boy
The kid's scared
The Man ', despite the gun in his face: (') Tell you what
You get down on your knees and kiss my boot
The Man's eyes narrow -- (') You do that and 'll let you run back to wherever the hell you came from so you can tell whoever you see

You want me to kiss your boot

Kiss this, you sonofa -- (

-- Nat Colorado gallops around the corner,
Goddamnit, Nat --
-- but The Man yanks Percy up by his collar, using him as a between himself and Colorado
Eerily calm -- Wherever you came from
Go back
Colorado knows he's dealing with a ride up, surprised -- a dirty outlaw, , barks: Sheriff's right behind us, Nat
You goddamned shitheels
Don't you even about leavin' me
Colorado --  -- doesn't take long -- glares at The Man -- Be seeing you
Look forward to it
With that, Nat spurs his horse --
The others follow him as he   out of town
Percy growls at The Man -- You are a dead man
You hear me
So help me God  will kill you my-- The Man's  Percy's skull with the gun, knocking him , as  approach on horseback -- He caught Percy Dolarhyde
rears up on his horse
Tall, dark and handsome despite a  in his eyes, already dismounting: Emmett -- you all right
The Kid (now ) strides towards his father excitedly: 10

Taggart turns to The Man now, cautious, but grateful -- Pardon my boy, mister
He can be excitable

The Man shakes Taggart's hand

Then -- Luke
Well 'm in your debt, Luke
Tune of fifty dollars, actually

The Man  -- Oh,

-- 'm just passing through
Fair enough
You don't mind spending the night, bank opens in the morning
'll get you your money then
(nods down the street) Saloon's got rooms
You just tell Maria sent you
The Man tips his hat, nods to Emmett (still ), turns to go
Taggart furrows his brow as the  scampers after him
(') You here with the prospector woman
The Man stops
Intrigued
Turns back -- woman
Yup

She a friend of yours

And as The Man heads off, we   , his spidey-sense tingling that all is not  with this
Somethin' wrong, Kyle
What's that French sayin' where you swear you seen someone before
Don't speak French
No

Taggart takes one last look at The Man departing as we  : - 300 head of  under a blood red sky --   to by a fire
One's drinking liberally from a ; call him
The other two trade glances, nervous: #1 Should take it easy there, Pal -- #2 Mr

She looks at him  -- yes, some  withheld
As The Man In Black reaches the bar, he's Maria's  to end this: We have customers
And  off
Doc stomps toward the exit -- sees  at the back of the bar stealing sips of  from left-behind glasses: Emmett
The Man sits beside an old cuss named
The dog heels at The Man's feet, eyes a  on Atticus' plate: That mutt makes a move for my steak, 'll drill him down

Shut up, Atticus
This is the man who took out Percy Dolarhyde
Atticus grumbles and goes back to eating, but not before sweeping his duster aside to show the  in his holster
Maria rolls her eyes, sets a  in front of The Man, who nods: 'm looking for a woman
She gestures to the  -- What kind

Maria pours him another: (') You have any idea what kind of mess you just stepped into
No
But  figured 'd be safe in here seein' as how that boy  tossed off his horse didn't wanna burn your saloon

Somehow

Cowtowns sprang up all along these prairies, Roy; populated by enterprising young drovers -- among 'em, my daddy, Jeremiah Dolarhyde

Lee for twenty of the scrawniest Longhorns you ever saw -- then turned 'em into the fattest herd West of the Chisholm Trail

but what good's a whip without a herd, Roy
And slowly, torturously,  the whip tip in the dirt

Wills, would it not
Jake just stares,

We catch only a  of this, and for a moment it's
until she turns and something  is revealed: criss- crossed   on her back
She turns away and starts to  herself with water, erasing the blue goo and dirt from her skin and face
then: ignites behind her
She , startled, covering her breasts with her arms --  is sitting in a chair at the Commodore's desk, casually lighting a cheroot in his mouth: You missed a spot
The hell,-re- you doing here
Mindin' my own business
(snaps out the match) Then you decided to take a shower
Why didn't you say anything
Givin' you privacy
She throws her shirt on, but her skin's wet and the shirt glues to her, celebrating her shape in a way that can't be ignored
Jake tosses her his jacket
As she slips it on, she notices a bottle of  on the table

But remains, true to character, : Don't matter

Jake just looks at her
Then, lifts the cheroot to his lips, the  of its tip casting him in a demonic light
What matters is  find the thing that killed her
(dark as hell) And make it pay
And now, he leans forward with a focused
holds up his : (') Where'd you see this before

Ella -- somehow  -- opens her mouth to lie

She swallows: a mixture of  that he's found her out
and at what was done to her
52
They took my people
Destroyed where 'm from
Where's that
North of here
Been trackin' 'em ever since, town to town
Best  figure, they're hidin' in a mine
Jake  all this
Softens a little: Maybe if you'd told me the truth instead of throwin' rocks at me -- -- what, you would've stuck around
Bullshit
couldn't've turned you away from what you had to do, any more than could've stopped these people from going after their kin
() Truth ain't worth a damn, Jake

She smiles as he rides up, dismounts: Second damn time that dog ran off on me
