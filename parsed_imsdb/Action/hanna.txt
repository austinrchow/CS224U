1 Winter
Silence on the forest floor
Snow falling
Then the sound of breathing
The soft footfall of a person running
, fourteen years old, long hair, eyes like blue ice, glides through the trees, a bow strapped to her shoulder
She is dressed in animal skins and fur shoes
She blends almost completely into the landscape of trees and snow
She stops dead
Her breath visible in the freezing air
Suddenly alert, she has spotted her prey
nuzzling the snow, trying to unearth a patch of grass to eat
Its head pops up - danger
Too late
The sudden swoosh and the snap of an arrow piercing its skin
The deer flops to the ground with a thud
It whines, its feet dig at the earth
Its mouth gnaws at the icy air
Steam pouring from its nostrils
approaches, removes a fur glove
She bends to her knees
She reaches out and gently pets the animals frightened face
She runs her hand down along its neck, in towards the wound
just missed your heart
She stands and pulls out an old pistol from her waist holster
She fires two shots directly at

(') () Cut from the rear to the brisket
She works calmly without expression

-  3 The deer lies on it's side
breaths hard
She reaches deep into the body cavity and pulls out intestine, stomach, liver
She freezes, sensing danger
Her hand deep inside the animal
She listens
She looks out into the still forest
No sound
, mid forties, a mammoth with leathery face, stands behind her like a ghost
You're dead
Right now
've killed you
spins spraying deer-blood on to the snow and brings her fist right to 's face
He blocks and thumps an open palm on to 's shoulder sending her sprawling into the snow
She leaps to her feet, as  aims a kick at her head
She dodges, punches below his knee cap, and goes for her pistol
slaps the hand away
(') Use your hands
She goes for the gun again and again he stops her
He moves in tight, pulling the gun from its holster and tossing it deep into the forest
clips ' temple sending him to the ground
She wraps her arms around his neck preparing to snap
but she can't
He throws her over his shoulder into a pile of snow
stands and wipes the snow from his pants
His face shows a touch of frustration
He plods into the forest
(') Drag it back yourself
drags herself to the deer's side
She stares at its dead face

-  4 clears the kill site
Wipes the last dots of blood on to a stick
No sign she was ever there
5
-  5 drags the 200 lb deer on a makeshift sled
She lifts her knees high and moves at a steady pace
Hidden among the trees, a little way off,  is watching her
6
-  6 log cabin built around an ancient tree surrounded by the thick forest
is standing in the snow, stripping the deer with a knife
It's a tough job but she does it no fuss
7
-  7 Almost everything  and  own they've made themselves using what can be found in the forest
What few possessions that have been brought in from the outside world are old and worn
is making a fire using a bow drill
The friction of the drill produces an ember which  carefully transfers to some dried leaves

-  8 and  sit either side of a small fire, still dressed in furs
swirls a spoon around in a dish of stew
takes a mouthful, watches  not eating
What's wrong
Are you hurt
She keeps swirling her spoon

How much did you pull off the deer

-  9 is in bed under fur covers listening while  reads to her from an old encyclopedia
The Great Blue Whale is the largest animal to have ever existed
blue whale's tongue weighs over two and a half tons and its mouth is large enough to hold 90 tons of food and water
How much is that
It's bigger than the cabin
Its heart weighs thirteen hundred pounds and a male has seven gallons of testicles
smirks
(') The Blue Whale's "music" can be heard for over 500 miles
He shuts the book
(') Time for sleep
Good night
He stands by her bed looking down at her
Did you forget something
No
takes ' gun out of his pocket and puts it on the table next to her bed
(') Sorry
Good night
He walks to the door
stops him with a question
6
What's music like
It's difficult to explain
Try
He opens the encyclopedia again, leafs through the pages and reads
() a Music
combination of sounds with a view to beauty of form and expression of emotion'
But how does it feel
Erik is not equipped to answer such esoteric questions
Good
It feels good
It's, uh, nice
Tell me properly
Can you play music
Your mother could
She used to sing very well
'd like to hear it for myself
You will soon enough
How soon
Erik looks away from her questioning eyes
When you're ready
'm ready
'm ready already
They look at each other- he weighs it up
Just go to sleep now
'll see you in the morning

Hanna covers herself in an animal skin as  pulls a wattle screen across her bed, strokes her hair gently for a moment and leaves the room
reaches under her bed and takes out an old battered photograph, taken 15 years ago, of a   with eyes like hers - her ,
10
-  10 The morning sunlight slants through the forest
is walking through the trees
He stops, raises his pistol at a tree trunk some distance away and fires
The tree breaks apart
11
'
-  11 wakes with the sound of the
She is still holding her mothers photgraph
pushes the photograph under her mattress and climbs out of bed
12
-  12 Another  breaks a tree apart
Hanna fires
Another tree breaks apart
She rolls and fires
She rolls and fires
She reloads
And fires

Her strikes are solid

-  14 medium size log nailed along two pillars of the cabin acts as a chin-up bar
Erik and Hanna do chin-ups
Both are fit
Neither will give up
observing 's power
Both have the sense that he is judging her
's face fiercely determined
15
-  15 and  sit with their backs to a tree in the huge forest as they breathlessly recover from the exhaustion of the exercise
speaks fast, reciting
live in Leipzig
German city
Population 0
7 Million people
We live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz go to school at the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium and my best friends are Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess like literature and sport, in particular tennis and athletics have a dog called Trudi
16
-  16 is running, racing
Fierce determination, almost anger in her eyes
They reach the river and dive in
17
-
17 and  are swimming hard against the current of the fast-flowing river, working at full pelt just to stay still
They swim and swim, their muscles busting, their lungs bursting
Don't give up
Don't give up
's arms flails as she fights against the stream and she screams in pain
She is grabbed under by the undertow and is pulled downwards
For a second she is underwater and in darkness but 's hand pulls her back up and she breaks the surface with a gasp of relief
18
18 On the bank,  climbs out
approaches her but moodily, even angrily, she pushes him away
didn't need your help
9
Her face sullen, she walks away into the forest
He stares after her
19
-  19 Outside,  stands alone, thinking
An  swoops down to catch a mouse then flies back up into the tree tops
20
'  -
20 is asleep
enters the room
approaches the bed, and solemnly takes out a pistol and aims it at
He is tense with expectation
Suddenly  bursts from her covers, smashes the pistol from 's hand and smashes him down on to the bed
She grabs the pistol and points it at his face
She is alert, eyes intense, face proud
She speaks quietly
'm ready now
Maybe
relaxes
It's a false beat
He lunges again at her, really violently
He seems to be really trying to hurt her
But  has reached under her mattress and there is a flint knife - in an instant it is at 's neck
She pricks his neck slightly
It bleeds just slightly
Stillness and silence
breathless, angry
(') You didn't tell me you had a knife
You told me to think for myself
Isn't that what you want
She is angry for the first time
does not answer
Just stares at her
(') want to see things
can't stay here forever
10
21
-  21 takes long lunging strides straight out from the cabin
He counts his paces
One, two, three, four
22
-  22 and  are racing through the forest
Over this we continue to hear  counting his paces from the previous scene
(
) five, six, seven, eight
23
-  23 nine, ten
After 10 paces,  makes a 90 degree turn and enters the tree line
The snow and mud crunch under his boots
We continue to inter-cut the following with more close-ups of training: climbing, fighting, chin-ups, shooting
All the while we continue to hear  counting out his paces
After 40 paces, with the cabin light distant,  falls to his knees
He unsheathes a large knife and jams it into the frozen earth
24
-  24 comes out of the cabin, rubbing her eyes and yawning, eating a hunk of cold meat
She looks up to see a snow fox staring at her from the tree line
She crouches and holds out what's left of her breakfast
The fox approaches gingerly, delicately
Hello little foxy
foxy loxy
come on
come and share my breakfast
The fox comes to her and nervously accepts the scrap, withdrawing a few feet to eat it
shuffles forward carefully and gently pats the snow fox - it is only a cub
11
As the fox eats it makes low grunting noises which expertly mimics - causing the fox to look up, puzzled - they seem to have a genuine connection - as if they've done this before
Suddenly the snow fox freezes, pricks up its ears, looks up, looks up too
An aeroplane is approaching overhead
The fox darts back into the undergrowth as the roar of the plane reverberates through the forest
jumps to her feet and with incredible speed and dexterity climbs to the very top of a near by tree
The plane roars over her head and disappears over the snowy wilderness, oblivious to ' tiny presence
It's only now that we see the full extent of ' isolation
25
-
25 enters breathless with excitement
sits pensively with his back to the door
Did you see it
Wasn't it beautiful, like thunder
had to stick my fingers in my ears it was so loud
Did you hear it
She stops, sensing ' mood
(') What's wrong
Sitting in front of  is a metal case, caked with frozen dirt
pops open the case
Inside a tangle of technology
looks at the case, mesmerized
(') What does it do
It tells Marissa Wiegler where we are
He looks at her, a hint of a challenge
(') When you want to leave here all you have to do is flip that switch
She approaches the box and places a single finger on the small red switch
12
(') But once it's done, there'll be no going back
She'll never give up until you're dead, or she is
You understand
wont be there to hold your hand
So be sure
Be sure it's what you really want
You're not scaring me
He looks at her disbelievingly
She shakes her head in protest, but simultaneously moves away from the switch
He softens towards her
It's here
There's no rush
Take your time
turns her back on the box, but can't help taking another look at it over her shoulder
26
'  -  26 is under the covers again while  reads more from the encyclopedia
Laika, a mongrel dog from the streets of Moscow, was the first animal to orbit the Earth
She was launched into outer space on the third of November, 1957
Scientists believed humans would be unable to survive conditions of outer space, so flights by animals were viewed as an experimental precursor to human missions
Her rocket was not designed to be retrievable, and Laika had always been intended to die
That's sad
awkwardly turns the page to change subject
When a star collapses the supernova explosion is 10 billion times brighter than other stars
shuts her eyes and tries to imagine how bright that might be
13
27
-  27 straps the bow to his chest and grabs a quiver of bolts
Will you hunt with me
Hanna is sweeping the ground
If you want
It's up to you
Me
Yes
eyes the box sitting open, it's waiting for her
'll stay
Fine
leaves abruptly
continues to sweep the ground, her movements bring her closer to the metal box
She stops sweeping and looks at the box
She turns and walks out of the cabin
28
-  28 comes out of the cabin and sits down on a tree trunk
She sees the snow fox cub but says nothing
It comes over and noses around the cabin, but ' mind is elsewhere
(whispering to herself) Marissa Wiegler
29
-  29 - the metal box, the switch catches the light from the door as  enters to confront it
The room is still and quiet
approaches the metal box and slowly reaches out her hand
14
() Come and find me
- She flips the switch, a little red light begins to flash
An   begins to ring as we cut to - 30
'
-   30 - a bedside alarm clock ringing loudly
, a handsome woman in her mid-40's with red hair, reaches over and slams the alarm clock off
She's alone in her bed
She always is
She has no children
She's made choices in her life and lives without looking back
She walks into her ensuite bathroom and looks at herself in the mirror
She collects her toothbrush and bares her teeth in a snarl as she brushes them
Her gums bleed a little

She's cooking a feast enters
He stamps his feet shedding ice at the door
He walks by the box and sees the little red light flickering on
sees this and sees him smile, but she knows he's sad
You were lucky to grab that deer
There was nothing out there today
looks over at the meal  is preparing
(') Smells good
He wraps an arm around her shoulder
They don't hug much and it shows
is almost defensive and tense
And then the hug is over

-  32 , wearing a sharp business suit, drives a black Acura into her designated spot in the  's car park
As she gets out, we see the parking space is designated for Her young male  and   are already waiting for her
15
Ma'am
We've had a signal reported by Interpol
We think it's Eric Heller
An unusual expression of shock on ' face
Well 'll be
It seems he's in Sweden
Jokkmokk
40 miles out
What the fuck is he doing there
Living in the middle of nowhere, like the frigging Una Bomber
The son of a bitch
Sweden
Sweden
The  hands her a coffee and she hands him some files
Apparently he turned on his locator
He's not an idiot

But that's what happened
After 14 years in Jokkmokk, maybe he'd rather go to prison

34 sits in a video conference room surrounded by worried looking faces, with her are her close advisors  and
She's also speaking into a microphone on the table in front of her
Trouble was he had his own way of doing things
Kinda paranoid

He uses an access code
This takes him to a new file
He enters the tracking device number

He clicks on a link
's face pops on to the screen
(') Not a team player
Not a ajoiner
a He became increasingly isolated and disturbed
Kept mouthing off about classified programmes

picture of Heller in the article and a smashed car on a rural road
The two men stare at his face
(') kept warning and he kept getting worse
In the summer of 1995 he took his girlfriend, Johanna Zadek, on a trip to the Baltic coast and blew her head off
hits a new link:  still of the same young woman as the photo  was previously looking at in her bedroom
Her name printed below it:

) What do you want us to do
Bring him in
What do you mean
Call the police, - - Walt
This is exactly the kind of shit we can't have out there anymore
He was one of ours, we trained him
He kills some other poor woman and it's a cluster fuck
Tell it to Interpol
Let them pick him up
Try him for murder
He's right
This has nothing to do with us
don't understand
You don't have to

That'll be all

, dressed incongruously in the suit and tie, enters and sits on the edge of her bed
She doesn't look up from her book

Good night my sweet girl
He stands and quietly goes to the door when her voice stops him

They approach
Silence in the darkness
Just the breathing of men in the icy cold

-  41 stops her push-ups, sensing the approach
She silently springs to her feet and moves to the front of the cabin
She looks out and sees shadows moving among the trees
She turns and presses herself against the wall

The rest of the forces surround the cabin, but at a distance
The two men approach the cabin
One opens the door and the other steps in

It is a file with a photo of herself clipped to it and a collection of papers - she scans it and reads in several places the letters aDNA

- The  laboratory suddenly seems empty
The buzz of the lab's lighting and the whir of the air- pressurizes are the only sounds as the  looks around
Then the  hears a rustling from behind her and tenses up
She turns around but  has vanished into thin air, there is silence
74
74 , runs along the corridor
She has in her hands the results which she scrunches up and jams into a pocket
75
-
75 eyes the vent above her
She peers around a corner - her only other route of escape and sees: 76
76 reach the intersection close to  and spread out, all going in different directions but none coming towards her
30
The last pair of personnel start heading towards her
She looks up at the duct again and a length of ducting along the wall, about waist height
She puts a foot on a rail, halls herself up towards the vent
She fiddles with the vent, eventually opening it as the personnel are almost upon her
77
-
77 She crawls through the narrow air-conditioning duct
She stops, alert to the sounds beneath her
Through small perforations in a vent she sees more running down the corridor
78
-
78 The duct bends to a vertical angle
She begins to crawl up a steep gradient towards a crack of light
79
79 sits in silence
looks at him nervously
You think she's out
She can't get out
picks up an internal telephone
(') ( ) Who's on the perimeter
Detail every unit available
80
-
80 is sweating, exhausted, blinking in the darkness, trying to make out what the light source is
The gradient has got steeper and she starts to slide backwards on the smooth metal surface
She digs her fingers into the rivets joining the plates of stainless steel, trying to get a purchase
She summons the last of her strength and reaches a crest
She rests a moment, then hauls herself over the crest and immediately starts sliding
she tumbles, gathering pace, falling down a long chute into the blackness
She has no idea where she is or what's happening, but she's covering a lot of ground
31
She hits the bottom with a crunch and cries out
When she opens her eyes she sees more tunnel - and at the end light
She crawls quickly towards it and stops at a kind of manhole cover with a sprung lever - she wrenches the lever and pushes against it
After a little effort the cover gives way and light floods in, blinding her
recovers and tentatively pokes her head out into: 81
/
81 - 's pale face appears, eyes crinkled shut
Wider -  emerges from a hole in the ground in the middle of a sandblasted desert and slams the cover closed
Total silence now, except for the whistle of the wind on sand
It takes her eyes a moment to adjust to the blinding light
Blearily she looks out across this alien environment
After a moment her ears prick up
She turns just in time to see a column of Military Jeeps rise over a sand dune in the distance behind her
The jeeps are crawling straight towards her, ominously shimmering in the desert heat
She quickly ducks back down into her rabbit hole and waits
82
82 In the middle of the desert the soldiers convene, looking for military truck is stationery
Nothing around for miles
We hear a military voice on a radio
(
) 473 are you receiving me
Can you confirm your position
Subject has escaped
83
83 The truck moves off a short distance and stops again
Meanwhile a large convoy of Military Vehicles passes right over
When it has past she sees the first vehicle crawling to a halt right near the hole - just yards away
One of the   in the jeep gets out and goes over to the hole, lifts the lid, inspects the darkness
The Truck radio is on and we hear the voice
Can you confirm your position 473
Banks
Banks can you hear me
32
Once  is satisfied he walks away a few paces, gets out a pair of high powered binoculars, looks this way and that
He walks up a dune and scans the dunes with his binoculars
Finally he walks back and climbs into the Jeep, gets on the radio
'm at a perimeter opening at the far east wing
Something's not quite right
He doesn't notice but the lid is open now and the air- conditioning duct is empty
: As the Jeep moves off we see  is clinging to the axle, hanging upside down underneath
Her face is pressed to the oily metal, her back just an inch from the desert floor flashing beneath her
The jeeps now take a track along the edge of a steep dune
takes her chance and lets go of her grip
She clenches her eyes shut as the jeep passes over her
As soon as the jeeps clears she rolls herself over the edge of the dune
rolls down the sand dune at speed until finally she slows and stops
She lies still and shocked by the quiet as the Jeep disappears into the distance
Then she sits up and looks around herself
She has no conception of this landscape, no idea where she might be

-  84 moves between her wardrobe and a suitcase packing clothes, underwear, another power suit
Fully packed she goes to the back of the wardrobe and pulls aside some dresses to reveal a hidden safe
She keys in the security code, the safe door opens and from the back of the safe Marissa retrieves a blue file
looks at the files title in large blunt letters: 85
-  85 to 1995
much younger  watching a very fast-moving car on a deserted forest road
She takes from her pocket a small detonating device and as the car approaches a bend, presses it
33
There is a small explosion and the car swerves off the road and smashes headlong into a post
The horn starts to blare
approaches the car
The road is empty
looks through binoculars at the car
She sees a woman, on the passenger side, head thrust forward
Blood everywhere
shoots her in the head just to be sure
But the driver's seat is empty stops dead
Then the back door opens on the other side
man, a younger crawls out
He is holding a two year old child in his hands
The child's coat is covered in blood
stares at the shocked child and takes the rifle to her eye to shoot again
As she does,  senses her movement and throws himself to the ground
Through the rifle viewfinder we see just a glimpse of and the red glare of the coat covered in blood, grabbing the child and sprinting for the forest, taking aim at , and then firing as  dives into the forest

-  86 puts on a pair of rubber kitchen gloves and sets fire to the file in the sink
When it's all burnt up she switches on the garbage disposal and pushes the ashen remains down the gurgler with a dish mop
87
-  87 The sun has dipped a little now, the shadows of the dunes are longer, but the heat is still intense
's throat is parched by the dry heat, her pale eyes scorched by the angry sun
She walks purposefully but with a growing awareness of her tiny scale in this seemingly endless sea of sand
She has no conception of this landscape, no idea where she might be

enters the outskirts, teaming with scooters, trucks, taxis, mules and goats
The impact knocks  backwards, assailed by the smells of dried fruit, meat tagines, couscous cooking at market stalls, fresh fish and meat, still bloody and twitching, hanging in the sun for the flies
She listens to the babble of Arabic, her ears, nose and eyes sensitive to every conversation and twitch of life
It all overpoweringly exotic and visceral to her
An old broken-backed woman inches her way to market stares at her in astonishment
Her wrinkled skin

Of course

Some American, 'm sure
He picks up an electric kettle

He switches it on, Hanna stares as it heats up noisily
He goes to a small wall mounted , switches it on for her, a fuzzy, terrible picture of an Arabic  show

She stumbles and falls through the bathroom door straight into the shower, inadvertently turning the taps on
Water pours down on her

She runs back into the bedroom
In the bedroom the kettle is still having a violent tantrum, the  is still screaming, the fan still cutting, the phone still shouting

Smashes at the door

128 loud out door rave in a Roman amphitheatre
and  stand at the top of the amphitheatre looking down on the thrilling spectacle, soaking up the bass, the abstract sounds, the sheer volume, the pulsing lights and electric atmosphere -  is thrilled and startled
Many of the crowd seem to be wearing fancy dress stares at a girl dressed as a red ladybird
: The girls approach a bar and  goes to order
She's forced to mime and shout her order over the music
Vodka

The bartender shakes his head and holds up two bottles of water
Water only
No booze
Meanwhile  spots , the handsome from the camp site shop, across the dance floor
He is staring at her again
comes back with two bottles of water and hands one to What do they call this music
Banging
stares at the dancers, people losing themselves in it - just grins, starts to move to the music
smiles awkwardly, tries to copy
: enters the rave followed by two of his
They split up and start to survey the crowd
Over in a secluded corner  sees a drug deal taking place
sidles over to the  and his
The , thinking  is probably a cop, makes a hasty getaway
What you got
(in Spanish w/ English ) Nothing man
That guys just a friend
frisks the , nothing
He turns the against the wall and checks his socks where he finds a stash of tiny baggies each containing a gram or two of white powder
samples the powder and pockets the lot

What the fuck
turns as he walks away and puts a finger to his lips

The girls just look at each other

American
You like to party
They watch, puzzled, as  smiles disinterestedly and leads  away
Will you teach me to do dancing
It's easy
and  walk onto the dance floor and begin to dance
starts by dancing like a five year-old, swinging her arms jerkily and lifting her feet as if walking through a field
But soon her movements become more sophisticated and expressive

He eyes the bodies around him greedily
He takes another dab of the white powder and rubs it into his gums
: Back on the dance floor,  and  are dancing

' Have you come here before
All the time
' Really
You dance well
So do you
and  hold eye contact
The music rises and now they're lit only by the intermittent flashes of a strobe light
and  begin to dance around each other, their movements caught in still flashes
: From some distance away  spots
He smiles and starts to move through the crowds towards her
: and the  are kissing
sees this and laughs
The crowd is jumping
feels ' hand take hers, she flinches a moment, then lets him draw her towards him
Their eyes still locked
is getting closer, his eyes flashing eerily in the strobe lighting
and  are in a world of their own
His fingers trace the lines of her arms, shoulders and neck
He draws her face towards his
63
Are we going to kiss now
Would you like to
Kissing requires a total of thirty- four facial muscles
Their lips are almost touching
(') The most important muscle involved is the orbicularis oris muscle, which is used to pucker the lips - He kisses her
closes her eyes
moves in
becomes more ardent, puts his arms around her waist, she doesn't like it
He tries to open her mouth with his
snaps
In a few swift moves,  pulls  round and throws him to the ground
She falls to his side and, with one knee on his back, she holds his head, about to snap his neck
turns and sees them on the ground
few of the closest  also stop dancing and stare
backs off, watching from a safe distance

Should  let him go
As opposed to what
Yes, you should let him go

Sure
It was nice
And she's gone, pulling  away through the crowd
jumps into action
But he's lost sight of the girls among the mass of dancing bodies
and  move quickly through the crowds towards the exit
Oh, my God, Hanna

Where d'you learn to do that

If he's alive why would he contact me
That depends on whether you believe he's innocent, or not

She's thorough and fast
She rips cushions and throws books from their shelves
Her actions become progressively more frantic, relishing the destruction
She finds more and more photograph's of
The photographs seem to have a driving effect on her
She walks down the hall and opens a door onto a small spare bedroom that had been turned into home office

On the platform  walks amongst the commuters, past the ticket collectors, past another   posing as a commuter - he stops and lingers by him, noting something not right
He moves off and enters a small bar

One of the   draws his hand gun

He stabs the other in the eye and the man falls to the ground squealing

The sound of footsteps coming into the room
silent under the bed
'   are in sight, nothing else
The green shoes come close and  feels the mattress compress as  sits on the bed
She looks at the shoes as she hears her call
Lewis
It's Marissa

The name of the woman she thought she had killed
Her face pale in shock and fear
(') You got anything
He's coming here

Double the men
But, Lewis,  want to talk to him

Another pair of shoes enter the room
Male
His name's Klaus Knepfler
He used to send Heller's things from Berlin before the Communists were kicked out of Prague
How much does he know about the programme
89
Everything
He knew Johanna
What does he know about the child
He also thinks Erik's the father
Well that's good
Everybody thinks Erik's her father
Erik probably thinks he's her father
They snigger

She can barely control her breath
Crazy bastard
You got a fix on him yet
Let's see what else Knepfler has to offer
He leaves her
suddenly senses something
Did she hear an intake of breath
She turns and quickly looks under the bed
No one there
Her imagination maybe
stands and we see the shoes walk away to the door
They reach the door

The green shoes leave

Hurriedly she climbs out from under the bed and goes to a window

'  -  165 lands having jumped from the window
She looks around quickly
Then, out of sight from the cars at the front of the house, she runs for dear life
166
-  166 walking fast, in total shock and confusion
Who is she
She walks head down, determined not to be seen
Not knowing where she is going
Her world turned upside down
She sees an internet cafe
Ducks into it

The young  comes up to her
Excuse me
You have to pay first
How much
3 Euros for half an hour
She looks at the money that Knepfler gave her
It contains Euros
She hands some over to the
How does it work

The owner brings up a search engine

He suddenly stops dead and ducks behind a fallen fibreglass dinosaur as he sees two   sitting in a car outside the house
watches for a moment or two
Then, keeping low, he makes a painful run towards the house
throws himself against the back wall of the kitchen
He breathes heavily for a moment, clutching his wounded leg
He turns and rises to look through the kitchen window
Inside he sees , stripped to the waist his body bloodied, hanging upside down from a meat hook
He's obviously dead
91
crouches back down against the wall, thinking furiously
Then, decision made, he checks sight lines and runs back across the Amusement Park away from the house

Phrases from the text leap out at her

Gets up and leaves

The flies have laid their eggs in the bloody mess of her brain that spreads across the cheap lino floor

She backs out of the kitchen and into the hall
Turns and goes through into the lounge
The lounge has been over thrown
Cushions ripped, shelving pulled down
stares at the destruction wrought by ' hunt for information

She stops and enters
The room had been turned into a home office, there are newspaper clippings relating to '  and photographs of  herself covering every available wall space

She attacks,  pushes her to one side, grabs her
fight in the apartment
Chaos, photos of Johanna crashing, lamps and bookshelves falling
murderous,  just defending himself, not willing to hurt her
But then she overpowers him, has a knife to his throat
Let me go
He releases her
She goes to the door

You didn't prepare me for this

Incredible athleticism
He dives down a side alley, losing his pursuers for a second
Takes out a gun, looking for Marissa
Looking to finish it off
Just as he has done this '  approach from the end of the street

He vaults a dividing wall, scratching himself on barbed wire
He sprints round a corner and sees a doorway ahead of him
He walks towards the doorway

There are men at the end of the alleyway
No escape drops his gun
Silence between them

Wants to make this as painful as she can for him

180
-  180 with her gun still at
Truth is  was always very fond of you
181
-  181 -  continuing to walk away
She hears a single gun shot
Stops dead
Knows what it means
An intense conflict of emotions inside her
Her breathing stops for a moment, her world seems to go silent
Then a car flies by on the main road, almost running her over, and she is woken
She sees a bus stop ahead
On auto- pilot she runs to it, a bus coming, she beckons
It stops and she is on board

She looks at the filthy carpet, the grey ceiling
She turns on the tiny
Cartoons
Tom and Jerry type stuff
But she doesn't laugh
She flicks channel
Then stands dead still
She is looking at 's dead body on the ground

stares at the image
The death of the man she spent her life with
Lost forever

Then she flicks it off
Leaves the room

188 , exhausted, sleepless and starving, comes down the shabby hotel stairs and enters the hotel bar
Grim
Empty room, old carpet, bad smell, dated pop music
Three hard- drinking men stare at her, making her uncomfortable as she goes to the bar

Do you have a sandwich

But now  snaps
She starts to roar
It's like an animal, like nothing we have seen before
She rips at his face, grabs a glass, smashes it and cuts his face with it
Pure animal rage
starts to scream, blood pouring from his eyes
He collapses on the floor
She kicks him, punches him, repeatedly in a grief-fuelled rage until she is spent of her primal fury and falls, panting, to the floor
102
When she looks up she sees his mangled bloody body lying next to her
Not quite dead
suddenly recoils in horror
Shocked by the viciousness of her actions
Tears begins to run down her cheeks as  grabs the man's wallet, and leaves the room
189
-  189 Shaking in shock,  walks out of the hotel and down the street, in a daze, no idea where she is going
She starts to run, faster and faster, just running to run out of herself
Finally she stops and is sick
She looks up
taxi's yellow light blinks in the darkness
She looks at the businessman's wallet to see how much money is in there
She approaches the taxi
have this much
Can you take me to Galinka
190
-  190 is in the taxi as it travels a lonely Polish forest road through undulating snow-covered hills
Cold dawn is arriving
Grey skies lightening through the windscreen
Tall snowy pines tower above the car
No one else on the road, just a horse drawn cart guiding cows to pasture
It is as if from a different age
Quiet, solitary
checks the paper in her pocket
Still there
Blood on her hands from the businessman
cut in her arm
Carefully, secretly, she wipes it clean
Suddenly the taxi stops
This is as far as the money gets you
looks out
Middle of nowhere
How much further
Twelve miles
Please
But no smile from him, nothing
gets out
Starts to walk as the taxi turns and drives back the way it came
103
She is alone in the forest, freezing, shattered, hungry
Just about dawn
Cold as hell
She hears a car approach
Tries to hail it but it flies past fast
Blows icy air in her face
She continues in the freezing cold - sees the road ahead
It's hilly, winding, she isn't going to make it
Too tired
Too shattered
Time passes
Still she walks
Dead on her feet
Gathering every ounce of energy
Then the sounds of another car
But it too just flies by, ignoring her waves and cries
almost collapses in frustration
But carries on
Carries on walking
Time passes
Freezing cold
alone on the road
Can she make it
Then another car
turns, waves, cries out
And, almost magically, the car slows and stops
The window winds down

Can you help me

) Yes  can take you there

Calm, soft, comforting
It's a very dull place Galinka

But 've never really seen it
Why are you going

She looks at her and smiles a sunny, uncomplicated smile
104

Yes
You've hurt your arm
It's okay

bandages the arm

She feels the tears come

Sorry
It's okay
Are you in trouble

She fights the tears
gently holds her hand as she drives
weeping
(') What sort of trouble

Nothing is what  thought it would be
It's

Gentle

Sleep why don't you
You look very tired
It will take half an hour on this road

She begins to drift off, so long since she has slept
Her eyes fall shut and her head rests against the window
She is asleep
Vulnerable

-  192 Soft dawn light as  drives on a narrow rural road
193
-  193 looks at the sleeping
represses her gathering emotion
suddenly looking so young as she sleeps the sleep of the innocent
The rush of emotion shocks her - she is watching , not the road - and she veers off, nearly crashing the car, narrowly avoiding a tree
She puts her foot sharply on the brake
She's wearing the same as she wore at Wilhelm's House
is jolted awake
Where are we

Nearly there

) This is it

'
195 looks around
There is not much to Galinka
She is confused
106
It's so small
Yes
Just a few cottages
And the old bunker
chooses not to ask any more questions
Thank you for the ride
You're very kind
wish there was more  could do for you
looks kindly at  who is confused by the intimacy
reaches into the glove compartment and retrieves a torch which she hands to
(') Here, take this
switches the torch on and off, thinking
(') hope you find what you're looking for
Thank you
She gets out and shuts the door behind her
196
196 looks around at the grey desolation, rural poverty, the ends of the earth
In the car  stares at her, then drives off
walks through the trees along a track
Overgrown, not used for many years
She reaches a hidden entrance off the track
By the entrance there is an old battered sign
looks at the old iron gate
Rusted, locked
It has not been opened in a long time
She stares at the sign, tries the gate - yes, locked
Then she climbs the gate
She nearly tears her clothes on the spikes at the top of the gate, then leaps over and, exhausted, four days without real sleep, begins to walk up the narrow tree-lined driveway
107
197
-  197 approaches the gaping mouth of an underground bunker
She stops, looks down at the torch in her hand, switches it on and walks into the darkness
198
-  198 With only the torch light to see by  treads warily deeper into the tunnels as, behind her, the small aperture of daylight recedes slowly to nothing
The tunnels seem to stretch on for miles ahead of her
reaches a junction where four tunnels meet
She shines her torch down each tunnel, trying to decide which way to go
She stops when she sees, a little way down one of the tunnels, a child's forgotten shoe
steps forward and shines her torch down at the tiny red shoe, its buckle rusted
She walks on into the dark
finds a door which she pushes at
The door is stiff, but  uses her full weight and soon she's made enough of a gap to squeeze through
199
-  199 At first  has difficulty making out where she is, but dotted here and there are parts of an old nursery
The walls are painted with a blue sky, clouds and the figures of children holding hands
She begins to remember as, from a distant place, she hears the sound of children laughing
She shines her torch in the direction of the laughter and catches a glimpse of a child, dressed in a party frock and hat, playing hide and seek
She shines her torch the other way, and there's another, then a third and a fourth
For a moment the room seems to be filled with laughing children
Then, in an instant, they're gone again and silence returns
, lit only be the reflected light of her torch, knows she has been here before
She walks on through the tunnels
200
-  200 enters a long hall which was once the children's dormitory
108
At one end is a steep pile of metal bed frames
From a distant place in her memory  begins to hear the sound of children singing
Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you
From the far end of the dormitory come a procession of , the first of whom is carrying a large birthday cake lit with birthday candles
The children's faces glow eerily in the candle light
They're looking at  and walking straight towards her as they sing
(') Happy Biirrrrthday, dear
The  arrive at  lifting the cake towards her
(') Hanna
Happy Birthday to you
leans forward, takes a deep breath and blows
The children disappear with the flames of the candles
The sound of a woman's approaching footsteps echo through the tunnel
swings her torch beam in the direction of the footsteps
She freezes as she sees a pair of walking towards her
The same shoes as in Wilhelm's house
raises her torch beam to see the face of the woman from the car
You're Marissa Wiegler
starts to shake
has her gun pointing at  but her expression is the same sunny, uncomplicated smile as earlier
Dead silence
breathing fast
speaks in English
Don't worry sweetie
don't want to hurt you
' tone has turned into a twisted interpretation of maternal care
does not move
Like a wild animal cornered
109
(') could have killed you already when you were asleep in the car
' still shaking

All ready to shoot her should she attack or run
They are some distance away, not coming any closer
(') Did Erik tell you about this place
Where are the other children
She looks at , who waits, then answers quietly
Sleeping
They're all sleeping
don't believe you
can protect you, Hanna
Make sure you walk out of here and keep walking
Grow up and grow old in safety and security
No one need know a thing
But you have to trust me
You can't talk about this with anyone
It's what we call aclassified
a If you tell anyone, it'll be dangerous for both of us
looks at her, remembering what  told her, trying hard not to succumb
You killed my mother
You're mother didn't want you, sweetie
saved you
just stares, not believing her
(') 'm the only person left who understands who you are
The only one who cares
holds out a hand to , for  to take, a motherly gesture
(') practically am your mother
110
' stomach turns in horror
She switches off her torch and runs into the shadows
raises his gun fires
201
-  201 running through the darkness
Behind her  and the come after her
carries a large heavy torch, as does one of the
The other  all have night vision on their rifles
crouches down, she sniffs the air, can smell them coming
treads carefully down the tunnel
We see his point of view through his night vision sight, just the dark tunnel stretching on
Like a ghost ' face appears up close, her eyes a pearly white
She slams the gun back in the ' face
Still in night vision we see the fight, quick and hard
The flash of a single bullet illuminates his death
Silence once more
now has the first ' rifle
From around the corner into the next tunnel she hears the sound of feet on dirt
She presses herself against the tunnel, waits listening, hears the feet again and in one movement raises the rifle and spins round the corner
Through her night vision sight she sees a deer, scared eyes staring back at her
She releases her grip on the trigger and the deer scampers into the darkness
202
-  202 comes into the old laboratory
Through her night vision sights we see the white tiles and smashed equipment
She senses someone coming after her and ducks behind a lab bench
enters the lab carrying a hand gun and a small torch
His footsteps make a crunching sound as he steps through the broken glass that litters the floor
rises from her hiding place and stands straight into the torch light
111
She fires but is off target and only catches the ' left arm
He drops his torch which slides across the floor
comes round the lab bench to where the  should be lying but he's gone
There's a trail of blood which she follows to a metal cabinet
She stops at the cabinet and fires three shots into its flimsy doors
The dead  slides out from the cabinet
takes the dead man's hand gun and goes to retrieve the torch
She switches the torch off
203
203 , unnerved, presses himself against the wall of the tunnel
He feels something at his legs
Points his torch to find the deer pulling at his trouser leg
He shoots it
Then runs further down into the tunnel
Alerted by the sound of ' shot  starts to pursue her prey
204
204 is back in the dormitory
With torch in hand he searches under the beds
Behind him he hears  enter
He switches off his torch and crawls under a bed
walks slowly between the beds
Under the bed  is preparing to fire, now watching her feet
Suddenly the bed he's under is lifted straight up in the air and off him -  has summoned enormous strength and is clutching the end of the bed
He fires, hits nothing and she lets go - the bed comes crashing down on him again
His torch rolls away
His arms are trapped under the bed, he's unable to move
With all his might  pushes at the bed and lifts it off himself
They fight
picks up the torch and slams the torch across his temple
She grabs him by the hair and smashes his head repeatedly into the floor -  -  -  -  -
Silence - he's dead
112
sits back on the bed and looks at her bloodied hands - looks down at what she's done
Shocked by her own violence she begins to cry hot tears of bewilderment
She gets up and runs from the dormitory
205 /
/
-  205 runs back through the tunnels
No more
No more
Tears are streaming down her face as she reaches sight of the tunnel mouth and the daylight beyond
Standing in silhouette is
slows her pace and stops when she can see the white of ' eyes and the finger on ' trigger
raises the gun and aims at  - but  comes forward again, walking calmly towards her
She stops and drops her gun to the ground
(') Everything  see is nothing  want
looks at , her gentle, childlike countenance
She smiles
Let me take care of you
No
don't want that
turns her back on  and starts to walks in the opposite direction
watches her walk away
walks waiting for the shot to come
