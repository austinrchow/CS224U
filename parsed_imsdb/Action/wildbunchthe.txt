To most of America in 1913, the Age of Innocence had arrived and the stories of the Indian Wars and the Gold
RuSh and the Great Gunfighters had become either barroom ballyhoo or front-porch remiraiscences
But on both sides of the $io Grande men still lived as thia7 had in the 1 70's and 1 80's -- unchanged
men in a changing land

The horses bear the government brand and the saddles are regulation
,
wearing lieutenant's bars, rides slightly ahead of the others
He rides stiffly; always slightly in pain
Pike is a not unhandsome, leather-faced man in his early forties
thoughtful, self-educated top gun with a penchant for violence who is afraid of nothing - except the
changes in himself and those around him
Make no mistake, Pike Bishop is not a hero -- his values are not ours -- he is a gunfighter, a criminal, a bank
robber, a killer of men
His sympathies are not for fences, for trolleys
and telegraphs or better schools
He lives outside and against society because he believes in that way of life and if he has moments of sympathy for others, moments of regret, t hey ' are short lived
He is not a 'good man' according to the righteous
To them he is totally bad, and he wouldn't have it any other way
Next to him   wears the uniform of a sergeant
Dutch is bigaz good-natured with a fast gun hand, strong loyalty and, like Pike, a bone deep distaste for rules and regulations
He can sing,
has more than his share of charm, but believes in nothing except two men, and Pike is one
Behind them ride two brothers,  and  , dressed as corporals
Lyle and Tector are big, tough, hot tempered and sudden
They work together, eat together and 2
2 sometimes sleep together with the same whore
Brutal, vicious in a fight, illiterate,
they are always pressing for an advantage and once they get it -- they never let go
They are without loyalty or honor, to anyone except each other and that is limited

Angel is a good-looking, bilingual Mexican boy in his middle 20's who has seen so much blood and violence and cruelty under Diaz that he rebelled -- but his rebellion was not with Villa or Obregon, his was a one-man revolution against them all
He believes in his family, his village and the inherent dignity of
man (some men at least)
" He is faster than his companions with a gun -- and a better shot -- but he can't
laugh at the loss of love or suffer the loss of pride -- Mexican pride - a pride that can kill him, but if it does,
he will have no regrets

What's it say
(baiting him) It invites us to stay with the community and grow
It is here, perhaps with time and small miracle -- that you could be taught to read

never enlisted to serve with no smart-mouthed kid
Nor  with dogs
(grinning at Pike) ITd like to transfer to another unit -- there seems to be dissension in the ranks
(t0 Teotor and Angel) Itll transfer both of you -- just one more word
They look at him silently
He means it
Finally Tike spurs his horse and the group sta'ts for town, STATt
Ai12M  into a side street
/ with weekend visitors
Men,
women and children are
milling about, shopping and idly trading gossip
The town
has the look of turn of the century Americana along with its
Spanisn heritage
The group of soldiers enter almost unnoticed
- Riding downethe street they pass: a meeting, which, according to the  of the bass drum and a sermon denouncing rum, is presently going on inside

but here in this town, it is five cents a glass
Five cents a glass, does anyone think that that is really the price of a ----drink
The price of a drink let him decide who has lost his courage and his pride and who lies a govelling heap of clay not far removed from a beast today

10 Ti12-    , As they swing out of the saddle the other ' soldiers' join them
1l
'          their horses and step onto the boardwalk or sidewalk that surrounds the'square
Some passersby look curiously
(after a moment, a little ) Fall in -- and follow me
The men,
with the 'exception of Tector, Phil and Abe, shuffle into a ragged column of twos

, looks around
Real quiet, 'sir
' Pike looks at the horses, then at: 13, It reads:
14
and behind him the men surreptitious- ly touch their holstered forty-five automatics
Pike leaves the boardwalk, crossing toward
the railroad office
Tector and Phil stay with the horses
,
, ,
(removing his hat) Beg pardon, Ma'am
(as she stops) Let
me, Ma'am
Dutch picks up the package, Pike offers the lady his arm
She hesitates, accepts
Pike and Dutch, followed by the others, lead her across the 'street
16 T_DLY ,      Behind them
on the flat of the roof are open bedrolls, and the remains of at least three meals
It is hot
, they have been there a -long time, and they are tired

It is
hotter than hell on the tin roof and he is sweating heavily
He turns, edges forward, then nudges: 18,      , his back against the wall, Thornton is a hard-bodied, quiet-spoken man, with a lined face and the embittered manner of someone who has changed sides to stay alive and while part of his life has gone out of him with the change, the personal integrity by which he has lived is still
intact

18 ' () The soldiers sit up -- take a look
Thornton straightens, turns slowly, looks -- stiffens a little
Pike
(after a long moment) He's there
The bounty hunters react and prepare to fire
Over this shot is the sound of Pike calling to Thornton -- from the past
19       , murmurs 'goodbye' to the lady and enters, followed by the others, 20   ,      as they begin aim- aing, ready to fire
() Hold your fire; -- We wait till they come out -- catch them in the act
(to Thornton) Then
you kill him or go back to Yuma; Thornton turns toward him, his
face white, remembering- -    - ( ) 20A ,        ' window, is being whipped by a guard
20B  on the rock pile is making little ones of big ones

() What if they go
out back
() It's covered, you two-bit rednecked peckerwood
The men settle slightly
Thornton remains tense -- then turns as: 7
22 That's all we needed: - 23
What -you meant to do does not interest me What you did -- Then, seeing: 24     waiting, he steps to the ody window, smiling with the thought that their visit means
military business for the railroad
His mood
changes as the men draw their\guns and Pike steps towards him
(reaching for air) What is it
What do you want
25
,
behind the counter
Pike ignores the paymaster and turns to: 26   ,
a young, compulsive killer with just enough sense to
pour piss out of a boot (if the instructions were printed on the heel: (the instructions are -- to pour, tip
) If they move, kill them
grins happily and squats on the floor, his 12 gauge pump shotgun angled up at: 27   ,     , -     i,iho enters the office carrying
a
wrapped package and is instantly shoved into
a corner with the other prisoners
28    --
as the parade picks up kids and other scoffing supporters as it moves around the square
People and their children are crowding through the trees to the boardwalk to watch the band
and group of believers following the_,
in a formation that is almost as rigid as
their song and their faces
8
29     -- Damn them
The parade moves toward the saloon
They should have been told: Told-what
Sus t how
long do you think anyone in this manure pile can keep his mouth shut
Before Thornton can answer: 30
and his hand
touches the tin roof, ,causing him to
yelp with pain
The others snap a look in his
direction, then freeze as: 31 '
,
, leans back against a rail watching the horses and the hymn singers
After a moment, he smiles a little, beating time,
as he remembers some forgotten march he watched from his daddy's shoulders
32     -- He looks out Behind hi:: 3
3          into their saddle bags
They are almost ready to
leave
The paymaster, his assistants and the customer, their hands still up, watch
Trash -- Filthy trash
(gently
) You just
hush now -- People marching and singing coming down the street -- going to pass near the horses
33 () Well, we'll just join in
Angel, turning away, hesitates, looking up through the window : 34 Rifles -- one -- no three,
maybe more, on the roof
35
Waiting for us () Son of a bitch He turns and crosses quickly to the back door
Dutch follows
Pike opens it a little, looks ou
t at
'- 36 -- they are surrounded
- 37    --       and looks out, then curses softly
How in hell could they have known we were coming
How in hell do  know
Where do we go
- Out front -- that's where the horses are
He shuts the door, crosses toward the paymaster
10
37 We go ing
out back, Mr
Bishop
No, son -- we got company there too -- (as the boy looks at him) -Besides, when  travel,  like my feet to dangle
(indicating the prisoners) kill 'em-now
(after a moment) No
You just hold them here and wait as long as you can -- after the shooting starts
111-1 hold 'am till hell freezes over or you say different
Pike, pushing the frightened paymaster in front of him, hesitates
, looks
at
, then continues to
the door, grabs the handle, looks back again

, singing to himself, happy as a clam
39 ,     look at Pike
They are ready

terrified paymaster out into the street

screaming as the gunfire cuts him down
The marchers are frozen for a brief instant, then scatter in terror as: 42        , --

The sound of the band is drowned out by gunfire and screams
frowns a little
They was playing "Gather at the River
" You know that one
(as they quickly nod assent) Then sing it ,   ,
and joins them, marching up and down,
waving the shotgun in time to the music

man and then another
Two others are wounded by the bandits' fire
- their plunging horses
: ,
He hesitates, then lifts his gun to fire
,     ,  , , recognizes Deke, then snaps off a shot which misses Thornton and kills , a bounty hunter firing beside him
Thornton fires and: 12
45- 53 , is hit and falls into the street
them around, but two are hit, Burt is barely able to control his hors 1, theother , Abe , dies with his animal , some
of his men
following, others splitting off in different directions
Behind them,
two lie dead in the street

, stops, looks out a the window, laughs with delight at the excitement, turns:
55
He-lifts his shotgun, yells for them to halt
56    - ,  ,  FROi , dumping his laden saddle bags
His
foot hangs in the stirrup and his horse drags him after the others
The horse is shot and goes down -- Frank struggles to his feet, is out down as: 57 ,
,       , then spurs through the crowd, past Frank and into the tent
Horse, man and tent go down in a cloud of dust and canvas
Then, the horse,
Dutch still in the saddle, rises, breaks clear and races away

He screams and reels in the saddle

and rides on
69       as- his horse follows the others
70    --       the bounty hunters to cease firing after the wild bunch
71
-- around to see if they are being followed, kicking loose a lady's shawl tangled in his stirrup
72    -
Pike spurs his horse and rides away, the others following
(The six bandits remaining are Pike, Dutch, the Gorch brothers, Angel and Buck, now blinded
)-
73-      GtJNFI 75 are sobbing hysterically while townspeople move among the dead and dying, ineptly trying to help
14
73- 75 , then turns away sickened and slowly follows as the: down from the roof
76   '  --
,   , , humming softly
77    -- followed by Harrigan
78     , cursing
softly as he
watches the men rush to bodies like a
puck of wild
dogs in a gut wagon -- they smell
blood and have forgotten the leash
79    ,
, are stripping the pockets of one body while arguing over whose shot killed the man
Harrigan runs toward them
Well, just dig it out and see
if it ain't my,
06 (pointing to the paymaster) You stupid damn fools
How could you shoot this employee and let the others get away
() didn't shoot that old
boy
-My first shot killed this man
right here
(overlapping, crossing to another body) He's lying'
Him and them others was shootin' that old 'employee' full of holes while  was droppin' this bandit and them others too --  must've killed all three of 'em, sir, while -- 15
79- (interrupting him as
and the others protest) Harrigan:
He shot the old an - () Maybe we all did
(crossing to him) But by God the next time you plan your massacre a little more carefully or 'll begin it with you
() You'll begin a trip back to Yuma Prison if you don't learn to keep your mouth shut l Why - in hell didn't you kill Pike when you had the chance
But Thornton doesn't answer -- he turns, listening to: () () "Shall we gather at the river Where bright angels rise and fall Shall we gather at the river When the work's all done next fall
" 80      , (the town marshal and trombonist in the
band), , his deputy, and the bounty hunters
81   '  --
, are near the back door
turns as the men burst in : a Sing
' "Shall we gather at the river --" 82
, falls to one knee,
the shotgun dragging on the floor, his face mirroring shock and surprise
Well, how'd you like to kiss my sister's black cat's ass
Harrigan fires
slumps, goes down on the other knee
More bounty hunters burst into the room
2/27/68 16
83
, and everybody dives for cover and opens fire, riddling him with bullets
84     , the deputy and one bounty hunter with him before he is cut to pieces
85      at the shambles in the room, turn as: 86 ,  , , , a beefy redneck rancher, curses bitterly as he crosses to Harrigan
We're holding you -- your whole damned rail- road responsible for this carnage -- Mr
Benson
o (almost screaming) Innocent people are dead
women mangled -- dying --because you used our town as a battlefield; You're going to pay, sir -- your-railroad is going to pay for our blood; (blowing up) Without the railroad this place would still be a lousy little pueblo, so don't make any threats to me; (topping him) You can't ambush innocent people
on our street
() We were preventing a robbery and
attempt- ing to capture a band of outlaws
() You lured that gang in here
the rail- roadts been blabbing about a big silver payload for weeks; We represent the law
2/27/68 17
Thornton moves through them-out the door
88    --  , looking at the dead and dying, : () If it takes vigilantes -- if it takes federal troops -- 'll stop you and ----your hired killers
() can
assure you that there won't be any more trouble
My men will follow -- () (cutting him off) Your men enter this town again and they will be shot on sight; Thornton ignores them, slowly rolling a cigarette, looking after Pike
Harrigan exits, crosses to Thornton
pulled
you out of jail to get- that bunch -- and you failed -- () You gave the ordersl If you want the job done right -- you keep the hell out of it next time - You and the rest of your railroad trash" 'll do it -- but my way
- - What
makes you think there'll be a next time for you
What makes you think you're not going back behind bars for twenty more years
Thornton's face twists as he hears again the clanging of cell doors and the whimpering of prisoners
Because 'm all you've got (then, softly) Because  know him
(turning away bitterly) Because you know 'll get him -- 'll kill him rather than go-back
18
88 Twice
he' s made a fool of me - He never will again
(then, turning to Thornton) You know why you're here -- (before Thornton can ) Not because you're good -- because want him dead -- at your hands -- the hands of his old friend, his partner -- (after a moment) 11 get him -- you have my word
-  (  ) 89 They are weary, but determined
Buck, last in line, covered with blood, is swaying in the saddle
Although severely wounded, he still clutches the bags of silver
90          their horses across the d r y stream bed and up the steep bank on
t he other side
91 Angel, second to last, reaches the top, turns as: 92 ,   , , , still clutching the saddle bags
93    and calls to Pike
Fijate
94 ,     ,    as he attempts to crawl up the slope
95     ,
and stands looking down
2/12/68 19
96   ,  ,, gropes in his direction
97
'
Buck lurches forward, grabbing at Pike who steps back, Pike crosses to his horse, and painfully climbs into the saddle
(dying, almost incoherent with pain) kin still -ride
can't see, but kin ride
- (then) No,  can't -- (
then, yelling) Finish it, Mr
Bishop
98
P41 99 ,   , a He slides several feet over the smooth, round pebbles of the wash, then is still
Pike turns his horse and spurs it
up the slope
100
and halts
They don't move, all looking down-at-Buck
(after a
long moment, trying to cover the loss) You boys want to move on -- or stay here and give him a 'decent burial'
(the sentimentalist) Well,
he was a good man -- () He's dead
() And he's got a 'lot of 'good men
back there to keep him company
Too damn many
() 'd like
to say a
few kind words for all the departed -- then perhaps a hymn or two would be in order -- followed by a' church supper with a choir 20
100 (riding away) Crazy bastards -- both of you l Tector follows his brother, cursing
101        silently -- try to grin -- finally make it -- then follow
The bunch is attentive, but now certain that they are not being closely followed, they can relax a little
Pike and Dutch are side by side
() ,Ten years ago it was some shaky drunk with a tin badge that hid in the g1n mill till you cleared town with your grab
Now, they're c waitin'
for you -- : With old friends
' (pulling back to' join them) Old friends
Deke Thornton
thought he was your partner
() He was -- but he got old and tired and when that happens, things change
'He changed -- you didn't

-
The following scenes will be superimposed over 101 and 102
The suite consists of three adjoining rooms and is very plush indeed, -  in revealing night dress are hindering more than helping, a somewhat loaded Pike Bishop as he attempts to get into his clothes
The ladies are giggling
and there is a great deal of grab-ass between the three
- 101- , fully dressed and looking very sharp in his big city clothes, enters from one of
the adjoining rooms
, a tall, lovely near-naked,
dark-haired girl, follows him and takes his arm possessively
For a moment both watch: 101- ' girls'effectively stop his half-hearted attempts and begin disrobing him
() Come on pardner, let's get out of here
- (Grinning at him)- You
sound like you're all caught up, Caught up enough to know we've overstayed our welcomes (Suddenly angry) What in hell is the matter with you
Stay -- please, ' () We've got money
to spend and not a worry in the worlds () They're not going to look for us in their own backyard, () 3/21/68 20- 101-4 (): How can you be
so damned sure
He shakes off the girl, crosses to a sideboard, pours a drink
() That's my business -- being sure
There is a knock at the door and
Thornton whirls
Elizabeth throws the bolt
() Hold it
() Relax -- just a little champagne ordered
101-
and gunfire fills the room as: 101-       - high on the shoulder
Thornton
is knocked sprawling
The Deputy moves into the room (followed by three other men) and fires at Pike but misses, as
101-    the screaming women into an adjoining room
The other men pursue
ike as the Deputy bends down and snaps Thornton's wrists together with handcuffs
The sound: of gunfire is heard from the street outside, then two of the men re-enter the room
The Deputy looks up
Get him
The man shakes his head
101- ,       , makes no attempt ato struggle as he
is pulled to his feet and moved out the door
21
102,   , ,   is embarrassed by this betrayal
He's had five years on the r ck pile, Dutch -- and twenty more to u go -- that
can hurt a man
(after a moment) Say -- 've heard it's like the
old times in Argentina
3utch Cassidy down
there making a killing
Bolivia
but it'll be over there too, pretty soon
Those :pining companies will bring down a bunch of hardcases and Butchtll get his
() Every one of us is worth a year of drinking and whoring to any fool that can read a wanted poster and carry a gun
() Deke Thornton isn't just
any fool that can carry a gun and read-a wanted poster
Fo -- but he takes a dim view of 20 more years in the Carcel -- () We can hope he ain't on
our tail -- but don't bet on it
() Tector and  have been stealing since the big depression and we ain't never been caught
This Thornton don't bother us nohe
() don't really give a damn about Deke Thornton
just know that 'd surely like to aet the hell off
this horse
: 107 -     , then
c ntrols it - he is trapped
Finally, he nods and moves away, then stops and turns back, his anger almost beyond any control
Tell me, Mr
Harrigan
-- how does it feel
(as Harrigan looks at him) Getting paid for it
(stepping closer) -Getting paid to sit back and hire your killings with the law's arms around you
How does it feel to be so damned right;
(after a moment, coldly) Good, Mr
Thornton
it feels good
() You dirty son of a bitch
(grinning at him) You have 30 days to get him -- or 30 days to Yuma
You're my Judas Goat, Mr
Thornton
(motioning to the bunkhouse) Use them -- lead them -- get Pike -- then kill them off
When you come back, : want all of them head down over a saddle
(pointing to the bunkhouse ) All of them -a- head down over a- saddle
(as Thornton starts to speak) 30 days
Heturns and walks away whistling
- ( ) 108      at the railroad which marks the border and look out into Mexico
() Mexico lindo
What's so 'lindoA about it
2/12/68 22
- 103 , The interior of the room is tawdry, disorderly and smells bad
The bare walls are decorated with pin-ups from the Police Gazette
The men sit attentively on the bunks
and
foot lockers
, Harrigan is marking beside their names in a large ledger book
After making a 'notation, he looks up
The hard money value of the men killed less my commi
sson amounts to
one hundred and fifty dollars
104
Harrigan holds up four wanted posters
The bounty hunters move closer for a better look
Bishop
Engstrom
Lyle and Tector Gorch
are worth a total of four thousand five hundred dollars -- and you let them all ride outs (after a moment) Any one'of these pelts would not only clear you with the company,
but would mean a bundle of cash to raise hell with
Harrigan stands, crosses to the door
How '
bout a little liquor money for tonight, Mr
Harrigan
There won't be any tonight -- you move after them in ten minutes -- (turning back) Get them -- get Pike and youtre rich
(then)
But if one of you quits on me 'll pay a thousand dollar bonus to the man who kills him
105
Harrigan motions to Thornton, then exits
23
106       the bunkhouse into the deserted railroad yard
Why should  let you go with them
() We've'been over that before, Mr
Harrigan
You could just ride off -- even join him again -- you'd like that, wouldn't you
What  like and what
need are two different things
() 'Listen --  don't want to go back to prison, Mr
Harrigan,
not ever -- but it
has to be my way
All right
need good men: You saw what happened today
() You'll use what you have
() And you'll see it doesn't happen again or 'll see you dead or rotting for -the rest of -- you try your life behind bars to run -- 'll be after you and so will
they
() gave you my word
We'll -see what it's worth -- five minutes
108 Just more of Texas as far as 'm concerned
You have no eyes
And he rises ahead with Pike and'Dutch across the tracks into Mexico
: - '  -  ( ) 109 , then looks up at the eight bounty hunters who are sitting on their horses watching him
(wear4
ly) All rightt
How many of you killed this one
110
knowed  wounded' three -- but wasn't sure about -- (as the others yell in ) Jabali:
111 ,     trots up to
him'
This pelt should clear you up -- take him back to town
and tell Harrigan to get me a list of every Army garrison and payroll schedule on the border
(to
the
others, crossing to his horse) We got another half hour of light and they might be just up ahead counting their money
26
-  ( ) 112
young boy takes their horses while an old
man and his wounded son (the father of the boy) watch
Behind them, an ancient woman pays no attention as she slaps tortillas into shape
Two small children watch, big-eyed
;113
j , a skinny old man in tattered range clothes, crosses to Pike as he unloads his saddle bags
Them others ain't comin'
No
(after a moment) None of 'em
111            that burns near an adobe wall and drops them on a poncho, watches as the others do the same
(joining him again; worried) But  got horses and gear for all them fellers like you said -- They won't need them -- we will
Sykes thinks this over, finally nods
a little and turns away
115        in a half
circle around the poncho
waiting
Angel, the last, drops his saddle bag, then crosses to the wall and drops down to rest
For a long moment the men look down
a-t the pile of saddle bags
About the sharing up
() The sharing up's going to be the some as always
2/12/68 27
115 (whining; pointing to ) Tector and  don
t like the idea of him getting the same as us
He's just starting out and this is our stake for new territory
Pike looks at him silently
He has heard this kind of argument many times in the past and it is obvious he is sick to death of it
Lyle finally looks awa- at his brother; And  figure a 'share to that old man for watching the horses is a share too much
ll&        , opens a saddle bag,
takes out a sack of silver, kneels to slit the bag open
You hear me, Pike
--  said it ain't fair
Pike stands,
flips the knife into the ground, faces the brothers
() If you two boys don't like equal shares why in hell don't you just take it all
They look at him silently
117
aSYKES , a buffalo gun now dangling from one arm
The brothers tense
Angel laughs softly
(almost a whisper) Well,
why don't you answer me, you dapnned yellow
-livered trash
The brothers fide, et
, look at each other
Ah
--' Pike, you know
28
117 (his voice a whip) don't know a damned thing except either lead this bunch or  end it -- right now; No, sir -- we divide just as you say
Pike looks at them a moment, then picks up his knife and alicea open a bag and -turns it upside down and dumps the contents onto the spread-out poncho watching as: 118    01 0 119      ' staring at the pile of worthless steel
Hykes eases up, takes a cautious look
Rings:, Steel rings
(quietly)
Washers
120
More-washers pour out
_ (under his breath) Son of a bitch
121 '
The washers fly in all directions
Lyle whirls on Pike
Washers
we shot our way out of that town for a dollar's worth of steel holes
He kicks into the pile and scatters Washers across the clearing
They set it up: 29
121 (yelling)
Who the hell is 'they
(laughing; cackling) 'They
': by 'they, are just plain and fancy 'they
' 'They
' (dancing around them his high laughter splitting the night) Caught you, didn't they
Tied a tin can to your tail -- didn't they
Lead you in and waltzed you out -- Oh my what a bunch -- big tough ones -- standing around with a handful of holes -- a thumb up your ass and a big grin to pass the time of day with
122   ,     , then falls and rollsaway, still laughing
Tector starts'to follow, Pike stepsbetween them
Railroad men -- Pinkertons -- bounty () Deke Thornton
(in disbelief ) Deke Thornton
-- He was with
them
(as Pike doesn't answer; ) How come you didn't know
123
, as the  of laughter comes from behind
-
(to Tector) Hey, gringo; You take my share
125  ,
30
126     '
serious and a gun is suddenly in his hand covering the big outlaw
Angel smiles again
then pleads mockingly
Don't kill me, gringo
por favor
Take my share of the 'silver' -- but -- don't kill me, please
Tector tenses, almost snarling with rage
,k for it Tector-, looking at Angel's gun, half turns to Pike
: (continuing; softly) Go on, fall apart
Lyle and Tector hesitate, their hands on their guns -- Dutch moves back into the shadows of the firelight, his rifle drifting across Tector
127     replaces his gun
\ Let's walk soft, boys
128 ,          , hesitates
129    , , ,
slaps his gun into his holster -- and moves away, but his hand is never far from the weapon
130       , ,    ,
and hands'it to Dutch
Dutch sits by Sykes, takes a drink, offers the bottle to Tector, Tector hesitates, then hunkers down and drinks
Slowly the others
follow suit
(as the bottle moves around) What's our next move
31, 130 Agua Verde is the closest three days maybe -- then we sell the extra stock -- get some griib and the news and drift back to the border -- maybe a payroll -- maybe abank -- () Maybe that damned railroad: That railroad sire bsi hell ain't getting 4ny easier
a () And we,ain't getting any younger
For a moment, it looks like he'll get a smart answer in return, then: Lyle drinks and lifts the bottle to Angel who
crosses to
the fire,
drinks and passes it to Sykes
() We got to start thinking beyond our guns -- theft days are closin' fast
(without malice) All your fancy planning and talk damn near got us shot to pieces for
some lousy bags of washers
Now this was goin
' to be our last job before we head south
We spent all our time and money getting ready for this
() You spent your time and money running whores in Hondo while  spent my stake setting it up
, flips
it to (or at) Pike who catches it, looks at it, through it, drinks, tosses it back on the pile
2/23/68 32
131 () Looks like 'd have been better off running whores than making plans9 stealing horses and buying uniforms
1
32
Then they break into soft laughter which builds slowly
(after a moment) He --
he was making plans while me and Tector was -- He breaks up and can't continue
(his laughter growing) ,-While you was getting your bell rope pulled by -- (standing; almost choking) By two -- mind you, two -- Hondo whores -- while Pike's dreaming of washers - you're matching two of them -- in tandem And the wild bunch falls apart in laughter -- even Pike is caught, but as he laughs, he knows that they are together again
-  ( ) 133 -
How close you figure we are
Not close enough
They're across the border by now
- Deke - you rode with
Pike -- what kind of a man are we up against
(after a long moment; softly) The best -- () 2/27/68
330 133 ( tD ) He's never got caught
- (after a moment) And he won't be if you boys don't learn your trade
- How was it -- then mm (as Thornton looks at him) You know -- in the old days
only come out here last spring
(after a long moment) You can saddle up or shut up -- take your choice -- (after a long moment) "What will he do
That's what  have to figure
Maybe they'll split up
No -- not 'that
bunch
They'll try again
- - How do you know
' But Thornton doesn't answer
'  - 134          blankets listening to Angel play the guitar
For several moments they are
silent, then: Didn't you run some kind of mine -- in Sonora
Yeah,  helped run a little copper -- nothing for us there except day wages, if it was running now -- which it ain't

Groaning and wincing with pain he shifts on the bedroll
Why in the hell, did you ever quit it
Why in hell are you still goin'
don
't know"any better -- maybe don't want any better, (then, after a moment) Hell,  wouldn't know what to do with 'better' if it poked me
in the eye with a sharp stick
(laughing softly) You -never gave it :a chance9 Pike
() threw away more chances in one year that you will see in your whole
l
ife -- but that don't mean you have
to ' be a damn fool like me
Dutch sits up, rolls and lights a cigarette
You got a halfway hard mouth, partner
What in hell do you want me to-say ,-
Just don't give me, no lectures
They are silent -- finally: : This was going to be my last, too
'm not getting around any better -- like the red-haired lady said to the
white-haired judge -- ' only got so many miles left -in my backside, Your Honor, and  aim to keep it moving while 'm still young enough to feel
what it's there for
' (a
s Dutch -laughs softly) 'd like to make a good score -
then back off 35
135 Back off to what
(as Pike doesn't answer) Any real ideas for a next one
Pike closes his eyes and leans back
Pershing
has
got men spread over the whole border
Everyone of those garrisons is going to be
gptting payroll
That kind of information is kind of
rough to come by
(sitting up) Well --  don't figure it's going to be easy, but it can be done
They'll be waiting for us
wouldn',t have it any other way
: '  - 136-       , only'Thornton and Cof - fer are awake
Thornton sits up,
begins to roll a cigarette
: If he's in old Mex -- do we follow him
- No
Why not
He'll be back
Harrigan ' said something about thirty days -- 2/12/68 36
136 (after a moment) That's what he said, : 137
'  - You must have hurt that railroad pretty bad -- they spent a lot of time and money getting that ambush set up for us
(smiling at the memory) Well,  caught up to them -- two or three times -- There was a man named Harrigan -- He had a certain way of doing things -- So  made him change his ways -- when you do that to a narrow man -- he can't live with it - from then on he's got to change you -- break you -- just to prove he's
right -- there-'s a hell of a lot of people, Dutch -- that just can't stand to be wrong
Pride,  guess guess -- but they can't ever forget it -- that pride that being wrong or learn by it
(after a long moment) And you -- and me --did we learn -- being wrong today
() Well,  surely hope to God we did
138    ,   a cup of coffee, moves away, Where'd you find him
- 2/12/6 8 37
138 (Cont,) (softly) That toothless old wreck was a real gun about twenty years back -- used to run with Thornton and me killed his share and more -- around ----Langery -- Ambushed stages all along that old board highway
,
He had those Swede immigrants so scared theyQd starve rather than go to town and by beans for their kids, and there wasn't a sheriff in
the territory to take issue -- He laughs, drinks the coffee and gags
() And he ain't changed -- only now-he does his killing with a coffee cup
Dutch laughs and then both lean back listeningas: 139

and listening
(softly) - Pike,  wouldn

They are tired and dirty
Near the edge they dismount to lead their horses to the bottom

38
143      -
He falls : Unable to control his slide he collides with/Tector who is next in line
Tector's fall starts a p fain reaction in which all the men slide to the bottom of ttLe hill
145         and land in a giant cloud of
dust
There
is a: profusion of coughing and swearing as the men and-animals struggle to their feet

then picks up a
stone and throws it at
the old man who is hit and falls backward

Leave him alone
(') Hats goin' to get pis killed -- get rid of him
(his anger growing) We don
't get rid of nobody we stick together -- just like it used to be -- when you side aman you stay with him -- (shaking him) If you can't do that you're worse than some animal -- you're finished -- we're finished -- all of us
Tector looks at him silently
148
Placing his foot in the stirrup he stiffly starts to swing on
The leather breaks and
he falls under the animal
Landing on his back, he lets out a loud shriek

Dutch, ready to mount his horse hesitates, but doesn't move to help
150
None of them move forward to help him and he doesn't expect them to
He is visibly miserable as he recovers the reins of his animal and tears off the
broken leather
151
Sykes turns away
() 'Pears 'Brother Pike' needs help, Brother Lyle
Riding with 'Brother Pike' and old man Sykes makes a man wonder if it ain't time to pick up his chips and-find another game
(suddenly yelling at Pike) How in hell are you going to side any- body if you can't get on a horse
152    ,   onto the makeshift stirrup and mounts, concealing his pain, taking a few seconds to gather up the reins and position himself
In the b
g
, Dutch swings onto his horse
Were about two hours from the Santa Caterinas
He turns and rides toward the mountains, the men following
153 That was a mighty fine talk you gave the boys 'bout stickin' to- gether
(as Pike doesn't ) 40
153 (') That Gorch was near killin' me or me him -- () Damned old fool like me's not worth
takin' along
We started together -- we'll end it together
By God, that's the way  see it -- that's the way it's always been with me
Sorry 'bout Deke - never figured him that way, (then, as Pike doesn't answer) Back in
San
Rafael -- my boy how' d
he do
They ride for a while in silence as: Pike
thinks this over, finally:
_ Your boy2 -- Clarence Lee -- my daughter's boy ---not too bright, but a good boy -- He handle higself all right
--  told him -- you do -- just what Mister Bishop says -- Did he conduct hisself well
(after a long moment) He did fine -- () Why didn't you tell me he was your grandson
Well, you had enough on your mind He had to pull his weight just like the rest of us -- just wanted to know he didn't let you down -- run
when things got hot -- (after a moment) No ---he did fine
just fine

They are hot and tired and with the exception of Thornton,
are apprehensive
Coffer pulls up, calls to Thornton: That culvert -- good place for them ----to make an ambush
Go on - ride up and find out
Coffer hesitates, his -ayes wide with fear
Thornton draws his gun, pulls back the hammer
THORNTO1 () Go onl Coffer rides forward

your mouths shut and do what y-ou' re to ld% (turning back, calling) All clear"'-- 155       , -, the shade, the others follow suit
From here on, its Mexico, Mr, Thornton
Do we follow
What's the closest town of any size2 () Agua Verde -- maybe two or three days
(then, pointing in the apposite direction) Juarez -- five -- six days hard riding, What's in Agua Verde
155 Mexicans -- what else
(then quickly, as Thornton turns on him) Headquarters for Huerta regulars
fighting Obregon, led by an old time bandit named Mapache
Thornton thinks about this, then mounts and rides back in the direction they have come from
Don't-we follow
No -- we wait
() How long --a Mr
Thornton
'Twenty-eight days
: ( )-a- '156     under'a broad sky across through a destroyed pueblo filled with silent ghostlike people, four or five crying children, vultures and four men hanging from a tree
In the distance is a high range of mountains
Angel spurs his horse and rides up beside Pike
(to Pike) We're not going to find much down here
, That damned Huerta' s scraped it clean
(in Spanish) May he die the death of a thousand traitors
, ( then) My village is up there
in those mountains
So --
43
156 wish to visit my f amily
can do it and meet you in Agua Verde a day of ter you get there
How
Going this way, you will
have to turn east when you get south of the range
-know the way to cross the mountains
If you know a shorter way
': show us
Angel looks away and is silent for several seconds
Ashamed of having us meet your people
() Yes
;
They don' t know about zny life when  am out of the village
Pike and Dutch both laugh softly, then Pike pulls up at a
watering trough and dismounts as his horse begins to drink
Far as Ifm concerned, you can go, (dismounting, joining ) Far as 'm concerned -- he goes he dontt come back
That sounds right to me
Looks like 'm outvoted
157 () Whatfs the problem
Wants to visit his folks alone -- thinks we're a little rank for his people
14k
157 (as Tector drinks beside his horse) think he can go straight to hell
Probably wants to get a bunch of his _people and waylay us
And take what
Tector thinks this over, doesn't answer
(to Angel) How do' you want it
(after a long moment) invite you to my village -- my home
(then, looking at Tector and Lyle) Any violence -- any disrespect -- and will
kill you
Tector and Lyle look at him without expression for a moment, then:
You got a sister
Yes
would be proud to
make her acquaint- ance -- and
that of your Mama, too
(trying not to laugh) And your Grandmaw too, sonny
Angel looks at them, then mounts, rides toward the mountains -: : -' 158      are riding back past the place where Buck died
The men are sullen,
some almost openly defiant

158 We go back with our tail between our legs Harrigan will have our hides
() They'll be coming back -- and we'll be waiting for them
() We was supposed to go after them -- Thornton reins up, looks at Coffer, who looks quickly away
You have something to say
Coffer instantly lifts his hands in submission and shakes his head
Then, after a moment: They say Freddy Sykes is with them -- you rode with the old man, didn't you, Mr
Thornton -- you and Pike and the old man
But Thornton rides on and doesn't answer
: '  - 159         trying to duplicate the intricacies oA a very complicated cat's cradle demon- strated to them by , the lovely bright-eyed 13 year old sister of Angel
Both men are drinking tequilla, but both are sober, entranced and completely dominated by the girl
All three straighten as: 160 , ' ,  from a nearby fire where she is preparing food with her mother
Miha -- trigame auga
por los frijolesl The girl jumps to her feet, hands both men a bucket (or olla) and leads
them down the bank to the river
(The natural beauty of this location should contrast with other landscapes in the picture
This village and its inhabitants represent a complete and green contrast to the arid world of the wild bunch), CWGE8 46
161 , ' , Angel watches dully,
his eyes mirroring his agony
Pike laughs softly, watching
Hard to believe
Not so hard -- we all dream of being a-child again -- even the worst of us -- perhaps the worst most of all
(looking: at him) You know us, then -- know myself only -- where  have been, what  have done
Like to ride with us, old man
And for a moment, the old man's eyes flash as he watches: 162-     a very small, very mean 16L
mule
All four have been drinking a little and are thoroughly enjoying themselves as is the mule as he pitches and knocks them all sprawling
--  am too old
(almost cursing, indicating ) Too old even to ride beside this ancient gringo
165 Hell, you ain't so old; partner
166  , () And the soldier
who shot my father what was his name
166 They were many -- who shot -- your father resisted like a man and died like a man -- names in this matter have no importance
(to Pike proudly) killed one; (as Pike looks at him) lie --  ran -- Joe --'by God  like you
like a man who tells the truth
() And the leader -- how was he called
(after a moment) Mapache
That is
name enough
The Federal
troops they don
t
protect you -- They were Federal troops; -- commissioned by the traitor Huerta -- seven of the village were killed --
our horses and cattle and corn stolen -- all in the name of Huerta, the killer of our President Francisco
Madero -- In Mexico, Senor - these are the years of sadness
(after a long moment, ) And Teresa
Gone
() They took her
4$
166 No -- she went with them because she wished to
She became the woman of Mapache -- and others -- she went with them laughing -- Drunk with wine and love
Angel, knowing it's true, turns and moves away
Pike looks after him
' 167      ,  , who drinks
To him she was a goddess
To be wor- shipped from afar -- with music and flowers -- a deity to be followed and adored at a dis -nee but Mapache -' knew she was a mango -- ripe and waiting
-So Angel lives with a dream -- while Mapache eats the mango -- Just so - ( ) You have been there -- with the dream
Many times -- and with the mango too
() You just bet he has, Joe
never could carry a candle to you, old timer
(to Pike) And
which do you prefer, the dream or the taste
dream when  sleep -- and eat when 'm hungry

For a moment it
looks as if he will shoot, then Thornton pulls up sharply,
and kicks his
horse to one side as: 175       (  ) stands waiting
Coffer's gun has disappeared

Angel, across
the fire, raises his voice and repeats the question:
You must tell me
- where Map ache
181  ,      , laughing softly to himself, finally turns, his smile fading
Why do you wish to know -- for your father - or the whore
Pike looks up as Angel fights within himself to find an answer, () It doesn't make any difference, kid our business is in Agua Verde For a moment Angel looks like he will explode, then he lifts a bottle of tequi
lla in salute to Pike
As you say, Jefe - to Agua Verde and 'our business
' : - 182   - It      under the shade of several large trees in the main plaza of Agua Verde,
The town itself is dull and sun colored like
the surrounding country
Its most remarkable features are a great deal of soldiers exiting and entering a cantina-like building and a small, aging, ornate, church
51
18 3         and gums at it while the contents run into his beard
18
on the hitching rail and examines the repair, then puts it on his horse
Tector
and Lyle squat in the shade working at making a cat's cradle
Angel is talking quietly to three Mexican peons some distance away
a
185
and joins Pike
All soldiers - not a bounty hunter in sight
We'll go
have a drink, then try and sell the horses
'Who'
s going to buy -- looks to me like
this place has been picked clean
(joining Pike) He's been here; 186       and whinny nervously as an incredible noise is heard off scene
The men snap their heads
around and look at: 187          T1 014N towards the plaza
Inside is the almost ghostlike appearance of a 1912 or 1913 touring car
Four mounted men are riding on each side and a host of small
children are running, screaming, behind it
188         -
The mounted guards
take up positions around the vehicle
The group shows deference to a large man wearing general's braid
- '
Next to him is his second in command,
The third man dressed in white linen is , a German military advisor
With him is , his aide
189      with interest as the men enter a cantina-like building
Then without a word they cross the 52
189 street, drawn to the vehicle
Angel is tense, knowing that his man has arrived
seen one just like this in Waco
Run on steam
No
alcohol:
or gasoline
190
He is anxious to make a
statement and he speaks to him as he walks around the car
Pike
heard about one they got up north that
kin fly; Pike nods sagely
Te
ctor Gorch on the other side of the car hears the remark
() That was a balloon ,you damned old fool
No,
the old man's right
They -got t em now with motors and wings -- cover 60 miles in less than an hour
goin' to use them in the war, they say
(as (ector looks at him astonished) This could cover
30 miles in an hour -- ' cording to the road, of course
That could run a horse right into the ground
Not that easy -- these automobiles can't stand
any rough ground -- or hot sun like a horse ---they're for show mostly

Tector backs off,
hands in the air

) 192     , You're here with us,pardner -- any business you got with the general comes after we finish ours -- and that is selling horses
(after a moment, shrugging) As you wish
He turns away, Pike grabs him, jerks him back, () _ You make
one move to trouble and 'll -kill you -- understand -- we stick together
(before Angel can answer) Angel -- who does this thing belong to
(with due respect) Es el carrazo oficial de

The official carrazo of the Pache Generalisimo 2/32/68 51
192 Let's get some beer and talk to the general about his automobile and our extra horses,,
nice and easy
The men turn and follow him into the cantina
- 193 wearing the uniforms of Huerta,' s counter-revolutionary army and their ladies,, small mariachi band wanders among the
tables
playing folk
songs of the era
In certain areas horses are stabled
-- a blacksmith shop is working, guns are being repaired, knives and bayonets sharpened
,and food is being cooked for the troops by their women
Kids, as
always,
are very evident

which is in' a covered area raised above the others
It is obvious from
his position and respect accorded him that he is the local boss of the area
' The German officer, Mohr, and Ernst, are 'sitting on one side of him
Lieutenant Zamorra is seated on the other side
Herrera is close by

95
of the cantina eyeing the Mexicans with the kind of caution that men who are vastly outnumbered generally show
They sit quietly at a table, ignoring the suspicious looks of the soldiers
196  '  , the General and the Germans watch them with pointed interest
Mohr nudges Mapache and asks who they are

At a nearby table a group of men are throwing dice and laughing loudly
The mariachis are gather- ing around Mapache
Lyle shifts in his chair to look at them

The German
leans close to Zamorra and speaks in Spanish
Do you know these Americans

The German settles back in his
chair and
begins placing a cigarette in a holder

No sir -- we don't
hang nobody or torture them --  hope the people here kick him and the rest of the scum like him right into-their graves

201 , his eyes burning with hatred
We will if it takes a thousand years: Then suddenly, he reacts to the sound of a girl's voice off scene
Vamos:

spins around in his chair watching as: 202    ,   , laughing and giggling, pass-the table
Teresa; He reaches out and grabs the better looking of the two by the arm
() Hey,
boy
you know them cuties
Teresa recognizes him,: then pulls away, : Llamo los otros
No, Vete, ahorita vengo; Pike and Dutch tense as Angel stands and jerks her toward him, - Let her go

Djaste el pueblo; Si deje el pinche pueblo
ahora vivo con el generalisimo; She jerks away from Angel and starts toward the other table
2/27/68 57
203 Angel
watches her go
In the b

,the group of Mariachis playing loudly have moved around Mapache's table
No one there seems
to have seen the action
Take it easy
He places a hand on Angel's shoulder
(to Angel) Que pasa:: His sweetheart -- (still
watching Teresa) "She was my woman and she left the village
, 20L
- and begins kissing his ear
() Sure ain't your woman no more
' " Just look at her licking that, big devil's ear
Angel watches, his rage growing, then stands -- Pike goes for-him

but too late

The others at the table duck for cover, their guns coming out

The others stand, hands an -theirguns, 58
207 Mapache and the'others slowly rise, look at Angel, now realizing who shot the girl
208
He pushes over chairs and shoves people aside as he approaches the group
Zamorra9 the Germans and other members of his retinue are close on his heels
209 up to the'table and quickly scans the group
Angel gets to his knees9 Mapache kicks him in the
head and when Angel
falls back, stamps him several times with his boot,, steps away
One of Mapache's men starts to bash Angel's head with a rifle` butt,
Mapache stops the man with a gesture,
then turns to the others
Qua basura es este
Mapache again
kicks Angel
Why did he try to kill His Excellency
He didn't, he was
after the girl
Mapache is having difficulty understanding
He looks at 'amorra with a puzzled expression
La
muchacha,
Era su novia; The Mexicans immediately respond to Dutch's explanation
Both
amorra and Mapache smile
() His fiancee
He went a little crazy when he saw her with you
Mapache laughs
His ego is pleased with the idea that
he had taken someone's woman
He turns and explains grandly in Spanish to the rest of
the cantina
Mato su vieja porque salio con El Mapache; The soldiers in the cantina laugh and ad lib their response
59
210
as do the Gorch brothers and Sykes
211   them, looking with interest at the
Army 45 pistols that the men are wearing
(
to Pike) Are you men in Agua Verde for business
Thought we might sell a few horses
You must have been associated with the American Army, is that riot so
Tector and Lyle snicker slightly at the remark
Mapache and Zamorra turn, listening carefully to the conversation
The cantina is silent
-No -- were not associated with anyone
see,
1 was curious because of
the equipment which you are carrying
(as they look at him) That pistol is restricted for use'by army personnel
It can't be purchased or even owned
legally
- () Is that so
- - You're surprised at my interest
(then as Pike doesn't answer) Weapons are a specialty of mine

Army
For the last six- months  have been in Mexico helping fight against the revolutionaries

, listening to what is being said
Several of Mapache's men stand around him
Unfortunately your government has chosen to aid the rabble in their so-called struggle for liberty
never heard of any American troops fighting down here
2/12/68 60
212 They are aiding in diplomatic channels
It would be very useful to us if we knew of Americans who did not share their government's naive sentiments
We have vez"y'few sentiments in common with our government
Qua diga
(Xn Spanish) Generalisimo,  think we should ask these gentlemen to have a drink with us
And Pike, understanding
that much Spanish, smiles as we
: - 213 he looks at the body of Teresa being dragged out
Emma and
Rosa'are still very much in evidence
214  ' , , , ,    are all seated at the raised table on the dais
,
Mapache seated at one end is tired and looks half asleep,
In the b

Angel can be seen still on the floor
couple of guards are sitting near him
2,15
on the table
Emma and Rosa crying softly, watch as the dead body of the girl
is dragged through a door at one end of the room
Zamorra is seated
next to the German listening intently, Of all those garrison rail spurs that ofie is the easiest to hit -- But 've got to figure where we can get out with
the wagon
2/12/68 61
216        , looks at Dutch who shrug, doubtfully, (to ZRmorre) Why do you want us to hit a train that's so close to the border
The General could take an army up there and get it
President Huerta is anxious to better relations with the
-- not destroy them
- Arms shipments are generally
kept secret how did you find out about this one
Mapache has a superb intelligence force
(indicating Mohr) Organized under the supervision of my superior officer
(drinking, laughing) Gentlemen
, we are quite well organized and well able to pay $10,000 in gold
(asa they react) If you are not able to do the work we will find someone else, ' (as the others react) -- we can do 'it , , , () But we're going to need special equipment
Our accountant will arrange everything
(smiling at Mapache) Soon you will be the best armed general in Mexico
Mapache raises his glass In a toast, la conquistat

Pike nudges Lyle who raises his glass; the other men follow suit
Mohr smiles and elegantly raises a drink

() With my permission -- You all need a bath
Well,
don't need no bath
Tector and me need'some of them senoritas

Porque no
Zamorra yells to

Por favor, General -- but  need him
"give you someone much better
() choose my own
withyour permission
Zamorra joins Mapache, looks at Pike whose hand is close to his
gun, turns to the General
- Mi jefe, deje que se lo lleven
Mapache replaces his gun
Take him
It is not important to me -- take him
' Then he
looks away as: 221
, and
Lyle and
Tector turn
and react with delight
Hey
Here come our sweeties
(laughing softly) More than enough to go around
(as one girl sits on his lap) And then some
He turns" and beckons to Pike and Dutch who, with Sykes, are carrying Angel out of the saloon, but they ignore him
: - 222 The other bounty hunters are scattered around the car grumbling about the inaction
614
222 And you want to gamble everything this one shipment will be attacked
If they're in Agua Verde that's what - --they'll go for
If
Why not Juarez
Because we would have heard::
(then, patiently) If they are in Agua Verde they will have seen Mapache
() And
who in the hell_is Mapache
killer for Huerta who calls himself a
general
-- with enough guns he can become a power in northern Mexico - my guess is Pike will try and get them f or a him
The train will be guarded by regular troops
Not regulars --
green recruits and not
worth a damn
'll need twenty trained men -- not recruits or this gutter trash you
've given me
You'll get the job done with what you have -- that'p our bargain

Angel has been cleaned up, but looks beaten

The men are all nude and stark white against the mud

As the woman exits, Dutch stands and empties a bucket of water over' himself -and the others
They all gasp with relief
All have towels around their waists and none are completely sober
Pike's leg is heavily scarred and he is in pain
He stands and drinks, gets closer to the fire9 massaging his leg
don't see how you stand it Some day 'm going to build me one of these and live in it
(then to Angel) don't know why  a didn' t just let him kill you
( ) 'm not going to steal guns for that devil to rob and kill my people again
Very 'noble

One load of guns isn't going to stop him from raiding villages
You ought to be thinking about all that money you'll have

Move them a thousand miles away and buy them a ranch --
two -- three, ranches
One -- a very Small ranch
They'll never leave
You see, it's their land -- and no one will, ever drive them away

And
she does, tasting the good wine:; laughing
: - 230         , Both are ready to write Angel off
and forget about the problem
Would you give someone a gun to kill your mother, or your father, or your brother
231,
Pike thinks it over
Both have
another pull on the bottle
Son -- twenty thousand cuts a lot of
family ties
No -- you gringos are no different
have seen how Lyle takes care of his brother
He takes the bottle, drinks, then throws it on the rocks
68
231 ('  ) My people don't have guns so Mapache takes the food out of their mouths and clothes off their backs
With guns my village could fight, If could take guns to my people  would go with you -- but not just for gold, 232
Angel lifts a bucket of water, spills part of it on his head, passes it to Sykes who drinks a little of the water, spits it out, puts the bucket down, pours two bottles of tequilla into it, drinks
again -- smiles, passes it to Angel, who drinks and passes it on

we'd need is for El Mapache to find out we armed some village
Let him find out
' Mr
Bishop -- (as  i12ke looks a t\ him ) You know as well as  there ain't no way of collecting from Mapache 'cept off a lot of dead bodies -- mostly ours, the way he thinks
Pike considers this -- looks at the old man, finally nods
would take guns
if Mapache found out, you would say  stole them, How many cases of rifles did Zamorra say were in that shipment
Twenty
Give him one

232 ' (after a long moment) You can have one case and one case of ammo, You'll give up your share of the gold

Pike is tense in the saddle as the pain in
his leg becomes almost
unbearable
You never told me how you got all tore up like that
236
His face is almost white
; Then he reaches in his saddle bag and pulls out a bottle
He drinks, passes the bottle to Dutch

Pike 'grins a little at what now seems an absurd thought

236C
She is very beautiful and very angry
Buenas no the s mi amor
Aurora swings and catches him full handed across the face9 the groceries scatter on the floor -- Pike bounces off the wall,
looks at her, tries to grin
Your husband due back
2/27/68 71
2360 No, never you are late -- two days late
Pike is startled by this, starts to protest, realizes it is true, tries to make apologies
Aurora turns and stalks off

() You need help
No
He picks up a pan with a hot handle, drops it, spilling hot stew or soup on his foot, hops around cursing looking at the shambles on the stove and on the floor

He takes it, suddenly both are laughing
: - Suddenly Pike embraces her and pulls her to the bed
They begin to make love, then: , a skinny bad mouthed Texan steps into the room, a_double barreled shot gun in his hands ready to fire
and throws herself in front of Pike
Luke fires, the charge killing her as Pike dives out of bed -- jumping for his gun on a nearby table
, the blast catching Pike across the thigh and knee
Pike goes down
Luke crosses to the bed and sits watching him writhing almost bleeding to death on the floor

He wasn't around and  got careless
One night he

Not yet but there-hasn't been
a day or an hour that  haven't thought about getting him - - he didn't want that woman he just
wanted to kill somebody - - well, he killed her - - not me and 'll see him dead for it

-As he swings off, it is obviaeas that he is a little drunk, And you better dry out -- we got no cause to celebrate
Well, we got all them guns,
Pike
And we got a hell of a long way to go 'with a considerable number of people just waiting to take 'em away
337      '
Where's the General supposed to meet us
- Agua Verde -- or before -- and when he does, don't look for no open arms
What about Thornton and them others
Last  saw he was ridin' four sticks of dynamite into the river
Don't count on him stayin' t
ere
- (as Pike looks at him) You know him --
know him he'll be along
(after a long moment) Yeah he'll be along
85
338      , his weariness showing, puts his foot in the stirrup, hesitates
339
140      , the pain twisting his face
For- a long moment no one moves, then: out of his
jumper, hands it to Pike
34- Pike drinks, hands it'to Sykes who drunks, hands it to Angel who drinks,
hands it with a touch of a smile to Tector who hesitates, then half grins himself; drinks and hands it to Lyle
Lyle looks at the bottle, upends it over his mouth, a few drops spill out into his mouth, looks at the bottle in disbelief, tosses it gently aside
(to Pike , simply) It'll be a cold day in hell 'fore - do that again
- And suddenly they are all laughing
Let's move
- And they do, still chuckling-as we

As the machine clicks, he diligently writes the mes- sage
When he is, finished he hands it to , a' small

who` is dressed in a poorly fitting uniform
- Porel generalisimo: Andale
The boy runs out of the building and into the street
343         while they load horses into old boxcars -- also loading are: 2/27/68 86,
344  , who are
part of Mapache's encampment, Most climb'on top
of the box cars where they set up housekeeping
,
building f ires, ' cooking food -- ignoring the sporadic rifle
fire that is beginning to grow in volume as 345 '      probe for the weakness of Mapache's position at the railroad station
Note: Mapache's soldiers show signs of having recently suf- fered a beating and it
is obvious that they are retreating
346 where: 347 '      with field glasses
Beside him are his lieutenants,
one  (), the two Germans and ten or twelve soldiers
One- soldier is hit and falls dying
Mi general -- tenemos que irnos
' Par favor
Mapache ignores them
Juan,arushing'toward Mapache, almost falls as Herrera jerks him to a halt
() Telegrama de San Antonio para su exaelencia, el general
( telegram from San"Antonio for his excellency, the General
) (reaching for the ) Yo to llevo; 347A
, and
understanding his wish to: deliver it personally, steps aside
Juan runs to Mapache, skids to a halt and salutes
Mi General
telegrama de San Antonio
The general returns the salute solemnly and opens the paper, reads it
Los-gringos se robaron el tren; 87, 3
7 (to his companion, ) Was sagt er
Mohr smiles
Mapache is obviously pleased
He looks up at the Germans
The gringos take the guns
Sie haben die Geware gestclen
Ach so;
Gut - (patting Mapache on the shoulder) Sehr gut
mein General
(indicating the approaching Villistas) It is important this news be kept from Villa until the guns are in our hands
(beginning to panic as the firing grows ) We must go: (shouting towards the mountain in ) The next time  will
destroy you (turning to Herrera; in Spanish) Send men immediately to meet the guns on the road to Agua Verde -- take possession and return here
And if the gringos object --
() Kill them
2/12/68 88, 347 (in English) My General -- if they are success ful in this venture possibly they can be useful in others, Mapache thinks this over, turns to Herrera
Nearby another man is hit and falls
(in Spanish) Bring them back with you -- over- come their objections -- reason with them - convince them of our good intentions
in Spanish) And if they still object
(in Spanish) Kill them; 3

Mapache gestures:and the others
quickly jump aboard the train
Mapache is the last, looking, back at the hills with hatred as the Villistas charge and we:
: - 349        trying a paper cone over the front of a pair of
Army binoculars
Pike stands beside him, With the cone adjusted he rolls over and looks out across the valley plain broken with arroyos

or did they really miss it
'd say they missed it

hill that dominates the area
352      hidden in a gully
The other men are lounging underneath it
Pieces of brush are tied behind the rear wheels of the wagon to brush away the trail
Pike and Dutch stand and move back toward the wagon
Only five left -- didn't figure them to come down after us
How much can we be worth
lot depends on how hungry they are

353       and follows Pike
to the wagon
Pike reaches into a box near the seat and removes a piece of fuse
Get that case of explosives near the back
Angel climbs on the wagon
Lyle, hearing him,
crawls out from underneath
His brother also awakens and starts moving around
Sykes, hat
over his eyes, looks up but doesn't move
Whatta you want with the dynamite
Protection
(as they look at ) figure the General will plan to collect without payment, then kill us if we have
any objections
The only reason he might change his mind is if something could happen to these guns
90
353 Angel hands Pike a case of explosives
Now 'm goin' to make it real easy for something to happen
35L        and pries open the lid
He begins setting the sticks on the ground next to the box
Angel gets down and Pike hands
him a coil
of baling wire
Wrap these in pairs and put a fuse cap between them
Angel takes the first two and starts to work on them
355          and climbs on the wagon and begins looking over the
boxes
One is much bigger than the others and of a different shape
356        in the shade of the wagon
Men from my village will meet us tomorrow
Pike looks up, angered
You told them about our trail
don't need to tell them
They know where we are
' How
Angel puts the charge down and looks off at the horizon
This country has many people, but they have learned to live without being seen
(aftera moment) Anyplace where a farmer has a field or a man has sheep in the moun-a- tains
or a boy watches a herd of goats
91
356 - There is a noise off screen and they both look up, 357   , using the heavy-bladed Bowie knives, have pried open the strange shaped box
Lyle, his eyes bright, reaches in
Pike -- take--a look -- 358  ,
-You know how to work one of these things
Pike stands,,then grins a little-and crosses to the wagon
Whatever  don't know, 'm going to learn
: 359          have stopped on a small rise and are looking out over miles of the same type of country
don't know how we lost 'em except maybe in that big valley where the ground was
so hard
There wasn't but one way they could have taken a wagon out of there, this here is it
They didn
't take it out
We, ain't gonna make it too much further without something to eat
2/12/68 92
359 () We didn't lose them --  could point to them now
(as they whirl, looking around) Sit still, dammitl (as they quiet) You think Pike and old Sykes haven't been watching us -- you think if we hadn't
turned off they wouldn't just have sat back and let us walk into it -- six of them hid and all the
guns
and ammunition they need -- you think  wasn't sweating blood they wouldn't try and hide their trail
They look at him silently, almost frightened by his vehemeno e They know what this is all about -- and
what
do  have -- nothin' but you damned egg sucking chicken stealing gutter rats -- with less than 60 rounds of ammunition be- tween you, Listen, Mr
Thornton --  don't have to take any talk like that
don't neither; You'll take it
You don't even have enough sense to keep your damned boots on
(then, quietly) We're after men' -- and  wish to God  was with them
(after a moment) You make any more mistakes and 'm going to ride off and let you die
They are silent looking at the ground -- after a moment, Thornton turns his horse and rides off slowly
They follow
'93 - 360 Showing the wagon moving into a deep arroyo
Pike is now driving

The horses are at a walk
Angel, Dutch'are mounted,
the Goruh brothers are lying on top of the wagon, one on each side of a bulky tarp-covered object
(looking off) Hold up 1
362 - Seeing the wagon, they pull up

Without a word,
Sykes lights his cheroot and Pike
reaches behind him and takes the end of a fuse
Angel and Dutch let their rifles drift over

the heavily loaded wagon
Que bueno -- What bravery you

Pike holds the burning end of the cheroot about an inch from the fuse
370       follows it back to the wagon with

Herrera is solemn as he ponders for a moment, then begins to 'smile
Heyl

So nobody can rob the guns
Nobody:
nunca nadiel (after a moment) Don't you think you should tell your soldiers
The Mexican makes a face as if he doesn't understand

He rises and crosses to Pike, who is sitting near a tree with a rifle across his lap
There is rjo fire, but enough
moonlight to see
My people are here for the guns
Pike looks at him then looks around the camp
Where
Angel smiles, then turns and calls softly
Ignacio
Quien hablas por mi pueblo
Distinctly Indian voices answer from the surrounding tangled undergrowth
Si Angeleit o
Soy Ignacio -a- Ya estamos 1 99
383       , their guns coming out
Lyle in the wagon traverses the machine gun
(to the others) They have come for the guns

then suddenly: 385      is standing near the thicket
Lyle and Sykes turn
386
Then: 387       , [1
As they enter the clearing, they politely remove their hats
Soon there are five, two of them are leading a 'small donkey
Angel crosses to them as they group in the center of the clearing
All carry machetes
(his gun out, still hidden in the shadows) Cut him loose 388  ,   ,     and hand him his weapons with murmured apologies
Tector looks at them, whistles, softly
Never saw anything like it -- never heard Iem, never saw 'em
(to Pike) They apologize and ask you to forgive them for their lack of trust but only by caution do they remain alive -- 100
388 Hell,  forgive them
just want to join 'em
389       quietly
They have mis- trusted people for so long themselve,g they can understand mistrust in others
Freddy Sykes laughs s
oi'tly
390     cross to the wagonE: (climbing on the -wagon) Lievasauna caja de rifles
(Take a case of rifles
) (crossing to him) Don't break that fuse
Angel lifts a crate
won't
Pike looks at Ignacio waiting to take the crate, the man's machete glints in the moonlight
They part of your village
- They are part of the village but not from it -- they are puro indio -- and these mountains belong to them
How long have they been around
What
How long have they been following us
close
391      ,
He turns to Ignacio
Cuanto tiempo nos sigas
2/12/68 101
391 The Indian begins a big explanation in a dialect only Angel understands
Desde ante ayer, cuando salli-eron de la llanura grande
Hey otros
grupo de gringos
ellos se fueron a uno Ranchito
Pike looks at Angel
They've been
with us since we left the big plain
He says those others went to a little
Ranch
'
(joining them) Ever see anyone that could sneak around , like these Angel uncovers a case of munitions and hands it down, They fought-'paches for a thousand years -- that's a sure way to
learn
If they ever get armed and led, this whole country'll go up in smoke
() That it will, son, that it will
392
They work smoothly, each man knowing his job
Angel
climbs down off the wagon, murmurs a farewell to Ignacio and the others, and they disappear into the shadows
: ( ) -  (  ) 393 ,
burst of laughter follows
39LE
are playing with fireworks while they wait for the guns
2/12/68 102
395       ( ' )
One of them waves aloft a shotgun and tells Mapache that it belonged to the man
Mapache, com- pletely absorbed in lighting a Roman candle, answers without turning
Matalo l Pues l
-(Then kill him
) 396 down on the ground and shoot him
As he dies, Mapache lights the Roman candle and shoots it into the air, then at tha soldiers who run for cover, : 397
398         , laugh- ing with pleasure
Mohr and the other-
Germans run to: join him: as does Zamorra and Herrera
Gringo 1
You bring the- guns l (s houting to his men) Ya estan los gringos y las armas l` (The gringos are here with the guns i) (then noticing the wagon is nowhere in sight) (to Zamorra)
Donde estan las arthas
Zamorra looks up at Pike
The guns
Don't worry we got ' em
hidden
As soon as
get 'my share of the gold 'll tell you where four cases are
$2500 worth
() The others are waiting at the wagon and unless  r eturn pretty damn quick they
blow it
'Zamorra smiles, admiring Pike's caution
2/12/68 103
() You fix it pretty damn good
You fool Mel Our accountant will pay you immediately
Zamorra turns and yells to Herrera
Trae la caja
(Bring the strong box
) When you come with all my guns
Quicker  get back, the quicker the next load'll get here
399
Kneeling on the ground he opens it and counts out two small bags of gold, and hands them to Zamorra
Zamorra hands them to Pike
About two
miles up the arroyo
three cases of rifles, one of ammunition, are in the brush behind it
(to Herrera) Trae las armas Herrera runs for his horse
understand you have a machinegun Our contract was 16 cases of rifles and 8 of ammunition -- for $10,000 -- not a machine gun
(then, as Maps the frowns) It is our gift to the General
2/12/68 104
399 Zamorra translates this for Mapache who beams at Pike
with genuine pleasure
(meaning it) You fight con Mapache,h, g macho _dinero -- muchachas bonitas -- la vida dulcet The General wishes you to join him
-- and become rich he respects you
(turning to go) 'll think it over
Esperate
() 'Wait, por favor
In case he cant find them

Zamorra shrugs, Pike grins then turns and rides out

They are in,
a small shallow depression between two hills
High enough to provide a vantage point of the village and the surrounding area--- hidden enough by brush and broken country to provide maximum cover

402      picks glass shards from his clothes, turns to Tector
(after a moment) Pike must have found you
under a rock somewheres
() You going to whip me
Nope - But you better hope  don't get riled enough to start
ggin' you when this is over
You'll never get a chance to dry gulch me, old man

406          , the weapon cradled between them
Zamorra awkwardly feeding a belt into the breech,
finally gets it ready to fire
The two Germans are watching with amusement and disdain
In the b

riding out the gate
It must be mounted on the tripod
Mapache ignores them,

comes alive and the two men holding it are bounced around the area by the wild
reco it

on the trigger

as bullets clatter- through the area-
Finally the two soldiers, 'unable-
to support it, let it drop to the ground

Now like a rivet gun driving bullets into the earth, : =
- 411
Mapache, Zamorra and Herrera watching the Germans mount the
gun on the tripod, turn; then Herrera crosses to his horse and mounts, waiting
We brought the last of it
Mapache gestures
Zamorra hands two bags of coin to Dutch who opens theca -- locks - it's gold
At the head of the
arroyo -- in the wagon
Zamorra speaks to Herrera, who rides off with ten or twelve soldiers
, (turning to go) You can keep the wagon - we'll take the horses
Como no
412  ,      , group of soldiers are beginning to slowly close the massive iron gates
How many cases did you take 'from the train
2/12/68 108
412 Fourteen
We lost two on the trail
(laughing, points at Angel; in Spanish) He stole them
He stole them for his people
The mother of his girl told us
lost the girl, so now she gives me an Angel

No lo matez b
Lo quiero vivo 414     , 445  - into the wrought iron gate
group of soldiers pick him up and drag him back
416      , apparently unconcerned as Angel is brought before Mapache
Supieron ellos
417    ,
No
Yo los robe mientras dormian
(
to Dutch) Ee took two cases when you were asleep
418  , highly pleased at the idea of a Mexican robbing the Americans
(to Angel, in Spanish) Next time be more careful who you shoot -- the mother of your sweetheart became angry when you killed her daughter
-- so she betrayed you -- que fam-ilia, eh 2/12/68 109

He turns and rides off, Angel watching him

some people would betray their mothers for two dollars and one drink
() Unhitch and bring the horses - leave the wagono We got to get him out

But
Sykes can't answer and Dutch rides off
2/12/68 110
- 421 ,      , , better than a mile away, disappears in the distance
The others are
mounted at the bottom of a small ravine below him
(turning to them) Dutch Engstrom
going from the village
$1000 dead or alive
- Bet they sold the guns
,,-Coming out one at a time
i (then, crossing to his horse) We'll get down at the bottom of the wash and see if we can thin the odds a little
He mounts and they ride off
- On a ridge above camp, using binoculars, they look across the badlands below and at the town far in the distance
Well, he had guts -- ( ) We're just lucky he didn't talk
Yeah - he played his string out right to the end
He loved that girl
Her own Mama turning him in -- just like Judas -- 423       , then turns away
Sykes says we got to go after him
2/12/68 111
423 - How in hell
can we do that
They got guns and 200 men
-
Besides, chances are he's dead by now
() _-No wag
no' way at all

424     :
425

26 ,         , trots up the dim trail
toward the hideout
1 27    ,
from the cover of brush-covered ridge some distance away, then: 428         ,  - -- He
jumps at the fiery pain and nearly falls, and for an instant: 429
430 and he catches the reflection in his- eye
Then he has spurred his horse into the brush at the side of the trail
431        as the bandits open fire
432 After a moment the noise of firingareaches them
Dutch takes the glasses, watching
2/12/6-8 112
433      after Sykes, firing
434     and falls forward over the horse's withers
-   - 435     after Sykes
(yelling)
got him --  got him
' Thornton is silent, his face bitter
436    ,
ride after Sykes

Thornton - they got Sykes
He's hit bad
(then, turning away) Daum Deka Thornton to hell
() What
would you do in his place
gave his word
(turning on him, almost yelling) Gave his word to a railroad
It'-9 his word2 That ain
't what counts -- it's who you give it t o l l (as Pike doesn't answer) We kin stay right up here and kick hell out of 'em
Pike turns and
looks over the camp
No water
2/12/68 113
436 Make a run for the border
They'd be after us every step of the way --  know Thornton
No, 'm tired of being hunted -- we go back to Agua Verde and let the General take,
care of those boys
You're'cra-zy:
He'd just as soon kill us as break wind
He's so tickled with the guns he'll be celebrating for a week and happy to do us a favor
Thornton ain't going after us in there
While they're busy pick- ing over Freddy) we'll
' take the back trail off this mountain and head for town
The others look at him silently
Finally: We take our gold
We take one sack to pay our way
Bury the rest -- together
They think this over, then nod
- 437     through the brush into a small clearing, then split up, looking for tracks
The country around them is a maze of rocks and thick mesquite and chaparral
Sykes' horse, blood running
down its flanks, is standing in the clearing,-grazing
,
He can't be far
Lots of blood over here -- then it stops and no tracks
437 We'11 find him
Ten dollars says he's dead by now
It'll take us a day to find him if he is -- if he isn't, he's holding a gun on us right now
438   ,-  coming up
We'll go after the others
Just leaving him here
He's worth money
(softly, bitterly) Jess, you come back tomorrow and watch the buzzards
They'll show you where he is -- you might even get a pair of
boots
Jess thinks this over and grins, then the smile fades
But what if he ain't dead
Your problem
He turns his horse and rides away,
the others following, 439 ,     and brush above them,aslowly lowers his rifle and sags back
His leg is dark with dried blood and he's weak
Around the wound is a crude bandage made from his shirt -- with a tourniquet twisted tightly above it
After a moment, there is a noise and he looks away at: 440       -- of the late afternoon sun, a machete dangling from his hand
- , look over the camp
2/12/68 115
If
didn't bury it,  wouldn't know where to look
= Come on
They ride off
Fora longmoment the clearing is quiet,then: 443

'       in:tha courtyard of the hacienda
fire:is burning and pigs and goats are
being barbecued

446     (who has been badly beaten) down into the courtyard
His hands are tied, and he is, stumbling with fatigue
They tie a long rope from his neck to
the pack saddle of a donkey
One of
the soldiers calls
to Mapache
1ST Yaalisto, mi General
447
and crosses to the area where
he can
view the
whole courtyard
Zamorra and the Germans join him
448
steps to the animal and leads it at a run around the
courtyard, Angel dragging behind it
Mapache and the'others watch without expression
- 4:8A '       dismount and enter, 449
, watching the animal dragging Angel around
Finally
the soldiers
and animal stop, exhausted, in a 2 T1i122G68 116
corner of the yard and the soldiers return to their party atmosphere
Angel lies unmoving
hate to see an animal treated like that
() No more than
do 0 Maybe we- could buy him
They are silent for a long moment
Finally: Just thinking about him is asking for trouble
We,could use another gun
450 ,        around the fire see the men
Los Bandi'dos Gringos
Come here, : 451       the large group of festive Mexicans towards the table
As they walk toward Mapache: 452      by two soldiers and dropped in front of the general
() You come for your friend
Pike and the others stop
a few feet away
want to buy him back
Dutch and the others look at him surprised, () ,'11 pay you his share of the gold
117
452 We kept his share of the gold
Oyen muchachos
'
Quiere comprar el traidor este ; - (Listen boys
He wants to buy this traitor) The soldiers respond with laughter
How much
He don't look
wotth too much
Levantasel Two men jerk Angel to his feet
He is groggy and unre= sponsive
Maybe he won't live too long'
'll give half my share to get him back
( ) No,  don't
need gold
don't sell that one
453    and mumbles something to Zamorra
You've had your fun with him
(cutting him
off) El g3neralisimo is happy with victory
Zamorra grabs a bottle of tequilla ofd' the table and tosses it to Pike
Go and drink
there are women in
the village
But don't be foolish
and change his mood
454     and looks at the table, seething with anger
Then,
suddenly he calms
2/12/68 118
454 Want to go hunting, General
Mapache looks at him confused
(pointing)- Five government men out there - Policio - they want the guns back
Mapache turns to Zamorra who translates
(to Herrera happily, in Spanish) Five gringos want to take our guns Maten los
, mi
General
f
He turns,'barks orders to his men, then mounts and rides out, followed by twenty soldiers
Goodbye,
Thornton
455      crosses
to them
3RD Quieren muchachas
Pike looks at Angel for a moment, then turns away
Why not
The group moves through the celebration out the main gate and into the village beyond
- 456 as his men search the area behind and
below him
Don't look like nobody was ever
here, '
(pointing at horse tracks) Well, they was
Then they look up as: 2/12/68 119
457 Army patrol -- coming this way
Instantly the men mount and ride out
: - 458       , drunk
He lifts a bottle of mescale and takes a drink
459             is sitting looking at a handful of silver in her hand
In one corner a baby whines as the flies bother it
Through an open door leading to another room,
the drunken voices of the Gorch brothers can be heard as they bargain with , a very reluctant prostitute
() You said dos for two
(
) And here's
your dos and one'to grow on 'cause y ou did real well, honey
() Doce -- es mas que dos dace para cada uno
_ 460 and steps into the ad- joining room
461
Tector is on the floor embracing the disheveled woman
Pike watches them, weaving a little: () Let's get Angel
462 TECTORaIMMEDIATELY
and stands as if he has just been given an important order by a commanding offi- cer
Lyle rises more slowly, begins to check the
-loads in his pistols
2/12/68 120
462 Why not
Pike turns and moves through
his room
Tector and Lyle follow
Behind them the
woaian begins her complaints again
- 46
3       ' '     listening
to the plaintive sound of a distant guitar
He
looks up as they come out
() Angel
Yeah
464     ,    with every step
Pike and Dutch pull rifles
or shotguns from their saddle scab- bards as do
Lyle
and-Tector,
then they move up the village street
465 around them that as they pass through the celebrating soldiers, the song and the laughter begin to die
- 466 ,  , ,      of their officers and a handful of women are seated-at a long center table
Food and liquor bottles are spilled every- where, the mariachi band plays for: 466A ,  ,    who is trying to please the general by dancing on the table
At other tables are more officers and perhaps thirty or so enlisted men
The machine gun mounted on its tripod is in a far corner
467     , nearly unconscious, almost unrecog- nizable from
the beating he has taken
2/12/68 121
467 Mapache watches the dancer, then angrily kicks her off the table
She falls heavily to the floor, then Mapache seeing" 468      THROUdH    and s
'and watching
(half angry) Hey, bandidos
What you want
() Hey, this (pointing to Herrera) Dog lost those gringos you wanted - but
we kill 'em tomorrow -- naw
you go on and get out of here; We want Angel; Mapache stares at them without answering
You are very stupid
very stupid
464       , Half dragging him, he steps in front' of the Americans
Around him many of the soldiers are rising
- 470       up Angel from behind, grins at them
You want him
,
He takes a knife and cuts the rope binding
Angel's hands
471
-   ,  with disbelief
472     without a movement, without a sound
() Take him
473     ,  eyes drifting over the Mexicans who are slowly edging forward,some beginning to grin
122
474 ,   at the table pours himself a drink, the clink of the glass against the bottle loud in the silence
Beside him the
Germans rise slowly
Mapache, still holding Angel from behind, leans over his shoulder and whispers in his ear: () Vete, Angelito:
te esperan
los
gringitos
475   , then curiously he takes a step forward
476 477 '   to brighten with hope and he takes another step,
then: 478
and his other hand flashes across the boy's throat as he shoves Angel-into the Americans, the blood splattering them from his severed throat
479      -Angel's falling body, he draws his forty-five automatic and fires twice into Mapache
480
As he : 481
, then the room explodes with gunfire
,482       scramble for cover while drawing
Mohr runs for the machine gun
Ri12fle fire erupts from the courtyard as the soldiers rush forward and die as: 483   '  explodes amongst them
484 ,    rapidity empties his ,45, shoves it in his belt, cocks the lever on the rifle, moving slowly but steadily into the shadowed corners of the room -- kill- ing men, firing, being shot at and hit in return
2/12/68 123
485   his
44, throwing another grenade, is hit, draws his
45, continues firing, moving with Pike, covering his back
486     and die -- more pour in from the courtyard and die caught in the cross fire
487     with the lust of battle charge toward the table, emptying their guns
488
, begins firing
Kills a number of soldiers as it gets away from him
489    with his last two rifle shots and the German dies with his finger locked
on the trigger
490   , cutting a swath of death across the room, killing s
ix soldiers,wzunding Dutch
491 :
as he slips a
now clip in the
45, whirls as: 492   three rounds into Dutch
493     , then a soldier has driven a bayonet through his gut and into the wall
494 ,   , 495'       from all sides and the Gorch brothers, badly wounded,
but still on their feet still are blasting away at them from the middle of the room, then Tector, laughing, picks up
the screaming, terrified Chita and, rushes the crowd, using the woman for a shield
She tosses her head and dies as bullets slam into her soft body, then he is
hit again and goes down on one knee
496  ,
', steps into a doorway
He aims at Tecto'r with a revolver and fires Into him from several feet away
The bullets tear into Tector and he drops the woman and dances out into the room
As he is hit
from all sides, he whirls around, seeing: 2/12/68 12th
497     , he fires his last shot into the man's body
The man plunges forward screaming
Tector stands up straight as bullets pour into him
Finally, he crumples fast and falls, :; 498
,   ,   , standing over Tector is wild-eyed, firing madly into the crowd
bullet splashes into his cheek and he runs
at
the nearest of his attackers, firing, scattering them, killing most, 499  ,    pistol at
the mob
soldier rushes him from behind with a machete and the cross fire of his own men kills him as he swings the weapon into TectorPs back
Tector falls to the floor,
writhing in pain, cursing, pulling down a soldier, strangling him as he dies, 500  ,   into him, then falls - dead before he hits the ground
The soldiers continue to fire into
his body, 501       him against the wall, then falls as bullets cut into him
He rolls, then
crawls under the tables dragging the useless lower half'of his body
Al- thotgh in pain, he is grinning strangely
He removes a car- bine from a dead soldier and
props himself on a bench
Taking careful aim,, he fires and a 'soldier drops screaming-
and
kicking
Methodically he aims and fires again, and again and again, a man dying each time he pulls the trigger
502
,     out of his body, runs firing at five of the soldiers
who are rushing the room -- kills two,
reaches the machine gun, pulls Mohr away from the gun, ,jerks back the bolt
and staggers as a soldier empties his pistol into him from behind, Pike him- self turns and dies, 503    , firing, crippling the soldier, then: 504  ,     , draws his knife and hardly able to move, falls on Dutch -- the weight of the
fall-burying the weapon deep into Dutch's back
Crumpled together, both
men die, - 505        sporadic gunfire as the re- maining soldiers fire into the bodies of the wild bunch
2/12/68 125
505 Then it stops
mortally
wounded man suddenly screams in agony and writhes on the floor and dies
Another, pistol in hand, rises, staggers to the gateway, teeters for a moment, then falls, firing blindly into the
dust
Somewhere outside the wall, a cur yelps and runs away into the night, : -
- 505A    led by Thornton, ride through
It appears deserted, _ - 506         wrapped in
black robosas are burning candles and moving
among the dead bodies
that spill out of the large room of the hacienda and into the yard
It is a scene of carnage, blood now black in
the sun, a million flies and the walls lined with waiting vultures
There is no sign of soldiers anywhere
few of the bodies have been dragged into the courtyard
Most, including Pike, Dutch and the others, including Mapache, lie where they fell
507   ,   , , their horses snorting nervously at the smell of blood and the stench of death
At-the end of the courtyard where five corpses are heaped in a small Di13, a lone vulture stands
patiently near them
As the bounty hunters approach and the-
bird labors reluctantly into flight, the men dismount
Thornton, looking in through the broken wall, turns away
Coffer and
enter, whistle softly
It's them
You'd have
one hell of a time proving that
a week from now, in Texas
-
We could try
Hell, a pelt's a pelt, it don't matter what condition it's in
Picked clean -- not a gun on 'em
,
Thornton walks slowly among the bodies
2/12/68 126
507 '() This boy here's got some gold in his teeth
Let me see your knife, Coffer
(crossing to Thornton) em
_Hey, Thornton, should we load up
(walking away) Suit yourself, We going to wait here for Jess or meet him on the way
But Thornton doesn't answer; reaching his horse, he mounts and
rides away
Coffer and
,
and Ross look after him
(pointing to the bird on the walk) If Jess is counting on buzzards to
lead him to
old Sykes, he's got a long wait -- we got 'em all
They laugh and go to work
-   - 508     , ties his horse, sits down, his back against the wall
Except for a dog and two
silent women, the village appears deserted
Thornton rolls a cigarette, begins to smoke it
waiting
: ' 509 ,
-ride out leading four pack animals, each carrying a body
Thornton looks up, he doesn't move
You ain't comin'
2/12/68 127
509 Thornton shakes his head
- () Maybe we better wait here for Jess, ----
No we 9
11 pick him up on the way -- -want to-get out
of this goddamned place -- anyways these boys will start going ripe on us by tomorrow --
we got to' move -- (then; to Thornton) You sure you ain't coming
Coffer shrugs and drinking out ofa half-full tequi
lla bottle, rides off, followed by the others who ignore Thornton as completely as he does them, TOi12 -   - 510  '
Then from the
distance come three slow-paced rifle shots -- Thornton sits up -- waits, then there is a fourth -- Thornton settles back, : -   - 511
the light goes a cold wind kicks dust across the empty street of the village
Thornton stands, looking off at: 512
,  , ,    , ;
and a handful of Angells compadres sit watching him
They are leading the bounty hunters' horses, the sacks of gold are tied to Sykes' saddle
Didn't expect to find you here, Deke
Why
not --  sent 9 em
back -- that's all  said 'd do
128
512 They didn't et far -- () You the one that shot me
Don't know -- does
it make any difference
(after a moment) reckon not
() What are;
your plans
Drift around down here -- try and
stay out of jail -- Well,, come along -- we got some work to do -- (riding away) It ain't like it used to be,
but it's better than nothing
513
,   , unties his horse, then mounts and follows
