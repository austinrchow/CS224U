Speed, trajectory and tactical readouts flash
- The pulse lasers are still hammering the ravaged hull
Two sinister  , their lasers locked onto the Cargo Ship, away as they  overhead
The nuclear core of the Cargo Ship overloads, the craft finally  in a storm of fire

The harness spins, the pilot coming clearly into view
Handsome, intense, reckless eyes
Sino-Jordanian Raiders
They're claiming the cargo ship violated their air-space
- Another pilot ( ) commands an identical craft, towards the assault craft just below West's
This cold war's heating up
Where did they come from
-' Hell
And we're going to send them back screaming
West activates his targeting computer
Last one to kill a bad guy buys the beer
-
The fleeing Attack Ship jogs in and out of the crosshairs on West's holographic array
West fires
- The Attack Ship  straight up, dodging West's laser
-' West closes on the fleeing craft, as Jeb engages the other Attack Ship, lasers  in the b

, visible through the transparent surface of the bubble glass under West's feet
What's that sound
must be the fat lady warming up
- The fleeing Attack Ship loops in mid-space, reversing direction, heading straight towards West's Bubble Fighter
game of chicken
-' West doesn't flinch
Bears down,  madly, the two space ships heading straight for each other
That's right
Come on, come on, you wanna play,  wanna play
- The two ships are  towards each other, locked in collision vectors, lasers  wildly

The Attack Ship flashes, captured in the targeting hatchmarks
The display expands into a tactical grid
Target lock

The lights are dimming
The curtain's coming down
Sing you fat, old bag, sing
West hits the firing stud
- West's pulse lasers converge on the Attack Ship barely meters ahead, the  craft  directly before him

Then he spins his chair towards Mars, begins working the controls
This is Eagle One

Now
The canal streaked face of the Mars is all Jeb can see
He grabs his throttle, engages his navigational thrusters and pulls

That is a direct order
Acknowledge
West slams a switch, deactivating his radio
Never liked that station, anyway

West going up
Don angles the throttle
- Don's ship, sandwiched between the surface of Mars and Jeb's fighter, angles up and, like a cue ball hitting it's target, Knocks Jeb's ship spinning toward the safety of space beyond
West's ship actually scrapes the surface of the planet, sending up a plume of Martian dust
-' () Does this mean we're going steady
West pulls his throttle all the way back

The rescue craft converge on Jeb's ship as Don heads for base
: 2: Mission Objectives ----------------------------- -
Sallow field
() a heroic, stringy anthem
Imagine an end to world hunger
What if ample food and clean drinking water were the birthright of all our planet's children
- dashing hero, wind in his hair
This man, professor John Robinson, inventor of the faster than light hyperdrive can make that timeless dream a reality
-Airbrushed faces of a perfect family
John Robinson and his family have been extensively trained to take a ten year journey across the galaxy in the world's most advanced spacecraft, The Jupiter
- towering launch dome glints in the morning sun
From a distant world, the Robinsons, Will bring back a miracle
- satellite photo of a planet
Closer on continental patches, enhanced to show deposits of a diamond like powder
Dimondium can turn even worthless sand to fertile soil
Earth  be a garden
What kind of - future can our children look forward to
- Sun dappled, swaying wheat
() Music crescendos
V0 future without hunger
future without suffering
Heaven on Earth
- Coke bottle hurling towards the stars
V0 This mission sponsored by the  Army and the Coca-Cola corporation

Spying through the open slats of his biding place into
:- - Basic twenty first century modern
stands, talking with a  who in less than happy
He hacked our main power grid to run his experiment
The school was in chaos
We didn't even have lights
The room lights suddenly dim
The Principal flickers, revealed as a holograph, her head now sitting on Schwartzenegger body
Maureen , then realizes the Principal has no idea her image is being distorted
Maureen begins moving about the room, surreptitiously glancing behind couches, into cabinets
() This is no laughing matter, Mrs
Robinson
Will is terribly gifted
His little time machines, though pure fancy, are the products of a truly brilliant mind
The Principal's body has become Twiggy's
Now that of an ape
Maureen pulls open a closet
Will sits inside
Grins
The changing shape of education
No more monkey business
Will shrugs, adjusts his deck
The Principal returns to normal
The boy is starved for attention
Was there no way his father could have attended the science fair
- - Probably Austin and Dallas too
Texas has become a giant urban sprawl spreading into Mexico and beyond
Immense industrial air purifiers hang in a dark, wet sky
-  - giant dome topped pedestal towers ever the skyline
- - - stands before a large viewscreen facing the throng of
He's a little uncomfortable with all the media attention
This is Once we have landed on Alpha Prime our on board robot will begin construction of a hypergate
a hi-tech orbital gate is highlighted and expanded
By then, technicians here on Earth will have completed a companion hypergate in our planet's orbit
an image of an orbital gate now under construction
Once both gates are complete, ships will be able to pass instantaneously between them
The Jupiter can bring the Dimondium back to Earth without the ten year delay of a return trip
Why can't you just use the Jupiter's hyperengine to zap straight to Alpha Prime
As you know, hyperspace exists beneath normal space
If you try to enter hyperspace without a gate a graphic spaceship appears randomly in the corner of a turning schematic of the galaxy
Your exit vector is random
There's no telling where you'd come out
Professor, how is Captain Daniels recovering from the flu
Will we still be able to pilot the mission
John glances to the doorway where a uniformed  stands
Ladies and Gentlemen, you came to get a look at the Jupiter One
Don't you think you've waited long enough
John hits a button and the room darkens
giant monitor reveals
- giant saucer sits connected to its launch pad by loading belts, steaming fuel tubes and spindled gantries
() Professor, how does your family feel about leaving the Earth behind
() They couldn't be more excited
3: Goodbye
------------------- - - suburban colonial, the launch dome towering in the distance
() This whole mission sucks
-  - (14) furious, turns, looks downstairs at Maureen
Don't want to stay home for dinner
want to see my friends for the last time
She takes a beat, blinking away the tears
Lifts her wrist and turns on a video camera watch
She begins down the hall
-
Penny's face in the monitor screen
On the eve before she is torn from her friends, kidnapped, hurled into deep space against her will, what thoughts fill the mind of the young Space Captive
-' - Penny enters a strewn, boy' a world
Will is trying to select items to place in a single packing canister marked:
Will there be boys on Alpha Centuri
What will  wear
When we wake up in ten years the video journals of Penny Robinson, Space Captive, will be devoured by millions
will be world famous
You on the other hand, will have been totally forgotten
Penny shows the camera her arm, covered by strings of ribbons
The Space Captive has decided to wear ribbons of support for fellow sufferers as she is dragged into deep space, green for the ecological issues, white for human rights You'd probably gag if  described the secondary infections loss of circulation can cause
Penny seems about to speak, instead just smiles, goes to his bed and pulls off the sheets, begins knotting them together
What are you grinning at
just found an upside to this mission
The thought of jettisoning your body into deep space
Penny knots the sheets into a rope, ties it to the bed-post
Will lifts several palm-sized gold-plated stars
Each reads: 1st prize
Dad says Don't bring them
Like anything  do matters to him
He never showed, huh
Maybe if  had actually broken the time barrier he would have paid attention
Don't let him get to you, kiddo
He just gets busy with work is all
Penny tosses the rope out the window, prepares to climb
So, that's a no to family dinner
Let's see, do  spend my last night on Earth watching Mom and Dad pretend not to be fighting again or get in ten years of making-out at the mall
you do the math
Mom's gonna go thermal
What's she gonna do
Ground me
4: Major West --------------------- - - John and the General walk the metal passageway
We're lucky they didn't press on Daniels, condition
figured a chance to look at the ship would keep the dogs at bay
Ben, 'm worried about jamming in a replacement pilot at the last second
My family' a on this mission
need someone who's more than just spit and polish
've got your man
He just doesn't know it yet
The General palms an access panel
door hisses open to reveal
- -  - figure stands staring silently out the window
Don West
He offers a salute
By his eyes, West is clearly agitated
At ease, Major
Sir, why was  pulled off active duty
salvaged my craft and Jeb's
'll fight a court martial, General
Do you know Professor Robinson
By reputation only
(to John) Your father's battle strategies were required reading at the Academy
How much do you know about the Jupiter Mission, Major
The Jupiter is fully automated
The pilot flies the ship out of the solar system and lands on Alpha Prime
It's a baby sitting job, sir
Major, you are aware Earth's resources are severely limited
Every schoolchild knows our recycling technologies will save the environment
Sending a family across the galaxy is a publicity stunt to sell soda to people of all ages
What  am about to tell you is classified
Every schoolchild has been lied to
The recycling technologies have failed
In less than two decades Earth will be unable to support human life
We spun the ad campaign to give the mission a friendly face, keep people from panicking in the streets
We partnered with Coke because the 900 billion this mission cost would have bankrupted the government
The SinoJordanian Alliance knows the truth as well as we do
They hope to reach Alpha Prime first - And if they do, guarantee you, they will not share the Dimondium with Western Demons like us
our crops will wither
We will be left to die
Captain Daniels doesn't have the flu, does he sir
Daniels was murdered in his apartment last night
The flu story is a cover we fed the press
Dan was a good pilot
good man
Your rescue stunt over Mars was foolhardy
Explain yourself, Major
had a friend in trouble
You endangered a one billion dollar spacecraft, disobeyed a direct order because of a friend
Yes sir
And 'd do it again
Sir
He'll do
(stepping forward) Congratulations Major, you're the new pilot of the Jupiter mission
5: Dr
Smith -------------------- -- Sun beats hard on a  who stands on a windswept sand dune, talking to a smartly dressed
Perhaps a brief jaunt down memory lane is required
was contracted to provide Daniels, apartment code
My work is done
They found a replacement pilot, the mission is going ahead on schedule
How tragic
For you
We require more direct intervention
see
Well, that will cost you
And, 'm afraid my price has just become astronomical
() a
The man reaches forward and presses a button
The businessman, the desert disappear, only holographs
Room lights
Lights come up to reveal
- - The man turns, revealing a face as clever an his eyes are evil
This is
He walks to the door, palms a panel, and the portal hiss open
Control hasn't received the results of your final pre-flight exams, Doctor Smith
The Doctor moves to a circular overhead light board around which are displayed the faces of the crew of the Jupiter craft
Removes the micro-files, hands them to the technician
The Robinsons are checked out at one hundred percent
They are in perfect condition and ready to fly
He smiles, so sweet you can barely see the malevolence behind it
Wish them good luck for me
6: Welcome Aboard
-------------------------- - - Three small figures walk through a gantry towards the ship
() The mission protocols are simple
Professor Robinson is in command unless you encounter a military emergency
In that case, Major West, you will assume command
The figures have come to the saucer entry-port
() Welcome aboard, Major
-  - Don, John, and the General
Don's eyes widen
West looks like somebody sprung for the full extras package on this baby
Hi-tech heaven
Two pilots, chairs face a giant windscreen
Don walks to the consoles that stretch toward the back walls
Some of this technology might be new to you
'll be happy to explain
(off the com) Cold fusion drive (off the size consoles) Rambler-Krey Life Sciences stations
Don strides to a pedestal in the center of the bridge
Flicks a switch and a holographic Jupiter craft appears on the launch pad
Holographic navigational interface
Don points to a row of man-sized glass cylinders on the back wall
Cryosleep array
Fully monitored
He approaches the blast doors that lead off the back of the bridge
Sick bay, remote Ops, engineering and living quarters are below decks
Hyperengine should be in here
Don hits a wall panel which opens to reveal an immense
If you have to baby sit, it's not such a bad nursery, wouldn't you agree, Major
Just then the  rises from the lower decks
On its circular platform stands a  in a lab coat
She walks to the General
The cryosleep systems are running at ninety five percent
Doctor Smith approved the specs- Doctor Smith is base physician
am responsible once this ship is in flight
These tubes have to keep the crew in suspended animation for ten years
They will be perfect or this ship will not launch
Is that clear
Absolutely, Doctor
Judy, 'd like you to meet Major West
He's taking Mike's place
He's heavier than Mike
We'll have to re-calibrate
'd be more than happy to discuss my dimensions perhaps over dinner
West - 've read about you
Something of a war hero, aren't you
(preening ) Well, yes, actually
Those who can't think, fight
(a freezing smile) Well, nice to have met you
She heads toward the readouts
West turns to John
That's one cold fish 'd love to thaw
(turning) 'm not going to make it home for dinner, Dad
West turns to John
Dad
It's going to be a long flight
- - Lights burn in the windows
- - - John  to find the remains of an elegant dinner on the table, candles never lit, food never eaten
John crosses to a small scale model sitting on the table
Around it hangs another gold plated 1st prize star
He smiles
() He won first prize again
He practically brought down his entire school
But he won first prize
Maureen descends the steps in a bathrobe
Joins John
non-working prototype for his time machine
Sharp stuff for a midget
Maureen is silent
'm sorry about dinner
had to work late
The new pilot-
What you had to do was prioritize your family over the mission Maureen
This mission is about our family
So we can stay together The perfect nuclear family
The most stable social unit, ideally suited for the isolation of a long journey into space
It's all just , John
You're never home
Judy is becoming a ghost just like you
Penny can't see past her own navel and Will has to black out-his school, just to get his father's attention
The perfect nuclear family in ruin
John stares at his wife
Then he reaches forward, touches her hair
know, Maureen
'm scared too
beat
Then she moves to him
And he holds her close
- -' - John stands in the yellow wedge of hall light
He touches something hanging around his own neck
pair of metal dog tags
Will lies in his bed, eyes closed
Asleep
beat
John turns, heading out into the hall
- - The bedroom lights go out, a normal home against the backdrop of the launch dome towering in the distance
- - - The Jupiter one stands amidst loading gantries, final supplies rolling into the ship on automated conveyer belts and lifts
7: Primary Directives ----------------------------- stand checking off supplies on a lightpad
Anything else
#2 'm showing a late shipment from Mission Medical
Smith's authorization
Here it is now
on a canister that reads:  : Do Not Open, as it passes on the loading belt
as it winds along the conveyer, up a gantry towards the Jupiter One
- Smith sits crouched inside, cleaning his nails
- - giant robot stands attached to its service bay
Still
Silent
slides open and a shadowy infiltrator emerges, his face visible in the dim service light
Smith
Smith approaches the docked Robot, places a small keypad device on the Robot's dormant  panel
Smith activates the device
You'll forgive me if  forgo the kiss, my sleeping behemoth
Smith hits a switch on the panel and the Robot's system indicators light into life
Smith types several keys on the keypad
But the time has come to awake
Robot is on-line
Reviewing primary directives
One, preserve the Robinson Family
Two, Maintain ship systems
Three Spare me the chatter
Smith taps the keypad
The Robot is silenced
Smith types again
What noble charges my steely centurion
Sadly  fear you have far more dire deeds in store for you
Smith completes his re-programming
Hits a switch
Robot is on-line
Reviewing primary directives
Two hours into mission destroy Robinson family
Destroy all systems
Smith smiles
Removes the re-programming module
Now that's more like it
Farewell my tin-plated pal
Give my regards to oblivion
Smith climbs into a chute marked
- Smith begins crawling down the chute
His tiny reprogramming module Smith activates a tiny, built in com-link
From the mic, the familiar visage of the Businessman is projected into the crawlspace over Smith's face
told you never to call me here
see you have completed your mission on schedule Good work, Doctor
And goodbye
The Businessman smiles
-
Puzzled
Suddenly the tiny module in his hand , the flesh on his palm smoking as Smith is engulfed in an electrical charge
He goes out, his body perfectly still
8: Launch
------------------ - - The giant dome shines in the early sun
-   John and Maureen face will and Penny who stand now in their freezing tubes
All  wear silver flight suits
Maureen moves Penny's hair from in front of her face
Don't, mom
Vogue says this will be the style in ten years
Will she wake up less annoying
Does he have to wake up at all
Alright you two, enough
Maureen kisses her children
John moves to will who reaches to shake at the same moment John tries to hug him
beat
Then John tries to a shake as Will goes for the hug
total miss
Will backs into his tube
You get a  in paternal expression, Professor
But an  for effort
John kisses his wife, already in her tube
You always get an  in that
Don't let me shatter this unbridled display of affection, but we are running behind
(entering his tube) Major, she's all yours
'll try to give you a smooth ride
Judy walks the row, checking their bio-monitors
Enters her tube
Mission control this is Dr
Robinson
We are in the green
() Roger, Doctor, you are go to initiate cryostasis
Don walks to Judy's tube
One question, Doctor
in there room in these tubes for two
Barely enough for you and your ego, Major
Drive carefully
(touches her com-link) initializing cryostasis tubes
The tubes rotate closed around the Robinsons
Suddenly each crew member is surrounded by a shimmering blue glow, brightening like a star and then subsiding
All stand fixed in suspended animation
Don stares at the family a beat
He goes to the main console
Straps himself in
Mission Control, this is Jupiter One
The Robinsons are asleep
We are ready to fly

West reaches for a glowing panel
We're outta here
The atomic power source fires a focused , shooting the Jupiter through cloud and sky towards the black edge of space

Don presses a button and two giant blast shields close over the Jupiter Two's main viewscreen
Houston, diverting all spacecraft controls to the main computer
(off mic) Eight years of flight training
He walks to the center of the bridge and activates the navigational holograph, images forming in mid-air over the pedestal
-
The Jupiter Two is visible, backed by the planets of our solar system
Navigational holographics on line
(off mic) Fifty combat missions
Don touches buttons and a highlight indicates the ship's trajectory past mercury, around the Sun in a slingshot and into space beyond
Course confirmed for slingshot exit of the solar system
(off mic) Just so  can take the family camper on an interstellar picnic
Don walks to the freezing tubes
He zips up his silver flight suit
Ten world series

West climbs into his tube
- Sleep well, old friend
- Don hits a switch and his tube closes
beat then he is engulfed by the blue glow, frozen in space
The tubes rise into the craft
- The ship flies on into the endless night
: 9: Destroy
------------------- - -  - Smith lies still
He starts from a nightmare into
-a nightmare - - Smith scrambles out of the chute, stares at his hand, the impression of the overloaded communicator seared into his palm
He spins around disoriented
Stumbles to a closed view screen and hits a stud
The blast shield opens

The bridge doors open and the ambient lights come on
The Robot rolls onto the bridge, faces the cryosleep array
He extends his arms, an electrical charge arcing between his claws
Robinson Family, destroy
He fires, a blast of electricity hitting the cryosleep controls
()  sound as the tubes begin to descend, electricity sparking across the sleeping Robinsons
() Mechanical moron
You'll kill us all
Smith, wrench in hand, rushes the Robot, is again hurled across the room
The Robot turns towards the navigational computer
- Fully lit
All the monitors are manned by sleepy Techies
Noah , taking a coffee from Annie without breaking stride
,  flash everywhere
This mission's over
Wake them up
The Techies begins working the controls
No response, sir
'm sorry
- The Robot is facing the navigational holograph in the center of the bridge
The electricity arcs between his claws once again
Operating systems, Destroy
Smith is slumped against the bulkhead
He shakes off his fall in time to see the Robot fire at the navigational array, the holograph disappearing in the flames of the exploding pedestal
- The ship begins to veer off course, falling towards the sun
The Robot is rolling toward the com

Smith stumbles toward their control station
Begins typing madly
Wake up, damn you
can't stop this infernal contraption on my own

Hurry up
The Robot  at the main Com, controls  everywhere
The freezing tubes begin to open, the Robot spinning to face them
John blinks to life first
Emerges, ducking a  of electrical energy from the Robot, hitting the deck and rolling
Maureen
The children
Maureen grabs Will and Penny, pulls them down just as the Robot blows away their tubes
John pulls a laser pistol from a wall mount
Disengage safety
Voiceprint confirmed
The Robot spins towards John,  an electrical charge - John dodges at the last instant, the grazing blast burning his silvery suit, singeing his side, sending into the wall, his gun flying
Dad
Will ducks under his mother's arm, scrambles across the bridge
Will, wait
The Robot  at the scrambling boy but misses, Will disappearing down the gunny hatch leading to the lower decks
leaps from his tube atop the Robot's back, trying to grab the Robot's power source
The mechanical monster electrifies his shell, sending the Major flying
The Robot turns to Penny and Maureen
Extends his arms toward them
Electricity arcing between his claws
The two are done for
Maureen puts her hand over Penny's eyes
Look away, baby
The Robot is about to fire
Suddenly the Robot freezes, his claws deactivate, his power lights go to stand-by and he stands immobile
Will stands in the b

Robot
Return to your docking bay and power down
Command accepted
The Robot turns and begins heading for the elevator
All watch in amazement
Will grins, a familiar mischievous gleam in his eyes

We're flying blind
Penny in working ever Smith, bandaging his head
She runs stimulator under his nose
Smith begins to stir,
've got life signs
(wincing) Boy, somebody could use a breath mint
West turns, spots Smith for the first time
(to John) Try the emergency back-ups
Don moves to the fallen figure, lifts him up against the bulkhead
Smith, what the hell- was making a last minute check
someone hit me from behind
Don almost buys it
Then he notices Smith's hand, grabs it
-
The reprogramming module's distinctive, foreign signature seared into his flesh
Sino-Jordanian technology
You're a Goddamned spy
(realizing) You did this
Don slams him against the bulkhead, begins dragging him towards the airlock
The pilot hits a switch
The inner hatch opens
Stop
What are you doing
Dropping some extra weight
() Help, somebody
Please
Maureen stands at Judy's freezing tube
The young doctor's cryofield is sparking on and off
The thawing engine in broken
can't get her out
She's dying
Smith uses the distraction to palm-slam Don in the chin, knocking him backwards
Don staggers, goes again for Smith
Touch me and the girl dies
Don freezes in his tracks
Your mission physician is indisposed
can save her life
But only if you spare mine
Don't deal with dead men
Kill me,  kill the girl
How much is your revenge worth, Major
will, of course, need your word as an officer that you will let me live
Don's decision is lighting fast
Help her
've got a com signal
Suddenly the radio  into life
Is Mission Control
Do you read
Jupiter Two this is Emergency power's on line

The blast shields part to reveal a giant fiery orb in their path
They are heading directly for the sun
Uh-oh
- Noah stands over the Com
The room is a madhouse
Give me a telemetry projection
Noah looks up at the main monitor
The graphic of the Jupiter Two is heading towards the graphic of the sun
- John and Don stand over the Com
() You're way off course
We show you in the sun's gravitational pull
How long do we have

will need Dr
Robinson's portable gurney
believe it is stored in- 'm on it
Penny races off
Smith begins working the controls to Judy's freezing tube
We trusted you
(sinking in) You tried to kill us all
Existence offers us nothing if not the opportunity for an endless series of betrayals
(off her stunned expression) There's a world behind the world, Professor Robinson
Lie once, cheat twice and everything becomes clear
Do not mistake my deception for a character flaw
It is philosophical choice, a profound understanding of the universe
It is a way of life
You're a monster
Perhaps
But  am also the only one who can save your daughter's life
Penny reappears, a case in hand
She presses a button and the case unfolds into a hovering, gyroscopicaly-leveled gurney
Where's Will
He's futzing with that Robot
Alright, Penny dear,  need you to short the power on my command
Does he have to call me dear
Professor, if you will assist me in lowering the body
Smith hands Penny a wrench
Penny, dear
Now
Maureen nods
Penny  the wrench into the power circuit
The freezing field  and deactivates, the tube swinging open

Flatline
She's dying
Smith and Maureen lower her onto the gurney
Sickbay
Move
Penny, Maureen and Smith rush the gurney out the blast doors towards Sickbay just as the ship tilts madly

The sun is growing ever larger
Unable to re-route to Mercury
The sun's pull is too strong
(a beat) Noah,  need options
- Major West we are unable to provide contingencies
(a beat) 'm sorry, Don

- - Penny, Smith and Maureen have transferred Judy onto a hi-tech scanning-bed
hovering holographic schematic of Judy's physiognomy appears over her, descends onto her body
No cardio-pulmonary or respiratory functions
Body temp at 68 Fahrenheit
Get her flight suit off
Penny unzips the silver material as Smith works the console, highlighting her holographic heart
Clear
The holographic image of her heart beats once, then is still
Again
Clear
The lights flicker on the bio-console, the holograph winks out
Power's down
We're losing her
10: Initiate Hyperdrive ------------------------------- - and John man the Com
The sun is a raging fireball dead ahead
've re-routed all secondary systems to the main drive
She won't budge
Shortest baby sitting mission 've ever done
My family's not going die in space

Outer hull breach in 30 seconds
- Smith begins pumping Judy's chest by hand
Come on, child
Fight
Put a little heart in it
Smith steps back, begins precise, staccato blows to Judy's chest
The life

(hit) may be (hit) my own
Smith stops, presses his ear to her chest - Takes her pulse
Smiles
Judy
Baby
beat
Then Judy opens her eyes, manages a weak smile
You should try to look less worried
It has a tendency to spook the patients
(to Smith) Thank you
Smith holds her gaze, his eyes almost snake-like
You are a good woman, Maureen
Any man could see that
hope  have proven the well-being of your family is of great importance to me
Perhaps, if you convinced your husband to trust me
Maureen stares at him
beat
She pulls a laser from the wall
Points it at his forehead
Stabilize her, Smith
Because you only breathe as long as she does
- The ship is shaking in the mighty pull of the sun
Don is struggling to keep the ship stable
Heat seal breach in 20 seconds
There's got to be some way to get through this
stares at him
That's it
What's it
We can't get away from the sun
So we have to go through it
The hyperdrive - Engage the hyperdrive without a gate, we could be thrown anywhere in the galaxy Anywhere but here
- We're getting resident radiation distortions from the space craft
She must be breaking up
Let me see those numbers, Annie
The Techie hands him a sheet
Noah looks for a beat
Son of a bitch
He's powering up the hyperdrive
- The saucer is elongating slightly, changing its shape as it prepares to enter hyperspace
- Will scrambles onto the bridge, heads towards John who is working the main control panel
Hyperengines coming on line
Warning
Heat shield breach
The sun covers the entire windscreen, a furious landscape of flame
Hyperdrive at 100 percent
Major, you have the Com
Zero to 20 million miles a second in under a minute
Let's see what this baby can do
John takes Will's hand as West engages the hyperdrive
West, John and Will, are hurled backwards from the sudden acceleration, sticking to the walls and ceiling respectively
- Maureen and Penny watch as Smith swaddles Judy in thermal blanket
Suddenly, Maureen, Penny, and Smith fly against the walls
Judy is held in place by the gurney straps
- The graphic of the space craft is beginning to flicker as it merges with the graphic of the sun
We can't keep a fix on her, sir
She's starting to disappear
Noah stares at the screen
Godspeed
- The Jupiter Two flies into the mighty ball of the sun
And just as it reaches the tallest of the gaseous mountains, the ship becomes translucent, falling through the orb, elongating and then vanishing in a sudden star of hyperspace
- The sky breaks apart giving way to a starfield
- Quiet
Empty
Suddenly space distorts and, in a sudden flash, a ship appears, hurling into the darkness
The Jupiter Two
The Jupiter Two comes to rest at the edge of an alien, twin starred solar system, near a giant crimson planet
11: Lost in Space ------------------------- - - Maureen kneels before Penny and Will, making sure they're okay
Smith stands silently in the b
g
Judy's gurney is empty
John , his face wrought with fatherly concern
Is everyone okay
All in one piece
Although Major West has the most puzzling definition of a smooth ride
Judy
Where's Judy
Just then Judy emerges through a door, zipping up her flight suit
Boy either  cut down on the coffee or sew in a flap
It's hell getting in and out of this thing
Are you- Vitals are normal
Pulse and respiration seem to be- Baby, are you okay
'm fine Daddy really
John holds her close, spared a father's worst fear
Will every disaster be an excuse for familial sentiment
Please tell me now so  may gather up a liberal supply of space sickness bags
Don turns towards Smith
Maureen steps between them
What happened, John
Where are we
- - Don in at the navigational holograph, patching sparking wires
The rest of the crew emerge onto the bridge
You had me worried, Doc
Nice to see you thawed
Smart maneuver with the hyper-drive
fighter who thinks, what do you know
You're just in time for the show
Don makes a connection
The pedestal powers up, a holograph of the Jupiter Two appearing over its surface
Computer, map our current location
-
The area around the Jupiter Two is now filled with a holographic representation of the alien solar system
See anything familiar
Don just shakes his head
Searching for recognizable constellations
(a beat) Unable to locate
This computer has star maps of the entire known galaxy
We're lost, aren't we
Judy wraps her arm around her sister
What the hell is that
-
The nearest planet is starting to glow
Suddenly a distortion field begins to emanate from the alien world
The edges of space seem to sear away, leaving a glowing portal
Any effect on the ship
No
-
All the planets and constellations beyond the portal appear to be in different places
(off the navigational hologram) All the planets have moved
And where did that come from
12: The Proteus ----------------------- - Breaking the inner edge of the portal, a long silver space needle catches the light from the dual suns
- The crew man their stations
Only Will is absent as they the ship maneuver around the portal
-
As they, move behind the portal it seems to disappear, showing only the blackness of space
No ship beyond
It's gone
No
Go back in front of it
- As the ship moves back in front of the portal, the hole in space is visible again, the giant probe ship revealed once more within
It's a hole in space
doorway
doorway to where
If we want to reach that ship, we're going to have to find out
- The Jupiter Two flies through the pulsing hole in space
- The giant, silver ship looms in the windscreen
No apparent effects on the ship
'm hailing on all frequencies
No response
There are some markings on the starboard side
Can you throw some light on her
Don't know if the exterior spots are working
- There we go
-
Powerful spotlights hit the ship
-
And really surprised
If this in all a dream, why can't there be more girls
-
Essentially a needle covered with metal scallops
On its hull, under the legend , an American flag
've never seen a design like this
what are those scales on her hull
How could Earth launch a ship this massive and neither of us know about it
It just doesn't make sense
These scanners are damaged, 'm getting inconsistent life signs but they may be sensor ghosts
Maybe her computer's still up
'm trying standard remote access codes
- docking ring on the giant ship comes to life, giant floods coming to life, the docking aperture rotating open
What do you know
- The Jupiter Two heads towards the giant ship
- Can you give me some light on the secondary docking ring
smaller docking ring is illuminated on the viewscreen
What do you make of that
Attached to the starboard docking ring is another, smaller craft
Its snaking anthropomorphic lines are not of human design
Boys,  think we're having a close encounter
- The Jupiter moves into the docking ring of the giant ship
- () a giant  as the Jupiter Two docks with the probe
() Crush
The Robot in rolling in through the doorway, arms waving wildly before him
Crush
Kill
Destroy
Don and John are up fast
But the Robot just rolls to a stop
Will steps from behind the automaton, his hacker's deck in his hand
He pulls a tiny mic from his deck
Lifts it to his lips
Crush
Kill
Destroy
Crush
Kill
Destroy
Will points to several jury-rigged modifications
hacked into his , bypassed his main operating system and accessed his sub-routines
He's basically running on remote control
All stare at him
Penny finally speaks
Show off
- - - Penny stands guard, a rifle in her hand, talking into her recorder
And so the Space Captive finds herself helping the Robinsons by guarding the traitor
And she finds- Penny's  trails off
Stares out the porthole
Endless space
She finds that out here, in the dark and cold, she's scared, and she's kind of glad they're all together
Just then Don approaches, a silver bundle under his arm
Identify yourself, soldier
West, Major, United Space Force, requesting permission to see the prisoner
Penny steps aside
Proceed Major West
Don smiles, winks at her, going through the door
Ouch
Could he be cuter
don't think so
-' Actually a med-lab
Smith turns to face Don an he
These quarters are totally unacceptable
demand- Don tosses his bundle on the seat
silver flight suit
We're going to check out the probe ship
Maybe we can figure out how they got here
And how to get home
Ta-ta
Have a wonderful trip
You're coming with us
Out of the question
'm a doctor not a space explorer
You and- But Don is in his face in a heartbeat
What you are is a murderous saboteur and  am not leaving you on this ship so you can do more harm than you've already caused
absolutely refuse- (closer) Give me an excuse to kill you
Please
Smith stares at him a beat
Then he smiles, looks to the flight suit
Silver always was my color
- - Will stands in front of the Robot, polishing a blast mark clean
When boarding a mysterious spacecraft, it always pays to look your best
John enters, removes a gun from the weapons locker
Deactivate safety
Voiceprint confirmed
Rifle is active
-
small light goes from red to green
You did a good job up there son
You saved us all
Thanks
An awkward silence hangs between them
know  haven't around much these days
That we haven't had time to- () Professor, we're ready
John looks at his boy Will in silent
Will, you're the most important thing in the world to me
hope one day you'll be able to see that
With that, John walks out
Will stares after him
Faces the Robot
Take care of my dad, okay Robot
Will works his remote, sending the Robot towards the bridge
- long dark corridor
Slowly the ambient lights come up
door opens to reveal Smith, John, Don, Judy and the Robot, stepping out of the docking chamber, the airlock closing in the b
g
The air is stale
Old
That's the smell of ghosts
Don walks to a computer panel set into the wall
Begins typing
'm interfacing with the on board computer
Odd
Not working
No, it's just,  don't know, too fast
Most of the systems are down
The Robot rolls deeper into the alien ship
The others follow
More lights flicker into life, illuminating the long corridor ahead
Motion sensors are still working
() What do you make of this
Smith, John and Judy join Don at one of the bulkhead walls
Some kind of hieroglyphics
-
series of hieroglyphics are scrawled on the hull wall
The sketches tell a story
-
The alien craft docks with the giant ship
-- trio of inhuman bipedal stick figures enter the giant ship
-
The shape of a sun or a disc, from which juts many legs
This final hieroglyph is circled in a clotted red substance
Don touches the stain
13: Exploration ----------------------- If  didn't know better 'd say this is blood
know an omen when  see one suggest a hasty retreat
Just imagine we're retreating in the opposite direction
Now, move it
Don shoves Smith forward with the butt of his laser rifle, the group heading deeper into the quiet ship
- Will watches through the Robot's , toggling to move the automaton forward
readout marked  flashes
Will turns up a volume control
() the sound of a slow, steady
Dad, do you
- Hear something
The Robot turns, begins heading further down the corridor
() now can be heard by all
Like the drip, drip, drip of blood
You really need to shut up
(pointing) Here
shows a jagged hole, covered with some kind of viscous membrane, leading to the dark of a service tunnel above
The membrane steadily onto the floor below
That material appears biological
Nothing good will come of this
What makes you such an expert
Trust me, Major
Evil knows evil
Let's find the bridge
Maybe we can get some answers
They head off
on the dripping membrane
- Maureen is at the main sensor console working an instrument panel
Penny is hanging upside down in a harness overhead, using a laser welder on a giant mass of exposed ceiling circuitry
Try it now, Mom
Maureen throws a switch
The panel lights up, then goes dead
Damn
-- The boarding party stand at the end of the corridor
Don presses a wall panel
The giant doors hiss open to
- Immense
Empty
And battle torn
Sections of the controls have been blown away
Blast scoring mars the walls
What the hell happened in here
Some kind of fire fight
Look at this technology
've seen some of this before
On the drawing boards
Smith has moved off slightly, wandered over to a
Within, a row of docked Robots, larger and sleeker then ours
John and Don are powering up the Com, console lights coming on
Can you bring up the Captain's log
The data has degraded
'm going try and gather any fragments  can
There isn't much, but
here we go
-
Fills with snow
Then a figure can be seen
It's Jab
But his hair is grey
Jeb
The hyperspace tracker seems to be functioning
(static) No sign of the Jupiter Two
(static) Have exceeded our mission timetable by two
(static) 'm not willing to give up
Don would keep looking for me
That's it
The rest of the data is totally corrupted
, Smith frees a power pack from one of the robots
Slips it into the sleeve cuff of his field suit
This doesn't make sense
How could they launch a rescue mission for us when we've only been lost a day
Judy stands by the life sciences panel
've got something here
turning holograph appears over the console panel
degraded image of a trembling, viscous pouch
Tiny shapes move within
They brought it up from the planet's surface
It's seems to be some sort of egg sack
Don notices Smith's standing in the storage alcove
Smith, step away from there
Happy to oblige, Major
Although don't think it's me you should be worrying about
But rather this
In the corner of the ceiling, another membrane covered hole
- Will is at his station, watching Don and John via the Robot's
'm detecting motion
Behind you
- towering  shoots past the open doorway
After it
Move
(to the Robot) Bring Smith
- - Don races down the corridor
The walls are matted with flowering plants
Vines twist into a carpet covering the metallic floor
, about the size of a small dog, shoots out from behind a bulkhead, disappearing into the lush greenery
Don pushes forward through the ever deepening brush until he comes to a door
plaque reads
He races inside
- jungle
John and Judy arrive behind Don
This explains where all the plants came from
Growth like this would take decades
The Robot arrives through the lab door, carrying Smith in one claw
Unhand me, you mechanical moron
Don's eyes fix behind Smith's head
Don't move
am sick of your terrorism
If you are going to kill me, be done with it
Otherwise  will insist you treat me with the respect and- (like steel) said don't move
Smith is suddenly silent
Don's hand shoots out, just missing Smith's head, disappearing into the brush behind him, leaves flying, as-he pulls from its hiding place a small creature
About the size of a large stuffed bear, spiny skin going from leaf color to red, shaped like a rhesus monkey but covered with the scales of a tiny dragon and bright yellow cat's eyes
- Will is watching through the Robot's eyes
Neat
- - West stares down at the creature in his hand, now a calmer and more friendly blue
Judy approaches
Well, who do we have here
As the beast struggles in Don's hand it changes color, chameleon like, trying to hide
No luck
Don holds fast
Easy there, little buddy
No one's going to hurt you
How do you know it won't hurt us
Don has begun stroking the creature's head
After a beat, the small beast begins to  and emit small  sounds
Looks like you've made a friend
You have a good bedside manner, Major
'm going to let that one go
How charming
Doctor Dolittle of outer space
Where do you think it came from
It's possible this is one of the creatures represented in the hieroglyphs we saw on the wall
It must have been their ship attached to the other docking ring
The beast has moved onto Don's shoulder, is now clutching there, burying its tiny face into his neck
Don can't help but
It looks like a child
If so, my dear Major, what do you suppose happened to its parents
Let's get back to the bridge
As they leave, a dark shape skitters across the ceiling in the background
Ominous
Unseen
14: Giant Spiders
-------------------------- - Penny is still hanging overhead
think 've got it
The sensor console comes back to life, displays lighting, status lights going green
Maureen stares at the monitor
That's strange
-
Revealed in the sensor scan, the scallops pulse with ambient heat
Penny lands beside her
Those scales are giving off heat
- - John is at the Com
've tapped into the internal sensor array
Besides us, this ship is totally deserted
ghost ship
Don is sitting with the tiny creature
He pulls a ration pack from his pocket
Turns it over in his hand
And the flavor of the day is
banana/beef
Who thinks up these combinations
The creature stares at him intently as he tears open the foil lip, sucks a bit
Judy can't help but smile at him
Good
Major West,  highly recommend you never breed
That by the way is my medical opinion
Don glares at him, hands the tiny creature the pouch
The creature looks at it, emits a small , takes a tentative suck
Its eyes widen in delight as it begins to suck the ration pack
Little thing was hungry
Good Lord, who will - spare us the tyranny of the sentimental
() a distant, high pitched
Do you hear something
Suddenly the creature begins to , leaping on Smith's back, clinging to his neck for dear life
Get this infernal creature off me
The  is growing louder
it seems to be coming from above
-
There, in the corner, the membrane covering the hole seems to be trembling
This can't be good
You have a remarkably keen sense of the obvious
- Maureen stands with Penny at the main sensor station
John, get the hell out of there
The silver disks on the hull of the probe ship are beginning to move, rising to stand now on spindraled legs
- Heads and legs emerging, the disks reveal themselves to be armor plated spiders
The monsters find viscous holes in the outer hull and push through, vanishing into the probe ship
- () a
The Jupiter Two shakes, as if struck
Give me an external view
Penny works the console
Spiders are leaping from the probe onto the Jupiter Two
- - The lizard monkey's  has reached new heights of hysteria shape begins to push through the viscous bole in the ceiling
What bursts in is a monster out of nightmare
Nearly half the size of a human, shiny metallic body from which wet, spider-like limbs extend
fang covered vAw opens below ravenous, green eyes
Don draws his laser and , but the blast only reflects off the metallic surface of its torso, forcing the creature to retract its limbs and eyes, hiding within its protective shell
Evacuate
Now
The team races for the door as several more spiders drop through the hole in the ceiling, landing in the bridge and scampering fast towards our fleeing heros
- - The boarding party race down the corridor
The spiders are bounding after them, using walls, floor, and ceiling with equal facility
- Will is madly working his keyboard, controlling the fleeing Robot
This joy stick is too slow
Activate holographic interface
holographic robot appears on the bridge
Will steps inside, the image now moving with his body
He spins, facing backwards, firing
- The Robot is holding up the rear, its torso swiveled backwards so it can retreat and  simultaneously
The Robot's plasma  have more effect than-the lasers, blowing the spiders into tiny pieces of inhuman flesh and metal
But more monsters are pouring through the holes in the corridor ceiling, some giving chasing, others swarming injured comrades
Judy watches as several spiders devour their fallen brethren
They eat their wounded
Our heroes race to a nexus, corridors leading off in all directions
Spiders are dropping from the ceiling around them
Which way
- -
graphic map flashes within the holograph
Turn left
- -CORRIdOR Now right
The spiders are swarming, closing fast
Got to seal the bulkhead
The door control is at the other and of the corridor
The fire sensor
Judy pulls her gun, , hitting a ceiling sensor at the end of the corridor
Blast doors , sealing out most of the spiders
-
Impressed
-
Metal teeth begin tearing through the steel
Our group has made it to the door to the docking bay
They rush in, the Robot coming through the open doorway last and holding there
- - Don activates the airlock to the Jupiter, the batch slowly opening
The Robot stands in the doorway to the docking bay,  at the spiders as they come down the hall, blowing them away
More pour through the now rending blast doors
There are just too many, rolling towards them now like a single, shifting mass of death
Open, damn you
It's cycling a vacuum check
There is no way to speed up the protocols
Fools
warned you not to come aboard this cursed craft
You've killed us
You've killed us all
Judy throws him, hard, into the wall
Shut up
Now that's a bedside manner
The first spiders reach the Robot, leaping onto its metal bull
- Maureen and Penny are at the Com, powering up the engines
Will is within the holograph, fighting off the spiders
Charge
- - The Robot's shell electrifies, the spiders recoiling
The airlock has opened enough for our heroes to duck inside
Will, get the Robot in here
The Robot stands in the open portal, covered by spiders, their fangs shredding his hull, his electrical charge beginning to
- Will is throwing off the monsters, Extending the Robot's antenna spikes and scanner dishes to skewer spiders that are squeezing by
can't move him without letting the spiders into the ship
- - Leave him behind
- 'm sorry, Robot
- - spider pushes past the Robot, head slipping around his metallic body, bent on reaching the airlock and the crew within
- - Seal it
Now
Don hits a switch just as a spider breaks free, rushing towards the dropping airlock door
Smith recoils from the swiping talon
' -
tiny rand and beneath, a razor thin incision
drops, the spider's arm, still twitching, severed inside the airlock
- The inner airlock door Opens
The crew tumble in
Get us out of here
Don is already powering up the ship's engines as Smith tries separating himself from the tiny lizard monkey
Get this cloying gargoyle off of me
He throws the beast hard across the bridge
The creature hits the wall, , begins racing across consoles
John has strapped in beside Don
Get me an external view
shows the hull of the Jupiter Two
More spiders are leaping onto the ship, attaching themselves to the hull
Prepare to disengage
skitters up the back of Penny's chair, over her head, getting tangled in her hair before jumping into her lap
Get it off me
Get it off
Penny in frantically wiping the hair from her face
The tiny creature on her lap begins a perfect imitation of Penny
Don releases the docking ring, glances at the Monitor
The hull of the ship is now entirely covered with spiders
Initiating separation

Then Penny hugs the tiny beast
It's okay
Everything's going to be alright
But she sounds anything but sure
We're clear
Everybody hang on
- The Jupiter Two's engines , peeling into the endless night
- ()  sound
think those things were using the probe ship as a way to trap food
That  s probably what happened to the monkey's parents
We were going to be desert
But what happened to the crew
Nothing good
We're not out of the woods yet
The hull of the Jupiter Two is covered with the giant spiders, their teeth cutting through the outer hull
Let's see how these monsters like a hundred thousand volts
- The hull glows with electricity
The spiders fly off into space, their limbs and heads retracting
And the crowd goes wild
Recall your nightmares from childhood, Major
Monsters are rarely so easily dissuaded
() a
Then another
third
-The spiders shoot webs from their bellies, attaching to the Jupiter, land on the hull again, re-extending their limbs, starting to burrow once more
Persistent bastards
Can you hit them again
Every time  electrify the hull, 'm draining our systems
Once or twice more and we're going to be dead in space
fate  fear may be inevitable one way or another
Maureen emerges from the airlock holding the spider's severed limb in metal tongs
Carries it to her life sciences analyzer
That's the same expression you had when my mother came to stay with us

More and more spider are spiraling from the probe ship, all heading toward the Jupiter Two
There are thousands of those things Maureen is working the
They may be attracted to heat and light
Don begins typing
With the right command codes,  can light up the probe ship from here
-
More spiders are hitting the bull
Damn
No response
Command codes are sequenced
Try the next series
But they won't work until the next fleet of ships are built
That's at least two years away
Just do it
Don begins entering command codes
The mighty probe ship begins to power up, engines glowing red as they begin their initial
How did you know
Think about it, Don
The ships's advanced technology
Your friend looking old
What if that ship is from our future
Warning
Outer hull has been compromised

Spiders are eating through the outer hull
It's not working
Can you get the fusion drive on line
- ' fusion drives
few of the spiders divert back toward the probe ship
But most still head for the Jupiter

Get us out of here
Fast
Don looks at John a beat, then he begins working the controls
What are you doing
Never leave an enemy stronghold intact
One of your father's first rules of engagement
Don hits a button
On the remote control console a readout begins to flash
The message is simple:  -
Don, stop
That's a direct order
We might need to salvage- This is a military emergency
That means 'm in command
Don, no
'm ordering you- hate spiders
Don hits a button
The panel light flashes:
Hang on, it  a gonna be a bumpy ride
Don angles the ship away, punching the thrusters as the probe ship's engines begins to glow
- The probe ship's nuclear core overloads
The engines begin to glow, venting plasma and then  like a nascent star
spreads across space, vaporizing the spiders
hits the Jupiter Two
- The ship is buffeted by the shock wave
can't hold her
- The ship is knocked into the atmosphere of the giant planet below
- Don is struggling to keep control
We're going down
- The ship is hurling toward the planet's cloud obscured surface
- The windscreen is filled with a
Can't get the stabilizers on line
Pull up
Pull up
Really
No kidding
Thanks
-
The storm clouds suddenly Don banks the controls
- The ship tilts on its side, passing between two snowy peaks, still plunging towards the planet's wintry surface below
- 'm reading a clearing ahead
'm going to try and make it
-' The Jupiter Two  over a carpet of snowy treetops, the canopy of leaves bursting into flames from the friction of the hull
- The surface is coming up fast
Got to slow us down
-' The Jupiter Two hits the surf ace of the water and skips, once twice, three times across the alien sea
- Brace for impact
The ship  into a crater miles long,  through rock and vegetation, finally coming to rest near one of the crater walls
- Still
Automatic fire systems spray gas everywhere
only the dimmest emergency lights cast any glow
Everybody, by the numbers
Maureen straightens, rubs her neck
Life Sciences, still breathing
Mission medical, 'm alive
Me too
Robotics,  mean
Video Mechanics, okay
'm alive, Major West's poor excuse for piloting skills not withstanding
Let's take a look
Don hits a switch, the windshield de-icing, becoming clear
don't think we're in Kansas anymore
Before them lies the crater, snow covered floor spreading out towards a distant horizon stained red by two hanging crimson suns
15: Follow Orders
-------------------------- - - The moonless sky is filled with an utterly alien starfield
The Jupiter Two sits near the wall of the crater, its tiny lights fighting the otherworldly darkness
() You violated a direct order
- Cavernous
John and Don stand by the giant drive engines
Don is holding a cylinder containing a mixture of power chips, some glowing with radioactive fire, others dull and charred as coal
About half the core material is burned out
We'll never generate enough power to break orbit
told you not to blow that ship's reactors and you did it anyway
Come on, Professor, give it a rest was technically still in command
Don't hand me that
'm commander of this mission
Look, no offense, but you're an egghead with an honorary rank
No one ever intended you to handle combat situations
You're spouting some nonsense about- time travel while those spiders posed a continuing threat
made a judgement call and if  have to 'll make it again
Hell, you of all people should understand that
If your father were here- My father is not here
My father is dead, killed in one of his combat missions you so admire
My family is on this ship And you're going to follow my orders
Whether you agree with them or not
Is that clear, Major
Don's face is right up in John's
Save the speeches
like you
But the fate of the Earth is at stake here
'm going to do whatever think it takes to ensure the success of this mission
With or without your help
Is that clear, Professor
The two are too close to do anything but kiss or fight
Kissing seems less than likely
() Am  interrupting something
Maureen stands in the doorway
No
Really
think you two should go ahead and slug it out
mean, here we are stranded on an alien world and you boys want to get into a pissing contest
So please, go for it
'll have Judy down here in a heartbeat to declare you both unfit and 'll take over this mission
Now  don't want to hear another word from you two until you can play nice
Is that clear
Maureen- Listen- Not another word
(a beat) Better
Now if you've finished hosing down the decks with testosterone, suggest you come with me
may have found a way to get us off this planet
Maureen turns on her heal and
The two men exchange a look
Wow
Tell me about it
They head after her
18: Danger Will
(Out of Sequence in screenplay
) ------------------------ :-' Will sits working over his hacker's deck
()
Can you hear me
Robot
Will tunes the deck
More
Then
Systems error
Robot unable to register neural net outputs
Unable to locate motor controls
Unable- Calm down
Your body was destroyed in the conflict with the space spiders
Do you remember
Affirmative
But  downloaded your neural net
Robot tried to destroy the Robinson family
Why would Will Robinson save Robot's personality
Your actions do not compute
guess sometimes friendship means acting with your heart, not your head
Logic error
Friendship does not compute
Don't worry, Robot
Im going to build you a new body
promise
Will turns to face a pile of pirated components from various par of the ship
He lifts a circular bubble of diodes
Smiles
Mom always said  should try to make new friends
15: Follow Orders
* return to -------------------------- - Maureen stands at her life sciences station with John and Don
The atmosphere here can sustain human life
've located 500 Rads radioactive material a mile north
That's at least what we'd need to get the core functioning again
John looks out the viewscreen at the alien night
Turns to Don
We'll set off at daybreak
it'll be safer
Those are my orders, Major
agree with your recommendation, Professor
DZtente is a beautiful thing
- Judy examines the lizard monkey
Penny strokes the tiny creature, producing a string of
What's the diagnosis, Doc
Is it cowboy or ballerina on Halloween
Right now she's a girl
But  think your little pal here is from a self-replicating species
At different stages of life she, or he, probably alternates sexes
Imagine the savings on dating outfits alone
The tiny creature has begun playing with an aural scanner
Can  keep her
Penny, you've never taken care of a thing in your life besides yourself
Please
She's all alone
promise 'll look after her
She needs me
The moment you misplace her, or forget to feed her, we leave her on this planet where she can live in the wild
'm not kidding Penny
And with that Judy
Penny sits, stroking the tiny creature
We're both a long way from home, aren't we little one
The creature makes a tiny
That's what we'll call you
Blip
Blip reaches out, touches a green ribbon around Penny's wrist
You like that
Penny takes the ribbon off, ties it around Blip's wrist
Blip looks up, eyes glowing
Penny caresses the tiny creature's cheek
Nice girl
Pretty girl
Nice
The creature reaches up, touches Penny's cheek
Her tiny tongue trying to imitate Penny's words of comfort
Judy stands, just out of sight, watching her sister, smiling
16: Alien World ----------------------- - - Don shoves an indignant Smith into the room, adjusts a newly installed security panel in the wall
Remove that lock this instant shall not be caged like some animal (lethal) gave my word 'd let you live never said for how long
These quarters will be fine
Smith stares at him a beat
Tell me, Major West
Are you really confident in Robinson's ability to guide us
If  were set free,  would support your right to command
With minimal force, we could take this ship and assure this mission continues under your leadership
My God Smith, you're right
How could  have been so blind
'll just run and get you a gun so we can hijack the ship
Okay
Sarcasm is the recourse of a weak mind
'm hiding the pain
Really
And with that West leaves
Smith tries the door
Locked
Then, from one cuff of his field suit, be removes the control belt he stole from the probe ship
assure you, Major West
Your pain has just begun
Smith moves about the room, lifting small bits of metal, creating an impromptu set of tools with which to alter the control bolt
on '
Beneath the rend in his suit, the tiny tear in his flesh is now covered with tiny, alien scales
-- Judy sits in one of the command chairs over a the remains of a meal, sipping water, staring out into the alien night
() Star light, star bright
million strange stars and only one wish
wish we were home
Don comes and sits in the co-pilot's chair beside her
never thought a sky could look so alien
We really are lost
When the first sailors circled the globe and saw a brand new sky, they thought they had sailed off the edge of the earth
But they were really just around the corner
(smiles) We just billow our sails and let the wind blow us home, Is that it Major
So those sailors found familiar shapes in the stars to make the skies more friendly, to help them find their way
Don turns on a monitor below the viewscreen
-
It shows the star-field above
He lifts a light-tipped stylus
That's how constellations were born
Don begins to draw on the screen, connecting the stars like dots in a children's book
Slowly, a familiar porcine face takes form
Porky the wise and mighty Pig
Judy
She takes the stylus
Begins to draw
The great bucktoothed Bunny
Bugs
Don smiles
Judy can't help but smile back
Their faces are close
So, my quarters or yours
Excuse me
We are the only single man and woman of consenting age in the galaxy
How much more of a set up do you need
So you figure just dispense with the pleasantries, get down to business
You have a way with words, Doctor
(provocative) Right here
On this console
Don moves his face to hers, only a breath apart
Here would be fine
Judy smiles sweetly
-
Lips parting
Suddenly water begins to pour down over his head
His eyes open wide
Judy holds her empty glass in hand
Next time, fly slower
She rises, walks off, leaving Don mopping his brow
- & ' Maureen sits on the edge of her bed brushing her hair as John activates the automated security systems
What was  thinking, bringing us all out here into space
The world needed saving
You were the right man for the job
But solving the world's problems doesn't leave much time for the people you love, does it
Did you get any time with Will
Now he's decided he can rebuild the robot
Wants to show me his designs
've got too much to do- Funny creatures, men
You try so hard not to be your fathers, end up making the same mistakes
Will adores you
He needs your attention
We can't get off this planet much less back on course
don't have time to
John, just listen to him
it doesn't matter what he's saying
Just listen
Sometimes, at least in the eyes of their fathers, little boys have to come first
As soon as we get back into space, we're going to spend some real time together
promise
Maureen looks out the window
long beat
Then she smiles
What
It's nice to have our family under one roof
Even if we had to go half way across the galaxy to manage it
John presses a button, the blast shield opening to reveal the stacked orbs of three glowing moons
Maureen smiles
How would you feel about a little late night tutorial, Professor
John moves to her, begins pulling her down, out of
Mm
That's new
What are you doing
Going for extra credit
- - The ship sits on the alien landscape
() Good night John
() Good night Maureen
() Good night Judy
() Good night Will
() Good night Penny
() You guys have got to be kidding
17: The Core -------------------- - -- Will comes up on the elevator, rubbing his eyes, first awake in the morning
He stumbles to the viewscreen
-
His eyes widen with shock
Oh man
giant portal shimmers at snow's edge about 100 yards from the ship
Beyond it, a sun-stained field of towering plants and trees
- The crew gathers at the table
() a
The ship shakes
What are those rumblings
They've been happening all morning
How can half the landscape have grown up overnight
Okay, let's get settled
Maureen
' -
geothermal analysis shows the giant plates that make up this world appear mismatched
It's impossible
But this planet's geothermic plates don't match up
was afraid of this
Al1 eyes turn to John
think these tremors are the result of opening and closing doorways
Doorways to where
The future
Perhaps the Professor was hit on the head when we landed
Remember the portal that lead us to the probe ship
What if we crossed a into a time years after Earth sent a rescue mission
You're not serious
Time travel is impossible
No it's not
It's just improbable
Like hyperdrive was a hundred years ago
Nothing's really impossible
This world could be riddled with doorways to the future
So if we walk into that forest outside, we're really just walking into this crater years from now
Geological plates from different times wouldn't fit together
That would explain the tectonic mismatch
But doorways in time, John
If these portals are opening and closing, part of some cascading, natural phenomenon, they could be tearing this planet apart These portals are exactly what predicted my time machine would do
What if the doorways aren't natural
machine that bends space, like our hyperdrive, could be modified to bend time as well
What if someone on this world has built a device
Son,  appreciate your input but now isn't the time for flights of fancy
You never listen to me
Not ever
And with that Will storms out
John stares after him a beat, sorely wanting to follow
() another
There's no telling how long before this planet breaks up entirely
(rising)
Don and  are going to locate the radioactive material for the core
Get the ship ready to go
We may have very little time
- John, suited up, heads for the open front hatch when he spots Will sitting alone in the Com chair, tinkering with his deck
Aren't you coming out to say goodbye
Will just shakes his head
You're always leaving
What if
Will looks away, finally giving voice to his worst fear
What if one time you don't come home
John stares at his son, unsure what to say, the boy's anguish so deep and apparent
He reaches into his shirt, takes off his dog tags
Whenever your grandfather went away on a mission, held leave these with me
For safe keeping
And when he got home  d always be waiting to give them back
He lifts the chain and places it around the boy's neck
'm coming back Will
promise
Will is silent
John touches the boy's hair, then walks out
beat
Will looks up after his father, fingering the dog tags
- The Robinsons, all except Will, stand-gathered around the front of the ship
Don has a small tracking device in his hand
've got a fix on the radioactive material
It's through the portal
We'll just have to hope the doorways remain stable
These crater walls are disabling the com-links
You won't be able to communicate with the ship
() the ground shakes again
Maureen Come home to me, Professor
love you, wife
John kisses her
Don looks at Judy
'm going to regret saying this, But try to get back in one piece
This is kind of a kiss for luck occasion, wouldn't you agree, Doc
See
'm regretting it already
(coy) Kisses have to be earned
Say goodbye, Blip
Blip reaches up and touches John's face
Then her  form a rough approximation of the words Penny taught her
Nice girl
Pretty girl
Nice
You take care of her, Penny
(kisses her head) Take care of you too, baby
Then the two men bead off, towards the portal and forest beyond
Smith stares out the cabin window
as -' Yes, enjoy your moments of trite familial bonding
He turns, heads back to his table, transformed now, into a makeshift lab, the stolen control bolt in mid-modification
Because they will be your last
-' The beginnings of Will's home-made robot sits on the table
is in the f
g
riffling his   container
Penny , an assortment of small electronic devices, hairclips, and other metal and electronic objects
Dumps them on the table
That's everything even close to nonessential
Even my bellybutton ring
Thanks, Pen
You want to come on a land survey
But Will just shakes his head, sulky
Look, what does dad know
Maybe someone did build a time machine
She ruffles his hair
Disappears
Will activates a  speaker
Robot is on line
() a  has begun
looks up, puzzled
It sounds like old morse code
Chapter 18: Danger Will
------------------------ - Will walks down the corridor
() The  continues
Will follows the  until he comes to the door of Smith's prison
Smith is visible through the door window, sitting at a table, hammering out the code with his boot
He beckons Will inside
Will shakes his head
Smith begins  again
(sounding out the code) Danger
-' The door slides open and Will , a laser pistol in hand
You said someone is in danger
We all are
You are wise to arm yourself
Smith eyes the weapon, moving towards the boy
This gun is set to fire for me only so don't try anything funny
Smith barely misses a beat as he adjusts, passing the child, going instead to the window and opening the blast shield
William, you misjudge me
only want to help you
Help us
You tried to kill us all
But now our fates are intertwined
if your father and that idiot West fail, will have no chance of getting home
It is in my best interests they succeed
And  always follow my best interests
Smith gazes out at the exotic terrain
() an inhuman
What monsters roam these alien wilds
Fools
To set off blindly across this savage land
Much as  hate to admit it, it will be harder to manage without them
What are you talking about
They'll be back
They'll be okay
Smith is silent
long, lethal beat
Someone should go after them
Will,  forbid it
You're a boy clever one, certainly, but a child nonetheless
This planet is likely full of predators
Even if you found them, what if they're hurt, ravaged, dying, what good could you do
But you're a doctor
Smith turns away, hiding his smile
- - Judy and Maureen are hanging on repelling lines before the crater wall, shipping away ore that glitters like diamonds
It's impossible
Not really
Geologists have speculated that Dimondium might be naturally occurring in many older worlds
Part of a biosphere's way of rejuvenating itself
This one is ten times more powerful then that on Alpha Prime
There's enough here to save Earth
Penny stands in the f
g
with Blip on her arm, taking plant samples, talking into her video recorder
After much deliberation, the Space Captive has decided to accept her new role as member of the crew
The Robinsons, after all, can  obviously use her help
Blip jumps up on Penny's arm, knocking her recorder to the ground
(flaring) Now look what you've done
Stop hanging all over me
Blip stares at her, frightened by her tone, begins backing away to the edge of the forest
She looks at Penny, then disappears into the thick brush
Blip
Wait
'm sorry
Damn
Penny heads after the creature
on her recorder
Forgotten
19:  Different Future ------------------------------ -' - Will and Smith are walking down a forest path
The boy has a radiation tracker in his hand
've got a fix on Dad's suit beacon
Dead ahead is a field of beautiful, alien flowers, their purple leaves moving in the wind like an azure sea
Wow, that's Mom's favorite color
How droll
() a tremendous
The
Suddenly, the air in the distance begins to twist, a rushing distortion sweeping towards them, flowers growing, landscape aging rapidly within
Run, child, run
Smith turns, begins to flee, pulling Will with him, away from the rushing warp
Smith trips, falls, closes his eyes, waiting for the distortion to overtake him
beat
He opens his eyes
-
glowing, stationary portal shimmers behind him, revealing beyond a forest ever older, darker, more overgrown
Will
Will
No sign of the boy
Then, from behind a tree, Will appears
Wow
The field across the portal has is now a mass of giant plants, the flowers a deep red
Will rushes across the rip in space
William, wait
See, over here 'm in the future
(steps back towards Smith) Here 'm in the past
Don't worry
If my theories are correct, these doorways should remain stable, for a while anyway
can barely contain my glee
Why aren't you aging like the plants
That's just an effect of the portals forming
Once they stabilize you can cross from one time to another just like stepping between two rooms
(off his tracker) Dad's signal is this way
Come on, Doctor Smith
Will takes Smith's hand, pulls him across the threshold
-
Where he stands is now lush, the sky overhead a glowing crimson
Yet behind him, the path in as it originally appeared
Younger
The sky, bright
Will has run deeper into the brush
Smith notices something by his feet
He clears away the brush, revealing shapes beneath the foliage
His expression darkens
() What did you find
Will has returned
Come, come, son, no time for distractions
Let's move on
Smith shoves Will on, the boy unable to see what Smith saw
Headstones
Each bears a marking, the names still legible
Maureen, Penny and Judy Robinson
-' -- John and Don emerge from the brush
They have come to one of the crater walls
John looks from the rock face to his tracker
Damn
Damn
Damn is not good
The radiation signature we've been tracking
it's a  ghost reflection from the Jupiter Two bouncing off the ore in these walls
There's no core material here
() a sudden
The ground shakes
The  of
time portal rushes towards them like a glittering maw, the side of the crater aging and crumbling in it's wake
John and Don race away from the distortion, ducking falling trees, roll clear as the portal stabilizes, now a fixed doorway to a darker, more deserted future
The ship's back that way
we have to go through
--- Penny is pushing through the forest
Blip
'm sorry
Blip
She spots the tiny creature ahead in the distance
Blip  the ground, runs a few steps
again
Looks up
There, before Blip is another glittering hole in time
The forest beyond is far thicker, the sky red
Blip steps through the portal
Blip, wait
Penny goes to the edge of the portal, stares at the monstrously tall trees beyond
beat
Then she steps through, following
- - Penny pushes through dwindling brush to a series of rocky overhangs and caverns cut into the crater wall
is standing over a large circular stone, hopping up and down, and  madly
Blip, you can't run off like that
(closing on the stone) What the-
-
series of hieroglyphs are painted on the giant rock, their images the same style as those on the probe ship
-
mighty battle in space is depicted
() Some kind of fight, in space
It almost looks like the probe ship Major West blew up
-
fiery star falls to the planet's surface
That could be the Jupiter Two crash landing
-
Here a dark haired beauty holds a single lizard monkey aloft, her face remarkably like Penny's
Suddenly  begins to
()  leaves
are moving in the trees, the vague outline of camouflaged forms dropping to the ground
Five figures suddenly de-camouflage
Lizard monkeys, two large, two smaller
Directly in front of Penny, the largest monkey de-camouflages
Fully grown, the beast is nearly twice Penny's height
Around the creature's wrist is something odd
An old, tattered green ribbon
begins to  and
Blip, no
Too late
Blip leaps on the giant creature, grabs the ribbon
The beast could slap Blip away like a fly
But the creature doesn't resist, just stares down at Blip with something akin to tenderness
Blip looks at the ribbon in his hand
Then at the one around her wrist
Save for their age difference
, the ribbons are identical
The giant monkey moves forward, closing on a petrified Penny, paw reaching out, touching her face
The beast begins stroking Penny's cheek in a familiar gesture of comfort
Nice girl
Pretty girl
Nice
Penny stares up in stunned wonder
-' -- Don and John are crossing the brush
The terrain in growing ever more desolate, desert like
The double suns hang on the horizon
We should be able to see the ship
Something catches the light on the ground beside them
Don reaches down and lifts a small metal fragment in his hand
-
On it is the familiar logo of the United Space Agency
Could these be from the probe
Corroded
This metal is decades old
Don finds another piece of wreckage, turns it over in his hand
It's not possible
-
The fragment bears a simple legend: Jupiter Two
What kind of nightmare is this
Where the hell are we
No, Major, when the hell are we
Suddenly Don is hit in the chest with a plasma charge, goes flying
John ducks and rolls,  his laser from behind the cover of a rocky mound
John goes up to take another , is bit with a powerful electrical blast, falling hard
Still
Rolling out from behind him, claws extended in attack Position and apparently many years old, is a rebuilt Robot
-' -- Will and Smith are crossing the alien terrain
The plants have given way to desert
The suns hang low in the crimson sky
feel like we got turned around
Just follow your father's signal, young William
Oh shit
boy of your intelligence shouldn't swear
(pointing) Look
Oh
Shit, indeed
At the edge of the crater wall sits the wrecked hull of the Jupiter Two
The lower sections are gone, the hull scarred, open to the sun
: -
Stirring to consciousness
-  - Or what is left of it
Dark
The occasional  panel flickers Shattered monitors
An awful history-told in torn metal
John is slumped in a corner, Don still on the floor beside him
() Well, well
All things really do come to he who waits
sits in the command chair, visage obscured by shadow
What is this place
Why Professor, the shock must have scrambled your brain
Look around you
Don't you recognize the spot
You've come home
This can't be
But even as the words cross his lips, he knows it is
What have you done to the ship
Where's my family
Your family is dead
Dead and in the ground
No
What fickle consort in memory
Time dims certain images while others shine clear and bright as yesterday
The figure stands, light hitting his face
Late thirties
Long blond hair, a shaggy beard and moustache
Eerily familiar
'll never forget that morning
Twenty years ago
What was it you said
'll be back
promise
But knew better
You never came home
The figure walks to one of the burned out panels
Without you, your family never had a chance
few spidersv survived the destruction of the probe ship
They reached the planet and attacked can still hear the women scream
Who are you
The figure walks forward, into the light
Stands there a moment
Then he lifts something hanging around his neck
Tarnished metal, old but familiar
John's father's dog tags
Don't you recognize me, Dad
It's me
'm your son
Will
- - Maureen and Judy, lasers drawn, are pushing through the brush
Penny
Penny
The four lizard monkeys are kneeling in a circle around Penny
Penny
Baby, are you alright
Penny rises, steps forward, carrying Blip
The other beasts hang back, their faces genuflecting, almost reverential
It's okay, Mom
They're not going to hurt us
it's like  they think 'm their princess or something
: -  -- Judy is examining the palm of the largest beast as Maureen scrutinizes the images graven into the giant stone
Best as  can tell this whole clan was spawned by this single creature
(to the beast) We've been a busy girl haven't we
But
Speak, doctor
Each creature seems to have unique corpuscular patterns on their palms
As individual an fingerprints, no two alike
Except
Except the prints on this giant creature and our little Blip match exactly
Don't they
How did you know
Because,  think Blip and our friend here are actually one and the same
Penny and Judy stare at her in wonder
- - - The Robot, shoving John with one claw, carrying Don in the other, follows Older Will into the giant room
Father,  give you
eternity
War torn and pirated
pit of molten lava bursts through the floor above which floats a giant ball of silvery liquid held suspended by the pulsing field of the hyper-drive
Tendrils of fire strain towards the bubble
As they  into the silver liquid, images form within the sphere, nearly coherent, then gone
tracked gantry stretches from the floor, leading out over the bubble
At the end of the track a crow's-nest of   a single laser down into the center of the bubble
(coming to) ouch
Who ordered me that last drink
What the hell is going on
think we crossed into our own future
We've come back to the Jupiter Two decades after we left
Look father, what my flights of fancy have wrought
used your hypergate to build my time machine
Will moves to a control console at the base of the giant gantry
Over the years  have struggled in vain to harness the awesome power of time
All my experiments at creating a stable doorway have been futile
Until now
Today you will witness my ultimate triumph
Will hits a button
generator opens, revealing a glowing cylinder of core material incrementally descending into the console
The core material
if we could get that back to our Jupiter Two
The doorways in time that led us here must be a side effect of his machine coming on line
Like streams running into the ocean
Once this core material in fully introduced into the control console, will open a doorway stable enough for one person to take one trip through time and space as well
Today,  will change history
Will turns a switch on the control console
() More
The laser beam's intensity grown, and in the corridor cut by the beam into the bubble images begins to stabilize
Images of Earth
will return home, to the very day you took us on this cursed mission
'll stop us from taking off
'll do what you never could
'll save the family
'll save us all
Look around
Your machine is ripping           this planet apart
What if the force wave you ride home has the same effect on Earth
What if, in getting home, you destroy Earth in the process
beat
Then Will turns away, goes back to work
'm going home
'm going to save the family
Will, 'm your father
You've got to listen to me-
Let me tell you about my father
My father was a walking ghost
Never there when  needed him
He dragged his family into deep dark space and lost them there
My father is not coming to the rescue
20: Spiders Sting ------------------------- - PLAnet-- Will and Smith are closing on the battered ship
Smith puts his hand on the boy's arm, holding him back
We've got to go inside
Slow down, now
We can't know what waits inside that ravaged craft
But we can be confidant it is nothing good
And  for one am frightened
But Dad's in there
Will, listen to me
have crossed this world with you, found your father as promised
But  can't let you go in there unarmed
But 've got a gun
If we go forward, the barer of that weapon must be ready to kill
Murder is a skill, one which  have developed and, luckily dear boy, you have not
Look inside your heart, Will
Are you truly capable of taking a life
If not, then  ask you now, put your faith in me
Give me your trust
Give me that gun
Will stares him
Pulls free the pistol
Thumbs the lock pad
Enable gun for all users
Voiceprint confirmed
Will hands Smith the gun
Finally
Smith grabs Will by the neck, pressing the barrel to his temple
brief lesson in survival on this world or any other
Never trust anyone
Remember it into your old age, should you have one
(shoving him forward) Now move
- - - John stands facing older Will
Don is in the b
g
, edging towards the control panel and the descending core material
We can go back across the portals to the past, to the functioning Jupiter Two, where your mother and sisters are still alive
We can use this core material to escape together
And then what
All of us lost in space
Don't you see
can do what you never could
can save us all
Don has edged his way to the descending core material
() 'm afraid not
Through the doorway comes young Will, Smith walking behind him, hand on his shoulder, gun to his head
Never fear
Smith is here
Will,
Don't move, Professor Robinson or this rather peculiar family reunion will be tragically brief
(off Don) 'll ask you to step away from that console, Major
Don stares at him a beat
Then obliges, walking over to join John
Smith approaches the Robot
Well, well, some of us just don't know when to stay dead
Smith goes into his tunic and removes his modified control bolt
borrowed this from the probe ship in hopes of taking over the helm once we were in flight
But  seem to have found a better use instead
Smith slaps the bolt on the Robot's
The automaton's arms go up, then fall limp
Docile
Let's try this dance again
You are the puppet
am the puppeteer
Do get it right this time
Smith activates the bolt
The Robot powers up once again
Robot, enable electric disrupters
The Robot's claws begin to glow with electricity
Smith smiles
Now that's a good gargantuan
Smith walks to Older Will, puts the gun to his head
Say goodbye to your past
You're future lies with me
'm going home in your place
Smith starts to pull Older Will away when Will comes forward, staring at the time machine, eyes wide with awe
You did it
Just like  imagined
Re-routed the hypercore
But the natural power source, the delivery system
never thought of those
Older Will's smile is bittersweet as he places his hand on his younger self
Touches his hair
You will
The future is never what it looks like when you're ten
Heartwarming
Nauseatingly sentimental but heartwarming
Smith shoves the boy back to his father, turns to Older Will
We certainly could have aged better, must say Now, show me how your little time machine works
But Will just smiles
An odd moment for mirth, don't you think
What are you grinning at
Look around you, Doctor
At this hostile world
Do you really think a boy could have survived all alone
-
Puzzled
Unseen, the boulder behind him seems to be moving, shifting
comes, alien, yet terrifyingly familiar
() Never fear, Smith is here
The shape behind him unfolds, coming up now, long spindled arms and legs, ten feet tall, a hybrid monster, half spider, half Smith
Hello, Doctor, how nice to see me again after all these years
Smith stands petrified as the creature approaches him on spindled legs, goes down on its second knee joints, coming eye to eye
The spider's sting had some unexpected side effects
Spider Smith flexes his three jointed arm
But my unique gifts gave me an advantage in this quarrelsome world
Spider Smith reaches out and caresses Will's cheek
Turns  to John
After the women were savaged, became the father Will never had
He grabs Smith's arms and begins to move him about like a marionette, engaging in a bizarre dance with himself
(bending him) But you, Doctor
Your crude ambition fills me with self-loathing
(twisting him) You see  have looked within me and what  see is you
With that Spider Smith lifts Smith over his head and hurls him like torpedo through a torn hole in the hull, towards the rocks beyond
never liked me, anyway
Spider Smith turns to face the Robot
Kill them all
No
But my dear boy, once the doorway in time stabilizes, this planet is going to come apart at the seams
Smith throws the back of one hand over his forehead in a parody of a twenties starlet
am willing to perish here on this world for the sake of your most noble mission
But your selfish father will only try to stop you
His head comes forward, neck elongating so he faces
Once your mission is complete, none of this will have happened anyway
So why not just dispose of them
But Will's gaze is impassive
Spider Smith actually
Very well
Robot, take them inside the ship and keep them there
If they move, then kill them
- - Maureen and Judy are examining the heiroglyph stone
The ground shakes
Birds
()
We've got to get to the ship
Penny
She turns
The clearing is empty
No Blips
No Penny
Blip runs cut before them, grabs Maureen's hand, trying to pull her forward
Where is she, girl
In Blip's hand, a mass of colored ribbons from Penny's wrists
Blip waves them in the air, then races off
beat
The women follow
- - - The pulse laser is increasing its intensity, the corridor of images in the bubble stabilizing
The  are increasing in frequency
Spider Smith stands with Will, watching as the Robot shepherds the crew towards the body of the ship
Well, it would seem the time is upon us
Off we go, William
Spider Smith starts climbing the gantry, truly like a spider, up towards the bridge and crows nest hanging over the bubble
Will walks to the control console platform, the platform now beginning to rise on the gantry, towards the bridge above
-
Something hangs from below the climbing Spider Smith's back
It's an egg pouch of the kind they saw on the probe ship log
(shouting) Will, it's a trick
Smith's carrying an egg sack
If he's willing to stay on this world and die, why is he about to spawn
He's going through the portal himself
The Robot  a charge between its claws
Proceed to the ship or be destroyed
-
Frowns
Suddenly, Smith's head drops
The creature is hanging upside-down
He smiles
Hurry, boy
Time waits for no man
- - The platform bearing Will reaches the top of the gantry and begins moving out across the bridge towards the crows-nest
- -   - Spider Smith drops into place beside Older Will as the control platform comes to a stop on the crow's-nest
The core cylinder continues sinking into the console
Smith looks out over the platform
Beneath them, imagine of infinity flicker
It's almost time
really am a word-smith
Once the core cylinder is fully injected, the planet will begin to come apart and the time doorway will stabilize
Then  jump in
leap of faith
How fitting
-
In the circle made by the laser, the images are not yet stable, but discernable
Earth the day before the launch
Tell me again, old monster, how did the girls die
We've been over this before, son
The spiders attacked the ship In all the years since, the spiders have never re-surfaced
Why
Smith stares at him
Then he smiles
horrible sight
Let's forget the past
Will turns a switch
The laser generated aperture narrows
What are you doing
Focusing the aperture
Remember, the energy around the portal will rip a man to pieces
Isn't the doorway too small
Not for me
(a beat) But then 'm not going, am
The spiders didn't kill the girls
It was you
just never let myself see it
You kept me alive because you needed me
Because  could build this for you
You killed my family
Destroyed this world
And  helped
You became mad as the spiders
And  became you
Poor, poor boy
Did you really think would let you go home
Let all that  have become vanish
Look at me
am no mere man
am a God
Spider Smith opens his pouch, revealing a thousand tiny spiders
Your father was right
Within me roil the growing needs of a master race
We  descend upon helpless Earth
An entire planet to rule
His arm whips out, grabbing Will, bringing him close, opens his mouth, bearing venomous fangs
An entire planet on which to feed
-  - John and Don talk in the holding area
The Robot stands guard
() the  are increasing in frequency
'll run, draw his fire
You may have time to get away with Will
() Halt or Robot will destroy
The men look up
In the b
g
, Will has approached the Robot
Do you remember what  taught you long time ago
About friendship
Friendship means acting with your heart not your head
That's why  rebuilt you
Because wanted us to be friends
Logic error
Friendship does not compute
Forget logic
Act with your heart
Robot has no heart
Robot is powered by a fusion pulse generator Every living thing has a heart
The Robot stares at him a beat
Any attempts to override command protocols may result in fused processors in my neural net
The floor trembles again
The planet is coming apart at the seams
Please, Robot, if you don't let us go, we're all going to die
'm asking you now, will you help us
Will you be my friend
The Robot stands still a beat
Then he reaches towards Smith's control bolt attached firmly on his
Robot attempting to deactivate control bolt-commands overriddenattempting to reroute-dangercircuitry overloadattempting to escape-kill them, kill them
The Robot's claws lift into attack position, an electrical charge building with dangerous intensity
He is about to fire
At the last minute, the Robot jerks his hand upward,  away a piece of the ceiling
He rips off the control bolt
You did it
Robot will save
will save Will Robinson
will save my friend
21: Time to Die
------------------------ --- Penny and Maureen chase a frantic Blip through the portal back into the daylight of the present
Here, too, the world
(shouting ) Penny
Penny
Penny stands in front of the Jupiter Two, beckoning them urgently
Where did you go
came through the forest
had a promise  had to keep
Before Maureen can respond the ground , begins crumbling
Inside
Fast
-  - Don, John, Will and the Robot stand at the open hatch
Outside, the ground
You've got find your way back to the ship
The portals may still be stable
'll try to meet you there
What do you mean
'm going to get that core material
It's our only chance to escape
'll stay
The family needs their father The crew needs their pilot
No matter what happens, when the planet starts to break up you take off
Without the core we'll never have enough power to make orbit
You've got to try
Promise me, Don

Then Don extends his hand
Good luck
Commander
Just then Will and the Robot arrive
Will
Son
want you to know- (fighting tears) You'll tell me when you get back to the ship
Now there just isn't time
John bites back a bittersweet smile
() another
could use a weapon
The Robot extends his claw
panel opens on his arm and he tears out a hand-made component
conduit made from Will's golden first prize medals, joined together to make a jagged star
Professor,  have a plan
- -   -FuTURE Spider Smith has Will against the rail
Time to die, son
'm not your son
And with that Will  Spider Smith in the face with two closed lists
Smith recoils, lifts the boy aver his head
Goodbye
Smith hurls Will over the rail towards the time pool below
The creature walks to the end of the arm, stares at the forming aperture into the past below him
-
Images of the day before the mission launch swirl in the laser-generated opening, growing ever more stable
Will is hanging over the time bubble, unconscious and unseen, dangling from the gantry by a flashing chain around his neck
22: Time Travel ----------------------- :-' -- Don and the Robot, Will riding his back, navigate the terrain alongside the ravaged hull of the Jupiter Two
Look
On the ground, crumpled in a heap, is Smith
Don checks his pulse
(disappointed) Damn
He's still breathing
() the rushing
portal opens before them to a far younger world
Then another portal, to a world far older
third portal  across the sky overhead
The time machine must be near full power
The portals are collapsing
Which one leads us home
More portals are opening around them, others winking shut
There
Through a new rip in time, the intact Jupiter Two can be seen in relief of the battered future craft
The ground beneath their feet is beginning to give way
We can't just leave him here
Sure we can
(off 's stare) Damn it
(slapping the Doctor) Smith
Wake up
Smith
(coming to) Oh, the pain, the pain
Danger
Will Robinson
Danger
The  is beginning to shimmer
The ground starts to fall away
Jump
Don hurls Smith through, Will, the Robot and West darting across the threshold just as the portal winks closed
-- The trees are bursting into flames an Will, Don, the Robot and Smith emerge from the woods
Race forwards towards
- -- The women are powering up the ship
The men are visible through the windscreen
Outside, the ground in beginning to crumble
Mom, the forest
Penny opens the air lock
Maureen holds close her son
Steps back
Where's John
The portal closed behind us
It was his only way back

geyser of fire  into the air
We've got to try and lift off
We've already begun the pre-flight countdown
You have the Com
(off Don's expression) 'm going to save as many lives as can, Major
Now strap in
- -   PLATFoRm- ()
More lava is rushing up towards the mercury, the walls themselves beginning to crack
opens a gate at the end of the crow's-nest and a gang plank unfolds above the doorway in time
() Not so fast
John stands on the platform behind Smith, fighting star in hand, slashes for his face
Smith moves fast, knocking the star to the gantry bridge with his arm
John leaps on Smith, using his fists
You sabotaged our mission
(hook) You killed my family (jab) You stole my son
It's payback time
Smith's head moves from each impact, but the punches have no effect
It smiles
Grabs John and hurls him across the platform
Spare me the fury of the righteous
The monster leans down over John
Opens its jaw
think there's time for a snack before my trip
John's hand is reaching towards the fallen fighting star
At the last moment John grabs the metal weapon from the catwalk, slashes Smith across the face, silver-red blood pouring down his cheek
(sarcastic) Oh, the pain
The pain
You ain't seen nothing yet
John feints towards Smith's head and then slashes low, cutting the viscous membrane of the monster's egg pouch
-
Surprised
Remember the probe ship
These monsters eat their wounded
'  -
Scores of the tiny spiders are pouring out of the sack, rushing up towards Smith's face, tiny jaws chomping
No
Stop
No
Spider Smith tumbles backwards, falling against the rail on the side of the platform
John rises and rushes him, - him, sending Smith hurling over towards the bubble below
Spider Smith hits the bubble, missing the doorway formed by the red laser and is swept up by the tides of time
Take all the time you want to die
Spider Smith  as he disappears and reappears in the various half-formed images within the bubble before vanishing altogether
John turns
The core cylinder has descended almost entirely into the main console
only seconds before it's too late to retrieve it
- -- The landscape is a sudden inferno
- - Don is at the Com
Maureen strapped into the co-pilot's chair
kept hoping somehow he'd appear
Maureen stares a beat out the window
Let's go, Major
Don hits the engine switch
The
mighty generators  into life
(quiet) Goodbye, my love
23: Escape Velocity --------------------------- The ship rocks as land masses on all sides begin to give way
Engaging primary thrusters
Now
- -- The power drive begins to glow, diodes spinning
The landing struts retract
The Jupiter Two begins to rise
- - - - -
The core material in sinking fast
John moves towards it when something on the gantry catches his eye
-
Wedged into the grill work is a shiny scrap of metal reflecting the setting sunlight
John's father's dog tags
John rushes to the rail
There, still unconscious and hanging by the dog-tag chain is Older Will
-
The metal links are pulling apart
Will is seconds away from falling into the pool
-
The cylinder has completely sunken into the machine
It's Will or the core material
No time for both
John stands a beat, immobile
Then he drops to his knees, reaching down as the chain breaks, grabbing Will's wrist at the last second
The dog tags tumble into the pool below as John hoists Older Will up onto the safety of the gangplank
Come on, son
Wake up
Will is still
Then, finally, his eyes open
Dad
thought  lost you
The core
Will turns in time to see the core cylinder sink into the control panel, the laser exploding in intensity below them as it drains the cylinder's radioactive power
The world begins to
You could have taken the core and left before it was too late
You saved me instead
John stares at him
There wasn't any choice
couldn't let you fall
You're my boy

Reaches full power
The image in the time pool stabilizes, becoming clear
-
Mission Control the day before the launch
Father and Son stare into the past, eyes filled with wonder
Look
They made it
Through a torn hole in the hull and a glowing rip in space, the Jupiter Two is rising into the flame ravaged sky
- The ship is shaking madly
We're not getting any altitude
- -- The fire  are legion, giant chunks of the planet's surface now falling away beneath them
huge spew of flame rages from the fire-pocked surface, hitting the bull of the tiny craft
- - Judy is at navigation, frantically enhance the stabilizers
'm reading a power build up
Markers in the red- Suddenly the panel , sending Judy flying across the bridge
Penny races to her sister
Kneels
Judy's eyes are wide, still
She's dead
- - The ground is breaking, falling into an endless fiery abyss below
Not enough power to make orbit
- -- Another firestorm
flame geyser hits the ship
Then another
- - Control panels all around the ship begin to
The main screen is hit by a flying chunk of rock
The giant glass begins to crack
(to Maureen) 'm sorry
The windshield , sucking them both out into space
- -- The ship is hit by another fire geyser
The Jupiter Two
- - - John and Will kneel on the crow's nest as the Jupiter Two dodges the fire geysers in the sky through the torn hull
The ship is struck once, again, finally  in a  ball of fire
-
man who has lost everything he ever loved
couldn't save them
Will stares at his father and beyond him
There, in the time doorway, a young Will walks towards the entrance to Mission Control in the morning sun, innocent with no knowledge of the future
() So many years ago and  can still feel it
Our sun
Our Earth
It's all 've thought about
Going home
Will reaches forward and touches the control console
The images in the laser generated doorway begin to change
long time ago, you told a small boy that one day he'd understand how precious he was, how much his father loved him
Today is that day
-
Instead of Earth we now see this planet's surface, the Jupiter Two rising as it did just moments ago
All  could see was your need to go forward at any cost
What you never showed me was your love
lost that
Robbed by time
could never see how much you cared
Until now
-
The Jupiter Two tries in vain to dodge the fire geysers, then  all over again
Will enters some commands
-
The image in the portal begins to run backwards, the Jupiter Two reconstituting from a ball of flame, receding past diminishing flame geysers, beginning to land again
Father, take my hand
- We are back in the ship just before take off
mans the Cam
Maureen straps herself into the co-pilot's chair
kept hoping somehow he'd appear
Maureen stares a beat out the window
Let's go, Major
Don hits the engine switch
The mighty generators  into life
(quiet) Goodbye my love
Look
The roof of the hull is beginning to swirl, becoming translucent, like water
There, standing above them, John and Older
2NT
- - -' - The bridge of the Jupiter Two is visible in the laser generated doorway
Older  looks to his father
' make me wait another lifetime to know how you feel
And with that he pushes John over the edge, the Professor falling down through space and into the bubble and the doorway below
- The ceiling becomes water an John drops into the ship
Maureen cradles her husband
Then she looks up
Will is still visible through the watery hull
Come with us
But the passage through time and space is already breaking up as the world of the engine room  in the b
g
can't
There was only enough power for one person, one trip, remember
Will
It's good to see you again, Mom
It's good to see you alive
(fading) Sorry about all the monkey business
Maureen reaches up towards her son, reaching down, the two hands almost touching before Will is gone, the portal closed forever
He sacrificed everything for his family
(fighting tears) He had a good example
Maureen holds him close
small figure walks up beside them
Will
Dad
beat, then Will reaches up, hands him his dog tags
'm glad you came back
just want you to know  love you son
love you very much
John takes the boy in his arms, father and son finally holding close
() more  as the ground continues to give way
() The planet is breaking up around us
John moves fast to the Com
Nice of you to drop in
John smiles a beat, then he's all business
Status
()  tremendous
- The land masses are falling away beneath them, plummeting into giant caverns of fire
- We're doomed
We're doomed
West turns, hauls off and  Smith, knocking him out cold
Boy, that felt good
Get us airborne
Don throws the power switches to full
- The landing struts retract
The power drive begins to spin
The Jupiter Two rises above the ground just as the firmament collapses upon itself
Fire geysers
History in about to repeat itself
- 'm going to try to reach escape velocity
Maybe we can break the gravitational pull
No
We don't have the core material
The gravity wells will drag us down
We might- We won't make it
Trust me
know
We've got to go down
What
Through the planet as she breaks up
That's insane
don't have time to argue
'm giving you a direct order, Major
Don and John stare at each other a beat
Then Don smiles
Yes Sir
-
The world is breaking up beneath them, revealing a fiery maw
the engines, heading straight for the chasm
- The tiny ship flies into the giant expanding crevice
- is flying into the shattering center of the planet
Masses of continents, some bearing forests, others oceans, all soar past
- The tiny ship flies deeper toward the molten center of the planet
- There
window out the windscreen a portion of the planet has torn away revealing the black of space and the starfield beyond
see it
Don banks the ship toward the opening, flying past exploding fragments of this shattering world
- The ship clears the planet as the world  in the b

24: Alpha Prime ----------------------- - guides the ship out into space
Judy comes up behind him
Nice work, flyboy
So,  earn that kiss yet
(a peck on the cheek) You earned that
shrugs, begins to turn away
Judy grabs him
This one is on credit
She gives him a long, passionate kiss
She lets him go, stunned
Cold fish, huh
Penny holds Blip in her arms, who has begun to  madly
Poor thing
She's lost her whole family
(off Penny) Penny, why are you looking at me like that
Penny
Penny presses a button
Blast doors open on a storage hold
promised Judy 'd take care of her
couldn't leave her all alone
(all stare at her) Well  am their princess, after all

Forms in the cargo hold de-camouflage
The other lizard monkeys, standing amidst glittering canisters of Dimondium
Dimondium
Now if we could only find our way back to Earth
If  may, Professor
The Robot projects a holographic schematic of the galaxy
The Jupiter Two is highlighted
Earth blinks at the other and
Your son's star charts
It's a map home
()
The shattered planet's core is turning bright red, a sudden  blast wave heading towards the ship
The planet's gravity field in collapsing
We'll be sucked in
There's no way to get clear in time
The hyperdrive
Everybody hang on
Here we go again
Cool
Don throws the switch
- The planet's core  as the Jupiter Two vanishes into hyperspace, a sudden star and then gone
