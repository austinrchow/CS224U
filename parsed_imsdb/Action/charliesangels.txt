Where he slides in past the nervous, shifty-eyed man (his name is ) and sits by the window
After a moment, Pasqual quietly clears his throat and leans, slightly, towards Jones
(tentatively) They say birds can't fly this high
They say only angels can
Now Pasqual nods
Nervously begins to remove something from his pocket when they are interrupted by -- Shall  pour your scotch
No -- 'll take the bottle
Thank you
She hands him the airplane-sized bottle -- he waves off the glass
She shrugs, leaving
Pasqual to resume what he was doing
Slowly, he removes a roll of Certs
He looks to Jones -- "Well
What about your end of the bargain
" From within his dashiki, Jones pulls out a black velvet pouch
He hands it to Pasqual, who opens it to find diamonds
helluva lot of diamonds
Pasqual smiles
He hands the roll of Certs to Jones
It's not breath candy at all, but a tiny roll of explosives, with a tiny, high-tech triggering mechanism
Ah, c-5
The most dangerous explosive material ever invented
Hard to believe that this little contraption could blow up ten city blocks
Be careful with it, huh
Both men smile
Pasqual's very relieved that the deal is done
Then suddenly, the lights blink out
Pasqual looks around, nervous

Jones grabs Pascal in a headlock and turns toward the back of the plane, shouting: (') Now Jones does the unthinkable
Holding Pasqual tight, he yanks open the emergency door release
With a , the cabin decompresses
Panic erupts as air, paper and everything not belted in screams out of the open door, including -- -     747 - -- James Earl Jones, still holding Pasqual in a bear hug
They plummet, wind violently tearing at them
Pasqual's frantic  doppler quite nicely
They continue to fall, gaining speed
Pasqual is terrified, but Jones doesn't seem worried

Its door opens, and now a  leaps out, helmet down, arms back, streaking across the sky in aerodynamic perfection, heading directly towards who are still plummeting toward the earth at terminal velocity
Jones begins to let go of Pasqual, who and tries to clutch onto him, desperate

-- the skydiver spread-eagles, stopping the wild dive directly behind Pasqual, and immediately binds his arms and straps a parachute on him
All three are still free-falling
James Earl Jones nods at the Skydiver who, even under the helmet and goggles, is clearly a beautiful woman
Meet  "" , one of Charlie's Angels
She's a sultry bombshell -- a classic femme fatale -- only she's playing for the good guys
She gives James Earl Jones a wink, then jerks Pasqual's rip cord and --
Pasqual's chute deploys

Below the ocean screams up at them
Not much time left
James Earl Jones pulls his belt -- and his mufti flies up
It's actually a tiny drogue chute, deploying his entire dashiki
His outfit hides a parachute rig
Alex pulls her own rip cord and --  -- her chute unfurls, and now

Natalie glances ahead, maneuvering the boat perfectly under Alex, who drops on deck
Alex gathers her chute, then whips off her helmet to give her cascading mane a wild shake
Here comes James Earl Jones
Natalie guns the boat underneath
a perfect catch
Alex helps him with his dashiki-chute, and then all three look up
Here comes Pasqual
Natalie whips the boat around, catching him as he helplessly drops into the seats, still bound, still scared out of his wits
He gapes wild-eyed at the two Angels, then whirls on James Earl Jones
You crazy bastard
think you mean crazy bitch
With that, James Earl Jones reaches up and pulls his face off
Latex rips free, and standing there (without his dashiki, James Earl Jones has a great figure) is
stunningly beautiful  , angel number three
She's the wild one
Pasqual's jaw drops as Dylan shakes her hair free, then reaches in her mouth -- (still with James Earl Jones' voice) Don't need this anymore
-- and extracts a voice-modifying chip

Well, Angels, the experimental explosives are back in the hands of the government, and the free world can breathe just a lit-tle bit easier tonight, thanks to you three
Alex, Natalie and Dylan stroll from the dock onto the sand, each starting to unzip/unbutton/unsnap their action gear and hand it to Bosley as they continue walking
And thanks to you, too, Bos
We couldn't have redirected the flight path without your help
Bosley puffs, proud
He speaks over the ever-growing pile of chutes, body suits, goggles, the dashiki
Nothing a little teamwork can't do
At least, that's what Charlie's always telling us, right ladies
Charlie will be joining us, won't he
He sends his regrets
But he wanted you to know that dinner is on him, so feel free to celebrate
By now, the Angels have stripped off all of their equipment, revealing eye-popping evening gowns

Noticing that none of the other men have towels around their bosoms, Bosley nervously undoes his, revealing skin the color of cooked salmon
He fluffs up his sparse chest hair, then decides to smush it back down

His bad guy instincts tell him these women are working together
He's boxed in
And then, a
Elevator doors open beside him
He looks in to see the clue- less , who had a funky groove going on his headphones
In a single motion, the Thin Man yanks the guy out into the hallway and takes his place
Hits the button
From opposite directions, Natalie and Dylan run to the elevator, but the doors have already shut
Checking the panel
He's going down
They take the stairs
- Natalie and Dylan emerge from the staircase to find the elevator empty
To the left, exit doors swing tellingly
- Nat and Dylan smash through the exit doors and out into the sun-drenched streets of beautiful, downtown Los Angeles
Natalie immediately spots the Thin Man, booking down the alley
That way

: And they take off after him
What ensues is the fastest, wildest, two chicks and one guy foot chase you've ever seen
Here are some highlights: -- Thin Man pulls himself, clumsily, over a chain link fence
Dylan and Natalie pull an old Jackie Chan trick and run up the side wall and hop over easily
-- Thin Man, still on foot, waits for traffic to slow, then darts across the Harbor Freeway
By the time Dylan and Natalie get there, traffic is roaring again
Undeterred, they make their way through, tucking and rolling under the wheels of a moving semi
-- Dylan is racing down an alley, when a car comes barrelling at her
She leaps up onto the hood of the car as it drives underneath her, a la one of those That's Incredible
stunts
-- They chase the Thin Man into an industrial laundromat
The scene goes something like this: Thunderously , with industrial washers and dryers operating at full tilt
Natalie and Dylan are just entering when ring out
They dive for cover behind a massive washer assembly
There are times  wish we carried guns
Where's the challenge in that
the Thin Man, planning his next move
With no good shot at the angels, he aims high, both guns
He shots out the pipes over their heads, sending down a cascade of hot water
Dylan and Natalie scramble back to avoid getting scalded
Other pipes  from the change in pressure, leading to an interior thunderstorm
Steam fills the room as an inch of water grows on the floor
Natalie and Dylan push rolling laundry carts in the Thin Man's direction
He shoots at them, but quickly realizes they're just trying to waste his bullets
Holstering one of his guns, he dials his cell phone

: On the far wall, Natalie switches on the overhead hooks, which circle on a wire like a ski lift
The Thin Man looks up, distracted, not noticing -- As she creeps up behind the cover of the rolling laundry carts
She's succeeded in circling behind the Thin Man as he talks on the phone
She clears her throat
The Thin Man turns
She kicks him in the jaw
Knocked back, he drops the phone, which  and slips under a washing machine
He crab-walks back, then suddenly springs back to his feet
We weren't expecting that kind of ninja move out of this guy
right behind him
With a coiled towel, she grabs his gun arm and expertly flips him
But he reacts smoothly, rolling over to charge at Natalie, picking her up like a sack of potatoes
As he does, he grabs her right in the tit
Hey
Hands off, assh
Before she can finish her sentence, the Thin Man throws Natalie at Dylan, knocking them both down
He jumps up, and with a single motion grabs an overhead pipe and kicks another, releasing a wall of steam -- we can't see a thing
By the time the fog clears, the Thin Man is long gone
Okay, to summarize
Damn
Lying down in the water, Dylan reaches under the washer to fish out the Thin Man's busted cell phone
- Natalie sits at a glowing computer monitor, the Thin Man's cell phone connected by a data cable to the Townsend Agency computers
Rapidly touching the screen, she calls up a list of the last thirty-five phone calls he received
They're all from the same location

Pulling the pin from a canister, she drops it down the chimney

The canister drops into the flames from above, suddenly venting a  cloud of halon gas
The fire dies immediately, the logs covered with a violent frost
- Alex doesn't even need a rope
Her feet pressed to the sooty walls, she expertly slides to the bottom
- Alex backs out of the fireplace to find a swinging at her head
She ducks just in time
The poker against the stone, making a spark
Rolling, jumping and diving, Alex scurries as Pokerman slashes and stabs
She ducks behind a chair, which Pokerman catches with the hook, winging it across the room
Backed against the wall, Alex yanks on the heavy curtains, pulling them down, along with the wooden curtain rod

She goes on the offensive
Thrust, parry, spin
But he's a worthy adversary
One good karate kick breaks her staff in two
She uses both pieces to club him in the knees, then rolls back to the fireplace
She grabs the remaining tool: the fireplace tongs
Pokerman swings
Alex catches his weapon in the tong scissors, yanking it free with such force the point sticks in the wall
quick kick knocks Pokerman to the floor, where Alex rolls on top of him
She catches his head in the tongs, squeezing his temples

Reaching the bottom of the steps, Knox is surprised to be grabbed by Dylan
This way
At this point, he'll do whatever they say

Overhead, bright security lights switch on
Back at the front door, Alex pulls it shut
She attaches a carabiner clip to the handle, running a thin steel cord from it around the porch column

And then, touchdown
The van hits the ground, hard but not catastrophically
Natalie hits the brakes, cuts the wheel hard to avoid hitting in front of them
Everyone takes a beat to acknowledge they're alive
Where are we
Suddenly, a   goes on overhead

- Looking out the back windows
It's a bobsled run
They're facing backwards
Up ahead, the kidnappers are charging down the access roads
The first of two jeeps makes the jump into the bobsled chute

Facing the right direction, they have a much easier time of it

Yes

It missed hitting somebody by millimeters
Natalie is still focused, making each turn as Alex calls it
- ` The front jeep gets even more aggressive, building speed
It hits the next turn too fast, rising up too high along the wall
It tips further, and further, finally rolling over onto its back
It  across the concrete, a shower of sparks as it slows down
With nowhere to go, the second jeep brakes hard, but can't stop
It  into the first jeep, a tangle of steel

Just then, two  race up along the chute walls, passing the crippled jeeps
Two more  jump in from above
Or maybe not
Suddenly, Natalie , remembering something
Oh God, no
What is it

Slamming on the brakes, Natalie turns the van around

He leans into Corwin's car and now we see that's it's
You okay, Boss

You're supposed to be my head of security
Who is that bitch
The Thin Man peers over at Natalie, but she's got her back to him
Don't know
'll keep an eye out
Yeah
You do that
Corwin peels out onto the track again, almost crushing the Thin Man in the process
Dylan sneaks in
In all the cacophony, no one notices as she grabs '  out of the back seat of his regular car, a bitching Mercedes
She checks both ways to see if she's being watched

) Coast is clear, Dylan

She nods to , who is dressed as the Flag Waver
He speaks into a walkie talkie
Let's make the switch
-- Dylan pulls a briefcase out of her jumpsuit, and swaps it with one in Corwin's car
She carefully switches all his files from the old briefcase to the new one, then gives Alex a thumbs up
-- roars back onto the track, keeping Corwin in her sights
Then she spots another Red Star car, coming up right next to her
She locks eyes with the Thin Man
The two of them recognize each other at the exact same instant

: The Thin Man, realizing he's been made, jams on the brakes and skids off to the right, which leads to a ramp that heads out of the stadium
Natalie, not wanting to lose him, does something crazy
Even though she's at the front of the pack, she brakes hard, swerves into a full 180 degree -turn, and starts heading the   on the race track
Startled drivers pull off to the left and right as she follows the Thin Man out of the racetrack
- To a chorus of  , the Thin Man's blue racer weaves through the spectator traffic entering the speedway
Looking back, we see Natalie is gaining on him
Finally clear of the traffic, both cars let it rip
: Looking down on a freeway, where a ubiquitous police pursuit is in progress
If you're just joining us, we're approaching hour five of a pursuit that has lead us all across the Southland, at speeds up to 80 miles an hour
beat-up gray Chrysler leads a phalanx of police cars down the empty freeway
It's oddly calm and hypnotizing
Chuck, time and again we hear the question, "Why don't the police just ram the other car, or shoot out the tires
" The  has a policy of hanging back and following unless
Suddenly, the blue Formula One car comes screeching past the cops and the suspect, over 200 miles per hour
What was that

: As she passes the police cars, we see several look over -- what the hell
Natalie catches up to the gray Chrysler
Looks over to see the - , hunched over the wheel
He looks back at her
beat later, she's passed him, just taillights on the freeway
- With the lanes cleared for the other chase, there is nothing preventing the Formula One cars from hitting top speed -- which they do
Natalie is catching up to the Thin Man
As they head under an overpass, we see
- The Thin Man checks his gauges
The gas dial is perilously close to empty -- these cars are meant to be refilled often
Up ahead, he sees an exit
He starts to slow down
- but when you're going 200 miles per hour, that can take a while
He misses the exit
Natalie is trying to match his speed
The Thin Man pulls over to the side, stops fully
Braking as hard as she can, Natalie still passes him
The Thin Man throws a -turn, heading up the freeway on-ramp
Natalie follows
- We catch glimpses behind fences and between train cars -- the two racers gliding slowly down the narrow roads, like lions pacing
'   - Pulling off her helmet, Natalie scans right and left for the blue car -- she's lost sight of him
The narrow windshields of these racers doesn't make it any easier
- We   on Natalie's car as she rounds a corner, still searching
'  - 8/18/99                               53
- Natalie spots the blue racer reaching the end of the long pier
It pulls a -turn to face her, then stops, engine idling
There's only way off the pier, and it's past Natalie
The Thin Man  his engine
Natalie  hers
a white seagull, pecking at something on the pier, halfway between the two racers
The bird looks up, hearing the engines
the Thin Man
He pulls his harness tighter
his engine higher
Natalie
If it's a game of chicken he wants, she'll give it to him
She  her engine higher still
The noise scares the bird, who suddenly flies off
Like a flag being dropped, that's the signal for both racers to peel out
cloud of
Rubber on asphalt
Already reaching a tremendous speed, the racers are on a collision course
The Thin Man isn't going to turn away
Neither is Natalie
Racing faster, and faster still, there's only one way this can turn out
But then, at the very last moment, the Thin Man wusses out
He cuts the wheel right, missing Natalie and careening off the edge of the pier
In  , we watch as his racer hangs in mid-air, wheels still spinning
Back-heavy, the tail hits the water first
Natalie brakes hard, cuts the wheel to avoid going off the far end of the pier
She finally stops, the rear tire just 1/4 inch from the edge
along the side of the pier, we find Natalie looking into the water where the blue racer went in
There's just a slick of oil and a steady stream of bubbles

We see lots of hallways, doorways and security locks, all from the  of a man's hip
The footage is from the camera in the switched briefcase that Corwin is now carrying with him

The angels and Bosley watch the footage, along with Knox and Vivian Wu
Vivian has seated herself close to Natalie
So close, in fact, that Natalie keeps having to shift a few inches
Dylan, meanwhile, sits across the room from Knox, deliberately avoiding eye contact
: As the videocamera passes a room marked with an intimidating warning sign
There
(') That's the room with the mainframe
Everything at Red Star goes through that system
' So if we want to find proof that Red Star stole Knox's technology, that's the computer to tap
Exactly
But they have heavy firewalls and encryption
You can't jack in from outside
You'll have to physically be in that room to get at the data
Even if we do get inside, there won't be time to search for it
There's got to be a hundred terabytes of information there
It could take days
So you install a transmitter
All eyes go over to Natalie
(') Patch in directly to the relay, broadcast on a high frequency
That way, you can have access to the mainframe from the comfort of your own home
And they have no idea that you can peek inside
() '  - 8/18/99                               55
: Knox is impressed
The other angels nod
It's a good idea
That's all fine in theory
But you still have to get inside that room to install it
What about security
Red Star has a lot of Government contracts, so security is tight
Key- card badges throughout
Redundant security at all red-line areas with biometric scanners and weekly keycodes
Pervasive video surveillance, lasers, air-displacement sensors
Plus a hard- wired fail-safe at the relay to prevent exactly this kind of tapping
It sounds impossible
Alex checks with her fellow angels
They're in agreement
It sounds like fun
With a subtle , we move into a stylized  that shows How They Do It
It features  , and  to show us only the highlights

) Only the two directors can disengage the fail-safe

Magician's assistant Dylan takes off her giant hat to reveal the director's billfold is underneath
Getting it back, he's relieved
Passing behind Dylan, Natalie takes the orange keycard Dylan hands off
(
) Then we have to get back into Red Star
Problem is, their biometric sensors are too good
(
) We need someone's help

He slows, a road crew working ahead
Dylan, dressed in an orange vest, manning the slow/stop sign
She makes Corwin stop, leans in to apologize for the delay
Behind the Mercedes, Natalie sneaks up

She hoists in a large duffel bag, then shuts herself inside

Natalie climbs out, only she's not Natalie anymore
She's become Corwin -- identical to the last detail

The Security Guard hits the button, releasing the gate
He goes back to his magazine as Corwin passes through

Tommy
You gonna let me through or what
Tommy the Guard looks up, sees Corwin is still at the counter
(confused) Oh
Yeah, sorry Mr
Corwin
He hits the button again, letting Corwin through
Tommy goes back to his magazine, still a little perplexed
- The same places we saw on the videotape
Natalie-as- Corwin swipes the two stolen failsafe cards in a reader, sending the lights from red to green
She splices in a transmitter the size of a cigarette pack
Pulls up a tiny antenna

He didn't even spot her

Now  know why  hired you
You're the best

They know it's true

She reaches for the laptop
Bosley snatches it away
Uh, actually Miss Wu,  will get to work on this right away
Any evidence we find will be turned over to you the proper authorities

Oh, indeed  do
And that's why 'll take very good care of it when  find it

Vivian, please
Do as the man says
Reluctantly, Vivian Wu pulls her hand away

She notices the other Angels staring at her
She doesn't answer at first
Um

Natalie quickly picks up what's going on
She glances at Alex, then clears her throat
Hey Dylan, can we talk to you for a second
Natalie, Alex, and Dylan kibbitz near the sinks

She doesn't have  point, Alex, can't believe you're siding with her

Oh come on, Charlie wouldn't care think you're just being overly cautious

Just as he's about to lift the handle, he stops
Looks back over his shoulder
Did he hear something
He scans the empty garage
No one in sight
Must've been his imagination

So, now we have the transmitter, what do we do with fat boy
Dirt nap time
Not until 've got the information  need
We'll take him to the compound, hold him there

Whenever you say something like that, it means more work for me

We can't afford them jeopardizing our plans
Here it comes
(coldly) We have to Kill Charlie's Angels
The Thin Man sighs, whips out his cell phone
Guess 'll cancel my weekend plans
And speaking of weekend plans

He wipes off a little, puts it on her tongue
Finally convinced, she almost lets herself laugh

She looks both ways
If she tries to break for the open loading door, she'll lead the gunmen right back to Jason
Only way out of here is to head for the far wall, all the way across the building, where there's a fire exit
Taking a deep breath, she darts across the fake street
fire at her, one of them pulling off his silencer and going to machine gun mode
The sound of the gunshots are covered by the sound of the effects guy, test firing guns outside

The Gunmen emerge from the stage and spot her, just as she gets the car started
She peels out as a hail of gunfire just misses her windshield
Jason has just gotten his squibs refitted
He's facing the opposite direction, so he doesn't see Alex's car whizz away in the background
Jason walks into the Soundstage, followed by the effects crew

Anyway, 'm not going to be an idiot and stand here talking when we could do something useful, like
Goodbye, Dylan, 'll miss you
How right he is, because as soon as Vivian squeezes the trigger
Dylan drops to the floor, then rolls
the bullet misses Dylan and slams into the bulletproof window causing a spider-web crack to spread
Dylan sees her opportunity and heads right for the window while Vivian pumps off shots
As she comes to the window, Dylan jumps up in the air and does a flying kick, hitting right at the spot where the bullet impacted
The bulletproof glass shatters outward, and Dylan flies out the window, onto the ledge
(') Wow
(to Vivian) 've never seen  do something like that
Oh, shut up
: - Dylan looks over the edge of the balcony
The drop-off is incredibly steep -- the house is built on stilts -- and the fall looks like it would kill her
But she doesn't have much choice

They rush to the edge, look down into a forbidding thicket of trees
She can't have survived
It's too far

Knox shakes his head
We've got more important things to do
The two of them head back inside
As they do
We hold on the railing, then slowly start to drift down, to the underside of the balcony
Dylan has attached her belt to the bottom of the railing, and is hanging in the rafters
As she pulls herself back up

Knox and Vivian Wu emerge, then hustle into a waiting private plane
Natalie, Dylan and Alex nurse their wounds and compare notes
can't believe Knox tried to kill me
mean, 've been lied to, 've been cheated on, but no guy has ever tried to  me before
(coldly) 'm gonna get him for that
He played us from the very start
It was all just so he could get us to tap into Red Star
He couldn't figure out a way to do it himself
Who knew that we are actually tapping into the main servers for The National Security Agency
And now, thanks to us, he's had hours to download whatever top secret information he wants, for God knows what reason
The angels take a beat to let their indignation grow

That laptop was the only way to access the transmitter

Built into the green hills, it's flanked by oversized windmills

- Bosley's cell, as such, is a round room
Bosley flits about in a panic
He's hardly touched the gourmet food on his tray
Except for the pudding
He loves pudding

He watches a few moments of

We hear a  in the water, and then a
Curious, he stands up and looks in the bowl
He's surprised by what he sees

Come on, Bosley, answer

No answer

Don't
He's alive, he's gotta be
If

There's a very faint voice coming from Bosley's desk drawer
Dylan walks around the desk, yanks it open
(
) Angels
Angels, can you hear me
Dylan grabs the radio receiver from the drawer, holds him up
Bosley's voice gets louder

) (') don't know if you can hear me

Can we trace him
Not off a boosted signal
We'd have to be within 20 miles
Come on, Bosley
Tell us where you are

Knox and Vivian emerge

But not before we retrieved the information you wanted

(') The National Security Agency's secret file on the man known as Charles Townsend
Knox smiles
Takes the print-out
Finally
(beat) How about Bosley
Did we get the information we wanted
Once we we drugged him, he sang like a bird
The Thin Man hands Knox another print-out
Hmmm
Miami Arena
Preparations have been made
Yes
We move out tonight
Excellent

In the tower
We were waiting till you gave the word
Well
No time like the present
The Thin Man nods
- The Thin Man cocks his gun as he heads to the tower to do away with Bosley
Then
Sir
You should take a look at this
The Henchman leads Thin Man into

Henchman points to one in the corner

Look at the timer on the camera
It's not moving
(beat) Oh, this is the oldest one in the book
Punch up camera three
Another camera angle comes up, this also a view of the empty courtyard
(') Now pan left
The Henchman does what he's told and, on the monitor
, dressed in a black cat suit, as she rewires a security camera
She glances around, making sure no one sees her
(') The old re-loop the video camera trick
And look, she's not even carrying a gun
(beat) What is this, amateur hour
: - Dylan sneaks her way through the courtyard, doing an admirable job of trying to stick to the walls
As she comes around the corner
(
) Um, excuse me
think you're trespassing
She whips around to see the Thin Man, standing right behind her
She instantly swings at him, he blocks it
She's about to swing again when five guns get cocked against her temple
She's surrounded by guards
-- The thin man and his boys lead Dylan into the house
(') No offense, but as "storming the castle" plans go, this one sucked
Oh yeah
And  suppose you could do better
() '  - 8/18/99                                 81
: Yeah,  sure as hell could
Oh, right
How about an underwater entry
Or hang gliding over the main tower
There's a million good ways in, if you just do your homework
Dylan glares at him, and as she does
We move in   Dylan's funky belt buckle
There's a tiny camera concealed there
- Natalie and Alex huddle around a three-inch monitor, getting live video from Dylan's camera
You heard the man
Nice work, Dyl
They move into action
- Dylan is led inside by the Thin Man
Knox is waiting for her
Present for you, sir
Dylan, how nice
Welcome to my Florida home
Not as tasteful as the one in , but much more private
She shrugs off the goons -- enough already
So tell me, Knox, what's the brilliant plan
You gonna sell a list of our foreign spies to the highest bidder
Blackmail the President
The first plan is too complicated, and the second is virtually impossible

Revenge
Against who
You know what

've got a score to settle
He flips shut a suitcase filled with -5 explosive, the same stuff we saw Pascal selling in the opening scene
Seems like you're going a bit overboard
No, just leaving myself plenty of margin for error
Goodbye, Dylan
With that, he walks out of the room
The Thin Man signals to the Henchmen
Two of them force Dylan to sit in one of the wooden deck chairs
Then, with the thick packing tape, they begin binding her arms to the arms of the chair
As they do: don't know why you bother
've already won
Is that so
Every moment  sit here is a moment 'm using to figure out how to take you down
In fact, this statement -- this one 'm making right here-- is just me stalling for time while  decide which of your goons 'm going to flatten first
(whispering) It's gonna be the guy behind me
The Thin Man can't help but be amused
After all, there are six guards and one blonde -- who is now taped to a chair
() '  - 8/18/99                               83

By the time your guys are firing, 'll be at about 180 on my reverse inverted 360, which will land me on Fat Boy there, as promised
(nods to the second guard) He'll take the chair seat in the chin
(re: two others; very slowly) Now
'm warning both of you: 'm going to get you to shoot each other

Cliche as that sounds
(then to the last two) Last, you guys -- hell, 'll make something up
We'll have fun
The Thin Man smirks oh-so-confidently
And what will you do to me
You won't even be here
mean, don't want to tell you how to do your job, but you should've killed me by now
Because  already know that your people are onto my people, which means any moment now you're going to be called out to go and deal -- Suddenly the door flies open and -- (') Ah
See
We have intruders
With a glare to Dylan, the Thin Man follows him out
Alex, dressed in a sexy bikini, emerges from the water and instantly takes out two guards
- hang-glides into a courtyard, knocking out two henchmen as she does
Alex catches up with her, as Natalie pulls out a small scanner
() '  - 8/18/99                               84
: Bosley's close
You find him

Natalie heads left
Alex goes right
- Racing up the stairs, Natalie enters a round room with open windows on all sides
gentle breeze stirs the curtains
There's an amazing 360 degree view, from hills to ocean
According to her scanner, Bosley should be here, but there's no one
(yelling) Bosley, can you hear me
' Hearing her voice, the feral Bosley looks up
Natalie
Is that you
- She hears him
She keeps yelling -- so does he -- until they both realize that his room is above hers
How do  get up to you
There's a staircase
Look for a switch
She begins frantically checking the desk, the shelves, everything
Her cell phone
She answers it
Hello
Pete, hi
How are you
- On break, Pete is talking on a pay phone
'm good
just -- you said you wanted me to call
'  - 8/18/99                                85
- Natalie keeps checking the shelves, looking for a secret switch
did
do
mean, thank you for calling
'm not an insecure person or anything, and 've really enjoyed the very brief time we have spent together
Two  race up the stairs into the office
Natalie turns to face them
(') 'm just wondering if it's something  said or did that's making this whole thing so weird between us
The Goons approach
(into phone) Can you hold on a sec
Hitting , Natalie kicks the chair behind her and dives under the desk
She comes up on the other side with a , electric cords attached
She backhands it into the goons, who jerk and twitch as electricity shoots through their bodies
(') (un-muting) One more sec
She re-mutes
With a roundhouse kick, she flattens one of the goons, the other with the cell phone
The first goon charges at her, but she sidesteps at the last moment, leaving Goon One to hit Goon Two
Both men topple through the open window, falling
Yikes
(') (un-muting) Sorry about that
() '  - 8/18/99                              86
: Listen, is this a bad time
No
Not at all
She starts searching again for the switch
You just sound distracted
You know, work this week has been really busy
It's been hard to focus
, Vivian Wu reaches the top of the stairs
She moves stealthily
Natalie has no idea she's there
(') See, the thing is, 'm not a full- time waitress
should have been more up-front about that, it's just
At the last moment, Natalie catches a moving reflection in a shiny trophy
Turns to find Vivian Wu swinging an antique chair at her head
She ducks
The chair  the display case
Scrambling to get away, Natalie drops the phone
Natalie, what was that
(yelling to phone) Everything's fine
Hate to disagree
Vivian upends the desk, nearly crushing Natalie
Vivian jumps on top, ready to kick the shit out of our angel
As we probably suspected, Vivian Wu is one hell of a martial artist
Fortunately, so is Natalie
In their first series of blows, Vivian seems to have the upper hand, but Natalie rallies hard
Vivian surprises her with a floor-sweeping kick, knocking her down
Vivian grabs the phone off the floor
(') Is this the famous Charlie
() '  - 8/18/99                                87
: (confused) No, it's Pete
Vivian looks at the phone
Who the fuck cares
She throws the phone out the open window
Getting up, Natalie stares her down, incredulity building to rage
You bitch
like that guy
Mocking, Vivian wipes away a tear
Natalie lets forth a typhoon of fury, a full-out Mortal Kombat
Vivian is thrown back against the bookcase, where she knocks over a candlestick
That's the trigger for the bookcases to begin sinking into the floor
Circling around the room, each set of shelves drops to a different level, forming steps that lead to the upstairs room
As Natalie and Vivian continue to fight, Bosley sticks his head down from above, watching the brawl
Natalie is kicking ass
(') (to Vivian) Do you have any idea how difficult it is to find a quality man in Los Angeles
She slams Vivian into the wall
Grabs her again, hands around her head
To be honest
Vivian suddenly leans forward and  her, right on the lips
(') don't care
Natalie is surprised for a moment, which gives Vivian the chance to swing at her
She misses
can handle villainy
can even handle super-villainy
(Vivian swings and misses again) But what you did is just wrong
() '  - 8/18/99                              88
: She head-butts Vivian, knocking her out cold
She throws the limp body on the floor
beat, then Natalie looks up to see Bosley
(') (suddenly chipper) Hi, Bos
He waves
- From below, we hear
The compound has been breached
Dylan looks at the six armed guards surrounding her
Here we go
And now she does exactly what she told the Thin Man she'd do: She pitches forward, ducking her head so the chair's back crashes into the railing, tearing it off
She stands
(') Okay, that part worked
The Guards  -- but Dylan has already launched herself from the railing into that backflip, which lands her on the head of -- Fat Boy, flattening him bad, and smashing the rest of the chair into kindling
She grabs the wooden seat and whips it up, catching bullets from Guard #3 before flinging it like a Frisbee at Guard #2, nailing him right on the chin
Quickly she stands again, between Guards #3 and 4
(') Now, guys,  warned you
This is where you shoot each other
The two men scoff, disbelieving
Then Dylan does a head fake, both Guards panic, and fire, but Dylan drops, leaving each man a clear shot at the other
Both gape
Both fall
Just Guards #5 and 6 left
Dylan's chair arms are still taped to her forearms
(') Okay, here's where we improvise
In a whirl, she overhead-chops Guard #5
Drives her right arm into his shoulder while swinging her left arm into the back of the Guard #6's head
() '  - 8/18/99                                   89
: few more blows, then both men fall
Now Dylan drops into a second chair, half-exhausted, half-amused with herself
Has one brief beat to take it all in, then -- Bosley steps onto the veranda, sees Dylan sitting in the chair
: It looks like Dylan -- whose arms are still strapped to the arms of the first chair -- is taped to the chair she now sits in
Oh my God, let me help you
Bosley hurries over, "freeing her
" Amused, Dylan lets him
Natalie steps out from inside, pausing to  one guard who was starting to revive
: - Knox, carrying the briefcase bomb, gets into his waiting helicopter, followed closely by the Thin Man
Let's
The helicopter quick ascends, just as
(
) Damn
run into the courtyard
Don't worry, we'll get him
You don't understand
He's got a pound of -5 in that briefcase
The question is, where's he headed

) Miami
The three angels turn to see Bosley, huffing and puffing his way into the courtyard

He's going to blow up the arena and kill his target
Not that  don't believe you, but how exactly do you know all this
Because Angels,  was the one who purchased those tickets
But Bosley, you  sports, why would you
(suddenly getting it) You didn't buy them for yourself
You bought them for
Bosley lowers his head
Suddenly all the angels understand
They race out the courtyard, in hot pursuit

Running down the street, towards Miami Arena, the three angels pass    rollerblading by: ,   and
Nothing is said, but a cool moment just happened
: , ,  -- The three Angels are running down a very long hallway
Their voices are the only sound that echoes off these walls, although there is a faint humming that grows louder as they approach two, metal fire doors
What do you think he looks like

With black hair
No, silver hair
And tan
He's not George Hamilton
He's outside a lot
We'll know him when we see him, that's for sure
we see him
How hard can it be to spot Charlie
They slam into the doors, and we

The first thing that hits us is the   , the noise made by twenty thousand people in a basketball induced frenzy
The next thing that hits us is the sheer magnitude of the job facing the Angels
Hard to spot
The crowd is one, enormous, teeming mass of brightly colored humanity
Aw, shit
The game is in progress, Duke vs
North Carolina, and it's a barn burner
one point game with six minutes to go pulls up and swishes a three pointer, Duke by two
The crowd goes apeshit
The Angels huddle, yelling over the deafening noise of the crowd

The crowd

His luxury box is loaded with fellow Tar Heels and nameless studio executives
He repeatedly high fives a Hollywood type in sunglasses and Armani
Yes, yes
When suddenly, the door to the luxury box is flung open
(yelling) Charlie
Charles Townsend
Jason whips around and locks eyes with Alex
Alex
Jason
(beat) Shit
Realizing she has no time to explain, and that Charlie isn't in here, she turns and leaves
Hey
While everyone watches, confused, Jason pushes his way through the box and follows Alex into the hall
: '  - 8/18/99                               93

It's a crowd of fifteen cocktail-drinking Charles Townsend
Anybody, Charles Townsend
She ducks back into the hallway
-- Alex walks out into the hallway, frustrated
Then, miraculously, she spots him
He walks out of one of the luxury boxes, holding a large, metal briefcase
He heads for the elevator
immediately goes to intercept him, but
(
) Don't move
() '  - 8/18/99                                 94
: It's the Thin Man, standing behind her, with a gun in her back
(') You move, you say anything, perforate you
Got it
Knox glances back at the Thin Man, nods to him
Then he gets in the elevator
The Thin Man starts edging Alex towards some emergency exit doors, gun still in her back
Alex is trying to think of an escape, quickly
She knows that the second he gets her out of this public space, he's gonna shoot her
The door gets closer and closer
(
) Alex
Jesus, what is going on
The Thin Man and Alex turn around to face Jason, who is sweaty and exasperated from chasing her
Jason, hi,
The Thin Man digs the gun deeper into her back
(') Can  talk to you later
No you can talk to me
want to know what the hell is going on
First, you disappear with no explanation, not even a goodbye
'm sorry,
Now,  see you here, but you're with some other guy
Hey, movie star, do yourself a favor and get lost
Jason double takes
He's not used to someone talking to him like that
Lemme guess
You must be Charlie
Jason, please

: No, no 'm sick of this shit
'm sick of this asshole telling you what you can and can't do
And then, with no warning, he hauls off and punches the Thin Man
Now, Jason's just an actor, not an ass-kicking super detective, so his punch isn't all that great
In fact, it leaves Jason shaking his hand in pain
The Thin Man, a trickle of blood running from his lip, smiles
That was stupid
First, he pops Jason right in the jaw
Jason stumbles backward, dazed
Then he reaches for his gun, in the process, loosening his grip on Alex
Jason, get down
Alex spins out of the Thin Man's grasp and does a full roundhouse kick, knocking the gun out of the Thin Man's hands
The Thin Man immediately responds, throwing two quick punches, which Alex expertly blocks and then follows with a hitch-kick to the chin
Jason, dazed and confused, thinks he must be hallucinating
What the hell is going on
What's going on is a world class ass-kicking, courtesy of his girlfriend
While the action star watches in amazement, Alex unloads an arsenal of bad ass kung fu moves that would make Jet Li green with envy
The Thin Man doesn't stand a chance
flying side kick sends him stumbling backwards into the stairwell
We follow the fight
-- to the first landing
The Thin Man, battered and bruised, reaches down to his ankle holster to get his spare gun, but Alex is too fast for him
She stamps on his hand, then drops a knee to his throat
Right now, just by leaning forward, could crush your windpipe
You'd die a slow and painful death
You don't want that, do you
() '  - 8/18/99                                96
: The Thin Man shakes his head "no
" (') Where is the bomb, when's it going off
She presses harder
Jason slams out into the stairwell, looking for Alex
He finds her on her walkie talkie, the Thin Man handcuffed to the staircase
Hi, Jason
Gimme one second
Jason nods, sure
We go to another triptych, all three Angels on their cell phones in different parts of arena
(') Angels
Knox planted the bomb in the basement, and it's timed to go off when the game clock hits zero
(
) Roger that, Alex, 'll stop the clock
(
) 'll look for the bomb
Alex turns back to Jason
He's clearly having a difficult time processing everything he's just seen
lied to you Jason
'm not a secretary
Yeah,  can see that
(referring to the Thin Man) And that wasn't Charlie
Right
'm actually here to stop a madman from killing everyone in this building
Would it be okay if we talked later

: Go save the world, honey

Alex smiles
Runs off
Natalie stares up at the clock

The
Time out
Whew, that was close
But it'll start up any second
She has to keep it stopped
But how
She glances to the sidelines and gets an idea
-- starts from overhead, the respective teams' cheerleaders coming out for one last routine
As they kick into gear, Natalie comes out with them, dressed as a Duke cheerleader
She follows along with the dancers, a bit timid at first, then more confident as she gets into it
-- Dylan races through the basement, looking for the briefcase
Then she spots it, hooked into some wires that snake up into ceiling above
Dylan approaches it cautiously
She slowly opens the top
(to herself) Alright, Dylan, all we have to do is figure out which wire to cut
-- there are about fifty different wires, in every color in the Crayola box
(') Oh, shit
Alex, still searching for Charlie, notices something strange
You're kidding me

She's better

The Cheerleaders vacate the court, but Natalie keeps dancing her heart out
She has 18,000 fans watching her, and she's totally in the moment
But there's another agenda as well
The time out is over, but one cheerleader doesn't seem to notice
Officials can't start the clock again while she's on the court
: -- Dylan has picked two wires
Chartreuse and magenta
This has gotta be it
She prepares to snip them with her wire cutters, when
(
) wouldn't do that, if  were you
She spins to see Knox, standing behind her
(') See, if you snip  of those wires, the bomb  blow up
It's gonna blow anyway, once the clock gets to zero
Who told you that, my idiotic henchman
Do you think  tell him that's confidential
He holds up a small
It's the same one we saw Pascal try to sell in the opening scene
(') is what triggers that bomb
So if you'll kindly step away, 'll refrain from killing both of us

: Realizing she has no choice, Dylan stands up and backs away
(') In different circumstances, Dylan, think you and  could have worked out
We have a lot in common
Yeah,  fall for assholes, and you one
Knox laughs
Good one
(beat, as he backs up) Well,  must be going
If you like your body parts attached to your torso,  suggest you do the same
Knox turns to go, but the other Angels are blocking his way
Give it up, Knox
You're surrounded
Give us the detonator
Stumbling backwards, Knox holds it up high
(') 'll blow this building sky high,  swear
(
) Don't do it, Eric
It's me you want, not all these innocent people
Everyone turns, as one, to a figure emerging from the shadows
Charlie
That's right, it's Charlie
Finally, after all these years, we get a look at him, and boy is it
disappointing
He's not what we expected
Short, portly, dressed in a "We're #1" t-shirt; the Angels are absolutely floored by Charlie's appearance
Charlie
Charlie ignores their stares and addresses Knox directly
() '  - 8/18/99                                 100
: Your father was a double agent, Eric
Yes,  revealed him, but he was killed by his own people before we could throw him in jail
(beat) He was my friend
It's still your fault, you arrogant prick
You still killed my father
Maybe
Maybe  did
But why should kill all these people
If you hate me so much, just shoot
Just shoot me, Eric
Charlie spreads his arms, leaving Knox a plenty wide target
It's a horribly tense moment
The Angels are frozen, watching Knox decide Charlie's fate
Knox is sweating, debating his choices
Can he really do this
Charlie's not the glamorous, smug asshole he imagined
He starts lowering his gun
Okay
You're right
(quickly) 'll just kill you
It all happens in the blink of an eye
Knox fires, hitting Charlie in the chest
Natalie leaps out and tackles Knox
Alex dives and grabs the detonator, before it has a chance to go off
Dylan runs to Charlie's side
Charlie, no
She hold shim in her arms as the other Angels gather round their fallen leader
He gasps for air
(') He's trying to say something
Then Dylan notices something weird
He's not gasping for air, there's something stuck in his mouth
With a great, hacking cough, he spits it out
It's a voice chip, like the one Dylan used in the opening scene
() '  - 8/18/99                                101
: Ucch, that tasted terrible
The voice isn't Charlie's
Dylan reaches down and rips off Charlie's mask, revealing
Bosley
Are you okay
Think so
He pulls back the padding from the suit, revealing a small wound where the bullet grazed his side
(') Hurts, but it looks like it'll heel
Dylan laughs, Alex ruffles his hair
Hey, wait a second
If Bosley's here
then where's Charlie
The Angels all look at each other
No one knows
- In gorgeous  , the three angels walk side-by-side with a calm assurance, fireballs exploding behind them
They won
As  rises, the   descends, then peels away to reveal
- The angels kick back on the white sands, tropical drinks in- hand
Bosley is there as well, with a grass hat and zinc on his sniffer
Charlie is on the cellular speakerphone
' Great work, angels
You'll be happy to know you received another presidential commendation
The Angels, and Bosley, clink glasses
'  (') Enjoy your vacation, angels
Thank you Charlie
() '  - 8/18/99                                102
: They toast the speakerphone
' Alex, Natalie --  know you've been putting in some long hours on this case, so  thought you might enjoy a chance to catch up with some old friends
walking across the beach towards them
Each is carrying a drink of his own
They wave
Damn those men look good
Alex and Natalie share a smile
Any chance you'll be joining us, Charlie
: We're in Charlie's point-of-view
We can see part of his reflection in the window -- not enough to see his face, but we get some sense of the man
He turns away, begins walking
Steps down onto the sand
(to cell phone) 'd love to, Angels
But  have some precious treasures to watch over
With that, he hangs up
We stay in his
, walking across the beach
And it's not just any beach
, approaching
We're on the same beach
Looking right, we see the backs of the Angels and Bosley
They have no idea that Charlie is walking right behind them
beat, then Dylan looks back
She looks directly as us -- at Charlie -- tracking as we move past
Does she somehow recognize it's Charlie
From her reaction, it's not clear
beat, then we
'  - 8/18/99                            103
/
Dylan looks back forward again
Did she just see Charlie
Her smile tells us she thinks she did
She raises a toast
To Charlie
To Charlie
They knock glasses
Right at the moment we should probably fade out, Bosley spills his icy drink in his lap
His eyes go wide
The Angels just have to laugh
We  , then
