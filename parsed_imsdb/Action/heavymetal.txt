- by Dan Goldberg & Len Blum - Final Draft - Dan Goldberg and Len Blum July 18, 1980 beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun
As the camera skims overtop, titles start to roll
Ahead of us an odd-looking service van comes into view, sputtering along a dirt road
Getting closer, we can see the driver, a thin, bookish man with a neat mustache
This is
The truck pulls up to a strange Victorian house in the middle of the wheatfield
The house has several futuristic radar devices on the roof that rotate constantly
gets out, opens the van's rear doors, and pulls out two large metal boxes
The curtains part ever so slightly, and a pair of eyes peer down
shuts the van's rear doors, and carries the two metal boxes into the house
The titles stop rolling as we; is reading a schematic diagram as he sits in front of the exposed chassis of a complicated futuristic electronic contraption, twice his size
There are strange tools all over the floor
Putting down the diagram, he opens one of the metal cases and takes out a sophisticated-looking glass sphere with electronic receptacles mounted in the sides
He places this sphere in a space in the middle of the contraption, clamps it down, and plugs some wires into the globe's receptacles
Then he opens the second box
Inside is a glowing green ball
Using a pair of special tongs,  carefully lifts the ball out, and inserts it into an opening at the base of the machine, in the back
As soon as the ball is inside, the machine hums to life
The glass sphere sparkles, and a holographic picture of a green planet in space appears inside it
(looking at the holograph) Hmmmm
He takes a strange tool, and moves out of frame to make an adjustment underneath the machine
Suddenly a wire comes loose from the sphere and begins to spark
(seeing sparks) Uh - oh
As the camera pulls closer to the holograph screen, the green planet begins to silently shake
With an explosion that rocks the universe, a huge chunk rips out of the green planet and shoots off into space, leaving thousands of glowing particles in its wake
Not noticing the silent image on the holograph, he quickly repairs the sparkling connection and returns to his other adjustments
From the forest floor we see the green planetoid fly overhead, dropping balls
We watch as it moves away and disappears beyond a far-off mountain range
The forest rumbles as the planetoid crashes in the distance
The camera then pans over to a forest patch, where a beautiful girl approaches, picking mushrooms
An ominous note is struck as the girl notices the glowing ball, and is drawn to it
Picking the sphere up, she looks at it
Something inside her warns her of its danger, but, unable to resist, she puts it in her basket and continues on
Night falls over this futuristic chromoid city as the beautiful girl passes through the glass gates and heads home
' The girl yawns and gets into bed as the camera pans over to her basket in the corner
Through its side, the green ball begins to glow brightly
Getting closer, we see a slimy silk-like webbing ooze out of the ball and move towards the sleeping girl, pulling the green ball behind it
The ball starts to glow and pulse as the webbing begins to surround the girl, like a cocoon
Slowly the camera pans up the wall, and moves out through the window, and beyond the city gates, rising higher and higher
Flying quickly overtop futuristic villages, the camera heads further and further out into the less civilized sectors, where the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility stations of a past civilization have been overgrown by scrub-bush and weeds
The camera zooms across this strange landscape toward the distant mountains where the huge planetoid fell
Finally, from high above the foothills, we begin to come down
In the hills below us, hundreds of blue humanoid barbarians are moving along, mesmerized, toward a pulsing green glow high in the mountaintops
Suddenly the mountains begin to rumble
At the front of the line, the largest barbarian - obviously their leader - stops and points
strange, green, foamy liquid comes pouring down the mountains toward the barbarians
The barbarians stand frozen as the foam washes over them and keeps on going
One by one, their eyes turn green and they start to change, becoming hairier, uglier, and stronger
As their transformations are complete, the barbarians gather behind their leader into an ever-growing mob of murderous looking sub-humans
frightened Kraanian councillor spurs his horse forward through the beautiful glass gates, as in the distance we hear the sound of ten thousand approaching footsteps
The camera pans to a hillside overlooking Kraan
In the glow of sunset, the outline of the  , riding a black war-horse, appears at the hillside and stops
Then with a thundering of footsteps, the outline of five thousand barbarians comes into view behind him, filling the horizon
He is now wearing a strange medallion around his neck as, wild- eyed, he screams to signal the attack
The bloodthirsty horde charges down the hill behind him
The camera moves with the barbarians as they crash through the gates of the city, destroying everything in their path
Smoke and flames are everywhere
Ahead of us, terrified Kraanians run from the onslaught
As we track up over the burning rooftops, we see the riding his war-horse in the streets below
Shouting a command, he waves his men on as they move toward an impressive doomed building in the middle of the city
At the far end of this huge glass hall, the Kraanian Council sits around a marble table
From outside, we hear the battle raging
Pulling closer we can hear the worried voices of the Council members
#3 They're killing everyone
We must escape
#2 The city is burning
#4 (throwing a parchment before the Elder) Even the mountains glow green and an evil slime oozes down
#1 Elder, we must arm ourselves
We must fight Silence
Everyone gets quiet
Looking at the parchment thrown before him, the ancient, withered  rises to his feet
We are not a race of warriors
We are statesmen, and scientists
From our very beginning it was ordained that the warrior-race of Taarak the Defender would aid us in times of need
This was the Pact #1 Taarak the Defender
His race is dead They cannot defend anyone
#2 Some say that the race is not dead - that one still lives
#1 One
What good is one One of Taarak's blood can do much
Outside, the sounds of battle grow louder
boy appears at the doorway
Elder
They are at the walls
#3 Well who is this last Defender
How can he be summoned
It is Taarna, of the blood of Taarak the Defender - the last of the race
And must be summoned as my forefathers summoned Taarak himself - from within #2 But will this Defender answer
Taarakian has no choice
They must answer
It is in their blood
The clattering of armour becomes audible
They are in the halls
They are coming
(calmly to the boy) Bar the door
(to the Councilmen) We will summon the Defender together
The Councilmen nod
(shutting eyes) Taarna
Taarna
As the Councilmen take up the chant; As the boy begins to bar the door, it bursts open, flinging him aside
Standing in the doorway, surrounded by his men, is the
With a laugh, he raises a Medieval-looking multiple cross-bow and fires a burst of arrows into the boy's chest, as the crazed troops rush in around him
The chanting continues as we; We look down over this uncivilized wilderness with only decaying pipelines and the occasional jagged rock structure breaking the barren uniformity of the land
As the Council's distant chanting fades out, all is quiet
Suddenly from behind us, we hear the sound of flapping wings and a huge rush of air
Just above our heads, comes flying in, sitting proudly in the saddle of a giant crimson bird
' She is beautiful, with dark eyes and wild red hair blowing behind her in the wind
Below her, on the ground, she sees a humanoid running in terror, chased by an ugly, four-legged mutant creature
Spurring her bird forward,  sweeps down over the ugly beast and lassoes it
She then hoists the creature up into the air and, tossing her end of the rope over a tall jagged rock, she leaves the snarling beast hanging helplessly
Flying down to the grateful humanoid, she dismounts
As she approaches we see that he has a barbarian medallion on a chain around his neck
owe you my life
Let me repay you
He takes off his medallion and places it around her neck
Suddenly he twists the chain tight in his hand, pulling her towards him
His eyes change to a bright green as he forces her to the ground and starts ripping at her clothes
As he molests her,  is distracted
She hears something - voices inside her, chanting her name
Quickly she grabs the chain and rips it apart
Then she powerfully smashes both her hands together around her attacker's ears
As he holds his ringing ears, she gets up, lifts him above her head, and hurls him mercilessly to the ground
Still hearing the chanting, she jumps on her bird, pulls out a second rope, and lassoes the barbarian's feet
She then lifts him up and leaves him hanging from the tall, jagged rock, next to the growling creature
As  flies off, the hanging beast eyes the barbarian hungrily
He is still sitting on the floor, working on his machine
As the camera pulls closer, we see that  is reaching deep inside the machineworks, trying to solder a small orange diode in place with an odd-style soldering iron
The connection breaks, and the diode and some hot solder fall deeper into the machine and start smoking and sputtering
As the smoke grows thicker, the machine starts to buzz loudly
Dammit
pulls his face out of the smoking chassis, grabs a pair of needlenose pliers, and reaches back to retrieve the part
The camera follows ' arm into the chassis, where smoke surrounds it and clouds over everything
The buzzing sound grows, and changes into the sound of powerful, throbbing engines
Slowly the smoke begins to clear as we hear a voice crackling over a radiophone
(
) Where the hell are we
Suddenly the smoke dissipates and a formation of -17 bombers come tearing out into the moonlit night
The sound of jungle night creatures fills the air
We see palm trees silhouetted against the moon bright sky
The scene is almost serene
The camera pans and suddenly the nose of a large parked bomber fills the screen, and as the camera continues panning, we pass a large red rising sun on the bomber's fuselage
The pan stops at the tail of the aircraft, and we see a Japanese soldier - a guard
There is a moment of tranquillity, as jungle sounds fill the air
The soldier almost dozes
suddenly the cacophony of sound stops, and for a brief moment there is complete silence then with an agonizing wail an air raid siren shatters the silence and the guard looks skyward, startled
Instantly all hell breaks loose as we hear pounding feet
Silhouetted figures rush by
Japanese soldiers crank the barrel of an anti-aircraft gun skyward
We begin to hear the sound of approaching engines
It is thrust into a breech
-17 As the bombers press on, the camera moves in to the lead aircraft
In the moonlight we see her name, "Pacific Pearl"
-  " " We're there Stepek, right on target
Rabual dead ahead
Suddenly a cacophony of explosions split the air as anti-aircraft shells explode ahead of the aircraft, lighting the inside with electric blue flashes
Gee
Thanks for telling me, Holden
thought it was Cleveland
Ackack guns blast shells skyward
The gun blasts light up the palm tree background, causing momentary silhouettes
For Christ sake, hold her steady
He can be seen from outside the plane as the shell flashes light up his turret
Quit yer bitching Stepek, just drop 'em and let's get outta here
Keep your shirts on guys, tonight 'm gonna hit something
(he settles over the bomb sight) Left two degrees
steady
steady
The flak is severe, with electric blue flashes lighting up the fuselage interior
Hey kid, how ya doing back there
Tailgunner momentarily lit with a shell burst, he's scared shitless
He looks nervously back behind the aircraft at the flak puffs behind the tail
Gulp, ah
'm ah
okay think
(
) Button it up, we're almost there
He is crouched over his bomb-sights, concentrating
(
) 'mon Stepek, there's the whole island of Rabaul down there, you can't miss
Screw you
' Suddenly a shell explodes almost on the windshield and the pilot rears back with the blast
The right windshield is shattered
We took a hit
The co-pilot sags forward, held back only by his shoulder straps
His eyes stare
Blood runs from under his helmet
We know he is dead
Shit
Elkhorn just bought it
(
) We took one back here too
'mon Stepek, blast 'em
(hand on the release button) Steady
steady
bombs away
Let's get the hell outta here
We hear the shriek of descending bombs
The explosions walk across the airfield, and in the light of the explosions we see devastation
The last bomb hits a fuel dump, causing an enormous ball of fire
(
) Yahoo
Bullseye
(exhilarated) Nice shooting Stepek, how are the rest of you guys
(
) Flight Engineer okay
(
) Radio okay
(
) Navigator check
(
) Belly okay
(
) Ah
tail okay
There is abrupt silence
Bellson
Lewis
Still silence, no reply from either name
Kid, check the waist positions, see if they're okay
Yeah
will do, skipper
crosses himself, then exits back into the body of the machine
(wearily) Let's go home
We hear jumbled comments from all positions
Everyone is happy
(
) Cheers and whoops
The mood of high spirits is stopped abruptly as the tailgunner reports back
(
) Skipper, Bellson and Lewis are both dead
This is the first time the kid's voice is not scared, just puzzled
Dammit
(
) Well kid, now you got a real bombing mission under your belt
He removes his oxygen mask and takes a long swig from a bottle
-  " " She rejoins the rest of the group
The formation is not quite as tight as before
As the formation flies along, puffs of cloud pass by, occasionally obscuring a machine
" " Under the "Pacific Pearl's" belly, we see the bellygunner suspended in his small glass pod
red glow brightens up as he drags on a cigar
The rest of the formation are visible stretched to the side and behind as puffs of cloud waft past
We begin to feel as if the weather might be changing
" " The  is relaxing inside as he swigs from the bottle and sings raucously
From the front we look in on the pilot with the dead co-pilot sagging in his seat next to him
(
) Sorry about Elkhorn, skip
What happened
dunno
The shell exploded and he collapsed
think he took it in the head
(
) Are ya sure he's dead, Skipper
He's dead
(sings drunkenly) Oh  put my finger in a woodpecker's hole and the woodpecker said God bless my soul; take it out, take it out, take it out, remove it
(bolder) Hey Stepek, just shut up, okay
Up yours kid, wassa matter, you don't like my voice
While all this banter has been going on the cloud has been thickening
Suddenly a serious voice cuts in on the small talk
It's the
(
) Something's wrong
He is frantically tapping the compass
(
) You got a problem, Holden
(
) Naw, the kid's the one with the problem
He don't like my voice
(
) Button it up Stepek
What's the problem, Holden
must have a malfunction, my compass says we're heading north
He looks at his compass
Mine says east
(
) Hey, can you guys see the rest of the squadron
(
) Negative, there's too much cloud
sudden flash of lightning illuminates the whole inside of the plane
The dead co-pilot's pale face is momentarily electric blue, lit by the lightning flash
We pan past him to the compass in the instrument panel
It is spinning madly
What the hell
He reaches forward to tap the compass
Hey Holden, now my compass has gone crazy
It's spinning like a son of a bitch
(
) Mine too, we must have hit a magnetic field or something
We see a dull glow coming from all crew positions from the on-board lights
Suddenly a curtain of rain lashes the machine
(
) Christ, now they're all doing it
All the dials are going haywire
Above the instrument panel we see the windshield is spattered with rain
(
) You guys quit talking business
'm trying to sing here
Oh put my finger in a woodpecker's
(irritably) Can it Stepek, we got real problems
Just then through the rain, a strange green glow is seen in the distance
It begins to curve toward the aircraft
- The turret swings as the gunner spots the glow
Jesus
Look at that
From under the starboard wing, we see the object approaching
(
) Look at what
look at what
It's out there, just look at it
(
) For Christ sake, give us a position
It's about four o'clock, just below Holy Shit, it's coming right at us
The glow suddenly zooms at the plane with great speed and hits the starboard inner engine
' He has to push the dead co-pilot back to peer out the broken starboard window
the number three prop is bent and windmilling wildly
It has a strange green luminescence about it
the whole machine shakes
Damn
The  tries to fly the plane and do the co-pilot's job of feathering the bad engine
Suddenly it's too late as the prop wobbles loose and cartwheels over the wing
The prop flies back and slices a great gash in the aircraft's skin, near the ' position
We lost the goddamned prop
Did it do any damage
Kid, check the tail
Silence
Come in kid
kid are you okay
Silence
Travis; go check the back
(
) Will do, skipper
' turret opens and  pulls himself up into the fuselage
The gauges are now settled except for the oil pressure to No
2 engine
The pressure drops
The engine heat gauge climbs rapidly
red warning light begins to flash
(to himself) Goddamn it, now what
He glances out of his window just in time to see a strange, claw-like feeler coming out of the engine casing
It detaches one of the cooling gills, then another, and another
They blow away in the slipstream
Gremlins
(rubbing his eyes) Jesus,  must be getting tired
He looks in to the kid's reargun compartment
All that is left of him is a tattered skeleton
turns, horror frozen on his face
Quick as a flash, from seemingly nowhere, something flies at him and grabs his throat
The mask on his face falls off, and we get a split second look of abject horror as he falls out of frame
(
) Travis, what's goin' on back there
His eyes are open but he is obviously dead
Through his helmet headphone, we hear his name
Holden, how far to base
(
) Skip, with everything screwed up here, 'd, 'd guess about two hundred miles
All the time the engine pops and bangs wildly
For Christ's sake, find us a place can put her down
It's all ocean down there, skip
Mack, can you get us a radio fix
Negative skip, too much interference
He is fighting the controls
Shit
've gotta put her down
Hey Holden
ya old stuff shirt
ya wanna snort
(
) For God sakes Stepek, shut up
takes another swig from his bottle
He is lying on his back partly propped up by the curving nose of the aircraft
He is about to make another smart ass reply, when he hears a strange scratching and chirping noise above his head
He looks up in time to see sharp teeth and claws start to appear through the lining above his head
He blinks in disbelief and throws his bottle away as if the image came from the whiskey
Oh my God, there's
there's
ahh
keep away
keep away
(struggles) hey no
hey somebody
(screams) (
) Stepek, you stupid sonovabitch, will you lay off the booze, you've got the 's
is wide-eyed and scared silly as the sound now begins under his feet and pincers begin to snip through the floor
He suddenly realizes that the whole floor is giving way beneath him, and he grabs for a handful of cables as the floor collapses
The lower half of  is hanging in the slipstream, kicking madly
We see that his legs are covered in wriggling creatures
He is losing his grip with one hand, but still desperately clinging on to a bunch of cables with the other
Suddenly an ugly pincer cuts the cables and  is gone
out into the night
Suddenly the No
2 engine begins to backfire, blasting back large gobs of orange flame
The oil, heat and manifold gauges are off the dial and red lights frantically flash
Desperately the  looks out of the window
Pieces begin flying off the engine
The cowling disintegrates revealing the bare engine beneath
Small figures are frantically busy ripping the engine to pieces
He is scared
Holden, for God's sake get up here on the double
(
) What's the problem, skip
Just get up here
The  grimaces as he pushes past the dead co-pilot
What is it, skip
(looking out windows) Hold 'em off
'm taking her down
He peers out at the incredible sight of the creatures ripping off the wing skin and tearing huge plates from the cowlings
The camera pans down to his feet as the hatch door handle twists and then bursts open
dozen bat-like creatures swarm in
The  panics and reaches up, grabbing the flare gun from its rack
He screams as the creatures attack and shoots right through the creatures, bathing the aircraft with a bright ruby glow
(struggling) Okay you little bastards
shit
(screams) The flare shoots down the fuselage and smashes into him
Wreathed in flames, he falls back into the fuselage
Creatures swarm all over the plane
The ball turret falls off
wheel suddenly lowers, then falls off
flap flutters free and blows away
Oil streams back into the slipstream and sections of the skin of the plane come away, revealing the skeleton framework of the fuselage
He is fighting the controls
Creatures are now in the cockpit, plucking out the instruments
The  reaches to the throttle only to grab a creature that locks on to his gloved hand
Flying the plane with his good hand, he strikes and pummels at the attacking creatures with the other
It is now almost a flying skeleton
For the first time, we see that it is heading for an island
figure detaches itself from the machine and plummets away
He falls, terror-stricken, through space
Finally his chute opens
slimy creature still clings to his gloved hand
He rips off the glove and throws it and the creature away
(struggling) Jesus
Christ
The approaching smoking plane bellies onto the sea, bounces, then skims along the wave tops, careening up onto the beach, where it twists around crazily before coming to a lopsided stop
The machine faces us head-on and we see a glow coming from what's left of No
3 engine
The camera zooms in rapidly to a green ball stuck in engine No
3
He has landed, and is undoing his parachute harness
He looks around incredulously
The island is a junkyard - a veritable graveyard of aircrafts
There are many aircrafts, both old wrecks and futuristic-looking ones lying everywhere
Skeletal corpses are still left in some of the wrecks
The camera pans to the remains of one machine
It is an old American Lockheed Electra
It glints dull in the half light of dawn
Painted on its side are two names; "Amelia Earhart" and "Fred Noonan"
The camera continues to move through this panorama of metallic junk until it stops on a long chrome rod sticking up out of a pile of scrap
Tilting up to the sky we see the clouds part as two gargantuan metal arms emerge and descend down toward the junkpile
The metal arms reach the chrome rod, grip it tightly, and begin to lift it up
WWe follow as the cylinder is pulled higher and higher, finally coming to a stop in front of a giant eyeball
The camera pulls back to reveal that the eyeball belongs to  , who carefully scrutinizes the orange diode held tightly in his needlenose pliers
Got it
Satisfied that this is the piece he had lost in the machine, he begins to re-solder it in place
Behind him, a with red hair comes into the room and walks up to him
It's broken again, isn't it Daddy
(concentrating) Yes dear
But Daddy's fixing it
(hums) (watching) How come it's always breaking
don't know, sweetheart
Mmmmhmm
When it's fixed, will you make more funny pictures for me
Honey, why don't you go play with your toys and let Daddy finish his work, okay
Mmmm
Okay
The   wanders around to the other side of the machine, as  flips a switch
Once again the glass sphere sparkles and the holographic screen lights up
uses a tool to fine-tune the holograph and an image begins to materialize; the glass gates of Kraan
As the image becomes clearer, the camera pulls closer and closer to the holograph screen
The Council's voices still ringing in her head,  flies in over the demolished gates
Below her, the once-beautiful city lies in ruins
Gliding overtop the deserted streets, she sees a column of smoke rising through the wrecked dome of the building in the town's center
As she watches the smoke rise, she pulls hard on the reins, and heads her bird up
The camera follows as she rides in through the shattered dome down to the Council Chambers below
Corpses of the Councilmen are strewn everywhere
In the center of the room, a large pile of ancient books and manuscripts lie smouldering
Reaching the floor, dismounts and starts to look around
At the head of the marble table sits the  - dead
In front of him, a roll of parchment lies on the table
opens it
Carefully painted on the parchment is a circle of mountains, their tops glowing green
looks at it, and puts it in her sack
Then she notices that the  is clutching something in his hand
Prying his stiff fingers apart, she finds a blood-stained medallion just like the one her attacker wore on his chain
Looking at the dead ,  grips the medallion tightly in her hand
flies back out through the shattered dome and surveys the city below
All is quiet and dark, except for a green glow coming from a second-floor window
Curious, she flies over, pulls up beside the window, and climbs in
' Entering,  sees the slimy silk-like cocoon on the bed
The basket of fruit still sits on the floor
From within the webbing, the green ball is glowing brightly
looks at the parchment in her sack, then at the glow coming from the cocoon
Cautiously, she approaches the cocoon, sword drawn
Suddenly a hand from within the cocoon grabs the ball and shoots forward, ripping through the webbing and holding the ball up to 's face
The hand belongs to a hideously ugly witch, who emerges from the cocoon, cackling through snake-like fangs
Behold
The Sphere of Uluhtec
Look upon it, Taarna
Look upon it with fear
For in its glow lies the end of heaven - the beginning of hell
Take it Taarna
Feel death in your hands
For death is upon you
And as you perish
so dies your race
The witch's eyes go green
(screaming) Take it
She hurls tha ball at , who dodges it
The ball sails past her, out the window
Then , sword raised, leaps at the , slicing through her in rapid strokes
The  cackles and crumbles into dust, but her green eyes stay suspended in the air, and her cackle echoes through the room
backs away, climbing out the window, onto her bird
As she flies off, she sees the ' green ball high above her, rising into the clouds and disappearing
The ' green ball zooms through space, as Earth appears in the distance
Then another object comes into sight
Getting closer we see that is is a modern winged rocketplane of no determinable nationality, soaring high above Earth
The green meteorite passes, briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow
The rocketplane banks sharply, then stabilizes
Slowly the hatch-doors in its belly open up, revealing the underside of an automobile suspended in the open hatch
Hydraulic metal arms emerge, lowering the automobile out from the belly of the cruising rocketplane
We can see now that the car is a white, '59 Corvette convertible
With a "thunk", the metal arms release the car, and as the rocketplane blasts away, the Corvette begins its free-fall to Earth
As the car falls gracefully through space, the driver plays with the wheel, causing the Corvette to bank smoothly one way, then the other
Once his direction is stable, the driver clicks on the car radio and adjusts it through various channels, until he settles on one
With the music playing, the car falls closer and closer to Earth, entering and emerging from the cloud cover over the atmosphere
In the heat of entry the vehicle's paint starts burning up
As he heads down over a deserted area, the driver begins his approach
Touching down at breakneck speed, the smoking Corvette bounces violently, every part straining at the repeated impact
The driver's face is expressionless as he jams the car into high gear and floors it, spinning the wheels in an attempt to translate downward momentum into forward motion
Then he pops his drag chute to help slow down
TThis accomplished, the expressionless driver releases the chute, and speeds off down the road in a cloud of dust
- From high above the building we see a crowd of reporters and
newsmen waiting on the front steps
The '59 Corvette pulls up at the curb below, and seeing it, the reporters all start to run over
The camera zooms down and into the car
Inside, the driver reaches over, unplugs a rubber hose, and loosens the two large hex-nuts which connect him to the car
As he gets out, the reporters come running up
(to driver) Doctor Anrak, six more mutants were sighted in Arizona this morning
Do you still say this has nothing to do with the green radiation from space
The driver walks on without speaking
(walking alongside) Doctor, is it true that the President himself pulled you off the Jupiter Six Project so that you could investigate those mutations
Doctor, answer me that
He ignores the question, and walks past the guard into the Pentagon
- Around a large table sit the Joint Chiefs of Staff, members of the Cabinet, and a pretty secretary wearing a tight skirt
An argument is in progress as the expressionless enters
The camera follows him as he sits down next to one of the Generals
well what  wanna know is, what's the Army doing about this
Hell
My constiuents are turning green
They're growing arms on their backs
There's something or someone up there in space and the voters have a right to know about it
Senator, we have no proof that these mutations are the result of interference from outer space
In fact, Doctor Anrak has just come in, so let's hear what he has to say
Doctor
The room goes silent as the  stands up
First of all, there is no cause for alarm
As for the theories of interference by alien beings, it is my firm opinion that we on Earth are the only intelligent, technically advanced civilization present in the universe
An enormous round spaceship the size of Pittsburg hovers overhead
and whatever is causing these mutations is not from outer space
it's more likely just an isolated biological pheno
pheno
ph
ph
ph
Suddenly the ' head starts to jerk from side to side
Everyone looks on, not knowing how to react
As the begins to move in short bursts, like a broken robot, he fixes his gaze upon the pretty secretary across the table
From the bottom of the huge spacecraft, a metal tube emerges and starts to drill through the roof of the Pentagon
The  starts to shake violently as he stares at the pretty secretary
Pretty
pretty
p
p
Suddenly he lunges at her, sliding across the table
As the  struggles with the terrified girl, the camera pans up to the ceiling, where the metal tube from the spaceship drills through
Descending upon them, it sucks them up instantly
Aaarrgghh
Eeeeeek
- metallic robot holding a clipboard, is standing in front of a large glass receiving jar, as   comes through the tube and lands in the jar
As soon as the ' feet hit the bottom of the jar, the  breaks into a lot of small metallic parts
(Mechanical voice) Oh, nice job
How am  supposed to fix this guy
He's fucked
and , two alien space-pilots, are standing nearby, at the control console
They look like big furry orange heads on stilts, with arms coming out of the sider
(to Edsel) guess we turned it up a little too high
(to Robot) Sorry, man
You're sorry
What about me 've gotta put this asshole back together
Suddenly the pretty secretary comes through the tube and lands in the jar
She's a little mussed up, but okay
(gasp)  Where am
(staring) Hey, who's the chick
Well look at my clothes
Who's gonna pay for the dry cleaning
And where am
demand that you return me to my office immediately
Too late - molecular instability zone around spacecraft
You cannot leave
(to Zeke) What
Is he kidding
Uh
He looks at the , who winks at him
oh yeah
Instability zone
You're stuck here
and  try to keep straight faces
(stunned) But  have to be at my parents for dinner tonight
And my gynecologist appointment is on Wednesday
Not anymore
Would you, ah, like a drink
(leading her away) You'll feel better after a glass of fresh blo-aak
They disappear down a corridor
(
) Do you have any diet soda
(to Zeke) Ah, typical robot
The first Earth-chick we see in ten years, and he's gotta make a play for her
jams the gearshift into '' for Drive, and the ship lifts away from Earth
Hey, do we have any of that Plutonian Nyborg left
Uh, yeah
Just one bag
Uh, it's in the transmitter compartment
Uh, thanks man
opens a hatch and pulls out a double-spouted plastic bag on wheels the size of a steamer-trunk
It is full of white powder
He pours two fifteen-foot lines of powder onto the floor
Then, he pauses
(surveying the lines) Oh great
Think this is enough
(thinking) Uhh
nah
Go for broke
Good thinking, man
As he resumes pouring,  begins singing to himself in an alien tongue
When the lines are poured, they both stand at the start of the trail of white powder, and part their hair to reveal nostrils hidden in their foreheads
& Nose dive
They both start to criss-cross the room, inhaling the white powder like vaccuum cleaners
As they happily snort the Nyborg, the camera pans back to the glass receiving jar, and moves down through the broken pieces of
Reaching his lifeless face, the camera moves around to the back of the head
Through the shattered metal we can see a green ball, glowing inside ' skullpiece
-   '
As the round spaceship moves through space, a group of asteroids approach and whip past
Up ahead, a red sun turns white and goes super-nova
(
) Oh, wow
good Nyborg
- ' and the  are lying in bed, naked
They have just finished making love
She is smoking a cigarette
(glazed) That was incredible
've never felt anything like it
Oh great
have been programmed to be fully proficient in sexual activities
Do you want to go steady
Gee,  don't know
already have a boyfriend
Ah, what he does not know will not hurt him
and  are sitting at the controls, staring wide-eyed out into space
They are obviously stoned
Suddenly a bell rings and the communicator screen lights up
serious officer's face appears on it
Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha
Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha
looks over at the screen and then shouts into it
Whaddyawant, man
Mothership calling Starcruiser Alpha
(to Zeke) You gotta use the microphone
Oh yeah
(shouts into microphone) Whaddyawant man
Now listen, idiot
Do  have to tell you eight hundred times
You don't call me " man "
You call me Com-Op Officer Blix "
Now is that perfectly clear
(into mike) Yeah, sure
Whaddyawant, man
(disgruntled) You are to return immediately to the Mother Ship and pick up a humanoid civilian
Your orders are to escort him to the Interplanetary Tribunal Courtroom so that he can testify at the trial of Lincoln Sternn
And make it snappy
The screen goes blank
Wow
They finally got Sternn
It's about time
Hang on, man
Here we go
jams the gearshift into hyper-drive
The round spaceship blasts forward at ten times the speed of light
- and ' round spacecraft looks like an apple heading toward a freight train as it approaches the enormous mother-ship
- An ashtray full of roaches sits on the console
is at the controls with a joint in his mouth
He is swaying back and forth, eyes glazed
Beside him,  watches the mothership getting closer
(to Zeke) You okay to land this thing
No problem, man
' Huge red arrows point the way through the ten-mile wide landing area as the round spaceship glides in
(
) think you're goin' a little high, man
(
) It's okay, man
If there's one thing  know, it's how to drive when 'm stoned
It's like, you know your perspective's fucked, so you just gotta let your hands work the controls as if you're straight
The round ship rams directly into a wall, and crashes down, skidding to a stop in front of the loading bay
(
) Oh, wow, good landing, man
(
) Thanks
- and  press a button to open the hatch doors
As the door opens we see two metallic Regolian guards waiting on the other side
Between them stands a small, shabbily-dressed humanoid with a crooked jaw and cauliflower ears
This is
(to Zeke and Edsel) This man is to be delivered to the, clik, Interplanetary Tribunal, Courtroom #3, clik, Galaxy versus Lincoln Sternn
Thenk yew
Clik
The guards wheel away
(meekly) Ah, hello
and  escort  down the corridor
(to Fiste) Umm, you're gonna testify at Sternn's trial
nods
They gotta give him at least, like, life
Lincoln Sternn is a kind and honourable man
(camera pulls close to Fiste's face) He will be freed
- As the round spaceship journeys through space it passes through a fantastic space-scape of disembodied rock statues, and past a magnificent graffiti-covered robot chained to an asteroid
(
) 'know,  wish they'd clean this place up, man
(
) Yeah
It's like pig city out here
(
) Yeah
' is getting dressed as the  re-charges his energy- paks
but  don't understand
We laugh together
We care for each other
We have highly proficient sex
Why can't we get married
Look, we're different, okay
Let's leave it at that
The hatch opens, and  and the  walk through, still talking
but mixed marriages just don't work
What if you get tired of me and run off with a vibrator or something
As they move through the room, and out the other side, they pass , who is sitting quietly near the receiving jar, hands folded
Looking around,  notices a green glow coming from the bottom of the jar
He gets up, quietly opens the jar, and pokes through the scrap robot parts
Finding the small green ball in ' head, he pulls it out and looks at it
and  are sitting at the controls, driving carefully
, carrying the green ball, comes up and sits down beside them
There it is, man
'm gonna hang a louie here
(to Fiste) Yeah, well it won't be long now
Are you sure you're gonna testify for Sternn
says nothing
He just clutches the green ball and stares into space
and  look at each other and shrug
An enormous, brightly-lit, multi-level space station/courthouse floats into view, completely filling the screen
and ' round spaceship is just a speck as it enters the frame, approaching the mammoth structure
- The ship locks into the dock, and the exit hatch opens
and the  come through first, ahead of , , and
alright, alright
'll marry you - but on one condition want a Jewish wedding
Jewish wedding
But this is space 95% of the population are robots
Well, find me a robot -rabbi
Okay, okay
give them six months, man
He doesn't even look Jewish
and the  disappear around a corner as  and escort  through the hatch
is carrying the small green ball
As they lead  away, the camera pulls back, out through a space-port, and moves along the outside of the slowly rotating space-station
At the top, the camera zooms down through a massive glass-domed ceiling and into a huge inter-galactic courtroom
Voices echo below us
Are you Captain Lincoln
Sternn
am
As we move down, we see square-jawed  , his shifty-eyed lawyer, and the cold Prosecutor all standing before the Judge
is smirking confidently as the Prosecutor reads from a long page of charges
Lincoln Sternn - you stand here accused of twelve counts of murder in the first degree
fourteen counts of armed theft of Federation property
The hostile humanoid and alien faces all stare at  with hateful, accusing eyes
(
) twenty-two counts of piracy in high space
eighteen counts of fraud
' Mopping his brow, he looks nervously over to
(
) thirty-seven counts of rape, and one moving violation
How do you plead
Smiling to himself, he nods, then gets serious
Not guilty
(whispers to Sternn) Not guilty
Are you nuts (whispers to lawyer) It's okay, Charlie
got an angle
(to Prosecutor) Call the first witness
and his lawyer move to their seats
(to Sternn) But the Prosecutor's gotcha cold Yer as guilty as a cat in a goldfish bowl
and  enter with , and push their way to the front
The Prosecution calls Hanover Fiste
#1 Calling Hanover Fiste
#2 Calling Hanover Fiste
#3 Calling Hanover Fiste
#4 Hanover Fiste
and  sit down, while  , small and shabby, walks up to the witness stand, nervously clutching the small green ball in his hand
As he passes,  and his lawyer continue to argue
(pleading) Lissen Sternn
change the plea to guilty
Throw yerself on the mercy of the court
told you, Charlie
got an angle
is sworn in, as Sternn's lawyer begs
But the most we can hope for is to get ya buried in secrecy so yer grave don't get violated
Plead guilty Shut up, Charlie
got an angle What angle
(pointing to Fiste) Him
State your name for the record
(fidgeting nervously with the green ball) am Hanover Fiste
(winking to lawyer) promised him thirty-five thousand zuleks to testify on my behalf
You know the defendant, (pointing) Captain Sternn
Yes,  know Captain Sternn
And never did there live a kinder, more generous man
He is an overflowing cup, filled with the very cream of human goodness
(to lawyer) See
in all the time 've known him, he's never done anything immoral
(thinking) unless maybe the Pre-Schooler's Prostitute ring
They look at each other, shocked
& Huh
(speaking gently) and he's ah, never done anything illegal
(turning sharply) unless you count all the times he sold dope disguised as a nun (reverting to meekness) He's always been a good, law-abiding citizen
(shouting at himself) Awww, gimme a break
(gentle again) of the Federation, and, and
(going schizo) Shut Up
Shut Up
Shut Up
(gentle, but starting to sweat) a community-concious individual, ah, ah
(rising in crazed anger) (pointing as he screams) He's nothin' but a low-down, double-dealin', back-stabbin', larcenous, perverted worm and his lawyer look on, horrified, as ' body starts to grow
Hangin's too good for him
New muscles tear through ' shabby clothes
Burnin's too good for him
Growing larger, he starts foaming at the mouth
Hanover
He should be torn into little bitsy pieces and buried alive rams his hands down onto the Witness Stand, shattering it completely
Hanover
'll kill him
He hurls the Prosecutor aside, and moves towards  with thundering footsteps
-
Still growing, he rips apart the Judge's bench as he passes it
Finally  he stands towering in rage over the terrified (to Fiste) -h-hey, Hanover
n-now take it easy, Hanover, 'm sure we can talk this ov
Instinctively,  leaps back as ' giant hands come smashing down in the spot where  stood
The gallery scatters screaming as  runs for the door
Slavering, thunders after him
runs through the exit, bolting the door behind him
follows, tearing the door apart, and bringing the entire courtroom wall down in the process
Running down a hallway,  passes a group of Regolian cops, who raise their weapons in an attempt to block the rampaging
#1 Halt, clik, in the name of the Federation, clik
Where is your corridor pass
(to other Regolians) Unco-operative humanoid, clik, blast him
They open fire, but  is unstoppable
Still growing, he grabs the Regolians's weapons, crunches them up and eats them
#1 You are now in violation of Code 103--17, clik, paragraph -64
unauthorized consumption of Federation property
Please come quietly, clik, thenk yew
With a single clap of his enormous hands,  crushes the Regolian's metal skulls together into an accordian the thickness of a dime
He races through a metallic hallway, and ducks into a boiler room, then down a long dark tunnel
At the end of the tunnel, comes to a dead-end, and stops to rest
Oh, this looks good
(growls) Oh, duck under here
'll get you
think 'll turn here (runs, gasping) Come on feet, don't fail me now
Sternn
Uh oh
(runs) Ah, gasp, ah whew, lost him
Okay, Hanover, you've had this coming
Taking a deep breath,  reaches into his pocket, pulls out a wad of bills, and counts them out as he hands them to Let's see, thirty-three, thirty- four, thirty-five thousand zuleks
Thanks Hanover
(taking money) 'nothin, boss
Counting his money,  starts shrinking back to his normal size
And Hanover
Yes
Goodbye
pulls a lever, which opens up the floor below , who screams, falling out into space
As  slides out, grabs the money from ' hand and smiles
All is quiet across this vast expanse of rusted pipes and barren desert
The silence is broken by a whistling sound which gets louder and louder
Then, thud
green ball lands in the dirt in front of us
Fluttering down around it are  ' tattered clothes
Then the burnt ashes of Hanover's body land in a small pile beside his clothes
Panning up we see  flying on her bird in the distance
She swoops down and flies through a maze of rusting pipes and cables which look like the ramnants of an ancient power station
Then she steers her bird through a hidden opening in the rotting floor, and enters a magnificent  secret hideaway cut deep into the rock
' Landing her bird on a circular slab of gleaming marble, dismounts and walks over to a shimmering pool
Here she disrobes, and picking up a small gold pitcher, she pours an ancient oil over herself
It shines and sparkles as it touches her skin
Then she steps into the water, where her body seems to sparkle even brighter
Finishing her sacred bath, she steps out and walks to a stone wall
When she touches it, a rock panel slides away to reveal a gold chest
opens it
Inside the chest lies a glistening set of armoured garments, so bright that  must shield her eyes for a moment
Then, as she looks down at the armour, the voice of comes into her head
(
) To defend - this is the Pact
but when life loses its value, and it taken for nought, then the Pact is
to avenge Through a series of dissolves we see ' hands sensuously fitting the various metallic pieces over her firm body
Finally we pull back to see her fully
Standing before us, glistening in the torch-light, she looks magnificent
Reaching once more into the chest,  pulls out a golden sword
As she holds it, it seems to vibrate, almost buzzing in her hands
Suddenly she swings it, slicing cleanly through one of the stone torches on the rock wall
As the burning torch falls to the ground,  leaves
From over our heads,  comes soaring past, her armour gleaming in the rays of the setting sun
Below her, she sees a metallic holiday-town filled with barbarian soldiers
Drunken blue men fight in the streets, strange animals run around loose, and dead or drunken bodies lie in the gutters
Looking down, amidst the melee, she sees three winged creatures tied up in front of a bar
The camera zooms in on one of the creature's saddlebags
It has a silver medallion set into the leather, identical to the one which  pried from the Elder's fingers
Barbarian honky-tonk music fills the crowded room, as various barbarian soldiers sit drinking and fondling the bar-girls who are dressed in cheap, flashy metal outfits
Three of the blue barbarians are particularly drunk and rowdy as they push a non-barbarian down, dump a drink on his head, laugh and kick him
walks in through the swinging silver and plexiglass doors, past the three soldiers kicking their victim
She sits down at the bar
The three brutish blue soldiers finish stomping the man and walk over to the bar, crowding close around
#1 Hey, look
new one
(to Taarna) Where you from, baby
ignores him
#2 Doesn't talk much, does she
#3 She doesn't have to talk for what want to do with her
' It slowly moves down to her sword, and unclips the safety strap
#3 (running his hand across her breastplate) 'mon baby, let's see what's under there
#1 (starting to undo her breastplate) Yeah, let's have a look
Taarna slowly stands up, pushing their hands away, and takes a step back
#2 Heey, she's tough
#3 Maybe she wants to fight
They all laugh
#1 or maybe she wants to take us all on
Still laughing, they move towards her
In a blinding flash,  draws her golden sword, and wielding it like a Samurai master, slices off all three of their heads
In an instant, the sword is back in its sheath
The barbarian's heads stop laughing as they fall to the ground
The music stops, and everyone in the bar stares at
Stepping over the bodies,  walks up to the bartender, pulls out the parchment picture of the glowing mountains, and shows it to him
The bartender looks at it carefully, then points out the window
Beyond the oasis
nods and leaves
His eyes start to turn green
The camera gets closer and closer to his glowing eyes, until the green glow turns into the image of a ball, lying in the ground, in ' holograph
is crouched over the machine turning several knobs, trying to make the ball move
Nothing happens
(to himself) Hmmm
must be jammed
Frustrated,  picks up a flashlight, opens up a compartment underneath the control knobs, and takes a look inside
While fiddles inside the machine, we see two hands appear on the holograph screen and pick up the green ball
looks over to the holograph and notices
Where'd it go
As the hands cradle the green ball, the camera pulls back to reveal a skinny, unco-ordinated boy wearing thick eyeglasses, carrying the sphere across his backyard
This is
(
) It all started when  found the green meteorite
read in Farraday's "Life of the Planets" that smaller ones like this are supposed to burn up when they enter the atmosphere, but for some reason this one didn't
carries the ball into a typical small-town house
- As the narration continues, we follow two red wires down from the
antenna, along the roof, and into ' attic window
The wires run through a bucket of water and are hooked up to some electronic parts on ' desk
(
) so  brought it up to my room, stuck it in my rock collection and forgot about it
was experimenting with natural electricity
The camera pans around the room to show various displays of ' scientific tinkering - blue-ribbon science projects, transparent models of a man and a woman showing all internal organs, and many books
In the corner, the green ball sits in ' rock collection
At his desk,  impatiently shuffles through the dusty pages of an old scientific journal
(
) and with the storm warnings up, figured maybe tonight 'd hit the jackpot
All  needed was a little juice
He looks out the window at the gathering storm
Crackling from the sky, a bolt of lightning strikes the television antenna and surges along the wires into the attic
' The lightning flashes into ' apparatus, lighting it up brightly
It works
Suddenly, an electric arc jumps from the bucket of water and crosses the room to join with thw ball on his shelf
Caught in the middle,  begins to glow green
(looking at his green arms) Oh Jesus
The electrical field opens up a shimmering gateway into another universe and  de-materializes
We float in darkness for a moment as black shapeless images zoom past
(
) felt like  was nothing - just atoms floating in the darkness
Then, tiny beams of light join to form a glow in the corner of the screen
The glow gets brighter and starts moving slowly around the screen
Now, we can make out some of the images whipping past - a half-formed hand, pages of a book, a crumbling pyramid, a green ball
(
) Then, a body started to re-form around me
Only it wasn't my body - this one had muscles
Sturdy muscular parts begin to materialize around the moving light
They join up with each other to form a powerfully built human figure
Finally a man's face takes shape, and as it forms, eveything gets brighter and clearer
(
) It was a great body, but wasn't too crazy about the face
The powerful figure, , turns slowly as he floats and begins to look at his hands and arms
Moving his mouth, he speaks in a new voice - deep and powerful
(feeling head) Hmmm
no hair
Suddenly, the background explodes into fields of radiant colours as the body accelerates away from us and passes through a second shimmering gateway
, strong, masculine and hairless, materializes cradled in the hand of a huge stone idol
He is naked and unconscious Above him, the glowing green ball is held in the idol's other hand
The camera pulls back to show that the idol is standing on the deck, stop a huge, truncated pyramid
The deck forms a walkway around a swirling pool of green water
Kneeling all around the seething pool, are lizard-men, wearing priest's robes
Two of them stand beside a glass coffin
Inside the coffin, lies a naked girl, bound and gagged
(chanting softly) Uluhtec, Ulutec
Directly in fron of the idol, a regal-looking , wearing a revealing velvet cloak, is praying to the raging water
By the powers of the glowing Loc-Nar placed in your idol's hand,  demand you come forth, Uluhtec
The waters of the sacrifical pool rage more violently and a low rumble is heard far below
' The green ball, (Loc-Nar), glows brightly as  opens his eyes, looks down and notices his enormous genitals
Hmmm
big
Seeing an animal-skin hanging from the idol, he rips off a piece and wraps it around himself
(
) There was no way  was gonna walk around this place with my dork hangin' out
Suitably covered, he surveys the ritual taking place below him
(
) Wow
This looked like something right out of the Ten Commandments
The  is kneeling before the seething water
Grant me your strength in return for a living mortal sacrifice
It has been ordained
Come forth Uluhtec
demand it
Two lizard priests remove the terrified girl from the glass case and hold her out over the swirling water
The nods and the two priests drop her in
' Seeing the girl struggle in the water, ' eyes grow wide
(
) What'd they do that for
He stands and dives into the raging pool, swimming powerfully towards the drowning girl
Reaching her,  grabs the girl's  bound ankles, hooks them over his head and drags her through a decayed hole in the underwater wall
Inside a stone tunnel, they are swept along by the current
(
) Normally, 'd be dead by now kept thinking  was going to run out of air, but my new body worked great
just hoped her body was working as good as mine
- and the girl are washed out into a pond at the center of a beautiful field of lilies
He pulls her out of the water, unconscious
As he unties her, she begins to stir
Thank you
She takes ' hand and lies back in the flower, her beautiful breasts exposed in the sunlight
(
) She had the most beautiful eyes
wanted to make some conversation but  found my new self asking the same old stupid questions
Are you from around here
Well, you may not believe this, but 'm from another world - from a place called Earth
Earth
too am from Earth
How did you get here
My name is Katherine Wells, and 'm from the British colony of Gibraltar
Time makes no diff- erence here, but there it was the summer of 1892
It was evening - 'd gone for a walk on the cliffs when suddenly a sphere fell from the sky
Following its glow,  came to a shining gate made out of light
Unable to resist, stepped through it and awoke in this world
There  was thin and weakly, fit only to stay indoors
(she stands up) But here, somehow  am stronger, more alive, (she stretches seductively) more fully a woman
(
) You're not kidding
(standing) , too seem better equipped on this world
(he holds out his arm) My arms are more powerful
(strecthes his fingers) Even my fingers seem to hold great strength
walks up close to , takes his hand and touches the fingers to her breast
You saved my life
have no reward to give you, but if any part of me pleases your senses -  would give it willingly
She circles her nipple with his baby finger
(
) Wow
This was great There was no way 'd get a chick like this back on Earth
mean, look at her
Taking  in his arms,  lays her down on a bed of flowers and begins to tenderly make love to her
(
) There was only one problem
spiked boot appears in the frame
The camera pans up to show a large, ugly hairy beast-man standing over  and The camera then pulls back to reveal the entwined couple, completely surrounded by a horde of grim, bestial warriors
(
don't know who these jerks were, but they sure picked a bad time to show up
The ugly beast-men grab  and  as we; ' The beast-Captain keeps his machine gun trained on  as the soldiers lead him into the cavernous room
(
) They split us up and took me to this weird castle-type place
wanted to find out where they'd taken Katherine, but none of these guys seemed to speak English
In the middle of the room there is a round stone pedestal with a throne carved into it
On the throne sits , a child-like ruler with a sadistic glint in his eye
They tell me you are Den of Earth, the one who dared to steal the female sacrifice from the Queen
(
) This guy was a shrimp so  figured 'd play it tough
Where is the girl
am Ard - supreme leader of the revolution and the next ruler of the world
(tougher) The girl
Well, aren't we fierce
If you are truly as tough as you seem, then you will serve me well
But first, a test
Guards
Castrate him
(
) Uh oh
Two bestial guards approach from behind, brandishing curved short-swords
turns instinctively, dodges the first thrust and delivers a bone-shattering elbow to the beast's head, crushing his skull
Spinning with his own momentum,  throws a rock-hard fist into the second guard's chest, snapping his rib-cage and sending him flying across the room
Without pausing, the bald muscleman grabs the nearby beast- Captain and lifts him into the air by his machine-gun
The Captain hangs on as  twists the gun, butts it into the creature's groin and then drives the weapon through the Captain's jaw
The creature crumples, leaving  with the gun
(
) Boy
was pretty good at this stuff
Excellent
You are worthy to serve me
(aiming machine-gun at him) Give me the girl or die
(taking it lightly) Well, if  have a choice, 'll take death
So be it
fires, spraying a row of bullets across ' body
The bullets blast big yellow holes in ' chest, but there is no blood
looks up and laughs
Ha ha ha
You'll have to do better than that
As  looks on, ' wounds miraculously close up and heal themselves over
(
) could see why they made this guy their leader
(standing up) but if you're really interested in the girl; 've had her encased in glass
pulls the velvet covering off of a glass box to reveal , unconscious, sealed inside
She's dead
Actually no
She's sleeping, but only  can awaken her
What do you want of me
want you to steal the sacred Loc-Nar
What is this Loc-Nar
The Queen's glowing sphere, you fool
The sacrifice to Uluhtec can only be performed by the possessor of the sacret Loc-Nar
(calling out) Norl
, a huge gorilla-man, in a purple cloak, steps forward
(to Den) This is Norl, my bravest warrior
You will go with him to the Queen's castle and steal the Loc-Nar
Then will give you the girl
And if  refuse
If you refuse, you die, she dies, everybody dies
(
) Sounded reasonable to me
looks down at ' motionless body
' In the moonlight,  and  lead a squad of beast-warriors, armed with automatic weapons, along the river towards the Queen's castle
(to Den) Ssh
Guard post ahead
We must go underground
lifts a rock to reveal an underground passageway
(
) This guy Norl seemed to know what he was doing
And, for a gorilla, his English wasn't half bad
and the warriors enter the underground passage
The group, carrying torches, moves along the dark tunnel
They pass a bubble-window with shark-faced eels swimming on the other side
(to Den) We're underneath the castle moat
nods
An ugly growl echoes through the tunnel up ahead
the warriors freeze and murmur to each other in their own languages
(to Norl) What are they saying
They talk of the savage beast who prowls these catacombs with a fierce hunger and sharp teeth
(gestures) six inches long
dog-faced warrior shakes his head and says something to
Sorry
(indicating) sixteen inches long
Suddenly, a savage beast appears and chomps his long, razor-sharp teeth into one of the warriors at the end of the line
, , and the remaining warriors run on through the tunnel as, behind them, the monster pulls his victim apart
, , and the remaining warriors arrive at a door in the rock wall
(to Den) Now we separate
You and Korg take this door into the Queen's quarters
The rest of us will move through the walls and enter her chamber from the other side
Whoever gets the Loc-Nar first will return it to Ard
Good luck, Den
nods, puts out his torch and carefully opens the door as moves off
and  silently enter
Across the dark room, the glow of the green ball casts a pale light
(whispers and points) Loc-Nar
(
) Wow
It was just like the ball  dug up in my back yard
They tip-toe towards it
(
) As  saw the Loc-Nar's glow had this real funny feeling
All by themselves, my hands reached forward to touch it
But the Loc-Nar moved out of the way
Instead, my hands felt something else - warm flesh
Then the lights came on
In the brightly lit room,  is standing before the beautiful semi-clad , and holding her firm, naked breasts in his hands
Looking around, he sees that he and  are surrounded by a brigade of the Queen's ugly guards, swords raised
(
) Talk about embarassing
(smiling) Kill them
The Queen's guards attack with battle-axes, clubs and swords
As  knees one in the groin and swings his gun into another's face, four of the guards surround  and club his brains out
But , still going strong, throws two guards into the wall and heaves a third out the window
As the  watches with glee, more guards rush into the room and  is finally over- powered and held down
The Captain of the guards places a long knife against Den's throat
Can  slit his throat, your Majesty
The , eyeing Den's magnificent body, sighs
Yes, slit his throat
Thank you, your Majesty
As the Captain presses his knife against Den's flesh, the suddenly raises her hand
(smiling) Stop
have, ah, something better in mind
She takes Den's hand and leads him into an adjoining room, as the guards grumble to one another
#1 Jeez, not again
#2 This always happens
Look, she's the Queen
She can do whatever she wants
#2 Yeah, sure
#1 Sure
' The  stands before , hands on her hips and a funny look in her eye
If you please me,  may let you live
She smiles, and approaches
(
) Uh oh
What must  do
Satisfy my appetites
The  lets her cloak drop to the floor as she gets closer
She is naked underneath
(
) Wow
Eighteen years of nuthin' and now, twice in one day
What a place
Come with me
Mmmm
She steps forward and takes his hand, leading him towards the bed
' and the  are lying undressed on the enormous bed
The  has a very contented look on her face
looks exhausted
As the Neverwhere moon rises outside the chamber window, the  slowly runs her hand over ' bulging muscles
(softly) The rising moon climaxes our love, Den
Is is a sign, a new beginning
Yes, a sign
(
) had no idea what she was talking about
(stroking him) Neverwhere is a troubled land, but together we could calm it
We could rule side by side
Your strength has brought great peace to my restless body
It could bring great peace to all the troubled people of this land
(
) knew  was good, but  didn't know was that good
Suddenly the Captain and his guards burst through the door
Your Majesty
The Loc-Nar is missing stolen The  jumps to her feet in a rage and points to
(screaming) Fiend
You make love to me while your accomplices steal the magic sphere
Guards
Take him
The guards grab  as the   snatches one of their big spiked clubs
(to guards) Hold him still
will kill him myself (
) Boy, was she pissed off
Heaving the guards aside,  breaks free and jumps out the chamber window
falls down, down into the swirling waters of the castle moat
( ) She is livid
Prepare the flying lizards
want his head
Pulling himself out of the moat,  knocks a guard off his leopard/horse and rides off
is kneeling at the edge of the sacrificial pool
Beside him sits a long glass case wrapped in chains
Through the chains we see  trapped inside - fully conscious and terrified
Ard's bestial warriors stand all around carrying torches and spears
Above them, the Loc-Nar sits glowing in the stone idol's hand
By the power of the magic Loc-Nar placed in your idol's hands, command you - come forth Uluhtec
The green water in the pool immediately begins to churn violently and leap into the air
bolt of lightning crackles in the sky
is racing across the barren desert on his leopard/horse
Visible in the distance is the outline of the huge, truncated pyramid where he first saved
As he rides, he sees the green glow of the Loc-Nar, sparkling in the glass surfaces of the coffin in front of it
(to himself) Katherine
He spurs his leopard/horse on into the night
The , riding a flying lizard, leads her army in pursuit of
(pointing) There he is, your Majesty
'
Up ahead, silhouetted in the moonlight, she sees , riding up the steps of the pyramid
The camera pans to the green glow atop the torch-lit pyramid
(
) The Loc-Nar
(shouting to her men) Faster
To the pyramid
She whips her lizard harder
is incanting to the raging water while two hooded monks stand beside him, holding the struggling  out over the pool
Here is your sacrifice, Uluhtec
Now, give me your power
(to monks) Throw her in
Chanting the name "Uluhtec", the two monks start to throw the girl in when suddenly a third monk leaps forward and grabs her, kicking the other two monks into the water
The intruder's hood falls away and his bald head gleams in the moonlight
Katherine
Den
No
You'll ruin everything
jumps up and runs toward the Loc-Nar, perched in the stone idol's hand
Grabbing it,  holds the glowing ball above him
(to his guards) Kill them
Kill them both
Suddenly, a hand leaps out of the darkness, gripping the Loc-Nar just above Ard's hand - it is the
The Loc-Nar is mine
(struggling) Stupid bitch
Get away from me
As  and the  fight over the Loc-Nar, the Queen's troops pour in and battle with Ard's soldiers
Thunder roars overhead
Holding  in one arm,  smashes a nearby soldier and grabs the beast's spear
With the battle raging all around him,  looks up at the sky
Lightning crackles, illuminating the night with electricity
reaches down, picks up the long chain that was wrapped around the glass case and attaches one end to his spear
He kicks the other end into the raging water, then heaves the spear with all his might into the head of the stone idol
In the same instant, a bolt of lightning fires down from the sky, striking the idol full force
The lightning bolt travels through the spear and down the chain, into the water
Suddenly, the electrical energy arcs across to join with the Loc-Nar
Holding onto the Loc-Nar,  and the  begin to glow green, then de-materialize into a shimmering dimensional warp
The troops stop fighting and look on in amazement, until all that remains is the glowing Loc-Nar, hanging in mid-air
(to Den) Where did they go
They are gone
That is all that matters
(
) They probably went back to Earth
Boy, will Mom be surprised
Suddenly, the Loc-Nar falls to the ground at Den's feet
(looking down) The Loc-Nar
you could have the power of Uluhtec
You could be ruler over all these people
(looking over the throng) Forget it
In a single powerful leap, , carrying , bounds up onto the Queen's flying lizard and they fly off
The amazed troops watch for a moment, then shrug and resume fighting
' clings to  as they fly
Oh, but Den, with the Loc-Nar you could have returned to Earth
like it better here
The lizard banks sharply away from us and carries them into the distance
(
) On Earth, 'm nobody
But here, am The camera pans down the stone statue to the glowing sphere, which lies abandoned on the ground
The soldiers are gone
As we watch, time begins to accelerate and the Neverwhere Pyramid ages and crumbles all around the green ball
The earth heaves and shifts, and dense vegetarian grows up through the cracks in the ground
prehistoric man walks up and sees the glowing ball under a fern
Fascinated, he picks it up and looks at it, as the foot of a Tyrannosaurus Rex comes down, crushing him
Time advances again as the dinosaur becomes a skeleton, and a Biblical tent-community grows up around the ball
In the fire-light, the Nomadic tribesmen are watering their animals, when one of the camels paws at the ground, uncovering the glowing ball
Scared, the camel struggles and trys to break its ropes
Out of nowhere a Roman Legion attacks, slaughtering the tribesmen
Time accelerates again, and the conquering Romans build a temple, placing the green ball in the head of a golden idol
Then the Romans grow fat and debauched, while slave-girls feed them grapes
As the ball glows, the temple crashes down around the debauched Romans, covering them and the green ball in rubble
Over the ruins of the temple, a succession of primitive mud and clay huts evolve into the thatched-roof cottages of a Medieval village
Medieval stone-cutter finds the ball, and mortars it in with his stones as he builds a water well in the centre of the village
Satisfied with his work, he lowers the bucket to draw himself a drink
Behind him, an  ox-cart comes roaring around a corner
The axle breaks and a heavy wooden wheel careens along, striking the stone-cutter in the back and knocking him into the well
Time advances once more as the Medieval village grows and transforms into a Victorian-style town
It is evening, and the stone well now sits under a gazebo at the centre of a gas- lit village green
fancy carriage carrying a Victorian gentleman passes by and circles the green
Moving in through a window across the street, we see a seductive- looking woman dressing herself in black garters and lace
This is intercut with the carriage circling the green, until the woman, who looks like a high-class harlot, finishes dressing and leaves her room
Crossing the street, she walks up to the gazebo and leans provocatively up against the well
The gentleman gets out of his carriage, approaches the woman and propositions her
She smiles, touches, and teases him
We pan down their legs to the green ball glowing in the well-wall
Suddenly red blood begins to drip over the ball, and the woman's body falls to the ground
The camera pans up to the well-bucket, where the gentleman is washing the blood from his hands
As time begins to move forward again, the man ages and hobbles away, as the well crumbles and cheap turn-of-the-century row- housing grows up, covering the green ball
The town becomes dirtier and blacker, and smokestacks blow soot into the morning sky
Almost on cue, the doors of the houses open, and grim coal-miners emerge, shuffling through the filthy streets on their way to work
The camera pans down to a drain in the gutter
rat appears
Panning back up, the street is now empty
bell is heard ringing, and a horse-drawn Red Cross cart pulls around a corner and into view
Masked workers follow the cart
One rings the bell, while the others pull corpses from the doorways and load them into the cart
The gutters and windowsills are now full of rats
Time advances again and the buildings become deserted derelicts
Their decaying timbers groan under the weight
support snaps, and one of the buildings starts to collapse
Falling amidst the crumbling plaster and rotting wood is the glowing green ball
As the ball hits the ground, it is covered over by rubble
The rubble becomes bleached by the hot sun and the landscape grows drier
Sand blows all around, covering over everything
As the sandstorm clears, the entire terrain is nothing but desert
In the distance we can see a group of people walking
The people appears to be a band of aboriginal workmen, carrying futuristic laser-shovels over their shoulders
They are led by a goateed archaeologist with an elaborate metal detector
As he walks, his detector starts bleeping
He points to a spot on the ground, and the natives start digging with their laser- shovels
One of the workers finds something
Kuma
Kuma
Kuma
The archaeologist waves the workers away and directs a tread- driven shovel-sifter up to the spot
The shovel-sifter digs in and pulls up a large chunk of desert
When the sand has sifted out, we see the tarnished Loc-Nar in the machine's grip
It is not glowing
The machine swivels, and a native foreman plucks the Loc-Nar from the shovel-sifter's teeth
As the foreman touches it, the Loc-Nar starts glowing brightly
The foreman's hands turn green
He looks at his green hands, then he looks over to the archaeologist
Suddenly the foreman's entire body glows green, and crumbles into dust
The archaeologist and the natives stare in horror at the glowing Loc-Nar, lying in the pile of green dust
-   - The camera comes down from high above the city
The general shape and outline of New York looks familiar, but as we get closer we sense that something is different
Fires are burning in various locations below us, and intermittent gunshots become audible as the narration begins
(
) Yeah, New York, big deal
Scum-centre of the world
Moving down through the skyscrapers, the city gets dirtier and slummier
We pass a dead man hanging from a tenement clothesline
Below us, scruffy children dodge traffic as they play gyro-ball in the garbage-filled street
(
) and now they're talking about letting in low-lifes from other planets, too
Under the narration, the camera turns a corner and zooms down through the roof of a parked taxicab
It stops full frame on the newspaper held in the cabdriver's hands
slow pan across the front page reveals that the paper is the New York Times, July 6, 2031 One headline reads: "400,000 Traffic Deaths Over Holiday Weekend"
Another reads: "Venus Declared 73rd State"
The camera stops on a headline reading: "Professor Discovers Ancient Relic --- to be shown in
Museum"
There is an accompanying photo of the goateed archaeologist and his beautiful daughter standing beside a glass and metal case containing the Loc-Nar
knocking is heard on the cab's window, and the driver throws down the newspaper
(from outside) You free
Yeah
Get in
(
) My name's Harry Canyon
drive a cab
He flips a switch which unlocks the rear door
The young man climbs into the back seat and closes the door
Harry's yellow Checker cab pulls out into traffic
The vehicle looks pretty normal except for some vaguely futuristic chrome panels cut into the sides, and thicker, deeper bumpers
Harry slides open the plexiglass shields separating him from his passenger
Where to, pal
The
Building
The
Building
What a joke
Used to be a nice place until they turned it into low rent housing
Now it's a dump
wouldn't live there if you paid me
He switches on the car radio
The music plays as Harry's cab passes various time-altered New York landmarks; a graffiti -covered Empire State Building - windows all boarded up, a decrepit Lincoln Centre, the marquis reading "Continuous Live Sex Show, Also Inter-Planetary Mud-Wrestling", new ultra-tech buildings crammed between half-destroyed Wall Street office buildings, garbage everywhere
Inside the cab, the   pulls a gun out of his jacket, sticks his arm through the opening in the plexi-glass shield, and holds the gun to Harry's head
Okay sucker, hand over your cash, now
(
) This city is really going to the dogs
Harry's foot stretches forward and pushes a footswitch
buzzing is heard, and the young man's body suddenly dematerializes
The gun which he held at Harry's head falls to the seat beside , who picks it up and tosses it into the glove compartment, beside all sorts of other futuristic guns and weapons
(
) Stupid asshole
Nobody touches me unless  want 'em to
- The camera is close-up on the illustrated banner over the main entrance
The banner reads; "Treasures of the Loc-Nar - Coming July 8th"
We pan down to the museum doors, as a man's body comes crashing through the plate glass and sprawls forward, cut and bleeding
It is the goateed professor from the desert
His daughter runs out behind him, ripping her clothes on the broken glass
Father
Run
The girl takes off down the museum stairs as men with laser guns come out and start firing
fat, evil-looking man () bends down and grabs the professor's head, jerking it up
(to henchmen) He's dead
Get the girl
The girl, clothes torn, runs out into the street, just as Harry's cab comes cruising by
She runs alongside, pounding on the window
(to Harry) Help me, please
laser shot narrowly misses her and blasts Harry's side-mirror
flips the switch, unlocking the passenger door, and waves her in
(
) Normally my rule is "Don't get involved", but something about this dame got to me
She dives in the back and  floors it
The cab screams away as Laser-shots land all around
(in shock, breathless) The Loc-Nar
they wanted it
but my father wouldn't tell them
now 'm the only one
(interupting) Relax sister
There's a cop station up here
You can
looks at her in the rear-view mirror
The girl has fainted
(
) Just what  needed
guess 'm a sucker for a pretty face
The police station is an all-metal building with no windows
plaque on thr front reads "
- 52nd "
Harry's cab pulls up
He gets out, carries the unconscious up to the front door, and pushes a buzzer
(over intercom) Police
Whaddya want
wanna report a murder
(over intercom) So what else is new
You gonna let me in or what
buzzer sounds and the door slides open
carries the in and heads across the room toward the main desk
As he walks he passes cops using a strange metal detector/vaccuum cleaner to suck dangerous weapons from a pair of suspects
Piles of weapons can be seen in the machine's transparent belly
#1 Okay, this guy's clean - next
comes up to the front desk and starts to lay the girl down in a chair
(to Harry) Before you go any further pal, gotta tell you, it's cash up front thousand bucks a day for a full investigation
Another thousand if the assailant is caught
Got it
Yeah thanks
He picks up the girl and turns to leave
for nuthin'
(shouting after Harry) You think you can do better
Join one of the vigilante groups
There's a list of 'em outside
, carrying the , comes out of the police station, as a patrol car screeches to a halt in front of him
Two cops emerge, dragging a green alien with four arms
tell you 'm an American citizen
just lost my papers
(to himself) Goddamn illegal aliens
heads toward his cab
(
) So here  was, stuck with this beautiful girl
knew she was gonna be nuthin' but trouble
He looks around at the sleazy neighbourhood
Every doorway and alley seems to have a rapist or thug lurking
(
) but  didn't feel right just leaving her for the sickos dunno, maybe 'm gettin' sentimental or something
' This futuristic bachelor pad is constructed entirely of brightly coloured molden plastic
Bowling trophies sit on a shelf underneath a neon "Buweiser" clock
The place is a mess
carries the  in, pushes the light button to "On", and lays her down on the sofa
As he takes off his jacket he looks down at the unconscious figure - her clothes torn in all the right places
She moans and starts to come to
Where am
My place
Walking over to a hi-tech plastic bar,  pushes a button and a machine pours and mixes a drink
He hands the  the glass
She sits up and drinks
(looking at Harry) They'd have killed me if it wasn't for you
What'd they want to snuff you for
