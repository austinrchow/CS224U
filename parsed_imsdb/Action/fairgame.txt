Written by Jez Butterworth & John-Henry Butterworth Based on the memoir Fair Game: My Life as a Spy, My Betrayal by the White House by Valerie Plame : ,
Extreme close a figure kneels in a cell, in tight stress position
Bound
Blindfold
Convulsed with intense pain
We move closer -- It's a woman
/ () Everything you face in life
Everything you come up against
She is hauled to her feet by unseen hands
: She's carried head-first fast down a corridor by four men, like a battering ram
() Everything that stands in your way
into another cell
fifth masked man
On the table-- a car battery
: Screams ring out down the empty corridor
: Blows rain down on her
The blindfold is torn off
() your foes, your fears, your terrors
your darkest nights
----
She is thrust into a bath and held under water
her face, as the bubbles of her desperate breath subside, her eyes glaze and a single smoke-swirl of crimson blood rises up from her parted lips
() are all sent to ask you the same question
The only question
-- She looks directly at us
Awake
Alert
() Who are you
: 2
Searing heat
Eighty storey star-scrapers reflect half-built Death Stars
Shimmering buildings and cranes for miles
50 acres of climate controlled exhibition space swarming with global civil engineers
Tented meeting rooms, stands
The bone dry wheels of global commerce, turning
striking blonde, 30s, crosses a concourse towards a Malaysian Woman in Chanel
extends a hand
Jessica McDowell
Cognis Chemicals
hope 'm not late
and the Malaysians rise swiftly above the hordes
When do you leave Kuala Lumpur, Ms
Macdowall
fly to Taiwan Tuesday then back to Dusseldorf
really only need five minutes of his time
hope we are lucky
He is very busy man
,  , sits at an    , before a wrap around view of the Petronas Towers
-- two neat Maylasian secretaries, with pads in front of them
One smiles
She smiles back
Mr Tabir very busy this morning
Oh  can imagine
(
) Seeing's we're waiting
a puffy 30 year old Sri Lankan, , is shelling peanuts on the marble, regarding her
3
why don't you practice your little pitch on me
His tones contains an edge of menace
She smiles politely
Actually
If it's all the same- know all my uncle's business
He trusts me
Begin
Well
'm sure you're aware Mr
(No answer) You're aware that recently your subsidiary, Kopa Oleochemicals developed an organic, ester based lubricant derived from Kernel oil, that makes offshore drilling significantly more environmental
My company, Cognis  wants- (Interrupting, flatly) You American
She stops
Canadian
Actually
From Toronto
You a Maple Leafs fan
Right
Uh
No
Not really
You must be the only person from Toronto's not a hockey fan
Valerie holds his dead eyes
Oh 'm a fan
Dad's from Vancouver, so 'm a Canuck
Between us, the Maple Leaves suck
They should never have signed Mark Bell
Guy's a liability on an off the ice
So who's your team
4
don't like hockey
He holds her eye impassively
enters
Unfortunately Mr Tabir has no window this morning
But tonight he extends invitation to private reception at his residence
Is that ok
really don't wish to intrude
She meets Hafiz's level gaze
He doesn't blink
Come to the party
,  , Mercedes pull up outside a  above the sprawling city
, Not a party
Asian men with name badges swap cards
Valerie makes small-talk with some Germans
She spots her quarry at the end of the corridor
She excuses herself
Mr
Tabir
Jessica McDowall, Cognis Thank you for allowing me to come to your beautiful Home
How can  help you
Mr Tabir  wonder if you had time to glance at our proposal which would allow Kopa to access to Cognis' current Petrochemical Service Partners
Essentially its- man comes up and whispers to Mr
Tabir
He stops her
Please excuse me,  have to attend to something
My assistant here will make you comfortable
5
Lit by a stock market ticker, Valerie sits in front of a large desk
Alone
Waiting
Glances at papers on the desk
The door opens
It's not
It's
Hi
was waiting for Mr
Tabir
My uncle had to leave
He asked me to drive you to his tennis club
You can have your meeting there
/
'
() As they pull away, Valerie looks back
She spots through a window --    -- She freezes
: turns off onto a deserted road in the Lake Gardens
Why are we stopping
He looks at her
Undoes his seatbelt
Ms
Macdowall, my uncle believes that trust is something you earn
And he doesn't trust anyone until he knows them very, very well
He strokes her hair
She holds his eye
Composed
But he trusts you, Hafiz
The temperature in the car drops a hundred degrees
How do you know my name
's brain does 0-60 in 0
06 Seconds
He flips open the glove box
Nothing there
Your car was swept an hour ago
(He goes for the door
) Do not get out
If you get out of this car  can't protect you
6
:  black car, 50 yards behind
He grabs her arm
Who are you
Let go of my arm Hafiz
Who the fuck are you
He releases her arm
She holds his gaze
Breathing hard
Listen carefully
Your uncle is in business with Abu Domar Khan- (Shaking his head            His company provides Khan smiling)                     with shipping, money That's bullshit
laundering and contraband components
Khan has made contact with a terror organisation via an aid agency in Pakistan
They are seeking materials to build a weapon
Fuck you
(She fixes him) Your brother is in Kalutara jail in Colombo facing execution for trafficking
We can help him
Bullshit
You can't help him
We can help him
Hafiz
Listen to me
Listen
You have to think straight here Hafiz
Because  promise you one thing
Right now, you have no idea what we can and cannot do
Hafiz looks in the rear view
At the floor
Deep inside something stirred
She saw it
7
We need information about your uncle
Contacts
Shipments
If you help us, we help you
If you don't, your brother dies and tomorrow you're sitting next to your uncle in a cell in Thailand and it won't be me asking the questions
Hafiz closes his eyes, head back
She watches him closely
You will get a call at 8am
You'll be asked if you need a cleaner
You want her to come three mornings per week
Do you understand
said Packed
Behind the bar,  -- Bombing of Afghanistan
At the bar, a birthday celebration
Cuervo shots
In back, around a table piled high with empty Mexican plates, a group of girls catch up
Valerie and some friends
So after like six hours, he finally manages to stand up on the snowboard, and the instructor lets go of him and he just plummets
(Laughter) swear to god, he can't turn, slow down, for like four hundred yards
And yet 'm incredible in bed
--  , handsome, 50s, watches the explosions on the screen
He picks up a tray
Keep the change
: Valerie is being quizzed by her buddy's boyfriend, Steve
So what do you do Valerie
work in Venture Capital
Brewster Jennings, here in Georgetown
8
Cool
So like net startups
Right
Retail and consumer
Basically we create pooled investment vehicles
Sounds high risk
guess
But you know
high risk, high return
Pretty boring actually
So what do you do
arrives back to the table with a tray of drinks
They're out of Corona
got    Me and Steve won't fly on the a Rolling Rock
same plane
We won't even get the same train together
We got the same train to your mom's
It only takes one to fly a      Disneyland
sarin attack on plane into a nuclear power      Disneyland
station- Whatever they're telling us we're totally vulnerable
mean who's protecting us
It's real scary
Joe
Would you risk taking your kids to Disneyland right now
Absolutely not
Far from being a playground of the imagination, Disneyland is actually a giant clearing house for crappy merchandise
And Space Mountain is a major disappointment
Valerie tries not to laugh
Gives him a stern look
9
Joe thinks Disneyland is Vegas for kids
Vegas
dirty bomb in Vegas
You get on a plane, there's two guys with turbans, seats A1 and 2
Joe closes his eyes
Valerie kicks him under the table
They look nervous
They're sweating, saying prayers
(To himself) Ye Gods
Steve you have a two year old
You're off that plane
You're calling the cops
think if we're honest we all are
(To Joe) Joe
Two guys
On a plane
Turbans
Praying
Sweating
What's the call
Joe opens his eyes
Catches Valeries'
Everybody listens
He takes off his glasses
And looks at Jeff
Well Jeff
: Valerie is driving home
Joe in the passenger seat
Every time
Every time we go out
He started it- He's drunk Joe
Everybody's had a hard day
They're just trying to let off steam- 10
By invoking quasi-racist connundra
The guy's a parent
Is he telling his four year     It's Diana's birthday
Jeff's old to fear all men in          her best friend
turbans
So
So you can't call him a racist pussy
If not sitting there while someone spouts obnoxious crap makes you an asshole
Then 'm an asshole
And you knew that when you married me
(Silence
She drives
) By the way
How was your trip
: 1997
reception
Two hundred people in the main banquet hall
Joe walks through the crowd
Working the room
Valerie accepts an hors d'oeuvre
Catches sight of Joe through the crowd
They catch eyes
She leans to her friend
Who's that
: Later
Joe excuses himself and turns
Valerie stands there
Hello
Hi
Forgive me
was staring
It's just 'm sure we've met before
So who am
She smiles
He flounders a little
She offers her hand
11
Valerie Plame
Joe
Joe Wilson
Former Ambassador to Gabon
Ambassador in Iraq during the Gulf War
Married twice
Has a reputation for trouble
You've been misinformed
was only acting Ambassador in Iraq
Valerie smiles
He does too
It's electric
So what do you do, Ms
Plame
: --   in bed
She suddenly shakes
Cries out
Joe wakes to see his wife, lost in a nightmare
--
1997
'm an energy consultant for a firm in Brussels
And do you enjoy your work
--   -- She doesn't wake
He strokes her arm
On her wrist --
--
Valerie looks into Joe's eyes
love it
Joe carries the 3 year old twins,  and  in pyjamas, downstairs
Val
Where's the babysitter
into the kitchen
Valerie, coat on, bolting coffee
12
Didn't  say
She can't get here til after lunch
(Sighs) 'll work from home this morning
Are you sure- Relax
Me `n Spongebob are on it
The kids start fighting
She picks up her bag
Break it up
Trevor don't hit    We're having supper with the your sister
Mitchells Tuesday
But if you want to skip it they know you're busy- promise to behave
She stops
Melts
Kisses him
promise to behave
See
We're all gonna be on our best behavior
She closes the front door
Joe looks momentarily marooned
He begins picking up soft toys off the floor
(
) Counter Proliferation tracks and thwarts nuclear and  acquisition by rogue nations and non-state actors
An agent walks six analysts through a crowded open plan office
People squeezed in cubbyholes
Papers everywhere
13
(') We're the fastest growing division in the Agency, which sounds cool but means you may have to share a desk
Work like hell for years you may get your own cubbyhole
And if you're a workaholic, they make you boss, and you get- He knocks on a door
Opens it
Valerie comes bursting out
Bad time
We follow Valerie into   -- where her colleague, Ali, 30s, Indian, is on the phone
Hafiz hired a cleaner
(Into phone) Gotta go
Kuala Lumpur just went live
Ali hangs up and follows her
She scans the page she's holding
What time did he call this in
11 hundred hours
- Hafiz, in a corridor in his Uncle's offices, late at night
Light from a photocopier flashes across his sweating face
/ (') The asset passed the intel to the cleaner at approximately eight fifteen local time, this morning
'  - Hafiz hands a folded piece of paper to his elderly She puts it in her apron pocket
(
) She made the drop fifty minutes later
just outside Ko Yonh Subway station
14
alights, leaving her New Straits Times on the seat
next to her along picks it up
--
-- The paper is opened to a centre page feature of George Bush
There is Hafiz's photocopy
a field team picked it up and and 'd it at the safe house
In a cheap hotel room, under a broken ceiling fan another Asian man scans the image into a laptop, behind him the strikes a match and burns the original
' , Valerie, in her cramped office with half a dozen field agents, briefs from a diagram on a white board
We have a shipment
holding company in Pakistan asks Tabir to purchase 200 un-identified units, trackable by part numbers, from
Teludyne Electronics of Lowell Massachusetts
, Two men (from the briefing) in a   watch a red truck leave an industrial unit in the suburbs of Lowell
(
) The shipment is delivered to Goza Tech in Secaucus, New Jersey
, 600 The red truck turns into a low grey set of prefab buildings in a business park
The  watches a forklift truck lift a single pallet out and deliver it into the warehouse
(
) There it's bundled in with a second shipment of legitimate electronic parts, and documentation attached that masks its point of origin
15
Valerie, Ali, and the rest of the team walk through the neon lit maze of packing cases and pallets towards a concerned looking superintendent
/ Its then dispatched as medical electronics en route to a company in Johannesburg South Africa
First it spends the night at a bonded customs warehouse in the Port of Jersey
That's the intercept
Can  help you
shows  to the owner
Sir, we're from
customs
Can take a moment of your time
He takes off his cap and looks sick
An agent cracks the packing case with a crowbar: white cardboard boxes
Valerie draws a Buck knife and slices it open, rumaging in polystyrene chips and comes out with a Coke sized white plastic cylinder with two contacts at one end
What the hell is that
Valerie looks at the object
: becomes of rolling hellfire
It mushrooms twenty thousand feet over the New Mexico Desert
An awesome sight
(
) spark gap is a high energy voltage-controlled switching device
As a gaggle of schoolkids watch the sixty year old footage of the Manhattan Project on a plasma screen, Valerie passes through the compound with  , a geeky scientist in his 30s
He holds the intercepted component
16
To detonate a nuclear bomb you need to be able to switch high voltage, high current electrical circuits at very high speeds to the nearest hundredth of a nanosecond
They pass through a security door to the labs
The extremely short rise times are achieved by discharging a low- induct, high-voltage capacitor through the spark gap into the bridge wire inside the warhead
The ballpark is 5 kilovolt and 1 mf for the capacitor, with a peak current between 500 and 1000 amperes
Does it have other uses
High speed photography, industrial photo-chemistry
Zapping kidney stones
Is someone out there building the fire train for a nuclear device component by component
(Shakes his head) You're talking one helluva complicated process
This guy is just one tiny piece in the jigsaw
She hands him a piece of paper
This is a list of other components exported through the same network over the last 3 years
Tilt tables
timing equipment
High speed monitioring devices
(Reading) Quartz rate sensors
Calibration units
(Takes off his glasses
) It's not kidney stones
Thank god you stopped this
'm not stopping it
17
(Confused) don't understand
Valerie's team are in a briefing room
We keep the transaction live
Trace it all the way to the end user
She takes them through a full whiteboard
The shipment arrives in Joburg on the 21st
It's put in an unmarked container and shipped to the free trade zone in Dubai
Our asset meets there with the buyer on the 23rd
She tosses a spark gap to one of her team
Dr Forster and his team at Los Alamos have altered the impedence timings of the spark gaps by a fraction of a nanosecond
Basically, they won't know it doesn't work til it doesn't work
Can we put a wire on the asset
The door at the back opens
The Deputy of  enters with the Chief
Everybody sits up
Valerie continues
Too dangerous
This network has avoided detection for years
Expect meticulous operational security and counter surveillance
Any questions
They disperse
The deputy director of  buttonholes her
Val
The chief wants to see you
Valerie walks with  and , their chief
18
Val, seventh floor have issued a directive for a Joint Task Force on Iraq
We want you to head it up
Valerie doesn't blink
Yes Sir
You can pick your team
This is top priority
Down the line
What about the Dubai op
Mike says you got a hunch on the buyer
Manucher Vaziri
Syrian National
Based out of Karachi
On a wire picked up in Cairo he talks about componentry from a known source in Pakistan he's moving to an unnamed Gulf state
Iraq
Vaziri's devoutly Shia
Iraq's controlled by the Sunni
Saddam's Sunni
There's no way this is Iraq
They're all good Muslims right
And Martin Luther King and the are both Christian
Great job
From Monday,  need you both eyes on Iraq
: At the door, they shake hands
Mike and Valerie walk off

Trevor hauls in the flex of a globe lamp on a top shelf
They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States
In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be catastrophic

Everybody
Let's take a look at you
Four arms
Four legs
No broken bones

That's fine
Look guys
Heather's here

The President crossing the White House Lawn, towards Marine One
As the kids play with Heather in the lounge, Joe makes a coffee in the kitchen, watching the President on  as he mounts the ramp
The cabin door shuts tight
wash of rotor blades
The chopper lifts off
Joe takes the coffee and walks out onto the deck
He looks up into the sky
The deck shakes, the sky turns black as Marine One thunders over low
Deafening

Val takes her eye from a magnifying stand
, No-one around
Alone, , surrounded by piles of files and folders, scans pictures of military hardware, checks it against its corresponding aerial signature
(
) How do you think she got the job
She cocks an ear
, two male analysts: 1 Memo comes out saying we got two percent women in executive roles
It's quotas by another name
There's ten guys  could name could do the job better
2 wonder who's she's fucking
She freezes

) Don't you have a home to go to
She turns
, her director is there
He smiles
: 21
In 's office
She reading the document
released the report Tuesday
aren't buying and State kicked it back, but it's making waves in the Vice President's Office
(He looks at her) What do you think
He's qualified
He's been there hundreds of times
Knows the arena inside out
You don't look overjoyed
He's been working hard to build his business
Then there's the twins
Money's kinda tight right now
(He looks at her) We're at full stretch here
You know that better than anyone
He's helped us before
Could you ask him to come in

The vast lobby at Langley
Operatives, analysts, come and go in the hushed marble atrium
Joe in a dark suit, attache case, stares at the wall
Reads the inscription
"In Honor of Those Members of the Central Intelligence Agency Who Gave Their Lives in The Service of Their Country" 1997
Joe and Valerie lie in bed
Face to face
You want to go out for breakfast
Or stay here
want to live with you
She looks into his eyes
tear rolls out of her eye
22
There's something  have to tell you
-- The memorial on the North Wall
No names
Just rows and rows of anonymous black stars
Dead Covert Officers

What are you thinking
Is your name really Valerie
She smiles
(
) Joe
Joe turns
His wife is standing there
(Brightly) Hey
He moves away from the memorial
In this unfamiliar context, this is slightly awkward
Nice place you got here
Cosy
(Smiles) need to get you cleared

big  badge on Joe
Side by side
They go down
You work in the basement
(Deadpan) Actually
work in Georgetown for Brewster Jennings
We're a small firm of Venture Capitalists
That must be interesting work

It pays the rent

Valerie leads Joe into a windowless room
Five or six analysts
Agents from  and State Department
This is Joe Wilson
Joe, this is Mike, the Deputy Chief of
(They shake) 'll leave you guys to it
Businesslike, Valerie leaves
Joe sits
Silence
Mr Wilson, what can you tell us about Yellowcake
Joe looks around the room
Clears his throat
believe it's a concentrate obtained from uranium ore used to create fissile material for weapons programs
But 'm not a scientist
What about Niger
The  Human Development Index ranks Niger the number one Least Liveable country in the world started my Foreign Service there
As Ambassador to Gabon,  travelled back many times
Then as director of Africa policy for the  under President Clinton,  frequently visited, often met with Prime Minister Mayaki
know the former foreign minister
know the Minister of Mines
The Office of the Vice President has received a report concerning a memorandum of sale between the governments of Niger and Iraq for the purchase of five hundred tons of Yellowcake Uranium ore
(He fixes Joe) () 24
(cont'd) don't have to tell you how serious this allegation is
No Sir, you don't
He leans forward
This is a request from the Vice President
Can you help us

) Bien revenue a Niger

Joe, unshaven, shakes hands with a 60 year old Nigerien
Par la grace 'Allah
Comment allez vous,
Bonzala
- We subtitle the mixture of French dialect and Hausa
Last time we met  was Minister, you Ambassador
Now, thanks to Allah, we are free men
You're growing a beard, no
25
So it would seem
So tell me
How can Niger help its old friend, America
,
Several analysts sit around a table, including the ,
Two of them are the guys who were bad-mouthing Valerie
Another is  , a dough-faced offical from (Weapons Intelligence Non Proliferaton and Control)
(Reads) "In summer 2001 Iraq sought to purchase 60,000 high alloy 7075-T4 aluminum tubes manufactured in China
The high spec of these tubes led us to conclude they were intended for the enrichment of uranium
In August 2001
Turner
" That's me
"flew to Vienna, to meet with scientists
Mr
Turner produced this report, aspects of which represents the 's present position
" 'm happy to take questions
The  concluded late last year that these tubes were probably for artillery use, and the  agreed they exactly matched those used by Iraq for artillery rockets
Where are the tubes
has them
We've examined them
This is my point
None of you guys has even seen the tubes
've seen them
Everyone looks at her
And when was that
26
Valerie looks up
Slightly surprised by his tone
When  seized them last year in Jordan
When  headed the covert team that intercepted them, bought back samples and delivered them to you guys at
couple of the analysts try not to smile
So  take it you're not a nuclear expert
These tubes are an match for those developed by German scientist Gernot Zippe in the 50s
Valerie turns to her notes from her reading
You're right
'm no nuclear expert
But Dr
Houston Wood, at Virginia  atomic facility is
He also knows Dr Zippe, who's 89 and lives in Austria, and he told him that the wall thickness of the Iraqi tubes was three or four times the thickness of his design
And the tubes are twice as long as Zippe's design
In fact the only similarity between his tubes and the alumumium tubes is that they're made of aluminium
metal that hasn't been used in gas centrifuges since 1952
The chauvanist analysts share a look of respect for Valerie
Still Turner doesn't give up
went to Vienna
Canada
've worked on this for months
They're centrifuges
Fact
So basically, they're your tubes and if we don't let you win you're going home
27
That's pathetic
Joe
No one is saying you're wrong here
But if you're right, it's huge
So we ask the question
Right
We have to ask the question
Joe rides shotgun, in a 4X4, driven deep into the Sahara
/ Niger has two Uranium mines in the Sahara desert
One's flooded
The other's run by , a French subsidiary, jointly controlled by the Japanese and Germans
collossal earthworks defacing the flat, hot moonscape
Joe is escorted around the mines by a small team
500 tons of Yellowcake is not an off the books size transaction, it represents a 40% production increase in the nation's annual output of uranium
sale that size would leave a huge paper trail
Joe sits on his bed, under the noisy fan, making notes
(
) Any documentation would by law have to be signed by the Prime Minister, Foreign minister, and the Minister of the mines
But say it was an off the books deal
The long road back from the mines the previous day, Joe's Land Rover pulls over
Everyone comes out to see them
(
) How do you hide the transportation of 500 tons of anything, let alone lightly refined uranium
() 28
(
) (cont'd) You're talking fifty semi tractor trucks on one road through villages where nothing passed for months except maybe one bush taxi
It would be the biggest event for months
To say they forgot, it's like kids forgetting Christmas
--   '
-- Joe sits at the dining room table, debriefed by two agents, over Chinese take out
The droughts of the 80s and 90s were met by millions of dollars of Aid, which continues to this day
It just doesn't make sense Niger would compromise this lifeline
For that reason, and the others 've given, it's my opinion that the sale couldn't happen
: Joe shows them out
Shuts the door
Valerie appears
What happens next
They write a report
Give it to the analysts
It'll be re-written, then kicked upstairs where it'll be thrown in with whoever else's report they got- Joe snorts derisively
You guys are hysterical
can't believe you're actually gonna send someone else all the way out there to ask exactly the same questions
You can't compile Intelligence from a single source
That's not Intelligence
That's an opinion
can save the  some air fare here
There isn't a snowflakes chance in hell this thing happened
29
Say who
Says me
What if you're wrong
One guy says it's true
It's not true
Lots of guys say it's true, it's still not true
It's intelligence
It's slow
Painstaking
But it works
Checks and balances
What am , a check or a balance
Probably neither
You're a teeny tiny weeny cog in a giant machine
But you did your job
You should feel good
They count on that
That's why they don't pay you
'm not feeling that 007 right now
She puts her arms around his neck
Kisses him sexily
can get the kids to make you a medal, if it'll help
Us double oh's are more about the gratuitous sex
'll see what  can do
They start making out
: Mr
President, in your speeches now you rarely talk or mention Osama bin Laden
Why is that
30
' leans over an analyst's desk as together they study photographs of a Syrian man in his sixties on the analysts screen
The  is on in the corner of the computer screen
The idea of focusing on one person indicates people don't understand the scope of the mission
Terror is bigger than one person
So  just don't spend that much time on him, Kelly, to be honest with you
Valerie looks up and stops
, his assistant and  , walk past
Heads turn
Why is the  here
'
The Deputy director hears a knock
It's Valerie
Mike
The Vice President's men are here
What the fuck
No windows
lone analyst sits sweating bullets

Relax Mike
The Veep's just dotting the i's
Bullshit Jim
The only time a Vice President comes to Langley is to cut a fucking ribbon
Look
Cheney doesn't trust us
This shit with Dick goes back thirty years
It'll blow over
(He turns to Valerie) Where are we on Iraq
Behind the curve Sir
Most of the intel is outdated
We don't have a single operative or asset in the country
What about geo-satellite imaging
With respect sir, you can't look at this problem from space and make a call
So talk to the defectors
The defectors are unreliable
Most are supplied through a former asset the agency's had on a burn notice since `95
It's a racket
They walk in and get paid to say whatever the Pentagon wants to hear
So we're blind
We need sources we can rely on
We need to get in close
How close
Inside

Jim
Val thinks she can get us inside the weapons program
Pavitt looks at her
How
: Rows and rows of stationary
Shelves filled pads, pens
Pencils
Photocopy paper
Shelves twenty feet high
Valerie selects a pad and a pencil and approaches the counter where a lugubrious woman in a pink Sari is doing Su Doku
Valerie pays for her notebook and steps out into --- , The streets throng with traffic
Somalian taxi drivers
Central Africans ferrying exotic produce
Egyptians smoking apple tobacco
Colors
Bustle
different world
Valerie, head shrouded in a scarf, puts the notebook in her bag and pushes her way along the crowded street, buzzing with scooters and pedestrians
She steps through an archway into -- , An ancient cloister filled with an excited clamor
Fresh faced students pile into a lecture theater
She follows
(
) The warping of the extra dimension is analogous to the warping of spacetime in the vicinity of a massive object eg: a black hole
Wrapt Silence
Valerie sits at the back
She opens her new notebook and listens
-- An old Middle-Eastern professor is giving a lecture with the help of an over-head projector
Giant shadow hands deftly trace algebraic formulae onto projector
33
Red-shifting, generates a large ratio of energy scales so that the natural scale at one end of the extra dimension is much larger
Valerie watches
(
) It's an honor to meet you at last Dr
Harper
The prof walks with Valerie talking excitedly
was unable to attend your String- Gravity seminar at  but  read a transcript
Truly groundbreaking work
Thank you
The Faculty have just moved me, so you must excuse the mess
He shows Valerie up a stone staircase and through a door
Books everywhere
Lots still in boxes
My old rooms were on the other side of the courtyard
They were smaller but  got the morning sunlight
Will you settle for Peppermint tea
It's fresh
Thank you
The professor hands Valerie a cup of mint tea and sits
Tell me Dr
Harper, did you read my latest paper on quarks
cite your 1995 essay more than once
would be very intrigued to know what you made of my findings
34
She sits forward
Sir, Dr Harper is in Cambridge, Massachusetts
She received a call yesterday requesting she stay home for 48 hours
The professor blinks
Taken aback
don't understand
Who are you
'm sorry for misleading you
But 'm here to ask you the same question
(He stops) Because you are not Professor Aziz
He stands there
Thrown
'm sorry to surprise you like this Sir
Your name is Doctor Harif Al Fallari
You were born in Basra
The old man looks perplexed
Even a little amused
He sits
Well
This is indeed a strange morning
Madam, there seems to have been a mistake
My name is Said Uhmah Aziz
am a theoretical physicist
model space
've never been to Basra
'm a teacher
'd like to be of assistance
But 'm afraid  can't help you
So you're not Doctor Fallari
Madam
've never even heard of this man
You were not lead engineer at the Osirak nuclear installation outside Tikrit
You were never captured by the Mukhbarat escaping to Syria
You didn't spend three years in the Abu Dhan jail
35
This is absurd
You weren't tortured
Broken
You didn't finally escape and arrive here in Cairo with nothing
No
Dr
Al Fallari had two daughters
They were taken by Uday Hussein's private guard
He never saw them again
He stares at the floor
That didn't happen
They never existed
He remains motionless
Valerie watches him closely
need names
Of your colleagues in the weapons programmes
The lives of hundreds of thousands of your people may depend upon it
He looks up at Valerie tears in his eyes know Tarif
know what happened
He walks over to the window
he takes off his jacket
His shirt, pulls it off over his head and turns his back to her
He's been mutilated and burned all up his back
Slowly he turns
Deep scars
Burns
You know nothing
Sunset
Traders are packing up
Valerie hurries into -- up some rickety stairs and unlocks a graffiti covered door
Inside she takes out the notepad, her heart beating fast
On the page,

She pulls a ruggedized laptop from under the bed and pushes the plug into a bare wires socket
It fizzes
She starts to type the names into the computer

at his desk
His secretary pops her head round the door
They're back
An analyst sits opposite Scooter Libby
He's so nervous he can barely open his eyes
1 The Iraqis were trying to buy the tubes off the internet
They spent three million dollars weather- proofing the tubes
Plus the tubes are roughly twice too long
Now you could argue that that's to disguise them, you could saw them in half
That's sixty thousand tubes
(Mimes sawing) mean whew
Saddam's gonna get the mother of all blisters
Laughs
Libby stares, unsmiling
Keeps sawing
Wishing to God he'd never started
The door opens and the analyst, white as a sheet, comes out
couple of colleagues are waiting outside
2 How was it
1 Don't make jokes
1 drifts his way back to his desk
2 swallows, and disappears into the `interrogation' room
, the chief analyst, comes out of the stall
2 is there, throwing up in the sink
37
2 He thinks  don't know how serious it is
weeks and weeks of fifteen hour days, we've gone back over and over it
'll handle this
: Scooter listens patiently to , the chief analyst
And so apart from all the scepticism surrounding the specification, the analysis from the  which  believe is numbered in the report
(Stops
Changes tack) Mr Libby
Energy department nuclear scientists are among the most boring people on the planet
They can talk about gas centrifuges until you want to jump out of a window
And maybe once every ten years someone comes along and says "so, tell me about gas centrifuges"
That's literally the only time you should listen to these guys
If they say an aluminium tube is not for a gas centrifuge it's like a fish talking about water
We've been over this data with you now five, six times
And
We don't really know how you want us to play this
Libby listens
He nods
Waits
Let me level with you here Paul don't know what these tubes are for
From everything you're saying, there could be something to this, but very likely not, right
Exactly
May  ask a question
When you say we don't really know how to play this, what do you mean
38
(Stops
Turns white) 'm just saying  don't know how to say it any other way than that- Except you didn't say `' you said `we'
So you and the others have discussed how to "play" these briefings
Why does the  feel the need to play these briefings
No
mean that
Ok
didn't mean what  just said
Which part
The last part
Or other things too
'm a getting a little confused- You want me to come back
No
no
The temperature drops five degrees
You don't know why 'm here do you
In 1991 the United States invaded Iraq, and afterwards weapons inspectors discovered Saddam was six months off enriching uranium to sufficiently high specification to make a nuclear bomb
He had fissile material
And not a single person at the , from the  down to the janitor had the slightest clue that such a program even existed
So now, one decade on, are you telling me that you're 100% sure these tubes are not intended to create nuclear weapons
Sir
With intelligence, nothing's 100 percent
39
So
What
Are you
Ninety nine percent sure
Ninety eight
You can't put an exact figure
You can't be that precise
But if you had to say, could you say you're ninety seven percent sure
Is there a three percent chance you've got this wrong
Or four
Or five
Still pretty good odds
You like those odds Paul
You willing to put your name to that
Are you ready to make that call
don't make the call, Sir-
(Fixing him) Yes you do Paul
Each time you interpret a piece of data
Each time you choose a "maybe" over a "perhaps" you make a call decision
And right now you're making lots of little decisions adding up to a big decision and out there's a real world where millions of people depend upon you being right
But what if there's a one percent chance you're wrong
Can you say for sure you'll take that chance and state, as a fact, that this equipment is not intended for a nuclear weapons programme
The analyst sits frozen
Do you know what one percent of the population of this country is
It's three million, two hundred and forty thousand souls
Sir
We're not machines
We
It
We look at the evidence, we game it out
Not everyone agrees all the time
It's a process
40
It's a process
Yes
And not everyone agrees
Exactly
Who doesn't agree
:
Full military funeral, in the rain
hundred mourners from Langley
Some uniformed
coffin draped in the flag : hymn is sung
In the bleechers, the analyst from the meeting earlier, pauses in the break between verses and squints through the rain at the bank of seats across the grave

Next to him, ,
Next to him

What the fuck is Joe Turner doing next to the

Friday the took him to the White House
He briefed the President on Aluminum tubes
You're fucking kidding me

So we've got a list of names
The Mukhbarat watch the scientists night and day
Their houses are bugged
Their friends are followed
Say we drop in a light weight tac team outside the city
You get through the checkpoints and roadblocks
You show up in my bedroom in the dead of the night with an armed tac team ask me to help out Uncle Sam

What about forcible extraction of two or three of the main targets
No
We've got 29 names
want to get to them all

You can't use     the inspectors
You can't use tac

Joe opens his eyes
Rolls across
He's alone

Valerie is by the front door, dressed, cinched black mack, suitcase
Hey, did  wake you up
42
It's three forty five
gotta go
have to be at the airport in forty five minutes
Joe, still half-asleep, catches up
Well
how long this time mean
Do we need childcare for tomorrow- left a post-it by the lamp
Its all on the post-it
Right
Its on the post-it
didn't want to wake you
(Senses something) Are you
We've been leaving post-its for each other for months now
we talk via Post-It
That fridge is like a dead letter drop

Laughs) Jesus
Listen to me
sound like an old
Some- (He bangs the door) don't know where you go
Who you meet
If you're in some jail, or lying in some ditch in Jordan, Beirut
And if you go missing, can't tell anyone because you were never there
'd never know what happened
don't know where you go
'm going to Cleveland
He stops
Thunder-robbed
'll be home tonight
(Then) It's on the Post-It

In the window, Valerie and Dr
Sawsan Al Haddad sip coffee
How long is it since you saw your brother
1989
attended a medical convention over there
Before that, in `83, he came here for an engineering conference
Twice in twenty five years
We try to stay in contact
It's difficult
Would you like to go back and see him
holds her gaze
44
You want me to become a spy
We need to ask Sa'ad some questions
Do you think he would answer them
'm a doctor
work hard
'm also a mother
have a small girl and 'm all she has
We can help your brother
Right now he is extremely valuable to us
And to Saddam
The Mukbarat watch him night and day
He could come here Sawsan
He's an expert physicist
He'd have a job, his children, his family would be safe
You, your daughter could see him whever you want
Sawsan
Can you help us
won't do anything to help you don't know you
would only do this for Sa'ad
Then do it for Sa'ad
Valerie watches her
What would  have to do
Westerners mix with Mid-Easterners
tea trolley crosses the floor and disappears into a service elevator

The elevator opens and a tea trolley stops outside room 1201
The door is opened by Valerie's colleague
Ali
It is wheeled inside
As Ali signs, cups of tea are poured
45
He carries one into   and hands it to Sawsan, who sits on the edge of a bed wearing a long black traditional Abaya
There are two other agents there, with Valerie
One of them is holding a notebook
1 The pages of this notebook are fast burning
You write on them like normal, but if you need to destroy them in an emergency
He whips out a zippo
Sets fire to one
It's gone in a flash
1 You have two of these in your luggage
Now this is the only pen we want you to use
The other agent shows her a pen
2 The ink in this pen is visible for 10 seconds
Only when given the the correct chemical fixative can it be read
-  am not taking any of this
If the Mukhbarat find any of this they will do things to me you cannot imagine
Tell me what you need to know
will memorise it
2 Ma'am, we have 50 very specific questions, some extremely technical
You have 206 different bones in your body
Do you want their names in english, latin or arabic
They look to Val for a decision
She can't help but smile
: Later
The agents have gone
Just Sawsan and Valerie
How do you feel
She's trying to drink her tea, but she's shaking
Val takes her hand and silently grips it
46
Just remember, if anyone asks you anything, if anyone stops you stay calm and tell the truth
You're just visiting your brother
Keep it simple and keep to the truth
Except it's not the truth
How do you do it
She searches Valerie's face
How do you be someone you're not
How do you lie to someone
To their face
How do you do it
Valerie looks at her
Before she can answer we -- : -- Ali checks his watch
Knocks on the door
Opens it
Valerie and Sawsan look up from the edge of bed
It's time
taxi cab stops and  is helped out by the driver
From a car across the street -- Valerie watches: Sawsan rolls her suitcase into the terminal
At the door she glances behind her
and disappears inside
Ali and Valerie get out the car looking every bit like tourists, suitcases, sunglasses, guidebook etc
Valerie and Ali enter the revolving doors and follow her at a distance across the shiny beige and gold marble floors

Valerie aims her zoom lens camera and as if appraising it as a purchase, firing off some shots of the Iraqi agents
Sawsan reaches the desk and is stopped by the two men
They watch her talking to the men, handing over her passport
: The Iraqi agent stares at her
He asks a question in arabic No subtitles
Sawsan responds
She remains cool, almost disinterested
The men exchange sentences of arabic

Heart beating
At last they allow Sawsan through, she checks onto the flight

: ( ) -- And as we saw in reporting just this morning, he is still trying to acquire some of the specialized aluminum tubing one needs to develop centrifuges that would give you an enrichment capability
: ( ) --
Aluminium tubes
Specifically aluminum tubes
There's a story in The New York Times this morning
want to attribute The Times
don't want to talk about specific intelligence sources but it's now public that he has been seeking to acquire the kinds of tubes that are necessary to build a centrifuge

) It's a coordinated leak

Valerie on the phone, soaked in sweat, watches Meet the Press on cable
She's on the phone to -- --       on the phone to : Someone in the  leaked to the New York Times and now they're across the networks quoting the leak
"Smoking gun"
"Mushroom cloud"
They're using the same words
It's co-ordinated
'm coming home
: ( ) ( ) Is Iraq's regime of Saddam Hussein right now a clear and present danger to the United States
( ) There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein's regime is a danger to the United States and to its allies, to our interests
The problem here is that there will always be some uncertainty about how quickly he can acquire nuclear weapons
But we don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud
From the Wilsons, a homely glow emanates

dinner party
Dirty plates, red wine, late night
Joe, Val and their friends
Joe is preparing to light a cigar
Number one  always open the window and close the door
50
You can still smell it
You want me to roll up a wet towel
Like a teenager smoking in his bedroom
Maybe sandbag my study
What's wrong with the deck
You used to smoke like crazy when  met you
Oh right
Middle of winter
It's minus ten degrees
The whole point- Put on a coat
Valerie
Steve
Help me out
Val
The whole point of a cigar you gotta get a little Winston Churchill vibe goin'
Slippers crackling fire
Musty books, slippers
Maybe a faithful hound
Exactly
You can't be freezing your balls off in a  alone in the dark
Don't think Churchill
Think Scott of the Antarctic
That's it
quit
He tosses the cigar down
She kisses his nose
Honey Joe that's terrific       It's about personal choice
news
'm so proud of you
It's Joe's personal choice to gas his kids
My father smoked cigars at the dinner table for forty years
And look at me
51
Joe feigns a cough
Laughter
Joe slaps his sides manfully
: -- The conversation has turned to politics
It was on Blitzer and Meet      It came from the Times
Judy the Press
All over the news
Miller
The New York Times
Exactly
Can  ask a dumb question
What is an aluminum tube
They have the tubes Saddam      They're for centifuges
For was using to make a bomb
enriching uranium
How
Who knows what they are
Everybody knows they are
The question is what else does he have
Did you read about this Valerie
was in Europe on business last week
missed it
Basically Saddam bought all these tubes
And we've nailed him
We got them
They're packed with uranium
They're not packed with uranium
Right
They're for purifying it
The bomb comes later
It's how you boil it up it to make the big one
Look out Israel
Says who
It's a bunch of tubes
Joe you know about this stuff, what do you think they're for
These tubes
What's your hunch
52
All eyes on Joe
He tales off his glasses
Makes them wait
Well Jeff
don't know anything about these tubes
'm not qualified
But  suppose the real question here is- interrupts, stealing Joe's limelight
It's a pretext
50% of Americans think Saddam blew up the Towers- The table erupts in discussion, leaving Joe marooned
Valerie spots it instantly, as he broods
He's a threat
You can't tell me he's not a threat
He's mad
Like Hitler
If we'd stopped Hitler in the thirties- Joe sits there
Fuming
He's not Hitler
He's Saddam
We put him there
Why
It suited us
He's our fault
Always was
Right on cue, Joe rounds on the hapless
Have you met him
Fred
Have you met Saddam
Have you looked him in the eye
Did he threaten you
Did he threaten to kill you
You don't know Saddam
You don't know what you're talking about
Joe gets up
Joe walks out
So
What's for dessert
(To himself) " may be some time"
'm sorry Fred
thought we were just talking
What is this

Mmm
That smells good

At the end of the day, who really knows
You're right Sue
Who knows
: Alone, Sawsan rolls her small suitcase across the polished floor past a group of Iraqi soldiers
Saddam-a-like in a dark suit takes her passport
His eyes bore into her

He takes her suitcase from her
He leads her out of the queue, down a strip lit corridor and into a windowless room in bowels of the airport
Wait here
He shuts the door
Sawsan tries to control her breathing

Hands search through her luggage
They unwrap a framed photograph of  and her daughter, smiling
The officer turns it over in his hands
: The officer returns with her bags
Drops them on the floor
Wait here

Sawsan appears
On the other side, there stands a tall Iraqi man
Her relief is enormous
They embrace

You can wait all day
Sawsan smiles at her brother
, , An extended family of great uncles and aunts, grand children and cousins greet Sawsan's arrival
Getting out of the car she is surrounded by hugs and tears and laughter
Sawsan removes the framed photograph of her and her daughter
It is cooed over then given pride of place on the mantel
, Sawsan and her brother are alone in the kitchen washing up after the big welcome home meal
His five year old daughter watches from the stairs, fascinated by her american aunt
The house looks very different

' It's falling down
In `93 they bombed government buildings here
The foundations are shattered
Sa'ad  need to speak- He holds up his hand and shakes his head
' (speaking normally) have been meaning to repaint the exterior
Saad keeps a finger to his lips
Fear in his eyes
' but it is difficult to find the time when  am so busy at work
but the gardens are still the same as when we were children
The gardens yes of course,  would like to see them
, Sawsan and her brother speak low
He seems very nervous
They can help you if you get out to the Kurdish zone
' (exasperated) am watched Sawsan
If  drive even twenty minutes north of Baghdad they will stop me
They've given me questions for you
' What questions
(Closes eyes) How close is your program to a warhead
When and where is the first test scheduled
How much 235- grade uranium do you have
Identify other scientists in the program
() 56
(cont'd) Who in the military controls the program
Which of the- (opens her eyes) What is it
Sa'ad stares at her in disbelief
' They do not know
What Sa'ad
' The program was destroyed in 1991
The Americans destroyed it, they know that
My god
what else
How advanced is the centrifuge facility
Which method are you using to separate fissile isotopes
' This is insane
We don't have spare parts to keep a tank on the road have to work at a plant which develops fertilizer

Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof -- the smoking gun -- that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud

Joe is met by a man in his 20s
Mr Wilson
Jason Neal
How was your flight

She has the file
We need Mike to see this
And Bill
: Joe sits on stage with three academic types
In the hundred seater auditorium, just a couple dozen or so students
Ambassador Wilson is the last American diplomat to meet with Saddam Hussein
In 1990, when Saddam threatened to execute anyone sheltering foreigners, Wilson appeared at a press conference wearing a noose around his neck, declaring, "If the choice is to allow Americans to be taken hostage or be executed,  will bring my own fucking rope
" Saddam backed down and Wilson evacuated several thousand
He came home and was taken to the Oval Office where the President introduced him to the War Cabinet as an American hero
That's not quite true
It wasn't the Oval Office it was the Roosevelt Room
Laughter
Valerie walks with  and , briefing him
58
Sawsan's brother worked with five hundred scientists at the Safa factory
In `91 it was blanket bombed by B52s
Hussein Kamel, Saddam's son in law, kept the scientists together, threatening to kill them if they tried to leave
But sanctions destroyed the economy, and when Kamel was executed in `95, the team just drifted apart
They're all say the same thing Mike
Everyone
: nervous history major stands
Does Saddam pose an imminent threat to National Security
haven't seen the intelligence
'm not qualified to comment
We have intelligence services working hard to assess just this
But have met Saddam
've looked him in the eye, so  can tell you what saw
During a particularly vicious period of bloodletting in the late eighties, Saddam was asked by his foreign minister why he had executed a certain official who had been a loyal supporter
He said he would rather kill a friend in error than allow an enemy to live
For me, that is the mark of a monster

Joe stays seated
We Americans have faith in ourselves, but not in ourselves alone
We do not claim to know all the ways of Providence, yet we can trust in them, placing our confidence in the loving god behind all of life and all of history
May he guide us now, and may God continue to bless the United States of America
Thank you

Why do you do this job
The paycheck

No
To make a difference
To act
To protect people

Sometimes you fail
He gets in the car, reverses, and drives away
Valerie hurries through the building
Hold the elevator please

Valerie is pacing
Mike is sitting
65
What the fuck is going on Mike
It's like, if there was a baby on the ledge up on seventh, no-one would get up and save it in case the White House wanted it there
Bill's right
This is just one snafu in a thousand we got right now
The scientists are- These scientists are the
If we can't protect them, they'll run to the first country who can
And they'll put them to work

If anyone asks, deny any knowledge

You know she finds me devastatingly attractive- Yeah
Well if you see her say hi

And it's real important
: 67
, (
) Is the President be referring to another African country
've seen the
It's Niger
He's referring specifically to Yellowcake from Niger
Why
Joe listens
It sinks in
: Pete listens nodding
His expression grows darker and darker
Uh huh
see
see
(He listens) What exactly are you proposing to do Joe
' don't know
don't know what to do
(He takes off his glasses) You want my advice
Do nothing
You already did your job
You did your best
You came home
End of story
Niger Pete
Yellowcake from Niger
Pete looks around
Speaks low
Look

Three months and what have we found
No centrifuges
No yellowcake
No bio
No
You think something's up here
Join the queue
Join the line stretches all the way from State to the Pentagon and back
So why has no one's come forward
68
Why you think Joe
We went to war
(He pulls back) Listen
You're a smart guy
As your friend, now
Just
Be smart here mean
you have a wife and a family
It's the White House Pete
It's the President of the United States
Yes it is Joe
Now go take a long look in the mirror and say that again
Joe puts the phone down
Upstairs he can hear a child crying
: One of the twins is asleep
The other standing in her cot
Joe scoops her up
Jiggles her and comforts her
Lays her back down
: Joe comes down the stairs
In the hall -- coat on, soaking, Valerie
She looks beat
Hey
Are you
Valerie doesn't move
She stands there
Then -- What's wrong Val
Nothing
'm just tired
Whats the matter
what happened
Valerie shakes her head slowly
'm fine
Are the kids asleep
Yeah
They're asleep
'm going to bed

Joe watches her slowly walk up the stairs
Then stares at the space where she was just standing
( ) Let me finish
No
Let me finish
Joe looks at the
He sets his jaw
( ) There are some who feel like that, the conditions are such that they can attack us there
My answer is bring 'em on
: Computerized letter appearing on a screen
Pixellated : Joe writes: "What  Didn't Find in Africa"
Did the Bush administration manipulate intelligence to justify an invasion of Iraq
" "The act of war is the last option of a democracy" "More than 200 American soldiers have lost their lives in Iraq already
" "We have a duty to ensure that their sacrifice came for the right reasons

Libby reads Joe's article: "What  Didn't Find in Africa"
He looks out at a line of satellite broadcast vehicles
: Retired Ambassador Joe Wilson yesterday claimed in a piece in the New York Times that the President mispoke in his State of the Union Address in January, concerning claims that Saddam sought 500 tons of Yellowcake from Niger
Wilson, who was acting Ambassador in Iraq during the first Gulf War, said- Fleischer, on defence, before a packed house, buzzing
Everyone has Joe's article
: Look
There's zero, nada, nothing, new here
The President's statement in the State of the Union was much broader than the Niger question
Is the President's statement correct
: Yes,  see nothing that goes broader that would indicate that there was no basis to the President's broader statement
But specifically on the yellow cake, the yellow cake for Niger, we've acknowledged that that information did turn out to be a forgery
2 The President's statement was accurate
: We see nothing that would dissuade us from the President's broader statement
71
So you believe the British report is true
: 'm sorry

Card is at his desk, watching the briefing on
Uh-oh

They also have that Gerson wrote both speeches
Karl is on line one
He's unhappy- want a transcript of everything across networks, blogs and print citing Ambassador Wilson, Niger or Yellowcake

This has become a trust issue for the President

Then -- Who is Joe Wilson
Libby comes out of his office
He walks round the corner to Rove's office
Rove's secretary is still there
Linda
You still here

Finds a pad

Still driving
- Valerie next to her husband in black tie shakes hands with a visiting dignitary
camera bulb goes off
She eyeballs the cameraman for a moment
Valerie turns onto the 120 freeway
The pad falls into the footwell
She reaches down and her -- 75

He doesn't speak
Good morning
Please

Good morning Sir
Ma'am
Working backwards, we need a matrix of everyone you've come into contact with in a covert capacity back to January 2001
've already started a list Sir
Good
We need to get an idea
fast, of how much this thing bleeds
Sir,  have several live ops at crucial stages, people in the field in critical windows of operation- (Interrupting) One thing at time
Make a list
Then come back here
Don't do anything else
She opens her mouth
Nothing comes out
76
Sir, why is Internal security here
To help us
To help you, and us conduct this damage assessment
Behind her, the Internal security guy stands
Valerie comes out, followed by security
She goes left
This way please
She turns and follows him
As she passes desks, she can feel people looking at her
The news has spread fast
Valerie enters an empty office
The door is closed behind her
On the desk is a notepad and a telephone
She sits
She picks up the phone
The phone isn't connected
She sits staring at the blank page

At the end of the corridor: the Internal security guy follows
Ms Plame

It's over
The children are playing with Power Rangers in the lounge
Joe, at home, speaking on the phone
is on
"Two senior administration officials told me that Wilson's wife suggested sending him to Niger" That means a Vice President, a chief of staff or top advisor

Valerie enters
The twins run out of the lounge towards her
She goes into mom mode
Hey guys
Give mommy a kiss
Mommy
Mommy
Trevor won't let me borrow his Power Ranger
Well, did you say "Please"

drew a clown and a              There's a 1982 act states scarecrow
it's a crime for a government official to intentionally disclose a covert agent
Let's see
Carries a fine of fifty thousand dollars and or up to ten years in jail
Wow
That is one cool scarecrow
(To Samantha) Don't eat that Sam
It's a crayon
It's icky
Give it to mommy
Joe watches her
He can see the tension of her face
How did it go
The phone rings
She freezes
It's been ringing all day
Don't pick it up
Who've you spoken to
Joe, who have you spoken to
Hello
(he holds the phone out) It's Lisa
Valerie looks blind sided
who wants to watch
Scoops them up and leaves us with Val
She composes herself
Hello
Val's friend Lisa is in her lounge
Her kids are playing
Val
Are you
Whats going on

Lisa
Yes

Listen- (She steels herself) 'm sorry
can't talk about this
can't
can't make a comment on this right now
: Lisa's apartment
Another angle
Two other friends
Wrapt
You can't make "a comment"
Val
Your name is in the paper

'm sorry
'll call you tomorrow

Joe is standing there
Your mom called
And your Uncle
And Janey called from Chicago wrote them down
(Then) And Andrea Mitchell called
She says White House sources say that quote "the real story here is not the sixteen words but Wilson and his wife"
Would  care to comment
Yeah  fuckin' would care to comment
She wants me on the show day after tomorrow
don't want you to go on
Joe sits stiffly on the set
make-up artist applies powder to his nose
Going in thirty seconds
81
This is clearly designed as a shot across the bow to those who might step forward, those unnamed analysts who said they were pressured by the White House would think twice about having their own families names being dragged through this particular mud
: was sent to Niger at the request of the Vice President
was not sent by my wife
The issue here is not who sent me here is whether a crime has been committed
You're saying a crime was committed It is a crime to reveal the identity of a covert agent working in the employ of this nations intelligence agencies
This is now a matter for the justice department Pete
The justice department need to establish whether those in the Highest Office sought to destroy the career of a public servant to punish me for speaking the truth
- The new Press Secretary, Scott McClennan, fields questions
First of all, that is not the way this White House operates
() 82
(cont'd) The President expects everyone in his administration to adhere to the highest standards of conduct
No one would be authorized to do such a thing
Will the President move aggressively to see if such a transgression has occurred in the White House
: This is a very serious matter, our administration takes it seriously
've got all the confidence the Justice Department will do a good, thorough job
want there to be full participation, because, April, am most interested in finding out the truth

Valerie is making breakfast

Valerie drives home past the Capitol, still
Valerie gets out and sleep-walks into the building
She joins a small group of mothers watching through glass door, their children playing
One of the mothers nudges another and whispers something
They both look at Valerie, who tenses
Her kids put their coats on and come out
Valerie puts on a bright smile
Kneels to hug them
(Brightly) Hey guys
How was your day
She carries them out, watched by the other mothers
Valerie bussles the kids out of the car
neighbor is mowing his lawn
She tenses as he slows his pace to study her
Another neighbor, searching for his keys stops and watches her too, as she takes the kids into the house
Valerie and the kids come inside

Valerie reads a storybook to her twins
So the caterpillar built a cocoon and it stayed safe inside for weeks
And when it emerged it was a beautiful butterfly
: She closes the door on her sleeping children
She goes next door into-- ' She goes into her closet
Removes a box
Then she taps a code into a small safe and removes another box
Alone, Valerie opens the first box
Photographs of herself with her friends
At college
People's weddings
Birthdays
Valerie and her girlfriends all smiling back at us
Holidays with the same friends
On a hen night
She opens the second box: Different currencies
Credit cards, photos of her with different people
Half a dozen passports
American
couple Canadian
She looks at the photos
Different names
Hair colour
She puts them back in the box
Carefully, and shuts the lid tight shut
She looks at herself in the mirror
The doorbell rings and Valerie gets up
: opens the front door
Standing there is Sawsan
Sawsan
What are you doing here
87
Your name and address are all over the web
There's even a picture of your house
Valerie tries to take this in
Sawsan steps forward -- Sa'ad has disappeared
His wife, his children are missing
My uncle in Mansour
He said they were targeting them
They were killing them
Who
Sa'ad's colleagues
Dr Habbuck was shot dead in the street
Dr Falli was murdered in his hallway
They're killing them
Sawsan, listen to me- know you can't tell me where he is
Just tell me you have him beg you
Please
don't need to know anything
Just tell me he's safe
He's my little brother
Please
If you have him, if he's somewhere
(She starts to cry
) Please
Please,  beg you
Do you have him
have to know
Valerie speaks quietly
We don't have him
Sawsan closes her eyes
She sobs
You said he would be safe
You said we would help
You promised- approaches
Sawsan withdraws
trusted you

She turns her back and walks away
Leaving Valerie alone
: Valerie's boss  is watching  with his wife and kids and her mother, when the doorbell rings
He gets up
The front door opens
Valerie is standing there
Valerie
What are you doing here
Mike steps forward and closes his front door
Mike glances up and down the street
: garage door opens
Valerie and Mike step into his garage and fluorescent light flickers on to reveal boxes of Christmas decorations etc- Falli
Habbuck
Who else
Valerie- Who else Mike
don't know what you're talking about
She fixes him
Eventually he shrugs
(He shrugs) You were right
It's all about the scientists
We made a call
call
We passed your case files to liason
You know yourself we're not great at this stuff
(Off her shock) Val, Mossad were already on the same page
() 89
(cont'd) They've been trying to hunt these guys down since the invasion
You've
(She stops
Looks at him
) We're killing them
We're killing the scientists
Valerie- You'll drive them underground
They'll run straight to Iran
Pakistan
Valerie
This isn't your problem anymore
It's not my problem
It's not my problem
How can you sleep when you know- (With purpose) sleep just fine
Now Carol's mother is here
'm going to have to ask you to leave
It's called counter-proliferation, Mike
She turns and walks out
Valerie gets in her car
Shaking
Shuts the door
She holds her head in her hands and starts to sob
We hear the sound of a crowd cheering
Joe Wilson is on a panel before a crowd of about a thousand
90
At the end of the day, it's of keen interest to me to see whether or not we can get Karl Rove frog- marched out of White House in handcuffs
And trust me when  use that name,  measure my words
Cheers
Applause
Joe looks defiant
: We came all the way from Portland for this
Your support means everything to us
Really
2 You're a true American hero
The real heroes are in Iraq right now fighting a war which was prosecuted on lies and falsehoods
quick montage of Joe being feted
It ends with Joe in a huddle with a dozen or so supporters
My wife and  have never sought publicity
But  know when  tell her about how much support there was here today,  know how thrilled and humbled she'll be
bright  day
Joggers
Lunchtime office workers
Valerie walks alone through the park
She sits down on a bench next to
Thank you for coming here today
wanted to convey my outrage to you in person
In all my experience, nothing has disgusted me like this business
() 91
(cont'd) know it's not easy for you, but want you to know how much the agency appreciates your silence in the light of this matter
We know how damaging this has been to you
We can't afford for this knife fight to go on any longer
get death threats every day
People threatening to kill my husband
Hurt my children
went to the agency and  requested security to protect my family
It was declined
Because quote "My circumstances fall outside budget protocols
" If this is a knife fight, right now, Sir - we're fighting it alone
Pavitt starts to chuckle
Joe Wilson versus the White House
Well, all  can say is Good Luck
But as a friend,  feel  should tell you that those men
He points down the hill at the White House
Those few men in that building over there, that small white house, are the most powerful men in the history of the world
How much of a stretch do you think it would be for them to take on Joe Wilson
He looks at her
Joe's out there on his own Valerie
But  know we can trust you
Speak to your husband
He turns and walks off, leaving her alone, looking at the White House
Joe and Valerie are having supper
The  is on in the background
Joe is energized
Valerie is quiet

( ) The nightmare scenario of an attack on a major city is as real, if not more real, than it was a year ago
Tucker Carlson said yesterday that Wilson's wife sent him on a boondoggle
Said  needed the work
Who needs to work for free
Niger does have restaurants
The Opera
Reminds me alot of Paris
We know if we do not fight the terrorists over there in Iraq, in Afghanistan and across the world, we will have to face them here
Someone from Vanity Fair called

Karl Rove told the Financial Times they're rolling the earth movers over Joe Wilson
Quote

(cont'd) Earth Movers
Well 'm sorry but they don't get me without a fight
Not without a big fucking fight they don't
It's the White House Joe
You seriously think you can pick a fight with the White House and win
They'll bury us
They'll bury us if we don't
How loud can you shout Val
Say we get in an argument you think you're right, and  think your wrong
You start making your point with all your might, and  start shouting back, except 'm the White House, and  can a shout a million times louder
Does that make me right
They lied Val
That's the truth
By the time they're finished here you won't know what that is
: Today Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald, in charge of the enquiry into the leaking of the identity of a covert agent announced that he is convening a Grand Jury to investigate the affair
Among the blizzard of subpoenas issued are ones for the Vice President's chief of Staff Scooter Libby, and special advisor to the President Karl Rove
Both men are under suspicion of having leaked the agent's name to reporters in order to damage former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, a vocal and combative critic of the administration
It is believed that the President himself has been questioned under oath by the

and the twins join the small crowd and watch

The twins are playing on a slide
Valerie sits on a bench
When she looks back, she sees Joe approaching across the playground
He greets the kids, hugging them
Go and play now
And he walks over to Valerie on the bench
95
Hey
Joe carries a heavy brown manilla envelope
From it he removes a thick wad of paper and drops it on the bench
What's that
That is the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
On page thirty six it says "the former ambassador's wife offered up his name" and includes a memorandum written by Valerie Plame which says quote "my husband has good relations with both the prime minister and the former Minister of Mines, both of whom could possibly shed light on this sort of activity
" 've spent a whole year denying just this
Joe wait- Telling everyone who'll listen, on In the press
My wife did not send me on a junket
Joe
didn`t send you
didn't have that power
You sent an email
The  found the email
write hundreds of emails
Why didn't you tell me
At no time in the past twelve months you never thought- didn't make the decision
was asked to write a recommendation
What am  supposed to do
Not say my husband knows about this
They have this now
They will call me a liar
It will stick
They have all the power here, what do  have
() 96
(cont'd) My word
You have to speak up
You have to go on record
Joe- You have to defend us
Now
She's cornered
Shakes her head in frustration
So what do you want me to do Joe
Go to the papers like you did
Write a piece in the New York Times
You know 'd have to submit it to the Agency, and they'll- (Interrupting) The agency
The
Wait
Is this the same Agency which won't give you protection for your children
Is this the same  that's erased your pension
Where's your loyalty Val
To your husband or the
(Shouts louder) It's to
put my family first
Were you putting them first when you wrote that fucking article
People are looking over
The children notice
is stung into silence
'm taking different routes to and from school
'm looking in empty rooms
under the beds every time come home
home we're going to lose because your work has dried up and your clients are running for cover
What has all this achieved
What changed Joe
Who won
(nods) Maybe you're right
Maybe  should have kept my mouth shut
Is that what your dad taught you Valerie
That what Colonel Sam Plame said

(cont'd) good American doesn't rock the boat
good American looks the other way
They are both terribly wounded
He looks at her, levelly
Did you send me to Niger
(Silence) "His business is struggling
He's on the slide
'll throw him a bone
" Was that it Val
You pull some strings for me
You help your old man out
How dare you
Did you send me
You think 'm lying to you
Could  tell if you were
Utter silence
You fucking bastard
She stops
is watching them
She has tears in her eyes
Valerie goes over and scoops her up
And Trevor
And carries them off
Joe is alone
: The Senate Intelligence Committee published information that showed Joe Wilson had lied about how he came to be sent to Niger
He denied that his wife had any role in it whatsoever, but a memo Plame wrote on February 12, 2002 proves otherwise
98
The Senate Intelligence Committee let some air  a lot of air - out of Joe Wilson's overly inflated ego when it issued its first report on prewar intelligence
While the committee heaped most of its criticism on the Central Intelligence Agency for getting almost everything wrong about Iraq and weapons of mass destruction it pointedly rebuked the former ambassador and his infamous mission to Niger
Morning
Joe, in a suit, comes out of his house
gaggle of reporter is waiting, they follow Joe as he crosses into the street towards his car
Shutters and flashbulbs firing
Mr Wilson, do you still maintain the Vice President's office sent you Niger and not your wife
2 Mr Wilson was Niger just a free holiday
boondoggle
My wife did not send me
didn't receive payment
It was not a holiday
It was a fact finding mission in the run up to a war
But the fact is no one wanted facts
Are you against our troops Mr Wilson
Mr
Wilson is it true you donated money to the Kerry campaign
People are saying your wife does not actually work for the
Is it true she was just a secretary at Langley
99
Joe turns round, furious, as if he's going to punch the reporter
He tenses his jaw
No comment
Joe gets into his car
The questions roaring around him
Valerie is alone
In bed
Watching
Rogers
The question still remains, who is Valerie Plame
Was she really simply a glorified typist
Well,  think it's really all about the money
We're talking about a third-rate  agent who had a government salary, and she had sent her husband to Niger, and he had come back and didn't give the report to the , but he turned it over in an op-ed to The New York Times
So she was already in the hot seat with the , and so now she's all about the money
Plus it's come out that she was considered kind of a mediocre agent at best
Joe puts a sheet on the couch
He looks around for something to use as a pillow
Joe comes into the bedroom to get his pillow
Valerie is lying in the bed, turned away
He pauses in the doorway
We see Valerie up close
She begins to speak
When we were at the "Farm", training to be field officers, they picked four or five of us and told us we'd stood out
---- Valerie, kneeling, blindfold, in stress position
: 100
We were bound, hooded and thrown in separate cells
They beat us
Deprived us of sleep
All you had to do was give up the name of one of the others
Just one name
For a glass of water
sandwich
To avoid another punch
--
Another hour in a stress position
--  bursts out from under the water
Gasps in a draft of air
They push you until they find it
Til they find the point at which you break
Because they have to know
You have to know
And one by one, everybody broke
Except me never broke
(she looks at him) 've been in situations, places where  was afraid
Where if you made a mistake, one tiny mistake, at any moment
(Pause) But  never made a mistake
And that made me feel special thought: 'm Different
Bullet- proof
You can't break me
don't have a breaking point
(Pause) was wrong
Joe comes over
He reaches out and touches Valerie
Immediately she gets up and walks out
Alone, he hears the bathroom door close
-- ,
Valerie packs the kids stuff up into suitcases
'
Joe sits at his desk, a book open
Not reading
101
Valerie puts the kid's coats on
The study door is open
She knows Joe is there but she doesn't look at him nor he at her
Say goodbye to your father
The kids go into --   -- Joe looks up
Hey guys
We're going on a mystery tour
Why aren't you coming daddy
It hits him in the gut
Come here
He scoops them up
Kisses him
Her
'll see you both real soon
In the hallway Valerie waits
guys

: On the driveway,  puts the kids in the car

The kids run to hug Grandma and Grandpa
Valerie's mom coralls the kids
' Who wants to make toffee apples
Me

Val looks downstairs
In the shop, her father, in an apron
102
Well don't just stand there
Come take a look

Tools in neat rows
Valerie's father, an old man in a plaid shirt holds a sander
Points to the table he's working on
It's cherry
thought it'd work in your dining room

Just sanding her down then she done
It's beautiful

keep telling you
They have a table
Valerie smiles at her Dad who looks at her properly
Well come here
They hug
Joe walks across the floor
He shakes hands with three or four businessmen
Good morning
They all introduce themselves
Joe orders breakfast
How's your wife Joe
She's fine
She's well
She uh
He uses the waitress to change the subject
Hi
'll just have a strong coffee
'm not very hungry

(cont'd) (to the other men) So
How long are you in town for
: Joe washing his hands in the bathroom
Tense
He looks tired
: Joe comes out of the bathroom and walks across the foyer and back to his table
woman is talking to his business associates
He sees who it is, instantly looks concerned
Can  help you
Excuse me
Can help you
'm just telling these people that you sir are a fraud
This is a private lunch
Please leave us alone
This man is a liar and a traitor
He is in the pay of left wing hate groups, he is a democrat stooge, and he is an anti-war zealot
He has stabbed our troops the back
Joe is trying to laugh it off
But everyone is watching
Leave now
2 May we get the check
You have blood on your hands
You are a fraud and your wife is a traitor and a fantasist
Leave my fucking table
Now
How   dare you talk about my wife
You   don't know her
You don't know me
Now leave my table
Now
The table nearby are watching
(To the next table) Ladies and gentleman
Joe Wilson
() 104
(cont'd) He likes to lie in the press and he likes to swear and insult women
think we should leave
No
Please
2 No really we should
We'll call
Shame on you
You call yourself a reporter
Shame on you
(to himself as she leaves) You're a self publicising hack
Fuck you
Fuck you
Joe storms away Into the street -- He doesn't know what just happened
He hails a
It tears past
He hails another
It stops
(Shaken) Pallisades
The driver drives
Joe tries to calm down, but in the back of this cab, it all hits him and he starts to lose it
He looks sick
His head is exploding
The tension like a vice
He opens the window
He gets himself under control, but he's white and shaking
The cab driver looks in the rear-view
You
'm fine
You're him
see you on the
You're Joe Wilson
No, 'm not
Yes brother
see you on the
105
That's somebody else
No no
know you
My name is Joe too
am from Sierra Leone
Freetown
You've been there, right
You like Freetown
Joe looks out of the window
Joe, we both know Freetown's a shit- hole
The taxi driver cracks up
That's the truth
That's the truth right there, brother
Yes indeed
Sierra Leone is dying
The people at the top have too much power too much power
Over there we have no truth
Just power
People can't see that from here
Over here it's a different world
Joe stares out the window
wouldn't be so sure of that
How can you say that
Land of the Free, brother
Home of the Brave
Joe looks sick
Can we pull over
'm going to walk
Look keep the change
Do you pray, Joe Wilson
No
give you this
It is my church maybe you come
And if you open a bible, look John Chapter eight
() 106
(cont'd) Then Jesus said if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed
And you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free
(he smiles) Take care brother Joe
and drives off
Joe looks up
He is standing right outside the Capitol
Valerie's father is teaching the kids how to lassoo a pole
They both want to go first
He tries to keep the peace
-- Valerie and her mother watch
How's is he
Oh you know
Getting better
Shakin' through
-- Val's Dad lassoos the pole
Kids cheer
: Sunset
Midges swirl in dizzy soups
Out in the field, Samantha is trying to lassoo the pole
Valerie comes out and joins her father on the porch
He suddenly points
See those birds
Those guys
Those yellow fellas
See `em
Yeah  see `em
Listen
(They both listen) You hear that
Ain't that beautiful
They suddenly showed up last year
They're called
(Stops) What are they called
know their name
They're called something
(He wracks his brain) Anyway
They were here last year
And the year before
God they're beautiful
Look at that
107
They watch the birds
Dad,  think my marriage is over
The sun setting
Samantha playing below
He nods slowly
Well
know my little girl doesn't say anything til she absolutely has to
Tears come to her eyes
'm the same way
And 've said that too
Those exact same words
July 1972
Your mother and  were fighting all the time
guess she was just plain tired of moving home
Wasn't `til  retired after 42 years in the Air Force, realised we never had a home
Germany, Singapore, Australia, England
Heck  can remember the day you were born in a freezing cold airbase outside Anchorage Alaska
You must have been to twenty schools
Twenty different chances to introduce yourself
Be someone new
But you turned out
Responsible
little too serious
Always looking down the road
Worrying where life was going to drag you next
But it made you tough
Real tough
Maybe tougher than , or your mother, or anyone knows
He wants me to go on the record
Speak out
Like that would suddenly make this all go away
We can't even speak to each other
(She shakes her head) can't see how this comes round just can't see it, pop
Not anymore
He looks at her
With a serious intent
He speak low
What they did was wrong Valerie
Plain wrong
Never forget that
108
Valerie look at the floor as her father's words sink in
Say through some miracle you even get through this
you and Joe are always gonna fight
You're fighters
He's a stubborn son of a bitch too
He don't give up easy either
dark cloud comes over him
He speaks levelly
One day this country is gonna look back on these years, and it's gonna hang its head
It's gonna weep
Then it's gonna stand up straight and walk on
He watches Samantha in the half-light, still trying to lassoo the pole
swear to God, she's gonna keep at that until she licks it
Valerie smiles
He points to Samantha
They're tougher than we are
They'll piss you off from time to time, but they're built to last
Joe sits surrounded by the statues of Presidents and law- makers
janitor approaches
Mister
(No reaction) We're closing
You have to leave

The
military death toll in Iraq exceeded 2,000 this week, and the president's approval ratings are at the lowest point since he took office in 2001
At a news conference, special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald declined to comment about Rove's involvement
Asked about Cheney, he said: "'m not making allegations about anyone not charged in the indictment
" Friday's charges stemmed from a two- year investigation by Fitzgerald into whether Rove, Libby or any other administration officials knowingly revealed the identity of officer Valerie Plame

In a statement released Friday afternoon, Libby said, " have conducted my responsibilities honorably and truthfully
am confident that at the end of this process  will be completely and totally exonerated

He stiffens
Tries to cover his shock
Becomes almost formal- They served up Libby
He's taking the fall
He fixes on the screen
bet they've already struck the deal
He takes the fall
He gets pardoned
The deck's stacked
bet this doesn't even get to a trial
Thank you
He looks at her and sways slightly
don't care how angry you get don't care what they say about us
don't care if you hate me
If they take everything away from us, but they are not going to take this
They do not get to take my marriage
Joe's eyes fill with tears
'm so sorry
Tears fill her eyes
You did good
He looks her in the eye
Shakes his head
did it for me
She shakes her head

know why you did it
(She looks at him) Thank you
There's a thousand things he could suddenly say
And suddenly nothing, as he fights tears
If  could give it back to you
If could give you back who you were- This is who  am
Right here
They clasp each other and hug, and all the pain drains away
They kiss
As they break she looks into her husband's eyes
So are you ready to fight

Never more important when the nation is on the brink of war

Packed to the rafters

It worked
Its still working
Because we still don't know the truth
But you all know my wife's name

/ Public officials swear an oath to uphold the constitution
That is their duty
They must be kept to their oath
That is yours
This offense wasn't committed against me
Nor against my wife
It was committed against you
And if you ever feel angry

Ashamed even
(
) Do something about it
In 1787 as Benjamin Franklin left the Constitution Hall after the last drafting session, he was stopped by a woman on the street
