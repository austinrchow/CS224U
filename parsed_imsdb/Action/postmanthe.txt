We hear ,
lone wanderer appears
Wearing a long coat and a battered hat, he carries a bolt-action carbine
His name forgotten, history remembers him simply as
His laden pack mule, , , as they pass a battered sign: "The Great Salt Lake Marina
" They start down a slope and begin to cross a
bizarre, wind-swept sight
Dozens of boats resting lee- to on the dry, cracked earth
It's like God pulled the plug
Rusty mooring chains snake their way around house boats, ski boats and a cabin cruiser or two
(
) The last of the great cities died when my father was a child
Another victim of yet another war
The plagues followed
And the terrors
The living hid themselves away in tiny hamlets in hopes of surviving whatever new madness conspired to rob them of the little that remained
The Earth itself had fallen prey to chaos
For three years a dirty snow fell that even summer could not erase
The ocean was barren
Poisoned
Near death
As The Postman continues to cross, the
He's soon lost in the massive vista
(
) Sixteen long years passed before the great lungs started working again
My father said it was as if the ocean breathed a great sigh of relief
of
begins to fall
The earth just sucks it up at first, but it's coming hard
Rivulets run
Puddles form
We begin to get the feeling that soon these boats will be tugging at the mooring chains once again

And then, running to fill another in a series of depressions
They make a pattern we recognize as -- ' These tracks may already be days old as they fill with rain water
Then, the sound of light, padded
Lean, hungry and dangerous, the big cat has been tracking this man
He lets out a low, disappointed
The rain has foiled his dinner plans -- for now

84 North
" The Postman leads Bill down a barren 4-lane
Weeds poke up through the asphalt
The rusting hulk of a car rests in the median, covered in a tangle of purple wisteria
The Postman plucks a flower
He sticks it into a buttonhole and continues
woefully
In answer: don't know
And if you ask me again, 'm going to slug you
They near a sign: "Thank You For Visiting Utah
" The Postman waves, shouts to the sign as he passes it
It's been fun, hasn't it, kids
(to the sign) You're welcome

Above, The Postman sands atop a billboard catwalk
He references a tattered road atlas, scans the horizon through binoculars with one broken lens
He pauses at a Union 76 ball just visible above the tree line

() -                         4 76 Station and the remains of a Howard Johnson's
Alert, carbine in hand, The Postman leads in the mule
Rusting cars sag on flattened tires
There's a stripped fire engine, its cracked hoses leading to the HoJo foundation which bristles with burned timbers
Bill stops to drink out of a stream
The Postman swats at him with his hat
Damnit, Bill, you know  need to check it first
Bill hangs his head
The Postman digs through his pack
He removes an old Tupperware container and replaces its contents -- a tiny sheaf of litmus papers and several small bottles -- with stream water
He adds a few drops from each bottle
Swirls it around
Then dips a tiny strip of paper into the water
The paper turns a vivid purple
The Postman is dubious
Better than turpentine
(touches some to his lips) Tastes about the same
Your call, Bill
Bill drinks
You ain't picky, Bill
like that about you
The Postman takes his carbine and a burlap sack and crosses to the 76 Station
An old extension ladder on the ground
The pole holding up the 76 ball has a 30-degree bend in it, like someone once tried to pull it over
Beyond the 76 ball, the sun sets -- but we here in the 20th Century have never seen such a wild riot of color before
The Postman tries the station door
Locked
Smiling ironically, he steps in through the blown-out window

76  -  -                                 5 shambles
The Postman kicks around the table
He finds a few beat-up CDs, flips through them
Reads the label

Tell me about it
Tossing it, he turns, stops
There, resting on a pile of trash is a bashed-in portable
The Postman smiles
Hey, Bill
We got
147 channels
Everything from Jesus to 'Jeopardy'
He steps over, switches on the set
Nothing happens, but The Postman pretends just the same
He mimics static, then: 'Like sands through the hour- glass, so are the days of our lives
' (switching channels) 'Michael Shields, come on down, you're the next contestant on
'The Price is Right'
' (switching again) 'll take Domestic Nuclear Disasters for two hundred thousand, Alex
The Postman stops suddenly
Click
We interrupt our regularly scheduled program to bring you the Second Civil War
Well, shit
The Postman stares at the blank screen a moment
There's a sudden, panicked  from behind the service manager's desk
The Postman wheels around, raises the carbine
don't want any trouble
bet you don't either
Let's just call it a draw, okay
Sudden
The Postman shouts in surprise as a Doe dashes out from behind the desk
Scared, it bounds back and forth between the walls
Then freezes in the corner
The Postman sighs in relief, lowers the carbine
Look out, Bill

Bill has a conniption fit
Investigating further, The Postman spots a cigarette machine
The front glass is smashed and all the slots are empty
But he looks down to the lock at the bottom
It's intact
He pulls a crowbar from the sack, crouches by the machine and digs the pry into a seam and pulls
The panel bursts open to reveal four half-open cartons of cigarettes
He doesn't believe it for a second
Then: 'm rich

76  -                                          6 Embers of a campfire glow
The Postman is asleep, the carbine in reach
and nervously stamps his hooves
The Postman reaches for the carbine only to find the barrel of a shotgun pointed in his face
Three
Hard-eyed and ugly
One, barely 20, is mostly just ugly
The Postman looks down the barrels of a shotgun, a rifle and a revolver
The   kicks the carbine out of reach
'm just passing through
don't mean anyone any harm
(re: stream) Water's good
The Lead Bandit pokes at The Postman's shoulder with the muzzle of his rifle
The Postman knows why
'm not a Holnist
The Lead Bandit pokes again
Harder
The Postman opens his shirt, reveals his bare left shoulder
Okay
They just stare at him, none saying a word
Creepy
'm headed for a town called St
Rose
Somewhere west of Portland

Well,  heard different
You mouthin' me
No, it's just that it's hard to get good information
The third , a  brute, has been quiet
He is mouthin' you;  say we kill him
Don't be in such a rush, Martin
(back to The Postman) Now  see a pack mule over there, but  don't see no packs
This is all  got
Oh
Kill him, Martin
The Hulking Bandit, raises his shotgun
The butt end
He's going to bludgeon The Postman to death
(pointing) Okay
My stuff's up there
The 76 ball is twenty feet above the ground
In the gloom you can just see a hole has been punched through the side
#20 What do you got in there
The Lead Bandit swats Bandit #20 upside the head
Shut up
(to Postman) What do you got in there

Beef jerky
Cigarettes
Cigarettes
Sure
There's the ladder
#20 Maybe he's got it booby-trapped
The Lead Bandit is about to smack Bandit #20 again -- then he sees the logic out of it
The Postman shakes his head, but isn't that convincing
You go up and get it

76  -                                              7 The ladder set against the bent pole
Prodded by a shotgun, The Postman climbs, disappears through the hole and into the tilting 76 ball

76  -                                              8 Full of The Postman's earthly possessions
Trick is, how to save them and his life at the same time
He spies an old wrench: remnant of an attempt to remove the rusty bolts holding the ball in place
An idea begins to take shape
(
) Just you start tossing those cigarettes down
There's no answer
The Bandits eye each other nervously
#20 Maybe he fell asleep

As it starts to give
It's going to take a second got my stuff bolted in
The Lead Bandit takes a cautious step back
Put some buckshot through it, Martin
Just to hurry him up
only got three shells left
So use his gun
The Hulking Bandit picks up the carbine and aims
It isn't loaded
The Hulking Bandit tosses the gun aside, pulls a knife from his boot
Grimly, he begins to climb
76 Cramped, The Postman's busy at the base of the ball, trying to unscrew the last remaining bolt
It won't budge
The Hulking Bandit has only a few more rungs to go
76 No good
Time's up
The Postman starts rocking the pole
The Hulking Bandit has reached the opening -- feels the rocking motion
Hangs on

8   :    (2)                                            8 76 Knife in hand, the Hulking Bandit looks inside
At that instant, The Postman rocks the pole one more time
The rusty bolt is not enough to keep the ball's full weight in place
It pops
The ball is frozen for an instant before going with the pole's tilt
The 76 ball drops off the pole, rolling over the Hulking Bandit's back and down the ladder's incline
The other Bandits dive clear as the 76 ball hurtles past
whips head over heels as the ball speeds away
The 76 ball launches off a dirt berm, but soon comes to a stop as it slams into an old utility pole and bursts apart
Fighting the vertigo, The Postman staggers to his feet
Bill
Bill bolts from the station as the Lead Bandit raises the and  at The Postman
Losing balance, The Postman lands on his butt just before a bullet splinters the utility pole above his head
Wobbly, he tries to gather his packs
The Bandits charge, quickly closing the ground, but Bill is there first
Holding as much as he can, The Postman heaves himself over Bill's back
As the mule gallops away, the Lead Bandit aims the rifle
He's got The Postman in his sights
He's about to fire when -- Bandit #20 stands up  the He's got a fistful of cigarettes in each hand and he's laughing like a hyena
#20 We're rich

() -                              9 The Postman sits on a rock, holding Bill's halter so the mule must face him
They are in the midst of an argument
It's true, we haven't done this in a while, but it's like riding a bicycle
Now, open your mouth
The Postman pries his mouth open
Taking a toothbrush, he tends to Bill's teeth, then gives him an appraising look
know the rule
It's my rule
Avoid civilization at all costs
But we gotta eat, don't we
(as   again) What are you so worried about, Bill
All you gotta do is stand there
'm the one with all the lines
The Postman leads the mule down the hill toward the town far below
Making his case all the while -- even as in protest

() -                             10 patch of mud
In the center of the square fifty townspeople stand before a plank stage where The Postman wraps up a performance of MacBeth
He plays it with a mis-remembered gusto the people enjoy
Children especially are enamored
heavily-muscled man, , lingers on the fringe of the crowd -- watching The Postman with inscrutable intensity
They said, 'Fear not, MacBeth, 'til Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane'
He looks off stage for someone, but no one appears
said, Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane
Bill trots on-stage
Covered with twigs,  is Birnam Wood
He  lustily
The audience laughs in delight
The children clap
Only Woody seems unaffected

10   :                                                     10 The Postman grabs two wooden swords -- he knows it's going well
Arm, arm yourselves
If the witch's words are true, there'll be no running or hiding here
Shaking off the twigs, Bill takes one of the swords in his mouth
The two of them dash back and forth pretending to fight off an imaginary attack
Finally, The Postman looks out at the audience, remembers the words the best he can
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and the day after that
Out brief candle
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts his hour upon the stage and is heard no more
It's a tale told by a moron
Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing
(waves sword) But blow, wind
Come wrack
At least we'll die with the harness off our back
The audience erupts in applause
But Woody stands still as stone
The Postman takes a bow
Even Bill does a cross-legged dip
Knowing when to quit, he steps off the stage to many hearty handshakes
Woody watches his every move
, one of the town's leaders, steps up
She's accompanied by crotchety old
The children have never heard Shakespeare before
(grinning) They still haven't
The Curmudgeon is still clapping
Thanks
You're very nice
'm clapping because you stink

When  was young,  tried to be an actor

But now won't die thinking  was the worst one

Good enough to get something to eat

Holnists are coming

Mrs
Thompson sees The Postman's concern
It's okay
We give them food and supplies
All the towns do
#1 They hardly kill anyone lately
Just take a woman sometimes
Well, 'd just as soon not give them anything of mine
Let's find the back door, Bill
The Postman gathers his stuff, slings packs onto Bill
The forty Holnists in orange and black uniforms ride in
They're armed with mostly pistols and rifles
Some carry bows, knives, spear guns and swords
On their bare shoulders, branded into the flesh -- the number "8

Commander of the United Clans of Holn
Nothing escapes his eye
little behind him is the mysteriously silent Colonel Getty, second in command
The Postman, finished packing, begins to move from building to building -- careful not to attract any attention
(
) What are you doing there
The Postman freezes, turns, is relieved to find Bethlehem's not talking to him at all
The General looks down from his horse at children playing an impromptu game of "Birnam Wood
" The children stop, stare at their feet
Bethlehem affects a "kindly" smile to accompany his gentler tone
said, what are you doing
Meantime, The Postman continues his surreptitious escape
The  hurries forward to greet Bethlehem
It's just a game, General Bethlehem
Something they saw in a play
No harm in it
play
(to kids) Show me
It's all right, children, show me
One   finds his voice, barely
Arm, arm yourselves
No running from the witches

Well, 'm sorry  missed it

Really
But you had time for a play
Head down, The Postman makes for "the back way
" But it's guarded by three daunting Holnist soldiers
No getting by them
The Postman does a quick 180, goes back the way he came
Bethlehem looks at the frightened townsfolk
'm taking three conscripts from each town
They will have the honor of serving in the Holnist Army until such time as  see fit
(to Mayor) Three men
You suppose you could do that
The Mayor nods in acquiescence
Bethlehem looks to a Holnist officer
The officer, , steps up and addresses the town
All men between 15 and 50 and of suitable ethnic foundation are required to show themselves now
The Holnist soldiers fan out, prodding any likely or unwilling candidates forward
The Postman is now walking behind Bethlehem
Some of the Townspeople cast him a furtive glance as he makes his way toward the open courtyard and, ultimately, the gate out of town
Three conscripts are hustled before Bethlehem
He looks over the first -- Woody
Smells him
Not much of a decision here
Acceptable
Sir
Acceptable, Captain

Bethlehem feels his arm, turns his head from side to side
You'll need to put some meat on, but  like an impressionable mind
Acceptable
The third -- an innocuous man
Or so we think
Bethlehem stares hard at his olive skin, traces a finger over the bump on the man's nose
Mongoloid
Unacceptable
Soldiers shove the man back into the crowd
The Brave Boy that was playing Birnam Wood allows himself a tiny smile when he sees that The Postman might make it
want pure blood
Someone like
Bethlehem notes the Boy, turns to see the object of his attention, and spots The Postman leaving out the front gate
That man
Idaho and another soldier are on it
The Postman tries to back away as the two dismount and come toward him
You don't understand
But Idaho and the soldier aren't programmed for explanations -- they grab him
You were required to show yourself
But, 'm not with these people
'm just passing through
-- Idaho silences him with a rifle butt to the head
Everything falls (

five hundred-man army enjoying all the comforts a bivouac can offer
19 head-shaved , including Woody and The Postman, are held in a cramped, barbed wired pen
They watch as three more are shoved inside
One of them is Bandit #20
He and The Postman come face to face, recognize each other

(astonished) Hi
The Postman steps toward him, Bandit #20 backs off quickly
#20 Well
mean, we know each other, kind of
Kind of

Wonderful
What happened to your partners

You have been born again as soldiers in the army of the United Clans of Holn
The strong have been sapped by the whimpering propaganda of the weak
Men, strong men, have been denied their destiny
You men have been saved from that fate
Redemption is within your grasp
He starts down the line, looking the men over
He stops in front of a
The Postman is alongside
You
What did you do before you were given this opportunity
had a shovel
digged holes
Bethlehem regards him benevolently
You digged holes
Well, now you're going to fill them
(turns to Postman) And you
Me
Is there any question in anyone's mind that  was talking to you
Yes, you
You look like a dangerous man
Are you

He looks at The Postman expectantly
Finally
, um, you want a line
Bethlehem nods
The Postman thinks a moment
'To be or not to be: That is the question
' Bethlehem looks at his men as if to say, "Is this all this guy's got
" Bethlehem eyes The Postman; he wants a contest
'We few, we happy few, we band of brothers
' The Holnists clap, they know their General can best this guy
(gaining confidence) 'Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of York
' Bethlehem claps The Postman on the back
You're pretty good
You're also a fighter
see it in your eyes
The Postman doesn't answer
Hesitant, he doesn't want to get into any more trouble than he's already in
Don't you agree
Come on, a man's got to speak his mind
Bethlehem sounds sincere
He seems like a good guy
don't mean any disrespect, sir, but you'd be better off just letting me go
fighter is about the last thing  am

Bethlehem clubs him in the head, dropping him to his knees, then digs a boot into his side
The Postman goes down
Don't you think  should be the judge of that, soldier
The Postman gasps to catch his breath
Get up
said, get up
The Postman staggers to his feet
Blood trickles from his nose as he stares across at Bethlehem
Put up your fists
You'd win
Bethlehem looks to Getty
Getty shoves a is into The Postman's ear
The Postman reluctantly raises his fists
Bethlehem gives him a satisfied nod
Now fight
The Postman takes a tentative step forward
Bethlehem drives him back with a flurry of blows
The Postman is dazed, nearly out on his feet
Bethlehem holds him up
You're right
You're not a fighter
But you will be
'm giving you a chance at a life that means something
life worth living
That said, Bethlehem delivers one last blow to The Postman's face
Everything goes

He licks his dry, blood-caked lips
sudden movement startles him -- it's Woody, shoving him a battered cup of water
It's like he's been keeping watch
The Postman is surprised, a little suspicious, and very grateful as he gulps the water down
Thanks
Did  win
Woody shakes his head "no
" tried to tell him
Say it again
Say what
The words you said in town
About the wind blowing
And the rest
Say it again
'Blow, wind
Come wrack
At least we'll die with the harness off our back

Live free or die

The line has almost passed
Just The Postman left and Bandit #20 bringing up the rear
Idaho looks at The Postman, addresses the
Why don't you tell Shakespeare what kind of meat that is
Mule
Probably Bill -- and The Postman knows it
He stares in revulsion at the putrid meat ladled into his pail
godawful animal
The sterile offspring of a horse and a donkey
Can you imagine that
There's no room in this new world for a bastard like that
Bandit #20 holds out his pail
But the cook won't fill it
Uh uh
(loudly; for all) Any man last in line ain't hungry enough
You show up last, you don't eat
Bandit #20 steps away in disbelief
Not knowing what else to do, he sits down beside The Postman, the only man with food who isn't eating
#20 'll die before 'm last in line again
That's what they're hoping for
He holds his pail out to Bandit #20
#20 Serious
This isn't bad
Lost in despair, The Postman stares out at the skewed palette
These were supposed to be the best years of my life

-                                   14 The conscripts stand at attention under the guard of Idaho and two other soldiers
To their right is a dead oak tree
Behind them, three rows of folding chairs
Two figures approach
Bethlehem and Getty
Getty carries a sheathed sword
Bethlehem surveys the troops -- taking no more notice of The Postman than anyone else
The laws of eight, gentlemen
That is the legacy handed down to us by Nathan Holn
At the mention of this name, the  shout as one
God rest his soul
(low) May he burn in hell
Getty looks over at him
He heard him
The Postman swallows hard
Getty stares hard
Then he turns away
He's not going to bust him on it
These are the laws that we live by
The eight is our symbol
Each man will bear it with pride
Bethlehem nods at Idaho who pushes up his own sleeve to reveal the branded 8
Only then will you be part of the clan
Sit down, gentlemen
The men move to sit in one of the three rows
Only then does it become apparent that there are 18 men and only 17 chairs

You will obey orders without question

You could've sat down on the ground
The Slow Recruit moves to do so
You disobeyed a direct order
You broke Law One
Idaho and another soldier step up beside the Slow Recruit
Law Two
Punishment shall be swift
They hustle the Recruit to the tree
Idaho unslings a coil of rope, throws it over a tree limb
They quickly slip a loop over the Slow Recruit's ankles and haul him upside down into the air
Law Three: Mercy is for the weak
Four: Terror will defeat reason
Five: Your allegiance is to the clan
Six: Justice can be dictated
Law Seven
Any clansman may challenge for leadership of the clan
Does any man here wish to challenge me
There are no takers
On your feet
The conscripts stand like jackknives snapping open
Without a word, without a look -- Bethlehem reaches out and draws a sword from a sheath that Getty holds
Bethlehem steps to the Slow Recruit -- who slowly twists around
Law Eight: There is only one penalty: Death
Bethlehem raises the sword
Please, 'm begging you

Bethlehem looks at him, but addresses all
You will get out of this army what you put into it
Work and you'll be fed
Fight and you'll be respected
Die and you'll be remembered
It's up to you
Bethlehem turns and walks away
Getty following behind
The Postman watches as they go
Idaho steps up to him
You thinking of challenging for leadership of the clan
No, sir
'm a follower not a leader
You see Colonel Getty
Always following the General
He's the only man who ever challenged
Fight lasted six seconds, but the General didn't kill him
He cut off his tongue and he cut off his balls and old Getty's been following him like a dog ever since
The Postman looks back to see Bethlehem and Getty disappear into the gloom
Idaho grins, likes how this affects a new man
The Postman moves on
Idaho stops Woody as he passes
The General don't see it, but say you got some nigger in you
Woody clenches his jaw, but wisely doesn't answer

Boots suck at the mud
War wagons heave out of ruts
monster gun is mounted on an old John Deere semi, pulled by a team of ten horses
The conscripts fill the middle ranks, each bearing a heavy pack

The cry to halt
The conscripts unsling their packs, catch their breath
Idaho pulls The Postman out of line
The General would like a word with you, Shakespeare

'  -                              16 Bethlehem stands before a painter's easel, palette in hand
He's got a mirror set up so he can see his reflection
He's doing a self-portrait in the tradition of the great Dutch Masters -- but it's a dismal failure
He continues painting even as Idaho leads The Postman in
Idaho salutes, steps back
For a moment, The Postman doesn't quite know what to do
(re: the book and binoculars on the table) They're yours
solitary man, aren't you
Binoculars
To watch life from a distance
And Shakespeare
To read about it instead of living it
Bethlehem wants an answer
The Postman clears his throat
No offense, General, but you seem to have read some Shakespeare yourself
If he wishes to rise above mere thuggery, a military commandeer must be classically educated
Philosophy, history
Even a sense of the dramatic
(a beat) Do you know what  did before the war
Do you think  was in the army
sold copying machines was a salesman
The talent to lead men and devise and execute a battle plan were locked away inside me

20- year-old self-help book
If Nathan Holn hadn't come along, 'd still be selling copying machines
Can you imagine the wasted life
Can you imagine the magnitude of it
But war
War gives men like me a chance
He turns to a dog-eared page in the book
Here
'The prize is often left unclaimed
Have the courage to grasp it
For fortune always favors the bold

'll need able officers to carry it out
You have the intelligence
If your heart matches, you'll go far

Dismissed
The Postman leaves
Idaho stands at the ready
Issue the binoculars to a scout
And the book, sir
Burn it
Idaho leaves
Bethlehem goes back to his painting
He considers himself in the mirror
After a long stare-down, he shouts: Quit moving

Troubled, The Postman doesn't answer
He heads for a corner where Woody stands alone
Relentless, Bandit #20 follows
#20 What did he say
Nothing
#20 Did he say anything about me
No
They reach the quiet corner; it's just the three of them
We got to get out of here
#20 What are you talking about
Escaping

Rose
It's on the coast
They say it's a paradise
They've even got electric lights
Bandit #20 looks scared, Woody unreadable
#20 We can't
Between the three of us, we could -- #20 No, no
can't
like it here
like being a part of something
The Postman can't believe what Bandit #20 just said
Bandit #20 turns, hurries away
The Postman looks to Woody who doesn't tip his hand either way
He moves away as well

-                                                   18 The conscripts break camp
Hot work
Glistening with sweat, The Postman stops to stretch
Across the way, he sees Bandit #20 talking to Getty
Getty glances at The Postman who returns to work, watches under his eyebrows as Idaho joins the group
There's trouble brewing here
Worried, The Postman looks to Woody, who watches the exchange as well
He is, as usual, inscrutable

-  -                                       19 The river is swollen and swift from the spring thaw
Marching along the east ridge above it, the army is given the order to halt
The Postman looks ahead to where Idaho confers with Bethlehem
Something's wrong
They look to where: Two carbine-toting soldiers stand alertly at guard by a thicket across the river
rotten wood and rope bridge spans the space between the ridges
Idaho rides to the conscripts: One of you dogs has earned himself a treat
Over there
Idaho points to the thicket as he proceeds down the line
Those men hunted themselves a lion this morning
Must've been a zoo around here before the war
Anyhow, they shot him and he crawled into that thicket third man went in after him
We don't know if he's dead or alive
need a volunteer
Someone's gotta go in and get our boy out
No volunteers, except the zealot Bandit #20
#20 'll go
Idaho ignores him, stops in front of Woody
guess size ain't a measure of courage, is it
Shakespeare
The fix is in
The Postman steps out of line

) don't think so, Captain
Bethlehem nods to Getty
Getty takes a hunting knife from a belt-sheath and tosses it, blade first, into the ground between The Postman's feet
Come out alive and you got yourself a lion steak
Hefting the knife, The Postman stares at the west ridge
(winks) Maybe you'll find your St
Rose up there
The Postman looks to Bandit #20 who stares back defiantly
What are you waiting for, Christmas
Bandit #20 can't contain his giggling, so Idaho backhands the sound out of him -- then looks back to The Postman
Grim The Postman starts forward, looks from the rotten bridge to the water and back again as he moves
All eyes on him as he starts across

They point him ahead, prod him forward toward a trail of wet blood which leads deeper into the thicket
Stooping, The Postman enters
The soldiers split off and track along with him on either side of the thicket

-                                               22 Thorns catch and tear at his clothes as The Postman pushes his way through
He freezes
Ahead, sprawled and twisted, the mauled, bloody corpse of a Holnist soldier
(
) Why are you stopping

(
) He alive
Clearly he is not
Yeah
(
) Bring him out
The Postman heaves the corpse onto his back
Rising, steadying himself, he looks back over his shoulders at a He hurries forward
Everyone stares across the river, straining to see as The Postman emerges with the corpse on his back
The Postman starts across, hampered by his burden
He pauses, at his feet, the cracked, knotty plank

You still got a lion to bag
The Postman decides, deliberately steps on the
The Postman and the corpse drop thirty feet down, disappear in the river below
The corpse surfaces first, floats in the water
Then The Postman
Farther down the river
Swimming downstream with powerful strokes
Between his efforts and the current, he's being quickly swept away from the Holnists
As Bethlehem's eyes narrow in fury

Bethlehem signals to two soldiers
They start running along the east ridge toward the riverbend
Two more start across the bridge to the west -- moving with military precision
Bethlehem wheels toward the conscripts, points out Woody
In the water
Come back without him and you and another man will die in his place
Woody dives in the water
Bethlehem looks to Idaho who dives in as well
Conscripts buzz with nervous excitement
Go
Go
#20 (caught up) 'll get him, sir
He takes off running across the bridge

As The Postman is swept beneath, he reaches up and catches hold
Pulling himself out of the water, he scrambles for the west shore
He disappears into the woods as two soldiers appear
They catch hold of the tree, look to the west banking, see footprints in the mud where The Postman pulled himself out
They start after him

-  -                                     24 Clothes in tatters, his lungs ready to burst, The Postman stops
He takes cover as the two soldiers run past
Breathing hard, The Postman steps out, starts across the clearing
He's halfway when Bandit #20 steps out from the trees
They look at each other for a moment
Just let me go
don't want to be part of your army

#20 My army
like the sound of that
The Postman gestures with his knife
Don't -- #20 got him
Over -- The Postman lunges, digs into Bandit #20's gut
He blinks in surprise, then sags to the ground
The Postman takes a step back
shadow falls over him
It's Woody
Staring down at The Postman
They can hear others approaching from the river
They sent me to kill you
Come with me
At that moment, Idaho and the second soldier come into the clearing
Idaho grins, relaxes his grip on his gun when he sees the mismatch between Woody and The Postman
Good, boy
Get him
It's you or me
know
Finish it
Woody circles The Postman, until he's facing Idaho and the soldier
Woody takes a long look at The Postman, smiles
No harness on my back
As The Postman realizes what he's doing, Woody flips his knife through the air and into the soldier's throat

Covered with undergrowth and dotted with saplings, nothing's been down here in years

He's made his escape, but he won't last the night if he doesn't find some shelter
An unnatural shape ahead, just off the road
Square
He cautiously pulls back a few branches
An old, rusted Jeep with faded
government markings
Its hood buried under the dirt    of an old mud slide
The Postman stoops to look through    the passenger side window, comes face-to-face with death
skeleton sits inside, the skull grinning against the    glass facing The Postman
But The Postman doesn't jump back
He just stares
The two heads meet halfway as The Postman's face is reflected on the glass, superimposed over the skull
hypothermic shiver wracks his body
The Postman tries the door, but it won't budge
The other side of the Jeep is buried
But seeing that the windshield is partly smashed, he clears away the debris, peels back the spider- webbed safety glass and climbs inside
Pulling the glass back down, he looks almost shyly at the skeleton, like two kids about to "park" for the first time
Hey
How ya doin'
The back of the Jeep is filled with bags marked
Mail
The Postman picks up a hat off the console
Oddly respectful, he runs a finger along the band over the "Horse & Rider" emblem
The Postman reaches, touches the embroidered American flag patch on the skeleton's jacket shoulder
Another shiver
moment later, The Postman is pulling the nice dry jacket off the skeleton and shoving his own arms inside
sloshing sound
He pats down the jacket
Finds a liquor
He gives the skeleton a "you shouldn't have" look
But the cap won't budge
He twists, pries, bangs the neck of the steering wheel
At last it gives
He takes a long, hard swallow
The warming fire streams down his throat
The Postman grabs a random letter, reads it aloud

So, arrest me

Jerry's decided to go to school to get his contractor's license
Tossing it aside, he takes a drink, opens another
The words are in crayon -- a child's scrawl

The Postman turns the envelope over in his palm
tiny tooth falls out
The Postman considers it
This suddenly isn't so amusing
He puts it back in the envelope
Shoving mail sacks aside, he climbs in the back
Burrowing in, he pulls the sacks back, covering himself with a blanket of mail
Getting warmer already, he regards the skeleton a beat as the    the

He takes off the hat, holds it over his chest for a heartfelt moment of silence
Thanks for being there for me
(raising the flask) Here's to you
consider my taxes very well spent
He swallows the last few drops, then sets the flask down as a headstone
What now
All dressed up
Nowhere to go

He considers his two options: "Pine View -- 32 miles
" Or "Ridgemont -- 220 miles

Well, that's easy

'Dear Irene

The townspeople welcome him with cheers
The Postman raises a silencing hand
As they quiet
Yes, there is
If there are dogs in this town, you have to leash them while 'm here
Only The Postman laughs
No one else reacts
Briscoe watches dubiously from the wall as the people surround The Postman and sweep him through the gates and into town
One couple watches The Postman closely as he makes his way into town

Yeah, 'm supposed to take you to Foster's

The Postman just nods, hoisting himself out of the tub and hurriedly wrapping a towel around himself
Used to be John Stevens, but changed it on account of  want to drive cars
Hoping to impress, Ford reaches into a pocket, pulls out a worn, creased flyer for a "Ford Lincoln Mercury" dealership
Ford finds The Postman just staring at him, waiting for the uniform he's still got in his hand
Embarrassed, Ford quickly hands it over

But then he sees that a banquet has been laid out on the counter
The centerpiece is a huge vat of steaming stew
The  clear a path for him

#3 He a Democrat or a Republican
Parties are over with
The individual is what counts
You vote for the best man
Ellen sets a steaming bowl of stew in front of The Postman
Famished, he digs in
#4 What about Europe
Any word
The Postman tries to speak through a mouthful of food
Lady Di's in charge
Sixty years old and she still kicks ass
#3 Is Nathan Holn still alive
(smiles at irony) He died
Skin cancer
That's sure good news to everyone
But
#4 And the Holnists
They're still out there
What's the government going to do about them
The Postman looks at the desperate faces -- he'd rather get back to his meal -- but this may be the most important question of all
He doesn't want to lie
The government's just getting started
You're on your own for at least eighteen months

clamor of Holnist questions
Be quiet, everyone
Can't we just let this man eat
The people nod and The Postman finally gets to eat
He catches sight of Briscoe watching him from the door
After a moment, Briscoe leaves

There's dancing
The Postman sits behind four empty bowls
People watch him eat like it was a religious experience
He pushes back the fifth bowl
Never thought 'd hear myself say this, but  can't eat anymore
He's cut off by the sight of a silent, little boy
The kid's looking up, staring intently at something
What
The boy just stares
(re:   the cap) This
The boy nods
The Postman shakes his head and smiles to himself
He takes off the cap, sets it on the kid's head
Almost fits
The boy's eyes go wide with wonder
His stock's gone up 1000%
Before he can rush off to impress his friends, -- his mother -- steps over and gently chides him
That's not a toy, honey
That's very important
Give it back

Ellen smiles gratefully and gently guides her son away
The Postman shrugs, turns to find Abby, the pretty woman we saw at the Pine View gates
She smiles at The Postman
Would you like to dance
don't know if  can,  think 'm still on duty
He laughs
Abby says nothing
It's been a long time
Abby holds out her hand like a promise
All you got to do is hold on
Abby and The Postman dance
She keeps looking him over
Is something wrong
How tall are you
About six feet
Are you smart
Smarter than some  guess
Why
Just wondering
Did you ever have the bad mumps
The Postman smiles
She's odd, but beautiful
Never had the bad mumps
() 47
36   :    (2)                                                36 Have you ever had herpes or syphilis or anything like that
He shakes his head "no
"    They continue to dance
So as far as you know, you have good semen
Is that a trick question
don't mean to be nosy
'm only asking because  want you to make me pregnant
Stunned, The Postman stops dancing
Abby takes this moment to grab Michael
(to himself) It's got to be the uniform
Abby takes Michael's arm, introduces him proudly
This is my husband
Michael
Michael smiles, shakes hands with a grave-digger's grip
The Postman doesn't know what to think
We've been trying to have a baby for three years
We can't on account of Michael had the bad mumps when he was twelve
So we need a body father
We could ask a man here, but it could cause trouble
've seen it happen
Things go okay until the woman starts to show
Then it can be bad
But you'll only be around once in awhile with the mail
The Postman just stares at them
Abby looks to Michael
He hasn't said 'no'
() 48
36   :    (3)                                              36 (undaunted) What do you say, mister
You'd be doing us a favor
'll have to think about it
The Postman excuses himself with a nod and turns away, shaking his head at the strangeness of this new world
But no rest for the wicked, as soon as he's free from Abby and Michael, he's running smack into another group of well-wishing
Mrs
March is among them
She's holding an envelope
#1 Mrs
March wants to give you something
(to Mrs
March) He's right here, Irene
(re: letter) It's to my daughter Annie
She left five years ago
She was only fifteen
The last  heard, she was living up north
The Postman swallows hard, looks from the envelope to the faces around him, to Mrs
March
She looks blindly back
How can he lie to her
Look, Mrs
March, you should know that
Know what
Know that
But she stops him, grabs for his hand
have a feeling about you know you'll do what's right
Her hand leaves his and she disappears into the crowd
She's left him with her letter and no choice at all
got to get out of here

-                                          37 The Postman moves through town
The streets are deserted
He's got his pack on, his mailbag
He passes a 7-11 converted to a blacksmith shop
There's a horse tethered to the railing in front of it
He grins; maybe he's going to make it out of here after all
As he starts to move toward the horse
(
) It's right around the corner
An   sits on his porch across the street
(freezes, startled) What is
What you're looking for
The Old Man winks knowingly, then heads inside
As The Postman turns the corner, he finds himself in front of the post office
An old brick building
Chiseled in the granite facing: "

( ) -                            38 Long ago stripped, it still has a proud, official, almost holy feel
The Postman wanders in, stops to read the credo calligraphied on the wall
"Neither snow, nor rain
" He turns at a
Ford is here, leaning against a wall
knew you'd come here
You did, huh
Ford nods
sage sixteen-year-old
How do you get to be a postman, anyhow
You have to be in the right place at the right time
How could  do it
() 50
38   :                                                     38 thought you wanted to drive cars
Not anymore
That was kid's stuff
This is real
So, where's the right place
Could be anywhere
Anytime
Only another postman can make you a postman
Kinda like vampires, right
Something like that
You have to be sworn in
Ford raises his right hand, palm out, ready to take the oath
It takes The Postman a moment to realize
The organization's kinda shaky
It might not last
What does
You'd meet a lot of people who don't believe in you
'll set them straight
It's a lonely job
've been lonely all my life
This response strikes a chord
The Postman sees how badly Ford wants something to hold onto
He sees himself
So have , Ford
So have
The Postman looks up at the creed on the wall
Finally

Repeat after me

Okay then
(repeating) Okay, then
No, no, no, 'm saying that
You just listen
By my authority you are now empowered to carry the mail
(extends a hand) Congratulations, you're a postman
They shake hands
The Postman doesn't realize, but this is the most important moment in Ford's life
want you to know 'd die to get a letter through
Ford's intensity takes The Postman back
But the moment is broken when
(
) Johnny, why don't you run along
need to speak to this man
Ford bristles at "Johnny," looks to The Postman
'll see you around
Sure thing, Ford
Ford exits
Johnny's real impressed with you
Whole town's real impressed with you

Smarter than you look
What can  do for you, Sheriff
You can clear out
Or  can throw you out
Either way suits me fine
'm afraid you don't understand, Sheriff
'm a government employee
Authorized by -- You're not authorized by shit
You're nothing but a drifter who found a bag of mail
And  want you out of my town
This is going in my report
These people don't need dreams, Mr
Postman
They need something real
They need help with the goddamn Holnists
Are you going to bring them that
(as The Postman doesn't answer) Didn't think so
All you cost us so far is a few bowls of soup and maybe later a few broken hearts
aim to keep it that way
You can stay till morning
Then don't ever want to see you again
Briscoe exits, leaves The Postman alone in the post office

-  7 -                           39 The Postman arrives home
He pushes open the door, knocking over a stack of letters that have been shoved under the door
He gathers them up, flips through them
They're written on scraps, the backs of pictures, on handkerchiefs and homemade paper
They aren't old

Shaking his head, he closes the door
The Postman has no sooner done so when there's a  on the window
He looks over at a woman
She shrugs, smiles, holds up a letter
The Postman sighs; he's trapped in here

'  -                                      40 a man with a string-tied package crossing the streets and   the abandoned car where Ford lives
He's home
Concentrating, Ford holds a needle and thread and a piece of cloth on which he's drawn an approximation of the post office shoulder patch
By moonlight he embroiders it in
Not exactly work you'd pay money for, but not bad either

It's on the table with a growing stack of mail
The Postman is in bed, trying to sleep
But it's hard- coming
He laces his fingers behind his head, stares up at the moon through a hole in the wall
at the door
Just leave it
There's a pause
And then,
said leave it
The door opens
Surprise
Abby stands in the doorway, her hair held up by an old red ribbon
He sits up
Hello, Abby
You'll be leaving tomorrow

We're not supposed to waste candles like that, but they're so excited
How about you
Do you have a letter
don't have anybody to write to
'll find you a pen pal
Someone with interests similar to your own
Dancing, checking for mumps
Abby laughs
The Postman is charmed
You're funny
Hardly anyone's funny around here
guess no one feels much like laughing
The two of them just look at each other a moment
Abby fingers the ribbon in her hair
Have you decided yet
Oh, well, 've been thinking about it

Abby lets her shift drop to the floor, then slides under the sheets alongside him
Sure
Why not
They lie there awkwardly for a moment
He looks at her
God, you're beautiful
Sorry, know you'd probably like to keep things more clinical
(beat) You don't even know my name

don't want to
He nods he understands
She stares into his eyes
It would be easier for me if you closed your eyes
The Postman closes his eyes
Abby slides her hand away from his mouth
And as they start to make love
: 42
-  7 -                                42 The Postman wakes, reaches for the warm body that was there last night
But Abby is gone
All that's left behind is her red ribbon
Wistful, he picks it up

In uniform, his bag slung over his shoulder
He starts then stops short
Only now do we see most of the townspeople have silently assembled here
They've been waiting for him, starving for him
Ford steps up, hands him another fresh packet of letters
The Postman sees that Ford hangs on to four or five
What about those
These are going to Blue Jay
About twenty miles east thought  could take them
The Postman scans the crowd
Looking for Abby maybe
(absently) Okay
They're yours
Briscoe rides up, regards The Postman sternly

We want you to have this horse

He ties his mailbag to the saddle, swings himself up
#3 There's a bedroll, some oats and a week's rations
Thank you
#1 Where do you figure you'll go from here
Go
Oh yeah
'll head west, then work my way back here in a sort of figure eight

" Everyone's quiet a moment
They shift uncomfortably
The Postman looks out at the crowd
They crave hope
He should probably just keep his mouth shut
Times seem hard right now
But you have to believe it's getting better
Birds are migrating again
The rains are back
The people consider him and then each other
By God, they do feel hopeful
Suddenly, Ellen, her little boy by her side, begins to sing
It's weak at first, but one-by-one the others join in
Soon the whole town is singing: & 'Oh beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain
For purple mountain's majesty, above the fruited plain
America
' The Postman looks around
They sing their hearts out
The guilt is overwhelming
He digs his heels into the horse's flanks and rides out of town

The strains of "" still in the background
You got a helluva nerve, whoever you are
The Postman doesn't rise to the bait
Is Abby around
She and Michael are working the north meadow this morning
Briscoe reins up -- he's gone as far as his duty commands
Well, you're on your own
The Postman tips his cap and continues riding by "Pine View - Population 132
" Briscoe watches a moment, then calls after him: Hey
Are you really who you say you are
If  come back with some mail, you'll know
The Postman continues
Caught in an inner turmoil, Briscoe reaches into his pocket, and pulls out a letter
He turns it over in his hands, looks off at The Postman
God damn it
Briscoe urges his horse forward, catches up
He hands The Postman the letter, then rides back for town
The Postman watches Briscoe
The people lining the wall
And he realizes just what effect he's had
There's nothing to do, but shrug his shoulders and ride
Strains of "" still  hauntingly : 45

He just begins to tear the corner, then stops
Maybe one thing can still be sacred

The
Smiling, The Postman shoves the envelope into his bag
As he does, he finds something else
The red ribbon
He runs it through his fingers, thinks wistfully of Abby
Then, like a knight of old representing a lady's honor, he ties it to his mailbag and rides on

Waging war on dirt
Michael leans against a tree, watches Abby at work until she notices him
She wipes the sweat from her brow, tries not to smile
What are you looking at
Everything
He steps over and they're in each other's arms
This is love
But as Michael kisses her, we hear a familiar alarm: Holnists
Holnists are coming

Something about the citizens disturbs Bethlehem

Someone has hung a tattered old American flag
Who's responsible for that
No one answers
All heads are down now

The place looks almost presentable
He stops when he hears Bethlehem calling once more for the responsible party
Ford starts forward
Suddenly Briscoe is blocking his way
Holnists, Johnny
You gotta stay out of sight

One of the soldiers returns with a burning torch, gives it to Michael

Now throw it through the window of your 'post office

Struggling to get out, but Briscoe blocks his way
As flames grow, he takes one last look around
The United States doesn't exist
That flag is an abomination
Briscoe steps forward, attempts to diffuse the situation
General Bethlehem
(as Bethlehem turns) We're gathering the tribute, sir
Can  take your wagons
Bethlehem decides not to kill anyone, looks to Getty
Make sure that fire doesn't go out
The General joins Briscoe
Tears on his cheeks, Ford watches the post office burn

He looks over as Bethlehem's men nod in agreement
Michael sees that they're talking about Abby
Tell the Sheriff  want to be introduced
She does not belong in a mudhole like this
One of the men hurries off
It's concern for Abby, not for his manhood that makes him step forward
Excuse me
(looks over) You again
That's my wife, General
She's a married woman
Do you know what system of government we have here, son
(as Michael shrugs) feudal system
Like the Middle Ages
With lords and vassals
That's you and me
Those lords, they had some ideas
If a vassal got married, it was the lord's right, his right, to sleep with the bride on the wedding night
Me and Abby have been married for three years
Sorry, but  wasn't invited to the wedding
Now, you've already done me one favor, son
Don't let this be a black mark on an otherwise perfect record

What am  seeing here

Said the government had been restored back east
What government
From out of the crowd -- a voice
Ford
The United States government
Bethlehem whirls his horse at the noise
Who said that
Not waiting for an answer, Getty charges the crowd, knocks one of the onlookers down
dead silence
Bethlehem frowns, thinks it over a minute
Which way did he go

managed to save these

You want to die, too
Ford shoves the letters in a makeshift bag, then climbs onto his waiting pony

Kids smile up at him as he calls out names: Rachel Clark

Tell us about President Starkey
What about New York City
Did they survive the plague
Survive
They got Broadway up and running again
There's a kid doing Andrew Lloyd Webber like you wouldn't believe
An older woman sheds a happy tear -- this is wonderful news

It's going to be a massacre

Idiots

The Mayor peers out through an observation hole
The Postman and several others join him
No
Let's fight them
With what
We got five guns maybe 20 rounds of ammo in the whole town
How do we fight them with that
The Postman watches the Holnists prepare for attack
You don't
Negotiate a settlement
Give them extra supplies
The men look at each other
Sounds reasonable enough
Okay
You're a government rep
You go tell them
The look on The Postman's face says it all

He sits nervously on his horse waving a white flag
He's met, dismounts and is led to a command post where Bethlehem is studying a rough map of the town
Make it quick
've got an attack to coordinate
General, um, they've asked me to negotiate a peace treaty
The last time he and Bethlehem were face-to-face, the Postman had a shaved head, was dressed in rags, and was covered with cuts and bruises
Bethlehem can't place him, but there's something familiar all the same
Do  know you
don't think so, sir

watches from the flap of Bethlehem's tent
The guard sees and shoves her back inside
Bethlehem flicks at the uniform flag shoulder patch
The restored United States

Who are you really
Although he wants to confess everything, something tells The Postman he has to try to brass it out

Now, what are the terms
They'll open the gate and give you double what they usually give

This was all a misunderstanding
Bethlehem thinks this over

Her eyes search the tent -- land on the cot in the corner and focus on its heavy, wooden legs

Appreciate your offer, Postman
Problem is, you're in no position to negotiate
These people made it through the bugs and the riots and the three year winter
But they're not going to survive you
Bethlehem looks to Getty and nods
Getty motions to a gunner

Horrified, The Postman steps forward, but rifles are on him
All he can do is watch
The Mayor is the first to go down
Law six, justice can be dictated

The unhorsed rider goes for his gun
But once more    and he goes down
Bethlehem ducks as another   close
Too close

Two soldiers move forward
Suddenly The Postman's  comes  -- trampling the Holnist nearest him
The other Holnist hears, looks back, sees The Postman coming and takes aim just as The Postman brings his gun to bear

We can't stop now
They'll be coming after us
The Postman's head lolls forward
She feels something on her hand, pulls it back smeared with blood
The Postman's shot in the belly
The horse is failing
Near death

Abby urges the horse off the road

He draws his rifle from the saddle boot and starts into the thicket
The Postman lies unconscious on the ground
Abby sits beside him, rifle in hand
The Sixth Soldier appears
Don't move
He hesitates at first
Then dismounts and moves toward her
Abby cocks the rifle
If you'd had a bullet, you'd a used it by now
Moving closer still, he doesn't see the  pulled back in The Postman's hand until it  hard into his face
He stumbles back
You're right
Abby dashes out, rifle in hand
She swings for the bleachers
The butt catches the side of the Sixth Soldier's head
He falls hard
The Postman's eyes flutter
Dazed, he watches as Abby pilfers through the Soldier's gear
She takes everything of value: a knife, bullets, a canteen
His eyes flutter closed

He groans as she rolls him onto it, tucks a blanket around him
Using all the strength God gave her, Abby lifts one end, gets it high enough to hitch it to the Sixth Soldier's horse

He's conscious, but pale as a ghost
Abby brings him a bowl of soup
Very thin soup

How sorry are you

Abby considers this, The Postman's gaze flickers down to the spoon he still holds in his hand
Taking one last stab at a joke
(re: the spoon) Don't make me use this
Abby doesn't laugh
But she does relent
She steps away

The two big meals around here are grass and snow
And we're running out of grass

Both prone, they're also nearly nose-to- nose

Arm- in-arm, they start for the cabin

Abby lies in her own makeshift bed, also awake
After a long silence: We walked on the moon once, Abby
So
What good is that now
Obviously you've forgotten Tang and microwave ovens

Abby looks up
Not so bruised
Look, there's something you'd better know
You're going to find out soon enough

Tangled beard
Matted hair
Is that him
He suddenly starts sharpening the knife with renewed vigor
We get a sense he's not going to use it on the fish
plunge into the water, pull splashfuls up
We The Postman's back, then   as he washes his face
He's just finished shaving off his beard with the hunting knife
He's nicked-up, but it's a definite improvement and he smiles in satisfaction -- until he sees -- Abby, reflected in the water
Abby
The Postman whips around to see her standing there
What is it
What's wrong
Is it the baby
The pass is clear
It's time to go
Behind her, he sees the cabin is on fire
Takes off running

Yeah
It looks nice

Rose is out there
And 'm going to find it
But you're The Postman
Look, 'm nobody, Abby

Before he can come clean -- they see a distant coming hard
The Postman unslings the rifle, slides a round into the chamber
This is what  hate
Strangers
Do you say 'hi' or do you blow their head off
Do they want to share what they got or take what you have
And if they want to take, how far are you willing to go to stop them
Damn it
(to the Rider) All right
That's far enough
The Rider pulls up short, wearing a blue home-made uniform
We don't want any trouble
Me neither, mister
The Postman is taken aback
The Rider, a girl, pulls off her cap, mops it across her brow
Maybe 14, we'll always know her by her Ponytail
Abby registers the uniform first

No, tell us
He's only the greatest man who ever lived
He crossed the wasteland, shook his fist at the enemy and spit in the eye of General Bethlehem himself
He's back east with President Starkey right now
Who told you all this

Hands down
Their hands go down in one crisp military move
The Postman looks at Abby, to Ford as he exits the tent
The kid is craving reassurance
You'll stay 'til President Starkey sends word, right
Right
Yeah, till he sends word, right
Ford smiles, gestures to the carriers
Could you say a few words
The Postman looks over at the carriers
They quiet under his gaze, immediately respectful
The problem is, he has no idea what to say
Finally: Two plus two equals four
The cheering is tumultuous
The Postman picks Abby out of the cheering crowd -- the look on her face says it all
94
-   -                                  94 The guts of the operation
Several carriers are busy sorting and bagging letters
It goes out pinned to a clothesline which crisscrosses back and forth
Everyone follows as Ford takes The Postman on a tour
There are hushed whispers among those who are seeing him for the first time
We bring all the mail here first
We sort it, group it and then it goes out
So far we got thirty routes
Ford leads The Postman and Abby into another Winnebago
Chubby and Red and Ponytail follow
Those that can't fit just peer in through the windows

-                                          95 An old manual crank printing press is working away
Ford proudly removes a sheet, shows it to The Postman caricature of eight evil Holnists, forming a figure eight
Beneath: "Unite Against Holnist Tyrraney
" You spelled tyranny wrong
(low, to Red) Boy, he's smart

-   -                               96 The seven young Recruits seen earlier stand in a line
They're joined by  , every day of 75 years old
Ponytail holds up her hand, swears them in
/ Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night
As they finish, The Postman and Ford pass by
The Recruits salute
Shaking his head, The Postman's about to salute back when he spots Old George
George has a faded purple "" tattoo on his arm and a twinkle in his eye
There's an old crow on his shoulder
How old are you
Seventy-five, sir
The Postman looks over at Ford, who shrugs
Can you ride
Nope
Can't walk too good, either
Why are you here
know stuff
The Postman looks at Ford again
Then: () 89

-  -                                97 Carriers move items out of the trailer
The camp is buzzing as usual
The Postman looks on -- sees Abby passing by
Abby -- Yes
He's got her attention, just doesn't know what to do with it
Ford wants me to have his trailer
Said it's the best one
'm on the other side of town
got plenty of room here
She shakes her head, and then walks away
The Postman watches her disappear into the bustle of the camp
So much for the uniform theory

'  -                                   99 Bethlehem once again at his easel with palette in hand

Can't tell what it is if you stand too close
The colors all kinda run together, don't they
Yes
Bethlehem looks away from his painting to see Gibbs and Getty flanking a scared, blue-clad mail carrier
For an instant, mistakes him for: Well, if it isn't our old friend the
man
We captured him on the Oregon border
Realizing, Bethlehem turns the face from side-to-side
Who the hell are you
() Carrier Twelve
United States, um, Postal Service
Getty sets some of the Carrier's anti-Holnist propaganda onto Bethlehem's field table
Bethlehem picks it up
It's hard to say what he's thinking
Finally: want the camp struck at dawn
We're moving north
Yes, sir
Bethlehem looks back to Carrier Twelve
(chilling) You spelled tyranny wrong

-                                            100 Ten letter carriers are on horseback
Among them, Red and Ponytail
Ford and The Postman are also on horses
Each rider salutes The Postman, then gets a sheaf of anti- Holnist propaganda from Ford
wish they'd stop saluting
It's annoying him
As Chubby rides up
The Postman catches his right wrist as he attempts to salute
So Chubby salutes with the left hand instead
As they line up: Just stay safe and remember
The mailman's more important than the mail
Boy, he's smart
The sun just peeks up over the horizon
At that signal, the carriers thunder off, the ground trembling under them
The look on their faces
The glory of it all
They're alive
The Postman hesitates, watches after them a moment
What the hell
Urging his horse forward, he rides after them
With them
And then, like an exploding firework, each postman shoots off in a separate direction
Headed for all points of the compass and some in between
101
-                                       101 The Postman looks down on the gathered crowd from his horse and smiles
For President Starkey and the First Congress of the Restored United States,  officially declare Postal Station 10
What's the name of this town
We never named it

/  -                              105 Seen  the porch, a rider gallops hard on the road beyond
comes rushing out, letter in hand
The boy pulls up short; realizes the rider is already too far gone
The boy's shoulders sag; he's crushed
missed him
It's an almost psychic moment as the rider reins up in the distance and turns back around
frozen beat and he starts galloping back down the road
Fearless, the boy holds out the letter
The rider closes; it's The Postman
The boy stretches out as far as he can
Without breaking stride, The Postman leans out of the saddle, snatches the letter as he passes
The boy watches after him -- knows what he's going to be when he grows up

-                                     106 Sheriff Briscoe huffs and puffs his big frame up the ladder and onto the top of the palisade
Phil, this better not be another of your
's
He looks where the sentry points
The Postman waits at the gate, behind him on horseback: Ford and Abby

And  got mail

107
-                                     107 The Postman rides with Briscoe, hurrying to stay alongside him
Half the town jogs along behind them
Bethlehem is offering a 1000 pounds of gold to whoever brings you in
Dead or alive
Thank God it wasn't a carton of cigarettes

It's in full swing couple of guitars
banjo and a trombone
Everyone dances
The Postman walks with Briscoe, sees Mrs
March as her letter is read to her
Catches a glimpse of Abby dancing with Ford
He seems, for the first time, truly happy
For that matter, so does Briscoe
Things are getting better
Getting better all the time
(a beat) don't know who you are, but  do know  was wrong about you
The Postman smiles, reaches in his bag for an envelope
Got a letter for you, Sheriff
Briscoe turns it over in his hands, looks up in wonder
It's from my sister
thought she was dead

108   :                                                     108 You thought wrong
Briscoe has tears in his eyes
The Postman continues on, embarrassed but affected
The Postman taps Ford's shoulder, wants to cut in on him and Abby
Ford steps aside

They begin
Her eyes are on her feet, careful that she doesn't take a misstep
But his eyes are on her

: They whirl as the tempo picks up
The Postman pulls Abby in closer
Her eyes now move up to his
They're closing in on the terrified Red
Abby and The Postman
The chemistry is undeniable
in the back, Red throws back his arms
Letters flutter from the mail bag over his shoulder; he seems to glide along that way forever
The Postman looks at Abby; she's so beautiful
Like only a pregnant woman can be

Abby snaps out of the dream she's in
This isn't right
Breaking away, she heads off
As he watches her go: Red falls from his horse
One of the soldiers scoops up his mailbag

( ) -                        110 By lantern, Bethlehem and Getty watch as Gibbs sorts through the contents of the confiscated mailbag
Births and deaths, the weather, gossip
There's nothing here
Nothing
Everything is here
Am the only one who sees that
(to Gibbs) Get out
Gibbs hurries away, leaving Bethlehem and Getty alone
Give the people back their hope and their dreams won't be far behind
Bethlehem sees Getty waiting
What is it, Getty
Getty hands Bethlehem a sheet of paper -- something Gibbs missed
It's a propaganda sheet featuring a caricature of The Postman leading a few carriers against Bethlehem and his army -- represented as Hitler and the Nazis
The caption underneath reads: "Ride Against the Holnist Tide

The Postman sits beside him, listening as  pours from an old car
Who do you talk to
Not a soul in seven years of trying
But  will
The Postman steps to a telescope pointing up through a hole in the trailer ceiling
Go ahead
Take a look

No
No thanks
Hey, don't let the kids see that
George nods and goes on playing with the dials -- searching for a voice in the void

An old flag ruffles outside the post office -- the only new structure in town
Old George sweeps the porch as a patrol of ten Holnist soldiers ride into town
George makes no move to flee as they near
As they rein up across from him he just smiles and continues sweeping
Sensing it, the Holnist officer looks up
There, on the roof, stands The Postman
Ford and Briscoe flank him -- along with twenty mailmen and locals, armed with guns, bows and rocks
As the soldiers raise their rifles, the roofies
George whips up a sawed-off
Caught in the storm, the ten soldiers go down

As they repeat after him we realize they've changed the oath a bit
/ Neither snow, nor heat, nor gloom of night
Through bandit's hell, through fire fight
Through flood and plague we cannot fail
No Holnist trash will stop the mail
riding his weary mount into town, saddlebags bulging with mail
He pauses by the new recruits long enough to hear the words they're saying
As he dismounts, a fresh-faced carrier takes the bridle
The Postman's well past the point of fatigue
He's living on pure adrenaline
Get this mail sorted
Bring me a fresh horse
Something to eat
As fresh-face starts away, The Postman calls after him
And all the mail going South
The Postman watches as Ford shakes the hands of the new recruits
The Postman reaches for his canteen
Empty

He drains the cup and hands it back to her
Just then, one of the new recruits, , steps over
Sir
It'd be an honor if  could shake your hand

Nice kid
Probably be dead in a week

You need rest

You know the rule
What rule
Twenty-two's too far south
But they're waiting on their mail down there
Get off the goddamn horse
Shocked, she does
At the same time, fresh-face comes up leading a second horse laden with mail
(re: Ponytail's horse) Tie him off to this one
Fresh-face goes about tying the second horse to the first
You can't keep doing this
Doing what
Riding all the routes
You're not saving anyone
The Postman climbs on Ponytail's horse, looks at Abby
Did  ever tell you how  got to be a postman, Abby

No, this is all my doing

Because Bethlehem has to know that we're not going to stop

He writes "Bethlehem" across the front, starts to write a second letter
The door opens and Abby enters
Ford thinks you're going to do something
am
The Postman watches as, outside, the mail carriers begin to assemble
If  don't, those kids are going to keep on getting themselves killed
Ford doesn't know what it means to be a kid
He doesn't have your memories
None of them do
All they've got is the lousy world we gave them
And this is the only decent thing in it
What
Being a postman
It's all bullshit, Abby
All of it
(beat) took this uniform off a skeleton to stay warm
made up the rest to stay fed
There is no restored United States
knew it was something like that
The Postman fingers the brim of the cap, softens

(re: red ribbon) Remember this
You left it behind that night
remember
always liked to think you left it on purpose
But maybe you just forgot it
Abby doesn't answer
She leaves instead

Abby's off to the side
Is this everybody
The rest are on the overdue list
This is everybody
(for all) Got a letter from President Starkey
An excited murmur among the carriers
Only Ford eyes The Postman suspiciously
The Postman reads: 'Greetings all carriers
' Greetings, President Starkey

've received all the reports
'm proud of you all

You beat back despair and replaced it with hope and for that your country can never repay you
But the price is too high
won't see anymore of my bravest die
It is my duty to hereby disband the Postal Service of the restored United States
You are to burn your uniforms and The Postman is to return to Minneapolis at once
Thank you and that is all
hushed silence
The Postman walks away
The carriers exchange tired, defeated looks
Abby just sighs, knows he's not necessarily wrong
Ford catches up with The Postman
He stares at The Postman; The Postman stares back
(low; fierce) The President never wrote that letter
If he could've that's what he would have said
Ford gestures to the second letter
Who's the other letter to
Bethlehem
'm taking it to him in the morning
What does it say
Mail's private
You know that
What does it say
(stops; turns) It says it's over
It says we quit

What about the oath
Tell me something, Ford
How much mail can a dead postman deliver
It's over
The Postman starts to walk away again
Then 'll take it
can't trust you
Ford gathers courage and confronts The Postman
If this is the end
If this is the last piece of mail that ever gets delivered
'll take it
Whoever takes this letter probably dies for it
Ford thrusts out his hand
'm still a postman
You owe it to me
owe it to me
The Postman hesitates, studies the intense young man
Gives him the letter

'm going to St
Rose, Abby
And 'm taking you with me
know you don't want to hear it, but that's my child inside you want to see it born somewhere safe
have a right to that, Abby
Whether you like it or not
Abby walks away

Thought  recognized you
General Bethlehem said
(raises the pistol) You should be on your knees when  do it
don't give a damn what that asshole said
The general is a great man
The general is a fucking lunatic
The Postman steps forward
Stops when the barrel of the pistol is right against his own chest
You don't own a thought in that goddamn head of yours, do you
(a beat) You want to see a man
The Postman turns to watch as Ford starts out of camp
That's a man
The Postman turns, sees Luke's face fraught with confusion and emotion
You don't understand, do you
You never will until you can think for yourself and be willing to pay the price for it
Luke stares back into The Postman's eyes
frozen beat
You ready

) Yes

She's witness to it all
Luke is confused and ashamed
The Postman mounts his horse and moves to Abby's side
You're a better man than Bethlehem, Luke
've seen it

The Postman and Abby ride up on the ridge above the camp
They pause to look back one last time
Across the way, on the other side, Ford is doing the same thing
As though he senses it, Ford stops and looks back
Ford raises his hand, salutes
Slowly, The Postman brings up his own hand
But he doesn't salute
He waves
Good- bye
As Ford turns away, so does The Postman
, watching as The Postman and Abby disappear from sight
Guess Minneapolis is that way

The Postman no longer wears his uniform
Their gear is packed behind their saddles
As a family of transients begin to rise from where they're camped in the breakdown lane: We can't help you
We're just as lost as you are
The Postman rides on
Abby watches over her shoulder as they slowly begin to sit back down

Getty and Gibbs bring in a prisoner
It's Ford
Good lord, what do we have here
'm a representative of the restored United States -- Bethlehem backhands Ford
He's got a letter
Says The Postman sent it

Bethlehem tears open the letter and starts to read: 'Bethlehem
This letter is my testimony to the fact that there is no restored United States and there is no Postal Service

In exchange, 'm asking you to let them be

He expects me to believe this

've won
As the assembled Holnists congratulate each other, Bethlehem looks at Luke
You were supposed to kill him
couldn't get close enough
(re: Ford) This one's his second in command
Bethlehem looks Ford over
Why doesn't that surprise me
Ford stares back
Proud
Bethlehem looks to Getty
Bring out the one we found yesterday
They can die together
frightened  is brought up
He wears a purple uniform with  sewn on the shoulder
Neither we nor Ford have seen him before
As a firing squad assembles, Ford is shoved over with him
Who are you
Name's Clark
Postal Carrier of the restored Republic of California
Who are you
Ford looks at him a second, can't help but laugh
From Gibbs; the shout of "ready

It's an honor
Bethlehem watches as Clark holds out his hand
Ford shakes it
"Aim

It'll go on except 'll be fighting a goddamn ghost
Should we fire, sir
No goddamnit

No,  won't fight a ghost

It's The Postman
He turns over a body in the water
It wears a homemade postal uniform, a bag of mail twisted around his arm
It's a young face, one we haven't seen before
He looks up to Abby on a ridge
don't know him
Do you
(shakes her head) Where do you think he came from
Puzzled, The Postman shakes his head
He gently releases the body
The current takes it and they watch as it continues on its way to Postal Valhalla

Amazingly, one gray house still stands, miraculously untouched by whatever disaster visited this place

He waves hello with a

Howdy
Welcome to sunny California

Little accident

But the sunsets are beautiful
You ever hear of a city called St
Rose
Friend, 've never heard of St

The Squatter laughs and laughs -- like it was the funniest thing in the world
The Postman and Abby exchange a look, continue on their way
Hey, don't go

No

Rain beats down, as The Postman and Abby trudge along
Up ahead, a rail-road tunnel promises shelter from the storm
(re: the tunnel) We can rest in there
Abby is quick to agree
Out of the corner of his eye, The Postman catches a blur of movement
He turns his head quickly, but he's barely in time to see a wooden basket, attached to one of the high wires, swing from a distant tower
There's a sentry inside it
The basketed sentry whistles away at 40 mph, heading straight for an adjacent tower
In a matter of seconds, he's lost from view
The Postman looks back at Abby
She's shivering
Did you see that
(shaking her head) 'm hungry, Postman
The Postman guides her toward the train tunnel

The Columbia River rushes far below

It isn't even loaded
Where are we
The   , a middle-aged retro-hippie, steps up
You're in Bridge City
Where we don't allow guns

The Guard steps over to scoop it up

You're famous

Not anymore

We will be
Right now, we'd just appreciate some food

Abby rests
Ponytail, Chubby and Drew look up gratefully as one of the citizens of Bridge City doles out bread
The Mayor steps over, hands The Postman two loaves
For you and your wife
Thanks
She's not my wife
The exchange cuts Abby like a knife
She gets up and leaves
The Mayor keeps his council -- not sure what to make of this arrangement
Let me ask you something, have you ever heard of a town with electric lights
St
Rose
Yeah
Never been
But they say it's a ways down on the coast
How far

It's the discovery of a lifetime
The Postman looks to the west end of the bridge, where Abby stands alone
You seem like a decent man
And these seem like decent people
We try to be
And this seems like a safe place
(intuitive) You want to leave her
The Postman looks back to the Mayor, then slowly nods
All of them
'll give you the horses and my gear
Abby's special
She's strong
Probably end up running the place

Decide if that's what you really want

The mist parts to reveal, seventy yards away: three Holnist scouts on horseback
Emissaries from hell

As word spreads, folks move down the bridge for a look

Finally, the Mayor points him back the way he came
The lead scout doesn't budge, spots The Postman in the crowd
He and The Postman seem to stare at each other forever
Then, with a flick of the reins, he's gone
The other two follow
Swallowed up by the misty evening gloom
The Postman's head swims dizzily
It's not over
The Mayor returns to dozens of nervous questions
They're looking for The Postman
No such thing anymore
Man on the horse says there is
Says he thinks he's here
Says he's coming back with friends
little  steps forward, sings out
What's a postman
silent moment
It's been so long, no one's sure how to answer
The Postman looks down at the ground
The carriers exchange deflated looks
Then
(stepping forward) You never heard of a postman
He shakes his head "no
" Seems a shame
As The Postman looks over at Abby, she takes a page from his book
There used to be a postman for every street in America
They wore uniforms
And hats
Like this one
She goes to The Postman's gear, returns with his postal cap
Sets it on the boy's head
Wow

He knew our birthdays
He'd even find the baseballs you'd hit down the street
can still see the smile on his face
The tip of his cap -- when he had a letter in his bag with my name on it
Mine always came just after school
You could set your watch by him
Unless you were waiting on something special -- like a present from somewhere far away or a letter from your sweetheart
Then it seemed like he'd never come
used to think they could make time stand still
Several other listeners nod -- they're completely with her
don't think we ever really understood what they meant to us until they were gone
Getting a letter made you feel like you were part of something bigger than yourself
No place was ever too far away for the postman
So nobody ever had to be alone
The postman was someone you could count on
Things just made more sense when they were around
(beat) That's the kind of world we used to have
world a lot of us took for granted
And now we've got this one
And it makes me wonder -- what kind of world do want my child to live in
want my child to live in a world where hopes and dreams aren't just lies you tell yourself to get through another day
want my child, and want my friends --  want all of us to live in a world where you still get your mail

Yes
've heard of you, man
You're famous
Yeah,  guess  am
And all of a sudden, 'm not wearing the right clothes
And as he puts on his cap, he accepts the mantle as well

Hands reach up to steady it and bring it gently to the ground
It's one of many
The Postman and Abby gasp as the Mayor opens the lid to reveal: 20 well-oiled rifles and 15 pistols with ammo
The Postman blinks over at the Mayor
Fact that we don't allow 'em doesn't mean we don't have 'em
We're not stupid, after all
'm sorry 've brought this on you
No need to be sorry
Long as we get our mail on time

The Postman lets go of her hand and starts for the basket
The Mayor gestures to the line of towers extending into the distance
There's three good-sized towns up that way
Enough folks to be a big help to you
If you can convince them to come
As The Postman steps into the basket, he makes the mistake of looking over the edge
It's a long, long way down
lot higher than it looks, huh
The Postman looks at the contraption with more than a little trepidation
The Mayor grins
Don't tell anybody, but  like to ride the damn thing just for the hell of it
Being a city official has its perks
He winks and as he reaches for the release pin
The Postman's hand meets his there
Trust me, man
This'll get you there a lot faster

But it's The Postman we hear, all the magic back in his voice

Steady, boys, steady

He starts to rise

Drew, Chubby, and a ragtag thirty coming from the north
And from the south, Ponytail leading a contingent of fifty
The forces converge and continue east
160
-                                           160 The army has gathered
Three hundred strong
Bethlehem and Getty stand outside the command tent, listening to a winded, frightened Gibbs
We Bethlehem's eyes  Gibbs'   the horizon, where he sees: The Postman and his army of two hundred carriers cresting a distant rise
() 129
160   :                                                     160 (
) We were outnumbered, sir
How many
least a hundred
With guns
(feigning shock) With guns
Are you sure
Yes, sir
Looks more like two hundred to me
He steps away to get a better vantage point of the approaching army
He reaches out -- Getty hands him a pair of binoculars
(donning a pair of leather gloves) Only thing worse than a coward is one who can't count
Lieutenant, do yourself a favor
Die well in this battle
In my army a deserter's life is a brief and unpleasant one
Bethlehem watches The Postman through the binoculars -- a hint of a smile on his face
(to himself) At last, someone with courage enough to bring the fight to me
Holnist soldier stands by with Bethlehem's horse
The General mounts -- the model of military calm and precision
Getty reins up beside him
Reckoning, gentlemen
This is the day 've dreamed of
161
-                                          161 sea of wildflowers separates the carriers from the Holnists
The monster John Deere gun is ready for battle
130
162
-                                         162 Bethlehem stands with Getty, scanning the postal line with his binoculars
The carriers look, just spoiling for a fight
Bethlehem lowers his binoculars, smiles grimly
They're an eager-looking bunch
Morale's a dangerous thing
(to Getty) Bring him up
want this postman to see how the game is played
163
'  -                                       163 The Postman, Chubby, Ponytail and Old George and all the carriers have taken positions
The Postman sights through a telescope
He scans further down the line -- then stops when he sees Ford
Bloody, beaten within inches of his life
He's shackled -- surrounded by Holnist guards
The Postman's eyes turn to stone
(to carriers) Stay here
No one moves until give the orders
He clicks his horse forward, toward the Holnist line
164
-                                         164 Bethlehem, flanked by Getty and the Holnist Sergeant, watches as The Postman makes his approach
He reaches into his pocket, withdraws a white kerchief and holds it in the air
Are they surrendering
God,  hope not
He watches for a moment as The Postman crosses the field - - moving well within range of Holnist fire
Then, he coaxes his horse forward
131
165
-                                               165 Bethlehem and The Postman riding toward each other
They meet when The Postman is almost three-quarters of the way over to the Holnists' side
As they come face-to-face
My little shipping clerk
We're both a couple of frauds
You know it;  know it
Bethlehem sneers
Great men are made by other great men
Patton had Rommel
Grant had Lee
But  get you
You're no fucking   general
You're a copying machine   salesman
You're not even a   good painter
Are you trying to goad me into a fight
Wouldn't it be great if wars could be fought just by the assholes who started them
We could settle this thing right here
You and me
Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way
It does in your army
The Postman kicks his horse up into a gallop, and rides up the Holnist line
No one, least of all Bethlehem, is sure what's going on
invoke law seven of the Laws of Eight
Any man may challenge for leadership of the clan
() 132
165   :                                                      165 What
The Postman wheels his horse around
challenge you
Bethlehem is caught completely by surprise, but recovers
You're not a Holnist
You're not a member of the clan
You don't have the right
The Postman rolls up his sleeve
He rides the Holnist lines displaying his brand for all to see
The Holnists murmur amongst themselves
have every right
invoke law seven
Bethlehem can't believe his eyes
challenge for leadership of the clan
The seed of doubt is planted
Is Bethlehem violating one of the Laws of Eight
The men look at one another
Gibbs looks to Getty
Bethlehem looks from The Postman's tattoo to his face
Where do  know you from
'Cry Havoc
And let slip the dogs of war
' Remember that
Shakespeare
The one who didn't want to fight
should've found a way to kill you then
But you seemed so strong
Law seven it is
(to all) This war is settled here
() 133
165   :    (2)                                                 165 As The Postman nods in agreement
They take their positions -- and without a word -- they kick their horses into a charge
Coming straight for each other like medieval jousters
Bethlehem reaches for his sword
But before it clears the scabbard, The Postman lunges
The horses collide
Bethlehem and The Postman hit the ground hard
Holnists and Carriers alike begin to move forward for a better look
The fight is fierce
Bloody
The Postman and Bethlehem are at each other like coiled snakes
It's more of a fight than any of the Holnists -- especially Getty -- expected
The spectators pull in tighter
Both combatants have taken a beating -- and still, they fight on -- trading bloody, raw-knuckled punches
One of Bethlehem's connects
The Postman loses his footing, hits the ground -- knocking his head on a rock with a resounding
Dazed, he's slow to rise
It's just the moment Bethlehem needs, he straddles the fallen Postman, reaches for his knife with one hand -- grabs The Postman's throat with the other
study people
know your problem
Do you know why you can't fight
The Postman can't answer
You have nothing to fight for
You don't care about anything
You don't value anything
You don't believe in anything
That's what makes me better
The Postman grabs Bethlehem's knife-hand -- using all his remaining strength to keep him at bay
(barely audible) believe in the United States Postal Service
() 134
165   :    (3)                                                 165 The Postman lets go of Bethlehem's hands, grabs his belt and pulls him over
As they roll to their feet, The Postman club-fists Bethlehem on the side of the head
Neither snow
(wham
) Nor rain
(wham
) Nor heat
(wham
) Nor gloom of night
(wham
) Will stay this courier from the swift completion of his appointed rounds
Bethlehem reels, stumbling back
The Postman pounces on top of him, begins to strangle him
Bethlehem tries to pry the fingers from his throat, but can't
He's going to die
The Postman is urged on
By both sides
Holnists
Carriers
Ford
Even Holnist Luke
He looks up at the faces -- and finally lets Bethlehem go
The General gasps for breath
As Ponytail and Chubby move forward to untie Ford, The Postman looks to both sides
It doesn't have to be this way
We don't have to kill each other
We can live together
We can -- Ford takes Chubby's pistol, sets it against the side of Bethlehem's head
Law three
Mercy is for the weak
Ford, don't
Bethlehem shakes his head -- doesn't want him to, either
Law eight
There is only one penalty and that penalty is death
Ford's going to shoot
() 135
165   :    (4)                                                165 He isn't worth it
'm the head of the clan now
There are going to be new laws
(to all) Law one
No more killing
There's going to be peace
The Postman looks at carriers and Holnists alike
Who else
Who else has a law
Everyone has to learn how to read
That's law two
Who else
#1 Three
Liberty and justice for all
Four
No more tattoos
#2 Law five
Give peace a chance
#2 Law six
Mercy is, it's okay sometimes
#3 Seven
Bring back vacations
The Postman nods solemnly, looks to Ford
How about it, Ford Lincoln Mercury
You give us law eight
Ford grits his teeth
(close -- for Ford) Be a leader, Ford
Law eight
Ford
Bethlehem flinches, then sags as he realizes Ford has fired into the ground
() 136
165   :    (5)                                                165 Live and let live
The Postman smiles in relief as Ford lowers the revolver and starts to hand the weapon over
Forgotten for an instant, Bethlehem makes a last, wild lunge, grabs Ford's gun
As Bethlehem aims at The Postman, a  rings out
Hit in the chest, Bethlehem blinks in amazement before he falls to the ground, dying
Getty has shot him
Would  had bestowed that time in the tongues that  have in fencing, dancing and bear-baiting
Oh, had  but followed the arts
He dies
Grow like savages -- as soldiers will -- that nothing do but mediate on blood
Getty throws his rifle on the ground
Other weapons are laid down
The war, at long last, is over
Somebody take a letter
Huh
letter
: 166
'  ( ) -                             166 Abby, in bed, holding her new baby in her arms
She's reading a letter
What she reads makes her smile
She puts the letter down and cuddles her baby
Your daddy wrote to tell you that he'll be here as soon as he can
And that he loves you very much
Abby looks up to see The Postman standing at her door
She looks at him, smiling with tears in her eyes
() 137
166   :                                                         166 Mail's slow
'll have to see about that
Abby smiles down at the child in her arms
Your daughter
Her name is Hope
The Postman takes the tiny child in his arms
(
) And so my father returned home after the Holnists were defeated
167
-                                                 167 beach town
No wall, no sentries, just cottages lining a dozen sand-swept streets
crowd has gathered to hear The Postman's daughter, , mid-thirties, speak
Beside her, a bearded, 52-year-old Ford in his postmaster's uniform
They stand before a large, tarp-draped statue
But he never did see St
Rose
There was too much to be done
He'd made a promise and in keeping it -- he traded one dream for another
With no regrets
And so, in honor of my father
She unveils the statue: we've seen this before
It's The Postman on his horse, low-slung in the saddle, leaning down to pluck the letter from the Little Boy's hand
There's an   in the audience who seems especially moved by the statue
There's a younger man beside him
That was me
As St
Rose applauds
