Then comes to a stop on the African continent
golden papyrus  of rises up
on it, towards a  along the Nile, it's name written in hierarchic
until the golden map turns to golden sand and we find ourselves on this ancient Egyptian city
Only it's not ancient

This is
Home of Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris, Keeper of the Dead
gorgeous, olive-skinned goddess enters the outer foyer
It takes us a moment to realize that the skin-tight dress she's wearing isn't a dress at all, but rather her entire naked body has been  in the ancient Egyptian manner She's a stunning sight to behold
This is --
Birthplace of Anck-su-namun
Pharaoh's Mistress
No other man was allowed to touch her
She makes her way through the ornate statuary
The comes to a stop on a
And then it's eyes suddenly
It's really a strange looking Several more of these hideous, bald  stand nearby
They are the  of Osiris
Imhotep's guys
Their eyes watch Anck-su-namun vanish through the bedroom curtains
Anck-su-namun embraces Imhotep, they kiss passionately, feverishly
Imhotep's hands roam over her perfect body, smearing the paint
The Narrator's  fills with lust: But for our love, we were willing to risk life itself
And we realize that the Narrator is actually Imhotep himself on the other-side of the curtains, the bald Priests rush over and close the doors
But just as they do, the doors suddenly
Pharaoh angrily strides in, looks at the Priests
The following  is in  , -- What are you doing here
The Priests back away, scared shitless, obviously his arrival was unexpected
Pharaoh strides for the curtains
Throws them back
Anck-su-namun stands alone
Gives him a sexy smile
Pharaoh sees the smeared body paint
Points his finger
From behind him, his sword is ripped out of its scabbard
Pharaoh spins around
It's Imhotep
Pharaoh is shocked
Imhotep
My priest
Behind him, Anck-su-namun lifts a dagger and plunges it into his back
Pharaoh
Imhotep raises Pharaoh's sword
The hideous bald Priests  the doors and bolt them tight
Through the curtains, they see the  of Anck-su-namun and Imhotep stab away at Pharaoh
Suddenly, the doors are  from the other side, --
Imhotep and Anck-su-namun turn and look
--
The doors are  again
The two lovers share desperate looks
--
The bald Priests run up and grab Imhotep and try and pull him towards the balcony
Pharaoh's bodyguards
Imhotep tries to break free, but Anck-su-namun rips Pharaoh's sword out of his hand and pushes him towards the balcony
-- You must go
Save yourself
Only you can resurrect me
Imhotep's face fills with despair
The

These are the The Priests hustle Imhotep out onto the dark balcony just as the Mumia rip through the curtains
Anck-su-namun points at Pharaoh and hisses -- -- My body is no longer his temple
She  the sword into her own heart
Out on the balcony, Imhotep's mouth opens into a horrible silent scream
/ For murdering Pharaoh, Anck-su-namun's body was to be cursed
And it was , the High Priest, whose duty it was to curse it
- Imhotep leads-a - procession across the dunes
Anck- su-namun's mummy is carried by
They put her down in the sand along with
Her body was mummified, her vital organs removed and placed in sacred canopic jars
Imhotep, filled with dread, reads from a  made out of pure
The Book of The Living contained sacred incantations that would send the evil dead on a journey into the dark underworld
Strange  suddenly  across the faces of the slaves and the
Suddenly, everyone's fear-filled eyes all rise, as if watching Anck-su-namun's body rising
Then one last  , accompanied by a   , and it's over
Anck-su-namun's body now lies twisted on the ground
Imhotep's Priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus
The Nubian slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand
Imhotep then signals to the Soldiers, who throw their spears at the Nubians
Killing them
The slaves were killed
Imhotep's knife-wielding Priests attack the now unarmed Soldiers, hacking at them in the flickering darkness as Imhotep and the Mumia solemnly watches
and the soldiers who killed them were also slain, so that no unholy person should ever know the exact location of the burial site
The Mumia walk off across the sand and then, one by one, the Priests stop their frenzied stabbing and stare off at the vanishing Mumia
As the last Mumia disappears over a distant dune, Imhotep nods, and the Priests leap onto Anck-su-namun's grave and begin digging it back up with their hands
- race out into the moonlit desert
Imhotep leads the way
"hearse" carries Anck-su-namun's mummy The chariots race across the map
But there was another book, The Book Of The Dead, which was never to be opened, never to be read, for it contained the incantations that could bring a dead body back to life a most unholy thing
The chariots arrive at a place marked on the map in hieratic
They race up the stone ramp and in through the city gates
across the  are the : - City of the Dead It was hidden at Hamunaptra, City of the Dead, inside the statue of Anubis, so that no such sacrilege might ever disgrace Egypt
-   - Imhotep pulls an   out of a inside the giant
He opens the chest and lifts out     , made of black stone
But for my love of Anck-su-namun was willing to defy the gods
- Big hairy  scurry through the mausoleums and over the headstones of this very large, scary,
surrounds the cemetery, -- muck made out of filthy water and human remains
Skulls bob in the goop
The Priests have gathered in a circle
Their hooded, lifeless eyes seem dead to this world
Their bald heads rock back and forth as they , a quiet eerie
Heinous creatures
In the middle of the circle is a strange, twisted
Imhotep has unwrapped Anck-su-namun's gorgeous, lifeless body and placed her five sacred canopic jars around her
Anck-su-namun's vital organs were still fresh, so a human sacrifice would not need be made
As Imhotep begins to read from The Book of The Dead, a large starts to open in the detritus bog
Several Priests look over at it, frightened, then quickly look back down and resume
strange  wafts up out of the swirling hole and over to the jars, it passes through them and into Anck-su-namun's body
One of the jars , the heart inside begins to
The  , ,  ,   and '  are reaching a crescendo
Anck-su-namun's  suddenly
Anck-su-namun soul had come back from the dead
Now all that was needed, was to return her organs to their rightful place within her body
Imhotep lifts a sacrificial knife above Anck-su-namun's breast, about to plunge it down
The ,  and heart
And that's when the Mumia   and storm through the startled Priests
The the jar with the beating heart
The  instantly sucks back out of Anck-su-namun's body and  back into the swirling hole
Anck-su-namun's eyes close
Dying once again
Imhotep in rage
The Mumia grab him and his Priests
My Priests were condemned to be mummified alive
( -) - Inside a - , Imhotep is held by Anubis-headed He cringes at the flickering, impressionistic glimpses of his Priests being embalmed and mummified alive
The horrid-looking Embalmers, using knives, needles and thread, calmly perform their ghastly surgery on the Priests, who are going insane from the procedure
red hot  is pulled out of a pit of burning coals
Priest's head is wedged between two strong boards
His eyes widen in terror as an Embalmer moves to insert the red hot poker up his nose
But just before he does,     ' , horrified, as  , the Priest
on the chamber
All twenty-one of Imhotep's Priests squirm inside their wrappings
Imhotep is forced to his knees
His arms are held back
His mouth is pried open
As for me,  was condemned to endure the -
The worst of all ancient curses
One so horrible, it had never before been bestowed
Using a pair of tongs, an Embalmer slowly pulls Imhotep's out of his mouth, then places a very sharp knife on top of it
on '  as his tongue is apparently cut out
The Embalmer flings Imhotep's tongue onto the floor
The Mumia's dogs attack and quickly eat it
Imhotep is
Only his mouth, nostrils and fearfilled eyes are left free of the slimy bandages
Detritus muck boils inside a black cauldron
Embalmers scoop out the fetid muck and apply it to Imhotep's wrappings as he squirms
He's then laid in a wooden  inside a stone
An Embalmer with a  steps up and looks into the coffin
Imhotep's wild eyes stare back
The Embalmer empties the bucket over Imhotep's chest: dozens of , disgusting dung beetles
They scurry across Imhotep's  face
Some vanish into his tongue-less mouth and up his nostrils
By eating the sacred scarabs,  would be cursed to stay alive forever
And by eating me, they were cursed just the same
The lid to the coffin is
Then, using a strange four-sided , the Head Mumia locks the coffin lid tight
The heavy sarcophagus lid is shoved into place and with a loud  seals itself airtight
Once again, the Head Mumia uses the strange key, locking the sarcophagus lid tight
was to remain sealed inside my sarcophagus, the undead for all of eternity
The blue-skinned, strangely tattooed man carefully collapses the sides of the key, -- turning it into a little puzzle They would never allow me to be released
For  would arise a walking disease, a plague upon mankind, an unholy flesh-eater, with the strength of ages, power over the sands, and the glory of invincibility
Imhotep's sarcophagus is dropped into a
The disgusting muck  up, drools down it-s sides, and then is mysteriously sucked into It's seams, vanishing clean
And if  could raise my beloved Anck- su-namun from her place in hell, together, we would be an unstoppable infection upon this world
The Apocalypse
The End
Imhotep's horrifying tongue-less  can be heard coming from inside his sarcophagus as grave diggers shovel dirt onto it
: The heavily armed Mumia stand guard around Imhotep's grave
Looking down on the burial site is the huge statue of , the jackal-headed god of death
It stares at us
Then begins to  before our very eyes, aging 4,159 years in only seconds
And then we find ourselves and the decrepit, half- buried statue of Anubis out in the middle of the desert

Armed to the teeth

His Kepi sits at a jaunty angle
Dashing and handsome
This is  '
He looks out at the massive  horde galloping at him

doughy little Frenchman joins him as he makes his way across the top of the wall
This is
Personally,  would like to surrender
Why can we not just surrender
' Shut-up and gimme your bandolier
Beni pulls off his cartridge belt
Hands it to 'Connell
Then let's run away
Right now
While we can still make it
'Connell throws it on, crisscrossing his own bandolier
' Now gimme your revolver, you'll never use it anyway
Beni pulls out his pistol and chucks it to 'Connell
Then let's play dead, huh
Nobody ever does that anymore
'Connell slides it into his belt, next to his own revolver ' Now go find me a big stick
In the desert
What for
'Connell turns and goes nose-to-nose with him
' So  can tie it to your back, you appear to be without a spine
The horde of warriors  forward
Now a half mile out
Scimitars
'Connell and Beni run through the ruins
' How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways
got caught robbing a synagogue
Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them
' Altar boys
Exactly
speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues
How about you
Kill somebody
Beni trips and accidentally tackles 'Connell to the ground
'Connell gives him a nasty look
' No, but 'm considering it
They get up and run out the gate and down the stone ramp What then
Robbery
Extortion
Kidnapping
' None of the above, thank you
Then what the hell are you doing here
They both skid to a stop at the front line as they see the horde of warriors
The  of   is deafening
'Connell gives Beni a big cheesy smile
' was just looking for a good time
And that's when the cowardly Legionnaire Colonel suddenly panics, cuts and runs
'Connell instantly stiffens
' Oh shit
Steady
Gives the men around him courage
But onward comes the horde Hoofs pounding the sand
Several more Legionnaires take off
' (to himself) What the hell am  sayin'
The Tuaregs let loose with those horrifying oooo-loo-loog More Legionnaires haul-ass
Beni is one of them
' (to himself) What the hell am  doin'
The Tuaregs set their rifles and take aim
'Connell steels himself, cocks and locks
The cartridge in his mouth suddenly snaps, he spits it into the sand
Another
And then -- ' The Legionnaires on the ground
The rifles report with a
The  blows dozens of Tuaregs clean off their mounts
The prone Legionnaires quickly begin to reload
' The kneeling Legionnaires
More Tuaregs bite the sand
The remaining warriors
and  rip the hot air
third of the Legionnaires are killed instantly
' The remaining standing Legionnaires
Tuaregs spin off their mounts
Crash to the sand
And then the entire Tuareg force plows into the ruins and through the Legionnaires
'Connell grabs the barrel of his rifle and starts riders off their steeds, fighting like a man possessed
Beni on the other hand, is bellycrawling across the sand, whimpering in full retreat as Legionnaires fall dead all around him
He crawls through the front gate
'Connell throws his rifle down and goes for his guns
He cross-draws, gun in each hand, starts blowing riders off their mounts
Beni crawls faster, and then he spots an open amongst the rocks
He gets up and sprints for the door as the last of the Legionnaires are shot off their feet behind him
'Connell's guns go empty
' Son-of-a-bitch
He turns and runs like hell, right through the front gate
Four Tuareg warriors on massive Arabians haul-ass after him
'Connell hurdles a stone column, hits the ground running
He spots Beni inside the Temple doorway, trying to close the heavy sandstone door
' Hey
Beni
Wait up
Beni has no intention of waiting up, he pushes harder
' What are ya doing
Wait up
'Connell runs faster
Beni pushes harder
The four Horsemen the big column and  after him
' Don't you close that door
' Beni closes the door just as 'Connell reaches it
'Connell his body into the door
It doesn't budge
' 'm gonna get you for this
He turns and bolts off around the rocks
Running for his life, weaving through the ruins
The Arabians getting closer and closer
The  hoofs getting  and
'Connell finally spins around and faces his attackers
The four massive horses crash to a stop in front of him
The vicious Tuaregs raise their rifles to finish him off
'Connell just stands there, exhausted and beaten, then he slowly lifts his right hand and gives them the bird
And that's when the horses go ape-shit
All four of them Two of the Riders are  to the ground
The horses  and  and  in fear, then buck like fury and haul-ass away as if the devil himself had scared them
The thrown Riders get up and race off after their mounts
'Connell just stands there, stunned, then he lifts his right hand and checks out his middle finger
And then he feels the evil himself, and turns around
-- The shattered, decrepit statue of Anubis stares back at him
Suddenly, the sand begins to shift under 'Connell's feet
He starts to back away, keeping his eyes on the transforming sand, it looks like huge snakes are wiggling and writhing beneath it, forming lines and shapes, -- drawing a picture
'Connell quickly turns and runs off through the ruins
The sand stops moving, and we can now see that, drawn in the sand, is a picture of '
- Up on a ridge,     watch 'Connell stumble clear of the decrepit city
'Connell feels their presence and looks up
Very different from the Tuaregs, they have and faces covered in strange -
The Mumia
Still watching Imhotep's grave after all this time
The   is a huge, fierce Man in black robes, with dual scimitars across his waist
His face is both handsome and horrible, blue and tattooed
Meet
His dark eyes watch 'Connell stagger off into the open desert
- Cairo, a city so old the stars have actually changed their positions in the sky since it's birth
city teeming with every form of life
strange, mysterious, wonderful city
it's name across the : - Deep in the bowels of the museum lie the
Rows upon rows of towering bookshelves
Filled with literature on the Antiquities
Standing at the top of a tall ladder between two of these rows and leaning against one of the bookshelves, is a rather uninteresting British : eye-glasses, hair-in- a-bun, long boring dress, your typical prudish nightmare
This is
We're going to fall in love with her
Evelyn pulls a book out from a stack under her arm, blows the dust off it, then places it on a shelf with other books whose titles all begin with the letter ""
Then she grabs another book out from under her arm and reads the title
Tuthmosis
Now how did you get up here
Carefully, so as not to lose her balance, she looks over her shoulder to the bookshelf behind her, where all the titles begin with the letter ""
Then she looks down
It's a long way to the bottom
Evelyn gently sets the other books down on the top shelf, then turns and gingerly starts to reach across the aisle with the Tuthmosis book
It's a little too far, so she stretches, reaching, holding the top of the ladder with her fingertips, she's almost got it, closer now closer
And that's when the ladder pulls away from the shelf
Evelyn , flings the Tuthmosis book and grabs the top of the ladder, which stands straight up
Evelyn holds her breath, swaying precariously, a long , and then she loses her balance, the ladder swings around and Evelyn starts stiltwalking down the aisle
The ladder crosses the aisle, does an about face and heads back the way it came
Evelyn clings to the top, struggling for balance
The ladder teeters out into the main aisle and picks up speed
Evelyn  as it does a 180, spins into another aisle and finally crashes to a stop at the top of a bookshelf
Evelyn holds her breath, then
And that's when the bookshelf falls away from her and into the next bookshelf
Evelyn slides down the ladder and plops to the floor
She looks up just as the domino effect kicks-in: each bookshelf crashing into the next
And onward it goes
Bookshelf after bookshelf
Thousands of volumes flinging off shelves and scattering across the floor
It finally ends as the last shelf  into a wall
Evelyn's eyes are closed
She opens one eye
Looks left
Then right
Then opens the other eye and stares at the huge mess
Oops
The Egyptian  storms in
Look at this
Sons of the Messiah
Give me frogs, flies, locusts, anything but this
Compared to you, the other plagues were a joy
Evelyn quickly gets up and starts gathering books
'm sorry, it was an accident
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident
You are a catastrophe
Why do  put up with you
Evelyn turns to him, trying to contain herself
You put up with me, because  can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and 'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library
Who needs smart women
put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls
Now straighten up this mess
The Curator storms out
Evelyn just stands there, steaming
And then she hears a  and quickly turns around
Hello
Quiet
Eerie
And then she hears it again, like feet, slowly shuffling across the floor, coming from a nearby gallery
Abdul
Mohammed
Bob
Evelyn walks through the stacks and enters -- Filled with treasures and plunder from the Middle Kingdom
It's very dark and quiet in here, the only  is from at either end of the spooky gallery
The  again
From the far side of the room
Feet, slowly shuffling, plodding across the floor
Evelyn grabs a torch
Looks around, at a statue of Anubis, another of Horus, they stare down at Evelyn, who is starting to get scared now
She walks down the aisle
Past a closed sarcophagus
Past cases of ancient artifacts
Past another sarcophagus, -- only this one is
Evelyn freezes, swallows hard, nervously looks around to see who could have opened it
Then she slowly leans forward with the torch, and peers inside
--  hideous rotted  sits up and  at her
Evelyn , drops the torch and backs away, scared out of her wits
And then, coming from inside the sarcophagus, she hears a Man
Her eyes narrow as a foppish cad crawls out from behind the Mummy, laughing his ass off, half drunk
You
Drunkard
Fool
Rat-bastard
Please call me something original
Meet
As he crawls out of the sarcophagus, Evelyn pulls a cigarette out of the mummy's mouth
Have you no respect for the dead
Right now,  only wish to join them
He grins drunkenly
Evelyn punches him hard in the chest
Well  wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours
My dear, sweet, baby sister, 'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note
He , then falls back and sits on the edge of a tomb
High note
Ha
For five years you've been scrounging around Egypt, and what have you to show for it
Nothing
Jonathan excitedly starts scrounging around in his jacket
Oh yes  do
have something right here
Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if  bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you
Jonathan pulls out a small, ancient ; the collapsed to Imhotep's sarcophagus and coffin
Evelyn is instantly curious, she grabs the box out of his hand
Where did you get this
Jonathan knows her weaknesses, gives her a mischievous smile
On a dig, down in Thebes
Evelyn rolls the box around in her hands, mumbling to herself as she translates the hieratics and hieroglyphs covering it
Jonathan licks his lips in anticipation
My whole life 've never found anything, Evy
Tell me 've found something
Evelyn's fingers play with the various little slats on the box, shifting them this way and that way, it's like a puzzle box
Then suddenly, it  , almost-mechanically, turning itself into the
Sitting inside the open key/box is a folded piece of
An
Jonathan
Yes
think you found something
'  - The Curator sits at his desk, staring through a jeweler's eyepiece at the key/box
Evelyn hovers behind him, excited
See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, 'm sure of it
Perhaps
Jonathan leans in from across the desk
Two questions
Who the hell is Seti the First
And was he rich
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all
Alright, good, that's good
like this fellow, like him very much
The Curator picks up the
It's actually the exact same map that we established in the opening scenes of the movie
've already dated it, this map is almost four thousand years old
And the hieratics over here
(Inhales deeply) It's Hamunaptra
The Curator freezes, suddenly very nervous, then he recovers
My dear girl, don't be ridiculous, we are scholars, not treasure hunters
Hamunaptra is a myth
Are we talking about the Hamunaptra
Yes
The City of The Dead
Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber
Everybody knows the story
The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand
On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch
And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes
All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 The Curator holds the map closer to the burning -
As the Americans would say: it's all fairy tales and hokum
The map 'accidentally,'
The Curator throws it to the floor
Jonathan drops to his knees and quickly puts it out
Lifts it up
The left third of the map is now missing
You burned it
You burned off the part with the lost city
It's for the best, 'm sure
Many men have wasted their lives in the foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra, no one has ever found it, most have never returned
(devastated) You killed my map
'm sure it was a fake, anyway, 'm surprised at you, Miss Carnarvon, to be so fooled
The Curator reaches for the key/box
Evelyn quickly snatches it off the desk and gives him a very angry, suspicious look
-   - Cairo prison
One of the worst hell holes on earth
Every low-life form of scumbag can be found here
The , a first rate scumbag himself, escorts Evelyn and Jonathan across the gallows courtyard
Evelyn whispers to Jonathan
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes
was mistaken
You lied to me
lie to everybody, what makes you so special
'm your sister
That just makes you more gullible
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah
Picked his pocket, actually
'  - The Warden ushers Evelyn and Jonathan into the holding pen
And what is he in prison for
did not know, so when  heard you were coming,  asked him that myself
And what did he say
He said
he was just looking for a good time
The interior cell door
'Connell is in chains, dragged by  , they shove him up to the cell bars
From the looks of it, he's been here awhile; his face is half hidden by long hair, a scraggly beard and many new bruises
Evelyn looks at him, disgusted by his appearance
But he's just a filthy criminal
(cringing) Way to go, Evy
'Connell gives Evelyn the once over, then looks at Jonathan
' So who's the broad
Broad
She's my sister, actually
' Yeah
Well,
'm sure she's not a total loss
Evelyn is stunned and furious
The Warden heads out the door
'll be back in a moment
' (sarcastic) tremble with anticipation
Guard  'Connell across the head, 'Connell's face bounces off the metal bars
He shows no pain, but just looks back and gives the Guard a nasty look
Evelyn steps closer
We uh,
found
your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it
' No
No
' No
You came to ask me about Hamunaptra
Evelyn and Jonathan quickly look around, hoping the guards didn't hear him
They step closer
Evelyn plays coy
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra
' Because that's where  found it was there
Evelyn is dumbstruck
But Jonathan looks suspicious How do we know that's not a load of pig swallow
'Connell looks closer at Jonathan, a glint of recognition
' Hey,
don't  know you
Um, well, you see
'Connell's  comes flying through the bars, hits Jonathan square in the jaw,
He hits the floor
Out cold Guard  'Connell
His head bounces off the bars again
He shows no pain, but gives the Guard another nasty look
Evelyn looks down at her brother, then back at 'Connell
You were actually at Hamunaptra
' just decked your brother Yes, well
(shrugs) know my brother
'Connell almost smiles
There's a bit of spark to this girl
' Yeah,  was there
You swear
' Every damn day
No,  mean -- ' --  know what you mean
was there, alright
Seti's place
The City Of The Dead
What did you find
What did you see
' found sand
saw death
The warden enters
Evelyn quickly leans closer to 'Connell
Could you tell me how to get there
The exact location
' Want to know
Evelyn leans in even closer
Yes
' Really want to know
She leans her face right up to the bars, nervous and excited Yes
'Connell steps forward and  her full on the lips
' Then get me the hell outta here
Evelyn is stunned
Guard  him, his face bounces off the bars again, but before he can react the Guards  him, him away from the bars and  him out of the room
Where are they taking him
To be hanged
Evelyn is shocked
The warden shows-off his green teeth
Apparently, he had a very good time
- Hundreds of filthy  stare down onto the gallows as the hangman's noose is draped over 'Connell's head and cinched tight around his neck
Evelyn follows the warden onto a balcony above the gallows
The prisoners all go dead quiet at the sight of her; like jackals staring at fresh meat
No women allowed
am an English woman
This seems to confuse the Warden, he shrugs and sits down
'Connell looks up as Evelyn plops down beside the Warden
will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life
would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang
Two hundred pounds
Proceed
Three hundred pounds
'Connell can hear every word, he looks hopeful
Other than Evelyn, you could hear a pin drop
The  turns to him
Any last requests, pig
' Yeah, 'd like ya to let me go
The Hangman grabs the lever to the trapdoor
The Warden sets his greasy, lecherous hand on Evelyn's leg
And what else
Evelyn is revolted, she quickly shoves his hand away
Insulted, the Warden angrily turns and gestures to the Hangman, who pulls the lever
The trapdoor
'Connell  through the hole
The rope pays out
Then 'Connell's body  at the end of the rope
But he's still alive, because -- His neck did not break
Good
Now we watch him strangle to death
The prisoners go ape-shit,  and  in anger
The  look around, nervous
'Connell struggles at the end of the rope, gagging
Evelyn is horrified, she quickly turns to the warden, leans forward and whispers in his ear
He knows the location to Hamunaptra
The warden spins around and faces her
You lie
would never
At the end of the rope, 'Connell is choking and gagging and turning several shades of red
The Warden stares at Evelyn
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead
Truly
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent
Fifty percent
Twenty
Forty
Evelyn hesitates, bites her lip
'Connell's eyes bulge as he looks up at her, he can't believe this girl
' Give
give him
give him -- Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more
The warden flashes a big green smile, then  in Arabic
scimitar  the air
The rope is
'Connell to the ground
Half dead
Rolls over
All of the prisoners
'Connell looks up at Evelyn
She smiles broadly and waves down at him
'  - across the Curator's face
She must die
Standing in the shadows across from his desk are  : blue tinted skin, hideous facial tattoos, -- the works
One of the Mumia has a rusty metal  for a hand
He shrugs
She is like all the others
She will die in the desert
No
She has seen too much
She knows too much
The Curator leans across his desk, fear in his eyes
Not only does she have a map, but she has the key
Spooks the hell out of the Mumia guys
The key
She has the lost key
Yes
No one has ever had so much, been so close
We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her
And burn the map and retrieve the key
It will be done
But what of the American expedition
They leave tomorrow as well
Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others
Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra
- : our old traitorous friend
It is three days down the Nile, then two days by camel, sahibs
: to reveal Beni standing on the bow of a Surrounded by ,  and
For all the money we're paying you, something better god-damned well be under that sand
: as Henderson slaps Daniels on the back
"Hamunaptra," Daniels, that's all ya gotta keep sayin, to yourself, "Hamunaptra
" Now we see all of  : Team of explorers swarm the docks
Across the Nile, the  spike the sky
Evelyn and Jonathan walk along the boardwalk besieged by selling everything from toy tombs to King Tut action figures
Do you really think he'll show up
Undoubtedly,  know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word
Personally,  think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel don't like him one bit
' (
) Anyone  know
They both turn
'Connell walks up; shaved, showered, spit and polished, with a new haircut and clothes
He looks more dashing and handsome than ever
Evelyn is suitably impressed
Oh
um,
hello
Jonathan grabs 'Connell's arm and shakes his hand
Smashing day for the start of an adventure, eh, 'Connell
'Connell quickly checks his pockets
' Yeah, sure, smashing
He finds his wallet and relaxes
: on the bow of the barge, Burns wipes his bifocals and turns to Beni
You're sure Hamunaptra is out there
Along with the scorched bones of my entire garrison, sahib
And that's when Beni spots 'Connell
Beni shakes his head, as if seeing a mirage, then starts backing away from the men
thousand pardons, my good sahibs but there is much work to be done
Beni quickly scurries off, vanishing down into the hold
: Evelyn, recovering, she clears her throat
Mister 'Connell, can you look me in the eye, and guarantee me this is not some sort of flimflam
Because if it is, 'm warning you -- 'Connell steps up close to Evelyn, invading her space looks her straight in the eye
Evelyn doesn't back away
' All  can tell you, miss, is that my Colonel found that map in an ancient fortress, and the whole damn garrison believed in it so much, that without orders, we marched halfway across Libya and into Egypt to find that city
Like  told ya, all  saw was sand
Everybody else was wiped out by Tuareg warriors
'll take your bags
'Connell takes her bags and heads up the gangplank and onto the same passenger barge that Beni and the Americans are on
Evelyn's eyes follow him, a bit wistfully
Jonathan sees it
Yes, yes, you're right, filthy, rude, a complete scoundrel, nothing to like there at all
Evelyn gives him a look
Jonathan just grins
And that's when the warden suddenly brushes past, tipping his raggedy hat
bright good morning to all
What are you doing here
have come to protect my investment, thank you very much
And up the plank he goes
Evelyn and Jonathan share a look
: as the barge pulls out and heads down the Nile
: to the , which then  into -- - The , shining down on the desert
The quietly glide a narrow skiff out onto the river
The one with the hook sits in the middle of the skiff, the other two row, heading for the   coming their way
- Jonathan and the three Americans are playing poker
'Connell comes out a door carrying a -
Sit down, 'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player
' only gamble with my life, never my money
Never
What if  were to wager five hundred dollars says we get to Hamunaptra before you
'Connell returns Daniel's cocky look
' Yer on
Burns slips on his dirty bifocals
What makes you so confident, sir
' What makes you
Henderson spits a wad of chew into a spittoon
We got us a man who's actually been there
'Connell's poker face drops, perplexed
Same with Jonathan
say, what a coincidence, why -- 'Connell 'accidentally' hits him in the ribs with the gunnysack, shutting him up
Jonathan quickly covers
-- whose deal is it
Is it my deal
thought  just dealt
- Evelyn sits on a table, staring out over the passing river
The gunny-sack  onto the table, startling her
' Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya
The only thing that scares me, Mister 'Connell, are your manners
' Still angry that  kissed ya, huh
If you call that a kiss
'Connell reaches into the gunny-sack and starts pulling out revolvers, pistols, hunting knives, a massive elephant gun, and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite
Did  miss something
Are we going into battle
' The last time  was at that place everybody  was with died
This takes the smile off Evelyn's face
'Connell starts dismantling and cleaning the guns
' There's something out there, you know, something under that sand
Yes, 'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure
What do you think is out there
'Connell looks into Evelyn's eyes
' Evil
The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell
" Ahmar is Ossirion
"Passageway to the underworld", actually
She gives him a know-it-all grin
don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister 'Connell, but  do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living
It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child
It's why  came here, sort of a life's pursuit
' And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right
Evelyn is surprised by his knowledge
You know your history
' know my treasure
Evelyn gets up to go, then she hesitates, nervous, she turns back to 'Connell, and as matter-of-fact as possible says: By the way,
why did you kiss me
'Connell, cleaning his guns, just shrugs his shoulders
' was about to be hanged, seemed like a good idea at the time
Evelyn's eyes widen, furious, she turns and storms off
'Connell looks up, watching her leave, a bit perplexed
' What
Wha'd  say
Then he hears someone  under the table
He quickly reaches down, grabs that someone and lifts him up
It's Beni
My very good friend
What a surprise
' Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni
oughta kill you
'Connell sticks a knife under Beni's throat
Beni swallows hard, then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin
You never were any good with the ladies, 'Connell
' So you're the one leading the Americans,  shoulda figured
So what's the scam
You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot
Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when  get them back to Cairo, so  must go all the way
'Connell pulls the knife away
Beni relaxes, rubs his neck
You never believed in Hamunaptra, 'Connell
Why are you going back
The devil himself lives out there
They look as they hear Evelyn
single  in the takes another bite at her
She  again and backs away
'Connell grins as Evelyn flees down the deck
' The girl saved my life, figured it was the least  could do, keep her out of trouble
You always did have more balls than brains
'Connell's eyes narrow at the insult, he looks back at Beni
' Let's make us even, shall we
Even
'Connell grabs him and chucks him over the side of the barge
Beni  into the river
'Connell takes his gunny-sack and starts walking off down the deck
(
) 'Connell
am going to kill you for this
' Sounds familiar
And that's when he spots     , coming up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck
'Connell quickly looks around, immediately on the alert
'  - Evelyn, wearing a nightgown, stands in front of a mirror
She gives her head a good shake, letting her hair fall loose over her bare shoulders
Then she turns around, It's Hook
He slams his hand over her mouth and lifts up his hook, ready to strike
Where is the map
Evelyn's terrified eyes glance down
Hook looks over, sees the map lying next to a flickering candle on a nearby table
And the key
Where is the key
Evelyn's eyes look confused
She shakes her head
Hook grins
Then 'll find it myself
He cocks his hook, about to kill her
And that's when the door is
'Connell  , gun in each hand
Hook spins Evelyn around and holds her out in front of him
'Connell looks at her
' Friend of yours
Evelyn's eyes widen
And that's when the candle on the table Everything happens at once,  : 'Connell spins around just as a window
Mumia leans in
Woodchips   the wall next to 'Connell's head
He returns
Kills the Mumia
The Mumia falls back
in the room is
Kerosene across the wall
Evelyn grabs the candle on the table and   back over her shoulder, right into Hook's
He  in pain and lets her go
'Connell grabs her and  her out of the
- 'Connell pulls Evelyn down the hall, she tries to jerk free
The map
We need the map
He shoves her up against a wall
' Relax
'm the map
(taps his forehead) It's all up here
Oh that's comforting
'Connell gives her a look, then pulls her forward
' 'mon, there's still one more of those guys around here somewhere
'   - Hot melted wax covers Hook's face as he holds his sore eye and struggles to the door
Then he notices the key/box on the floor
He bends over to pick it up
And that's when the door is   again, it hits him in the ass and knocks him into the fire
Jonathan leans in
Sees nothing but flames
Then he sees the key/box on the floor and picks it up suddenly snatches the key/box away from him
Hey that's mine -- It's Hook
His backside is now
He lifts his pistol
Jonathan quickly backpedals out the door as Hook
- 'Connell and Evelyn race out onto the deck near the horse paddock
People are  and , lots of panic
chunk of the wall is   next to Evelyn's head
'Connell pivots and
It's the last Mumia, on the other side of the paddock
He and 'Connell exchange
Another
'Connell   the paddock lock
The horses go nuts
'Connell  over their heads
They   and  through the door
The Mumia  as the horses  over him
sweep up the walls and race across the roof
Half the barge is now 'Connell throws the gunny-sack over his shoulder
' Can you swim
Well of course  can swim, if the occasion calls for it
' Trust me
He picks her up and throws her over the side
' The occasion calls for it
Evelyn  into the water
'Connell dives in after her
- Jonathan runs out onto the bow, sees the three Americans, guns in every hand, fanning their pistols,  everything in sight
Jonathan just shakes his head
Americans
Hook suddenly stumbles up behind him, -- now a
Jonathan turns around, Hook grabs him by the throat with his and pins him to the cabin wall
Jonathan's eyes widen as he sees a hook rising up inside the  about to strike him
The Americans pivot and
Blows Hook over the railing
Jonathan turns to the Americans and smiles
say
Good show
Then he points his thumb at himself And did  panic
He lifts up his other hand, -- he has the key/box back
think not
And that's when the horses  onto the bow
Jonathan dives over one side, the three Americans dive over the other
- 'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden wade out of the water
Evelyn's nightgown clings tight to her body as she wrings it out
She looks good
'Connell notices
Everybody else, including the horses, is getting out on the far shore 'Connell spots Beni running up to the Americans
Hey 'Connell
Looks to me like got all the horses
' Hey Beni
Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river
Beni looks up at the stars, then angrily  the sand The  barge drifts off, slowly sinking
- 'Connell barters in  with a   at a trading post
Jonathan forks over some cash
The Trader hands them the reins of four ugly old camels
can't believe the price of these fleabags
' We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it
' Awfully
And that's when Evelyn steps out of a trading tent
She's changed into a gorgeous, tightly fitted, Bedouin dress
' Then again
- 'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the warden are on camels in the middle of the frying pan; the endless, sunbaked Sahara
Never did like camels
Filthy buggers
They smell, they bite, they spit
Disgusting
The warden savagely attacks a chicken wing with his vile green teeth
Flies buzz around his head
He sucks at his gums, then spits out some gristle
'Connell watches him
' Yeah, disgusting
Evelyn is having the time of her life on top of her camel
Well  think they're cute
: showing the majesty of the desert, and our heroes getting deeper and deeper into it
- The  shines down an four lone camel rider's trekking across the vast wasteland
Jonathan is sound asleep, his head bobbing comically to the rhythm of his camel
On the camel next to him, the Warden Up in front of them, Evelyn slowly starts to slide off her saddle
'Connell reaches over and stops her, then gently pushes her back up onto her saddle, never waking her
For a long moment, his eyes watch Evelyn, and then he looks up at a distant ridge -- -- where Ardeth Ray and a group of   are pacing them
-   - The dawning sun hasn't yet crested the distant horizon as Jonathan and the Warden ride alongside a giant sand dune
And you snore
do not snore
All night you snored
have never snored
Up in front of them, 'Connell looks at Evelyn
' We're almost there
Are you sure
'Connell looks down at the ground
' Pretty sure
The others look down and see    sticking out of the ground
Bleached and eaten away
Some of the skeletons look like they're trying to crawl up out of the desert floor
What in bloody hell is this
The Warden shivers in fear
Other seekers of Hamunaptra
The American Expedition rides out from behind the far end of the dune
The Americans are accompanied by and an Arab
Beni rides lead on a camel, the rest ride horses
Good morning, my friend
'Connell just nods
The two parties come to a stop a hundred feet apart
'Connell turns and stares out across the endless horizon
Beni does likewise
The Americans look puzzled
Well, what the hell we doin'
Patience, my good sahib, patience
Henderson looks over at 'Connell
First one to the city, 'Connell
Five hundred
Cash bucks
'Connell and Beni just stare out at the flat nothingness
Evelyn and Jonathan share a look
And then, the  starts to rise in the distance, breaking the flat horizon
' Get ready
Evelyn can feel the suspense and the majesty of the moment
For what
' We're about to be shown the way
Far off to the right, a   begins to rise with the sun
'Connell and Beni watch it, expressionless
Daniels, Henderson and Burns share a look, and then -- // The Americans take off
Racing towards the rising volcano
, '
Evelyn and Jonathan give 'Connell anxious, sarcastic looks
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet
'Connell doesn't say a word, staring hard
Beni watches the Americans and spits into the sand
Fools
And then suddenly, the volcano
Passing across the sun as it goes
It's a
The Americans crash their horses to a stop and race the other way, after the volcano
Evelyn and Jonathan smile, amazed
The volcano  , floating across the watery horizon
The Americans crash to a stop again and chase after the volcano
All three of them confused and
'Connell and Beni just stare, waiting
The volcano
And the Americans crash to a stop again
Burns is  from his horse
Henderson angrily rips his hat off and chucks it to the ground
Daniels just curses as they give up the chase
The volcano comes to a stop on the far left of the horizon
The Americans are on the far right
Nothing moves
And then 'Connell grins
So does Beni
They share a look
And then  their camels and
Everybody else hauls-ass after them
'Connell and Beni are neck-and-neck
And then Evelyn comes galloping up, hair flying in the wind
Beni takes out his camel whip and starts  'Connell
Trying to knock him off his camel
once
Twice
But on the third try 'Connell grabs the whip and  Beni off his camel
Beni  to the ground and
Evelyn and 'Connell race across the desert
Evelyn has never felt so alive
She
'Connell grins; he likes this girl
Beni stumbles to his feet, then quickly dances out of the way as Jonathan and all the other riders stampede past him
Evelyn beats 'Connell to the stone ramp, racing hard
' Evelyn
Slow down
Evelyn ignores him as she races up the ramp towards the gate
' ,
' -- - Evelyn goes ass-over-teacups through the air and crash lands in a sand dune
She sits up, stunned, sandy hair in her eyes
'Connell stops at the edge of the ramp next to her camel
' Never mind
The Americans ride up and look in wonder at the ruins inside the volcano
'Connell gives them a big, shit-eating grin
' You boys owe me five hundred dollars
- Under the guidance of the Egyptologist, the Diggers are busy hauling rock and dirt out of the Temple doorway
The three Americans are playing poker
Beni smokes a hookah and swats flies
Dozens of stray  roam the decrepit city; dusty backpacks and old saddlebags still slung over their humps
Where'd all these camels come from
They belong to the dead
They will wait years for their masters to return before leaving
- 'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden are working next to a narrow , which weaves it's way through the ruins
'Connell ties a rope around a pillar and throws the rest of the coils into the crevice, about to rappel down
Jonathan bends over to have a look, his ass hits something, he and backs away
It's the decrepit
That thing gives me the creeps
' Be nice
That thing saved my life
Evelyn is positioning ancient  along the crevice
That "thing" gets me excited
' (sarcastic) The things that get you excited
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living
' What are those mirrors for
Ancient Egyptian trick
You'll see
'Connell shrugs, then rappels down into the crevice
'  - 'Connell waves a  as Jonathan, Evelyn and the warden drop down next to him
Evelyn peers into the spooky darkness
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years
Who cares
don't see no treasure
' You're welcome to my share of the spider webs
And it stinks to high heaven in here
Evelyn just rolls her eyes
Cretins
Jonathan sniffs the foul air, then he looks at the warden and realizes where the smell is coming from
He stops sniffing
Evelyn brushes  away from a   on the wall, then repositions it on it's pedestal, aiming it at a shining in from the outer mirrors
-- It's the embalmer's chamber
' That is a neat trick
Oh my god, It's a preparation room
' Preparation for what
For entering the afterlife
'Connell quickly draws his gun
Jonathan gently nudges him
Mummies, my good son, this is where they made the mummies
Evelyn heads down a narrow passageway
The others follow
- 'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch as they make their way through a narrow,
The short, squat warden can stand straight up
Then they hear something and freeze
It sounds like somebody is clawing inside the walls
They share looks
Then slowly move forward
Getting darker and darker as they go
The strange sound getting louder and louder
And then it stops
Evelyn holds her breath
Jonathan licks his lips
'Connell cocks his pistol
The warden
'Connell, Jonathan and Evelyn glare at him
'  - They slowly creep out of the labyrinth and up to the foot of an enormous half-buried statue
The lower half of Anubis
Then they hear the sound again, coming closer now, from the other side of the statue
And closer
'Connell pulls Evelyn behind him
And closer
'Connell raises his gun
And
'Connell
-- 'Connell
But doesn't pull the trigger because it's just the Americans, their guns are up, cocked and aimed
Ya scared the bejeezus out of us, 'Connell
' Likewise
But nobody lowers their guns
Daniels grins, the tough one
This here is our statue,
friend
' Don't see your name on it,
pal
And that's when Beni, five Diggers and the Egyptologist step out of the shadows, -- all holding guns aimed at 'Connell
Ten to one, 'Connell, your odds are no-so-good
' 've had worse
Jonathan clenches a tiny derringer
Yes, me too
'Connell gives him a sideways glance
Beni cocks his gun, grinning, he wants it to happen
The tension thickens
Then Evelyn gently takes 'Connell's gun hand and pulls it down
Let's be nice, children, if we're going to play together, we must learn to share
Evelyn pulls 'Connell away
Jonathan and the Warden follow
Beni and the Americans slowly lower their guns, laughing
The Egyptologist excitedly begins translating the hieroglyphs
'  - 'Connell and Jonathan are using sledge-hammers against the ceiling
Evelyn is gently chipping away with a tiny chisel
According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue
We'll come up right between his legs
(she blushes and laughs) Oh my
And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep -- (looks at 'Connell) No offense
' None taken
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them
' And you're sure you can find the secret compartment
Yes, if their Egyptologist hasn't already found it
Jonathan looks around
say, what's our smelly little friend got himself up to
- The Warden crawls into a   and
mural wall comes alive
Embedded into it are dozens of black amethyst ; glittering images of the sacred beetles
Awestruck, the Warden pulls out a pocket knife and starts prying away at one of the precious bugs
'  - Beni and the Americans hover around the Egyptologist, who's found the   inside Anubis
The Egyptologist brushes sand away from the seam
Henderson steps forward and grabs the seam, -- the Egyptologist quickly stops him
Seti was no fool
Henderson sees the intense look in the Egyptologist's eyes Yeah, sure
He looks back at the native Diggers
We'll let him open it
The Egyptologist nods, then    at the Diggers
The Diggers hesitate, filled with fear
Daniels pulls out his gun, aims it at three of the Diggers
The three Diggers hesitantly step forward with crowbars and stick them into the seams
The other Diggers back away, scared shitless
Beni and the Americans exchange looks, and then they back away as well
'  - Three Heroes are still digging into the ceiling ' Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils
That's really got to hurt
It's called mummification
You're dead when they do this Still
' Yeah, that'd bring you back to life
You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys
And that's when a huge chunk of the roof suddenly
'Connell  Evelyn and  her clear
Jonathan for the far wall to the floor
Fills the room
' Having heard the crash, Beni and the Americans have their guns pointed at the floor
The Egyptologist could care less, he looks at the Diggers, gripping their crowbars, and  -- The three Diggers
The ancient seams start to give, The Egyptologist  again
The Diggers
The compartment starts to loosen
Again he
The Diggers give one final pull and -- -- They
Dying horribly
by the time they hit the ground
'  - The dust is starting to clear
'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan slowly get up and step over to the massive stone casement
We immediately recognize it as '
Oh my god,
it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus
' Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling
They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis
He was either someone of great importance
Or he did something very naughty
- The warden drops an amethyst-scarab into his pouch, then greedily starts prying away at another
It rips off, he drops it into his pouch, -- only he misses, and this scarab quietly falls to the sandy floor without the Warden noticing
: the scarab on the floor
It begins to
The amethyst starts to glow
Something inside starts to ; as if the amethyst were some sort of strange cocoon
Then it splits open and a real live hideous scurries out
It races over to the warden's shoe, quickly burrows into the leather and vanishes inside
The Warden's eyes
He starts to , drops his knife and frantically starts clawing away at his pant leg, higher and higher until he rips open his shirt revealing a large, hideous , '
The Warden claws and scratches at it, trying to stop it
The lump
The Warden starts  and And then the scarab-lump
'  - Our Heroes clear the dirt off the top of the sarcophagus, revealing a single, ominous hieroglyph
Evelyn stares at it Jonathan impatiently strums his fingers across the lid
Well
Who is it
Evelyn stares at the hieroglyph, confused and concerned
'He that shall not be named
' 'Connell dusts off the huge ' There's some sort of lock here
You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out
' No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing, key
That's it
That's what he was talking about
' Who was talking about what
Evelyn starts rummaging through the pack on Jonathan's back
The man on the barge
The one with the hook, he was looking for a key
Evelyn pulls out the key/box
Jonathan tries to take it back
Hey that's mine
Evelyn slaps his hand and quickly unfolds the box, -- it's now shaped exactly like the '
Evelyn smiles
And that's when they hear the Warden's  echoing through the labyrinth
All three of them turn and take-off running
- The Warden is  and dancing insanely around the labyrinth, totally freaked from the extreme pain in his head
'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan run up just as the Warden starts  his own hair out of his head
'Connell and Jonathan grab at the Warden's hands, but he's far too crazed, he shoves them aside, runs full bore down the length of the labyrinth and  his head straight into a rock wall
The Warden drops to the ground
Dead as lead
Eyes wide open
'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan just stand there staring, breathing hard, wide-eyed themselves
- Evelyn and Jonathan are nuzzled up to a campfire
What do you suppose killed him
Did you ever see him eat
'Connell comes up over some rocks
' Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed
How
' Salt acid
Pressurized salt acid
Some sort of ancient booby-trap
Maybe this place really is cursed
blows through the camp
The campfire  'Connell and Jonathan share a nervous look
Evelyn laughs
You two
' You don't believe in curses, huh
No
believe if  can see it and can touch it, then it's real
That's what  believe
'Connell cocks his rifle, -
Gives her a big grin
' believe in being prepared
Jonathan opens the Warden's , the one that held the scarabs
He reaches in, starts scrounging around Waiting for the attack
And then, -- Jonathan  in pain and  his hand back out of the pouch
'Connell and Evelyn both jump
'/ Jonathan sucks his finger, then reaches back into the pouch and pulls out a  , the top has been chipped off
Seagrams
Jonathan smiles at the bottle, then turns the pouch inside out and shakes it, nothing but  is inside it
Well, he may have been a stinky fellow,
but he had good taste
Jonathan takes a swig
'Connell and Evelyn laugh, guiltily And then 'Connell suddenly kneels down and sticks his ear to the sand
Evelyn and Jonathan watch him
And then a      coming from the American camp
'Connell jumps up and throws the elephant gun to Evelyn
' Stay here
He takes off running through the ruins
Evelyn immediately gets up and runs after him
Jonathan grabs a gun, holds the bottle of Seagrams; tight and dashes after her
Evy
Excuse me
But didn't the man just say --
- The American camp is under siege
Two dozen gallop through
Several Diggers are killed as they run
The Americans leap out of their tents
Kill multiple Riders
Daniels is shot, spins and falls, keeps Henderson and Burns run to his aid,
'Connell races through the ruins and  right into Beni, who is obviously trying to high-tail-it out of there
' Goin' somewhere
Just looking for you, 'Connell wanted to be with my friend
'Connell drags him back towards the American camp
' 'mon, friend
(struggling) Why do you like to fight so much
' 'Cause  look good doin, it
Ardeth Ray gallops through the camp, cutting Diggers down with his scimitar
'Connell runs up on top of some rocks, and  him off his horse
The two men  to the ground
'Connell spins up onto one knee and , point blank
Blows the scimitar out of Ardeth Ray's hand
'Connell is about to shoot again when a horse rides up between them
scimitar swoops down, almost takes 'Connell's head off, misses him by an inch
'Connell leaps up and blows the Rider off his mount
The horse
-- But Ardeth Ray is gone
Evelyn hides behind some rocks, watching the scene, suddenly, she hears something coming up behind her and spins around
vicious tattooed Mumia Rider races at her
Evelyn quickly backpedals over the rocks, terrified
The Mumia Rider raises his scimitar, about to strike
Evelyn , trips over a rock and  the elephant gun, --
Blows the Rider off his mount and him twenty feet back into some ruins
At the same time, the kick blows Evelyn off her feet and over a ridge
She  through the air and lands in a sand dune
Jonathan and some Diggers are holding their own near the temple door
Four Riders come  right at them
Jonathan takes a swig off the Seagrams
Let 'em have it, boys
Jonathan and the Diggers
When the smoke clears, the Riders are either dead or gone
Jonathan grins
say, bloody good show
And then several more Mumia leap off the temple and land behind them
Jonathan and the remaining Diggers spin around and suddenly find themselves in hand-to-hand combat
'Connell is quickly loading his pistol
He hears something behind him
He spins around just as Ardeth Ray on a horse swings his scimitar
'Connell instinctively raises his hands to protect his face, the scimitar
Hits his gun, --
'Connell's gun flips away
Disarmed, 'Connell dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick of dynamite in his hand
He shoves the fuse into a fire
It He faces Ardeth Ray, towering above him
The two men lock eyes
The fuse continues to burn down
Ardeth Ray points his scimitar at 'Connell's head
Ardeth Ray
The remaining Mumia Riders race after him, vanishing into the night
'Connell watches them leave, then turns to the burning fuse,
and blows it out
Evelyn staggers up, looking very shaken
'Connell gently takes her and holds her close
' You alright
Evelyn looks up into his strong eyes
It's the first time he's shown genuine concern for her
And she likes it
He's also holding her a little too close
And she likes that too
Yes,
fine,
thank you
Beni crawls out from under some pillars as Henderson and Burns help Daniels to his feet
See
That proves it
Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand
For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there
'Connell looks up into the surrounding ridges, unsatisfied
' These men are a desert people
They value water, not gold
Evelyn looks at 'Connell, suddenly very worried
Where's Jonathan
- Jonathan falls into
Hits the ground
Eyes wide open
Mouth agape
Clearly dead
And then his eyes close and his mouth widens into a goofy smile
Shit-faced drunk
'Connell and Evelyn laugh, both half-in-the-bag themselves, the bottle of Seagrams is almost gone
'Connell offers the bottle to Evelyn, she waves it away, slurring badly -- Unlike my brother, sir,  know when to say no
'Connell polishes off the bottle and chucks it away
' Unlike your brother, Miss, you don't get
You're a whole new brew
know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this
' Something like that
Egypt is in my blood
My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian
My mother
Who was quite an adventurer herself ' Okay,  get your father,  get your mother and  get your brother, but what are you doing here
Evelyn is insulted, she staggers to her feet
may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter
Mister 'Connell But 'm proud of what  am
' And what is that
Evelyn plops back down beside him, really drunk, she grins and proudly lifts her head high
am a librarian
She leans in, very close to his face, looks him in the eyes, 'm going to kiss you, Mister 'Connell
' No you're not
'm not
' Not unless you call me Rick
Why would  do that
' Because that's my name
She gives him a goofy smile
He leans forward and Evelyn's eyes slowly close
And then she passes out, slumping into his arms
'Connell looks down at her, and just smiles
'  - Evelyn's  slips the  into the sarcophagus, lock and turns it
series of  -  are heard, and then the sarcophagus unlocks with a
'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan all look very, very hungover
They start to slide the heavy lid off the sarcophagus
,  and , the lid budging, inch by inch
can't believe  allowed the two of you to get me drunk
Don't blame me,  don't even remember being there
Well neither do , thank you
'Connell gives her a hurt look
' You don't
Evelyn gives 'Connell a nervous look
No
Why
Should
' Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had
'Connell gives her a big cheesy smile
Evelyn's face drops, appalled and embarrassed
And that's when the lid and   to the ground
All three of them instantly grab their sore heads and
'  - Several fear-filled, sweaty-faced Diggers reach into the secret compartment
Henderson and Burns hold guns on them
Daniels has his arm in a sling
The Diggers slowly pull out the
They set the chest down on the sandy floor
Beni watches as the Egyptologist translates the hieratics
There is a curse upon this chest
Curse my ass
Yeah, who cares
The Egyptologist gives them the evil-eye In these hallowed grounds, that which was set forth in ancient times, is as strong today, as it was then
Yeah, yeah, okay, what's it -- The Egyptologist slowly and carefully reads the inscription: "Death will come on swift wings to whomever opens this chest"
blows through the chamber All the Diggers suddenly turn tail and run off
The Americans look at each other, suddenly very nervous
It says, there is one, the undead, who if brought back to life, is bound by sacred law to consummate this curse
Yeah, well, let's just make sure we don't bring anybody back from the dead then, huh
The three Americans laugh
He will kill all who open this chest,
and assimilate their organs and fluids
Assimilate their organs and fluids
Ya mean eat 'em
And in so doing he will regenerate
And no longer be the undead, but a plague upon this earth
The
Torches
Beni and the Egyptologist share a fear-filled look
Henderson just shrugs
Ah hell, let's open it anyways
'  - Imhotep's wooden coffin is  to the ground next to his stone sarcophagus
Evelyn is very excited
Oh my god, 've dreamed about this ever since  was a little girl
' You dream about dead guys
Evelyn just gives him a look, then starts brushing dirt and cobwebs off the top of the coffin
Then she freezes
Look, all the sacred spells have been chiseled off
The hieratics and hieroglyphs that protect the deceased on his journey into the afterlife, they've been removed
This man was cursed,
doomed
'Connell and Jonathan are too excited to care
' Tough break
Yes, 'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we
Evelyn can't believe these guys
Jonathan inserts the key/box into the coffin's lock
Turns it
The lid cracks open with a They all react to the
Then 'Connell grabs the lid
It's stuck
He pulls with all his might
Jonathan helps him
It starts to give way
Slowly
Slowly
Slooooowly
And then it suddenly   and   , ,
'// They all jump back
Scared to death
Imhotep is now the 'Elephant Man' of corpses; twisted and deformed
The years have not been kind
He slumps back into his coffin
'  - Henderson and Daniels start to pry at the lid of the wooden chest
Beni and the Egyptologist watch
In the background, Beni starts backing away, filled with fear, sweating buckets
The curse,
beware the curse
Beni turns and bolts from the chamber
Daniels spits
Stupid superstitious bastard
And that's when the seal breaks, -- Everybody vanishes into the strange cloud
'  - 'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan slowly creep forward and carefully look back inside Imhotep's coffin, creeped-out
' Is he supposed to look like that
No
've never seen a mummy look like this
He's, he's still
Juicy
Yes
He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing
' And look at this
'Connell points at the inside of the  , where there are   and   all over the inside
Oh my god, he was buried alive
This sends a chill through everyone
Evelyn leans in closer
And he left a message
on a grouping of hieratics
It says: 'Death is only the beginning
' Jonathan shivers
'Connell looks around
' Where's my gun
What are you going to do
Shoot him
' If he decides to wake up, hell yes
'  - The vapor is settling
The Americans have their guns aimed at the chest
The Egyptologist slowly steps up, reaches inside, and lifts out a heavy burlap bag
Everyone's eyes widen in excitement as he sticks his hand into the bag and slowly pulls out the black    , the same book Imhotep used in his attempt to bring Anck-su-namun back to life
have heard told of this book, but never truly believed it existed
This, good gentlemen, is a most priceless treasure
Henderson kicks the sandy floor in anger
wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon
Yeah
It's supposed to be made outta pure gold
Daniels kicks the chest
It breaks open, unfolding to reveal a lower compartment
Inside, are Anck-su-namun's (one is shattered and without jewels) - The two camps have now joined together
'Connell and Beni are roasting chunks of hairy meat over a fire
Jonathan wrinkles his nose, disgusted by the smell
What is this stuff
It smells like our late friend, the Warden
'Connell and Beni both grin
Jonathan looks horrified
You did not
We're not
' Rat gizzards
They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer
The gloating Americans sit down, fondling their jeweled jars
Say 'Connell, whadaya think these honey's'll fetch back home
We hear you gentlemen found yerselves a nice gooey mummy
Congratulations
Ya know if ya dry him out, you can sell him for firewood
The Americans laugh
Evelyn walks up, sits down and drops a pile of big dusty   onto the ground
Scarabs, flesh eaters,  found them inside our friend's coffin
They can stay alive for years living off the flesh of a corpse, or in this case
She shrugs, then looks at the roasting meat Famished
'Connell and Jonathan stare at the bug skeletons, disgusted
' Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive
Very slowly
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him
' Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter
According to my readings, our friend suffered the -, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers
In all of my research, 've never read of this curse actually having been performed
' That bad huh
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so
It's written, that if a victim of the - should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt
' The ten plagues
You mean all ten plagues
Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy
That's one way of putting it
Let's see, there was frogs, flies, locusts
Hail and fire
The sun turning black
Water turning to blood
And my personal favorite: people covered in boils and sores
All the men share nervous looks, really spooked
Evelyn just laughs at them, then pulls a meat stick out of the fire
Fried gizzard anyone
- Having just freshened up for bed, Evelyn exits the temple and steps past the sleeping Diggers
She spots the Egyptologist, his jeweled canopic jar snug under one arm, the Book Of The Dead laying loose under the other
Evelyn stares at the Book, nervously biting her lip, then she sneaks over, carefully steals it, and quickly tip-toes away
Lying on some blankets by the campfire, 'Connell rolls over and sees Evelyn, sitting wide-eyed, staring at the Book
' You sure you outta be playin, around with that
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book
Evelyn opens the cover
She and 'Connell share a nervous look, then Evelyn shrugs and starts reading
Ahm kum Ra
Ahm kum Dei
Evelyn continues
'  - Evelyn's  is  as    on Imhotep's chamber and    on his sarcophagus over the lip of the coffin, then closer and closer towards Imhotep's rotten, twisted head, until his putrid face fills , -- and then suddenly his crusty eyelids Pop
Revealing
--
- The Egyptologist sits bolt upright
Quickly looks around, sees Evelyn reading the Book
He gets up and runs for her
He skids to a stop as a strange, piercing  is heard, coming from out in the desert
'Connell and the others all leap to their feet
The Americans run out of their tents
The  gets  and
And then from out of the darkness a      into camp and envelops everyone
'Connell grabs Evelyn, and with Jonathan at their side they race for the crevice, trying to fend off the horrid vermin as they go
Beni and the Americans run for the temple
The Egyptologist is covered in locusts
He stares at The Book Of The Dead, looking haunted
What have we done
The campfire is - 'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race down the labyrinth, slapping at themselves and picking locusts out of their hair Did you see that
Grasshoppers
Billions of grasshoppers
' That's one of the plagues, right
The grasshopper plague
This is not a plague
It's generational
Every so many years the locusts of Egypt have a population explosion and they all take flight
Evelyn steps forward, something
'Connell lowers his , -- the entire floor is
' Okay,
and what about frogs
- The Americans, Beni and the Diggers race into a passageway
Burns is knocked down, his bifocals skitter across the ground, they get  in the stampede
Burns staggers to his feet, squinting
vanish into the darkness, Daniels
Henderson
- The ground under 'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan starts to Then suddenly, right in front of them, -- Start scurrying towards them
Evelyn
Jonathan
Even 'Connell almost screams
They turn around and haul ass
- Burns staggers down a passageway, squinting, his hands out in front of him, groping, trying not to bump into anything
Then ten feet in front of him, a dark, blurry  steps out
Daniels
is that you
Burns half-blindly staggers forward
The Figure doesn't move
Henderson
Burns , stumbles forward, towards the Figure, his hands reach out and   '
Burns jumps like a scalded cat, pulls his hands out and looks at them, --
He starts to
clamps over his mouth
- 'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race up the staircase, just ahead of the mass of ,
'Connell leaps out onto a pedestal
Jonathan jumps up next to him
Evelyn jumps up into a grotto on the other side of the narrow stairway
The horrible herd of vicious scarabs scurries between them, their ear-piercing  send shivers up Evelyn's spine
She leans back
Evelyn falls backwards through an opening
'Connell and Jonathan watch the scarabs vanish up the staircase
Then they look across the way
Evelyn is gone
- Evelyn sits up, shakes the sand out of her hair, fearfully looks around
It's almost
She gets up and feels her way along the dark walls
She rounds a corner
shaft of  filters in through a crack in the ceiling stands in the middle of the room
Evelyn walks towards him
Oh thank goodness, you're one of the Americans, aren't you
Just as she reaches him he turns around
It's Burns He stares at her with vacant sockets
Evelyn  in horror and backs away, hyperventilating, she bumps into something
She  again and spins around It's Imhotep
With two fresh  in his sockets
Evelyn  again and backs away into a wall
Her hair is down, her face is dirty and sweaty, her blouse is ripped, her dress is torn, she's never looked sexier
Imhotep
Anck-su-namun
- 'Connell is feeling his way around inside the grotto ' Damn-it
Must be a trap door around here or somethin'
And then they heat  , and suddenly, Henderson, Daniels and one of the Diggers come running down the stairs
,  --
'Connell and Jonathan join them as they hear the herd of scarabs coming their way
The Digger suddenly trips and falls
'Connell slows down, about to go back and help him
But it's too late
The Digger  in horror as the herd of scarabs run over him, eating straight through him, leaving behind the Digger's half eaten skeleton
Daniels Henderson and Jonathan react in horror
'Connell's already running, races right past them
The others turn and haul ass
- Imhotep steps forward, -- the sand around him seems to , swirling and dancing around his flaking skeletal legs
Evelyn starts backing away, horrified, looks at Burns Help me,
please,
help me
Burns opens his mouth, but can only  and  because Imhotep grabs him, throws him to the ground and sets his skeletal foot on Burns' chest, like a big game hunter standing on his kill
Imhotep then parts his fetid lips, --
Kadeesh pharos Anck-su-namun
Evelyn shivers in fear
Suddenly, 'Connell comes flying around the corner and runs right up to her
' Would you quit playin, around
Let's get outta here already
'Connell sees the look in her eyes and turns around, -- at the sight of Imhotep, 'Connell jumps back in fright
' 'Connell and Evelyn start backing away down the wall
Imhotep glides sideways with them, like a tiger cornering his prey, the sand around him  and
Burns starts to crawl away, whimpering as he goes
Imhotep suddenly stops and  his skeletal jaw, his skinless mouth stretches to an inhuman size, and he lets out a horrific, primordial --
Evelyn
'Connell shudders, then, embarrassed by his fear, he opens his own mouth and  right back at him -- ' Ahhhhhhhh
Then  him with the elephant gun, --
Through the we see Imhotep blown off his feet, his ribcage half torn away
'Connell grabs Evelyn and runs
- and  whip through the ruins as 'Connell and Evelyn stumble up out of the crevice and  -- The Mumia quickly raise their guns
'Connell and Evelyn quickly raise their hands
Jonathan, Henderson, Daniels and the Egyptologist are already on their knees, hands over their heads
Ardeth Ray steps forward
told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all
For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years
' Relax,  got him
No mortal weapons can kill this creature
He is not of this world
' Are we talkin, about the same creature
The walking corpse
Really big mouth
Really bad breath
'  - Beni slowly backs up around Anubis, eyes wide, gun up
He turns around, --
Beni , backs away and
Six  perforate Imhotep, but have no effect except to  molten flesh rot onto the back wall
Beni retreats into a corner, scared shitless
Imhotep moves forward, his one hand trying to stop the molten mummy guts from oozing out of the large shotgun hole in his side
Beni drops his gun and grabs at the  around his neck,     dangle from each chain
Beni holds the first one up:
He quickly makes the sign of-the cross and blesses himself in English: May the good Lord protect and watch over me as a shepherd watches over his flock
And may Satan in all his forms be vanquished forever
It has no effect on Imhotep, who continues forward
Beni quickly grabs at the other symbols and icons, holding them out towards Imhotep, one after the other, trying to slow his progress: an Islamic Sword and Crescent Moon necklace; a Hindu Brahma medallion; a small Buddhist Bodhisattva statue
All while blessing himself in Arabic, Hindi, Chinese and Latin
Nothing works
Imhotep's skeletal hand reaches for Beni's throat
Tears run down Beni's cheeks he's so freaked
And that's when he holds up     and blesses himself in
Imhotep stops in his tracks
His hand lowers
His grotesque new eyeballs stare at Beni
(subtitled) The language of the slaves
Looks at him quizzically
Imhotep takes a step back
(in Hebrew -- subtitled) may have use for you
And the rewards will be great
Imhotep reaches into his tattered robe, and then holds out his fetid hand, filled with squirming
Beni cringes, about to throw up, but then the maggots part, -- revealing a tiny pile of little
Beni's eyes widen
Imhotep raises his other hand, it holds Anck-su-namun's
Where are the other sacred jars
- Several Mumia drag Burns up, he stares out with vacant sockets
Daniels and Henderson are especially horrified
You bastards
What did you do to him
We saved him
Saved him before the creature could finish his work
Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all
You're not going to kill us
Evelyn  Jonathan in the ribs
We must now hunt him down, and try and find a way to kill him, before he consumes the earth
Allah be with us
Ardeth Ray and the Mumia start heading down into the crevice
'Connell yells at them, trying to convince himself
' told ya,  already got him
Ardeth Ray stops and looks back, deadly serious
Know this, the creature will be coming for you
He must consummate the curse
And until he does, he will never eat, he will never sleep, and he will never stop
Ardeth Ray turns and jumps down into the crevice, - 'Connell and Jonathan boost Evelyn up onto a camel
Daniels and Henderson throw Burns up onto another
The Egyptologist, still clutching The Book Of The Dead, gets up on yet another
They all head off into the dark, windblown desert
And then in the extreme foreground, ,     , -- --
-  - British flag flies over   manning the front gate
Our tired, disheveled Heroes saunter up on their dusty camels
The Soldiers check their papers, then let them enter
'  - steamer trunk is slammed to the floor and thrown open
'Connell chucks a load of  into the trunk
' thought you didn't believe in this stuff
'Connell heads for the closet
Evelyn  the dresses Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one
' Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone
No, we are not
'Connell throws a handful of her underthings into the trunk
' Oh yes we are
'Connell continues to  Evelyn's clothes as she continues to  them: No we are not
We woke him up, and we must try and stop him
' We
What we
You didn't read that book
told you not to play around with that thing
Alright then, Me, ,
read the book,  woke him up and  intend to stop him
'Connell angrily stretches a bra between his hands
' How
You heard the man, no mortal weapons can kill this guy
Evelyn grabs the bra and throws it into a drawer
Then we'll have to find some immortal ones
' There goes that belief again
Not me,  am outta here
'Connell stuffs a pile of Evelyn's shoes into the trunk
Evelyn  the lid shut, slamming it on his fingers
'Connell  and angrily storms around the room sucking his fingers as Evelyn follows him
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed
' Yeah
So
Is that my problem
(incredulous) It's everybody's problem
' Look lady,  appreciate you saving my life and all, but when  signed on,  agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and  did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated
That's what  am to you
contract
' You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot
'm staying
' 'Connell storms out and  the door
Then the door opens and 'Connell's hand reaches back in and throws a handful of frilly panties to the floor
goes the door
- 'Connell angrily strides through the compound
He sees Beni coming up the path with a  dressed in hooded robes, his face covered by an ornate death mask
Imhotep disguised
' Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to
You left me
You left me in the desert to rot
' Oh yeah,
sorry bout that
(gestures to Imhotep) So who's this guy
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris
' Oh, hey, how ya doin'
'Connell sticks out his hand, -- Imhotep instantly recoils 'Connell gives him the once-over
Beni quickly covers
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans
Silly eastern superstition, 'm afraid
' Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we
He has come to help Mister Burns
Somehow  feel responsible
' Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples
Do you know where  can steal some
'Connell fake-punches him
Beni flinches
'Connell gives Imhotep a look as he strides off
' See ya around, Padre
Imhotep's grotesque new eyes glare out from behind the mask
- The proverbial den-of-iniquity
Hard men, hard women and hard liquor
Lots of deals going down
An   with a walrus mustache is drunk and talking to some tough customers
He wears British  fighter pilot gear
Meet
'm the last of the Royal Force still stationed here, you know
All the other laddies died in the air and were buried in the sand
The tough customers shove him away
Winston staggers over to 'Connell and Jonathan at the bar, not missing a beat
Ever since the end of the Great War, there hasn't been a single challenge worthy of a man like me
' 've heard it before, Winston
'Connell shoves him away
Winston staggers back to Jonathan
just wish  would've chucked it with the other laddies, gone down in a flame of glory, instead of sitting around here, rotting from boredom and booze
Jonathan shoves him towards another group of unlucky sods Henderson and Daniels sidle up to the bar next to them
Burns, now tongue-less, talks with a severe impediment
The drawer there, spectacles
(tries to laugh) As you see,  won't be needing them
Imhotep opens the drawer and pulls out some bifocals
He puts the bifocals on over his death mask, -- and grins broadly, his rotted teeth showing through the mouth hole
Mister Burns, Prince Imhotep thanks you for your spectacles, -- and for your eyes,
and for your tongue
The expression on Burns' face starts to change, very puzzled
But  am afraid more is needed, the Prince says he must finish the job, consummate the curse which you and your friends have brought down upon yourselves
look of pure fear registers on Burns, face
Beni quickly backs away and runs out of the room
Imhotep picks up the sacred canopic jar, then removes the death mask, revealing his hideous, shattered -
- Three shot glasses clink together
'Connell, Jonathan and Henderson slug 'em down, -- all three of them instantly the liquid
Half the bar   their drinks as well
Sweet Jesus
That tasted just like,
like
' Blood
They all look at each other, even more nervous
"And the rivers and waters of Egypt went red and were as blood
" look passes over 'Connell's face, a realization
' He's here
He suddenly jumps away from the bar and runs for the door
Who's here
' The guy
The Priest
- as 'Connell races across the compound, knocking several Soldiers out of his way, panic stricken
' Evelyn
- Evelyn calmly steps into a courtyard carrying a handful of books
scares her
She drops half the books
Then a
She jumps again and drops the rest of the books
It's 'Connell, breathing hard
' We got problems
And that's when a barrage of    slams into the courtyard
'Connell and Evelyn jump back
water fountain bursts into
wooden trellis catches
'Connell and Evelyn run under the eaves as ,  and run in every direction, trying to avoid the maelstrom
' He's here
saw him
That thing is here
The creature
Are you sure
'Connell gives her an incredulous look and gestures at the and
' Pretty sure
The  and  come to a stop
Everything goes dead quiet
'Connell and Evelyn freeze
And then a is heard coming from the living quarters directly above them
'Connell and Evelyn race up the stairs
'  - 'Connell and Evelyn race into the room, past the Servant who is running out
They skid to a stop as they spot Burns, or what's left of him, lying dead on the floor, -- '
Drained of all organs and liquids
'Connell and Evelyn are shocked
Then they hear a   and notice Imhotep standing on the far side of the room
'Connell draws his gun
Imhotep is :  thick skin  over powerful new musculature
His tendons
His bones  and His mouth opens to an inhuman size as he  and , in severe pain
And then it's over
And he looks like an incredibly muscular, corpse-like vision from hell
The 'Terminator' Mummy
'Connell and Evelyn are stunned
' We are in serious trouble
Imhotep starts to move towards them, staring at Evelyn
' Back off, creep
Imhotep keeps coming
'Connell
Imhotep Bullets  through his body
Imhotep doesn't seem to mind
Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels run into the room
They're all stunned at the sight of Imhotep
'Connell steps forward, throws a  , punches Imhotep in the face, --     ' 'Connell stares at it, shocked, then quickly  his fist back out
The area of Imhotep's face that came into contact with 'Connell's fist quickly  and , right down to the bone, as if 'Connell's hand instantly infected it
Imhotep angrily turns, grabs 'Connell, and with no effort, him across the room and into Jonathan and the others knocking them down
Imhotep looks at his hand, the one that just grabbed 'Connell, --     and
He quickly turns to Evelyn
Evelyn backs away into a wall, terrorized
Imhotep steps up to her
You saved me from the undead
For this,  shall make you immortal
He leans in, about to kiss her with his decayed face
And that's when a   jumps onto the piano,
Imhotep
The balcony doors
Imhotep spins into a      and  out the doors
Gone
'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and Daniels stand transfixed
Henderson kneels next to Burns, shriveled body, horrified
The curse
The curse
- 'Connell, Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels follow Evelyn across the Ramesseum
There's only one person  know who can possibly give us some answers
They round a corner and come upon the Curator, -- who is talking with Ardeth Ray
Everybody stops
'Connell and the American's quickly draw their guns
Ardeth Ray just scowls
The Curator nods his head
Miss Carnavon
Gentlemen
What is he doing here
Do you truly wish to know
Or would you prefer to just shoot us
Everybody tenses, guns up
Then 'Connell uncocks his
38
' just saw my fist vanish into some guy's head
He slides his gun back into his shoulder-holster
' 'm willin, to go on a little faith, here
You will not believe it
' Try me
- Everyone is assembled around the tomb display of Seti The First
We recognize his chariot and sword
The Curator sits on Seti's throne
We are part of an ancient secret society, the cult-of-the-Mumia, and we have a sacred mission, passed down through thirty-nine generations
For over four thousand years we have guarded The City Of The Dead
we are sworn at manhood to do any and all in our power to stop the High Priest Imhotep from being reborn into this world
And because of you, we have failed
(appalled) And you think this justifies killing innocent people
To have stopped this creature
Yes
' Okay, let's cut to the chase
He's afraid of cats, what's that about
According to the ancients, cat's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld
Imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, and then he will fear nothing
Daniels is totally wigged-out, he looks at 'Connell
Right
And ya know how he gets fully regenerated
By killing everybody who opened that chest and sucking us dry
That's how
Yes, the creature must first try and regenerate, and then he will attempt to resurrect the one he has loved for more than four thousand years
Anck-su-namun
The Curator and Ardeth Ray look at Evelyn, thunderstruck
In the necropolis, when  saw him, - alive,
walking, he called me Anck- su-namun
And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me
It is because it was you who read from the Book
He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun
Jonathan scratches his ear with the barrel of his pistol
This is not good
Not good at all
Ardeth Ray has been staring out a wall of windows
Tonight is the full moon
The moon of Osiris
It will begin tonight
Everyone follows Ardeth Ray's eyes, through the windows we can see the , -- which is now going into a
"
and he stretched forth his hands towards the heavens, and there was darkness throughout the land of Egypt
" -  - 'Connell looks out a window at the British Soldiers manning the walls
Above and beyond them, -- is the
'  - Evelyn and Jonathan are pacing the foyer We must stop him from regenerating
She turns to Daniels and Henderson
Who opened that chest
Well, there was me and Daniels here and then poor Burns of course, oh yeah, and that Egyptologist fella
'Connell turns from the window
' What about my buddy, Beni
Naw, he scrammed outta there, We must find the Egyptologist and bring him back here to the safety of the fort, before the creature can get to him
'Connell looks at Evelyn, Daniels and Henderson
' Okay,
Evelyn, you wait here, you two come with me
All three of them pounce on him at once -- The hell with that
'm not goin' nowhere
We're safe here
Yeah, 'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'
Who put you in charge
You can't just leave me behind like some old suitcase
'm the one responsible for this mess and  intend to be the one to clean it up
'Connell just shakes his head and
Totally put-upon
Then he takes Evelyn, shoves her into the bedroom, slams the door and locks it with a skeleton key
From inside her room we can hear Evelyn  on the door and
'Connell throws the skeleton key to Daniels
' Keep an eye on her
If you leave her door, 'll rip your spleen out
'mon, Jonathan
Jonathan swallows hard and points to himself
Me
-  - The Egyptologist stumbles through the dark alleys, looking haunted
He clutches the Book of The Dead in one hand and his    in the other
Imhotep is stalking him
turns and sees Imhotep's horribly decayed face
He reacts and scurries away
Imhotep lifts his robe, covers his face, and moves in on the Egyptologist, who is heading into the bazaar
-- '  - Beni is  the joint, pulling out drawers and files and throwing them on the floor
He finds a silver pocket watch, shakes it, then throws it into his pocket, then he starts tipping over bookcases and clearing shelves
' (
) Well, well, well
Beni spins around
'Connell and Jonathan stand in the door
' Lemme guess, spring cleaning
Beni turns and runs for an open window
'Connell grabs a chair,   into his path
Beni  and  into a wall
'Connell strides over, grabs him and lifts him up the wall
Beni's feet dangle off the floor
' Where's your new friend
What friend
You're my only friend
'Connell quickly slides his knife up under Beni's chin
' Then you got no excuse for living
What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni
What's in it for you
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,
than in his path
As long as  serve him,  am immune
' Immune from what
You shall see
' What are you looking for
Lie, and 'll slit your throat
'Connell shoves the knife deeper into Beni's skin
The book
The black book they found at Hamunaptra
Imhotep wants it back
Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds
' What does he want the book for
(shrugs) Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life
He needs the book
(looks at Jonathan) And your sister
'Connell looks at Jonathan
Beni seizes the moment and 'Connell in the balls
'Connell doubles over and collapses
Beni leaps out the window
Jonathan cringes
That looked rather painful
' (wincing) Ya know, ever since  met you, my luck has been for crap
Yes,  know,  do that to people
And that's when they hear a    coming from down in the bazaar
'Connell and Jonathan scramble to the window and look out -- - Down in the bazaar, people are  and quickly backing away from the
partially decayed  reaches down and takes the sacred canopic jar out of the Egyptologist's shriveled hand
It's Imhotep, having regenerated even further
He looks up and catches eyes with 'Connell
Imhotep grins, then ; his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman size, and then a huge    comes out of his mouth and races straight up at 'Connell and Jonathan
They both  the shutters
The flies  into the closed window and immediately spread throughout the bazaar
Sending people  and running
'  - 'Connell and Jonathan look at each other, panicked
' Damn-it
That's two down and only two to go
And then he'll be coming after Evy
They turn and race out of the office
-  -- Daniels stares out a window, watching the British Guards at the front gate
More Soldiers march the encircling parapet
Ten o'clock
All is well
The lights and  from the Casbah come up from below '  - Daniels turns from the window
Henderson sits in a chair next to Evelyn's door, chain smoking
Both look wired with fear
The hell with this
'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink
You want somethin'
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser
Daniels nods and heads out
Henderson just sits there, alone, smoking
He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out his and fondles it
suddenly comes in through the open window
The curtains flutter
Henderson gets up and goes over to shut it
He looks out the window
The  races over the compound, into the window and Henderson square in the  just as he's about to scream
Henderson is lifted into the air by a mass of
His body  and  and slowly  as the life is out of him
Then he  to the floor
On the wall above him, the of the   condenses, forming a  of a human body
The   as the body
And then it's over
Imhotep steps into view
He's regenerated even further and looks almost normal now, his face no longer decayed
He steps over Henderson's shriveled body and up to Evelyn's door, rattles the knob
It's locked
Imhotep grins
'  - Evelyn is asleep in her bed as  begins streaming in through the keyhole, pouring onto the floor, forming a large mound
Evelyn starts to toss and turn : The mound of sand is gone and in it's place is Imhotep
- 'Connell and Jonathan race into the foyer and skid to a stop as they see Henderson's shriveled body on the floor
'Connell runs up to Evelyn's door and rattles the knob, still locked
He bends down and looks in through the
'  - Imhotep leans down towards Evelyn, about to kiss her as she sleeps
The door starts to  and  from 'Connell
Imhotep ignores it
And  Evelyn
His lips and mouth instantly start to  and
Right down to the bone
The door
Evelyn wakes up
Sees Imhotep's rotted mouth kissing her
She  and shoves him away
Imhotep's putrid mouth grimaces in sadness
' Get your hands off my girl, pal
Imhotep's sadness turns to anger as he spins around and faces 'Connell
Imhotep licks his fetid lips
'Connell smirks
' Nice lips
Imhotep starts to move for 'Connell
' figured you might be here, so brought a friend
He throws the white cat at Imhotep
Imhotep instinctively catches it
He , drops the cat and stumbles back towards the window, -- which suddenly
Imhotep spins like a dervish and
Everybody covers their eyes
The Imhotep/sand-devil out the window and vanishes over the compound
Jonathan aims his gun at the window, his hand shaking badly
'Connell hugs Evelyn as she wipes her mouth in disgust
Daniels walks in, looks at Henderson's shriveled body on the floor
and drops the martini glasses
1923   - Jonathan races his big convertible through the streets, constantly
Evelyn sits between him and 'Connell, looking scared and nervous, then she gives 'Connell a look
You called me your girl
' What
Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech
think you were jealous ' Jealous
You kiddin' me
Did you see that guy's face
Daniels leans forward from the back seat, filled with fear, Shut-up
-
We gotta do somethin'
we gotta do somethin, Before it's too late
They race into the driveway of the museum of Antiquities
- now shines down on the bazaar, still bustling with activity
Suddenly, a  kicks-in
begins to  down the street and through the stalls
The people begin to  and  and , as if being hit by a severe sickness -- it's already too late
Imhotep strolls through the sickened mob, his face half rotted off, his deformed mouth grinning happily
Beni is at his side, looking very nervous
And then, one-by-one, the people silently begin to follow Imhotep, their skin now covered in disgustingly hideous - 'Connell
, Jonathan, Daniels, the Curator and Ardeth Ray follow Evelyn as she strides through the museum
Last month  came across an inscription that mentioned The Book Of The Dead
That book we found at Hamunaptra
Yes
dismissed it, because it talked about bringing people back from the dead
notion  was unwilling to believe
' Believe it, sister
That's what brought our buddy back to life
And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back And if he succeeds, the two of them together will bring about the apocalypse
The Curator joins Evelyn at her side as she heads up the stairs, everyone else in hot pursuit
The plagues we have seen so far, are merely Imhotep flexing his muscles
Only at the moment of Anck-su-namun's resurrection will he be truly invincible
They reach the display cases
Evelyn quickly opens them
'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life -- -- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld
Exactly -- ' So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold -- -- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it
' You think it'll send this guy back to hell
Correct, And that's when -- is heard coming from outside
They all rush over to the upper windows and look down -- :  large, covered in hideous boils and sores comes up the driveway: 'Anck-su-namun
Anck-su-namun
' It has begun
The beginning of the end
Not quite yet it hasn't
'mon
Evelyn dashes back to the display cases
Everyone follows
- The crazed mob  into the huge front doors, which are locked
They pound furiously, throwing themselves at it while Imhotep solemnly comes up the driveway
-   - The  on the doors can be heard as Evelyn and the Curator quickly sort through broken pieces of stone tablets
The others watch
Evelyn pulls out a large piece
Got it
' Got what
The  gets
Multiple windows
Evelyn talks while quickly translating the tablet: Since the black Book of The Dead was found inside the statue of Anubis, then according to this, the golden Book of The Living should be inside
Evelyn finds the translation in the tablet and smiles
' What
What
The golden Book Of The Living, is inside the statue of Horus
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue
' Don't tell me we gotta go back out there
If we want to kill the creature, yes
& -  charge out of a doorway, 'Connell and Ardeth Ray grab them and chuck them over the railing
The men fly through the air and  into the lower display cases
The front doors suddenly  , The crazed mob pours into the museum
our heroes haul ass across the balcony and down the staircase
- Jonathan sneaks out of some bushes and quickly heads for his convertible
Suddenly, a splinter group of the diseased mob comes around the side of the museum
Jonathan instantly bugs his eyes out, starts drooling, and begins  -- Anck-su-namun
Anck-su-namun
The crazed group runs past him and heads into the front doors of the museum
Jonathan leaps into the convertible, fires it up and 180's it back over to the bushes
'Connell, Evelyn, Daniels, Ardeth Ray and the Curator jump inside the car
Beni steps out of the museum and sees them
Imhotep
Imhotep looks out of the museum from the shattered upper windows just as the convertible
'Connell points a finger at Beni as they race past him
' You're gonna get yours, pal
Imhotep  his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman size, he lets out one of his horrific, primordial
His disease-ridden disciples immediately begin pouring out of the front doors of the museum and chasing after the car
- The convertible hauls ass down the narrow bazaar street
Crazies start jumping out of stalls and  onto the car
'Connell and the others fight them off, throwing them overboard
More people  on
Jonathan  the car, through some stalls, knocking them off, but not before they manage to open the back door and  Daniels out
He across the pavement
Gets up
Backs into a corner,  his pistol into the hideous rabble, killing several, keeping them at bay
His gun goes empty,
But the mob stays back, looking at him like rabid vultures
Daniels eyes them, filled with fear
The mob parts like the red sea as Imhotep walks through them and up to Daniels
Daniels whimpers in fear, tears pour down his cheeks
Then he gets an idea, reaches into his pocket, and pulls out his jewel encrusted
He holds it out for Imhotep
Imhotep takes it and grins
Through his tears, Daniels grins back, hopeful that he'll be spared
: Somewhere in the middle of the crazed, diseased mob, we hear Daniels give out
/
-  - The convertible slowly motors down the narrow alleys across the hood of the car from Jonathan to Evelyn to 'Connell
Ardeth Ray and the Curator are still in the back
All of them staring out the front windshield
Freaked-out
Then suddenly one of the hideous ghouls  through the windshield
Everybody
Jonathan hits the gas, loses control, the car  into a wall
'Connell grabs Evelyn
' 'mon
'mon
Let's go
Let's go
They all leap out of the car
But the angry, festering mob quickly surrounds them
'Connell quickly reaches into his gunny-sack, pulls out a stick of dynamite, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out a match
He looks around for a way to light it, then reaches over and strikes it across Ardeth Ray's stubbly face
Ardeth Ray
'Connell holds the lit match near the fuse
The crazed,  mob gives 'Connell a wide berth, staring at him and the others with insane, bloodshot eyes
And then Imhotep steps through, -- having fully regenerated, he now looks as young and handsome and muscular as he did the day he was buried alive
Evelyn stares at him
He's gorgeous
'Connell gives her a look, the match burns his fingers
He and throws it down, grabs another match and strikes it across Ardeth Ray's face again
Ardeth Ray  and gives 'Connell a look to kill
The Curator shakes his head
He has consummated the curse, now all he need do is raise Anck-su-namun from the dead, then it will be the end of us, and the beginning for them
Imhotep moves forward, heading right for them
'Connell Imhotep steps up to 'Connell and stops, watching the fuse burn down
it's a game of chicken
The tension mounts
The   is about to vanish inside the stick of dynamite, blowing it up, -- when Evelyn leans forward and blows it out
'Connell exhales, but keeps his eyes on Imhotep, who extends his hand to Evelyn
Koontash dai na
Beni steps through the swarming mass, translating
Take his hand and he will spare the others
Evelyn hesitates, looks around at the huge, bloodthirsty crowd surrounding them, holding axes, picks and scimitars, waiting to pounce, then she looks at Imhotep, confident, powerful, invincible
Then she looks at 'Connell
Any bright ideas
'Connell talks through angry, grit teeth
' Sorry, fresh out
Evelyn looks back at Imhotep, then starts to reach out to take his hand
Both 'Connell and Jonathan move to stop her, -- but Ardeth Ray grabs them both and holds them tight
' Don't do it, Evelyn
have no choice
Evelyn's trembling hand touches Imhotep's: His hand closes around hers
Nothing happens
Imhotep smiles
Keetah mi pharos, aja nilo, isirlan
Come with me my princess
It is time to make you mine, forever
Evelyn gives Beni a nasty look, correcting him -- All eternity, idiot
Then she looks at 'Connell and puts on her best face
You better think of something, because if he turns me into a mummy, you're the first one 'm coming after
'Connell almost smiles
' Got guts, lady
Yes,  know, and 'd like to keep them
Imhotep suddenly notices something
He reaches forward and -- /   '
Hey that's mine --
Ardeth Ray holds Jonathan back
Imhotep pulls Evelyn away
'Connell can't take it anymore, he tries to break free of Ardeth Ray's grip
' Evelyn
The huge, powerful man holds him tight
Be calm
There is still time
We can stop him yet
The crowd parts for Imhotep and Evelyn
And then Imhotep stops and looks back at 'Connell
Pared oos
Evelyn
Beni smiles
Kill them
Imhotep pulls her away
'Connell breaks free of Ardeth Ray's grip and stumbles forward
' But the rabid vultures are already moving in for the kill
'Connell quickly bends down, pulls open a / and shoves Jonathan down inside it, then jumps in after him
The Curator pushes Ardeth Ray towards the cistern hole
Go
Find a way
Kill the creature
The Curator turns and throws himself at the mob as Ardeth Ray crawls down into the hole
The mob tears the Curator apart
- 'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray slosh their way down the watery catacomb, crazies pouring in behind them
Up ahead, a suddenly shines in from another cistern hole, and then more of the infected crowd drop down,  like rats
'Connell jags right, pushing Jonathan and Ardeth Ray ahead of him, he strikes a match off the wall, lights the nubby fuse on a stick of dynamite, throws it, and runs like hell
incinerates a bunch of crazies
-  - The  blows a cistern cover fifty feet into the air, followed by a mass of
- sewer grate is kicked out of a wall
'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray climb out of the hole and into
' We gotta get her back
'm with you, old man
No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it
'Connell looks at Ardeth Ray
' You know where he's taking her
Yes
To Hamunaptra
To perform the ritual
Jonathan looks worried
And what ritual would that be
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life
And how does one do that
By reading the Book Of The Dead
Oh yes, of course
And then killing your sister
Excuse me
Ardeth Ray looks at 'Connell
Imhotep is now able to cross the desert with great haste
Jonathan taps him in the shoulder
Begging your pardon, but  wasn't quite clear on that last part
Ardeth Ray ignores him
If he arrives before us, it will be too late
Did you say 'kill' my sister
'Connell smiles
' know how to beat him to it
And on that     --    - Jonathan's bashed-in convertible steams it's way up to a set of semi-abandoned Quonset huts
single   with sits in the sand beside them
: ' -  - 'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray stand before Winston Havlock, the massive dunes of Erfoud as our background
So what's your little problem got to do with His Majesty's Royal Air Corp
' Not a god-damned thing
Winston looks intrigued
Is it dangerous
' You probably won't live through it
This really interests him
By Jove, do you really think so
Everybody else we've bumped into has died, why not you
Winston nods his head, he's hooked
So what's the challenge then
' To save the damsel in distress, kill the bad guy and steal his treasure
slow grin spreads across Winston's face, then he gives them a snappy salute
Winston Havlock at your service, sir
- Way off across the desert, a large - races over the dunes
The   comes to a stop and starts to dissipate
Evelyn and Beni are suddenly ejected out of it, they land in a dune
The He looks up into the sky, listening carefully
Evelyn shakes the sand out of her hair and looks at Beni
What just happened
All  remember is him turning into a blast of sand,
and then  remember nothing
Then they hear a plane in the sky and look up
- The  whips at Winston in the cockpit
'Connell sits in the gunner's compartment
Jonathan is strapped spread-eagle across the left wing, Ardeth Ray is tied tight to the right
Both men are scared out of their wits and  in fear
- Imhotep's jaw , his mouth opens to an inhuman size, he lets fly with another one of his horrible
-- And a massive    rises up out of the desert - 'Connell watches the desert below him come alive and rise up towards the plane
Winston looks over the side and sees what's coming
He laughs, throws the throttle, and puts the plane into a dive
Hang on, men
: The sandstorm chases the diving, twisting biplane
Getting closer and closer, about to engulf it
'Connell looks back into the blinding sand and sees a forming inside the sandstorm
It's Imhotep
Grinning
'Connell grabs the Lewis machine-gun, cocks the bracket and , blasting away at Imhotep's giant face inside the sandstorm
Imhotep's face begins to laugh, then his jaw unhinges, his mouth opens wide, and he  the plane
Winston blindly fights for control, elated
We're going down
The biplane  inside the
Engines
Wind
Jonathan and Ardeth Ray
Winston Havlock
Here  come, laddies
'Connell braces himself for impact, - Evelyn leaps to her feet and runs over to Imhotep
Stop it
You'll kill them
Imhotep grabs her, pulls her close, her beautiful eyes stare into his shockingly intense ones
Then he kisses her, hard
Evelyn's eyes widen, stunned and mesmerized, then she pushes herself away and falls back into the sand
Imhotep laughs
-  - The biplane  over a dune,   and  upside- down into another dune
The   as 'Connell falls out of the gunner's compartment
The left wing is jammed into the dune, Jonathan hangs upside down
Excuse me
little help would be useful
' 'Connell goes to help Jonathan
Ardeth Ray stumbles over to the gunner's compartment and tears the Lewis gun off it's mount
He throws the machine-gun over one shoulder, a cartridge belt over the other and staggers away
'Connell and Jonathan look into the cockpit
Winston Havlock is dead
smile on his face
The plane suddenly starts to move, the sand sinks under their feet, they quickly high-tail-it away
'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make it to some rocks and look back
The biplane, with Winston Havlock inside, slides away over a dune
'Connell gives it a salute
The plane vanishes over the dune and into the
- 'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray come down a ravine in the volcano and look out over the ruins of Hamunaptra
' Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon
' Got it
- Carrying , 'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make their way down a long, winding, narrow staircase
Heading into the bowels of the necropolis
passageway to hell
- Evelyn follows Imhotep into the underground cemetery
She stops at the sight of all the big hairy rats scurrying through the mausoleums and over the gravestones
Beni shoves his rifle into her back and pushes her forward
Keep moving
Evelyn gives him a look
You know, nasty little fellows such as yourself, always get their comeuppance
Beni suddenly looks worried
Yeah
Oh yes, always
Beni looks even more worried, he nervously starts chewing on his lip
All three of them walk over the bridge crossing the disgusting
Evelyn looks down at it, horrified
- 'Connell and Ardeth Ray are busy digging out a collapsed doorway
Jonathan notices an   on the far wall
say, look at that
He walks over and tries to jiggle it free
It comes loose in his hand
He looks at the scarab in his palm
It starts to glow
And then something inside it starts to
Say, gents
You should come have a look at this
The wiggling continues; a long, agonizing , and then the scarab breaks out of it's cocoon and instantly  into Jonathan's palm
Jonathan starts to freak out and
'Connell runs up and rips the arm off Jonathan's shirt
The scarab is now   '
'Connell whips out his butterfly-knife, snaps it open and grabs Jonathan's arm
Jonathan's eyes widen in terror as the knife passes in front of his face
Jonathan  , obviously being cut open
'Connell's hand flicks something away
The scarab hits the floor and immediately starts scurrying back towards Jonathan, wanting to finish the job
'Connell pulls out his gun and blows it away, --
- The  echoes into the cemetery as Imhotep, Evelyn and Beni step-up to the strange , where four thousand years ago Imhotep tried to bring Anck-su-namun back to life
Imhotep scowls at the sound and angrily reaches into a He pulls out the crusted remains of Anck-su-namun's heart, crushes it to dust in his hand and starts reading from The Book Of The Dead
Then he  the dust against a mausoleum wall, --
Evelyn and Beni stare at the wall, both of them wide-eyed
emerge from the mausoleum's wall
Horrific-looking mummified
Two of Imhotep's long dead Priests
They bow to Imhotep, then turn and move off down a passageway
- 'Connell helps Ardeth Ray mend Jonathan's wound
' From now on, don't touch anything
Not a damn thing
Keep your hands off the furniture, got it
Jonathan swallows hard and nods vigorously
- Imhotep prepares the altar while speaking in
Beni holds his gun on her, translating: Prince Imhotep wants your heart
Evelyn blushes, feeling complimented by the handsome prince
Tell him, 'm truly flattered
but that it's already taken
Imhotep continues  while laying the four jewel encrusted canopic jars next to the shattered one
He wants your heart and your brain, your liver, your kidneys
Evelyn's eyes widen
and how do you say
Those slimy things, in your stomach
Intestines
Yeah
Them
Evelyn can't believe it, she furiously turns to Imhotep
You only want me for my organs
Imhotep looks at her and grins, then  her --
Evelyn goes down for the count
Imhotep stares at her, cold, malevolent, then he turns and walks off into the mausoleums
Beni nervously glances around, then quickly scurries away
- 'Connell squeezes through a small crevice in a wall and drops to the floor of a dark chamber
He picks up his gunnysack and scans the darkness
Something
Jonathan and Ardeth Ray crawl in behind him
'Connell notices a   , high above him, shooting through a small hole in the ceiling and stopping against a wall next to one of those mirror disks
'Connell aims his gun
The bullet  the disk's pedestal, spinning the mirror into the shaft of light, -- And It's an enormous
Filled to overflowing
Everything sparkles and shines
The wealth of Egypt
'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray are speechless
That's when the two mummified Priest-mummies walk in
' Who the hell are these guys
Priests
Imhotep's priests
'Connell pulls the elephant gun out of his gunny-sack
' never killed a priest before
They are evil, cursed, they matter not
' Well, okay then
'Connell  the elephant gun
and  shoot out
one of the mummies
Blows it's upper torso clean off
'Connell pumps the gun, the huge spent cartridge flips through the air
He  again
the other mummy, blows this one's torso clean off as well
The smoke clears
The two sets of  keep walking forward, unaffected by the loss of their upper torsos
'Connell can't believe it
' Oh come on, gimme a break here
And then the disemboweled upper torsos start to move, turning over and crawling towards our heroes, who start to back away
- Imhotep turns from the altar as he hears more  echoing out of the passageways
He angrily reaches into another of Anck-su-namun's canopic jars, pulls out her crusty liver and crushes it to dust, then quickly starts reading a passage from the Book and  the dust down a passageway
(ancient Egyptian -- subtitled) Kill them
Kill them all
And bring me the Book Of The Living
- dusty  blows into the chamber as 'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray back away from the mummy pieces
The floor where they were just standing suddenly
Two more mummies slowly dig their way up out of the floor
More mummies start coming out of the walls and crawling out of the piles of gold
All the mummies head for our heroes
'Connell lifts the elephant gun
Ardeth Ray stops him
My turn
Ardeth Ray   with the Lewis gun
the shit out of the mummies
They keep on coming
Even more now
'Connell   with the elephant gun, pumping and as all three of the men back away and haul ass
The mummies and mummy pieces follow them into the passageway
Then Beni creeps into the chamber
He stares in wonder at all the treasure
Then falls backwards into a pile of jewels and rolls about
- Evelyn wakes up, lying chained to the top of the altar
She blinks, then turns her head, -- and looks right into the of Anck-su-namun's corpse
Evelyn
- The elephant gun , blasting  and  right into the
'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray race down a passageway, a dozen mummies striding after them
' This whole place is comin, alive
The men race around a corner
More mummies
They race around another corner
More mummies
Onward they come
Methodical
Relentless
Boxing in our heroes
'Connell and Ardeth Ray as they go
Ardeth Ray goes empty
'm out
He throws the machine-gun down and they all race into -- '  - --  small chamber
The lower half of the giant statue of stands in the middle of the chamber
There he is
They run up to the base of the statue, Hello Horus old boy
'Connell looks back at the mummies coming down the passageway
He reaches into his gunny-sack and pulls out a stick of dynamite
Ardeth Ray taps him on the shoulder
Allow me
'Connell hands him the dynamite and a match, then turns to look at the statue
Ardeth Ray reaches forward and strikes the match off 'Connell's stubbly face
'Connell
Ardeth Ray lights the dynamite and throws it down the passageway
They all hit the deck
The dynamite
Ripping apart the creatures, causing a - and sealing the passageway with rock and dirt
Now there's only one way out, -- another dark, creepy passageway
Chained tight to the top of the altar, Evelyn hopelessly struggles to free herself
She stops as Priest mummies start surrounding the altar
Evelyn is horrified as the hideous mummies kneel down and begin to , -- which now sounds even more horrific due to the lack of tongues, jaws and mouths in the room
Imhotep steps up carrying the black Book Of The Dead
His hand reaches out and lovingly caresses Anck-su-namun's decayed cheek
'  - 'Connell and Jonathan are digging away at the seams of the secret compartment, it starts to give
And that's when Ardeth Ray spots another group of rotting mummies coming down the dark passageway, heading right for them
'Connell looks up
' These guys just don't quit
Ardeth Ray grabs the elephant gun and a handful of shells and runs off towards the mummies
Keep digging
'Connell and Jonathan redouble their efforts, pulling harder on the seam
The compartment starts to loosen
About to give
The last time this happened, salt acid sprayed out, remember
Our heroes keep tugging
The tension mounts
And that's when a and grabs 'Connell's ankle
Several more moldy hands up out of the ground
'Connell and Jonathan struggle with the mummies as they crawl up out of the dirt floor
One of the mummies violently shoves 'Connell away
Another grabs Jonathan by the throat and starts to strangle him third mummy grabs at the secret compartment and pulls hard
The one strangling Jonathan gets it in the back and drops him
All three mummies melt horribly
Imhotep begins to read from The Book Of The Dead
large   starts to open in the detritus bog
Evelyn's eyes widen in amazement and horror
'  - Ardeth Ray   at the oncoming mummies
over at the base of the statue, 'Connell and Jonathan pull an ornate chest out of the secret compartment
'Connell rips off the lid, reaches inside and pulls out a heavy burlap bag
He and Jonathan exchange nervous, excited looks
Then he reaches into the bag and slowly pulls out the Book Of The Living --   reflects off their faces as they stare at it in wonder
The elephant gun goes empty
Ardeth Ray takes it by the barrel and wades into the remaining mummies swinging
Save the girl
Kill the creature
The mummies quickly overwhelm and start to tear him apart
'Connell lights the last stick of dynamite and throws it against the far wall
He and Jonathan hit the deck
' That's the last one, we better get lucky
The wall
Debris , -- but now here's a hole for them to get out
'Connell and Jonathan race out through the hole just as the remaining mummies enter the chamber
- Outside, Beni staggers across the sand with a saddlebag filled with treasure
He throws it over the rear of a camel
Starts to climb up
Hesitates
Looks back at the temple door
Licks his lips
And then his greed gets the better of him and he quickly climbs down and scurries back towards the door
- Imhotep  from the Book
The rotten Priest-mummies rock back and forth,
Evelyn struggles
Then suddenly, the strange  wafts up out of the swirling hole and over to the sacred jars, it passes through them and into Evelyn
Evelyn  as though she's been electrified
The  passes through her and into Anck-su-namun's body
The  ,  ,   and '  reach a crescendo
Anck-su-namun's crusty suddenly
Evelyn stares at her in disbelief
Anck-su-namun's rotted head turns and looks at Evelyn with empty sockets
Evelyn freaks out and struggles wildly, then she notices Imhotep holding the ancient sacrificial knife
With your death, my love and  will be invincible
He raises it up over Evelyn's chest, about to plunge it down
Evelyn's eyes widen in horror
And that's when 'Connell and Jonathan
Imhotep spins around and faces them
Jonathan beams as he holds up the golden Book Of The Living
found it, Evy
found it Shut-up and get me off of here
'Connell grabs an ancient sword out of a statue's hand, jumps up onto a gravestone and leaps out over the Priests
The Priest-mummies stop chanting
The  vanishes
Imhotep steps forward
'Connell  the sacrificial knife out of his hand
Imhotep  a command
The Priests stand up, swords and knives in hand, they  'Connell
,  : Open the book, Jonathan
Open the book
That's the only way to kill him
'Connell  and  at the attacking Priest-mummies, fighting his way to Evelyn
The skeletal creatures wildly their swords, trying to  'Connell
Jonathan fumbles with the book, struggling to open it, -- he can't
can't open it
It's locked or something
'Connell  two of the mummies in half, then swings his sword down at Evelyn, --
One chain breaks free
Jonathan spots a series of  , -  along the binder
It hits him like lightning -- We need the key
Imhotep grins, then grabs the / hanging from a chain around his neck, rips it off and shoves it into his pocket He picks up the sacrificial sword and heads for Jonathan
What do  do, Evy
What do  do
Read the inscription on the cover
'Connell swings his sword down again, --
Evelyn now has one hand and one leg free
More mummies attack 'Connell force him back
Jonathan quickly starts translating the cover inscription, but his ancient Egyptian is clearly awful
Keetash-something, naraba-something
Jonathan starts to backpedal through the cemetery, clutching the golden book; wide-eyed, as Imhotep moves in on him
Ebarra im hatu Kashka ummmmm --
Jonathan trips and falls on his ass
Imhotep
'Connell  another chain
Only one more left holding Evelyn
Jonathan sits up and quickly looks back at the cover
Rasheem Aaaaa
Imhotep raises the sacrificial sword, about to kill Jonathan
And that's when the giant statue of Anubis suddenly through the wall -- shades of Ray Harryhausen
Only better
The god of Deaths, horrible, decrepit   stares angrily down
Jonathan stares back
Oh boy
'Connell  a mummy and looks up at Anubis
' This just keeps gettin, better and better
Imhotep leaves Jonathan and heads for the giant statue
'Connell leaps over and with one last swing of the sword, frees Evelyn from her chains
More Priest-mummies attack, forcing him away
Evelyn jumps off the altar and starts to head for 'Connell, -- a   grabs her
Spins her around
It's Anck-su-namun's rotted corpse
Evelyn reacts
Imhotep looks up at Anubis, points to 'Connell, and in commands him to attack
Anubis moves for 'Connell,  over mausoleums and through the detritus moat on his way
'Connell quickly backs away
' Do something, Jonathan
Kill it
You have got to be joking
Evelyn is backing away from Anck-su-namun
Finish the inscription, idiot
Oh
Anck-su-namun  Evelyn
Evelyn fends her off as best she can
Jonathan quickly looks back at the hieroglyphs on the book cover, fumbling badly under the pressure -- Ummm, Hootash im
Hootash im now what is this last symbol here
What's it look like
Anck-su-namun grabs Evelyn by the throat
The statue of Anubis corners 'Connell, reaches down and  him with it's 'Connell  away at it
Jonathan stares at the inscription, slightly oblivious
It's an Anck symbol, with two little squiggly lines above it, and a bird, a stork
on either side
Evelyn is being  by Anck-su-namun
Ah
Ah
Ahmenophus
Yes,
see
The talons lift 'Connell up and start to  him
Hootash im Ahmenophus
The giant statue of Anubis instantly freezes in it's tracks and
It's off balance
Starts to fall
'Connell slides free of it's talons
Evelyn  Anck-su-namun away, Anck-su-namun looks up and opens her fetid mouth to scream just as Anubis   on top of her,   to powder and  her into the ground
Imhotep  in rage and horror, then turns and angrily heads for Jonathan
Jonathan, sitting on his ass, quickly backpedals on his hands and heels
'Connell leaps to his feet, sword in hand and runs for Imhotep
Imhotep grabs Jonathan, lifts him up, rips the golden Book Of The Living out of his hand and pins him to a wall
'Connell runs up and swings his sword at Imhotep, --
Imhotep's right arm off
It drops to the ground, still clutching The Book Of The Living
Imhotep drops Jonathan and spins around, facing 'Connell
'Connell grins
' Okay pal, let's see how tough you are without your right arm
Imhotep grabs 'Connell with his left arm and  him half way across the cemetery
'Connell  into a gravestone, bounces off and crashes to the ground
He shakes it off
' Alright,
so he's left handed
Imhotep is already striding towards him
Jonathan lifts up his hand, --    /
He smiles at Evelyn
got it
Evelyn runs for Jonathan
'Connell  his sword and  a big chunk of molten flesh rot out of Imhotep's stomach
On the outside, Imhotep looks human, but on the inside he is still a rotten old mummy
Imhotep  'Connell
Knocks him twenty feet back
'Connell staggers to his feet
Imhotep is right there him hard with his left arm
'Connell spins through the air, into the side of a mausoleum
Imhotep approaches, rage in his eyes
'Connell gets up, quickly pivots and into Imhotep's head
Imhotep grins and  'Connell in the face
'Connell is thrown back, pulling his sword with him
He bounces hard off the mausoleum
Lands on his feet
Totally beat-to-shit
Knees buckling
He can barely stand
Jonathan lifts up the heavy gold book, -- Imhotep's severed hand still clings to it
Jonathan cringes in disgust
Evelyn yanks it off, throws it away, then start furiously working the key into the series of locks, unlocking each of them
Imhotep strides forward
'Connell backs into the mausoleum, swings the sword, Imhotep tries to catch it, -- it through his palm and deeply imbeds itself into his forearm
No matter, Imhotep rips the sword away from 'Connell and casually flings it away
The golden Book Of The Living opens with a
Jonathan holds it tight as Evelyn quickly turns the heavy gold pages looking for something
'Connell turns to run, but Imhotep grabs him by the throat and lifts him off his feet
'Connell hangs there, a dazed mess
Imhotep grins, says something in  , then starts to strangle 'Connell
'Connell chokes
About to die
Evelyn turns and faces Imhotep and reads an inscription: Kadeesh mal
Kadeesh mal
Pared oos
Imhotep pivots and looks at Evelyn, a look of sheer terror on his face
Then he looks over at the detritus bog
Which starts to  and
The   begins to open
And then suddenly       waft out of the black bog and  around the Priest-mummies
The mummies all collapse and turn to dust
And then the spirits attack Imhotep
Lifting him and 'Connell up into the air
Imhotep lets go of 'Connell, who falls to the ground
Evelyn and Jonathan fearfully stumble away from the spirits, Jonathan trips and falls and accidentally throws The Book of The Living into the detritus bog
Evelyn watches as the golden book sinks into the black putrescence
Jonathan looks like he's about to cry
Ten feet off the ground, the spirits  around Imhotep's body,   and   and slowly
Accompanied by the same strange   we saw at the beginning of the movie when Anck-su-namun was cursed
One last  , accompanied by a   , and Imhotep is spit out and thrown to the floor
He staggers to his feet, he looks perfectly normal
His body is completely intact
'Connell swings his sword
Imhotep jerks back
The sword scrapes Imhotep's chest, -- a swath of blood appears across Imhotep's chest where the sword hit him
Imhotep touches the blood on his chest, amazed and horrified
He's mortal
'Connell runs Imhotep through with the sword and shoves him backwards
Imhotep stumbles back and falls into the detritus bog
The sword still in his stomach
Evelyn and Jonathan run up next to 'Connell
They watch as Imhotep gently sinks into the fetid swamp, slowly dying
And then, just before his head goes under, Imhotep looks up at them, grins broadly, and says something in
Evelyn translates: Death is only the beginning
Imhotep's grinning face vanishes under the black bile
- Beni staggers across a chamber, straining under the weight of another saddlebag filled with treasure
He spots a large, ornate  sticking out of a wall
He throws the saddlebag over the staff and collapses against the wall
Exhausted
And then the weight of the treasure Which starts a massive  -
Beni-backs away from the wall, wide-eyed, filled with fear
Driven by tons of pouring sand
Beni turns and hauls ass out of the chamber
- 'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan look around as all the walls start to
'Connell grabs Evelyn's hand
' 'mon
He pulls her forward and all three of them race past sinking pillars
They duck as they run into a descending doorway
- Beni scampers down a passageway, the ceiling getting lower and lower until he has to crouch
And then he has to stick the  between his teeth and crawl on his hands and knees
- 'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch-run into the treasure chamber
Evelyn skids to a stop
Looks in wonder at all the treasure
rains down on them
'Connell grabs her again and quickly pulls her through the mounds of treasure towards a   on the far side of the room
The  of the sinking walls is deafening
Beni crouch-runs into the treasure chamber
'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race past him
He joins them as they run up a staircase
Heading for a  , which is already half gone, it's now only four feet high -- now three feet high -- now two feet
Jonathan dives through the narrow gap
Then 'Connell dives through, he spins around
Evelyn dives, but gets stuck in the middle, about to get cut in half
'Connell grabs her arm and  her through in the nick of time
Beni reaches through the narrowing gap with his hand -- '
'Connell grabs it, but it's too late
Beni yanks his hand back just as the top of the door  to the floor
Sealing him in
Beni quickly crawls back down the stairs as the ceiling  down behind him
He stands up and looks around with his diminishing torch
All the doorways
There's no way out
He's trapped
And then he hears something, and turns around
Over in the corner, a scarab-beetle stares at him,
Beni waves his flickering torch at the scarab and backs away
Go away
He stands in the middle of the treasure chamber as dozens upon dozens of scarabs boil up out of the floor around him
Beni is absolutely terrified
The scarabs start to move in
And that's when Beni's torch goes out
And then we hear Beni start  in horror and pain
And the scarabs  hungrily
- The temple  as 'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and a pack of stray camels race through the ruins right behind them
Chasing them out through the front gates
The whole place  ominously
They make it down the ramp as more ruins   behind them
billows out over the wall and into the air
our heroes and all the stray camels race out into the desert
: - 'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan stand in the middle of the plateau, surrounded by stray camels
They stare off at the sandy, dusty, volcano as it continues to -ominously
Well,
guess we go home empty handed
'Connell looks at Evelyn
' Wouldn't say that
Evelyn returns the look,  , and then she wraps-her arms around his neck and kisses him
'Connell returns it
Jonathan just rolls his eyes, snorts in disgust and climbs up onto a camel
When the kiss is over, 'Connell and Evelyn share a smile, then 'Connell leaps up into the saddle, reaches down, grabs Evelyn's hand and pulls her up behind him
Evelyn wraps her arms around his waist
'Connell and Jonathan slap the reins
'/ --
The camels start to move out
: to the saddlebag behind Evelyn, hidden under the closed back flap, -- we can see that it's filled with Beni's stolen
'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan ride off into the
