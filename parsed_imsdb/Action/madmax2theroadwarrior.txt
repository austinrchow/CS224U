Written by Terry Hayes, George Miller & Brian Hannant April 13, 1981 Flurries of dust and sand swirl around us as we move through an eerie, barren land
The only sound is the howl of a rising wind
Ahead something looms out of the storm
As we approach we see that it is the rusting remains of a massive oil pump
The wind drops to be replaced by the voice of a very old man

Two crossbow bolts are buried in its neck
