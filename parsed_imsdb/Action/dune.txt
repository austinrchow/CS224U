December 9, 1983 -- 1
- Also known as , home of the Fremen, former Zenzunni wanderers
1A
-   - to the dark eyes of the mysterious face of the   , who sits against smooth black rock
Her eyes are deep blue-within-blue and her skin is a haunting translucent white
Her voice as if in a great cavern
We are the secret of the Universe
Bi-la kaifa
We are the secret of the Universe
We know of spice
the spice called melange
the greatest treasure in the Universe
It exists on only one planet - ours Arrakis, Dune
We know of spice and the Bene Gesserit sisterhood's selective breeding plan of ninety generations to produce the Kwisatz Haderach, the one the spice will awaken
Bi-la kaifa
And now the prophecy
Silence
then a powerful low organ  resounding in the cavernous space
(') He will come
the voice from the outer world, bringing the holy war, the Jihad, which will cleanse the Universe and bring us out of darkness
He will have been born of a Bene Gesserit mother
-- The Reverend Mother continues speaking of the Prophecy, but we do not hear it
The huge wind organ louder and louder, obscuring her voice
The picture

- to: interior of one drop of water
The image changes subtly

-  - to a shot revealing the outside of the drop
There is a distant  and within the drop we can see the distorted image of a space ship landing on a sophisticated landing field

- '  - The  is surrounded by crowds of  in his Throne Room
Suddenly a  enters from a small door and quickly crosses to
warning begins
The Emperor turns nervously
Guards quickly begin to clear the large room
Several women are rushed toward us to a door beyond
One of the woman, , stops and turns back for a worried, caring look to her father, the Emperor
Father
-- Irulan
She sees that   are surrounding him now, speaking to him
Irulan turns and leaves
The Emperor moves away from his officers to the center of the now-empty room
He drops his golden robe from his shoulders
He stands in his elegant black uniform, thinking
The Reverend Mother is ushered in and the Sardaukar Officers leave her alone with the Emperor
(quickly) Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes
We felt his presence
shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished
Their minds are so
They move in strange directions
Yes
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things
must sit close to him
He will not permit anyone but me to see him
You must be outside this room
Do what you can
am your Truthsayer, my lord
(sensing something outside the room) He is here, my lord
Under the carved inscription "Law is the Ultimate Science", the doors to the Emperor's chambers slide open and   wheel in a forty-foot long giant black box
One of the Guildsmen addresses the Emperor through a translating device
#1 The Bene Gesserit witch must leave
-- The Emperor looks to the Reverend Mother
Leave us
Yes, my Lord
(after she has gone) We are alone
8
- '  - The Reverend Mother enters through doors and takes a seat on a chair just outside the door
She closes her eyes
9
- '  - Inside the Emperor's chamber, the - are arranging themselves in a "" formation around the box
Suddenly the box opens, slowly and beautifully revealing a huge, thick glass tank
Inside the tank floats a twenty feet long, much like a cross between a pasty, pale human being and a fleshy grasshopper
The tank is filled with swirling orange spice-gas, and Guildsmen continuously vacuum up the toxic chemical spills dripping from under the tank
Suddenly the Guild Navigator swims towards the Emperor
His head is enormous and fleshy, like a huge grasshopper head -- the eyes are totally deep blue
His voice is a high, fleshy whispering and an intricate electrical apparatus in the front of the tank translates into English and broadcasts it into the room
We have just folded space from Ix
(extremely nervous) Yes
How was your journey
(after a long pause) Many machines on Ix
new machines
Oh yes
-- Better than those on Richesse
You are transparent
see many things
see plans within plans
Is there a problem
Usually there is a problem when one of you makes a visit
No answer
(finally) The answer is within the problem
10
- '  - Outside the Emperor's chamber the Reverend Mother sits, her eyes closed, straining
11
- '  - '   - very blurred scene of the Emperor with the Guild Navigator
She is not getting the English version but a much different language version which is fascinating to listen to
lilting, sing-song monologue
12
- '  - see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding
see you behind it
Yes
The Navigator breathes the spice-gas heavily and swishes gently in his tank
You must share with us
-- The Atreides house is building a secret army
using a technique unknown to us
a technique involving sound
The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad
he could threaten me have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice
thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens
House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain
Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides
have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides
Yes
13
- '  - Outside, the Reverend Mother is seeing the scene mentally
She suddenly sees and flinches
14
- '  - '   - The Guild Navigator turns toward her and comes very close to her
We hear the Navigator speak to her
(to Reverend Mother, mentally) Reverend Mother
will give you the Tleilaxu Path
(
) (an excited whisper) chance for escape
But for whom
15
- '  - Can you hear me
If this visit has anything to do with spice
-- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank
The spice must flow
the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years
it has enabled you to live two hundred years
the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers
the secret side of spice
the water of life
16
- '   - (
) He shouldn't speak of this
15 gives the Bene Gesserit sisterhood the metaphysical ability to see beyond
to have superior powers
Our power to fold space is in the spice
Without us, your empire would be lost on isolated scattered planets
You would be lost
can assure you
Do not interrupt
Do not speak lightly of the spice
16 (
) Here it comes

- '  - We ourselves
foresee a slight problem within House Atreides
Paul
Paul Atreides
You mean, of course, Duke Leto Atreides
his father

- High on the rock cliff stands Castle Caladan, Its appearance us dark and medieval
There is a window on the seaward wall lit from within
25
-   - by a drifting glowglobe
Paul sits at an -shaped table studying filmbooks and maps of Arrakis and the Universe
25A
- We  vast star fields and galaxies
25 (whispering) Here we are now
nineteen light years beyond

- We  the galaxies move as we  a
(
) (whispering) beyond Epsilon Alangue
is Arrakis
We  on this, then we see Arrakis grow larger in the filmbook screen and we  it is a planet of vast deserts
25 (whispering again) It does look dry
25A
- The picture grows larger again, and we see the Arrakeen Valley
-- (
) Each day the palms along the outer wall of the Palace at Arrakeen consume enough water to sustain the lives of one hundred men
The palms were placed by the Harkonnens to flaunt their water wealth in front of the city Fremen
25 Where are the Harkonnens from here
25A
- The star fields and galaxies move slightly then
(
) (whispering) There
Geidi Prime and the Baron Harkonnen
the enemy
25 In the background,  grow louder, pounding on thick wooden floors
, and
enter
Paul has his back to the door
Thufir suddenly looks perturbed when he notices this
(without turning) know, Thufir, 'm sitting with my back to the door
Hawat suppresses a smile
(') heard you, Dr
Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall
Those sounds could be imitated
'd know the difference
Paul rises and turns to face them
-- (inner voice) Yes
Perhaps he would at that
My father sent you to test me
Music then
Thufir scowls
No music
'm packing this for the crossing
Shield practice
Shield practice
Gurney
we had practice -- this morning
'm not in the mood
(angered) Not in the mood
Mood's a thing for cattle and love play
not fighting
'm sorry Gurney
Not sorry enough
Gurney draws his knife
25B
- Gurney activates his body shield, sending a shimmering   around his body
He advances swiftly toward Paul
Paul snaps on his  , draws his knife and jumps back, collecting himself hurriedly for the fight
(his voice sounding strange through the forcefield) Guard yourself for true
Gurney leaps high, then forward, pressing a furious attack
Paul falls back
The shield edges loudly as they touch each other
(inner voice) What's gotten into Gurney
He's not faking
Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room
The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and  off one another
Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck
(strange shielded voice) Is this what you seek
(strange shielded voice) Good
the slow blade penetrates the shield
but look down
Paul looks and sees Gurney's blade at his groin
(') We'd have joined each other in death
However, you did seem to finally get the "mood"
Would you really have drawn my blood
If you'd fought one whit below your abilities 'd have scratched you a good one
Paul stands and snaps off his shield as does Gurney
25 Things have been so serious here lately
Yes
sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play
Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis
Arrakis is real
The Harkonnens are real
Thufir, Yueh, Gurney and Paul stare at each other for a moment in silence
Dr
Yueh moves forward and begins to take Paul's pulse rate and to collect other data with a small black machine
Dr
Yueh, do you have any information on the worms of Arrakis
-- have obtained a filmbook on a small specimen
only 125 meters long
Only
They smile at each other
There are have been documented sightings of worms as large as 450 meters in the deep desert -- far from where we'll be in Arakeen
The desert belt and the south polar regions are marked forbidden
Why
The storms and the worms
Is it true, that the sand can blow at seven hundred kilometers per hour
It can render flesh to dust in minutes
And these dry winds can generate tremendous static electricity in the atmosphere
Our body shields won't have enough power to operate in the open air on Arrakis
Well, how do the Fremen survive there
We don't know much about the Fremen
They live in the deep desert
some of them in the cities and they have blue- within-blue eyes
(smiling) The eyes -- yes, yes
saturation of the blood by the spice -- melange
Could the spice affect us in other ways
Many dangers exist on Arrakis
For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their  company contract so easily
(rising) The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes
but behind them,  suspect, is the Emperor
-- You will make a formidable Duke
Paul bows
(') Now remember
the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence
know
But if it is a trap then why are we going
We have our new army
(in the same breath) Dr
Yueh, put the weirding module on him
Thufir, noticing a    at the other end of the training room, calls out to them
(') Clear and lock the room
Gurney activates a series of locks above each doorway
(') Activate a fighter
25C Suddenly a   lowers from the ceiling
As the robot begins to rotate and go through several frightening, complicated movements, Dr
Yueh places a plastic device around Paul's neck
He tightens it around the Adam's apple above Paul's voice box
Paul turns and emits a very strange, powerful sound through the weirding module as he rushes towards the robot
(to Yueh) Precise control
26

through 26B
(Deleted) 27
-   - Paul walks down the stairway
In the distance, moving troops are packing Atreides belongings
Beyond, Paul sees some troops carrying a large bull's head
The horns are covered with dried blood
The bull that killed my grandfather
is this an evil omen
Suddenly,   appears from behind the giant black head
(happily) Duncan
Paul
(they shake hands) was on my way to say goodbye to you have to go on ahead
Why
wish you were coming with us
It's something for your father
He wants to talk to you
(places hand on Paul's chest) 'll see you in Arrakis
May the hand of God be with you
May the hand of God be with us all, Duncan
28
-   - Paul walks to meet his father near the wall
(diffident) Father
Thank you for joining me, Paul
(voice tired) It will be good to get to our new home and have all this upset behind us
-- 28A
(Deleted) 28B They look out over the sea
huge wave crashes below
The Duke turns to Paul
(') (inner voice) My son
(out loud) Thufir Hawat has served House Atreides three generations
He swears you are the finest student he's ever taught
Yueh, Gurney and Duncan say the same
It makes me feel very proud
want you to be proud of me
Paul smiles up at his father
The  blows the Duke's hair and behind him stands the castle and the green and black Atreides banner against the night sky beyond
The  starts again -- lightly
Paul takes a closer look at the Atreides banner moving in the wind
(studying the dark sea below) 'll miss the sea
but a person needs new experiences
they jar something deep inside, allowing him to grow
Without change, something sleeps inside us
and seldom awakens
The sleeper must awaken
Paul's attention goes to his father's hand where he sees the Duke's signet ring
Again he smiles at his father

Two moons rise in the darkness

33
-   - In a small stone courtyard, the back-lit figure of a woman moves towards us through the heavy  and darkness
As she nears us, the large, protective glowglobe overtakes her and in an instant we see a beautiful woman --
(inner voice) know she has come to test him
no man has ever been tested with the box
only Bene Gesserit women
may lose my son
The doors open, she meets the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam (the Emperor's truthsayer) and takes her back toward the Castle
The rain rushes loudly into the storm drains

Paul's eyes snap open
He hears footsteps outside his door
As the door opens he closes his eyes, however, and he pretends to be asleep
Jessica and the Reverend Mother enter and stand in the doorway looking at him
We'll salvage what we can
but  can tell you
dear God
for the father
nothing
Jessica turns to the Reverend Mother, stunned
She turns back to look at Paul
Her hands tremble
(') Did you really think that you could bear the Kwisatz Haderach
How dare you
My greatest student
and my greatest disappointment
He's awake
He's listening to us
(considering) Good
Ready yourself, young Paul Atreides
want to see you in your mother's chamber in one quarter of an hour
She turns and walks away
Jessica remains at the door and calls out to Paul in the darkness
Paul
This is very important
Jessica leaves, closing the door behind her
Paul sits up in bed
Kwisatz Haderach
For the father
nothing
35
'  -   - Jessica and the Reverend Mother enter
It is quite dark
Jessica  a code number and a glowglobe on a very dim setting
-- (angrily) Jessica
You were told to bear only daughters to the Atreides
Jessica
It meant so much to him
You thought only of a Duke's desire for a son
Desires don't figure in this
An Atreides daughter could have been wed to a Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach
We may lose both blood lines now
vowed never to regret my decision
'll pay for my own mistakes
And your son will pay with you
42
'  -   - Under a dim glowglobe, the  is writing a note on a scroll-like piece of paper
Finishing reading, the Duke seals the message in a cylinder and presses his signet ring, with a red hawk symbol of House of Atreides, into a hole, which seals the cylinder with a swift
He pauses, studying the metal tube
With a , he extinguishes the glowglobe above him
He leans back in his chair as lightning flashes outside the window
: 35 Paul enters the room and Jessica closes the door behind them
Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam
She is going to
observe you
(to Reverend Mother) Please
-- Jessica, you know it must be done enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace
Your Reverence
(inner voice) What does she fear
(out loud) What about my Father
Paul
please, Paul
listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you
Jessica leaves the room
The Reverend Mother speaks to Paul using The Voice, a Bene Gesserit training which permits an adept to control others merely by selected tone shadings of the voice
It sounds as if two people are talking -- one normal and the other gutteral and slightly electronic
The effect is strange, yet subtle
(using The Voice) Now you come here
Paul finds he cannot help but obey her, yet he fights her controlling him
(inner voice) She's using The Voice
(out loud) No
She sees him struggling
(inner voice) Some strength there
Surprising
(out loud) Come here
The Reverend Mother holds up a green metal cube
(') See this
Put your right hand in the box
Paul stares at the hole in the box
-- What's in the box
Pain
Just then, she raises one hand to his neck
Paul sees a glint of metal
He tries to back away
(') (The Voice) Put your hand in the box
Paul's hand goes in
Fear passes over his face
(inner voice) The Voice again
hold at your neck the gom jabbar
Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal
Let us say  suggest you may be human
Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts
Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box
If you do so you will die
You will feel an itching -- there
see
Now the itching becomes burning
heat, upon heat, upon heat
(whispering) It burns
(inner voice)(struggling to compose himself) must not fear
Fear is the mind-killer
Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration
will face my fear will permit it to pass over me and through me
-- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his
Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly
She is smiling
You feel the flesh crisping
36
- ' Paul's inner mind sees his hand on fire with all sorts of sores
The skin is bubbling
37
'  -   - Flesh dropping off
38
- ' He pictures this
The destruction of his hand is complete -- now only blood spurts out and burns
39
'  -   - Paul's face registers extreme pain
(cannot help the explosion) Kull wahad
No woman child ever withstood that much
must have wanted you to fail
Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human
Do it
Paul pulls his hand out of the box
No sign of anything wrong
He turns his hand, flexes his fingers
He looks to the Reverend Mother
(') (explaining) Pain by nerve induction
human can resist any pain
Our test is crisis and observation
see the truth of it
-- (inner voice) Could he be the one
Maybe
but will he be ours to control
(out loud) You know when people speak the truth
know it
Suddenly the Reverend Mother holds her hand against Paul's head
She closes her eyes
40
-   -  - ' She sees a blurred image of Paul's earlier dream
She sees the beautiful girl turn
She hears a muffled voice say "Tell me of your homeworld, Usul"
41
'  -   - Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams
only want to know one thing
Do they come true
Not all of them
know which ones will
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach
What is it
(profoundly) The person who can be many places at once
the one who bridges space and time
He will look where we cannot
Where
Do you know of the Water of Life
the Truthsayer drug
have heard of it
-- It is very dangerous
very painful
The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within
There is a place terrifying to us
to women
It is said a man will come
the Kwisatz Haderach
he will go where we cannot
Many men have tried
Did they try and fail
They tried and died
(she calls out loudly) Jessica
Jessica enters immediately and sees with great relief that Paul is still active
sense your teachings in him
Ignore the regular order of training
His safety requires The Voice
've heard enough of my safety
What about my father
heard you talking
You speak as if he was dead
Well, he isn't
Paul
She tries to hold him
Well he isn't
and he won't die
Tell me he won't die
What can be done has been done
Tell me

Closer,   bits of flesh, hair, and blood

The city now looms gigantic and overpowering -- millions of electrical cables stretch off the top into dark energy taps above the city

'  -   - In front of a huge steam boiler, the cable car stops and Piter gets out, steps down steel stairs and enters a porcelain room where the Baron is being treated by a  for sores on his face and body
The doctor uses a lasbeam on a big sore on the Baron's lips
The Baron is sickly and hugely fat and sweaty and looks like he has been sickly for some time
He turns to Piter as he enters the room
My Lord
Piter
Piter moves up to the Baron
The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and  have here your answer from Duke Leto
What does Leto say, Piter
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive
He does not wish to meet or speak with you
(swallowing; angry) made my peace gesture
the forms of Kanly have been obeyed
He throws down the cylinder
As you instructed me,  have enlightened your nephews concerning my plan t
-- My plan
The plan to crush the Atreides
Feyd, Rabban
go quietly
no other great house of the Landsraad must ever know of the Emperor's aid to the Baron
The entire Landsraad would turn against the Baron and the Emperor
Put the pick in there Pete And turn it round real neat
His assistant does so
Rabban breaks open a squood (living food)
The squood makes a tiny , then Rabban drinks the blood and bodily fluids
He throws the empty container of tiny animal meat into the dark water trough running through the center of the room
Across the room,    enter, holding big guns on a  who is wearing white pants
The Baron smiles when he sees the boy, who is deeply afraid
The guards force the boy to arrange violet flowers on a stand by the far wall opposite the Baron
(as the Baron watches the boy) You're so beautiful my Baron Your skin, love to me Your diseases lovingly cared for For all eternity
will have Arrakis back for myself
he who controls the Spice, controls the universe
and what Piter didn't tell you is we have control of someone who is very close to Duke Leto
This person
this traitor
will be worth more to us than ten legions of Sardaukar
Who is the traitor
(laughs) won't tell you who the traitor is or when we'll attack
However, the Duke will die before these eyes and he'll know that it is  -- Baron Vladimir Harkonnen -- who encompasses his doom
-- The Baron gives a hand signal and seven gates in the wall open, emitting tremendous
Suddenly the Baron begins to float straight up, twenty-five feet in the air
It is a frightening sight
He floats down under the giant, humming electrical tube light and rubs his head and body with a black fluid which drips from tiny holes in either side of the pink glow
Feyd and Rabban watch nervously
The Attendants stand completely still with fear
The Baron swoops down to the Boy, who stands petrified
The Harkonnen guards smile nervously as they step slightly backwards
The boy begins as the Baron pulls the boy's heart plug, located in his chest
The violet flowers are bumped and disarrayed by the violence which ensues
Then the Baron turns smiling to Feyd as the continue to roar

-  - We pass through electrical shields into a 2,000-foot high control room filled with orange spice gas
On the floor are large gratings covering an exhaust and filtering system
Tons of spice gas are being converted into the clouds of gas along a wall of machinery
From within a dark metal tunnel comes a Guild Navigator
He exits the tunnel and swims through the gas 1,000 feet to a six-dimensional layered miniature replica of the entire Universe
The Navigator emits a long piece of light from his mouth which travels to one edge of the Universe and changes into a likeness of the planet Caladan
The Navigator turns and emits another piece of light which travels to the opposite side of the Universe
It changes into a likeness of Arrakis
The Navigator begins to put his slender fingers in amongst the stars and he emits  and bursts of light into the mass of stars and galaxies
The Universe begins to vibrate and elongate, then to curve
Electrical lightening traverses from Caladan to Arrakis as the Universe bends into a -shape
Arrakis submerges deep into the light
The navigator swims to the point where Arrakis disappeared
He begins to pull and tear a hole in the Universe
Stars like sparks and  and rings of light appear, along with a roaring
The Navigator swims deep into this hole through the rings of light
The Navigator becomes more and more transparent, until he's lost in darkness

Guard #2 turns away from his controls but seems powerless to stop him
Once, it's off Jessica smiles seductively and writhes on the `thopter floor

The two men stare at one another a moment
Then Guard #1's hand, glinting silver, flashes into Guard #2's chest, killing him
Guard #1 pulls the knife out, smiling
The ornithopter begins to veer off into a dangerous nose dive

The blade cuts through the strap holding Paul's legs
Paul kicks upwards extremely powerfully and his foot breaks through the man's chest cavity and drives his heart up into his head, spewing blood out the man's mouth
Paul grabs the controls but it's too late

The weirding way has long been a Bene Gesserit secret
With my mother's help, my father isolated an element of the weirding way and externalised it
