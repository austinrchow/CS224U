The working class poetry of the `Burgh

He is followed by a cluster of other in the program and says his goodbyes
/
/`75  - Paddy grips the steering wheel with labor-calloused hands and drives over the
McArdle Bridge and up a winding hill
He listens to " " on tape as the last piece of daylight bleeds away
With rosary beads swaying from his rear view, Paddy turns and eases the Olds past row houses in a blue- collar neighborhood high above the city
- (28), hard miles on a handsome face, sits on the stoop of an old row house in a wool watch cap and winter coat
duffel bag is at his feet, a bottle of whiskey in a brown bag in his hands
He reaches into his coat pocket, pops a handful of prescription , and stares off into the approaching night
'  - Paddy pulls up to the curb in front of the house, clicks off the tape, kills the engine, and climbs out of the car
As he approaches the stairs, Paddy sees Tommy
Can't believe his eyes
Tommy
Tommy gives a drunken, crooked smile
(') What're you doing here
was just passing through
Figured why not have a belt with the old man
2
Father and son look at each other
It's obvious it's been a long, long time
Tommy takes a bemused look down at the car
(') She looks good
(patting car hood) Yeah, she's hanging in there
Well, you always did take good care of her
Paddy Conlon
Man of priorities
Paddy grins uncomfortably
Lets the remark go and climbs the stairs as Tommy reaches into his duffel bag and produces a fresh  of Jameson
He offers it to Paddy
(') Got a little something for ya
Mom always said never go anywhere empty handed
She did
But that's not for me anymore, Tommy
What
You change brands
Paddy shakes his head
Tommy looks at him
Paddy Conlon not drinking
What gives
'mon, let's go inside
Paddy pats his son on the back and heads for the door as a confused Tommy follows
: '  - Paddy and Tommy walk through the front door
The house is clean, yet all the furnishings are from the late 1970s
Tommy stands in the den and looks around, breathing the old place in, as Paddy makes his way into the kitchen
like what you've done with the place
3
(
) Appreciate that
The sound of glasses  in the kitchen as Tommy takes off his watch cap and begins to look around his old home
He glances down at a  on a table beside a weathered Barca lounge chair
There's not much of a woman's touch around here
(
) No more women for me, Tommy
Yeah
Must be hard to find a girl who can take a punch nowadays
Tommy takes another swig from his bottle and looks at a series of old  lining the walls as Paddy walks into the room carrying a coffee pot and saucers on an old wicker tray
Tommy looks at him, incredulous
Here you go
Coffee
You haven't seen a guy in 14 years and you're not gonna have a drink with him
told you, 'm off it
'm coming up on a thousand days
'mon, just one drink
No
Tommy shrugs
Takes another pull from his bottle and turns back to the photos
He takes them in

Tommy's eyes are drawn to another picture, likely taken at a mall photography studio, of a    (late 20s) (2)
The man looks like the second boy in the other photos
His brother
(') ( ) He's a school teacher down in Philly
Tommy's face registers surprise
(') Remember Tess
They've got two beautiful little girls
Tommy turns back to the photos and looks at another one of the woman
Obviously his
He puts it down, glances at the bible, then stares hard at Paddy
So you found God, huh
That's awesome
Mom kept calling for him, but he wasn't around
guess Jesus was down at the mill forgiving all the drunks
Who knew
Paddy sips his coffee
Says nothing
Tommy keeps pressing
(') So, you gonna ask about her, or you just gonna sit there all sober
know
Oh, you know
What do you know
Do you know it wasn't enough just to drive west to get away from you
When we hit the water we drove north, too
When  got sober  hired a man to find you
5
(taking a swig) Is that one of the 12 steps
Or does a guy like you get 24
Just the 12
Did your guy tell you what you needed to know
Just that your mother died in Tacoma
And you were in the Marines
That was all
That was enough
That's too bad
You could've gotten some good details
Tommy plops himself into a recliner
Glances at the coffee table, where a stack of classic books on tape sits (') You could've heard about her coughing up blood in a shit box with no heat
Having me rub her down with holy water, because she didn't have no insurance
All the while waiting for your pal Jesus to save her
Did your man tell you that
'm sorry, Tommy
It's good to know you're sorry, Pop
Goes a long way
Paddy chokes up
Tommy looks at him
Closes his eyes
(') think  liked you better when you were a drunk
An overwhelmed Paddy sips his coffee and looks at Tommy, who is fading
The pills are kicking in
He tries to open his eyes, but it's no use, and after a few moments he's out

Paddy glances down, where some pills have fallen out of Tommy's pocket and scattered on the rug
He watches his son
Relieved and heartbroken at the same time
' ,  - chaotic birthday party in the back yard of a middle-class home in the suburbs of Philly

She trains the camera on   (30), who sits in a lawn chair in a scarf, hat, and women's make-up
:  ,  (5), ,   (3),   - What's going on here
Well, 'm not sure, but  think Daddy is now a princess
Tess laughs
Brendan looks at her with a "Help me out here" expression
Em, you want to open your presents
The make-over ends abruptly at the mention of "presents
" Emily, little sister in tow, runs over to a table filled with gifts as  and  gather around
Brendan gets out of the lawn chair and follows Tess over to the gift table
Amidst all the presents is one , covered in pink wrapping paper, that is far larger than the rest
(') (off pink box) This an awfully big box
It's her birthday
Tess turns the video camera toward Brendan again
He couldn't look more ridiculous
And he obviously didn't clear the gift with his wife
He grins at her as she lowers the camera
7
() know, but that's why you call it a budget
You set it, and you don't budge
Brendan smiles in his make-up
Kisses his wife
'  - The remnants of the birthday party lay strewn across the lawn
Tess, in a cocktail waitress outfit, says goodbye to her  and the kids, who play on the swing set
She walks toward the garage and enters to find Brendan pressing free weights on an old bench
- Brendan continues to lift as Tess rushes in and tosses a bag of garbage in the bin
deep , hidden earlier by the make- up, is visible on his cheek
Hey babe, 'm late
Mom's saying goodbye to the girls
She's gotta get on the road
They've been fed
They just need a bath
'm on it
Can you get them down at a reasonable time tonight
They're exhausted
Brendan kisses Tess
Looks at her outfit
Where's the rest of that skirt
Babe
Listen, if any guys give you a hassle in that joint tonight you give me a call, okay
8
(off his cut) Yeah
Just like you gave me a call when those Temple frat boys decided to smash up your face
told you, most nights  sit on the stool and grade papers, but every now and then  need some action
Alright, well wait up for me tonight
'll see what  can do about that
Tess smiles flirtatiously and and heads for the car

Whoa whoa whoa
There's a lesson in this too,
Listen up
So we have a body at rest, and you have the bat which needs-- Acceleration
Acceleration, right
If you have enough acceleration, you have might have a chance to break the body at rest
Go ahead
Brendan, sleeves rolled up and a bemused look on his face, watches as Tito brings the bat down on the wood
As it in half, the other students cheer wildly
Tito smiles and leans the bat against a blackboard with "' 2nd " printed on it
(') There we go
Alright Tito, well done
Remind not to mess with you
Sit down everybody
Dial it down
As Tito high-fives his way back through the group, things settle down and the kids take their seats

Alright
The third law-- black student, , looks up from his desk

How many laws this dude got
() The dude
The dude has three
Newton the dude says that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction
Brendan looks toward the classroom door, where two red-and- white clad  are peering in, then walks over to , a blonde cheerleader seated in his class
She is working a Blackberry and doesn't notice him approaching
(') For example, if  does not stop the action of sending texts in class
Brendan stands directly in front of her desk
She quickly shoves the Blackberry under a stack of books
(') and tell her posse outside to beat it
He turns and shoos away the two cheerleaders peering in the window
(') then my reaction might be to send her down to Principal Zito's office
Thus setting our world back in proper balance
Mr
,  put it away
The class busts on  as Brendan walks back to his desk and sits on top of it
It's clear from the vibe in the room that he's a very popular teacher

Inside, a heavily-muscled  with a mohawk,    (30s), is putting a beating on his
The obsequious nature of the entourage makes it clear that Mad Dog is somebody important
In the ring, the sparring partner takes a vicious spinning back fist to the chin, goes down in a heap, and doesn't get up
(40s), clearly in charge, throws up his hands as Mad Dog laughs
Where do you find these girls
Colt climbs into the ring and looks at the fallen fighter
Glances at Mad Dog
We got a tournament coming up
You gonna kill every guy in the `Burgh
( ) Fenroy
Get me some ice
And call that Puerto Rican kid, the one that fights outa the Bottoms
If he's here in 20 minutes, he gets 200 bucks
Yo, 'll fight him
Colt turns around and looks at Tommy
As does Mad Dog, who smiles down at him from inside the ring
Do me a favor guy, go back to your bag
We don't need anybody else getting hurt

Take a walk
Tommy walks back to his bag
Mad Dog smiles
Looks at Tommy's outfit
Yo Rock, what happened
You leave Mick and Paulie at home today
Tommy stops
Walks back to the ring as Fenroy approaches

Then go through the list
Get me Joe Bones

Colt looks at Mad Dog
What do you think
The Mohawked fighter looks at Tommy
Shrugs

Colt studies Tommy
Sees he's serious
Gives in
( ) This guy sign a waiver
All good
What's your name
Tommy
You get tuned up in here, it's on you, Tommy
Sure, no problem
Come on in
Colt Boyd waves Tommy into the ring
Mad Dog's entourage starts whispering amongst themselves
Snickering at what lays in wait for Tommy as the fallen sparring partner is helped out of the ring
tapes Tommy's hands and gives him some  gloves
He slips them on, then at the sound of a  he starts moving toward Mad Dog, who smirks at Tommy's aggression and then starts circling him
Tommy nails him with a front kick to the chest

Gonna be a hero
Alright
He crouches down, gets serious
He throws a right
Blocked leg kick
Blocked
Tommy snaps his head with a jab
Then he does it again
And again
Then he   with a hard right, sending Mad Dog to the canvas to the shock of his entourage and Colt Boyd
Fenroy looks up from his post and walks over to the ring
Within moments everyone in the gym stops what they're doing and watches as Tommy grabs the back of Mad Dog's head, hauls it down, and launches knee after knee into his face
Tommy starts throwing Mad Dog around like a rag doll, striking him with vicious punches and kicks, as Fenroy pulls out his   and starts filming the action
As Colt Boyd screams at Mad Dog to cover up, Tommy shoves him against the ropes and blasts away
Tommy continues to pound
It's a full-fledged beating going on in there
Finally, he crushes Mad Dog with a vicious left hook and sends him sprawling through the ropes,
in the gym
What the hell just happened here
The entourage rushes to Mad Dog's aid, but he's out cold
Colt Boyd looks on in disbelief as Tommy walks across the ring and approaches him
You owe me two hundred bucks

They're mid-meeting and going over documents
This is the new appraisal figure, and this is how it effects the monthly
As you can see, that puts you upside down on your mortgage
That's the problem
It's the country that did the assessment, not the bank
So, the numbers are what they are, Mr
Conlon
Brendan

The numbers are what they are, Brendan
mean, you're a Math teacher, you can appreciate that

Physics
But the bank has got to go by the new appraisal figures
According to these figures, you're upside down on your mortgage-- You said that three times already
get that
But 'm asking you if there's something else you can do
Not the bank, you
Can you shift things around, restructure-- Well, you've already refinanced twice
Because you advised us to do that
presented you with that option
It was your choice
() 'm also showing you netted a substantial payout with the refi
We had that conversation

Taylor looks at Brendan
Takes him a second to remember
Oh, right
Sorry
Your daughter's

Heart
Heart, right

Brendan glares at him
So my option is 've got no options
You're not even gonna try to help me
am trying, Brendan
Look,  can get you 90 days to get even-- 90 days is not enough
My wife and have three jobs between us and that doesn't cut it
So, what do you suggest
Let me ask you a question: have you considered bankruptcy
It's a viable option
There's no shame in it these days
That's not how  do things
Well, then you're looking at foreclosure

Moore comes out bombing
Brendan dodges a couple of wild haymakers, then gets caught in the side of the head with a right hand
He stumbles back into the ropes and Moore presses into him, swatting at him with his huge hands

And figuratively it looks even worse

He said there's no precedent for this
You'll be back by next semester
Next semester
Tess sighs
They sit in silence
There are no easy solutions
Finally, Brendan speaks up
(') Look, Tess
They have these smoker fights all over
There's one in Lancaster next week
There's two in Dover the week after
Wilmington
Camden
Baltimore
It could keep us afloat
You're gonna put yourself through this over and over, for five hundred bucks a pop
Some of them pay a little more than that
() would have had to bounce for a month to make what  made in two hours last night
Brendan looks at his wife
(') And these guys, they're not real fighters
They're just guys who have seen too much  on
If you have a better solution, 'm all ears
Tess sits quietly
Knows they have limited options
What are we gonna tell the girls
It'll be fine
'll just leave the house as usual, except now 'll be going to the gym
They look at each other
No choice
This is the plan

'  - - Paddy climbs the stairs with a   tucked under his arm and a cup of coffee in his hands
He enters Tommy's room, which is also a monument to the past
Old wrestling , Steelers' posters, and an    that obviously once belonged to Brendan
() Oh the duck says quack and the cow says moo, and the old red rooster says cock-a-doodle-doo
Cock-a- doodle-doo
Paddy places the cup of coffee on the night stand as Tommy stirs, then sits on the empty bed and unrolls the poster
It's yellowed with age and covered with a boy's handwriting
:  1415
315 ,  1994 "   ,"   , : 1998, ,
2000,  ,
(') Look what  found in that disaster of a basement
Whattya say we sit down and update this sometime
You can fill me in on how close you got to that record
Tommy says nothing
Not a nostalgic bone in his body
The dreams on that poster are long gone
(') Did you continue wrestling after you left with your mother
() 'mon, Tommy
Tell me something
Yeah, 'll tell ya something
You can take that thing back to where you found it
And you can leave the coffee in the pot
can pour that myself
can wake myself up, too
Paddy's stung but covers it amiably
Hurt my knees coming up and down those stairs anyway

What's that

Who's "Mad Dog" Grimes
#2 Shit, Bradford
The stuff you don't know amazes me
( ) Oh my god, did you see that
: Bradford stares at the screen, his eyes widening as the Marines raise hell about the footage
Wait, rewind that
One of the Marines rewinds the video
Bradford looks at the image in disbelief, then races out of the tent
32
- Bradford hustles outside into the searing sunlight
- Bradford enters a barracks, where Private ""  (20s) plays cards with other
,  need to see the tape
What tape
The tape
drops his cards, rushes to his bunk, pulls out a steel container loaded with  and sifts through it
They are labeled by day and month

The sound of   fills the air
Let the music sink in to you
This is Beethoven

As Frank teaches, Brendan walks in the door
The great trainer notices him and walks over
33
(') Do  know you
think  know you
They embrace warmly
(') Long time, brother
Liking the place, Frank
Thank you, brother
(off Brazilian fighter) You see this beast
Marco Santos
'm training him for Sparta
Amazing, man
Come on back
The two head for the offices at the back of the gym
'  - They walk into an office filled with  of Frank in his fighting days
He was obviously somebody
The walls are also adorned with  posters
Frank reaches into a mini- fridge, pulling out a couple bottles of Vitamin water
He hands one to Brendan and motions for him to sit down
You look good, brother
How're the girls
Good
Good
had another little one
Rosie
know
Johnny
told me she was in the hospital for a bit
was gonna call, but then time went by
don't know
'm a piece of shit
should have called
It's alright
No, Brendan
'm sorry
34
It's all good
She's good now
Frank looks at his old friend
Smiles warmly
It's great to see you, man
So everything's going good
Yeah
Well, 've got a little problem
The guys at the bank want to take my house away
That's kind of why  came to see you, actually
Frank considers what he's hearing
've got most of my dough tied up in this joint, but how much do you need
didn't come here for a loan, Frank
() was hoping you'd train me
Train you for what
want to get back in the cage
Frank starts smiling
Leans back in his seat
Then he sees Brendan is not smiling with him
You're serious
just won an event the other night
Ah, you won an event
(off bruised face) That's what this is
Let me guess, it was in a parking lot
from the local radio station
Couple of ring card girls you wouldn't bang on a dare
Am  right
Brendan smiles
35
Ish
Ish
Brendan
love you
do
But why would  train you
When you were in shape and on the right side of 30 you were barely a
500 fighter
You never listened to me
You never listened to anyone
These guys are animals
mean, you're a teacher, right
What're you gonna do
You're gonna come down here for a couple days a week after detention
You're gonna skip out of the girl's volleyball game early
've got loads of time
Time's not an issue
The parking lot thing kinda got me suspended
need to keep working the smokers
Tess know about this
(off Brendan's nod) Yeah
`Cause the last time you fought,  got read the riot act sitting in a hospital waiting room
You remember that
No
was unconscious
The two friends share a laugh
She's not gonna come down here with the two puppies, screaming at Frank
It's not gonna happen
Come on
Whattya say, Frank
What do  say
What am  gonna say to you
No
mean, all my time is wrapped up with Marco
You come down, 'll throw you in the rotation, you spar with these guys, no problem
But  can't promise you much more than that, Brendan
36
That's all  need
Brendan stands up
Shakes Frank's hand
(') appreciate it
Let me know when you're coming down
( ) Well, 'm just gonna go get my stuff from the car
Now
Brendan puts his dukes up and smiles as Frank shakes his head
'  - Brendan pulls into the driveway of his modest home, gets out of his Camry, and looks to the street, where Paddy stands outside his Olds, leaning on the passenger door
Brendan carries a gym bag and wears work out clothes
He's clearly not happy to see Paddy, who stands there, uncomfortable and heavy hearted in the light of the street lamp
Hey, Brendan
It's me, Pop
What're you doing here
have some news for you
Something wrong with your hands
Paddy shakes his head, unsure what he means
(') If there's nothing wrong with your hands then there's no reason for you not to phone
That's the deal
37
Yeah,  forgot-- Phone or mail, Pop
Non negotiable
Paddy holds his hands out, palms down
Hey Brendan, have you ever seen my hands so steady
Have you
'm going inside
've got a thousand days thousand days sober today
Well, that's great, Pop
But it doesn't change anything
What do you mean it doesn't change anything
Have a heart, Brendan
Paddy's words set Brendan off
side of him we haven't seen before emerges
He approaches his father fiercely
You listen to me
You take your have-a-heart bullshit and you run it down the road
Run it out on someone who doesn't know you like do
'mon, Brendan
thought maybe we could break bread
Open some lines of communication
You got two lines of communication, the telephone and the post office
Just because you decide it's a special day, it doesn't make it one for me
got a wife and kids inside and they're waiting for me, so  don't have time for whatever this is
38
know you got a wife and kids in there
got a grand-daughter haven't seen in three years and another  haven't even ever met
Why is that, Pop
Why is that
Do you remember having anything to do with that
Paddy nods
Casts his eyes down in shame
(') That shit you pulled
Never again
And all the shit  saw growing up
That doesn't happen here
Brendan looks at the reformed Paddy, a measure of sympathy on his face
Then he heads for the house
(') Take care of yourself
As he's halfway through the yard, Paddy calls out
Tommy's back
Brendan stops in his tracks
He turns and looks at his Dad
(') He's in the `Burgh
Tommy's in Pittsburgh
He came to see me
He came to see you
He's over at the house
We're doing a little training at Fitzy's
Remember Fitzy's
It ain't Fitzy's anymore
Brendan walks closer
Incredulous
You and Tommy are training together
39
Paddy nods
(') Tommy Conlon
Riordan
He's using your mother's maiden name now
know what her name is
thought you'd want to know he's back
That's why  drove all the way over here
thought you came to break bread over a thousand days
That too
Brendan looks at him
Considers
Did he say if he wants to see me
He doesn't say much
He's just not that happy kid he was
Wow, look at you
Mister inside man
Paddy frowns
(') You and Tommy training together like nothing ever happened
This is unbelievable
Now  know what you're really doing here
What's that
You came to gloat
did not come to gloat
came to get my son back
40
Well, there you go
You got your son back
'm talking about you, Bren-- You got your son back
Brendan starts to walk away, then turns around again
(') You know, part of the reason stuck around was `cause  thought 'd finally get you all to myself
But you didn't have any interest in training me
Tommy was the one
Ah, Brendan
was a drunk
mean, you know
'm sorry
Forget it
You were always a front runner
You never had any interest in underdogs
But  was your son
You are my son
Am
Yeah, you are
'm just asking you to find just a little space in your heart to forgive me
Yeah
Alright
forgive you
But do not trust you
Tell Tommy this is where  am if he wants to see me
Alright
But they're not different things
You've gotta trust to -- Goodnight, Pop
41
Paddy looks toward the house, where Emily, Rosie, and Tess stand at the door
Paddy waves
My God, is that Emily
Boy, she's grown, Brendan
Is that Rosie
Brendan keeps walking
Opens his door to step inside
Daddy, who is that
Just some nice old man
Brendan closes the door, leaving the heartbroken Paddy alone in the yard

Universally considered to be the greatest pound for pound fighter that ever lived, the mighty, mythical Russian has never fought on
soil in his legendary career

When Colt sees Tommy approaching, he turns his attention away from Mad Dog
Tommy
Got some news for ya
got you into Sparta
Took some doing, but  made it happen
(off no reaction from Tommy) Thank you and 10 percent is customary
42
Tommy heads up the stairs toward the locker room without acknowledging Colt, though he does allow a small smile to crease his lips
- Tommy pulls a crumpled    out of a beat-up wallet and begins dumping change into an old pay phone on the wall
' ,  ,  - More of a shack than a house
(20s), a pretty but tired Mexican girl, watches a grainy  with a six-year- old  and a four-year-old  as the phone
The table it sits on has a   of Tommy and another on it, their arms around each other in the Iraqi desert

Fourth of July weekend in Atlantic City and you know what that means: the great Koba, bringing his act stateside
Let me ask you about the other guys
What are they thinking entering a winner take all tournament against a guy that seemingly can't be beat
( ) They're thinking five million dollars, and five million dollars is a lot of money, but they've gotta remember one thing: they're going against Koba
Mission impossible
Game over
Go home
Tess comes back down the stairs and looks at the screen, concern on her face
: " "

Brendan turns Marco and gets him in a knee bar

Calls out to Frank while jogging toward him
Coach
Hey,  know this isn't a great time
And it's too bad about Marco
But what about me
Brendan looks hopefully at Frank, who shakes his head as he begins to open the door of his `70 Ford Bronco
You talking about Sparta
Brendan, please
You got a better chance of starting a boy band
'll talk to you tomorrow
It's a grand prix tournament
Which means anything can happen
You know that as well as  do
Frank looks at him
Sees how serious Brendan is
(') They'll have to kill me to get me out of that cage
That's what 'm afraid of
Frank,  need this
You're real tight with those guys
You call them, they'll listen to you

You've been spending so much time with Brendan these days it's like you're part of the family or something
Yeah, he's right here

( ) Hey Frank
() That's unbelievable
can't thank you enough
don't know what to say
Alright, listen, 've gotta call you back
Alright, bye
Brendan hangs up the phone
Looks at Tess
50
(') 'm in
'm going
look of serious concern crosses Tess's face
She puts her hands on her hips
Really
So that's your decision
You decided
`Cause  really enjoyed that conversation we just had about making that decision together
Brendan doesn't say anything
Knows she's right
And that he's about to get laid into
(') You told me you were gonna fight guys that watched too much saw that Koba dude on , and he's the guy they're watching
It's a lot of money, Tess
don't give a shit about the money, Brendan
told you that
We're gonna end up cashing in your life insurance policy before we pick up that prize money
You don't think  can do it
think you can get killed
'm not gonna get killed
Fine, you're not going to get killed
But can you promise me you're not going to get hurt
You're not gonna end up in the hospital
You're not gonna end up paralyzed
We'll have no prize money
No house
Payments for -- 51
Tess,  can promise you this: if don't try, they're gonna take the house
How's that for a promise
No response from Tess, who has tears in her eyes
(') So, 'm gonna go,
But 'd really love it if you'd be with me on this
Tess looks at her husband
Wants to support him, but can't
'm not gonna watch you fight again
'm not
() 'm gonna get the girls breakfast
Tess starts walking back toward the house
She marches up the lawn without turning back, leaving Brendan, alone, in front of his house
He looks at the toys strewn across the yard
Surveys the neighborhood
He's going to Sparta
(
) Fourth of July weekend doesn't officially start until tomorrow
- Sunlight pours down on the crowded beaches, hotels, and boardwalks of
Thousands of  jam the outside of the majestic Boardwalk Hall
It seems as if everyone on earth is in town
(
) but fight fans are already descending on Atlantic City for the Super Bowl of Mixed Martial Arts, Sparta
heralding the arrival of the  tournament are everywhere
Ceremonial Fourth of July banners hang, cars jam Ocean Avenue, early  pop
The buzz is electric
The greatest show on earth has hit the shore

Announcers (40s) and   (30s) corral
for an interview
, you've made a fortune with your hedge funds, yet you turned your back on Wall Street and dedicated your life to making Sparta happen
Tell us, why is this tournament so important to you
Growing up, we all wanted to know who the toughest kid in the neighborhood was, right
wanna know who the toughest man on the planet is
That's why  put this together, that's what all these people are here to see, and come Saturday night, that's what we're gonna find out
Thank you,
And here's something fans never thought they'd see: Koba is here
The legend arriving to fight on
soil for the very first time
The great and mighty  emerges from a white stretch limo, trailed by his  of tough-looking
pop
swarm
It looks like a movie premiere out there and Koba's the star
- As  set up for the press conference and camera crews stake out their territory, Tommy and Paddy hug the corner of the room and wait
Not in their element at all
Moments later, Brendan comes walking through the doors
As he moves through the crowded room, Brendan and Tommy make eye contact
53
They haven't seen each other in 14 years, and judging by the looks on their faces they certainly didn't expect to see each other today
Paddy is just as shocked
Brendan begins to inch toward Tommy, but is intercepted by Frank, who was caught up in the media storm outside
Hey
Where'd you go
You can't leave me like that
They wanna talk to you, not me
Brendan looks past Frank
Tommy has risen and headed toward the exit, trailed by Paddy, who calls after him
- The sun descends over the boardwalks and hotels of Atlantic City, and sinks into the sea
- Paddy sits on a couch thumbing through a Sparta program and looks proudly at a  of Brendan
He listen to "Moby Dick" on his headphones as a  plays in the foreground
: ( ) the only fighter missing from the event was dark horse entry Tommy Riordan
: Paddy notices the picture of Tommy
Puts down the program and takes his headphones off
( ) (') Recent revelations that Riordan was not only a United States Marine but a hero in the Iraq War, has cast an even brighter spotlight on a fighter who seems to have come out of nowhere
() 54
( ) (') Lance Corporal Mark Bradford's web testimony to Riordan, who saved his life earlier this year in Iraq, is spreading like wildfire throughout the media
Paddy stares at the screen intently
Tommy
:      - ( ) the bridge just crumbled
The Amtrack was upside down
Water was coming in from everywhere
The water pressure was too much
We couldn't get the back hatch open
:
( ) (') We were all drowning, man
It was a death trap
Tommy walks into the room from the door of an adjoining suite and stares at the
( ) (') couldn't have had more than another minute
Suddenly the back ramp gets ripped off, and there he was
Before  could get out and thank him, he was gone
He just vanished like a ghost
Paddy is dumbfounded and looks at Tommy, who glances at him and back at the  before heading toward the door
'm takin' a walk
:      ' ( ) You saved my life, brother
Anybody seeing this at Sparta, anybody out in Pittsburgh, reach out to Tommy Riordan
Tell him Mark said thank you
55
:     ,
( ) Footage taken from a helmet camera on the ground captured the heroic incident
: Then the phone
Paddy grabs it
( ) Hello
() Brendan
- Brendan walks on the beach as the waves of the Atlantic Ocean lap at the shoreline
Boats bob on the water
Stray bottle rockets trace through the night sky
In the distance, the   of an amusement park flash and zip
Behind Brendan, the big casinos loom, advertisements for Sparta filling their
Brendan continues walking, then spots Tommy coming toward him
The brothers make eye contact
Stop
Then approach each other warily
Been looking all over for you
How's it going
It's going
was thinking maybe we could grab a coffee
don't drink coffee
Whattya want
You don't want to go sit down somewhere
'm good right here
56
Brendan looks at Tommy
Sees how rigid he is
long silence
Finally Brendan cuts right to it
Shit, Tommy
How was  supposed to know  was never gonna see you guys again
You were briefed
You had the information
You chose the old man and the girl
She wasn't some girl
married her
She's my wife
Brendan reaches into his pocket and removes a recent Christmas  of Tess, Emily, and Rosie from his wallet
(') (handing Tommy the picture) That's Tess
And that's Emily and Rosie
They're your nieces, Tommy
Tommy glances at the photo impasssively and hands it back
Don't know `em
know you don't know them
Of course you don't know them
Why am  looking at pictures of people  don't know
Because that's my family
And who are you exactly
'm your brother, man
You were in the Corps
What
57
said  didn't know you were in the Corps
wasn't in the Corps
Then you ain't no brother to me
My brother was in the Corps
With that, Tommy walks briskly away from Brendan and up the beach
His brother runs after him
Jesus, Tommy
was a 16 year old kid
What the hell did  know
don't know what you know
Why don't you go ask your girlfriend about it
She's my wife, Tommy
So that's it
stay with Tess and  never get to see you guys again
Not a single phone call
Nothing
No response from Tommy
He's a wall
(') God, man,  don't understand this
You won't forgive me, but you'll forgive Pop
Shit
He's just some old vet train with
He means nothing to me
From what  hear he means nothing to you, either, so you got balls talking about forgiveness
That's got nothing to do with forgiveness
've got a family to protect
Everything  do is for them
Tommy smirks
Walks away again
(') But  forgave Pop
Just like forgave you and Mom
58
( ) You forgave us
Yeah
'm not surprised you made the tournament, Brendan
You got some stones
fell in love, Tommy
What the hell was  supposed to do
You were supposed to stick to the plan
You were supposed to come with us
Mom needed you
needed you
You were my big brother and you bailed on me
The words hit Brendan hard
(') Hey, 'm glad you stayed and everything worked out for you, Brendan
See, you leave, you get the opposite
You leave, you get to bury people
You're not the only one who suffered, Tommy
didn't even know she was sick
never even got the chance to say goodbye to my own mother
You had no right to keep that from me
That was not your decision to make
You know what
You walk around with your pictures in your wallet and you're all,  forgive you, forgive Pop
forgive everyone
But you know what
You're full of shit
Tommy and Brendan are right in each other's faces
Standing on the knife's edge of violence
They hold the stare down for a few long seconds, like two fighters about to go to war
59
(') Are we done, Brendan
Are we finished
Tommy and Brendan look at each other with burning intensity
Too much baggage and both too much and nothing left to say
Finally, Tommy turns and walks on down the beach
,  - Sunny day
And a nearly abandoned school parking lot
- Nash, Tito, and  wait outside the Principal's office
It's quiet and aside from one , there's no one around
After a moment, Stephon comes walking in, and they all stand up and head into the Principal's office
'  - The kids walk in
Zito looks up and shakes his head
You realize you're supposed to seek my wise counsel when school's actually in session, right
All four of them laugh nervously
Working their way up to something
We want to use the auditorium this weekend to watch Mr
in Sparta
What do you say
Let me get this straight
You want to use the auditorium to watch a suspended teacher engage in the activity he was suspended for
Am hearing this correctly
() gotta talk to your parents
You guys might need to be in summer school after all
But everyone wants to see it
60
The gym's the only place that's big enough
It's never gonna happen
What if we get a petition
Yeah
We'll get the whole school to sign it
The power of democracy
Look,  appreciate that you guys love your teacher
really do
But there is nothing  can do for you
Zito turns and heads back to his desk
The kids, dejected, leave the office and walk off down the hallway
- The Goodyear , "  " blinking on it, floats over Atlantic City
explode majestically above Boardwalk Hall and fall into the sea, where hundreds of boats bob, televisions tuned to Sparta visible from many of them
cram the beach and boardwalk, crane their necks toward the sky, and watch the stunning pyrotechnics
In the streets, limos line up on Ocean Avenue
Even from a distance, the excitement and energy are palpable
(
) The roof is about to blow clean off Boardwalk Hall Arena
It might be Fourth of July weekend, but this is Christmas Eve for fight fans
This is Atlantic City
This is the War on the Shore
And this is what everyone has been waiting for
Enormous electronic  flash outside of the giant seaside casinos
On one, Koba hangs off the side of a ferris wheel and swats at smaller fighters buzzing around him in a replication of the iconic "King Kong" movie scene
61
(
) Sixteen of the baddest men on the planet duking it out over a 24-hour period for the largest purse in Mixed Martial Arts history
In the town everyone knows from the game of Monopoly, we've got ourselves a winner-take-all affair
Buckle your seatbelts, roll the dice, and take riiiiide on the Reading
Sparta
Is
Here
- Play by play announcer Sam Sheridan and color analyst Bryan Callen stand cageside
The arena is packed to capacity and buzzing with anticipation
Welcome, 'm Bryan Callen along with best-selling fight author Sam Sheridan
Sam, when
Riley conceived Sparta he wanted to create, quite simply, the biggest Mixed Martial Arts spectacle in history
Five million dollars, Bryan
Five million dollars
Riley put his money where his mouth is and put up the biggest purse this sport has ever seen
It's unprecedented, Sam
As is the hoopla surrounding Tommy Riordan, the war hero who has become an overnight sensation
'   - Tommy lays on the ground near the showers, collecting his thoughts
As Paddy watches a  monitor showing Callen and Sheridan, an  pokes his head into the locker room
Five minutes, Paddy
62
'    - Fenroy and a group of  gather around a  in the gym
very fired up group
(
) It looks as though the moment of truth has arrived, because here comes Tommy Riordan
: , - As Tommy makes his way toward the cage and the strobe lights sweep over nearly 15,000  , not one of them sitting
(
) Tommy Riordan's captured the media's attention, but the question still remains: who is this guy
And more importantly, can he compete in this talent pool
Can he win
(
) wish  knew, Bryan
wish  knew who he was, and 've gotta say the fact that  don't know is strange
In an internet age where there are no secrets, this guy is a complete mystery
can't find out anything about him
Tommy Riordan is officially Google proof
Tommy continues to storm toward the cage with a furious and focused look on his face
He seems to want nothing to do with Paddy
Training is over
It's time to fight
(
) You gotta love this guy, Sam
No walk out music, no sponsors, no interviews
He skipped out on the press conference
Wouldn't have his picture take for the program
He's breaking every rule
63
(
) The only reason that Tommy is even in this tournament is because of a video showing him beating up Mad Dog Grimes in the gym
(
) But the reason a lot of his fans are in the stands is because of another video, which is even more stunning than the Mad Dog Grimes video
Let me describe it for you folks for the few who haven't seen it, and  don't know anyone who hasn't, but Tommy Riordan ripped the door off a tank in the heat of battle, saving lives in the process, and then walked away without claiming a medal
He ripped the door off a tank
(
) Tommy Riordan is a genuine war hero, 'm not taking anything away from the guy
He's a very, very tough guy, Bryan, but the tank don't hit back
We've seen YouTube sensations fail on the big stage before
Tommy stands outside the cage and has Vaseline applied to his face
He looks like he's ready to murder someone
Sam
He ripped the door off a tank
- Frank holds mitts for Brendan as a  plays
(
) Tommy Riordan definitely has his hands full in his first opponent, Francisco Barbosa
Barbosa is nothing to scoff at
(
) Yeah, he's the real deal
Very tough guy
Very high caliber fighter
Tommy Riordan came out of nowhere, and  imagine he's going to disappear just as quickly
() 64
(
) (') Great story, but  think your boy is about to be exposed as a YouTube sensation

- Tommy and Barbosa face to face as   instructs
Gentlemen, you've been given your instructions
expect a clean fight
Obey my commands at all times
Defend yourselves at all times
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this
In the crowd, two sections of  in full dress uniforms wave flags and raise about as much hell as humanly possible for Tommy, who returns to his corner
Paddy attempts to give him some advice, but Tommy is not listening
(
) We're about to get the big answer to the big question: is Tommy Riordan for real
And here we go
The bell rings
And Tommy comes out fast and hard
(
) Barbosa's gonna be looking for a take down
(
) Definitely gonna be looking for a take down
There will not be a take down
Tommy ducks a blow, then levels Barbosa with a massive and brutal
The Brazilian's head snaps sideways, his  goes flying, and he does a face plant on to the canvas
It's over
(
) Barbosa is down
Barbosa has been knocked out
Tommy Riordan is most definitely for real
As the crowd erupts and Josh Rosenthal waves to Barbosa's corner to get a medic in there, Tommy marches out of the cage without waiting for an official announcement
65
(
) And now he's walking out of the cage
He's leaving the cage
There goes another rule out the window
'    - Fenroy and the boys fired up
They can't believe the ferocious knockout they've just witnessed
(
) Francisco Barbosa is out cold, and he is out of this tournament, Bryan
'   - The official pokes his head into the locker room where Frank and a nervous Brendan sit alone
Show time
On the  monitor, Tommy's annihilating knockout of Francisco Barbosa plays
Then, in the distance, the strains of can be heard
Brendan looks at Frank, who smiles and puts his hands on Brendan's shoulders
You can do this
He grabs the nervous Brendan's head between his hands
(') want to hear you say it
can do this
Then let's go do this
- in the crowd
Another fight close at hand
(
) Riley had less than 48 hours to fill Marco Santos' spot, and he basically had to rely on the word of Frank Campana
66
(
) And he chose Brendan Conlon, which quite frankly is something  just don't understand
Brendan and Frank walk down the tunnel toward the arena, where Paddy is waiting, his All Access pass around his neck
Brendan notices the old man as he approaches
Go get `em, son
Brendan barely acknowledges Paddy and keeps walking
Frank looks at Brendan with a "Who the hell is that
" expression
As they approach the dark lights of the arena, Beethoven continues to  out over the loud speakers
(
) can understand coming out to no music, by why in the world would you choose classical music for your entrance
(
) This is Beethoven, Bryan
This is Ode to Joy
(
) My apologies, Mr
Renaissance man
(
) You want to talk about renaissance men, you gotta talk about Frank Campana
Very unorthodox trainer, and one of the best in the game
He's well known for using classical music to train his fighters to remain calm, to remain patient, and to remain composed under pressure
Brendan and Frank make their way through the crowd and toward cageside, where Bryan Callen reaches beneath his seat
Classical music is about as fitting to this setting as Brendan Conlon is to this tournament
In fact, let me show you something
Callen holds up a plastic bag with water and a inside
67
(') This is Brendan Conlon
He's a feeder fish, and he's about to get dropped into a shark tank
Brendan gets greased up, then climbs into the cage

At least we've seen him fight before
He was in the
We remember him
remember him, too
remember him being very unmemorable

(
) When the brackets were announced, Midnight thought he'd be going up against Marco Santos
He's gotta be thrilled to be seeing Brendan Conlon standing across from him
Brendan stands in the corner and looks at the massive Midnight Le
Frank smiles at him
You asked for it
Brendan grins and looks out at the rabid crowd
68
(
) Brendan retired from fighting some years ago, he's actually a high school Physics teacher now, and Midnight had some fun with that at the press conference
(
) He said he was gonna give the teacher a serious lesson, and that getting killed was no way to spend a summer vacation
Josh Rosenthal waves the two fighters into the center of the cage for instructions
Alright, gentleman, you've been given your instructions,  expect a clean fight
Obey my commands at all times
Defend yourselves at all times
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this
The fighters head to their corners and wait for the bell
Have some fun, baby
At the sound of the bell, "Midnight" Le comes out hard and strong
He repeatedly  Brendan in the leg and batters him with
His power is overwhelming Brendan
'   - Paddy stares at the  monitor

Tommy lays on the rubdown table, his eyes closed
No interest in Brendan's fight

) This can't last much longer
This won't last much longer
The teacher just has no answers
Zito leans forward
He looks as if he's going to have a heart attack
'mon, Brendan, get outta there
- Midnight Le takes Brendan to the ground
Brendan tries to escape, but turns his back, allowing Midnight to sink in a rear naked
He puts the strangle hold on Brendan and squeezes his neck with his enormous biceps
Get out of there
Get out of there
Brendan tries to pry Midnight's hands off him
No use
(
) And now he's got the hooks in
20 seconds left
(
) The end is near
Can he make it to the end of the round is the question
Midnight squeezes for all it's worth as Frank screams at Brendan, imploring him not to tap
70
(
) 10 seconds left, and Brendan's face is turning purple
Conlon's whole world is about to go from day to night
Brendan is on the verge of going unconscious, but he refuses to tap out
Then the  blows ending the round
The crowd can't believe Brendan hung in there, and neither can Midnight Le, who slams the canvas in frustration
As Midnight walks back toward his angry , who expected him to finish Brendan early, the teacher heads toward a smiling Frank
Beautiful
Beautiful
He doesn't know what hit him
Brendan grins at Frank's positive spin on things, then looks across the cage at Midnight Le, who glares at Brendan
'   - The frazzled Zito continues to root for Brendan

From cageside, Frank  words of encouragement as the battle continues
Back and forth they go
Midnight rocks Brendan with a right hand
Brendan recovers and fires back
Then Midnight shoots in for a take down, but Brendan dodges him, reverses position, and suddenly takes a shocked Midnight down to the ground
The crowd is on its collective feet
(
) He's got a Kimura locked in
(
) Are you kidding me
71
Brendan locks up Midnight's shoulder
Applies pressure
The bigger fighter struggles to get free, but he seems to be trapped
From cageside, Frank screams, instructing Brendan on how to finish the move
(
) Midnight is in big trouble
(
) don't think he's got anywhere to go
(
) This isn't happening
This can't happen
Midnight  and the crowd
Shock and mayhem throughout the arena
It just did, Bryan
(
) Brendan Conlon tapped Midnight can't believe it
'   - Principal Zito leaps off his couch,  in celebration
'  (40s), drying dishes, pokes her head in the room as the Principal pumps his fist over and over
He tapped him out
He tapped him out
He did it
He did it

: (
) This is what makes Mixed Martial Arts so great
There's so many ways to lose
One tiny miscalculation at any time and that's it
(
) Frank Campana embracing his man, Brendan Conlon
don't think either one of them can believe what just happened
72
- Frank and Brendan embrace
The arena is
Midnight gets off the canvas, and Brendan approaches him and bows
The dejected Midnight bows in return
(
) Great show of sportsmanship from the teacher
(
) That's a hallmark of Frank Campana's philosophy right there
(
) Midnight Le is shocked
He thought he had a free pass into the second round, but instead he's going home
He dominated the fight the entire way, but fell prey to a very technical finish
Very technical finish, but come on, that's a fluke
jubilant Brendan raises his arms in victory
The crowd responds to the gutsy underdog
(
) You call it a fluke
call it a guy maintaining composure and waiting for his opportunity
(
) Conlon beats Midnight
As the celebration continues, Callen looks at Sheridan and shakes his head
Was he ever wrong
hope you got a receipt for your goldfish

She starts dancing around the room, kissing her phone

The whole thing is over in under 10 seconds
(
) That was quick

) Wow
Once again, Koba does not break a sweat

They look worried

The arena is on its collective feet  "Tommy

" As Paddy looks on and Tommy disappears into the darkness of the tunnel, the sound of cheering fades
78
- Dawn breaks over Atlantic City
- vacuums as an elevator door  and opens
Out comes Paddy
The casino is nearly empty, the only sounds coming from the tinny  of a handful of slot machines
From a distance, Paddy spots Tommy sitting at the far end of a bank of Triple 7 American Glory slot machines, mechanically feeding the slot from a tray full of silver and pulling the lever with a thousand-yard stare
Paddy approaches Tommy, who doesn't acknowledge him
Can't sleep, huh
Tommy feeds the machine and pulls
Says nothing
Paddy sits down in front of a slot machine next to Tommy
(') know that other thing's bothering the hell out of you, but 'm proud of you
What you did for that kid in the tank
That was really something

You're trying
Now
Where were you when it mattered
needed this guy back when  was a kid
don't need you now
It's too late now
Everything's already happened
You and Brendan don't seem to understand that
Let me explain something to you: the only thing have in common with Brendan Conlon is that we have absolutely no use for you
Paddy's shaken
He can't fathom the anger in Tommy, yet he knows he's responsible
It's written all over him
Tears well up in his eyes
They seem to make Tommy madder
(') Look at you
Yeah,  was right think  liked you better when you were a drunk
At least you had some balls then
Not like now
Tip toeing around like some beggar with your cup out
Take it somewhere else, old man
Tommy reaches down and picks up a plastic  made for holding coins and dips it into his tray, filling it with (') In fact, you know what
Here's a cup
Why don't you take this and go buy some more of your shitty tapes

Hard
God pity `em
All shall perish except me
You bastards
Stop the ship, you bastards

(') Ishmael
God pity `em
Stop the ship
Please stop the ship
Somebody help `em
Suddenly the adjoining door swings open
Tommy, hair disheveled, looks in and sees Paddy's state
The old man thrusts his hand up in the air and screams at Tommy
(') Ahab
You Godless sonofabitch
Paddy staggers over and gets in Tommy's face, his own face blotched and contorted
The old Paddy Conlon revealed
The monster from the past
(') You stop the ship, you Godless sonofabitch
81
There's no anger in Tommy
He simply walks toward the old man and tries to pry the bottle out of his hand
As he struggles to take it, the Walkman falls to the ground
Faint dialogue is heard coming from the earphones
(') Captain
Oh captain
Stop the ship
For the love of God
We're lost
The old man is running out of steam
He begins

You and your brother
My two boys
Tommy continues to hold his father as sunlight streams into the room

If it's possible, the  on the beach and boardwalk have swelled
It seems as if the entire east coast has descended on

Koba still swings mightily from the side of a ferris wheel, but now Tommy, in a camouflage superhero outfit, flies right toward him
On a collision course
Mad Dog Grimes holds on to Tommy's cape, trying to slow him down, and below the three of them, in miniature, is Brendan holding a sling shot

Alright gentlemen, you've been given your instructions

Obey my commands at all times
Defend yourselves at all times

In the center of the cage, Mad Dog is practically spitting in Tommy's face
Tommy's eyelids droop
He could not be less intimidated
84
It's not gonna happen again
Callen and Sheridan look on as the two fighters retreat to their corners
The anticipation in the arena is incredible
(
) Mad Dog predicted an early knockout
Said he was gonna knock Tommy out with one punch
(
) Let's see what Tommy has to say about that
Josh Rosenthal looks at Tommy and Mad Dog
Gentlemen, you ready
You ready
Let's go to war
(
) And they are off
Tommy goes after Mad Dog like it's the last night on earth
What Tommy did to him at Colt's Gym was an exercise in restraint compared to what's happening in that cage
(
) Tommy tackles him and he's on top
He's raining blows
(
) Someone has to stop this
Mad Dog is on his back and being pounded on
Tommy's rage is shocking, even by his own brutal standards
From cageside, Colt Boyd  at Josh Rosenthal
Stop it
Stop the fight
It's such a savage beating, so malicious, that Rosenthal has to climb on Tommy's back to get him off of Mad Dog
If his mother is indeed in the crowd, she couldn't recognize him now
Beaten to an absolute pulp
(
) That's the fastest knockout  think 've ever seen
(
) Mad Dog Grimes has been poleaxed
He is not moving
85
Tommy marches out of the cage and past Colt Boyd, Punkass, and SkySkrape, who can't believe what they just witnessed
Neither can anyone else at Boardwalk Hall
In the cage, a tends to Mad Dog

) 'll tell you what: you do that to someone on the street and they'd lock you up and throw away the key

) Brendan Conlon came into this tournament as a 1000 to 1 underdog, and now here he is in the final four

Buzzing in the arena
The lights about to go down for the entrance of Koba
Before they do, Brendan looks up to see a familiar face at cageside
Tess
He can't believe his eyes
(') You alright with that
Brendan looks at his wife
She smiles broadly
Mouths the words " love you
" Brendan grins
Kisses his glove and presses it against the cage
As he does, the lights go out inside the arena and ominous
(
) And here comes the great Russian Koba
(
) Koba is so intimidating
His reputation is larger than life
The crowd strains to get a look at the legend as he makes his way toward the cage
Brendan watches
So does Frank
Tess takes a quick glance at Koba, then looks away
She can't bear it

Don't take your eyes off him
Brendan nods, then looks at Tess
Drawing strength
Frank leans over the railing and taps fists with his fighter
(') 'm proud of you brother
This is your cage
Finally, the creepy music subsides, and the great Russian climbs into the cage
He's massive, and the crowd stares at him like an exotic animal

He's got nothing more to prove
He's already lasted two rounds against Koba, which is more than anyone else can say
You wonder what's keeping this guy up
Brendan drags himself off the ground and limps to his stool
Frank enters the cage
His usual positive attitude is gone
He comes at Brendan with aggression instead
