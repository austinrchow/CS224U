It falls open at her touch
Even though the hanging placard is still flipped to " " Rachel hesitates
Draws a shallow breath and steps inside
- All those sublime European antiquities now drip with menace
Celtic harp
Scottish targe
Brooding statuary
She moves deeper into the shadowed recesses, flicks on a lamp
Her gaze settles on the one exception to the impeccable order of things
An open wooden case, empty
Just the felt impression of a missing broadsword
(icy dread) Connor
She crosses to the foot of the staircase
Listens
spools a faint, tinny madrigal
She climbs the stairs, padding softly upward
The music grinds   in its maddening repetitions
Every so often, it's punctuated by a '
Rachel edges around the corner
Her breath catches in her throat

It's been cleaved nearly in half by the  that still juts hilt-first from the base of the splintered front panel

Rachel struggles to breathe

Let me see, Connor
Let me see
Rachel stands frozen, watching her life with Connor flash by in
teaching  to ride a horse
with  outside an English boarding school
In a train station
At her college graduation
and  in a laughing embrace that only hints at something deeper
In each new clip, Rachel has aged further
Connor has not
Rachel steps up to the broadsword, wraps both hands around the grip and jerks it clean of the cabinet
(flutterd to the floor like dead leaves) ,
and a   burns itself onto the screen in perfect digital clarity
Rachel
Staring back at herself, terror-stricken
She hadn't even noticed it before now
The tiny  on the shelf above the  with the glowing red light

Keep moving in on the  until the
shattering the stillness
The old rotary phone on the little Louis  stand
It's not just beckoning her
It's taunting her
Gathering up the photos and hugging them to her breast, Rachel slowly approaches the phone
Any second now, you'd expect it to stop ringing, nobody home
But  whoever's on the other end knows better
It keeps right on
Insistant
Trembling fingers reach out for the receiver
Slowly lift it off the hook
Hello
: is the last thing Rachel hears before-- -   - --a   blows out the entire second floor
Rachel Ellenstein is obliterated right along with her own treasured history
Linger on the  as we : -   (1565) - They crackle and twist in the fire that feeds off them
It takes a moment to realize they're -- oxen, pigs, goats, sheep-- piled like burning refuse
, -   stands astride the pile, engulfed in flame
Connor MacLeod and his young wife, , watch from the steps of their simple, isolated home
Connor betrays no emotion
Heather looks on in horror
My God, what are they
Farm animals
Dead of the plague
Why do they torment us with their dead cattle
(no response) Connor
They think 've brought this upon them
It's a warning
deeper fear now grips Heather
warning
They drove you from your home
They cut you off from your own people
What else could they want
Connor turns away from the flaming heap
Someone to blame
: swinging astride his horse
(dread) Don't go back there
in the distance
have no choice
Please-- They can't hurt me
And they know it
But they can still hurt the ones  care about
Heather looks off
Shivers
'm afraid
Connor leans forward, takes her face in his hands
love you, Heather
More than anything in this world
She grips his hands
Desperately
(cont'd) Do you believe me
Yes
Then you needn't be afraid
(kisses her) Nothing can ever keep us apart
: -  ,  - Connor travels a primeval landscape of jagged peaks and fog-shrouded valleys
' Nothing
: -    - He gazes down at the tiny hamlet of Glenfinnan, nestled between castle and shimmering loch
Breathes deep the forgotten smell of home
-  - , ravaged by neglect and despair, strokes her son's face as if confirming his reality
thought you might be the water horse come to take me on his back and drown me in the loch
(smiles) Maybe  am, Mother
(touches his hair) Then come, let me grab hold of your golden mane and off we go
Connor lifts her from the tattered bed, spins her around several giddy times and sits her upright in a chair
Not before we put some meat on those bones
He rummages through her shelves looking for food
Finds painfully little
(cont'd) No one comes to look after you
They're all afraid of me
They think  bedevil their children because 've lost my own
'm sorry
'm so sorry
Tiny minds and sour dispositions
don't need them, Connor
Any of them
Connor crouches at her feet
Then it's settled
You're coming with me
There's somebody  want you to meet
She's nearly as beautiful as you
Caiolin blinks back her disbelief
You're sure
(cont'd) We leave tonight
Let's start packing
(lifts up her shoes) 'm already packed
swings
stands in the doorway
He's strong and severe, dressed in clergyman's black
But that's not what draws the eye
Even though it's cold enough to fog his breath-- he's sweatinq
Connor looks up, guarded
Jacob-- You shouldna come back, Connor
Connor feels the tension in Kase's voice
Surely as a friend you can look the other way just this once
For old times' sake
You knew
You knew what would happen if you came back
am not to blame for this
What
(beat) What have you done
God help you
, the local priest and inquisitor, steps inside, bent over a silver cane
He's gross, corpulent and perpetually short of breath
nasty   figures prominently in his overall appearance
of varying stripe crowd nervously behind them
In the name of the Holy See and the rule of law, you are hereby charged, Connor MacLeod, with heresy and the practice of black magic
(turns to the villagers) Take him
The townsmen jostle in place, each trying to squeeze backward behind the other
(cont'd) (squints) Heresy is not contagious
Two of the bolder men move forward, gripping Connor by the elbows
Once its clear they haven't sucked up any demons, the others
-   - Caiolin  as Connor's dragged outside and driven to the ground by a relentless battery of sticks and clubs
: -   - Connor stirs awake in a centuries-old dungeon, a dark hole, crumbling and damp
seem to drip through the porous mortar
Taunting, vengeful, expectant
He crosses to the barred window that affords him a narrow, ground-level view of     where a well-attended  is now underway
Connor squints, craning to make out the identity of the condemned
mingle and mill in front of him, obstructing his line-of-sight
Even as    rises above the surrounding chatter
' The curse that afflicts one generation will invariably pass its mark onto the next
The ties of blood cannot be severed by word or deed, if in fact your blood is that of your son
Several villagers   to reveal: '  bound to an   atop a mound of shorn timber
siezes with the impossible horror of recognition
No
Makes the sign of the cross as he reads from a writ of execution
He stands atop a primeval   worn down to the form of a pedestal
Father Rainey wobbles behind him, sniffing ammonia to spell his chronic angina
Through the infinite compassion of our Lord God, you are entitled one final opportunity to renounce all that is unholy, to declare Connor MacLeod not of your loins and help put an end to the darkness that has been cast upon this land
How say you, Caiolin MacLeod
Caiolin lifts her head, pale and beatific
If your god should persecute me into the next world, then  shall simply have to find myself another
Shocked murmers of outrage shudder through the crowd
Kase steps up and   Caiolin's cherished silver , with its distinctive wooden Christ figure
(holding up Caiolin's crucifix) You won't need this where you're going
grabs at the iron window-bars
Shakes them until the mortar chips from their moorings
-  solemnly approaches Caiolin
Unseen by the bloodlusting crowd, he takes out a small leather sack and drapes it around her neck by the drawstring
He tucks it under her coarse woolen robe and pats it flush against her chest
(softly) Black powder
It will make short work of your suffering
Caiolin nods
He steps down off the pyre
Reaches for a
strains against the bars like a madman
Mortar continues crumbling until one bar actually
touches torch to kindling
It
tries to squeeze through the window gap
Too tight
So he winds back with the iron bar and swings with mindless fury
Iron strikes unyielding stone,  and
Heat ripples her face, distorts her body
hammers harder, quicker, louder
Bits of stone fly everywhere
But the bulk of it remains spitefully intact
Still, it's enough to convince    to intervene
They throw open the heavy iron door and descend upon Connor with swords and axes
>Wielding the iron bar like a battle mace, Connor splits the first guard's head, catches his sword mid-air and slices into the next
Third guard's axe catches on a ceiling beam
Connor runs him through like an overstuffed feedsack
The fourth guard drops his sword and
is now fully
Caiolin looks out through the rippling wall of flame
and smiles weakly
My water horse
splits the crowd like a battering ram
He reaches the pyre, hurling flaming timbers aside with his bare hands
Initially stunned, the townsfolk shrink back, watching Connor desperately scatter the fire
Caiolin buries her face in her shoulder, biting back the agony as
Sword in hand, Connor stretches upward, hacking away the ropes that bind her, oblivious to the fire now crawling in serpentine coils around his own arms and legs
Freed of the ropes, Caiolin begins to slump forward
Connor grabs for her arm as     in a  of  that renders any further hope of rescue futile
Connor stands atop the burning pyre, wicked tongues of flame leaping off his back and shoulders like fiery wings
He throws back his head and  to the heavens
Fire dances across Connor's skin and clothing as he raises his broadsword and steps down into the crowd
breaks out
This isn't just a common witch
This is one of Hell's very own
Those few foolish enough to attack are cut down where they stand
The rest scatter in mindless
Father Rainey blocks Connor's path
Lifts his cross
as he's   by the blind  of Connor's sword
Connor steps over Rainey's body and keeps coming, driving the mob fleeing into their dwellings
Kase crouches blustering over Rainey
Father
Father, please-- (tries to staunch the bleeding) Father--
Rainey's eyes open slightly
Who are you
Your son
It's your son-- Jacob
Rainey stares back as if a veil has suddenly been lifted
And what he now sees terrifies him to death
(eyes widen) Who are
'm your-- He stops
Rainey's eyes are frozen
Dead
returns to the flaming pyre, refueling his rage with the sight of his mother's blackened corpse
> scoops up a discarded sword, leaps to his feet and  , bellowing like a madman
>Connor whirls around with his sword, making Kase   on  the blade
Kase stares wide-eyed and gagging at Connor's smoldering visage-- the depthless black pools of hate that shroud his eyes
It's the last thing Jacob Kase will ever see
Connor opens his fingers and lets him , the sword hilt still jutting from Kase's chest
Gathering up several chunks of flaming timber, Connor  them onto the straw-covered rooftops, setting them instantly
In short order, the village is transformed into a giant swirling
Silhouetted against the crimson sky, Connor lifts Caiolin's body and turns his back on Glenfinnan for the last time
: -    - Standing outside the massive door is a  clad in dark, hooded monastic garb
Nothing in the panorama would suggest we've just jumped four  centuries into an uncertain future
Until-- chew their way up the rubbled slope
Fishtail to a stop
, a tall eclectically-dressed Jamaican, dismounts and approaches the hooded monk
You people are extremely hard to find
Monk unshoulders a -
We like it that way
(pumps shotgun) Now go
The other six  surround the monk
His eyes flick from one to the next-- a buffet of different nationalities, all big
Take your pick
Before you squeeze the trigger a second time, you'll be dead
Easy choice
Monk levels his gun and  the Jamaican right off his feet
And sure enough, he  before his next trigger-pull
very nasty   retracts into a wooden hilt
Monk drops in a heap as his assailant, a  , turns for the door, joined by the others
the heavy oak-and-iron door   with a  of  -- The intruders are   where they stand

They grimly regard the bodies

Just in case
Saws and cleavers are pulled by the other two guards while Guard #l keeps his gun trained on the corpses
Don't bother
Really
stands in shadow, his face
We catch only a brief glimpse of a
Guard #l whips his rifle toward the Stranger
Stranger diverts it with the tip of his sword
Bullets go nowhere
One slash and the guard is gone
Two more slashes and his comrades fall
Stranger kicks the body of the dead Jamaican as he steps through the open doorway
Dont be long
-  - through a maze of chambers and  into serpentine catacombs
He   a  into    cavernous and dripping, where even the air seems septic
few dim candles illuminate    bound to complicated, almost Giger-esque chairs
Arms, legs and faces have been immobilized by crossing flats of metal  into flesh and wood
From the wild overgrowth of hair and beard, and the impossibly long, curled fingernails, it's a good guess none of them have moved a muscle in years
Except for a pale  standing in a corner, trembling silently
Stranger stands at the threshold, his face obscured by flickering shadows
He scans the living corpses
So it's true
He moves slowly among them
(cont'd) What sacrifices they made of you all
Warehoused, like rotting pieces of meat
He pauses to lift up a downcast head
Gazes into the shackled face
The eyes are covered by strips of rusted iron, the face by tangled beard
(cont'd) Tell me-- is this the better way
'm sure you've had some time to reflect on it
One by one,  -  filter into the room, led by the Jamaican
Blood stipples their clothes, streaks their faces
But they are, in every other sense, fully-restored
Stranger straightens, swivels around to the terrified Custodian
Custodian backpeddles into the wall
Which one is Connor MacLeod
--  don't know
They never told me names
(low, seething) Don't
Lie
To
Me
swear
don't know
Stranger grabs him under the chin, lifts him to his toes
You need to understand one thing, my gimpy friend
don't care about the Game
don't care about the rules
don't even care about these other pathetic souls you lock away as a barrier to the Prize
The Custodian stares back, uncomprehending
(cont'd) (squeezes his throat) want Connor MacLeod
Give me MacLeod and 'll leave
And you can go right on pretending that what you do here actually matters
The custodian lifts a shaking finger
: Even with an iron slat across his eyes, he is unmistakably Connor MacLeod
Stranger lets go of the custodian, turns
Long time
Connor strains to lift his head
His voice comes weak and drug-heavy
Who are you
You'll know soon enough
-- : -  - An unearthly  pulses through slitted windows and cracked mortar
of   vein the ancient building, growing  until-- with a keening, animal-like
the sky responds with   and  of

Duncan snaps up the receiver, sweat drenched
Yeah
Tiny electric
then the  of an overseas line
' (filtered) He's dead
Who
: , In a driving
woman's hand holds the receiver to her face, obscuring her features
Connor MacLeod
He was killed last night
- ' Duncan reels with a sudden flood of emotions
Who is this

- The unidentified woman slowly lowers the receiver and sets it back in the cradle

perched atop the highest balustrade
, this one human
To many he'll be instantly familiar
Hes , oldest of all  Immortals, gazing down in quiet contemplation
Methos keeps staring at the ground below, sipping bordeaux from a paper cup, even as Duncan joins him at the edge
Methos
so-- What brings you up here to the aerie of the lesser gods
need your help
'm out of the help business
No future in it
was told Connor MacLeod was killed last night
Methos' darkens
Another one lost
(cont'd) just want to know who did it
(sighs) In our world, does it really matter
It does to me
Methos looks down at the clotted life below
Did  ever tell you  once kept a vineyard on the very spot where they built this monstrosity
Glorious, the wine
(looks up) When did you see him last
Almost ten years ago
What did you talk about
Nothing much
Think back
: -  (  1) - Connor and Duncan hunch over the bar, pounding scotch
We mostly just sat around, downing shots, staring at the beer lights above the bar
When he finally got up to go, he looked at me like it was the last time 'd ever see him again
No goodbye
No handshake
Just got up and left
: Duncan blinks back the memory
(cont'd) Nobody's seen him since
Describe the look
What do you mean
Describe it
It was like
: ' (cont'd) Like every death he'd ever caused had come back to haunt him
: Methos takes a thoughtful sip from his wine
For an Immortal who comes to abhor bloodshed, there's a solution-- a way to be removed from the Game forever
The price is unimaginably high, but you are, for all practical purposes, protected from the violence within yourself
It's called The Sanctuary
don't understand
Think of those Buddhist monks who came to cherish life so much that to step on a single insect, to harm a blade of grass was a violation of their creed
They placed themselves into an extreme form of protective custody
sanctuary of sorts
(beat) What 'm talking about is something similar
But one that doesn't allow for a change of heart
He opens his fingers and watches his cup plummet to the plaza below
Wine  like blood on white marble
(cont'd) Apparently it was wiped out last night
By who
don't know
-    - 747 cruises at 40,000 feet
(
) He left no witnesses
- 747 - Duncan stares out the passenger window as the   sets a  down
He lifts the little plastic   from the glass
Yanks it out of the olive
: being jerked from a fallen warrior
- 17TH   - swinging above a   -  that tramp across uneven ground littered with
at a - , swathed in the shredded colors of a defeated army
On a     -- , flailing in spastic fits
He blinks thickly, as if routed from a deep, disorienting slumber
Gapes up at-- that  the rising sun
You've better things to do than lie there collecting flies
Duncan puts a hand to his chest, touches the worst of his several lethal wounds
Utter confusion stitches his face
(cont'd) suppose you're wondering how a knock- kneed swordsman with your obvious lack of skill keeps living to fight another day
The figure extends a hand to Duncan
Duncan hesitantly reaches up
(squints) Are you an angel
've been called that
And worse
Duncans hand -- (cont'd) Rest assured, 'm neither
He hoists Duncan to his feet
Duncan gazes for the first time ever upon the face of who smiles back with the gift of untold secrets
'm Connor MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod
And like you,  have a hard time dying
: - 747 - Duncan's now sitting upright in his seat as the  '  brings him back to the here and now
(
) We'll be making our final descent into New York
down onto the runway at
: and see it's his passport, held by a
He lowers the passport and turns to the long metal case Duncan's brought with him from the plane
Would you open the case, please
Duncan hands the Officer documentation as he sets it on the counter and opens it
Inside is an old, meticulously cared-for Japanese
Customs Officer studies Duncan's paperwork, smiles
(cont'd) Get much use for this
You'd be surprised
Duncan shuts the case and continues on
Next  in line watches Duncan exit as he hands over his passport
Hang on the
We'll remember those steel- gray eyes
- ,  - Duncan watches the passing scenery
and familiar from the first "Highlander" sweep past
-   - - Cab  , leaving Duncan standing before the charred husk of Connor's antique store
Windows boarded, shreds of flapping police tape, the investigators have long since come and gone
- Door
Duncan steps inside
In the aftermath of the firebombing, nothing has been spared
Rachel and Connor's richly-cultivated collection has been reduced to a bitter moonscape
One can only shudder at the degree of overkill that went into this attack
Duncan climbs the back stairs to     which is even worse
Ash and cinder are virtually all that remain of Connor's home
Pausing at the far wall, Duncan yanks down an old charred tapestry, revealing deliberately hidden from view
He dips down, retrieves a key from under a loose floorboard and opens the heavily- reinforced door
he finds himself in a    surrounded by a staggering display of  drawn from centuries of personal history
We're looking at the sum total of Connor MacLeod's existance, stacked floor to ceiling
Duncan moves among the mementos, smiles as he lifts them; an old Scottish coin, pocket flask
a faded  of himself in a World War  uniform
He pauses at a painting of Connor's wife , radiant in simple peasant garb, smiling serenely across the ages
Finally, a tarnished epee that he wields with instant familiarity
: -  ,   (1627) - Duncan's  misses Connor by a mile
He stumbles upright in a grand hall streaked by  from floor- to-ceiling windows
Duncan and Connor face off with duelling swords, sporting black waistcoak andd knee breeches in the manner of the times
Several other elegant   spar in this most genteel version of the ancient bloodsport, a far cry from the corpse-littered battlefield seen earlier
little mustachioed  darts between the duellists with lint brush, pail and towel as Connor and Duncan re- engage in a rapid series of strikes and parries
You've improved greatly
You really think so
Connor executes a simple combination that sends'Duncan's sword flying one way, his body the other
No
'm just being gracious
Duncan recovers, sets his feet
Puffer skitters over, brushes the dust off Duncan's coat, dabs his sweat and puffs the back of his hair
Duncan swats him away
They take en-garde position
Connor points his blade
(cont'd) Remember, you're only immortal as long as your head remains attached to those shoulders
Duncan lunges again
Misses and hits the deck
(cont'd) Which in your case might not be long at all
He puts his blade to Duncan's neck
Humor evaporates
(cont'd) What we give up to our adversary in defeat, Duncan
is evervthinq
Duncan stares up at him, uncomprehending
(cont'd) We call it "The Quickening"-- our strength, our knowledge, our life essence-- it all flows into the victor, feeds him, makes him stronger, in ways you can't possibly comprehend
It's what drives other Immortals to kill us
And what forces us to be better-- smarter-- than the rest
He takes Duncan by the arm, jerks him to his feet
(cont'd) Survival
Learn it
Duncan goes on the attack
What he lacks in technique, he makes up for in determination
Almost
Connor sidesteps Duncan's next lunge, swats his blade flat across Duncan's ass and sends him plowing face-first into the floor
Duncan re-engages Connor in fighting stance
Puffer races up behind Duncan again, meticulously dusts his backside
Reaches around and plucks an unsightly piece of lint off his crotch with thumb and forefinger
(whirls around) You mind
Connor clucks his tongue
(cont'd) Allow me
He squares Duncans shoulders and steps back
Considers
(cont'd) Unh uh
He steps up and swivels Duncan around until hes facing the opposite way
(cont'd) If you should ever again find yourself backside to a blade
just keep this in mind
He proceeds to take Duncan through a move that's dazzling in it's inherent simplicity-- a move that winds up with Duncan's blade whisking perilously close across Connor's throat
(cont'd) It's a coup de fin
He catches Duncan's sword-fist in his own, holds it immobile
(cont'd) Properly executed, even you cannot prevent your blade from finding its mark
Properly executed, we'll never have this talk again
Duncan and Connor's eyes lock
They break
: - Duncan suddenly   with a strange disquiet and ringing in the ears known as
It's the sense of another Immortal
He swings around, reaches for his katana and steps back through the door, swinging it closed as appears at the top of the stairs
She saunters toward him, glancing around
She takes her time checking out the place before stepping up to Duncan
The ragged crop of her hair and the slashing trowel application of makeup impart a kind of crazed anti- beauty
Like a post-nuclear Barbi doll
Duncan regards her, intrigued and wary
Who are you
friend
Those two words instantly recall the mystery voice on the phone
(cont'd) Or lover
Or wife
Take your pick
Memory jogs with a sudden lurch
Kate
Atta boy
'cept 'm "Faith" now
Part of the makeover
Like it
She runs a playful finger across his chest
Funny how 'the time slips by, huh
You wake up one day and ohmigod-- Airplanes
Why're you here
Remember our wedding day, Duncan
do
She takes him by the hands and leads him into an impromptu dance
(cont'd) We danced the "Highland Fling
" She spins under his arm, circles back into his embrace
(cont'd) felt like we were flying
Her sinuous body moves in perfect sync with his
(cont'd) And that we'd never come down
She spins out of his arms again-- --and   him across the
spatters from his nose and mouth
(cont'd) Of course, we did come down
Didn't we
(kicks him again) Crashinq
Duncan staggers backward into a concrete stanchion
Recovers
They stand facing each other across a gulf centuries wide
(spitting blood) Why are you here
Isn't it obvious
wanted to see you again
Duncan tenses at-- His eyes track the
It's directly  him
- hop the curb,  through the open door to the antique store
- and  up the
- Duncan's eyes flick upward to a  , directly above him as-- -  - the   between buildings and
Knobby tires  onto the rooftop, squirrelling wild across the tarred surface before shuddering to a stop
jackbooted heel digs in and grinds to a stop
Biker suddenly  around,  through the and disappears inside
follow suit,   onto the roof like alien invaders
- Duncan reacts
But it's not just the full-throttle howl of approaching bikes
It's the  of approaching
now crest the stairs and fan out into the loft-- Same group we saw outside the monastery
Tricked out in everything from Keds to chainmail, they drag a variety of weapons in their trailing hands-- sword, baseball bat, mace, dao and chain-whip
The tips make a scraping noise across the floor that's deliberately unsettling
They surround Duncan, cutting off any avenue of escape
Nobody moves or speaks
Just the low staccato growl of idling two-stroke engines
Duncan takes a step backward
Looks to Faith
Who're they
More friends
from Bed-Stuy,  from Kyoto,  from Jamaica,  from Shreveport and   from nowhere in particular
And then there's
swaggering Immortal from the he's traded brute force in on a brand new weapon of choice
Make it pretty now
It's the bottom of the ninth
and  on Duncan, swinging their weapons to limber up
Duncan backs away
This is unheard of-- Immortals packing like jackals
What-- it's a team sport now
(zooming in) Whole new ballgame
They're good
Duncan's better
About three times better
jockeys his camcorder--    on Duncan
Sup with the new blood, huh
Who's gonna lay him out
Take his secret sauce
(swivels around) , Winston
, the tall Jamaican, stands off to one side watching, the lone holdout
(cont'd) Nope
Too proud
Old school
- Image lurches and jostles as Calvin mixes it up with the combatants
(
) How 'bout you, Carlos
You good for it
Carlos--
Lands hard
(
) 'll catch you later
: sparking off chainmail
pounding flesh
slamming into walls
And Calvin, catching it all, up close and personal
(cont'd) Sarge is down
Cracker Bob's down
But Carlos got some kick
Still got some kick
Carlos crawls to his feet, oozing blood and spite
(cont'd) Like the man says, you gotta play with the small hurts
Carlos -- Duncan lays him out flat again, then swivels around to face-- who straightens up to his full five-foot frame
(cont'd) Say hello to my man  and his ugly- stick
Bug brandishes a simple metal  with a woven grip
Nothing much to speak of
Until he squeezes the grip-- --and
The two on each end are  , one for piercing, one for slashing
Jutting perpendicular to the shaft, like an insane Swiss Army knife, are twin sets of -- two for stabbing and two sawtoothed
And then there's the shaft itself, if you're in need of a good old-fashioned battering ram
(cont'd) Like it
Came from a Tamaric swordsmith
(grins) Who smoked a lotta very wicked stuff
Bug opens up a multi-pronged  on Duncan
Duncan adapts to the first assault-- only to find himself reacting to an entirely new set of insane moves
(cont'd) Uhp--- Say welcome back to Carlos
Carlos cuts in yet again, swinging for the stands
He fans several times before Duncan backfists him across the nose and dumps him back onto the floor
Duncan spins back to Bug as the wiry Asian lifts his lethal metal rod again and grins
But this time as he  the release mechanism-- --Duncan  , shoving it flush against Bug's chest

He falls backward  like a stuck pig
freezes everyone in their tracks
That's enough
All eyes converge on: who stands at a distance, cloaked in murky halflight
'm sorry, Duncan
When it comes to discipline, the first hundred years are the hardest
Duncan lowers his katana, turns to the Stranger as-- painfully hauls himself upright and suddenly  Duncan clear through one of the immense loft windows
Duncan's launched  in a plume of shattered glass, still clutching his katana
Carlos hooks an arm around the empty window-frame and watches with unvarnished satisfaction as the body  onto an upright iron  jutting from the construction site below
What was that
(squinting) Full gainer with a quarter twist
Degree of difficulty-- not very
thought  told you to stop
Yeah, well

(cont'd) Are you challenging my authority
Carlos does his best to ignore him
(cont'd) Because the only way to challenge my authority is to kill me
(turns away) Hey hey, take it easy, man
(cont'd) Is that clear
In the split second it takes Carlos to turn back from the window, the Stranger is right there in his face
Shit
Stranger takes Carlos' sword and yanks it uo to his own neck -
(cont'd) Here's your chance
Carlos stares wide-eyed
Pride won't let him back down
Fear won't let him proceed
(cont'd) Take it
You won't have another
We can  the   of Carlos'
You're crazy, man
Am
Then go ahead
(rubs his neck across the blade) Stop the madness
Hey-- Or walk away
in perpetual fear of your own shadow
(beat) Tell me, Carlos
Can you live with that
Can you live with the fear
Can you live with the weakness
----- (cont'd) Weakness, Carlos
Isn't that why you're here with me
Isn't that why youre  here with me
Face it, you're nothing but

Blood  in Carlos' eyes

In one vicious -, Stranger cuts through bone and sinew, stopping just short of a clean sever
Carlos gags and gurgles in liquid protest
(cont'd) (whispers) They say the worst part, Carlos, is those last few seconds when you find yourself staring at your own headless body
-- He sends Carlos' head tumbling to the floor
(cont'd) Of course it's pure speculation, since nobody ever lives to tell about it
' staring in pure, unknowable horror at his own body, twitching several yards away

He's strapped to the same Giger-like chair, immobilized
Standing around him are hooded members of that same monk-like order in what is, essentially, a dungeon
One of them, , steps forward
His steel-gray eyes are familiar
He's the one who followed Duncan through customs
As he reaches to cinch closed one of the iron cuffs with a thick metal dowel, he reveals a distinctive  across his inner forearm
One that Duncan instantly recognizes
_ Watchers
Matthew simply nods
Watchers observe
They don't interfere
True
And we were more than happy to perform our traditional function
Believe me, it's a whole lot easier charting the history of Immortals than it is running a day care center for them
Unfortunately our role has changed somewhat
Why
Because the rules have been broken
Not by me
You're not the one we're worried about
Matthew moves to the other side of the chair
Pegs the arm cuff and ratchets down a redundant set of bindings
(cont'd) One of your kind has gone renegade
In doing so he's gained himself a sizeable advantage
One that will be impossible to overcome
Nobody's unbeatable
He's surrounded himself with Immortals loyal only to him
He uses holy ground as a safe haven
And every head taken in battle is reserved for him alone, each Quickening-- hundreds upon hundreds-- taken by just one man
Yes, Duncan
He is unbeatable
Matthew pours a Scotch
Glenmorangie
Holds it to Duncan's lips like the final offering to a condemned man
(cont'd) Worse still, far worse, is that he's become a perversion to the Game
And if he prevails, that perversion will resonate through everything we know
For eternity
In ways we can't possibly comprehend
Duncan tugs at his bonds
Knows what's in store for him
(cont'd) There must always be two of your kind
As long as there are two, and they're kept from fighting, the Prize is safe
The Sanctuary must continue
Get yourself another volunteer
We had a number of "volunteers
" Sadly, that's no longer the case
Another  steps up and forces an    down over Duncan's head
(cont'd) You'll be warehoused
Hidden away
So the Prize can remain safe
Duncan struggles frantically against his bonds
You're insane
For the world, Duncan
We do this for the world
The Watcher takes two large  and begins to screw the mask directly into Duncan's skull

You look like shit
How

Week, maybe longer
We can't talk here
(unstraps Duncan) We gotta go
Dawson reacts to the sound of
(cont'd) (urgently) Now
Can you walk
Think so
He takes one step and pitches forward onto his face
(cont'd) Potent whiskey
He clambers to his feet and follows Dawson out of the chamber
-  - Dawson and Duncan emerge from a nondescript cinderblock armory, an overgrown Cold War relic recently co-opted by the Watchers
They duck some scurrying guards, plow through thick underbrush to and climb inside
- ,  - You knew about The Sanctuary
Just because 'm a Watcher, doesn't mean 'm always in the loop
don't buy that
Dawson averts his gaze
Stares ahead
really struggled with it, y'know, the idea of keeping guys on ice like that
But  couldn't argue with the logic
Least not 'til they went after you
(squeals hard onto the main drag) Guess that put it a little too close to home
owe you
Dawson slides Duncan's katana out from under the seat
Hands it over
Do me a favor, buddy
Live to pay me back
What happened to the bodies
Dawson winces slightly
Keeps driving
(cont'd) 'mon, Joe
Listen--  got you outta one jam
Don't push your luck
need to see them
They're dead
Trust me
Was one of them Connor MacLeod
Yes
Let me see the bodies
The heads are gone
You really don't wanna go there
have to, Joe
have to know
Dawson jerks the car to a sudden shuddering stop
Alright
Alright-- If  tell you, that's it, 'm outta here
You're on your own
can't be a part of this,
Dawson stares at Duncan
beat, then: Fuck
'm a part of it
He throws the car back into gear and fishtails back onto the road
: of a forlorn and forgotten
Nothing marks its perimeter but a toppled gate and some trampled barbed wire
It was a Christian burial
Decent
They said all the right words
can't begin to tell you how reassuring that is
Pull over
Dawson pulls over
He and Duncan get out of the car
Needless to say, with a dozen unexplainable corpses, they had to go a bit off the beaten track
-  - From here it looks like just a barren hillside littered with broken and crumbling marble
Duncan and Dawson tramp up the shallow incline
(cont'd) What do you think you're gonna find when you get up there
don't know
'm not digging
Get that through your skull right now
Not these hands
Twelve freshly-mounded graves come into view, gouged into the rubbled downslope like wounds, each set off by a simple wooden cross
Duncan stops when he reaches the first grave
Stiffens
What
Duncan remains frozen, staring, seemingly at nothing
(cont'd) My dog used to do that with locked closets
hate that
Shh
Dawson listens
Nothing but the soft moan of
(cont'd) He's here
Tell me 'm not here for a seance
Duncan squints
Feels the
Slight, but unmistakable
: row of stunted oaks, thick and gnarled againt the setting sun
Standing against the trunk, silhouette on silhouette, is the ghostly form of a
Barely discernible, his features are hidden in shadow
Duncan slowly approaches the figure
Dawson hangs back, nervous and slightly twitchy
The figure steps up to greet Duncan
Sunlight brightens the face of who smiles as he embraces Duncan in the traditional bear- crush of Scottish clansmen
Sorry  missed your funeral
All told, it was a bit underwhelming
So it would seem
They break
The brief joy suddenly drains from Connor's face-- his eyes speak of diffuse, faraway suffering
Why are you here
Ten years ago you skipped out on a bartab
Connor's expression hardens
You need to know something
He steps up to Duncan, locks eyes
(cont'd) Every life  touch ends
Brutally
And for no reason
It's a curse that's followed me for centuries
can't outrun it and  can't outlive it
(beat) You're my last friend in this world, Duncan
left for your own good
It was better that you didn't know where
The Sanctuary
Yes
The Sanctuary
But you escaped
No,  didn't escape
as the  moves toward a shackled Connor MacLeod
(
) was freed
As before, the immobilized Connor stirs in a drug-addled haze
Who are you
You'll know soon enough
'  - All Connor can see is the Stranger's  as it reaches down and    from one of Connor's arm shackles
The cuff
Stranger turns away
beat later come the unmistakable  of  that fill the room to a

) couldn't see the slaughter
only heard it
: We can still see the agony playing out in Connor's eyes
He turns away, sees still standing on the ridge, swatting at the occasional deerfly
Who's he
The reason  didn't become your replacement
Dawson casually removes one of his legs and vigorously shakes it upside down
What's he doing now
Sand in the shoe would be my guess
Connor suddenly gazes beyond Dawson to and the
He stiffens
You were followed
One by one, a -  crest the surrounding hills and come to a menacing stop
Yeah
was meaning to tell you about those guys
Dawson fumbles to put his leg back on
Hops a full 360 as he watches the intruders surround them
approach on foot, following the same path Duncan and Dawson took
One is Faith
The other, The Stranger
Except he's no stranger to Connor MacLeod
Far from it
Connor goes rigid
Breathing stops
His nightmare's finally taken human form
for our first clear look at striding forward, bigger than death
His is a face hewn by Gods sharpest blade, every angle cold, remorseless, Puritannical
As before, he's clad in basic black, accented by the stark white of a priest's collar
(ice) Jacob Kase
Connor edges back his coat
Hand seeks out the grip of his sword
Duncan grabs his arm
Not here
Walk away, Duncan
Kase and Faith continue toward them
Connor's rage seems to ratchet up with every step
You're on holy ground
Remember the rules
Pure, radiating hate seethes in Connor's eyes
The rules be damned
Kase stops, inches from Connor's face
Cooly regards the sword
Look at you
You'd think after half a millenium, you'd learn to keep that you'd learn to keep that temper of yours in check
Gone is any trace of brogue
He's a fully-assimilated New Yorker now
Connor's fingers tighten around the swordgrip
Just tell me where, Kase
If all  wanted was to kill you, you'd have been dead a very long time ago, Connor
Something roils under Kase's controlled exterior
rage every bit as consuming as Connor's
(cont'd) But your death alone could never appease the innocent souls you slaughtered
'  being   by Connor's mindless fury
(cont'd) It couldn't even begin to appease mine
as he drops to his knees, gagging blood,   by Connor's blade
(cont'd) Worst of all, you murdered a man of God
Who raised me as his son
as Connor brings his sword   on him
(cont'd) and no punishment conceived by man can ever atone for that
Scattered wisps of smoke gambol across the demolished commons, leading up to the  of
(cont'd) What you never could have expected was that you'd leave behind this one humble servant
Kase's body lies there as cold as the Highland dawn
(cont'd) who would trade eternity itself to make you pay
snap open
And we're once again   : -  - Kase steps closer, revelling in this moment
Look back over the endless travesties of your life and you'll see me
Always there, waiting in the shadows
(beat) When friends and lovers are wiped from your sight, 'm there
(cont'd) When those you cherish die abruptly and for no reason, 'm there
(kicks a clod of dirt onto a grave) And when a handful of misguided and pathetic idiots just happen to share your own private hell
(shrugs) Guess who
He walks a full circle around Connor
All the while Kase addresses Connor, Faith never takes her eyes off Duncan
(cont'd) But if you think it ends here, my ancient friend, you're wrong
Very
Very
Wrong
Kase turns back to Faith
Pulls his sword and without warning  it across her throat
Faith reflexively , stumbles backward, leaving-- dangling on Kase's swordtip
as he swings it around and offers it up to Connor
Thought you might be wanting this
kept it for you
' , bound to the stake as Kase rips the crucifix from her neck
: Connor stares down at the crucifix now in his open palm
(cont'd) For old times' sake
Kase puts an arm around Faith
(cont'd) Want to find me again, Connor
Just put your hands together
(cont'd) (winks) And pray
He gives Faith a little shove and they both start downhill
gun their engines and ride off on billowing plumes of dust
Connor makes no move to follow
Strangely silent and impassive, he's like a warrior gutted by an invisible sword
Duncan puts a hand on his shoulder
Whatever it is
Connor swipes away Duncan's hand, starts walking
(cont'd) can help you, Connor
Connor stops, swivels back
Eyes dead
Nobody can help me
He walks off alone, a ghost against a sea of gravestones, -- Duncan watches his friend depart, helpless
Turning back, he sees stopped halfway down the hill
They seem to be arguing
Kase turns abruptly and strides off
She stands there a moment, sullenly rubbing her throat
Duncan's  spins her back around
(
) Problem
get a bit fussy whenever somebody points a sword at me
(dry) Goes a long way back
Their eyes fix on one another
Air thickens
Buzzes with electricity
Just one question
After all these years
(re: Kase) Why him
Faith glances down at Kase, who stands waiting at the base of the hill
Considers
Because 've never known anyone who had such an amazing capacity for hate
(beat) Except me
On that, she brushes past Duncan and rejoins Kase
: -  , 17TH  - Duncan and Connor ride side by side on horseback
They reach a where a   and her elderly  are detained at a crude wooden
Eight or nine disreputable-looking  surround their carriage
Connor rides up to what would appear to be the
He has the most teeth
What's going on
The lady here refuses to pay her toll
Toll for what
Passage over the bridge
Connor cranes his eyes, upriver and down
see no bridge
What do you think pays for the bridge
Connor considers, then turns back to the lady with a shrug
The man has a point
Despite her sweeping auburn hair and natural beauty, we now recognize the young woman as  from an earlier era
Her original name is
These men are liars and scoundrels
Theyve preyed upon us three years running
This true
good sturdy bridge is not an overnight accomplishment, Sir
Exactly what, may  ask, have you accomplished so far
(proudly) The tollgate
Duncan trots around the tollgate and up alongside Connor
He leans over to the highwayman
Excuse me, but by whose authority do you act
(holds up scroll) By deed of the King
Might  see that
Highwayman slowly unravels the parchment scroll
The nearly-illegible scrawl suggests random words copied by an illiterate
(cont'd) Does the King always sign his name with an ""
Highwayman's cronies reach for their swords
He was in a hurry
All eyes hover on Duncan's reaction
Two of the highwaymen edge around behind Catherine and her elderly consort, ready to gut them both at a moment's notice
Duncan tracks them with his eyes
(nods) Busy man, the King
(to Catherine) suggest you pay the gentlemen and be on your way
His deed is a fake
That's a matter of opinion
You, Sir, are no better than they
That's also a matter of opinion
(to Connor) Shall we
Connor sizes up his young protege'
Gives a dubious nod
Lead on
You can't just leave
You're right
He tosses a handful of gold coins to the Highwayman
(cont'd) Good luck with the bridge
He kicks his horse into a brisk trot
Connor reluctantly follows suit
They cross the river through ankle-deep water
can't believe you gave those bastards your money
It wasn't my money
Duncan pulls a cinched canvas  overstuffed with coins from his overcoat
(cont'd) It was theirs
the duped  scrambling onto their horses and riding hard in frantic pursuit
They hit the river at a gallop, kicking up giant shimmering fantails of water
(cont'd) By the time they reach us, the young lady and her escort should be safely out of harms way
The pursuers close the gap in seconds
Connor grins approvingly
Draws his sword and glances over at Duncan
Shall we
Duncan  his own sword, lets the hilt auto-rotate around his open palm and snaps it vertical
He nods back at Connor
Let's
Together, they whirl around to face the onrushing horde
in the middle of the shallow river
Nine maniacal thieves against two sporting Immortals
The spray of water, the slashing of swords and the pounding of hooves all build to an operatic crescendo
Duncan's improved since Ravenna
He easily scatters three of his adversaries before engaging the blood-crazed
This time it's Connor who finds himself in trouble
He tumbles from his horse and goes down, losing his sword in the river
suddenly winds back and  his sword at his opponent like a throwing dagger
whistles past the dumbstruck highwayman's head
Which was not the intended target
as we discover when we follow it's end-over-end flight
straight into '
Connor parries his attackers, drives them backward onto their asses, then swivels around and  the sword back to , who catches it, ducks the highwayman's next swing and swiftly sends him packing
recovers his own sword, which is enough to send the last of their attackers into a full-on, stumbling retreat
They both stand watching as jostles safely across the river
as she looks back at Duncan
She gives Duncan a knowing smile that's as innocent as it is seductive
(watching Duncan) You know that stirring in your gut
It's not just simple lust, my friend
know
Ah, but do you really
: as she and Kase drive away from the cemetery in a late model convertible
-  - Joe Dawson walks up to Duncan
feel like  stepped in on the wrong party
Duncan keeps watching the convertible until it disappears over the next rise
(quietly) Let's go
: -  - We recognize this place
It's where Connor and Duncan shared a last drink together
Duncan and Joe Dawson now hunch over that same bar, staring into their drinks
swear, the man's a walking ghost
-  - pound pavement
(
) (') Whatever it is he's carrying around inside him, it's like he's dead already
Glare of streetlights rake across Connor's face, his eyes fixed forward as if driven by a sense more powerful than sight
Connor bumps shoulders with a passing
Eyy man-- watch it
He continues on, oblivious
-  - Duncan turns to Dawson
There are things you do in this life that damn you for eternity
They can't be changed
And they can't be undone
You carry these things to the grave, Joe, in the hopes that maybe, just maybe, you'll find some peace there
Some relief, even if it's oblivion
(hollow smile) But Immortals don't die
We just go on reliving our sins
Over and over again
-   - Connor stops
Lifts his eyes to the light
stands before him in a bed of crawling mist
It seems eerily out of place amid the urban blight around it
-  - Duncan downs the last of his drink, shoves off from the bar
Dawson glances warily up at him
Where now
There were two places  figured Connor was likely to go
One of 'em was here
And the other
You're the "Watcher
" You tell me
-   - Connor climbs the steps, presses through the heavy wooden doors
- and prowls slowly through the dimly-lit interior
Icon  loom large and menacing
: He moves along the stations of the cross
: He's stalking through the nave
: Barging into the sacristy
- ' ,  - Dawson's car screams past with a doppler howl
(
) It's an old abandoned church just off Canal
- '  - Dawson's behind the wheel, gunning through narrow back streets
Perfect safe haven for a so-called priest, huh
"Our Lady of Sorrows
" (dry) Kinda has a nice ring to it
He fishtails around the next corner
Recovers
(cont'd) 'll tell ya this-- if he's going after Kase, he's in for a rude awakening
The man's untouchable
So they tell me
-   - Connor stops before the darkened altar, senses
stirs
Arms lift in the darkness
Jacob Kase steps down off the cross, lingers in shadow
would grant you absolution
If  were a better man
He turns and disappears out the back
Connor follows
Right past ' scattered throughout the pews, who simply track him with their eyes but make no move to follow
, the tall Jamaican, leans over to Faith
You know we're next, don't you
Faith lowers the book she's reading-- the Holy Bible
Looks up
What
Our days are numbered
You can see it in Kase's eyes
Do you believe in a hereafter, Winston
All  know is  won't be hereafter Jacob Kase gets through with me
And that's all  care about right now
Faith leans back against the hardback pew, closes her eyes
Yeah
: -    - Kase strides just beyond the perimeter of the church grounds, then turns back to Connor
Connor draws his sword, moves on Kase
The ancient samurai vowed never to draw blood in anger
It defiled their sense of purpose
(draws his own sword) Of course they're also somewhat extinct
He steps fearlessly up to Connor, places his neck against Connor's swordblade
just like he did with a certain late Immortal named Carlos
' He opens his fingers and lets the sword
It clatters useless to the ground
Would you slaughter an unarmed man of God again, Connor
Would that finally put your soul to rest
(low, taunting) Then go ahead
Send me home
with the rage pulsing through Connor's veins
(cont'd) What's stopping you
Guilt
The nagging sense that maybe you, more than , deserve to die
Dawson's car pulls up in the background
Duncan jumps out
(cont'd) Or somewhere along the way did you just lose your nerve
Connor's sword digs into Kase's neck
Breaks skin
(approaching) Don't do it, Connor
(gritted) Keep back
(to Duncan) You heard him
No Immortal can interfere with another's duel
He's playing you
Step back onto holy ground before it's too late-- Kase faces back to Connor
Go ahead-- what better chance than now
Take your shot
Don't listen to him
Do it
For your sweet mother
Caiolin burns at the stake
Suddenly startled, (cont'd) Your Huguenot bitch in Navarre
rears back,  Suddenly startled, the  bearing a   her to the ground, breaking her neck
(cont'd) Brenda Wyatt
("Highlander 1") is seen walking in
--     from behind
(cont'd) Rachel Ellenstein
is   in the antique store she shared with Connor
(cont'd) Tell me-- do they even begin to equal the devastation of an entire village
in Connor's hands
Kase presses his neck even harder against Connor's blade
trickles down his neck
(cont'd) So close
Soooo close
Duncan stands by, helpless to intervene
(cont'd) Look at you
Even now, you're afraid you'll lose
That's your true fear isn't it
(whispers low, seductive) Oh, it's not the dying, my friend
know that
That would be a blessing
It's the thought of giving up your essence to me
Making me even stronger by it
One look in Connor's eyes and you know he's right
(cont'd) What's wrong
(almost a purr) Don't you want to be inside me
Connor slowly  his sword
and  Kase's discarded sword back up into his hands
Kase simply smiles and takes position
Duncan can only look on helplessly as Kase takes the first offensive, driving Connor backward with dazzling -- almost casual-- swordplay
've taken more heads than you can possibly imagine
His sword whistles across Connor's face, opens a over his eye
(cont'd) Do you really want a taste of all those accumulated quickenings
Connor stumbles backward again, blinded by his own dripping blood
Knows beyond a shadow of a doubt he's doomed
Duncan knows it too
And it's killing him to watch
Still Connor won't go down easy
He manages a brief offensive, walking Kase backward on his toes
Kase puts one hand behind his back, fencing-style, and goes to work on Connor's torso, crosshatching him in blood
Connor lunges wildly
Kase parries effortlessly
Kase now opens up a   on Connor
It's like duelling against lightning, so quick and unpredictable are Kase's strikes
Constantly off balance, Connor still manages to  Kase in the cheek
(cont'd) (touches scratch) 'd almost forgotten what that felt like
Thank you
He now turns it on full
Drives Connor up against a wall and pins him with his swordtip
His eyes go impossibly cold
want you to think back to this moment in the endless nights ahead
And know that every time you close your eyes, from now to eternity, 'll be there
(beat) Ripping apart the ones you care about most
He removes his sword and steps back
(cont'd) It's not over, Connor MacLeod
It will never, never be over
He turns and walks back toward the church
Duncan does not step aside to let him pass-- their shoulders bump
(cont'd) You, on the other hand, are on borrowed time
He continues on, past the other Immortals who have gathered to watch the unfolding spectacle
One-by-one, they turn and file back into the church behind Kase
Connor stares into Duncan's eyes as if wanting to say something
Can't
Instead, he turns and starts limping out across the empty lot
Feeling the presence of another Immortal, Duncan slowly looks over at who stands at a distance
Watching him
As their eyes meet, she, too, turns and melts back into the surrounding blackness
: -   (17TH ) - onto a wooden table
He takes the table cloth with him as he  head over heels onto the floor in a cascade of soda bread and cabbage
Miraculously (unless you're an Irishman) he spills not one drop of precious Guinness, which he hoists in a cheery salute to: who sit laughing in the eye of an Irish hurricane
and   () -- aka "Faith"-- are a stunning couple that inspire joyful madness
Things have progressed nicely since their chance encounter at the toll crossing
Let's have at it
They kiss to a  of
So this time they
Crowd goes wild
and  with equal abandon, making it almost impossible to tell the difference
But they stop like clockwork for every new toast and testimonial
spears his mug into the air like a royal scepter
Happy is the bride that sees the sun
Sorry the corpse that sees the rain
framed in a perfect  of  streaming through an open window
: who smiles back with her own inner radiance
Bedecked in flowers, her brown hair sweets low over white lace shoulders and cream skin
She leans over   and kisses Duncan, provoking a new  of and
resplendent in their Celtic kilts, launch into the "Highland Fling
Kate is instantly  up onto her feet and into a
Before Duncan can protest, he's  from his seat and  onto the dance floor
Duncan and Kate link arms, goaded on by a circle of shouting, stumbling
With each new upshift in tempo, they spin faster and faster until they're hanging on for dear life
gradually blur into a queasy sense of vertigo
But for Duncan, it's not just the headstrong mix of drink and passion
It's the  of another Immortal
He spins to a stop as his eyes come to rest on who enters the room on a wave of silence
Duncan breaks away from Kate, crosses over to Connor and wraps him in a bear hug
About time
was beginning to wonder
was on a junk in the South China Sea when  got your notice
12 hours ago
How
Don't ask
Kate spins by on the arm of a new partner
You're next, Connor MacLeod
That better be no idle threat
Duncan watches Kate with a rapturous smile
Well,  finally did it
So it would appear
What do you think of her
You know that's not an easy answer
The edge in his voice is not lost on Duncan
(cont'd) Outside
-  - Connor stands with Duncan at the railing, staring out into the encroaching night
You know she's like us
Yes
sensed it the day we met her
So you know that, like us, her immortality can only be triggered by the shock of a violent death
Duncan looks off, as if purging the thought from his head
(cont'd) It's what makes warriors of us all, Duncan
Good or bad, there seems a purpose to it
Yes
And without such a death, she'll simply grow old and die like any other
Is that what you dragged me out here to tell me
Connor removes a uniquely-braided   from his vest pocket
It catches the candlelight with the glint of a thousand silken threads as he runs it lightly over his fingertips
Many years after  was married,  came home to find Heather sitting on a stool in the kitchen, with a knife in one hand
and her hair in the other
: , early-forties, her hair shorn to the scalp
She looks up at Connor with red-rimmed eyes and a bitter smile
(cont'd) At first  was scared
Scared that she'd gone mad
And then angry, as if she'd somehow meant to hurt me by it
: (cont'd) When  asked her why she'd done such a thing to herself, her answer cut me to the quick
She said it was the one part of her that would not age
It would forever remain the same as when  first fell in love with her
: burying Heather in a simple grave overlooking their home
Tears streak his face
He sinks to his knees in unspeakable anguish
(cont'd) And that's how she wanted me to remember her
: Connor closes his fingers around the braid
Squeezes
(cont'd) It's all  have now
love Kate
'll hold on to her as long as  can
That's all  can do
Kate can be seen through the window behind them, exchanging dance partners with dizzying abandon
If that's your intent, so be it
Duncan swings over the rail and hops off the porch
Takes to the ground in long angry strides
-   - Conner walks double time to catch up with him
Why are you telling me this
Because  once loved a woman more than life itself
And  watched her die
Unlike you,  had no other choice
And  have a choice
What would you have me tell her
'd tell her nothing
She wouldn't believe you
They never do when it involves themselves
Then  can do nothing
She's in the flower of her youth
Enjoy the moment and let it pass
If you think you can
Duncan suddenly grabs Connor's shoulder, spins him around
You'd have me kill her
Is that it
Is that what you came all this way to tell me on my
'd have you do what your heart-- and our conscience-- demand
Duncan settles
Searches his eyes
And if it were you in my place
Connor ponders
Then shakes his head
thank God  never had the choice
He listens to the faint strains of music and laughter carried on the rising
(cont'd) Tell Catherine 'm sorry  couldn't stay longer
He clasps Duncan by the forearm
Then turns and continues n down the cobbled lane leading from the wedding party
: -   - Duncan lies sleepless in a nouveau-stark hotel room, somewhere in the bowels of Manhattan
half-empty bottle of Glenmorangie is there for company
The door  , casting a single ribbon of light across the room
It  to
Duncan closes his eyes
Feigns sleep
She pads silently inside
Pulls the door closed
Duncan remains still, breathing heavily
The woman steals slowly up to the bedside
Pauses, as if quietly studying Duncan-- --then swings her leg up and straddles him
Even in the murky halflight, he can still make out the familiar painted eyes framed by a tangle of bleached hair
She says nothing, her expression lost under a veil of darkness
Only her rapid breathing betrays her tension
Instead, she suddenly leans forward and
Passionately
Duncan responds in kind
if powerless to do anything else
stitches the sky outside as-- They embrace
Bodies entwine with an urgency that builds with the raging outside
: -   () - rake the countryside as Duncan slogs imlessly through calf-deep mud
Still in his wedding arb, he's thoroughly drenched, as if he's been wandering this way for hours
-  - The last of the guests have gone or passed out beneath toppled kegs of ale
Only Kate remains upright, her face etched with sober dread as appears in the doorway, rivulets of water pouring off his shoulders and brow
For a while they just stare at one another, each lost to his own sense of foreboding
Kate is the first to speak
Despite her stoic veneer, her voice comes out small and terrified
If this is wrong, Duncan, tell me now
Saying nothing, Duncan slowly crosses the floor and takes her hands in his own
-  - flicker in the storm-fed drafts that whistle through closed windows
Kate lays Duncan's rainsoaked clothing across a nightstand then turns, regarding him naked for the very first time
Duncan reaches out to touch her
She trembles
Gently, as if unwrapping an object of unimaginable fragility, Duncan removes her clothing down to a simple floating chemise
Then guides her down onto a canopied bed encircled by a hundred fresh-cut wildflowers
clasp, fingers dig into skin
Whatever refinements Kate displayed in public are now happily abandoned
She arches up under Duncan, puts her lips to his ear
'll love you forever
On an  -- : -   - We're back in the present
Little has changed but the sheets
And the fury of their lovemaking
Each new  highlights a different aspect of their hunger-- their wet, glistening bodies     until the act itself becomes abstracted from any sense of time or place
stutter inside the lightning: coursing over cream-colored breasts and a simple pewter cross
similar in shape and color, that shift from painted to plain
that toggle between neo-goth  and natural pink
throws back her head, biting back the shudders of release
and sinks down into the bed with a drawn sigh
-   - darkens Kate as she sleeps
It lingers there, deadly still
stands over her, gripped by indecision
The fateful choice tears at him, even as he holds a  over her gently-rising chest
His hand
(softly) Forgive me
' as the
For an instant their eves meet
And in that single shattering moment, Duncan knows he chose wrong
It's not just terror that passes through Kate's eyes
It's the incomprehensible pain of betrayal
Kate gasps once, jerks and settles
Lies there dead, blood pooling across her nightgown
Duncan stares down at her body, numb
'm sorry
On that look we   : -  - The pain imprints on Duncan as if he's still clutching the knife
'm sorry
Whatever passion stirred Faith moments before is gone without a trace
Her eyes are as cold and empty as the dead Kate
You had no right
was doing it for you
For us
: -   - Kate    , eyes wild, insane
Duncan reaches out to her, which only sends her reeling further into panic delirium
She swats at him, punching flailing
Now you're an immortal
Like me
It was the only way
Words fall on deaf ears
She wrenches out of his grip
Stumbles for the door, drenched in her own blood
Leaves Duncan standing mindblown in her wake
-   - Kate flees through wet empty streets-- barefoot, nightgown ripped and bloody, face contorted like a madwoman
Breath comes in ragged, whimpering gasps
She trips, falls
Comes up running
: Faith climbs off the bed, throws on Duncan's shirt, whirls back, tears streaking her face like warpaint
You wanted this
never asked for eternity
You forced it on me
(screams) ,
Would you have really understood
Understood
Which part
The part about never having children
Or the endless, numbing sameness of it all
(bitter laugh) Or maybe you mean the part where you wake up one day and realize you're nothing but a whore racking up faceless affairs because whole lifetimes tick by so fast they don't even count anymore
She wraps her arms around herself as if to stem the escaping demons
Duncan remains silent, taking it all in
(cont'd) Here's the kicker, Duncan
came here for one reason and one reason only
To see if  could feel again
Anything
She walks out, leaving the door hanging wide in her wake
- Faith reaches for the stairwell door as-- --'   , holding it shut
(leaning in) 'm watching my best friend driven insane by something that happened four centuries ago
And there's nothing  can do to stop it
Because those people are dead and nobody can bring them back
Faith struggles to open the door
Duncan holds firm
(cont'd) But 'm lucky
You know why
Let go
'm lucky because my crime can still be forgiven
As long as you're still alive, there's at least the chance
It could take years
Centuries even
It may never happen
Faith is now   on the door
(cont'd) But at least  can still carry the hope inside me
That's one blessing of immortality
There's always tomorrow
He lets go of the door and steps back
(cont'd) Even for you
Faith shoves her way past him and disappears into the stairwell
: -   - stands on a , sword in hand, face upturned to the bitter heavens
Stinging  and  slash at his face
He doesn't even blink
: -   - Seen through a  , our roving  wends its way past a couple fixing junkies up to a where  hunkers over his bike making repairs
Kase's church looms in the background like a veiled threat
(
) Win-ston
Shut that thing off
(
) Hey, c'mon
as Winston slams his hand over the lens,
Calvin sets it down
Awright
'm out
'm leaving
You're out
You're out
You don't g&z out
Watch me
You saw what he did to Carlos
He's Genghis the fucking Hun, man
You live his way or you die your way
Be grateful you got the choice
Winston looks off
We could take him
Huh
Say how much you value your life
Forty-three guineas
Saw the bill of sale myself
Kingston Jamaica, August 14th, 1813
Sorry there, Cinque', but  got a bigger price goin on this unit
watched Connor MacLeod stand up to Kase tonight
Got me thinking
What about
That maybe my soul wasn't part of the deal after all
Calvin considers his point
You really think we can take him
The man can't stop a bullet
know that much
But  need your help
Yeah and who takes his head, huh
Gets that bucket fulla lucky charms
You, Mr Cool
(beat) Who's gonna be master then
- ' and that little glowing
-   - : as he reaches the crest of the cemetery ridge
He sags against a solitary windswept oak, slides down until he's sitting cross-legged at the base of the tree
Eyes wide, unblinking
stand those    from The Sanctuary, directly over their burial plots
Their heads are missing
looks on impassively
Even as-- now stipple the barren landscape
All headless, in period dress spanning untold centuries
The forgotten casualties of an endless, impossible war
Connor nods solemnly
Soon
He blinks
The specters are gone
: becomes  becomes
And still he sits there, unmoved, as if ready to embrace the rest of eternity from this one desolate spot
: -   - Connor remains sitting against the tree as slices over him
He slowly tilts his gaze upward
Squints
(
) There's supposed to be an end to all this, right
final answer
Duncan slides down next to him
Gazes out at the trackless ocean
Isn't that the "prize" we're all butchering each other to win
already know the answer
The "prize"-- the real prize-- is just to close your eyes and see nothing
don't believe that
You think the Game is still about good against evil
better world
Look around
Who among us really deserves to win
Not Jacob Kase
And who's going to stop him
You
Me
There has to be a way
Connor looks off
Nods
Oh, there's a way, kinsman
There's a way
But  don't believe you have the guts to take it
Try me
Connor stands up
Offers a hand to Duncan
Hauls him upright
Alright then
Duncan barely catches Connor's blade with his own
What're you doing
Don't you know
The better of us will take the other's gift
Pray it'll be enough
Duncan lowers his blade
won't do it
Then you'll die
Again, Connor
Again, Duncan barely escapes with his head
And settles into a fighting stance
It can't end like this
It already has
Goodbye, brother
He   '
Steel  against steel
Clansman against clansman
: -   - Faith sits in a center pew, head bowed, deep in thought
Or prayer
Hard to tell with somebody like Faith
Kase sits down beside her
You were with him
He curls his nose, as if he can still smell the sin
(cont'd) Woman is a temple built upon a sewer
Glad  can help you feel a bit better about yourself there, Jacob
Remember what you were when  first found you
whore
Now look
liberated woman
Fuck you
Kase runs a delicate finger across her neck
Be grateful  don't this minute remove your pretty little heafod
(looks up, cold) Holy ground, lover
It's a bitch, ain't it
: -   - Two figures dot the faraway ridge as the savage music of their swordplay  out across the barren countryside
, we watch these timeless warriors exchange strikes that would drive lesser men into the ground
Each gifted in his own way, neither gaining full advantage over the other
they both gradually succumb to
: Connor and Duncan finally lower their swords, panting and spent
(hollow rasp) Enough
(barely audible) Enough
And that's as much as either can say as they suck back great gulping lungfulls of air
little color finally returns to Duncan's cheeks
He mops his face with his sleeve
Next time  won't hold back
Nor
Dragging his sword like a half-ton barbell, Duncan turns and makes his way back toward the "resting tree
closes his eyes and
CONNoR (whispered) Remember well, old friend

Connor doesn't flinch
the instant before blade meets flesh
' The game is not about survival, Duncan
It's about living
In the end, it's all that matters
-- '
Duncan   as he follows through,  staining his blade with the crushing reality of what he has just committed
He sinks to his knees
and
The heavens answer back with ,  and    that seem to come from everywhere at once

through his skull, triggering : Walking with Heather across an open field
He turns and looks back at Duncan
' shine with a look of ultimate peace and transcendence
He seems to be gazing straight into Duncan's soul
And smiling at what he sees as-- through Duncan's
-  - : Duncan stands alone on the rooftop, stripped to the waist, moving slowly through an elaborate kata
The precision of his movement belies the chaos inside him
He windmills the katana over his head, faster and faster, until he suddenly  -- through the night sky, arcing out across the open space between buildings
Duncan watches its long, lofting trajectory
then takes off
He reaches the edge of the rooftop and
Legs cycling through empty air, he traces a matching arc directly under the far-flung sword
Like a long-jumper stretching for that last inch of sand, Duncan - for the next rooftop
- hits the edge-- digs in, pivots and sets
as the sword grip
Fingers wrap around the ivory hilt, slowly lowering it down to eye-level
and see a new Duncan MacLeod
Stronger
Deadlier
man cooly aware of his own destiny
: -  - Dawson's car pulls up to the generic cinderblock building that now stands unguarded and abandoned
-  - Dawson enters, squints into the darkness
The interior looks as if it's stood fallow for the last three decades
No giger-chair, no gothic restraints
No evidence the Watchers ever took up temporary residence here
Except for , who emerges from the stale halflight to confront Dawson
'm a bit surprised to see you again
All things considered
Dawson just stands there, hands plunged inside his coat pockets
(cont'd) As you can see, we had to move on
Find a new Sanctuary
It's wrong
What you're doing
It's inhuman
Ah, but they're not human, really
Are they
Gimme a reason, Matthew
It's for the good of us all
You know that
Gimme a reason
Matthew cocks his head like the  dog
Because we must
It's that simple
And if you get in our way again, there will be very serious consequences
Gimme a good reason
Matthew pulls a gun
Aims it at Dawson's heart
'm sorry to have to do this, Joe
He pulls the trigger
as   pound into his chest
Matthew topples backward, dead
Dawson palms the gun still concealed in his coat pocket
Nods
Reason enough
: -    - Kase is roaring through narrow streets in a low-slung convertible, Faith at his side
With utter disregard for speed or care, he guns it madly in shrieking turns
- , Faith grips the dashboard two-handed
Slow down
Adrenalin's good for the sex drive
'm not amused, Jacob
She reaches over and slaps on her shoulder harness
Thought maybe you needed a little more excitement
You know, spice up our relationship a bit
He , caroms off several parked cars, recovers
(cont'd) mean, isn't that why you went back to Duncan MacLeod
The risk
don't know what you're trying to prove
Kase puts an arm around her shoulder
Why do  have to prove anything to you
as his foot flattens the accelerator
(cont'd) can have anything  want already
Except me
And that bugs the shit out of you, doesn't it
Not really
it's clear he'll never make it, he's going too fast
Kase only smiles
Releasing the wheel, he stands in his seat, lifts his arms above his head and  in exultation as-- --the car  into the wall
It's all over in a breath
Accordioned metal, drooling radiator, and Faith, slumped over the dash
Kase lies sprawled and battered on the pavement, thrown some distance from the wreckage
He's clearly taken the worst of the impact
stirs and slowly wrenches herself free of the smoking mangle of steel and plastic
She reaches back and pulls Kase's sword free of the wreckage
With single-minded determination, she limps over to Kase's body, face-up in his own pooling blood
disbelieving  pauses in shock
Faith gives her a twisted smile
Don't mind us
Pedestrian   as Faith lifts the sword over her head and brings it   across Kase's neck
With inhuman reflexes, Kase awakens and catches her wrist in the same heartbeat
Eyes narrow
Does this mean it's over
: - '  - Kase steps up to the back entrance, alone
hangs slightly ajar, which clearly disturbs him
-   - Kase enters the main room to find Calvin and Sarge asleep on their pews
He kicks the first pew, awakens both with a start
Who left the back door open
Huh
Kase looks to Sarge
dunno
Where's Cracker Bob
He was supposed to be watching the back
Calvin and Sarge both shrug
(cont'd) (sotto) Infants
He whirls, stalks out
- Kase enters his dark, cluttered office,  the door behind him
and stops cold
from a small wooden table
right through  , who lies skewered to the tabletop
is Caiolin MacLeods unique silver-and-wood
The message is not lost on Kase
' suddenly flutter open
First thing he sees is that sword hilt sticking rudely out of his own chest
Ah-- Ahhh--
Shut up
He reaches forward and  the sword out of Bob, and with it impaled on the blade
It bears just one word, scrawled in Bob's plentiful blood
Bob sits up on the table, wild-eyed, as Kase calmly opens his fingers and lets the paper slide from his fingers
: -  ,  - Glitter lights and milling tourists
Row upon row of gimmicky Italian restaurants
-  ,   - Jacob Kase and his acolytes dine at a long table set against a gaudy backdrop of faux Roman ruins, babbling fountains and plastic holly
It all imparts a whiff of "Last Supper" pomp to the proceeding
Which is not lost on the other Immortals, who glance around warily while eating, as suspicious of each other as they are of Kase
Nor does anyone miss the fact that there are no windows in this particular room
He stares into his pasta, beading sweat
his fingers curl around the cold steel of a
38  wedged between his knees
He inches the gun upward toward the table rim as
Kase suddenly stands up in the center

All heads turn
Gun freezes in Winston's lap, just hidden from view
(cont'd) see tonight as a celebration of the spirit
(raises his glass) Here's to all of you who continue to stand by me
(smiles at Winston) even those who might waver at times
Winston stiffens, fears that Kase is on to him
And when Calvin averts his gaze, he knows
Still, he raises his glass
As do the others
(cont'd) You are my flock
You nourish my soul
It's now or never for Winston
His moment of truth
Kase's eyes slowly drift over to meet his
, Kase tips back his glass and drinks, eyes locked on Winston
Winston responds in kind, gulping down his wine as he slips the gun back into his pocket
He shoves off from the table
Excuse me
Where you going
Toilet
Sit sit
'm not through with my toast yet
Can't wait
He angles for the door
'm almost finished
Sit
Winston reaches for the doorknob
Locked
He swivels back
Sees death in Jacob Kase's eyes
His death
(cont'd) It'll all be over in a few more seconds
cold spike of fear shoots through every single one of them
as Kase continues
(cont'd) Youve all been a part of a great quest
four hundred year quest for justice
He lifts up an exquisitely-crafted sword
(cont'd) And here, my friends, is the instrument of that justice
It's called the "Colichmarde
" Finest sword known to man
The blade  upright
(cont'd) Blessed by Popes and baptized in blood
only break it out for special occasions
He kisses the perfect cross formed by the juncture of blade and quillons
(cont'd) It sings like an angel
Just listen
Winston jerks for his gun
In a   of  and , Kase beheads Winston and dispatches the next two of his stunned acolytes with blinding efficiency
coil up and around Kase's body
But he keeps right on coming
The others scatter like roaches
off walls and ceiling,  ,
before  with the   that is now Jacob Kase
His sword  through the remaining victims, trailing
One after another, they drop headless to the concrete, triggering - -
into Kase front on
His knees
Hits him , buffeting him one way as him from the opposite- side, rocking him back center and   inside an omni-directional  of    that
: -   - , enshrouds the rocky highlands
Somewhere along the invisible coastline below, a foghorn
The skeletal remains of an ancient Gaelic  loom spectral gray above who stands before an    (familiar from Glenfinnan's town square) revelling in the changeless land of his birth
(calling out) Where else could stir the blood of a Scotsman too long of this earth and too far from home
Kase picks his way across the uneven ground, unable to see beyond the reach of his own arm
(cont'd) (filling his lungs) can nae get enough of it
He draws his sword, extends it outward until the tip disappears from sight
taunts him from somewhere out there in the slow-drifting whiteness Kase's sword  toward the
Just the   of a    inside the fog
Ah, what's this
Hamlet's ghost
The  melts back into silent nothingness
(cont'd) 'm afraid even the cloak of fog won't help you overcome a sizeable disadvantage
spins him around to see looming over him from a narrow stone outcropping
Kase masks a slight tinge of concern
(cont'd) It's always good to see two fellow clansmen banded together in a common cause
But  hope you haven't sunk to the level of a simultaneous ambush
Once again, the figure steps backward into the enveloping fog
Disappears
Slightly unnerved, Kase jerks around
No sign of anyone
Just that infernal mist
of  against  swivels him back around to his original position
His nerves are starting to shred
He turns several full rotations, craning for a glimpse of his tormentors
And then he sees it
Kase  for it
And this time, it doesn't retreat
Swords  in thunderous overture as battle for position on tenuous footing
drives his adversary backward into a   , leaving him no avenue of escape
Their swords   and Kase suddenly finds himself    -- You can sense Kase's bitter disappointment
Not at all who 'd hoped for
' as they flick to a point iust behind Kase's head
' as he realizes he's been had
He      -- --and sees that '
Too late-- he    -- and    '
(through clenched teeth) 'm afraid Connor couldn't be here
But don't worry, he's with us in spirit
Still gripping his sword two-fisted, Duncan seems to surge with newfound strength
He gave himself for this moment
And  shan't let him down
Duncan   from Kase and goes to work on him with a
: frightening, hallucinitory vision of a  -- one that  back and forth in the flux of swirling mist
As Duncan's blade  , Kase sees
With the very next , he sees Duncan again
Then Connor
Then Duncan
Connor
Duncan
Kase rubs his eyes with the back of his hand
Shakes it off
Can't be
Duncan buffets Kase backward with several dazzling combinations, then goes inside, tough and ugly
Kase seems suddenly overwhelmed, physically and mentally, as he's driven onto his back by sheer relentless overdrive
Duncan   for the killing blow, which Kase
He
And
Each time Kase barely escapes with his head intact
Duncan keeps up this relentless barrage, hacking down in every conceivable direction, looking for an opening, finding none
With each increasingly-leaden , Duncan is losing strength
and Kase is regaining his
Kase     , deftly siezes the advantage
(savage smile) This is not a game won on points, 'm afraid
He drives Duncan back with an answering exchange that leaves no doubt of his superior ability
In a single massive , Kase  Duncan's sword and sends him flying
Duncan lands on his back, weaponless
Kase steps up to the katana, scoops his toe under it and
Then waves him back to his feet
cat playing with his prey
Both combatants square off
and
That's the beauty of eternity
The fun never stops
He -- spiking Duncan clear through the shoulder
Duncan hangs up on the blade, unable to move
Grimaces in pain
Setting boot to chest, Kase  Duncan off his sword and sends him spiralling backward
Duncan reaches out to break his fall-- --but there's no ground beneath him
He   a
Bounces at fifty feet, then tumbles clear to the bottom
Kase steps up to the edge, scowls
- has been hewn from the hilltop by the massive sword of modern technology
several stories tall lines the inner basin
What have they done to my mountain
He gazes down at '  sprawled at the base of the cliff
Then starts down after him
-    - Duncan crawls over to his sword
as Kase picks his way down the steep incline
Duncan spikes his sword into the ground and uses it to climb upright
One look at his battered body and you know this fight is over
He just stands there, hunched over his sword, grimly waiting for Kase to reach him and deliver the killing blow
It doesn't take long
Kase stops, regards him with contempt
Don't make it easy
hate that
Youre breaking my heart
Pick up
Duncan shakes his blood-streaked head
It's always been too easy for you, Kase
No reason this time should be any different
He plucks his sword out of the ground
and
(cont'd) Take your best shot
He hobbles off, sword hanging limp at his side
Kase starts
Duncan ignores him, keeps walking
About now, we should have a pretty good idea what Duncan has in mind
But Kase doesn't have a clue
' : For a fleeting moment, Connor stands before Duncan, more mist than flesh
He opens his arms wide
' Remember weil, old friend
He   as Kase hoists sword over shoulder

Which is exactly what Duncan expected

This time, no force of man or nature can keep Duncan's sword from hitting home

: He stands there, head miraculously still intact, a look of bewildered relief
Duncan simply  his sword butt into Kase's face
The head comes easily away from the neck and falls
'  spins    through the air, bounces twice and comes to a rest
And that's how we first see his  , sprawled across the ground

And now he knows
This is the worst part of losing your head-- those last few seconds of cold lucidity

One inch at a time, he slowly rises to his feet
As we    up into a
: - Duncan stands over a freshly-dug grave
Onto the simple stone, he's chisled: And beneath it: Duncan's eyes glisten with an unspeakable loss
And a comfort in knowing that his friend has finally found the peace of eternity

Welcome home

-   - stands sentinel-like atop a bluff overlooking the Hudson River and the insignificant island of Manhattan beyond
Her trademark slashes of facepaint and hair dye have been shed like molted skin
What remains is a serene beauty that defies fashion or vanity
Her faraway eyes  with a sudden, frightening clarity
sets her reflexes snapping as she  -- --and  the , handle first
follows, strolling toward her with hands loose at his side
Faith runs her finger down the shimmering blade
(considers) So
what am  supposed to do next -- kiss you or take your head
Duncan steps up to her, smiling enigmatically
The choice is yours
