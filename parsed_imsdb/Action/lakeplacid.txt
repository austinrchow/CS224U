Kelley May 6, 1998 Full Pink Draft we  the distant but near melodic  of a
: - The loon continues its hypnotic call, as the steamy mist lifts off the dark water, which doesn't even ripple
The loon continues her nocturnal cry, as we savor the beauty of the lake, the elegance of the bird, and the haunting echo of her lonely call
until suddenly the bird is crisply pulled under, silenced forever
lone feather surfaces and floats as: Credits roll over the black lake to Richie Havens singing " " Then-- (
) And they pay you for this
To tag beaver
(
) Imagine
As we   a face    from underwater
It is the face of   (Maine Fish And Game) looking down from a boat
- Next to him is   , paunch, disposition of an untipped waiter
Ask me, what an animal does in the wild is his own business so long as he doesn't do it to man
think Mark Twain said that
(dry) think he didn't
But since you've said it,  guess we're covered
Keough holds a stare
Walt drops overboard
Keough pulls a Twinkie from his pocket
Begins to unwrap
- - , pretty, thirty, as  , forties, approaches
Kelly
(warmly) Kevin, hey
She beams affection, he exudes a little discomfort
Hi
Listen
Could  steal you a second
(great idea) Absolutely
'  - They enter   , he closes the door
had a great time last night
Again
Me too
Reading his look, she suddenly smells it
Her face drops
(') (deducing) That's not what you came to say
You work for me
'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"
She's a little crushed
was working for you when "us" started, what's-- know and  thought  could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix
Kevin, as long as we
(suddenly) What was that last part
(sheepish) The somebody else part
Yeah, that part
There's
somebody who's um
(feels terrible) Else
beat
(covering) Oh
Oh
That's okay
Well
This uh
this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know
mean, 'm
God, gotta be ten years younger and you, you
you're y'know
(reading her mind) jerk
(you have no idea) Oh
(then) No, no, 'm not angry 'm not, 'm just thrown, 'm
(checks her watch) actually have an early lunch, so
It's ten after nine
Yes, well
(smiling) famished
And she rushes out of the room
Kevin, we: : - Walt dives down, visibility is lousy
Whether it's algae or dense vegetation, the water is extremely murky
- Keough unwraps the second Twinkie
- Walt continues to swim
Not much to look at
Then suddenly
no, just a snapping turtle swimming away
Walt descends a little deeper
He loves it beneath the water, there's a tranquility he can find nowhere else
Next best thing to meditation
Suddenly, he stops kicking
black water snake, it must be almost three feet in length
Walt flippers himself closer, wants a closer look
The snake seems unimpressed
Then suddenly, the snake lunges at him, misses
Shit
Walt's look says "what the fuck
"   beat
Then the snake swims off
Walt relaxes
beat
But then
he looks around, uneasy
He gets this feeling he's not alone down there
Looks about, nothing but murky water
But he's not alone, we can feel he's not alone
He looks left, right
then
four snakes, swimming, hovering, looking back at him
What's with these snakes
Walt decides he'll go back to the boat
Then
Something hits him
and it's no snake
- Keough
Oblivious
Waiting
Suddenly-- Walt comes thrusting up with a scream
Sheriff
And Walt is promptly yanked back under
Hey
Upon which Walt surfaces
He swims frantically for a beat before he's suddenly yanked under again
Then he surfaces, thrashing as Keough speeds over with the boat
He takes hold of him and pulls him on board
Actually
what's left of him
There's nothing below the waist
Walt is just a bleeding torso, though still conscious
(') (going into shock) Jesus Christ
' clenching around Keough's arm
' He knows he's done
Keough's continued horror, we: : (-Rex) is angry and out for blood
- We're watching an old classic creature feature
Kelly alone, slowly eating popcorn, rapt, tense
watching the movie
As the suspense builds, her hand freezes halfway between the popcorn bag and her mouth
The monster pursues its human victim
fear on her face
The monster makes its final surge, capturing its prey
as she screams with fear and delight
Her scream is only partially muted by the shrieks of the other moviegoers
After a beat, she calms, daring to eat popcorn again
Wearing gullibility, vulnerability all over her face
Then from behind a hand appears, taps her shoulder, causing her to let loose with the most blood-curdling scream of all
All the moviegoers turn to
as will : Thirties, standing mortified; the woman who tapped her shoulder
: - Kelly and Okubo emerge from the movie theater
What do you expect, mugging me from behind
tapped you
Well you shouldn't have
How did you even know where  was
(sarcastic) Wild guess
don't like to be scared, Myra, have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me
Kevin told me you were upset
Really
never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else
(sheepish) Well
he didn't have to tell me that part
Kelly freezes
Stares at her
Then: You
It started before you, Kelly, never would've-- You
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and
You and Kevin
It wasn't suppose to happen, don't know what to say
beat
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words
Kelly-- 'm not upset, Myra, okay
just never thought of you as a y'know
Backstabber
(don't be silly) No
Liar
(c'mon) Myra
Shitbutt
really
should get back
And Kelly peels off to go on her way
Bumps into a Pedestrian
She then gives him an angry shove, under-- (') (to the pedestrian) Don't fuck with me
And off she goes
The Pedestrian and Okubo exchange a look
: - Coroner's ambulance
Walt's covered body is being loaded, as , Fish and Game, thirty, emerges from his truck
He approaches the body
Lifts up the sheet
Stares a beat in disbelief
Turns to Keough
What did this
Keough, we: : - Kelly's in her office, working at her desk
Kevin enters
Hey
Kevin
How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out
This is business
(then) There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake
Probably a bear, but
they found a tooth
tooth
tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear
They say it looks prehistoric
Like maybe a dinosaur
(without looking up) Oh, well then 'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else
want you to go there
Now she looks up
Sorry
'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, -- This is what we do
'd like you to check out this lake
See-- Are you on drugs
Kelly-- 'm not going to Maine,  won't even go west of Forty-third Street-- Part of our research-- 'm not even a field person
Well on this one 'd like you to be
Kelly stares back
The nickle drops
This was Myra's idea, wasn't it
Get me out of the office for a few days, until-- It has nothing to do with-- never do field work and even if did, Maine, to look at a tooth of a dinosaur who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something-- Kelly-- am not going to Maine
That's ridiculous
: - sea helicopter is sailing up against the blue sky, nothing but Evergreens and lakes below
- Kelly with the Pilot
She looks a little white
- Kelly is walking with Keough toward the morgue
He just came up screaming
Did he say anything
He just kinda gurgled
He was pretty much dead
And you didn't see anything
The lake was dead calm until up he came
The tooth is in there
(seeing) There
That's the morgue
Yes
Is the dead guy in there
That's where they keep them
(then) You want me to bring the tooth out here
Um
(bravado) No, no
Let's go
Reveal-- - The Medical Examiner,  , is there with Keough and kelly
Walt's torso is covered
Kelly is examining the tooth
need to get a microscopic look at it
Fine
(indicating) There you go
Maybe  should see
(the body) (reading her) wouldn't
'm fine, thank you
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms
Scott
Well
(admits) At wakes
This is a little different
can look at dead things
And Daniels is about to pull the sheet back-- (') Wait
She takes a breath
(') Okay
And Daniels peels back the sheet
Kelly strains to disguise her extreme horror
Finally-- (') (fighting off nausea) This
how long did this attack go on for
Seconds
Three, four
And this is how he came to the boat
Yes
Okay
(then) And is there a place nearby  could go to vomit
this, we: : - It's a small, almost tiny town; general store, post office, fire station
Kelly and Keough are in front of the general store loading supplies into a van, across the street in front of the Sheriff's Department
Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake
Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual
You talk to the married couple
Not yet
What kind of backup do we have
We
That strikes a nerve
(defensive) What
Sorry
'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here
You have a thing against museums
got nothing against-- Ever even been in one
He stares back
Then picks up a huge cannon-like gun
As he loads it-- What is that
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit
Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead
(incredulous) And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia
beat
You're sort of a rude person
It's just that-- Suddenly, like a shot, Kelly's arm jerks up as she jet sprays a white fog from a can of Yard Guard
Keough holds a look at her
(') Mosquitos
have a thing about mosquitos
Upon which a sport utility vehicle pulls up, it's marked "Maine Fish And Game"
Jack Wells emerges, Kelly's eyes scan him like radar
We set
Ready
(re Kelly; dry) museum in New York sent us some additional back up
Kelly shoots Keough a look
Then: Kelly Scott
Jack Wells
museum sent you
Are we all museum bigots in Maine
Jack holds a look, decides to let that pass
Did you make anything of the tooth
Yes, it did seem prehistoric but 'm sure he just carried the thing for luck
Not that it worked, obviously
It probably somehow got lodged into his body
Jack holds another look
(') Why are you staring at me
(to Keough) Do  have a smudge on my face, it would be so you not to have told me
Keough also lets that pass
(to Jack) 'm ready when you are
Let's go
As they start out, Kelly grabs Jack by the arm
Excuse me
One other thing, it's a small point, but
have a thing about being humored, and 'm feeling humored, more by him, but you seemed quick to join in
Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well
As  , sixteen, flirtatious little vixen, steps up
Excuse me
Is it true you're going to look for some kind of monster in Black Lake
We're just going to investigate an accident
There's no monster
We heard a man got bit in half
There was an accident, that's all
Nothing to worry about
And Janine goes into the store
The men just watch her go
Sixteen going on twenty, nubile
Kelly just looks at the men, gaping at the girl
Please
: - Keough, Jack, and Kelly are in a boat motoring towards a farmhouse
No other houses in sight
- Jack, Kelly and Keough are questioning  , mid- sixties, eccentric if not slightly daffy
She's brought out refreshments
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs
Bickerman
(with some attitude) Oh well, 'm sorry
didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead
(gently) What was the cause of your husband's death, Ma'am, do you know
Off Bickerman's silence-- (') We don't mean to invade your privacy but
was he ill, was he sick
Was he swallowed
(reprimanding) Sheriff
Mrs
Bickerman, the reason we're up here
a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake
Do you know how your husband died
(brightly) Oh yes
killed him
Keough clenches his eyes shut
The old woman's a loon
You killed him
(happily) Oh, yes
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am
(rattling it off quickly, simply) Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well
think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one coherent day, he asked me to end his suffering
wouldn't do it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that  finish him off
Finally  just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead
Jack, Keough, and Kelly just stare back at this crazy woman
Off their looks-- (') (to Keough) Dig him up if you don't believe me, Javert
: - Keough and Kelly are in the boat slowly traveling along the thickly wooded shoreline
Half mile up, there's a clearing
You gonna dig up that lady's husband
'll call the coroner
(looking around) What is with this lake
It looks black and
there are no waves or anything
They wanted to call it Lake Placid
But somebody said that name was taken
(to Jack) Gee
Jack smiles, gets her sarcasm
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up
(what
) We're staying in tents
told you
Two days, we'd have to camp
Yes, camp,  thought that meant Holiday Inn,  never heard "tents", will there be toilets
(seeing something) What the hell
Keough's attention has been otherwise arrested
He sees something in the water
What
(slowing the boat) thought  saw
It looks like a branch
He leans over to grab something floating in the water
Looks like a branch
He lifts it up, revealing it to be an antler
Connected to the severed head of a moose
Keough, seeing it as he lifts it, screams, throwing it
It hits Kelly and she screams, a blood-curdling scream, as the hits the floor of the boat with a
Kelly rears back, still screaming, and belts Keough in the shoulder
Hey
You threw it at me
(denying) just let go of it
You threw it at me
Alright
(to Jack) Did you see that
She belts him again
(') Stop hitting me
Ma'am
Don't throw heads at me, (to Jack) and stop calling me "Ma'am"
beat
This head looks ripped off the body
What is going on here
- small tent camp is being set up
People unpacking
Two Deputies,  and , present
Kelly is with Jack
How big do the bears get
Big but
a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in water
On land maybe
But
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow
Hank says he's sure
Kelly takes in the scenic surroundings
It really is beautiful, isn't it
Never been to Maine before
was told they discriminate against people with hygiene
(off Jack) never believed it
He measure her
Then-- Why are you here
Really
told you
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to-- How would you know, what-- And even if they did,  doubt he or she would have problems with tents
So  don't like tents, why-- You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods-- (') What's wrong with my       --as Emily Post, it doesn't fingernails these are      make sense-- perfectly good-- (') (overriding) They sent you out to examine a tooth, why are you out here on the on the lake
beat
Might as well tell
am a paleontologist
(throwing it out) also was dating my boss he turned out to be involved with a co-worker who was also my friend and for the sake of comfort, theirs,  was shipped off to Maine
(then) don't feel like going back yet
There
She said it
He stares back
(') 'm not making it up
Well
You don't have to stay out here, why don't-- 've come, 'm here, 'm staying
Unless there are ticks
We then  the
She looks up
Then: (') Oh my God
What
If this is who  think it is
(as it gets closer) It is
Who
Hector Cyr
He's a rich kook mythology professor
He's done some work with our museum
He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles
(arriving) With what
Crocodiles
He's an expert on them
And if he's here
then he must think that's what's in this lake
In Maine
There have been Northern sightings
But not this North
As  , this giant ball of life, deboards his chopper-- (spotting Kelly; disappointed) You beat me
Balls
(then) need some of you to help me unpack
(to Burke and Stevens) You and you
(to Keough) Not you
(to Kelly) Who do we have from Fish And Game
(to Kelly)                 Me
Who is this man
(rapid fire) could see the algae blooms just coming in, how long has this lake been stagnant
(extending his hand to Keough) Hi, Hector Cyr
The Earth is round and so should you be
(to Kelly) --Who is he
'll need any and all topographic studies
Wait just a second
You don't just fly in here and start barking orders
apologize,  just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout, (to Kelly) you've had work done
(flaring)             (frustrated) have not
Who is this man
Hector Cyr,  said it once, let me know when it sinks in, (to Kelly) have you seen it
(') No
Mister
(') It couldn't be a crocodile
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,-- (frustrated) Mr
Cyr
'mon, we're losing light, (to Kelly) why does the big one heckle me
Kelly yanks him aside
(sotto) Hector
The big one has no sense of humor
And since he's the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self
That hurt my feelings
And it did a little
Hector is a big Teddy Bear
(arriving) If we're gonna go we better go
: - Keough and Kelly are in one canoe, Hector and Jack are alongside in another
Hector is operating one of his sophisticated sonar devices
The calm
The still
The beauty
If he's here, 'll find him
(to Jack, re Kelly) Did she tell you we had sex together
never had sex with you
Even so, you're allowed to boast
You look thin by the way, 've mentally undressed you,  can see your ribcage
really don't mean to be discourteous
(patronizing) But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time
And what would he do come winter
They can survive winter
As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive, (to Kelly) am  foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name
(scolding)          Hey
Hector
(to Keough) Is this where it happened
Around here
Yeah
(knows his crocodiles) If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away
Crocs hang around the food source
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway
'Cept he wasn't before, was he
(then to Keough) You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger
You're fat
Hector
Suddenly there are ripples, fish breaking surface about thirty feet away
What's that
White perch
Are they feeding
Doesn't look like it
They look like they're jumping
They look scared
Upon which something grabs the front of Kelly's canoe and with one crisp yank, flips it over like a spoon on a dinner table, sending them all flying
In an instant, Keough and Kelly are swimming for their lives
Screaming/yelling, they scramble for the canoe, climb onto it's flipped-over back
Breathless, they all exchange confused looks
"What the hell happened"
(') My hair
: - Kelly, still in wet clothes, is talking on her portable phone
Keough is there as Hector approaches
Jack is approaching as well
Activity bustles in the b
g
(into her phone) None of us actually saw anything
(then) realize this Sir, but something flipped us over,  doubt very much it was a mink
What's going on
They don't believe her
(still into phone) Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker
(she clicks off) Such the flirt
Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation
Same thing from Fish And Game
Something's in that water
Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people
As    approaches-- (
) (calling) Sheriff
Keough looks over
(pointing to the ground) You might want to see this
They all walk over
There's hundreds, maybe a thousand worms squirming, surrounding
a human toe
(
) Oh God, worms
got a thing about worms
It's a human toe
Hector studies it, picks it up
Then-- Some decomposition, little acidic, it has been swallowed
(to Keough; holding the toe) Is this the man who was killed
Keough deadpans back
Then-- We'd only just met
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species
Keystone what
Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water
You've got a crocodile
(proffering the toe) Bury your friend
Hector gives the toe to Keough, then heads off
Keough stands there, holding the tow, as we: : - Kelly is testing a  that sends out little  , as Jack approaches
He stops
Takes a second to
well, admire her
She's an attractive woman
He then approaches
Baby crocs
Adult males will charge hatchlings
If there's one out there
If one could be out there
why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts
beat, as she tends to her work
Listen
if you really do know crocs, you should know how stealth like they are
wouldn't be standing a foot from the water
She looks
(') He could be right there and you wouldn't see him
(still looking at the water) 'd be able to see something
Upon which, Jack tosses a rock over her shoulder
As it makes a splash, she screams and practically jumps into his arms
Then: (') (realizing) Oh that's funny
That was real funny
And she heads off
Jack, we: : '  - Two deputies are digging deep pits about thirty feet in front of his tent
From within we  , the  of a
Keough approaches
looks at Deputy Burke, who's digging
(shrugs) He paid us
Five hundred
Keough continues on toward the tent
'  - His tent is on the palatial side
Stereo, generator, he's got a margarita bar going
There's a party
Hector's dancing with Deputy Gare, others are enjoying the drinks and
You're a beautiful woman
Thank you
And law enforcement, such dangerous work
The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity
Upon which, Keough enters, doesn't like what he sees
Hey
He goes, turns  the
We are here on official business
Cocktail
No
(then) What's with digging the holes
They come on land and they're brazen
They're also attracted to noise, you can see  make a lot of it
Everybody out, back to your tents, now
They start to leave
(re Gare) Could she stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse
No
Out
And they all go, including Gare, who shrugs to Keough "he's kind of funny"
(') (to Hector) You listen to me
The only reason 'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar-- And you like me
do not like you
Deep down, gut check
'm growing fond of you and it's liberating to say so
Keough stares back
You're a whacko
And Keough leaves, to: - As Keough heads off-- (
) That hurt my feelings
: -- - Kelly stands, alone, skipping stones
After a beat, Jack approaches
What are you doing
Skipping stones
Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one
beat
Listen, uh
Hank and  think it best if you stay on shore
beg your pardon
Whatever's out there did flip over a canoe-- am not staying on shore
It's too dangerous for-- didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows-- You flew up here because your boss-- am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of-- (') hazing, new fingernails    'm not picking-- in the woods
(') (overriding) 'm beginning to see why you were shipped off
And her face falls
(wounded; quietly) That was an awful thing to say to me
(feels bad now) 'm sorry but you're
beat
He doesn't finish the sentence
(genuine) do know crocodiles and  won't get in your way
(then) really do want to be a part of this
Jack reads her, he can see that she does
Okay
(then) We're up at six
Good
(a beat) 'Night
There's a little chemistry here, though both would probably deny it
He heads off toward his tent, she sits with her book
She gives one last look, watches him go
Then she goes back to her book
: - The lake is still, the campfire is out, the tents are quiet
The quiet  of
An courageous raccoon looks about, seeing what he can rummage
By the water
a black bear takes a drink
' He emerges, compelled by a full bladder, wearing only his trousers, carrying a revolver
He walks into the nearby woods
He removes from his shorts his bladder's connection to the outside world
Proceeds to
Then
he hears something
The  of
He  , we  a   of
Then quiet
Must be his imagination
He  his business
More , it's not just the sound of dense urine against leaves, he stops
something's out there in the darkness
Quiet
He starts up for a second,  , and we  it for sure
Something's   him
With his free hand, Keough pulls out his revolver
More
Keough points the gun
Something on the ground is coming toward him
He moves slowly, gun drawn, into the darkness
The  is getting
It's almost upon him
beat
Then Keough peels away a bush revealing: Looking into a gun barrel
He screams
Keough screams
Then-- Jesus Christ
What the hell are you doing
What are you doing
You're crawling around like a-- 'm laying a spring trap
spring trap
keep telling you, they can come on land,  don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night-- coulda shot you, you-- This could end up saving your life,-- (') You'll be glad you didn't    Hey look, 'm sure you shoot me then, you'll be     finished first in your tongue massaging my          class but  think you need hemorrhoids, just before     to be retired to the big rubber running off to get your      room, where you can play with sister pregnant, who you     soft stuffed reptiles
probably already call mom
And now all the others, awakened, are charging
(arriving) Hey
What is going on
This man takes a pistol     He's crawling around-- to pee
(') (escalating) This is an official investigation, and this cuckoo bird is a civilian
don't care how much money he's got, he's a total mental
And Hector storms off
beat
You hurt his feelings
think you should go apologize
Apologize
(') We're a team here
It     He's a fruitcake
won't kill you to get along
(') Look
The thing about Hector
he takes this crocodile business very
(how to say it) he thinks they're Godly
beat
He thinks they're what
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them
He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits
Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious
It's to make you understand him, with understanding comes tolerance
Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter
(befuddled) Why does everybody insult my intelligence,  have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies
'm sorry
Keough shoots a look to Jack
Let's just all get some sleep
And Keough heads off, under-- 'm an intelligent person
Upon which, he disappears from Earth
He's stepped into one of Hector's pit traps
beat
(
) (calmly) shall kill him
: - The steam is lifting off the lake
- Keough, Kelly, Hector, and Deputy Burke are cruising in the whaler
Hector and Jack are both in full diving gear
Jack also has a stick gun for protection
Hector does not
Again,  don't mean to be annoying with my questions
But if it is a crocodile which  don't think it is
And if they do charge these baby hatchling sounds
(to Jack) why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time
(to Hector) With you it makes sense
They don't really attack underwater and-- That "Walt" guy got hit underwater-- No crocodile has ever-- (to Hector) You should take a flax pole
And what if  tranq him Kelly
He drowns
You think about that
'm just saying last resort
Again
Not to be disruptive
Do we have a problem with it dying
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt
As if that's suppose to clear it up
Keough stares back blankly
Then: Is this a trick
What 'm saying is if it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him
(to Burke) Alright, let's just drop here
Burke lowers the anchor, as Keough just continues to stare at Hector
Kelly readies the hatchling recorder
She lowers it into the water
They respond pretty quick
'll wait till you get down before turn it on
Good
(climbing over) See ya soon
Good luck
There was a twinge of real concern in her voice
He makes eye contact with her
Then drops over
Goes under
(to Kelly) Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, 'm still waiting on his sperm count
What
(off Hector's look) Oh as if 'm interested
As if
(as he's about to go overboard; to Keough) Will you miss me
(to Hector) brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log
And Hector drops overboard
(to Kelly) Was that like a homo-sexual remark
(strict) asked you to be nice to him
Keough rolls his eyes
: -    - Jack, diving
We  the   of
Visibility is again pretty limited
-    -  - Hector dives through the dark black water
Visibility is lousy
- Jack dives, searched
Looks ahead, sees something
He moves closer
it's the carcass of the moose, no head
- Kelly and Keough onboard
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them
He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped
And that's why he thinks they're Godly
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes
(simple) You like Jack
(thrown) What
don't even know the guy
Hector thinks you like him
Well Hector's a giant cracker
You think Jack's handsome
What is this
'm just curious
can never tell what women think is handsome
Is he handsome
Well
He's probably rugged handsome  guess
Yeah
beat
Am
- Jack and Hector, diving together
: - The boats sit still on the dead calm water
Kelly works the , Keough covertly eats a Twinkie
It shouldn't be taking so long
They both scan the surface
Dead calm
- Hector moves about
We can hear the  , but he's not seeing anything
- ( ) - Jack looks about
He looks up
Doesn't see much but he gets an eerie feeling
Something's out there
- Keough, Kelly, and Burke, standing idly, scanning the calm surface
(into headset) Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank
Time to go home
That was a bust
beat
Another beat
Then
something jerks the boat a little
(') What was that
don't know
It was like a tug
Something tugged us
Upon which something really yanks the boat
So hard
Kelly flips over the back, into the water
(') Hey
The boat is moving, being dragged quickly
Something's got the anchor line
Kelly
But Kelly's alone in the water, the boat being pulled away
(into headset) Jack
Hector
We're being dragged
(as he starts the motor; to Burke) Cut the line
Cut the fucking line
Burke goes to work on the anchor line as we  Kelly, treading water, in the middle of nowhere
She's completely vulnerable
- Hector, swimming for the surface
- Kelly, treading water
Keough on the boat, he now has the engine running, fighting against the drag but whatever has that boat has a fucking strong hold
Cut the Goddamn rope
(working away) 'm trying
And finally, as he severs the rope the boat almost goes airborne with a jump, Burke nearly sails out
Keough's boat then races to Kelly
Hurry up
Suddenly about thirty feet away
we  fish breaking water
(') Shit
Hank
The boat is zooming toward her
It arrives
As Keough and Burke go to pull her aboard, we see a dark shadow rising
(screaming) Look out
And Jack explodes out of the water, it was his shadow
Keough and Burke pull them both aboard
(back to Kelly) Are you alright
think
My hair
(then) Where's Hector
(to Jack) Where is he
We went in different directions
That water is thick, you can't see through it
- Hector is swimming toward the surface
Suddenly
a shadow looms over him
He looks up
There is no boat
We can't see it, just a big shadowy mass
He's scared
: - (into headset) Hector
Hector, we got dragged off position, when you surface, you gotta yell
- Hector is still charging toward the surface
The lack of visibility is frightening, something could be six feet away and he wouldn't know it
- (pointing) There's bubbles over there
Look
Keough quickly maneuvers the boat to where Kelly indicated, under-- (') There he is
Here he comes
And Keough has the boat to him as Hector breaks surface
And they quickly pull Hector on board, all attention is on Hector as they lean over to rescue him
On the far right
two eyes
moving closer to the oblivious rescuers
Slowly moving in, everybody is so preoccupied with Hector, Deputy Burke, at the end of the boat, is leaning way over to see Hector
If only he knew what he's not seeing
The eyes come closer
They're now in the water right below Burke's head
How can he not see it
beat
Another beat
Then
suddenly, a mouth, a dragon, teeth, something, flashes from the water-- snap
And Deputy Burke's head is simply gone as his limp body hangs over the boat
Kelly screams in horror
In a microsecond, Burke's head and life are both gone their stunned faces, as Kelly continues to scream we: : - Burke's body is being loaded into an ambulance
People move in silence, the wake of tragedy
few State Troopers are on the scene
(giving a statement) Nobody actually saw it
It happened sudden
Kelly, staring almost blankly, as Jack, finishing a phone call, approaches
He measures her expression, she's still in shock
You okay
(nothing) Kelly
Yeah
(then) Nobody saw anything
No
(then) Wildlife is on their way
That's probably good
Police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word
lake monster
They just want us to sit tight
She is visibly undone, she appears almost to be fighting off shock
Jack puts his hands on her shoulder to steady her
Are you okay
Um
y'know
(swallows) Yeah
Jack can see she's willing herself to be stoic
man died
You don't have to be so tough
She nods, appreciatively
Part of her would love to collapse into him but a bigger part demands that she remain stoic
'm fine
uh
'm fine
Keough, walking
Still visibly shaken
He unwittingly approaches Hector
They hold a look
(genuine) 'm sorry
beat
(') Was he a good man
Yup
Whenever somebody dies  consider it such a waste that  didn't know him better
beat
Then-- (fighting off disbelief; shock maybe) His head was just
bitten off
(sadly) used to have this recurring nightmare that  was headless
Keough turns to stare at him with incredulity
(') (quietly rattling it off) 'd be on the ground looking up at my body, no head, walking around bumping into everything
And my parents wouldn't let me in the house 'cause they'd just bought all these new antique lamps and they were afraid 'd knock them over, made sense, and meanwhile, the neighborhood bullies would see my round little head on the ground looking like a ball, and they'd come rushing over to start up a game of soccer
'd actually feel grateful just for being allowed into the contest, that's esteem for you, what are your thoughts
Keough has had enough of this guy
(a powder keg) You know, Hector, 'm sure you're a fine person in your own mental way
But  think it would be best if you and  didn't speak
And Keough heads off
He takes about four steps
then
Up goes his upside-down body like a rocket
He's stepped in Hector's spring-bow trap
beat
He swings upside-down like a pendulum
Another beat
This is a setback
You don't want to cut me down
'Cause 'll kill you
: - Kelly and Jack
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness
thought  might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints
She just stares out as if she didn't hear
And he fixes his own stare on her
Feeling it, she turns, catches him looking at her, he diverts the stare
She feigns a non-reaction
beat
(') You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion
Excuse me
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's
(a beat) in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie
What are you talking about
'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake and a monster that bites heads off
you look good
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack
'm all moist
Forgive me for trying to be nice
Nice
Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good
didn't say it like that
You did, you-- was trying to pay you a compliment,  was guising it as science 'cause  know you're comfortable in that arena
Science
man just died, you're hitting on me with science
Just forget it
(arriving) Beg pardon
Sorry to intrude but Hank seems to have gotten himself stuck in a tree
- Hank hangs still, upside down, from the tree, as Hector, Kelly, and Jack approach
probably could've accomplished freeing him myself but he had a look of mayhem on his upside down face
They arrive
Hank says nothing, he hangs there perfectly still
Hank
(calmly) Yes
The three exchange looks
Are you okay
(calmly; almost sweet) Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, 'm perfectly fine
(then) Could you cut me down
Promise you won't kill me, first
(calmly) have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector
(again) Could you please cut me down
Jack gives Kelly a knife
You cut, we'll hold him
Hector and Jack grab hold, Kelly cuts, they lower him to the ground
He rises
(calm) Thank you
(then) lied
And he charges after Hector, who runs toward the beach
Keough chases, Jack and Kelly pursue, trying to stop him
And suddenly, exploding out of the woods, a ferocious charging An attack
Screams all over, a half-second of confusion before we  it's a large   jumping out of the darkness, right at Hector
Hector dives out of its path
Screams, panic, shouting, as the bear rears up on his hind legs
Seemingly about to lunge when
exploding out of the water the giant jaws of a crocodile
In a flash instant, the beast engulfs the bear, twisting it, slamming it on the ground and then pulling it into the water
The bear fights back ferociously for a second but there can only be one outcome here
In a matter of seconds, both bear and crocodile have vanished
And the water is calm again
Utter catatonia
Shock
Whatever they expected to find in this expedition, they weren't remote prepared for that
There are no words here
Shock is pre-empting every other human sensory
What they just saw
a crocodile head measuring five feet rise up out of the water and gobbled a fucking bear
beat
Then-- (admitting) Okay
It's a crocodile
'll admit it
beat as they gulp air
(to Jack) You're cut
There is a little blood over Jack's right eye
He dabs it
(') (to Hector) He was an Indo-pacific
(daunted) Are you sure
Scales were oval
It was an Asian crocodile
Asia
How
how could he get here
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet
He had to be thirty feet long
Another beat
(charged) Hank
The little cannon you brought, get it
Guard the shoreline
Otherwise, we're done
We made the
, our job is finished
Alright, Ms
Paleontologist wanna know why that monster is here
You got a theory
Why he's that big,  don't know
Why he's here
the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving
Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans
But why Maine and why alone
Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself
Maybe he doesn't play well with others
Is everything a big fucking joke to you
(re his groin) Bite my bishop
And Keough starts for him, but Jack intercedes
'm sick of him
(interceding)        Let him go
'm sick of you 'mon
too, let him go
(then) Thing about being rich, Sheriff, my parents had the added luxury of being able to ditch me off at Karate school, 'm a brown belt
So go ahead
Take your best shot
Keough throws a haymaker, decking Hector
Lays him out
Hank
(who knew
) He said he knew Karate
(shaken) At school they'd always say "go" first
(to Keough) Get your big gun and guard the shore
Hector
Go to your tent
(muttering as he goes) He never said "go"
(to Keough) Get the gun
(muttering as he goes) If  fall into a hole or get hoisted into a tree
And he's gone
(re Keough and Hector) Like little children
(then) You okay
Yeah
got some stuff for your cut
couldn't believe
did you see the size of that thing's mouth
wonder if he's some kind of mutant
(then) That bear had to be surprised
(taking her arm; ushering) Let's get away from the shore
She looks at his hand on her arm, which suddenly makes him self- consious
(') Sorry
It's okay
They hold a look
() - We are at a small clearing on the other side of the lake four-wheel-drive of some sort is bumping down a fairly unpassable dirt road into the clearing
(
) Told you  could make it
As the jeep comes more  , we  its occupants to be six teenagers, including Janine, and , , , , They've been drinking but they're not sloppy drunk
As they climb out, Tom points to a swing rope which extends from the branch of a tree that overhangs the water
There it is
(stripping) Last one in's a dead man
Could be more like first one in
The teenagers begin to strip off their clothes
As they giggle and laugh we: : '  - Kelly is butterflying Jack's wound, necessarily working very close to him
Ow
Shit
Just gotta pull it a little tighter
Who taught you be be a nurse
Father's a surgeon
can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here
No thanks
Keep it dry
No swimming
(dry) Thank you
They hold a look
Then -- (') You're having the best time of your life, aren't you
(caught) What
Why
people have been killed,  hardly think 'm having a good time, why would
(off his look; copping) Does it show
Jack nods slightly
(') This is the first time 've actually
y'know been in the middle of anything
've never really even gotten dirty before, with me showers have always been preventative
Their eyes are locked now, making her self-conscious and nervous
That's why you're here
To get in the middle of something
Maybe
've always read about what's happened
've never know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace while something is actually
y'know
happening
Something is happening right now
beat
(') We should probably go to bed
(quickly) Get rest, get some rest
Go to our separate beds, get some rest
The Freudian slip of her life
They hold another look
Then he starts to exit
He stops at the door, turns back
Thanks for the
bandaid
(please don't go) Night
He holds another look, then leaves
her punishing herself for both the slip of the tongue and for cutting the moment short
: () - The teenagers are now skinny-dipping, having a grand ol' flirtatious time
As they splash and frolic and cop their feels, we
about fifty yards away
Two eyes pop above the surface
followed by the snout
: '
Six fresh delicious teenagers
Midnight buffet
the croc as he slowly starts to move
The teenagers start to take turns, swinging on a rope from a branch which overhangs the shoreline
As they laugh and yell, Danny swings on a long rope
landing with a splash
About ten feet from the croc, waiting stealth-like, his eyes barely above surface
He could easily go for Danny
but he somehow knows the service will get better
As Danny swims back to shore, Janine takes hold of the rope
Here  come
Ready or not
And she swings away
a better swing than Danny's
and she splashes down about five feet from the eyes
Again, the eyes don't move
The teenagers cheer Janine's record-setting swing as Tom takes hold of the rope
All or nothing, Tom
From the jaws of defeat
And he flies away
It's a leap to die for
As he splashes down
gulp
Like a seal grabbing a fish
and Tommy has vanished
The kids, cheering at the leap, stop cheering when Tommy fails to resurface
beat
They first think he's playing a joke
Ha ha
Another beat
Still no sign of Tommy
(still in the water) Tommy
(then) This isn't funny, Tommy
And now they're concerned
They all move down toward the shore
Tommy
'mon,  Tommy
And now they're starting to panic
Where is he
(yelling) This isn't funny
Suddenly-- thrusting up out of the water
The crocodile, Tommy in its jaws
Bloodcurdling screams from all as we: : - Hector and Keough both hear the screams of the teenagers
What's that
It came from across the lake
- Keough, Jack, and Deputy Stevens are in the boat, zooming towards the teenagers
(to Keough) You said nobody came in here
Obviously  was wrong
: - Hector and Kelly are flying toward the area, the search beams are on
: He just took him in his jaws
() - The teenagers have some or most of their clothes back on
Hector's chopper is hovering over the area, its beams lighting the water
Lying on the beach, covered
is Tommy
Alive
And basically unhurt
He was in his mouth
Yes
(stunned; to Tommy) You're okay
(in shock) think; just cuts
The thing just came up out of the water and kind of spit him at us
You should have signs posted, for God's sake
(examining him) You're really okay
Tommy nods
Then-- might need a Tetanus
Keough and Jack exchange a look of disbelief
- Hector, Keough, Jack, and Kelly, looking tired, trek toward their tents
Just spit him back out
Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know
(dismissive) He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear
Sobek
Half man, half croc, oldest God-- 'm tired, Hector
know this because you're beginning to not bug me
That sounds good but underneath it's hurtful
(then) Nightcap
Raincheck
They're growing on each other
Jack and Kelly exchange a smile
Hector and Keough are developing an odd kinship almost
They continue on as Jack and Kelly stop at her tent
Well
Goodnight
We seem to say goodnight a lot
We could not say it and
(suddenly a coward) Well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to
She smiles
Then: Night
He holds another look
She goes into her tent
He stands there
beat
Waits to see if she calls him back
She doesn't
He then heads off
Her head pops out
Watches him go
Almost calls after him
Doesn't
- We see the campsite, looking at it from the water
All is still
After a beat
An eye blink
We are not looking at the campsite
We are   an ,  the campsite
Another blink
Still another
We  a slight
Then: : - Hector and Deputy Gare, inside the chopper, lifting of, to begin an early morning search
: - (    ) - Kelly, Jack, Keough, and Stevens searching for tracks along the wooded shoreline, staying a good six feet from the actual shore
Their senses are very heightened
Keough has his cannon gun
Get back from the shore
We know how fast he can leap out
We shouldn't even really be doing this
They won't be here till at least noon
We got a few hours to kill
So does he
(obsessing) 'm gonna get ticks
know it
They're drawn to me
got a thing about ticks
(quickly) Ssssh
What
heard something
He's staring at a brush thicket
After a beat, we  a slight The guns go up quickly
beat
Nothing
Jack bends down, picks up a stone
Tosses it into the thicket
And out it charges
Kelly screams, they're all about to fire before they realize it's only a beaver
It scurries into the water
(trying to gather herself) Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit
(suddenly) Look
embedded in the mud
It must be two feet in diameter
(to Keough) Guard the water
Kelly and Jack go quickly to examine the print
(') That's pretty big
- The chopper is descending
Hector and Gare are inside
It seems like we're getting lower
It happens when  land
Why are we landing
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in
(alarmed) So why are we landing
(then) Hector
- Kelly and Jack are still working on the footprint
Physical proximity, which they're both a little distracted by
Thing we can lift it
Maybe
Don't mush it
(annoyed) 'm not mushing it
You're mushing it a little around the-- 'm not mushing it
Suddenly another beaver scurries out from underfoot, scaring all of them, but particularly Kelly who jumps
Her foot lands on a long extended branch, and even more suddenly Burke's severed head seesaws out of the shallow water, hitting her in the shin
She screams as they all jump back
They just stare, as Kelly continues to scream
(holding her) Okay
Okay
Okay
That is it
Really-- No
keep getting hit with heads
(holding her shoulders) Calm down
You calm down
Calm down
She takes a couple of calming breaths
'm being very calm
'm composed
This is the second time 've been hit with a severed head, 'm entitled to complain
(re the head) Is that uh
can't recognize him from the back
It looks like him
Keough takes a stick
Squeamish, he tentatively pokes the head, trying to turn it over
It is Burke
Keough leans in for a closer look
That's him
(re something) What the
Something appears to be in his mouth
Keough takes a small twig, pries back a cheek
the mouth is full of worms
(') Now 'm gonna puke
(seeing something) You gotta be kidding
What
(pointing) Look
About a hundred yards north, Mrs
Bickerman is leading a blindfolded cow to the water
Kelly raises her binoculars
So does Jack
What is she doing now
(then) Mother of God
What
Look ten feet into the water
There waiting
mouth fully open
is the fucking crocodile
Kelly, Jack, and Keough, as they lower their scopes
They look at each other, then back at the foregoing
- Mrs
Bickerman, singing "Itsy Bitsy Spider" is happily leading the blinded cow to the shore
The cow, tentative, just allows itself to be led, not knowing what the plan is
As Mrs
Bickerman gets to the water, she looks out to the croc
Come and get it
And with that, she whips the hind of the cow causing it to jump forward
Almost simultaneously, the croc makes its charge and the cow is dead before it has a clue
: , , utterly agape
After a long beat: : - Keough, Kelly, and Jack are questioning a slightly hostile Mrs
Bickerman
(indignant) haven't broken any laws
(bordering on condescension) Oh, but you have, Ma'am
You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice
man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and 'm sure would be annoyed at how you treat your cows
The reason  lied is if 'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing
How long have you been feeding this thing
About six years
He first appeared in May of nineteen-ninety-one
Bernie was out fishing and it followed him home
So we threw him some scraps and well
he didn't seem to bother anybody
He became kind of like a pet who lived in the wild
He just appeared
You have no idea how he arrived in this lake
No
Do you
Ma'am
Your husband, Bernie
You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded
(offended) No,  did not
(then) The crocodile did kill him, though
But it was all
it was a mistake
mistake
One of our horses got loose two years ago, went to the lake to drink and
well the crocodile started coming in, Bernie went to intercede and
it was all a terrible misunderstanding
(then) If  reported it, they would've sent people to kill it
Keough, Kelly and Jack can't quite believe what they're hearing
Then-- Ma'am, how could you not report this
He puts human life at risk and-- Nobody lives on this lake
it's really his lake now
- The chopper, free-floating, is drifting near a small cove
Hector, in diving gear, is about to go into the water, as Gare tries to dissuade
(getting panicked) 'mon Hector
know you're crazy but you can't-- need to see his habitat
As he drops in
Please
'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water
He's not gonna hurt me
: - Kelly, Jack and Keough with Bickerman
Murders and rapes in the cities
People bomb planes
can the police stop them
No
But feed one little cow to a crocodile
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest
Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat
(
) (through walkie-talkie) Hank
We got a problem with Hector
(into walkie-talkie) What problem
(
) (through walkie-talkie) He went swimming
: -  - Hector is underwater, exploring
Her radar is up, she heard something
But she doesn't see anything
She scans the surface closely
-  - The water is slightly more visible as Hector swims
Other than the odd school of fish, an otter, a snapping turtle
nothing extraordinary
Then, a flash shadow looms over him
He looks up, but sees nothing
Probably just the sun ducking under a cloud
It does make him sufficiently nervous, however, to head for the surface
He swims upward
() - Hector breaks the top
Lifts his mask, looks toward the chopper, which he sees about forty yards out
He continues to breaststroke on the surface
Suddenly
the croc's head rises up right behind Hector, who's oblivious
He continues to swim
The croc follows
Then
maybe divine intuition
Hector gets a feeling he's being followed
He then turns to look the other way, upon which his face goes rigid
About three feet from his nose
are two giant eyes staring at him
ashen
(weakly) Oh
my
The croc doesn't move
It just stares at him
Then end of his snout is almost touching Hector
Hector himself doesn't dare move, for fear of spooking the croc into action
We get the idea that looking into the eyes of this crocodile is not filling any spiritual voids
beat
(') suddenly feel a bit foolish
(then) You're different from the others
The croc raises his head now to reveal the snout
And his deadly smile
Hector just tries to tread water with as little motion as possible
He deathly fears a quick movement will cause his life to be over
Perhaps this is what he came for
To be judged by this symbol of mythology
He backswims ever so slightly
The croc pursues just as slowly, their eyes are locked
He could snap off Hector's head in an instant
(') (terrified; trying to convince himself) Holy spirit of Sobek
Holy ghost
(swallows) Holy shit
: - Gare still scans the water's surface, looking for any sign of Hector
And her face freezes
Oh yes, there's the sign
Hector continues to backswim slowly to the plane and the croc slowly follows
Hector
We can hear the quaking fear in Hector's voice
As he continues to slowly backswim
(to Gare; forced calm) Just turn the ignition, it's fuel injected
Gare turns the ignition, the   and
Come on
She turns it again and the
The crocodile is still right with him as they inch closer and closer toward the chopper
know under the circumstances, biting off my head might seem viable
It would cheapen you
But nothing's funny about this to Hector now
What he's staring into is death
His own
Gare raises her rifle
might get a shot
(fear in his voice) No
If you don't kill him instantly, 'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry
And even if you were on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide
(re the croc) Jesus
(to Hector) About twelve more yards
Keep coming just like that
craning to see how far away he is and as soon as he breaks eye contact with the , it
Hector quickly locks eyes with him again
(weakly) Oh my God
By now Hector is almost to the chopper, the croc is right there too
Hector's right hand then goes slowly for his belt though it's impossible to discern why
The crocodile seems poised to finish him
There's a slight
And then suddenly, a small underwater , followed by an out of the water
it's an inflatable life vest and as it pop tarts out of the water, the croc lunges for it
As the croc goes for the vest, Hector makes his dash for the chopper
In almost an instant, he's climbing on board as the croc pulls the vest into darkness underwater
Hector's up on the chopper's ski
Move over
The crocodile's head comes thrusting up, its massive jaws snapping shut, missing Hector by an inch, maybe two
Hector dives into the chopper, screaming
Go
She  the
The croc comes up again, chomping down on one of the landing skis
Both Gare and Hector scream as the whole helicopter is jerked mightily
(') (screaming) Go
'm trying
The croc releases and the chopper rights itself and begins to thrust off, when the croc surfaces again, mouth open
Gare her
It might as well shoot 's
The croc is undaunted but he does miss the ski and by now the chopper is up and running, finally safely out of the reptile's reach
: - Jack is nearly manhandling Hector, pulling him by the elbow towards his tent
Kelly and Keough are there too
(livid) This time, 'm gonna kick your ass
Bastard bit my chopper
Hey
Jack simply grabs his arm and squeezes a pressure point
Hector yelps in pain
(') You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide
Alright, Jack
No
(back to Hector) You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and-- (flaring) Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe-- 'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid-- Jack
'm a civilian
You don't have any authority-- can arrest you
Then do it
You probably do want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker
So profound and fat
Hector, feelings hurt, stomps off again
Kelly looks at Jack
Then Kelly follows Hector
'  - Hector enters, sits
beat
Kelly enters, goes to sit next to him
(softly) Did you want to be killed by it
You think 'm that nuts
(softly) Hector
(then) What you just did
there was at least some sort of a death wish going on
Nothing's real
Excuse me
Nothing's real
(escalating) 'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and-- He's sounding erratic
(') With crocodiles
everything's even
'm no psychiatrist
But  would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than-- (pained) 'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, sit here broken, a hollow sack-- Oh, bullshit
And Hector drops the act
Didn't even sound good
No
(worth a try) Eh
Fuck it
Can  tell them you won't go back in the water
Yes
You may
But maybe don't know
He has trouble saying it
What
Could we have intercourse
She just whacks him
Then exits
Hector, "worth a shot", we: : - Jack and Keough are there to meet Kelly
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game
They should be here by four
Okay
We might as well pack
Good idea
(
) They'll kill him
They turn to see, Hector is standing there
They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans
Tranq him in water, he drowns
They could try to tranq him on land
(knowing) They won't
He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down
Gee, that would really disappoint me
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he is a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine
This is a grand beast
grand dragon
An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive
Well, you can try talking them into that, if-- have enough flaxedil with me to put him out
And  think  know a way to-- Forget it
Look
know 'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it
They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong
the odds are he will be destroyed,-- (') Which is exactly          Please, Hank, let me finish what
'm having a sane moment, this is a window
(') If he were neutralized when they got here
they might consider saving him
And how would we neutralize him
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs
No way
Jack
We've all seen it
He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant
Hector's impassioned here, he's not fooling around
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to-- We both know what they'll do
Silence
Admission by silence
Then-- Even if we could tranq him-- how would we get him on land
Other than to eat us
He follows anything that moves
You guys can be in the trucks with tranq guns
If he charges, drive off, plus Hank you've got your hand- held cannon
We could do this with no safety risk
If it works, we save a beast that should be saved
beat
They are sympathetic to the idea
And again
How would you get him on land
That's actually the easy part
: '  - We  the
(to Keough) 'll sue you
Go ahead
And up goes Hector's chopper
And
connected to a long cable
a cow
An airborne cow, dangling from the chopper
(to Jack) You can't take a cow by eminent domain
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am
You're all fuckers
Vicious little fuckers
Jack turns to Kelly
Are we crazy
Well
We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter
She shrugs
Let's get back to camp
: - Hector pilots
Not much drag
As long as  can keep him from swinging, we're okay
- Hector's chopper is flying the befuddled animal toward the cove
Keough, Kelly, and Jack on the water cruising back to camp
Keough has his gun
- Two pickup trucks have been backed in for a shooting vantage
Kelly, Jack, Keough
Riflemen are ready with tranq guns
(into headset) Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim
(
) (through headset) Right
The more he thrashes, the better
(
) (through headset) You ready on shore
We're ready
The chopper lowers the cow
He starts to kick his legs in anticipation
(
) (through headset) If he tires, lift him out
And the cow goes into the water
He swims frantically a few meters
The chopper lifts him out briefly
It can't work
He has been going after everything
It could work
(then) But this is not a happy cow
He looks like a giant tea bag
: - The cow has been dipped more times than a stale donut now and he just hangs there like pasta
Jack, Keough, and Kelly are poised with tranq guns on the beach
(looking through binoculars) He doesn't seem to be swimming
Is he swimming
(looking through binoculars) He's floating
Take it home
(into headset) Hector
(
) Hold on
- got something on the screen
(
) You do
There's a mass
moving toward the cow
He's coming
- (into walkie-talkie; now adrenalized) Where
Where
(
) (through walkie talkie) Thirty meters or so
Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie
Can you confirm visually or just radar
(
) (through walkie talkie) Radar, he's underwater
But he's definitely coming
Okay
Lead him in
(to the others; barking) Okay, everybody up on the trucks
We aim for the stomach or side
there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide
Everybody up on the trucks
They move into position
'  - (charged) On our way
There, he's surfacing, there's the snout
You little sucker
- Sure enough
that giant snout breaks the surface
Ever so calmly
it moves toward the cow
- (into walkie-talkie) If he gets close, you go up, Hector, don't you endanger that cow
She's worried about the cow now
(
) (through walkie-talkie) He's following
Here we come
Depicting the same
- (to Hector) Nice and slow
(to the others) Let's get ready
Hector's chopper, cow dangling, is slowly approaching the shore
Behind it
the snout and eyes of a giant croc
Back on the shore, Keough's men ready themselves for action
Tranq guns
rifles
the team is mobilized
We  a   from the
He's mooing
You wouldn't
They're coming right in
Such a simple idea and it's working
What does that tell you
That it's about to go wrong
(into walkie talkie) Almost here, Hector
Don't forget to lift up the cow
(
) (sarcastic, through walkie talkie) Thank you, Jack
(to the team) You shoot on my order
If he charges, 'll be yelling "go" which means drivers take off
And drive fast, they can move on land
(to Keough) You set
Don't worry about me
Incredibly
the plan is working
giant dragon is following a dangled suspended cow to the shoreline
Hector dangles the cow closer, they're now nearing shore
The big crocodile, eyes on the prize, is moving in for the flank steak
The time is now
- We're in about four feet of water now
- Little closer
Three, two, one
The crocodile then suddenly thrusts up after the cow, snapping at air
Hector pulls up with the chopper
(') Fire
Jack, Gare, and other officers pump the beast with tranq darts
But Hector has taken his chopper up too fast, causing the cow to swing like a pendulum
It rocks the chopper
- Oh, shit
The chopper is in trouble
The cow sways, the helicopter struggles to stay airborne
-   - (screaming) Watch out
Keep firing
The men continue to pump the beast with tranquilizing darts
- Hector's having trouble righting his chopper
Motherfucker
- Suddenly the croc goes up and grabs the dangling cow, snapping off the cable
Shit
And down comes to the chopper, Hector cannot control it
It crashes into the lake
Hector
(to Keough) Take him
can't
'll get Hector
Where is he
We gotta get to Hector
(to the driver) Back us in a little, we need to get a shot
Hector pops his head out of the overturned chopper
He looks around
Where is he
(to the Deputies) Tranq guns down, rifles up
The men switch guns, under-- (') (yelling to Hector) Do not go in that water
(to the driver) Back us in
As the pick-up backs closer to the shore-- (') (to Keough) If you get a safe shot
'll take it
Hector
Do not move
The water is calm again
beat
(') (to Gare) You see anything
(looking through binocs) Nothing
Maybe he swam out
Upon which the croc comes thrusting up out of the water charging the truck
Screams
Go
Drive
The pick-up spins dirt, lurches forward, throwing Keough off balance
The croc heads back for the water as Keough regains his balance
(') Take him
And Keough blasts
It detonates the ground near the croc causing him to surge airborne into the water
And he goes under
Silence
beat
Did you get him
don't know
(to the Driver) Back the truck-- No
Hector, you see anything
on the pontoon of his chopper
He's looking about, studying the water
No
(sarcastic) just have this feeling everything's totally safe
(yelling) see blood
Maybe you got him, Hank
And as Hector looks further
Behind him
up surfaces the crocodile in all his stealth
His head is two feet from Hector and nobody knows it
Least of all Hector
(') can't see him, but this is definitely blood
Maybe you got him
And as he turns back, he sees it
The croc comes up as Hector screams, jumps off
Screams
Keough leaps off the truck and charges into the shallow water with his gun, looking to give Hector some cover
Hector then resurfaces swimming to his bobbing chopper
He climbs in
Where is he
don't know
No sooner said than the croc comes launching up
As he springs toward the open chopper cabin, Hector, leaps out on the other side
The croc's head comes crashing clear through the cabin and he becomes wedged
The crocodile is stuck, he protrudes right through the chopper
He's not completely immobilized but wherever he goes now, the helicopter is going with him
Hector
But now Jack has joined, rifle in hand
Hector surfaces again, swimming for shore
Jack runs to help him onto land
(') (taking aim) Alright
Game over
But the croc looks feeble now
He lets out this  of
And even Keough hesitates to pull the trigger
(') (to Kelly) Should
Wait
The croc, unable to dive, is now thrashing toward the beach
But there's no rage in his behavior now
He seems desperate
He's taken some bullets, he's tired, he's wedged inside a two ton piece of metal and he's exhausted
think the drugs are kicking in
Breathing heavily, he lumbers into the shallow water, unable to free himself from the mangled wreckage
As unbelievable as that cow looked dangling from this very chopper, the sight is even more astonishing, if not preposterous, now
thirty foot exhausted crocodile is wearing the broken helicopter
And he just cannot go on anymore
Kelly, Hector, Jack, Keough, stare back
They approach with caution
They all stare at the tired crocodile
He's now looking back
Bleeding, gasping
beaten
In his eyes
we can see it
The beast is beaten
There's no triumph
In their eyes
sadness
don't think we really want to wait for him to catch his breath
It continues to breathe heavily
He's through fighting
Look at him
don't care
Hank
End it
Keough raises his cannon
No
Look
He's got nothing left
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger-- Upon which, a twenty footer, another croc, thrusts up out of the water, seizing Hector
Screams
It death rolls Hector, flings him out of his mouth and in seconds, he's coming up for more
Keough blasts his Avenger
direct hit
It takes the smaller croc's head right off sending it sailing into the air
It splashes down, the first head not to hit Kelly
They all then go for Hector, pulling him to shore
He's bleeding
'm okay
You're not okay, your leg's a mess
Get him onto shore
He heeds a tourniquet
Keough quickly peels off his shirt
Gives it to Kelly, who goes to work
(') You're gonna be okay
Guess  finally got bit
Yeah, you got bit
'm gonna fix it
sudden
Kelly screams as Jack and Keough wheel to see
the big croc
Maybe his final roar, he looks weak
in the crashed chopper
Jack and Keough approach
(quietly; re the big croc) He's done
He's dying
Don't count on it
(then) We better take him out
But something about this crocodile
his eyes looking back at them
nobody wants wants to take him out
looking back at them
He knows he's in their hands now
He knows
beat
(quiet) Flax him under his tail
Two hundred cc's
Under the tail, that'll put him to sleep
Upon which we  the  of
Florida Fish And Game, Wildlife, arriving on the scene
Thank God
, Florida Fish And Game, emerges, approaches
Stares with utter disbelief
We need to get it some medical help
(re Hector) And him too
By now the Florida army has moved in
They all stare with the same suspended disbelief
(explaining) We trapped him with our chopper
: - crew, including vets, are working on the sedated croc, trying to free it from the wreckage
the  with Hector, on a stretcher
Jack, Kelly, and Keough are there
We're gonna airvac him to Portland
Okay
(to Hector) That's where they're taking the croc, Hector, they've got some big tank there
He's gonna live
Yeah
Thanks to you
And Hank
(to Keough) know you weren't really trying to hit him
(gently) was aiming for you
Hector smiles
Thanks for the rescue
Jack leans down
You take care
You talk to Bickerman
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off
Women's intuition
Are there anymore
Just those two
We gotta take him
Okay
We got room for one
Well
got stuff to pack up and
He looks to Kelly, but before she can say "yes"-- (grudging) 'll go
Hector smiles
The Paramedics board Hector
Keough turns to Jack
Thanks for your help
You too
Handshake
Respect
That's about as much affection as you get from Keough
He then extends his hand to Kelly
'm sure this would offend you on principal but
could we keep in touch
guess
And she kisses him on the cheek
Keough fights off his blush, boards the chopper
As it then lifts up, Kelly turns to Jack
Well
You wanna ride in my truck
(arriving) Your truck is jammed
Should we take some stuff out
No, no, 'll be a while anyway
'm gonna say goodbye to the lake
You sure
don't mind
No,  actually want to stay for a little while
They hold a look
Then-- (') 'll miss you most of all scarecrow
And she kisses his cheek
If 'm ever in New York
Yeah
They hold another look
'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and
(a beat) But we do
(then) Hey, we'll always have Maine
He smiles
It was
something meeting you
Likewise
He kisses her hand
Holds a look
Heads off
: - The tents are down, everything's packed
couple trucks remain
The croc is gone
Things are quiet
Kelly stands down by the water, staring out
Hypnotic beauty
The lake doesn't even ripple
She soaks it in as if she knows it may be a while before she ever gets close to this again
She  every
Including a
Serenity has returned
Then suddenly
a stone goes skipping out, four, five, six skips
Kelly turns around
Jack stands there
They hold a look
thought  should say goodbye to the lake too
He approaches
Takes her hand
(weakly) Different worlds, Jack
Yeah,  thought about that as  was driving
and
haven't found somebody in my world
You found anyone in yours
No
So  was thinking
maybe if  met anybody in my world who was good for you and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up
You think
Worth a try
We don't wanna be alone forever, do we
Probably not
They hold a look
He kisses her softly
That was
y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now 'll be able to tell him if you can
Good thinking
And they kiss again, this one escalates a little
They break
And then he holds her
Tightly as the    to an of them, embracing at the water's edge
: -   - Police cars, lights flashing, motor down the highway
Behind them
on a flatbed truck
a thirty foot giant crocodile
Headed down the southbound lane of the Maine turnpike
Rolling
Rolling
Rolling along
It doesn't even look ridiculous
We've become accustomed to such sights
As we lift up higher and higher, Richie Havens' " "
Eventually, we: : - Jack and Kelly board his vehicle
They drive off, as we: : - Daffy Mrs
Bickerman sits at the end of her dock, feet dangling in the water
Throwing bread crumbs
Cute little Buttons
Mommy loves you
Come eat your supper little buttons
Nibble Mommy's toes
Three, maybe four, crocodile hatchlings, a foot in length, are swimming near her feet, eating the bread, nibbling her toes
them,  happy Mrs
