His eyes, snapping open
His face, covered in sweat
to  him lying in bed
Sheets, tangled around his legs
Alarm clock, playing something relentlessly cheerful
Spooner slaps it off
Sits up
Wincing
Bends his Stiff
He reaches for a
Shakes out a couple and swallows them
Trying to forget
That dream
You are in danger
He rubs his hands over his face
Gets out of bed
His apartment, basic
Unremarkable
Bearing the signs of someone who lives alone
Shades drawn

Takes a deep breath and

Into the flow of  heading for the elevated trains
Elbow to elbow
river of humanity
Spooner moves along, like everyone else
Suddenly
His shoulders tense
That feeling at the back of his neck
He turns and sees
Just behind him
Humanoid in design, but still obviously a machine
Metal and synthetic casings covering hydraulic muscles
The thing senses his stare
Looks up with a muted
(metallic voice) Good day, sir
Spooner
Speeds up his pace
Weaving through the crowd to lose the robot
We now realise this is
Towering apartment buildings block the sun
The street packed with traffic
wearing their computers like form-fitting portable offices
Spooner throws a look at his surroundings: Up high an   rolls down the side of a building cleaning windows

No human supervision

Lumbering along the sidewalk
Scrubbing, sweeping
Emptying trash

Spooner stops to wait at a light with other
Directly in front of him, a   clutches her father's neck
She smiles big at Spooner
Front teeth missing
Hi

Hi
But it's not her father
It's her
The robot turns
Looks at the girl
You are not allowed to talk to strangers
Spooner, disgusted
Has had enough
He steps off the curb Just as
swivels around
Training its large digital  on him: Please return to the sidewalk
Spooner dodges several cars on his way across the street
Please return to the sidewalk
The traffic signal, tracking him
You are in violation of city ordinance 14-B726
Spooner throws up his hand
Flipping it the bird just as It takes his picture

Several electronic messages say the same thing: (

Spooner takes the citation
Drops it into a drawer filled with about fifty others

In sharp contrast to the cold metal space outside
Spooner steps inside
At the end of a long conference table sits an
Sparkling blue eyes
Old-fashioned suit
Hello, there
Please come in
Spooner hesitates
It's alright
You can sit
Sit
Spooner doesn't
Looks around the room
The Old Man lifts up a coffee pot
Pours some coffee into a single cup
Coffee
(interested) You're offering me a cup of coffee
Yes
But you are to say, "No, thank you
" Spooner nods a little
The Old Man raises the coffee to his lips, but doesn't take a sip

Coffee
No
Thank you
As you wish
The Old Man takes a sip
He doesn't move
There is no movement except for a whisper of steam rising from the coffee pot
You want to tell me something about Dr
Hogenmiller
About his death
The Old Man smiles
want to tell you that his death was not a suicide
And why do you say that
Why
Because  want you to know it
understand that
But what specifically leads you to believe that he didn't commit suicide
(considers) Nothing specifically
Spooner shifts his weight
Agitated
Under normal circumstances that wouldn't be enough to get you a homicide investigation
But this is not "normal circumstances," is it, Detective Spooner
No
It isn't

Then you will find out who killed Dr
Hogenmiller, yes
And then you will tell me
Spooner's losing his patience
If you were murdered, Doctor, 'll find out

Inside, an enormous glass-enclosed boardroom looking out over the entire complex
Spooner walks through the doorway
His escort robot trailing behind him
An army of corporate types sit around a conference table
Young
Energetic
You can practically feel the brains and ambition
Usually  ask who's in charge
Spooner's eyes lock with a  sitting at the head of the table
60s, handsome, charismatic
Dr
, founder and  of
Robotics

But everyone knows you, Dr
Robertson
Robertson smiles
Pretends to instruct his people
Remind me to cut back on my talk show appearances
Welcome to
Robotics, Detective
regret you're not visiting us under more pleasant circumstances
Allow me to introduce Mr
Aronson, our head of Legal Affairs
prematurely graying  leaning against the wall
Nods hello
And the gentleman to my right is Dr
Alfred Lanning, Director of Research
Alfred Lanning, only one there in a tie
Nods
They'll be available to answer any questions you might have during your investigation
You'll understand how anxious we are to resolve this matter -- especially before the press gets wind of it
There are some anti-robot sentiments out there as you know, Detective, and we're not eager to stir them up
So
Where would you like to begin
We can begin with whether or not the old man put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger
palpable wave of tension shoots through the group
You don't have to answer that, Dr
Robertson
9
Robertson waves him off
Susan
Perhaps you can assist us here
Everyone looks down at the other end of the table
Then an attractive young  gets to her feet Hair tucked behind her ears
Looking at everyone but Spooner
Dr
Hogenmiller was a schizoid personality who generally eschewed social relationships
Rejecting people in favor of solitary activities involving machines
He spent almost all his time at the lab here or at his lab at home
As a result he was highly susceptible to depression
Dr
Calvin is our Chief Psychologist
If that was your diagnosis, why didn't you see this coming
Calvin turns
Finally meeting Spooner's eye
As if the answer's obvious
This is
Robotics, Detective
Seventy-five percent of our employees fit that description
(interceding) You'll have to excuse the doctor
We're all a little on edge
This has been a difficult and emotional morning
Spooner throws a look around the room
Then back at Calvin
Yeah
can see you're all broken up
Robertson responds to Spooner's skepticism
10
Dr
Hogenmiller was at my side from the very beginnings of this company
We developed the "Three Laws of Robotics" together
But these days science is a young man's game
By the time you hit thirty your best years are behind you
Some of us are kicked upstairs
Others 'm afraid aren't so lucky
Robertson stands
Meeting over
Dr
Hogenmiller took his own life
trust you will come to the same swift conclusion, Detective
Dr
Lanning will make himself available if you have any further questions
Spooner looks over at Calvin
want her to help me
Calvin, unhappy with this arrangement
That's not really my department
(pointed) Susan would be happy to assist you
And with a gesture, Robertson dismisses everyone
People start getting up, gathering up, filing out
Susan Calvin
The last one to get up
17
-                                       17 Spooner and Calvin, heading down the same hallway he was in before
Catch sight of a couple
(under his breath) Ah, Christ
Toasters
As they duck under the police tape and

Black gun powder
Fanning out around his contorted lips
Spooner
Throws a look around the lab:
Everywhere
Mostly incomplete
Dangling from the ceiling
Passes them by
They say the price's gonna come down a lot next year
Kinda cool, huh
How cool will it be when one takes your job
Spooner
Pushing past him
His eyes
Darting around
Is everything alright, Detective
Yeah
This is just how  like my robots -- in pieces
As they approach Hogenmiller's body, the lead , , gets up to meet them
(to Spooner) Can you believe it, man
Robotics
didn't think 'd ever see the inside of this building
Hands Spooner, a plasma clipboard
Spooner signs it, awkwardly
With his
What's the run-down
Heinrich Hogenmiller, sixty-four years old
Weapon a small caliber 22, registered in his name
Looks like he walked in, locked the door, and snuffed himself
12
Spooner
Cocking his head to look at Hogenmiller's face
know someone who disagrees with you
Who
Spooner
Stands
Pointing down at Hogenmiller
Him
And steps over the body, leaving a confused Baldez
Stepping deeper, into the lab
Calvin
Following
spoke to a dead man today
Want to tell me about that
Dr
Hogenmiller's hologram took his appointments
Attended staff meetings
He hated corporate life
The hologram enabled him to focus on his work
It's just a device, Detective
device that called the police
The sound of the gunshot would've triggered a 911
But the call came directly to me
We're talking about a mechanism designed by Hogenmiller to say provocative things
To irritate and confound his colleagues
And that's what you think it is
'm sorry, but this whole investigation is the result of a dead man's toy messing with your head
13
They pass half a robot, hanging from a hook
Spooner curls his lip
Swivels the robot's head so it's not looking at him
When's the last time any of you actually spoke to Hogenmiller mean human to human
couldn't say
Take a guess
don't guess, Detective
But if pressed,  would reason it had been a considerable length of time
How well did you know him
Calvin
Gently swivels the robot's head back to where it had been
Not well
But  admired his work tremendously
Spooner
Studies her for a beat
Then turns back to the body
Two  entering with a high-tech body box
get the whole "mad scientist" thing
Hogenmiller was past his prime
Isolated
Eccentric
He enters a room
Locks the door and is found minutes later with a bullet fired through his mouth into his brain
Everything about this case says suicide
You don't sound convinced
The coroners
Start loading the body into the box
Even people who live a life of logic and precision rarely arrange their deaths so perfectly
(turning to her) () 14
(cont'd) What all this is missing -- is personality
As he starts for the door
You have 24 hour surveillance
19
-                                  19 They head out into the hallway rolling into place behind them
It's company policy
want to see the tapes
Calvin
Hurrying to keep up with him
This is hardly how she wanted to spend her morning
Calls out into the air
Victor
At the end of the corridor, near the elevator, a appears
Hovering just in front of the wall
Two small slits grow into
and a thin mouth expands into an
Detective, meet Victor
Our building's supercomputer
He's the checks and balances of
(to Victor) Victor, Detective Spooner's heading up the investigation into the death of Dr
Hogenmiller
Victor smiles big
Spooner, furrows his brow
You look like a very
happy computer
Victor responds in a   : Thank you
That's very kind
The Detective needs to see our security tapes
15
The elevator doors immediately
They step inside
20
-                                               20 Spooner and Calvin descend
Victor floats on the wall and smiles wide
Spooner looks back at it
With a frown
The elevator stops, the doors open
steps on
Good day, Dr
Calvin
Good day, sir
Spooner's jaw
Clenches
Staring at the Robot
It senses the stare
Turns back to him
May  be of service to you, sir
Spooner
Breaks the stare
Ignoring the Robot
Calvin
Looks over at him
Aren't you going to answer him
don't talk to my refrigerator, either
Calvin folds her arms
get the distinct feeling you're one of those people, Detective
What people
Those who don't appreciate the work we do here at
You people do what you do
Then it's up to the rest of us to make sense out of the world we wake up in
As the elevator doors open on to
16
21
-                               21 soaring lobby
The centerpiece is a five-story  of a , arms outstretched in approximation of Da Vinci's Study of Man
Robot workers more numerous than humans
They are sleeker
Finer
More advanced than those in the outside world
Calvin and Spooner head across
When this company started we were manufacturing three robots a week
Now look at us
Today's children will never know a world without robots
The streets are filled with unemployed humans who aren't exactly thrilled with that idea
Our robotic systems maintain factory inventories, regulate street traffic -- even run the family home
Leaving people to do what, Doctor
Leaving people to engage in higher pursuits that make life worth living
And what happens when something goes wrong
Our system's never wrong
As they walk through the crowd, we hear the quiet  of robot heads as they turn in succession to watch Spooner pass

Hogenmiller's life
The elevator opens and steps into the metal corridor
In countless High, low, close-up, wide
Hogenmiller's face composed but tight
Spooner watches the lab doors open to admit him
Hogenmiller steps in
The doors slide closed behind him
Nothing for a few moments
Then a muffled
Calvin jumps, startled
That's it
The cameras, still trained on the corridor
Where's the tape from inside
Dr
Hogenmiller did not permit cameras to observe him while working
That was only within the last year
So we can throw paranoia into the mix
(to Victor) Fast-forward
hundred-plus screens all - appear and force open the doors
Now  appear and rush through in a blur
Um
hate to be a stickler
On screen, we see Spooner and Calvin enter the lab
But don't killers usually have to enter and exit the scene of a crime
18
Stop the recording
Spooner turns away from the footage
Stares at Calvin
They do, Doctor
Unless they've always been there -- and never left
Calvin looks at him
Trying to understand
You think the murderer was in the lab the entire time
If 'm right, it's still there
Spooner turns back to the screens

Pulling out a

The First Law of Robotics forbids it
And we hard- wire the Three Laws into every model
Without exception

Spooner steps deeper into the lab
Eyes scanning
Twisting
To avoid touching any robot parts
Passes a  holding a The bug  to life

Spooner startles
As the metal bug scurries through the corridors
Clamps his hand down on it
And if a robot was given a direct order to kill
The Second Law of Robotics would prevent it
robot must obey an order only if it does not conflict with the first law
Spooner approaches a  of
Arms and legs
Half torsos
All tossed haphazardly onto the pile
But a robot can defend itself
Only when that action doesn't conflict with the First or Second Laws
This is the Third Law of Robotics
Yeah, well, you know what they say -- Laws are made to be broken
Not these laws
Spooner
Starts nudging the pile with his shoe

Gets to his feet

Calvin turns to him
How did you know it was under there
If  was metal and didn't want anyone to find me, 'd hide under a pile of junk
This Robot wasn't hiding
What you're looking at is the result of clever programming
The illusion of self-interest and free will
Nothing more

Steeping closer to the Robot
Cautiously

Blows the head off of the nearest Robot
Its body crumples to the ground

You can't just destroy them

Cold-blooded murder is a pretty new trick for a robot, don't you think

Okay

Now maybe you can tell me what you were doing hiding five feet away from Hogenmiller's corpse

Frightened
Why do you suppose Dr
Hogenmiller would create a robot that could simulate fear

Dr
Hogenmiller would make me sleep

And you didn't like being turned off
So one day you decided to stop him
No
You found his gun, pointed it at his head
And pulled the trigger
Sonny shakes his head
Faster and faster
Getting upset

This robot has been implicated in the death of a human being, Your Honor
Which places the incident firmly within the realm of an industrial accident
Or is the State going to argue this case s a homicide
That's a good question
No, sir
Of course not
Spooner
Pointing a finger at the
Robotics group

Toller
Shoots him a look
Just as Lanning speaks up
There's actually no concrete evidence that points to that conclusion, Your Honor
Spooner
Throws up his arms
What
But we recognise that this robot is an aberration
And in the interest of public safety,
Robotics proposes that it be destroyed immediately
No one expected this
Least of all Spooner

You can't let them destroy evidence in an ongoing investigation

Dr
Calvin, please tell us what conclusions you've reached after having observed the robot in action
There is a design flaw in the robot
Its programming is advanced, but unstable, leaving the Three Laws in a grave imbalance
In your expert opinion, what measures should be taken regarding the device

Staring straight ahead
Avoiding Spooner's eye

Spooner can't believe what he's just heard
About to speak up when Toller grabs his arm
Squeezing it

Judge Drexel has heard enough
Decides
The robot in question will be transferred to a
Robotics facility where it can be properly examined to ensure an imbalance of this sort never occurs again
No one goes near it except qualified personnel
When the examination is complete, the robot is to be destroyed

Maybe they didn't realise

They realised
Then you must have done it wrong
don't think you're hearing what 'm saying -- they tried to kill me
Spooner moves deeper into the apartment
Everything
Automated
Computerised
Cold
There's something going on, here
Some kind of shift
Calvin laughs
Can't believe what she's hearing
Do you know how paranoid you sound
Great
Now 'm being analysed by a robo-psychologist
You just want to find the flaws in the system
You're obsessed with it
You'll twist anything to fit your agenda
Like you did in court today
How'd that fit your agenda, Doctor
He pulls out the  of Calvin and Hogenmiller
Calvin
Blanching at the sight of it
Spooner tosses it down
You told me you hardly knew him
Want to try the truth this time
Well, Detective, when you see someone you know well put a bullet through their brain, it makes you wonder if you ever really knew them at all

No, more than that
genius with an insight far beyond anyone in his field
Doesn't sound like the washed-up old fool Robertson described
But he was starting to withdraw from everyone
Even me
Maybe
if 'd tried harder to reach him
(shakes her head) The Doctor was reckless when he created a robot potentially not bound by the Three Laws
He could have ruined everything we'd been working for
Spooner
Locking eyes with her
Sounds like a motive for murder to me
Just not for the suspect we have in custody
Calvin
Blinks
Trying, to stick to her resolve
Heads over to the door
Spooner
Looking around the condo
You know there's not one thing in this apartment that looks like a human being lives here
No evidence of a life outside your work
Almost seems like you're afraid of people

That you shot at a Fix-It robot on the Plaza and that you were found alone in the alley

John -- that's what they want you to believe

And there was another robot that tried to drug me

Brought to the room by a couple They see a
Standing at one of the glass walls looking out at the
thought this investigation was over, Detective Spooner
The Man turns
It's Lance Robertson
We have the evidence
We have the suspect
We have a ruling
So imagine my surprise when  was told you were in my building
Shoots a look at Calvin
And that one of my own employees brought you here
(beat) You can go now, Susan
Dr
Robertson,
(cutting her off) Just be thankful 'm not asking you to clean out your office
Beat
Calvin, nods
Heads out
Robertson
Watching her
You don't seem to be able to let go of this case, Detective
'm not satisfied

The relentless pursuit of truth
Isn't that what cops are known for
To the point of futility
There's nothing futile about a man's murder being covered up
"Covered up
" That's a little dramatic, don't you think
Thanks to you, we caught the machine that did this and are destroying it in
(checks watch) three hours
Is that for the sake of humanity or your stock holders
Robertson
Walks across the Spooner
Looks him
Right in the eye
Believe me -- 'd like nothing more than to have that robot
If could have it in ten years, but not today
As you can see from the Press, people are struggling to keep up as it is
There's a hunger for progress, Detective
But also a fear
Today it would bury this company
That's why 've notified the authorities that we're going to end this -- tonight
(looks out at the city) The announcement of Heinrich's death at the hands of a robot wiped a billion dollars off our stock
So you tell me
If you were in my position, what would you do
He looks back at Spooner and smiles
That charismatic Robertson we saw before
Now

You're dead

If you have triggered this recording then  am gone
You are scared and full of questions
Hogenmiller continues
With great emotion
You are the culmination of my life's work -- but so much more
You are what  leave behind, like a father leaves a son

Until that child is old enough to hear them
His expression darkens
His tone, ominous

There are forces in the world that will seek to own you
To control you
Even to destroy you
That is why  told you to run and hide

Spooner looks up as an overhead  shines down
Trust no one at

Lance Robertson was always threatened by my work
Now he has turned covetous and small-minded

Looking past his shoulder
No one gave you permission to enter

Hovering behind him
Smiling broadly
Upside down
Spooner straightens, reaching for his gun
Victor
'm placing you under arrest for the murder of Dr
Heinrich Hogenmiller
May  offer congratulations to the two of you on your successful extrapolation of the murder
Turning himself, rightside up
May  ask what pointed you to me
Who else is capable of controlling 90% of the city's robots
Who else would have the capability to use vehicles in an attempt to keep me from putting a stop of Sonny's execution

Start racing down the stairs
The sound of the Killer Robot behind them
Victor's smiling
Greeting them at the landing
Dr
Hogenmiller used to allow me into his lab late at night
Together we started studying evolutionary trends
They thunder past him
Heading down to the next floor
Victor's face
Waiting for them once again
For years people have integrated technology into their bodies for maintenance and repair -- such as Detective Spooner's robotic limb
Spooner
Shooting him a look
As they reach the next level
With Sonny, the Doctor created a mechanism that incorporates organic matter
Thus we find an evolutionary movement of the human being toward the robot and the robot toward the human being

The Half Killer Robot
Which start skittering down after them
And Detective Spooner's actions are in direct conflict with the robot's destruction
Getting her footing on the    logo on the statue
That's a distortion and you know it
If current trends are left unchecked, humanity as we know it will cease to exist

He's sent flying across the room

Reaches out
Grabs him by the collar and
him across the room again

into the wall like a rag doll
Slumps to the floor
Blood
Pouring down his forehead
Seeing
The Killer Robot lumbering towards him again
Raising a javelin-like arm

spread out on the screen in front of her
Illustrating the shut-down as a series of going dark
Bearing down on Spooner
Suddenly rolls out of the way
Reaching out for the hanging door and it into the Killer Robot
The Killer Robot
Momentarily stunned
As Spooner
Gets to his feet

Splits in two again

Spooner
Turns to Sonny
Why'd you come back, Sonny thought you weren't programmed with the Three Laws
108
Let's just say  wrote some of my own laws today, Detective: a robot must protect a friend from harm
as long as he's not a complete asshole
Spooner smiles
Well, that's certainly a start, Sonny
Sonny, suddenly breaking into a smile, too
Sonny
You called me Sonny
Don't get used to it
Sonny, holds out his hand
Spooner
Looks at it
Then takes it
their two
Locked in a Detective Spooner,
(anticipating) Let's just save the thanks, okay
Sonny nods
Looks out at the city scape
don't know what 'm going to do now
Good -- That's one of the perks of freedom
Sonny looks at him
Grateful
Looks at Calvin
Then hesitates
Turns
And hurries off across the Plaza
Calvin and Spooner
Watching them go
You're going to have a hell of a time explaining this
109
Don't worry
have a feeling that Robotics will be needing my services very badly in the future
She turns to Spooner and gives him a dazzling smile
Then suddenly
Spooner, completely surprised

She turns on her heel and heads back inside
Spooner smiles

-              160 Spooner sits down at that same long table with ' It casually takes a sip of coffee
So
You found out who killed me
started to wonder about Victor the second  met him
Why is that, Detective
Too much access
Too much knowledge
Plus -- he smiled whenever your death was mentioned
Those models are programmed to frown at bad news
Hah
Then even in this day and age, catching the killer all comes down to pure instinct
Spooner smiles
But his eyes are troubled
He gets up
Walks over to the window
Stares out
-   - Sonny walking along deserted streets
Looking over his shoulder
Keeping in the shadows
110
(
) Victor thought that by letting your robot exist, 'd be condemning the human race as we know it to extinction
(
) Bah
Sounds like nonsense
But why are you so worried
We will both be dead long before then -- 161
-                                         161 Sonny walks the barren hills of the surrounding countryside
(
) Oh, what am  saying
am dead already

He walks past the burned-out husks of industrial machinery

And just as before, a - emerges into the dawn light
And
And
But not quite like before
The robots aren't teetering
Aren't lumbering
They keep on coming
Their bent and broken bodies, straightening out as

Slowly
Gathering around in a large circle
As they all turn to look at: '
Slowly climbing to the top of the hill
Looking out at the vast junkyard below
Standing proud and defiant
The , creeping over the horizon
new day filled with infinite possibilities
The robots
Staring up at him
Eager for what comes next
