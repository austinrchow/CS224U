Platoon : : ',   ,
' The sound now of a -130 air cargo plane roaring over us and we cut sharply to: -   -  - As the -130 coasts to a stop, the hatch rotating down on a hot, dusty lifeless airstrip somewhere in Vietnam
Nothing seems to live or move in the midday sun
step off the plane, unloading their duffel bags, looking around like only the new can look around, their hair regulation-clipped, crisp, new green fatigues fitting them like cardboard
is just another one of them - as he turns into a tight closeup, to look at a motorized cart pulling up alongside He's about 21
Newmeat
His face, unburned yet by the sun, is tense, bewildered, innocent, eyes searching for the truth
They fall now on a heap of   in the back of the cart
Two soldiers begin loading them onto the plane
Flies - hundreds of flies - buzz around them, the only cue to their contents
(next to Chris, Southern accent) That what  think it is
1 (a look) guess so
An uncomfortable look between them
Okay, let's go
As they move out, Chris' eyes moving with the body bags being loaded onto the plane
Moving over now to a motley bypassing them on their way to the plane
They look happy
Very happy, chatting it up
They pass the newboys - and they shake their heads, their eyes full of an almost mocking pity
Well 'll be dipped in shit - new meat
Sorry bout that boys - 'sin loi' buddy
you gonna love the Nam, man, for-fucking-ever
Chris looking at them
They pass, except for the last man who walks slower than the rest, a slight limp
His eyes fall on Chris
They're frightening eyes, starved, hollow, sunken deep in his face, black and dangerous
The clammy pallor of malaria clings to him as he looks at Chris through decayed black teeth
Then the sun flares out on him and he's past
And Chris looks back
Disturbed
It's as if the man was not real
For a moment there
As if he were a ghost
Chris walking, duffel bag on the shoulder, looks up at the lollipop sun burning a hole through the sky
rushing now
Of frightening intensity, an effect combining the blast of an airplane with the roar of a lion as we hardcut to: -    - The sun matches the intensity of the previous shot as we move down into thick green jungle
We hear the sound of  coming, a lot of men
The thwack of a machete
Brush being bulled
We wait
They are getting close
The  continue to run
reads: December 1967 - Bravo Company, 25th Infantry Division - Somewhere near the Cambodian Border
sweating white face comes into view
- cutting point
Machete in one hand, whacking out a path for the platoon, -16 in the other, he looks like he's on the verge of heat exhaustion
Breathing too hard, pacing himself all wrong, bumping into things, tripping, not quite falling, he looks pathetic here in the naturalness of the jungle
An urban transplant, slightly neurotic and getting more so
His rucksack is coming apart as well, about 70 badly packed pounds banging noisily
Behind him  now comes, the Platoon Sergeant
Then the , his radio man, humming lightly
Others are behind, the column snaking back deep into the brush
We cut around some  of the Platoon - all to be seen later
Young faces, hard and dirty after weeks in the field, exhausted yet alert, fatigues filthy, slept-in, torn, personalized, hair way past regulation length, medals, bandanas
jungle army
Boys
Chris glancing down at his raw bleeding blisters
Transfers the machete to his other, slightly less blistered, hand
The kid cuts on - struggling but trying, on his last reserves of strength, smashing almost straight forward through brush, not even bothering to look ahead
He smells something, looks around, slows his pace, eyes working
around to the base of a tree
He moves past it
And as he does so, the camera from his  comes around on a dead decomposing 10-day-old  - eyes starting from its sockets, worms and flies feasting
Chris draws his breath in, terrified
Barnes suddenly appears alongside, his hard humourless eyes looking annoyed from the gook to Chris
What are you waiting for
He ain't gonna bite you
Move out
Chris looks at him with pent-up hatred and crashes on
-  - At the  ,   on the radio
Bravo Two, Six
What's the delay up there, move it out on point
We've got a link up at Phase Line Whiskey at One Eight Zero Zero, over
-  -  -- At the  ,   sweats heavily as he speaks in his radio
He is also new to the field, a dark little feisty guy, about 24, very hairy, especially in the eyebrows, an intense get-ahead look
Two Bravo, Two move it out
Six says we're jamming 'em up back there
Over
Barnes, upfront, turns to , his radio man, under his breath
Tell that dipshit to get fucked
Get that other freshmeat up here
Gardner
As Barnes picks up his pace, irritated now at this reprimand from the  - coming up on Chris, who is soaked now from head to foot in sweat, dizzy, feeling sick, about to vomit
(') What the hell's the matter with you Taylor
You a sorry ass motherfucker
Fall back
He grabs Chris's machete out of his hand and bulls his way into the foliage, tearing it apart, setting a new pace
Chris being bypassed by the column, their eyes on him
He is swatting at the red ants that are all over his neck
, another new recruit, fat, hustling up to replace him
big and black medic -  - comes over, gentle eyes and manner; with him is Sergeant , concerned
You okay
Ants
got ants on my neck
(shaking them out) (helping him) Yeah, black ants are killers, you look sick man
You need a little salt
(reaching into his satchel) Sergeant Elias, a handsome, graceful dark-haired Indian kid of 23, the squad sergeant, is taking items out of Chris' pack - air mattress, extra unnecessary clothing, extra canteens, grenades, gas mask, books
(shaking his head, amused) You're humping way too much, troop, don't need half this shit
'll haul it for you but next time you check it out with me okay
Chris nodding, grateful, panting
The men passing, watching
Chris sorry about this, trying to keep up face
, a young 18 year-old with an angel's face, is pissing in the dead gook's face
passes, glances at him
You're a sick mother Bunny
Bunny laughing about it
Chris standing there one moment, fighting for his breath, suddenly passes out, going over with his 70 pound rucksack, hitting the ground with a loud bang
(concerned) Hold it up
On Chris - his eyes opening
He seems all right
(trying to get up) 'm okay
'm okay
Chris crumples backwards
Elias helps him
#1 - The  - about 100 men who seem insignificant amid the size of the surrounding jungle - is digging into a perimeter of some 100-yard radius
lifts off in a flurry of blowing leaves
Bare-chested soldiers chop down trees, clear fields of fire, set out claymores, fill sandbags, chow down
Little fires snake up against the greying red horizon
31 - '  - We cut close on a pair of grungy feet - the staple of the infantry - moving up to , the Medic, bandaging them for , a Hawaiin kid
#1 - '  - Rhah sets his tripflare
Crawford, with him, putting out a claymore
#1 -  -  - Back in the perimeter  sets his -60 in the newly dug foxhole
, next to him, is shaving in his helmet
#1 - '  - looks like a king
lion of a black man but with a sleepy, gentle face, not to be roused, is painfully trying to scrawl a letter home with the pencil held awkwardly, mouthing the words
, a young baby-faced black with long lashes and soft eyes, peeks over his shoulder, shaking his head
Shit, King, it ain't d-e-r-e man, it's d-e-a-r, and Sara don't have no two r's in it, fool
Shame on you
King shrugs, a sleepy stoned voice
Don't matter, she knows what it means
an she don't read too good nohow
#1 -   - Sgt
Elias washes himself, attentive to his body, slender and well-muscled, and extremely handsome youth
Of Indian blood, with long black hair, generous smile, wide facial bone structure, gypsy eyes, and the cleanest white teeth, he could be a young Greek god
He is given somewhat to panache, a silver wristband on his arm, a bandana of black parachute silk hanging from his neck, his fatigues tightened down at the ankle, he pulls his pants down, checking for crotch rot, applying talcum powder to the area, his buttocks facing us
, a white kid, 19, from Florida, stopping to admire the frontal view
Mumm, any time sweetheart
Lerner, you'd choke to death on it
#1 -   - At the    a beehive of activity with its four radios, personnel, some Vietnamese scouts milling around
is running down a field map with his Harris, a broad-shouldered fine-looking military specimen with the requisite Southern accent and football coach mannerism, is directing his remark to 2nd Platoon's
, who looks a little nervous
Sky Six reports a fresh company of  moving across from Cambodia to this blue line
(points to position) We got a good chance to light 'em up tonight
All platoons will set squad-size ambushes before full dark
Lt
Wolfe (glances at him) You 'bush in this area near that ol' Buddhist temple we passed on the hump in
Lt
Hawkins, you take this area in the rubber plantation
(eager) No problem sir
#1 - '  - Elsewhere, Chris scrapes out a foxhole, his shirt off, bandana around his head, the work hot and heavy
is out there setting the claymore as   and start breaking down their 's
(a whining high voice) Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man
(laughes loudly) Fuck you bitch
'mon man, didn't  do you right that time  give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit
Tricky bitch, reason you gimme dat turkey loaf is nobody else can eat that shit 'cept me so don't start your game playing with me Junior
They're both black, Junior with huge goggle eyes and a face of pimples and pockmarks, his teeth yellowed and decayed, some of them missing
Harold is about twice his size, about 250 pounds, a baby huey concentrating real hard on preparing his stove to eat with
Youse a pig man
hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking
He's a fool alright but you a bigger fool
Hey, whiteboy, watcha waiting for - dat hole ain't gonna dig itself
Chris looks up, continues working, as Junior chuckles
(') Hey Taylor, you don't know it but  saved your ass today
killed a shit-eating dog
(laughing) (getting up) That reminds me,  gotta take a shit
You gonna wipe your ass dis time
Yeah if you let me have your shirt
( , as he digs) Somebody once wrote Hell is the impossibility of Reason
That's what this place feels like
hate it already and it's only been a week
Some goddamn week, grandma
(checking his raw blisters) the hardest thing  think 've ever done is to go on point, 3 times this week -  don't even know what 'm doing
gook could be standing 3 feet in front of me and  wouldn't know it, 'm so tired
We get up at 5 a
m
, hump all day, camp around 4 or 5 p
m
, dig foxhole, eat, then put out an all-night ambush or a 3-man listening post in the jungle
It's scary cause nobody tells me how to do anything cause 'm new and nobody cares about the new guys, they don't even want to know your name
The unwritten rule is a new guy's life isn't worth as much cause he hasn't put his time in yet - and they say if you're gonna get killed in the Nam it's better to get it in the first few weeks, the logic being: you don't suffer that much
can believe that
If you're lucky you get to stay in the perimeter at night and then you pull a 3-hour guard shift, so maybe you sleep 3-4 hours a night, but you don't really sleep
don't think  can keep this up for a year, grandma - think 've made a big mistake coming here
As he speaks, we cut around to various shots of the platoon members on the perimeter - shaving, eating, cooking, playing, etc - Towards the end of this voice over, we cut to Sgt
moving towards the
powerful face, a quiet, angry fixed stare, a thick trimmed moustache that helps conceal a network of plastic surgery grafts and scars
The distortion from the jaw up the left side of his face to his forehead, punctuated by a severe indentation above the left eye where a bullet once penetrated his skull
Walking with him is Sgt
' as they join , Sgts and  at the   where they're huddled over maps
Warren is a black, thin, tall, paranoid man with untrusting eyes, silent and bitter
(to all, almost pleased about it) We got boo-coo movement
3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here
(the  react with wary silence) ' (eager to elaborate) Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces
Barnes inflects his next words at Wolfe, who is worried
Yeah, they got two Lieutenants and a Captain
Jesus
Elias quiet
Barnes studying the map
(') (to Barnes) Who do you want on ambush, Sergeant
Barnes doesn't bother acknowledging the question, barely glancing at the Lieutenant, to him a necessary evil
Everybody knows who's really in charge of the Platoon
Barnes flicks his gaze to Elias
Elias - you take your squad and 'll take Tex and Francis from your squad
(to Warren) We move out in two-zero mikes
(concluding) thought it was 'Neill's turn tonight
They all look at each other
'Neill spits in the dust, a freckled, short red head with a hard worried face, a lifer, 30 going on 60
' Shit
Morehouse and Sal are short
Fu Sheng's going on &, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush
You got the fresh meat Elias
(to Barnes) They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something
' So what am  going to do
Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep
Hey 'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know
' Fuck you Elias
You get your men ready Elias
Concluding the debate, no further argument, Barnes rises
The meeting's closed
Lt
Wolfe hasn't said a word, looking as Elias departs, without a word
' (watching him) Fucking guy's got 3 years in and he thinks he's Cochise or something
His resentment directed partly at the way in which Elias carries himself, the natural sense of grace - and the dignity it bestows
: #1 -    - Later
On the very edge of the perimeter, darkness coming down fast, the men in the ambush patrol rustle into their packs, all of them bitching
Tex, carrying the -60, looks up at the glowering sky
Shit, looks like rain
All night too
Gonna grow mushrooms in your bad-ass crotch Junior
(under his breath) Goddamn ain't no justice round here, you break your ass for de white man
gonna get our act together, do some rappin' wid de brothers, change things
What's 'Neill have a nose up the lieutenant's ass already, how come we always get ambush
Politics, man, politics
We always getting fucked around here
Chris is scared, nervous with his last-minute equipment adjustments, his pack obviously overweight for a night mission as he hauls it up
Gardner, the other new boy, is jovial in contrast, his wallet extended towards Chris
Hey Chris,  show you a picture of Lucy Jean
(not to be bothered) No
Gardner shows him his girl
She's real dog u-g-l-y, and what makes it worse is Gardner's put the standard photo of Raquel Welch alongside it, tits and all
But he misses the irony of it
(admiring) Yeah she's the one all right
that's Lucy Jean
She's a-waiting for me
(nodding) Yeah she's real pretty, you're lucky
Gardner puts it away
Elias appears alongside them, checking their packs out, takes out Chris's poncho liner and other items
He carries a modified -16 with a short barrel and a collapsible stock
(to both boys) Don't need this or this
you're doing okay
Just stick close to Tex, do what he does
(calling out to Tex) Tex you got Junior and Taylor here on your position
Tex is a sour Texas Ranger type, chews tobacco, spits
Damn, 'Lias this gun's boss
Put Taylor someplace else
Chris feels the words like lashes on him
You got Taylor
(to Gardner) Gardner you go with me (to Chris and Gardner) 'Case somethin' happens to you, you get separated or lost don't yell out okay
Sit tight
We'll get to you
His eyes
Chris watching them
smile in them
Elias moves off, a quality to the man that Chris admires
natural sense of leadership
Okay, let's move out
As he follows King, on point, out the perimeter
single file
() Night is coming down
The tone of the jungle sounds has subtly shifted - mellower, more sinuous and certainly scarier
The file stops
King, an experienced point man, listens
Chris - carrying Tex's linked ammo - looks around, tense
Behind him is Gardner, trying to smile, starts to whisper something ('Hey Taylor
') when he's abruptly shushed
The file moves on
Gardner's pack rattling a little too loud weird rush of cold wind now rattles the trees and the comes
hard slanting rain, sudden, tropic
-  -  () piece of an old Buddhist temple, under a sulky moonlight now in a state of decay, the jungle surging to engulf it
The Men are setting up quickly and relatively quietly in the ruins - alongside a miniscule trail
The rain is coming down harder than ever
Chris and Tex setting out their claymore mines, raveling back their detonating cords to their position, drenched
In the far distance, an   brightens the sky for a brief moment
Various ad lib curses and directions are lost in the sound of the rain
- '  -  () At the Ambush , Ace whipsers into his radio
soft hissing sound
- '  -  () Later
Close on Chris being shaken awake
Taylor, you're on
(groggy) Uh hunh
The rain continuing to pelt them
Tex hands him an infrared scope
(suspicious) You sure you know how to work the claymore
(offended) Sure
Tex curls up as best he can in his poncho to sleep
Okay
don't catch no zzz's on me buddy or 'll sling your motherfucking ass
You hear me
(grits his teeth) Yeah
(looking at his watch) Hey Tex - you're ten minutes fast
Sin Loi
('tough luck', closes his teeth) Chris lets it go, scans the jungle and trail with the scope
The is greasy and blurred
He puts it aside
Suddenly a series of resonant  crack through the jungle
Chris starts, then sees it's from  lying out there, spreadeagled in the rain
Chris prods him
Junior
Unh
Unh
Shaddup
You're snoring
Shhh
Bending low into his eardrum
Junior never wakes, rolls over with a growl
Silence
: '  -  () Later
pool of muddy water has formed, in which a pair of buttocks sit
Move up to Chris still on duty, looking at his watch, drawn, drenched, pathetic, rainwater coursing down his face
(
) (continuing his letter) 'Course Mom and Dad didn't want me to come, they wanted me to be just like them - respectable, hard- working, making $200 a week, a little house, a family
They drove me crazy with their goddamn world, grandma, you know Mom,  don't want to be a white boy on Wall Street,  don't want my whole life to be predetermined by them
large   as the wind blows down a big tree branch onto the jungle floor
He starts, peering out
Nothing
He looks at his watch again
(
) (') guess  have always been sheltered and special, just want to be anonymous
Like everybody else
Do my share for my country
Live up to what Grandpa did in the First War and Dad the Second
know this is going to be the war of my generation
Well here am - anonymous all right, with guys nobody really cares about - they come from the end of the line, most of 'em, small towns you never heard of - Pulaski, Tennessee, Brandon, Mississippi, Pork Bend, Utah, Wampum, Pennsylvania
Two years' high school's about it, maybe if they're lucky a job waiting for 'em back in a factory, but most of 'em got nothing, they're poor, they're the unwanted of our society, yet they're fighting for our society and our freedom and what we call America, they're the bottom of the barrel - and they know it, maybe that's why they call themselves 'grunts' cause a 'grunt' can take it, can take anything
They're the backbone of this country, grandma, the best 've ever seen, the heart and soul - 've found it finally, way down here in the mud - maybe from down here  can start up again and be something  can be proud of, without having to fake it, maybe
can see something  don't yet see, learn something  don't yet know
miss you, miss you very much, tell Mom  miss her too - Chris
He moves towards Junior, shakes him, but Junior seems to be out of this world
(') Wake up
Junior opens one dead eye
(') It's your shift, man
Junior scowls, swears, looks around for his rifle in the mud
Chris crawls back to his position, curling himself up in his soaked poncho, teeth chattering from the cold, rain splattering over him
long beat
He sighs, the sigh kicking off the next image
'  - Chris jerks awake - very suddenly, very frightened The jungle sounds are loud
Cicadas, night animals, water dripping hypnotically from leaf to leaf
And the whirr of a million mosquitoes out after the rains, chewing at Chris' face
He looks around, startled
Tex is asleep
Junior is asleep
What happened
He looks at his watch
The mosquitoes are eating him alive
He buries his head in his green towel which he wears around his neck, but he can't see
beat
He moves again, miserable from the bites
Another beat
Then suddenly the sounds of the jungle shift - some of the animals dropping out
different tone
piece of wood is stepped on, a rustle of bush
Chris sees something, lifts an edge of the towel to peek out
shoadow of a figure is frozen there in front of him about 15 yards
It looks like a man
But it doesn't move
At all
It listens
Chris, his heart in his mouth, tries to peer through it
It's a bush
It has to be
No human being could stand that still
His heartbeats are up
The moments take forever
But deep down - somewhere in his psyche - he knows who it is
The figure now shifts, ever so slightly - and moves
It  a human being
Oh my God
Chris looks around
Tex seems like a mile away
Why doesn't anyone fire
He casts a desperate look at his rifle, at his grenades encrusted with mud, but in spite of all his training, he is frozen with indecision and fear at the sight of his enemy
The figure seems to whisper something back, then turns and comes down the trail
Now a second and third figure appear behind him - all in helmets and packs
All coming right past Chris' position
Ten yards
Nine
Chris is rigid with terror
Stark eyes
Pleading with Tex to wake up, but out of reach
He is about to have an anxiety attack, his heartbeats so far up he is sure they will hear him
The first figure is now directly in front of Chris on the trail, looking left and right
rattle of his equipment, a creak of leather
smell
The man's face now catches the moonlight and his eyes come around on Chris
Oriental eyes
Looking right at him
Startled
Chris staring back, hypnotized
It all happens very fast
The figure murmurs something in Vietnamese
warning
He swivels
flash of muzzle fire
raking cough of automatic fire grenade explosion
Chris is hurled to the ground, helmet bouncing off, scattered, confused, jarred
All hell breaks loose around him with and
Tex, kissing the ground, is yelling at him
Chris, not knowing what he's doing, is fumbling with the claymore handles, presses them
: They won't give
He tries again and again to the squeeze the life out of them
Tex is screaming at him
(') Lunges over and grabs the handle from Chris
Clicks the safeties off and blows them
Three  rip out into the night - and one of the  is caught in a brief instant looking like an -ray, his body lifted and swirling in the air, then enveloped in swirls of smoke
Chris, trying to keep up, grabs his -16, lays out a stream of fire
The sound all around him is deafening
'  - Gardner, freaking out, stands crouched, confused, tries to run, collapses
''  - 'Neill throws a grenade, wild
'  - An explosion
Chris hits the deck
Tex is now on the -60 machine gun, yelling at Junior who is cringing on the ground
Feed me
He lays out red tracer bullets like laser beams, then suddenly reels back, whiplashed, screaming
grenade explosion rocks them
(') His hand and wrist are gone, his face in the dirt
Junior is fumbling around, trying to stay down and help him at the same time
(grabbing Tex's gun) Chris, looking out to his front, has no clue what's going on
Except the fire is slacking
Relayed shouts of 'Medic
Medic
' Other
The firing has ceased
silence, punctuated by occasional shouts and fast moments, has enveloped once more the cemetery
Doc crashes through the bush, kneels over Tex, who continues to howl in deep pain
(freaked out) Easy Tex easy boy
Trying to sound calm but his voice is on the edge, examinging the mutilation with a pen flashlight, he whips out his morphine in a big hypodermic
(next position) Doc over here
Gardner's hit
'Right there
As he slips the morphine into Tex's arm
(muttering at Chris) godamn
Godamn
,
Chris watching, suddenly feels himself dizzy, instinctively runs his hands over the back of his neck
Feels the warm blood there
moan comes from his lips
Junior looks at him
Oh shit, Doc he's hit too
(weakly) 'm hit
Barnes and Big Harold come hustling up
Doc finishes tourniquetting Tex, cradles Chris onto the earth, his flashlight probing the wound
Tex in background continues to thrash and moan
Chris waits, tensely for the verdict, his eyes big with fear on Doc, who takes out his morphine
(to Barnes, pointing at Chris) That dumb fuck didn't blow his claymore
Chris hearing this
Barnes looks at him
(to Chris) it's a scratch, nothing to worry about
(suspicious) Doc
tell me the truth, don't lie to me
The needle goes in
Tex lets out this strange keening moan that sets everyone's teeth on edge
(to Barnes) He let'em walk right up on us
He was sleeping on his shift
(muttering weakly) was not
it was your
(leaving, to Harold and Junior) Self-preservation's the first law of nature
Gotta learn how to work your shit Taylor
Watch me, don't let'em go into shock
Tex's moans are maddening and scary
Barnes suddenly clamps his hand over Tex's mouth shutting him up and from way down deep in his throat, chokes out the words
Shut up
Shut up - and
Tex's eyes roll wildly, uncomprehending
Doc and Big Harold looking at Barnes, wondering
Tex is suddenly silent, shocked
Barnes stands, an icy glare, goes
Junior scrambles over to Tex's side
Doc runs off
Big Harold cradles Chris, his big black hands like a mother, reassuring him
You gonna be okay Taylor, okay, don't you start worrying now
Chris looking up at him, eyes blinking slowly, dazed already by the morphine
He's very scared
Do you
do you know you're gonna die
Big Harold
do you feel like
like
everything's gonna be fine and then
Bullshit man, you gettin outta the field, man
Three hots a day, white sheets, dem pretty white nurses give you blowjobs too you pay em enough,  heard tell bout dem white bitches
Better save yo strength Taylor
(muttering darkly) Don babytalk him man
Cocksucker fell asleep
They walked right up on us, he don do shit
Shaddup bitch
Chris is gettin woozier, feeling he is dying but starting to grin, not caring about it anymore
Yet he is nowhere close to dying
It's not
so bad
dying
How long
it
-  -  #1 - Barnes stands over a moaning, ripped up
his -16 point blank into the head
The Soldier bucks and dies, quivering
-  -  #2 - , checking out a blood trail some distance away, shifts on the shot, looks back
-  -  #3 - , ,  and  are huddled over another mangled enemy corpse
(stripping the corpse) That's no  man
That's a chink - look at 'em, the cocksucker's six and a half feet tall
Look at his gear - good as ours
Shit  blew my claymore right in one dude's face and seen him walking around afterwards
What we fighting here, vampires
-  -  #1 - Elias comes up to Barnes swiftly, indicating the blood trail leading off into the bush
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body
How the hell did he get away
Fuckers returned fire soon as we lit 'em up
Hard core fuckin'
They got their shit together
(coming up to Barnes) Sarge - Doc wants you
There's a problem with the new man
Elias and Barnes go with King
Past Chris and Tex who are ambulatory and bandaged, being helped along
As Barnes passes, the men look at him, everybody quickly senses something is wrong
'  - At one of the positions Doc is working feverishly to knock the life back into Gardner who lies there, his shirt stripped off on his cottage cheese belly
huge sucking chest wound
He's dying
You know it because he knows it
The eyes do the talking, numb, terrorized yet strangely detached, accepting, not protesting or concerned any longer
Most of the ambush has assembled and is watching, Chris moving in to see
Doc is mumbling to him, low key
Chopper's on the way Gardner, hang in there, you gonna be okay
But Gardner seems unconcerned
Things are going on in his head - who knows what
And in his eyes there are big tears rolling
Then a morphine smile
sort of goofy Gardner smile, maybe thinking about Lucy Jean, who knows
He's dead
(to all) Take a good look at this lump o'shit
(motions to Gardner's body) Rmember what it looks like, all of you
You fuck up in a firefight and  guaran-goddamn-tee you, a trip out of the bush -
Out here, assholes, you keep your shit wired tight at  times
(glares directly at Chris) and that goes for you, shit for brains
You don't '
Next sonofabitch  catch coppin' z's in the bush 'm personally gonna take an interest in seeing him suffer -
He thumps Chris lightly but menacingly in his chestbone and moves on
(drowsy) didn't fall asleep, Sergeant, Junior
(pissed, cuts in, shoves him hard) Shut your face chicken shit
You in big trouble boy
' Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one
Knock it off
We got two men need attention here
Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks
Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner
(muttering) Let de white boy carry his ass, he this dude that got him fucked up
Who'd be hauling his ass if that was a brother laying there
Elias follows Barnes out of earshot of the others
Man'd be alive if he'd had a few more days to learn something
Barnes, registering it, just keeps on walking
-  ( ) Chris is driven up in a jeep to his Company  - marked 'Bravo ' on a -ration box
It's midday on a hot lazy afternoon, few people out in the 102 degree sun
Chris' Company is on the outskirts of the base camp, their barracks regulation wood, canvas, and fine mesh screening, red dust everywhere, bunkers down on the perimeter, reams of barbed wire and concertina, a sand-bagged   and , 81 mm mortar pits, observation towers, recoiless rifles, 50-caliber machine guns
Chris gets out of the jeep, stiff-necked, a bandage around it, still in some pain
The first man he intersects is , carrying crates of beer
Hey Taylor, what's in the breeze
In King's mild tone Chris tries to read his standing in the platoon
Okay - got light duty, three days
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway
What you got there - beers
Yeah, just stole me some from the Top's supply but he's stealing it from us anyway
(sees somebody coming) Chucks are coming
You better 'didi' man
Too late
Sgt
', the redhead lifer accompanied by Spec 4 , a big handsome blond kid, not too bright in the face, both slightly drunk, come around a corner, beer cans in hand
'Neill sees Chris immediately
' Hey Taylor - you back
(pause) Uh, looks like it
(spotting King's beer) Where'd you get that beer King
(a funny look) found it
You found it
Bullshit
You going on report
Gimmee that shit
' Awright, come here both of you
You too Taylor (wags his finger) Got a little special job for you
They advance toward him reluctantly
got light duty, Sarge
Doctor said to take it easy couple days
' (laughes) ain't that tough shit now
- wooden cabin with some half-dozen seats built over half barrels cut from empty oil drums
guy is in there, pulling up his pants
Chris, King and Crawford, a California blond with a handsome honeyed look, are sweeating heavily as they roll the barrels out from under the outhouse, the smell of human waste strong
hot midday emptiness, nobody around except the flies
(pissed) Motherfuckah, motherfuckah, 'm too short to be dealing with this shit
They keep fucking with us man, no letup
(equally pissed) Politics man, fuckin' politics
That 'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and 'm a gone motherfucker
Back to de
(dreaming in his eyes) Broke a 100
Got 92 to go
April 17
man
California this summer
Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good
March man in Tennessee, sniff the pines
sniff that crossmounted pussy walkin' down by the river
What you got Taylor
(a snicker) Let's see three hundred and
32
332 days
(groans) Oh man
Sorry bout that
can't even remember when was 332
You gotta count backwards like you got 40 days in - think positive
(to Chris) How the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated
volunteered
You
Say 'gain
Yeah,  dropped out of college and told 'em  wanted infantry, combat, and Nam
He grins, finding their reactions funny
It's also the first time we've seen Chris crack a smile
You volunteered for this shit man
You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man
King has long sleepy eyelids and cat's eyes, a large pink tongue and big white-edged cotton picker's nails - a lazy, gentle nature, content with the world
Didn't make much sense
Wasn't learning anything
(hesitates) And why should just the poor kids go to the war - and the college kids get away with it
King and Crawford share a smile
What we got here a crusader
Sounds like it
They pause, wipe the sweat off
King lighting up a half-smoked joint, hitting a few puffs, eyes shooting around, making sure he's not spotted, passing it to Crawford
Sheeit, gotta be rich in the first place to think like dat
Everybody know the poor always being fucked by the rich
Always have, always will
Noticing Chris is having trouble with his neck, picking at his bandage
(') You okay man
Neck botherin' you
Nah
Here have some of this
Won't feel a thing
Chris looking at the joint, a little apprehensive
He's never smoked
No, thanks
Go on, whatcha gotta lose, yo' here now
Kills the smell of shit anyway
The joint proferred
Chris waits a beat, shrugs, takes it, smokes
Suck it in
Hold it
That's it
Now let it out
Chris blows it out
Don't feel it
King and Crawford chuckle, go on rolling the cans
Dat's what they all say
: -  - King, Crawford and Chris pour kerosene over the cans at a secure distance from the outhouse
King lights it
The cans pop and start crackling
line of burning barrels
Rings of dirty black smoke rise against a soft blue sky
They watch, stoned
Chris turns to both of them
you know that night we got hit
(ashamed) Fuck it, don't mean nothing, no such thing here as a coward, done your best man, next time y'do better
History, man, history
Chris surprised at their attitude
The joint suddenly hits him, a look in his face, eyes looking around different
Over at King
(deadpans) think 'm starting to feel that stuff
Crawford laughes
(laughes) Yo getting there Taylor
You be cool now and 'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'
What are the heads
(laughes, walks away with Crawford) Later
Chris alone, breathes deep, feeling the full effect
- relief against the long harsh, hot day
We see lights on all over the camp, sounds of music, laughter from the barracks
- King leads Chris down to a specially constructed cellar-like hutch dug deep into the ground on an isolated edge of the battalion perimeter
Ammo casing and canvas are piled over it, and sandbags surround it
From the outside very little sound can be heard as they go down through a trap door made of ammo crates
Past a lookout (Adams) pulling security, hitting a joint but alert
King motions to him, it's cool
Inside is another world
Chris looking around amazed
It's like a private cabaret for the 'heads' who are there cooling out
Boxes of food from the States, beers, whiskey bottles, crates functioning as tables, hammocks hanging from poles, electric fans, tape decks, paraphenalia
The boys are all dressed up in their Saturday night rags
The clothes are clean, the headbands, the medallions are out, anything distinctive and individualistic
On the tapedeck, Jefferson Airplane's 'Go Ask Alice'
To Chris it is a new world
And , the resident head, sitting there in all his finery puffing a huge burning red bowl in a three foot long Montagnard pipe, seems to be the lord of final judgement in this smoky underworld
Across his naked chest, birds and snakes are tatooed
Around his neck a black skull and white ivory cross side by side
On his knuckles 'Love' and 'Hate' are tattooed
In his eyes, a dancing Satanic fire
poor rural Southern white, in his grizzled late 20's, he could be a Biker King
Giving Chris the once-over
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor
(smiling) This ain't Taylor
Taylor been shot
This man Chris been resurrected
Chris wondering what he's doing here
His eyes roving over , , , , , , , , other from the Platoon, about 9 or 10 of them
Rhah eyes him back, hands him the bowl
You lame Taylor
What
You lame or something
(smiling) go ahead on, smoke it man
Chris understands, takes the bowl
Hesitates
Then smokes it
The contact fumes are almost enough to knock him out
He starts coughing
They're all laughing
Your shit's in the wind troop
Baaaaah
Lerner replies, his tongue hanging out in parody
And Baaaaaaa
back on you
(looking at Lerner with distaste) If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right
Building up to it, his eyes shaking with conviction at the whole insanity of the world, he neighs with all the venom he can muster
(') Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
They all laugh and applaud
King smoking from the pipe passing it back to Chris who takes another hit, doesn't cough this time, looking around, wondering about these guys
didn't like it
Bah, you're a child, Lerner
Rhah don't waste time on you
They go on ad-libbing with each other, teasing Doc, who's fairly straight, saying he wants to go to med school in the fall
'Be what
'' gynecologist, man
''What dat
' Francis suggests, 'Dats a pussy doctor, man - he's gonna be Doctor Feelgood, man
' They're all cracking up, finding every joke funny
As Chris finishes his hit on the pipe, looks up across the smoke, already dazed, surprised to see  suddenly there - leaning out of his sling in a far corner of the hooch
Monkey is draped around his neck with silver bracelets, rings, a necklace - like a sensual little Egyptian whore, Elias playing with it, spaced out in a sleeveless vest, tiger pants
Dancing eyes on Chris, he swings out the hammock, comes over with the monkey
Meanwhile Manny has broken into a high falsetto snatch of blues directed at Chris, joined by Big Harold and Francis, all of them clicking their hands
&   & Oooh Chris, you look like you is high oh yeah, he looks like he is high Ooooh Chris, you know you gonna be that way all night oh yeah  think that you are Yeah
up now and up to par oh yeah
Elias pulls out a Remington 870 shotgun, jacks it to the rear, points it at Chris
Put your mouth on that
Chris does so slowly, a little worried
Elias takes a hit and blows it down the bore - 'shotgunning' it into Chris' lungs
Chris staggers back, coughing
Everybody laughes 'hey dude - you done had your ass blown away' etc
Elias smiles his big white-tooth smile
(') First time
Yeah
Then the worm has definately turned for you man
Chris puzzled by this expression
(') (smiles) Feel good
(a sense of euphoria now) Yeah
No pain in my neck now
Feels good
Feelin' good's good enough
As he sucks in a huge mass of smoke off the bowl
His eyes performing a funny little hop, skip and jump, as he holds it, his face turning red
The monkey jabbers and jumps around on his neck, worried
Elias then blows the smoke out in its face, the monkey hating it
The Group laughes
(') Hey Crutcher
hear you got a Dear John from your gal
Told you she wasn't getting 'nuff from you
Lerner looks up, stoned out of his mind, wearing a ring in his ear
Shit
Sold me out for some lame dude with a 4-
What'd you say her name was again
(recalling her image) Daisy Mae
Hey look at Charlotte
The monkey is sitting quietly stoned, its eyes blinking
Laughter off
Daisy Mae
What Daisy Mae look like Crutcher
She look huge and got freckles on her ass
She look beautiful
How much she weigh man
She braid her hair under her armpits, Crutcher
(sarcastic) Daisy Mae what
Daisy Mae Highway, that's what
(laughing) Well whatcha want, Lerner, your dick been limp for a year, 'cept when you're bopping your buddy Tony up there
Fuck that
fucked this chick in Hawaii man
Couple weeks ago Oooooh
Wow - outasight
Gracie Slick man, she looked like Gracie man,  shit you not
(remembering) The look on his face ensnares all of them, except perhaps Rhah
What happened man
What whorehouse you go to
No whorehouse man
On the beach
Sure
Yeah, sure
She walked right by me
Long black hair, tits swinging
Ass like French bread
Legs don't end right
(skeptical) You can plant that shit in Tennessee man, but it won't come up in Texas
So what she got, hair on her tits
just stopped man
My heart's beating like a hardon right  got a hardon sticking through my pants, my bathing suit looks like a hutch
know dat feeling
So 'm thinking to myself - Elias you walk away from this, you gonna regret this the rest of your natural life
So  go after her, follow her down the beach
You know find out if she is what she is
They're all hooked into this now
And
Well she was picking up her kids
Dat's dat
No, dat ain't dat
Get outta here, she married
Like two hogs in heat
Boy
Their throats knotting
(joining in) But what'd she do
What didn't she do
She fucked the living shit outta me, that's what she did
(sucking in air) Jesus
Couldn't get enuff
But what'd she actually do
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish
What dat
(finally hooked in) And living in Hawaii man
Yeah - and has blonde hair and almond-shaped eyes
Hey man didn't you say she had black hair
She had blonde hair man
And long tan legs, in those leather sandals you know, with those thongs up to her knees, this musky oil on it
mmmm smelled good when they were wrapped around my face
They groan, dreaming of Hawaii
Yeah
God
Please, somebody hold my dick
(in afterthought) and a broken nose
Broken man
Yeah, otherwise she would've been too perfect, y'know what  mean
some woman
Her name was
He forgets it
grass blackout
Lerner urging him on
Susan
Tamara
Elizabeth
Elias shaking his head, trying to remember
Merle
Merle
Jesus
Patty
Inga
Jennifer
Connie
Elias snapping his fingers
Dawn
That was it
(repeating it) Dawn
King listening to the sound of it
Dawn
The others nodding, musing over it
Yeah, Dawn
- In comparison to the darkness of the hooch, a highly lit atmosphere, attracting bugs
dusty gear lying around a disordered hooch, loud and finger-snapping playing from a tape deck, a well-known tune, circa 1967
, the 18 year-old angel face, totters drunk with a Colt-45 beer in hand, over to , the badass black kid with the zits, who just lies there on his cot sweating, doing nothing
(listening to the music) Listen to that shit, that's good shit

All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer

Smoke that shit everything kinda gets weird y'know
(hiccups, sits) 'hear that story the gooks is putting chemicals in the grass so's we become 'pacifists' so's we don fight (to no one in particular) Where the hell's everybody, they'se gettin high that's what - bunch of hopheads, they think they special
(turns away, bored) Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway
Yeah but  still like a piece of pussy once in a while - ain't nothing like a piece of pussy cept maybe the Indie 500
Youse so fucked up man
'ever look at yoself in the mirror Junior, youse uglier than a dick on a dog man

Shit,  bet  been laid more'n you have
Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there
Yeah
Only way you'd get some pussy is your bitch dies and wills it to you - and then maybe
Lt
wanders down the aisle, beer in hand, slightly lonely, bypassing  , the Hawaiin and , a mustached hairy- browed Italian kid from Boston, who are playing some kind of dice game
They hardly acknowledge the Lieutenant who stops by , the Mexican-American kid who is on his cot in his neatly arranged area writing a letter home with a pencil, forming his words with his mouth, as always minding his own business
Religious objects comprise his few decorations
(amiable) How you doing Rodriguez
Good sir
Need anything
No sir
Wolfe winks at him, continues on to the   going on in the center of the barracks, the main action
, Sgts
' and , the quiet sullen black,  and play as , the tiny radio kid, and  look on; all of them drinking beer and bourbon chasers from a bottle
(to 'Neill) How's it going Red
(using his nickname) ' Shit, cocksucker's got all the cards tonight
(to Barnes) Looks like you're doing all right Sergeant
Barnes, raking in the chips, is the big winner, a light bead of sweat on his forehead and a somewhat glassy look to the eye the only indication he is drunk - his shirt peeled off revealing a muscular, scarred body
Yeah, and  ain't even cheating yet
(the big blond kid) Have some Kentucky windage Lieutenant
(passes him the bottle of bourbon) Wolfe takes a nip
Play Lieutenant
Nah,  wouldn't want to get raped by you guys
' What are you saving up to be Lieutenant - Jewish
Laughes
Wolfe forces a smile, glad to move on
There is a continual worried rodent air about him, an anxiety, a desire to fill the vacuum in his leadership with a false masculinity
Catch you men later
Enjoy yourselves
As he goes, 'Neill shakes his head after him
' Sorry ass motherfucker ain't he
You think he gonna make it Barnes
Barnes plays a card, glances, a minute movement of his head
' (') Yeah that's what  figger
Some dudes you jes' look in their faces and you  they just ain't gonna make it
Barnes looks - with some irony - at 'Neill
The Country Western tune has reached a crescendo whine which now mixes into: - Francis, the baby-faced black, and Manny, green shades covering his skinny face, lead with a high blues falsetto
(singing) 'People say 'm the life of the party cause  tell a joke or two  Although  may be laughing loud and hardy  Deep inside 'm blue
The Hutch looks now like a Turkish bath with minimum visibility, the smoke fumes dense
They are all up dancing on their feet - King, Tubbs, Big Harold, Hoyt, Lerner, Crawford, Flash, Doc, Elias - a few light gestures with their hands above shoulder level, passing around the grass pipes while they shuffle, fingers clicking
The song - Smokey Robinson's "Tracks of My Tears" - accompanies them from a vintage tapedeck
'
Since you've left me, if you've seen me with another girl seeming like 'm having fun although she may be cute she's just a substitute because you're the permanent one
' King and Big Harold wave Chris into the Circle and he starts swaying with them, feeling as if he's being accepted into a new family
Rhah watches it all, puffing away on his magic dragon pipe, the shadows dancing on the walls
It looks like a Saturday night dance party
yearning for tenderness, for feminity, for a moment of peace in this nightmare life
Their eyes closed, thinking of dance partners that can't be here tonight
Singing their souls out
(') '
So take a good look at my face
You'll see the smile looks out of place
Look a little bit closer
It's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
' -    - An overwhelming 103 degree heat
Chris is once more on point, a little better now but obviously struggling with a thick unyielding bamboo thicket that forces him forward in a caveman crouch
Napalm jelly is hanging from the trees in great canopies of spider webs, obliterating the sky
(
) New Year's Day, 1968
Just another day
Staying alive
There's been a lot of movement neat the Cambodian border, regiments of  moving across lot of little firefights, ambushes, we drop a lot of bombs, then we walk through the napalm like ghosts in a landscape
Chris working his way over twisted, broken stumps, branches
On the back of his flak jacket he's written, 'If  die bury me upside down so the whole world can kiss my ass'
Pssst
The signal for silence
Chris freezes
Barnes edging up to him
(') (whispers) Bunker
Where
Doesn't see it
Following Barnes' imperceptible movement of his head
The bunker, dug into the ground and camouflaged with brush, is staring right at him, not more than 20 feet away
Chris is a dead man if
Barnes, checking the terrain, signals radioman Hoyt
Barnes edging up to the bunker, eyes everywhere
Chris following
The tension builds
They come up to the edge of it, peer in
Nothing
Barnes walks around it, slips in from back
Chris covers him, other guys coming up now, making a small perimeter
Chris now starts to see things he didn't see
Right in front of his nose - there is a trench from this bunker to another and another
There is now in his view a complex of bunkers and thatched hootches and lean-tos all blending into the forest ghost city
Elias and others fanning out now, careful
whispered conversations in the wind
Chris moves past a rope with freshly washed laundry stretching between two trees, clothes stirring in the wind
He looks up as King points out a treehouse, then looks down as Lerner whispers something and points -  rucksacks are laid out on the ground in an orderly platoon-sized pattern
: -   - Elias goes down into a dangerous-looking , on a rope with a 45
Barnes watching him
We sense Elias loves the danger, smiling
-  -   - Lt
Wolfe signals Manny and Chris out onto the two flanks
- Rhah and King explore a treehouse
Rice stores
Rhah, an experienced soldier, seems tense, moves cautiously, expecting booby traps
- '  - Sgt
Warren cautiously explores another bunker, probing a little tunnel in the bottom of it with a stick
Bunny, having a small frame, goes down into it, fearless
- '  - Manny, the skinny black boy with the coloured beads, is out on flank - alone, smoking a cigarette, humming
- '  - On the other flank, Chris, also alone, waits, listening to the sounds of the jungle
He too is smoking a cigarette
The eeriness is everywhere
Rays of morning light peeking through the cathedral dome of the jungle
Bird calls
- Elias climbs deeper and deeper into the hole, a rope attached to his waist leading out to the surface, his flashlight now coming around on a shaftway demarcating a  that seems to stretch for at least 100 yards
The light revealing cobwebs all along it, but tall enough for a small man
'  - It's quiet, weird
Chris takes his pants down, squats
He thinks he hears something, tenses
There is a soft rustling sound now
And as he focuses on it he realizes it is coming from very close to him
Something light and sinuous moving over the leaves
He looks down
bright yellow and orange-ringed krait viper is crawling right between his two legs
It stops, senses another life standing over it
Chris frozen with dread
The snake crawls on, pulling its long, long 15 foot body behind it
On Chris, eyes dilated, slowly regaining his breath looking around everywhere now
- Elias moving down the tunnel, fearless
We expect something any moment to come out and nail him but nothing does
He stops
His flashlight revealing a kitchen and an  hospital set up hammock swings as if someone just deserted it
In another hammock is a dead man
Elias advances cautiously
-  -   - Spec 4 Sanderson, the big handsome blond kid, is moving through an abandoned bunker
With him is Sal, a tough street kid with an intense face, all whiskered
Sanderson noticing now a metal box of 50-caliber ammo,
marking, half-buried in the ground
Hey look at that
He opens the case
Official-looking documents are inside, they glance through them, lighting cigarettes, the search over, successful, they relax
(a worried type) Leave it willya - it's gook shit
Nah this stuff's important
He puts the documents back in the ammo case, lifts it
It's the last thing he ever does
-   - The ensuing explosion shakes the ground, obliterating both boys, brances, smoke and dust flying out
-   - Out on flank, Chris hits the ground, hugs it
-  -   - Barnes runs up
Black smoke sweeping through the trees
Sal suddenly appears, stepping out of the smoke, stunned
The front of his body is soaked in blood from a thousand shrapnel holes, his clothes shredded, he stares at Barnes, dazed
Both his arms are gone and blood is geysering out like a water fountain
He crumbles - dead or dying
Corpsman
He runs over to Sal, gets a hold of his face in a vicelike grip, enraged, tries to yell some sense into him
(') (directly to Sal) Goddamit
Are you fucking kids ever gonna learn
Don't you understand how easy it is to die
The Doc running up - one look tells us all we need to know
Holy Jesus
-   - Lt
Wolfe, shaken, is on the radio with Cpt
Harris, words garbled through the air, trying to describe a primal horror
-   - Barnes moving through the wreckage - sees severed limbs sticking in a sandbag
-   - Rhah crouches over a piece of leg tied into a hipbone and a rib
- Elias coming out of the tunnel, filthied
-   - Elias coming abreast of Wolfe
Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos
is crawling with traps
They're on their way
(consulting his map) There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it , something's going on
where's Barnes
-   - Barnes is still there in the wrecked bunker, squatting there staring as if his mind has disconnected for a moment
He reaches up, touches his scars
The look on his face suggests he is deeply wronged by this tragedy, that he is taking it very personally
-   - Chris watches him from outside the bunker, awed
Barnes notices Chris watching him, takes a breath, stands
You gonna sit there and play with yourself Taylor or you gonna be part of my war
Awright, saddle up, let's go - Tubbs you got point
The men moving into jungle formation, silently
Chris walking over into line, stops for a moment - noticing a freshly-severed eyeball partially buried in dirt, staring up at him
He turns away, sickened
-   - ' Where's Manny
Manny
Hey Buchanan
There is no answer
The men in the platoon start to look at each other, sensing more trouble
Elias heads into the bush after him
Barnes watches him go
Francis, his friend, and Tubbs and King follow
Hey man whatcha doing
where you at
Get your black ass back in here
- '  - Out on the flank position, where he once stood, Elias walks out, looks
The jungle is silent once again
Francis, Tubbs, King follow
The others - Barnes, Lt
Wolfe, Warren, Chris, Rhah
(whispering loudly) Manny
Manny
Their voices trailing off
Bird cries come back
Elias combing the ground for clues
nothing
Chris looking on, can't believe it, none of them can, a collective chill running through the platoon
- The Platoon moving downslope in the Jungle, their faces grim, quiet, deadly
King is on point
(
) We had to get to the village before dark so we left Elias with some men to keep looking and to wait for the engineers
But it was King who found him
about 1000 yards downriver, not far from the village - It was the end of the mystery
moving shot approaching Manny
He's trussed with rope, arms behind his back
Throat cut, eyes startled open, mouth shaped in a scream of terror
Barnes, the other men looking
Chris
Barnes says it for everyone, 'The motherfuckers
' -  - They come up out of the jungle onto the side of a  , where a tiny village overlooks the river
The  is poor, a series of thatched hutches made of -ration cardboard and aluminum beer can sidings, faint whiffs of smoke coming from cook fires
Pigs and dogs wander about
An   watches them pass from his tillable plot, smoking a cigarette, one leg wrapped around his hoe, resting, no expression
(
) the village, which had stood for maybe a thousand years, didn't know we were coming that day
If they had they would have run
Barnes was at the eye of our rage - and through him, our Captain Ahab - we would set things right again
That day we loved him pig loiters along the trail, rooting
Bunny coming up on it with a smile
Hey pig, pig - come here, pig, pig
The pig grunts
Bunny leveling his shotgun, fires point blank
horrible squeal
Chris, directly behind him, looks disgusted
- Tony suddenly points, excited, calls to Barnes
There goes one
Their  - a young  fleeing down the slope
Barnes doesn't hesitate, nails him with a short volley of well- placed shots
(to Tony) Check him out
He turns back into the village
- Troops fanning out over the village, some scattering to collect their children, dogs barking
' Get em out
Get em out
- In another part of the village, Barnes hovers over a hole leading into some kind of tunnel
Get out of there you fuckheads move
Move
Fires a warning shot
Three  climbing out of the spider hole, arms raised, but not showing any emotion
Barnes turning to his radioman Hoyt and Big Harold accompanying
(') (to Harold) Put'em in the pig pen
(to Hoyt) There's more down there
Gimme your Willy Pete
Hoyt, with reluctance in his eyes, hands over a specially shaped grenade
Barnes stands over the hole, the grenade in hand
The three  who just came out of the hole, yell from the distance, to others still in the tunnel, pleading with them to come out
(') Barnes throws the phosphorus in
muted
Then sizzling acidic fumes
Frying sounds
hideous scream from somewhere deep in the hole
Hoyt, watching, is sickened
Barnes businesslike
The Villagers, in grief, howl and tear at their faces
(hustling up to Barnes) Sarge, we found some shit
Barnes going with him
-   - The sun is sittin there hot and high in the sky
Chris, strangling in heat, a demented look on his face, staggers into a hutch with Francis
-  - Threadbare, poor, a typical Buddhist shrine in the corner, motes of light crisscross through the poor matting and c-ration sides
Chris edges over, pries up a floorboard, flips it over, scared
There's a tunnel inside
long dark dangerous hole
La Dai
La Dai
Hey take it easy man
They're scared
They're scared
What about me
'm sick of this shit man, "m sick of this shit
They don't want us here
Who do you think they're fighting for Francis doesn't recognize him in his rage
Bunny now coming in, followed by 'Neill, drawn by the shouting
-   - Barnes stares down at a   buried cleverly underneath the ruce urns
Ace, Fu Sheng, Sgt
Warren, Lt
Wolfe, others, are digging it out
It's in white plastic wrappings - a load of - 47's, rockets, grenades, claymores, carbines, flares, uniforms
real find
(to Barnes) and over here there's enough rice to feed a whole fuckin' regiment
Barnes walking with him over to an undercover rice silo being dug out by Tubbs and Junior
Barnes looks it over
(to Warren) bring the honcho over here
(to Tubb and Junior) Burn it
-  - An Old Woman and her Son, a young man with one leg, throw up their hands, climbing out of the hole with stupid confused looks as Chris, shaking with his own sort of confusion and rage, cuffs them, hustling them out
The Young Man uses a pair of crutches for his blown-off limb, hobbling like a mangy three-legged dog
Hey look at this
Ma and Pa Kettle here
Look at them - greasy gook motherfuckers
Get up out of there
You see  didn't wanna hurt you
Why didn't you come out, when  said so hunh
Why
' The couple, hands raised, muttering things in Vietnamese, don't understand a word, shaking their heads stupidly and smiling that impassive Oriental smile which sends Chris into a rage only he can understand
His finger closes on the trigger of his 16
Francis, the baby-faced black, looks nervously, sensing the danger
Bunny amused, drawn in by Chris
'Neill watches passively from the lip of the hutch
The Young Man continues to grin, not seeming to realize the degree of danger he's in, which is what Chris wants - a token sign of acquiescence
There is also the added element of showing off his manhood in front of an audience now
Do 'em man, do 'em
Chris
The trigger
He pulls
But he can't quite bring himself to kill
The bullets exploding in the dirt at the edges of the young man's foot
(demonic) - ,
The Young Man hops up and down in a reflex fear of the sounds of the bullets as they thud into the dirt
Yet his eyes remain fixed on Chris in wonderment
Chris, firing out the magazine, seems to expend his bloodlust
He ceases, noticing - for the first time - the eyes of the Young Man
They aren't stupid - nor fearful - but filled with resignation and despair - a despair that Chris, in disgust of himself, recognizes
Chris lowers the rifle, silent
The Young Man's impassive face shines now with tears
That sad young look - as if death itself would've been a release
Chris turns his eyes away, an awkward sense of shame
(leaves) Let's get out of here man
But Bunny takes up the slack, moves forward on the young man
(to Chris) You chickenshit man, they're laughing at you, look at them faces
That's the way a gook laughs
The Young Man nodding affable to Bunny and mumbling ingratiating words in Vietnamese
(') Yeah sure you are, you're real sorry ain't you
You're just crying out your hearts about Sandy and Sal and Manny - they're laughing at us
Their family is out there in the fucking bush blowing us away and they're laughing at us
' (checking out the hutch) Forget it will ya, let's go
Chris standing there, watching, sensing something awful is going to come and unable to do anything about it
It comes - suddenly and without warning
Bunny is looking at 'Neill, the Vietnamese couple are muttering something
In one fluid move, Bunny swivels and with unbelievable savagery clubs the young one-legged man in the side of the head with the butt of his 16
' (') (stunned) Hey what are you doing
Fucker
The young man is groaning on the floor of the hutch
Bunny smashes him - again and again
(') That's for Sandy
And this is for Sal
And this is for fucking Manny
This is for me
Chris watches, horrified
Never in his life has he seen something so horrifying as this
And yet he does nothing
He is part of it
(') (stepping back, examines what's left of the head, amazed) Wow
You see his fucking head come apart
Look at that
never seen brains like dat before
Jesus fucking Christ
The Old Lady is shrieking, hovering over the body of her son
Bunny studying her
(') Betcha the old bitch runs the whole show
Probably helped cut Manny's throat
Probably cut my balls off if she could
(to Chris) Come on, man, let's do her
She cowers from him
Chris steps back, horrified
As is 'Neill, more puzzled than horrified
(') (hitting her again) Let's zap all these motherfuckers
Let's do the whole village
He backs out of the hutch, scared
Evidently Bunny is temporarily insane
But he spots 'Neill, yells at him
(') ' As he clubs her to death
On Chris' face, blood and brain tissue flying up into it
-  - tiny knot of men are ringed around Barnes who is questioning a sturdy-looking man who is the
He has been stripped of his shirt, scars all over his body, scared
He has his  papers out, trembling, showing them to Lerner who speaks some pidgen Vietnamese
Where'd he get these wounds
Lerner translates, the man talking back
He says he was hit in a bombing raid
He's a dink fosure
Ask him what the weapons are doing here
He says they had no choice
The  killed the old honcho when he said no
He says the rice is theirs
Bullshit
who the hell was the dink we just nailed on the riverbank
Chris and 'Neill come up, watch
Others coming from different places - sensing the narrowing drama
But half the platoon is still at work in the village
We hear shouts, grenade explosions, occasionally gunfire
He says he doesn't know,  haven't been around in a couple of months
Maybe it was a scout or
The men around Barnes grumble
Yeah sure it was
What about all that fucking rice and the weapons
who they for
(looking at the Village Chief) Cocksucker knows what 'm saying
don't you Pop
(a blank look) You're goddamn right he does
Lerner translating
The Village Chief's  is now on the scene, a middle-aged woman with angry features, yelling at Lerner trying to answer for her husband, a high-pitched barrage of indignant words directed mostly at Barnes, and interspersed with the spitting of her betel nuts on the ground
The Village Chief trying to talk her down
But things are definitely getting out of control
And the heat from the sun is only aggravating the situation, pounding down on the actors in the drama, their fatigues soaked in sweat and anger
(finally) He swears he doesn't know anything
He hates the but they come when they want and
He's lying through his teeth
Waste the fucker, then see who talks
What's the bitch saying
(overwhelmed) She's going on,  don't know - why are we shooting the pigs, they're farmers
they got to make a living, all that crap
The Woman is still ranting when Barnes turns to her, quite casually levels his -16, and puts a bullet in her head
She goes down as if pole-axed
stunned pause
The Chief looking at his wife
The Villagers in background reacting
Wolfe looking
Chris looking, shocked
Doc, possibly the straightest of them all, very uncomfortable
They are all shocked insome way, but do nothing against the power of Banres
Barnes walks over to the pig pen with the other Villagers, very casually, confronts them
(to Lerner) Tell him he talks or 'm gonna waste more of 'em
Lerner shaken up, muttering to the Village Chief who is in shock, kneeling next to the body of his wife, muttering in a high whine of pain
(') Go ahead, Lerner, ask him
group of Villagers huddle to one side
Lerner, shaken, is yelling at all of them, demanding an answer
They don't know Sarge, they don't know
(half believes it) Barnes turns his attention on the other villagers, his intentions apparent
Everybody feels them
They're next
Barnes is unperturbed, very much in command of the situation, no rage, no emotions expressed
Chris has never seen such a thing in his life - but can't react
Can't stop it, just watches it like he's not quite there
The same goes for Lieutenant Wolfe, for all of them
The very outrageousness of Barns' killing seems to quell all protest
(sensing the impending massacre) Hey Sarge can we get in on this
Tony advances, the hairy Italian kid from Boston
Let's go all the way, let's go for it
Let's do the whole fucking village
Come on, Sarge
Chris' eyes
Rodriguez next to him, is neutral but willing
Francis is hesitant
Fu Sheng and Junior are ready to go for it
Lt
Wolfe is powerless, frozen
Sgt
Warren stepping up
The massacre is just about to break
The Villagers know it, kneel in prayer, mutter
Barnes suddenly grabs and drags a young 19 year-old Woman, the Village Chief's daughter, across the pen, throws her down on her knees, in front of the stunned Village Chief
She's screaming
This his daughter, right
Lerner nods
Barnes pulls his
45, puts it alongside her head
(') (to Village Chief) You lie
You Vee Cee
caca ado Vee Cee
He chambers the
45, the Woman begging Barnes for her life, cradling his knees
He sticks the gun down above her skull
Chris wanting to cry out, to do something - but can't
suddenly flares out in the sun, advancing on them
It is Elias
Barnes looks around
They all look around
Elias walks right up to him, followed by his men - King, Rhah, Crawford, others from the rear party
He looks around
The corpse of the Wife
the Young Daughter sobbing
(') (pissed) Stay out of this Elias
This ain't your show
'   ,
The stock of his rifle swings up fast and hard smacking Barnes full in the face, breaking two teeth
Barnes staggers back, hurt, bleeding
Elias is on him like a leopard
Battering him with his fists
They struggle in the dust, two titans, their faces equally consumed with rage, clawing, spitting, punching, kicking, pounding each other's skulls in the dirt
dust storm swirls around them, the men closing around like excited apes at a bloodfeast
Most of the men seem to be pulling for Barnes - Chris just watching neutral
But they rool on, smashing each other's faces in
Both quick, fast, agile, mean fighters
Sgts
'Neill and Warren drag them apart
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias
- you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one
All right
All right
All right '
They compose themselves, the Villagers looking on, grieving over their loss
(') Alright, Six says torch this place
Blow the weapons in place
Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up
We ain't got much light left
(to Wolfe) Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant
What are you talking about
(turns away, goes about his business) (spins him around) You know what 'm talking about
No  don't
don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias
(goes) Who wants to be reminded
silence of shame
The Men moving away, Warren, Ace, Tony, Rodriguez, Barnes looking back once, a cold glare
The Village Chief is a broken-looking man, huddled over his wife's body
Elias stands there, frustrated
Chris glances at him, moves out
- zippo cigarette lighter with the engraved initials: 'From Mai lin to my Bunny Boy'
It sparks a thick flare as Bunny lights the dry straw on the roof of the Hutch where he killed the Old Woman and Young Boy
Their legs sticking out at the threshold
The hooch burning fast, aided by the strong sun
Bunny watches with awe
- Sgt
Warren and Rodriguez lighting another hooch on fire
- Fu Sheng yelling '
' throws white phosphorus into the rice stores
-   - Barnes and Huffmeister, a big German kid from Texas, are laying the cord to blow the weapons cache
-  - Adams and Parker are poisoning the well with a white phosphorus grenade: '
' - Wolfe, Ace, Tubbs, Warren, Rogriguez rope the together to take them back for questioning
Elias watches the Villagers mourn their losses
In the background, explosions, hooches popping with flames, the yells of the violations of the Village winding down
- Chris wanders through this wreckage in the sun, like a dazed visitor from another planet, not believing it
He sees something, goes towards it - knows what it is
-    - Hidden at the edge of the woodline, King hands back a bowl of grass to Rhah, the chief head
They're puffing away
Whew
- where that come from
Found it
Growing in a garden
(smokes) Sheeit, beats burning hutches anyway
They meditatively look out at the Village - burning hutches sending up spirals of smoke
Shouts
Shots
Chaos
Yeah - stoned's the way to be
-  - In a ditch running alongside the Village, partially concealed by foliage and anthills, Tony, Morehouse, and the ubiquitous Bunny have a 12--   pinned to the ground, gagged and squirming, naked
They are fucking her to death
Junior looks on, both curious and disgusted, but doesn't take part
Take her up the ass
As they roll her over, like excited dogs in heat
Chris, coming up, sees their heads dipping up and down on the other side of the anthill, knows what they're doing
He makes a conscious decision to do something
He runs over
He strides right into them, shoves them off hard
The girl is in tears
What the fuck you want - she's a dink
-
'
' '
'
He seems disconnected, dazed by the sun, like he's talking to dogs - loud, repetitive words coming out of an anger he can barely control, trying to restore some sanity to a world gone totally nuts today
Don't they understand
Don'tthey have any sense of a mind
Any kind of decency
The Men looking at him as if he's the one who's gone nuts, not them
Bunny looking at Morehouse looking at Tony looking at Junior
The irony is lost on them, as Chris pushes through to help the poor girl put her scanty clothes back on
(') (to the girl) It's okay
it's okay
Elias appears behind Bunny and the others, sees what's happened
He signals them to move out
Get outta here
The men grumble and slink off quietly
Elias watching as
Chris helps her to her feet, wounded in the intestines, she can barely stand, blood saoking in her nether regions
Chris slings her up as gently as he can and carries her
(as if to himself) It's okay, it's okay
-   - Near the pig pen, a   are being led away on ropes by Tubbs, Warren, Rodriguez
The others left behind look back at their village in ruins, homes burning, livestock dead or scattered, belongings thrown and broken in the dirt wail, the adults squat there on their heels watching with absolutely no trace of outward emotion
Past this Bosch-like canvas, Chris - carrying the girl - walks dazed by the horrors of this long afternoon
- The soldiers depart the village
huge  now rocks the earth and sends a spray of smoke into the blue sky as the weapons cache explodes in stages that sound like the end of the world
#2 -  - The Company is digging into another overnight perimeter on a ridge with a view of the Valley where the Village was
-Ration fires all around the perimeter
-  -- At the Company,l Elias, Captain Harris, Barnes, Lt
Wolfe are huddled
Close on Harris, looking from face to face, assuming a judicial attitude
and you Lieutenant
didn't see anything sir
did
That dink was reported to me as  sir by Sergeant Barnes
Sergeant Barnes
Squirreling out of any responsibility
My report sir, will include Lt
Wolfe as being witness to the shooting
All right, Elias
Sergeant Barnes,  want a report from you
You got it sir - and  can throw in plenty of eye- witnesses if you want sir
Not now
We'll get into this when we get back to base camp
Right now  need every man in the field, want your guys to stick together
Elias
Barnes
You hear me
This is no time for fighting with each other
(pause, they nod) Tomorrow we're going back into that bunker complex - from the East
(continuing) First Platoon will lead
Brigade thinks they might be back there tomorrow
That's all
Get some rest
(turns away) Barnes, Elias eye each other and move off
#2 - Wolfe walks alongside Barnes
Don't worry about it Sergeant, he won't be able to prove a thing, he's a troublemaker but
Barnes is obviously worried, although he doesn't let on
Elias' a waterwalker
like them politicians in Washington
Want to fight their war with one hand tied round their balls
Ain't no time or need for a courtroom out here
Wolfe leaves him as Barnes turns into his foxhole where Bunny and 'Neill await him anxiously
' How'd it go
Banres shrugs
Thataway Sarge, fuckin' Elias man, fuckin' squeal that's what he is, gonna get everybody in the platoon in shit
Somebody oughta fix his ass
Barnes fixing his coffee
' (worried) Gonna be an investigation or something Bob
Barnes says nothing, a cryptic look
'Neill worried, Bunny, taking his cue from Barnes, slaps him on the back
Ya worry too much 'Neill
#2 - '  - Elsewhere on the perimeter, Chris is digging out a foxhole with Rhah, as King and Lerner prepare the 's for dinner
know Barnes six months and 'll tell ya something - that man is , red in his soul like a dick on a dog
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking
Where's he form
Barnes comes from Hell
Tennessee someplace
Hill country
Barnes took a bullet right there
At Ia Drang Valley (points to his forehead) And the cocksucker  - that's  man
That's his high, baby
High on
His eyes flare out dramamtically
Chris, enthralled in spite of himself
He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up
Four years he been in the field
and you know how many times he done been shot
(Chris shakes his head) Seven times
(with his fingers) Seven
And he still wanted to come back
Does a pee wee wanna take a wee wee
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways
Yeah, you done said it
Revenge on
Does he have a metal plate in his head
(smiles) You mean he's crazy
No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long
Well he ain't normal that's fosure
That's what he is
Baaaa
His hand flashes forward in front of Chris
'' is written across the left hand knuckles in a sloppy, purplish-black tatoo
Chris looking at it
(') and he's  with it
He's roaming these jungles looking for little yellow devils to kill
Remember the Devil does God's work too
(pause) and this here's Elias
Baaaa
The other knuckle is out - '' tattooed across it
Rhah smiles his crazy smil
Chris stares fascinated at the two knuckles side by side
moment on his face
Love, yeah
(makes a cuckoo sign) Here we go again with the crazy preacher stuff
Rhah seen too many movies
Baaa, got no time to go to the movies
Love and Hate too busy fighting for possession of my soul
Where's Elias come from
(interjecting) 'Lias come naturally
don't know
Done some time
Heard he worked the oil wells in Oklahoma, made some bread and washed up in El Lay
Yeah, get married to some crazy El Lay bitch, an actress or somethin', she blew all his bread - , gurus, all that California shit, and then she turns him into the cops on a drug rap
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either
So he got a reduced and come over here
Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy
Three years he been here
Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes
Well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back
How you gonna talk to civilians man
People back in the world just don't give a shit, y'know what  mean, to them you're a fuckin' animal is all - (to Chris) was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even  there's a war on here
My sister says to me why you have to go there like started this
Baaaa
Fuck it, they sold us out - so what
What'd you'all expect
Civilian life is phoney man
They're  man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies
That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'
Cause it don't really matter
Don't mean shit
So what
Whatcha want - a parade
Fuck that too
No war time no grunt never got no respect
Till he was dead - and even
You're fighting for  man
You're fighting for your , dat's all
Remember dat
And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel
(swings his entrenching tool in a rhythmic chain-gang style) Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change
#2 -  - The stars are out in magnificent splendor
breeze rustling through the trees
#2 - '  - Chris is turning in his sleep, perturbed, writhing
The whispering is more and more urgent
Death is all around
He shoots up out of his poncho liner as if shot, stunned
Scared
Looks around
All is quiet
Men sleeping
Elias is huddled in his poncho on guard next to his foxhole
Chris joins him, sitting, wiping the sleep from his eyes
can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time
don't feel like it either
beautiful night
Yeah
love this place at night
The stars
there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there
That's a nice way of putting it
Elias cuffs a joint, keeping its glow hidden in the dark pause, both of them meditative
(') Barnes got it in for you, don't he
(philosophically) Barnes believes in what he's doing
And you, do you believe
In '65 - yeah
Now
(pause) No
What happened today's just the beginning
We're gonna lose this war
(surprised) You really think so
us
Elias' eyes seem to go to some inner place, his passion surging
we been kicking other people's asses so long guess it's time we got our own kicked
The only decent thing  can see coming out of here are the survivors - hundreds of thousands of guys like you Taylor going back to every little town in the country knowing something about what it's like to take a life and what that can do to a person's soul - twist it like Barnes and Bunny and make 'em sick inside and if you got any brains you gonna fight it the rest of your life cause it's cheap, killing is cheap, the cheapest thing  know and when some drunk like 'Neill starts glorifying it, you're gonna puke all over him and when the politicians start selling you a used war all over again, you and your generation gonna say go fuck yourself 'cause you know, you've seen it, and when you know it, deep down there
He plants his fist in Chris' gut, expelling his breath such is the force of the blow - like a power passed between them
(') you know it till you die
that's why the survivors remember
'Cause the dead don't let em forget
His eyes blazing, reliving the deaths in the village, licking the wounds for the platoon, mourning the failure of its heroism
Chris looking at him, a little awed by his intensity
Elias looks away, embarrassed that he has sermonized, looks back at the stars
(') Oh shit
Sometimes there's things in my head
man
Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian
Do you believe that stuff about
knowing you're gonna die
Yeah, those are the guys that live
really don't think Death gives a shit, it's like a giant garbage can,  think it takes whatever it can get
you never know where it's gonna come from anyway
so why spin your wheels
He shrugs, a certain bravado masking his own uncertainty
You ever think about reincarnation, all that stuff
lightning quick movement follows
Elias' hand passing over his face like a mime, a click of the fingers and he leans closer to Chris
new expression on his face
Devil's eyes, mocking child, danger in his soul, excitement, sex - the Elias that Chris saw in the smoking session in base camp
Chris smiles, sucked in, almost laughs and then the face is gone again
Sure, goes on all the time
Maybe a piece of me's in you now, who knows
But when you die - really die - that's a big return ticket
(soft) like to think 'm gonna come back as
as wind or fire - or a deer (likes the image) yeah, a deer
He smiles at the thought
Chris looks at him, looks away shooting star falls suddenly and dryly through the cosmos
Their eyes
-  -  () The Platoon moves along a shallow  bordering the jungle thick  falls amid cracks of distant thunder
Chris, Rhah, Francis, Big Harold, others are at the rear of the platoon, their ponchos pulled over them like big sad grey tents
There's a holdup ahead and the Men rest on rocks or stand
The rain makes a pointilistic pattern, the men collages of grey, their rifles slung upside down to keep dry
Barnes is up ahead, out of the stream bank, on the radio
-  () Lerner's on point, resting in the shadow of a decaying old French Catholic Church from the 19th Century
The jungle has long ago won the battle, vines creeping into the cracks, remnants of arches layered around the church at the epicenter
Behind Lerner is Sgt
Warren and his radioman
-  () Elias, further back, is checking out the jungle alongside the clearing, noticing a number of old spider holes long since abandoned
He goes over and checks them
-  -  () Back at the stream, Rhah, looking old and whiskered under his poncho hood, lights up a roach, puffs it
Another crack of thunder
Chris comes over, sits with him on his rock
Rhah passes him the joint
He smokes
Big Harold pulls a leech out of his open crotch area
Shit, lookit this little fucker trying to get up ma glory hole
Hey Big Harold, put dat in your turkey loaf it won't come out your back end
(ribbing) Yeah, big boy, thought you had that laundry gig all laid out
(pissed) Shit, got to paint myself white get one of dem jobs
Get ma request in for a circumcision
Gonna be a rabbi man
Gonna cut your pecker down to size hunh Big Harold
Dat's okay wid me, better to have a small one den no one at all
Your girlfriends gonna look for new lovers, man
Best thing a bro's got's his flap
'll drink to your flap in Chicago, King
All gotta do is stretch it out to 15 days and 'll be short 15 and the Beast just wouldn't dare send me back to the bush
You gonna get some for me back in the World, Harold
Whatcha gonna do
(dreaming of it) The world's gonna be ma oyster man
First's  gonna - all the hamburger and french fries and steaks soaked in onions and ketchup  can get
Then 'se gonna  and  Sandy Bell till  sore all over and can't fuck no more, and den 'se gonna  for , for
Den 'se gonna think bout what comes next
The words carry over Chris staring out at the rain, feeling a leaden fatigued high
Passes the roach, down to a millimeter, back to Rhah who points to his face
you got one right there
Chris feels for, finds the leech on the edge of his lip, cursing under his breath
(in the stream, on radio) All right move out
The men start slogging on against the rain
Junior is drinking from the stream, as Fu Sheng passes
Don't drink that asshole
You're gonna get malaria
Shit  hope so
-  -  () On point, Lerner moves out through a remnant of an old arch, somewhat casual in his approach to point
Hey Sarge, you wanna tell me which way or do  get to figger it out
Sgt
Warren, picking up a quick azimuth on his lensatic compass, points
Lerner moves in the new direction
-  () Lerner moves away from the clearing, working up a slight incline when the    erupts out of the jungle, spinning him - throwing him into the dirt like discarded garbage
The men are down, yelling
Ambush
Incoming
Fucking incoming
Suddenly an  rocket breaks out of the bush, sounding like an atom bomb as it devastates the front of the Platoon
Radio Talk is continuous now, back and forth between the three platoon radios, through the ambush
' ,
Lerner's hit
More machine gun fire
Over here - we got
one
two down
Warren's hit
-  -  () Chris moving up with Rhah and the others out of the stream, they hit the ground next to Sgt
'Neill, who looks pretty scared, obviously not about to move
What's going on
' Shit they got 's on our ass
Fucking ambush - they was waiting for us to break trail
Another rocket whistling in
huge roar
Trees shredded, dirt, dust rising
Who's on point
' Lerner and Warren
Chris uses his -16 to lever himself up into a crouch and suddenly dashes forward, passing Rhah
Where you goin' man
Chris tearing up
Past Flash - the hip black head with the colored beads
He's dead, torn and shredded, his face and eyes stuff with dirt
Next to him Doc is frantically tourniqueting Tubbs, shot in the legs
He's screaming
Chris keeps moving to the front as if compelled
- '  -  () Barnes is laying out fire
Goddamit, you assholes get fucking' firepower out there
(to Hoyt on radio) Get Two Bravo up here
Get me a gun
(to others) Spread it out
More to the flanks
Look for a fuckin' target
Another explosion
-   -  () Chris comes alongside Francis near the point, throws himself down
Banging his head against his helmet as he falls
The incoming rounds are tearing up the front of the platoon
(to Francis) Where's Lerner
(terrified) Out there man - behind the log
Looking
body - moaning, sort of moving, wriggling, as if trying to escape the pain
Oh Jesus
His eyes moving to Sgt
Warren lying alongside a tree - calmly trying to stack his intestines back into his ruptured stomach
Another  comes in
Chris makes a conscious decision, moves up - bit by bit, shielding himself with tree stumps, ant hills, laying out fire, trying to get closer to Lerner
Francis following his progress, bug-eyed
Fu Sheng now comes up with his -60 - Harold his loader, belts of ammo flapping against their bodies
He fires from the hip, providing cover fire for Chris, then pops down
-  -  ( ) Chris, firing out another magazine, crawls closer to Lerner, trying to ascertain if he's still alive
Lerner
Lerner, can you hear me man
Lerner groans
fresh burst of  fire rakes the area
Lerner jerks spasmodically with the impact of the rounds
Chris spots the sniper
In a hole in the ground
Twenty-five meters off
Snapping the magazine out of his  to reload live gook
Chris tears off a volley at him but the gook disappears in the hole
This is the moement, Chris realizes it, it's now or never if Chris intends to get the gook
He's got to make a move before the man has reloaded his weapon
He pulls his grenade, pops the pin
He lets the spoon fly off, activating the grenade-timer, as he humps to his feet and runs for the gook hole, concentrating, concentrating
That head is going to pop up any second with a freshly-loaded weapon and tear his head off
Chris won't make it back to the hole
The throw has to be perfect
He won't get another chance
He heaves the frag, drops and rolls away
The throw is perfect, the golden arc of flight from the outfield nailing the baserunner
It twists cleanly in the hole
The explosion muffled but deadly
Chris scrambles to his feet, a look of almost total surprise on his face
He can't seem to believe he did it
Pointing his -16 before him, he advances on the hole, looking over the muzzle to see the badly-mangled  man twisted at the bottom
Chris hurries over to Lerner
He's in bad shape, hit in several places, vaguely conscious
(') Gator
Gator
(Lerner groans) 'm gonna get you out man
You're gonna be okay Gator
okay
Fu Sheng laying out fire to protect them, Harold splitting off to get more ammo
Chris getting Lerner to his feet, hauling him back with all his strength, past Francis
- '  -  () Lt
Wolfe seems disorientated, struggling with the rain water washing off his map, trying to read the coordinates for an arty fire mission
(into the radio) Redleg, Redleg
Ripper Bravo Two Actual
Fire mission

Fire all around, incoming and outgoing, makes them yell to each other
Lootenant, they're kickin our ass, they know we're gonna bring heavy shit on 'em pretty soon so they're gonna get in tight under the arty
spotted a cut running around to the left
Lemme take some men and roll up that flank
(pointing) can work right up on 'em
Wolfe unsure, looks up for the artillery
(to Ace) Get me Barnes
don't know 'Lias, we got four down up there, if  split you off, we
Elias grabs a stick, urgent, starts drawing their position in the dirt for Wolfe
Look, Lootenant
Wolfe looks up, relieved as Barnes splashes into the  group
Thunder peals
(yelling at Wolfe and Ace) Where the fuck is red platoon
Tell 'em to get their asses up here
What the fuck you doin' back here Elias
Round up your assholes and move 'em up front, we're getting chopped to shit
(yelling back) Barnes, listen to me
there's 5-6 spiderholes back there (points) next to the church
(draws it into the ground as he talks) Third Platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us
Flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when Third Platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em
We'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got
It'll be a massacre
Barnes looking at the drawing
Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias
Maybe but  seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces
(back to Barnes) Give me three men, if 'm wrong,  can still roll up that flank
(a look) Take off, but keep your radio here
Elias goes, stops, looks at Barnes
You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes
don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me
Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time
Out here you belong to me
Now move
look
Elias goes fast
More thunder peals
As the 155mm howitzers - sounding like deep tom-toms some three miles distant - beat out their shells
An ominous sound
Closer
Sir
Shot out
Arty's on the way
(hurrying back to the front) Get that asshole 'Neill up here willya
-  '  - Fu Sheng is laying out fire when he senses something, looks up
The artillery shell sounds too close
Getting bigger and bigger on the horizon
Too big, too loud
groan of fear on his face, then knowledge
Then
a huge  engulfs him
- '  -  () Short round
It's short, man
They fuckin' got Fu Sheng
-  () Barnes hearing it, starts forward
Another huge shell starting to whistle in on them
That fuckin' idiot
It explodes
This is about three times the intensity of the
The jungle floor shakes, trees splinter
Barnes is knocked to his knees, rimaces in pain
Hoyt, Barnes' radio operator, screams out as a fist-sized chunk of hot shrapnel sticks in his back
He's screeching, frantically trying to shuck the radio from his back, his fatigue shirt smoking
Barnes jerks the radio off Hoyt's back, knocks the man to his knees and unsheathes his bayonet
Ripping off the back of his shirt, Barnes sets to digging out the shrapnel
'  -  () Morehouse is decimated by a third explosion, chunks of shrapnel whirring like battleaxes into the tree trunks
- '  -  () Big Harold is tearing blindly away from the front, helmet gone, rifle dragging in the mud when he stumbles, sprawling face down
He jumps up, looks back, sees now the wire over which he tripped
It takes a second to register
He shares a look with Bunny who's already on the ground
Satchel charge
Harold goes for the ground the same instant the satchel explodes
-  -  () Chris, further back, dumps Lerner with Doc who's got more than he can handle
Take care of him Doc
Please
Doc looking at him, a dark look of hopelessness
Lerner is a mess, groaning, reaching for Chris' hand
don't
don't leave me man
look between them
Rhah instersecting
Taylor - get your ass over here
Move
Hang tough, Gator
Hang in there, man, you're gonna be
just hang on
Feeling like a liar, peeling the man's hands off him, leaving him there looking numb
Chris is shaken, Lerner's blood all over him
He tears out after Rhah, linking up with Elias and Crawford
Elias motioning them to hurry
Another huge artillery round exploding out to the front
- ''  -  () Sgt
'Neill, scared out of his mind, hugging the earth, tries to crawl into a small cut in the ground but finds it occupied by a cringing Junior
- '  -  () Barnes rushes up out of the forest like Achilles, towering in his rage, at Lieutenant Wolfe, ripping his handset from him as the Lieutenant reads off the coordinates off his map
- What the fuck coordinates you giving
You killed a bunch of people with that fucked up fire mission
You know that
ah shit
Wolfe stares at him, open-mouthed
Disgusted, Barnes hunkers down to read the coordinates from his own map into the handset
(') Redleg Romeo
Ripper Bravo Two
Check your fire, check fire, you're short on our pos
say again, check your fuckin' fire
From Registration point, add one five zero, left five zero, fire for effect
New incoming fire drowns out Barnes
- '  - Elias - a defiant look on his face - moves fast but cautiously back across the Church landmarks
Chris following then Rhah and Crawford
The  has now settled into a mist hugging the ground
Move it
Move it
Elias comes to a stop, looks
Behind them we hear the sounds of battle, gauging their distance from the main body
The spider holes are still empty
But he listens, senses something out there getting closer
(') They're coming
Chris looking at Rhah
How does he know
Elias points out an imaginary line across the breaking mist
(') Stagger yourselves across this line, shoot anything that moves
They'll be coming from here
(team leader) Gotcha
One of them gets through it's curtains
Where you going
Down along the river 'bout 100 metres, 'case they try to flank us there
Third Platoon's coming up on our rear so watch for 'em
'll go with you
No
move faster alone
(a grin) Elias, his pack stripped, is gone, like a fleet leaf, vanishing into the Jungle
(stringing them out) Okay Crawford - over here
Taylor - down twenty yards behind that tree
- '  -  () Barnes has finished correcting the fire mission, hurls the handset back at Wolfe, a wild look in his eyes, studying the incoming fire
Makes a decision
Let's move back, link up with Three
Let the arty do a little work
(to Ace on radio, ignoring Wolfe) Push Two Alpha and Two Charlie
Tell'em to haul ass and re-group at the church
Tell'em  to fire
(Ace transmits) What about Elias
We pull back they'll be cut off
He needs cover fire
(looks at him like he's stupid) 'll get him
(with a threatening undertone) You just haul ass too lootenant
(going, to Ace) don't send Bravo Three up till  get back to the Now move out, all of you
As he snaps his weapon onto full auto and runs off after Elias in a crouch
a man with a mission
-   '  - Next to the Church deployed in the jungle, Rhah looks on, silent
Chris in his position, waits
It is so silent in comparison to the racket from the battle across the forest
The Mist clings to the trees, moist and lovely
Then, a flicker of movement, sound
Chris hears it, tightens
His  - at fifty yards
An evanescence of beige and green uniforms moving towards him very fast, scurrying
They look like headless ghosts
Chris opens fire
Rhah and Crawford open up
rachet of sound, one of the fiures seems to go down, then another but at this distance through jungle it is difficult to say
The firing just as suddenly breaks off and the silence returns
(') (ecstatic) Yeah
got two of them fuckers
got one
See them go down
Like fuckin' target practice man, fuck you Charlie
Ho Chi Minh sucks dead dick
Crawford
(sees him, stunned) Crawford, the blond-locked California beach boy, lies on the earth, hit in a lung, having difficulty breathing, moaning in a soft undercurrent
Chris runs up on him
(') Oh man
man
Attending him
Rhah runs up
Looks like a lung babe
But you're gonna be all right, you only need one of them fuckers
Oh shit man  never thought 'd get hit,  was
(gagging) Stay cool
We gonna carry you out
Barnes appears, running towards them, looking down at Crawford, at Rhah
(') Sarge, 'bout five gooks tried to
Where's Elias
came through right over there
We got three of them, we
Didn't you hear the arty shift
We're pulling back
Get your wounded man and get the fuck back to the church
Get going
(indicating jungle) but 'Lias is still out there
'll get him
You get the man in, Taylor (indicating Crawford) Or 'll Article 15 both your asses
Move
Chris and Rhah look at Barnes sullenly, then reluctantly start moving Crawford onto a poncho liner they use as a litter
(') Move it,
He's in his blackest rage, the force of his words almost physically pushing the men to move out with Crawford
Barnes turns now to deal with Elias
'  - Elsewhere, Elias stands silently, listens to the forest
In the distance the firefight can hardly be heard
His helmet gone, his hair hanging free, he is at his best now - alone
He hears it
Somebody running through the jungle, about 100 yards, boots on leaves, coming towards him
He begins to move lateral to the sound
His steps unheard, better at this than the enemy
now appear, crouched and moving very fast with light equipment through the mist
Elias swerves up in immediate foreground, his back to us,
All three Figures fall
quick glimpse of Elias, not bothering to stop, moving to his next position
'  - Barnes, moving through the jungle, reacts to the fire, resetting his course
Like a hunter stalking a deer
Suddenly there's more firing
Then silence - '  - lie dead in the jungle
rustle of movement, then a  - chilling, jubilant, a war cry
pair of feet moving lightly over the jungle
glimpse of Elias
In his full glory
Roaming the jungle, born to it
'  - Barnes fixing on him, moving
'  - An  , jungle-whiskered, dirty, smart, crouches, listens, looks to his
What are they fighting here
The First One mutter something sharp and they split fast in the direction they've come
They get about six steps when Elias suddenly rises up from the bush, not ten yards in front of them, his shots ripping into them, driving the surprised life from them
Elias is gone
- Elsewhere, another three  stop, turn and flee back from where they came
- Chris and Rhah get Crawford back to the church grounds, lay him down
No activity around them
Chris plunges back into the jungle where they left Barnes
Taylor
'  - Barnes moving, stops, listens
Something is running towards him
But it's hidden by the bush
He brings his rifle up smooth and quick, waits, then as the bush parts, Elias is standing there
Looking at Barnes
Barnes sees him, starts to lower his rifle, but then stops
He raises it back an inch, sights it
Pause
cold searing look of hatred coming over his face
In that moment, Elias understands
Quick as a deer, he makes his move, trying to plunge back into the bush
Barnes fires
Once, twice, three times - the blast rocking the jungle
Elias jerking backwards into the bush, mortally wounded
Bird cries
crime against nature
Barnes calmly lowers his rifle, and walks away from it
'  - Chris, cutting through the jungle, hears the shots
He stops, listens
Someone is moving through bush towards him, leaves and foliage shaking
Chris tightens, raises his rifle
Barnes steps through into his sight - sees him
Chris lowers his rifle
Barnes walking past him as if he weren't even there
Elias is dead
Join up with the platoon
Move it
(shocked) He's dead
Where
You saw him
Yeah
Back about 100 metres
He's dead, now get going, the gooks are all over the fuckin' place
Moving on quickly
Chris has no choice but to follow, looking back one more time
-  - are coming into a  in front of the Church
The two platoons, Second and Third, reinforcing, are being evacuated as quickly as possible, one load (6-8 men, depending on the wounded) after other
The choppers are spraying dust all over the place
scene of chaos, radio talk layering it
Doc is out of supplies, making do with improvised bandages, etc
Lerner goes by, horribly wounded on a makeshift litter, into the chopper, Doc attending, holding the
Chris catching a glimpse of him, waiting to get on the chopper, turning to look as: Hoyt and Sgt
Warren, both wounded, are hurried aboard on litters
The chopper lifting off
Chris and others now running to the corpses of Flash, Morehouse, and Fu Sheng lying under dirty ponchos, their boots sticking out
The ponchos are blown away in a burst of wind off the chopper blades, revealing their faces - dirt stuffing their eyes and mouths, waxen figures
Chris and the others lifting them and carrying them towards the next chopper now coming in
They throw the bodies on
Tubbs and Crawford, both wounded, now move past Chris, into the chopper
Chris running back, with King carrying a litter - their eyes falling on: Barnes talking with Wolfe and Ace, making signals under the roaring sounds of the chopper
Shaking his head
No
No Elias
Chris and King looking at each other, mute
They numbly start loading Big Harold, minus his leg, onto the stretcher
The Third Chopper is down now, waiting, roaring blades silhouetting off the face of the cathedral suddenly goes off not too far from the chopper, incoming fire
The   signaling for them to hurry, laying out fire
/
-  - Chris and King hustling Big Harold's 250 pounds into the chopper
Climbing in with him
Wolfe, Barnes, Ace running in with them
The perimeter is bare
Chris' eyes flitting over Barnes as he jumps in
The chopper lifting off as another explosion rocks the area
The Door Gunner sees something, opens up
Big Harold, cursing, looks chalky but hog happy as he manages a glance down at the jungle
His right leg is gone
Tears are rolling out of his eyes
Man, you gonna be in Japan this time tomorrow, Big Harold
Yeah, 'se lucky dis time, what's a leg to get the fuck outta here
(at the ) Eat ma shit, you motherfuckers
He sinks back, sick
Chris' eyes sudenly fix on something
He can't believe it
He shoves King, points
King sees it
Both stunned
Barnes is looking
So's Lt
Wolfe, so's Ace
So's the Door Gunner
Elias is coming out of the jungle
Staggering, blood disfiguring his face and chest, hanging on with all his dimming strength, looking up at them - trying to reach them
Chris shakes Wolfe, his words drowned out by the roar
The Chopper Captain looking down, dips
His co-pilot pointing
The  are coming out of the jungle, closing on the spot where Elias is
Incoming rounds are hitting the chopper
The Door Gunner maniacally firing
Barnes looking down at the man, can't believe it
Elias is on his last legs now, obviously being hit by the incoming fire of the
He falls to his knees, still stretching upwards for life
The Chopper Captain shakes his head at Wolfe
The Chopper dips one more time firing at the , low and fierce over the jungle
Chris looking back in horror
Elias crucified
The  coming out now by the dozens from the treeline
Elias crumbling to the ground
Obviously dead or dying
we still got one on the deck
Bring the gunships in
Barnes drawing in
Chris looking at him in revulsion
He knows
Barnes sees his look, ignores it, all of them sitting there silent, living with that final horrifying image of Elias
-   - The 'heads' are assembled - what's left of them
Rhah, King, Francis, Doc, Adam, a quiet black kid, and Chris, who is impassioned tonight
He killed him
know he did
saw his eyes when he came back in
(puffing on his bowl) How do you know the dinks didn't get him
You got no proof man
Proof's in the eyes
When you know you know
You were there Rhah -  know what you were thinking say we frag the fucker
Tonight
He looks to King who puffs on a joint, his eyes red
go with dat, an eye for an eye man
Right on, nothing wrong with Barnes another shot in the head wouldn't cure
(to Chris) Shit boy you been out in the sun too long
You try that, he'll stick it right back up your ass with a candle on it
Then what do you suggest big shot
(to Chris) suggest you watch your own asses cause Barnes gonna be down on   '
How you figger that
Shit man - Human nature
Flashes the old knuckle - ''
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had
Right in here
He dugged his own grave
(correcting) He dug it
He  it too
Fuck this shit
You guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head
'Lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a Heaven - and god,  hope so -  know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause
Baaaaaaaaa
(a vehement movement of his head) You're wrong man
Any way you cut it Rhah, Barnes is a murderer
Right on
remember first time you came in here Taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard
was wrong
(snorts) Wrong
You ain't  been right - 'bout nothing
And dig this you assholes and dig it good
Barnes been shot 7 times and he ain't dead, that tell you something
Barnes ain't meant to die
Only thing can get Barnes
is Barnes
Barnes stands there, silhouetted in the trap door, looking down at the men who are stunned to see him here
He steps down into the hutch, his face now lit by candle light
bottle of whiskey in his hand, drunk, ugly, sweating, but as always, with dignity, possessive of his silence
He feels their fear in the silence, enjoys it
(soft) Talking 'bout killing
He totters slightly as he circles the outer edge of the hutch
No one talks
(') 'all experts
'all know about killing
He takes the bowl from Adams, smokes it
(') You pussies gotta smoke this shit so's you can hide from reality
(smokes again) Me  don't need that shit
reality
Confronting Chris, he moves on, taunting them all
(') There's the way it oughta be and there's the way it is
'Lias he was full of shit, 'Lias was a crusader -  got no fight with a man does what he's told but when he don't, the machine breaks down, and when the machine breaks down,  break down
and  ain't gonna allow that
From none of you
Not one
Walks past Rhah, past King, throws the pot bowl into the dirt of the floor
(') 'all loved Elias, want to kick ass, 'se here - all by my lonesome, nobody gonna know
Five you boys 'gainst me
(pause, very soft) Kill me
Almost an appeal - naked, intense
Rhah, Francis, Doc look away
King, the biggest one there, is about to say something, but the moment passes
Chris waits, his anger on the rise
Barnes takes a swigger from the whiskey, then turns away contemptuously
(') on all o' you
Chris slams into Barnes, rushing him off his feet
Pounding his face, solid blows
Get that mother, babe, go
Kick his ass, kill that cocksucker
But Barnes is too quick and very strong and takes the blows, getting outside Chris' arm, twisting and flipping him in a wrestler's grip - throwing him hard onto his back on the dirt floor
The expression of the Men watching slumps, their hopes dashed
Barnes springs around on Chris, straddles him, one hand pushing his face back, hits him hard
Once
Twice
Chris grimaces, groans, helpless now
flick of sound
knife whipped out of Barnes' boot and pressing against Chris' throat
Chris bleeding from the nose and mouth
Rhah suddenly spinning into action, fast now, realizing what Barnes intends to do
,
Barnes is on the verge - about to kill again
Chris waiting
Rhah coaxing him, moving closer
(') You'll do dinky dau in Long Binh Barnes
Ten years - kill an enlisted
Ten years, Barnes, just climb the walls
'
Barnes' eyes tremble in the candle light, his scars ugly, a spasm clenching and locking his facial muscles
Then suddenly he is calm again, very calm
We sense a man of enormous self-control
Suddenly he flicks his knife across Chris, leaving a mark below his left eye
Chris gasps
Looking up at Barnes rising off him
The boots alongside his face
The Men looking on, the tension lowering
(contemptuous) Death
What do you guys know about it
He walks out
Quietly
- ,  - Chris sits at the very edge of a Huey Chopper, bandana around his forehead, long hair blowing in the wind, Barnes' mark below his eyes, slicked out now like a jungle veteran, looking down at the where the massacre occurred
The Village is still a smoking ruin, a few peasants and water buffalo straggling like ants to reconstruct
Bunny, next to Chris, pops his gum, indifferent
Barnes, next to him, shifts, reads a map
Rodriguez is praying, his mouth moving without audible words, getting ready for the drop
King is making last minute adjustments in his pack
Bunny now nudges Chris, points
The Church in the Jungle where Elias was killed is visible
An outline of the Cemetery
Uncomfortable memories play over Chris' face
(
) They sent us back into the valley the next day - about 2,000 metres from Cambodia - into a battalion perimeter
Alpha Company had been hit hard the day before by a sizeable force and Charlie Company had been probed that night
There were other battalions in the valley, we weren't the only ones but we knew we were going to be the bait to lure them out
And somewhere out there was the entire 141st Regiment
The   now breaks in the clear ahead
Smoke grenades of various colors are being popped on the cleared
It's not big, its radius 200 yards, heavily sandbagged, deeply dug, rolls of barbed wire protecting it, radio antennas sprouting from the  - and surrounded on all four sides by jungle
The First Chopper rocking down, whipping up dust clouds
Chris jumps out, moving out fast as the Second Chopper starts in
-  #3 - At the Battalion , the Major confers with Captain Harris and two other Captains
Two   are sitting on their knees, interrogated by Vietnamese Kit Carson scouts and a
Sergeant, their hands tied
The Scout slaps the shit out of the
-  #3 - All this is watched from a distance by Ace and Doc and Lt
Wolfe at the Platoon
Ace and Doc are digging the foxhole, the ace of spades in Ace's helmet band, sharing the information with Tony and Francis
they caught 'em last night pulling some shit on Charlie Company
They found maps on 'em, man - got a friend at Battalion says they had every fuckin' foxhole here fixed on it
Distances, treelines, our claymores, trip wires, everything
shit you not
Shit, so what the fuck are we doing here
Why don't we move
(no answer) Bad vibes, man,  got bad vibes here
Where are the new guys they provided us anyway
heard we's in Cambodia right fuckin'
You kidding man
Rhah comes up, a walking stick in hand, huge pirate kerchief on his head, semi-naked
You wanted to see me sir
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now
Squad
didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir
(with a snicker for Ace and Doc) (indicating a rough drawing in the dirt) These two holes are yours
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them -  got five live bodies left don't want to hear your problems, Jackson
You'll get new men any day
Time being you make do like everybody else
Hey Lieutenant  didn't ask for this job,
(leaves) don't want to hear about it Jackson
(amazed, looking off at him) You don't want to hear about it
(turns) That's right
don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth,  don't give a shit okay just don't give a shit anymore
(shrugs, to himself) Right
(passing Ace digging the  hole) This is one time we could sure use Elias
(to Doc) 'Some people say 'm wishy washy
Maybe  am
Maybe ain't
' #3 - '  - On the edge of the perimeter, King puts out his claymore, unraveling it back towards his , intersecting  form the Third Platoon, who file out on a night ambush, skirting the trip wires, demoralized, silent
Eye exchanges, but no words
Chris sits on the foxhole watching the ambush go out, smoking a joint by himself, depressed
King comes in with the claymore wires, attaching them to their detonators
Their foxhole - as are all of the Platoon's - is positioned just inside the treeline bordering the , so that they are quite isolated from the center of the perimeter where they first landed
Glad  ain't going with 'em
Somewhere out dere man is de Beast and he hungry tonight
Man, what a bummer
Ten days and a wakeup and 'm still dealing wid this shit - fuckin' etcetera and ad infinitum man The   in the file recedes into the foliage
(') (noticiing Chris' silence) What's the matter wid you
How come you ain't writing no more
You was always writing something home
Looks like youse half a bubble off, Taylor
He doesn't answer, makes a futile gesture
(') What about your folks
That grandma you was telling me about
Chris shakes his head
(') Girl
Chris' eyes answer negatively
(') Must be somebody
there's nobody
(shifts, uncomfortable) You been smoking too much shit babe
Gotta control that
Takes a man down
remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a
Who gives a shit
He shifts, annoyed, prepares his grenades along the sand bags
King shrugs, preparing his meal, sings himself a snatch of song, a good natured man
(soft) 'People say 'm the life of the party cause  tell a joke or two although  may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside 'm blue
' 'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it
Way out of anything, man
Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm  turn
How many days you short
Not just me
it's the way the whole thing works
People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it
We just don't add up to dry shit
Does a chicken have lips
Whoever said we did, babe
Make it outta here, it's all gravy, every day of the rest of your life man - gravy
Oh shit, superlifer
'Neill comes up, jerks his thumb at King
' Get your gear together, King, your orders just come through
(speechless) You jokin' me man
shit, you ain't kidding
Cocksucker
Oh wowww
the lifers made a mistake, they cuttin' me some slack, they cutting me some slack Taylor
(dances) ' Collect your shit and move out King
You got 10 minutes make the last chopper
Cee ess em oh or your ass is mine
(to Taylor) Francis is coming over
(hurries off) King packing up, double time
Chris comes over, helps him, trying to share his happiness but not succeeding
Hey that's great King, that's great
you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King
got your address right
You know where you can reach men, man
Anytime

Don't wanna miss that chopper

This new guy Jimi Hendrix man, whew

Just 'member take it easy now, don't think too much, don't be a fool, no such thing as a coward cause it don't mean nuthin
Jes keep on keepin' on
Okay my man
Chris, fighting his depression, slaps hands with King
brief moment, they look at each other
friendship that was forever and is now over
They both sort of know they'll never see each other again
'll walk you out
Francis coming up, hauling his pack
#3 - '  - On another foxhole, Rodriguez positions his -60, brings up his ammo belts (no loaders left)
Tony eating, nervous, watches him, shakes his head
Rumor goin' round is they got tanks
Soviet shit, - 34's
(pause) Hey Rodriguez, don't you ever say nothing
(a thick Mexican accent) What do you want me to say, it's all the same ol' shit
Tony shrugs, back to his food
#3 - '  - On another foxhole, Barnes in full pack checks the soles of Junior's bare feet
Bunny and 'Neill looking on
Junior is moaning as if he's dying, overdoing it by a mile
So what's the problem
' Says he can't walk
Shit
Get your boots on Martin, next time  catch you putting mosquito repellant on your fuckin' feet 'm gonna courtmartial your nigger ass
(cracks) , bust my ass, send me to fucking Long Binh, do your worst but  ain't walking no more
De white man done got his last klik outta me
Get some chuck dude to hump this shit
(suddenly soft) Get me that centipede, 'Neill
'Neill is puzzled
What centipede
' Sarge
Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard  found in the ammo crate
'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk
Junior's eyes bulge with suspiscion and sudden terror, his demeanor totally alert now
' (understanding) Oh yeah, right away Sarge
No
Wait
'll walk, fuck you 'll walk,  don't need this shit
don't need this shit
Fucking pussy, fuck it Sarge,  gotta have him on my hole
Barnes going
'Neill catching up with him
' Uh
Bob
Like to speak to you
Take a minute
(stops) Yeah, what is it
' (shuffles, reluctant) Bob,  got Elias' &
It's coming up in 3 days
Going to Hawaii
See Patsy
(pause, no reaction from Barnes) never asked you for a break,  was hoping you
you'd send me in on the chopper with King
what do you say Chief
(a friendly punch) can't do that for you, Red
We need every swinging dick in the field
Sorry bout that
(starts to go) ' (pleads) Hey Bob, come on
Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, 'm only asking you for three days chief
'm talking to you Red and 'm telling you no
Get back to your position
' (grabs him, desperate) Bob,  gotta bad feeling about this,
'm telling you  got a bad feeling, man,  don't think 'm gonna make it
y'know what  mean
(quietly) everybody gotta die sometime Red
Get back to your foxhole
look in his eyes
Very remote, very cold, silencing 'Neill
Barnes walks off
#3 -   - At the , King runs out, gets on the last   with some other men
It lifts off, swirling dust, the last rays of daylight
Chris watches from a Battalion  area, waves back - the chopper sound receding in the horizon, the comparative silence of the jungle now creeping up on the perimeter
He turns and starts back to his foxhole
man is watching him
He's sitting on a sandbag, face in shadow
It startles Chris, something about him
Something different
deep West Virginia drawl
Got a light
Uh sure
Goes over reluctantly, flicks his lighter, cupping it from the wind
The flame catches a sudden, uneasy expression in Chris' face as he sees the Smoking Man
We come around and see what Chris sees in the light of the flame
face that smiles at him like a death's head, a large ugly blister on his mouth, whiskered, pale - but smiling
sick man wouldn't smile like this, but he is smiling too intimately, as if he knows Chris from way back
But he doesn't
Or does he
Perhaps it was the man Chris first saw at the airstrip when he came in-country
The same expression of evil, of a man who has seen too much and died, but still lives
Chris feels an unnatural fear passing through him
The Man stands, sucking on his cigarette, stretches
He is thin and very tall, towering over Chris
later
He goes
Chris watches him, wondering
The man never looks back, a leisurely, confident stroll
In that moment, there is an from way out in the jungle, about a quarter of a mile
Then another, then small arms fire
Chris looks, knows
#3 - '  - On his foxhole, Junior listening to the distant firing
Bunny is introspective - talking to Junior as if he were his best friend, although they have nothing in common
y'know some of the things we done,  don't feel like we done something wrong but sometimes y'know get this bad feeling
Not all that shit the Chaplain's jamming up our ass 'bout the Good Lord
just a fucking bad feeling, y'know what  mean
Don't know why
told the Chaplain the truth is really like it here
You do what you want, nobody fucks with you
Only worry you got's dying and if dat happens you won't know about it anyway
So what the fuck
(chuckles) Junior looks at him like he's really crazy
Back to the distant firing
(pissed now) Fuck
gotta be on this hole with  man
just know  shouldna come
Bunny finds it funny, laughs
Don't you worry bout a thing Junior, you with Audie Murphy here, my man
#3 -   - At the Company , Captain Harris is talking urgently into the radio
Bravo Three Alpha
Send me a grid
Send me a grid, over
young inexperienced  screams back into the radio amid intense background  filtered by radio and sounding disembodied
We're pinned down sir, they're in the fucking trees
The trees - , Three Alpha, calm down now, son
'm gonna get you a fire mission
Smoke'll be first
(panic) Lieutenant's dead sir, radioman look dead sir, don't know where the map is Captain
They're all around us sir
They're moving
Hundreds of em can hear em talking gook
Jesus Christ
(calming him) Just spot the smoke son and tell me where to shift
We'll get you out of there
Just hang tough and tell me where the rounds hit, over
#3 -   - At the Platoon , Barnes stands, legs akimbo, watching the jungle, anticipating the coming fight as overhead we now hear the 155  whistle from a 10-mile distance - passing above them - then pounding down into the jungle in the near distance
Barnes turns, glances at Wolfe, smiles
#3 -   - At the Company , Captain Harris is back on the radio
Bravo Three Alpha six
How bout those rounds son
Can you adjust fire
(waits) Three Alpha, if you can't talk, just key the handset twice over
(waits) Silence, then a vague  - becoming clearer and clearer
It's in Vietnamese
The radio is then bashed in, the sound like thunder in the Captain's ear
He looks at his , both of them shocked
- / In the Jungle itself, the  is moving
Flurries of movement and sound, blurred visuals
Hands taping a piece of cloth to a tree, moving on - revealing a luminous arrow pointing left
Figures moving past it
Hands unraveling a thin wire waist-high, backwards
Hands sliding along another wire
We now see a moving helmet with a luminous plaque on the back of it, leading a file up the wire
To a Jump-off point about 50 yards outside the
perimeter
Figures crouch
Whispers
Movement
pen flashlight on a drawing of the foxhole positions
The  moving out in several directions at once
#3 - '  - On their foxhole, Chris and Francis wait anxiously
Overhead the keeps pounding into the ambush area
Now can be heard picking up at random spots along the perimeter
The battle, like a tide, is obviously moving closer to them
Oh shit me  wish  was back in Memphis now, oooh baby this is gonna be a motherfucker
Chris says nothing
Suddenly off to their right, about 80 yards, a   of light erupts
Trip flares
Rodriguez's hole
Rat-tat-tat-tat, rat-tat-tat
Machine gun, outgoing, followed by a sharp explosion
(') RPGs
Shit
(crying) thrashes up through the foliage behind them
(a fierce whisper) Taylor
Francis
Over here
Rhah jumps into their hole with them, out of breath
(') Rhah
What's going on
Rodriguez's hole just got (gets his breath) Okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter
Oh shit
Dat's it, dat's it
They got through Alpha Company
Anything behind you don't identify itself, blow it away
Two - air strike's coming in
They gonna lay snake and nape right on the perimeter so stay tight in your holes and don't leave 'em
now shoot up over the perimeter
Reds, greens, yellows, squeaking as they float doen on their parachute hinges throughout the ensuing battle
The perimeter is illuminated at spotty intervals - sometimes arctic bright, sometimes inexplainably dark til new flares shoot up
Chris, Francis, Rhah all look up at the light, and hug their holes even tighter, feeling naked in the light
Flares cut both ways
(') they're probing us, they gonna go up and down this line all night trying to get through
Stay cool 'll be back
Runs out of the foxhole
Chris suddenly reacting to a noise out front, gripping Francis and pointing to the sound
is thrashing towards them, about twenty-five yards, not yet visible but a little awkward and lungy in it's movement, as if desperate
Francis, tense, is about to pop his grenade when Chris grabs him
Hold it
(loud whisper) But the body keeps coming, lurching now, falling
Come on man
No
- then a fizzle of   as the Figure hits their trip flare - revealing itself to be large, with no helmet, and gasping, terrified of the trip flare
'
'
It's the ambush
(calling out) In here, man
Hurry
The  now runs in like a fullback going down for the tackle, sprawling into the hole, knocking Chris and Francis down beneath him
He is sweating, terrified, a white boy with an unrecognizable, filthy face, no rifle, no helmet, his fatigues torn all over
Water
Water
Chris gives him his canteen, his shoulder and neck hurting from the collision
The Soldier sucks down the canteen
(') (between gulps) They'se all over the place, hundreds of em moving this way
They wiped us out man, we didn't have a chance
Where's the
(points) Back there
The Soldier struggling out of the foxhole
You guys get outta here
They're right on my ass and they ain't stoppin' for shit
He tears off, leaving Francis in a state of incipient panic
He looks at Chris
Taylor, let's di-di man
Chris adjusting position, facing the front, anger in his voice
You go
Francis hesitates, stays
#3 -   - At the Battalion , the Major is inside his , busy between his radio nets
(to  1) Get me Bravo
2 Charlie Company reports hand to hand on the perimeter sir
Three holes are down
They need help
(looks at his watch, to his ) Okay move two squads from Alpha down there
Where's that goddamn air strike, you bet your ass if we were the First Cav they'd be here now
1 (handing him the transmitter) Bravo Six sir
#3 -   - Just outside the Bunker, a   spots something in the flarelight
with helmets running towards him at an angle
Hey you boys
Which Company you
sudden burst of  cuts the Sergeant down in his tracks and the Figures fly by
Soldiers in the immediate area spot them
#3 #4 burst of fire
One of the   goes down
An Explosion engulfs him
#3 -   - But the   runs right into the bunker in a kamikaze charge, the light from inside momentarily revealing a bulky satchel strapped on his person and the face of the astounded Major
3 #3   - The Bunker  with a deafening roar
#3 - '  - In their foxhole, Chris and Francis look at the curling ball of flame, stunned
Oh no
#3   - In their foxhole, Chris points
There
moving in the trees
Chris blows his claymore handles
One explosion on top of the other out front
Then return fire
Flashes from a muzzle, rak-a-tak, rak-a-tak, rak-a-tak, the heavier sound of an -47
Chris opening up with his 16
Then being blown down by a grenade explosion at the edge of the foxhole
Then nothing
pause
Chris' ears ringing, slightly concussed
Suddenly from down the perimeter there is the sound of a faulty crackling out from the jungle
pidgen English, the words mauled, then a snatch of patriotic North Vietnamese music, played from a scratchy old record
Chris uneasy, looking at Francis who looks terrified
The now of a whistle
Two hoots, then a sharp third
Then yelling
Chris grabbing Francis' arm, pointing
There is a  directly out to the front of them - muttering something in Vietnamese, no more than 20 yards away but unseen
It's like hearing a casual conversation from another room, then the sounds of several bodies moving in separate directions - encompassing the foxhole
(') (to Francis, a whisper) Out of the hole
Fast
Chris crawls out, stops, looks back
Francis won't leave, hugs the shelter
(') (a fierce whisper) Goddamit Francis
Move your fucking ass
Now
Reaches in and yanks him with all his strength half out of the hole
Francis, finally sparked, now moves out
Both of them bellying it into the brush behind the hole
Not a moment too soon
An   whistling in
The  takes a direct hit, caving in, whirls of smoke spinning off it
Chris and Francis look back covered with debris
They hear movement
are swarming towards the foxhole, firing into it to finish them off
Francis grabs Chris' leg, indicating they get out of there
Chris hesitates - a moment, a decision made now in angry passion - rises up and charges the
scatter and tumble, caught by his surprise close-range fire
Chris moving forward into them, blasting, agile, his instincts finely tuned, and totally insane in this moment of time, indifferent to his life
He  insanities, pumping himself up with the adrenaline of courage
(') Screams from the dark shadows, they fall
Chris smashing a wounded  with the butt of his gun down into the foxhole
He jumps back into it, reoccupying it
Blasting the dead gook
Opening fire out to the front, driving the Shadows back
Francis watching this, amazed
After a moment of doubt, he too tears back out to join Chris in the foxhole, unbelieving, as he jumps in with him
(joining in the frenzy) Then stunned again to see Chris suddenly rise up out of the foxhole and charging forward into the jungle
He is now over the edge
(charging off into the jungle) #3 - '  - In his position, Bunny is experiencing the same 'high' as Chris, yells out at them
Come on ,
Junior, huddled in the hole with him, speechless and terrified, looks at him with huge eyes
The guy is nuts
An incoming grenade explosion shakes the hole
(') (laying out more fire) Come on you can do better than that
Fuck this shit
ain't dyin' in no white man's war
Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah
Junior freaks out, throws his rifle down and hobbles out of the hole on his damaged feet at an incredible speed
(yelling after him) Get back here you gutless shit
suddenly out of nowhere, looms up fast behind Bunny, running at him
Junior, insane now with fear, runs smack into a tree, knocked senseless and reeling to the ground
Bunny turning back too late
The crazy drug-high Shape is yelling something like: Diiiiikaaeeeeeee
And jumps right into the hole blasting Bunny point-blank in the chest
Bunny struggling to consciousness at the bottom of the hole
boot in the gaping hole where his chest was
Bunny, his eyes uncomprehending
muzzle is jammed into his mouth, breaking his teeth with an ugly sound
Another yell from the trooper
flash of orange red light
Bunny's face blown to bits
Junior, dizzy from the blow to his head, looks up
yellow flare somewhere out there and a  above him digging a bayonet into his belly with a grunt
long oozing sigh of belly gas
An explosion
The Shadow with the bayonet staggering blind without eyes, holding his brains with his hands
Barnes throws open the empty  rocket casing he has just fired off and charges forward with a yell, cutting down another  in Bunny's old foxhole
Jumping into the hole, the bottom of which is a liquid pit of guts, blood, ooze
Another Enemy running in on him
short burst of fire
Barnes hit
Firing into each other
Barnes draggin him down into the pit with him, grappling alongside the corpse of Bunny
Barnes uses an entrenching tool to finish him off
#3 -   - At the Platoon , small arms fire is all over the place, the closing the ring
Ace, in the foxhole, yells to Wolfe
Negative contact
Can't raise Barnes, Two Bravo, Two Charlie, nothin'
Get me Six
Nervously aiming his rifle as a man comes running towards them, staggering
It's Doc
Doc plops down, out of breath, drained, bleeding all over his chest
They're coming through all over
can't
can't do
Where's Barnes
think he's dead
it's awful, they're all dying
Wolfe is stunned, Barnes his last crutch against the chaos
Ace handing him the handset
Six
' Yeah
Send traffic or clear this goddamn net
We've been overrun Captain, we're pulling back
Over
#3 -   - At the Company , things are just as bad
Radioman is sprawled over a smashed radio
Captain Harris is in a bunker working the radios himself, as his Radiomen fire at yelling, running  scurrying all over the inner perimeter
(furious voice) Bravo Two, Six
Goddamit where the hell you plannin' to pull back to
They're all over the perimeter
Be advised Lieutenant, you  hold in place and you will  and that means , Lieutenant
Out
#3 -   - At the Platoon , Wolfe is astounded by the message
Ace looking at him straight in the eye
You're an asshole Lieutenant, you know that
As he abandons his radio, grabs up his 16 and moves to an adjacent position
Doc, a quiet man up to now, is treating a wounded Parker who is now hit by bullets and thrashes wildly and jerks to a stop
He is obviously dead but Doc goes on trying to finish the bandage
Suddenly he goes beserk, grabs a 16, starts firing and yelling
#3 -   - At the Company , Harris gets on the radio with the air strike
One of the RTOs on a separate radio calls over
#5 Captain, Third Battalion Armoured's on its way with tracks 'bout 2 kliks west
(ignores it, into radio) Snakebite leader, Ripper Bravo Six, we're gonna need you soonest be advised 've got zips in the wire down here, over
' (distorted high frequency) Roger your last Bravo Six, Snakebite lead we can't run it any closer
We're hot to trot and packing snape and nape but we're bingo fuel
It's your call, Six actual, Over
Harris looks around
The decision made
Snakebite leader, Bravo Six, for the record, it's my call
Dump everything you got left
say again,  want all you're holding  the perimeter
It's a lovely war
Bravo Six Actual and Out
Pilot's reaction
Very calm
Farmboy twang
' Roger your last Bravo Six
We copy it's your call
Get em in their holes down there
Hang tough, Bravo Six we are coming cocked for treetops
Whiskey to Echo
Snakebite Two, this is lead
Last pass on zero niner
Watch my smoke to target, expend all remaining
Follow my trace
The transmission drops out
Harris now looking up into the darkened skies
The planes in no way evident - but they're there
And they're coming
#3 -   - At the Platoon , the  are sweeping fast, crouched, using cover, yelling
Small fires are raging all over the perimeter
Ace putting out fire, is hit
The  are coming over his sandbags
burst of fire
Ace goes down
Doc has cracked up, firing at anything, indifferent to his safety
One of the  goes down
The Doc is hit in the side, wounded, struggles, is hit again, but keeps trying to fire
He's hit a third time - in the jugular vein
Nearby, Wolfe is firing madly at the oncoming
One goes down
second is wounded, yelling in pain
Wolfe reloading his 16, popping up, too late
One of them is coming over the sandbags
He sees Wolfe
Wolfe sees him
In the same moment
Wolfe hesitates, frozen up
The gook unloads his -47, a magazine worth, into Lieutenant Wolfe, who crashes down, sprawled unnaturally on the jungle floor
spasm shakes his body
Then stops
Dead
Boots run by
#3 - ''  - At his foxhole, 'Neill peeks up out of the hole
Several are darting through the jungle 20 yards away, coming towards him, talking loudly to each other
He quickly slips back down in the hole, entwining himself with the approaching , clinking metal
The  stop, glance in the hole
Something is muttered
They run out
'Neill opens his eyes, breathes
#3 - '  - swings his mashed -16 full into the  of an enemy who screams and goes down, Barnes chopping at him with his club
His helmet is gone, his shirt ripped to shreds, his shoulder bleeding, making his last stand against the hated Gooks
Nearby  is hit in the shoulder by a running  and collapses into the bottom of the foxhole, crying out in pain
The running  runs past right into the full force of ' swinging rifle
He crumples
Chris bellies into the area, see Barnes, recognizes him, amazed
An  fires, taking Barnes high in the left thigh
patch of skin blowing off
Barnes rigidly goes down on his left knee like a wounded horse
Holds there, staring into the Enemy, waiting for the coup de grace
series of  and the Enemy staggers dead as: Chris lays out a curtain of fire
goes off near him, blowing off his helmet
Dazed, Chris rushes forward firing from the hip - sucked into Barnes' suicidal vacuum
He cuts down an Enemy as: Barnes, given a new lease, limps angrily forward and tackles a wounded Enemy trying to crawl away, terrified at the sight of Barnes coming after him
Barnes lets out a vivid scream
And beats the soldier mercilessly, half the stock of his -16 flying apart broken
Chris swivels alert on his knees
pause
No more enemy
Turns to Barnes, his back to Chris still beating at the dead corpse
Barnes
Barnes swivels instinctively off the corpse and for a petrifying moment Chris sees: maddened scar of a face, lips specked with foam
The  - refracted in a red-green flare overhead - the pupils distorted into angry red points
For Chris it is no doubt the most frightening single image he has seen in his life
It will be in his nightmares forever
The essence of evil: wrath, obsession, anger, fear, hatred, permanence - he is paralyzed
Barnes smashes him full across the face with the broken stock of his -16
Not even conciously, for at this point, his mind has gone over the edge and the entire world is his enemy
American or Vietnamese, it makes no difference as he strikes Chris harder and harder
Chris struggles, moans, his teeth and nose cracked
Barnes emits another chilling yell an springs like a humpback up on his good right leg, the left bent - set to deliver the killing blow, the mangled rifle pulled to its highest arc
(') Nooooooooo
The    comes now like a great white whale
One big beautiful monstrous beat of deafening sound
Its silver and white belly hurtling low over the treeline in one giant leap of sound momentarily illuminated by a flare
Then a monstrous of anger
The bomb ripping Barnes off the body of Chris and spitting Chris across the jungle floor - crashing into a tree some 30 yards away
#3 - '  - Vague sunlight
Blurry
Chris fluttering his eyes
sharp  in the bush
His eyes fight their way open
are watching him from behind foliage
soft, furry head, alert, rigidly still
Chris fights his way up to his elbow, in pain, looking at the eyes
The head turns and in one fluid move, bolts
Gone
Like the wind
deer
big brown deer
Or was it
Chris will never be quite sure
But whatever it was, it was surely a sign of grace - the grace of Elias
This he knows as he feels himself for the first time alive
And in pain
His left hand torn and bleeding, shrapnel in his side, cuts on his face, dried blood caking him
Looking around his garden of eden
messy jungle floor
Cordite fumes
Burned bush and trees
Torn sandbags
Dead
Bird songs somewhere in the distance
It is the very crack of dawn, a pink- red sun casting long oblique light patterns through the trees holy light
Chris pushes himself to his feet, feels his weight and the pain
He walks
In the near distance, towards the  area, there's the sound of Armored Personnel carriers grinding, men moving, calling out in Americanese
But Chris is alone here
He fishes up an -47 from a dead
Checks it, a weapon
Walks on
#3 - '  - Past scores of  bodies
Past the Foxhole where Bunny lays dead in the bottom, faceless
Looking over at Junior bayoneted to the ground, dead
everywhere around the hole, some of them still moving, badly wounded
Chris looking around, then noticing a movement a little further out in the Jungle
Then he sees who
The uniform is shredded, the figure obviously hurt in several places (thigh, back, neck, hand) but not mortally so, now struggling to right itself, dragging its face up from a belly- down position
Streaked with dirt and blood, we see Barnes once again re-emerging from the dead
Chris steps over to him, a solemn look on his face
Barnes looks up, begs
Get me a Medic will ya
Go on
Chris doesn't move
Barnes looks at him again, reading the intention that has crossed Chris' mind
An expression of surprise crosses his face, then amazement, almost shock
(') Fuck you in hell
Chris shoots him
Once
Twice
Three times
Silence
Barnes is finally dead
Chris looking at the corpse, numbed, no exultation in his expression
Just cold satisfaction and little feeling left
Behind him, the  of a big machine moving
He turns
huge Nazi flag on an antenna looms up in the bush, followed by the great belly of a turreted dragon crunching down a tree for its breakfast
big tough   comes boudning at him sniffs, followed by a flak-jacketed   - filthy and greasy, unshaven face, earring in his left ear, ' ' scrawled on his shirtless flak jacket and a drawing of a death's head, he looks like a cross between a pirate and a hell's angel
Behind him, a and the    grinding its engine, a human skull hanging from its turret
(to Dog) Bozo
Get back here
His eyes passing on Chris like so much meat
(') (to Chris) Can you walk outta here
Chris nods
The Soldier pointing to the  behind him as a sign he should go that way
The other Soldier already stripping the dead, as the  grinds on into the jungle, reconnoitering
Chris walks out of the jungle, head bowed, nauseated, mixed feelings roiling him
#3 - '  - In another foxhole, Francis waits, the sounds of the approaching cutting through
He thinks about it a moment
It must be fast
It must be a hard cold decision
Now
He pulls out his -bar and with one last anguished hesitation, drives it into his thigh muscle
Francis yells out and collapses in his hole
#3 - ''  - In another foxhole, 'Neill, unscratched but covered with dirt, waits tentatively as  arrive at his hole
They're a little awed by the sight of the tough-looking 'Neill emerging from his foxhole like Sgt
Rock, dozens of dead  littered around him
#1 You alone Sarge
' Fuck yeah
They all left me, bunch of fuckin' faggots
#2 Man, you gonna get yoself a silver star
' Fuck the silver star
You got any booze
#3 - '  - Rhah, alive and well, is poking around the  corpses with a long gnarled walking stick, looking like a crazy Johnny Appleseed with his pants rolled up on his thin hairy ankles and wearing a red bandana tied in a four-knot around his head
As one of the   carves an ear off a dead , Rhah works his way through the torn bloody pocket of an  Troop in full rigor mortis, extracting what he thought was there - a wrapped cellophane of heroin
Rhah's face glows with satisfaction as he tastes it, then snorts it
With a certain satisfaction of triumph over the grim circumstances
(to the powder) Yeah, that's good shit
#3 -  - is hauled out on a litter
Morphined, his eyes watching it all from somewhere deep in his brain
Passing: Groups of  looking like bowery bums and moving like rats through the smoke and garbage snooping for souvenirs with wheezy tired eyes and grunts of greed
Passing a bulldozed  with heaps of   in them
a pushing another set of bodies in, like photos of a Nazi death camp
Nearby, two burly  lift a   and with a once- through build for momentum, toss the fresh body into the pit
Chris, numb, goes by
(into radio, exhausted) - 37
, 122 wounded and still counting
Estimate 500 Victor Charlie , 22 wounded and still counting
Over
2ND Sir, a television crew's coming in with the General - doesn't respond; at this point he doesn't give a shit, standing apart from the radios looking numbly at the remnants of his boys filtering by on litters
Chris intersects him now, Harris' eyes looking blankly, then nodding sickly trying to give him encouragement
Just coming to the edge of tears, choking it back, and turning back
These are his sons who are lost
good officer
Rodriguez, wounded, is lifted up in his litter and moved out to the waiting  , a huge red cross painted on a white square
Doc goes by on another litter, then Ace, Adams, Huffmeister, etc
Then Francis is littered by, bandages around his leg, a big smile on his face
Hey Taylor, you okay man
Yeah
How 'bout you
Jes' fine man, jes fine
Ain't never felt better
Both of us two timers man, we're out
(gives him a slap as he goes by) See you at the hospital man, we gonna get high-high yessir
(goes off) The Medic points to the chopper
(to Chris) That's your ride man, you ready
(tries a smile) You bet
Chris starts towards it, the Medic assisting him
#3 -  - Sgt
'Neill watches the loading process forlornly from the distance
Captain Harris intersects him
You got Second Platoon Sergeant
' (reflexively) Yes sir - And as Harris moves away, 'Neill is left thinking
Finally there is a certain frustration to his actions; he has taken such great pains to stay alive that the tuition he pays is precisely to stay in this Jungle
Inevitably his time will come - one way or another
His eyes now follow the   upwards, whatever is left of his shrunken soul yearning to go with it
/:  #3   - As the Chopper rises off the battlefield, Chris, who is sitting at the edge so that he has a full view out the open door, waves back at Rhah
#3 - Rhah, at the edge of the treeline, vigorously shakes his walking stick at him, his other hand a fist, waving them, emitting his cry
Baaaaaaaaa
Defiance
Pride
Dig me, 'm Rhah - and there isn't nobody like me in the world
/:  #3 -   - The chopper - with its huge red cross painted on - now rising to meet God
Smashed on morphine, Chris looking out at the waving ants below
Now the trees, the skyline and the chopper is moving fast over the devestation
The jungle forever locked in his memory, Chris looks back, copious, quiet tears flowing from his eyes
(
) think now, looking back, we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves - and the enemy was in us The war is over for me now, but it will always be there - the rest of my days
As  am sure Elias will be - fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called possession of my soul
There are times since have felt like the child born of those two fathers but be that as it may, those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning to this life The music surges now to its full strength as we replay bits of film with each actor's name listed - some with silly, clowning looks, others sober, haunted
Gardner, Tex, King, Rhah, Lerner, Sanderson, Manny, Big Harold - all the boys
and then Barnes staring quietly into the camera, and lastly Elias - shirt off, bowl of grass in hand, his big, beautiful smile
