Moving toward it, the shimmer becomes 2
-    - glowing but not transparent structure stretching off into the clouds  that press it
continues to move in until the detailed structural  webbing of the dome fills the  and then and  we see 3
-   - Shining below the dome (which we now see as a series of dome-like structures standing off without end) -a marvelous crystalline city of  great openness, building clusters, green plazas, fountains

6		 -   - From a busy courtyard below we watch the elevator slide down from a great  height
As it reaches the courtyard the  darts out, pushes into  the crowd
7 8 As he reappears around a corner, skirts a brimming pool and makes for a  kind of broad corridor which seems to lead out of the courtyard
He is  moving even faster now, glancing back as if he fears pursuit
9		  - Above, at the railing of an oval light well, dressed in black and silver,   a figure holding an odd looking weapon lazily in one hand -- and watching
It is
10 Moving rapidly down the corridor, he suddenly stops as if feeling the  presence above
He looks up, sees the  and his face breaks in  terror
He wheels, frantic, screaming, runs back into the hall
11		  () Vaulting the rail, dropping lightly to ground level, weapon poised

The crowd melting, parting to reveal the Runner backed against the pool
People are , shaking their fists, terribly excited and fearful

Aims
Fires
14		  - Seeming to burst aflame in the , then slipping   to reveal  Francis sauntering forward, holstering his weapon
The crowd closing in  behind him, applauding, congratulating him
15 Arriving at the pool where the body lies, half immersed
He leans over,  lifts the right hand from the water, revealing a palm with a black  flowercrystal shape in it
He lets the hand fall back now as the crowd    and  him
16		   -  -    - () Closing in until the crystal fills the

to reveal 18
- The crystal is in the hand of a sleeping  who is behind glass in  one of many cubicles
Standing outside, looking in, , dimly lit in   the soft glow of the cubicle where the sleeping infant lies, swaddled and  coccooned in the rosy auto-tender which caters to the baby's every need
Faint  bubbles like distant laughter
19 19X1 Logan is twenty-five, strong, virile (yet sensitive) with a kind of austere grace
He is somewhat manic
proud
as he peers through the nursery window  into a kind of foam cocoon which cradles Logan is   on the soundless glass
Wake up
come on, Logan-6
19X2 entering
(shaking his head in  mild, mocking disbelief) You are here
couldn't believe it when they told me
What are you doing
(still knocking on the soundless glass) Turn this way
(as one of the infants stirs, smiles, bubbles) No,  no
not you
Francis tries to pull Logan away from the  window, but Logan is intent on waking one of  the infants
You should've seen me take my last Runner
perfect
(Logan  continues to pound the soundless glass) backed him  up against a residence pool and  when he terminated
his hand
(breaks off as Logan is paying  no attention) So now you've seen him
what's the difference awake or asleep
(to infant) Open your eyes once, idiot
(to Francis) It's not every  day that a Sandman son is  born
'm telling you, Francis  - that's him
Maybe,  maybe not
What's the difference
Come on,  Logan, let's get out of  here before everybody  finds out
But Logan isn't moving
Francis gets an  idea
Okay
you really want to wake him up
Francis starts to pry at the Panel
knowing it  will sound an Hey, cut that out
Too late: There is a
The area in which they stand  is bathed in a violet glow
Logan grabs Francis firmly and stops him from  prying at the panel: Now you've done it
The
but the glow continues, a metallic  is heard: Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify
Logan-5
Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant
Intrusion accidental
Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7
The violet light goes off
(with affection: to Logan) Had enough
(looking at the infant) Even the alarm didn't wake him
As Francis starts out: (one last look; joining Francis) All right, Francis
'm with you
They move off down the corridor
the lights behind them  as they  pass cubicles suffused with soft pink light, automatically  tended
soft
lullaby and a soothing impersonal
Sleep time
go to sleep
Sleeping time, little ones
As they exit Nursery
Logan stops and takes one final look backward
You need a lift
Let's go to Arcade and celebrate
(teasing tone) your alert successor
Logan-6
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are
(putting a card key into a door which opens soundlessly) Not in my time
They move through the door which closes
20
-   - They are now on a kind of enclosed platform with widely spaced doorways,  each glowing faintly
They pause, waiting
(peering at Logan curiously) Why
just wondered
what happens
(shrugs) Dunno
flameout maybe
Whatever happens, you can bet it's final
But who would want to find out
One of the doorways brightens and the word  _ appears on it
The  two men move to the spot as a maze-car stops
They enter it through the  doorway which dims behind them as the maze-car softly off into a  kind of twilight
21
- - - The door slides shut
They sink into seat forms which yield to them
They   move off
22
- - Moving through the city at terrific speed
Giving us glimpses of the city  as it goes
slowing finally as we see: 23		  - Brightly lit, garish
We get only a glimpse as the maze-car disappears  into a tunnel
24		-  - As the maze-car stops, opens and Logan and Francis exit into   a gathering
25		  - Glittering, crowded
Throngs of people moving on many levels, some walking, some on moving platforms
It's The Great White Way, Luna Park --  you name it
Gaudy booths and entrances, featuring every delight -- too  much to take in at a glance
26 As they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when it notices them, across halls and up moving platforms, the good-natured argument continuing
but you don't know, you Just say what everyone says
One for one
One for one
" Well, why no
That's exactly how everything works
How else could the city stay in balance -You have a better idea
(laughs) No, but at least  wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours
You sound like a sleepteacher With a stuck tape
Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering
(beat) You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot
Too much for a Sandman They are passing the facade of a Relive Shop The signs urging people to:
As they cross the entrance, two men come out, grinning broadly, falling  into step just ahead of Logan and Francis
Then one of the men stops  abruptly, almost colliding with them
He mumbles an apology and starts  back to
As he disappears into the  , his friend shrugs cheerfully to  Logan and Francis and moves on
27		 -   - They are moving past a shop called   #483 when a man comes cannonading out, thrilled and excited
He rushes over to a pretty young  woman who has been eying Logan and Francis, plants himself in front of  her with his hands framing his face
Well
How do you like it
(critically) don't know
The cheeks maybe
look a little - Cheeks
Cheeks
Right
Too much, you think
Too little
Too little
(gestures) Too little
Okay, wait for me
And he darts back into   #483
The woman shrugs, glances around,  smiles and goes off with a passer-by
28		 -   - Signs promising , ,
People streaming in and  out
woman comes out looking glazed, breathing "yes
yes
" As she  passes  Logan and Francis emerge from the crowd and  moves  with them
Did you ever see Francis-8
(shaking his head) never even visited Nursery before tonight
(beat) When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know
They are now passing the facade of  where the signs promise:   ,  ,
here the people going in are simply  excited but the ones coming out are clearly stoned out of their minds
don't know what makes you so curious
You have any idea who his seed-mother was
(quickly) Of course not
m curious, not sick
(laughs) The crowd is growing denser, funneling into a kind of passageway
Logan  and Francis are swallowed up in the group
29		  - An immense room into which the streams of people coming from the entertainment area are mingling
There is a general air of anticipation  stirring the crowd as  singles out Logan and Francis entering,  waving to friends
closes in on them just as they reach a  beautiful woman who is obviously pleased to see Francis
They embrace,  and as they break: and that's my friend, Logan
(as she acknowledges the introduction) We're celebrating his next in line
Carousel - Arcade - who knows
Want to come along
(smiles, shakes her head) Only if  make it to the top of Carousel
(she holds up her hand) Thirty -- and the big spin
In her palm the crystal blinks, red, black
Francis nods, gives her a  half-squeeze
You're thirty -- already
always thought  was older than you - (beat) Well, give it a good try
(pleasantly) You know  always have
Another beautiful  joins them
2ND  (to the first) Sorry  won't be at Carousel tonight
It1s  my Love-Shop turn
That's all right
Happy turn
2ND You'll renew
've got a feeling
(smiles) So do
but if  don't at least 'll have the ultimate thrill
'd almost rather have that than renew
2ND feel the same way
Sometimes  think 'm not even going to try and renew when my time comes
But -- that's three years away
So long
The 2nd Woman walks away
(after a beat; to first Woman) It's been nice
Um-huh
They look briefly and then she turns away
Francis takes Logan's arm and  they move off
guess you never had her
Logan shakes his head
You missed something special
Well
you can't have them all
(together, it's an old joke) But you can try
They laugh, but the laughter is broken as a trio of youngsters, moving  with erratic speed of lightning, smashes between them, almost knocking  Francis over
He reels, Logan catches him and they recover in time to see   the trio rip wildly through the crowd, knocking people down, screaming  with shrill joy as they disappear
The damned Yellows are getting out of hand
Those three ought to be in Cathedral
No business scrambling in Arcade
(laughs cuffs Francis' arm) What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis
Weren't you ever a Yellow
bet you were even wilder than - (he breaks off as the lights in the Great Hall dim) -- come on, Sandman
The two of them start to move to the far end of the Great Hall
30		  - As everyone begins to move to the far end, where great  curtains have parted to reveal 31		   - the far end of the hall, where the throng is a huge crystal design ornaments an entrance  The crystal is red and pulsing rhythmically to the accompaniment of a deep and thrilling
As we move toward it with Logan and Francis, the   deepens, the great pulse takes on a hypnotic quality
32 In the crowd they overtake a fellow Sandman,  , and fall in step with him
When they  speak now, their voices are hushed
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel
'm positive   recognized him - (hustling Logan) Come on
don't want to miss the filing-in
There'll be some  know tonight,  think
(glances at his own red crystal, nods) Yes
Me, too
You know we're both on Monitor tonight
Damn
That's right
Just when feel like an    in Arcade
Want me to take your shift
'm feeling restless anyway Francis glances at him, exchanges a look with Daniel
They vanish into the throng passing under the great crystal, turn the corner and we see 33		  - framed in a huge corridor we see a steep-sided  arena dropping down to a shadowy center, which  even now pulsates and flickers in changing  dimensions, but always maintaining the jewel- flower shape
There is one entrance into the center -- a kind of ramp from below the seats, leading directly into the mysterious bowl -- Just now the seat's are filling, and the sense of expectation builds People sit and immediately crane their necks, waiting
34 Featuring Logan and Francis as they find places in the arena
Like the others, they crane upward
As they do, Logan gestures at a number of pretty girls who are just being seated
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother
Only a few
You're just not trying
35-36 37 As the seats fill, the excitement builds
Suddenly the lights begin to dim and dim
:  kind of collective sigh, breathing in unison
38 38X1 Suddenly visible, the
Their arms are upraised and in each palm the crystal blinks red-black, red-black
39 Transfixed, gripped with a religious fervor
40 Hands still raised, filing slowly into the mysterious well of Carousel
41 Tense, beginning nervous  here and there
42 As the last one enters, beginning to glow and, as it does, the bowl slowly puts out leaves like some great plant, enfolding and hiding the people within a series of translucent petals
As the Last one enfolds them the Light intensifies, the exterior surfaces seeming to shift as if a kind of motion was beginning inside it
43 Visible in the growing Light from Carousel -gripped with passion and excitement, , gesturing as they see 44 Moving, bands of light seeming to spiral upward Like a contained aurora as the Carousel picks up speed
45 Caught up in it Like the rest
46 Beginning to blur with its own speed
Through the shifting, spiraling curtain of light we see bodies moving in a kind of weightlessness, always struggling to move higher
Follow a shadowy form as it moves, twists through other writhing shadows -- upward, upward
Suddenly the form is spread-eagled, and in a moment it is sharply outlined against the swirling canopy and then -- a searing flash
And it is gone
: Crowd in a frenzy --
47		  -    - Standing
their cheers as: 48		  - High, reaching downward out of the shadows beneath the dome, fringing, intersecting rainbow bands appear, looping the swirling upper Carousel like Saturn's rings
Now we see figures reaching outward toward them
reaching and missing and falling -downward against the curtain and the flash of extinction
49		  - At the highest level
straining for the rainbow
50		   - Hysterical
starting to chant
Renew
The man continues to strain: Renew
51		  - Almost a blur
but still straining: ' Renew
52		  - (chanting with the rest) Renew
53		  - The blur
but still there
straining with all his might for the rainbow
' Re
Suddenly, the man
topples into the whirling blackness below
where he is instantly incinerated
54		  - Whirling - whirling - the rainbows shining
55		  - Orgiastic pleasure -- a Spanish crowd at a perfect killing -- , fulfilled
56 57		  - Other figures move to the topmost level
straining for the rainbow bands
58		  - As the  goes on in the b
g
of the
we hear a noise
Logan reaches into a pocket and takes out a small, dark plastic box
Logan looks at the box
On it we see: :   14 (to Francis) Looks like 'm working
Francis stands
Who invited you
'm in my party mood
Logan smiles
and the   them rushing out of the bleachers
They make their way into the hall
Logan takes out the small plastic box
We can tell from his face that he is disappointed
until a faint   emanates from the box
Francis watches as Logan wheels in one direction
the beeping stops
He turns in another direction
again, there is no beeping
As Logan turns in a third direction
the  commences
Logan and Francis move swiftly in that direction and the until Logan and Francis see: 59- 59X11	      - running
:   between Logan and Francis following the running man in the great hall
empty
We can  the   in Carousel offstage
Logan and Francis separate
to encircle the running man
The running man turns a corner and for a moment Logan cannot see him
As Logan turns the corner
Francis is on the other side and at the running man
Francis winks at Logan as he pursues the running man up a ramp and Logan gets it:   little cat and mouse is in order
(:      '
) Logan
just missing the man
Francis  again
just missing, too
The man is in a panic as he continues up the ramp
to various levels and areas
Both barrels (of Logan and Francis' respective guns) glow again as they
with both just missing the running man once more
The man's face is crazed
and sweating
the mouse is going berserk as he has been chased to a high level
He stands frozen, petrified, driven to the edge of a high balcony by the shots--teetering now
He is in full sight of Logan, Francis is across the hall
The Runner1s face
He looks at death twenty feet away--Logan aims
Francis, watching, smiling at the perfect moment
Logan's face
shadow of thought, a hesitation
The Runner lunges
Logan fires, misses
Francis fires a salvo, drives the Runner back to the rail where he teeters again, throws his hands in front of his face and plunges
The  in Carousel reaches a peak
59X12- 63X1 63X2 As he arrives at the dead body of the Runner, bends over him, turns the man's left hand up
We see the flower crystal
Black
Logan takes out his transceiver
63X3 man's face visible
Logan checks it against the face of the dead man
They are not the same
63X4 As Francis comes up, waits
Logan moves the transceiver to the dead man's face, rests it on his forehead
63X5		  : The words appear:
#483 63X6 Scowls for a moment, then shrugs
He takes out a small flat pouch and methodically strips from the body its few personal things, stuffs them into the pouch
Then his eye is caught by the man's right hand, clenched
Logan opens it
metal ankh on a bit of chain
It means nothing to Logan who stuffs it into the pouch and closes it
Now again he fiddles with the transceiver, speaks into it softly
Runner terminated 0:31 (a beat) Ready for cleanup
Done with his job, he rises to face Francis
(smiling) That was a great shot you made
Yes
(beat) But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering
Logan shrugs
He's not sure himself
Together they walk off down the hall, passing 63X7 We see in the distance, a pair of Stickmen descending into the hall, riding through the air on their odd vehicles, passing overhead then descending
One hovers not far away as the other comes down, hangs a few feet over the body
63X8		1ST The driver makes sure he's in position, then presses a button on one of the arms of the vehicle
There is a broad spray of vapor from the bottom which covers the corpse
63X9		 () It turns to crystals which sag away from the human form, as a sand sculpture erodes when it's dry
63X10		1ST Satisfied, he revs his machine and it rises smoothly out of the As it leaves, the second machine moves down and into its place
63X11		2ND Glances at the crystals, maneuvers into position, presses his buttons
63X12		  -  , Sucked up into the machine as it hovers
As the floor is once again bare, the 2nd Stickman revs slightly and his machine pulls up and away
63X13 As the Stickmen move up and out, we see the exhilarated crowd beginning to pour out of Carousel
63X14		   - Descending from the top level -- not much of a crowd
Francis is gesturing toward the Hallucimill
Well  think you're getting stale
You need old Lucey--Go on
Gee the whole burn--try the new psycho-lift-they tell me it turns you inside out
He shoves Logan in that direction and continues on down
(calling after him) 'll look for you here when 'm off-- And he is gone
63X15 waves, smiling, then turns to the Hallucimill
63X16		 -
Crazy, man
63X17 Hesitates, as a  push past him gleefully on their way
He looks and we see: 63X18		 - , The people from Carousel starting to pour in, loud, happy, ready for more fun
63X19 Not with it
He turns and starts making his way downwards towards the exit
63X20		' As he enters
Idle, restless
He crosses to a sideboard--makes himself a drink, sips, doesn't like it
Gets rid of it, makes another
He fiddles with things, a game--sits, gets up
Now he is beginning to feel the drink
Takes another belt, smiles
Now he goes over to a tall wall recess flanked by a console with many dials
63X21 As Logan dials, blurred and smoky images appear in the recess--a slow protoplasmic eddying in many colors
He tunes it in and the figure of a smiling young man appears--bejeweled, lustrous, willing
63X22 Bored as Mastroianni turns the dial again and the young man dissolves
He dials again and now a beautiful young woman takes shape
It is Jessica
63X23 Still in the recess, she makes no gesture of interest, no smile
Around her neck, from a collar, a dangling ankh
It catches Logan's eye
He smiles, clicks another dial and she becomes real
He reaches out a hand and leads her out into the room
64 As Jessica turns to him, Logan moves in strongly and embraces her- but, to his surprise, she resists
Logan, still holding her loosely, is amused and surprised
What's wrong, Available
(breaking away gently) Please
No
She backs away, almost apologetically
Logan follows, smiling
Please
no
(noting that she looks trapped, he understands) You mean "not here"--that's it
You're a private Available but particular, (he is moving in on her as he speaks, she retreating, which amuses him) Don't worry
There's no one here but me
And you
No
(that stops him) Just no
You prefer women
No
Well then
Nothing
felt sad,  put myself on the circuit
It was a mistake
Sad
What made you sad
friend of mine went on Carousel tonight
Now he's gone
(after a beat) Yes
probably he was renewed
(flatly) He was killed Killed
Why do you use that word
Isn't it right
Isn't that what you do
Kill
never 'killed' anybody in my life
Sandmen terminate  Runners (a beat) Who brought you
Nobody
felt sad
put myself on the circuit
You felt sad
What's your name
Jessica
(matter-of-fact) You're beautiful
Let's have sex
No
Later
No
But you put yourself on the circuit
thought  had to do something
And
changed my mind And now
Curious
About what
How a Sandman lives
Logan smiles, takes off gunbelt, etc
Let's have sex
(as Jessica shakes her head) thought you were curious
Not about that
(after a beat) 'm listening
'm afraid to tell you
(smiling) 'm not armed
(a beat) Well
Why is it wrong to run
You shouldn't even think such things
(smiles) And you picked a strange person to say them to - suppose
But what if you want to live
So
Do what everyone does
Try like hell for renewal
Logan stretches out his right hand
We see a red flower crystal embedded and centered in his right palm
It is exactly the same shape that we have seen in black in the palm of the dead runner
When this turns black
that's it
(laughs) If for any reason you want to be 31
you have the same chance as everyone else
Carrousel
Logan takes his gun and points it at her
(playfully) But if you're one of the misfits
that's where  come in
(somewhat frightened) didn't say that  would run
Just
(interrupting; turning over her palm) Are you a 5 or a 6
(we see a green crystal) Six
go red next year
You're years away
don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them
(offering Jessica the gun) Want to try
Jessica shakes her head
Logan looks at Jessica carefully
in an admiring sexual way
from her toes to her head
briefly noticing (in the process) chat she is wearing an identical piece of jewelry that he has taken off the dead runner
around her neck
What Quad do you live in
(softly) You're sure you don't want to try
Jessica nods
It's nice to know you can nod
Jessica smiles
It's nice co know you can do that, too
Suddenly Francis and two dishevel led young  burst in and come laughing toward Logan and Jessica Stoned, hilarious, they crowd around Logan one of them embracing him
In the wild hilarity, Jessica slips away and Logan, seeing her go, makes a vain effort after her
Francis notices, laughs
Amid the noise he shouts to Logan: These are for me -- you've got your own
(looking after Jessica) She must have been something--
At Logan's expression he roars with laughter Francis picks up an atomizer and hurls it at the ceiling where it shatters and a great pink cloud settles over them all
64X1
-
frowning structure of dark stone and mirrored copper, fronted by broad steps
Logan and Francis are climbing the steps as a is coming out
His uniform is in tatters
They greet one another
then: What happened to you
(embarrassed) lost a Runner in Cathedral
How come
Ran into some Cubs  couldn't manage
(as they stare) One of them cut me bad
(extends his arm and moves a finger from his shoulder to his wrist) all the way down
(with anger) (shrug) On my way to the New You for repairs
Get yourself a new face while you're at it They know you now
They wave
Logan and Francis continue
64AX1- 64BX1 64CX1
-
( ) As Logan and Francis cross, turn into a corridor
just might look in on New You 483 myself
You
Why
You're already beautiful
No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him
64X2
-
- As Logan and Francis cross the room, Logan nods to other Sandmen, who are monitoring areas of the Megalopolis on video consoles
One of these Sand-men speaks to Francis who hasn't greeted them (Monitor) What's with you, Francis
(touching his head; grimacing) Last night The other Sandmen, including Logan, smile as Logan and Francis continue to: 65-68 69
-
- Black door opens revealing Logan and Francis who now enter a mammoth room
As they walk
they pass
, Each  pulses out the moments of every person alive in the city, governing everyone's crystal changes automatically shifting to the next  when the time comes
There are no humans
Francis walks over to a circular table at the end of the room
above which is a circular overhang
There is a groove
the shape of a palm crystal on one part of the circular table
Francis takes out the plastic bag which contains the contents of the dead Runner's pockets and starts putting the contents on the table
(These contents are the ones from the Runner Francis has killed at the beginning of the film
) The moment the first item touches the table
it activates a scanner on the overhang above
Francis stands alongside the table
his attitude is very matter-of fact
He has been through this procedure many, many times
He touches his head
(the hangover)
and Logan smiles
Moments later
the scanner stops
the word: appears on a
Francis places his palm into the groove
and the words: -7 appear on the
See you in the hydrotoner
Logan nods
Francis exits as Logan places the contents of a plastic bag with the items he has taken off the Runner who jumped to his death
Among them is the odd-shaped piece of jewelry
Logan is standing nonchalantly
as the scanner moves over the items
waiting to be quickly identified and cleared as Francis was earlier
The scanner continues scanning
Logan starts becoming impatient
but the scanning goes on and on and on
Now
Logan is clearly puzzled
it has never
ever taken anything remotely resembling this length of time
Suddenly, directly before him
on the
the word: blinks on and off
on and off
catching Logan's attention
As Logan turns toward the
the scanner stops moving
The word blinks off and is replaced by the word: We can tell from Logan's expression as he walks to the corner
that he has never seen this before
Logan sits in a chair in the area facing the
There is a stellar groove (that we have seen on the Table) the shape of a palm crystal
glowing on an arm of the chair
The word on the  is now: Logan places his right palm with the flower crystal into the groove
We hear a
then: The piece of jade Jewelry appears on the  and below the piece of jewelry the following words appear on the : :
:
Negative
Question: What is it
Words on  now read: :
: Negative
Words on  now read: :   - don't understand
Words on  now read: 1056
Question: Word on  now reads: It disappears and words on  now read: 1056
1056 unaccounted for
Word on  reads: Impossible
(Rising tone) Question: Maybe they weren't all Runners
Maybe most of them reached Life Renewal on Carousel
Words on  read: 1056
Question: None of them reached renewal
Word on  reads: But everyone believes that some
Words on  read: : 1056
- 5 Question: You mean nobody's ever been renewed
Words on  read: - -
-
As Logan reacts the new words which appear read: (startled) The Seal
(Breaks off) Question: The Seals
Go outside
But there's nothing outside
The words on the  read: will
The words on the  read: Question: (a beat) What if  need help from another Sandman
The words on the  read: : -5 Logan takes a breath
Question:  am six Red
how can pretend to be approaching Lastday
The words on the  read: -- My Lifeclock
(slightest beat) Question: My Life-- Before the startled Logan can finish
he feels a shock of pain and his hand is immobile
Logan stares at the back of his hand as if it wasn't his
His forehead shines with sweat
Now the entire area, including the chair and the screen begins to glow bright red
The glowing becomes so bright that Logan is forced to close his eyes
As the glow subsides
Logan looks at his right hand
The red flower crystal in his palm is blinking
He stares at it, fascinated, fearful
Question: (urgent tone) Am  still six Red
The words on the  read: - (standing) know that but  had four more years (extending the blinking palm) This means ten days to Lastday
Of course  will get the four years back, won't
The words on the  read: (very urgent) Question: Do  get my four years back
Too late
The  is
For a moment his lips part as if to say something more but he changes his mind, turns away
Now Logan walks over to the table and removes the ankh
Almost automatically, he starts moving his hand toward the groove
but the already has the words: -5 Logan looks at it - then: The   Logan out of the mammoth room
past the where he pauses
glances at his and continues out into: 69X1
-  - Spectacularly 23rd century
Logan enters
He looks around and spots Francis
in a whirlpool bath
trying to recover from has incredible hangover
In the b
g
of the  we can see some Sandmen doing calisthenics
Logan walks over to Francis
hiding his blinking crystal by holding his hand against his leg
What the hell took you so long
(after a beat) Did you ever see anybody renew
think you've been skulling out too much
First Nursery and now stupid questions
Did you
Of course
Anybody we know
Look
why don't you get into the water
you need it
more than  do
(after a beat) 'm fine
(walking away) See you
At Carousel tonight
Logan nods, exits
The   on a slightly puzzled for a moment then  Logan out to: 70
- Logan is on the steps, irresolute
He looks at his blinking crystal
moves as if to reenter, changes his mind
Now takes out the black box, dials
(into box) Location
female Green Six
name Jessica
living in Quad
71-73 73X1
- ' Logan opens the door to see Jessica
Behind her a young  who has obviously escorted her there
(smiling) She says she's been here before
She has
Jessica half turns and shrugs a 'see
'
The young Sandman's smile widens, he waves to Logan and shoves off
You could have called me yourself
But  wasn't sure you'd come
(the game has started) Here  am
(beat) Shall  come in
Logan gestures, leading her inside to the living area
couldn't get you out of my mind
'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen,  suppose
Maybe
sure
Thanks
but  have the choice
Of course
Then it's still no
Logan laughs
You can have any woman in the city
What do you really want
You know don't believe you
There has to be more
All right
Logan extends his right hand
He turns his right palm so that
Jessica can see it blinking red
Jessica gasps for a moment
then: Why show me
'm going to run
(after reacting) Why tell me
You know something
About running, dying what
Both
running's what 'm interested in
know what everyone knows
Try like hell for Renewal
You have the same chance everyone else has
It's different now
Help me
How can
Logan takes out the ankh
Where did you get that
Runner gave it to me
And then you killed him, right
let him go
believe me
don't
(a beat) Speak to your friends for me, Jessica
please
Please
What friends
(clutching the ankh, looking at Jessica's; then:) don't have much time
never heard of a Sandman running ever
(putting the ankh in his pocket; dropping the bombshell) And  never heard of Sanctuary
Jessica reacts
She is about to speak
doesn't
Logan reaches out and touches her hand
What can  do to make you believe me
Jessica draws her hand away quickly from his touch
Logan stands and starts out
as Jessica watches him
74-81 82
-  ,   - There are three men and a woman seated at a table
Jessica reaches the table and sits down
83		  - distance away
watching
84-85 86
-  -   -   , Eating without enthusiasm
obviously more interested in their conversation
He's blinking
so what
Sandmen get old, too
But what if he's telling the truth
say no
It's not worth the risk
absolutely agree
He's killed Runners for a decade
He has no feelings
He was born a Sandman
He had no choice
Neither do we
87-88 88X1 Four Sandmen at the consoles
They look up as Francis enters
He goes to one of the men who stretches, yawns, gets up
1ST Thanks, Francis
(taking his place at the console) Just don't be forever about it like last time
1ST Ah-h you love it
You're afraid you'll miss a really good Run
They all laugh
Francis takes up his watch as the other exits
89 89X1		 -  - Leaning together talking in an undertone (urgently) If he believes you, he'll come
Why Arcade Station
(impatiently) Why
It's our only chance--kill him and get away in the crowd heading for the evening slaughter -- Right at the station itself
No - just there - on the first level
(beat) Don't look for us
We'll see you
(cutting in) You don't seem quite sure, Jessica
(beat) Can you do it
Will you
Slowly, Jessica nods
Tonight
(stalling) -yes
if  can find him
think you can
Don't you
Jessica faces her squarely, nods
The woman looks deeply into her eyes, relaxes
'm sorry
We all are
But he has heard about Sanctuary -- and that makes him dangerous to all of us
After murmurs of agreement: (staring at Jessica) We're counting on you
Jessica exits
They look at each other in dismay
After a moment, one of the men follows her
They don't trust her
90-92 93-94 94A1		  - Obviously enjoying the work, watching--tracking a Runner's progress, the assignment of a Sandman, the kill
94X1 Making her way through the strolling crowd, her face thoughtful
94X2 The man from the restaurant, following
94X3		,   -- Walking slowly up to a door, she hesitates,
Logan opens the door, reacts
Are you here to help me
What do you need
moment, then Logan moves toward her hungrily, pulling her in to him as the door closes
94X4 : 94X5 Walking along a handsomely landscaped stream
Laughing together, stopping to admire the beautiful fish (koi)
What're you going to do
That's tomorrow
(turning away slightly) wish  could help you
(turning her gently back) Maybe you'll chink of something
(hating herself) wish  knew what you think  know
Logan smiles at her, both knowing what's false, but drawn to each other anyhow
They commence walking again
94X6 The followers, ahead now, watching, trying to make up their minds as to whether Jessica is bringing Logan to the ambush
As they argue, Logan and Jessica approach
94X7 If you did know, you'd tell me
Of course-- (overriding) If you trusted me, you'd know
(evading it) We're coming to Arcade
(beat)	- Shall we Relive together
94X8 As they pass, Jessica looks full in the face of one of the followers, looks away
Logan does not notice
The followers are partly reassured
One of the men is now holding a garrote made from his necklace
The man who first followed gestures and the others go off purposefully
He continues after Logan and Jessica as they exit round a corner
94X9 94AX9 As 1st Sandman returns, still cheerfully chewing
Francis is reluctant to give up his place and when he does, he remains standing there, watching
He loves the work--they all do
94X10	 - Logan and Jessica entering
Logan is aware of Jessica's increasing tension
He pretends unconcern, but he is wary
94X11 Behind them, visible through the crowd--two of the men we saw before
The Follower and the man with the garrote
They are moving so as to intersect with Logan and Jessica where the crowd is thickest, streams coming together to move to a higher level
94X12 As they move, fearful--torn between her promise and her feeling for Logan
Catching a glimpse of the followers, she makes a small sound, hesitates, pretends to have stumbled
94X13 Closer now, closing in -- the wire garrote gleaming between the man's hands
94X14 Suddenly she stops
He comes round facing as people eddy by them
Logan looks at her searchingly
Tell me, Jessica
Behind him the two men move in
The man with the garrote raises his hands
One more step
Logan senses something, half-turns just as we hear a familiar urgent --the sound of his transceiver
Behind him the man hesitates, drops his hands
Logan takes the transceiver from his belt and moves out of the crowd to the side, Jessica with him
Now he bends to read the message and Jessica cranes her head to see too
94X15	  - As the Runner alarm pulses and the readout flashes its message: :  -2 -5 The Sandman at the console turns and says: 1ST Hey, Logan's got a mean one tonight-- why don't you-- But Francis is already at the door
wave and he's gone
The others ad lib interest-- "watch out in there--they can cut you before you see them" etc
95-105 105X1	  - The two watching, muscles taut -- wondering
106- 106X1 106X2	 -   - As he speaks he leads her into the maze-car station and punches out his destination on the car caller
Runner
Cathedral
woman
106X3	- You're not going, are you
(a beat) Why not
Maybe she'll help me
You won't
You'd better stay here
The maze-car arrives and they move to it
(touching his arm) 'd rather be with you
(knowing she is lying through her teeth) That's nice
They enter the car which instantly moves off
As it passes, the men in ambush come forward and read the destination
They ring for another car which pulls in immediately
107- 109X1 109X2 As the two jam into the maze-car which rockets off in pursuit
110- 120 121		 - - -    - Have you ever been through Cathedral
Jessica shakes her head
They're like beasts
Wild
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders
(interrupting, grimacing) Instead of what
Nine months inside a woman: (ugh) We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral
Some people say children need human mothering
Insane
Nurseries are better than any mother could be
'm only telling you what 've heard
(slightest beat) Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like
Uh-uh
have
(after a beat) When did you begin to question Lastday
don't remember exactly
except  was a Green
(another beat) What would you like to relive, Logan
(smiling) Let's see - how long has it been
As Jessica turns her head
looking somewhat guilty, the maze-car slides to a stop
warning light pulses on the car's console and a speaks before the hatch opens
Attention passengers
Cathedral Station is a personal risk area
Persons with business are warned to be careful
121X1
- - - Now the hatch opens
They step out, Logan first, Jessica timidly, looking around
Behind them the hatch closes, the maze-car sighs away into the distance
've never been in this quadrant
(looks off) Is that Arcade off there
There are standing on the maze-car platform -- a high overlook like an "elevated" station
121X2	 - Arcade shining like distant fireworks
122
- -   - Below them a narrow, sharply angled concrete canyon, buttressed walls rising featureless
The look of an old fortress, blank, dim and cool
Still visible over an opening the chiseled legend "Cathedral Plaza--2025
--Skidmore, Rosenfelt, Hennesy architects
" Jessica shivers, looking around her
Logan takes her arm and they descend into the canyon, move toward the wall
Their footsteps the only
Let me go first
Sometimes they're waiting just inside there--to rush you when it opens
Quickly now-- He helps her through the narrow opening--the portal's walls are very thick
They turn abruptly and see: 123
-  - room of angled, reflecting surfaces
At one end a jagged corridor, also mirrored, leads away
The zigzag, angled effect creates an absolute confusion of images
but Logan leads her unhesitatingly across the chamber to the corridor
Jessica hangs back, momentarily certain she's about to smash into something
(guiding her) Just follow--no matter how it seems
(doing her best) But what is this--why
(as they enter the corridor) The Cubs
When they're flying on muscle there's  no way to catch up
Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us-- (gesture) too fast Muscle
don't know that one
Logan is leading her down the zigzag corridor
It's stop and go--a fun house in which you can get hurt
It's unauthorized
No good for any- one over thirteen anyhow--shakes you to pieces--speeds everything up to a blur-- (he is amused) you can see what happens when some flying Cub tries to go through this on muscle--splat
Jessica reacts
to what Logan has said
then:   moment later: 124 As they approach the end of the corridor, a small  in a tattered garment approaches them
She stops  as she sees Logan and Jessica
(gently) Don't be afraid
We see that it is a little  of seven
Her face is grimy and hair is tangled
What's your name
'm Mary 2
Where do you live, Mary
Here
Why aren't you in Nursery
'm very smart
When do you go up
never go upstairs
You're a nice old lady
As soon as she finishes her last sentence, Mary grabs at Jessica's clothing
tearing a pin (piece of Jewelry) off
and running away swiftly
As Jessica instinctively starts after her
Logan
holds her back
(shaking his head) Not here
Might be a decoy
Cautiously, Logan and Jessica exit from the wall, stepping out into- 125
- An area of rubble and dilapidated buildings
Logan crouches, holding the transceiver and fanning the area, listening
: a soft beeping which abruptly grows louder and holds steady
Logan gestures to Jessica to follow him, and moves carefully in the direction of the , quartering occasionally like a hunting dog
Coming up to an angle of wall, he stops, flicks the sound off, puts the machine back onto his belt
He gestures to Jessica to stand still then he straightens, steps out, calls: Runner
Silence
Jessica involuntarily moves to him and as she does, the Runner moves from behind an upright and stands
- The figure is shadowed, the arms out, palms facing in a kind of gesture of surrender
In the Runner's left hand, the tiny red crystal pulses on and off
The Runner is a woman
There is an instant of frozen confrontation and then suddenly Jessica gasps, grasping at him
As Logan whirls: 125X1 Suddenly, from everywhere out of the shadows, a pack of snarling Cubs materializes--moving with blinding speed
At their appearance the Runner whirls and races off into the dark shadows
Logan makes a futile gesture after her, then turns to face the Cubs
strutting, feral-faced fourteen or fifteen year old heads the pack, dressed in fierce-looking tatters and hung with rip-off trophies
He gestures to one of his followers to stand still
(speaking of the Runner) Don't worry about her
We'll have that one later
Right now  think we've got a Runner and his pairup
And what a Runner
The   the other Cubs
mean, filthy
We're going to have ourselves a time, we are
Right, Billy
There is a chilling laughter of agreement from the rest
'm a Sandman
cut up a Sandman yesterday
They said 'd never get him
but  cut him up good,  did
(firm tone) feel sorry for you, boy
Some murmuring as the pack watches their leader
For me
Better feel sorry for your- self, Sandman
No, for you
How old are you, Billy
Billy is silent
Fourteen
Fifteen
Your days are running out
How long can you last
year
Six months
(he points to the yellow flower in Billy's palm) What happens when you're sixteen and you go green
(lashing out) Nothing will happen
make the rules as  go
Cubs do what  say
Always have
Always will
got Cathedral and 'll never let go
No cubs over fifteen, Billy
Ever heard of a cub with a green flower
You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here
(slightest beat) If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart
Shut up
Shut up your damn mouth
Logan falls back into a fighting crouch
but before he can strike a blow
he is grabbed and slammed against the wall of an abandoned building
Let him suck Muscle
That'll shut his mouth
Let's watch him shake himself to death
We see the Cubs take out drugpads
They squeeze the pads and inhale the "Muscle
" At once their movements become blurringly rapid
They take menacing positions - some leaping overhead
Give him some Muscle
Like lightning they change positions and flash around Logan and Jessica 126		  - Watching
terrified
127		  - Being held against the wall by Cubs as: Shake him to death
Kill him
128		  - moving a drugpad against Logan's face
Logan is holding his breath
desperately trying not to breathe the "Muscle" directly from the pad into his system
(chilling laugh) He's trying to hold his breath
As Billy presses the pad tighter against Logan's face: With all his might, Logan wrenches his arms loose
drops to the ground and pulls out his gun
He fires and fire girdles a pillar
and they start to back away
We can rush him
we can take can take him	again, we can
The pack hesitates
stops backing away
(moving the gun slowly back and forth) All right
How many of you want this to be Lastday
The pack moves back again
and  disperses, leaving Billy facing Logan alone
Come on, Billy
come on
you cut a Sandman, didn't you
Logan tucks the gun back into his waist
Come on, Billy
cut me
Come on After a beat, Billy turns and runs away
Logan comforts the shivering Jessica for a moment then takes out the small box from his pocket and turns it
until it starts
The   Logan and Jessica
following the
They move over the rubble
and cautiously around abandoned buildings
We
and  the Cubs who've only obviously found and attacked someone
The  is coming from a different direction than where the beeping is coming from
(shaking his head) They've got someone else
Why would anybody come here
Jessica shudders as the scream dies abruptly
The  is now very loud
Logan homes in on an abandoned building, enters, crosses swiftly to a door inside and kicks it down
We  the Runner
The  cringing, expecting death
129		  - frozen for a moment
In f
g
a figure stirs, moves and we see it is Francis
His weapon is drawn and aimed, but as he watches, he lowers the barrel and smiles
The is Logan's job
130		  - watching 131 (nearing hysteria) There's been a terrible error
My Lifeclock must have broken in some way
(rising tone) 'm nowhere near thirty
look at me
'm twenty-two
should be green
Did you hear me
(shouting) Green
(quietly) Don't be afraid-- Before Logan can continue
the Woman
who is now wild-eyed and hysterical lunges at Logan
and starts grappling with him
'll kill you
'll kill you
After Logan pushes her away
and she falls down: (breathing hard) 'm not going to hurt you
Slowly, she rises
Logan takes out the ankh
Sanctuary
Anything
Logan reaches into his pocket and takes out a small round object
the size of a large marble
If they find you throw this hard enough to break it
Then hold your breath till you get away
It's blind gas
Her reaction is blank, then, with desperate ferocity she attacks Logan again
During the course of the struggle, Logan subdues her again
Jessica enters, bends over the near-crazed Runner as Logan holds her
Eyeing him, the woman stands and takes the small round object
she appears somewhat bewildered as Logan and Jessica move off
132
-        - - He is shocked, unbelieving
133 Stunned and uncertain, Francis aims his gun toward Logan and Jessica
but he wavers
watching them disappear into the rubble
134		  - shivering like a wet dog
He turns toward open window
(in a firm, cold tone) Runner
The woman turns, staring insanely
Her mouth opens like a fish as: Francis  his gun
moment later, as the burning body topples to the floor; 134X1		-  - hearing the unmistakable  sound of the kill, they exchange a look
135 At the flash of  from Francis' gun, they turn
Logan and Francis' eyes meet
beat, then Logan grabs Jessica and pulls her away
136 After a long, long hesitation, takes out his small plastic box and starts to speak into it: (quietly) Runner terminated at
16 Ready for cleanup at Cathedral Quadrant 39
137		  - The Second and Third Men
very close to the maze-car platform
peering into the darkness and seeing Logan and Jessica emerge onto the maze-car platform
We can tell from the way the two men look at one another that they believe Logan has fired the shot they have heard
They hide from the approaching Logan and Jessica
almost believed her
They move off soundlessly
Behind them, a maze-car has arrived
138
-  - Gun in hand
running through Cathedral toward the maze-car platform
139
- - -    - 'm ashamed
was bringing you to be killed
Where
Sanctuary
Can you take me there
Logan,  don't know where Sanctuary is
But if  take you to them, they'll kill you
(a beat) All right
But why
didn't kill the Runner
(interrupting) Yes, but they won't know that
or care
They're hunting you, Logan
Maybe me too, now
(wry laugh) That's nothing
there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon
Take me to them
(torn) -  can't
Then - why don't you leave me - go to them - explain No
Not that either
Logan considers her
long
Thinking, then: All right
New You 483
'll find out myself
139X1
-    - Distracted
ignoring the greetings of Sandmen who are monitoring the city
139X2		  - Walking past the   into the debriefing area
The scanners begin moving
Moments later the scanner stops
the word: appears on a  Francis pauses a moment and places his palm into the groove
Now he takes out the items of the dead woman Runner and places them on the scanning table
An   and the word: flashes on and off on the
Sandmen come running into the Area
What happened
Francis hesitates
then
quickly, as if changing his mind, taking the items off the table: Can you beat it
've got the damn wrong bag
You ought to put yourself on reliefcall, Francis
(starting out) Yeah
140
-   #483 -   - as they enter   #483 they are being watched by: 141
- safe distance behind
142
-   #483 The waiting room has many mirrors
where customers
male and female
are checking their faces (and bodies)
There are also various photographs on the walls
suggestions for changes to foreheads, eyes, cheeks, lips, etcetera
The chatty informality is very much like people in a beauty parlor or barber shop
There is a  seated behind a desk in a corner
Logan and Jessica walk up to the desk
The receptionist looks at Logan
ignoring Jessica
Hello, Sandman
Hello
Do you want to see Doc
Logan nods, impatient - he knows someone's watching
We don't get many Sandmen
think we've only had one other since 've been here
(brusquely) Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else
Where's the doctor
(smiling) like your face
Would you mind if Doc took a picture
'd Like him to give your face to somebody else
It's all right with me
Is he here
My name's Holly
Holly 13
In ancient times they said my number was unlucky
Do you believe in luck
No - Look, 'm in a hurry
Doc'll be with you soon, Sandman
Logan and Jessica walk to one of the chairs in the waiting area and sit down next to an attractive
Is this your first time
Logan and Jessica nod
(smiling) This is my third
(a beat) did it when  turned yellow
and green
(showing her palm) turned red yesterday
(looking) Beautiful work
This man do them all
No
But  hear he's terrific
Have you seen any of his work
Just one
Doc's ready, Sandman
Logan and Jessica stand
They follow Holly into a large, shining, stainless steel room where we see: 143
- who looks about twenty-one years old, exchanges a pointed look with Jessica
It's a real privilege, Sandman
Thanks
(slightest beat) thought you'd be older
ex- pected a Red
(showing his palm; the flower crystal is Red) am
Your own work
(with pride) And  did it myself right on there
144		 -  - Aesculaptor Mark  -- the latest in servo-surgical designs
Completely self-contained -- tilt-bed, cryojector services embedded in the platform
The Mark 's laser heads are integrated into the whole cocoon, swiveled and gimbaled so as to be able to focus any of the surgical beams in microscopic delicacy or wide-bladed scraping
The machine vaguely resembles an enormously complicated x-ray table on an angle -- the great slotted laser heads overhanging it and Integral with it
From the cryonic receptor base there is a steady exhalation of cold -- the vapor seeping steadily downwards, blurring the endlessly looped and tangled tubes and wires and containers Which join in solid state circuitry so that any random or involuntary twitch of a patient will be instantly compensated by an equivalent move of the laser head -- keeping the focus precise
At one end -- where the halves of the Mark  join, is n console of switches and dials -- lights nod servo-recorders which control the operation from the first injection of cold to the final healing vacuum drafts and scar burnishing
With the air of a magician demonstrating, Doc goes to the console and flips switches
Instantly the table responds -- the platform tilting, the crab-like laser arms descending flexing -- small vapor jets oozing as the beams slash harmlessly across the table
Beaming, Doc turns it off and the whole apparatus subsides
designed it myself
(slightest beat) What'll it be
a face job or a full-body job
Just the face
Fine
Holly will get you ready
You're in good hands, believe me
Holly comes forward and unbuttons the collar on Logan's tunic
As Holly brushes her fingertips lightly down Logan's arms: Holly works here because she gets a lift out of watching the Table
(smiles) and other things
'll be back in a minute
He's going to sterilize himself
Do  have to undress
Not for your face
Logan follows Holly to the Table
(Jessica remains behind with Doc who speaks to her with soft urgency)
You shouldn't have brought him here
; didn't bring him -- what's the difference
He's blinking
He wants to run
Run
He's a Sandman
tell you he's running
know
Maybe
Maybe
But  wish he'd gone somewhere else
(a beat, a shrug) All right
He gets a face
144X1		   - Logan lies down
The Table ripples
accepting his weight prisoning and positioning him
(leaning - close to Logan) like dark hair
Have him give you dark hair
' All set
Um huh
Would you take a picture of him, Doc
'd like you to give his face to somebody else
Why not
Doc pushes a button
there is a tiny
Do you have anything special in mind
don't care
Just get it over with
(smiling) Hurry
hurry
hurry
(whispering) Dark hair
Holly'd like dark hair
Holly'd like a lot of things
(studying Logan's face) We can start by narrowing the cheekbones
Doc presses buttons on the control board
Jessica, who is standing next to Doc, is slightly startled as the Table begins to
as a pair of laser beams separate themselves from the overhead cluster and extend toward Logan, forming inner cones as they approach
CryoJector needles start to close in on them, nearing their faces and shoulders slowly
the visible cold streaming off the points
vibrobeam begins to
: An insistent chiming
Doc hears the sound and turns with the martyred air of a man who's been called to the phone too many times
He turns to a phone-like apparatus nearby, shifting the table into neutral as he turns
The table and the laser heads stop moving
(as if speaking on a phone) Hello (listening) Yes (listening) Yes, they are
(listening; his expression changing) Done
Doc turns back to the console, pausing to stare intently at Logan, then up at the brightly smiling Holly
Something in his look registers, and Holly's smile fades
Now Doc engages the machine again
Pay attention, Sandman
'm proud of this machine
As he speaks he presses and an arm sweeps downward and into position near Logan's face
It pauses as With this one there's no waiting for scar burnishing
It's all in one
watch now
The laser arm sweeps across Logan's forehead and cheeks, leaving a bright trail of blood as But here's the improvement
Instant healing---before you feel a thing
Watch now
Doc pushes a special button and the arm sweeps back along the track, spraying healing fluid
Magically the blood vanishes and the skin is moist and whole
144X2		   - His face tense--he knows something's wrong
Over him Holly's bright face with its rapt look
She's not sure, but she enjoys whatever's happening
144X3 who is playing the console as he speaks
Perfect depth adjustment on this one, Sandman
The beam will cut through that uniform and just exactly through the skin beneath-- absolute precision
Watch now And the machine does its stuff, slashing through Logan's tunic--a seam of blood following the rip
Of course, it doesn't mend uniforms, Sandman, but otherwise it does everything, doesn't it
Just imagine what would happen to you if the healing stopped functioning
And the arm moves back again, spraying the healing fluid into Logan's new wound
Again the blood disappears
Suddenly Doc's look is ferocious
He turns off the healing switch and punches buttons fiercely
The laser arms begin to move wildly and the  become shrill
Holly looks alarmed
No
You're scrambling the table
He'll be cut to pieces, Doc
Damn right
It was a trap
They know
No - 'm Running
Machine begins to
Jessica tries to turn the machine off
Doc starts to wrestle with her as: 145-145X4		:   - Moving
Watching two stun beams lower
Doc knocks Jessica down
She is groggy on the floor as The stun beams lance into Logan's cheeks
The Table holds him, biting into his right leg below the knee
146-148 Watching intently as: 149-150		  - As surgical beams slit his shirt from the shoulder to the waist leaving two threads of blood
vacu-head dips to suck the blood away neatly
151		  - As Logan desperately sucks in his belly
trying to flatten himself into the Table
152-153	  - As laser blades cut into his face
followed by a spray of healing liquid on the cuts
154		 - Excited
flushed
as: 155		 - As two wide blades of light sweep downward
and hover three inches above his neck
and keep lowering
loudly
and one inadvertently frees Logan's right arm
156		  - Shocked as Logan reaches for his gun
157		 -
As dozens of laser beams slash toward Logan
he twists away
and breaks off
jumping off the Table
Doc rushes Logan holding what appears to he a frozen police billy
In an instant he has knocked Logan's gun away
and as Logan looks down at it
we see it lying on the floor completely frozen
Slowly, Doc moves toward Logan the short smoke-colored stick menacing in his hand
(out-of-breath) What  told you is the
Abruptly, Doc lunges toward Logan
missing him as Logan ducks away
As Doc turns to attack
Logan smashes his elbows into Doc's chest and Doc falls back onto the Table
157X1	  - , as Doc is slashed by the machine amid showers of sparks and gouts of steam as the metal twists and wires short out and various fluids boil and spill onto hot surfaces
Holly tries to fight her way into the mess to help Doc, but Jessica, recovering, pulls her down and the two struggle
157X2	  - In terror as the laser beams begin to slash him to ribbons
157X3 Making an effort to stop the machine, pulling levers and pushing buttons in vain
He sees what's happening, pulls Jessica away from Holly and, grabbing up his gun and tunic, heads for the entrance
Crossing the waiting room they are stopped by the sight of: 158- 162XI 163 Entering
gun in hand
164		  - As they face Francis
165		  - (frowning) What's going on, Logan
It has nothing to do with you
(choking but still loyal) What are you talking about
saw you let a Runner go
(up a notch) saw you, Logan
Tell me
Suddenly the machine behind them erupts into a great burst of smoke and noise, momentarily drawing Francis' attention
Instantly Logan jumps him, grabs and throws him sprawling
Without a look back, he and Jessica run out
166 166X1 Enraged, finds his gun on the floor and, before rising, gets off a shot at them as they disappear
Then leaping to his feet, dashing off in pursuit
167 Logan and Jessica running through Arcade
167X1 Suddenly she pulls him in another direction
Follow me, Logan
Stay close
As they run into Hallucimill
Francis
never too far behind
spots them and follows
168- 173 174
-  -   - Exiting from the other side
and running through the crowd toward and into a Love Shop
followed by Francis coming out of the Hallucimill, too
and running toward the Love Shop
175
-   - As they enter the hot darkness
The Love Shop is throbbing with sexuality
In it, the darkness breaks at Irregular intervals -- when booths and cubicles flare into brilliance, each time revealing an orgiastic tableau
The Love Shop is multi-leveled and the random flashes may appear from any direction at any time, blinding and stunning the viewer
Logan and Jessica pause to get their bearings and as they do, a beautiful  grabs Logan, pulling and laughing: have an empty one, Sandman Logan tries to pull away, looks around for Jessica just in time to see a man almost carrying her off
Then the light is gone again and Jessica with it
176 As she tears at his clothing, wrapping herself around him, trying to pull him down
Then, as the light flares again she suddenly lets go and grabs another man
Logan is, freed, starts looking for Jessica
177- 179 Logan hunting through the Love Shop, fighting them off
of the suddenly-illuminated tableaus
Sex, manifold and multiform -- everybody doing it
180		  - Entering, starting to look around -- grabbed by one of the laughing Wantons
181-182	, Brief glimpses of them looking for each other
183 Hunting both
184 As he suddenly collides with a woman -- shoves her away and sees it's Jessica
Now together they make for an archway where multiple mirrors enclose them
Suddenly they are in darkness
Then a heavy door slides open and Jessica leads Logan through the opening
Behind them the door slides shut again
185 Desperately trying to get rid of a woman, sees a flash of Logan and Jessica far across the room -sees them leave
Then he's pulled down again as the orgy continues
186- 186X1 186X2
- After a moment, Jessica takes Logan's hand and they start down in the darkness
The  of Love Shop still heard from behind the wall
Are you taking me to them
Yes
(beat) don't know what else to do -- with him following us
(she hesitates) Why do you keep running from your-- Because he's my friend - (a beat) and  don't want to be killed by him - or anyone
He's good, isn't he
Will he find us and kill us
Yes
or one of the others
(a beat) You know there's only one place to go now
(hopelessly) They won't believe us
(beat) 'd rather take my chances with them
than with Francis
They won1t listen
(interrupting) You think Sandmen will
(before she can answer) There's no other way for me, We'll convince them
They pause
He puts his hand over hers
Jessica is silent
Then she turns his hand over
The crystal blinks red -- on, off
Yes, Logan
(turning to him blindly) 'm glad they didn't change your face
Logan embraces her, but his look is strange and remote
They continue down into the darkness
Behind them the  of Love Shop die away and only their footsteps are heard
187 187X1 At the mirrored archway, looking around carefully, testing
He knows they went through somehow
Hands claw at him - he brushes them away as he searches
188-200 200X1 They have come to the foot of the stair
Here the flooring shines wetly in the darkness
(softly) Exactly four steps now
Let me lead you
(they walk) Now to the right
It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me
(whispering) How will they know we're coming
(whispering) They're watching us now
They'll let us in when they're sure
200X2	- - '  () As he fumbles the transceiver switches at his belt, punching out a signal
200X3
- As the Sandmen monitoring     and move smoothly into action
200X4 Close together, he behind, waiting--alert as a  is suddenly heard: (scratchy, filtered) Sandman, put your hands on your head
(he does) Clasp your fingers together
Now turn your hands over
Palms up
(beat) In a moment a light will shine in your eyes
Walk into it--Jessica first, then you, Sandman
You will have to stoop--but don't unclasp your hands
Do you agree
Logan nods
Jessica glances back at him but their faces are unreadable in the dark
Then suddenly--in front of her--a blindingly bright, narrow rectangle of light illuminating them fiercely
Jessica moves forward
Even she has to stoop
Logan is close behind
As he bends awkwardly into the opening, the light goes out
201		,  -- As he pushes her through the opening then moves instantly to the side, pulling her with him
The move fails
Both are pinned helplessly in the blinding glare of the spotlight and the sudden appearance of glass-silver spear points pressed against them
Logan is unable to draw his gun
Hold still, Sandman, or die where you are
2ND Is she the one
(like angry stage whispers) She betrayed us
Kill him
Kill them both
Jessica you sold us
Sandman butcher
Sandman murderer
Logan and Jessica stand rigid against the spear points, only their heads turning to the echoing sibilants
The spotlight goes off
202-204 205
-
- ,  - In the darkness we see the glass-silver spear points are glowing all around them, the long shafts falling away into darkness, the points, steaming gently when they touch--making an instant, wincing burn
Logan moves--a spear point presses--he flinches
'm a runner
She brought me here because begged her to help me
He turns his palm
The red crystal blinks impressively in the darkness
At the sight, a  of
Argument
He's lying
No Sandman ever ran
2ND You don't run
You kill runners
You have killed runners all your life
- Yes  have
(beat) Now it's my turn
And  want to live
Another angry murmur of
Over it Jessica suddenly: (shouting) What's the matter with you
He's a runner-- he's blinking
We must help anyone who asks
we must-or we're the same as they are--deciding who lives and dies
One of the points lifts and touches Jessica's cheek
quick, fierce burn
She shrieks--a tiny sound--and is silent
206 Reacts fiercely, spinning against the spear points, he is Jabbed and pierced in a dozen places as he manages to get Jessica closer, shielding her with his body
But the spear points are too much
He subsides, as  rise angrily "Kill him now"
Suddenly a
All sound stops at once and we hear a of  down the iron stair and across the outer floor
The spotlight bursts on again and a figure staggers into the chamber, straightening into the light, hair dishevelled, hands in front against the glare
It's Holly
Holly
Holly, New You 483
He's dead
Doc's dead and the Sandmen came
(gentle) Holly--Holly
Remember the code
The code, please Holly
(hysteria) They smashed everything and  barely got away
(beat) Holly
Station 12, Sanctuary 7
Holly
Holly
She lowers her hands and we see her, tattered, frightened--the bright smile strange
She comes to herself a bit, looks to the side and sees Logan and Jessica, pinned against the wall
She reacts with fear at the sight
It's him
The first Sandman
He killed
Doc
No, Holly--wait
He's running
Tell them the rest
(suddenly exhausted) He's the one
You too
remember
He was in a hurry
Just a face job
Dark hair,  said
Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me--and the machine blew up and  ran
ran Holly
Holly
Please
The other Sandman
Remember the one who came after-- Holly suddenly remembers and the shock makes her lucid
(pouring it out) That's right
The other one came after
The older one
Smashing, killing, burning
(coaching desperately) and he was hunting the first one, this one
Wasn't he
Wasn't he
This one was running, the other one was hunting him
(remembers) Yes
Oh yes
(to Logan) He was after you
remember
You're running
207-208 208X1	  1 The spear points are withdrawn
Logan and Jessica relieved but shaken, wary
May we move
long beat
Then-- saw we pass them through
Somebody help Holly
Other  mumble agreement
Holly moves off into the dark room, hands reaching out to help her
You two
Just go straight ahead
Follow the corridors with the pipes overhead to the end
Then use the key
As the voice speaks the spotlight finally goes off and by a dim glow around the perimeter, we see we're in some kind of large underground chamber--some part of the vast undercellars of the city
The light is enough to reveal that there are perhaps twenty people in the room, reds and greens both--but all are silhouetted, no face seen
There's a kind of aisle open down the room's center and it's obviously the way they are to go
Logan and Jessica move off
Logan pauses
don't know who you are
'd like to thank someone
It doesn't matter who we are
Follow the tunnel to the end
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there
murmur of discussion then: Someone will follow
When you come to the lock, he will tell you how Co go on the other side
Jessica may go with you as far as the lock
(a deep breath) No
Jessica goes back now
Take her back
(suddenly his tone is urgent as he speaks to her) Now
Go on back
Back outside, Jessica
She is bewildered by the change
Why
- No
no
'm going with you
VOICE1 Only to the lock
After that there's no way back
(small voice) don't care
'm going to Sanctuary
With you
of
"Impossible"
She ignores, watches Logan
(cont'd) Will you take me with you
Why, Jessica
You're still a green
shakes her head
She doesn't know why
Logan puts his arm around her, marveling, trying to understand, moved
But suddenly he remembers the urgency of the moment
He wheels, pulling her with him
Come on then--they'll be here any minute
Uncomprehending, she starts to run with him
Too late
An shakes the chamber--the wall bellies inward and a group of Sandmen, led by Francis, burst into the room, firing as they come
Panic
Turmoil
running, --the   , as Sandmen methodically slaughter the people in the wreckage of the room
209 209X1 As the brief, one-sided battle rages, echoing  and  in the dust filled room, Logan pulls her down out of the way
They watch, helplessly
Suddenly the figure of a Sandman looms before them
He stares at Logan, unsure
Logan reacts, draws, fires
The Sandman is smashed away, burning
209X2 Suddenly aware that he has killed a Sandman
Jessica pulls him down again into the shadow
Neither realizes chat the soft pulsing of his crystal can be seen from the room
210 Francis, quartering the room like a hound, searching, searching, stopping as he sees 211
The crystal blinking red, eerie in the darkness
(believing the blinking crystal is Jessica's) Logan
know you're in here
What've you done
gone crazy over a Runner
(whispering) Nobody knows except me
You know won't say anything
should have turned you in but  couldn't
Leave her
Come on out with me
It'll look like you're part of the group that hit this nest
(pleading) Logan
you're a Sandman
(slightest beat) Logan
now
now
Logan
After the slightest beat, Logan  and Francis falls, a great chunk of the cave roof falling between him and Logan -- all vision obscured while  and  continue
212 As he pulls her shakily to her feet
She nods, she's okay
He leads her off down the tunnel
213		    - following the tracks
The way leads down, curves, recurves, but always down
214		  - As Logan and Jessica rush toward it
The corridor has widened into a kind of chamber which ends in a great metal door like an immense submarine hatch
The tracks run straight to it and beneath it
The base of the door tands in a couple of inches of water
With great urgency, Logan and Jessica examine the huge door
Logan gives the wheel a tug
nothing
:   like clockwork
and then a Runner, this is the last gate
Use your key now
When the Bell sounds again
use your key
Good luck, Runner
May you find Sanctuary
Then the    and a light illumines the center of the wheel where there's a kind of keyhole
The  continues for about ten seconds
Then it stops	and the light goes out
214X1 Hearing a  they turn and see: 214X2	  -
Far behind them, in the wet glisten of the tunnel, a bobbing light and shadow -- the  of 215-216	  - As Jessica takes the ankh from her neck - fumbling with the chain
(breathlessly) Every key only works once
and only a Lastday key must open this door
They said it would fit - but
She tries to fit the ankh into the glowing one, but her hand shakes
Logan tries to steady her - and in helping, she drops it into the dark pool of water
They fall to their knees, searching desperately
Then Logan remembers
Wait -  have the one  took from the Runner
: The same as before as Logan searches his pockets for the Runner's ankh
Logan finds it just as the   has  again
and the light has gone out again in the center of the wheel
As Logan and Jessica wait for the sound, etcetera to repeat again another   is heard rocking everything
In the distance, Jessica can see the shadow of a  approaching
As the , etcetera, repeat-s once more
Logan pushes the ankh into the lighted center of the wheel
The ankh fuses and the lighted center becomes brighter as the door opens
There is a hesitation
in which Logan turning his head back
realizes what he has done and is shaken
As the shadowed  looms : There's no turning back, is there
Logan turns and pushes Jessica through the door
following her
as the door closes and they are: 217 now, they can still hear the , etcetera for the last time
Beyond the lock is the ruins of a vast undersea complex in which food was raised and harvested
What we see is an endless shadowy labyrinth of breeding pens which stretch off into the green darkness -- a kind of mammoth aquarium with catwalks and ramps intersecting the huge tanks
The levels are multiple and everything is slimed, rusted, rotted and wet
In the tanks themselves are shoals of fish, gardens of seaweed, etc
The machinery for harvesting and winnowing has long since gone to rust -- and visible in the great tanks are the wrecks of vessels and gear -- the kind of stuff Cousteau and Co
are using now
Footing is dangerous -- a slip from any catwalk means a plunge into water and some of the walkways are well under water anyhow
From an invisible ceiling comes a steady dripping and everything is crusted and smells of salt and decay and life in the darkness
217X1 As he arrives at the door, the ankh glowing as before
But Francis has a light
He examines the door with it, and as it lights the pool of water on the ground, it picks out Jessica's ankh
stoops, gets it and looks from it to the one glowing 128 Bewildered -- uncertain, as their eyes adjust to the dim light
Finally, Logan gestures ''this way" and sets out
(: The action of the sequence is the action of people groping through a labyrinth
They go along, gripping a rail where possible, sometimes sinking deep into water, sometimes rising above it
They run into blind endings and retrace to the last junction -- always trying for what looks driest and seems to stretch farthest along the great wall
) 219-224	    - Making their way along the walkway side by side
Stopping as the walkway disappears under water
Logan wading in while she waits -- until he re-emerges
She follows
Choosing between diverging ramps
Having to return
How do we know this is the right way
It's the only way
an alley way full of machinery
Logan gives a wheel a half turn -- great rusty net-combs start to winnow the water
Helping Jessica, Logan slips
falls into darkness
Jessica's fear until he emerges, hand over slimy hand
The water is cold
ancient signs -
#11
They speculate
What do you suppose this was
Some kind of breeding pens suppose
They say people used to breed animal s, fish, anything (at her disbelieving look) To eat, of course
Ycch
(shudders) To kill things and then eat them
It must have been a savage world
Logan shrugs, but the idea makes him queasy, too
They stop, tired
Peer through at the wreckage of a small inspection vessel and suddenly hear: : , coming, halting,  sloshing
Steps again
225		 -      - moving, hunting
(alert) Stay here, while  see what it is
Jessica nods, frightened
Logan slips off into the darkness
In a moment he's back
His face - is grim
It's Francis, isn't it
He nods
226 Trying to move faster now, Logan makes a wrong turning and they must go back
But as they do so, Francis is ever closer -- a gigantic distorted  now visible through the eerie glass -then suddenly seeming small and distant
As they emerge from the blind alley once again close to the wall, suddenly: 227 looming huge, gun drawn, apparently only a few feet away
228 Logan desperately claws at machinery, succeeds in starting motion, somewhere what sounds like a  begins laboring, ancient machinery
They turn and run as they : (distorted; echo; etcetera) 229		 - ' is splashing the walls ahead and in it they suddenly see: -- a waterlock with a wheel
As the light passes, Logan heaves desperately on it
It starts to give as the light comes back and they are revealed
230		 - aiming at Logan
then slowly moving his hand until Jessica is in his sights
231		 -  - Francis  -- tremendous ,  and
One of the great tanks buckles and a cascade of water erupts over everything
Through it, Logan manages to get the door open and pushes a half-drowning Jessica through
232
- sort of ancient freight elevator which commences to move groaning when the waterlock door closes
Logan slumps to the floor
233
-  -   - Moving at an extremely high speed
We can see the outside - flickering - dark, light, - dark, light
and finally to a white color
They lie slumped, motionless
Finally it stops
The door opens into a kind of glistening darkness, suffused by a bluish glow
It is now very cold
In the silence Logan stirs
Groping, he touches Jessica, who moves close to him
Logan puts his arm around her and they rise
Slowly, tentatively, he leads her out into the dark chamber where they stand for a moment trying to find themselves
What little light there is seems to come from the left
Arm around Jessica, Logan starts to move
(whispering) 'm afraid
It's brighter there
besides, we can't go back
He starts to move again but Jessica hangs back
Wait
He halts
(cont'd) don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but -- (a beat) Are you glad you didn't kill him
It doesn't make any difference anymore
You're really one of us now, aren't you
You knew that  wasn't before, didn't you
(Jessica nods) Why did you stay with me
(feelingly) wanted to
(Logan puts his arms around her) And you
what made you kill Sandmen
had to
did kill
for the first time in my life  killed
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you
guess so
know  felt something never felt before
and  didn't like it
not a bit
(after another long beat) 'll tell you one thing
Sanctuary better be worth it
That's the last place for me to live now
For us
Logan mouths "Us"
a strange word
and why not
in the last minutes he has done strange things
234-236 236x1
- Suddenly they are blinded by a brilliant light coming from the side and revealing for the first time where they are
236x2 Before them a vase, dim, ice-shrouded storage area, row upon endless row of frozen lockers trailing away into darkness, their legends and contents unreadable in the thick covering of ice and frost
To the side, a bright light
236x3 Walk toward the light
236x4 We see a huge, high-domed cavern ringed and ornamented with extraordinary ice sculptures-They are everywhere: Otters, fish, a tusked walrus---overhead a flight of birds
236x5 As they look in wonder: Overwhelming, isn't it
Logan and Jessica turn and see: 237-238 239		  - Box is half-man
half-metal
From the midpoint of his sternum to his hips he is coils and cables
One hand is a cutting tool
His head is half-flesh
half-metal
his legs are a chrome pedestal
Are you too startled
Am  too removed from your ken
(slightest beat) 'm neither machine nor man
but a perfect fusion of the two
and better than either
(with great pride) No human sculptor could match this greatness
don't you agree
All right - what are you
(laughs) Your turn
It's incredibly beautiful
Ah, but wait for the winds
Then my birds sing
My walrus breathes
My palace chimes and bells
And the deep grottoes whisper my name
Box Box
Bahhhhxxxxsss
(after a beat) We're hungry	do you have anything to eat
Anything to eat
Box starts to laugh
He is roaring with laughter as: (quietly) We're human and we're hungry
(still laughing) know
know
This place is a link to Sanctuary, isn't it
Box looks totally confused
(angrily) How do you think we got here
You walked in
saw you
Don't you remember
Logan contains his anger
(beginning again; quietly) Where do you think we came from
From
From
From
We were sent here and you know it
Others have been sent here
Where are they
Hiding
Box looks around the cavern: (mischievously) Hiding
Yes
Hiding, hiding
Where do we go
(up a notch) Where do we go from here
We hear a  outside
Is that the wind
(smiling) Not yet
(slightest beat) You must hear my birds sing
You know about Sanctuary
know you do
You have to help us
You don't have a choice
It isn't your decision
Tell us
Never a pair
have never had a pair
Where do you send them
You're a beautiful pair
Please
've never seen humans whom  thought worthy of being here
(a beat) 'd like to sculpt you
(looking around) Where would  put you
(smiling) know
you'd be the base of the column
You'd hold up my world
(exasperated) Answer the question
Do you know how long all this will last
Not thirty years
or thirty thousand years
but thirty thousand thousand years
and you'll be part of it
Ages will roll
Ages
And you'll be here
the two of you
eternally frozen
frozen
beautiful
(to Jessica) There must be somebody else up here
can't believe that he's-- (interrupting; his voice tone changing; very lucid) Let me sculpt you and  will show you where the others have gone
That's better
(slightest beat) How do you want us
Nude
Imagine, a pair
(starting to take off his clothes; as Jessica hesitates, Logan smiles) It'll be all right
240-241 Undresses
Box motions to a pedestal covered with deep white furs
Up there
Logan helps Jessica up to the pedestal
As they stand there: How do you want us
(beat) Up there
Logan looks at Jessica
Her beauty is glowing in the lamplight
Logan takes Jessica into his arms
Enchanting
Is that what humans do
By this time, Logan and Jessica are no longer listening to Box
their arms are enveloping one another
with strong feelings
' Superb
242		  - As his metal hand begins to
he brings it to the base of the huge column supporting the cavern
As he works furiously
at Incredible speed: 243 oblivious to Box
their feelings intensifying as they continue to hold one another
244-245 246		 - (stepping back) Done
behold
247		  - Before they turn to view the sculpture they kiss long and passionately
Their mood is broken by: ' Done
Done
Done
Logan and Jessica break
They turn and see: 248		  - Box has captured them perfectly
shimmering with life
filled with emotion
249		  -  , There are tears in Jessica's eyes as she reacts to the sculpture
(squeezing Logan's hand) It's glorious Logan helps Jessica off the pedestal and they both start to dress
All right
Now you keep your bargain
(rapt by his work) Wait for the wind
Wait and hear the birds sing over you
(only interested in getting out) We're ready
Box mumbles as he leads Logan and Jessica toward the rear of the Ice Cavern
250
- As Box enters followed by Logan and Jessica
This room has a fairly low ceiling and it is not too wide
It stretches back as far as the eye can see
The ice along the left wall is frosted
but the ice along the right wall is perfectly clear
And embedded in the ice along the perfectly clear right wall are: 251		  - Standing in erect positions
At first it appears that they might be more of Box's perfect works of sculpture
But as Logan and Jessica examine them closely through the clear ice
it is soon apparent that they are real people
who have been frozen
252 Horrified as they move slowly along the wall
253		  - We can see that each of them has a black crystal flower in the palm of their right hands
Logan walks to the end of this wall
Each frozen body has a number above it
The final body's number is 1056
That number which the voice in Sandman's headquarters revealed as the number of missing Runners
The   Logan back to Box
254		  - As Logan turns toward him
(stupefied) How did they get in here
Regular storage procedure
the same as the other food
The other food stopped coming and they started
What other food
Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea
(pointing to the frosted ice wall) It's all here - ready - fresh as harvest day
Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea
And then it stopped coming and they (gesture) came instead
So  store them here
'm ready
And you're ready
It's my Job - protein, plankton, grass from the sea Logan pulls out his gun
Tell us how to get out
or I1ll destroy you
'll kill you
Box laughs
The same ,   we  earlier
Then: (calmly) Such a beautiful pair
'll stand you facing one another
Box starts his saw hand
He turns all the flesh parts of his body away from Logan and starts advancing toward him and Jessica who is now standing behind Logan
Box is now like an armed vehicle
Logan
the fire reflecting harmlessly off Box's metal frame
(advancing) Resign yourself
255
- Retreating
as Logan  again and again
to no avail
As Logan and Jessica retreat further and further toward the rear of this room and: 256		  - Advancing We can
embedded in the clear wall of ice
strange mute audience to this to-the-death drama
257		  - Finally reaching the rear wall of this room as: 258		  - Relentlessly moving toward them
259		  - Seemingly pinned back against the rear wall
Logan is  his gun futilely with his right hand
while moving his empty hand against the rear wall
trying to find a knob or button which might open it
The entire time he never takes his eyes off: 260		  - Getting closer
The saw is
(chilling tone) make such a small, quick incision
you can hardly feel it
261		  - Against the rear wall
We can
but they cannot
that above them
on the ceiling
there are a number of exposed cables
262		  - , Box is practically upon them
As he lunges forward with his saw hand Logan pushes Jessica to the floor and drops down alongside her
Box cannot stop his forward thrust and cuts a sizable chunk of ice out of the rear wall as: Logan  at Box from the floor Level
upwards
trying to penetrate some part of his seemingly impregnable body
He misses but hits the exposed cables on the ceiling
There is an
(looking up; screaming) No
The coils
Box rushes past Logan and Jessica toward the huge ice cavern containing his sculptures
(still screaming) All my work
' All my work
As Logan and Jessica stand: 263-270 270x1	 - Bursting open, discharging great streams of gases
270x2 Seeing the effect, shooting again and again at the ceiling and walls
270x3 Coils bursting everywhere, vapor billowing into the cavern
270x4 Huge slabs of ice instantly loosening, crashing over
270x5 the effect multiplies--Ln the hissing vapor-sculptures crashing over and enormous chunks of ice loosened and crashing
270x6 Careening around wildly in the growing ruin, as the lights dim and flicker out
270X7 The ceiling full of birds loosening, crashing down upon Box
Again and again like great spears and wedges 270X8 Buried in his work, still feebly moving, then still as the roaring ice crashes down, in the terrible darkness
270X9 Cowering in the crashing maelstrom of ice blocks--saved only by Being in an angle of the cave
270X10 The  blotted out by the cave-in, going out of focus
Silence
Then: : Ice melting, water running
270X11 Stir in the dimness, amazed to be alive
:  heavy crash and splash as another huge ice block falls into the water
As it falls, the cave is suddenly illuminated again
They look and see the light is coming from a great fissure in the wall--opened by the last ice fall
Water rains across the opening
Logan and Jessica make their way to it, step out
271-272 273
- Water is pouring down in a waterfall from the icemelt
They are blinded by: 274		: As Logan and Jessica shield their eyes
then realizing that the dazzling light will not go away: Standing together
in fear of the sunrise
Is there something on fire
Logan shakes his head
he doesn't know
As Logan looks up at the sun
It seems to be moving away
Come on
274X1	 - clambering cautiously down from the barren ledge
274X2	 - Suddenly, a    starts blowing
(frightened) What's that
It feels like breath
It makes everything move
Your hair is moving
(smiling) And yours
They reach the level below and pause, look around
Jessica -- we must be outside
She looks at him, uncertainly, he puts an arm around her and they set out again
275-276 276X1
-  - Picking his way through the ruined cave, puzzled
277-287X1 288
- As Logan and Jessica reach it
They are startled by the  of   for a moment
then continue through some high grass and thorned bushes being scratched, etcetera
swarm of insects attack
Logan and Jessica fight them off: (starting to panic) hate outside
hate it
(holding her; comforting tone) We'll be all right
(a beat) We will
The sun is starting to go down
as they see a rabbit dart away in the grass
startling them for a moment
288XA1 Coming out through the fissure in the rock, squinting at the unexpected light from the sky, then setting out as Logan and Jessica did
288XB1	    - They come upon bushes of berries
Logan picks a few, looks at them and smells them
As he is about to put them in his mouth
Jesslca grabs hold of his hand
Don't
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something Logan eats the berries
as Jessica watches intently
After a beat They're good
Logan and Jessica pick berries and eat
When they are finished: It's getting dark and cold
'm tired
Why don't we rest here
We know we can eat these
They sit on the ground
: 288X1	  -    - Sitting on the ground
Jessica is shivering
Logan has his arms around her trying to keep her warm
Where do you think that heat-ball went
Logan shrugs
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice
doubt it
Don't ever let go
won't
After a long beat: It all seemed to make sense until Box
Do you think he was telling the Truth
Logan shrugs
(trying to convince herself) Maybe we're the first ones to get through
(hopeful tone) Maybe Sanctuary is near, now
another protected place
It couldn't be outside
(grunts) How would anyone know
Even if we find it -- we can never go back
At her stricken look
Logan touches her in a caring way
You're right
it must be near now
We'll find it
(yawning; closing her eyes; resting on his shoulder) Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they
288X2
-   -  - Looking frightened as he looks up at the moon and the stars his gun drawn
Suddenly, a rabbit darts by
Francis jumps up in great fear and starts  his gun
blasting the rabbit to smithereens
He is breathing hard (fear)
and looking around
gun in hand
288X3
-   -  - walking in the hot sun
grimy
thirsty
288X4
-   - His face still betrays a wild, frightened look as he moves very cautiously
He reaches the bushes of berries and sees some of them on the ground
He picks a few off the bush
is ravenous
but finally
too frightened that they might be some kind of poison to eat any
As he angrily crushes the berries in his hand
then wipes his hand on his trousers: 288X5
-   - Seeing shimmering in the distance
They walk toward it
288X6- 288X8 Reaching
289		  - They rush to it
drink
then undress
swim
and as they embrace in the water: Logan
Look
(Logan turns around) No
your palm
look
Logan looks at his palm
the blinking crystal is clear
He grabs Jessica's hand and looks at her palm
the same
(quietly) What does it mean
(trying to assimilate its meaning himself) The Lifeclocks have no power outside
Jessica takes Logan's palm and kisses it
(with laughter) You can have any woman in the city
What do you really want
(straight) You know, Jessica
(a beat) But  still have the choice
Of course
Then the answer's Yes
They embrace there in the water
290 291		  -   - Coming out of the forest
climbing up a green hilly area
reaching the top and seeing: 292-301 301X1	  - ,
- The monument rising up out of a tangle of forest -- other buildings gleaming, half hidden
In the foreground Logan and Jessica walk toward monument
301X2 Walking toward  to edge of swamp they stop and look at: 301X3	  -   - ( ) 301X4 Exiting   toward Memorial 301X5
-  -    - ( ) Climbing steps of memorial toward statue
301X6
-   -    - ( ) Logan and Jessica walking up steps toward
They pass between two columns and   right
301X7
-   ( ) Logan and Jessica walk toward statue -
They stop and look up
301X8	 - Looking up at statue
301X9	  :     ( ) 301X10	 - Looking up at statue
have never seen a face like that before
It must be the look of great age
Whoever he was he was terribly old
(beat) Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad---
Logan shrugs
They turn, start to  from memorial
301X11
-  -    ' ( ) Logan and Jessica
301X12 301X13	    - ( ) They walk through pond toward capitol
301X14	 -
( )	301X14 ( 2) Logan and Jessica walking past gravestones
301X15	  '  - 	301X15 301X16	 - As they pass the stones, Logan glances at them
They all have names and numbers on them
wonder what they are
"Beloved Husband"
"Beloved Wife"
What can all that mean
Just then their attention is focused by a distant  as of -- a man's voice
Jessica stops
Francis
Logan shakes his head
They  cemetery toward capitol
301X17	  -  ( ) Logan and Jessica walking up steps toward building
301X18	  - Walking up the steps
many of which are cracked
They are proceeding with great caution
as they enter the Capitol Building
301X19
-   -   - ( ) Logan and Jessica enter the ancient room
They stop and look around
301X20	 - :   -- irregular
It stops after a bit
They walk to the door and open it cautiously
They  right
301X21
- Logan and Jessica walking down corridor, left to right
The  continues
301X22
- Logan and Jessica as Logan opens the aged door
301X22A	 - 301X23	 - React, then they enter Senate and stop and look
301X24
-  -    '  - - There are
and    all over the place
(frowning; whispering) Look at his face
and his hair
(grimacing) Is that what it is to grow old
(still stunned) It could be
There are a    on the man's lap as he turns and faces Logan and Jessica
when he  them move closer
The man is stroking the cats calmly
unperturbed by the appearance of Logan and Jessica
How old are you
As old as  am  suppose
who knows
Your hair is white
It wasn't always
remember when it wasn't
But it wasn't your color either
(looking at Jessica) or yours
have my color somewhere
Those cracks in your face
do they hurt
Oh, no
Could  touch them
Oh, my
please try
Jessica walks up to the man and touches his face
What's your name
've forgotten
It's been so long since 've used it
Logan and Jessica exchange a quick glance
feeling they have come upon a nutsy, fruitsy cupcake
But all of my cats have names
Is that what they're called-- cats
Yes, cats, of course
What else could they be
Cats
Of course each one has his own name too
But there are so many of them
Do you know each one separately
Yes indeed, everyone
Actually, they all have three
(reciting) "The naming of cats is a difficult matter
It isn't just one of your holiday games
You may think at first 'm mad as a hatter when tell you a cat must have " (a beat) An ordinary name and a fancy name
That's two
Do you want to guess what the third one is
Logan and Jessica are silent
(reciting again) "But above and beyond there's still one name left over, And that is the name that you never will guess; The name that no human research can discover -- - But    , and will never confess
" (reaching down and stroking another cat) Will you, my pet
One of the cats jumps off his lap
(reciting) "Why did you go little fourpaws
You forgot to shut your big eyes
" (the man closes his eyes for a moment; then:) " have a Gumble Cat in mind
" As the man opens his eyes: How long have you been living here
For as long as  can remember
What kind of place is this
Just a place,  suppose
who knows
The man looks puzzled
How did you get here
have always been here
Are there any other humans
Gracious
no
Have any other people ever passed through
The man shakes his head
then: But there may be a few around somewhere
What makes you think so
My parents thought so
Mother and Father
You know
(astonished) Mother and --
You knew your mother and father
The man nods
And
and how were you grown
Inside your mother
Yes
Are you sure
Mother and Father said so
you know
Where are they
Dead
they're dead
and buried
(not knowing what it is) Buried
Logan wheels
as he as it opens a bit wider: 302 Coming through the opening - did he push it
303 (pleased; reciting) "Gus is the cat at the theatre door
His name, as  ought to have told you before, Is really Asparagus
That's such a fuss To pronounce, that we usually call him just Gus
" 306		  - May  see your hand again
Logan and Jessica extend their left hands
The Old Man takes them, looks from one to another with delight
They're beautiful
May  have one too please
No--'m sorry
It's not possible
(offended) It isn't fair
'll give you one of my favorite cats
a Jellicle cat
(reciting) "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise
" 'm sorry but  don't have anything to give you
As the man continues to look petulant: (simply; sincerely) That's the truth
Jessica takes off a ring and hands it to the man
Here you can have this
The man seems pleased
What kind of jewel is this
don't know
You're both full of secrets like Macavity
(looking at the ring) Did you steal this
No
(reciting) "Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity
" What's beyond this place - do you know
No, no, no Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place
Never, never, ever
Nothing
After a pause: May we stay here for a while
We'd like to rest
Of course you can stay
This belongs to the people
What belongs to the people
All this
All of it
What people
don't know
but it does
The man stands
and starts walking toward a door to an adjoining room
'll be right back
(stopping) Oh, yes
about the cats
one rule is true: (reciting) "Don't speak till you are spoken to
" The man smiles and leaves
305 Logan clears two chairs of cats and they sit down
Jessica picks up a book and starts leafing through it
Logan is deep in thought
Jessica looks up from the book
(quietly) How curious people used to be -- All these books
Silence
until: That sweet madman -- how could he Come to exist
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them
One in a million,  suppose (together; smiling) Who knows
(after a beat) We're going on, aren't we
(shaking his head) There's nothing to go on to, Jessica
Logan continues to shake his head through Jessica's following line: There's a Sanctuary
there is
You want there to be one
that Doesn't
(interrupting; urgent tone) There has to be
know it exists
It has to
(gently) No, there doesn't
Not really --just so many want it to exist
so many who don't want to die
want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real"
But it doesn't exist
It never existed
Just the hope
(becoming hysterical) You're wrong
It has to be
It Just has to be
As Logan takes her in his arms
comforting her: 306		  - The man returns with a portrait in hand
Oh, my don't cry
The man proudly shows them the portrait
which is a portrait of himself in his twenties
He sort of brushes the hair
which is rich auburn
(gesturing) There are larger pictures of other people over there
don't know who they are
Perhaps they're family
She man leads Logan across the chamber to a far corner
307		  - Remaining near the podium
She is dejected
Logan's argument that there is no Sanctuary has sunk in and taken hold
308 308x1	  - We see portraits of Presidents of the United States
We can recognize all of them
with the exception of the dozen or so that come after Ford
As Logan looks at the portraits he recognizes Lincoln
That's the same fellow who's outside
If he was so important - why isn't he first
The old man shakes his head
309		 -   -   - As Francis suddenly appears alongside her
Jessica is terrified
speechless
Francis glances across the chamber, sees Logan
When he speaks, it is softly but urgently
What did you do to him
Jessica is silent
Francis' tone becomes increasingly sexual
Why
Why you
(grabbing her) Do you know you ruined him
Do you know that
Can you tell me why
Why you
(a beat) And now you've killed him, you know
Francis starts to tear off her clothes
obviously to rape
but his expression remains cold and without passion
(screaming) Logan
As she screams, Francis clamps a hand over her mouth and drags her 310 310x1 hears the scream, wheels -- sees nothing for a moment
311
- ' Here
Logan looks up
and we see Francis crouched behind the railing of the first row of the gallery
with his gun pointing down at Logan, holding the terrified Jessica with his other arm
(cheerfully) How nice
more company
(emotional; disjointed thoughts) We had such good times together
let you go
(frenzied) You didn't terminate a Runner and let you go
(a beat) She did this to us
How could you let her
An ordinary available
(with this he flings Jessica down and away
She lies there
stunned) And what about Logan-6 and Francis-8
(a tear in his eye) Why didn't you chink about them
(up a notch) There's over two hundred years of Sandmen's blood in you, Logan
and now you'll spill it for a stinking Runner
312		  - Holding up his right palm
Look at your palm, Francis
look
It's clear
Clear
313		  - Looking at his palm
shocked
dropping his gun
It falls on the Why did you do that
didn't do anything, Francis
They've made us believe that
(interrupting; wild) Why did you do that
Francis leaps from the gallery and falls on Logan
314		  - Scattering in all directions as: 315-319	   - In hand to hand combat punching
Kicking
wrestling 320		 : Jessica deeply disturbed
The man enjoying himself as if Logan and Francis were putting on a show for him
321-331	 - Francis manages to pick up a chair and smashes it down on Logan
As Logan slumps to the floor and Francis cries to follow through his advantage by crushing Logan's face with his foot: Logan grabs Francis' foot and twists it
sending Francis reeling backward
Standing, Logan grabs a table and hurls it at Francis
who ducks
Francis sees a steel flagpole (with an American flag that has sixty-one stars) and takes hold of it
Francis moves toward Logan
with the menacing steel flagpole in front of him
Logan is wary
watching every movement of the steel pole
Francis swings the steel pole twice
We can  the - as it cuts through the air
with Logan avoiding the blows
On the third swing
Logan grabs hold of the steel pole and swings around on it
kicking Francis in the chest
Francis lets go of the steel pole as he staggers backward
Francis and Logan look at one another for a brief anguished moment as Logan crashes the steel pole (which he is now holding) down on Francis' head
Francis crumbles to the floor
Feebly, he raises a hand toward Logan
Logan touches Francis' hand and Francis grasps his wrist, holding death off with the strong grip
(delirious) That was the right shot--Look out there, he's trying to break free Watch it, Logan, steady, now
His eyes focus briefly and he sees Logan's palm-the crystal shining clear and white
Francis is suddenly radiant
Logan
You renewed
And he is dead
: 332 The man walks over to Francis and bends down
Oh, my
he died
333		  - Rubbing his face with the palms of his hands
clearly upset
334		  - We1ll have to bury him
What1s that
They1re put into the ground so they can be visited by the living
Logan1s eyes are glistening with tears
The man starts out
I1ll make the arrangements
(softly) At least it1s over
Jessica1s words don1t help as Logan shakes his head
then: Are you ready to put him in
Not yet
All right
The man sits down
Gently, Logan lifts Francis1 body
trying to straighten him out from the slightly twisted position he assumed when he fell to the floor
After resting Francis1 body on the floor again
He cradles Francis1 head in his arms
: 335-338 339
-   -  -  - ' "Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night
" 339X1	  - As they look down at Francis' body
in the open grave
Jessica watches as Logan and the man start shoveling dirt into the grave
starting to fill it
339X2 quietly watching: : 339X3
-  - On Logan sleeping - Jessica and Old Man in a spirited but soft conversation in a far corner
As Logan wakes he hears: Of course
that's settled then
But just you remember your promise
We'll remember
But that's a long time off
She sees Logan awake and listening, crosses to him, smiling
Logan rises to her
What are we promising him
What can we possibly give him
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes
(beat) We can't
We're going back
To what
'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and-- (interrupting) You're lying
You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything
You'll be killed the moment you're seen
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them
Things won't change
you know that
We can live here together, Logan
have a life as long as his
together
(showing his palm) Things change
You want to go back to kill, is that it
Now, you'll want to kill your own
kill Sandmen
Killing's all you ever
Logan shakes Jessica who is becoming hysterical
(softly) Jessica
listen to me
listen to me
(as she quiets down) The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis
They make people die or be killed every day
If  didn't try and destroy that
couldn't live here or anywhere
Do you understand
want to be alive and with you, that's all  want
Logan puts his arms around her
know
know
The Old Man comes to them, wondering
We're leaving
What a pity
was hoping you'd be here to bury me
Come with us
Where are you going
To a city with thousands and thousands of people
Alive
Logan nods
Thousands and thousands
as many as my cats
More
many more
And all alive you say
Logan nods
Yes,  would like to see that
Is it a long journey
Again, Logan nods
(mumbling) Thousands and thousands alive
oh, my
340-349 350		  -   -   - Logan, Jessica and the Old  are walking
with the Capitol Building blurred by overgrown foliage receding in the b
g
of the 351-361 361X1
-   - The Old Man has picked Some wild vegetables
and hands a piece to Logan and a piece to Jessica
As they hesitate
the Old Man bites into it
heartily
As Logan and Jessica start eating it, too: (marveling tone) Never see the sun or the moon
hope we get there soon
361X1A	 -   - On Logan, Jessica and the Old Man as they emerge from a small grove of trees and stand looking
past  Behind, a flicker of firelight
(weary but enthusiastic) Is that really it
It doesn't seem very far
Will we be there soon
promise
We '11 go on as soon as it's light
(gently, turning
away) But now 'm tired
Let's go back to the fire
They turn, the Old Man still marveling at the sight
(  ) (Matte) view of the domed city seen through a fringe of trees and beyond distance hills
361X1B
-   - As the three return to where a small fire is burning on the ground
That's better than gold when it's cold
Thank you
(turning to Old Man) Tell me - what do those words mean
"Beloved husband2
2Beloved son"
"Beloved wife"'
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife
"Beloved" is a word they used - to stay together
Stay
They lived together all their years
Oh, yes
think
(reading; moved) 3Beloved son2
(a beat) So people stayed together for that feeling of love
They would live and raise children together and be remembered
(another beat) think  feel that way, Logan
Can we be that way
(facing Jessica) Yes
You and , Jessica
(a beat) And Sanctuary
Sanctuary is the right to live
nothing more
But nothing less, either
There is a long beat
then Jessica snuggles up to Logan
she is ready for sleep
(whispering) Beloved husband
(kissing her) Beloved wife
361X2 361X3
-  -   - , Walking
361X4 361X5
-   -  - , As they walk the great glowing dome is visible in the distance
The Old Man marvels at what he sees
they walk on
362		,   -       - Walking up the beach toward the domed city
We get an idea of the scale
They appear as ants in front of redwood trees
363 364		, Approaching
The wave power inlet in f
g
They : As they approach cautiously
they see: 365 Waves pounding over
What does that water do
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system
The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow
Is it inside the city
Of course
(a beat) don't know where
(frowning) Just took them for granted
(Logan takes Jessica's hand) It's our only chance
The   ,  and the   down the until they reach: 366		  - At the  of this
After a beat Jessica looks at the Old Man: (softly) know
(after a beat; to the Old Man) We're going to try and get in this way
don't think you can make it
(sadly) Oh
did so look forward to seeing all those people
'm sorry
Yes
Can you make it back
Oh my
'll try
(kissing the Old Man) Goodbye
Oh, my
The Old Man watches Logan and Jessica dive into the  and disappear
367 he bends and plays with the water in the  for a moment
like a young child at a pond or lake
368
-      - Emerging from the water
It is a labyrinth of humming turbines, automonitored cables and impulse collectors
Logan leads her swiftly through the humming maze toward an exit
369- 369Xl 369AX2	  - As the  is pouring in: ' No
Don't go in there
The  turns and looks up at: 369X2 On a high balcony in the Great Hall
Looking down at them
You don't have to die
No one has to die at thirty
You don't have to blink out on Lastday
There's no renewal on Carrousel
You can live longer and grow old
've seen it
She's seen it
Believe me
There is an angry murmur in the  as Logan continues: (holding up his palm) See
it's' clear
The Lifeclocks are a lie - Carousel is a lie
369X3	  - Trying to grab Logan
There is a struggle
Some Sandmen are knocked over the railing
But remaining Sandmen fire a gas tranquilizer which subdues Logan and Jessica
The  cheers
and continues into Carousel as: 370
- It is the same area where Logan received the original assignment to find and destroy Sanctuary
In the rear
with the panel open
the sign reading: blinks on and off
Logan is dragged in by a number of
We see Jessica , too, still groggy, being held by  in the b
g
of the
Logan is placed on the chair in which his  was altered
371		  - shaft of light glows on and he stiffens - bound by it
372 372X1- 372X3	  - As around him in the air, a series of spectral greenish  appear -- one after the other -in response to questions
Each of these heads is Logan
Each revolves slowly on its axis as it responds
As the real Logan (in the chair) is questioned, each of the heads answers in turn
They are each a part of his persona and his brain
373-378 378X1- 378X18 - (Logan's voice) Jewelry store
Logan himself - twisting in pain
The word  appears on the
(Logan's voice) creature called Box - all frozen, all frozen
Logan writhes in the chair
Again the word  appears on the
(Logan's Voice) No
There is no Sanctuary
The  seems to shimmer
It blinks
third time the word negative appears on the
(Logan's voice) There is no Sanctuary The ' glow increases
to an almost blinding light
starting to frighten the Sandmen present
At the same time, we see  coming out of her tranquilized daze
fearful
still in the Sandmen's custody
(Logan's voice) An old man without a crystal
But there is no Sanctuary
Now the  is starting to spark
Behind it we  the intermittent glow of overheated electronic components
And we see the word negative
once more on the  -- but broken now
(Logan's voice) There is no Sanctuary
Now the noise and the light from the  are peaking
and we can see the increasing fear of the Sandmen
On the  the word negative is beginning to shake
as the begins to shake
379		  - '  (emanating from all of them) There is no Sanctuary
There is no Sanctuary
The sign  bursts
the   of Logan go out
The noise and the light coming out of the screen Increase, as it begins to burst into showers of sparks and flame
380-410 410X1	  - Straining twisting, as the light above him bursts, goes out in a puff of smoke -- releasing him
Logan staggers to his feet in time to meet: 410X2 Rushing in from the Ready Room to join the others who have closed in on Logan One holding Jessica
410X3 Manages to get one of the Sandmen's guns, instantly blasting him with it
In the noise and confusion, the fight becomes general Sandman fires back at Logan, misses -- the shot hits one of the Lifeclocks which flares electrically, ribboning out a great arc
Instantly Logan gets off a couple of shots at the other Lifeclocks which similarly flare and burst into violent electrical fire and discharges
410X4 The electrical discharges, smoke and noise making great confusion
Sandmen hampered by their own numbers and by trying to miss the machinery
Logan firing methodically at the Lifeclocks, moving
Stumbles over Jessica, prone in the smoke
Helps her to her feet
Crouched, they make for the exit
410X5	  - Sputtering its life out in strange predictive words flashing on and off etc
, flashing vainly through the eddying smoke and the fierce discharges which fill the great room
410X6 The battle is lost -- the smoke and noise overwhelming
They pick up their wounded and get out as best they can
410X7 Sandmen rushing out through the gathering smoke and the flare of fire behind them
410X8
Sandmen pouting out through smoke and fire effects
Pushing through passers-by herding everyone away from the scene
People getting the hell out of there
Ad Libs: Get away from here
The whole thing's going
410X9 Through the smoke, etc
The Lifeclocks
410X10
The building  -- great geyser of flame shooting upward
410X11 The sound of the explosion creates panic
Lights begin to flicker
The great red crystal lights fitfully on and off
People are panicking, running in different directions
Some pressing into Carrousel for safety
410X12 As people run in there, the red crystal glowing and sputtering, the petals moving spasmodically
As people look, the white crystal comes on, begins spinning wildly, bursting into strange, lancing lights great roaring commences and the whole arena starts to rock with the crystals
Now the white crystal explodes and the whole room is crisscrossed with deadly arcing discharges
People flee the scene of destruction
410X13 The panic is-full, people getting the hell out of there
410X14 People are stampeding like cattle, all heading down and for the exits, trampling  each other in their fright
410X15- X21 The City under the dome -- fitfully lit as the dome itself seems to be cracking strange electrical discharges emanating from it as from a gigantic line storm
The lights in Arcade flicker and go dim
The chandeliers in Arcade swaying, a couple falling onto the screaming panicky people
Maze-Car Station
People fighting to cram into cars
Car lights go out
People turn and bolt in another direction
Love Shop -- pandemonium as the drugged bodies clamber over each other in fear, struggling to get away
Great Hall emptying -- the signs of panic everywhere
The great crystal -- a wildly spluttering electrical fire wrecking it
410X22
-   - with above: 410X23 Making their way through Cathedral -- out the dazzle chamber, running
past Maze Car Station
410X24 Running past Power Center
411
-  - The dome of the city torn
Lightning effects playing on the stunned people
who look up and see the starry heavens, too, as they stumble forward into the darkness
wind begins to blow
where air had never stirred anything
There is a sense of wonder
Hysteria is lessening
as the people find themselves moving through the crack
as they discover the fact that the crystals have disappeared from their palms
Some are joyful
others frightened
others puzzled
as they emerge from the crack in the dome at: 412		  - We can still see the fires in the b

of the  as Logan holds on to Jessica
(like Gable onto Jeanette MacDonald at the end of )
full of happiness and hope for the future
people continue to mill all over the acres of strange stepped construction
we see the Old Man
Logan and Jessica run to him
He looks around
People start to gather
they have never seen a white-haired Old Man in their lives
As people continue to gather around the Old Man
who couldn't be more delighted
Logan and Jessica are smiling
inviting people to touch him
and some do
Yes, he is an old man
Yes, they will all live again to be old men and old women
Yes, this is the world renewing itself once again
