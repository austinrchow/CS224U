McClane, we don't need a loose cannon on this deck
What if they decide to crash another plane in retaliation for your little stunt
84 () 249  - 249 r,1 ( ) Last  heard, they can't do that again
And if  grabbed Esperanza, the situation would be over
Maybe they're more creative than you think
McClane, we're here to jerk off that cocksucker until he tries to take off - period
This time you're the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time
McClane stands, glares at the two officers
He flips away the cigarette, walks away, pissed

You said they showed up there right away

plot plans
These are the old plans when the longer runways went in
that's twelve years ago

And

You didn't do that - you did your - had a choice and  made it
But those cops didn't have a choice, and neither do those soldiers now

Pause
McClave   - 406  ' 406 it  , vanishes in the snowstorm
407  407 panting, he wedges himself against an engine pod - and starts to take off his jacket
408
408 Esperanza lights a cigar - and then
- 109 () 108  - 408 What
The aerilons
Something's wrong -we can't take off - He looks out the window - and  to - 409   -   409 Hydraulics  because McClane is  his  into the groove where it hinges
410    410 They can't fucking believe this
Then - ( ) i 'll do him
(following, to Esperanza) You just get us in the air, General
You're the only one who can do it
411
-  411 Stuart and Grant cock their weapons, move to the door
Grant opens it
412
412 , Grant stands there,  whipping him
- just the jacket,  in the groaning aerilon
Grant starts out -
McClane  from behind the door, him
Grant's gun  off the wing, falls to the ground rushing past below
413  413 in the doorway, tries to  - but 414    -     414 are  in the driving snow
415    415 Each      with one hand -  with the other - Grant   on McClane's face - but McClane doesn't   - he just  like a maniac -  Grant -pushes -pushes - 110 () r"1 415  - 415 - (through his teeth, as ) Too - bad - McClane - The  of metal  - a   in Grant's hand- (') ( ) really liked you - 416  416 too late, he realizes he's over the front edge of the wing
He screams and  - 417   417 There's an awful   - - McClane winces as     - 418    418 it could be hamburger pouring out - but before we can dwell on it, the engine pod
18A  -    418A wipes red snow from his arm
like you better dead
419    419 a "" indicator goes on
Esperanza hits "", handles it - increases power to the other engines
420  420 trying-to  - finally - a  of what has to be McClane -with a savage grin, Stuart takes off his rifle - discards the bulky coat - knife in hand, he steps out
421  421 moves hand over hand to a trailing section of the wing
Looks over and down at 422   -   -   422 -423    423 He reaches for it
Too far
Stretches
Gets it - fucker is Wincing, he  it a bit - then  up just in to  , knife whizzing  - 424   424 McClane , but the knife  his
In pain, he manances to  Stuart's  - Stuart , almost goes over the wing - McClane goes back to work on the fuel port -it, another 1/4 turn -and then he has to abandon it to deal with another  from Stuart
425  425 he  the
Now he's
426    426 for the knife
With
all his strength, McClane Stuart's knife hand the aerilon crack
The next  of the metal  both hand and knife
Stuart  and loosens his grip on McClane, who  him away, goes back to work on the fuel port
But he's hardly at it when Stuart , and, mangled hand held clawlike,  McClane's   - -blood on Stuart's shoe - McClane is being worked over the edge of the wing
He  at the last moment - now he Stuart's , because - 427    427 McClane feels for the fuel port - turn, turn - it
Fuel - McClane feels the wetness on his hand - 428   428 a  of  twists behind the moving plane, slick and light - 429    429 Stuart  on McClane's  on the wing -  - again - McClane  -and then Stuart
430  430 20 ,  into the snow at the edge of the runway, bounces like litter thrown from a moving car - the big almost rolls over him - 431  431 with a victorious  he  the coat from the aerilon, throws it away - heads for the door - 112 432  432 sees this, smiles - 433  -    433 crawls to a painful sitting position
Face impassive, he watches the jet move away
and - incongrous as it seems - he lights a cigarette, looks off at - () 434      434 running along the runway for 1/4 mile now - 435  435 battered like a car wreck victim, now he looks up into the dark sky trying to find the
Then he  - 436   '  -   436 careening down in a desperate fight, against gravity - 437    437 1 McClave takes a   on the cigarette until the tip is -
438  -      438 about to close it, he looks back and for the first time 439    -   439 winding endlessly down the runway - 440  440 Hey, Colonel: Happy Fucking New Year
And he
441  441 the flame    - turns to  to Esperanza - () 442  -   442 to the cry,   - () 442A   442A - - the wheels go into the  - () 113 () j j42B    442B But as the craft rises, so does the , climbing the fuel ribbon     and     which 442C  442C at the  in time for a    that and through the cockpit , and then he's 443  443 is     as a
, taking all the remaining soldiers with it and then 444   -   444 It  ,  and  and  going nine different directions
445  445 446  446 for the ground as the explosion
447    4471 they watch the  in the distance - 448  448 Gets to his knees, and  at the huge conflagration
(towards the sky) Honey
there's your landing lights
: 449
'  -  449 Blackness and driven  outside - and then - in an almost cinematic  - through the glass we  the -and, more importantly - the for almost a mile - line right along the runway
- Look -
The pilot grabs controls desperately, trims the plane - 114 450    - 450 The passengers  as they level a bit - : 451
451 It descends, a bit erratic, but now it's  the line of fire, coming in from the wrong end of the runway, and then the wheels , once, twice, and then a tire  but the pilots () as it  and finally    , turning onto () the grassy field
Already we
452    452 (listening to headset) One forty is down
They used the fire to see - () -they used the fucking fire to see
They can all do that - let's tell ' - They already know
Listen
And sure enough, there it is - the  of  - 453
-   453 And now the lights come down from the sky, in a neat and patient row, the closest-filling the screen, the others dwindling down to the size of stars
454  -    454 Stumbles along, maybe thinking he's dead or dreaming the giant    , ignoring the  beyond that - His concentration is totally on Holly's plane -now another giant   down behind him - it's an assembly line, like -29's coming home from war - then he  what he's praying for - breaks into a  - Holly -  -

She steps over him, puts her high heels back on - walks off

Sam and her cameraman hit the ground running
- 459    459 embracing - and then she's nursing his wounds, hearing his story- 460    460 The cameraman brings up his lens
God, that's beautiful - Yeah
It sure is
And she yanks out his power cord, watches it dreamily
461   -  461 as rolling stairs are put up to the planes and the passengers pour down the steps into arms of friends, families, loved ones
461A  461A Sets Holly down, kisses her - then both  at a
Marvin is there in an airport cart
He looks at the chaos
Damned if 'm cleaning up this mess
McClane and Holly get in the cart
Marvin drives them away, light
and we  until McClane and Holly are just part of the crowd
