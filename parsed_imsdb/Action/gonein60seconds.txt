href <b>// --> </b> Gone In 60 Seconds - Scott Rosenberg 60 by Scott Rosenberg 4/6/99 " wonder," Toad said to himself presently, " wonder if this sort of car starts easily
" Next moment, hardly knowing how it came about, he found that he had hold of the handle and was turning it
As the familiar sound broke forth, the old passion seized on Toad and completely mastered him, body and soul
He increased his pace, and as the car devoured the street, he was only conscious that he was Toad once more, Toad at his best and highest
And he sped he knew not whither, fulfilling his instincts, living his hour, reckless of what might come to him
" -- Kenneth Grahame, "    " "All the redemption  can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
" -- Bruce Springsteen, " " : -   - The streets are empty
Low fog skims the sidewalks below a gray stew of a sky
It's slightly fuzzy, slightly surreal
The vast Port of Los Angeles is visible in the b
g
No cars parked here
No cars except - '67   -500 Silver with deep grill, its sculptured side panels ending in air scoops
All cock and balls, it stands alone in the lonely cool before dawn
An old-school totem to speed and style
And then approaches
Through the mists of morning
In leather coat and jack boots
He's early 30s, with the vaguely whimsical confidence of a shimmer that refuses to fade
This is  , whom they call  - though know one's quite sure why
But they do know he's the auto-boost in Southern California
Memphis approaches the Mustang with a gathering awe
Like a desert crash survivor coming upon an oasis
He walks around it
Admiring it
Adoring it
But then a  pulls up alongside him
Its driver - , early 30s, handsome, jocular leans out for: You gonna steal her or kneel down to her and pray --
Memphis looks at him, still enthralled
(cont'd) know,  know
It's Eleanor
Just take her, slick
- - And Atley drives off slowly, Memphis looks this way and that
No one about
He removes a   from a deep pocket in his coat
He slims the door panel
Pops the button
opens the door
Watch him work
Quick as shit
appears another pocket
He pops the  to the appears
He strips the mechanism
Now a  - a,small socket-like device - is pressed into the ignition
twist of the wrist
And the 320-bhp 289 V8 rumbles like a jackhammer
The whole thing took 20 seconds
He takes a cassette  from another pocket
Slaps it into the deck
Bruce Springsteen's "Ramrod" wails from the coaxials
And Memphis floors it
And off they tear
The look on his face suggests a supreme satisfaction
grand re-awakening of long-dormant pleasure centers
speed Jones, fixed and fumy
He slots in behind Atley Jackson's Firebird
And slotting in behind Memphis, in a -28, is  , mid-30s
On they go
The fore and aft car providing escort
Except that, from seemingly out of nowhere -- appears behind them
And Donny instantly goes into diversionary tactic
He races through a
And the cruiser's bubbles flash on
And Donny is pulled-over
Atley and Memphis drive on in their respective vehicles
The   gets out of his car, goes to Donny
Problem, Officer
Yes
You're under arrest --
For running a stop sign
For Grand Theft Auto - And off of Donny's look -- We go to Memphis in the Shelby
As   comes speeding toward him, sirens wailing
of Memphis racing the Shelby through the early morning harbor town streets
Sirens peel
Memphis turns up the music Pins the gas
The chase is on
Memphis maneuvers the Mustang with a dazzling aplomb
Memphis gutterballing the car, skating the shoulder, the cops in heavy pursuit
And now he's picked up another
He passes Atley Jackson, heading in the opposite direction
Atley has picked-up a pair of cruisers himself
Memphis on a straightaway now, speeds up, feels the boost
But up ahead, a  has formed
How'd they get that deployed so fast
And behind him, the unmarks blaze
Guns his bitch
Straight at the roadblock
Three  and a
Memphis pins her
Dead-on to the roadblock
And, at the last moment, as the  dive out of the way, Memphis bangs the gear shift into neutral -- yanks the parking brake -- And the Mustang spins on the straight -- Screeching spin
And Memphis takes the
And he's managed to outrun them
Finding himself above Lower Grand
Looking down
He can see the secondary pursuit down below
Atley being chased
- Atley is    , the Firebird rolling down a drainage culvert
Landing with a sickening thud on its back
Memphis is horrified
- Rescue team presence
Atley being hauled out of the wreck
His leg is a torn mess
He's barely conscious
cuffed Donny Astricky is dragged to a waiting cruiser
pulls up
And out steps of
The Governor's Regional Auto-theft Bureau
Castlebeck is mid-50s, black, saturnine
- But don't let the tacit nobility fool you - the man's a street viper
Castlebeck goes to another cop -
Astricky
And Jackson
No sign of Raines
Well, then it's all for naught, ain't it, Hawkings
Castlebeck looks out over the mess
And then looks up
Because, further down Lower Grand, a car is parked
It is the Shelby
With Memphis leaning against its hood
Castlebeck looks around him, but no one's noticed
So he walks toward it, hand on hip
know you -- You know my back - You want to come along quiet
How's Atley --
Leg's all banged-up
He made a stupid play
He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom
But Astricky will be there to take care of him
With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce -- Let them go -- How's that
Let them go
And 'll leave
You'll leave --
You don't have anything on me misdee auto-theft
got no record
'll be out in three days, and back at it
Or you let them go, and  give you my word
'm gone
And without the ringleader
Your tee-times have just grown exponentially
don't golf
And they stare at each other, as Castlebeck considers
(cont'd) do this
And  see you again
'll come after you with everything  got
you won't be able to steal a glance at a blind man without me by your side
You have my word
Get out of here, then
Now
And Memphis makes to get into the Shelby
Leave the car, Randall
Memphis nods
Takes one last look at the Shelby
Sorry to leave it behind
And he runs off into the mists of Lower Grand
Castlebeck walks back toward the crime-scene tumult
Arright, let lim go
Cite him for rolling the stop
And cite old Atley for driving to endanger
What are you talking about, Rollie
We're springing 'em
Just like that
Just like that
Quit your bellyaching, Hawkings
And let's wrap this up
And off of Donny's surprised look, as Springsteen wails to crescendo and we : ,  -  - 6 Some 400 miles North of Los Angeles, Independence is a one horse town, and the horse has died
Single stop light, single-engine firehouse, single everything
Norman Rockwell would find this burg a snooze
- We settle on a small, The peeling sign reads: "
" owned and operated by Memphis Raines
In blue coveralls, Memphis has a Plymouth Duster up on the lift
With him is a kid - , 19
Lightnin' Hopkins' "Automobile Blues" plays through -- You know what you got here
Not really - There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit
You know what you gotta do --
Not really -- You have any other answers besides "not really"
Not -- Right
You want to test the voltage drop
Use the voltmeter
Remove the primary lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her
See what you got
You understand --
Tom starts to say "not really"
Instead, he nods
Memphis takes a root beer from an old-style machine
He goes out
front
To where an old Denver Pyle-coot -  - sits on a bench, smoking an unfiltered Lucky
Memphis sits beside him, pets the 200-year-old  that lounges nearby
Just can't find good help these days -- (re: cigarette) Those things'll kill ya, Budgy -- They won't have a chance
The bourbon and bacon'll get me first
Budgy cackles
Memphis looks out at the dusty little hamlet
Budgy points at a passing car
(cont'd) That one - 1980 Mercury Cougar
255 cubic inch V8
Based on the Ford Thunderbird bodyshell; they modified the chassis, but didn't improve its performance
Budgy points at another car
And we get the sense they play this game every day
(cont'd) The 1970 Plymouth Road Runner
Proof positive of a single all-powerful Deity
The first bargain-priced muscle car ever
They even tuned the horn to resemble the "beep beep" sound of the cartoon Road Runner
And Budgy looks impressed
As always
Damn, you're good Memphis nods
Sips his root beer
(cont'd) You got to bingo last night
Memphis looks at him
Can't believe it himself
That  did, Budgy
That  did -- And, from inside the garage, there's the most horrific  of metal on metal, as Tom has started the Plymouth - (
) Uh
Randall --
Excuse me -- Memphis goes back into the garage, Budgy cackles
: - - driving through the upscale streets of Palos Verdes
Three , 20, inside
The driver is , a little dim; in the back is  , black, always wears those mirrored shades
In the passenger seat is - Memphis' younger brother
The car pulls to a stop
Fancy stores - all of them closed - line this affluent business district
Freb consults a piece of paper
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia
Tumbler messed up
He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia -- He didn't mess up
There it is
And he points
To a   -
Twenty foot high glass - windows surround a  of : Porsches and Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Bertones
And- there it is, a 1996   V8, gleaming in the all-night showroom lights
Freb and Mirror Man are startled That --
You're shittin', right
Kip
He grins at them
He ain't shittin'
How are we supposed to-- Pop the trunk
need my tool
Freb scowls
Pops the trunk
Kip gets out
Goes to the back
Freb and Mirror Man share a spook -- What tool --
Kip reaches into the trunk
Comes around to them
He's carrying   -- (cont'd) Oh, no -- And Kip walks toward "Exotic Motors"
Calm and cool
Ten feet from it
He winds up
And Which   , a raining down
As Kip walks into the showroom, glass crunching underfoot
Freb and Mirror Man can't believe it -- Kip goes to the Lotus
With nary a glance around, he's got her open
The Lotus'  adds its song to the choir
Kip, unmindful, gets behind the wheel
Screwdriver to the mechanism
The alarm raging in here
In moments, the V8's massive 349bhp is bellowing
And Mirror Man climbs in beside him
And off they go
Laying several inches of English rubber
Over the broken glass and out of the showroom
-   - The Lotus races through these streets
At high speeds
Newsflash, Kip: you're driving a stolen car Kip smiles over the ascending speedometer -- Yeah
Ain't it great --
And he pins her
--
: being bounced against the wall
Caught
Bounced again
Thunk
Thunk
Thunk
-    - dozen purloined  are parked here
And a number of thuggish  reads the paper
The tennis ball bouncer is , 20
And he's sitting on a tilted back chair, and wall-bouncing the ball and annoying the piss out of whom we remember from the drop-car at our opening
Atley walks with a  now
Thunk
Thunk
Thunk
Can you stop that, for Chrissake
What's your problem, bro
Thunk
Thunk
Where are they --
They'll be here
You nervous, bro
You
Back in the day, they say you had anti-freeze in them veins
What happened --
And Atley intercepts the tennis ball
And hurls it over to the far side of the warehouse
Tumbler merely grins
(cont'd) Relax and enjoy -- - Heading for Long Beach
Stopped at a light
pulls up next to them
behind the wheel, a  beside him
Kip eyeballs them
Engines are revved
Challenges are implied
Mirror Man panics
Stolen car, Kip
Stolen car, stolen car, stolen car
Stolen fast car
And the light turns green
And he pops the clutch
And they are off
It's a good old fashioned drag race
Kip smiles at the blonde
Mirror Man is freaking out
Kip's eyes are on fire
He clocks the speedometer
(cont'd) It's calibrated for 140
Let's see if these British boys are full of shit or not -- No way, man -- Yes, way
Kip floors it
They bury the Camaro in its wake
The gauge rising
90, 100, 110
Mirror Man is having an embolism
They warp-speed by a
Both kids totally unaware of the   up on high
With them in its sights
And they drive
At last, ending up at -- -  dark latticework of docks and wharves, warehouses and shipping crates
The freighters are somehow graceful against the moonlit water
Tumbler studies his watch
Now he's a little concerned
He looks up
Atley is glaring at him
Something wrong, Tumbler --
Yeah
'm missing Springer -- And then the Lotus pulls into the warehouse
Tumbler flashes Atley a "told-you-so" smile
Kip and Mirror Man get out of the car
Kip walks over to a  with a magic marker tethered to it It is a list of cars
He draws a black line through "13) 1996 Lotus Esprit V8"
The others are clocking the car
She'll go 0 to 60 in 4
9 seconds -- can vouch for that
Tumbler passes out 40 oz
s
The vibe is celebratory
Thirteen down
Thirty-seven to go
No problem - Bottles are clinked
Beer is sipped
Only, a bores through the skylight
And the whup-whup of the chopper's
And now the sounds of
And the thuggish man gets to his feet
Let's get outta here --
And they do
Heading out the back
It's tough for Atley with his limp
On the way out: Now you gone and done it, Raines And they flee
-  - -
The  does the usual spotlight-trailing
It's turned into a total pig circus
car pulls to a stop
And out steps Detective Roland Castlebeck, whom we remember from our opening
Castlebeck surmises the take
The cars
His partner - a sneering Irish boy with zero patience - comes out from the back
They're gone
Castlebeck nods
Looks at the cars
"
" -  - Memphis goes through invoices in the cluttered back office
When a brand new purple  , windows tinted, pulls in out front
It looks oddly anachronistic here in Independence
Memphis senses danger
He goes out
Budgy and his dog are here
Budgy looks spooked
Tom, too
What's going on --
And standing there, by the Mercedes, like a wraith, is , in long leather coat, smoking a cigarette
As out of place here as a maggot on a muffin
Well, well, well
And he begins to sing
(cont'd) (  theme) Da-doo-doo-doo-da-doo-doo-doo, etc
(laughs) Are you kidding me, man --
Hello, Atley
(re: sign) get it
Clever
Memphis studies him
How's the leg
Only hurts when  breathe
Lookit you
Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out
And Opie
Where's Opie at
He laughs some more
Chain-lights his cig
What are you doing here
Is there someplace we can talk
Memphis looks at him
What about
About your brother
And the deeeep shit he's in -- '  - sets down a pitcher of beer and two mugs
There you go -- Thanks, Donna -- She leaves
Atley is staring at him
Memphis shrugs
It's been a long time, Memphis -- Six years
Six years
Shit
Time flies, don't it
Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal
Now look at us
Tell me about Kip - Atley takes a sip of his beer,
He took a job
And he fumbled it
Now he's jammed-up
Jammed-up bad
What kind of job
boost
big boost
boost
What's Kip doing on a boost
Atley frowns
Looks at him
You're shittin', right
Clearly Memphis is not
(cont'd) Kip's become quite the little crewrunner since you left
He's been working a low-rent ring for two years now
You don't talk to your Ma
It seems she neglected to mention it Maybe she don't know
Although  don't see how that could be
Maybe she didn't want to upset you - Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley
The point is: Kip's been living the life
Only he's a wild child
Crazy
Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time
But he fungold this one so bad, folks around
are already speakin' about him in the past tense
Memphis takes a beat
Sips at his brew
Then: Who was the job for
Who do you think
Memphis waits
In no mood for guessing games
(cont'd) Calitri, man
Raymond "The Carpenter" Calitri
Your favorite and mine
Which means nothing to us
Though the look on Memphis, face speaks volumes
(cont'd) just thought you should know, man
kind of had a feeling you didn't
But  should tell you: 'm working for him now - The Carpenter - so if you see him, you won't mention me coming to get you
Like  said:  just thought owed you
And that it was the right thing to do
Memphis nods
His face clenched in despair
We   , As a  on-screen reads:  1: We -
Geils Band's "Hard-Drivin' Man" and  : , placed on the service deck by a short-order
' - -   - 24-hour diner in the heart of Long Beach
The three plates are picked-up with an impressive dexterity by early 60s, clear-eyed
In pink Ruby's uniform and chunky shoes
Black currant hair striated with wisps of gray
Helen delivers the plates to a booth of college kids
Can  get some more coffee --
Sure, hon
And she goes to the coffee station
When (
) Who's a guy gotta know to get a tuna melt in this joint --
And she turns around to see Memphis standing there
Her expression displays many things
Most of them joy
(cont'd) Hello, Ma -- And she goes to Memphis
Wraps her arms around him
Squeezes tight
(cont'd) Oh, Randall
She takes his head in her hands
Kisses his cheek
Then the other
Hugs on
Unmindful of the customers
The cook smiles from behind the order wheel
What's the word, Memphis --
How ya doing, Ruby --
Come, come, come
And she leads him over to a booth
Barking to the cook -  - on the way
(cont'd) Tuna melt on pumpernickel
Provolone, extra tomato, Dijon
And a chocolate milk
Lots of syrup
(to Memphis) Right
Right
And they settle in
Across the booth from each other
She takes his hands
You look good
You, too, Ma
What are you doing back
How's Kip
And Helen flushes, a bit ashamed maybe
Have you seen him
No
oh
Atley Jackson came to see me
Atley Jackson
How is that one
How's the leg
He looks at her
Beat
Why didn't you tell me
couldn't
didn't want you to worry
thought held sort himself out
hardly see him
He comes and goes
He's in trouble, isn't he
He's in some trouble
knew it
He's changed, Randall
He's a different boy
He's lost that
That sweetness
It's gone
And  don't know what to do
You getting my checks
Of course
-
He's on the  in the kitchen
One eye on Memphis and Helen -- Detective Castlebeck
It's me
Yeah
You ain't never gonna guess who just come in to visit his Ma -- -
(cont'd) You haven't spoken to him in a while,  guess
He doesn't return my calls
or my letters
Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby
don't know what you remember of him
But you should brace yourself And, on her sad smile, we - Sammy Hagar's " Can't Drive 55" and   : "  " -   - dozen tables
Smells of blue chalk and whiskey
The juke box cranked
We take it to the back of the joint
Where Kip, and Tumbler and Mirror Man are knocking a rack
Freb sits nearby, with a few badly made-up
so
It's my new move
It's called "The Stranger
" What  do is,  sit on my hand for 10 minutes
Till it falls asleep
Till it's good and numb
No feeling
And then  jerk off
That's disgusting - What's the point, man --
Cos it's like you're bein' done by a stranger It rocks
It's the power move of the New Millennium
He sinks another ball
kid, 15,  - comes up to them
Hey, Kip, what's up
What do you say, Toby
, 'm cool - What do you want, shithead
Why you gotta front me like that
'm talking to Kip -- Why don't you leave him alone
known Kip longing than you, man
Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck -- Any word, Kip --
No
And they won't take my calls
What does that mean --
It ain't what you'd call a "good sign" He groks their fear
(cont'd) Look - we managed to get 13 in a week
We just gotta step it up
But we only got till Friday
That's four days
And we lost the 13
So's we gotta start over
Kip looks at him
That, too
(off of Freb's look of fright) Don't sweat it, Freb
We're cool
For Memphis has entered
He clocks the room
Sees them at the rear
Walks back It can be done, man
We just gotta step it up
It's a challenge
The challenge is not to get our nuts cut-off and shoved down our throats
Can  help you, pal --
And Kip looks up
To see Memphis there
Hey, Kip
Hello, Memphis -- "Memphis
" You're Memphis
That's right
Damn
Damn, damn, damn
Memphis
Holy shit
It's an honor, man -- And he pumps his hand
Memphis continues to stare at Kip It's good to see ya, man
You changed your look - You, too Hold the stare
The others are excited
What are you doing back, Memphis
Little visit
Check on the family
It's nice to see ya, man - He smiles
Memphis eyeballs him
Toby is there
Hey, Memphis
Remember me
Toby Walker
live next door
Sure
Hey, Toby
You grew up Yeah, 'm cool
And Memphis turns back to Kip, who's picked up a pool cue
Who's got next game --
And he makes to rack 'em up
Then: get it
You ain't gotta be a genius: Memphis come back to save our bacon
Shut-up, Mirror Man -- Izzat true
You come back to save our bacon
Of course it's true
He come to save his brother's dangling ass -- That can't be it
Cos we don't need saving We don't --
He give you an advance --
Hell, yeah
Ten larger man Kip shoots him a look
As if he's spoken out of turn
You just give 'im back the money
All's well
The others look glum
Kip laughs
Long and hard
"Give lim back the money
" "Give 'im back the money
" Be nice
If only we didn't drink the money
And smoke the money
And buy Nikes with the money
And Sony Play Stations with the money
And dirty girls with the money
And Kip sinks a ball
Memphis looks at the others
They nod
It's true
The money's gone
But don't worry, man
Things are all sweetness and light here
Things are all leafy and suburban
The hell they are -- Sure they are
Although we do appreciate the gesture, Memphis
But we do got it handled
And it was nice to see you -- - Memphis nods
Looks at all of them
Smiles
And then ,  Kip by the collar, yanking him to his feet and in close, nose to nose
You listen to me, baby brother
You fancy yourself some reat neat tough guy scumbum, well, woop-tee-doo, little puppy with a poundcake
But  remember the days when you used to steal my Colorforms and eat 'em
So you can't stop me from saving your "dangling ass' if that's what  feel like doing
And with that, he shoves Kip back down into his seat, toppling the table, bottles and glasses crashing
And barrels away from them, the crowd parting like a wound
Kip's crew left stunned, flustered, and maybe a bit impressed
Damn
Homeboy's on the dazzle
And, off of Kip's furious look, we  : - chill in the air
Memphis walks toward a range of lowslung buildings
- virtual cityscape of dismantled automobile carcasses, piled up high for as far as the eye can see
huge   scoops up a wreck and hauls it over to the
Watch as the car is , for easy shelving
Midnight auto nonpareil
To one side of the yard is a : Watch as a  , with a  , enters the garage
young Mexican  driving
: "         60
" - is
Pulled apart
Fenders, doors, panels, interiors, air bags
- Memphis knocks on the door
dog-faced  opens it
- Yeah --
Randall Raines to see Mr
Calitri
Memphis follows Dog-face to the back of this building
Follows him into another room
Which is An enormous  , fully tricked-out with state-of-the- art table saws and drill presses, jointers and power planes
An antique treadle lathe stands in one corner
stock layout of expensive woods - oak, birch, maple, cherry, mahogany - is stacked against the rear wall
Jars and bottles and cakes of glues, resins, stains and bleaches cram a shelf unit
There's a  here, at a band saw
This is , 59
He wears an apron, protective glasses and a lopsided sneer Richard Widmark motherfucker - with the diamond hard look of a cobra
The liegelord of downtown
And now he works the a hand saw, making critical cross-cuts on a wide panel of maple
Atley Jackson is here as well
As noisy as it is out in the yard, in here, once the door is closed, it's as -as a tomb
on one wall show the cars being crushed and disassembled in the yard
Memphis is led into the room
Calitri nods and Dog-face leaves the room
Calitri smiles
Examines his fresh cut
Randall Raines
It's been a long time
(looks at his clothes;) frowns) 'though  do  recall you as a man with style
You remember your old friend, Atley --
How ya doing
Good to see you, Memphis -- So
What do we owe the honor --
It's about my brother
Kip
Yes
Kip
He says the name like other men say "cancer
" The phone on his desk
Calitri picks it up
Listens
Looks at one of the monitors
Where the Mexican man is talking to several Calitri
Calitri hangs up
Excuse me one moment, Randall
And he picks up a   on his way out
Palming it
- is sobbing
As Raymond Calitri marches toward him, glancing at the bloodied windshield
You bring this to me in this condition
Blood and guts all over it
You make me complicit
On my property
Who taught you how to think
And worst of all: weren't there supposed to be two Hondas
Please
And Calitri, rapid-fire,  the man's belly and chest and legs with the chisel, old-school prison-shiv style
Until the man is on the floor, howling
Stupid sonuvabitch
' Memphis can-see this from one of the monitors
He looks at Atley
Car-jacker
Neglected to clean up after himself
Jesus
The business has changed
Calitri is back, wiping the sweat from his brow with a rag
Now
Where were we
Oh, yes
Kip
don't want him hurt
Calitri looks at him, then waves a hand around the shop
'm proud of this work
The bird feeder
The wagon wheel planter
The dollhouse
The drop-leaf movable server
He gestures to each item - exquisitely-rendered woodwork
Then gestures to the yard
(cont'd) Metal
Steel
It's cold
Ugly
Wood is warm
Clean
Provided by nature
To see a piece of furniture take shape
It's like watching a child grow
Memphis glances to Atley
Atley shrugs
'm sure you're working your way to the point
'll wait right here
Calitri blinks
Smiles
Nods
My point
Yes
Simple, really
require the best
insist on the best
only engage the best
Your brother
His friends
They came to me
They wanted my paper
He was your brother
You were the best
Now
They've brought so much goddamn heat down,  may not be able to fill this order
Which would be very bad for me
Which in turn, is very bad for them
could kill you
That occurred to me
When  first heard about this
That would kill you
Grow up
You don't kill people like me
People like me die in their sleep at 87
Do you know why
Because if you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you - for the next ten years they'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over California
Memphis nods, notes a , resting on a shelf nearby
(cont'd) No, no
You don't kill me, because you can't
You don't take your brother and run, because we'd find him
You don't go to the-police, because we have friends there, too
You do nothing: except deal with me
Memphis eyes him
can come up with the front money
Pay you back
Were it only that easy
have obligations
The order needs to be filled
Calitri takes a manila  from his desk
Hands it to Memphis, who takes out the     inside
(cont'd) On that list, you'll find fifty cars
Fifty
Five-zero
They range in age from the 1956 Ford Thunderbird to the 1999 Toyota Camry; and in expense from the 1993 Volkswagen Jetta to the 1988 Lamborghini Countach
Fifty cars
Five-zero
Memphis scans the list
Looks up at Calitri
(cont'd) There is a container ship in Long Beach Harbor
Pier 14
Ready to be loaded with 4-car-per shipping containers, false-walled and customsprofiled as motor oil designated
The ship leaves in four days for South America and the men who've tendered me this contract
They gave you only four days
They gave me two weeks
wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve
Memphis scans the list
(cont'd) Four days
50 cars
'm paying 200 thousand dollars
Now Memphis looks up
'm not interested -- knew you'd say that
'm just here about my brother
knew you'd say that, too -- Calitri smiles
Memphis 'looks at him
At Atley Realizing the trap
Sound it out for me
Your brother has four days
Fifty cars
Five-zero
For that he gets 200 large
And if he doesn't make it --
Calitri goes to one corner of the shop
Takes a tarp off of a full couch
made this, too
My first one
Brass extension handles, not plated
The coverings are silk, not rayon
Expensive hardwood
And lined with spray green Lorraine crepe
Memphis waits, knowing where this is going -- (cont'd) Yes, yes
made it for young Kip
In case he fails
At 8:00 Friday morning, if that ship sets off without my fifty
Kip will take up permanent residence in this box
Calitri   and the a corrugated steel   is , revealing a   facing the back of the yard
Two are working out there
scuzzy dudes, mid-30s and dressed in dirty coveralls
(cont'd) Come here for a second, boys -- And they come over -- Evenin', Mr
-- Digger, Butz: let me introduce you to Randall Raines
Used to head up the dandiest ring in Southern Cal
Left us for parts unknown
Randall, this is Digger
And that's Butz - Hi, Randall -- Memphis says nothing
Calitri grins
Nods to Digger an Butz, who go back to work
Digger and Butz will be in charge of burial
They're good boys
Memphis' look is cold and furious
Plaintive: don't want them hurt
Any of 'em
"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end
But we don't get to choose these things
Atley hits the wall-switch and the steel door slides shut
Calitri turns to Memphis
(cont'd) "Nothing that's forced can ever be right
" Old woodworking expression
really don't care how the 50 get onto my ship
just care that they do
You decide
With that, he puts his protective glasses back on - and fires up an abrasive-disc-finishing machine, adjusting the miter gage and beginning to sand the Outside curve of an angled chamfer

Memphis glances to the
Grimaces
He looks out the window At the  parked below
'  - Memphis comes out
Moves to the sedan parked across the street it is Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff
know you
You know my back
They get out of the car
The view of San Pedro from up here is a spectacular bedspread of lights
When'd you get to town, Raines
The other day
What for
No particular reason
Catch a Laker game heard we got Shaquille
Where you been, anyway
Just out there
Roaming around
Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets
You seem a little hinked-up
Not at all
He and Castlebeck lock eyes
Castlebeck takes a pear from his coat pocket
Sets to polishing it
remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall
don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit
look at you - here - in my town - and 'm confused
little family emergency -- hope it's not your dear sweet mother
No
Or your baby brother
What was his name
Kip
Yes, Kip
Short for Kipling
Named for the English writer of stories about India
He bites into his pear
Memphis says nothing, waits
(cont'd) got a rash of thefts
new crew is making noise
We recovered a big take - last week
And this has what to do with me
don't know
But you shouldn't be here
Take care of your business
'll give you 24 hours
And then  don't want to see your face
Ever again
Make a fool of me once, that's my bad
Make a fool of me twice
That's really my bad, and 'll kick your ass from here to India
Castlebeck gives him a long look
As they walk back to the car
Good
Cos you know how it plays
Six years ago,  let you go free
But the next time
The next time sends you away for'a long, long while
By the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars
We'll all be cruisin' around in space ships
He laughs
And they drive off
Memphis watching them go
once they're gone
He walks
"  " -    - Kip comes out of the club
Toby follows
You goin' home
Yeah
You want a ride
Sure - How'd you get here
Your Moms give you ride --
Hell, no
boosted a 'Vette
You boosted a 'Vette
Then where is it
dunno
It was right here
Someone musta' boosted it back
Damn crooks is everywhere -- They smile
And go to Kip's
(cont'd) Memphis seemed weird, huh
What's with them clothes
He a farmer now or something
And this seems funny to Kip
He smiles
Yeah
Except the only thing he's growing is old
And they are fronted by
Who toss them up against the wall
(cont'd) What do you want --
One of the goons  Toby in the gut
Toby doubles over
Kip strains to intervene, but his goon holds him back -- Don't you do that
You leave him alone
Shaddup, Raines He's got nothing to do with this -- And the goon punches him in the face
And Kip goes down
And out
Get him in the car - Kip comes to
In his car
Hot white lights blind him
The Trans Am is in the crusher
above him
Calitri
The goons
Hello, Kip -- Kip tries to get out
The doors are pinned by the forklift
Lemme out of this -- Were it only that easy -- We can still do it -- Calitri nods
And the crusher presses
The roof caves a bit Kip is close to scrunch
No you can't
Flies on sherbert is what you remind me of
Because just being attracted to something, doesn't mean you belong
' Atley is here, watching Calitri and Kip
one of the monitors
He's miserable
But there is nothing he can do
- Kip continues to struggle free
Listen, Calitri -- Call me "Ray
" Better yet: call me "asshole
" Cos that's how you've treated me -- get out of this 'm gonna fuck you up -- Calitri does have to admire the stones on the kid
But
Another nod
Another crusher-press
Another scrunch
(cont'd) Calitri --
Nothing
Silence
Kip peers through the slit that the side window has become
Only they are gone
And there is another awful
Kip strains to discern its origin
Only he can't get the angle
We can
It's a huge , tipped with a
It is maneuvered over the Trans Am
Grasps it
And Kip, terrified, inside
And, as the crane dangles the Trans Am toward the black waters of the harbor, we  : '  - Memphis is at the kitchen table
The list of cars before him
He's making notations
He gets to his feet
He goes to check on his mother
She's asleep in her room
He closes the door
And goes back to the kitchen
He goes to a framed  - of he and Kip
Earlier times
Happier times
When there is an enormous
From outside
Memphis goes to a window
Sees a   unloading a gnarled blob of metal
Memphis runs outside
Just as the ramp truck drives off
Memphis goes to the mangled Trans Am
Leans down
And there's Kip
Seriously smooshed in the flattened car
Kip --
Yeah
You all right --
think so
There's things  can't feel right now
Like my feet
But
You think you can get me outta this, Memphis
'd appreciate it - Just hold-on there -- Memphis goes to the garage
Finds a crowbar, an acetylene , tin-snips
He goes back to the wrecked car
And sets to work
He looks at Kip
Shakes his head
(cont'd) So you want to run that part by me again about things being "all sweetness and light
" This has nothing to do with any of that -- Oh
You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher --
All my enemies own car crushers
It's like a pre-requisite
Owwww
Easy
Take it easy
We're almost there
Indeed
Memphis has freed him
Kip crawls from the wreckage His clothes in tatters
Blood seeps from a variety of contusions
He limps
Memphis helps him to the guest house '   -  - Small, cluttered
Posters of Kurt Cobain, a skying Kobe Bryant, Pamela Anderson, two nude girls draped over a glittering Lamborghini Espada, etc
There's a fish tank
And a big-screen , on which the Lakers are currently defending a high-speed Boston Celtic fast-break
Memphis sits on a ratty couch before the
Kip comes out of the bedroom
He's changed clothes
He wears clunky fur-lined , leopard-skin Speedos and a tshirt
He looks slightly ridiculous
Throughout the scene, Memphis should be studying Kip, as if he's seeing him for the very first time
And waiting for the inevitable crack
You okay --
Totally
'm fine
You want a beer, man --
Sure -- And Kip limps toward the refrigerator
He comes back with two beers
Hands one to Memphis
Glances at the  -- you like Kobe's game
do
You think he's heir apparent to
do
He speaks fluent Italian, you know
So he's got that going for him -- And a cut on Kip's forehead starts to bleed
Kip grabs a towel Presses it to his head -- You sure you're okay --
Yeah, man
Where is your beer
Memphis holds it up
Kip nods
There are a pile of on the table
Kip picks one up, absently begins trying to strip it
Cool
So you're living up North
Yeah - heard you were pumping gas - Something like that - You're kind of cultivating a new look
Yeah -- Beat
They watch the game
Kip replaces the soaked towel with another
(cont'd) Maybe you need a stitch -- Nah
It's a scratch
Okay -- Beat
Hey, you want something to eat
What do you got
And Kip hoists himself painfully to his feet
Limps over to the 'fridge
Memphis watches him, a slight grin at Kip's attempt at cool
Kip peers into the 'fridge
Not much
got olives
You like olives
Kalamata olives rule,  think
Ma likes the Calabrese
It's more mellow And he brings over a bowl of olives
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive - Yeah, yeah
That's what 'm thinking -- And they nibble on them
Kip bites into one
And the juice stings his cracked lip
But he disguises his grimace as an appreciative nod
And for a moment, they nibble olives and drop pits into an ashtray
Then: So what are you gonna do
About what
"About what
" About Calitri
No worries, man
'll call him
He's a reasonable dude
can see that - And Memphis glances out the window
To the crushed car
Kip catches the glance, glances himself, chooses to ignore it
(cont'd) You have everything
under control
Yeah
He just wants to know 'm still on it
He needs reassurance
All these big swinging dicks do
No worries
won't let him get into our Kool-Aid
Kip shrugs
Picks up another olive
Remembers the pain' of the last one
Drops it back in the bowl
Memphis is staring at him, disgusted
Kip feels it
(cont'd) What --
What happened to you
What
And now Memphis gets to his feet
Paces the place
You just got crushed in a car
You're bleeding all over your self
And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise
'mon, man
My "demise
" (chuckles) Overreaction "Over--"  You know -  can maybe understand, since  been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that  can partly blame myself
But what is baffling to me, is how, since  been gone, you've become a complete and total moron-- Hey, now - He's gonna kill you --
can handle it -- You can handle it
can handle it -- You can handle it
can handle it -- You
Me
You
Me
Beat
Hold the look
Kip shifts in his chair
Even this hurts
He tries to hide the wince
Memphis goes to the window, looks out at the harbor below
Beat
Then: (cont'd) Why
You think you can help me
And he turns back to Kip
(cont'd) What can you do
You haven't done anything in six years but pump gas and go overall shopping
And the cars, they've changed
There's new shit
Computer chip keys and sophisticated alarms and don't think, an old guy, could much bypass 'em
You don't think so, huh
Not really
But you know
Maybe 'm wrong
And the brothers look at each other
In the pale glow of the For a long beat
And then we'll  : -  /   - rack of eel and  hung out to dry in the salty sun
Memphis walks with Atley Jackson past the bustling commercial fishing hubbub: Portuguese  unloading albacore and bluefin from their ship's hold; Greek  emptying mackerel and halibut from their nylon trawl nets; their  gut, clean and fillet
As they walk, Atley is selecting  from the various Who wrap it up for him
He places it in a leather satchel Everyone seems to know him
Nicolo, how's the yellowtail today
An old , who speaks broken English, wraps up several steaks
Very nice, Atley
Very nice
You can't get it any fresher than this, Memphis
From the sea to my skillet
Nothing in between
What's with the fish thing --
We can learn something from our Asian friends
They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well
Fish
And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world
You know why
All they eat is seafood
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke
" do a poaching number
Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine
In 8 minutes,  could cater a goddamn wedding
Plain but flavorful
And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce
You have a Hollandaise sauce
do
(laughs) Christ, what happened to us
Speak for yourself, boss  don't have a Hollandaise sauce No, but you dress like an asshole
They walk
think about that night a lot
Me, too
Every time  walk
How they were just there
Waiting on us
The fix was definitely in
Nothing from Atley
They walk
Memphis looks at him
(cont'd) Yeah, you know:  just
just never really thanked-you
meant to
just want you to know
Memphis nods
Atley shrugs, and selects some halibut filets
(cont'd) Tell him it's on
Atley looks at him
Yeah --
Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on Atley nods
Any idea how you're gonna go at it
Memphis looks at him
Shakes his head
As a  on-screen reads:   - '  - The hustle and bustle of a full-service auto restoration operation
Dig the 157 Chevy, as an orange diamond tuck and roll with orange fur interior is installed
Dig the 153 Corvette as its front and rear suspension is replaced with coils and airshocks
Dig the 150 Merc, as its chrome is stripped off and the old paint sandblasted and holes brazed
All under the watchful eye of
Late 60s
feisty grease-soaked curmudgeon who begs the question: how the hell did they manage to rock together Yoda and the ghost of Walter Huston
But he remains the Zen master of cars and all that cars are, were and can be
His mixed-breed  - Hemi - licks his balls in one corner Otto is currently  a candy-colored, variegated on the deck lid of a Camaro
It is painstaking work
But he is an artist
His woman -  - a tall blonde, early 40s, body of a thousand dances, wipes his brow, like a scrub nurse
Memphis wanders in
Otto sees Memphis
Drops his brush
He walks over to Memphis Takes him in his arms
Hugs him close
Actually waltzes him a few steps
Memphis is stunned at the transformation this place has gone through
Am  dying
Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell
(holds him at arm's length) And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense --
Hello, Otto
You remember Junie
Of course
Hi, Junie -- Hello, Memphis - What happened here --
Whatever do you mean
The chop-shop
Where are the stripped cars
The rolled-back odometers
The part bins
What happened
Old-age happened
tired of killing them
woke up one morning and thought am no longer a destroyer
am a means of resurrection
Now
We restore
We revive
There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay
Most must die
These don't have to
He calls over to the   working on the pick-up
(cont'd) It's 3 coats of primer, 12 coats of black acrylic lacquer before laying out the flames
And fill the cab top with mylar flakes
They'll sparkle like stars
(turns to Memphis) Randall, Randall, Randall
You look splendid
You, too, Otto And Otto goes back to the Camaro
To finish his work
heard rumors you were back
About Kip
He's gotten involved -- Otto looks up frustrated
To Junie (
) can't concentrate
Play something, my sweetness; my reason to rise
And Junie hits  on a cassette deck
And, instantly, rip from the shop's stereo speakers
Otto listens, as if it were a Mahler symphony
(cont'd) The Ferrari 365 /4 Daytona
At Le Mans
1971
The quad-cam V12
Hear how they got the engine up
Hear those exhaust notes
That's a very wide rev range
Here, it peaks at 5500
Memphis smiles
These eccentricities are old hat
(cont'd) Raymond Calitri
He's amplified much sorrow on these streets
You think it can be done
Are you considering a comeback tour
Tell me
It can be done
Take two days to shop; one to prep
'll offer up my bible for a small fee
You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block
And then get yourself a crew
The hard part
" people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them
" Nietzsche said that
Is he still working here
The old crew
Go find them
can't help you with that
Since 've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around
pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular - Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me Otto has finished the Camaro
He looks at Memphis -- remember  had a 1964 Buick Opal
worst car ever built
Value job
Everything broke and -fixed it
coma car - built to German specs
Plastic gas line
3 speedometer head
On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage
But when that car was gone,  missed it
If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter
And the moral of that story is --
Go to them
They'll be happy to see you
Ahhh
And he closes his eyes
To listen to the Ferrari tape

At one time, he kicked out the jams
Now he teaches driver's ed

Pull her the hell over
Jenny pulls the car over in a lopsided lurch
(cont'd) Put it in
Remember how to do that
It's the big "Pff
She parks it
He stabs at the side-view mirror
(cont'd) "Objects May Appear Closer Than They Seem
" Can you say that for me
'm sorry
You ain't sorry
You're a horrible driver
You can't strap into your seat belt, without almost getting creamed by a bus
She starts to cry
Donny softens
(cont'd) Aw, c'mon
It's no big deal
You can't drive
You can't
Time to acknowledge it and move on can't swim
know  can't
So you know what  do
stay the fuck outta the pool
- Memphis waits outside
The Aries  comes crawling toward him
Donny gets out of the car
Sees Memphis
Damn
Memphis Raines
Long time
How you doing, man
All  get are the Orientals
They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So
What are you doing here
What's with the outfit --
You know where the others are
Donny frowns
Looks close at Memphis
Then: Most of 'em are gone
The Dyar Boys are doing a nickel at Chino; Henry Santoro and Frankie Fish are moving weight in Florida; Bill Doolin was killed in Denver
Atley Jackson's on the gimp and runnin' errands for Calitri; The Sphinx is still around,  guess
Then of course, there's
His pause is meaningful
Forget that
Okay
Figure it forgotten
What's this about anyways --
'  - In a wood-panelled back room, around a conference table: Memphis and Donny sit
With the list before them
Most of 'em are late-model
That's right
Only 10 exotics
We'll have to start beating the bushes, find out where they live
Otto enters
Giggles
Some crew you got
If we put out the word
That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job
What do you think that'll yield
bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men
This ain't like the old days, Memphis
The profession has lost its
Dignity
Yeah
Well, the three of us don't'exactly inspire confidence
Beat
Donny examines the list
Wow
They got Eleanor here --
know
Weird, huh --
The door opens
One of Otto's  is there
Otto, there's someone here to -- But they walk past: Kip, Tumbler, Mirror Man, Toby, Freb Lookit Kip
All grown up
Hey, Donny -- What are you doing here
Otto called - Memphis looks to Otto
Otto shrugs
You need him
No we don't - appreciate your dilemma, Memphis
But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days
His criminal career has officially come to a close
The conundrum still applies, of course
The purpose of the endeavor is to rescue baby brother from imminent death and/or a life of crime
However
This cannot be successfully carried out without baby brother's considerable resources, shabby though they may be
Memphis considers
He has little choice
We do this
Then
You're finished
Then
You're clean like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit
You hear me
hear ya
Get me outta this
'll move to the country
Open a fruit stand
Memphis looks at him
Shakes his head
You guys have any skills at all
Hell, yeah
Mirror Man here is our electronics expert
He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing
How old are you now, Toby
Sixteen
But my birthday's in seven months
Memphis shakes his head
Sighs
(re: Freb) What about him
Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business Freb starts to Protest
Shrugs
People gotta eat
Memphis looks at all of them
Sighs
Okay, then
Otto
In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school
one night boost
Put all your nuts in one basket
And
One night
Are you nuts
You got maybe a better plan
Tumbler looks to Kip
You spread it out
you move around
So's they can't touch you
so's they don't know
Shadow games and shit "Shadow games
" Shadow games
You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you
Know something's up
With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail
Kip and the others nod
Makes sense
(cont'd) Go on, Otto - We're on a truncated time-table
Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it
And we're still going to need to expand the crew
There's no one left
We've got several Italian cars on the list
Always tricky, always timeconsuming
So we're gonna need a specialist
Memphis looks at him
Because that's what he was afraid of
(to Otto) You know of one --
Yeah
He's knows of one all right
So we'll - The Beach Boys' "409" and  : "  "  - , slammed down on a bar by a surly
In a mariner saloon
Drunken  and  and
Sawdust on the floor
Broken beer mirrors
rough joint
One more, girl - The  comes over
She is a dark-haired, heavily tattooed , 26, with the faded blue world-weariness of Roy Orbison song
Her name is Sara Wayland
And she goes by
She collects the Drunk's empty glass
think you've had enough, Billy
Enough
haven't even started, girl
Gimme another -- If you leave now, Billy, you can get a head-start on waking up in a pool of your own vomit
Listen, you little cooze-- And the Drunk reaches out across the bar, to grab a bottle And Sway grabs his hand, twists it
The Drunk groans in agony
And Sway, still clutching his hand, hops over the bar
And drags the drunk by his twisted hand to the front
Cries of "Attagirl, Sway
" pepper the air
"  " - Sway tosses him
The Drunk hitting the pavement
Come back when you've learned how to drink, Billy -- And she freezes
Because standing there, is Memphis
She looks at him
Shocked is a good place to start
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea -- What are you doing here
And she heads back inside
And he follows her
"  " They head toward the bar
(re: his clothes) What's with the look
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old
You look like you lost your sheep
And she hops back behind the bar
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's
Hell, yeah
'm not getting rich in here
Buy you a drink
Nope
got a coffee
And a boyfriend
She waves to a 30-year-old  drinking with his buddies
He waves back
Memphis frowns
(cont'd) Mitch
"Mitch
" Mitch
So  was replaced by Mitch
No
You were replaced by Alex
Who was replaced by Kevin
Who was replaced by Vince
Who was replaced by Mitch
She smiles sourly at him
Wow
And to think all accomplished these past six years was the " " trilogy
She stares at him
Shakes her head
Busies herself with her glassware
Beat
(cont'd) You look great -- Yeah, well, you always were a sucker for flawed existences
-
Watching them talk
(cont'd) You should leave -- On account of Mitch
On account of me
He studies her
Then: 've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway
Including you
Can't we improvise a little here
No can do
Life goes on, pointfive
You left me, remember
left town
didn't leave you
distinction worth noting
And here  am
Yes
But  got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part - Kip's in trouble And now she looks concerned What kind of trouble --
Kip took a job
Fifty ladies in two weeks
Only the two weeks have turned into four days
And not a single lady has been snared
And you got some Italians --
Six or seven
'm not doing it anymore
Haven't for a while
've carved out something for myself
It's pathetic, but it's mine
understand - And the cat -  - comes over with two empty pitchers Another round, Sara - Sure, Mitch - And she goes to the tap
Leaving Memphis and Mitch
How you doing, pal
Memphis nods
Beat
They sit there
Regard Sway
(cont'd) She's hot, right
'd go so far as to say "lovely
" And Mitch leans over to him, conspiratorially
You should her face when she's having sex -- And Memphis turns to him
Really
Really
What's it look like
And Memphis reaches out, and  Mitch's nipple,
Mitch's face curls
(cont'd) Is it a squinty, grimacing, contorted face
Agonized and writhing and ugly
Oh, now  see it, yes, yes
And Memphis releases him
And Mitch goes down hard
And Sway comes over
What the hell are you doing --
If you change your mind
We're at Otto's
It's 50 ladies in 24 hours
For The Carpenter
200  and Kip's life on the felt
So long now
And he's out of there, before Mitch's  can get to him
Who was that guy, Sara
She looks at the door
Shrugs
Good question
'  -  - Memphis, Kip, Donny, Mirror Man and Otto sit around the garage
Going through the list
Tumbler calls from the next room: Freb's here
Open the gate
(to Otto) We sent him out on a solo boost
See what he could do
Freb pulls in an '89 Cadillac Coupe De Ville
How do  look in this one
Like a goofy white boy in a Cadillac
How'd it go
Keys were in it
Well, that defies the point, don't it
You should ask him how he got the name "Freb
" Shaddup, man
Get the damn thing in there and get it cleaned up - Freb pulls in
Pops the trunk
The gate is closed
This is loaded with crap - get a duffel
He pulls out a set of golf clubs
Freb brings over a duffel
Mirror Man plucks something from the trunk
(cont'd) Holy shit
It's a plasticine  - full of a
Lemme see that - He pierces the skin
Tastes
(cont'd) Heroin
No shit
And they pull back the trunk tarp
And there are perhaps similar smack-filled
There's gotta be a million bucks worth here - We're rich
Goddamn, we're rich
Where'd you pick her up
In front of one of them poker parlors in Chinatown
Well, take it back -- Take it back
What do you mean take it back
Are you crazy, man
Take it back, Freb -- Hey, now, Memphis
'mon, man - Donny makes to grab the bag from Mirror Man
But Mirror Man holds on
They tug back and forth
The bag
Splitting on the ground, behind the car
Spilling heroin
(cont'd) Now, see what you-- But a
on the front gate, gives them all pause
Who is it --
(
) Castlebeck
Jesus
The whole damn thing's loaded
one minute --
And the others scatter into the back office, with their tools and devices and lists
Leaving only Memphis and Otto
Memphis picks up the broken bag
Sticks it in the trunk
Puts the golf clubs in on top of it
Slams the trunk
Only there's still a neat       by the rear of the Caddy
But there's no time
For the gate is opened
Detective Castlebeck ambles in
know you
You know my back
What are you still doing here, Randall
Stopped by to see Otto
Say hello
Castlebeck looks at Otto
Otto grins
Castlebeck walks around the garage
Taking it all in
Castlebeck notes the Caddy
What's this --
Cadillac
- the mound of heroin on the floor
What's wrong with it --
Needs brightening
Castlebeck takes out a
Barks into it
Run me down a tag - 329
Cadillac
He clicks off
Otto and Memphis share one
glance to the smack
Castlebeck is a mere inches from it
No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective
Sure
But sometimes we got to create some numbers
The task force is run by statistics, you know
Before they can respond, the radio crackles
(
) 329
There's no want on the license at this time
Castlebeck looks disappointed
Otto grins
Castlebeck stares at the Caddy, still unconvinced
You're thinking: okay, there's no want
But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right
Something like that - Memphis opens the driver's side door
Gestures Castlebeck in Castlebeck gets behind the wheel
Let her rip
And Castlebeck starts the car
-
All of the heroin on the flo is blown away by the exhaust
Memphis winks to Otto
Castlebeck seems satisfied
Gets out
Okay, then
'll catch you later, Randall
Double-meaning intended, right
Right
Castlebeck stops at the gate
Turns back to them
It's funny
There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time 've been here
don't think so, Detective
And Castlebeck is gone
Memphis and Otto exhale big time
The others come out from the back
To find Memphis and Otto dumping the heroin into the sink, running the tap
(cont'd) Take her back to where you found her, Freb -- - Kip is in front of the , playing a video game
Helen Raines is at the kitchen table, going through a
Memphis comes home
Hangs up his coat
Hey - He kisses her head
(cont'd) Kip - Kip nods
Plays on
(cont'd) What do you got there
The photo album
get nostalgic around this time of year
What time of year
Tuesdays
He smiles
Sits down next to her
They go through the : - childhood shots of Memphis and Kip, a younger Helen; Memphis at 17, in his "Ike's Garage" coveralls; 14year-old Memphis, an infant Kip, and their father ( ) a with bright eyes and a quiet smile, standing before an old Cutlass 442; Robert Raines
Outside a car dealership
We can almost feel his strong, sure presence
Memphis looks at his mother
As she looks at the picture
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died
Every day
wonder about that every day
Kip and 'd probably be working at the dealership
(to Kip) Imagine us selling cars
Nothing from Kip
Eyes glued to the
Memphis glances to his Mother
(cont'd) Imagine that --
(salesman voice) And just in case you lose your keys, good sir,  can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge
Mother --
They laugh
Look at the album
At Robert Raines
(cont'd) remember, every day, he'd come home in a different car
That was the greatest thing
And we'd climb all over it
Examine every inch of every different car
remember
Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods
You remember that, Kip
was six
Memphis and Helen look at him
Then: After he died
think that's what  missed most of all
That there was no different cars every night
When  started hanging around Otto's
And he started showing me the things
It was a way to kill two birds
Put food on the table for you and Kip
And
Ride in different cars every night
Just like when Dad was here
Tears stand in Helen's eyes
Kip gets to his feet
Ancient history's two things
"Ancient
" And "history
" And he walks out of the house, door slamming behind him
Memphis turns to his mother
(cont'd) We're gonna have to do this thing, Ma
know
We do it
He'll get clear Once and for all And she nods
-
Robert Raines
Smiling beside an Olds 98
- The garage door opens as a resident drives out
And Memphis and Donny and Kip and Toby enter the garage
They walk along the rows of parked cars
Searching
Car-jacking is the lazy man's boost
No skill
No finesse
Can only take the car if the key is in it
That's not thieving
That's parking
Thugs
With the decency of dirt
They're just cars, man
To prevent Donny from biting the kid's head off, Memphis chimes in with: This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now
Who's "Eleanor
" The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang -500
Why do you call it "Eleanor
" All the vehicles get code names
Female names
You say "Eleanor lives at such and such
" and no one listening on the waves is the wiser
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn
" And there she is -- Indeed, slotted nearby is a '67   -500 Silver with black top
(cont'd) Hello, Eleanor -- And he looks at her
An old friend he hasn't seen in years
It looks just like a regular Mustang -- Don't go there, Toby -- She's not
Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower
But its actual output is closer to 600
So she flies - She soars - Grade- unicorn
What's a "unicorn
" Fabled creature
You know - the horse with the horn
Impossible to capture
Toby looks blank
(cont'd) We all got one
The single car that, no matter how many times you try to boost, something happens
Cops show up, car doesn't start, owner comes back
It's voodoo
You guys and the car thing, man -- They head off
Memphis turns back to the Shelby See you in a few days, Eleanor -- '  -   - To Queen's "'m In Love With My Car
" The crew is at work, a and a  are parked here for practice: Tumbler is modifying a series of slim jims, based on the type of cars they'll be after Donny and Freb are in the Caddy, Freb behind the wheel Tumbler puts together , containing the requisite : slim- jim, gizmo, screwdriver, ratchet, dent-puller, a mini-battery with pointy leads
- Mirror Man is showing off one of his  - beepersized - to Otto
They stand before a locked
And you just stick it in the lock
Hit this little button
And
He does
The door
The car's  gives a weak chirp and dies
Otto looks at Donny
We're dinosaurs, Donny
Pull-up a tar pit
(to Mirror Man) Can  try --
Knock yourself out -- Kip and Memphis are with Toby, who has his laptop out
logged outside the
site, right
Then  monitored their incoming outside data requests, right
Then  got these  numbers, right
Then  tracked them back, right
Then  took the one  could jack-up the easiest, right
Then called back see, they think 'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like 'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right
So now they're sharing it with me, right
They think 'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft
So they let me in, right
Give me all these numbers
But then  don't leave, right
'm in
've got the key
Now just go anywhere  want
So what's in there --
can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight
can tell you how much gas they're using monthly
can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between "" and ""
Memphis nods
Fairly impressed
Good work, Toby -- Donny and Freb are inside the Caddy
Freb's attempts to start it fail
It just ain't happening -- You'll get the hang of it, kid
You just need to remember one thing - What's that
Donny smiles
On boost night
Always take along a good mix tape
Donny smiles
Freb frowns
(cont'd) You bring a woman back to your crib for some lovemaking, the song you put on, depends on the woman, the type of lovemaking you intend to do, right
guess
You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown
You put on Ravel
Rachmaninoff
But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor
You'd put on Prince
Or Isaac Hayes
Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles
okay
It's the same way with cars
Different cars
Different tunes
You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra
You gotta get urgent
You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin , on that shit
But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car
Could lead to disaster
Got it
(absolutely hasn't got it) Got it
Good
And then Sway enters
Donny gets out of the Caddy
(cont'd) Whoa, whoa, whoa
Memphis went out and got some big game
Hello, Sway
was just telling the lads about mix tapes -- (to Freb) Janis Joplin
Billie Holliday
Ella Fitzgerald
Gender bias
Otto is before her
Bowing from the waist
've missed you, Sara Wayland -- Good to see ya, Otto -- They embrace
Memphis and Kip enter from the other room
How ya doing, Sway --
Kip
She looks at Memphis
Small nod
Small smile
What do you think about all this
Stick it in the drawer marked "Fool's Errand", right --
That's my girl -- That's Mirror Man
And that's Freb
And Tumbler
And Toby
Fellas, this is Sara Wayland
They call her "Sway
" Hey - But the kids look high near thunderstruck
The others laugh
Go back to their work
Memphis and Sway (cont'd) No questions
'm here
need the dough
Of course
She studies him
Nods
Good
Just so we understand
And then she sees something at the entrance
(cont'd) Oh, shit
You didn't -- He follows her gaze
To where --  , early 40s, has walked in
Tall, gaunt, ice-eyed
This man never speaks
And his nose is a gnarled blob of scar tissue
Which is why they call him And the others really don't dig his scene
Well, well, well
The original crash test dummy
The Sphinx nods to all
Smiles warmly, but it comes out creepy
Freb whispers to Otto
Who's that --
That's The Sphinx
The Sphinx
He never says a word
And he's got a messed-up nose
Hence
The Sphinx
He's boo-koo koo-koo
But he steals like time
(to The Sphinx) Hello, Sphinxy, old rum --
And Otto embraces the taller man
And the others stand around, offering uneasy glances to The Sphinx
Okay
We're all here
Today's Wednesday
-Day is Friday night
That gives us two days to prep
We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured
Let's get into the vans -- Where we going --
We're going shopping --
We - Gary Numan's new-wave rave classic "Cars"
- of the hard-core old-school preparations
- drive off from Otto's Auto - Mirror Man at the wheel of one of them - The Sphinx and Donny with him
- Freb drives the 2nd van: Memphis, Sway, and Kip with him
Tumbler drives the 3rd van: Otto and Toby with him
They carry pens and
And, as they drive around, they're searching out cars
When they see an auto that corresponds to the list, they take down its license plate
Memphis dials the cell
Mirror Man answers on the speaker in his van
Tumbler in his
We'll - the scene as necessary from van to van
How's it going --
It's arright
They drive on
Till -- (cont'd) Check it out: 173 Firebird
Know who drove one of those
Yes,  do, in fact
John Wayne in McO
That's being obscurest
Who else
Better known
Memphis
Jim Rockford
For real
As the scenes in the vans play out - we should be with  of
Their
As license #s are written down
For real
Okay
Gimme
Peugot convertible
What color
Gray
How you know that
Remember who my brother is
'  - Sway has drawn an intricate  on a vinyl  : 1-50, each car is annotated, ie: 1) '56 Ford -Bird; 2) 188 Lamborghini Countach, etc
She begins ascribing names to them, Female names
With Magic Marker
Easy to erase
- Donny enters with a sheaf of
He waits in line
'   - Mirror Man has hired on as a
pull up in their cars
Mirror Man offers the  of a Porsche Boxster a ticket
And climbs in, to park the car
' Sway writes #2-4) Porsche Boxster and next to it  1 As they drive around
Still searching and quizzing
Fuck that cracker shit -- know that one
General Lee, believe, was a
Dodge Charger
You ever notice how it had a different interior every week
That bugged me
Three words: Get  Life
'   - Memphis and Otto go through Otto's  - an overstuffed with the addresses Otto has collected, over the years, of some 2000 cars
They look for any that correspond to Calitri's 50
- Donny offers the   a  of several cars from the shopping spree
'd like the names and addresses of the owners of these 20 cars please
It'll take me about 15 minutes
can wait
He smiles kindly at her
And takes a seat
It's that easy
'   - Sway at the board
grouping of three Mercedes Benz S320 are designated as  1,  2,  3
'  - Otto shows Freb how to disarm an alarm system by groundingout a tail-light with a wire to a mini-battery
This dead-shorts the lights, shorts-out the alarm system, which chirps for a sustained second and then kills itself
The door locks pop open
Otto grins
'  - Mirror Man in the Boxster
Parked,
He takes the  from the ignition
And then takes, from under his jacket - a And he sets to cutting a  of the key
- Shop and talk, part
Okay, okay
What about
Thanks for playing, Freb
That's a gimme
Yes, but what was on the license plate
The license plate
know
" 1
" Very good
But what was the significance of " 1"
Was that his first name
His first name was Thomas
Thomas Magnum
Thomas Sullivan Magnum, to be exact
They look at Donny, impressed
Robin 1
know
Robin was the name of that faggy guy who hung with him
No
That was Higgins
Jonathan Quayle Higgins
(to Donny) You're like a serial killer, ainchoo
'S_-AUT0 - Sway calls #29 -  '98 Corvette -
- random chop-shop
The Sphinx is buying chopped , that go with the cars on the list
'  - has cut a key, jocks the cutter, and, before he gets out of the Boxster, opens the glove box and grabs the registration
He takes a mini-tape-recorder from his pocket
Reads the owner address into the dock
Returns the registration" to the glove box
Leaves the car
For today
'  - Tumbler and Kip park the car carrier behind a Matterhorn of decimated automobiles
Out of view
- The Sphinx brings the ignitions to the locksmith
Who makes keys for them
'  - Mirror Man taking names and kicking ass
' Sway writes  1 next to #27)
- The Registry Woman gives Donny the list he needed
It's two dollars per car
That'll be 40 dollars please
He pays her
Big smile
- One more time
Anyone
The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate
Memphis
Robin was Robin Masters
He owned the estate they lived on
Ten points for our fearless leader
Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of the Bill Bixby trifecta --
don't know that Stumped --
Thank-God, Sway, you ain't all freaky- deaky, too But Sway grins How about: a Corvette in ; a Ford pick-up truck in , and
Here's where it gets tricky
he walked in '
Kip high-fives her
Freb looks disappointed
Walked like a bastard
Skippin' stones and shit
That's a good one, Donny
think so too -- And they drive
All smiles
All pleased with themselves
And, after a beat
Ya'll really need to get the fuck out of the house more
'  - Sway has finished the chart
50 cars
Their corresponding distaff names
'  - Freb is at his stereo
CDs scattered around him
Tupac
Biggy
Puff Daddy
Making a mix tape
'   - garage dealing exclusively in imports
Memphis enters
Hello --
Sway slides out from beneath a Testarosa
In her greasy coveralls, hair tied back, a motorhead's dream girl
Hey
What's wrong with her --
The right side of the engine is running richer than the left
And the scope isn't showing shit
dunno
And she goes to the sink
(cont'd) You know Annie's trouble Annie --
You haven't been studying -- She gestures to where the  of 50 is on the counter
(cont'd) 137 Roadster
Custom
Lives at 1443 Locklin in Rancho Palos Verdes
Right
Great car
One of a kind was looking forward to that boost myself She was the only "Annie" you could find
They only made a handful
We're lucky there's even one living in the area
Yeah, well
She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft
As she speaks we  : 1443  -    - massive house of glass and steel in a fancy neighborhood
We
Over the fine-trimmed lawn
(
) and he keeps "Annie' in his living room
Like a work of art
Massive framed Lichtenstein and Haring pieces on the wall Surround the yellow , which sits up on a platform
Check out  , a nasty fat man in his late 50s
He sits in the nearly empty room
complex system of directional lighting illuminates the Roadster (
) She's got 27 miles on her o-dom
Which is exactly how far away the custom shop was in 1979 when he bought her
He drove her home, never drove her again
The judge gazes at the car, admiring its jet-pod taillamps
comes in with a tray of tea service The maid crosses the Judge's line of sight
Watch as he curses her out, his face going beet red with fury
(
) The man's a freak
' Sway looks at Memphis
She's trouble -- put the boys on it
They're clever that way
She nods
Long look
go with you -- That what you want
That's what  want
Okay
She hits the Lava soap and starts washing the grease from her hands
(cont'd) missed you, you know - You mentioned that in your letters always thought you'd follow me up
She shuts off the taps
Towels her hands
We were good when you bailed, weren't we
Very good
Cos there were those dark days, when figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew
And give me up in the process
No way
No
No
And he holds out a hand to her
And she puts her greasesmeared towel into it
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall
'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving
So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes
The only reason  ride with you, is cause  don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps
Oh
Okay
Right
'   - Memphis walks out
Going over to the   across the street
Castlebeck
'm on the move - Your girl works in there
Not my girl anymore Yet your still here
gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago
What do you want from me
Honestly
want to - once every few months - get into my car
Pack a lunch
And drive on up to Chino
On visiting day
Bring you some magazines
Maybe some almond clusters
And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit
That's what  want
And with that, he starts his car
Drives off
Memphis gazing after him
-  - Memphis drives
Kip beside him
They drive in silence
At last coming to: -   - huge trucking company warehouse
Kip gets out
Bolt-cuts the chain-fence out front
And Memphis drives on in, passing the long rows of gargantuan here
He picks one
This one
He slim-jims the door
But the  goes off
wild whooping alarm
Deafening
Try as he might, he can't get it off
He pops the trunk
Looks for wires
Nothing
Then, at once, it goes off
Memphis turns
Kip is there
He holds a little
(cont'd) What's that thing --
Reads the infrared
Then kills it
Little something the  &  department came up with
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it
After a while, it became a little pathetic
Figured 'd put you out of your misery
Thank-you
De nada
He gets behind the wheel
Pops the ignition
The truck's flipping stack belches
Memphis climbs in next to him
Ain't we good-timing here
The family that steals together, deals together
Dad'd be proud -- Maybe not
But Dad was from another era
What era was that --
The era when crime didn't pay -- As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher
Price of doing business
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement --
It's for assholes
The Legal Buck blows, Memphis
You know that
Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze
Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic
" And he grins and puts the truck into gear
And off they go '  -  - The Replacements chime in with "Someone Take The Wheel
" Memphis and the crew
All but Sway are present
Tumbler and Mirror Man follow Memphis to one side of the shop
To a window
He gestures outside to where we see and and the orange glow of two cigarettes
Staking them out
We've got to shake them tomorrow night
'm making that your problem
That's called delegation of duties
You like it --
Mirror Man and Tumbler regard the cops
Sure, man -- And they follow him back into the garage
Okay
Tomorrow night it's on
Each team has been assigned their ladies
The teams are: me and Sway
Donny and Freb
Kip and Tumbler
Mirror Man, you and The Sphinx
Mirror Man looks horrified
Aw, c'mon, man
The Sphinx grins at him
What about me
You'll be at the docks
Keeping Otto abreast of our progress
How come
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man
Come on
Kip, talk to the guy There's no talkin' to him -- And Otto and Junie come out with two bottles of champagne and some paper cups
(cup raised) To a safe and successful session of bumping fenders and trading paint
Everyone toasts
Drinks
Donny goes to the tape deck
Hits And "Little Deuce Coupe" by The Beach Boys
("Little Deuce Coupe/You don't know what  got
") And all of our guys dance to it
Singing along
Otto dances with Junie; Tumbler with Toby; even The Sphinx lipsyncs the falsetto parts
"Well, 'm not braggin,' babe So don't put me down But  got the fastest set of wheels in town, etc
" Yes, it's the requisite rock-to-an-oldie bit
But God, it's fun
As they exorcise some pre-boost jitters
Only Kip stands aside from the frolic
We watch them dance and laugh and sing for a bit
And then Atley Jackson is there
And behind him, another Calitri And, finally, Calitri himself stands there
Someone kills the music
They all look at him
Donny and The Sphinx nod to Atley
This is how you're spending my time
Having a sock hop
Everyone know Ray Calitri
Pillar of the community
Look at this
multi-generational gathering of scumbags
So saith the God of Scumbags -- Hello, Otto
My boys at the dock report no cars have yet to be delivered
And there's only one more night
Getting nervous, Ray
What happens to you, wonder, if delivery isn't made
Calitri ignores him
Looks at Kip
With all the free time 've had not counting cars as they're loaded onto my ship, 've managed to sand the cedar inside your box, Kip
This will protect you from the anaerobic bacteria, that normally thrives in an airless; environment
Thus prolonging decay
He smiles
And Kip actually makes a run for him
Only to be held back by Tumbler and Donny
Get out of here, Ray -- One more night -- Get out -- hope you know what you're doing
God help you if you don't
And with that, he leaves, his goons following
Leaving our crew to stare after him
And then we
As a  on-screen reads  : '-- '  -  - As Memphis goes through some old boxes
At last, he finds what he's looking for
Opens it
He takes out its contents
His tools, which we remember from the opening
And then
' - Drycoff and Hawkings wait in their unmarked
Oh, this is a good time -- He lights another cigarette
The ashtray is overflowing
How much can one man smoke
It's a crime, ain't it
Cos Castlebeck's got a bug up his ass over this guy,  gotta get lung cancer
' Mirror Man and Tumbler are at the window Memphis brought them to last night
Mirror Man has a   in his hand
Donny comes by
What are you doing
Watch and learn, old-timer -- As Mirror Man points the antennae out the window
- a 1970  ' replica
Radio-operated, the car speeds along the curb outside, using parked cars as cover
She really cooks
The hell are you doing
Delivering ordnance
Y2K-style
-  '
As it cruises along
Is stopped by a discarded 40 oz
empty
But Mirror Man maneuvers and its back on track
At last, parking jammed up to the front, right tire of '
The Hemi Has Landed -- Big deal
Now what
What we call: fun and shit
And he hits a button on his radio control
- the model 'Cuda
Wedged in front of the tire
As a quartet of thin steel, razor-tipped  thrust out from the Shaker hood
fraction away from the tire's skin
Mirror Man and Tumbler appear satisfied
We can go now -- '   - The one with the Roadster in the living room
The phone
The answering machine picks up
Beeep
(
) Yes, this is a message for Mr
Seymour Croft, of 1443 Locklin
This is the Department of Water and Power and we're going to be doing some work in your area tonight
If you'd please call us at 555-1877, so we could discuss the
' - Freb on this end
He hangs up
- Judge Croft picking up his messages
Writes down the number
Dials
- In the van
Kip and Toby
Toby's got his lap-top out
And they've re-routed the lines into it
The phone rings
Kip answers
Department of Water and Power
Could you hold please
And before the Judge can respond, they've clicked him on hold
And they make him wait
And wait
Just like the real
does
They high-five
(cont'd) Where should we put him
He's a Judge
He'll only bite for something pimpy - At last, Toby answers
Thanks for holding
How can help you
got a message
live at 1443 Locklin
Yes
can you hold, sir --
No,  can't
'm a busy man
Kip can hear his anger
Whispers: Oooh, she's chafed -- okay, sir
Let me just get the-order
Yes
We'll be doing some work out your way
We've got a power leak
And it's unsafe
We're moving residences to the
Marriott Long Beach
Just for the night
Oh, for God's sake know, sir
And Kip pantomimes eating
Toby, at first puzzled, gets it
(cont'd) For the inconvenience we're also offering a free breakfast brunch -- Breakfast brunch --
Yes, sir - Pause
They've got him
Thumbs-up
Okay, then
just go to the Marriott and 'm set
You've been pre-booked
And the Judge hangs up
(cont'd) Goodbye to you, too, assface
' -  - They all wait, anxious
Dressed for their night
And then Memphis enters
Hoots and hollers
He's dressed in the old duds
Black turtleneck
Black boots
Black pants
Long, black, leather duster
Way too cool for school
Memphis Raines returns
miss Orville Redenbacher already -- Okay, okay
The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow
Take your time
It may not seem like it, but the night is long
Long enough
Just think slow and think smart
' - As the crew get into the van
And drive-off
' Drycoff starts her up
Let's see what these bastards are up to -- And' he puts her in gear
And -
The front tire Shredded to rim
(cont'd) What the fu-- He gets out of the car, goes to the front
In time to see the little 'Cuda race off down the street after the crew
(cont'd) Those little pricks --
--
In the back of the van, With his transmitter
Giggling wildly as the 'Cuda zooms after him

Commercial  and beast the black water
We should note the enormous 23,000- ton, 627-foot  , swaying in the harbor
And the giant shoreside   alongside it
An expansive warehouse surrounded by chain-link fence
Enormous are here, in which the stolen cars will be stored
And cartons and cartons of motor oil
massive -- will transport each container to the gantry crane, which will lower it onto the cells in the container ships' hold
Each team is ready
Each has a briefcase containing the tools of the trade
Memphis talks into a two-way
How we doing,  --
' Otto stands before The Big Board - with all the ladies' names on it
On the two-way
Ready to start erasing
Good luck, kiddies -- Memphis clicks off
They climb into 4 Ford Escorts
Okay
All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed
Let's keep chilly
Think Slow
Any questions
You sure  can't go with ya
Memphis' ice-water glance is answer enough
Only use the phones when absolutely necessary
Otto's default
Let's go get 'em
- Of the four cars, as each team slaps a tape in their deck: 1) Kip and Tumbler
The tape is Tupac
They bang fists
2) Donny Astricky and Freb
Donny's playing Miles Davis
3) Memphis and Sway
And Bruce
Ready --
Oh, yeah
4) Mirror Man and The Sphinx
The Sphinx puts on  with attached  , to cover his gnarled one
You should consider always wearing that, boy
And he slides his tape into the deck
And, as The Gap Band's "Burn Rubber On Me" cranks on the track - Our team goes out
Into the night
Toby watching after them
Because they're off
- Tumbler and Kip park the massive   here
Kip is behind him in the Escort
Tumbler gets into the Escort and Kip drives off
- Memphis and Sway in the van
Searching
He pulls to a stop For a Mazda Rx-7 is parked on this quiet, residential
Sway gets out
Eyeballs it
Comes back
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack --
No
Open her
He parks
Opens the back of the van
Sway pulls the Mazda window
Gets in
Ignition-Gizmos her
The motor now running
Waits
Memphis gets in next to her
He has a with him
What the hell's that --
little trick  picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home
He uses his screwdriver to  four rivets on the Mazda's Clubbed steering column
In seconds, the , Club still on it
Memphis pops in the steering wheel he brought, jerry-bangs the rivets
(cont'd) Let's cruise -- And they do
Sway rolls down her window
Tosses something as they drive off - -
"Club" firmly affixed to it
On the ground, in the Mazda's old parking place
- as they systematize the cars they're responsible for
Tumbler drops Kip off by a Porsche
We recognize it as one of the cars Mirror Man cut a key for in the valet scam
Kip selects the key from a series of them hooked into his briefcase
He gets out
Keys the car
He's in
He's off
- meanwhile, has driven to a Volvo C70
He, too, has the key
He's in
He's off
- Kip drives the Porsche onto it, Tumbler enters the lot in the Volvo
as they fill it up
Two Honda Accords, another Volvo, a Toyota 4-runner, etc
-   - All is silent
Chainlink fence topped with swirls of lethal-looking barbed wire
Mirror Man and The Sphinx are here
Mirror Man goes to the main entry fence doors
He boltcuts the chain
The doors slide open
They're in
- Porsche 911 Cabriolet is parked
Donny and Freb look at it
Diane 1
Very good
Think you can get in without waking her up --
Yeah
That's an after-market alarm
Can't just cut her wires
He pops his briefcase
Takes out some gear
Gets out
Moves for Diane 1
- Helen Raines is rooting through a crowded closet
At last she finds what she's looking for
small black boxy
She goes to the living room
Plugs in the box
It is a
And it immediately starts to pop and caw Helen sits down
And listens
Her face clenched with worry
- Mirror Man works the thick steel door
He's got a sledge and center punch
He knocks the knob off with the sledge and then goes to work with an
This is some state-of-the-art shit, kid
The drill breaks the sockets, which force back the spindle and release the lock
only it doesn't seem to be working
And The Sphinx is getting impatient
- Tumbler and Kip pull in with their car carrier
Full
They start to unload it
' As Otto
'  - Memphis and Sway
They ride in silence
She busies herself by looking through the consul
Comes up with a tube of
Uses the visor mirror to apply it
Gosh, no
Lipstick
What next
Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses
Deodorant
And she looks at him
She's really laid the lipstick on thick
But it's oddly effective
Wow
Bozo, the very sexy clown -- Beat
She looks out the window, throws the following away
So, you seeing anybody
No
had a girl
She was great
The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years
So  gotta wait another three years before  can even bother to look
She was so great, why'd you leave her
Her parole officer strongly recommended it
She looks at him
But he's stopped the car
For Kip and Tumbler are waiting at the side of the street
They get in
- Freb dead-shorts the alarm system, grounding it out on the car's own metal surface, just like they taught him
He's in the Porsche
It's just that he can't figure out how to get her started
The passenger door opens
Donny
What's the matter
It's all microchips and shit
Yeah
He holds up a screwdriver
Jams it in the steering column
(cont'd) don't care what kind of car it is
How fancy; how expensive; how new
You pop the collar - it's 1966 all over again
He pops the collar - exposing an ordinary ignition system
Cool
'  -  - Memphis drives
Sway, Kip, Tumbler with him
So we loaded all of the keyed cars up and dropped 'em
It was cake
8 cars, ba-da-bing
Memphis looks at him in the rear-view
Having fun, Kip
Hell, yeah
It's a beautiful business
(realizes his gaffe) mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks
Memphis looks at Sway, shakes his head
Kills the lights
And they pull in to - Where Mirror Man is still struggling with the lock, his drills and punches, scattered about
Just give me another -- only The Sphinx shoves him aside
Pulls the  from his holster and
blasts open the lock
Mirror Man stares at the opened door
Oh,  get it: old school
And Memphis and the others drive up
How's it going
It's going fine
The Quiet Riot and me are swapping trade secrets
And in they go -- Dark as pitch
Flashlights come on
To reveal Old and new models
Daytonas and Boxers and Dinos and Testarossas
There must be at least fifty of them here
Flashlight beams dance over car after car
It's a treasure chest of automotive jewels
All of our heroes are in awe
And then a soft whimpering
They turn
To see Sway, overcome with emotion
It's just
so
beautiful
And it is Kip that puts an arm around her
She sobs into his chest
Never taking her eyes from the array of Italian grace Indeed, they are all in something of trance
Memphis is the first one out -- 'mon, gang
Let's focus
Sway, can you prep 'em --
think so
They're just
So
know
But let's prep 'em
We could stay here all night
That wouldn't be good -- The others are still gazing
(cont'd) Let's go, people -- And they set to work
- Donny Astricky and Freb have accessed a '61 Jag
Watch as Donny takes out 3 screws in the Jag's ignition and removes the whole thing
So
Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways --
'mon, man
We're partners here -- Freb considers
Then, reluctantly -- My names "Fred
" You know: Frederick
One drunk night,  decided to give myself a tattoo
Hot needle it used a mirror to guide me
And he pulls up his sleeve - to show the blue "" tattooed there
(cont'd) The mirror messed me up with the "b" and the "d"
Everything's reversed, you know
Now, 'm "Freb
" Donny chooses from a selection of  he's brought along
Finds the right one
Installs it
Tightens the 3 screws
Starts the car with his own key
Glad to know you, "Freberick
" Let's roll - And off they go
Sway sets to prepping the cars
The others wait nearby
Memphis walks over to where Kip sits
You okay --
'm cool
Memphis looks at his watch
(cont'd) We gonna make it
Too early to tell
Nervous
Nah
That's strange
'm nervous
Donny's nervous
Everyone's nervous
But not you
dunno
Whatever will be will be
That's a good attitude, Kip
For everything but stealing cars
Before Kip can respond, the signature throaty  of Ferrari fills the room, as Sway's got one started -- (cont'd) Showtime -- - as Sway gets the Ferraris started, her skill readily apparent
And each man - Kip, Tumbler, Mirror Man, The Sphinx - climb behind the wheel and
Toby watches as the Ferraris are driven in
He radios Otto
' - as the four corresponding names are
-   - glowing silver; cool wedge shape, 15-degree angled windscreen; the definition of sleek
Memphis and Sway, in the van, roll up to the Maserati
Hello, Tracy
Except that a  comes out of the house
Mid-20s, silk shirt, long, leather Prada coat
Persian'dude
(cont'd) Shit
The man climbs into the Maserati
Memphis follows
-   - Lots of high-end cars
Mirror Man and The Sphinx search the rows At last coming to - Gina --
The 188 Lamborghini Countach
They move for it
Stop
(cont'd) Check it -- He gettures to the
It reads ""
(cont'd) Oooh
"Snake
" Tough guy
"Snake
" Homeboy wants you to call him: Snaake-
They crack up
Size her
(cont'd) No whistles
That's weird
He shrugs
They slim-jim her "beetle-wing" articulated door
Climb in
The Sphinx starts her up
Mirror Ma gets in beside him
The seats are sooo low
(cont'd) This shit's on point
Check it: 200
He gestures to the speedometer
Calibrated to 200
(cont'd) Halfway there, we switch
drive
The Sphinx shrugs
And they head out
(
) Say goodbye to your ride, Snake
- Memphis and Sway have followed the Maserati to another building
Idles
Smokey Robinson's "Cruisin'" croons
What's this guy up to --
After a beat, a  comes out
She gets into the car
It's 1:30 on a Tuesday
Is that any time to pick a girl up for a date
The Maserati's lights go off
He's parked
(cont'd) What, are they gonna mack --
Yeah
The couple start kissing
Memphis checks his watch (cont'd) Maybe she's got a roommate
Beat
They watch the couple in the Maserati for a beat
' Junie, Otto's gal, on the telephone
that's right
They'll be in the lobby of the Riviera Building
2206 Beacon Street
Palos Verdes
And we go to -- - And see a   pull up outside this posh apartment building
The  gets out
Heads to the lobby
We see Kip and Tumbler step out from the shadows across the street
climb into the limo
Drive off
-  - The Sphinx drives
Mirror Man pops in his tape
Albert King's "Drivin' Wheel
" That's what 'm talkin' about --
He boogies down
The Sphinx is bewitched, awed by the car's magnificent power
But then Mirror Man  --
With pure terror
For, at his feet, wrapped around his legs, is - some 8-feet long
mass of heavilykeeled scales shimmering on coiled muscle
Mirror Man screams on and on
The Sphinx swerves wildly
Racing through a red light
Barely missing an on-coming
Passing a pair of  coming out of a 7-11
They hop into their unit
Give chase
- The Persian man and his date
Mackin' hard
Behind them Memphis and Sway wait in the Mazda
Memphis is on the cell okay, check with you soon
He hangs up
(cont'd) Otto says 22 ladies have reported for work
Sway nods
The Maserati's windows are fully-steamed
(cont'd) Man, they're going at it They're in love
Long beat
He looks at her
What about you
She looks at him
Shrugs
You remember my Gramma
Yeah
was thinking
If she were alive
And she asked me
If she came down, right now
Asked me
"What do you do, Sara
What's your life
" Innocently
Nonjudgemental
think it would break her heart if  said  was a thief steal cars, Gramma
And even though, hey,  learned it all from her son
My Uncle Eddie
Who taught me the basics
Which you refined
(You remember Randall, Gramma
You thought he was neat
Well, he refined the basics
)
don't think that's what she hoped for me
She looks at him
(cont'd) But
That said
Car thieves are my weakness
It's all so terribly Loretta Lynn or something,  know
But don't wanna be a thief anymore
don't wanna love a thief anymore
want to wear a dress maybe once in a while
Maybe have a kid
Watch a lot of Audrey Hepburn movies
And think about my Gramma without also thinking "shame on me
Shame on me
Shame on me
" She looks at him
He leans into her
Kisses her
Tentative at first
Then
With urgency
- Phones ringing like mad
Drycoff walks into Castlebeck's office
It's an epidemic, Rollie
'm getting reports every five minutes
-   - As "Little Red Corvette" by Prince warbles on the track
Memphis and Sway still kissing
She breaks it for: Arright
Enough
can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool
But he puts his mouth to her ears
Shhh
Car thieves are your weakness
Whispers
(cont'd) approach you
It's quiet
look this way
That
No one around
Stop
What about Maserati Boy
take out my slim-jim
Oh, God
And yes, this is patently absurd
But it's also oddly sexy
Slip it in
You're going high-cheese, dude -- Unlock your button
"Unlock my button"
The alarms go off
Woo-woo-wooooo
pop your hood; find your siren wires They're factory alarms
Easy to get around
For a man with
Skills

cut "em
Cut 'em
Now
'm in
Of course you are
You're a professional
ratchet your ignition mechanism
bet you say that to all the girls
With a twist of my wrist
You're turned over
Wrong preposition
Hear you roar
What about The Club
Let me worry about The Club
No worries
've got you floored
We're off
Take the curb
Man, can you corner
Know not to get on it
Momentum shift
Don't get on those brakes too hard
Get her up on her tires
Up on her toes
Up
Up
Up
Back arched
small moan escapes her
Prince wails
And Sway has achieved whatever kind of silly climax they aspired to here
She flops back down
Looks at him
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines
(he shrugs) Except now 've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife
And Tracy's on the move
Indeed, the girl has gotten out of the Maserati
And the car has rocketed off
Memphis punches the gas,'sending Sway to the floor
Wham, bam, thank-you, Ma'am, point- five
- Alice Cooper's "Under My Wheels" and   : - ""   as its ass-end fishtails like a bastard
The Sphinx is outrunning what is now a half-dozen
- is freaking out
The snake wrapped all around him
What do  do
What do  do
Aw, man
He's gonna swallow my shit whole Let's go to a hospital or something
But The Sphinx shakes his head
No
(cont'd) 'mon, you creepy no-nosed motherfucker
Take me to a hospital
Nope
The Sphinx drives on
Into yet another ' This one even cooler than the last
And once they've eluded all of the police, The Sphinx pulls over to the side of a What are you doing
'm gonna die
The Sphinx leans over
And (cont'd) You tryin' to make him more mad
But, miraculously, the snake    on Mirror Man
And slithers off
To the back of the car
Where it immediately goes back to sleep
Mirror Man stares at Sphinx, who smiles genially
Then: (cont'd) never thought it'd be possible: but your ass just got spookier
- Freb and Donny Astricky have gotten "Laura", a '99 Bentley started
You ever feel bad about any of this
Of course not
'm Robin Hood
take from the rich, and give to the needy
You mean the poor -- No
The needy
Us
Cos we need this car
And Donny puts her in gear, When a  is jammed agains't Donny's temple
Out of the car, bitch, or  blow your fucking head off --
Donny looks at the jacker
Surprised
It is a
No more than 16
Are you kidding me --
--

So
'll shoot you fool
' --
Donny -- Donny-nothin'
And he

And the kid doubles over
Dropping the gun
Donny gets out of the car
(cont'd) Lazy, disrespectinIf half-assed bully
Any asshole can pull a gun
And he starts to kick at the kid
Beat at him
(cont'd) You don't know how to steal a car, do ya
So you gotta take them when there's already a key in them
And a person in them
Scare people
Intimidate
Little freakin' bully
'mon, Donny
Let's go, man -- Lazy
Lazy
ask you, Freb: what's the matter with kids today
But then -
Bullets rip into Donny Astricky in terrifying -
He turns
To see another
Scared
At the edge of the road
Gat held high
And Donny drops to the pavement
And the first Jacker gets to his feet
Freb goes to Donny
To his splayed-out body
split the night
The jackers run off down the street
(cont'd) Get outta here
Get out
Now
can't leave you here, man -- Freb doesn't know what to do
Donny croaks
'm all right
Been shot before
You take me to the hospital, they bust the both of us
The cops'll take me
Go
And Freb-makes to run off down the street
But -- (cont'd) Freb --
Freb turns back (cont'd) Take Laura with you, you stupid shit
Freb blinks
Nods
Oh, yeah
He climbs into the Bentley Drives off
As the  pull up around him
And the  getout, guns drawn, approaching warily - To find Donny Astricky
Splayed-out on the pavement
Laughing at the moon
And, as Jimi Hendrix' "Crosstown Traffic" , we  : of the final series of boosts
1) The Maserati parked and empty
Sway breaches it

They drive off
2) Kip and Tumbler
Clocking a

It's loaded with bells and whistles and Clubs and a metallic voice that warns: ": " over and over

Speeding toward us
In different cars
As the   and we 1443  -  '   - Where "Annie" the 137 Roadster lives as an objet d'art
in the thicket surrounding the property
Memphis, Sway, Kip, Tumbler, Mirror Man, The Sphinx
Mirror Man has the mansion's   opened
He' going through the wires
Cutting alarm, phone, etc
Memphis is on the cell phone
Face grim
He hangs up
Donny got shot
jacker
How is he --
They got him to the hospital
He's stable
Beat
As they all reflect on this
(cont'd) On a brighter note: 47 ladies have checked in for their South American sea cruise - This cheers them slightly
Until, from the electrical box: Got it --
And the few remaining lights of 1443 flicker and fade
They regard the house for a beat
Now what --
No one's quite sure
They look at the house
At all that glass
Then Kip walks to their car
Pop the trunk, Tumbler
What for --
gotta get my tool -- And Tumbler and Mirror Man look at each other
No way, homes
Too late
The trunk is popped
Kip reaches in
Comes up with, yes, another
And Kip walks toward the house
Toward the vast windows
(cont'd) (to Memphis) Ya' gotta stop him, man -- But Kip forges on, indomitable
Only he passes the huge glass windows
Walking, instead, up to the front door
And he the brick down onto the
Knocking it clean off
Looks back at the others with a wink
And enters the house
Tumbler runs after him
1443 Kip walks through the dark house
At last, coming to the living room
To "Annie'
He gets behind the wheel
Her ignition is quick work
He's got her started, loud, in the quiet house
She coughs a bit; it's been a long time
Tumbler is there
Now what --
Now, we go - And he drives her off the platform
Tumbler directs him
This way
This way
This
Her nose bumps a zillion-dollar , which topples and shatters
(cont'd) That way
And Tumbler climbs in beside him
Kip drives her around the huge living room
And Kip punches the gas
And they drive the Roadster down the hall
And right through the
Driving down onto the lawn
Up to their cohorts
See ya back at the ranch, kids --
And off they go
Vanishing down the street
The others watch after him
Mirror Man to Memphis: Gotta tell ya, man: since you been back
You've had a real calming influence on ol' Kip
- Drycoff comes into Castlebeck's office
They just brought in Donny Astricky
Shot by a jacker
How is he
He'll live
But it means your boy's behind it
Astricky was holding a list
They just faxed it to us
He hands Castlebeck the list
Calitri's 50
Castlebeck notes the last entry
Let's get out there
And have them run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in the area
Find out where they're at
What for
You spend enough time down a man's throat, you get to know his tonsils
Do it
-    - Kip and Tumbler deliver the Roadster
Toby checks it in
Any more
dunno
And Kip gets on the two-way
Any more,  --
(
) You guys are through
Whatcha got left
(
) "Carol
"  198 Mercedes
She lives in the suburbs
We'll take it
(
) It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx
We'll take it
And they climb in behind a waiting Jeep Cherokee
(cont'd) Later, Toby -- But Toby's not around
(cont'd) Toby
No answer
Kip shrugs
And off they go
-   - nice neighborhood
Upper middle class
So damn suburban you can practically smell the gas grills glides by them
Gettin' fancy
Got their own palace guard - When, from the back of the Jeep: never been to the suburbs
Toby is there
Having stowed-away
What are you doing here, assface
Checkin' it out He smiles at Kip
Kip looks at Tumbler
Drives
At last, pulling up to one  where the '98 Benz - "'Carol" lives
Kip parks, a half block down
They get out
Head for the house
And there she is
"Carol
" Obsidian black
In the garage
The garage is open
And  , two boys and a girl
Late teens
They are standing around "Carol"
Drinking beer
Listening to the new Beck album on the car's  player
The folks clearly out of town
Well-scrubbed, white suburban children of plenty
The only crew they've ever run in is
Crew
From the hedge, Kip, Tumbler and Toby watch the kids
With equal parts fascination, loathing, envy
And then, the kids go inside
Leaving "Carol" exposed
got this one
And before the others can respond, he moves for her
And she's open
Toby's in
Butterfly popped - Gizmo in
The others start to get in when     comes out from the house
He stares at Toby, who freezes mid-boost
(cont'd) (whispered hiss) Get her started, man --
And Toby does
And slams her in reverse
And they're off -   - The group - - Memphis, Sway, Freb, Mirror Man, and The Sphinx - has returned
The final cars loaded onto the ship
Memphis looks out into the night -- 'mon, Kip - - "" -  - Toby drives them out, Kip shotgun, Tumbler in the back
But the suburbs are confusing
They can't find their way out
Which way's out, man --
Shit all looks the same here -- They drive
Only up ahead, blocking the street,  blinding
Are     -   on the strong
Guns drawn
Shit
Run it
Toby looks to Kip
No
What am  supposed to do
Toby pins the gas
Straight at the block
The security cops dive out of the way
Except for one standing tall and  into the windshield
Into Toby
The car swerves
Going off the road
Into a bank of mailboxes
The security guards run for her
Kip, forehead bloodied, switches places with Toby, getting behind the wheel
Punches the gas
Getting them out of there
"" -  - Kip drives like a wild man
Toby is bleeding something fierce
Shot in the chest
Jesus, Kip
'm shot, man
Just hold on
Hold on
What are we gonna do --
Hospital
We can't do that, dude -- Kip looks at Tumbler
They both look at Toby
-   - As the 'Vette comes screaming into the warehouse
Kip exploding out of it
Getting into the back
Memphis goes to the car, sees Toby
Front of his shirt covered in blood
The others gather around
Jesus
Memphis climbs into the car
Kip is holding Toby
didn't know
Should we take him to a hospital
didn't know
didn't
Toby is clearly dying in Kip's arms
Kip
Kip
Kip
Tell me: what's gonna happen
What's gonna happen
But Kip is lost
Doesn't know what to say -- You're gonna be okay, Toby
You are
We'll getcha fixed up
No
No
No
Tell me what's gonna happen
Kip
Tell me
What's gonna happen
The brothers stare at the boy
Kip wipes his sweatstreaked face
(cont'd) What's gonna happen
don't feel
like
this
should
happen
right
now
haven't
done
shit
Tears running down his eyes
Shhhhhh, shhhhh
Kip looks to his brother for help
Call 911 - Call 'em here --
--
And Mirror Man scurries for the phone
Toby's breathing comes out in short staccato bursts
Kip
Kip
Kip
It doesn't feel
It doesn't feel
It doesn't feel
good He looks up at Kip
All of the light goes out of his eyes
And Toby is dead
Kip holds him for a beat
Then passes him to a surprisingly emotional Tumbler
Kip gets out of the car, runs for the opposite end of the warehouse
The others are stunned
Mirror Man hangs up the phone
Memphis gets out of the car
He goes after Kip
Finds him in one of the containers
Grabs him by the collars
What did  tell you
What
What did tell you
don't know
What --
And Kip looks at him
Tears fall from the younger boy's eyes
And Kip looks so lost
So like a little kid
Come here -- What
Come here - What
Come here - And Kip does
He walks to Memphis
And Memphis puts his arms around him
And that's it
The floodgates open
Kip begins to sob
Deep, painful, racking sobs
And then: 've missed you, man
know
've missed you, too And they hold each other
Toby
know
Toby
And they stay in the embrace
And then Memphis unwraps Kip's arms from around him
Stay here
Stay here a while
'll be back
Kip nods, sniffles
Memphis walks out of the container
He strides up to the others
Glances at Toby's clipboard, with all the cars crossed-out
He goes to Sway
(cont'd) Give me a ride --
Where to --
Kip's not clear yet
We got one more to go -- And she nods
And climbs into one of the Escorts
And off they go
The others standing around the 'Vette and Toby's body
-
One car left
Eleanor
As a  on-screen reads:  : - The sun just starting to take all the purple from the night
Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff are parked across from the towers in their unmarked
Sway pulls up a few blocks away
Memphis has put on a fake moustache, wig, necktie
You okay --
Yeah
You --
She nods
He looks at her
(cont'd) You should know: walking away from my mother, my brother, this town
Was hard
Walking away from you
Nearly killed me
And she smiles sadly
know
She takes his hand
Squeezes it

Check it out -- He points
The '67 Mustang appears at the top of the garage ramp

Waiting for the light
Castlebeck squints
Raises the binocs
Tough to tell
Memphis drifts into the stream of traffic
(cont'd) What do you think --
Let's see what he's about -- Drycoff hits the lights and sirens
Memphis sees the car behind him
Shit
And kicks it into gear
Hey, now --
He pins it
And
In the biggest way possible
This is the grand-daddy of chase scenes here, so we won't take the easy way out
We'll actually script it
Memphis races out onto the busy street, Drycoff on his ass
Drycoff pulls up alongside him
So they can see him
But the wig and moustache prevent them from recognizing Memphis
Other cars suffer from the pursuit
They go careening into parked cars, storefronts, Harvard Square

Holy shit
And race for the exit
Because Mt

Past the dew-drenched flora and the paddle boats lolling on the lagoon
Only there are   coming from this side too

On the phone

Yes, sir

Memphis hangs up
Hears: (

The pursuit is going again Is it ever
Memphis drives out of the park
And gets onto Ten lanes of gnarly superhighway
He opens her up
Full throttle
The chopper above him

He slips out of the place
No one's noticed him go

Eleanor crashes the gate going 98, to borrow a phrase
But he' s driving too close to the shoulder, and he --
The car does a 180
Landing with a horrible

Memphis is wobbly
Looks like he's almost through
Thirty cop cars idle behind him

Coming to the tunnel's mouth
To the road block
Memphis pins her
Dead-on to the roadblock And, at the last moment, as the  dive out of the way -- Memphis bangs the gear shift into neutral -- And yanks the parking brake -- And the mustang spins on the straight --(and yes, this is exactly like our opening) Screeching spin
It stops inches from the road block

Thirty squad cars stop behind him

The area is closed except to emergency vehicles
Suspect is headed in that direction
Use caution in that area
Repeat: use caution in that area
Southbound traffic on the bridge (into Long Beach) is at a stand-still because of the accident
The Northbound side of the bridge is
Northbound traffic stopped at the accident
Memphis comes to a stop 100 feet before the accident
There is no way past it, onto the bridge
All the cops behind him come to a screeching halt
He is truly trapped
is thrilled
Gotcha now, dickhead -- But Castlebeck's not so sure
He sees a possible play
So does Heavy sigh
He shuts off the radio
And there's a strange As everyone waits
Watches
-- -- Matty In The Morning -- The gang at Otto's -- The Carpenter in his wood shop -- Helen Raines, in front of her  -- The chopper cops -- Paramedics, cops, injured motorists, fire men -- Castlebeck and Drycoff Another few beats of silence
Everyone watching
He punches the gas
Ripping down to the accident site
Heading straight for it
And we fear he aims to smash the site, maybe further injure the accident victims - Not our Memphis
He's heading straight for parked ass-end toward Long Beach
Ramp down
Memphis rockets Eleanor at the ramp truck's ramp
Straight on
And the ramp in glorious super-sexy-bloodpumping - some thirty feet in the air
Evel-style
You gotta be fucking kidding me -- Where she lands in a crippling thud
Onto the  side of the Long Beach Bridge
Cheers from the gang at Otto's
The gang at -108
Memphis pulls her to a stop
Looks back at the scene
Castlebeck squints
Trying to see if it's his boy
Memphis switches the radio back on
Matty has obliged
Wilson Pickett's "Mustang Sallyo
And Memphis drives over the bridge, the only car going northbound
Memphis rides, daddy, rides
-   - half-dozen Calitri  are here, answering phones, playing cards
- The sliding door is open
The  for Kip rests to the side
Calitri uses a router to make a rabbet along the bottom frame of a plywood gossip bench
He senses something and turns to - has driven up in the smashed-to-shit Eleanor
He climbs up, entering the workshop
Calitri glances to the wallclock: 7:55 Well, well
You've caused quite a ruckus
This is number 50
We did it
It's over Where's the money
Right there - He gestures to a Haliburton case
Memphis opens it
There's a lot of cash inside
(cont'd) 200
Just like we said
You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved
But  had to
It was the only way to get to you -- Memphis looks at him
Calitri smiles
Well, now, he's clear
And you'll stay away from him
don't know about that, Randall
He did such a good job on this paper
And another one just came in
Calitri goes to the  machine
Tears off the sheet
(cont'd) It's an easier take
30 cars
Two weeks
Most of them SUVs
Going to Russia
Think Kip'll be interested
You don't want to even sniff at that -- Calitri grins
But then his smile goes south, as he sees, for the first time --  -- parked out on the loading dock
And she is smashed-to-shit
Well, that certainly won't do
What do you mean --
Look at it
can't very well make delivery of that thing
You got no choice
It's over
Fifty cars
Fifty cars by 8 Friday
Or Kip goes in that box
That was the deal
Goddamn, it
That was the deal
Memphis is by a
He flicks it on
The electric rumbles, so as to obfuscate, any noise in here
(cont'd) What are you doing --
Tell you what 'm not doing: 'm not gonna let you get into my Kool Aid
And Memphis is on him
They go rolling about in grunts and groans - eddies of sawdust swirling - the  of the table saw drowning out the sounds of combat
Calitri is on top, grabbing an  from the floor, bringing the lethal point down to Memphis' face
Memphis holds Calitri's wrist, straining, the point inches from his eye -   - right above Memphis' head
With a last gasp, Memphis misdirects the awl so it     - a small    shaking through their bodies, as they sprawl akimbo
Both men are momentarily paralyzed as the electricity sorts itself out inside of them
Calitri is up; and he's found the gun
He crawls over to Memphis, climbing on him, sitting down hard on the younger man's chest
But then Memphis grabs him by the hair and tosses Calitri off him
Memphis  Calitri's head into the floor
Once, twice
Three times
Calitri is out
Memphis gets to his feet, nose bloody
He catches his breath
Only the door opens
And Atley is there
Jesus, man
What'd you do
My version of "take this job and shove it
" Are you crazy
You throw down with The Carpenter
You got a grudge against your life
But before Memphis can respond, there are from up the alleyway -- as    arrives
Memphis and Atley look at the wall-clock
8:05
glance to the unconscious Calitri
(cont'd) Now you done it
And with you gone - who'll save Kip the next time
This is all about there not being a next time, Atley -- And the two men hold the look
And the van doors slam, as Digger and Butz, Calitri's grave-diggers, get out
Atley goes to the unconscious Calitri
And he picks him up, straining under the dead weight
Dragging the don over to - One final burst of strength and Atley drops Calitri into the casket
Slamming the swell top lid of the coffin
He turns to look at the shocked Memphis -- As Digger and Butz are there - Hello, boys --
Hey
What happened
Did they make it They did not
tragedy
Mr
around
He's napping
He said to take it away
Atley gestures to the coffin
And they pick it up, move it to the van
That'll do ya
Tell Mr
we was by
Absolutely
And they are gone
And Atley turns to Memphis Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right
Point-five
And he holds out his hand
And they shake
Get outta here, Memphis -- And Memphis does
Nods to Atley
Thank you
Atley nods
Memphis walks out to the loading dock
Atley watches him go
Hoo-boy
'  - Memphis walks to the battered Eleanor
As Pearl Jam's "Rearviewmirror' crunches and a  comes motoring up to him
It's 167
, a "For Sale" sign pasted on the back window
It's being driven by Kip
What are you doing here
saw her get smashed-up on the
Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her
Where'd you find this one
Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis
Cos you never know when you're gonna need one -- You boost her --
Hell, yeah
She's not my unicorn
Move over
Kip does
Memphis gets behind the wheel
Drives
- Memphis drives
Kip beside him
You okay --
dunno
keep thinking about him
Memphis nods
But then   behind them
An with Code 3 capabilities - lights & sirens
Memphis considers He could make another run
But the looks at Kip
Enough is enough
He pulls over
(cont'd) What are you doing
You can outrun him
It's over
The dumb shit is over
The unmarked pulls up behind him
The cop comes over
It is, of course, Detective Castlebeck
know you
You know my back
Castlebeck opens his coat
Showing stuffed holster
It's finished, Randall
Get out of the car
You, too, kid
Memphis starts to get out
When Castleback's  crackles
(
) We have suspect vehicle matching description at the Woodburn Scrap and Metal
Repeat: the suspect vehicle has just been apprehended at the Woodburn Scrap and Metal, 190 Street and Campanza
Castlebeck frowns, goes to his radio
Memphis looks at Kip
reported it
Memphis is impressed
Not bad -  at his car, on the radio
Dispatch, what's the license on the suspect vehicle
(
) License is California 6-1-4
Repeat: California
6-1-4 Henry Sam Ocean
And Castlebeck looks at the license on this Eleanor
vanity plate that says -  67
10-4
And he goes back over to Memphis
(cont'd) Looks like we live to fight another round
You're free to go
Memphis can barely believe it
Castlebeck leans down, to Kip: (cont'd) Your brother's a clever man and a talented thief, Kipling
But as role models go, you should observe the man, not the thief
Yes, sir
Castlebeck sighs
Don't look so glum, Detective
It's a beautiful day, the birds are singing, and there's a container ship on Pier 14, that's guaranteed to bring you glee
Castlebeck nods
want you gone, Randall
Settle your affairs
Make it right with those you love
Hell, take 'em with you
But want you out of here
Out of here for good this time
Consider me gone, Detective -- 'll catch you later, Randall -- Double-meaning intended -- You betcha -- And Memphis races off
'  - Otto, The Sphinx, Tumbler, Freb and Mirror Man are sipping coffee and eating donuts
They are exhausted
Memphis and Kip pull up in Eleanor
He hands Otto the briefcase
Otto opens it
All that cash
Split it up
Any word on Donny
He's gonna be okay
Could do a bit
What happened to Sway
She left
He nods
The boys are huddled together
Poor Toby, man
few beats of silence as they remember; then shockingly: If his premature demise has, in some way, enlightened the rest of you as to the grim finish below the glossy veneer of criminal life, and inspired you to change your ways, then his death carries with it an inherent nobility
And a supreme glory
We should all be so fortunate
You can say 'Poor Toby
"  say: "Poor us
" They all stare at him, stunned
You spoke The Sphinx shrugs
Say something else, man But The Sphinx lapses back into his silence
Nibbles a donut Sips coffee
Memphis smiles
He takes a stack of bills from the briefcase
To Kip: You remember where you got this Eleanor --
Sure, man -- She's for sale
They're asking forty thousand
Give 'em sixty
And he hands Kip the cash
You want me to buy her
Shocking, huh
We're clear now
It's done
've never actually paid for a car
want to see what it feels like Kip nods
Memphis looks at a grinning Otto
Dinosaurs
All of us
The Ice Age is now
'll see you soon -- Where you off to --
Thought 'd go for a ride - He smiles
The others do, too
Memphis heads for Eleanor
Hey, Memphis --
Memphis turns back
(cont'd) 'll see you, right
Memphis nods
You'll see me
And we - Sammy John's "Chevy Van" and  : '   - Sway, underneath a Daytona
We only see her from the waist down Hands on her waist
Pulls her gently out
Memphis
He brings her to her feet
What are you doing
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride
And he uses a rag to tenderly wipe a small black smear of oil from her cheek
can't
got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and  haven't slept and-- (stops short; sees the new Eleanor outside) Where to --
dunno
know a place
She looks at him
Long and hard
This time it's for real
Oh, yeah
For real, point-five
' - And Memphis opens the passenger door for her
And she gets in
And she smiles
And Memphis climbs behind the wheel
He neutral-drops Eleanor, chirping off
-    - As two  guide the giant freighter away from the docks
All those containers
Filled with cars
But here comes a Churning for the ship
Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff on the deck
Stopping this one cold
-   - vast expanse of trash and garbage and layers of earth
Deserted, except for    parked dead center
Digger and Butz slide the casket from the van, parked before an
As they move the casket, a  from inside
And muffled
Digger and Butz exchange a horrified glance
They stare at the casket, spooked
Do you believe this
What should we do
We gotta do what we gotta do -- Shit
hate the screamers, man
Why can't he finish the freakin' job
Forget about it
Occupational hazard, Digger
'mon
And just as we think they're sure to open it -- they --
And begin to dump shovelfuls of earth upon it; its unseen occupant thumping and pounding and yelling -- And soon the casket is covered in dirt
Gone
And we - The Turtles' pop gem "Eleanor" ("You got a thing about you/ just can't live without you/ really want you/ Eleanor near me
")   : 405   -  -  - Memphis driving
Sway riding shotgun
Long Beach at their backs Memphis looks quite enthralled behind the wheel
He loves driving this car
Sway watches him
He feels it -- What --
Nothing
Just that if  was less secure,  might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me
She does have one thing you don't
What's that
Bench seats
And he grins
Pats the seat beside him
And Sway slides close
He throws his arm around her
And off they go
As The Turtles' ("Eleanor/Gee,  think you're swell/And you really do me well/You're my pride and joy, etc
") And we hear: (
) You like bingo --
And Eleanor drives away from us
Into the searing horizon line Becoming just another single, yellow dot in the pointillist pattern that is the American road
