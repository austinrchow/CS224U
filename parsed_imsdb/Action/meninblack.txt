Men In Black by Ed Solomon -- /  -- million stars wink in the night desert sky
Down here on earth, an insect, one of those big, beautiful, multicolored four-winged jobs, glides effortlessly on the breeze, wafting along through the crisp Texas air
The insect dips, it banks, it does loop-the-loops -- and then unceremoniously against the windshield of a white van that's tearing down the road
-- /  -- The  of the van, a fifty-year-old American, turns on the wipers, smearing the remains all over
Goddamn bugs
He squirts some wiper fluid onto the glass, which clears it up a bit, but now he sees something worse up ahead
It's a grouping of headlights, eight of them, all pointed at him, sealing off the road
He bites his lip and calls over his shoulder, to the back of the van
He speaks in Spanish, which is subtitled
(') Deja me hablar
(Let me do the talking
) -- /  -- The van slows to a stop in front of the parked cars, all government-issue four doors with "" stenciled on the sides
Seven or eight stand in front of the cars imposingly
Their apparent leader steps forward and comes to the window
The  rolls it down
, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, also government issue, looks at him and sighs
Well
Nick the Dick
What a surprise
Where you comin' from
was fishing in Cuernavaca
Sure you were
What do you say we have a look at your catch
, the Agents fling open the rear doors, revealing a , hopeful immigrants without official permission
Agent Janus looks at the Driver, who's now held by two other Agents, and shakes his head
Me,  woulda thrown 'em back
(to the passengers, in Spanish) Vamanos
Fuera
Hagan una lina
(Let's go
Out
Form a line
) They pile out of the van
Some are parents with small children
(') What do you get, Nick
Hundred bucks a head
Two hundred
hope you saved it all for your lawyer, pal, 'cause you're gonna need -- He stops in the middle of his sentence, as another car is approaching, fast, its engine  as it barrels down the road toward them
Several Agents pull their weapons
The new car pulls a hard right, goes off the road, spins around the cars, and  to a sideways halt, silhouetted in front of their headlights
It's a boxy, black 1986 Ford
get out, dressed in plain black suits, crisp white shirts, simple black ties, shiny black shoes
, fiftyish, is the apotheosis of world-weary; his partner, , mid-sixties, is just weary
They approach the  agents
We'll take it from here
Who the hell are you
Kay and Dee flash some form of
Division 6
Division 6
never heard of Division 6
Really
Kay and Dee move past him and approach the row of nervous immigrants
(') What're we thinking, Dee
Tough call, Kay
He walks down the row, studying the faces, greeting each one cheerily in Spanish
Oye
Que pasa, coma estas
Hey
(What's up, how are you
) No se preocupe, abuela
Bienvenida a los Estados Unidos
(Don't worry grandma
Welcome to the United States
) (next) donde vas
San Antonio
Buscando trabajo, no
Buena suerta
(Where are you going
San Antonio
Looking for work, aren't you
Good luck
) (next) Es un placer verle aqui
(It's a pleasure seeing you here
) One by one, their faces relax, reassured by Kay's calm demeanor
When he reaches the fifth Guy, he keeps the same cheery tone, but: (') Que dices si te rompo la cara
(What do you say if break your face
) The Guy smiles and nods
Kay stops
His own smile broadens and he drops a hand on the Guy's shoulder
(') No hablas ni una palabra del Espanol, verdad, amigo
(You don't speak a word of Spanish, right, friend
) Again, the Guy smiles and nods
Kay looks back at Dee
(') We got a winner
(to the others) Los restos estan libres a irse
Largense
(The rest of you are free to go
Scram
) Sir
Tomen el camion, y vayeuse
(Get on the road and go
) Sir, you can't just -- Don't "Sir" me
You have no idea who you're dealing with
Silence on the road
The Driver grins, jumps back in the front seat of the van
The others pile into the rear and they tear out of there
(') (to Janus) We're gonna have a little chat with our friend here
You boys can hit the road
and keep on protecting us from dangerous aliens
Kay and Dee escort their captive across the road and over a small rise, leaving the stunned  agents standing alone in the roadway
You ever heard of Division 6
2ND There is no Division 6
3RD Who are those guys
- Kay and Dee lead their captive into a clearing in the desert brush
Dee pulls an enormous handgun from a shoulder holster and stays a pace or two off, covering him
Kay has an arm draped around the man's shoulders
think you jumped off the bus in the wrong part of town, amigo
In fact, 'll bet dollars to pesos that you're not -- He pulls out a small laser device, which he  neatly down the front of the man's clothes
(') -- from anywhere near here
The man's clothes fall to the ground, revealing what he really is underneath --    , about four-and-a-half feet tall, with a snouth, snail-like tentacles, and independently moving eyes on stalks at the top of his head
The only part of his camouflage not crumpled to the ground is the humanesque "head," which he still lamely holds in one of his hands
It's propped up by a stick, like a puppet, and it continues to make expressions as he holds it
(') Mikey
When did they let you out of jail
replies -- an unfathomable combination of , , and saliva
(') Political refugee
Right
You know how many treaty articles you've just violated
Mikey makes a lame
One, my ass
Try seven
From unauthorized immigration to failure to properly inoculate prior to landing
(off Mikey's objections) Okay, that's enough
Hand me your head and put up your arms
From behind Mikey, they hear a terrified
Kay and Dee both look over quickly
One of the alien's eyes, on a tall stalk, whips around too
All three of them see  , standing just over the rise, staring in frozen amazement
(') Ah, shit
Agent Janus
Mikey rips free of the rest of the "Mexican" disguise, knocks Dee out of the way, and takes off straight at Janus, a horrible Space Bastard screech
Janus freezes, terrified
(') Dee
Shoot him
Dee struggles to roll over and change the controls on his gun, which fell out of his hand as he hit the ground
(') Dee, for Christ's -- Mikey keeps moving, covering the last few yards to Janus quickly
He steps on a rock, launches himself into the air, his dripping jaws cranked wide open -- -- there is a  sound, a brilliant white flash -- -- and Mikey  in a geyser of blue goo that splatters all over the ground, the trees, and Agent Janus' face
Behind where Mikey was, Kay stands, smoking weapon in hand
-- /  -- On the road, the   pull their guns and run toward the rise
-- Kay has an arm around Janus, whom he is leading further into the clearing
Janus is white, shaking, eyes like silver dollars
Th -- th -- th -- (helping) "That
" That wasn't -- wasn't -- wasn't -- Human,  know
Oops
Got some entrails on you
He takes out a handkerchief and wipes off the Agent's face
As he does, Janus looks back to where Mikey blew up
Then at Kay
And then up at the stars
The other  Agents burst over the rise,  questions
Okay, everybody, situation's under control, calm down
If you'll just give me your attention for a moment 'll tell you what happened
From over the rise, car engines  in the distance and headlights start to flash around them
Kay reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tubular metallic device the size of a pocket recorder
He checks his watch, figures in his head, then dials an electronic counter on the side of the device up to "08
" (') This is called a "neuralyzer
"  gift from some friends from out of town
The red eye here isolates and measures the electronic impulses in your brain
More specifically, the ones for memory
Behind him, six more   , all wearing black suits and sunglasses, come over the hill
Kay barks a few orders to them
(') Gimme a splay burn on the perimeter, please; holes at 40, 60, and 80
2ND What in the hell is going on
Exactly the right question
And the answer lies right -- here
Pay attention
Who are you, really
Really
'm just a figment of your imagination
He holds up the neuralyzer
The Agents peer closely at it
Kay reaches into his pocket, puts on his own black sunglasses -- -- and pushes a button on the side of the neuralyzer
a tenth of a second long sears the Agents' eyeballs
They stare blankly
(') God, we're a gullible breed
Behind him,    blast from a flame thrower held by one of the Men in Black
Kay looks back at the  Agents, who are just coming around, as if awakening from a concussion
(') mean it, fellas, you are lucky to be alive after a blast like that
The Agents look around, confused
What -- blast
Kay gestures behind him, where the Men in Black are now using fire extinguishers to douse the flames they themselves started
Underground gas vein, genius
You guys need to exercise more caution before discharging your firearms
He jabs a finger into Janus' chest
(') Especially you
Dee has moved away from them all and is sitting on a rock, staring up at the night sky, his sunglasses dangling idly from one hand
Kay steps away from the group and finds him
He sits down next to him
'm sorry
About
back there
Happens
Didn't used to
He holds up his hands, which tremble with age
(') The spirit's willing, Kay, but the rest of me
He looks up, at the million stars shining overhead
(') They're beautiful, aren't they
What
The stars
We never just -- look
Anymore
(back to Kay) 'll tell ya, Kay
will miss the chase
Kay pulls his neuralyzer from his pocket and looks down at it
No
You won't
--   -- shot of the clock on the Station's stately southern exposure pair of feet running
They belong to a man we will know as the As we track with him, he   and
new set of feet come into frame
These belong to  , a in undercover street clothes
In the , about ten feet behind, are two other cops, trying to keep up
Edwards is a lot faster, though
He pulls out his badge that hangs from a chain under his shirt
Stop
He continues running, out of frame, and we stay on one of the other , overweight, who gives up the chase and drops to his knees, heaving air
All yours, Edwards
The Cop fumbles in his pocket for a pack of cigarettes
As they run down the bridge that traverses Park Avenue in the low Forties
The Perp veers to the left and, seemingly oblivious to the fact that it's a thirty-foot drop, he hurdles the guard rail, and drops to Forty-first Street below
is surprised by this maneuver, but doesn't waste a second
He, too, hurdles the guard rail and lands on
41ST     - - , one of those cheesy sightseers that hold up midtown traffic
The bus, of course, is completely filled with  , and it seems like every single one of them has a video camera
pushes through the crowd
Grand Central Station off to your left, folks
With the bus still moving, he scrambles down the circular stairs and runs out through the side door
He spots the Perp, sailing east on Forty-first Street
Dammit, man, you're making me sweat up my gear
Edwards spots one of those New York Post delivery trucks, the kind with the open back door, rumbling by
He runs and jumps into the back
-- , meanwhile, is running at top speed, when Edwards glides into frame, leaning off the back of the truck
Yo, man, your luck just ran out
He leaps from the back of the moving truck and tackles the Perp
The Perp, now straddled by Edwards, is terrified
He's coming
He's coming
And when he gets here, 'll kick his ass too
Edwards is about to slap the cuffs on him, when the Perp blinks
Nothing unusual about that, but then another set of translucent, milky white eyelids, underneath his regular eyelids, blinks also
Edwards is thrown for a moment, which is all the time the Perp needs to pull out
His , which is the strangest looking gun you've ever seen
Reacting quickly, Edwards bats it out of the Perp's hand
smashes into the stone wall surrounding Central Park and into a million pieces
What the
The Perp kicks him in the nuts, then scrambles to his feet and takes off again
Edwards staggers after him, in pain
The Perp leaps over a moving car, towards the
Edwards tries to follow, but a bus pulls in front of him
After it passes, the Perp is gone
-- Edwards runs over to the Museum, leans over the wall that surrounds it, and in the next instant
The Perp flies past him, having leapt from twenty feet down to the top of the Guggenheim
He scrambles up and over the ledge
Edward reacts
He runs to the front door of the Museum, shoots it open and runs inside
He runs from the rotunda up the grand ramp of the Guggenheim
--  -- On the roof, the  reaches the top, climbs over the edge, and to the gravel surface
He leaps to his feet and races over to a door
It's locked
He tugs on another
It's locked too
He pulls on a third
It swings open -- -- revealing  on the other side, breathing hard
He aims his weapon at the Perp
Wassup
The Perp  inhumanly and panics
He backpedals, toward the edge of the roof
He's coming
He's coming because  failed, and now he'll kill me too
Stop
You don't understand
Your world is gonna end
But the Perp has backed right into the edge of the roof, and now he starts to fall over
The Perp blinks
What are you
The Perp looks down
He decides
-- and he falls, , to his death
: -- sits on one side of the table, a   and a (the one who gave up the chase and lit a cigarette earlier), sit across from him
Perpetrator then blinked two sets of eyelids
You mean blinked with both eyes
No, sir
He blinked once with one set, then again with another completely different set
Sort of a low beam, high beam
Was that before or after he drew the weapon which you claim evaporated into a million pieces
After, sir
And why do you suppose none of the other officers saw either of these two events
'Cause some of the other officers are a little soggy in the midsection
And they couldn't keep up, sir
Hey, Edwards, if you were half the man am -- What do you mean
am half the man you are
What the hell is your problem
My problem is you being all up in my damn face all the time
think he threw him off the roof
Ten minutes -- your best shot
(cutting off the Sergeant) Sergeant
want to talk to you outside
Now
You need ten minutes on a Stairmaster, you pudgy bastard
--  -- woman sneaks into the room
, thirtyish, dark-haired, dark-eyed, general aura of darkness around her, stands above him
Laurel looks like she was just dragged out of bed (which she was) and saw a spaceman (which she did)
She looks over her shoulder once, then whispers to him
Laurel Weaver
Deputy Medical Examiner believe you
opened him up
Find me at the morgue
On 26th
'll tell you what found
Hey
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
(turning at the door) You have really pretty eyes
She hurries to turn the corner, but is  by someone who remains just offscreen
(
) Dr
Weaver, from the coroner's office
Working on the John Doe
Edwards twists in his chair, to get a better look
All he sees is Laurel, facing whoever it is in the hallway
Yes
That's right
(
) Would you look right here, please
The Someone says something else and Laurel steps forward, now also out of Edwards's line of vision
(
) Look where
Edwards stretches even further in his seat, when there is a blinding from the corridor
Really curious now, he starts to get up -- -- when  steps into the room and closes the door behind him
Edwards rolls his eyes
Some night, huh
Oh, yeah, some night
He crosses to the door
They were gills
Edwards stops
Not eyelids
Who are you
Did he say anything to you
(scoffing) Yeah, sure
He said the world was coming to an end
Did he say when
You're kidding, right
Would you recognize his weapon if you saw it again
Absolutely
Let's take a ride
Wait a minute
got a ton of paperwork
It's all done
At that point, the  sticks his head in, smiles and gives Edwards the thumbs up
Good work, Edwards
Edwards looks at the Inspector, then at Kay
As they leave
You ran that guy down on foot
That's tough
That's double tough
: -    - In a plain, boxy Ford, Kay drives, silent
He raises his hand and nods to a black  truck coming in the opposite direction
Edwards, in the passenger seat, is still in his undercover outfit
So who you with
Kay says nothing
(') You got the plain clothes, the government-issued wheels
Secret Service
Kay remains utterly silent
(') (referring to the car) Yeah, well, whoever it is, you're short on funding
Nothing is what it seems, kid
Oh, yeah, my bad '86 Ford
That's a luxury ride
'mon, who ya with
Kay pulls the car to a stop
'm part of a secret organization that monitors and polices alien activity on earth
Kay opens the door and gets out of the car
Edwards follows
- Edwards looks around
Sees they're standing in front of a
This is where we're going
They get out of the car
(') Jack Jeebs
Guy buys from chain snatchers
Doesn't even sell guns
Really
All right, you think it's worth shaking him up, fine
'll do my thing
Then  want some answers
Do your "thing," kid
Edwards goes inside
- is the sleazy, sarcastic proprietor of the Pawn Shop
He's not easily intimidated
Officer Edwards
Oh, hey, geez, how'd these get here
thought  turned 'em in to the proper authorities
He casually brushes some Rolexes off the counter
Way  hear it, Jeebs, you into something a little hotter than some stolen Rolexes
Sure -- 'm a big crack dealer now
just work here because  love the hours
This pisses Edwards off
He grabs Jeebs by the collar
(getting angry) 'm talking about guns, Jeebs
High-tech stuff
'mon, Edwards, whatcha see is what  got
(
) Why don't you show him the imports, Jeebs
At the sound of Kay's voice, Jeebs suddenly pales, a look of fear coming over his face
-hiya Kay, how are you
The imports, Jeebs
Now
You know  got outta that business a long time ago, Kay
Why do you lie to me
hate it when you lie
He pulls his own gun and aims it at Jeebs' forehead
Whoa, whoa, Kay, hold on a minute here
'm going to count to three
Edwards, seeing that Kay is getting somewhere, joins in the routine
He'll do it, Jeebs
One
've seen him do it
Two
Talk to me, Jeebs, he's crazy when he's like this
He's always crazy
(to Kay) Take a cruise
Get a massage -- Three
-
Kay blows Jeebs' head off and Jeebs' body collapses to the floor
Edwards is shocked
Edwards pulls his own weapon and points it at Kay's head
Put down the gun and put your hands on the counter
warned him
Drop the weapon
You warned him
You are under arrest
You have the right to remain silent
Will you relax
(
) (irritated) Don't do that
Edwards whirls around to see Jeebs' , growing another head
Only takes four or five seconds
Kay calmly shoves his gun up against Jeebs' baby-soft new cheek
(') Do you know how much that hurts
Show us what you got, Jeebs
Or 'll use up another one
Jeebs, panicked, hits a button on the underside of the counter, which promptly flips over, revealing yet another dusty shelf, piled high with junk -- -- but this is all alien junk
Weapons, mostly, bizarre, otherworldly weapons of all shapes and sizes
Edwards
Edwards, still dazed by Jeebs' regrown head, glances down at all the weapons
Uh, this
This is what  saw
Kay looks at Jeebs, pissed off
You sold a carbonizer with implosion capacity to an unlicensed cephlapoid
He looked all right to me
carbonizer is an assassin's weapon, Jeebs
Who was the target
don't know
Kay raises the weapon again, threatening
Jeebs
don't know
Kay lowers his gun, gestures to the shelf full of weapons
This is all confiscated
All of it
want you on the next transport off this rock
Or 'll shoot you where it doesn't grow back
Jeebs nods, point taken
Kay leaves
Yeah
'll be by tomorrow for those Rolexes
Shaken, Edwards follows
-- Edwards staggers out of the shop, trying to get the day's events straight in his head
The eyelids, fine
and the jumping thing and the gun
okay, but the head
Searching for a handle on the moment here
place to file all this
See a head doesn't do that, it doesn't just grow back
(looking up) What's going on
Can't help you, kid
Only comfort  can offer is that tomorrow, you won't remember a thing
Oh, no
This 'm gonna remember for a long, long time
Kay pulls the neuralyzer from his pocket
He hesitates for the briefest of moments -- as if this particular neuralyzation is different than all the others
Then he puts on his sunglasses
Ever see one of these
: - -- the flash dims on  and , sitting at a table in a Chinese restaurant
(finishing a joke) -- and the wife says yeah, Harry,  know, but this one's eating my popcorn
He busts out laughing
Edwards, across from him, is completely disoriented
He looks down
There's a half-eaten order of broccoli beef and several empty bottles of beer on the table in front of him
Huh
Kay checks his watch
Whoops
Gotta run
Thanks for the egg rolls
Where am
See what  mean about tequila
You're a bright young man, James
Just lay off the sauce
'll see you tomorrow, nine a
m
sharp
He turns and walks out
Edwards checks his watch
appears
Another beer
Coffee
Please
She walks off
Edwards looks at the table
There is a business card lying next to his plate, on which Kay has handwritten "James
Edwards, Saturday, 9 a
m
, 504 Battery Drive
" Edwards looks at it, puzzled
He turns the card over and looks at the other side
There's not much there, no name, no phone or fax number, no e-mail address
Just three little letters, dead in the middle of the card: : - lonely farmhouse stands amid the fields of upstate New York farm country
Several lights are on and through a window we can see the silhouette of a  sitting at the kitchen table, the silhouette of a hovering over him, bringing things to him
The Man () waves his arms, ranting
(
) go out,  work my butt off to make a living, all  want is to come home to a nice clean house with a nice fat steak on the table, but instead  get this -- this --  don't even know what you call this
In the sky above, it's one of those brilliant star fields
But something strange is happening with one of those stars -- it's getting bigger
(
) 'll tell you what it looks like, it looks like poison
Don't you take that away, 'm eating that, damn it
It is poison, isn't it
No, that star isn't getting bigger, it's moving
Toward us
Fast
It goes from a pinpoint to a dime, to a nickel, to a quarter, and works its way into fruit metaphors
(
) swear to God,  would not be surprised if it was, the way you skulk around here like a dog been hit too much -- or ain't been hit enough,  can't make up my mind
Okay, we're way past watermelon now, that thing is huge, and it's starting to glow hot red as it enters the earth's atmosphere, headed straight toward us, coming here, to Beatrice and Edgar's place
The blazing fireball barrels through the sky,  off a couple trees -- (
) You're useless, Beatrice
The only thing that pulls its weight around here is my goddamn truck
-- and  right through a pickup truck parked in the driveway concussive  follows, then a geyser of smoke and flame erupts
(
) Stay here
The silhouette of Edgar leaps to its feet, races to the door, and throws it open
Edgar is everything his voice led us to expect -- a nasty, bug-eyed redneck carrying a twelve-gauge shotgun
His mouth agape, he walks across the yard and stares at the hulking shell that was his truck
The skeleton of the truck is still there, but there's a huge, smoldering hole in it, a hole that goes at least ten feet down into the ground
Figures
He walks to the truck and touches the door handle
Hot
Using his shirt tail, he opens the door and peers down into the hole
, he sees a smooth curve of metal and a few blinking lights
Embedded into the ground is, indeed, a spaceship, maybe eight feet across
calls from behind him, standing in the doorway fearfully
What is it, Edgar
(turns to her) Get your big butt back in that house
Beatrice does as she's told, closing the door behind her
Edgar turns back to the smoldering rock, raising his shotgun in defense comes from deep in the hole
(
) Place projectile weapon on ground
Edgar staggers back a step, terrified
But then he regains himself, raises the weapon, and steps forward, pointing it menacingly down into the hole
You can have my gun when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers
There is a pause while the voice thinks about this offer
Finally, it responds, in a voice and cadence remarkably similar to Edgar's
(
) Your proposal is acceptable
long, hairy pincer flashes out of the hole, grabs Edgar by the head, and pulls him down into the hole
From deep in the hole, we hear a terrible  sound, like a bedsheet being torn in half
There are some disgusting  sounds, then a moment later, something flies out of the hole and  onto the ground next to the truck
It's Edgar
Well, sort of
His body parts still hang together -- face, arms, legs, even clothes -- but everything inside has been removed and now he just lies there, flat and empty, like a tuxedo on the floor after the prom
The shotgun flies out and lands beside him
: -  - sits at the kitchen table, terrified, still wiping away tears from Edgar's diatribe
The door opens and  comes back into the kitchen, seemingly fleshed out again, leaving the door hanging open behind him
He carries the shotgun
She looks up at him, anxious
But his face is a blank
What on earth was it
He looks at her strangely
When he speaks, his voice is different than before
More refined
Sugar
Pause
She looks out the window, at the smoking truck
've never seen sugar do that
Give me sugar
Puzzled, Beatrice gets up, goes to the cabinet, and grabs a bag of sugar
She holds it out to him
(') In water
Frightened, she takes a glass of water from the table
She dumps some of the sugar into it
(') More
She puts more, till the glass is brimming
She stirs it quickly with a knife and hands it to him, her hand trembling
Edgar takes it and downs it in a single gulp
Beatrice stares at Edgar, no idea what to think
She notices something odd about the skin on his neck
Edgar, your skin
It's -- it's -- just hanging off your bones
Edgar drops the glass and looks in a window, to catch his reflection
He reaches up -- -- and twists his whole face, as if adjusting a ski mask, then tucks the skin of his neck back into his shirt collar
He looks at her
That better
Beatrice faints
- Stillness
Silence
loud  sound comes from the pit left by the spaceship
The nose of the ship itself rises up out of the pit, wavers, keeps moving, and finally  to the ground outside the pit
climbs out of the pit, breathing heavily
He dusts himself off and continues pushing the ship, along the ground, off into the darkness
: - The next morning
, holding the small  business card in his hand, compares the address written down by Kay to the address on the utterly nondescript building in front of him
It's seven stories high, gray, windowless, perfectly square, squatting on a bridge over a road like a fat guy on the john
"504 Battery Drive
" -    - steps through a heavily barred metal door and into long, bizarre room
One wall is entirely dominated by the enormous blades of a tunnel vent air intake
There is an elevator at the far end of the room and an , the rent-a-cop kind, reading a comic book on a folding metal chair halfway across
Edwards walks across the room, his footsteps
The Guard looks up
Help you
Maybe, 'm not sure, see,  got this card -- Elevator
Push the "call" button
And he goes back to his comic book
Edwards, maybe out of nothing more than curiosity at this point, walks across the room, toward the elevator
As he draws close, the elevator doors  open, expecting him
-   - Edwards steps inside and turns around
The doors close
He pushes the "call" button and waits, but the elevator doesn't move
Instead, doors on the other side of the elevator slide open silently behind him
Edwards waits, unaware
From behind him, somebody clears their throat
Edwards turns around, and finds himself standing in -- -   - This back room is every bit as mysterious and unfamiliar as the entryway
Standing at the front of the room is , a wire-haired career -man, an old school bureaucrat, wearing the exact same kind of suit Kay had on last night
sit in egg-shaped chairs, staring at Edwards
One chair is empty
You're late
Sit down
Edwards takes the remaining chair
The elevator doors slide shut
Zed continues addressing the Recruits
(') My name is Zed
You're all here because you're the best of the best
Marines, Navy , Army Rangers
They all turn and regard Edwards a little smugly
He gives it back
(') And we're looking for one of you
Just one
What will follow is a series of simple tests designed to quantify motor skills, hand-eye coordination, concentration, stamina --  see we have a question
Edwards's hand is, indeed, up
Why, uh -- 'm sorry, it's just no one really asked this, but -- why, exactly, are we doing this
Silence
Then one of the young recruits eagerly raises his hand
Zed calls on him
Son
(loud and formal) Jake Jensen, West Point, graduate with honors
We're here because you're looking for the best of the best of the best, sir
Edwards tries to stifle a laugh, but can't
What's so funny, Edwards
--  don't know, sir
This guy
"Best of the best of the best of the best of the --" (realizing nobody is with him on this) It just struck me as -- (totally serious) Humorous
Sir
Short pause
Then Zed continues
Okay
Let's get going
-   -  - The recruits scribble away at the written test
It's a thick document -- reasoning skills, general knowledge, diagrams
The  seem to be really powering through it, filling in answer after answer
But no desks have been provided for them, and they're all still in their chairs, writing uncomfortably on their thighs or knees
is really struggling
He writes two words on one answer, then decides to erase it
The lack of a writing surface is driving him crazy; his pencil even  through the page
He looks up
In the middle of the tile floor, there is an unused table
Edwards gets up, goes to it, grabs hold -- -- and drags it,  , back to his chair
Everybody looks up, wincing at the horrible sound that fills the room
Edwards sits back down, now writing on the table
That's better
Zed raises an eyebrow
He stares at Edwards, then looks up, toward a smoked glass window
Behind the dark glass, a  stands, staring, unemotional
: --   -- rest on a table in the middle of an otherwise empty, triangular room
The   stand in front of the table
There's an odd moment -- where everyone sort of looks around: at each other, at the blank walls
Anyone, uh
any of you guys know what we're doing here
(clipped, unquestioning) Looking for the best of the best of the best
(can't help but smile) Well, yeah,  know, but
And then
suddenly -- The two far walls pull apart
The whole room pulsates and the air is suddenly filled with a bewildering swirl of stroboscopic images, both human and alien
Everywhere is color, light and movement -- a holographic mass of strange shapes and characters moving simultaneously
The Recruits lunge for the weapons, snapping them up and taking aim are fired at once
And then, a second later, a   is fired
Everyone sort of looks at Edwards, who puts his gun down last
There's an awkward silence
Then the door opens
Light pours in, and with it
Even the highly competitive cadets can't help but feel some sympathy as Zed walks straight to Edwards
The hell happened
Hesitated, sir
Zed looks into the gallery
Most obvious in the frozen tableau of creatures is a lunging, snarling beast, which has three bullet holes in its chest
Next to it is a massively deformed humanoid creature with a large hook for a head, which also has three holes in it
In the back corner of the gallery, there is a single bullet hole in a pretty eight-year-old girl
May  ask why you felt little Tiffany deserved to die
She was the only one who actually seemed dangerous
At the time
And how did you come to that conclusion
Hook-head guy
You explain to me how he can think with a hook for a head
Answer; it's not his head
His head is that butt-ugly bean-bag thing over there
'Cause if you look at the snarling beast-guy, he's not snarling, he's sneezing -- he's got tissues in his hand
No threat there, and anyhow, the girl's books were way too advanced for an eight-year-old's
And besides, from where 'm looking, she was the only one who appeared to have a motive
And  don't appreciate your jumping down my throat about it
Sideways glances from the other recruits
Zed sighs
(') Or, uh -- do  owe her an apology
: -  /  - and  stand behind smoked glass, staring at the , who are still in the shooting gallery, waiting for a decision
He's got a real problem with authority
So do
The guy ran down a cephlapoid, Zed
On foot
Tenacity
That  can use
hope you know what you're doing
Zed turns and walks away
Kay stares through the glass, at , who stands alone on one side of the room, apart from the rest of the group
Zed reappears on the other side of the glass, coming through a door and into the shooting gallery
As he talks, Kay turns and walks off
(') Congratulations, you're everything we've come to expect from years of government training
Now, if you'll just follow me, we have one more test to administer, an eye exam
-  - The  follow  out of the shooting gallery and into a long hallway
Zed motions them off to the left
is the last one out of the room, but he stops as he steps into the hallway
is outside the door, waiting for him
Edwards recognizes him from last night
You
Hey, what's goin' on
The other recruits continue down the hall with Zed
Kay doesn't answer, just gestures to Edwards to follow him down the hall, which he does
Back in the mid-fifties, the government started a little underfunded agency with the simple and laughable purpose of making contact with a race not of this planet
As they pass an alcove, Edwards notices the six other Recruits, who have been herded into a corner
Zed, addressing them, pulls a neuralyzer from his pocket
Now, if you'll look directly at the end of this device
He holds a neuralyzer up in front of them, and the Recruits stare obediently at it as Zed slips on a pair of black sunglasses
Edwards stares, fascinated, but Kay's hand reaches in and yanks him away, just as Zed's neuralyzer
-  - As  leads  down an impossibly long corridor, he hands him a file folder stuffed thick with eight by ten photographs
He hands Jay the first picture, a shot of eight or nine  in plain black suits standing around a fifties-style office with metal desks and fluorescent lights
and  are there, much younger
Everybody thought the agency was a joke
Except the aliens
They made contact on March 2nd, 1961, outside New  York City
Another photograph, a grainy black and white image of two ships hovering in the night sky -- classic flying saucer shapes
(') There were nine of us that night
Seven agents
An amateur astronomer
And one poor kid who got lost on the wrong back road
Yet another photograph, this one showing a young , in a shirt and tie, holding a bouquet of flowers, staring at the open door of the landed flying saucer
are visible within
You brought the aliens flowers
Kay steers Edwards to the right, down another corridor, just as long as the first
They were intergalactic refugees with a simple request
Let us use the earth as an apolitical zone for people without a planet
Ever see "Casablanca
" Same thing, no Nazis
We agreed
So we masked all evidence of their landing
Another picture, this one of the 1964 World's Fair grounds, still under construction
Giant models of rockets mark the Fair's theme of space travel; most prominent in the construction are two tall towers, with the flying saucers now mounted at the top of each
The 1964 World's Fair was a coverup
Why else would we hold it in Queens
(another hallway) Now left
More nonhumans arrive every year
They live among us, in secret
see
Not to change the subject, but when was your last cat-scan
Every six months; it's company policy
Well, thanks for the very amusing morning, but 'm hopin' you'll show me where  came in
'Cause this is where  go out
They have stopped next to an unmarked door
Kay throws it open and steps inside
Yeah, sure, hang on,  wanna grab a coffee while we're right here
As Kay walks into the kitchenette, Edwards' jaw drops, his eyes widen, and he stares in wonderment -- -- at  -  standing around a water cooler
Tall, impossibly thin, most certainly not from New York, the aliens hold an animated conversation in a language that seems like a combination of Esperanto and microphone feedback
(') (to the aliens) Don't tell me we've only got that powdered shit for cream again
One of the Worm Aliens answers him in their native tongue and points to the counter
(') Oh
He finds the cream sitting out on the counter where the alien indicated, dumps some in his coffee, and comes back outside, closing the door behind him
He reaches up and gently pushes Edwards' jaw up, closing his mouth
(') For future reference, this is a better look for you
: - , thrown for a major loop, sits like a zombie alongside  on a bench in Battery Park
Kay drinks his coffee while they talk
Any given time, around fifteen hundred landed aliens are on the planet, the majority right here in Manhattan
Most aliens are decent enough, just trying to make a living
Cab drivers
Not as many as you'd think
Humans, for the most part, don't have a clue
Don't want one, either
They're happy
They think they've got a pretty good bead on things
Why the big secret
People are smart, they can handle it
person is smart
People are dumb
Everything they've ever "known" has been proven to be wrong
thousand years ago everybody knew as a fact, that the earth was the center of the universe
Five hundred years ago, they knew it was flat
Fifteen minutes ago, you knew we humans were alone on it
Imagine what you'll know tomorrow
So what's the catch
What you'll gain in perspective, you'll lose in ways you're too young to comprehend
You give up everything
Sever every human contact
No one will know you exist
Ever
Nobody
You're not even allowed a favorite shirt
There
That's the speech  never heard
That's the choice  never got
Hold up
You track me down, put me through those stupid-ass tests, now you're trying to talk me out of it
don't get it
You got 'til sun-up
Is it worth it
You find out, you let me know
: - Almost nighttime now, and the park is empty
is still on the bench
And still thinking
Above him, the stars are coming out
Slowly, he looks up, into the vastness of the heavens
: - The next morning
door opens on a garage and an   steps inside, carrying a tank of toxic gas
The morning light spills on an abundance of spiders, crawling everywhere -- big ones, small ones, hundreds of them have moved in and taken over this dusty place
The Orkin Man sighs and sets down his tank
Well, well, well
Movin' right in, are we
Think we own the place
He unfurls a hose from the side of the tank
(') Got a little eviction notice for you, boys
He raises a mask to his face and unscrews the handle on the top of the tank
starts to  from the end of the hose
(
) Just what exactly do you think you're doing
The Orkin Man turns around
stands in the doorway to the garage, staring at him disdainfully
(shrugs) Takin' care of your pest problem
"Pest" problem
"Pest
" Yeah
You got a hell of an infestation
Edgar advances on him, slowly
You know,  have noticed an infestation here
Everywhere  look, in fact
Nothing but undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious pond scum
So convinced of their own superiority as they scurry about their short, pointless lives
Well -- yeah
Don't you want to get rid of 'em
In the worst way
Edgar lashes out quickly, jerking the mask off the Orkin Man's face with one hand -- -- and shoving the gas hose down his throat with the other
'   drop to the garage floor, and Edgar picks them up
- six-by-ten sheet of plywood  to the driveway outside the garage
raises one end of it so it's hanging off the back end of the Orkin man's van -- now it's a ramp
He walks off and we hear that familiar  sound again
Edgar, with the effort, slowly pushes his spaceship up the ramp and into the back of the Orkin truck
: -    - stands in the middle of the tunnel vent room, the same one he first came into yesterday
The elevator doors open and , obviously summoned by the   , stands waiting for him
One thing you gotta know right now
Edwards walks briskly forward and gets in the elevator with Kay
-  - Inside the elevator, the doors  shut,  turns a key in a certain floor number, and the descent begins
continues
All right
'm in because there's some next-level shit going on around here, and 'm with that
Before you beam me up, there are a couple of things we need to get straight
You chose me 'cause you recognize the skills
So as of now you can cease with all of that calling me "son" or "kid" or "sport
" Cool
Cool, slick
Now about those skills of yours, The elevator doors -- -  - -- slide open on Men in Black headquarters
As of this moment, they don't mean much
It's unlike anything we've ever seen -- huge, multileveled, of sixties design, polished steel and glass
The workplaces are sleek and uncluttered, manned by both  and
Most of the Aliens stay in the background, like the -  who walks on the ceiling, shuffling papers
and  step off the elevator and onto a platform that looks out over the whole place
Kay leads him down into the complex
First, they walk past a sort of passport control center, where a human  at a desk is checking the documents of a line of  who've just arrived
There are a dozen bizarre life forms in that line,  in half a dozen different alien tongues
Edwards slows as they pass, listening to the    as he addresses an , a large, humanoid visitor
Purpose of trip
Diplomatic mission
Duration of stay
Lunch
Carrying any fruits or vegetables
Edwards just stares, fascinated, but Kay grabs him by the arm and hurries him along
Let's go
He's a little
grouchy
Kay moves him into the central hall
couple of hours wait after a 17-light-year flight would get on anybody's nerves
What branch of the government do we report to
None
They started asking too many questions
So who pays for all this
Oh, we hold a few patents on gadgets we confiscated from our out-of-state visitors
Velcro
Microwave Ovens
Liposuction
, Kay turns a key in the lock of a caged-in area and throws the door open
Inside, there are piles of sophisticated-looking devices stacked on shelves and tabletops
(picking something up) Here
new recording device to replace 's
So now  gotta buy the White Album again
(something else) This is amusing
Universal translator
He holds up a cylindrical metal tube and a small wire clip that looks like a lapel microphone
(') We're not supposed to have it
'll tell you why
Human thought is so primitive it's considered an infectious disease
Makes you proud, doesn't it
Edwards picks up a small yellow ball from one of the shelves
What's this
(') Don't touch that
'  -- it flies out into the main complex -- hits the ceiling and ricochets around the room, faster than the eye can follow -- ducking, dodging, and jumping out of its way
as he calmly, a little wearily, slips an odd-looking metal glove over his right hand
He raises his hand and the yellow ball zings into it -- Kay catches the ball, calmly
(') Caused the '77 New York blackout
Practical joke by the Great Attractor
He thought it was funny as hell
They leave the room
Sorry
, they walk briskly across the room, reaching a giant screen on the far wall
Observation, the heart of our little endeavor
The screen displays a map of the world on which thousands of tiny lights blink in all parts of the globe, log lines of data flashing next to them
(') This map shows the location of every registered alien on earth at any given time
Some of them we keep under constant surveillance
He hits a button on the console and the map is replaced by hundreds of boxes, each with smaller video images
(') Everyone on these screens is an alien
In public -- normal
In private -- you'll get the idea
, we see live images of aliens
Aliens who look alien are in spots where they can't be seen
Aliens who look human are functioning right out in public -- including
And (') Meet the twins
Kay gestures to two small, bony  with eight arms each and a single eye growing out of a central stalk in their heads
They turn around and wave two or three arms each
gotta be honest about something
It makes no sense
It makes perfect sense
When  was a third grader in Philadelphia, they told me  was crazy 'cause  swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something
Mrs
Edelson
Edwards, stunned, looks at Kay as 4-Eyes boots her onto the screen: Mean face, cat glasses
Bony fingers
Extremely well-hidden tail
Jupiter, actually
Well, one of the moons
With their remaining arms, they punch button after button on the enormous console
, who was standing up close to the screen, walks over to Edwards, sizing him up
What's your jacket size, Edwards
Uh -- forty regular
Then let's put it on
Put what on
The last suit you'll ever wear
: -   - Like the rest of the place, the  locker room is all white
White walls, white floor, white ceiling, white lockers
'  comes over: (
) From now on, you'll dress only in attire specially sanctioned by  Special Services
reaches out and opens a white locker, revealing a   hung from a hanger in the middle
Above it, on the shelf, a   and a pair of
On the bottom, a pair of
-  - is at a computer terminal
On screen are Edwards's birth certificate, driver's license, social security card, library card, everything
' continues: (
) You'll conform to the identity we give you, eat where we tell you, live where we tell you, get approval for any expenditure over a hundred dollars
- stands in a cramped white booth
He holds both his hands on a - , pressing down hard
The pad glows red, a  sound comes from his hands, and he grimaces as more lasers instantly and (not at all) painlessly change his fingerprints
(
) You will have no identifying marks of any kind
You will not stand out in any way
-  - One by one,  deletes Edwards's identity cards
On the computer screen is Edwards' full name --
Kay punches a couple keys, and the cursor begins to sweep from right to left, starting to eliminate the rightmost letters of Edwards's name
(
) Your entire image is carefully crafted to leave no lasting memory whatsoever with anyone you encounter
-   - Pants come off the hanger
The white shirt is removed
More letters are eliminated from his name
It reads "
" then "
" (
) You're a rumor, recognizable only as deja vu and dismissed just as quickly
You don't exist; you were never even born
The coat is removed
The hat comes off the shelf
(
) Anonymity is your name
Silence your native tongue
"
" "
" (
) You are no longer part of "the system
" We're above the system
Over it
Beyond it
Feet slip into black shoes
belt is buckled
tie pushed up
(
) We're "them
" We're "they
" On screen, all that's left is the letter "
" As the coat is buttoned, we notice the sleeve
Monogrammed on the cuff is, simply, the letter "
" (
) We are the Men in Black
-  - Looking slick and handsome in his extremely sharp suit, -- or, rather,  -- steps into the doorway from the locker room
He reaches into his pocket, takes out the sunglasses, and looks at
The difference between you and me
He slips on the sunglasses
(') make this look good
: - We are looking at a telephoto shot of Manhattan in all its splendor
We see the Orkin van topping a hill, heading towards Manhattan
- '  - Zed's office is a circular, windowed room elevated above the main floor of headquarters
and  sit across the desk from Zed
There are five video monitors on a wall behind Zed's desk, and on each monitor is another Man in Black, in different parts of the world, the city name and a clock ticking in a corner of the image
While Zed talks, he goes through paperwork on his desk
Okay, let's see
(to one of the monitors) Bee, we got the deposed sur-prefect of Sinalee touching down in the forest outside Portland tonight
'm pulling you down from Anchorage to do a meet-and-greet
, an agent on one of the monitors, nods
Humanoid
You wish
Bring a sponge
(going through memos) What else -- everybody, we gotta keep Rolling Fish-Goat out of the sewer system, he's scaring the rats
And Bobo the Squat wants to reveal himself on "Unsolved Mysteries
" Bee, make sure he doesn't
He turns a page, coming across a red memo
(') Red-letter from last night -- we had an un-authorized landing somewhere in upstate New York farm country
Keep your ears open for this one, Kay, we're not hosting a galactic kegger down here
Next to him, his computer screen  importantly
Zed looks over at it
Well, well, well -- we got a skimmer
(to Jay) Landed alien out of zone
(to Zed) Who is it
Redgick
He's not cleared to leave Manhattan but he's way out of town right now, stuck in traffic on the New Jersey Turnpike
Why don't you take Jay
This is a good one for him to warm up on
-   - and  come out the front of  headquarters
Yo, wussup with Zed
(imitating him) "Go get em, tiger
We're not hosting an intergalactic kegger
" Zed was saving the world before you were born, son
Show some respect
An   pulls up in Kay's black  and hops out, leaving the door open
Jay sizes up the car
We got the use of unlimited technology from the entire universe and we cruise around in this
Kay glares at Jay
He's getting annoyed
- They get in and slam the doors
Kay starts the car and the engine quietly
Seat belt
You know, ya'll gotta learn how to talk to people
You could be a little kinder and gentler
Kay grits his teeth
Buckle up, please
Now did that hurt
Kay shifts the car into reverse
The awesome power of the car kicks in and Jay sails forward,  into the dash
Kay shifts into forward and taps the gas,  Jay back into his seat
Makin' fun of my ride
rotates into place between the two front seats
Jay's hand falls by accident on a flashing red button in the panel
Jay
The button
Yeah
Never push the button, Jay
Jay jerks his hand away
: -     - The  is now stopped by the side of the road, dust swirling around it
Ahead of it, another car has pulled over
gets out,  follows a moment later, shaky-legged
Kay walks up to the window of the car they've stopped
The , a guy in his mid-thirties with a  in her mid-thirties, rolls the window down
License and registration, please
The Driver hands over some documents
Kay flips through them
(') Other license and registration, please
The guy digs out two other cards and hands those over
Jay peers over Kay's shoulder
The photographs on the "  "cards are of two friendly-looking reptile types, husband and wife, smiling atthe camera, their long, skinny tongues dangling in a friendly sort of way
Kay hands them back
(') Your resident card has you restricted to the five boroughs only
Where do you think you're going
It's my wife
She's -- she's -- well, look
Kay leans down and looks in the window
is in front, in pain, holding her swollen belly
Kay straightens up, fast
Oh God
How soon
Mrs
Redgick  in pain
Real soon
For the first time since we've seen him, Kay is nervous
(') Okay
All right
No big deal
(to Jay) You handle it
Me
Sure, it's easy, you just sorta -- catch
Mrs
Redgick  again
Redgick gets out of the car, worried
Are you sure he knows what he's doing
Yeah, hell, sure, he does this all the time
'mon, let him work, Redgick,  wanna ask you something
Kay gives Jay a supportive  on the back and leads Redgick away, to the rear of the car
Jay stays in the background and opens the rear door, tentatively
He leans down, into the car
Oh God
see it  see it  see it
few yards from the car, Kay turns Redgick to face him
Croagg the Midwife's back on 64th and 8th
You were headed out of town
Well, we're, uh -- meeting someone
Suddenly a  whips out from between Mrs
Redgick's legs,  the whip once, and wraps around the door post, grabbing hold
Oh sweet Jesus Mother of God did you see that
(still to Redgick) So
Who you meeting
Well, it's -- a ship
Really
didn't see a departure clearance for today
You didn't
Uh, well -- it was an emergency
Now a   whips out, but this one wraps around Jay's neck and pulls tight
He , choking
Guys -- guys -- Doin' fine, Ace
(back to Redgick) What kind of emergency
What's the rush to get off the planet all of a sudden
(choking to death) Help
Hello
He starts tugging for all he's worth, but the fight is sort of going against him, as the tentacles pull him in even harder than he tries to pull the baby out
We just don't like the neighborhood anymore
Some of the -- new arrivals
Redgick looks at Kay, clearly concealing something, but darts his eyes away
What new arrivals
This have anything to do with the crasher from last night
(Screaming) Can you guys do this later
But in that moment, Jay finally gets a foot up on the door frame, acquires leverage, and  the baby free
He falls, flat on his back in the dirt, the multi-tentacled lizardlike baby resting squarely on his chest
(') Oh -- oh -- oh -- man
Kay turns and claps Redgick on the back
Congratulations
It's a lizard
Jay looks down at the creature  and nestling on his chest
(misty) Hey, you know, it is sorta -- It vomits on him
: -     -   - Back in the car,  wipes the last of the puke off his suit while starts up the car
Anything about that seem unusual to you
Jay just looks at him, very Jack Benny
Pick
What kind of "new arrival" would scare Redgick so bad that he'd risk a warp jump with a newborn
(thinks) Let's check the hot sheets
- on various supermarket tabloids as a hand flips through them
There are headlines like "
"and "   -- " and "
" (the subhead on that one is "And That's Just the Appetizer, Says Neighbor
") and  are at a downtown newsstand
Kay is furiously searching through the tabs; Jay is standing behind him, a little embarrassed
These are the hot sheets
Kay pulls a copy of the Weekly World News from the stand and gives the guy a buck
Best damn investigative reporting on the planet
But hey, go ahead, read the New York Times if you want
They get lucky sometimes
You're actually looking for tips in a supermarket tabloid
Not looking for
Found
He  the paper down on the hood in front of Jay, the pages turned open to a headline in typeface so large one would think it reserved for the Second Coming: Farm wife says "   '
" : -   - flap of skin, now getting gray and crusty with age, hangs off 's neck as he sits in the front of his Orkin van
He sucks as hard as he possibly can on a straw stuck into a Jolt Cola ("Double the Sugar
Triple the Caffeine
"), one of a six-pack that sits on the dashboard
Across the street, Edgar sees a short, older man come out of one of the jewelry shops on Thirty-Fifth Street
Edgar drops the soda and stares
The Older Man (), is carrying a cat and an ornate rosewood jewelry box
Carefully, he sets the box down and lovingly places the cat on top of it while he locks all five locks on the door to his distinctive shop
That finished, he picks up the cat, then the box, then waddles off down the street, one under each arm
Edgar drops the truck into gear and follows him, slowly, trolling along behind him
, Rosenberg walks happily along,  to himself
He gives his cat a little peck
As he rounds a corner, we recognize the tune he's humming -- "'ve Got the Whole World In My Hands
" The Orkin van rounds the corner behind him
Following
: - The  pulls to a stop at the end of the driveway that leads to Beatrice's farmhouse, where the alien ship landed
The wrecked pickup truck is still there
and  get out, very undercover cop
Jay starts up the driveway
Not so fast
Walk up slow
Why
Part of the routine
Makes it look like we're sizing up the situation
Gives her time to get the wrong impression
appears in the door to the house, curious
(') Puts some fear into her
Makes things go smoother
Beatrice calls to them
Can  help you gentlemen
Beatrice looks much better than the last time we saw her -- more nicely dressed, a touch of makeup, a smile on her face
Kay pulls a black card from his wallet and extends it to her as she draws close
As she reaches for it, the card reforms into an  badge
How do you do, ma'am, 'm Special Agent Manheim, this is Agent Black,
Had a few questions about your visitor
Are you here to make fun of me too
No ma'am
We at the  don't have a sense of humor that we're aware of
Mind if we come in
Sure
Lemonade
: -   - In the living room,  sips some of her lemonade and winces
moves through the room, checking it out as  tells her story
And they said to me, "If he was murdered, how could he walk back in the house
" And must admit,  was a little stumped by that one
But  know Edgar
And that wasn't him
It was more like something else that was wearing him
Like a suit
An Edgar suit
little  escapes her at the thought
Jay, over by a bookcase, notices a framed   , kneeling in the woods, proudly about to skin a deer
Damn
If he was this ugly before he was an alien
Sorry
Go on
Anyway, when  came to, he was gone
Did he say anything
Yes
He asked for water
Sugar water, if remember
Sugar water
Did you taste her lemonade
Kay nods, puts on his sunglasses
Takes out another pair, hands them to Jay
Kay draws his neuralyzer
Beatrice freezes, staring straight ahead as if hypnotized
Kay takes Jay's glasses off and hands them back to him
Ray Bans
(pulling off Jay's sunglasses) Okay, Beatrice
There was no alien, and the flash of light you saw in the sky wasn't a Swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted the light from Venus -- Whoa
That thing erases her memory, and you give her a new one
Standard issue neuralyzer
And that's the best you can come up with
On a more personal note, Beatrice, Edgar ran off with on old girlfriend
Go stay at your mother's for a few days and get over it
Decide you're better off
(butting in) Yeah, and you're better off 'cause he never appreciated you anyway
In fact, you kicked him out, and now that he's gone, you ought to buy some new clothes, maybe hire a decorator or something
: - is in the hole where the ship landed, investigating
He holds a pocket spectral analyzer over a section of scorched earth
The analyzer shifts colors
Red
Then Yellow
(from up outside the hole) Hey
Kay
when am  gonna get one of those memory things
The spectral analyzer turns blue
When you're ready
(re: analyzer) Please -- not green
Purple
And then green
Kay closes his eyes and sits back, leaning against the dirt
Above him, leans over, staring down
Kay looks up at him
(') Do you know what alien life form leaves a green spectral trail
Wait -- don't tell me -- that was the question on Final Jeopardy last night
, Kay snatches up the radio handset and keys the microphone
(softly, into mic) Zed, we have a bug
He turns off the radio and sighs
Jay stands next to him
'm gonna jump way past you and just guess that this is bad
Right
Bugs thrive on carnage, Tiger
They consume, infest and destroy
They live off the death and decay of other species
So basically you have a racial problem with all insect-based life forms
Listen, kid -- imagine a giant cockroach five times smarter than Albert Einstein, four times stronger than an ox, nine times meaner than hell, strutting his stuff around Manhattan Island in his brand new Edgar suit
Does that sound like fun
What do we do
With a bug in town
Watch the morgues
: '  - , the jewelry store owner, steps out of a cab in the meat-packing district, still carrying the ornate box and his beloved cat
He heads into Leshko's, a Russian diner
moment later, the Orkin van pulls to a stop across the street
'  - comes into the tiny restaurant, squinting in the relative darkness
At a table in the middle, he sees a man eating alone -- an enormous, dignified, yet profoundly strange-looking man in his mid fifties
Rosenberg walks carefully over to the table, but does not sit down
The man (an , and if we're eagle-eyed, we recognize him as the alien on a "diplomatic mission" from passport control) rises from his chair
He steps forward, to face Rosenberg, who sets the ornate box on the table
Immediately, '  jumps on top of it
Rosenberg and the Arquillian stare at each other for a long moment -- -- and then embrace each other
The embrace has an odd, formal quality to it, like mafiosi coming to a sitdown
They hold on, long and hard, and both seemed choked with emotion
Finally, they break apart and take their seats
They speak in a bizarre alien tongue, which is subtitled
Rosenberg wipes away tears
Sorry 'm late
The cab drivers on this planet are terrible
Your majesty, you are in grave danger
Yeah, and they overcharge you every time
Sir, a bug landed here
We must get you off the planet
bug
He must know why 'm here
We think he does
(noticing the ornate box on the table) Is that what  think it is
No, just some diamonds for your children
Do we have time to eat
The Arquillian relaxes
Sure
ordered you some pirogi
'  -  - In the kitchen, the Russian  slaps two orders of pirogi up on the stainless steel counter -- Table six is up
-- and turns away, back to the grill
reaches in, takes the plates, and sets them on a tray
We follow the tray, but see only the right arm and aproned midsection of the waiter carrying it
He carries the tray along the counter toward a pair of swinging doors that lead out into the restaurant
The doors swing in as another  sweeps into the kitchen, and our waiter heads out into the dining area
As the doors swing closed behind him, they reveal storage shelves crammed with bags of rice, cans of stewed tomatoes -- -- and a  , literally folded in half and stuffed in among the shelves
'  - and the  raise their glasses in a toast
To the continued reign of the Arquillian Empire
To the safety of the galaxy
They  glasses and drink, just as the Waiter arrives
Still, we see only his arms and midsection as he sets the tray on a stand and lifts the plates of pirogi
He carries them to the table and sets them down
Rosenberg, setting his glass down next to the plate, catches a glimpse of the Waiter's hand -- -- just as an enormous silverfish bug slithers out of the waiter's sleeve and scurries across the table
The glass slips out of Rosenberg's hand, dumping wine all over the table
He looks up, slowly, and sees the Waiter's face
It's
Another half dozen insects of all variety tumble out of Edgar's sleeves and scurry across the table
Rosenberg and the Arquillian freeze, paralyzed with fear
They seem to know what dire implications Edgar's presence holds
(in English again) You can kill us both -- but you will not find it
Edgar smiles
You're right about one thing
Suddenly a long  whips out from under the back of Edgar's apron and zips under the table
First Rosenberg and then the Arquillian lurch forward their chairs, their faces contorting in pain
They both pitch forward, their faces slogging into fresh pirogi
The stinger  out from under the table and whips back under Edgar's apron
He moves quickly, searching their pockets, but he doesn't find what he's looking for
The cat, still perched on top of the ornate box, at him
Edgar reaches out and  the cat away with one vicious swipe of his hand
The animal  and flies across the room, landing in a 's lunch
The Woman
Now other ' attention is drawn to Edgar's table, where two obviously dead men are being robbed by a waiter
There are of outrage, a few  rise out of their seats
Edgar grabs the ornate box and tries to open it, but finds it locked
With the furor rising around him, he shoves the box under one arm and bolts for the door
Rosenberg's cat leaps back onto the table and  at him as he goes
: '  - Later, and the Russian diner is now a crime scene, clustered with  and flashing lights
, now on stretchers and covered with sheets, are being loaded into the back of ambulances
'  races out of a  's arms and leaps onto one of the stretchers,  mournfully
The Uniformed Cop turns to a who is questioning the  from the diner
What am  supposed to do with the cat
don't know
Send it with the stiff
Let family claim it
The Cop nods and follows the stretcher with Rosenberg's body into the back of one of the ambulances, allowing the cat to ride on the chest of its dead owner for the time being
The doors of the wagon  shut
: -  - The stretcher with the corpse on it is wheeled down a corridor in police headquarters
' , still on his chest,  curiously as the stretcher approaches two doors with "City Morgue" written across them
The words split in half as the stretcher  through the doors
- The city morgue is a crowded, brightly-lit, tiled place with corpses parked left and right
Busy day in the Apple
The Cop wheeling the stretcher calls out to the , who's hunched over another body
Where do you want contestant number three
The coroner turns around
It's
, the woman who tried to speak to Jay before
She sighs and waves a hand
By the wall,  guess
(noticing) What's with the cat
Oh, the cat
There's a problem with the cat
Sign here
Laurel signs his clipboard
What's the problem with the cat
Your problem
Laurel gives him a dirty look, but he laughs and leaves
She goes over to the stretcher and bends down, petting Rosenberg's cat gently
Are you having a bad day, baby
Cheer up
(of Rosenberg) His is worse
She sets the cat aside and wheels the stretcher under the lights
(') Okey-dokey
Shall we
-  - Laurel is hunched over the corpse, the only light in the room coming from the overhead spot that illuminates her work
Fascinated by something, she digs deeper
And deeper
And looks up, her face a mixture of alarm and excitement
Oh, my God
: - Kay's  pulls up in front of the morgue
-  - Two men in black suits hurry down the stairs and into the corridor outside the morgue
They hasten down the hallway, their shoes  in perfect lockstep, headed for those swinging doors at the other end
and
Men in Black on a mission
- In the morgue,  has fallen asleep on her desk, her head in her arms
'  sits on the desk next to her, licking its paws
Suddenly, the cat looks up,  urgently
Laurel looks up and, following the cat's gaze, turns around slowly in her chair
and  stand in the doorway, staring at her
Kay steps forward, holding out that black card again
It reforms into another kind of official , this time it says "   " (into recorder) approximately 112 degrees at time of autopsy, indicating, quite impossibly, a post-mortem increase in body temperature
Examiner attempted to verify result rectally, only to find subject was, uh, without rectum
Which can only be described as
well
as really
(
) Weird
Dr
Leo Menville, Department of Public Health
This is Dr
White
She looks up
Jay and Kay are standing there
Yeah, well whoever you are, 'm afraid 'm going to need to see some
He hands her his  , which changes to read "Dr
Menville, Department of Public Health
" She hands it back
(checking her watch) You boys must not have much of a home life
We watch the morgues very carefully
You've got something unusual
'd say so -- triple homicide
She gets up and goes to the Arquillian's body, which is still out on a table under the lights
(') The first corpse was perfectly normal, except that he was broken in half, but when opened up the other two -- well, look
She throws back a sheet, revealing (to them only, not us) the fully dissected Arquillian
Kay raises an eyebrow; Jay nearly retches
(') There's a skeletal structure at work here unlike anything 've ever seen
Kay steps past her, going straight to the body
He begins to examine it
'll have a look at this one
Dr
White, why don't you and Dr
Weaver check out the other body
This way, Doctor
Jay and Laurel cross the room, to where 's corpse lies out on another gurney
(') This one's even stranger
did a full laparotomy
started with the lesser curvature of the stomach -- though, if you want, we could begin at the gastro-esophageal junction
think, uh, we should start at the same place you did
All right
Jay hears a  and looks down
Rosenberg's cat is rubbing up against his leg
Your cat
Guess it is now
Came in with the bodies
She  one of her rubber gloves and reaches down (out of frame), sinking her hands into the body as she moves things aside
Just by the look on Jay's face, one can imagine how disgusting it is
Laurel digs in, up to her elbows
Jay winces
She pulls one bloody glove out, to wipe a strand of hair out of her face
He looks at her -- -- and she winks at him
He's surprised
She laughs
(') Okay
Dive right in
God knows he won't mind
Jay is reluctant, so she rolls her eyes and helps him, taking him by the hand and guiding him into the thick of the corpse
(') You have very pretty eyes
Thank-you, but is this really the time to uh -- you know, come on to me
Hey, just walking the dog
(continuing) Feel that
Where the piloric junction would be
Oh, yes
Exactly
Now push that aside
Notice anything strange
Stomach
Liver
Lungs
Nope
All fine
Doctor, they're all missing
(quickly) Well, of course they are
What 'm pointing out is that there are no pieces of them left
So they're intact, wherever they are
That we can be sure of
Have we met before
have the strangest feeling of deja vu
You know,  was just going to ask you the same thing
Laurel looks at him sideways, skeptical, but also intrigued
She whispers to him
Confiding in him
Okay
You wanna know what  really think
(re: Kay) But don't tell that guy
He looks like he's already under enough stress
(then) This body is not really a body, but it's actually some sort of transport unit for something else altogether
The question is: what
Jay just looks at her intrigued
By the way, stop me if 'm freaking you out
No, no
not at all
After a particularly gross  sound, he looks away, toward her
She's staring at him
Laurel leans over and lowers her voice, just for him
You know what  like to do sometimes
When it's really late
(freaked out) No
From the other side of the room, Kay
(') Excuse me
He walks across the morgue to Kay, who is still examining the Arquillian
But Jay never takes his eyes off Laurel
What do you think
(of Laurel) Very interesting
Got a real Queen of the Undead thing goin' on
Of the body
Great body
The dead body
Not a clue
All right
Keep her occupied
Try not to sound too dumb
, Laurel is still examining Rosenberg, now bent down next to his head, carefully studying his left ear
She notices something strange, turns, and calls over her shoulder to Jay
Dr
White
Jay, in conversation with Kay, does not respond to what is not his name
(') (louder) Dr
White
(still louder) Dr
White
He still doesn't answer
(') (shouting) Kay nudges Jay
You're up, Slugger
Jay turns and races across the room to rejoin her
Look at this
Jay leans down
There is strange stitching around the base of Rosenberg's ear
What is that
He reaches out, touches the ear, then he actually turns it
With a soft -- -- it pulls away from the head
Like a latch
Jay and Laurel look at each other, astonished
Jay pulls again, and Rosenberg's entire face   with a mechanical , then , the whole face rotating out away from the rest of the artificial skull
'
Though not quite dead, the Tiny Little Green Man is gravely wounded
He staggers up out of a small control room inside Rosenberg's head, with gearshifts and viewing screens all around the inside of the skull
Far -- freaking -- out
They lean in closer
The Tiny Little Green Man (a ) forces words out of his mouth
Must -- to pre -- prevent -- (searching for the word) -- contest
No
to prevent -- It's all right -- What are you trying to say
Struggle
War
The Baltian nods vigorously
That's it
(faltering) Galaxy on -- or -- or -- Orion's -- (thinks) What is word
Be
Bed
Belt
Orion's Belt
The Baltian nods again, falls, and dies
Jay and Laurel look at the little dead alien, then at each other
(') "To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's Belt
"  The hell does that mean
(turns around) Hey
Kay
mean, Dr
, uh, whatever, come here
Kay begins over
Laurel looks at them
"Doctor Whatever"
You're not with the Department of Public Health, are you
Jay shakes his head -- but is now paying more attention to Kay, as he leads him toward the Little Man
He's dead
Kay looks at the mess -- the body, the little dead man
Rosenberg
Damn
Good man
You knew him
One of the few  actually liked
Exiled High Prince
was right -- this is an alien life form, and you're from some government agency who wants to keep it under wraps
Kay and Jay are not paying attention to Laurel
He said "to prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's Belt
" This make total sense
How else do you explain New York
The other night 'm in a cab, this guy
Without even looking at her, Kay whips out his neuralyzer and blanks her out
He said there's a galaxy on Orion's Belt
That makes no sense
That's what he said
(to the dazed Laurel) Didn't he
Right after he -- (realizing) Oh, for Christ's sake, you did the flashy thing already
(as if awakening) Uh, hi, whoever you guys are, 'm afraid 'm going to need to see some  if you're going to be in the morgue, okay
Sure thing, sweetheart
Here you go
He neuralyzes her again
Jay slaps his hand
Stop that -- (to Laurel, ignoring Jay) Typical day, too much caffeine, get a life
-- that thing probably gives you brain cancer
Never hurt her before
"Never hurt her before"
How many times have you done the flashy thing to this poor woman
(evasive) Couple
Aren't you worried about, you know, long term damage
(more evasive) Little bit
What the hell happened to make you such a callous son of a bitch
took this job
He heads out
Jay follows
Hey, you never flashed me with that thing, did you
Nah
- Jay and Kay exit the morgue and walk towards their car
Hey, Kay,  really think  should be in charge of the flashy memory thing department
Not while 'm around, Slim
Yeah, well you're a menace with that thing
An  containment vehicle pulls up, and four men dressed in black suits get out
(to an  Agent) We've got two dead aliens in there, and a deputy medical coroner in need of a new memory
: - The Orkin van is parked in an alleyway somewhere downtown
From inside, throaty  of frustration can be heard
Two  hear the racket and hesitate, wondering if they should get involved
But an inhuman  rattles the whole van and they wise up, hurrying on their way
-    - Inside the van, the ornate rosewood box is now battered and scarred, its various locks holding tight against 's repeated attempts to claw his way into it
Crammed into the back of the van along with his spaceship, Edgar wedges a screwdriver into the thin opening between the top and the rest of the box and  it with his right fist
Nothing doing
He  in rage and hurls the box against the side of the van, where it finally  a hinge
Edgar snaps it up, pries the rest of the hinge off with the screwdriver, and wrenches the top off the box
Inside, there are dozens of precious, glittering diamonds, which he promptly tosses aside as worthless
But the rest of the box is empty
No
No, , ,
He rips the box apart with his bare hands
There's nothing else there
: - As lower Manhattan is waking up, Jay and Kay enter the building
-  - Despite the early hour, the headquarters is going full-blast
The large screen displays the familiar grouping of stars that is the Jay and Kay hurry in -- Kay peels off to one of the monitors; Jay heads for Zed
Doesn't anybody believe in sleep around here
The twins keep us on Alpha Centaurian time -- a 37-hour day
Give it a few months -- you'll get used to it
Or you'll have a psychotic episode
He points up at the screen with a laser pencil
Here's Orion; the brightest grouping of stars in the northern sky
(pointing) and here's Orion's belt -- He indicates the three stars that make up the belt
That's what the little guy was talking about, "To prevent war, the galaxy's on Orion's belt
" There are no galaxies on Orion's belt
The belt is just these three stars; galaxies are huge, made up of billions of stars
(switches off the laser pointer) You heard wrong
You're attracted to me, aren't you
Jay starts to cross over to  , where Kay is sitting alone, tie loosened, slightly disheveled
On the screen, the word "" blinks, encouraging patience
The image changes to a satellite view of North America, which quickly zooms in on the Southwest
On screen, the satellite view zooms down to Arizona, then a city, then a neighborhood, then a block, then a back yard
The printout changes to "
" The image comes into sharp focus on one back yard in particular, where we get a good look at a -
: : 553
// Whoever Elizabeth Ann Reston is, she's lovely
She's setting a picnic table in her back yard at the moment, unaware that she's being watched by an eye in the sky -- just as Kay is unaware that Jay is standing behind him
Jay notices the monitor with the Middle-aged Woman on it
He looks at Kay's expression, then back at the monitor
Pretty lady
Kay clicks off the picture of her
Jay drags a chair and sits down
(') You were the guy with the flowers in the photo, (the night the aliens arrived
) (What, you were on your way to a dance or something and you got lost
And she never got those flowers, did she
] Kay doesn't answer, just stares at the screen
Elizabeth looks up, as if she knows she's being watched, but she's just looking at the sky, wondering how many stars'll be out tonight
(') Grumpy Guy's story comes into focus
She ever get married
No
It's more than Kay can bear
He reaches out and flicks a switch
The monitor goes blank, except for a data screen: Kay sits back in the chair and eats a potato chip morosely
Jay looks at him: "Is this me in thirty years
"  moment goes by
Finally: Well, it's better to have loved and lost than never to have -- Try it
(
) Kay
Jay and Kay cross back toward the  (Landed Alien Display), where each of the thousand or so Aliens who live on earth are represented by a flickering
Some lights are starting to go out
(quietly, with dread) They're leaving
We've had twelve jumps in the last hour
Redgick was just the beginning
What do they know that we don't know
Kay looks to his partner, then to the screen
Another light flickers out
Why do rats desert the ship
(to the twins) Go to Lem Sat
Put up a forty-field view of Manhattan
New York City is just a bright spot of light on the Eastern coast of the United States
(') Four hundred
Now there's a view of the earth from space
Nothing unusual
(') Four thousand
Now we're looking at earth from far, far away -- and from here we can see something that doesn't belong in this picture: far off to one side of the earth
The words " " flash in red letters on one side of the map
(') That's an Arquillian battle cruiser
And we've got a dead Arquillian prince
-- a sound like a cat and mouse caught in a blender
Message coming in
The communication continues
(') Speak of the devil
The communication continues
They sound pissed
(to the twins) Translate that and step on it
(to Kay) Meanwhile get down to Rosenberg's store and see what you can turn up
Kay and Jay walk away
(') And Kay -- take a lot of fire power
Kay pulls out the , - small, clear, canister sprouts from underneath it, malicious swirling gases visible through its walls
like that
Series four de-atomizer
Kay pulls out another weapon, the   '
(') Here
We call this the "Noisy Cricket
" You get a series four de-atomizer and  get a "Noisy Cricket
" (looks at the gun) 'm afraid 'm going to break it
Jay follows Kay out, glancing back to see the huge gun turrets on the Arquillian Battle Cruiser  and  as they swing around into position, pointed down at the unwitting planet below
: - The window in the front door of Rosenberg's jewelry shop collapses in a shower of glass
reaches in and fumbles with the locks, undoing them one by one
He gets them all and steps inside
Out the window behind him, we can see his Orkin van, double parked in the street in front
All the gems and jewels are under glass counters
Edgar starts the glass, grabbing great handfuls of jewels and tossing them aside
Outside, a New York City tow truck pulls up to the front of the Orkin van and starts to hitch up
Edgar, in his rage, starts to smash anything breakable, even the framed pictures on the walls
He stops at one particular picture, staring intently at it
It's a glamor shot of Rosenberg's cat, provocatively posed on a satin pillow
There are a half dozen more pictures of the cat, some posed with Rosenberg, some by itself
This animal was important to Rosenberg
From outside, the  of an engine distracts Edgar
He turns around, in time to see the Orkin van lurch as the tow lifts its front wheels off the ground
- rushes outside as the tow truck  gets the van up on the hoist
That's my truck
And make sure you tell them that at the impound
Edgar reaches into the front seat of the van and pulls out his twelve gauge
He points it at the tow truck Driver
The tow truck driver looks at him with disdain, and pulling back his shirt reveals a mean-looking gun
(') got worse
He keeps hitching up the van
Two pedestrians walk past the dispute, very fast, ignoring the debate, headed right for the shop
We go with them, and realize that it's -- --  and
They stop at the smashed door of the jewelry shop and exchange a glance
Kay pulls a very menacing-looking weapon, nods, and they step inside
- They look around and see the recent demolition caused by Edgar
Jay furrows his brow
Who robs a jewelry store and leaves the jewels
Someone who's not looking for jewels
Jay moves behind the counter
On the floor is an ornate, empty bowl and a bag of cat food, next to a scrumptious pillow
There are several on the wall
There is also a pile of
Jay picks up one of the , inspects it closely, shaking his head
This guy had a serious crush on his cat
Jay's attention is broken by something through the window
Outside, lumbering straight for the store, is
Jay thinks for a moment -- where does he know that face
Suddenly, Edgar raises his arms, pointing both the farmer's rifle and the driver's shotgun
Before Edgar can shoot, Jay
Kay
And then Jay , shattering the storefront window, and on the street
The blast hurls him up and back a good ten feet, him into the wall with tremendous force
Edgar turns and rushes away down the street as Jay picks himself up
The bug in the Edgar suit
The ugly redneck from the picture
That's him
Jay leaps through the broken storefront window and after Edgar
(picking himself up) Damn it
Kay runs out after Jay
- Edgar doesn't bother sticking around to continue his fight
He jumps behind the wheel of the tow truck, starts it up, and hits the gas
The engine
Jay sprints after him,  his noisy cricket
He is thrown back into some pedestrians, while his
Hits the rigging between the Orkin Van and the town truck, separating the two
Jay pulls himself up and sprints after the tow truck, but it accelerates too quickly
Edgar is just about to turn the corner when Jay leaps onto a parked  to try and get some height
As Jay prepares to shoot, , and a   backs into his line of fire
, the   and Jay flies , hurtling through the air and  through the window of a car, his rear end right in the woman driver's face
When Jay looks up, Kay is standing before him
He yanks Jay out of the car
We do not discharge our weapons in view of the public
Can we drop the cover-up bullshit
There's an Alien Battle Cruiser that's gonna blow-up the world if we don't
There's always an Alien Battle Cruiser
or a Korlian Death Ray, or
an intergalactic plague about to wipe out life on this planet, and the only thing that lets people get on with their hopeful little lives is that they don't know about it
Kay gestures to a group of , drawn by the curious blasts from the store
There's smoking rubble everywhere
Don't worry about the bug
He's not leaving town
We've got his ship
After gesturing to the back of the Orkin van, where Edgar's spaceship is neatly stowed, Kay pulls out his cell phone
(into phone) Zed, we're gonna need a containment crew down here at McDougal, south of Houston
-  - Back at Men in Black Headquarters, the little lights on the world map which indicate aliens' locations are going out, one by one, about one every five or ten seconds
is sounding, over and over, and   are rushing left and right
is in his office
Containment may be a moot point, my friend
The exodus continues
It's like the party's over and the last one to leave gets stuck with the check
Zed looks down to the vast floor below and sees the four worm guys with suitcases walking across the floor
You sorry little ingrates
(
) What about the Arquillians
We've only translated a part of the message so far: "Deliver the Galaxy
" (
) No, they don't want much, do they
Oh, it gets better
They're holding us responsible
He looks up at the screen
It reads: Another contestant has entered the ring
(  ) As Kay puts away his phone, turns to Jay All right, kid
The Arquillians want the galaxy, whatever the hell that means
We need help
professional
Someone with years of experience in intergalactic politics
just hope the little prick hasn't skipped town
: - The tow truck  to a halt at a curb
gets out and walks away, fast,  under his breath
He rants, livid, thinking hard
As he passes a newsstand, he grabs the   by the collar
Where do you keep your dead
(thinks) don't have any dead
Where
don't know, the city morgue
Edgar shoves him away roughly
But before he leaves, his eye catches a postcard display marked "
" Edgar stares, fascinated, but we don't see what he's looking at
He reaches out and picks up a color postcard
He raises it to his face, thinking, then shoves it in his pocket and hurries off
: -   - Kay's   to a halt in front of the kiosk on Orchard Street and  leap out and Jay spots the , closing up the shop
He's wearing a dirty cardigan, watch cap, and fingerless gloves, his face aquiver with ticks and mannerisms
He has a small dog in front of him
Jay rolls his eyes as they step up to the counter
Of course that guy's an alien
That's gotta be the worst disguise 've ever seen
voice answers him, but not the Vendor's
You don't like it, you can kiss my furry little butt
Jay looks down
The voice is coming from the dog
This is
Kay approaches, motioning to Jay to make sure no one hears
You busy, Frank
Sorry, Kay,  can't talk right now, my ride's leaving in -- Kay grabs Frank
He yelps like, well, a dog
Call the pound
We got a stray
Hey
Get your paws off me
glare at Kay, who appears to be seriously mistreating this poor little dog
Jay tries to explain
The, uh
dog owes my friend some money
(to Frank) Arquillians and bugs
What do you know
know nothing
Not a thing
Kay shakes Frank the Pug, trying to force an answer
Stop it
Okay, okay
Rosenberg wasn't some two-bit Arquillian
He was the guardian of a galaxy
They thought he would be safe here on earth
And the bug had other plans
The galaxy is the best source for subatomic energy in the universe
If the bugs get their slimy claws on it, kiss the Arquillians goodbye
Ask him about the belt
(to Frank) Rosenberg said something about a galaxy on "Orion's belt
" What's he talking about, Frank
Beats me
Kay shakes Frank the Pug once more
(to a person passing by) They're rehearsing a ventriloquist act
The galaxy is here
Here
The galaxy is hundreds of millions of stars and planets
How's it here
If a dog can smirk, Frank does
You humans, when're you gonna learn that size doesn't matter
Just 'cause something's important, doesn't mean it's not very, very small
How small
Tiny
Like the size of a marble
Or a jewel
Now if you'll excuse me,  need to be walked before the flight
Kay lets go of Frank, turns to Jay, who is lost in thought
(to Frank the Pug) Get out of here
(then to Jay) The galaxy's here
It's not on Orion's belt
Jay suddenly notices Frank the Pug bark at a cat farther down the sidewalk
Kay
: - In the morgue,  is working at a desk when suddenly ' leaps up onto it from nowhere, the way cats do, landing right in the middle of the file she's studying
Laurel jumps
Boy, when you want attention -- She pets the cat
As she does, the cat's collar shines in the light
Laurel turns the name tag to face her
,    "
" As it is written across the collar of the cat
(
) "Orion
" That's a pretty name
From out in the corridor, a bell rings -- ,
Laurel notices something dangling from the cat's collar -- a of a strange and beautiful metal
The center is some sort of hardened, translucent material, light green in color
(') What's this
She peers into the jewel, and her face washes over with amazement
- It's as if Laurel is sucked into another universe
Her face goes beatifically blank as she sails through a massive starfield, millions of stars, billions of green, verdant planets, all racing by her at the speed of light
- Wow
Outside, the bell  again
Orion looks up, as if knowing who's out there, and not liking it
She  at the door and leaps off the desk, scurrying across the lab and disappearing under some equipment
/
-  - Jay and Kay barrel through town
So two galaxies have been fighting for years
And the only people who've been benefiting are a race of creatures called bugs
Then the two galaxies decide to make peace
and the bugs send this guy down to make sure the fighting never stops
By killing the emissaries, and stealing the galaxy they've been fighting about
And if we don't get it back before he leaves the planet
we're history
We're not even history
'Cause history implies there's someone around to remember it
-  - On a counter in the morgue corridor, a gray, peeling hand  on a bell on a countertop, over and over
The hand belongs to , who is carrying his shotgun, concealing it behind one leg
The morgue attendant, , emerges from a small security cage carrying a worn paperback copy of Atlas Shrugged and a fly swatter
Thank you for making sure the bell works
Suddenly, quick as a gunfighter, Tony  the fly swatter down on a Edgar winces
(') (to Edgar) What's up, Farmer John
man came in here earlier
dead man
And this means what to me
He was a very dear friend of mine
And believe he had an animal with him
gift gave him, a pet cat that means worlds to me
would like it back
'll need a picture , written proof of ownership of the cat, or notarized proof of kinship with -- Tony flicks the fly swatter again, sending another bug to meet its maker
Edgar grits his teeth
(') -- the deceased
Don't -- do that
Still another fly goes down
Do what
Tony looks down, to where Edgar's hands rest on the counter
Half a dozen cockroaches stream out of his sleeve
(') Shit
He ducks under the counter -- -- and comes up with a can of Raid
Edgar's eyes bug out
: - Kay's  pulls to a stop in front of the morgue and  and  jump out
'll handle this one, you wait outside
What the hell for
Because all we have to do is walk in and get a cat, it's not that hard
But if you go in, you're gonna lay your Jack Webb on her and flash your brain ray in her face and she's gonna end up with leukemia or some shit
The woman's a doctor, she doesn't need you erasing half her med school classes
Take me five minutes
And he continues into the morgue, leaving Kay waiting outside
Two minutes
- into a wall on one side of the morgue, thrown there by
He leans in, close, furious
Where is the animal
told you,  don't know, it ran under some equipment
Over there
Get it
He grabs her roughly and drags her across the morgue, toward the equipment she pointed to
As they draw close,  the cat bolts from underneath it, races between their legs, and leapfrogs over several small cabinets, landing on top of a very tall one with only six inches clearance between it and the ceiling
very tough hiding place
Edgar just starts to turn when they hear the  and a  from the corridor outside
(
) Hello
Anybody here
Edgar looks up at the cat's hiding place
No time to get it
The bell again
(
) Hello
Roughly, Edgar pulls Laurel close and puts a finger to his lips -- "Shhhhhhh
" -  - In the corridor,  looks around
No Tony, no answer to the bell
He once more, then heads into the back
- comes into the morgue
is in there, standing right up next to an examination table, but there is no corpse on the table, just a sheet draped over it
She just stands there, in the middle of the room, staring at Jay
Uh, hi
(oddly) Hello
(flashes a badge) 'm Sergeant Friday, from the Twenty-Sixth precinct
They brought a cat in here with a corpse the other day, might have said "Orion" on the cat's name tag
Yes
That's right
Right, well, the cat is, uh -- the cat's a witness in a murder case and 'm going to need to take it with me
don't know where the cat is at the moment
You don't
No
(lowers her voice to a whisper) Maybe you could take me with you instead
Jay looks at her
Excuse me
said, maybe you could take me with you instead
Damn, you do start fast, don't you
'd really like to go with you
Now
Jay just looks at her, amazed at the power he seems to have over this woman
He looks over his shoulder, to make sure he has a few more seconds alone
And, uh, why exactly is that
Laurel rolls her eyes
She seems irritated with him, but it doesn't go with what she's saying
just do
-  - comes down the stairs and into the morgue corridor
He checks his watch, then leans against the counter and pulls out a pack of cigarettes
Waiting
- Jay is thoroughly enjoying himself, but Laurel seems to be going crazy
have something  need to show you
She looks down, pointedly, in the direction of her waist
Now slow down, you don't have to hit the gas like that
She leans in and lowers her voice
You don't understand
You really need to see this
And  will
But we gotta get something straight here -- 'm gonna drive
It's not some kind of macho trip, it's just the way 'm used to doing things, okay
-  - Kay pulls out a box of matches and strikes one on the side
He raises it to his cigarette, but as it draws close, the match goes out with a sharp Kay furrows his brow
Odd
- Laurel is at the end of her rope
Look, Stud,  don't know how many more times 'm going to get to tell you this
There's something -- She points, sharply, at the examination table directly in front of her
(') -- that you have to help me with
Jay's smile vanishes and his jaw drops as he figures it out
He starts to reach for his gun
-  - Kay raises another lit match to his cigarette, but as this one gets close, a     drops from the ceiling and onto the match, dousing the flame
Kay looks up, sharply
Above him, , the counter guy, is stuck to one high corner of the ceiling by an enormous wad of viscous, dripping fluid
He's dead, a frozen look of terror on his face and the can of Raid still clutched in his hand
From inside the morgue, Laurel
- Kay races into the morgue just as the examination table  into the air, revealing , who was hiding beneath it
Now everything happens at once
Jay leaps back and draws the Noisy Cricket, Kay pulls out his series four deatomizer, and Edgar holds his shotgun under Laurel's chin, using her body to shield his own
Freeze it, Bug
Don't shoot
Don't shoot
(to Jay) , are you
How was  supposed to know
What did  have to do,  it for you
Maybe if you didn't come on like a drunken prom date
Oh, that's  typical
Any time a woman shows the slightest hint of sexual independence, men just -- Everybody shut
Let her go, Shit Eater
Listen, Monkey Boy,  may have to take that kind of talk in my end of the universe, but compared to you humans, 'm the top rung on the evolutionary ladder, so can it, all right
You're breakin' my heart
Move six inches to your left and 'll solve all your problems
the cat suddenly attacks, leaping off the top of the cabinet and landing on Edgar,  and scratching and clawing for all she's worth
Edgar snaps an arm up and whips her off
The cat squirms in his arm, the icon jangling
Edgar grabs the icon, holds onto it, and flings the cat away, across the morgue
The icon comes free, remaining in his hand
He drops it into his mouth and swallows
He shoves the gun hard against Laurel's cheek
That's better
Now put down your weapons
We're leaving
Kay freezes, teeth clenched, gun still in front of him
Standoff
(') Have you ever pulled the wings off a fly
Edgar cranks one of Laurel's arms behind her back, hard, and she in pain
(') Would you care to see the fly get even
How far you think you'll get without your ship
If that's what you call that hunk of space crap we've got back at our office
Put the weapons down
Never gonna happen, Insect
Edgar backs away with Laurel, further into the morgue, toward a glass window that looks out at the base of an air shaft
Jay and Kay advance, slowly, cornering him
It's okay, Laurel
is it okay
mean it's going to be okay
Don't bet on it, meat sack
And with that he turns, leaps -- -- and  right through the window, into the air shaft
( ) - , still clutching ,  up over a railing
Nobody looks twice as Edgar, dragging Laurel (with his arm over her mouth), races toward the nearby busy Manhattan Street
-   - Jay and Kay duck into the air shaft and look up -- too far to climb, and the walls are smooth anyway
Damn it
They turn and run out of the morgue
- , with ,  right in front of a , which screeches to a halt inches from them
The  sticks his head out and  something in an unknown language
And  yelling as -- Edgar reaches through the passenger side and pulls the Cabbie out the door (cigarette and wooden seat-beads and all)
The Cab Driver is still yelling as Edgar leaps in, pushing Laurel in before him, leaving her behind the wheel
He removes a  -- the one he took from the display on the newsstand
Take me here
What
Edgar just cranks the car into gear -- opening his mouth and swallowing the icon -- and in so doing revealing a     -, he    on the gas pedal
Laurel's head snaps back as the car rocks forward
She has no choice, but to grab the wheel and start steering as -- The car screeches out into traffic, swerving wildly as Laurel is forced to make a 90-degree turn
The car fishtails wildly, swiping an oncoming car as it straightens and heads into the traffic
The furious Cab Driver runs off after it, still yelling as he disappears around the corner
second later,  and  rush out into the street
The cab is nowhere to be seen
Jay runs into the street, noticing the wooden beads, the ripped pine-scented green deodorizer, and the still-burning cigarette
They're in a cab
And Jay starts running down the street, where  of cabs are waiting at the intersection
He's running from cab to cab, pounding on windows, scaring the living shit out of people -- Hey
Laurel
Hey
-- but Laurel and Edgar are nowhere to be found
Up ahead the light turns green and the tide of taxis wash away, leaving Jay on the street
He turns as a car screeches up behind him, its headlights shining in his eyes
As it gets closer, Jay sees it's Kay in the
Stop wasting time
He's not getting off the planet in a cab
: -  - Jay and Kay rush in from the door under the World's Fair mural, and head toward the main display screen; all around them, the  staffers are in frenetic activity in response to the threat from above
(to tech at a desk) Come with me
Put up a bio-net all the way around Manhattan; if it's not human, it's not leaving the island
(') What've we got from our friends upstairs
Same thing: "Deliver the galaxy
" Yeah, well the bug's got the galaxy, but we've got his ship
He's got to be looking for a way out
Just then, a loud  wails
,    shoots out from the Arquillian ship, striking a region of planet earth
-  - -- headquarters, where every bell, whistle and light imaginable is going off
Arquillian battle rules, kid
First we get an ultimatum, then a warning shot, then we have a galactic standard week to respond
galactic standard week
How the hell long is that
One hour
One hour
Viewing the screen, it now reads: To keep the bugs from getting it, the Arquillians will destroy the galaxy and whatever planet it's on
You're talking about
Sucks, doesn't it
Pull up the locations of all land-based interstellar vehicles
They're all gone
Frank the Pug took the last ship on the planet
As Kay and Zed watch as the machine scrolls through the data, Jay walks back towards the center of the room, deep in thought
Over him we hear: Atlantic City
Gone
That landfill on the Jersey Shore
Gone
Uh, gentlemen
Epcot
Gone
Miami Beach
Gone
Fellas
Hartford
Gone, thank God
Hey
Old guys
Kay and Zed both look up at once, scowling
(') Do those still work
They follow his gaze, up, over the computer terminals
There, on the wall in front of them, where it has loomed for the entire movie, is the enormous mural of the 1964 World's Fair grounds
Most prominent in the mural are two tall towers that rise dramatically from the ground, topped by -- -- the two flying saucers from the very first alien contact
As they stand there, wide-eyed, staring at it, we -- : '  - -- the real-live twin towers on the actual fairgrounds in Flushing Meadows
taxi  to a halt at the edge of a fence a hundred yards away
shoves  out through the driver's door and follows behind her, still holding his weapon on her
You're coming with me
What
Why
It's a long trip
'll need a snack
And he shoves her ahead of him, off in the direction of the space ships
Behind him, abandoned on the front seat of the cab, we finally see the front of the postcard he's been carrying around
" , 1964 ' ," it says, with a distinctive photograph of the spaceships
So that's how he knew
: - Nighttime now, and the city hums along, just another Thursday night
The clock in Columbus Circle says it's 7:45
- TVs in the window of an appliance store show a rerun of "Cheers
" laugh
- The news ticker in Times Square announces the latest shattering news: --    60' pass left and right, blissfully unaware of their impending doom
: - and  leap into Kay's  and  the doors
Kay jams the key in the ignition, the car  to life, and he turns to Jay
Whaddya say we bag us some bug
He hits the gas and the car  away from the curb
- The  tears through the city
-  - Kay turns sharply to the right,  Jay around
Looking up ahead, he sees the entrance to the midtown tunnel
You're taking the tunnel
You know a better way to Queens
It's usually jammed
- The  races through the tunnel at top speed
It's clear driving for a few seconds, but then they round a bend -- -- and there's a traffic jam up ahead
-  - Kay approaches the line of cars at top speed, with no intention of slowing down
Jay, terrified, holds on for dear life
told you
Jay
The button
Yeah
Push the button, Jay
rotates into place between the two front seats, and that red button flashes underneath its plastic shield again
Jay flips back the plastic cover and  his finger down on the red flashing button
(') And you may want to throw on a seat belt
-   - As the  rockets toward the traffic jam up ahead, it begins to evolve, its shape actually changing
The sides and back extend as some sort of endoskeleton pushes the "normal" panels out
It becomes a larger, wirier machine, held together by an elaborate series of mechanical muscles and metallic tendons
Kay's car hurtles toward certain death in the traffic jam, but at the last possible moment it swerves off to the side, a   coming from underneath it
Instead of banging off the wall of the tunnel, the  actually clings to it
It swerves up, onto the wall and hangs there, racing by the traffic below
It keeps going, turning all the way over and driving upside down, wheels clinging to the roof of the tunnel
-  - Jay falls from his seat with a , onto the upside down ceiling of the car
Balled up on the back of his neck, he peers out the window as they tear through the tunnel,  over the bottlenecked traffic underneath
As they race through the tunnel, they have a minute to kill
Mind if  smoke
What
In the car,  mean
don't care
Hey, just a common courtesy
It bothers some people if you smoke in a car
He lights a cigarette and blows the smoke out leisurely, one hand on the wheel, just waiting out the tunnel
Jay gives up struggling to right himself and closes his eyes, suffering through this
-  - From outside the car, we watch it rocket along on the roof of the tunnel
We can hear '  as he goes on
And on
Yeah, it's harder and harder to smoke anywhere these days
Hell,  suppose should quit
've tried
Never took, though
'm beginning to think  lack self-control
And they disappear out the other end of the tunnel -- -  - -- and flip over,  back down onto the road on the other side
Jay falls off the ceiling and  into his seat
Well, back to work
He flips his cigarette out the window and cranks the wheel to the left
-   - Approaching a toll booth, the  shoots across nine lanes of traffic and through the only open booth,  the gate
Traveling at about two hundred miles an hour, Kay nonchalantly flips a token out the window -- -- and it  in the basket as their taillights disappear
: '  -   - climbs the outside of the landing tower of one of the space ships, pushing  up ahead of him, headed for the saucer at the top
Come on, let me go, you don't want to eat me
'm a very important person on my planet
Like a queen
goddess, even
There are those who worship me, yes
'm not trying to impress you with this, 'm just letting you know
It could start a war
Good
War means food for my family, all seventy-eight million of them
That's a lot of mouths to feed, your highness
You're a wonderful dad
And with that she  him squarely in the face
He reels, momentarily losing his grip on her
She takes advantage of the moment and out, into the air
Edgar flails, but she is beyond his reach
She falls, tumbling through the air -- -- and lands in the branches of a tree
She hits hard, the branches rattling, and reaches out and hangs on for dear life, high above the ground
Above, Edgar just keeps climbing
'  - Over at the fence, the  comes to a looooong, skidding stop at the fairgrounds
,  and  flip open the trunk and scarf up whatever weapons look most dangerous
Kay grabs a black box,  a row of latches, and opens it, revealing -- -- the most wicked-looking shotgun on the planet
Three feet long, triple-barreled, over and under and under, plus a pump action reloader on top of a storage clip for a dozen more shells
The shells themselves are solid, glistening like polished steel
Kay loads up the clip
You know how to work that
Kay pumps it once, with extreme confidence
No idea whatsoever
He  the trunk, revealing the flying saucers sitting atop their columns in the distance
(') Let's bag us some bug
As if on cue, one of the saucers begins to
Then it starts to spin, faster and faster
The ship begins to rise
Oh, shit
'  -  - Laurel sits in her tree, watching with amazement
- At Shea Stadium, a Mets game is in progress
Behind the home plate side, the flying saucer silently rises up in the night sky, plainly visible
But at that very moment, the batter  into a fastball, hard
The crowd rises to its feet, , staring out at center field, where the ball is headed
All eyes in the house are on the Mets'  , except for his eyes, which are on the flying saucer behind home plate
His eyes widen, his jaw drops -- -- and the catchable ball sails over his head,  into the wall behind him
The crowd  viciously
'  - Kay raises the weapon he took from the trunk; looks over at Jay
Set it to pulsar level five, sub-sonic implosion factor -- What
Press the little green button, on three
Jay raises his weapon; they press their green buttons
(') One
two
They pull their triggers
For a moment, nothing happens, as if it were a misfire
But then, there is a  , like all the air in the immediate area being sucked into a space the size of a dime, and a tremendous shock wave rolls out from the barrel of the guns
Jay and Kay are sucked to the ground by the bizarre force,  to their stomachs like magnets to a refrigerator
'  - The shock waves wrinkle across the open space between them and the ship, then it  the ship -- -- and it too is sucked back down
Hurtling back toward them
'  - She flinches as the flying saucer shoots overhead
'  - The saucer  through the Unisphere, an enormous steel globe, and to the earth,  through brush, dirt and rock
Jay and Kay come to their feet
In front of them, the dust clears
Trees uprooted, stones and dirt thrown everywhere
a dumpster has been cast to their left
And the saucer is there, embedded in the earth, tipped off-kilter in a mound of debris
hatch comes up
revealing Edgar, walking slowly toward them, with contained fury
You don't get it
've won
It's over
You are under arrest for violating number 4-1-53 of the Tycho accord
Please hand over any galaxy you might be carrying
You milk-suckers
You don't matter
In a few seconds you won't even be matter
Move away from the vehicle and put your hands on your head
He pumps the gun for emphasis
Put my hands on my head
Edgar stares at him
Then flexes his arms, still encased in flesh
His giant pincers  free of the rotting skin
He extends both pincers to the sides, and, my God, his reach must be twelve feet across
Now the skin and clothes on Edgar's legs begins to  and
They , revealing two hideous, doubled-over insect legs
The bug raises himself aloft on his legs
He sucks in a deep breath of air, and now the rest of the Edgar suit goes the way of the arms and legs
The torso  in great rendering of cloth and skin, and finally Edgar's head simply  apart,  against the walls
Edgar now reveals himself as he really is: a hairy, bug-like exoskeleton, a scaly tail with a long stinger, a head like a cobra with elliptical eyes and a small nose, and two horse-like feet with three toes each
He raises his pincers in the air, resting them on his head
The hangs on a chain around his neck
Like this
Kay and Jay pump their guns and aim at the Bug
Suddenly the Bug
And a ,     shoots from him and engulfs both shotguns
The Bug snorts it back, tearing them from Jay and Kay's grasp, then swallowing them
Jay and Kay have only a second to react before -- The Bug  at them with the back of his clawed hand, like someone brushing aside a gnat -- and
'  - She flinches as she sees them hit the ground
She starts to climb the tree
'  - Jay and Kay hit the ground with loud grunts
That did not go at all like  had planned
They look up to see the Bug moving for the second tower -- and the second flying saucer
Kay gets to his feet
This guy's really starting to bug me
Kay starts walking after the Bug
Whatever happens, Jay, don't let him get on that ship
Where are you going
Getting my gun back
What
Kay steps forward and yells at the departing Bug
(') Hey, Bug
The Bug just keeps moving toward the ladder
(') 'm talking to you, Bug
You know how many of your kind 've swatted with a newspaper
The Bug turns toward Kay
Kay steps up to him, the small human facing off against the giant alien hug
'  - She quietly makes it to the ground -- hurries off to the darkness of the woods
'  -      - Kay has himself in the Bug's face, its dripping fangs inches from Kay's face
You're just a smear on the sports page to me, you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal parasite
Eat me
The Bug reacts -- cranks open its massive jaws with a deafening , lunges forward, and sucks Kay into his mouth
The Bug straightens up to its full height and throws his head back
Kay slides down the Bug's throat, bending it sideways as he kicks and his way down into its abdomen
looks on, in stunned horror
and lets loose a - Laurel is still watching
'  -      - Jay watches as the Bug continues its
He feels totally defeated
But
He can hardly believe his eyes as he looks down at the Bug's stomach
'
Through the leathery pouch of the Bug's stomach, we can just make out the distended outline of the two atomizers
and just a few inches from it, a   is reaching toward the gun
- Kay, swimming in the Bug's intestinal fluid, tries to make his way to the gun, Holding his breath
Eyes stinging
'  - Jay knows what he has to do
He picks up a good-sized chunk of concrete dislodged by the crashing saucer and hurls it at the Bug
Hey
Come over here and try that
The concrete  off the Bug's shell -- he doesn't seem to notice; just keeps moving
Jay picks up a twisted metal pole and runs at the Bug
Stop right there, or 'll start wailing on your waxy, pointed ass
Jay starts pounding on the Bug with the metal pole
- Kay almost has his fingers around the stock of the gun -- The  on the outside distracts him and he turns -- the gun shifts away
'  - The Bug grabs the metal pole and yanks it out of Jay's hands
He swings at Jay -- Jay dodges the blow and falls to the grass
The Bug slices down with razor-sharp claws at Jay -- -- Jay rolls out of the way, just as the mean-looking claws dig into the grass
Jay rolls right underneath the Bug's legs
His hand falls on something in the grass -- another piece of debris, a sharp metal spike, gleaming like a dagger
He grabs the metal spike and looks up at the Bug's apparently vulnerable underbelly, right above him
He grabs the spike with both hands and is about to thrust the spike up, into the Bug's gut, when; The Bug bends its head down between its legs
'  of Jay there, upside-down from this perspective, lurking between the Bug's legs
'  - The Bug opens its jaws and  at Jay -- who propels himself backward out of harm's way
The Bug starts climbing the tower
Jay howls in frustration
What are you, afraid of me
Come on
Stand and fight like an arthropod
In frustration, Jay screams and throws himself on the Bug, hanging onto its back, trying to drag it down
(') You want a piece of this, huh
Maybe you're a badass in your hive, but this is New York City
You're just another tourist here
The Bug flicks him off with his tail -- sending him  twenty feet through the air
Jay  into the dumpster, landing on a heap in front of the garbage
But, scratched and beat-up, Jay still doesn't quit -- he stands to yell at the Bug, extending his arm at the creature
You're messing with the wrong species, Bug -- He notices something on his arm
a cockroach running down his sleeve
He flicks it off
Looks down at the ground
sees another roach
looks over to the dumpster behind him
there are more of them
a whole mob, in fact
fifty or sixty of the critters, climbing out of a rusted hole in the dumpster
Jay has one last desperate idea
He kicks at the dumpster -- part of the side is rusted paper thin and it kicks apart and crumbles to pieces
pouring forth from the dumpster, crawling like a black glittering river, away from the garbage
Jay leaps to his feet and moves to the glistening mob of insects
Hey, Bug
'  as he steps on the roach
as he flinches on the ladder -- he hates that sound
He smiles
(') If 'm not mistaken, that was a cousin of yours
He knows he's getting to him
He steps toward the Bug -- moving his foot over another roach
He crushes another one
(') Whoa
That had to hurt
And, what d'you know, here's your old Uncle Bob
He steps forward again --
He turns around, anger burning in his eyes
- Kay's hand reaches closer and closer to the gun
'  -   - Jay keeps moving toward the Bug, finding new roaches to tread on -- holds his foot over another one
What's that
Can you hear what he's saying
'Help me
Help me
' []   as he starts climbing down the tower and moving toward Jay
They are moving toward each other in a show down -- Jay moves on, poising his foot over another roach
Ooh
There's a pretty one
That one looks kinda familiar, don't you think
know who that is
The Bug is right over Jay now, jaws dripping ready to gobble him up
Don't do that
Jay stares right back at the Bug
Inside, he sees Kay's hand, closing around the trigger of the shotgun
He brings it around, pointing up, straight at the Bug's head
That's your Momma
He moves to  the roach -- The Bug moves to chomp Jay -- Jay stares up at him, unflinching
(') Didn't she ever teach you not to bite off more than you can chew
and at that very moment
Kay  a hole right in the middle of the Bug's midsection
The front of the Bug's thorax  in a shower of bug juice all over Jay
The Bug flies into two pieces -- the butt end sailing one way; the head flying behind Jay
Kay falls out of the Bug, in a mess of goo, gasping for breath, dropping the atomizer from his slippery fingers
The other gun sails off into the darkness
The  drops to the ground, rolls over to Jay's feet, and  to rest like a silver dollar on a barroom floor
He calmly bends down and picks it up
Jay is pissed and starts in on Kay
You son of a -- Kay holds up a finger in a 'wait a minute' gesture -- pulls out his pocket phone and hits a number
Zed
Get a message to the Arquillians
We have the galaxy
- Zed is standing at the console, a smile on his face
He glances over at the console that displays alien arrivals and departures on the earth
The red lights are coming back on
think the word's already out
Our friends are coming back
(then) Got an authorized landing at Times Square
You and Jay check it out on the way back
And pick me up one of those soft pretzels, while you're at it
Extra salt
feel like celebrating
'  - Kay flips the phone closed
You were saying
Getting eaten
That was your plan
(shrugs) Worked
As they argue, behind them, unseen, on its forearms, eyes gleaming with hate, jaws dripping -- ready to lower itself onto Kay and Jay
After  got the shit beat out of me
And  almost got digested
It goes with the job
You coulda told me what you were doing
There wasn't time, sport
The Bug attacks, swinging its head down on them
They turn to see it, and just before the jaws snap down on their heads
The Bug's head explodes into a million bits
Bug juice showers down everywhere, bucketsful of goo drenching Kay and Jay even further
They turn to see
standing behind the dead Bug, the other atomizer in her hands, the barrel smoking, the weapon and Laurel dripping the Bug innards
Interesting job you guys got
Bits of Bug juice still flying through the air
- The driver sees something tumbling toward the windshield
He winces
--   '
The driver grimaces at the mess
Damn bugs
He reaches down and hits a button
Wiper fluid squirts onto the windshield and the wipers spread the bug goo everywhere
: - Kay's  is parked outside Men in Black headquarters
leans her back against the car
We see  and  walking away in the distance
Look,  know we got rules, but she did just bust the Bug for us
And so maybe you don't have to flashy thing her
Kay pulls out the neuralyzer
Who's she gonna tell, anyway
She only hangs out with dead people
Not her
Me
(looking up at the sky) They're beautiful, aren't they
The stars
never just look anymore and they're beautiful
Kay, you're scaring your partner
haven't been training a partner -- 've been training a replacement
Oh no,  can't do this job by myself
(walking towards them) Hey, guys, we're nowhere near my apartment
We're not even on the right island
Maybe you won't have to
Kay starts dialing back the neuralyzer
Days
Months
Years
Always face it forwards
He hands the neuralyzer to Jay
Taps his pocket
Indicates for him to put his glasses on
Jay resists
've just been down the gullet of an interstellar cockroach
That's one of a hundred memories  don't want
Jay takes the neuralyzer
Slips on his glasses
See you around, sport
Jay raises the neuralyzer
With a brilliant , the screen turns white
No, you won't
: - various tabloid headlines as a hand flicks through them
Here's one: Mets' Centerfielder Says: "

Tailored black suit
Black shoes
Short-cropped hair
The look never looked better
Zed called
The High Consulate of Regent-9 emissary wants floor seats to the Knicks -- Bulls game
'll talk to Dennis Rodman, it's his damn planet
Let's roll
Both car doors , Jay drops it in gear, and the   away from the curb
- The  is just one of many cars in a jam-packed Manhattan city block
Manhattan itself is just part of a much larger urban and suburban sprawl
The east coast of the United States is just part of a much larger land mass
North America is just a small portion of the planet Earth
Earth is just a tiny ball in our solar system
Our solar system is just a few blips of light in a vast star field
The Milky Way is just a creamy spiral amid innumerable other creamy spirals
There seems to be an edge to what we see, a curved border that seems to close in on things around the perimeters, until everything that exists seems to be contained in one tiny ball -- -- which is actually a marble resting on a strange-looking patch of red dirt
An   reaches down and flicks the marble, sending it skittering and bouncing across the dirt, where it  into a dozen other big blue balls just like it
