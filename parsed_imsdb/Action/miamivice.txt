Written  by Michael Mann Based on "Miami Vice" created by Anthony Yerkovich First Draft 9/22/04 WGAw : : -  :   - We are at the delicate interface between ocean and air
liquid and gas
the event horizon where molecules evaporate
This interchange is ethereal
Then, low frequencies rumble through depths
louder
closer, now
And the ocean surface is torn by a 46-foot catamaran and the of 2,700 horsepower, rocketing at us at 140 knots
:  "  " in
:  "  " has a canopy, low like a -1 bomber and extends a half mile
It launches off two-foot swells, goes airborne, pushes to 150 knots with another 1,100  left
- pilots the "Born to Win" in full helmet
On the throttle and flaps is
- "  " leads the frontrunners towards a finish line demarcated by a couple of $10 million yachts loaded with media
At the last moment occurs a small power loss, and "Born to Win" gets nosed into second place by the 46-foot Skater, "Goddess"
: - "  " - thunders to the dock, throttled down at low revs
The canopy is up
Crockett and Tubbs' helmets are off
Dockhands tie it off
It's the same crowd you catch at a Grand Prix:  nine- figure money, tall, Northern Italian women and minor German princesses with Swiss educations, no bimbos and no questions about asset origins
The exception is "Born to Win's" sponsor, a blonde, dreadlocked, bearded 6'4"
He looks like a dot-com entrepreneur who got out in time
Next to him is a blonde Ukranian lady with high cheekbones
We'll see her again
-  + in second position to the Japanese driver and throttle man of "Goddess," neither of whom speak English
The #3 boat, "Bicardi Silver," was driven by David Scott and throttled by John Tomlinson
+ leave the winning circle among Asian and Mexican billionaires
As the small crowd breaks up
- named  in Vuarnet wraparounds and buzz-cut white hair glides by
(low) Burnett, what's crackin'
Nothing
Maxin' and relaxin'
(doesn't believe them) Sure
Change your mind; get inclined
Let me know
Whatever Nicholas is soliciting, Crockett and Tubbs don't want
(Nicholas brokers "go-fast" runs, moving loads from offshore into South Florida
Among guys who pilot offshore race boats, there are one or two who've never run a load, but no one's found them yet
)  Meanwhile
: '  -   - couple-hundred-thousand-dollars worth of granite and steel
Off-screen a restaurant-grade Sub-Zero opens with a hiss
Fan starts
Beyond the kitchen we  through a dining room to a den
chair is overturned
We  muffled sounds
We  feet extend through a door jamb
Someone's on the floor
television is playing, distantly
- so close they almost come to life
Venezuelan family, two boys and a girl in a pool
Maria, Alonzo, the two boys at their sister's baptism
And we see holding the baby daughter is Riccardo Tubbs
family dinner at a South American restaurant
Tubbs sits with the youngest daughter on his lap
Maria is on the other side of him
This is the image that almost comes to life
We hear the vivacious latin ambience late on a Sunday afternoon when families take the grandparents and have dinner
- from the bright glare of the interior the broad neck of a
Viking is tattooed there
The image morphs into a naked woman presenting her rear to a muscled biker next to a chopper above a swastika residing between shoulder blades
lightning bolts are on his neck
from this , who is bent into the frig because he's hungry
His head is shaved and he's naked from the waist up
is tied around his waist
Yellow industrial gloves are on his hands
Something bad is happening in this house
: - It's a Sikorski skimming across the water of Biscayne Bay on a moonlit night at living-room level past stilt houses
pilots the chopper past the brightly lit windows of high-rise Collins Avenue condos for the fugitive rich
and heads towards the MacArthur Causeway
What's our deal
Backup in case the Russians get physical
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be
Skin has to touch skin
That's the requirement for the warrant
Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops
(beat) Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security
In the back - her long copper legs stretched out under a short skirt - is
This  gotta see
(beat) the "make up an excuse and stop" part
Have faith
have faith
In horoscopes and fortune cookies
So
Switek pulling this off
That's not faith; that's delusional
Wearing enough of nothing to hide the micro
380, which Gina checks right now
There's a round in the chamber
:    crosses past the stacks of $5 million condos to a landing pad on a roof
The Miami of the '80's, that twilight-zone frontier built on coke-fueled cash flow, is over
The frontier development stage is passed
It has Casablanca
Anything goes; everything has a price
: - The chopper rockets in, settles
Crockett, Tubbs and Gina descend to the 25th-floor penthouse, the target
As Crockett and Tubbs continue down to 24, she looks over her shoulder at Tubbs
Damn, girl
(    ) -  +  - enter
Two surveillance technicians,  and , are glued to a monitor showing a bedroom in which nothing happens
is there, out of a past somewhere between  and the Jesuits
Referring to the monitor on which there are   in an They are watching air move
This is exciting
That's 'cause nothing is happening
No shit
(it goes past him) Yeah
This is their surveillance
how they video their marks
See, we jacked their fiber optics, like we piggybacked their signal
Get it
Cooool
They exit to
-  + are met at the door by security, who recognizes them, and are welcomed by their host,
This is the Baccardi Cup After- Party
The same players from the marina
+ enter an 8,000-square-foot penthouse
offshore racer types, players, So Bee models
Runnin' the Biscayne 200
Crockett wanders off
If a coupla new exhaust manifolds show up
approaches a bar and female bartender
Gin and Tonic
Plymouth or Boodles
(Scandinavian accent) Lemon or lime
Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'
Where ya' from
(leaning in) Gottingen
That's in Sweden
You in Miami workin' on your complexion
She's beautifully bronzed
(laughs) No
was in Namibia
Doing
With the United Nations High Commission on Refugees
Famine relief
Gina's listening on her personal comms
Really
did refugee relocation in Somalia
But they transferred me out after  was wounded
Gina rolls her eyes as she crosses by Tubbs
Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an  draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him
He did volunteer one time
(entering) For a massage parlor bust
(beat) Why am  here
is a tall African-American
She whispers into a small mic
If you looked closely, she's ripped
as if steel cables moved under her smooth skin
She slides past Tubbs and Gina
(low) to backup Switek
But only if it gets lethal
That's impossible
Why
Because you cannot kill him
all white bling, is arguing with his blade-thin, glassy-eyed, adrenaline junkie partner,
Approaching is "Miss Ukraine
"  High cheekbones suggest one of Genghis Khan's horsemen found her maternal ancestor as attractive as Switek finds her
Tubbs clocks three beefy Russians in a corner, one is unusually fit
And there's Dmitri
The honey trap
And there's the honey
Hello, Miss Ukraine
brings Switek his glass of champagne
She whispers something in his ear
and is led towards a back bedroom
Gina ambles over
(to Crockett) Eleven to seven he blows it
(whispers) Twenty on my man
You're giving away your money, fool
Tubbs opens his Moto as if he's about to make a call
Trudy looks over his shoulder
What we see is the feed from the monitor in the surveillance room downstairs
: ' Two blonde people starting to get naked
Switek and Miss Ukraine
second call comes in
Tubbs ignores it
(to Zito) You bet your partner
Sure
Switek versus primal impulse from the amygdala
Higher thinking versus the lizard brain
Tectonic plates of libido confront the cognitive
Oh, bullshit
She cops his joint
He pushes the button
What's so fucking difficult
They watch
And
Crockett's cell phone rings
He separates from the group
Yeah
(
) Sonny
Yeah
(
) Where's Riccardo
On the phone
(
) 'm sorry
'm sorry, Sonny
-  - enters
He's come outside to hear better
In the background Gina shakes her head about Switek
He blew it
Trudy looks at Crockett and sees Crockett's focused, hearing
Who is this
: -   - He's cruising at 85
He's floating in a magnolia leather interior
But it's bloodstained from his nose and mouth
He's been beaten
His white shirt is torn
He doesn't care
(voice cracks) It's fucked up
'm sorry
(recognizing him) Alonzo
(beat) What are you talking about
Where are you
They had me from the gate
don't understand
Crockett's alarmed
He catches Tubbs' eye and waves him outside
gave up nothing on you guys
Don't worry
kept you and Rico out of it
Only the Feds
They're on their own
it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em
(
) Alonzo, what's goin' on
After  check on Francine and the boys, then 'm gone
Sonny, tell Rico 'm so sorry
wanted you to know
Tubbs joins Crockett on the balcony
Where are you
(
) look after her
Ask Rico to
Okay
Do that for me
had to do it
They had me from the gate
Do that
Whatever you can do for them
Okay
(breaks) Look what  did to them, Sonny
Alonzo
(
) Goodbye
Crockett's phone goes dead
What is it
Alonzo
Stevens
(nods) Something's wrong
Crockett's entering a number while
(dialing) 'll try Francine
Meanwhile Crockett
(recording) Federal Bureau of Investigation
Our office hours are
(Crockett punches three- digit code) (cuts him off) This is Detective Crockett
Miami- Dade
Patch me through to your Special Agent in Charge, James Fujima
It's an emergency
He'll be in on Monday
said, "emergency
"  If he's not reachable, who's running the weekend
The
We don't give that out
Listen carefully
Crockett compels himself to be patient
Meanwhile, Tubbs has struck out with Alonzo's home phone
(cont'd) (into Nextel) An informant who is working one of cases right now called me
may have a problem
So get me somebody on the other end of this telephone who knows what the hell 'm talking about
Meanwhile
(into phone) 'mon
(
) Miami-Dade  Tech
(into phone) Bobby
The firefly we used to have on Alonzo Stevens' Bentley, check if it still runs; if so, launch Air Support
Locate the Bentley
(pause, listens) don't know
we haven't worked with him for six months
(waits, then hears a click on his Nextel) Hello
(
) This is Agent James Fujima
Detective Crockett
(
) What's your Miami  badge number
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92
(
) (pause) Okay
What's up
we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force
Name of Alonzo Stevens
Now, he's informant
Stevens, called us haven't spoken to him for six months
do not know what case you have him on
do not know what he is talking about
But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad
Right now
How do  discuss operations over an open line
How do  know
(beat) got the call from Alonzo on an open line
That is the hand we have been dealt at this moment, at eleven-forty-seven o'clock Friday night
Okay
am trying to alert you, here
(beat) You know whether or not
you have a thing goin' down
do not
(beat) But we know this guy
think you know this guy
Normally, he is cool
Tonight he is distraught
That is atypical
That engenders foreboding
Do you understand the meaning of the word "foreboding"
As in badness is happening to your deal right fucking now
: ,   -  - Nothing
Rusting marine parts and corrugated metal fall into weeds next on a channel of the Indian River
It cuts through inner-city Miami
Distant noise
But
- in low light are strapping up
Kevlar vests go over tattooed arms and chests
Glimpses of swastikas
Handguns in waistbands
SMGs (Small Machine Guns) slung from shoulders over white shirts, business-suit jackets
Everybody wears surgical gloves
Shoes are industrial
: are leaving
One carries a very long rifle with a flash suppressor
It is a bolt action
50 caliber Burrows
is a second Aryan Brother sniper team with an identical weapon aimed at an empty lot a thousand yards away across the Indian River
Two Suburbans and an Escalade pull out
: - Caribbean freighters seized by  Customs rust at the bank
Two Cadillacs are parked
Waiting
door opens
An interior light comes on
Two Russian slickster types
Patient
One looks at a watch
The other triggers his cell phone
meeting is imminent
: -    - Empty except for the  Agent in a sweatsuit carrying files, as if he stopped by when Crockett's call came in
He's on a computer
He picks up the phone
Guy's involved in a "meet"
"Buy and walk"
"Buy and bust"
"Reverse undercover"
What
Meet and greet
" flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours
" And the deal goes down at another place at another time
That's right
so there's no industrial- strength  weapons team out there tonight
Crockett puts his Nextel on "speaker" so Tubbs can hear, too
Correct
Flash samples
Flash cash
(into phone) Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli
White supremacist types
Crockett's impatient
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs
, we think
wanna know
(sarcastic) Oh, good
what else, what else did he indicate to you
need to know everything he said
He is saying they had him from the gate
He is saying to my partner and  and to his family "goodbye
" What does that tell you
: -
-  + in the back seat get lucky
The pilot reacts as the in the copilot seat has picked up a signal from the
the
on Alonzo's Bentley
(keys radio; too much static, tries cell phone) Sonny, we got him
-  + Tubbs pilots it while Crockett gets the location of Alonzo's car and repeats it into the headset to Tubbs as the
-  + '  - banks hard left and heads for north 95 towards Lauderdale
Meanwhile
: - :    - Three Aryan Brothers in business suits get out of the rear of the Escalade and Suburban with a driver in each
Our two "Russians" approach from their Cadillac with a backup Cadillac and one driver on the other side
:
Friendly
Hip-hop culture has invaded White Supremacist gangs
Buzz cuts
Goatees couple of diamond earrings
#1 sample now is okay
And we want sample load when we do deal
Sure, man
#1 What inventory you can supply
#1 Meth
Glass, ice, 's, 's, Mitsu's, Ames, Ex
whatever you need
Coke
Tonnage
And Colombian
But give us a heads up
The Aryan Brother pops him a couple of vials
#1 (cont'd) Ice
Spectra-analyze that shit
And party-on with the coke
You are looking at ninety-two percent pure
none of that jumped-on powder they sell up in New Yorioo
#2 Yeah
(beat) Now, let's see the green
One of the Russians puts his hand on a weapon as the other opens up a Nike sports bag
Never seen money before
This is called "money
" Aryan Brother #1 reaches into the bag at the wrapped stacks of hundreds
Flips through a couple, takes one or two at random
Russian nods for him to go ahead
#1 Okay
You got lotsa green
We got all the goodies
We party
Larry'll call you in the  and talk money, quantity, time and place
Everybody goes back to their cars
As the two "Russians" get into theirs, Aryan Brother #1 turns from the running board of the Escalade with his driver's door open
Hey, Ivan
forgot to ask you something, my brother
He looks at his partner and nods, who says something into a Nextel
(cont'd) they have a decent death-benefit program in the
For the Russians in the car, time freezes
As they start to react, they're blown up by
50 caliber rounds from the two sniper positions
The
50 caliber rounds go right through car bodies, sheet metal, upholstery, glass, human flesh, bone, more upholstery and metal and out the other end
Another round goes through the passenger door, through the passenger, through the driver, out the driver door and into the night
The three Aryan Brothers approach the steaming cars with the chopped-up occupants and take the gym bag full of cash
The Escalade driver dons night-vision goggles
They load up and drive off as we hear the "thump, thump" of Air Support and some distant sirens
Meanwhile
: -  -  +  - at 170 knots watching a thermographic image of Alonzo Stevens' car on a monitor weave through traffic northbound on the 95
Tubbs' Sikorsky beyond Switek + Zito as it swoops from a higher altitude right past the Miami-Dade chopper, banks and dives for the freeway
Tracking with Stevens' Bentley from the front
The black Sikorsky is almost on the Bentley's hood
Tubbs racks the chopper sideways so that Alonzo can see Crockett in the copilot seat
: has his handgun out and is waving Alonzo over to the shoulder
Tubbs keeps the chopper almost blocking Alonzo's Bentley
Alonzo pulls over
Tubbs wheels around and lands on the shoulder
They approach
exits the Bentley and walks toward Crockett and Tubbs
He holds his hand out to keep them at a distance
Freeway traffic roars past
Crockett and Tubbs don't get too close, heeding Alonzo's warning
(incensed, over traffic noise) What the hell did you do
The Feeb gig was  front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them
One's
And broker the deal
Set up the meet with the types
Stevens takes a low-resolution -mailed image from his pocket and hands it to Tubbs
Tubbs looks up, shocked, hands it to Crockett
Stevens' head rotates loosely on his shoulders
his mind's elsewhere
' : Alonzo's wife, Francine, is bound - clothes torn - to a chair in a  room
On the floor are two young boys bound with plastic ties
Paper bags are over their heads
Francine's eyes are as large as saucers
Around her neck is a necklace of -4 explosive connected to a detonator
(cont'd) (shouts) So  gave them up, man
Gave up the Feds
Gave up everything knew
Now  got to go home
How'd they get onto you
How do  know
But it was from the get-go
Knew the  had run me into them
(beat) Sonny,  gotta go
: '  -  - and a Miami   team crash through the front door
Another team through the back
Trudy in a tactical vest is second in with a 12-gauge
The house is empty
Gina and other detectives hang in the rear
First  team "clears" the living room, dining room
Second clears the kitchen, maid's quarters
'  -    - last room to clear
center of the house
teams appear around corners
Weapons up
The looks on their faces tell us nobody is here
nobody alive
and what they see gives even these veterans pause as blood pools around the legs of a family and overturned chairs
Alonzo didn't save anyone
(after changing channel) Hello, Sonny
- on police radio listens to a message from Trudy while
(to Tubbs) gotta,  gotta go
Alonzo
What
(voice cracks) Alonzo, you don't need to go home
Now Alonzo knows
They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if
They lied
They been known to do that
Alonzo Stevens has a strange look in his eyes
He looks at Crockett and Tubbs, as if to say something
He doesn't
Crockett and Tubbs walk towards him, to reach him
to console him
backs away
Looks at them sadly
And before they can stop him, he steps out onto the freeway, opens his arms, and embraces the front bumper of a 70 m
p
h
18-wheeler
-500 -  +  - Grim, silent, race through Miami traffic to the crime scene we know is ahead because
'  we see all the lights from two dozen emergency vehicles a quarter mile ahead
Death is not procedural or casual, not when it's somebody you know, like an informant you worked cases with
Cell phone rings
Yeah
(
) What's your twenty
Quarter mile away
We see the lights
(
) Turn around
(taking cell) We know these people
Grieve elsewhere
: ,   -   - 3
in a concrete space
We've entered mid-scene
We're not certain
You said Nazi Low-riders
We're not certain
'mon, man
We think
We don't know
Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet
He wasn't deep into the crew
White gangs
It doesn't track
White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park
Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back
Not anymore
This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland
And computer fraud, identity theft
It's like that
(to the point) Tell them what you want
They knew about Alonzo, before he made a move on them
They had our operation
They've cut into us
How
We don't know
Break your encryption
Hack your e- mail
Employee databases
Somebody on the inside
We don't know
And that's the point
Maybe there's a mole
Whatever, it's a disaster
And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force
have , ,
Customs components in on it
So the penetration could be from any one agency
What we do know is have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause  have to assume our Operational Security is blown
As in, your ass is dead in the water
But Miami  wasn't part of the And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up
So what do you want
To recruit you
Pause
didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement
We don't know who's straight up, who's not
Recruit us to do what
Get into business with this crew, identify them
Illuminate their network
If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us
We'll indict and take it from there
How do we do that
Make a buy
(wry) That went well
Reverse undercover
supply to them
They got a steady stream of supply
So, no
From whom
Colombian producer
Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono
Never heard of him
From the North Valle area
New
Low-level, we think
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers
So
Transpo
How they bringing the loads in
They're not
They collect in Miami
Montoya, the producer, handles deliveries
That's his end, and he varies the routes
We got some  off an  of a coupla go-fast boats, on one run, that's all
Fujima boots up his military-spec laptop to view the video
Meanwhile
Track with me, here
(beat) They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb
They should have no-showed
But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers
And steal all your money
(beat; to Fujima) What does that say to you
(speculating) It says, "We do not fear you
" (to Fujima) It says, "Fuck off and die
"  It says, "We get down for recreation
" Fujima's Dell laptop glows to life
Two almost indistinguishable boats and their wakes are
(cont'd) Blow that up
Crockett's attention goes to something atypical he spots about the wake emerging behind each boat
He exchanges a look with Tubbs
But they say nothing
(to Crockett) So
We could try to run loads into these guys
(to Fujima) Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida
Into this group
You need to consider a few issues
(to Crockett + Tubbs) you'd be operating outside territorial United States
Your badges do not count
You have no authorization to carry weapons
If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated
And there's no backup
(to Fujima) And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya
Sure
mean full disclosure
Of course
From my side,  don't to know anything about what you're doing or how you do it
(to Castillo) So let me know if we're on
Fujima splits
Castillo waits until Fujima's car pulls away
(to Tubbs) About the Stevens family, 'm sorry
know you were close to them
was the kids' godfather
(intuits) And
"And" what
got to know
There is never any room for "personal"
(for Tubbs) He is fine
And we know the jokes
When it gets vengeful, things get messy
When they get messy the wrong people die
(beat) Everybody gets it
Good
And the answer is "yes
" (beat) Before she met Alonzo, once upon a time, a long time ago
(beat) You bet it was personal
and is now compartmentalized in the past
Okay
(to Crockett) What'd you spot
Three wakes off the back of those boats
Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep- hull
Sal Maguda
He any good
Oh, yeah
So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries
It's a rhetorical question
: -      - - - They're two feet out of the water on their dry dock, next to a Marine Shed
It's an unlikely location because derelict factories, cheap apartments, weeds and marine scrap metal are the neighborhood
-  + and a  team in the weeds across the river
They include - , a Haitian in dark sweats
They all are in plain clothes
Odile, she say they're pregnant
We don't know what that means, yet
Yeah
Okay
Only Jean-Louis and do the talking
: -  - Both steel doors  as if their molecular structure, itself, disintegrated from one  of Tubbs -40 grenade- launcher firing a canister of ball bearings like a king-size shotgun on steroids as
react, but Crockett draws down on one with an -47
Bastide wounds the second  who had drawn down his  & Third Guard begs to live in French Patois
They own the place
And Crockett sees
800 individually-wrapped bricks of North Valle Colombian cocaine are on a table
Comme on dit
(Like they said
) - Charger et les recoit d'ici
(Load 'em up and get out of here
) You crazy
Que fais-tu
Que faisons-nous
De qu'a-t-il l'air, fou
Nous voulons tous votre drugs
(What are we doing
What's it look like we're doing, fool
We are stealing all your dope
) Suburban crashes through the wreckage of the door and backs to the table
Jean-Louis and  #1 start throwing bricks into the back
Tubbs with Crockett exit
-   -  + approach the two deep -hull go-fast boats with three engines off the back
Tubbs cracks the breech of the grenade launcher and loads a 40-millimeter shell, while he strolls down the dock
tosses two Willie Peters (white phosphorus grenades) into the boats
Tubbs fires the -40 at a third boat, which explodes flame, followed by
destroy the smuggler's Strykers, which we saw in Fujima's video
Crockett + Tubbs have just put Sal Maguda out of business
They walk away and around the side of the shed, disregarding the curious citizens of Little Haiti, come to watch the fireworks
: 600     -  +  - drive
Crockett reaches into a paper bag full of cell phones and grabs one
He dials up a number, grabs another and hands it to Tubbs
(in the phone) Hey, Sailor
(pause) Yeah, 'm good
(beat) Got a hole in the calendar
looking to charge up the cash flow
(waits) Yeah, later
Crockett struck out
While
(into phone) Hey, Nicholas, my ace
Wha's up
(
) You know
Same old
(into phone) We got idle all of an instant
You got something from somewhere that's got to go someplace, somewhen, which is not too distantly in the future
-  - the guy with the white hair
It is fortuitous that you called
: ,   - Corrosion and decay
People look coldly at us
Malevolence and malefaction on every corner
No one's picked up the garbage for a month
Poverty in the Caribbean half-light
& cross the street to  from their rental car
The La Perla section was a 16th Century haven for pirates
It's had little civic improvements in 400 years
They enter a nightclub - shabby neon
-  +  - There are no customers
They're cautious
Men stop them and frisk them
They expected that
We're from Nicholas to meet Jose
They're waved to the rear
They start towards a back table
small group of people wait
+  :   " " He's a former right-wing Colombian paramilitary from the North Valle near the Pacific coast
He runs operations, communications and security
He has cold eyes and a corpulent face
He's notorious for using torture to ferret-out informants
Right now he watches these two Americans approach
Security people are on either side of him
(extends hand) Jose
Sonny Burnett
this is my partner, Rico
Sit
As Crockett sits, he notices that at a table a few to the side is a woman
This is
Behind glasses, she seems immobile, filled with intelligence, well-dressed in subdued Tom Ford and staring at him
Reading him
Crockett holds the look that extra beat and turns back to business
(to Security) Dos cafe
He's security, not a fucking waiter
But Yero nods
Security fetches coffee, anyway
So lay it out, my brother
Nicholas said you okay
That's nice
But how  know if you any good
What
Who you run loads for
Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you
Tubbs looks at Crockett
They thought it was a done deal
(dark) My mommy and daddy know me
Isabella tilts her head imperceptibly
And we didn't come down here to audition
Business auditions for us
(beat) and know who we are and know they want their load run by us before Nicholas calls
That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time
Yero's security reacts to the tone and raises weapons
few start up out of their chair as
+ appear at the door, SMGs from shoulder straps
Zito flips a D14 hand grenade which Crockett snatches out of the air, pulls the pin and slams on the table
Everyone
Only Crockett's hand pressure restrains the clip
(cont'd) (goes right up in Yero's face) You want to "know" shit
Who the fuck are you
You got a side deal with
Customs to open up the coast in a few spots
in exchange you flip them some gringo runners
Like us
You wearing a wire
Tubbs rips open Yero's shirt
Or
The Feeb
Yero's shirt
open to the waist
No wire
Yero's furious
Yero's people have weapons pointed their way
They outnumber Switek and Zito
Slack's taken up on triggers
It's on the edge
And the edge is overloaded
Tubbs reads that, warns Yero
People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo
That some crazy wallpaper
Whew
it wild
Is that a Jackson Pollack
" "No, viejo
That was Jose Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall
" So we can close each other's eyes right now
Real easy
Real fast
(pause) But, then, nobody makes any money
Yero gestures his security to calm down
one notch
Crockett and Tubbs still hold the grenades
Then Crockett opens his shirt
No wires
So does Tubbs
Pause
(flat) Equipment
Slow and low, Adam -500s
(Yero looks quizzical) carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload
all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point
Small freighters
We've done containers
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs
What kind of weight
We don't talk weight
We talk logistics
Isabella sits, watching this
She drinks her coffee
(cont'd) You get longs and lats for the pickup
Open ocean
You run it in
On shore, our people receive the loads
(interrupts) The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people
No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know
They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us
What you get from us is a date place
"In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami
"  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there
Keys in the ignition
Ready to roll
You pick it up
And you drive it
(waves his left hand) away
Money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns
Because when money and guns get together, there is violence
You afraid of violence
am not John Wayne
There is no "" on his chest
We get down if the play calls for it
But we are into business and making money
And violence is extra
And expensive
So how much weight you looking to move
Nothing
'Cause how you do delivery on the beach,  don't like
Maybe this does not work
Then it don't work
What happened to the last transporter you had
What do you care
(to Crockett) Do we need this
(rises) Red light, green light, Jose
(doesn't answer, leans back) 'm also called "Cochi Loco
"  That means "Crazy pig
"  'Cause enforce security and get people to tell me what  need to know
That part of what  do, you never want to find out about
(pause) Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go
Not me
Then what were we talking to you for
had to lay eyes on you
And
Isabella watches Crockett
(to Tubbs) You seem okay
(to Tubbs re: Crockett) But him
don't like
how he looks
Everything goes from tense to lethal
Has Yero made them
What do  care what you think about how he looks
You wanna fuck my partner or do business
Wait by the phone
(pause) You get a call
Or maybe you don't
Until then, piss off back to where you come from
Crockett flips the hand grenade and catches it with his left hand
and he drops it in front of Jose Yero
It spins on the table
He had reinserted the pin
And they back out
: -     - Contemplative
Offscreen a door opens
Entering is Gina Calabrese
She's naked
She washes his back
She dumps too much shampoo on his head
He tries to clear it from his eyes
Laughs
They start to make love under the water, in the steam, through the misted glass, offscreen we hear an engine rumble
: Somebody's coming
Sonny can wait
Tubbs and Gina are not random lovers, they're in love
The look in her eyes, the openness is pure femininity behind the Bronx presentation
She smiles, touches the side of his face
,     -  - ties up a 75' Sun Seeker
It looks like a 38' deep- offshore racer on growth hormones
Crockett's alone, as dusk fades over the '60's ranch house on the river
It's under tropical trees, with one strip of white neon utility lighting outlining the flat eave
,  - let himself in
He's at a kitchen stool at the counter when Tubbs enters in sweats
Anything
Nothing
Gina enters in a robe
(beat) "Hi, Gina
Hi, Sonny
" Hi, Gina
(putting shopping bag on table) This is from Frick and Frack
Trudy
(re:  bag) What do we got
Crockett pulls out three overly-large cell phones
Satellite
New encryption
Supposedly sharper than the
(to Gina) How good's our background
Tubbs and Crockett look at the Mac screen as Gina boots it up
Gina's fingers tap dance on the keyboard
You're so not the , if you got busted on a , you're in serious trouble
you're bad men back to grammar school
(to Tubbs) San Quentin
Pelican Bay
(to Crockett) Marine Corps
Statesville
Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up
Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again
How will it stand up
If they ran the rental car or lease on this place
even if it's database in El Paso
they'd have to work through the layers of bullshit three weeks deep
Then they'd find your deeper, hidden criminal selves
-  3   - No one's watching it
- asleep
Tubbs' eyes are wide open, staring
- : lights up
Beeps
Crockett's hand grabs it
It's the summons from Jose Yero
-  - - (Lazily) What am  supposed to do after get my nails and hair done
Reality  and stay by the phone
That's what all wives-in-crime do
He leans over and kisses her
She holds firmly the back of his neck and looks into his eyes
Be
careful
You hear me
He winks at her in assurance and he's gone
Her lazy smile drops off
"Careful"
she's not so sure he will be
: 55  - Crockett in the copilot seat
Switek and Zito are in the back, barely awake
Zito hands out coffee
Switek's stashing weapons behind the fuselage upholstery
Tubbs is clearing  air space as we

Where we meeting 'em
Port-Au-Prince

Turns towards commercial aviation facility
: opens
Switek and Zito emerge to rental cars with two car- rental clerks waiting
: --   -  - Crockett and Tubbs make a careful entry
Hands on weapons, carrying bags
What do we got
Five minutes
We see
They clear the room
They check for bugs and external surveillance
They pull curtains
Tubbs from a bag pulls a scanner
Under the two beds
Behind the picture
The lamp
The telephone
Meanwhile
"traps" the room to reveal if it had been searched while they were gone
He aligns the suitcase perfectly parallel on the bench
matchstick goes against the closed closet door ballpoint pen is leaned against the telephone
(cont'd) show time
From his bag Tubbs pulls a Smith & Wesson -frame hammerless in
357 Magnum
He holsters this on his ankle
Remington 780 shotgun with pistol grip, sawed-off to a 12-inch barrel gets slung on a bungee-cord shoulder strap under his right arm
9mm under his shirt in his waistband and two spare magazines clipped to his belt
loads a
45 "race" gun with rounded sights and a magna-ported barrel, cross-drawn, and a blunt
45 Para-Ordnance in the small of his back
They're ready
- opens
Crockett "traps" that door, too, with a small piece of tape
+ All of it tells us that where they are and where they're going is a high wire act without a net
No backup
Their badges don't work
There is no law; there is no order
They are in a state of nature where people get killed for their shoes
: --  () -  +  - wait
Shadows on white limestone monuments
Bird songs
: - They wait
And wait
And nothing happens
They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them
Or what
Who knows
Still apprehensive, concluding they're victims of a "no- show"
That's it
They split
: -    -  +  - approach their door
Crockett stops
The tape "trap" is torn
Weapons appear in their hands
Someone's been here
-  + enter stealthily
Then, they relax
They need not have bothered being so careful about detecting a clandestine surveillance
+ The room is overtly destroyed
Not one piece of furniture is unbroken
Walls have been opened
Pictures ripped
Curtains
Their stuff's strewn all over
And, then
in
in soccer jerseys and shorts with assault rifles
- 's are aimed at Crockett and Tubbs' heads
Crockett's
45 and his Para-Ordnance are in each hand
Tubbs' shotgun is aimed at the front door, his
9mm at the men streaming in the windows
Frozen moment
woman's voice
(
) (to Crockett) Put your guns on the table
(enters, sits) If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami
We wouldn't have brought you all the way here
Really
So, what is this, a party
Crockett + Tubbs put down their weapons
We'll have room service wipe up the furniture
and bring drinks
Isabella says something in French
The Cops ease-up
Isabella's personal security frisks Crockett + Tubbs and remain
Paramilitary leave
Glad we came
This place is a lot of fun if you're Doctors Without Borders
So
Isabella takes off her glasses
She's Afro-Cuban
run down the numbers
Nothing is very negotiable
Small loads
We pay three thousand a ki
We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent
The next ten percent on
landfall
Define small
Two, three thousand a ki
Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000
(beat) Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup
(beat) For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load
(beat) Transactions are offshore
Dollars or euros
Secure internet transfers
We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by , to be avoided
(beat) No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on soil
(beat) That's the deal
thought we had to meet the Man
You do
When
Right now
As she leaves
-  +  - in the back seat on a rural road
Isabella is not with them
One of her Russians is
In the front seat, his  is ready; his eyes never leave Crockett and Tubbs
- military Hummer in the front carries Isabella with her security
Behind is a crew cab with bench seats loaded with Haitian paramilitary
- They approach a town
He nudges Crockett
police roadblock's ahead
has seen something else
He indicates the pager on his waist
' :   - That's what's surprising
Tubbs pulls his cell phone
Meanwhile, they're slowing down for the police roadblock
Crockett gets tense
watches
His cell's    steps down to zero
- stop the caravan
Is this turning bad
- alarmed
- check under the vehicles with mirrors
See all the weapons
Salute
Usher the convoy past
-  + exchange a look
Then they get it
The cops work as security for the narcotrafficker
The caravan advances towards a major intersection
This one is blocked-off by Haitian military
- is snatched open
Haitian soldiers search Crockett and Tubbs
They defer to the Russian-speaking security
Mercedes pulls forward
eyes his pager; Tubbs his cell phone: no signal in an urban area
Blocking signal traffic is something the  does over Baghdad
It's not supposed to be happening in Haiti on a dope deal
+ a third circle of security approach
- carrying automatic weapons, some more casually dressed, some with night-vision goggles
The vehicles stop
Crockett and Tubbs are directed to get out
They're pushed around and searched
working class Glaswegion Scot, a couple of 5'10" Brits are off to the side with short hair and shoulders that are too deep and faces like Rugby players (ex- )
Russians are ex-
Languages overheard:  smatterings of Russian, Hebrew and English
Crockett and Tubbs look at each other:  they get it
This is the cream of private sector security
And it says top dollar infrastructure
+  : Four avenues lead in
Each avenue is blocked
The square is closed down to vehicles and pedestrians
Locals have disappeared
In the center of the square are gestures to Tubbs to look up
They see
:  -  -  + with night-vision goggles
+ are clean
,  + cross through a no-man's land
It feels like being in the open in Kosovo
checks out the first Suburban's uplink satellite dish on a hydraulic mast
The rear's converted into computer equipment sitting in ruggedized racks
- Doors open
The interior has been converted into a luxurious, limo-like office with swivel seats
Isabella followed by Crockett and Tubbs enter
It's occupied by -
He's not flashy
He has smooth skin, slightly opalescent, black eyes
His right arm is normal length, but shriveled
Please take that seat on the side
Thank you
(polite, friendly) Excuse me because  am very busy and have many things to do, so this will be brief
Yes
(beat; not waiting) We will try you on a "run
"  One
To build trust
We do a thousand kis
In all matters, when you work for us, you must do exactly what you say you will do
(beat) In this business with me, if you say you will do a thing, you must do exactly that thing
(beat) Then
You will prosper beyond your dreams and you can live in Miami in millionaire style
(beat) If you are arrested, there will be lawyers made available to you in the United States
You will use them
Anything you need, you will be provided by me
It cost you nothing
You will contact and work through Jose Yero on logistics and communications
To do with money, you will work through my wife, Isabella
Crockett notices that Montoya lightly holds her hand
It's confident
And he sees the slight smile on Isabella's face as she watches he and Tubbs
(cont'd) More than , in finance and business, she is very dangerous look forward to our doing work together
Whether we do or not, it is unlikely we will meet again
So extend my best wishes to your families
(to Tubbs) Particularly to your beautiful wife
(beat) Thank you for making this long trip to see me
Dismissed, they exit
-  : Subterranean alarms are going off
Tubbs finds himself in this small city, occupied by narcotraffickers and their security in the middle of nowhere
Urgency agitates Tubbs
He controls it
in the town square, now, too
But Isabella stayed inside Montoya's Suburban
Now, she lowers her window
break up
Montoya's Suburbans pull out
The security cordon deforms
It all disappears around them
It leaves only the Mercedes, a driver, and Crockett and Tubbs
: looks after the caravan
' :  ' in the side-view mirror on the passenger side
She is looking at him
holds that look
' holds his
Sound deadens
His attention is on the woman in the mirror
until it's broken by Tubbs' attention to his cell phone
' Signal strength returns
Tubbs punches in numbers
(low) who did we just meet
He waits
phone rings
It's picked up by Gina
(
) Hello
Tubbs is relieved
You okay
Yeah
You sure
Yes
What's up
Nothing
Calling to say hi
What's up with you
: ,  - Bored
To Tubbs, that's good news
Okay
see you soon
and thanks for the flowers
- What flowers
The bouquet, here
Five-hundred dollars worth of roses
yellow
Pause
There a note
Pause
You mean with the flowers
What's it say
"Salutations from the south
" deep chill
(cont'd) thought it was from you
And, now, she gets it
Gina is in the kitchen
Alone, in their secret safe-house location
She and Tubbs have nothing to say
He looks to Crockett
The message from Montoya- Londono is clear:   know you
can reach out and locate you our yours
Anytime
We're on our way
-  - (
) (forced casual) So why don't you
meet the plane
We sense this is code
It means get the fuck out of there right now
(cool) Okay
Good idea
(beat) We'll grab a bite
Gina ends the call, drops to the floor to the wall, kills the lights, holds her Sig
9mm at her side as she moves deeper into the interior
: ,  -  +  - 4 Close on their two faces
He's holding her hand under the table
The noise of the surrounding crowd is a
That's the idea
They want their words buried under noise
: discreetly at the door, watching the street
Trudy, Switek and Zito are at adjacent tables
the lease, the phones, the cars
layers of false ident
Would take the  weeks
How long did it take them
Three hours
Four
(re:  the note) This means, "We can reach out and touch somebody
"  Like Bad Teleflora
(cuts in) even if they could run the identities you built to , all they'll find is more cover
Trust what you built
It's quality, girl
We're cool
(leans in; holds his hand tighter) you are trying to reassure me because you know when people get anxious, they make mistakes
You're worried about me
Do not be
(into his eyes) am careful
am cool
got Trudy, backup, whatever
You worry about you
Because you are the ones who are in denied territory, not me
If your focus is on me, you'll miss something coming at you
That's how people slip up
Get hurt
And 'd die if anything happened
You worry about you
You and Sonny
are in the dangerous place
'm fine
Gina leans back in her chair
Their eyes still connect across the distance between them
Their hands still touch
(cont'd) (loud) Fuck 'em
They sent us some flowers
Big deal
Thanks for the flowers
Gina Calabrese shrugs
Tubbs laughs, and we are
-  - 4 Low music
Dark shadows
Half-light washes the walls from passing headlights
Tubbs are Gina are naked
It's the lovemaking of a man and a woman when they hold precious the moments they have because they know that in these moments they are safe
And that the present is fleeting
And they know their time together is about luck
Because life is short
Departure is imminent
Nothing lives forever
It's in their faces and their eyes
: ( , ) -  - lantern lights his face
The night is soft
Crockett's with a couple of campesinos, playing poker and drinking beer
Whoever's shack this is, is a Tupac Shakur freak
His image is on all the walls
diesel truck starts and pulls away outside
-  - checking the cargo tie-downs inside an -500 Adam aircraft
He's sweating
His shirt's off
The cargo is ten black plastic-wrapped and taped bundles
Like any good pilot, Tubbs trusts nobody but himself to tie-down the load
The rear seats are removed
There's a plastic bladder holding a reserve of 50 gallons of AvGas
- wins
The girls shriek
Crockett pushes the money towards the Campesinos
They refuse
Crockett insists
One will only accept the money if Crockett accepts his Randall hunting knife
He does
Tubbs is in the doorway
We set
Crockett kisses the girls, gracious about the gift
Tubbs looks out into the night
To the limit
You worried about the tree line, Customs , or something else on your mind
Like
Gina in the Miami pad
(no answer) You gonna give me phony denials
No
(beat) You gonna give me phony reassurances
No
Good
So let's go
They head toward the strange-looking plane
It's a single fuselage with two propellers
one at the nose, one at the tail
Off the wings are two booms that connect to a rear wing
It's a Burt Rutan aircraft design
There is neither metal nor exposed exhausts for radar or to spot
It does 200 knots at 22,000 feet
It'll fly, forever, 1,000 kilos of flake worth $23 million, and the total air weight is less than two Bentleys
It's the smuggler's dream airplane
-    - -500 heads for the tree-line
It will not make it
At the last moment, Tubbs pulls back the stick and the plane lofts over the trees, clipping the tops
-500 - throws a look sideways at Tubbs
- -500 airborne over the Caribbean, heading north
(
) (into radio) Transglobal Airlines flight zero- zero-zero
is in the air
(
) Roger that
-500 -  - is dozing
signal
Tubbs points up and to the right
Crockett wakes, looks
An Aero Commander Turbo Twin is paralleling the -500's course
Now, it slides over them
almost into a collision
It sits right over the -500, separated by only 75 feet
-    -   - handling a myriad of flights, reacts
On his radar he sees next to the image of the Aero Commander, a ghost image
Eleven-ten, Sierra, do you have a visual on another aircraft
-  +  - Switek is flying and looks down at the -500 below
Negative, Opa-Locka
-    - keys his radio
Opa-Locka Air Traffic Control to 0-seven-six-Nellie-Charlie
(
) Hello, Opa-Locka
What's up
've got an Aero Commander coming in on a two-seventy-nine heading, but  had a double image
like there's another plane there, now 'm only picking up on one
What do you read
- Let me see
His  (Forward Looking Infrared) picks up Switek and Zito's Air Commander
He flips through all the different modalities of detection, including thermography, for anything else suspicious in the airspace
(into mic) Too many Mai Tais at lunch
You're seeing double
One blip
One plane
-  : -500 We get the joke
The -500 with its stealthiness under the Aero Commander together like a single footprint
: piggybacked, enter  airspace and cross the coastline into Florida
From underneath, the Aero Commander sweeps to the right on approach as Tubbs radically dives for the trees, hugging the contour at 220 knots at 150 feet
having snuck this plane and its load into the United States of America
: 6 ,   - --  - Alone in the acid-yellow glare of the sodium vapor lights
We wait
We don't know why we're here
- and we  staked-out are Crockett, Jean-Louis and Tubbs
Neptune gonna show
We don't know who he's talking about
- Oh, he'll show
This is his kind of deal
Crime on crime
Who's gonna call the cops
(skeptical) Usually his thing is street dealers
Torture their families until they cough up the stash
This
- He's ambitious
Heads up
Lights off
Cruises through the parking lot past the -Haul- It to the other side and disappears
(cont'd) That's slick:  Neptune's Escalade's worth more than the real estate
But no one's supposed to notice his drive-by
Here's another incognito genius
: cruises the other end of the parking lot
The Escalade returns
All's clear
Both converge around the -Haul-It truck
Out of the Escalade steps  - 6'4", narrow- shouldered and bald
From the Malibu and back of the Escalade, Four more Haitian   with handguns, shotguns and shades
pops the lock on the -Haul-It with a crowbar
He rolls up the door expecting millions worth of cocaine
Instead he comes face to face with the barrel of a 12-gauge
April Fool, motherfucker
Trudy whips the butt end of the shotgun around, caving in Neptune's cheekbone and nose
- goes down for the count
Switek - under the truck - rolls out
Crockett, Tubbs with shotguns, Jean-Louis and Zito with -15s emerge from the perimeter with bright lights on shouting for the Haitians to freeze
(Patois) Arrete
Arrete
Freeze
(to one) Et vous, mo-fo
250-lb
brings up his weapon
Crockett the guy's legs out from under him
Zito disarms him
The other two are disarmed
is rolled over by Crockett
He plastic-ties his wrists and feet
Others are manhandled
- (in French) Get the fuck in the truck
Zo Pounders, plastic-tied, are thrown into the truck with the thousand kilos of cocaine
But not Neptune
The gate is rolled down and padlocked
: -  - staring at his satellite cell
Waiting
He looks out the window at the passing river
Soft voices from another room
probably Tubbs and Gina
It's five in the morning
It rings
He answers
(
) Client got delivery
But there were
"extras" in the back of the truck
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight
(beat) And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"
do
We don't do business with him
He tried to
"do business"
with you
Around ten
His place
Be there
'll be there
-       - cruises storefront churches, chacouteries, Baptist missions, Haitian restaurants and palm trees
Men in dark trousers and white shirts lean in doorways
The  preceding Yero stops three houses before us
The Excursion with Yero stops two houses beyond
Security - very casually - deploys
, Yero approaches
seen through the curtains of the window we're looking through
Reveal Tubbs watching
And, he crosses to the door and opens it as Yero cautiously enters
- And his face registers surprise
Look familiar
Carefully stacked in the living room are the - '
Hog-tied and bleeding all over his clothes, in the corner is Neptune
His mouth is taped
He's shaking his head
disclaiming, disowning and disavowing
This the load you lost a while back
It is
He try to take tonight's load
Yeah
And what do  do with him
(shrugs) Whatever you want
Like we said, we're not into violence
Yero looks around the corner and sees Switek and Zito in the dining room, casually at ease with Galil assault rifles
meaning "don't even think about it"
: -   - The empty mansion is on its own peninsula
Through the windows we see a yacht and Crockett's 48' Stryker, its canopy open but without its racing supergraphics
The mansion interior
all Beaumaniers limestone
is devoid of all furnishing
They sit on white plastic garden chairs from Sears
(suspicious) walk into Neptune's house
very nice
But  also see you
and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda
You don't like us finding your load
We can go and lose it all over again
How 'bout this
How'd Neptune know where to hit us
Huh
Whose Op sec's got a leak
Yours
What'd Neptune tell you
He didn't
Interrogation's not in our skill set
(beat) So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations
(whispers in Spanish to Isabella) Here's what this is
ask how much they want to turn back to us our load
Yero's certain about their motive
We want it back
Okay
What's the recovery
How much are you looking for
(to Crockett) How much we looking for
Nothing
What's "nothing"
Nothing
As in "free, gratis
" And as an investment in the future
(takes off her glasses and looks at Crockett) "Future" of
fine
business
relationship
She holds Crockett's look
as she did before
It's yours cause what's yours, is yours
And what's ours is ours
(to Yero) like the second ten-percent, which is now due, Yero, my ace
Isabella gestures
Yero kicks across the floor a cardboard box full of money
Tubbs glances inside
Doesn't count it
(cont'd) What's up next
Or is this a one- time deal
Isabella decides
(to Yero) Give them the shipment on the seventeenth
Yero doesn't like it
She gestures "do it
" Conveyance
Maritime
Jose will fill you in
And she starts to leave
and sensing Crockett's gotten up and follows her
Meanwhile (to Yero) Lay it out
And Crockett, close behind Isabella, now
(low) There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product
(low) And what is that
This is the wife of narcotrafficker Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono
Let me buy you a drink
Isabella pauses
Crockett may get killed right now
They're near the open doors to the patio
(low) What do you like to drink
(low) 'm a fiend for mojitas
Isabella looks over at Crockett's boat
Back to Crockett
(low) How fast does that go
It goes very fast
Show me
Isabella and Crockett head outside towards the dock, Tubbs overtakes
Can  talk to you for a second, partner
They step aside
(cont'd) (low, re:  Isabella) Wha's up
(low) know what 'm doing
And he leaves to help Isabella board
Switek unties and pushes off the boat
Looking out the window at them is Jose Yero, as perplexed as Tubbs, who covers
secure satellite comms
encrypted e-mail, the longs and lats for the transshipment point
all that
It's all cool
But  need a vector, not a location
'Cause ships move
That's why they call them ships
Ship stops
It's trying to be an apartment building
At sea that attracts attention
That's bad
Meanwhile
,  -  + pulling away from the docks at 12 knots, repressing the thunder of the 2,700-horsepower engines
Crockett leaves the canopy slid back
They're open to the air
He gives Isabella headsets so they can talk over the roar
The wind starts to move her hair
She's not sure how to put on the headset
Crockett lets the boat rock over the swells while he arranges her headset around her ears
His fingers brush her hair, touch her skin
It was not intentional
But the look in Crockett's eyes is as if a small voltage passed through him
He plugs her headset into the dash, regains the wheel, shoves the throttles forward and
- "  " cuts and then leaps over swells
In seven seconds they're doing over 70 knots
And Crockett holds it there as
The wind whips her hair behind her, now
The two are small against the smooth 50' long hull
Crockett hands her wraparound shades for her eyes
She doesn't want them
(through headset) So where's the best place for mojitas
Bodeguita del Medio
It's the only place for mojitas
Where's that
Off a little alley with cobblestones
Hemingway went there
The Keys
Havana
Havana
Cubans don't like us or my business
Are you afraid
(smiles; Crockett shakes his head "no") Good
And you don't need a visa
Cause you're with me
-  "  " - rockets from one swell to the next, getting airborne
Wind and salt electrify Isabella
She turns to Crockett and smiles, putting on the glasses, now
Crockett gestures to her knees
She should keep them bent
Crockett pushes it to 75 knots
:   + in strong light, ripped by wind
Behind them are ocean and sky and twenty-foot plumes which jet from the props and make a wake that vectors in diagonals to what each is leaving behind them
where they've been
and converge to push them to the new places where they're headed
Behind, the skies are leaden
They're racing a storm
Sunlight shafts through a gap in thunderclouds, turning the clouds yellow
Now, they turn peach against the darkening open water and the grey sky behind
The boat vibrates, the engines scream and
waves her over to join him behind the wheel
He holds out his left hand to steady her
He brings her to him
Both lean against his high upholstered chair
He holds her to his side
Indicates the wheel
Light touch
Everything comes to you through the wheel
stays on the throttle, throttling back when the props are out of the water so you don't redline the engine and forward when reentering
The swells are now four feet
They launch off each, get airborne, cut into the next
(cont'd) How do we get into Cuba
My cousin is the harbor master
You must not bring in drugs
You cannot be armed
If you're carrying, it has to go
Or stow it inside
No one will go near your boat
You do business in Cuba with your husband
never do business in Cuba
(beat) And nobody goes to Cuba but me
(smiles) And he is not my husband
Crockett's surprised
And he doesn't push it
Were you born in Havana
Angola
My mother was being a surgeon there
She volunteered
Mozambique and Mali, too
(over the wind) those days, in those days
she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world
She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado
we still have the house
We will go there
Where's she now
She's dead
Crockett looks at her
Her perspective is that of the '60's and '70's, the politics of national liberation, the perspective of Marcuse and Franz Fanon
Your father
Angolan Military
Went back to the fighting
Disappeared
Who knows
Isabella looks at the look on Crockett's face
(cont'd) Go ahead and ask
How's he not your husband
am no one's wife
live in my own house
do not live in a man's house
He has a wife
We are together
am free
Because of banking and finance and travel
(looks at him, shouts over wind) And  can do anything  want
She laughs
She has that combination of intellect, beauty and youth
Everything is possible
life will never end
she can ride this crest eternally
And Crockett knows that her confidence makes her oblivious to peril, makes "right now" too real because she believes she will live forever
can't help it
He looks right at her
She lifts her face to the spray
Some clouds part and light strikes her
And Crockett wants to possess her; to protect her
He wants no one else to have her
He wants no harm to come to her
And this is an impulse that takes him over to the core of who he is
And, as we   , Crockett has to turn away
sees this
She's quizzical
Crockett looks back at her
Their eyes connect
"  " leaps
his left arm around her shoulder, his right on the wheel
She rocks back against his body
They rip across the seas
: "" -       - 14-piece Afro-Cuban band
dancers at a small table, Crockett and Isabella
(shouts over noise) Mojitas
(shouting back) Later
Do you dance
dance
They move into the crowd under two-story high windows overlooking Meyer Lansky's Hotel Riviera - freeze-dried 1959 Las Vegas
+ Whatever we knew about Sonny Crockett, we did not know he could dance
Their feet, their knees and thighs, perfectly matched, they samba, like lightning
He swings her around and turns her to a close embrace as their hips and legs parallel each other's, as he turns her under his arm, stops her, pulls her backwards into his body, her hips into his, the fast beat, the footwork, and he spins her back facing him, pressing her closer as it gets faster and
: -  + fall onto a bed, shedding the last of their clothes, making love in a house somewhere
Beyond them is an open window to the ocean
The sky turns red and grey but the water stays molten
Their eyes are open
because they're locked together the whole time and their faces are steady and urgently surprised because this is not language; not a symbol, not a representation of a thing
Jesus Montoya is not here
Miami is not here
This is discovery
This is fact
They have discovered each other and have never felt like this about anyone before in their lives
: ,  -  - His eyes open
He wakes up
Light and situation flood in
He does not know where he is
He pulls on his pants
Barefoot, he walks to the window
The interior is high- ceilinged with immaculately polished floors
And Crockett looks around, a stranger in a stranger place
- enters
The paint on the outside of this house is peeling and patinaed with stain
The yard is overgrown
The stucco fence around the streamline deco facade is crumbling from weather and time
from the balcony of the futuristic villa in Verdado futurism from 1939, peeling aqua, aging science fiction
Wherever we are in the world, this place is out of the stream, outside history
And Isabella, this woman from a different world, enters, brings him an oversized cup of coffee
In his trousers, Crockett drapes an arm across her shoulders and they stand in the air
hears voices from the interior
My aunt
She's ancient
She looks after the place
(beat) This was my mother's family's home
: -  +  - in the funky yellow restaurant drinking mojitas
They've had lunch served to them at the bar
Frosted glasses have sugar on the bottom and are loaded with crushed Cuban herbs
The bartender has been there for 40 years
Crockett and Isabella look like regulars
They've served chicken and plantains
Like any restaurant, the people eating at the bar are the regulars
They sit where Hemingway sat in the slow part of the afternoon
Tell me everything
No
insist
(flip) Okay
(beat) Macon, Georgia is where  was born
Wound up in a juvenile facility was 14
Then the military
Then prison
Because  was dumb and angry
Then  read
Then  got smart
Then  discovered what know, now
it's all business
Isabella smiles
(cont'd) (to Bartender) My friend, two more
(beat) What was your mother's name
Blanca
a rubio like you
(pause) see her in a dress
an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding
everybody is with couples
Husbands and wives
They all pose
My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting
(she points) she looks right into the camera
She is the most beautiful woman in the room
By herself
In a party dress
And she looked like she knew she would die alone
(beat
remembers) She spoke many languages
We were in Luanda when she died
went to her friends in Mali
They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where met Montoya in the discos
He had banking there
was seventeen and very much into the clubs
And he sent me to University for an in Finance
(pause) Your mother
Died in childbirth, having me
To mothers
And all that we owe them
Isabella looks at Crockett and smiles and puts on her sunglasses
You know how improbable this is
"Probable"
applies to an event that may be real
Doesn't apply here
'cause we have no future
are of today and not tomorrow
(laughs) That's right
and therafore there is no consequence
Exactly
Crockett's hand is around her waist and slips down her hip as he pulls her closer and takes off her glasses and she puts down her drink and kisses him at the bar and Crockett's eyes dwell on her and she looks back at him and, now, knowing what he's thinking
: -   - The water is like sheet metal as clouds allow only a sliver of light to illuminate the sea while rain greys-out most of it
Minute crimson is a freighter heading to the stone harbor
Fabric billows in the wind
into the room to Crockett and Isabella
one light skinned, the other brown, intertwine in the opiated moments after sensuality
The afternoon half-light drapes parts of their bodies, making a relief against which their eyes hold each other's
: -  - focused elsewhere
It's as if he's struggling to record the event of her in memory so she'll sustain there, because he compels himself to a different place, now
Then, the shower curtain parts
It startles him
enters
She touches his back
He turns to her with a smile
(soft) Let's talk deliveries
Isabella is not let down by the switch to commerce
She merely goes there, too
After all, this is their subject
Soft smiles
(cont'd) and a different kind of deal
Like
Like "three thousand a ki
"  That's nice
And  can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx
But, three per ki was for openers
And why should continuing excellence cost more
Cost less
That's the point
Is it December
What do you mean
Did Christmas come early this year
Better than that
(beat) We become partners
Only in this territory and only on loads we run
And you don't pay us three thousand a ki
You pay us zero
Why we get is thirty percent of the load
Product or cash
"And why," you're thinking, "would  be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that
Is he chipping
Crazy for my love
Too many mojitas
"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no
It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can
" Good samba dancing
Zero risk
'Cause you don't lose loads
'Cause we guarantee every load
(beat) Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good
Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free
And you're our thirty-percent partner
Her knowing smile speaks of experience beyond her years
(cont'd) (deadly seriously) What if  tell you that your ideas are too big for your skin
(beat) That merely to propose this is a dangerous thing
Then  would say to you, this has been fun
There's a long pause
This is business
This is what is
The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the
to even consider it
need thirty
Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front
Available cash is not an issue for us
Twenty-eight-point-five
What if  pushed to twenty-one
would say you're
(hesitates; holds up four fingers) four percentage points away from a deal
Maybe 'm only one
And she slides into his arms
And smiles
We'll do it at twenty-two
Isabella laughs
She kisses him under the shower water
And it's tough to know who is pushing it further out onto the edge
(cont'd) and now what
And now  make you breakfast again
Her breathing is heavier as she buries her head in his neck
: - Crockett is alone
Black skies mottled with grey
Rain and wind rip across his face
He left Isabella in Havana
rings
Crockett picks it up
It's Tubbs
(
) Where the hell are you, man
(into phone) On my way back
Crockett disconnects
He pushes it
It launches from one swell, airborne, and knifes into the next
It's violent
Crockett's thoughts and expression are about Isabella
They are criminal conspirators, a woman cheating on her narcotrafficker "husband," an outlaw smuggler who's really an undercover cop
:    - "  " rockets in and then throttles back
: -  - sitting on the -shaped jetty as we  Crockett kill the engines, tying it off
Gina stands halfway up the small lawn to the early 60's ranch house under tropical palms
Tubbs' mood is dark
As Crockett approaches, he looks blankly at Tubbs, offering no explanation
(mutters) The meet with Castillo and the fed got set up
It's in 45 minutes
Tubbs goes inside
Crockett follows
As he passes Gina
What's up, Sonny
Crockett looks at her
He has no answer
- enters
While Tubbs is strapping up
Where'd you go
Hit a couple of jazz clubs
Fell back to her place
Where
Verdado
Verdado where
It's in the suburbs outside Havana
Havana, Cuba
No
Havana, Louisiana
(beat) Don't we have a meet
where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya
No
You're not makin' a move on her
We're makin' moves on each other
Oh, that makes it okay, then
: -     -     - We've entered a secret meeting mid-argument
Who said, "go exploring"
We want this staying on track
(to Fujima) Who's the "we"
There's you and there's us
And all we got from you was bad intel
"Low-level producer
"  Yeah, right
What are you talking about
Montoya
We went to meet the village priest
It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope
of the North Valle Colombia dope trade
His operations are kingpin size and first-class
His security is ex- Eastern bloc, ex- and Israelis
Their comms are satellite uplink with mainframe encryption, significant Sig Int and in their zones of activity, they have signal- jamming capability
Fujima is surprised
Yeah
-level stuff
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you
Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow
Out of
Haiti and Puerto Rico
Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe
Their loads are poly-drug
"" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "
" Mid-ocean transshipments
His real business is:  he's a network
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out
So we want to change-up the mission statement
(no) Identify and indict the white supremacist group of importers
End of story
Everything else 'm hearing is speculation masquerading as intel
Crockett flips him a set of keys
(cont'd) What's this
Keys to the boat
Go do this motherfucker yourself
Fujima looks at Castillo
who is this insubordinate prick
Who are you talking to
He's talking to you, bro
(beat) What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization
(re: Fujima) Hey, fuck him
Chill out Sonny
We're the ones doing the death- defying shit
And he wants us to give that up
For what
chump-change bust so he can get his picture in The Miami Herald to impress the slug farm in
(to Castillo) Control your men
'm my own man
And anytime you want to see how much man  am
(low) That's
It
Everybody shuts up
(cont'd) (to Tubbs) Where are you on this
We know Tubbs has doubts about Crockett's motives and methods, nevertheless
With Sonny
110%
Then that's it
(to Fujima) Change the mission statement
Crockett stays in
He keeps working up the ladder
The local importers get a pass for the time being
don't know
Yes you do
got to talk to my
No, you don't, Jim
(beat) 'Cause if  close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about
And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process
Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure
So, right here, right now, they're back in or  pull them out and close you down
What's it going to be
Fujima nods acquiescence
Okay
He leaves
When he's out of earshot
(to Crockett) You fuckin' better be right
: -  +  - step across to a second ship among the dozens tied-up along the river
Its crimson paint is peeling and it's been stripped of everything salvageable
They're alone
(low) What is going on
As in
There is "undercover
"  And there is "Which way is up
" You think  am in so deep  forgot
am asking
You to me
Do you believe
have forgotten am a cop
would never doubt you
This is the answer Crockett needed to hear
(cont'd) And do you doubt  will slot anyone complicit in the death of Maria, Alonzo and those children
Anyone
whoever they are
No,  do not
And we know that might mean Isabella
,  ,  - - We are on a peninsula with palm trees
bluff dotted with a small forest of satellite dishes
ribbon of white-sand and beyond that is silver light off the water
It is rural and futuristic at the same time
(
) 90- and 120-day futures with shorted Canadian and  dollars
: -    - in pajama top and boxer shorts, smoking a cigar
In a sweatsuit is Isabella, delivering a financial report
It's from memory
Nothing is written down, in the tradition of the elite section of Swiss private banking in which clerks commit portfolios to memory
There are no documents
and we're looking at Nigerian crude
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship
Not French registry
They've been targeted
And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now
Jose doesn't like the deal in South Florida
Montoya's referring to Crockett
Alarm bells go off
(cuts in) Burnett
(shrugs) They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida
It's the Juarez cartel model
They guarantee the loads
The upside is our risk goes to zero
That frees-up capital
But what does your intuition tell you
Is he suspicious
Does he suspect Isabella and Crockett are lovers
My "intuition"
My intuition made him breakfast the other morning in Havana
Her lieson with Crockett is the last thing we expected to hear from Isabella
And
They're serious
They're cautious
They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled
they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security
that's good
Montoya's thoughtful
(cont'd) But they have to be watched closely
Why
good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily
He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever
Life is dust, make it while you can
He's ambitious
Montoya appreciates her thoughtfulness
(cont'd) So  predict a few good runs
Then there'll be a renegotiation
That's my girl
Montoya uses Isabella and her sexual allure to gather insight into the people he does business with
That's part of their deal
(cont'd) On the next load, Jose wants to front them silver
But they them in lead
(beat) He thinks they are wrong
What do you think
(revealing nothing) think Jose suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate
And people, who are good at what they do
They have egos, too
(careful) What would you do
(equally careful) like the diminished risk
It frees up capital reserves
like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent
You can predict their behavior
Montoya looks at her very carefully
She stares right back at him
(cont'd) On the other hand
if what you wish, mi corazon, is la plumba
the lead
Then let's do that
Accept their deal
After the load is received
we will close their eyes forever
She looks at Montoya squarely
It hangs in the air
In his strange process of decision-making, Montoya reaches a conclusion
Let's try a few runs with these partners,  think
will tell Jose
If Isabella is pleased, she doesn't show it
Montoya continues to stare at her unwavering expression, frozen in stone
He smiles, then, and starts to take off her clothes
He reaches for her hand and brings her to him
She kisses him and he puts aside his cigar, pulls her face into his neck, and she runs her hands down him
: ,   -  G3 - lands
The door opens
Isabella emerges
she searches, looking for someone as she descends the ramp
Then
emerges from behind an
He came to meet her plane
' expression changes, but she masks it
Businesslike, she walks across the tarmac
There are two Suburbans
One for her; one full of security
Crockett and her meet
No show of affection
Her Secretary, carrying her briefcase, accompanies her towards the second Suburban
-  - opens
Crockett and Isabella climb in
The rear is customized cream leather, luxurious with three telephones and a divider
As Isabella climbs in, followed by Crockett, she takes the briefcase from the Secretary and indicates he ride in the front vehicle
Doors close
Windows go up
Air conditioning comes on
She raises the divider, blocking the driver and locks the doors
They are sealed in the back
Alone
And she assaults Crockett with a passion that's desperate
as if making love to him puts her world back in balance
Their clothes come off, Crockett pauses
Hola, chica
Hola, viejo
He touches the side of her face
(') Don't stop, bad man
As they continue, we
: -  +  - at the bar
It's jammed
"Cochi Loco" Yero and his permanent bodyguard, El Tiburon, pass, smile
Tubbs introduces Yero to Gina, as his wife
Yero shakes Gina's hand
He indicates to the bartender that Tubbs and Gina are to pay for nothing
and he moves towards an office
Cobalt blue light illuminates his face, and his fierce yellow eyes are not filled with hospitality
: (  ) -  - deplaning his -4 crosses to his armored Suburban
- climbs into the back
It's also a traveling communications center, satellite uplink, encryption, the works
(to an Assistant) Do you have him
Assistant nods
Montoya takes the heavy handset
(cont'd) Jose, about the Americans
: ,  - (in Spanish) They are "wrong
"   do not trust them
(
) (in Spanish) Why
(in Spanish) Too good at what they do,  don't know
Something  don't like
They are wrong
Montoya thinks
(
) (in Spanish) Isabella likes them
We made their deal
Montoya hangs up
Jose Yero looks at the phone
: -  +  - enter
They join Tubbs and Gina
sees Crockett's carriage with this woman
It's different
Intuitively, she exchanges a look with Tubbs
Crockett makes introductions
Then, they move away to dance to a fast samba in perfect synchronicity
And, they're also  by
He watches them, too
His yellow eyes are lit by strobes
His eyes locked onto Isabella
dancing with Crockett, their bodies close
And in the way he looks at them, hurt, like a betrayed lover, which he isn't and never could have been
we know now, the core of his antagonism
: ,   -  - It's a 30 year old, well-maintained carribean freighter with a steel table and u-shaped bench
In the dark interior, narrow spots reveal the group hovering over a ruggedized Workpad with navigational software
Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd
Uh-uh
No predetermined places and times to meet
Give me their heading and radio codes and  will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal
You give yours to me
We position all the assets hauling our loads
Now how we do it, blood
It risks signal interception and other bad things like people who don't need to know where we're at knowing
Tubbs hands Jose Yero's assistant, El Tiburon, a pager
At ten to three on the 27th,  will satellite page him with a website and encryption code
He will have ten minutes to log on and receive his new heading
Ten minutes and thirty seconds, website disappears and he can drive his fucking boat up to Iceland
Jose Yero doesn't like it
Malaysian registry
Small containership
(to El Tiburon) Give them their codes and heading
Everything Yero tells them feels to him like exposure
Packaging
Fifty-gallon drums
Thirty-two hundred kilos in each
You transship that to the Malaysian boat
Importation value
At twenty-two thousand a ki
You work that out with La Senora
(beat) You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship
For collection in North Miami
You warehouse it
Release it when we say
(beat) 'm sure you have friends with fast boats
If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy
And Jose, my ace, lots of transshipment
Lots of action
Skies are crowded
And the  has assets on land, air, and sea
(beat) So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare
Jose Yero's on the spot
Sure
Check your e-mail
Yero gets up and leaves the confined dining room
He exits onto the walkway outside the bridge
His path takes him past
- with Switek and Zito
Trudy's in a tank top
Jose looks at Trudy appreciatively
returns the look with a stare that says, "Don't fuck with me"
Jose raises his eyebrow and after noting the two handguns holstered in the waistband of her hiphuggers
: -   + walk
Cochi Loco's security leads and tails behind as
(to El Tiburon) You know what Escobar used to do
What
(goes on) In the '80's, air routes came into favor
It required many pilots
The best were American
Former crop-dusters
They didn't fly by the book
Tell one:  "Put that 747 down on this fifteen-hundred-foot runway
"  Somehow, he'd do it
Great pilots
But Pablo had a rule
After they flew six loads
this good pilot who facilitates so much good business
he would come back to Medellin or Barranquilla to pick up the next load
(beat) And no one would ever see him again
He'd disappear
(imitates Pablo) "You a good pilot
Make a lot of money for Pablo
Thank you very much
"  And then Pablo would kill his ass
After six loads
(pause) And who was Pablo Escobar provincial who got busted-out by the white collars from Cali
When the gringos got him, he was nobody
We're three times better than Pablo Escobar
(beat) The means we kill these sonsabitches three times sooner
(beat) And do you know why Pablo Escobar did that
Why
He didn't like pilots
,   -   + enter from the cargo shed onto a roadway just as
: passes by, driven by Switek
They're en route to pick up Tubbs
(') And put eyes on her
Put eyes on her twenty-four hours a day
: -  + ,  +  - Isabella hands out banana leaves wrapped and tied around cooked rice and barbecued pork
Gina and Tubbs walk away down the beach towards phosphorescent waves
forgot the napkins
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies
What's the best fortune you ever got
They're all the same
"Financial security is around the corner
" "Your friends love you
" In Kowloon, once,  got one that said, "Live now because life is dust
" Crockett and Isabella wander down the beach, hard from the ebb tide
Do you have assets somewhere else
Bank accounts
Why
to fall back on
You know, a fail-safe
Insurance
Do  need it
(shrugs) Everybody needs it
Ask Prudential
Or Allstate
(laughs) 'Cause whatever can go wrong, will
The Perseids make the night sky over the water look like the Fourth of July
Something like that
The odds catch up with you
The odds are like gravity
You can't negotiate with them
(then) So
at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run
(smiles) Really
Sure
As far away and as fast as you can
When
Whenever
Maybe later, maybe sooner
What is Sonny Crockett trying to say to her
Would you find me
Of course
Where would  go
Zanzibar
The Comoros Islands
Somewhere in the Indian Ocean
There's twelve-hundred islands there
(smiles) Is this the protective male talk
(deadly serious) This is the talk of a man
if he were your husband
he would never put you at risk
He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you
And if  were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be
few more moments, still in this business
Then 'd find you
Would you
Because if you couldn't,  would be very lonely
would have left the only world know and have known since  was seventeen
(smiles, touches Crockett) But none of this will happen
So it doesn't matter
Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula
And all you see around you
look around
is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono
He is my man
And you are a smuggler moving a load
Her eyes say that she listened to his warnings and will disregard them
Life is dust
Meaning is in the moment, and that's right now
The intensity is because it's impossible
Because it's impossible, they've been free to imagine
And that's made the heat of it stronger
in the morning
'll be on board by noon
Crockett didn't expect that
(cont'd) What did you think
This deal with you is my deal
am responsible
She vouched for him
She has to stand behind it
He puts his arm around her waist
: ,  -  +  - The Freighter is anchored a half mile offshore
Magenta breaks the horizon
Trudy looks at Crockett, looks away
Go ahead
Too fast
Too many moving parts
Switek
Zito joins them
Same
But it's your call, boss
Tubbs joins them
What's your take
What's the point
It's going down
Call the  Coast Guard:  "Come and arrest our ass
" (beat) And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine
Crockett looks at Trudy
There's a connection between Crockett and Trudy
It's filial
Crockett has a special regard for her judgment
If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one
Then you should
(no) If you're down, we're down for the play
: -  - drives up
Parks
She approaches along the sidewalk, down the walkway under the banana trees and birds of paradise
Motion sensors trigger exterior lights
Gina cocks her ear, waiting to hear
Then, offscreen, Tommy the dog barks
Reassured, her left hand on her
380, she reaches for her keys, opens the door
- finger pushed the stop button
The dog stops barking
:    - enters
-
a leather sap arcs through the air and descends onto her left shoulder, paralyzing her arm
Other arms grab her, push her head down
The same sap backhands with massive force across the back of her neck
: -  - :   - slowly comes to consciousness
She looks around, disoriented
Her eyes roll back in her head and she slips into dreamland for a moment
She rouses and opens her eyes again, blinks, disoriented
: stares at her from the back corner of the double-wide trailer
With her is an overweight autistic Boy of about 11
He plays in the corner and watches a small  with a coat hanger for an antenna
The Old Woman pays Gina no attention On her face is zero affect
There are other sounds in the room
: and we see she is tied to a chair that is bolted to the floor
Her clothes are disheveled and ripped
She tries to focus
Then somebody's thick arms are fitting something around her neck
blindfold goes over her eyes
Around her neck is a -4 "necklace" like the one we saw on Stevens' wife in the beginning of the film
The arms and back belong to the deep- chested Aryan Brother we saw from the Stevens' house and Coleman's double-wide
He reaches below the frame and does something
Gina writhes away from him in the chair
He laughs
He backs away from her to camera
and holds something in his hand
He takes a digital picture
: -   - tall wall of planting hides the $150,000 house from the road
Neighbors are double-wide trailers
The house has some sophisticated radio antennas as well as a twelve-foot satellite dish
On the driveway are two Escalades and a Bentley
Out the back, off the dock is a two-million dollar sports/fishing boat
Someone's entering numbers on a cell phone
- waits
The guy working the cell phone is the buzz-cut Aryan Brother we saw in the Stevens kitchen in the opening
Coleman's shirt open in the Barcalounger watching
His watch is loaded with ice, and a four-carat diamond in his ear
He is all white bling
Coleman's tattooed up
Not with "cool" Celtic symbols
his tats are neo-Nazi, white supremacist, hard-core prison stuff
in the hands of the deep-chested Aryan Brother
Three girls in cutoffs and halters are making sandwiches and laughing in the b
g
Then: El Tiburon
Coleman takes the satellite phone, attached to a laptop
He enters a number
frequency-response graphic displays in the computer
His conversation with El Tiburon is encrypted so the voices are distorted
So
(in Spanish) Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route
(perfect Spanish) All  want to know is the where and the when
Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit
(in Spanish) Okay
You got the "item"
got the item
(in Spanish) And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you
(in Spanish) How many
(in Spanish) Two main players plus three
(in Spanish) My end
(in Spanish) 25% discount on the load
(in Spanish) Make it 40%
(in Spanish) Make it 35
Deal
Coleman hangs up
- In calm seas they're tied up to a Malaysian small container ship
On it, Yemenese with -47s maintain a watchful eye
From Crockett's  as
:  , , with an assortment of -15s, Galils and two RPGs mount a similar guard
- swung by the Honduran freighter's crane cross 10' of open water onto freighter's deck to join 18 others already there
It's the last of the transfer
- (loud hailer) Me-a salama
Ila l-liqa
- Yeah
Whatever
(waves) - separate
,  - watches crew stow the cargo
Then, his satellite phone blinks red light
Crockett boots up the computer to encryption
Picks up the phone
Yeah
(
) (phone filter) Hey, Captain Kirk
think maybe have second thoughts
Tubbs enters
(into phone) You got something to say, Jose, let's hear it
confess  have succumbed to my weaknesses
An inability to see another's point of view
(beat) 've discussed it with professionals
Even with one of your friends
She's here now
Crockett puts him on speaker
(cont'd) (beat) So  want you to deliver my product, how  want my product delivered
Isabella walks in
Crockett gestures for her to be quiet
What friend
Mrs
Rico
But don't worry
She is safe
To insure that,  am keeping her close to me
It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you
Tubbs reaches for the phone
Trudy intercepts him
Crockett turns it away and goes off the speaker
(cont'd) So,  will tell you when you're 10 minutes out where to drop the load into the hands of my people
You have 35 minutes to enter Government Channel
Head up the River
We will watch you
Then  will call you
(beat) And you can reach out for La Senora in Barranquilla or wherever 'cause don't give a shit
Jose Yero does  know Isabella's on board
Proof of life
How do  know Mrs
Rico's alive
'Cause she will tell you
He hangs up
That sonofabitch
(turns on Isabella) You set this up
(sarcastic) Of course
That is why  placed myself here, with you, knowing Yero would pull this crap
Yero doesn't know she's here
Crockett looks at Isabella, who's distracted in calculating what's really happening
(entering) Cigarette and the two Starkeys are coming in
(senses) What
They grabbed Gina
Isabella punches numbers into a satellite phone
No results
It's all bullshit
Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu
Jose knows that
Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own
And he will need a story
Meaning
They will kill you
And then they will kill your wife, too
Yero, by himself
Maybe
Maybe with the crazy whites
Zito enters, makes the situation
We're half loaded
Gina
Like Alonzo's wife
Cochi Loco's got her
Dump the rest
Let's get the boats up that river
Crockett picks up the phone and dials
His eyes contact with Tubbs has Tubbs take Isabella out of the Captain's Bridge
She pulls her arm away
As they head down from the bridge
we see
- --- lines run from the freighter to two go-fast boats
The fuel bladders with crampons slide down the rope into the smaller "cigarette" boats
"dope-on-a-rope
" : loaded, takes off into the night, no lights
second one pulls away as the third boat's being loaded; Switek and Zito climb into a cigarette
Meanwhile
,  - on the satellite phone
He waits
(
) (filter) Yeah
Jose Yero changed-up the drop plan on us
He's grabbed Gina
Where's the new drop point
They'll have surveillance on us
We'll know only at the last moment
What do you think
It's a rip and a hit
(to someone else) Get me Air Support
(to Crockett) We'll be airborne and assault the ambush
You can't
They'll kill Gina
They may have already, so we protect the living
Proof she's alive
Supposedly it's coming
- ,  + rip from one swell to another, airborne, in between their load
Trudy's on the comms
Switek drives with night-vision gear
- ,  + Crockett drives
Tubbs is on the throttles
Isabella's between them
Then, Tubbs is sent a page
Reads the number
Picks up the satellite phone
Crockett takes control of the throttles, too
(into phone) Hello
And Tubbs hears
"And weather on the southeast throughout today and looking into the weekend is broken clouds, humidity 78%, small chance of rain
And coming up in four minutes at 5:45 is Lou Dobbs with Friday's market previews
" (
) Welcome, folks
Today's Friday, the three-hundredth-and-fourteenth day of the year
They're proving it's right now
And that she's alive right now
(
) nice friends you got
Trailer trash with a bad smell
-  -  - The phone is ripped away from her
It's disconnected
: - He puts it together
Smell
Bad smell
Trailer
(he gets it) She's allergic to diethylene
she in a meth lab
Crockett takes the phone, dials Castillo
Just came in
She's still alive
Safe house is empty
(beat) Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point
Gina
(takes phone) She's sending a message
Meth Lab
Trailer park
Anything with interesting antenna arrays
There's three between Miami International and the glades
'm gonna try for her, but this is triage
Protect the maximum number of lives
You need to know that
Crockett knows the Sophie's choice Castillo may have to make
And it may cost Gina
Crockett glances at Tubbs
Crockett pushes the throttles forward
-  :    + jam over the swells into Government Channel,   this time, even though the limit is 15 knots
Barely missing sport fishing boats, slower recreational craft
: -   - over his  monitor scanning trailer parks
Nothing
Then he notes a double-wide with two satellite dishes
(
) (to Tubbs) Three possibles
: - on with Castillo
(
) eliminated one
's on the next two
Trudy and  are goin' for Gina
- slams the Scarab sideways, spewing a huge wake, driving it through a circle to slough off speed as he pulls into a dock
Crockett's Stryker does the same
Tubbs transfers into this boat with Trudy and Zito
Switek gets into the Stryker with Crockett and Isabella
As they speed up Government Channel
: - If they attack you
(finishes) it's gonna be an -shaped ambush
They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight
They will wait till they got the goods before they do the deed
: : ()   +   + ()  , ,  + , ,  ,     , ,
,  ,   , + + ()   +    -
, -  -  - (
) (radio filter) Do you have her
Trudy ' answer
She's totally focused on a clamshell video screen connected to a fiber optic as a  technician feeds it into
: , -  - :    - Where it meets the wall, a tiny hole has been drilled and we see the 4mm diameter lens connected to the flexible fiber optic poke through
The camera's on the floor where it meets the wall
, -  - And Trudy and we  in fish-eye a long-haired Nazi Low-Rider and the bulked-out Brother with the Hefty garbage-bag apron
Deeper in the trailer, her clothes torn, blindfolded, is Gina with the -4 necklace
Beyond her, the woman in the house dress and her large, retarded son
(into radio, to Castillo) Have eyes on her
She's alive
Moving in
, -  - - reacts to knock on the door
(
) Asian Star
You order Chinese
- (laughs) No, but 'm starving
Laughs, reaches for the door
Don't
Too late
Door's opened
-  - , holding the bag of Chinese for the Long-Haired
He reaches and
rips Long-Hair through the door, down the stairs, where two slam him into the ground
He struggles
baton slams twice across the back of his neck
He's out
Handcuffed, and Tubbs and Trudy are in the interior
, - Bulked-out Aryan has a handgun in one hand, detonator in the other
Eyes wide
Standoff
The Old Woman in house dress is
Her retarded Son sees Tubbs/Gina as a threat to his mother
grabs butcher knife
rushes forward during
Aryan doesn't move
The -like necklace of -4 around Gina's neck
struggles against plastic ties, to hear, to see, as
shouts, surges past bulky Aryan, heading for Tubbs
prepares for the autistic son, not seeing behind him
#3 rising from a bare mattress with an aluminum baseball bat, coming up behind Tubbs
- slips the Autistic Son, rotating his right arm around the kid's right arm, getting slashed on the back of his forearm, but grabbing the Son's wrist as the momentum propels him past Tubbs, who torques the wrist back
Screaming, Son's ruined wrist, Tubbs took the knife, and as the Aryan Brother swings the bat
: ducks the bat
It dents the faux-wood paneling
Tubbs slams the knife twice into the man's slide, doubling him up, leaving the  Brother to crawl, bleeding, with a 10-inch butcher knife through his kidney into his right lung
Tubbs' gun in his left hand has never moved off-target of the Aryan brother with the detonator in his hand the whole time until right now:  he snaps a  into the wounded Aryan Brother's head
And, that fast, Tubbs' gun is back on target
- nihilistic smile dawns there
Shoot me, she dies
Hey, fuck it, man
We can all go
(cool) That's not what will happen
(that stops him) What will happen is
(as she's aiming her Car- 15 and slowly taking up the slack on the trigger
) what will happen is,  will put a round precisely through the medula at the base of your brain, at an entry-point mid-distance between your upper lip and the bottom of your nose, and you will be dead from the neck down
Your finger won't be able to twitch
Do you believe that
Fuck
That's all he gets out
Trudy does exactly that
Aryan Brother falls like a felled tree
Tubbs retrieves the detonator
Trudy unties Gina
Carefully, Tubbs pulls the sensitive remote detonator from his hands
puts his coat over Gina
As she half leaves, turns to the fallen
Motherfucker
She kicks him in the head
Tubbs grabs her to pull her off
He's dead
(on radio, to Castillo) got Gina
She's okay
: -  - hears
(into loud hailer) Go
-   #2 with a
50 caliber Burrows is hit about 15 times from firing from across the bridge on a down angle towards him
helicopters suddenly  up the sky
: - observing from a block south on the bridge sees the police assault, raises night-vision binoculars
' :     + behind structures on the jetty
Crockett fires with the - pushes "send" on his satellite phone
: ,   - The technicians are eating in the next room
We hear the recording
(in Spanish) Isabella
The gringos are police
She's their informant
: - Go
+  - ' pulls out, racing to get away from the firefight
But freezes it
heavy rounds slam into the engine, crack the block, stream sprays, it seizes up
Suburban crashes into a car at the curb
Yero bails out
-  - half out of his seat, a Galil in full auto on his shoulder, hovering above Yero and the Suburban
(loud hailer) Freeze
You're under arrest
Down on your knees
Put your hands on your head
: does none of that
Enraged, he pulls up a 9mm +  to fire up at the helicopter aiming down at
The assault rifle unloads in three-shot bursts
The pavement, the car and Yero are cratered by the 7
62mm rounds
Yero goes down
Dead
- : lands
Tubbs bails, grabbing his duffle bag and the rifle and turns down the street towards the firefight and Crockett
: - holding Isabella down,  past a Toyota
It's turned into a sieve
He tells Isabella to stay behind the engine block
Then he  the ambush
is shot in the calf, spins, goes down, gets up, limps to cover, keeps firing
- taking and returning  from Crockett and Zito and from his left flank from the  team on the bridge
knows every moment more he's here, more  assets are coming in
He wants to finish it faster
+ : bails off the freighter onto the dock
- with a full auto  is with him
They move from cover to cover, their heavy Kevlar body armor absorbing rounds
And they attack Crockett and Zito, who are outgunned
+ run for cover, fire three-shot bursts, run and cover
But
runs from cover into the clear with her handgun firing at the crazy whites, furious at the betrayal by Yero
She's shouting in Spanish
It's insane
sees Isabella, moves
sees Isabella, swings his assault rifle onto her as
Isabella
and sees Coleman because he's turned he's exposed his legs and Crockett slows and blows Coleman's legs out from under him
Coleman's on the ground, scrambling for his rifle to kill Isabella
Dark-Haired  is pulling the trigger on Crockett when
fires the M40 grenade launcher loaded with shot
Dark-Haired is nearly cut in half
+ at the prone Coleman
Coleman's dead
:    - continues as other  battle Miami
Meanwhile
goes to Isabella, pulls her into the shadows away from dockside, keeping her low, seemingly away from the police
, how will they get out of here
+ : approaches from the left
Tubbs and Crockett's eyes connect
: sees his partner with this woman
The frozen moment
Isabella doesn't understand the changed expression on Tubbs' face
We do
50 yards away
All meaning is transmitted
And Tubbs nods
and the nod means:  "get her out of here
" As Tubbs speaks into his radio, his right arm belted where it was slashed, heading towards the diminished firefight, now under  control, as
through the weeds and scrap, away from the firefight, away from the freighters,
Beyond them, we hear the gunfight diminishing
: -  + enter from the rubble-filled industrial lot
Cars have stopped, their occupants seeking cover behind them
Crockett hesitates not at all
He grabs a late '80's Mercedes left with its door open
Its owner, a middle-aged man at the curb, starts to object
Crockett raises his gun
Owner demurs
Crockett steals away in it down the street into the night, its lights off
: -  + breathing
She's hyperventilating
He steadies her
Then, Crockett sees something and she does, too
' : appears around the corner
Rearview mirror:  flashing lights on his tail
Nowhere to go
Crockett stops
thinks this is it
She's dead
, shotguns and assault rifles, approach
- Touch the windshield with your hands
Let 'em see your hands are empty
Steady
(approaching) Don't move
Don't move
Keep your hands where  can see them
They do
Then the  Sergeant stops
(cont'd) Sonny
Yeah
Hey, Robert
The police relax, turn away
Are you okay
Yeah
Going to Miami General
Check out Gina
Everybody's okay
Everybody's fine
Crockett nods and drives through the roadblock
He drives away into the night
: - does not look at Isabella
He shoots up the on-ramp onto -95
His eyes at the moment are world-weary and street- wise
It's all out
All is in the open
Finally, he looks over his right shoulder at her
stares at him
Incredulous
For the first time she realizes he's the police and has been undercover
And now she hits him
- swerves across three lanes, up on two wheels, almost rolls, cuts off a semi, which barely recovers, and spins out onto the shoulder, off the shoulder, down into the gravel
It comes to a stop and
- tries to bring her
380 around
Crockett overpowers her
Takes the gun
She slams him in the face with a closed fist
He grabs her wrists, spins her around, pushes her at the door, handcuffs her behind her back
He floors the Mercedes
It spins through 270 degrees, scattering gravel and dust, and pulls back onto the freeway, driving out of the city, away from Miami, out, into the night
: - She won't look at him
She won't reply
She's frozen, immobile, withdrawn deep, darkly into herself
Isabella
No reply
Isabella wonders where he's taking her, what will happen to her, but she won't ask
: -    - Nothing
The cypress are silhouettes against a lighter mauve sky
Engine sound
Then, the Mercedes enters and speeds down the empty two-lane blacktop
And at the end, the trees open up and there's the open ocean and, beyond that, the Florida Keys
We see a house
: - : Door opens
Crockett leads Isabella in
He uncuffs her
She rips away from his hand holding her arm
She walks to the other end of the large room with the picture windows overlooking the water and the jetty and a boat tied up there
Low furniture
Sparse, it was built in the '60's
She walks to a restroom, slams the door
Offscreen, a faucet runs
Suddenly, the door opens
She comes out, glaring, shouting
What are you going to do with me
Are you taking me to jail
You think  will turn into your informant, is that it
No
: ,   - +   - in stencilled body armor storm in through doors and windows
It is a police action, an assault
: It's as if no one had ever lived there
few papers flutter in the breeze from the light wind entering through the open doorways
White papers against white marble against white walls
profound statement of nobody is home
Wherever Montoya is, he is not here
: -  - staring out the window at the narrow jetty
Isabella sits, distantly, alone at the end
: Crockett joins her
She's withdrawn into herself
No part of it wasn't real
know
(quietly) And now
It still is
'm so in this, don't know which way is up
All know is  won't let anything bad happen to you
(beat) Just like  said
(beat) And  know we can't ever see each other again
And we never will
Isabella sits there for a moment
She glances at him, looks away
Then
You said time is luck
Meaning, who can tell
There may be a time for them somewhere else
Luck ran out
(beat) This was too good to last
He touches her hand
And she leans all her weight against his arm
: ,  -  - asleep
The moonlight is silver tinged with green
Someone else had been in the bed with him, but he is there alone, now
Crockett wakes up
He looks around
She was there and now she's gone
He gets out of the bed and looks out to the ocean and the jetty
The boat's gone
She's gone
Sonny Crockett looks out the window
