He is waiting
Another silhouetted  appears and approaches the first
They size each other up as best they can
MacLeod
The second nods
The first without hesitation raises a sword, the intended thrust interrupted by his own death as the second with a flash of metal severs the agressor's head

-                                               2 15th century Scottish home
haggard , her small  clinging to a tattered apron, stands hunched over a glowing hearth
Her veined hands drag a wooden spoon around and around through a soot-covered pot of grey soup
From an adjoining room  , a young man dressed up in his best traditional Celtic tartan, enters
My, but are you the picture
(surveying himself) It's a bit tight
His  enters with a pail of milk
Ah, Conor, how you look a man
Have you time for some- thing to eat
No, Mother
They'll be here shortly
Conor's father looks him over with pride
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and  to fight for the Duke
Must he go
Aye
It is his duty
All of ours
But Ian, he's still but a boy
He's a MacLeod
'll be fine Mother

-                                               3 Several  gallop up through the early morning fog to the cottage door
Conor's father steps out to meet them
4
-                                             4 massive  sits astride his horse, moorish dew cling- ing to his helmet and breastplate
hikes up the heather-carpeted slope to him
They march
Is the boy among them
Aye
5
-                                                 5 The second kneels to examine the headless body of the first
With a  a window, high on the alley wall, closes
6
-                                      6 The  is leading a brigade of  out onto the plain
Mounted  ride back and forth inspecting the line
The low fog makes it impossible to see beyond a few yards
There is an erie, smothering silence
#1 Is a bad day for this
#2 The Duke has been compro- mised
He will have his due
#1 By day's end he will have our heads
#2 We ride against the Suther- lands
That is all that matters
#1 This makes no sense to me
And a friend are marching through the moist heather
The fog is bad
We cannot even see the sides of our own ranks
Conor's nervousness is showing
Is this your first
Aye
is heard on the plain
It's begun
7
-                                             7 The Knight, above the fog, hears the battle commence below
He spurs his horse and starts down into the mist
8
-                                               8 The two opposing clans are now one confused mass of tartan and clashing swords
The air is charged with  of ex- citement, agony, and the  of bag pipes
The fog has made each man's battle his own, each isolated with his opponent
Rides calmly through the fracas
He strikes and kills those that assault him, but appears disinterested in battle
He is looking
Is standing above the twitching body of his friend
Alone and confused, Conor has become seperated from the clan
He stumbles through the fog, seeking help
Suddenly he is alone with the Knight
The face of iron locks its gaze onto the boy
His fear turned to panic, Conor turns and flees
The Knight, his resolve steeled in a raised sword, kicks his horse into persuit
Conor is easily overtaken and on his first pass the Knight brings his blade down hard into Conor's shoulder, slicing open most of the boy's back and knocking him face-first into the heather
As Conor watches his own blood spew forth, he rolls over in time to see the Knight dismount and start for him
Leans down next to Conor, his metal face nearly against the boy's
His voice slithers out of the iron in almost a whisper
There can be but one
Charges out of the fog and attacks the Knight, who cuts him nearly in half
wanders in and meets the same fate
The battle is shifting to where they are
Not finished yet with Conor, the Knight is finding himself forced into retreat from an ever increasing number of assail- ants
Sees his men being hacked apart trying to stop the now-mounted Knight
#1 Leave him
The clansmen obey
With the slap of an armored gauntlet against his steed, the Knight disappears into the fog
The Vassal surveys the carnage before him
His eyes fall a moment on the moaning, gurgling Conor
The Vassal turns and leaves the boy for dead

-                                                 9 patrol car pauses at the mouth of the alley
The figure considers his situation, then quickly shoves his sword into a near-by drain
He straightens up and waits
Steps out of his unit and cautiously walks forward
His switches on the patrol car's side lamps, bathing the alley in a harsh glare
For the first time we can see his face
, clad in a well-cut business suit, looks exactly like Conor
The police officer, upon seeing the body, grabs instinctively for his pistol
He yells to his partner now coming into the alley
#1 Kevin
Get is a backup
was merely walking by when- #1 Don't move
The officer has his pistol out and leveled
His partner runs up, shotgun in hand
#2 They're on their way
His voice cuts short as the blood flows against his shoe
#2 Christ
10
-                                               10 Conor lies moaning on a cot
Makeshift bandages wrap his body, stained and pasted by thick, dried blood
The family surrounds their dying son
is delivering the last rites
Libera Domine Animan servi tui sicut libertasi David de manu regis Saul
His sobbing mother holds a compress to Conor's forehead
In mamus tuas domine commendo spiritum meum
11
-                                               11 Vassal rides up to the hutch, dismounts, and approaches a standing in the open doorway
#1 Has the boy died
He is having the last rites now
It should be over by morning
#1 Never seen anybody cut as bad live so long
He should have died on the field
Tonight or tomorrow, it's all the same
The Vassal peers inside at the priest administering the sacraments
Auditorium nostrum in nomine domini
#1 This has been a dark day
Requiescant in pace
12
-                                               12 There is a bustle of activity
Setting up barricades, uni- formed  are trying to keep   and curious at a distance
Lean, fortyish, and comfortable with the gore in front of him, is inspecting the corpse with a
(studying body) Real clean
No sawing action at all
Whatever it was did it in one swipe
(looks up at Moran) Like the other one
Moran gestures to a sword, wrapped in plastic, lying nearby
What about that
Hasn't any blood on it
(looking around) About the only thing that doesn't
'll give it a closer look when  get back
Pretty but not beautiful, thirtyish, she exudes a sort of insolent intelligence
An  sees her duck under a police barricade
#3 Come on Brenna, you know better than that
'm invited
She walks to where the medical examiner is organizing his equipment
(greeting) Mr
Levine
The examiner turns and smiles
Hope this isn't past your bedtime
Brenna looks to the now-sheeted corpse, blood flowing from where the head should be
Doesn't have a head, does he
This one came unassembled
Lt
Moran is standing near
(no warmth) Just show her what she came for, Tom
(stands, taps Brenna's arm) Come on, this is more your line of work
Brenna and the examiner walk the few yards from the corpse to the sword
How's your uncle
hardly ever see him anymore
Fine
The examiner stops and gestures to the weapon clothed in forensic plastic
There you go
Brenna's expression changes to interest as she kneels down beside it
Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why called you
(looks up in Moran's direction) Didn't think it was my buddy over there
Figured you knew more about swords than  did
Claymore
Huh
Scottish claymore
Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore
You're the expert
(runs hand along hilt, slightly confused) It's in good condition
Is being put in the rear of a patrol car
Brenna studies his face in the half-gloom
There's something different about him
steadiness
13
13 Richard Taupin is seated at a graffitti scrawled table in a room otherwise bare of furnishings
He seems unphased by his surroundings
The door opens and Moran enters with bag and notebook
He picks up Taupin's wallet on the table top and checks the driver's license
This your present address
Yes
Mr
- (looks at license) Taupin, what were you doing in that alley
was walking by when heard a shout
Your men came right after
Did you know the victim
No
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory
It doesn't
He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week
Taupin's face is stoic and controlled
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way
He'd also been in the country less than a week
(beat) What is your citizenship
American
Moran paces to a corner of the room
Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night
What are you getting at
Let's just say that in my years with this department 've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street
Moran places both hands on the table and leans across it
What were _you_ looking for
That's none of your business
You're wrong
Moran reaches into a bag on the table and removes a large broad sword; old, but in mint condition
Do you know what this is
presume it's a sword
claymore to be exact
You wouldn't know anything about it would you
Your murder weapon
It was covered with Mr
Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood
mystery
For the moment
Moran turns the sword over in his hand then sets it down
He rises and opens the door
All right Mr
Taupin, we'll be in touch
Taupin passes through the doorway without comment

His eyes search out the darkness

Conor's mother, scrubbing clothes in a bucket, smiles in recognition
Ah Steven, it is good to see you
only just heard of Conor
came up from Catroch as soon as  could
You're a kind man to be sure
thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family
Steven, Conor didn't die
But  had heard his wounds were mortal
They were Steven, they were
It's been a miracle it has
He lasted right through and healed
No one in the village has ever seen anything like it
Ever

-                                                16 Perched on a heather-carpeted rise above the village a young woman, , sits contemplating the intricaces of a daffodil
Balancing on a shepard's staff, Conor limps over and puts his lips to her ear
You're pretty today
Mara is silent
Distant
'm your future husband, remember
have no future husband
don't understand
Not a week ago your father gave us his blessing
This is difficult for her
Tears well in her eyes
My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands
What are you saying
'm standing here as real as you
You cannot be real, Conor
You had the last rites
No man has been cut half as bad and lived
But  did live
Live
In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel
So why the crazy talk
It's a miracle it is
Saint Andrew has smiled on me
On us
Some think not
Who
There's rumor in the village
Some call it magic
That's mad
Surely you don't take their word
don't know, Conor
It's not natural
Maybe something has touched you
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins
Me father has taken back my hand
He puts a hand to her cheek
Ah, Lassie
She steps back
Please not be touching me, Conor
'll not take that kind of talk from you
From those others below, maybe
But not from you
Leave me alone, Conor
Please
You're not talking sense, Mara
Anger tumbles into exasperation
'm sorry
He steps for her
She moves away
Conor's face hardens with resentment
If you send me away now, Mara, 'll not come looking for you
(crying) Do what you must
Resigned, Conor turns and limps away

Unusual
Clocks, tables, chests
Small and personal
Richard Taupin enters and sheds his overcoat
Mrs
Thompson agreed to settle for fifteen, Melvin's wants to make a pick-up at three o'clock, the coffee machine's broken, and there's a Miss Cartwright from the Smithsonian in your office
Taupin is hardly in the mood

'                                             18 Brenna Cartwright stands in Taupin's cluttered surroundings admiring a bagpipe set neatly on a shelf
Do you play
Yes
Very traditional
Taupin sits down and begins sorting through a stack of papers on his desk
(impatient) Miss Cartwright, what is it  can do for you
'd like to ask you about the claymore
It's not mine
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years
Miss Cartwright, unless you have come here to sell the sword, there's very little  can help you with
Now if you will excuse me,  have a great deal of work to do
Brenna has taken a carving from the shelf
Byzantine
Basil the
Charming guy, Basil
Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but- -All but one out of a hundred, know
All left to be led like donkeys back home
Now if you will please- Brenna suddenly tosses the carving at him
Taupin snatches it out of the air with lightning precision
Good reflexes
Good day, Miss Cartwright
19
19 lonely, ancient room full of equal parts dust and oaken study tables
The department  sits at his desk surrounded by a handful of his staff  - Brenna included
faded, stern portrait of some forgotten curator presides over propped up feet, cold coffee, and half eaten sack lunches
don't believe him
Why
He's too cool
Too sharp think he's got something to do with it
#1 Oh, has your penetrating research on 9th Century Lithuanian dildos suddenly made you an expert on the criminal mentality
Screw off, Larry
The men,
They delight in baiting her
Researcher #2 opens a Budweiser and pours the beer into a medieval mug he's borrowed from the collection
#2 The cops bought it
They let him go
What could they hold him for think they're just waiting for something concrete before they haul him in for real
We should look into it
He had to have gotten that sword from somewhere
Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, 'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here
've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved
It's just a hunk of peasant iron
Why would he be carrying it around in an alley
#1 Here we go
Everytime there's a murder in town we have to put up with junior
#2 Must be genetic
Someone should check him out
Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over
He has one, he might have two
You see that desk
_Your_ desk
You see the crap piled up on it
Give it a rest Ned, huh
#2 Might be interesting to see what his family connections are
That's a hell of a piece to be just chuck- ing around in an alley
(sighs) swear to God Brenna, between you and Thompson's novels 'm going to get a bloody ulcer
Researcher #2 lifts the mug of beer to his mouth
: 20
20 An empty mug is set on the counter of a medieval drinking establishment
, their faces and clothes smudged with a day's work in the fields, relax and enjoy the company of their fellow
No longer requiring the use of a cane, Conor enters
(to owner) Evening, Douglas
Conor
The tavern goes silent
Wary
The attention is on Conor
Ale suits me
The owner unenthusiastically fills Conor a mug
Conor takes it and walks to where four other  sit
#1 We rather you not be sitting with us, Conor
Conor looks to the next table
#2 We be drinking alone as well
The entire tavern spells the same sentiments
What's wrong with you all
Silence
Angered, Conor approaches the second man
As he looms above his chair the man in genuine fear pulls out a cross and thrusts it forward
#2 Requiem acer'nam donaei- What are you doing man
#2 -Et lux perpetua- You'll not be bringing the church into this
#2 -Luceat ei- The weird display frightens Conor
Be quiet
#2 -Auditorium nostrum- Stop
#2 -In nomine sanctus esperitu- Stop
Conor  his mug against the wall
His nerves shattered, he rushes out
21
21 Conor packs a satchel with his few clothes and belongings
He walks to the doorway where his mother and father wait
His mother, tears on her cheek, hugs him tightly
Please take care of yourself
Aye
Conor turns to his father
wish there was some other way
They clasp hands
Goodbye, Conor
Goodbye
Without looking back he passes through the doorway and down the empty path, his figure quickly fading in the moorish fog

22 The  business-as-usual confusion at the Washington
processing center
Amongst the dinge of  phones and  typewriters, a uniformed  enters something into a computer terminal
Brenna sits perched on a desk nearby
This is against the rules
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of- -Okay okay
You owe me
Besides, 'm cute
The computer returns a reply onto a printer
(tears off sheet) Taupin, Richard Marshall
Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland
Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it
Anything in Maryland is close
23
-                                     23 Taupin steps out of a Metro station and walks the few blocks to his brick townhouse
Climbing the front stairs, he fishes his keys out of a coat pocket
About to insert the key he stops, sensing something
Backing down the steps, Taupin slips around to the rear of the building
24
24 Like a spider Taupin pries open a window and slips silently inside
The home is dark and still
Taupin creeps down the hallway and peers into the entryway
There a , dressed in a tuxedo jacket and nearly imperceptible in the dim light, is crouched at the front door
He is holding a sword
Taupin removes a knife from his pocket and  the intruder
The two  fiercely
Taupin pins the intruder against the carpet and shoves his knife firmly against the man's throat
Where is he
Bulging eyes stare at him
Where
don't know
What name is he using
Taupin presses the blade
trickle of blood rolls down the throat
Smith
Carl Smith
How many came
The last four
And the Bulgarian
He got him
(hoarse chuckle) He always does
Eventually
He knows 'm here
How
None of this would be happening if you hadn't run
The knife is pressed deeper
_Answer_ me
(gasping) We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York
Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill

Willis Kidell

'                                           29 Dr
Kidell stands at his bookcase leafing through a binder
1945, that strains the memory
(after a fashion) Here we are, Richard Taupin
He carries the binder to the table where Brenna sits
Would you like more tea
No thank you, 'm fine
Kidell sips his own and looks over the binder page
He was unsual
Why
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then
Most all the babies  delivered were from local families
Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came did it right here at the house
Then you didn't know Richard later on
No
've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies
Don't know about any of that
Suppose nobody does
don't follow you
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance
Hopelessly premature
He died a few days after he was born
The boy _died_
Mother too
Sad case it was
The young lady just couldn't make it through labor
Never even saw her son
Dr
Kidell removes from the binder a tattered newspaper clipping
My brother worked for the town paper at the time
He took this picture of the funeral
Something in the clipping sparks Brenna's interest
Have you spoken to anyone else about this
There was this one fella
Asked a lot of questions
was out of town but  heard he spent near a full day in the records office
Would you remember his name
(thinks) Carl Smith

Just tell us when you see the one
Several rows back in the dark sits Brenna's  , the district attorney, and another man, his
Forget it
'm just curious
You're never "just curious"
(to assistant) You've met my neice, Brenna
Hi Brenna
(to line-up) Number 5, lift your coat up more
Aren't you getting a little old for this
You flunked out of law school
(rolls her eyes) Now there's a new topic
Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle
Brenna puts on her best little-girl angelic smile, a smile her uncle can never refuse
(sighs) Forgers do it all the time
They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit
Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it
Thanks
Call your mother
You never call her
(to old lady) Well
don't know
'd have to see his thing

'  -                                    31 swath of moonlight shines in across a carafe-turned-vase, a New England college diploma, and a police uniform hanging from the bedpost where Brenna lies with another man,
can't figure out why he's doing it
He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967
And the guys rich
You should see the stuff he has in that shop
Maybe he's hiding from something
Some guy named Smith was asking about him in Church Hill
passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank
So he isn't a cop
District anyway
Dennis gets out of bed and begins putting on his uniform
Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife
Dr
Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral
The father looked just like Richard
Even had a mark on his cheek
How old is Richard
says 41, but he barely looks 30
Find the father
That should clear things up
He buttons his shirt
Something occurs to him
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night
Yeah
He'd want to know about all this
Mr
Congeniality
Let him find his own clues
There's a journal article in this somewhere
(shakes head) Uncle Joey's little girl
Can't get the taste out of her mouth
Dennis puts on his police cap
Well, the cream of society awaits
(cocks hat to one side) If you're ever in the neighborhood
Sure

They found it
The officer leads him down to the river where a headless wearing a tuxedo jacket is being put into a plastic bag
It was about fifty yards down- stream from the head

Across the damp grass a lone horse, heaving clouds of warm breath, leaps gracefully over a hurdle
Driving the steed hard through the course, Taupin pulls firm on the reins, bringing horse and rider to a shuddering stop where Detective Moran waits
There's been another murder
Taupin lifts his eyes to the suburban treeline
My condolences
Where were you Tuesday night
Home
neighbor saw your car leave
He's mistaken
Taupin climbs down from his horse
Moran moves close
Look,  don't know what the hell you're up to, but  think 've got a pretty good idea
Do you
All  need is time
've got all the time in the world
(looks at watch) Except right now
If you will excuse me, Lieutenant
In no hurry, Taupin leads his horse away
34
34 Brenna sits surrounded by books of old English law, colorful family banner plates, and a medieval caltrap sitting on her desk corner
Boring quickly, she shuts the book and sighs
From another folder she pulls out a computer sheet
The police sheet has Taupin's name and motor vehicle record
Below are listed four  , their hometowns and driving records
Richard Taupin's first driver permit was in 1967
Brenna looks down the list to a   of Felton, Delaware, who stopped filling for driver permits in 1967, the year Richard started

-                                           35 Dropping a couple of quarters into a vending machine, Brenna removes and opens up a map of the State of Delaware

-                                             36 Brenna steps out of her car at a small town cemetary
Holding a slip of paper, she weaves her way through the shade covered tombs of revolutionary heroes and their descendants
On a small rise fresh dirt lies in careless piles around an open grave
Richard Taupin stands at the mouth of the pit
coffin has been brutally pulled from the dirt and lies open and propped diagonally beside a marker that reads: " "
The casket is empty
Someone beat you
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright
Grave robbers
Probably
Who
People like that rarely leave business cards
Does Carl Smith
flash of interest, quickly suppressed
don't know what you're talking about
think you do
Better yet,  don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place
And  think Mr
Smith, whoever he is, now knows that
You have an active imagination
've been to Church Hill
Miss Cartwright, you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you
strongly suggest you return to Washington and stay out of small town cemetaries
He starts for the gate
could find him
Taupin stops
have friends
doubt that
(beat) Good day, Miss Cartwright
He walks on
After only a few paces Taupin suddenly shudders to an abrupt stop
What's wrong
He holds up an open palm to silence her
Your help may be unneccessary
The air is still
Taupin's face is expressionless
He listens intently
Sensing
An unseen voice rides seemingly on the wind
(o
s
) Good afternoon, "Mr
Taupin"
Taupin whirls around to see a large man standing with broad sword in hand
We have never seen the knight out of his armor before, but this man certainly seems to fit the bill
Wearing Levis and leather jacket in contrast to Taupin's expensive business suit, he speaks with icy evenness from a face of stone
Taupin, naked without his own sword, is trapped against a marble wall
Long time
Not so long
The Knight is closing in on him, sword gripped in both hands
You've been here from the start
My quarry grows clever with age
And the others, incompetent
The Knight throws Brenna a glance
Friend of yours
Of sorts
do hope she enjoys a good show
The Knight leans his whole body into a two-fisted swing, clanging out a chunk of marble as Taupin ducks
second swipe also imbeds itself in stone
So now it ends
thrust cuts only air
Generation upon generation
Tens of thousands of miles
Taupin leaps behind a tree
The Knight cuts it nearly in half
You're the last, MacLeod
Romirez, Lacroux, Neuvich, those fools that followed me, their heads all line my shelf
All but yours
Taupin drops to the ground in a shoulder roll to avoid a swipe
Can you feel it, MacLeod
Can you _feel_ it
Taupin grabs a tree branch and raps the Knight on the knee, knocking him over
The Knight quickly rights himself and cuts the branch from Taupin
There can be but one
He raises his blade
An elderly , shotgun cradled in his arms, stands in the clearing
Hey
What's going on here
The Knight pauses a split second then with decision launches his sword spear-style firmly into the watchman's chest
Taupin pushes past him to Brenna
Run
Brenna is frozen in shock
Taupin shoves her roughly toward the gate
Run
The Knight retrieves his sword from the watchman's body and lumbers after them
Taupin and Brenna bolt from the cemetary and into the surround- ing residential area

-                                    37 Taupin leads an exhausted Brenna in a gallop down the side- walk
They have apparently lost the Knight
Taupin pauses at a corner
He sees a church across the street
38
38 Brenna enters and collapses into a pew, her labored breathing echoing off the high ceiling
Taupin walks the length of an aisle to see that they are alone
Satisfied, he leans against a banister and considers his sit- uation
Trying to recover her wind, Brenna has her eyes closed and head against the back of the pew
Jesus Christ
You'll be safe here
He won't kill in a church
Why not
(distracted) Tradition
What the hell is going on
Taupin stares out the window, stained glass shining orange on his face
He looks at Brenna briefly, then passes through the Church's doorway without a word

Pulling it out with iron tongs, Conor lays it on a counter and pounds it even with a mallet
Sweaty and streaked with dirt, he tosses the mallet aside and walks out into the late afternoon sunshine

-                                         40 Conor leans over a water barrel and dunks his head and arms, cleaning off a day's worth of sweat and grime
Stirring up dust with his travelling boots, this Spanish acc- ented man stops at Conor's shop
He wears a large broad sword strapped to his waist
Afternoon
Your name is Conor
Aye
(bows slightly) Juan Cid Romirez
Chief surveyor and alchemist
(notices accent) You're not from these parts
am from Spain
And would like a moment of your time
41
'                                                41 Romirez is seated at a table
His back to the Spaniard, Conor is preparing some food
haven't much to offer, Mr
Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here
Please go to no trouble
Romirez is looking at the faint, pale hint of a scar that runs from Conor's shoulder blade to his waist
Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing  cannot even re- member
Your marks would suggest great injury
was nearly killed
But you lived
Conor looks up from his work in pained memory
did at that
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no
Aye
should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation
And a solution
Something isn't right
Conor turns and faces him
was driven out
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew
How can you know this
(tone lightens) First food, no
good meal makes conversation so much easier
Stunned with the implications of what Romirez has said, like a robot Conor serves the meal
His eyes never leave Romirez, who digs hungrily into the food
Hmm, que rico
What is it you call this
Pheasant
You Scots have a way with game
It still has life in it
Spirit
Back home the food is so
domestic
Why are you here
was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal
You're a long way from Inverness
In my travels  heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth
You know me home
Me name
It was time for our paths to cross
Romirez pulls back the sleeve on his cloak
You see this
He traces some discoloration on his arm
When  was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me
All thought  would die or be maimed for life
But  healed quickly
And like you  paid the price for being different
You are the same
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you
Yes
Always
Does it change with me in the room
It is less
You feel you know me
don't know why
We are brothers
42
- Romirez and Conor walk alone amongst torch-lit hutches
He told me there could be only one
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game
(Conor confused) You and  Conor, we are different from all others around us
You know this, you can feel it
We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure, (looks away) permanently
don't understand
You are still so very young
'm twenty-two
(shakes head) Not even a single lifetime
Romirez chooses his words very carefully
Conor, you and , we cannot be killed
What
We are immortal
Stunned, Conor backs away from Romirez
No, that can't be
Romirez grasps Conor's shoulder
It is as you are
(pushes away) No
This is all too much for Conor
Listen to me
Hear the words
This is madness
It is the truth
No
Romirez suddenly draws his sword and thrusts it into Conor's heart
The boy's mouth drops open in shocked terror as his eyes roll up into his head
shudder, then Conor slides off the blade and crashes to the ground

(singing) Happy birthday to you, happy birth- day to you, happy birthday dear Brenna, happy birthday to you
Brenna is still upset from the last call
' Hi Brenna, it's mom
Me and your neices just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday
Crissy made a real cute card for you, be sure to call her
Will you be home for Easter

Bandaged about the chest, Conor asleep on his cot
Suddenly he sits up
Sweating
He looks about the room in confusion as Romirez enters with a plate of food
Three days you've laid there
It's time you ate
(dazed) This can't be
You are not dead, boy
Accept it
This is monstrous
'll burn in hell for all eternity
You'd have to die first
(extends forkful of food) Aqui
Conor starts
What is to become of me
Am  to wander the Earth forever like a ghost
You will live
Survive
Then they were right
am evil
This is God's punishment
You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod
Oh my God
Oh my God 'm lost

'  -                                       46 Two days later
Nearly healed, Conor and Romirez stand near a quietly moving stream
Why does he want to kill me
You recall how  spoke of the push you feel and how  make it less
Aye
It is always less with my living
Far or near
But if  were to die the push would become stronger than ever before
There is power in this
And as long as you and live, The Knight can never have it all
But we cannot be killed
There is an imperfection
For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead
You can survive anything but steel against your threat
Then it is over
The end
How can  stop such a man
Hide
Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn
You must learn to defend yourself
In this  can help
Why
We are brothers
And you are a defense- (beat) -of sorts

, leads Taupin up the drive of a rural farmhouse somewhere in the hinterland of Pennsylvania
When your father died  saw to it that the grounds were kept up
The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs
Oh yes, more than enough
48
48 Furniture clad in white sheets
Dust everywhere
Most of the furniture was put into protective storage
'll have some boys come up and clean the place out for you
Taupin drags a finger across a dusty window pane
(fascinated) You're one of William's kids, huh
His only kid
Sure take after him
Never seen a father and son look more alike
We were very close
The resemblance is amazing
When may  expect the cleaners
'll send them right up

Brenna sits alone
Whatever nervousness she brought through the door with her has been turned into a comfortable cynicism by the three empty glasses in front of her
With something less than perfect coordination, sits down beside her
That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful
There was a Count
Count Dusan
He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it
(smiles) The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me
You're very macabre
It's my birthday
Happy birthday
Thanks
Brenna drains her glass and sets it down with a sigh
Buy a birthday girl a drink

He  around suddenly to see  , Asian, standing over him
MacLeod
Taupin is anxious, poised for attack
Kahn breaks into a broad smile
Spare a chair
Kahn
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night
Sit
Kahn takes his place across the table
(unsure) How are you
Head still secure to the neck
How did you find me
How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime
Taupin looks to his own glass
Old habits die hard
(to waitress) Waitress
round of Nitzhic
(beat) Peasant drool,  know
But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence
What are you doing here
It is the gathering, my friend
The settling of old scores
Taupin tenses
And have you something to settle with me
(smiles) Not tonight
Tonight  have a drink with an old friend
It's good to see you, Kahn
The waitress sets down two glasses
Come, toast with me the past

'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on
And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do
Offered the Pope one of his whores
They

Ever since  was a kid
You were never a kid
Kahn leans on the wall of a water buffalo pen

You're insane
No, seriously
We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon
How do you do it, Kahn
How do you live so full of life for so long
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have
All else is just marking time
(beat) You're marking time
've had a few more concerns
Kahn jams his hands into his overcoat and starts down the footpath
The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth
You're wrong
You don't run as hard, MacLeod
You just don't run as hard anymore

She hears something and turns
-Nothing
breeze rustles the trees above
After only a few more paces she hears something again
Brenna abruptly turns
-Right into the face of
Brenna
The Knight reaches into his leather carrying bag
Exit a facing townhouse
The Knight removes his hand from the bag as they spill onto the sidewalk  and
Brenna moves close to the group as they walk to the corner
The Knight follows at a measured distance
At the corner the teenagers climb into a pickup and drive off
Brenna bolts into the intersection
Weaving through brakes, she disappears into a pair of lighted glass doors

56 40 well dressed , numbered cards pinned to their lapels, sit in velvetly plush surroundings
At the front of the room stands a thin moustached art
Brenna  in from outside
apoligize for the lateness of the hour, but 'm sure you will all agree the quality of this year's collection is well worth the time
The Knight  in with his leather carrying bag
Brenna slides along the draped back wall to avoid him
(holding statuette) For this fine example of medieval religious art, let us open the bid at 4,000 dollars
The Knight closes in on Brenna casually, without hurry
10,500 once, 10,500 twice
Brenna raises her arm to attract the attention of a (points at Brenna) 11,000
bid at 11,000
No, - The guard notices she has no lapel number and starts for her very officially
Being closed in on from both sides, Brenna suddenly runs across the room to a fire exit, setting off an  as she flies open the door
The Knight leaps after her, knocking over an   in the front row

'  -                                    59 Brenna  at the front door
No answer
She  harder
The unlatched door pushes open
60
60 Brenna stands in the doorway
Before her is a disaster
Furniture has been smashed like matchsticks
desk drawer's contents lie strewn in piles on the floor
Brenna enters slowly
Mr
Taupin
have to talk to you
Nothing has been left unturned or unbroken
Brenna kneels and sifts through a pile of crumpled papers
She comes across an old black and white photograph
Badly streaked and faded, it shows Taupin standing beside a farm- house
Written in the corner is "Worstick, 1928"
Brenna slips the photo into her pocket
Standing, she turns smack into Taupin
Finished
He looks past her to the destruction of his living room
It doesn't seem to surprise him
He tried to kill me last night
Where
Dupont Circle
Taupin sifts through the debris, selecting articles from it
Who is he
At the moment
Carl Smith
And you
He ignores the question
What will you do now
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright
've been at this a very long time
He called you "MacLeod"
Not your concern
left a man dead in Felton
But you don't really care, do you
That bothers you
He was innocent
He's dead
Whatever  may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now
What about me
You
'm a witness to a murder
That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list
Have you gone to the police
No
Why not
'm sure they'd love to hear your story
'd rather hear yours
(beat) You are being foolish
'm a historian, Mr
Taupin
Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face
Go home
He walks to the doorway
Why does he want to kill you
Taupin stops, his back to her
He sees me as a threat
Are you
Taupin walks out the door

-                                          61 On a clear rise above the village Romirez and Conor spar with swords covered in heavy cloth
Conor is having difficulty
Concentrate
Conor thrusts
Romirez blocks
Harder
Concentrate harder
Me arm hurts
Again
Try again
Conor strikes
Romirez easily blocks
Harder
You swing like an impotent cow
Go to hell
Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm
Ticked off, Conor leans himself into a two-fisted swing
Romirez knocks it aside, but Conor recovers faster than he, knocking Romirez flat on his back
Impotent cow
Muy Bien
Conor drops the sword and wipes the sweat from his face
Romirez pours wine from a leather bag into a goblet pulled from his belt
He offers it to Conor
Here my boy, from vineyards as sweet and smooth as a young girl's thigh
Conor accepts the cup
Romirez pulls himself to his feet
It will take less effort as you learn
It's like to kill me first
Romirez puts his arm around Conor and refills his cup
You have a gift
One you must protect
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt
The Fabric of life
The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another
(shakes head) If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr
Romirez from Spain, 'm afraid you've failed
Romirez put his arm around Conor and leads him away
Come
Enough sword play for an afternoon

-                                           62 friendly horse race
Their reflections bouncing off a clear glen, Conor and Romirez dodge moss-laiden ruts and leap fallen tree trunks
Beaming, Conor pushes through a last turn and stops to wait for Romirez, several lengths behind
(as Romirez rides up) You're no match for Scot, Mr
Romirez
We're raised as riders
Point conceeded, Mr
MacLeod
Both their eyes turn to the beauty in view
Romirez pulls a leaf from a tree and studies it closely
What is the fascinatioon
It is only a leaf
All living things pay dues, Conor
They must be respected for that
He pulls the leaf's points from the stalk, one by one
As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes
To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing
do not think  like the sound of that
It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds
But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening
For it gives you great strength
The strength of _knowledge_
The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be
feel hardly nothing
You have not been fully trained
But you will learn
And you will be good,  can feel that
You have apt- itude
This is why our friend is so concerned
But why be so concerned about me
This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie
But the cuts are not equal
Some, like you and he, have more
Much more
And you
am a small player
But if by helping you  can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something
am not ready for this
You must be
You have responsibilities
You must learn the rules
You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you
You will always know when you are in the presence of another
Beware
But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time
In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat
People will become a transitory, pathetic lot
The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent
But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all
That is how the others exist
Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last
Keep your soul sewed to the earth
Do not become one of them
Of course
You are young, inexperienced
You do not know what time can do
How it can sap all pity, all love
That is not me
With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one
Conor
approaches from across the pasture
Yes, Darin
Hate to be bothering you like this, but me mare threw a shoe
Conor looks to Romirez
Go ahead, Senor
(gestures to wine) have my friend to keep me company
'll be back when  can
Conor sets off across the pasture
64
'                                                64 Romirez enters and flops onto a cot
Settling down for a nap, he sets his sword beneath the bed and closes his eyes to the distant sound of  playing
The room is still
Romirez begins to drowse
Suddenly his eyes leap open with full alertness
His hand moves under the cot
With an  the front door is lifted from its hinges and splintered into fragments
Passing through a cloud of sawdust enters the Knight
Without pause he topples a kitchen shelf onto a supine Romirez
Romirez
What a surprise
Romirez is struggling under the debris
The Knight thrusts hard onto an exposed leg
The limb is severed
Madonna
The Knight begins casting aside the shelving
With lightning speed Romirez pulls the sword from beneath the bed and hammers it deep into the Knight's side
Bastard
He crashes back against the wall
Romirez tries to lift himself from the bed using his sword as a crutch
The Knight has regained a meager balance on his knees
Blood pours from the slice in his stomach, Romirez pushes himself across the bed, plants his sword into the floor and hobbles a few paces before collapsing
Oh, Santa Maria
The Knight crawls across the bed and drops to his knees beside Romirez
Why run
Demonio
The Knight's trembling hands raise his shaking sword high
To hell with you

'  -                                          66 Badly wounded, the Knight staggers through the shattered doorway and tumbles into the street
Pulling himself up, the Knight hobbles away

'                                                67 Conor rushes in and shudders to a stop
An entire wall is showered with blood
Conor walks slowly forward
Dazed
As he looks down something takes his attention
It is Romirez's severed head
Conor moans in anguish and drops to his knees on the blood- stained floor
His head sinks to his chest as he begins sobbing

Brenna looms above him
Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it
All  need is for you to check the name
You talked to your supervisor lately
He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight
That on top of the cops bugging him

The librarian looks her over skeptically
Corey, you _owe_ me
It's that important
Yeah
The librarian reluctantly reaches for his keys

The room is old, disorganized, and gives the impression that every fact worth knowing must be in it somewhere
Wilson know about this

Good way to lose your job
Some job
Card filing and cabinet dusting
Four years in this dump and  haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do
liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts
Too bad no one else did
It's bullshit
Everything

You always were hard to impress
The librarian pulls a binder and opens it
Who is it
Not who

'                                  71 The high backed office chair is spun away from an angry, entering Brenna
What's wrong Wilson, huh
Not enough excitement in your own desk
What the hell were you looking for in mine
The chair turns
Detective Moran, not her supervisor, leafs through her notebook
murder
You better have a warrant
That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it
've got a morgue filling up with bodies
That's my right
What do you want from me
Well, the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town
(looks at notebook) And all of a sudden the Smithsonian's ambulence chaser is an expert on missing persons
Brenna lifts the telephone receiver
'm calling an attorney
You and  should talk first
We've got nothing to say
Moran presses the post on the phone
What are you going to tell them
That you're protecting a man who's killed four people
Four
All fashionably without heads
Spare me the details
But there's more
Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware
Some locals spotted two cars with
plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin
What are you getting at, Moran
You've been a busy little beaver
Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill
(looks at notebook) Your notes are very complete
Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew
(looks up) In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder
It'll never stick
But we might just give it the 'ole college try
What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment
But then, 'm sure the flunk-out neice of the
knows all about that
You're an asshole, Moran
want Taupin
What makes you so sure he's the one
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house
There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet
think it was about then  withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year
What's all of this got to do with me
What were you doing in Felton
Research
If your pal was there never saw him
have witnesses that can put the two of you together
(knows he's bluffing) Never take up poker, Detective
Don't be stupid, lady
Your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone else's
Brenna reaches across and lifts her notebook
Why don't you wait until it comes out in paperback
Moran watches her leave
He lifts the telephone receiver
Striding out into the corridor, Brenna passes Dennis, the cop from her bedroom, leaning against the doorway
warned you
Go to hell

Pauses a moment at the intersection, then drives on

Brenna steps outside the store onto the Main Street of the very small community of Worstick
Brenna passes a small monument settled in a flower bed
It has a plaque memorializing five locals murdered in 1931

She checks it against the photo she found at Taupin's townhouse
They match

You shouldn't have come
Brenna whirls around and sees Taupin behind her
We're you followed
He looks to the road
No
No one knows you're here
No

You had to do _nothing_
You're wrong
You're a fool
Maybe
Pause
Taupin strides through the doorway
Come inside

83 Brenna and Taupin enter
heavy broad sword sits on the coffee table
Is this what you killed them with
You've been listening to rumors
Our cars were seen together in Felton
They're calling me an accessory to murder
You are
Now
Beat
They're stuck with each other
There's several bedrooms down the hall
Take your pick

84 The room is a strange decor
18th century paintings hang beside grotesque medieval carvings
Brenna's face softens with worry
What is she doing

Before him is spread out blank birth certificates, driver licenses and title deeds
His eyes lift to the corridor where Brenna is
An idea has come to him
Brenna enters
What's all that
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome
It would be best if he just disappeared
Brenna walks to the window
You did kill those men
Not all of them
When you finish, what then
go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr
Taupin
You make it all sound so simple
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property 've aquired
That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg
But that's where you come in
You want me to front for you
The less exposure  recieve around government buildings the better
You, as Mrs
Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than
Brenna is unsure
Not such a bad trade
The story of a lifetime for a few days work

The men are assembled, Major
stands beside the major
See that they are indeed ready, Dupont
() Yes General

presents the men to Dupont
Regiment ready for review, sir
Dupont walks past the sargeant to the line
(to soldier) Stand straight, you are a soldier of the King
#1 Yes sir
Dupont continues down the line
Another soldier's infantry jacket is almost hilariously mis-buttoned, one collar sticking up four inches higher than the other
Dupont with both hands rips open the soldier's coat, spraying brass buttons onto the ground
He moves on
(to soldier) Where is your bayonet
#3 Lost it sir
Where
The soldier hedges
You heard the Major
Where
#3 Whorehouse sir
Dupont's face softens in exasperation, then toughens
Your rifle
Hand it to me
The soldier obeys
Dupont inspects the firing mechanism
The flint is cracked
No spark will reach your powder
You will die tomorrow
He throws the rifle roughly back into the soldier's hands
Tomorrow you go to _battle_
And you look like children
(beat) The General has charged me with seeing that you are prepared, and prepared you will be
If necessary you stand here all night
Sargeant
The sargeant leaps to attention
Yes sir
See to it
Yes sir
Dupont turns briskly, then stops abruptly as if alerted by some- thing
He whirls around and faces the young infantrymen
His expression is quizzical as he walks the line, checking each face carefully
One  seizes his attention
The private is cautious
Your name
Mulet
It is as if Dupont knows him
The two stare at each other
Dupont turns and leaves

finishes his story
(amused) And what a sight
That old mare just kept falling over her own guts till someone finally shot her
The
All but Dupont
(beside Dupont) Complete your inspection
They're nothing but boys
It will be a slaughter tomorrow
(laughs) doubt much can change that
The enemy has five brigades waiting for us
We need more time
Won't get it
(shrugs) We are a sacrifice
diversion
Dupont pokes unenthusiastically at his plate
Eat up Dupont
It will probably be your last
(rises) Not likely
Dupont goes to the window
Dusk shines orange on his face
In the foreground the man Dupont encountered at the line-up, Mulet, is chopping firewood

-                                             91 Several hours later
Most are asleep
Mulet continues his wood splitting
From out of the dark cottage steps Dupont
() thought  gave orders the regiment was to drill
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking
What is your position
Second musketeer
understand you joined up in Bremen
You seem to understand a great deal
am a Major, Private
You would do well remembering that when addressing me
Excuse me, "sir"
thought we spoke as equals
Equals
(shrugs) If you wish to play games, Major
Mulet returns to his chore
Wait
think we understand each other
We have no understanding
Then it is time two of us did
You are very young
was once young
can help
Mulet
Help
've seen others "help"
Somehow a head always ended up on the counter
It can be different
It must be
It never changes, Major
Mulet turns to his chore
Dupont grabs his arm
We must talk
(shakes him off) Stay out of it
(angry) Don't threaten me, Private
(disgust) Who do you think  am
One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow
"Threaten you"
You and  just living will always be a threat
Forever
Look at your life, Major
Look at mine
Nothing there but threat
Threats and nothingness
It's what we live for
Mulet turns his back on Dupont
Dupont draws his cutlass
Do not turn your back on me
You are really going to force this, aren't you
Either you are with me or against me
Mulet turns slowly, axe in hand
Have  a choice
The two stare into eyes empty of emotion
Mulet's hand flinches
An attack
Dupont  quickly, slicing open both of Mulet's arms
The axe drops to the ground
Mulet seems strangely calm
You see Major
You are not so different
Dupont cuts off Mulet's head where he stands

-                                            92 Dupont drags the corpse across the meadow and dumps it into a swamp

-                                           93 It is very late
Only a few  are seated in the pews
Dupont tries to concentrate on prayer, but is distracted
(voice flashback) You see Major
You are not so different
had no choice
Dupont sighs and looks to the altar
Who am  deceiving
Certainly not me
Dupont whirls around to see the Knight, dressed as he in uniform, sitting one row behind
Dupont leaps to his feet
You needn't look so flushed, Major
You are quite safe in church
Dupont eases his breathing
State of grace and all that
Tradition
It's all we have
Dupont has backed up a few paces
All this time and still a scared little boy
Dupont sits down
Not so scared
Perhaps not
(smiles) You seem to have misplaced a private
No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck
No doubt
You surprise me
Eliminating a rival like that
Such are the actions of a man of conquest was mistaken
300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion
You're wrong
know you very well, Conor MacLeod
And  can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you
Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision
It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players
The Knight almost seems proud of Dupont
Romirez understood
Not you
Romirez is dust
The Knight looks to the altar
Finish your prayers
Finish yours
(smiles) Our common heritage
(beat) am your only real friend, you know
The only one who truly understands you
(rises) look forward to the day we meet again
And  kill you
So sure
The Knight leans forward and puts his face very near
You can't stay in church forever
The Knight moves into the aisle
Good night, Major
He exits
Conor sits in the dim church alone
Very alone

Crossing a small bridge over a smaller creek, they encounter the elderly caretaker Mr
North and his eight year old
Both with fishing poles
Morning Mr
North Same
Such a pretty day
If  live to be 90 'll never tire of mornings like this
Mind you 'm 74 now
No
Yes sir
When you get older your priorities change
It's the simple things that count
Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing
'm sure that's true
The grandson is having difficulty baiting his line
Taupin bends down beside the young fisherman
(takes worm) Here
The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest
Thanks
Taupin's show of affection surprises Brenna
Show you a trick
Taupin takes a clump of leaves from the bridge and winds them around the hook
Fish are creatures of habit
They like their food where they're used to it
At the top, hiding in old leaves
Where did you learn that
My father taught me
Your father must be smart
Yes, he was
Brenna is touched

'  -                                  96 Brenna lies on her bed thinking
She puts on a robe and walks into the living room
Taupin sits before the fireplace, its flames reflecting on his brandy glass
Brenna moves quietly to a seat beside him
(eyes on the fireplace) There was a man once
Just a simple woodcarver
But he understood
More than anyone he could see to the heart of it
(beat) It never ends
Today is the same as the first
Tomorrow will be the same as today
So much time
And all of it wasted
(beat) You love history
Yes
wish  could

-                                  98 Walking past small town stores, Brenna allows herself a moment to window shop
Is a small poster advertising a community get-together
Brenna peels it off the glass and slips it into her notebook
99
'                                          99 Brenna and Taupin go over various forms and documents
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward
Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat
It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg
Brenna is silent
Second thoughts
Pause
No
(beat) So what now
We just wait
Yes
Well, as long as we're stuck here
She hands him the poster from earlier
It's some sort of party the town is throwing
They do it each year
thought it might be a nice break from all of this
Taupin stacks the documents into a folder
Maybe it would do us both good
There's a catch
You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing

100 Taupin is going through an old trunk
My father was something of a junk collector
He comes across a long period dress and offers it to Brenna
Here, try this
suppose they're still making women the same as back then
It's beautiful
little dusty
Taupin fishes through the trunk and comes up with an old top hat
He turns it over in his hand with stoic memory

Other young  relax nearby enjoying the warm summer's twilight
Katherine's  shuffles between the couples offering lemonade, cakes, and the like
Do it again
She is thoroughly charmed by Conor
All right
Conor wraps a length of yarn about his fingers
By turning his hand over and bending his knuckles just so, the web becomes the outline of a lion

(growls) Katherine is delighted
Conor starts to remove the yarn
Katherine touches his arm
Oh please
Another one
What would you like
Something pretty
Like you
Conor cups his hands, bends his fingers, and comes up with a four leaf clover
That's wonderful
Where did you ever learn it
Far away
Kiss me
Conor shoots a glance for the mother, then kisses Katherine softly

) You'll be leaving the girl alone
stands a few yards from the stairs
David
Do you have cause to bothering us
That's my girl
David, we've already spoken of this
He's not what he pretends to be
Conor climbs to his feet
You best leave, son
You think you're so high and mighty, coming into town and taking a man's woman
Well know about you
know about the things you do
(moving closer) said you best leave
You'd like that, wouldn't you
(to Katherine) Ask him about his friends
The ones he meets in the town square
Ask him about the blade he keeps beneath his bed
Conor grabs the youth's collar and pulls him close
(like ice) Leave
While you still can
The youth pushes away from the grasp
You don't frighten me
should
The young man throws a fist at Conor
It is easily blocked
Conor returns with a savage blow to the chest that knocks the young man gasping onto the ground
Katherine runs up behind and grabs Conor's outstretched arm
No
Leave him
Please don't hurt him
Please
painfully, the youth climbs to his feet and staggers away
He's not what you think
He turns and runs down the road
He's not what you think
Katherine turns to Conor, his face still locked in ice
don't care who you are or where you come from
She hugs him tightly
love you
Conor's face softens as he brings up an arm to hold her

Your father died some years ago
This is your first visit
The tone is snide
Of sorts

Butler
She turns in surprise at his knowing her name, then walks on
What was all that about
Sorry Mr
Taupin
That's not meant for you
Just some didn't take much to your father
Why
My father was never one for social whirls
Kept to himself for sure
Then with all that business in '31
What business
Family down the road from the Taupin place was murdered
All cut up they were
Horrible
Two strangers were also found with the bodies
No one ever accused William, but with his reputation as a loner and the rumors about him and some of the wives in town, folks just never forgot
Most were relieved when they heard he'd died
Sorry Mr
Taupin
Nothing to be sorry about
Just your pappy scared some

No

It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives
factor of age
hope  never get that old
You won't
Brenna pulls away
must be insane
Leaving work, ditching cops
All to follow a murderer
very old murderer, but a murderer just the same
Why are you here
've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article 'm going to write
But it's not
(looks at him squarely) It's you
see
'm not even sure why
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses
can't stand it
But you're different
It's in your hands

You are a very perceptive young woman

Brenna steps uneasily into the darkness
Taupin follows and switches on the light

The room is massive, a cross between a museum and an old attic
Suits of armor, Italian statuettes, Czech ironworks, Persian fetishes and a thousand other oddities from a hundred eras crowd the shelving and floor space
The room has the look of ownership, as if civilization had taken the time to keep a scrapbook
My God
The sight is overwhelming

That's why Smith called you MacLeod
Yes
He knows about you
He is older than
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction
Sometimes  think it's just for something to do
conquest to be the last
Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away
Some- thing to replace the love that can never work
That's insane
Perhaps
There is something more
An inheritance
Of bodies
didn't kill the watchman
You killed those other two
Not the same
What about that family in '31
Sometimes innocents become involved
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you
Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between
There are differences
You kill with your left hand
haven't killed _you_
Is that a threat
Taupin moves very close
No
Brenna's face softens
She turns away
Don't
Come here, Brenna
Damn you

James
This is your father
: 108
108 Taupin and Brenna lie together
Running her hands along the contours of his body she sees the countless faint scars of bullet and sword wounds
Taupin strokes her softly
"Brenna"
In Celtic is means "woman with raven hair"
Only chieftan's daughters were allowed it
Brenna is lost in Taupin's scars
What is it like
Being you
Empty
And fear
Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you
It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both
But you're known so much
History 'll only read about
It's all the same
Half lives that never go away
What is it you want
All of it finished
109
-                                       109 Taupin and Brenna stand beside her car
She has an armload of documents
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most
You should be back by nightfall
Will  see you again
Be careful
Don't stay any longer than you have to
Pause
Brenna considers touching him but instead climbs briskly into the car
Good luck
110
-                       110 Detective Moran and his Inspector walk among parked squad cars
Are you sure
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon
Looks good though
They found the receipt in his townhouse
It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory
Round up who you can and put them on standby
Think we should call the local
out there first
No
want this to be all ours
111
111 Brenna is standing at a counter signing the last of a stack
Mrs
Taupin, that's all  need
The clerk fills out a small sheet and hands it to her
Just take this down the hall to the regis- trar
Hurry up though, it's near closing time
Most everyone's gone home already
pair of Levis follow Brenna at a distance down the corridor
112
'                                        112 Sealed from the corridor by a pair of doors, two sit in an office mostly cleared of employees
Brenna hands the slip to a clerk
#2 'll be right back
She disappears into the rear area
(to other clerk) Do you have a drinking fountain
#3 Around the corner
Brenna steps around and takes a drink
She looks into her reflection on the stainless steel and spends a moment fiddling with her hair
Still hasn't returned
Brenna drums her fingers on the counter top and looks around the office
The second clerk is also gone
Brenna sees something unfamiliar on the second clerk's desk
She steps over to it
It is a large blood stain
Brenna shoots a glance to the double doors
They're closed
Brenna rushes to the doors
Someone's locked them
She struggles with the handles, then turns to see the Knight walking to her with his stained sword
With a  she kicks a rolling office chair into him and runs down an opposite corridor
Flings the chair aside and knocks open the door with a of his palm
Has run out of corridor
She looks back at the Knight closing the distance
in fear, she frantically searches for a way out
The Knight is nearly upon her
In desperation she runs into a janitorial closet, closing its heavy door
Is dark and full of old paint cans and mops
Her is at a
Tries the door handle
Stepping back, he lifts his sword and  it deep into the wood
(crying) Oh God
He  again
And again
Splinters smack against surround- ing walls
Go away
Oh God, go away
hysterically, Brenna presses herself against the far wall, sliding to the floor in a crouch
Steps back and gives the door a last two-fisted swing
Brenna
The door collapses
113
-                                         113 group of unmarked police cars race by with the last light of day
114
114 At the wheel is Moran's assistant, the inspector
114
-                                              114 Taupin stands at his fireplace, the only light in the room, poking at it with a tong
His gaze goes to a mantle clock
It is 10:30
The phone
He looks to it
It  again
He picks up the receiver slowly and places it against his ear
' We have some unfinished business
Are you here
' want you to come to me
And if  refuse
' Give me an address where can forward Miss Cart- wright's head
This affects him
' Yes laddie,  have her
Should  care
You have three hours
115
-                                        115 The unmarked cars shoot by
116
116 Taupin hangs up the phone
He looks to the sword on the table, reflecting the firelight
117
-                                         117 , placed around Taupin's house, are shotguns and  pistols
Two officers take positions on either side of the door third, after getting the signal, kicks the door open
118
118 The officers drop to firing positions in the doorway
The room is empty
119
119 An officer  in
It's empty
120
120 The Inspector is on the phone
He's not here
121
-                            121 Spotlights seperate the whitemarble from the surrounding blackness
Taupin's face moves into frame
122
-                                   122 Sword firmly in one hand, Taupin climb's the monument's steps
123
-                                123 twenty-five foot bronze of Thomas Jefferson flanked by his quotations
sword in one hand and Brenna in the other, the Knight stands at the statue's base
Welcome
Taupin stands at the entrance
Kahn sends his best
In a corner the Asian's head lies on its side, the horror of death still pressed into the face
Taupin's eyes return slowly to the Knight and Brenna
Let her go
The Knight throws Brenna roughly against a wall
You disappoint me
(looks at Brenna) thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing
Leave her out of this
As you wish
The Knight holds his sword out at a ceremonial angle
Taupin does the same
The weapons are  together twice, then pulled back into battle position
The two begin walking a circle, poised swords waiting for an opening
The Knight leaps first, his clash of steel  off the high walls
Another  without result
You can do better than that
Taupin swings
The Knight jumps back
Sweat gleams from their brows
124
-                                 124 Two  enjoy a late night walk along the tidal basin
There is a distant  of metal
It's from over near the memorial
He jumps up on a rock
Several yards away can be seen two figures attacking each other
Shit
125
-                                  125 Standing at a map of the city, Moran nurses a cup of coffee
The phone
Moran
All right, get a patrol unit out there right away
'll meet them
126
-                                 126 The Knight and Taupin are  heavily
The Knight goes low
Taupin blocks
The Knight comes overhead quickly
Taupin misjudges and the blade slices deep into his shoulder and chest
The impact knocks him flat on his back
The Knight looks down on his wounded prey
of brakes from outside the monument
Two are coming up the steps
No
Not now
127
-                                           127 The officers reach the top and enter
One of the officers is Dennis, who sees only a  Brenna and Taupin lying wounded on the floor
Brenna
The Knight rushes up from behind, his sword in full swing
128
-                                       128 Moran's car blows through a cross street
129
129 Moran is at the wheel
130
-                                           130 The Knight walks from the two officers spread out like rag dolls on the floor
(to Taupin) Get up
Taupin looks at Brenna and the dead policemen
resignation sweeps over him
What's the point
This isn't done
Get up
What's the point
You have me, finish it
have waited forever for this
You will not cheapen it, little boy
(irony) Tradition
It's all we have
Go to hell
The Knight looks to Brenna
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play
Leave her alone
Get up
Taupin struggles to his feet
Blood pouring from his shirt, he stands uneasily with his sword at ready
The Knight swings
Taupin blocks
131
-                                           131 Moran drives up
There is an empty police car, the door still ajar
132
-                                           132 Taupin is badly outclassed
He feebly fends off an attack, but the Knight returns quickly with a savage  that rips open Taupin's stomach and throws him again to the floor
You bastard
Be silent
Leave him alone
You will be silent
The voice is
Taupin kneels with his forehead pressed against the floor
His teeth grind in pain
The Knight smiles
do hope you're enjoying this as much as me
Stands in the entryway
The Knight sees him
Get out
Moran draws his pistol
The Knight walks toward him, This is nothing that concerns you
Moran levels his gun
The Knight raises his sword
You will leave
Two  as Moran
The slugs slam into the Knight, blowing him off his feet
He lies still
Moran looks to Brenna
To Taupin
Then he walks closer to the Knight
(hoarse) Don't
Taupin curls in a spasm of pain
Moran moves closer
The Knight lies face down, blood oozing from exit wounds over his heart
He isn't breathing
Moran bends over slowly to see the Knight's face
Stop
You don't understand
The Knight suddenly rolls over and plants his sword into Moran's chest
The pistol  against a far wall
Taupin crawls for the Knight
Moran's mouth opens but no sound escapes
The Knight, blood pouring from his mouth and nose, thrusts deeper then retracts quickly
Moran slides off the sword dead
Taupin  hard against the Knight's chest
The Knight in surprise and crumples
Taupin  again, then puts the blade against the Knight's  throat
In mamus tuas Domine commendo spiritum meum
Auditorium nostrum in nomine Domine
He raises the sword
Requiescant in pace
And  the Knight's head off
Taupin drops his sword
His breathing quickens
sensation sweeps over him
Taupin drops to the floor
He sucks in painful gulps of air
My God
Taupin bolts up and looks at her without seeing
Conor
Taupin is looking past her
blood-stained hand suddenly  Brenna's shoulder
She The headless body of the Knight stands beside her
' Lies on the floor
The eyes open
The face pulls into a smile
And now you know
The eyes roll up into the skull
The face slackens
The hulking mass standing beside Brenna sways, the collapses to the ground
Is
Not from wounds he no longer feels, but from something else
What's wrong
can't stand it
Oh God,  can't stand it
Brenna kneels beside him
The scream of your blood
The shriek of trees
Stop it
Stop it
Brenna
What is it
'm the last
Oh Christ, 'm the _last one_
Taupin doubles over in pain
The pain of the whole world trying to force itself into him
Brenna tries to hold him
He pushes her savagely away
Get out
No
'll destroy you
've destroyed everything 've ever touched
Oh God
He doubles over in pain
Conor
He grabs his sword and threatens her
_Get out_
, Brenna runs from the memorial
Taupin is alone
Bleeding
Crying
In agony
: 133
133 Brenna at work in the research area
She's silent
Distant
Something is missing from her
134
-                                    134 Brenna stands in the street before Taupin's townhouse
boarded up window
for-sale sign
Taupin is gone forever
As if he never was
135
'                                         135 desk
single light
cup of coffee
typewriter
Brenna tries to force thoughts to the surface
-
It is at last her journal article
She types a line, then rips it from the carriage and tears it to pieces
The thoughts won't come
136
-                                      136 Brenna sits on the expanse of grass throwing scraps to a group of wild park cats
shadow covers her face
She looks up
It is Taupin
Something has changed him
His face is less cynical
More vulnerable
More human
He sits down on the grass beside her
(after a moment) What are we supposed to say
The cat's eyes are all fixed in Taupin
They cautiously shrink away, frightened
The emptyness
The years and years of void
Nothingness
Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness
Who would have guessed
The inheritance
Not power
Not control
Taupin holds a blade of grass as if it was speaking to him
Life
It is the gift and the under- standing of life
You have lived forever
Life is only life when it is bounded by death
The inheritance is death
The gift is the finality of life
To be part of the fabric
The inside
(turns to Brenna) love you Brenna
Brenna's chin quivers
It will be horrible
The future may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows
can promise you nothing
Nothing but a moment
Maybe two
But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime
(crying) Yes
He holds her
They hold each other
It's taken me so long
So very long
jogger runs by, unaware of any life but his own
