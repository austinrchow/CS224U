Their shapes as    air bubbles and crystalline patterns
this amber abstraction, the   unusual shapes and imperfections caught in the glassy stone:  flecks of dirt, hairs, cracks
ricochet off the different surfaces of the stones
along a creamy stretch of amber
, abstracting the picture further only to find    that suddenly - a bug, a mosquito lodged within an amber tomb
It is folded on its back
as the tip of a fine-pointed drill bores into the amber toward the trapped bug
Orange flecks fly
The mosquito trembles
The drill continues, stopping just before it touches the tiny body
of thin needle-nose pliers reach in the borehole and extricate the mosquito remains
These are dropped on a brightly lit glass slide
conveyor belt starts, and the slide moves along
arriving under a long-lensed microscope

The tube , faster and faster until it is a  on the screen

to a of a dinosaur dig, a major excavation filled with workers shoveling earth and stone, making measurements, taking photographs, scribbling notes, and conferring with each other
The center of all this activity is one man
In a roped-off area that circumscribes the exposed bones of the raptor, is
, head paleontologist
Good-looking, late 30's, with a think beard
Grant lies on his belly, completely absorbed in a small piece of bone
, notebooks in hand, await his next sentence
- the tiny bone
Grant's nose touches it
Grant brushes the bone with a toothbrush
Then he decides on a quicker way to clean it
He licks it
Excited by his discovery, he gets to his feet and addresses his students, who listen raptly
Right calcaneus of an adult female raptor
Mild stress fractures
What's this tell me
Students look at each other
tentative hand
Grant continues
It tells me that this bone connects to the navicula which we already found articulating to the cuboid
, a woman  to him
(off) Dr
Grant
Dr
Grant
Grant looks up
, late 20's, sharp-eyed, tough if she wants to be, runs like a gazelle across the arid land
Exuberant, she leaves a trail of dust behind her
She zips by   guarding the cordoned area
He tries to stop her
Dr
Sattler
Dr
Grant is thinking
Dr
Grant waves her over enthusiastically with his bone and continues
So, what can we stay for sure
Stress fractures in the heel
Uncertain students
Ellie arrives and immediately gets into it
She jumps
Grant turns around to her and smiles
She's got it
Other students to - they knew is all along
Right as rain, Ellie
Now, why did she jump
No answer
Ellie gives it a try
defensive posture against a vicious, blood-thirsty -Rex
(nodding) Perhaps
Or maybe to select the smaller, more tender leaves in the higher branches with which to suckle her young
Ellie jumps up
bet is was a mating ritual
Students laugh
One student eyes Grant's self-conscious smile at Ellie
The science of paleontology can't answer these questions
Novelists and artists who dream a vision of the Jurassic period can attempt these questions with their imaginations
What we scientists can say is considering the mass and kinetic articulation of these bones, this animal had a vertical leap of about twelve feet
Not as entertaining as fiction, but absolutely fact without prejudice
Ellie intrudes again
Excuse me, Dr
Grant
But
fact is, we're late
There's the car
She points
On the horizon, a limousine speeds toward them, leaving a dusty wake
Grant sets the rules for his departure, giving instructions individually as Ellie pulls him away, carrying their bags
Jim, you keep making up the plaster batches
Whatever ratio you're using, it's perfect
Nora, no digging after five - when the temperature drops, those bones are just too brittle
Bill, don't want any tourists walking over my raptor -  don't care if the Governor of Montana is with them, just you guys
Grant and Ellie continue walking
She interrupts his continued barrage
You know, if ev ery scientist stuck to his method like you, there would be no body of theory - no quasars, no big bang - Grant stops at the sight of the stopped limo and freezes
Jesus, a limousine
We're re-entering Hammond's world, that's for sure
(beat) Remind me why we're doing this, Ellie
Ellie is gentle
She's telling him something they've discussed before
We're leaving the raptor dig - - at a critical time - - because Gennaro is paying us sixty thousand dollars to observe some resort of Hammond's in Costa Rica
And that's - - enough money to keep us free of commercial affiliations for two summers
All right, all right
Good
Then, half-kidding with Ellie: Financial independence for fraternizing with the enemy
(beat)  'll do it
She laughs
But he can't quite leave
He grabs a computer printout This is all could come up with, Skip
Skip turns the printout right-side up in Grant's hand
Grant smiles
Wise guy
Let's go, Ellie
Grant and Ellie board the limo amidst many goodbyes from the students
The limo pulls away
-    - purple sunset irradiates the exterior glass walls of the building
peanut flies in the air
Then falls into a big open mouth
Five hundred thousand is peanuts
He tosses another peanut and misses his open mouth
This is , a 40 year old computer programmer
He's fat, with greasy hair and a permanently wrinkled suit
His slovenly looks are wildly out of place on the rich leather sofa where he reclin es
Across a gleaming granite coffee table is  , businessman smooth meticulous dresser, Baker is disgusted by Nedry's sloppy appearance and voracious consumption of food and drink
Nedry finishes a coke
Over his shoulder is an impressive skyline view
'm not reneging
'm re-evaluating
Nedry holds the can of coke upside-down, drains the last drops
You think 'm a scumbag,  know
Nedry chuckles, lines up three peanuts on the table
One after the other, he throws them in the air
He gulps down two, misses one
It skids across the glossy floor
Baker's head involuntarily cocks as he looks disgustedly at Nedry
Look pal, you make a career in biogenetic industrial espionage, and you're bound to run across a scumbag or two
Guaranteed
Part of the job description
Look, who's to say, who is the real scumbag
After all,  know what you guys need so bad
've heard of reverse engineering
As Nedry continues he shovels nuts into his mouth and  and
Let the other guy put in all the work, all the  and
You take the finished product, work backwards, breaking it down to reveal its genetic code
Presto
In a few measly months you have know-how that took researchers ten years to determine
You know how much Hammond has invested of his own personal wealth
Over five billion dollars
And if you guys get the jump on his - in no time, the market's wide-open
Nedry starts the  as he  and
But, boy, he's really got his product
Oh yes siree, massive, gargantuan, money- making, never-heard-of-profit-like-that product
It is a sight
Yes, indeedy
Nedry explosively
He begins to choke,  and
Baker is repulsed
He stares out the window as the sun sets
Nedry, in true distress, clutches his own throat
He clumsily runs toward Baker, toppling chairs as he goes
Nedry grabs Baker's hand and squeezes it tightly, imploring Baker for help
Baker coolly shakes his hand loose and shoves Nedry to the floor
Baker looks down at the prone and desperate Nedry
Scumbag
We have a deal
That deal is not open to renegotiation
Or even re- evaluation
Bakers kneels down next to Nedry, who is beginning to turn blue
The deal stands
Take it or leave it
Baker glances at his watch
'll give you a few minutes to decide
Nedry makes a superhuman effort just to nod his head
Baker nods back and  his fist into Nedry's solar plexus
It works
Nedry sucks in a huge gulp of air
He sits up , rubbing his belly
As Baker leaves the room: Make sure the eggs are on that supply ship
Just make sure
and exits the window
the concrete canyons of Wall Street and enters another office
- , handsome,  meticulously dressed, paces the highly polished, glassy corner suite
His boss, , is seated
He's a powerful black man who waves a prosthetic arm
We can't trust Hammond anymore
He's under too much pressure
There's the , he's behind schedule, and the in- vestors are getting nervous
There have been too many rumors, too many accidents
We can't screw around with this
've asked Hammond to arrange independent site inspections every week for the next three weeks
What does he say
Insists nothing's wrong on the island
You know him
Do you believe him
No,  don't
spent a lot of time with him five years ago when we raised the capital
And it was a wild ride
He's unpredictable, a dreamer
Potentially dangerous
We should never have gotten involved
What's our position
The firm owns five percent
General or limited
General
We should have never done that
It seemed wise at the time
We all wanted the park to happen
It was in lieu of fees
In any case,  agree an inspection is overdue
Who are your site experts
Gennaro tosses a list on Ross' desk
He check it out
Will they tell the truth
think so
That guy Grant's a hotshot in his field, always goes his own way - - Good
You're making all the arrangements
Hammond asked to place the calls himself
think he wants to pretend the park is not in trouble
That it's just a social invitation, showing off the island
All right
Good
But let's be very clear about one thing
don't know how bad this situation actually is, Donald
But if there's a problem on that island - don't be afraid to screw Hammond and burn Jurassic Park to the ground
Gennaro shakes hands awkwardly with Ross and leaves
Ross paces
Fed- up, he whispers to himself
Costa Rica, my ass
He whacks his desk globe, sends its spinning
on spinning globe as we  the   of a helicopter and  : /     - On the helicopter tail is a little blue logo that reads: Isla Nublar
, Grant, Ellie and Gennaro are in the right back row
Ellie dozes, her head occasionally dropping onto Grant's shoulder, to his discomfort
Gennaro looks at papers, trying not to look through the clear plexi-bubble at their feet
Next to  , Nedry chews a candy bar
He offers candy to the back row
Grant loses himself, looking out the window
'  - the aquamarine blue of the ocean
Below the waters there are the shadows of ample marine life
Dolphins leap in the air
Suddenly the clear scene becomes obscured by clouds
There is turbulence
Ellie wakes, glances at Grant, then out the window
There is mist and she absently traces her finger in it, shaping a dinosaur figure
Now land comes into view and for a moment, the island below them eerily fits right into her doodling
That's Isla Nublar
Buckle up, the descent is a little hairy
Gennaro cinches his belt tightly and half-shuts his eyes
Nedry takes out a sandwich and cockily loosens his belt
Ellie looks every way
This is exciting
What is, Ellie
Where are we going
Grant looks out his window
The helicopter rushes forward, low to the water
Ahead, Grant sees the island, rugged and craggy, rising sharply Looks like Alcatraz
The pilot coughs and rubs his goggles with the back of his hand
There's bad wind shear on this peak
Grant nods
Gennaro sweats, watching the pilot tighten his own belt
Ellie smiles excitedly as the helicopter starts down
Now, Grant can't see a thing out his window
Ellie's startled
How the hell is he landing this thing
No answer
Grant dimly discerns green branches of pine trees through the mist
Some are very close
Ellie's hands grasps her seat cushion
This is not fun
Grant looks through the plexi-bubble at his feet
He sees the giant glowing fluorescent cross below
Lights  at corners of the cross
Relax, Ellie
'm sure they wouldn't land if it weren't safe
The copter suddenly  violently
Ellie grabs Grant's hand
Gennaro sits straight up, eyes squeezed shut
Gennaro
This guy knows what he's doing, Right
Hey, Gennaro
'm talking to you
Another violent shake
Grant squeezes Ellie's hand back
- Nedry's hand crushes a packet of crackers
Gennaro is soaked
He opens one eye and looks about, very frightened
He speaks a mantra
No problem
Relax, relax
The pilot whispers to himself and corrects slightly
The copter sails sharply the other way
Whoa
- the pilot jerks back the stick
zooms upward
Grant's beverage flips to the ground, pours across the floor
Nedry's lunch does flying
Sandwich, candy, and cracker crumbs hang suspended in the air
Now it all - onto Nedry's lap
Grant and Ellie lean tightly into each other, don't like this feeling
The pilot swings his gaze, left then right, looking at the pine forest
Trees are close, then far, then close
The helicopter drops rapidly
Ellie and Grant shut their eyes
They brace themselves for the worst
, the copter descends
Tail raised high, nose low, fo r a moment it looks like a strange bug-eyes prehistoric animal bucking in its pen
In a flash, it corrects itself
The copter touches down on a heli-pad
The  of the rotors fades and dies
For a second, no one moves
Grant lets out a great sigh of relief
Gennaro mouths a silent prayer
The pilot stretches his fingers
Grant and Ellie self-consciously shake their hands free of each other
Nedry unbuckles and laughs as he brushes off his lap
He turns: Just think, Gennaro - (laughs harder) - you gotta agree it's funny
These two, they dig up dinosaurs
It's wonderful, isn't it
Nedry pats Grant on his shoulder
Dr
Bones, you're going to love this place
Nedry bursts out laughing again as he heads out the helicopter door
smile comes across Gennaro's face
As he smiles he motions with his hands he doesn't mean any harm
Grant and Ellie stare at him
Come on folks
Gotta get back, there's a storm alert
, a man reaches the copter
He wears a baseball cap over short red hair and he's dressed in phony safari garb
He shakes Gennaro's hand
This is  , 35, head of Public Relations
He throws open the copter door next to Grant
Big, cheerful smile
Hi
Ed Regis
Real big welcome to Isla Nublar, Dr
Grant, Dr
Sattler
Little tough landing here,  know
But you did it
Come on down, we're so happy to have you
Now, watch your step
Ellie and Grant jump into the world of Jurassic Park
- Grant takes in the beautiful tropical terrain
This place is the opposite of the Badlands
There is elaborate planting everywhere: huge, hairy ferns; exotic, spiked flowers; berries of every color; rushing vines
Peeking through the thick greenery are beautiful birds nd flying squirrels
The strange, prehistoric world impresses Grant and Ellie
Even Nedry and Gennaro take in the vegetal wonder
Then, the  of men working, grunting from exertion
Ahead, Muldoon directs
Flame-throwers roar and machetes fight back the abundant foliage
As they attack a new area, Regis waves Muldoon over
Muldoon has a pronounced limp as he walks over to join them
This is Robert Muldoon, great African big game hunter
And he's working for us now
Doing a bang-up job, too
Muldoon rests his rifle by a tree stump and shakes with Grant and Ellie
Ed's a little more  than
Mr
Gennaro, nice to have you back
Gennaro nods warmly as Muldoon limps back to work
Regis leads on, taking Gennaro's arm and talking to him like and old friend
Nedry lumbers in the middle, alone
At the rear, Grant and Ellie study everything they see
Grant calls to Regis but is ignored
Mr
Regis, what is the nature of this park
Ellie looks behind and sees cramped ferns spring out to capture the path they just walked on
She nudges Grant, who has seen the same
Aggressive growth, huh
Hammond's trademark
distinct  in the distance
Then a loud
Grant and Ellie stop
Nedry doesn't look up
Regis flashes his salesman's smile
Out animals are greeting you
They pass a crude sign nailed to a tree:  Welcome to Jurassic Park
Grant cringes at the sign
Ellie nudges him to loosen up
hope this isn't one of those animatronic exhibits in a Jurassic botanical setting
Nope
Gennaro wipes his brow
They enter a green tunnel of over-arching palm that leads to the ' , a modern complex in the distance
Ellie notices a large fence hidden in the brush
She nudges Grant
-    a fifteen foot high chain-link fence
The needle-spiked top of this fence cuts deep into the brush
This fence is only the prelude
Sprawling massively above and behind it is a thirty foot high fence
Woven throughout the fence's mesh is an intricate system of electrical wire
There is a prominent warning:
: -
to the top:  ominous barbed wire, curled into the highest growth with coiled razors glistening in the sun
Grant strains to understand
The quickens his steps to catch the others
They reach a clearing with an unfinished brick sidewalk and potted shade trees waiting for planting
crosshatching of tiny lizards scamper off the walk
An empty swimming pool is being filled by   with a pumper truck
Next to him,  water the large ferns
hope you brought your bathing suits
Doesn't this mist and these plants really create a bonafide prehistoric feeling
Regis points to a low building with glass pyramids on the roof
There's the Visitor's Center
lowers an iron grating on top of one pyramid
An animal
'  - - the iron security grating as it fits over a glass skylight
Above,   weld it on
Sparks fly
Grant stares up at it, thinking
Footsteps echo behind him as Regis, Ellie, Gennaro, and Nedry look around the unfinished building
The Visitor's Center is two stories high, a lot of glass with exposed girders and supports
It's incomplete:  vines swing in the breeze where the back wall will go and undressed cables litter the floor
Even so, exhibit areas are in varying stages of completion
Behind, unpack masonry supplies
Where's Hammond
Mr
Hammond is dying to see you guys
Grant strides over to an exhibit as Gennaro paces impatiently
Hot, hot, hot
Ten billion bucks and the air conditioning sucks
Regis smiles apologetically and pushes open a large window on one of the finished walls
Giant leaves and vines burst inside
Grant studies an exhibit in progress entitled When Dinosaurs Rules the World
This is a large clock that presents millions of years as hours in a single day
Many brightly colored hours are allocated to the dinosaurs
Man receives the last second of the day
Ellie joins Grant
The audicity of man to get here at the last second and think he runs the show
Grant smiles at her inexhaustible enthusiasm
He looks at a painted mural of a Raptor on one of the walls in the half-completed gift shop
Nedry is at a coke machine, feeding in change It doesn't work
He his hand against it, and finally, a cup drops down the chute
Upside-down
It pours
Coke splashes Nedry
He curses and exits
- Ellie pulls Grant over to a raised, round display with a catwalk
In this unfinished display, a skeletal -Rex and a Raptor are locked in combat
Scaffolding is up around it, and painting supplies are scattered all around
Regis glances at his watch, looks up, and smiles
At that moment, doors adjacent to the rotunda swing open automatically
soothing female voice comes out of the public address system
(
) Please come to the theater
In a moment, our film will begin
The voice goes on to give this information in a number of languages
Regis waves everyone into the theater
Nedry doesn't join them
He climbs the stairs to the second floor
- Small and plush
Regis sits in the front, full of enthusiasm
Grant and Ellie sit further behind
Gennaro stands in the back and smokes
fills the room
Mist covers and curls on the stage floor
Colored spotlights illuminate the mist in an eerie fashion
overall effect is the touristy Where's
high-gloss production
years young, with a glint in his eye and very comfortable with his own effect
He wears a white linen suit with a red rose in the breast pocket
Like an elder Carl Sagan, he addresses the group
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen
Welcome to an ancient and mysterious world, a world long before humankind inhabited it with all out remarkable dreams and questions
Enter a world that existed one hundred million years ago
When our changing earth was the abode of magnificent creations
Today, the late twentieth century has witnessed a scientific gold rush of astonishing proportions:  the headlong and furious haste to un ravel the mystery of genetic engineering has become more than just a subject for science fiction writers
- he whispers to Ellie
- the furious haste to commercialize genetic engineering
- he warms to his subject
Biotechnology promises the greatest revolution in human history
It will outdistance atomic power and computers in its effects on our everyday lives
We'll see square trees for easy lumbering and white trout for super visibility to fisherman
Why it will transform every aspect of human life: out medical care, our food, our health, even our very entertainment
- confirmed in his thinking, he whispers again
Here we go
- he concludes
Nothing will ever be the same again
It's literally going to change the face of our planet as we know it
Hammond smiles appreciatively, removes his rose
screen descends behind him
Jurassic Park
What we do here is made possible through the miracle of replication, commonly known as cloning
To explain what cloning means, 'm going to need my own clone - John Hammond
Another Hammond appears, projected on the screen beside the real one
2ND Hi, John
Hi, John
- Ellie laughs aloud
Grant, shaking his head, smiles
- The original speaks to the clone
Okay John, hold out your finger
2ND Why
need some of your genetic material
2ND Now just a minute here, John
Your genetic material is the same in every cell of your body
You have a hundred billion cells
You won't miss a couple
Hammond holds his rose to the screen the pricks his clone's finger with a thorn
2ND That hurt
Hey, what's - The clone dissolves into a cascade of blood as   a magnified view of the bloodstream
begins which illuminates the parts of the blood and its actions
Hammond provides voiceover for the visuals
John, let's look into your blood, the river of life
There's your white cells, exquisitely evolved to clean up bodily wastes
And there's a mighty nucleus, the heart and brain of a cell
This nucleus has an amazing property
It can sp lit in half and reproduce itself
That's how it grows
And then those two can do it again
And again
Making copy after copy of itself
Back to the two Hammond's
Joined by a third, then a fourth, and so on until the screen is crammed with Hammond's, elbowing each other for room
' Hi, 'm John Hammond
Hey, 'm John Hammond
No,  am
am
Come on, that's enough of this
And thought to reproduce myself  had to do it the old-fashioned way
New mist fades out this show
The lights go up
Regis applauds
Grant joins in the laughter with Ellie and Gennaro
Hammond jumps down from the stage and greets Gennaro and Regis
That's all we've got so far
lot of fun, isn't it, Mr
Gennaro
You bet
Hammond greets Grant and Ellie warmly
Then Hammond baits Grant
It's been a long time, Alan
know the preceding was not your sort of enter- tainment
Popular science - No,  don't mind popular science
dislike the commercialization of science
It breeds a sloppiness, a disregard for method
Well,  don't disregard method
But think of mutation - which is nothing more than sloppy communication on the cellular level
Think how triumphant mutations have been in natural selection
Oh, but  know what you're saying
It's true that  have never been afraid to make money with science
've always considered profit to be a measure of success, a barometer of public reaction
Mr
Hammond, the essential truth of a scientific law ha s nothing to do with public reaction
Water freezes at thirty-two degrees, whether you pay for it or not
Hammond turns to Gennaro
Gennaro smiles nervously at their clash
Donald, in bringing my old friend, Alan Grant, you've brought an excellent critic to observe the viability of my island and out venture
look forward to winning you over, Dr
Grant
Just what is it you're trying to clone
- Outside, Hammond leads Gennaro, Grant and Ellie
He points out the staff living quarters, a group of graceful teepees
Next to their homes,  hang laundry and cook on grills
They pass a large Mechanical Building
The generator housed within is very
The wind increases, rippling clothes
Suddenly, the  of a speeding jeep
Grant turns
Racing across the rolling green landscape is
Muldoon is at the steering wheel
Two kids bounce happily around in the open jeep
They are , 9, and , 6, brother and sister
The jeep stops
Grandpa
Hammond looks up, delighted
Arms open
Gennaro pulls him close
(incredulous) Mr
Hammond, this is a serious investiga- tion of the island, not a weekend excursion or a social outing
We're talking about the safety of this place
Hammond waves to the children
'm aware of that
But  built this place for children
You can't investigate it without their reactions
They're what this place is all about
Hammond beams to Grant and Ellie and indicates the running kids
My grandchildren
Genetics were kind
They're more like my ex-wife than me
Lex jumps right into her Grandpa's arms
Timmy s hyly walks up and embraces him
Hammond shines
Gennaro holds in his fury
'  - Hammond ushers his guests into his own richly appointed baronial suite
Ellie looks out a small window at the tee-pees and the contrasting lifestyle below
She then focuses on the high fence, circling the perimeter of Hammond's quarters
Above is a skylight, with metal bars
Grant whispers to her, indicating the obviously modified window frame
Who makes a windows
smaller
Timmy smacks him forehead, points to Grant
know you
You wrote my book
Lost World of The Dinosaurs
It's awesome
Timmy's got dinosaurs on the brain
Don't worry - he'll grow out of it
Dr
Grant's embarrassed that his book was so widely successful
He wrote if for gra duate students
Hammond smiles intensely
But he's patient
He stands be a huge table covered with a sumptuous velvet drape
Although Dr
Grant suspects otherwise, this is not an ill-conceived, half-baked, poorly funded plan that 've headed
This is a plan to which  committed all of my personal resources, literally billions of dollars
And Donald Gennaro here has kindly helped me raise that sum again from wealthy Japanese
They love theme parks
have recruited pre- eminent scientific minds from hallowed universities and we've taken the time to do things right
Lex peeks under the cloth
Hammond smiles at her and recovers the table
Jurassic Park is the most advanced amusement park in the world
We work with genetics - life's essential building blocks - to create new worlds
set out to make biological attractions
Living attractions
Attractions so astonishing that they'd capture the imagination of the entire world
What exactly do you mean
biological attractions
As you well know, long ago, creatures ten times larger than whales roamed our adolescent Earth
And then mass, mysterious extinction created a time barrier unscalable until
now
Yes
Dinosaurs
(superbly proud) 've been cloning dinosaurs
on Grant's incredulous face
Hammond whips off the drape, revealing a complex and detailed scale model of the entire resort
Ladies and Gentlemen, Jurassic Park
Not a resort, not a scien tific conservatory, just a little piece of pre-history that every child in the whole wide world will insist on visiting
Hammond grins with delight
At least every rich child
Grant and Ellie come forward to examine the model
The kids crowd in
through the model - revealing different enclosures with miniature dinosaurs, moats, fences, roads, a river
Apatosaurs in the lowland
Gallimimus in the grassy plain
Dilophosaurus above the river
The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex
238 fabulous creatures so far
Real dinosaurs, Grandpa
Don't they want to just kill each other
Hammond excitedly punches a button - colored display grids light up
Timmy, there's electric fences and moats and video surveillance at all times
There are monitors every hundred feet whatever we could plant them on the island
computer to tabulate it all
You created dinosaurs
Who gave you the right to do that
didn't create them
found a way to wake them up, to stir them out of their prehistoric slumber
We don't have the science
There's no source of dinosaur
Hammond's proud, excited face shifts to one that divulges modestly
Yes
there is
,  , '  - Hammond leads Grant, Ellie, Gennaro, Timmy, and Lex out of an elevator and down an endless corridor
passes them
They go through a series of security doors
To get them open, Hammond places his palm on a screen before each door
Each time, it lights up with an x-ray-like image of his hand and each door  open
- Security x-ray
of Hammond's hand
red line writes through the screen
Can't get in
Complaining, under his breath: Glitches
Hammond tries again
- The door  open, revealing an elaborate technology-crammed room
In dim light, clusters of computer consoles and video monitors glow
Nedry sits in a corner at a keyboard with a pile of papers next to him, typing away
, 45, park supervisor, sits directing the activities of the park and chain-smoking
There are large windows looking out to the park, one of which is cracked and being replaced from the outside by a
Hammond wears a big smile as he leads in his entourage
He's the ringmaster
And this is the right side of my brain
The entire park is safely controlled from here
John Arnold, that genius over there, is the m aster control operator
(with genuine concern) John, don't smoke so much, you're far too valuable a man to me
Oh, you'd survive just fine without me
Arnold exhales smoke and waves good-naturedly
Nedry stares darkly at Hammond, who ignores him
Everything's controlled from here
Remote everything
Cars, feeding programs, medicine dispensers, fecal clean up - and that can be tons in a park like this
We run this place with twenty workers
This computer does it all
And it polices each and every single animal out there
(whispers to Grant) Who polices the computer
Hammond points up
Overlooking the control room and the park is a raised platform with a huge chair, like a throne in a court
large video screen faces this chair
That's where  will watch the astonished watchers
Okay, let's go
They practically race as a group to keep up with Hammond
The security door seals shit, leaving Nedry and Arnold alone again
Thanks for the kind word, Mr
Hammond
Come on, Dennis, he knows your technical contributions have made it all possible
Right
- Hammond and his group turn off the corridor and reach a door marked: : Teratogenic Substances
Timmy backs off, grabs Lex's arm
That stuff turns you into a mutant
He contorts his face into strange shapes
As Hammond leads them all in Lex pulls on his pocket
Don't mind the signs
They're only legal precautions
Gennaro frowns
The door opens and Lex peeks in
My laboratory, Lex
It will be yours and Timmy's someday
,  - Grant and Ellie share a baffled look
Grant stares
Grant's  -   a room filled with honey-colored glowing stones arranged on glass shelves in large pull-out trays
Each stone is tagged and numbered
Grant leans down, studying the stones
He bumps right into Gennaro
Lex jumps excitedly
It's
gold
It's amber
Fossilized tree sap
Grandpa found gold
Grant shushes the kids and looks to Hammond
You're both right
Amber is our gold
The alpha or our alchemic alphabet
The precious course of our genetic material
You already know amber is the fossilized resin of prehistoric tree sap, of course
Grant and Ellie nod impatiently
Hammond sets the scene
Imagine - millions of years ago, tree sap flowing over insects, as it does now as speak, in thousands of forests and backyard trees everywhere
Imagine that ancient sap trapping a little struggling insect and consuming it in a syrupy death
Millions and millions of years pass and we come along and discover this prehistoric insect
If we're lucky, he's perfectly preserved in a fossil form inside the hardened sap which is now amber
And as we examine more and more amber, we find many perished insects, including among them, biting insects - Like mosquitos - Like mosquitos, precisely, Dr
Grant
Mosquitos that sucked the blood of dinosaurs
That's your source of material
My God
It just might work
, carefully positions a piece of amber under a fine-pointed drill
With a nod, the technician's goggles drop from his forehead onto his eyes and he starts up the drill
Hammond yells over the loud
The extraction room speaks for itself
- drillbit boring into the amber
Orange fleck fly
It does
The technician shuts the drill
Placing his hands into a mounted pair of gloves, he operates an automated pair of needle-nose pliers to carefully lift out the remains of a mosquito
He drops this bug on a slide and places this slide on a tray full of such slides
That's a million year old mosquito
conveyor belt starts, carrying this tray on to the
The group follows
This technician puts the first slide under a microscope
Grant watches on a video monito r as the tech inserts a long needle into the prehistoric bug
Put in a piece of amber, find a mosquito, drill it out
Right
Right
You are witnessing the extraction of tissue from the thorax of this humble insect
If this mosquito has ingested any foreign red blood cells - say it bit a hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a -Rex -  we will extract those blood cells and obtain paleo-, the how-to-build instruction book of an extinct creature
So you see, Ellie, 'm not creating dino- saurs
Fossils left behind the information, the map of how to bring them back
'm helping them escape from the confined of time
But even thousands of mosquitos wouldn't give you enough tissue to determine a complete  strand
Right you are, Dr
Grant
More like hundreds of thousands of mosquitos are necessary to provide even a partial strand of
And without a complete strand, we don't have a dinosaur
Along the walls are rows of waist-high stainless steel boxes
In the room's center are two six-foot-high round towers
At a single console, a man studies a monitor
, 35, looks up from his study and beams at his guests
He jumps up and knocks over his cup of coffee
clean the area as Wu comes forward and actually hugs Grant, much to Grant's embarrassment
Ah,  knew you two would hit it off
Dr
Grant, this is Dr
Wu, my chief geneticist
Finally, you are here
've been working without the encouragement of my peers for too long
Welcome, welcome
He kisses Ellie, who takes it in stride
Gennaro, We already knows
Mr
Hammond never lets me publish and he's interested only in results, not in science
Don't forget to thank me when you pick up your Nobel prize
Hammond and Wu resume the tour
You are standing in the middle of the most powerful genetics factory created since the expulsion from Eden
These are Hamachi-Hood automated gene sequencers, those are Cray 's, supercomputers that take  information and organize it
In this room, we take fragmented or incomplete  strands and compare them to other incomplete strands
It's like finding the missing pieces of a jigsaw puzzle
The computers make sever al trillion calculations to provide us with a complete  strand - the genetic code of an extinct animal
, vast room bathed in infrared light, filled with long tables
The first tables have rows and rows of centrifuges, each bearing dozens of test tubes
Wu leads the group
Okay, you have your "complete" strand
How do you grow it
We use unfertilized crocodile ova as our breeding medium
Our primordial soup
And how do you know what it is you're growing
Wu shrugs
Well, we have computer techniques to try and map out finds on an evolutionary basis
But mostly, we just grow it and find out what it is
If it's something we're interested in, and it survives, we keep it
Grant and Ellie share a concerned look
And if you're not interested
Wu indicates a cabinet of chemicals with skull-and-crossbone warnings
Timmy regards the poison with excitement
Lex calls from deeper in the room
Come look
Here, plastic eggs lay on the long tables, their pale outlines obscured by a grey mist that covers the tables
The eggs are all gently rocking as  roam up and down the aisles
Hammond walks ahead of the group
As Wu speaks, Hammond listens and enjoys it as though he's hearing it for the first time
This is the incubation room
We keep the temperature at ninetynine degrees and a relative humidity of one hundred percent
Jurassic atmosphere
Timmy smiles at Grant
Hammond winks at Timmy
We also run a high oxygen concentration, up to thirty-three percent, so if you feel faint, please tell me right away
Lex feigns a faint, Timmy cracks a small smile
They move forward, waist-deep in the mist
strange green light emanates from the incubators
Lex is half-consumed by the mist
She mimics the witch
'm
melting
Ellie laughs and pulls Lex close
Reptile eggs contain large amounts of yolk but no water at all
The embryos must extract water from the surrounding environment
That's why you create the mist
Wu nods
Hammond just enjoys the scene as Grant and Ellie watch a thermal sensor moving from one egg to the next, touching each with a flexible wand, beeping
Lex and Timmy let their hands glide over the sides of the green glowing incubators fully awed by the strange, big eggs they hold
Children, please do not touch
The eggs are permeable to skin oils
Grant that very close to an egg
He sniffs it
What kind of eggs are these
Are these shells plastic
Yes, they are,  The embryos are mechanically inserted and then hatched in this room
But we've managed to sufficiently mimic the actual biological process - these creatures rupture the plastic membrane that they're contained in when they're born
Like real births
They reach an endless row of incubators, lined up along the wall, beneath a viewing area like those found in an - ward
Eggs that are determined viable spend their last couple days in our specially- designed incubators, which help accelerate the pre-natal developmental stages
Which is interesting becaus we're having a problem with the adult animals - Hammond claps a hand over Wu's mouth and laughs
There's no problem Dr
Wu can't handle
Now who wants to see the real thing
As they exit the   the misty aisles, studying the eggs
'  - Blue shadows of clouds sweep across an expansive green hill in front of the Visitor's Center
Grant and Hammond make their way down below to the loading area for the park tour
little ahead is Gennaro and Ellie
Gennaro chatters on while Ellie energetically explores the area, looking at the plants
so naturally, Hammond's going to present everything in the best light need to know that this park is safe
'll tell you something that troubles me from the start
The carnivores are all well-fed and kept separated from their natural prey
That'll keep 'em alive, but it won't keep 'em happy
How do you mean
The carnivores will want to hunt
It's an instinct
And that instinct will have to be satisfied or suppressed
, moving slowly, Hammond eyes the pair suspiciously
Gennaro is putting negative ideas into Ellie's head
He's a naysayer
have no affection for that type of thinking
Don't worry
Ellie makes her own judgments
At the base of the hill Timmy and Lex toss a baseball
- The group gathers
glide to a stop behind them
Regis leans out of the first one
Hey
Great day for a tour
Looks like rain to me
No
told the rain-god to hold it off till we got back
The kids pile in next to Regis and explore the high-tech cars
Timmy finds a a pair of very think, strange-looking goggles with dials on top
Grant, Ellie, and Gennaro climb in the second car
Kids, mind Mr
Regis
He's in charge now
The cars begin to move and pass Hammond
He waves
Gennaro looks back as the cars turn into the brush
Hammond waves
Gennaro, for once in your life, let something really move you
In the cruiser, Gennaro rubs his neck
He turns to Grant
Ever get the feeling we're just Hammond's damn guinea pigs
like to wait and see
Ellie motions ahead, with excitement and apprehension, to a huge gate
Regis and the kids wave behind to Grant, Ellie and Gennaro
The gate's doo rs swing open and the cruisers move forward
The kids squeal out a - that floats through the air to Grant
But Grant wears a cautious face, his skeptical eyes scan the landscape
of trumpets and then a pre-recorded voice speaks from a console in each cruiser
Video screens display a welcome message
- Welcome to Jurassic Park
You are now entering the lost world of the prehistoric past, a world of mighty creatures long gone from the face of the earth, which you are privileged to see for the first time
Regis uses his walkie-talkie to contact Grant's cruiser
( ) That's Richard Kiley
We spared no expense
- We'll begin our tour today with the herbivores
/  ,    - Between massive tree trunks, a spectacular view:  stor m clouds touch mountaintops
Below, the lagoon ripples in pink crescents
- and the grasses are a species of juniper, and samples can be purchased at the gift shop
Now, if everyone will take a look to the right
All eyes swing that way
Grant doesn't see a thing
Nor do the others
, Timmy pulls the binoculars out of the equipment pouch and studies the location
Lex grabs the night goggles
Timmy pulls them from her
Look
don't see anything
Do you see anything
There's nothing there
Something's out there
, a fly buzzes on Grant's windshield
Grant hangs out his window almost sniffing the air for some movement
Nothing
the trees in front of them move
deep trumpeting  and rumble away fr om the side of the road
The ground as they walk, their  fills the air
Led by Grant, the passengers rise through the open top of their Land Cruisers, to look up at the dinosaurs far above
, leaves and little branches shower on Grant
Utter amazement fills Grant's face, then his mouth breaks into a giant smile then a laugh
He simply can't believe his eyes
His laugh becomes raucous and euphoric
Ellie
Can you imagine the excavation team seeing this
Behind him, Ellie's whole person is awestruck, immobile
Gennaro squints, straining to make sense of this unbelievable reality
, Lex and Timmy stare open-mouthed
Regis looks at the animal and then at the group's reverie
He smiles knowingly: he's been there, too
He bends and whispers: Congratulations
You're the first kids in the whole wide world ever to see real dinosaurs
The kids look up at Regis with wonder in their eyes
' stop laughing
Still chewing, a brachiosaur cranes down to peer at this laughing man
The brachiosaur's huge head stops inches away from Grant
Grant, awestruck, stares and them - - Grant as his eyes slowly roll back and
he faints
The dinosaur casually moves away as Ellie comes to Grant's aid
Alan
Alan
(sort of delighted) He fainted
Gennaro waves to Regis that all is okay
Grant slowly revives
He looks back at the brachiosaur, groggily, smiling away
He looks at Ellie and their eyes linger on each other longer than usual, sharing a look of serene delight
Gennaro plops back in his seat and ponders the scene before him glazed look fills his face
My God, we're going to make a fortune here
on the majestic, gentle beauty of the Brachiosaurs
, growing l ouder and louder
- Hammond sits at his throne, happily watching the huge video screen which displays the tour group
He laughs raucously and calls to Arnold
He fainted
've waited fifteen years to impress that young man
Oh Mr
Hammond, 'm sorry to interrupt you, but Muldoon needs you by the pit
Oh, balls
/  ,    - The cruisers come to a stop
In the distance, graze
They stand on their hind legs to get at high palm trees, then drop gracefully down on all fours to chew
scamper around the adults, eating leaves that drop from the larger animals
- Gallimimus, known as the ostrich dinosaur for the shape of its shoulders, have a very strong nesting instinct
Grant do esn't listen
He is simply intoxicated with the pastoral beauty of the gentle, grazing dinosaurs
Suddenly, he looks away with a deep concern
Ellie looks at him questioningly
Ellie
What the hell are we going to do with the rest of our lives
Ellie smiles at him, puzzled
What to you mean
Can't you see it, Ellie
We're the ones that are extinct now
/  ,    - - lots more to see in the herbivore section of our park
But as we come alongside out Jurassic jungle river to the left, let's try and catch a glimpse of a very unusual and dangerous carnivore
Look across the river and above
lovely mossy clearing
And to the side, bounded just by a thicket of bushes, a precipitous drop to a tropical river, lus h and clear
The river runs fast but it is narrow
On the other side is a sharp rise
- And there they are
Standing on that natural pedestal and watching our tour come to a stop are  , man-sized dinosaurs with gills that hang around their necks
Grant and Ellie chime in with the pre-recorded voice
Dilophosaurus
Timmy and Lex point enthusiastically
Regis holds them down with a gentle but restraining arm
- Dilophosaurus is one of the earliest carnivores
Scientists once thought their jaw muscles were too weak to kill, but now, through the miracle of their cloning, we know Dilophosaurs spit venom, a poison which causes blindness and then unconsciousness
Their distinctive  drifts across the afternoon air
Poisonous d inosaurs, there's a liability issue without a lot of precedent
of the nearly motionless Dilophosaurus
One yawns wide
(assessing) It's like a Gila monster of a cobra
It's a poison
Spitter
The Spitters bound off as Grant watches, transfixed
flock of birds burst from a tree and cross the sky
Trees filter the light
Are we dreaming all this
- big hole in the ground, covered with a think wire mesh
Suddenly, a dark claw pushes against the wire web animals  and
An animal slams its face into the mesh illuminate a set of -
Muldoon stands next to the pit, carefully loading an assault rifle
Hammond comes in a hurry
Muldoon sees Hammond and puts down the rifle
He walks to Hammond, talking before he gets there
These raptors are too damn dangerous
One of them tunneled out this morning
He ripped a boy's arm off before  could get a bullet in him
bullet
Muldoon - no
Now what have five left
John, they're mean as scorpions and smart as chimps
Their little fingers make them natural cage-breakers
We should terminate the raptor program
They're just too smart
Too damn smart
Oh balls
will not terminate the raptors just because they're behaving normally
They're hunters
Why can't we contain them properly
Hammond starts to walk away
Muldoon follows, he's not finished at all
John, remember back in '88, when we started to build the containment devices
We ordered cattle prods, tasers, guns that blow out electric nets
They're all too slow for these guys
If we're going to keep the raptors,  want  missiles and laser-guided devices
Hammond laughs warmly
He pats Muldoon on the back
It's just a zoo, Muldoon
zoo
Figure out a way to contain them
And we'll sit down and have a nice long discussion about raptors - after my guests leave, okay
Hammond walks away
Muldoon stares after him, jingling keys in his hand
Muldoon lumps over to
Okay
Get a 'dozer, start digging round the pit
We're gonna bury some fence
And wear your rifle when you're working
- Hammond enters and crosses to his throne
Hammond swivels to Arnold who exhales smoke
Nedry looks over, keeps typing
Wh ere are they
Punch 'em up
They'll be by the trike's in a moment
Trike's sick again
How can you say it so matter-of-factly
The trike's
You casually accept it, but never can
You know what it means when you say "by the trikes"
"By the trike's" means that they're out there by the species:  triceratops horridus
It astounds me every time what 've done here
What magic, what alchemy
We turned a piece of a rock into a dinosaur
will never be complacent about that
Arnold smiles and punches a button
the pre-recorded tour voice and some chatter of the kids
on the tour   by a radio transmission to the control room
Arnold slides over and shuts off the tour monitoring
The picture on the video screen is now of a cargo boat at a dock
Hello, John
This is the Anne  at the dock
'm looking at the storm patterns just south of us
Requesting permission to leave before unloading the last three food containers
Nedry looks up quickly, listening carefully
Don't want to be stuck here if this chop gets much worse
Hammond reacts with quiet dismay
Nedry quietly gets up
Coffee anyone
He's ignored
Arnold defers to Hammond who leans to the microphone
Hello skipper, John Hammond, how are you tonight
certainly don't want to imperil anyone
But can you give us one more container of food
Then we'll feel comfortable is the storm delays your return
Could you help us out here
Of course, if it looks too choppy just go, but you'd be doing us a big favor
Well
we'll do our best, sir
We'll get one more container off
How's that
Hammond thanks him and signs off
Arnold looks at the darkening clouds
/  ,    - The cars twist through dense vegetation with a  of gears
The first car comes to a jerky stop
There is a huge  lying on its side, moving very slowly, breathing laboriously
, the tall, balding park vet, kneels on the ground
He peers into the animal's mouth with a large flashlight
Before the second car can stop completely, Grant leaps out, races to the trike
Regis tries to restrain the kids but they chase Grant and Ellie
Grant joins Harding on the ground
The trike lets out a low
She's too sick to move
Ellie and Lex squat by the animal
feel so sorry for her
She's so sick
We don't know what's wrong with Freda
Every six we eks she gets like this
Oh, she'll be up and around in no time
After a big night,  feel the same way
Grant very gently opens the Trike's mouth
Poor girl
What's the matter
Ellie, look at this
dark purple tongue droops limply from her mouth
Ellie shines the light on it, illuminating silvery blisters
Gennaro turns away
Microvesicles
Interesting
Grant scratches one of the blisters with his ball-point pen
It oozes
The kids share a grossed-out look
Doesn't she have a mommy and a daddy
We make these dinosaurs in the lab, sweetheart
But they do form attachments
Freda has a little one that follows her around, thinks Freda's his mom
Grant starts to look around
What does sh e eat
Where does she feed
Animal this size takes in a minimum of six hundred pounds of plants a day
We truck in hay and meadow grasses seven times a day
That's all she touches
Grant studies the nearby grass and bushes
Timmy quietly follows Grant
Ellie lifts a huge eyelid on the triceratops
runny eye just stares
Grant comes up triumphantly with a bouquet of weeds clutched in his hand
These weeds have little purple berries
Ellie looks over
West Indian Lilacs
These'd give anybody a stomachache
'm telling you, the animals don't eat don't eat that stuff
Regis keeps a babysitter's eye on the kids
Timmy comes up with a handful of smooth stones
He approaches Grant shyly
Dr
Grant, sir
How 'bout these
There' s lots of little piles of these
Grant fingers one distractedly, then suddenly comes to attention
Hey, Ellie take a look at his
Good work, Timmy
Ellie gets up, brushes herself off, comes over and examines the stone
Extremely smooth
Purple stains, could be those lilac berries
She and Grant smile and each other and nod
Gennaro is curious
don't get it
Looks like your trike swallows stones to help her digest her food
Walking around, she crushes berries against the stones
And even just a little crushed berry is eventually enough, So, she poisons herself periodically
Bet we tested her saliva for any trace of - But with th e stones, she swallows them and probably bypasses any mucosal contact
Straight to the stomach would test her excrement
Yo, yuk
light  begins
Automatically, with a soft hiss, the glass roofs of the cruisers slide shit
Gennaro taps Regis and indicates the cars
Hey Regis, where are your rain gods
It's gonna pour
Let's finish our tour
Grant agrees, heads for the cruisers
He turns and looks for Ellie
Ellie stands by the Trike
She gives Grant a meaningful look
'm staying
Grant smiles at her decision
Soil samples
You read my mind
(confidentially) think she's sicker then they're saying
Her skin is dry and flaky
And her gums are pale
'm going to talk to Dr
Wu
Good idea
'll keep my eyes open
Gennaro climbs in with Grant
The two cruisers start off and Timmy turns backward to stare wistfully at Grant
Regis and Lex wave to the Trike
Grant looks back to Ellie who has already begun to work
- a mosquito lands on its back
The trike's tail slaps it dead
- With difficulty, Nedry shoves his large body down the crawl space behind a large rack of electronic equipment
He stops and uses a suction cup device to lift a section of the tiled floor
He gropes among cables and pulls out a small wireless radio
He transmits: ( ) Jim, what the hell's with you
know a storm's coming,  can't
it's all so tightly planned
that's not enough
ok, twenty minutes, 'll be there
Damn
Nedry returns the radio to its hiding place
He sucks in his gut to make the crawl out of  the narrow space
/  , -   - The cruisers stop on the rise of a hill
They over look a forested area, sloping down to the edge of the lagoon
The mighty -Rex arose late in dinosaur history
Dinosaurs ruled the earth for a hundred and twenty million years, but there were tyrannosaurs for only the last fifteen million years of that period
Farther south, they see the graceful necks of the brachiosaurs standing at the water's edge
Their bodies, mirrored in the moving surface, break apart with the continuing drops of rain
Hear lightning rhythmic- ally pulses the sky
All is quiet except for the soft drone of cicadas and the tapping of light rain
Regis calls Grant on the walkie-talkie
( ) You know, Dr
Grant, Hammond likes to come here in the evening and just sit
( ) Where is the - Rex
( ) Good question
- as he takes that in, nodding to himself
Studies the land
Maybe she's down hunting apatosaurs
- Regis laughs, his voice tinny over the radio
( ) Would if she could, believe me
Some- times she stands by the lagoon and stares at those animals, and wiggles those little forearms of hers in frustration
But the -Rex territory is completely enclosed with trenches and fences
Believe me, she can't go anywhere
Then where is she
They hear
In the center of the field, a small cage rises into view, lifted on hydraulics from underground
The cage bars slide down
remains tethered in the field,  plaintively
The tour group stares out their windows, expectantly
- Hammond, pleased, watches the giant screen that displays the tour group
Muldoon limps into the control room
Arnold looks over
Just checking in
Everything ok
Look at them
Leaning out the windows, so eager
They can't wait to see it
They have come for the danger
That's what 'm afraid of
Muldoon twirls the keys on his fingers and watches the land cruisers
, -   - Grant watches quietly
The  becomes louder, more insistent
The goat tugs frantically at its tether, racing back and forth, kicking
What's going to happen to the goat
Is the -Rex gonna come eat the goat
Grant senses something
He sits straight up
Looks out intently
He's here
The goat is tethered in the middle of the fi eld, thirty yards from the nearest tree
Grant scans the tree for the -Rex
The goat senses something too
It struggles and strains, bleating frantically
Suddenly the mechanical  of the cage coming up
Its bars surround the goat with safety once again
Looks like the Rex will have its snack a little later today
The sensors don't see the Rex around
She usually comes within five minutes of hearing dinner
If she doesn't, that means she's sleeping - we might have access to her at the picnic area
Lex and Timmy let out a sigh of relief
The tension is gone
didn't want to see him get eaten liked the goat
- Hammond studies the large video monitor
He watches Grant and Gennaro
Their voices are heard in the control room
( ) What is a carnivore got out
() There'd be no stopping it
Huge, with no natural enemies, and a suppressed hunting instinct
Hammond glares
Arnold, aware, shuts off the screen
Damn those people
They are so negative
It's natural
They can't fully appreciate that we've engineered the animals and the park for total safety
They comb this island like a bunch of accountants
They don't experience the wonder, the awe of it all
You can't make people experience wonder
Hammond gets up and stands before the big windows overlooking the park
The quartz  outside their area   with a rosy glow and the dark jungle is opened again to their inspection
At his console, Nedry looks at Hamm ond
Hammond stares out the window
The    and bounces off the window
Hammond speaks to Arnold without turning
It's like the Garden of Eden out there
This is the most beautiful time of day
Better rout the tour back
They can start again sun-up tomorrow morning
Yup
Call the kitchen
Those kids'll be hungry when they get in
Arnold picks up the phone
He glances over at Nedry
Sorry 'bout that
've taken all the lines to upload some data
Hammond's annoyed, but contains it
Arnold looks at Nedry, who smiles
'll clear a couple of lines for you at the end of the next transmission, sir
Here you go now, this will make it all better, Mr
Hammond
Nedry punches in a code
- Nedry's fat finger punching a last key
- amber video display terminal as a countdown begins
As the screen counts down from ten to zero, Nedry peers at Hammond with a steely glint in his eyes
- three, two, one, the countdown hits zero
Nedry's data-filled screen blinks off
Nedry looks up to the rack of monitors
Unnoticed by Hammond or Arnold two more monitors go blank
Then a third one
,   - The electric cars turn up into a scenic area high above the rest of the park
a dramatic view down to the ocean
There the supply ship, the  , unloads its last crates
On the other side of the road are picnic tables, an unfinished snack bar and rest rooms
To the side of this rest area is a view of the interior of the island
guard-rail separates visitors To the other side of the rest area is a concrete moat and in the back of this is a tall, electrified fence
Surrounding the electric fence is a smaller protective fence
- enjoy a healthy snack
This is also a good time to
Hey, is that bathroom working
Sure
(he uses his walkie) Rest stop
The kids take off towards the bathroom, running through the rain
Grant gets out of his cruiser, strides to Regis
He indicates the fence
Is that still the -Rex paddock
Yes
But she never comes here
don't know why not
Probably too much construction
, jacket over his head against the rain, looks down to the ocean
'  -     he last cargo crate
at the concrete moat
Studies its deep curve
He looks up at the tell electrical fence with its 10,000 volt warning
He sees conventional power lines on the opposite sid e of the road
the empty cruisers
Inside, the pre-recorded voice is chatting on
It slows eerily and stops
Video
- Nedry yawns loudly
Yup
Looks like a never-ending weekend for me
'm gonna get a Diet Coke
Don't touch my console, ok
Line will be clear in five minutes
Nedry leaves
Hammond swings around and growls under his breath
Slob
Well, at least he knows what he's doing
, '  - Nedry races through the series of security doors
He ignores the security x-ray device and just  each door open with his hand
,   - , leaving the group in shadowy darkness and now There's a ripple of surprise from the group
Regis rounds them all up and directs them back into the cruisers
Everything's just fine
It's a temporary glitch due to the rain
No doubt, they're going to re-rout some circuits back at the mainframe
We'll have the power back on in moments
Let's get back in the cruisers, they may start up, and 'd like us all to be seated in them
The cruisers are
, Gennaro turns to Grant
knew we shouldn't have kids here
vivid  of
:  Lex covers her eyes
Then she looks up at Regis with a frightful face
Mr
Regis, are dinosaurs
nocturnal
No, darling, of course not
Mr
Regis
What's
nocturnal
Another
Lex cries
Regis comforts her
Don't you worry about d inosaurs
They're all very safe in their paddocks just like animals in a big, strong zoo
They're not going anywhere we don't tell them to go
Timmy looks out the window excitedly
,  - All those eggs on tables
No moving sensors
Nedry pulls a portable incubator away from the dozens lined up against the wall
Its electrical cord goes flying
Furiously, Nedry fills the incubator with eggs, one after the other
Okay, little ones
Here we go
Nedry grabs the handles of the incubator and runs with it
The incubator careens on one wheel as he turns the corner and exits
- Hammond looks out the large window as the
He twirls
What's going on, Arnold
want those lights on
don't want my grandchildren scared
Jesus, the computer's gone down
Well,  want the computer up
This is the wrong weekend for glitches
Arnold still examines his console
He looks out with worry
That's not the worst of it
Oh yeah
Please tell me what's worse than the lights going out
Wu smashes through the door
All the security doors are open
Someone has been in my laboratory and the eggs have been disturbed
The camera pushes in on Hammond's face
Where the hell is Nedry
Where is he
Did anybody check the damn john
Hammond storms out
, '  - Hammond enters the hall
Muldoon, racing from the other direction, yells: John, the generator's shut down
Who cut the power
Arnold's on it
You go out and bring back the tour right away
don't need any of this
Muldoon is already running back the way he came
- Several electric land cruisers are stored in this shadowy room
There is a glassed-in area where Muldoon's weapons are stored:  assault rifles, tasers, tear gas canisters
To the side of the garage s Muldoon's red jeep
In the passenger side of the front seat is a rocket launcher
Nedry storms in, wheeling his incubator
He stop suddenly and listens
Approaching
Oh, shit
, '  - Muldoon runs down a long corridor, stop with a skid and yanks open the door to the garage
He runs out
His boots  on the concrete
- '   as he listens to the footsteps
Wheezing, with great difficulty, Nedry bends his knees and strains
With everything he's got, he lifts the incub ator waist-height
And holds it
- Muldoon's footsteps  as they come closer and closer to the garage
Muldoon whips down the curve in the stairs
His jacket catches on an incomplete section of banister
Yanks him to a stop
- Muldoon's jacket as it , stays caught
-  as he tries to heave higher, can't
Beads a sweat roll down his brow
caught jacket and then keep going
Nedry's face drips with sweat
The incubator slips out of his sweaty palms
Catches it with his knee
Nedry curses and with one forceful boost, he lifts the incubator shoulder height
- Muldoon's feet on long stairwell
,   in a labored fashion
He looks this way and that
He closes his eyes and with one superhuman effort, he heaves the incubator into the back seat of the red jeep
Nedry exhales
At that moment,   the vestibule between stairs and garage
the shadowy figure in the vestibule
Nedry's frightened face
and reaches in his belt
He pulls out his pistol
He takes out long, shiny cartridges
He loads the pistol
in the front of the jeep, pushing aside the rocket launcher, and zooms into the night
moment later, Muldoon enters the garage
He sniffs at the exhaust that still hangs in the air
He looks over and is surprised to see his jeep gone
He bends and inspects fresh tread marks
He looks up, his face straining to understand
- Nedry's red jeep flies down the park road
- Nedry's wheel as he turns it
His tires skid sideways, then regain traction
The jeep bolts up a smaller access road
He skids to a stop at the top of the hill
Nedry jumps out and looks up
His high beams illuminate a huge electric fence prominently labeled:
10,000 Volts
Two safety fences separate Nedry from the electric fence
He races to the first one, pulls out a key chain
He tries one key, then another, and another
It f its
Nedry unlocks the gate, swings open the door
Nedry runs to the second gate
He slips in the mud
He slides to the ground, dropping keys in a muddy pool
- Nedry's hand frantically fishing for the key chain in the muddy water
Got them
Unlocks the second gate
He races to the electric fence
him now
Water beads on his face
Lightning flashes on the 10,000 volts warning
He grabs the gate with his bare hand and swings it open
Nedry heads back to his jeep, his fat body strobed by its high beams
He jumps in the jeep and drives through
Behind him, the open gates move recklessly in the stormy night
Ellie and Harding pull in, in their own gas-powered jeep
Muldoon is waiting for them
Now there's a rifle slung over his shoulder
Harding jumps out of the jeep
Get out, get out
need this jeep
There's a problem with the tour
Ellie, Hammond'll fill you in
Ellie is concerned, the n decisive
No
'm going with you, Muldoon
They race out
- Headlights blazing in the darkness, Nedry's jeep skids to a stop by the dock where the   is preparing to leave
The water is very choppy
Nedry jumps out and pulls his incubator to the ground
He begins to drag it through the mud, toward the ship
comes to meet him, along with   , who hoist the incubator easily and carry it toward the ship
Good
Glad to see you
Were you seen
Nah
'm back in five minutes, they'll never know  was gone
(yells after the men with the incubator) Careful with that thing
It's worth more than the ship
(to the Captain) When's the copter meeting you
It's not
The storm's coast-to-coast, nobody could land on the water
(totally panicked) Shit
What's the backup
don't like this
Maybe we should do it another time, don't like it
just don't like - Shhh
wired Baker, he'll have a man at the dock in Puntaremas
We should be able to make that in time
(somewhat relieved) Ten hours
Yeah, now relax
got a lot riding on this too, you know
No one's going to mess up now
Baker's not going to mess up
His people won't let him
Ok
Ok
Here
Nedry pulls an aerosol can out of the baggy crotch of his pants
Look, this is insulating spray
- Nedry sprays a big mound of white foam into his hand, In about eight hours, spray down all the eggs with this stuff
It'll keep 'em warm but not too warm
hope Baker has it together with the dock
,   - Rain drums down on the cruiser
Timmy stares out at the dark
Lex stares nervously out the side window
Timmy picks up the night goggles and snaps them on
Hey, these thing work great
can see in the dark and  can see far
He swivels away from the -Rex paddock and looks out toward the ocean
He reaches up and adjusts the knob
Hey
wonder if that boat's still there
It is
think they're getting ready to go
'  - the fluorescent green image of men untying casting lines on the boat
Another   and Lex  and covers her face
She cries
Timmy, can you give her the goggles
Lex clamps her hands over her eyes
Timmy gently nudges her
Want to look at the boat, Lex
Timmy hands her the night goggles
Lex dries her eyes and takes a peek with the goggles toward the ocean
Hey, that fat guy's down there
Is he gonna come get us and take us to Grandpa
'  - the picture streaks but clearly reveals Nedry shouting at the Captain
Men heave the incubator onto the ship
They have one of those things from the room with all the eggs - you know, where they help the baby eggs grow up
You mean an incubator
( ) What's the commotion
Let me see
Give them to men, sweetheart
( ) Uh, Dr
Grant
th e walkie talkie and tries to silence Timmy
He knows he gets there too late and reluctantly lets Timmy have it back
We saw that computer guy helping 'em load an incubator onto the ship
( ) Yeah, he's stealing them, Dr
Grant
He's stealing my Grandpa's eggs
( ) Nedry
With an incubator
Regis
( ) (finally acknowledges) That's what they saw
- He looks sharply at Gennaro
( ) We gotta tell Hammond and Arnold right away
How far is it to the mainland
- He looks at Regis
( ) Uh, it's a hundred miles to Puntaremas
About a sixteen hour voyage in this weather
- He fiddles with the radio in his cruiser
No r esponse still
wouldn't like to see dinosaurs running around Costa Rica
When's the damn power coming on
/ ' , Muldoon and Ellie drive into the storm
Suddenly, he slams on his brakes
In front of him, a tree has fallen, completely blocking the road
Muldoon curses, swerves around, and skids to a stop
As Muldoon gets out and assesses the situation, Ellie lodges herself between the tree and the jeep
She pushes the tree with her strong legs and moves it a good five feet
Quickly, Muldoon and Ellie drag the tree
As they struggle
Strong legs
Lot of track in college
,   - , Regis drums his fingers on the dashboard
Timmy wears his goggles and stares into the rain
Lex shifts her body around, trying to get comfortable to rest
'm hungry
When can we get going
When the electricity comes back on, honey
These cars run on electric cables buried in the road
, Grant tries the radio to no avail
Gennaro smokes
Grant looks forward toward the first cruiser
He can barely make out the car in the dark and rain
Occasionally,  reveals all
out of his pocket
Feels a tiny shake, looks around
He puts it in his mouth, chewing quietly
, the whole car Regis' sunglasses jump off the dashboard and fall to the floor
The kids look at him
Must be turning on the electricity
Lex sits up, looks around groggily
Feels like a vibration
-  - The -Rex's huge hind feet crash down, one large foot following after the other in long, powerful strides
,   - There is a thud, and then a , and then a
Tim and Lex share a frightened look
Now the thud grows
There is a  , the whole cruiser
Then silence
Then another
- Timmy stares out with his night goggles
'     - -Rex paws rest on the electric fence
Tim takes off his goggles, stares, transfixed
Regis picks them up
- of muscular forepaws with pebbled, grainy skin and thick, curved nails comfortably gripping a thick wire strand
The -Rex moves his body forward of the brush, pushes against the fence
- Grant and Gennaro stare out, unseeing in the rain and darkness
- Tears roll down her cheek
She cries silently with an unknown fear
Regis pulls the goggles from his eyes, starts to gag, checks it
Jesus Christ
Bad language
Jesus Christ
The fence isn't electrified
Is that bad
Regis turns, looks out the side window, away from the -Rex
Regis is shaking uncontrollably
Suddenly he throws open his door and bolts off into the rain, leaving the door open
No move from the Rex
Regis races by the second cruiser
Grant stares out at him
Mr
Regis
Mr
Regis, where are you going
He just left us
He just left us all alone
Timmy, Timmy how could he do that
We're all alone
We're all alone
The Rex butts his head
'  - The fence bangs down on top of his cruiser
Timmy and Lex recoil from the scrape  of the wire mesh against the car
- '  - through the almost obscuring rain they see the fallen fence
An unseen weight pulls on it fur ther, causing its electric wire to pop like over-tuned guitar strings
- out into the rain for the open door handle
Another   and the creature is revealed standing between the two cruisers, atop the crushed fence
His head turns back and forth, he's deciding on his prey
Grant and Gennaro or Tim and Lex
Timmy slams the door shut
He looks directly at the Rex, just a few feet away
The Rex turns to him, stares back
Lex  and Timmy claps a hand over her mouth
There is a whisper over Tim's walkie-talkie
( ) Timmy, be quiet
Don't move
- He snaps off the walkie-talkie
- The rain runs in rivulets down the pebbled skin of the muscular hind legs
The animal's head is out-of-view, above the rooftops of the cars
The Rex lifts its huge hind leg
Holy shit
Any suggestions what we do now
Can't think of a thing
The -Rex slowly circles Grant's cruiser
- He watches the beast move
- As they twist and turn, trying to find a circling Rex in dark and rain
The Rex pauses right next to Gennaro's window
He lowers his head, looking for movement inside
- the beady, expressionless reptilian eye moving in the socket
Grant whispers, hardly moving his lips
Don't move
Gennaro's leg trembles uncontrollably
- Very frightened, Lex discovers a flashlight
She flicks it on and off, distracting herself
The beam shows her eyes full of a quiet panic
It's too, too dark out there
Tim waves his hands in caution
, ,    - The Rex bends down, bumps the windshield with his nose
Just stays there, breathing heavily
In the distance, the flashlight goes on again
The Rex raises his head suddenly
Grant g rabs his walkie
(  ) Shut that flashlight, Tim
As the Rex heads off, a casual swipe of his tail  the side of the cruiser, throwing Grant and Gennaro across the inside of the car
- He lunges for the flashlight
Lex dodges him, keeps it lit
No, it's mine
Please,  need it
Tim looks up through the sun roof
The massive head of the Tyrannosaurus Rex appears
Tim watches, transfixed
Lex looks up
Irrational with terror, she aims her flashlight like a gun
Blasts him
Her flashlight beam cuts through the dark and rain - she sees the beast plainly for the first time and
The    bathes the Rex's face
He smashes his head down onto the Plexiglass bubble
It crunches, and falls into the car, crushing the children
Tim uses his feet to push it to the side
Above, the Rex displays is gaping maw, drooling toward the opening
- watches the Rex raise his mighty h ead again, above the kids' cruiser
- have a half-instant of relief
Then
The Rex butts his head against the cruiser
The Rex comes back down, tries to discover his prey inside the cruiser
Pushes his head close to the glass, looking
The dinosaur stands in front of the cruiser, his whole chest heaving, his forelimbs pawing the air
Timmy whispers to Lex
Are you ok
Be quiet and don't move
Lex barely nods and grabs Timmy's hand
The Tyrannosaur places his head next to the car
He begins to shove the cruiser with his head
The cruiser
The back window bursts, shards go flying
Inside, the kids are  back and forth,  against each other, and finally  against the top of the car as the cruiser
The whole world   - trunks of palm trees slide by, the ground above, the blazing eye of the rex, the tops of palm trees
The cruiser   on its side, the windows splat in the mud
Lex falls he lplessly against the side window and lies motionless
Timmy falls beside her, banging his head
He reaches for Lex
(softly) Lex
Lex
No movement from Lex
toys with the cruiser
Like a dog with its bone, the dinosaur pushes the cruiser along with his head
He pushes it past the picnic tables toward the ripped fence and the embankment
Each shove sends the children flying again
The cruiser is pushes closer and closer to the unprotected embankment
The cruiser slams to a stop completely upside-down
The -Rex steps right on the cruiser, crushing the roof against the ground
- the children crawl for their lives as the car crushes further down from above and a tidal wave of mud oozes in from the sides
- gnaws at the car, grabs a tire with his teeth,  It ruptures with a pitiful pop
The Rex grabs at the axle with his teeth, begins to drag the car back
THe kids, half-outside, are pulled with the car
- with a flare
The Rex is distracted
- the Rex as he
The flare gleams in his eyes
The Rex starts toward Grant
He tosses the flare over the half-standing part of the fence
The Rex lunges after the flare
has reached his limit
Terrorized, he leaps out and : Extinct animals should stay extinct
He bolts
The Rex sees him and starts after him,  by Grant, who stays frozen in place
Gennaro sprints for his life
He's not even a distant match for the - Rex jogging behind him
Gennaro dives into the
- he slams the door and shoves the trashcan against the door
Gennaro backs up into one of the stalls
,
Gennaro assumes a 'tuck' position
- The Rex smashes right through the steel-clad door
Pieces go flying
Gennaro hides amidst the wreckage as the Rex sniffs around
- to check on the kids
He reaches a hand underneath the flipped car, sitting in the mud
Lex's soft voice can be heard
() Dr
Grant
Grant fishes under, finds Lex's hand, drags her out
He quickly checks her for broken bones
Lex, are you okay
Timmy's unconscious, he won't move
Lex
Grant turns to see the Rex return
He squeezes Lex tight
The animal goes right past them, back to his toy - Tim's land cruiser
The Rex  a huge cry
Timmy awakens and sees the Rex above him
He
Lex, squeezed in Grant's arms, sees her imperiled brother
Timmy
The Tyrannosaur looks up,  across the upside-down cruiser, opens its huge jaws menacingly, all the time staring at Grant and Lex
- Timmy tries to unwedge himself
thin trickle of blood runs down his forehead
He's jammed between the crushed roof and the bent bench seat
He can't free himself
The Rex begins to  the cruiser toward Grant and Lex
They back up but they have very few feet left - they're almost at the embankment
But if they don't move, they'll by crushed by the oncoming car
Grant slings Lex onto his back
She grabs her hands around his neck and digs her feet into his sides
Grant begins to climb over the downed fence and into the embankment - it's a huge drop
Grant grabs a broken cable and lowers himself and Lex over the side of the embankment
Just in time as the Rex  the cruiser further
Now, the cruiser right on the edge, turning again on its side
Tim hangs halfway out of the car, unable to get out further
Grant, with Lex on his back, slides down the cable, rappelling down the embankment
, the car looms over them, rocking on the edge
Lex looks up and grabs Grant so tightly, she chokes him, unknowingly
Grant, eyes bulging, sees the danger from above
He pushes off the wall and swings them toward the next hanging cable
He reaches out and - -     just as - - the -Rex  and lowers her head, and gives a final shove
Timmy and the cruiser
Timmy
Grant and Lex swing out of the way as the cruiser sails past them
Lex , squeezing Grant's neck even tighter
They watch helplessly as the cruiser  off the wall and - into the top of a tree at the base of the wall
Grant and Lex stare down at the wreck in the tree
Timmy can't be seen
Grant, choking from Lex's grip, grabs her fingers
Let
go
please
The Rex  above
They look up
paws the air,  in frustration and  off, ' ,   - Nedry speeds along the rain-slick road, fish-tailing as he goes
- Nedry at the wheel
'  - the dark, wet road running alongside a ten-foot chain-link fence
Suddenly, a beast-like visage blur s across the road
Nedry swerves
The jeep skids
Nedry tries to over-steer, can't bring the careening jeep under control
The jeep crashes though the fence, bounces down a cement culvert, and dives into a raging gully
Nedry curses
He spins the wheel
The tires spin and spray
The jeep's hopelessly stuck in the gully
From Nedry's seat in the jeep, he cranes his head around, examining his situation
'  - On the opposite side of the gully, there is an equipment graveyard
By the titled jeep headlights, steely monsters all around can be seen - discarded earth movers, graders, and tractors
Nedry gets out of the jeep, grabs the winch from the jeep's back end
and wades over to an abandoned tractor
Shit
'm going to have to change clothes
He loops the winch around the tractor's base
Suddenly, he stops and looks around as he hears a gentle
He squints, looking at the strange steel graveyard lit by the bright beams of the jeep headli ghts
distinctive
Nedry looks up in fear
Nedry starts moving toward his jeep
Again, the
Nedry stops, looks right, looks left
in the trees
Nedry's head cocks
Looking through trees, lit by the strong beams, Nedry sees a  in the eerie mist
Now it's gone
Now it's back
It circles Nedry warily, hunting him
Nedry stares
hope this is one of them herbivores
Nedry scrambles the other way, full-tilt
Hop, hop, and the Spitter drops in front of Nedry from the other side
Nedry jumps back, lands on his butt
The Spitter zips in from the side -
Nedry doubles back, racing through the abandoned equipment, ducking and rolling under a cement mixer, spinning past a tree
He splashes down the embankment, trying to get to his jeep
He uses the winch line to steady himself again the raging current
He finally reaches the jeep, swings open the door - and, surging out of the water like a demonic apparition, is the
Nedry backs away, directly into the glare of the headlights
- the Spitter
It's plume opens, bright orange gills swell out like an umbrella around its neck
Something squirts beneath its jaws
big glob  Nedry on the arm
He brushes it off
Gross
- the Spitter's head
The jaws puff, the hood flares out, the neck snaps forward
And - it spits
This glob misses Nedry, splashes off the steaming headlight
- The Spitter's swollen poison sacs are inflated
They fire
This glob hits Nedry in the eyes
He
'm blind, 'm blind
He falls against the jeep, rubbing his eyes
The Spitter calmly hops to the embankment and watches the blinded Nedry weave drunkenly in the water
Nedry grabs onto the jeep and pulls himself along toward the driver's door
The Spitter stalks, watching him
Nedry pulls open the jeep door, thrusts his head in, slams it against the door frame
Now Nedry heaves his whole body into the jeep
The Spitter's long ostrich-like legs stretch and bend in an easy gait as it closes it on Nedry
Nedry sits behind the wheel, unseeing as the Spitter watches patiently turns his blind eyes that way
long beat
The Spitter leaps forward, the Nedry lets out an ear-splitting  and the car horn
' Timmy lies against a spidered side window, his head pressed against the door handle
He pushes himself up on one elbow, opens his eyes, and tries to focus
Rain has nearly stopped but a light drizzle hits him Timmy tries to straighten up, but he's too dizzy
He stops and hears and feels the whole car gently swaying back and forth
With a further effort, he raises his body so that he's standing with his feet on the window frame and looks out the broken roof
'  - Dense foliage, moving in the wind, hard to see through
An pen space and -  ,
/   - Tim's cruiser is lying on its side, stuck in the higher branches of a tree on the hillside
Oh shit
Timmy pulls his body up carefully, trying to get a better view
He grabs the steering wheel for support and it spins free in his hand
The cruiser slips a few inches down the tree
Timmy grabs the window frame and freezes
The car sways in the wind
The car slips a quick and rocky two feet
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit
Timmy hears something
He raises his head very carefully
Climbing up the tree, pulling himself on a nearby branch, is Dr
Grant
Timmy
Are you ok
Thank God you're here
Where's Lex
Below
She's fine
Let's get you down
Timmy nods
Grant peers throug h the broken roof of the cruiser, analyzing Timmy's predicament
He cranes his head back to examine how the cruiser is supported in the tree
Grant turns back to Timmy
Try the door you're leaning against
Nice and slow
Timmy places his weight on the two sides of the door frame and reaches between his legs, trying to open the door handle
Stuck
The cruiser drops another foot
Grant scrambles down a couple branches until he is even with the cruiser again
He motions for Timmy to hold still
Grant reaches across to the other car door and tries the outer door handle
This one opens and very slowly, he pushes open the door
Grant gingerly holds it half-open in mid-air
Crawl this way
Slowly
Carefully testing his weight with each step, Timmy lowers his body down
He pushes his legs out the door
They kick in the air and slowly come to rest on a lower branch
He lets himself down
Now he si ts on a branch, a few feet below the cruiser
The cruiser drops
Grant still hangs onto the door but now his footing on the branch is gone
His legs hang in space
The cruiser hangs precariously above Timmy
They're all twenty feet in the air
We're going to have to make a jump for it, Timmy
Okay
Timmy agrees
One, two, three, jump
Timmy lets go and
Grant follows
So does the cruiser
It's hurtling right at them
Timmy  against the wet tree-trunk and slides down
Branches against his face, his hands  against the trunk
Grant them
They scramble down as quick as they can
Timmy pulls his hands along the sap-sticky surface of the tree
Grant is stopped for a terrible instant - doubled over a branch, he flips himself over, dropping further
The cruiser jolts along, just a half-step behind them
Timmy dives the last six feet and  the wet earth with a
Grant next to him
Before they can roll out of the way, the cruiser keeps coming
Grant and Timmy look up at it
'  - The cruiser dropping, dropping toward them
And finally stops, just inches away, its dented grill grinning at them, its cracked headlight glaring
Oil drips down on Grant
He grabs Timmy, who grabs the night goggles
The two roll away
That second the cruiser  to the ground
Grant brushes himself off painfully, extends a hand to Timmy
Timmy slowly reaches up and pulls himself standing
Thanks, Dr
Grant
You owe me one
Grant turns around in a slow, fluid circle, checking out the forest
Where'd Lex go
They hear a faint
There's Lex
He runs
Grant follows
- Lex is curled up inside the drainpipe
Her baseball glove is in her mouth and she is rocking back and forth, rhythmically banging her head against the back of the pipe
She
- Grant and Timmy arrive at the drainpipe and stare in at Lex
Come on out now, Lex
Lex continues to band her head
Timmy tries again
It's your turn to wear the goggles, Lex
She shakes her head
He holds up her baseball but she doesn't look
found your baseball
You did
But she doesn't move
Grant speaks encouragingly
Cone on, Lex, it must be cold in there
And tight
Why don't you come out
'm afraid of the "animals"
The "animals" are gone
Where did it go
don't kno w but it's not here now
Are there any grownups out there
'm a grownup, Lex
Come on out
Gimmie you hand, come on, here you go
'm hungry
Me, too
We've got to get ourselves back to civilization
Regis slowly crawls out from between a couple large boulders
He looks around carefully
He peels mud off his face and rubs his neck
He touches his cheek
Regis' swollen cheek
He rubs it with his finger
Suddenly, he swats at his own mouth
He reaches in and pulls out a leech fat with blood
He hurls it to the ground, spitting
He grabs another off his arm and rips if off, leaving a bloody streak
He digs in his pants and pulls out another
He
As soon as he has done so, he knows he's made a mistake
He looks around frantically
Sees the Rex trot down the road toward him
Noooooo
- Grant and the kids crest the hill
Grant puts on the night goggles and adjusts the dial and looks toward Regis
The kids can't see that far
What's going on
Grant's green  - Regis and the Rex bounding after him
Regis hugs a tree, unmoving
Grant whispers to the kids
It's Regis and the Rex is after him
But it's okay
Regis knows the Rex can't see him
Evidently, he can only see move- ment
Regis'll be ok if he stays still
, the tyrannosaur walks away, disappears into the shadows
Regis waits another long moment and releases his tree
'  - The tyrannosaur leaps out of the shadows and knocks Regis to the ground
Regis jumps up and backs off
The animal knocks him right back down
Regis jumps up again and screams at the beast
You don't want to hurt Mr
Regis
Go away
Ed's your friend
Back off
watches him dance around
It goes toward him
This time its jaws are open
Regis  and in the middle, the scream cuts off
Grant lets the goggles fall off his face
They hit the ground with a The Rex turns toward Grant and the kids
Let's go
Grant grabs both the kids' hands and they begin to run
- Drops of water splat on a big fern
Light swims in the little puddle
In the sky above, clouds hurry by, intermittently revealing a half- obscured moon
The torn fence lies in a crumpled, twisted mess
The wheel of a Land Cruiser spins
little lizard runs in place on it
The  of the jeep's engine
It's Muldoon and Ellie
- a single cruiser lies on its side in the middle of the road
Oh, My God
Where's the other one
Before the cruiser stops, she j umps out
Muldoon shouts a whisper
Ellie
Ellie turns in the headlight beams
Muldoon tosses her a flashlight
Wait up
Muldoon skids to a stop, leaps out of the car
He catches up to Ellie
They share a frightened, apprehensive look
Muldoon gets on his knees and and touches a muddies area
-Rex tracks
Ellie looks out into the forest
Then they must be out there
They must be out there
know it
Perhaps
No
They're out there
've seen a lot of animal attacks in the bush
It's not as gory and horrifying to see as you'd think
No pools of blood or exposed bones
There is usually little or no evidence left behind
And if victims are small, a predator can kill by just shaking the little thing to death, eating it, and leave not so much as a button
definite  in the brush
Ellie jumps and
Muldoon puts his hand over her mouth and pushes her down
They both squat by the cruiser
Ellie swallows
Muldoon slowly gets up
Ellie follows
Their flashlights swing back and forth in the night
Twigs crack under their feet
Ellie hears the  at the edge of the forest
She shines her light into the brush
She catches her breath
Her hand shakes
Ellie flashes her beam right, left, up, down
Jumps
Something is coming at her, rolling at her
She gasps, steps back
It's too late
It's Gennaro
His limp body stops at her feet
She covers her mouth
Muldoon runs to her
Gennaro is face-down
Muldoon takes his pulse
Thank God
(beat)  We have to carry him
First  have to
He stands and removes his jacket
- Muldoon tears the jacket into long strips
He wraps Gennaro's wounds
He's losing a lot of blood
Help me
Muldoon and Ellie carry Gennaro to the jeep
They lay him on the back seat
Muldoon jumps in back with him
He keeps wrapping the wounds
Ellie starts the engine, looks back at him
Looks like you've been through this before
Muldoon looks up
told you 've seen big game attacks in Africa
She starts the engine
Right
Ellie skids out of there
- The dark room is lit with two outdoor torches
Light flickering on their faces, Arnold and Wu stare at the console screen
Why
Because Nedry messed with the code
That's why 'm checking it
But that could take weeks
What would be faster
Try keychecks
Arnold snaps his fingers, grabs Wu, That's true
Keychecks will give me a record of every button Nedry pushed
With a rapid series of keys, Arnold initiates "keystrokes"
The computer displays a short series of commands
Arnold runs his finger down the screen
Jesus, that's all he did all afternoon
He was just dicking around, maybe waiting to get his nerve up
Wu points to a line
It reads:  - What's that
Some sort of object
Let's see if we can trace it
Arnold types  -
Nothing
He tries  -
Still nothing
-
The screen fills with data
Each line defines another security system that has been shut off: /    -   /   - /, etc
What's it mean
It wasn't a bug
It was a trap door that fat bastard left for himself
When he hit -
, it initiates a set of commands that turned the whole goddamn park off
Hammond was right about him
If  did that 'd leave a way to turn it back on
In case  had to
'm sure Nedry did
You're find it
Arnold nods grimly
- Hammond sits quietly in the deserted cafeteria, calmly spooning ice cream into his mouth
This room is lit by dozens of candles
Muldoon walks in, stares at Hammond in the semi-darkness
We found Gennaro
He'd badly injured
Harding's tending to him in your quarters
He'll be all right if we can radio for help
Your grandchildren and Grant are somewhere in the park believe they're alive but  don't know where they are
'm sure you'll find them
certainly hope so
'm sure we will
After all,  keep telling everyone, this park is made for children
Just so you understand that they're missing, sir
Missing
Of course  know they're missing
You just said that
Look, Bob, let's not get carried away
We've had a little breakdown from the storm or whatever, and as a result we've had a regrettable, unfortunate accident
And that's all that happened
We're dealing with it
Arnold will get the computers cleaned up, and the radio and phone lines open
You'll find those kids and my good friend, Dr
Grant
'm sure they'll want some of this ice cream
It's very good
'  - Dark
Ellie helps Harding get Gennaro comfortable on Hammond's couch
Blood from Gennaro's injuries stain the rich leather
Gennaro babbles
That Rex didn't even give me his full attention
That's what hurts
was just an afterthought
gave him my full attention
He's had a lot of morphine
(sings) Not enough
need to find Wu
have to run a few tests in his lab
He's probably in the control room, get- ting in the way while Arnold tries to put things together
As Ellie leaves, Genna ro is singing a shanty in his morphine stupor
Yo ho, 'll close this place down
- The ship is tossed around on a stormy sea
: - The eggs are tossed around in the womb of the incubator
The swell settles but the rocking of one egg doesn't stop
The egg cracks, a silvery line runs down its side
- Somewhere in the dark park, laced by low fog, Grant, Timmy and Lex walk
'm tired
You're too big to be carried
But 'm tired-tired
Okay, Lex
Grant picks her up
Oof
You're heavy
The full moon is blurred by drifting clouds
Their blunted shadows lead the three across an open field toward dark woods beyond Grant is lost is thought, trying to decide where to go
think we're still in his paddock
Lex's heavy eyes open
Her eyes grow big
She taps Grant's shoulder
What
Don't you see
Don't you see
What
The fence
(squinting) No
Oh  do, right there
Lex lets herself slide off Grant and runs into the woods
Timmy follows
Grant follows, squinting
Finally, he sees
big smile
The kids look up at a twelve foot high electric fence
Timmy gulps
Timmy's scared of heights
Timmy spins in fury
Shut up
Lex and Timmy stare at each other
No fighting - now
They relax
Okay with the fence, Timmy
Timmy eyes it
Nods hesitantly
They start to climb
Lex climbs easily
(mumbles quietly) 'Fraid of heights
Timmy climbs tentatively
dinosaur  in the distance
- Timmy's foot loses its grip
Timmy hangs for a moment, held only by his straining hands
All three stop
Wait
Timmy regains his balance
Slowly, they proceed up and over
On the other side, Grant looks around
More high trees
Beyond a field
herbivore grazing area
Excellent
Grant starts to walk toward it
Timmy stops
Lets sits on a tree root
We gonna walk all night
Grant looks at his watch
Twelve hours before that ship reaches the mainland
We need sleep
True, and Grant's thinking the same thing
He looks aro und, surveying the misty forest
He looks straight up into the beautiful, tall trees that ring the wide-open grassy meadow
Up there
Climb
Again
can't climb again
Grant smiles
Sure you can
Grant checks out and rejects tree after tree
Near the meadow he finds it
good, basic climbing tree
Grant helps Lex get comfortable on his lap
Timmy tucks himself in between Grant's outstretched legs
Grant looks out
Back to kids
Timmy and Lex are already snoring
Lex turns and hugs Grant close to her
She murmurs in her sleep
Grant starts to pat her shoulder when Timmy, without waking, reaches to her and strokes her hair
(mumbles) It's ok, Lex
Everything's gonna be okay
: - amoeba-like creatures swimming in a pool
,  - Ellie lifts her head away from the powerful microscope
The dark room is lit by flashlight
Battery packs power the microscope
Wu paces the room, regarding his eggs with dismay
Sitting on their long tables with no moving wands above them - no thermal sensors
What is taking Arnold so long
This room is too cold
My eggs will be damaged
Ellie swings the lens to Wu
Not so interested but peers in politely
No sign of those berries
Really interesting
There are indications of a similar virus in every tissue sample
But it's not in the ground
Could  look at some of the discarded embryos
Wu reluctantly agrees
He opens a cabinet and brings her samples
'm sure you'll find your virus
or a similar one
All animals carry many viruses in a dormant condition
It's almost impossible to say with certainty which are the same strains
Ellie begins a test on a sample
She adds a reagent and marks up a slide
As she works: And yet from what Harding tells me, many of you animals have similar symptoms - besides the microvesicles, a lack of hunger, loss of reproductive urges, sores in the mouth and gums
Wu waves his arms
What the hell does Harding know
He's a veterinarian, not a pathologist
- Arnold pushes his chair away from his console and claps his hands as Muldoon walks in
Muldoon asks hopefully
What is it
Arnold points to the screen
That's it
Muldoon comes closer
That's what
found the command to restore the original code
It resets the linked parameters
The fences and the power
Right
And it does something else
It erases the code lines that refer to it
It destroys all evidence it was ever there
Nedry could steal the eggs, get back and reset the whole show
No one would ever miss him
Watch this
Arnold types in a command
The screen flickers and changes
Arnold and Muldoon look out the window as lights come on through out the park
Hot damn
Are the fences back on
You bet they are
It will take a few seconds to get up to full power, because we've got fift y miles of fence out there, and the generator has to feed the capacitors along the way
But in a half a minute we'll be back in business
Arnold points to the transparent map of the park
On it, bright red lines snake out, moving throughout the park, as electricity surges through the fences
Motion sensors
Got them too
It will be a few minutes while the computer counts
Then 'll tell you where Grant and the kids are and you can go and get them
But every- thing's working
Half past ten and we've got the whole thing back up and running
Muldoon picks up a phone, shakes his head
Just hiss
- Grant snores
mosquito buzzes around him
He waves him away and continues to sleep
In the distance, a tiny
Below the towering tree, across the ield, a sensor beeps, it's green light blinks, and the beeping stops
, the branches sway
Grant and the kids sleep on
- The glowing, glass map
Arnold and Muldoon stare at it
What is taking so damn long
Where are they
There's a lot of extraneous movement out there
Branches blowing, birds, back- ground movement
It may take, ah, okay, count's finished
Muldoon looks at Arnold anxiously
Arnold looks down
Hmmmm
don't see them
Maybe they're out of range of a sensor
Shit
don't know where they are wish  could go out there   But  haven't got anything to use on the Rex
My rocket launcher's in the jeep Nedry stole
And going out with a big gun in the dark would be suicide ,  - Brightly lit again
Ellie performs tests with a centrifuge
She looks at Wu, who sits across from her in a high stool, stifling a yawn
Why don't you get some sleep, Dr
Wu
'm just going to run a couple more tests and then 'm going to turn in myself
Wu doesn't need to be told twice
He climbs off his stool
No point in everyone being exhausted
He starts to leave
He comes back and speaks consolingly at Ellie
'm sure Muldoon will find Dr
Grant as soon as there is light
Ellie appreciates his effort, nods seriously, goes back to work
: - Beautiful dark ocean
The sky is a rich blue
morning star fades as the sky lightens
The Anne  is a small dot on the massive ocean
, Eggs sit in the incubator
hand sprays them with foam
Leaves
the eggs as the foam disperses
More cracks
One egg jumps with a bolt from within
It settles
Jumps again
: - the primordial beauty of Isla Nublar at dawn
'  - Muldoon drives out into the park in Harding's jeep travel with him
Each carries a rifle
'  - on Grant, Lex and Timmy still sleeping in the tree large shadow falls on their quiet faces
Lex opens an eye
She
Grant and Timmy wake up with a start
-           right into the huge face of  - , a gigantic dinosaur with cow eyes
Its head moves up through the canopy of the trees
Then the head swoops way down below
And returns to Grant's level and stares at his shoe
The hadrosaur tastes Grant's shoe
The kids press tightly into Grant
He gonna eat us
don't think so
She's a
herbivore
The hadrosaur
Lex covers her ears
Grant smiles and motions to Lex
He picks a big fruit off the tree and tosses it into the hadrosaur's mouth
He feeds it again
Lex and Timmy toss a few
The hadrosaur's big head swoops way down, momentarily gone
When she returns, all three quickly gather fruits and throw them into her mouth
The hadrosaur pulls back with her giant mouthful of fruit
She pulls further and further back and then her huge head turns and moves down
Grant, Lex and Timmy strain to see through the branches
- The hadrosaur is feeding four scampering, baby hadrosaurs
Letting the fruit tumble from her mouth into theirs
Lex : Come here, babies
Get your b reakfast
The babies run to the base of the tree
The kids toss fruits right down to them
Lex and Timmy climb lower to feed them right from their hands
Grant and the mother hadrosaur stare at each other
She sniffs his foot
He moves closer, straddling a branch
He lifts up her lip and examines her gums
- a ripped piece of fence stuck in her teeth
Grant yanks it out
He lets it drop to the ground
He take a large leaf and rubs her teeth with it
- her mouth as Grant's hand touches the side of her tongue
He sees little tiny bumps
The hadrosaur lets out a low groan
Grant is puzzled, rubs harder
Like the trike
Maybe it's not the stones
She pulls her mouth away
The baby hadrosaurs turn to the honking adult
She is leaving quickly
They follow quickly behind her
The small herd leaves, casually trampling trees as they go
,  - Muldoon and workers drive rapidly in the jeep
Suddenly, Muldoon slams on the brakes
'  -    (), small chicken- sized scavenging dinosaurs, scramble across the road
Where the hell are they going
Muldoon watches them cross
He thinks it over
Spins the wheel and follows them off the road
Let's see what's up
,  - Timmy bravely jumps from a very low branch
He smiles and looks at Grant, who's already on the ground
Grant looks off in the distance
Tim,  think there's a motion sensor across the field and down there
Where's Lex
-  Lex kneels
She holds a big fruit and calls: 'mere boy, c'mere
She tosses the fruit
- the fruit rolling away
Lex gets up and follows the rolling fruit
She picks it up
It's very, very good
She tosses it again
'mere boy, c'mere
Lex's eyes scan the bushes, then stop
She smiles
'  - hidden in the brush, a baby triceratops' eye peeks at Lex
Lex pushes the fruit closer
The   comes out of the brush, squeaking as it goes
It nibbles the fruit
Lex rolls another
- They look around
Timmy stops, mouth open, : Dr
Grant, Dr
Grant, look
Grant turns, looks
He's astonished by when he sees
- a row of shrubs, which Lex seems to soar above
As a break in the shrubs, it's clear that she's riding the baby triceratops
Loving it
Whoa
With a whoop, Grant and Timmy chase after Lex on her triceratops
Lex rides through low brush, ducking down as she goes
Then beneath the tall trees as she enters the forest
She crosses a stream on a log ridge
Light showers down through the branches
The water shimmers
Lex in is paradise
Behind her, Grant and Timmy shout for her to stop
She waves, kicks the triceratops like it's a horse and : Giddyup
The trike takes off, in a rush
It trips over a fallen tree, downed by the storm
The trike takes a spill and Lex goes flying
Whoa
Take is easy
She passes over the trike's head, in the air, and  as she flies: can't swim
She  into the stream
Timmy, first to arrive on the scene, dives in heroically
He comes up sheepish and muddy - and sees Lex standing in a foot of water
The baby dinosaur rolls to a stop, mowing down a patch of saplings as she goes
It stands up, dizzy and out of breath
Timmy wipes mud off himself
Grant helps the kids out of the water
The baby triceratops follows them
Grant yells to the baby trike
Go home now
Home to Freda
Oh, let him stay
He likes me to ride him
He could carry me instead of you, Dr
Grant
Please, let him stay, Grant shakes his head, Go
Go away
Go
Get out of here
The trike whimpers and watches the three of them walk on
Lex is heartbroken
Will  ever play with him again
Grant looks across the field, abundantly beautiful in the early morning
He has to keep them going
He points across the field
We gotta get to that motion detector
It's still a ways
Lex looks behind her
In the distance, more hadrosaurs join the herd eating from the tall trees
Some cool off in a shallow lagoon
They drink, lowering their flat heads, meeting their own reflections in the still water
When they look up again, their heads swivel
At the water's edge, a baby hadrosaur ventures out, squeaks, and scrambles back while the adults watch indulgently
,  - Muldoon and his workers now follow the compys on foot
The compys trail off in different directions
Muldoon and his workers break apart to track the different groups
follows his party of compys
He looks ahead and sees a small group stopped ahead
Their heads are bent to the ground
has reached another cluster of compys
Kicking, he scatters them
Muldoon's tracking leads him to the equipment graveyard where Nedry was lost
He sees his stolen red jeep
He rushes to it
On the passenger side still sits the rocket launcher
He opens the door to retrieve it
When he leans in, his eye catches the tilted side-view mirror
The image is of many compys bent over the ground
He comes around,
found Nedry
In the distance, the call is
() found him
() Found him
'  - Hammond peeks in the door and sees Gennaro, heavily bandaged, dozing on the couch
Gennaro's eyes flutter and Hammond enters and smiles
He, Donald
Glad you're awake
hope you're not going to take this little mishap you had and hold it against my park
It would be terrible if the finishing funds were in any way held up
Gennaro just grins and shakes his head
He's very high on morphine
He wants to speak but Hammond keeps talking
After each sentence, Gennaro enthusiastically agrees with a nod
You really shouldn't have gotten out of the vehicle
The park is actually quite safe
disenchanted worker sabotaged some equipment
Arnold, Muldoon, and Wu, all loyal employees, are righting damage as we speak
Oh good, 'cause  love the park
It's more than we ever dreamed
Those brachiosaurs are so big
And those Spitters - (he spits) - incredible
only have one problem
Aren't we going to have pterodactyls
(he frowns, smacks his forehead) Oh, they'd fly away
Gennaro looks off, watching the imaginary pterodactyls fly away
Hammond takes out a bag
Take a look at these, Donald
Have you seen these
These are great
Hammond dumps things out of the bag
They are souvenirs of the park
Wind-up toys
Spitter umbrellas
Gennaro is thrilled
got some great t-shirts
Dinosaur bingo, hey
Hammond leans closer
Wu says he can make a foot high triceratops
We'll sell pets as living souvenirs
Bio-engineered to eat only food we sell, of course
Gennaro can't take it
Great idea
He high-fives Hammond repeatedly
Harding enters and gently taps Hammond on the shoulder
You'll have to bear with him, Mr
Hammond
He's doped to infinity and back
,  - Sunlight pours through the windows
Ellie sits with her head in hands
She looks around and wanders the lab
Notices a drawer, slides it open
-rays
She shuffles through, finds some marked:
Ellie snaps on a viewing light at her lab station
She studies the - ray
She looks up in surprise
Studies it again
The viewing light is snapped off
Ellie looks again
Wu stands there
Who gave you permission - Ellie attacks back
'm here to investigate this park
And there's plenty you haven't told me
That's absurd
These bones aren't fully formed
You're qualified to interpret x-rays of living dinosaurs
doubt it
It took me many months to learn
'll tell you something else, Freda isn't an adult, just a huge juvenile
You're making a lot of assumptions here
Right
What the hell is going on, Wu
They stare at each other in the bright sunlight
() Growth hormones
The two swing around
Hammond stands in the sharp shadows of the room
She didn't have a right to explore my lab
Let's not argue, Wu, we have a serious problem
(to Ellie) These animals don't last
There is a regularity, a predictability about when they die
It's always
very young
We don't know why
Given time, 'm sure Wu will figure it out
It's just
Just some adjustment in the code is required
But there are deadlines
The park opens next summer
And it requires full-grown specimens
So Wu uses growth hormones to achieve the desired size in a short amount of time
But they all keep dying and we don't know how to stop it
Ellie and Wu stare at Hammond
He steps forward
The light is so hot behind him that his appearance is like an apparition
was going to tell you all this myself, Dr
Sattler, after Gennaro stopped breathing down my neck
That's why wanted you and Dr
Grant here on my island - you have to help me keep the dinosaurs alive
Won't you please help me
: , the sun momentarily burns through the clouds - '  - Ellie enters
On the couch, Gennaro snores lightly
In a chair nearby Harding sleeps, a roll of gauze grasped in his hands
Ellie walks over to the large model of the park that Hammond revealed
She looks at the miniature dinosaurs that sit in different sectors of the park
She picks up the plastic Rex, examines it, drops it back in
She brushes by Harding and studies Gennaro's pasty, sleeping face
Air blows in and out of his dry lips
She examines the gauze wrapped around his wounded leg
It seeps with blood
- Arnold works at his console
Hammond and Wu lean over his shoulder
Ellie bursts in, very agitated
Hammond looks up
Gennaro's losing a lot of blood
He needs transfusions
We gotta get a rescue helicopter
Arnold, what's with the phones
Ah hell
just can't find it
He sips his coffee and stares bleary-eyed at the screen
Find what
Nedry jammed all the communication lines
He inserted some command, a lockout into the program code
can't find it, because  gave that restore command and it erased part of the program listings
So
Just reset - shut the system down and you'll clear the memory
Everything will be in the normal wakeup mode
Shut the system down
And reset
've never done that before
And 'm reluctant to do it
Maybe it's tr ue, all systems will come on, but maybe they won't
Look, there is a sick man here who needs medical attention or he'll die
Four people are out there, missing in your park
We need search teams
We have to have a phone or radio
Arnold still hesitates
Well
Well, it's just that the safety systems don't function with the computer shut down and - Ellie boils over
- turn the goddamn safety systems off
Can't you get it through your head that we have no choice
Arnold looks at Hammond, who now stares out into the park
Without turning, Hammond nods his consent
Okay
Arnold gets up and goes to the main panel
He opens the doors and uncovers the metal swing-latches over the safety switches
He pops them off, one after another
You asked for it
And you got it
He throws the master switch
The control room goes black
All monitors go black
Arnold, Wu and Ellie stand in the dark
How long do we have to wait
Thirty seconds
- Grant and kids walk through a clearing
Lex stops
What is it
hear something
Come on
Timmy looks around
The morning is still and peaceful
Branches are motionless
Only a little bird jumps from one branch to another
Hear it now
You're hearing things
Come on, we gotta get back and warn them about the boat
Lex hesitates but doesn't want to be left behind
She runs betw een Grant and Timmy
Then they all hear it
It comes from the herd of duck bills behind them
First the honking of a single animal, then another animal joins in, then another and another, until the whole herd has taken up the honking cry
What's going on
They're agitated
The duckbills twist and turn
They hurry out of the water, circling the young ones to protect them
With a , the -Rex bursts from the trees, just a hundred yards away straight toward the hadrosaurs
told you  heard something
The earth
low rumble is heard and felt as the hadrosaurs begin to run  in a parallel direction to the course of Grant and the kids
Outta the way, kids
Run
Grant grabs Lex, lifting her bodily off the ground, and carries her like a football
Timmy runs beside them
Hadrosaurs run alongside of them
Grant hears the crashing of trees
He takes a glance over his shoulder
'  - a flurry of flamingos takes flight and spooks the herd into changing direction
The hadrosaurs swerve and charge right into the path of Grant, Lex and Timmy
They all
- The quiet black room
Hammond stands by the big window
His pensive presence affects all in the room
Arnold looks at his illuminated watch
Memory should be cleared by now
He pushes the main switch back on
Nothing on
Damn
Arnold pushes the switch off and then on again
Still nothing
He glances at Hammond's back
Sweat forms on his brow
What's wrong
Oh hell
have to turn the safety switches back on before  restart the power
Arnold flips on three safeties, and covers them again with latch covers
Holding his breath, he turns on the main power switch
First, there is the computer beep
Ellie jumps
Then relaxes
The lights come on
The screens hum
Hammond's shoulder twitches slightly
Thank God
The room is jubilant
Hugs and cheers
Ellie picks up a phone
Arnold
They're still not working
No, it sounds dead but after a reset, all system modules have to be brought on line manually
Arnold quickly goes back to work at his console
Hammond turns
(to Hammond) Arnold's about to get the phones up
Arnold pushes the chair back
Okay, we're up again
Ellie grabs the phone back up
No we're not
Phones still dead
Arnold swings her way
Can't be - My God, look at this, Arnold
Hammond points to the transparent map
tight cluster of dots by the lagoon move in a coordinated way
Moving fast, in a kind of swirl
What's happening
(tonelessly) The duckbills
My good God
What
It's the Rex
They've stampeded
-      - Grant and kids run for their lives
Behind them the duckbills charge with surprising speed
Their enormous bodies charge in a tight group, kicking up dirt, rocks, whole trees as they thunder along
- a charging duckbill as he , eyes wild with fear
horrible  of the -Rex sends a duckbill infant squealing and struggling to stay out from underfoot
-  huge adult foot almost tramples the infant
Frightened and confused the infant scampers even deeper into the maelstrom
The frenzied herd raises a great cloud of yellow dust
run wildly
The stampede is very close behind Grant and the kid's faces are covered with sweat and dust
Another deafening  of the -Rex
Grant leads them toward a rocky outcrop with a stand of big conifers
The animals continue to close
- the running feet of the stampeding animals
The ground every time it is struck by the huge feet
scramble onto the rocks
They frantically tuck in between big boulders as the the herd reaches them
Lex shields her dusty face with her hands as she wedges deeper between the rocks
Grant pushes her down deeper and looks up from between the rocks
'  - the immense legs of the first hadrosaur to pass
Another slams its big tail against the rocks, leaving a splash of hot blood
Stampeding legs send clods of dirt fl ying in the air
Above, even the birds are running
Disoriented, they fly frantically along
are enveloped in dust
Just shadows of huge bodies with giant limbs
of pain as animals wheel and circle
boulder is dislodged and it rolls toward Timmy
He dives out of his rocky hiding place
The boulder continues on toward Grant and Lex
They dive after Timmy
The group buries itself anew in a group of thick roots tangled amidst smaller rocks
The boulder continues on, the rocky enclave they have just left
Grant and the kids huddle and watch the last under-bellies oscillate above them
The stampede goes past
They lie there, unable to move
They watch the herd trample on
- The Rex's foot as it crushes a motion sensor
Lex
Grant and Timmy cover her mouth
The -Rex hunts down the herd
He targets his prey
young hadrosaur
As the hadrosaur gallops into the shadowy treeline, the Rex lunges fiercely
The Rex and its victim are enveloped in dust
Grant holds Lex close
She watches the terrible cloud with a quiet horror
Timmy makes the first move to leave
Let's go
Now
The herd's remainder gallops off into the safety of the deep jungle
Grant, Lex and Timmy run in the opposite direction
- Hammond, Arnold, Wu, and Ellie watch the monitor as the dust slowly clears
Hadrosaurs scatter
Now the Rex is calm and quiet
, he gnaws on something
No
Oh no
He make a kill
He killed one of my animals
Where's Muldoon
'm sorry, Mr
Hammond
My animals
My animals
Muldoon enters, limping in
Hammond is very upset
Where have you been
My Rex killed a hadrosaur
You should be out there, doing something
just came to tell you - you're minus one computer expert
,  - The water rushes a few hundred yards away
Grant and the kids have finally rested enough
Grant nods to Timmy
We'll walk by the river
That leads back to the Visitor's center
Not me
'm not walking anymore
Come on Lex, 'll carry you
Nope
Too scared
Timmy looks up at Grant
Grant kneels down by Lex
Lex embraces Grant
You ready
She wipes her tears
Can we go on the raft
Then we don't have to walk so close to the animals
What raft
Lex points to a low concrete maintenance building with bars
It is twenty yards away
Where  found Freda's baby
Grant start to stand
He's thinking
It's still mid-morning
bet we have at least ten miles to go
If we take the raft along the river, we can make much faster progress
Let's do it
- Grant stumbles deep in the gloomy recesses of the building
He pushes past drums of herbicide, tree-pruning equipment, spare tires, coils of cyclone fencing, huge fertilizer bags, stacks of ceramic insulators, empty motor-oil cans, work-lights and cables
Lex,  don't see any raft
Timmy looks at Lex
Where is it
Lex doesn't know
Keep going
Grant keeps pushing through bags of cement, lengths of copper pipe, piles of green mesh
Two plastic oars hang on the concrete wall
Bullseye
Timmy is reliev ed
Lex smiles
Told you
Grant grabs them
Looks around, still - No raft
Where did you see it, Lex
Actually,  never really saw one
Just assumed
Assumed
She nods
Grant and Timmy resume looking
- Lex walks below a barred window
Slats of light fall on her back
She sees a dark closet door ajar
She brushes the handle
It swings opens and two bright orange life preservers fall on her, knocking her to the ground
, frantically pushing the life preservers off
Grant's head pops up
Timmy runs to her side
She is wrestling irrationally with the life preservers
Timmy drops to the ground
Lex
Lex
You're okay, you're okay
Lex is overcome with fear
Timmy grabs a preservers and puts it on
Look, Lex
Look
She looks at him, realizes, and bursts out laughing
Timmy laughs with her
Grant joins them
He sits on a box and laughs
'm afraid there's no raft
Grant gets up
He reaches for the hands of the kids
Timmy sees it - the box Grant sat on is labeled:
Timmy smiles
'  - Grant pulls a cord
With a  , the rubber begins to expand uncontrollably, jerking and jumping like a wild marionette
Then, with a whopping -
it pops fully open on the deck: a large bright yellow rubber raft
Timmy and Lex climb in, wearing the life preservers
Grant gets in and pushes off with his oars
The small disturbance causes the cicadas to
The raft drifts out into the lagoon
Grant fixes his oars into the oarlocks
Grant surveys the river
Looks pretty calm
The raft stops moving
They are aground
Lex looks overboard
She reaches in about elbow deep
Grant stands and puts the oars in the water
He pushes with all his might
There is a long scraping sound of the raft against the mud floor
But it moves
And the raft goes into deep enough water
general sigh of relief as they gently float downstream
- Grant energetically works the oars
- Lex lets her hand trail in the water
'll row, Dr
Grant
No
But he's sweating and takes a moment to rest
Lex looks down at her hand in the water
It still trails
Hey, we're still moving
Grant looks into the water
She's right
There's a current
Grant lays back against the rubber gunwales, closes his eyes
The two kids look at him
You can't sleep
(eyes closed) 'm not sl eeping
yet
'll do it
Lex picks up the oars and begins
We gotta warn them about the boat
Grant opens one eye and looks up at the sun in the sky
He sighs and takes up the oars again
He rows powerfully with the current
- Current picks up speed
The water begins to rush and
Cool
White foam crashes on the raft and sprays the kids
They burst out laughing
Grant smiles at them, but there is concern in his eyes
- Now the raft is really racing
The kids hold on tightly as the raft is rocked
White water crashed over, drenching the kids
When Grant takes a moment to look, he is soaked by a huge wave
The raft tosses right and left
Timmy holds the rubber grips
He's yanked to one side
He's knocked to the raft floor
Quickly gets his grip again
to Grant
Thought is looked calm
Guess  was wrong
Grant looks ahead
The river widens
The raft really starts to fly
Lex, gripping very tightly, looks out
Water sprays her again and again
Her face is serious
can't swim
Grant grabs the raft's tie line and pulls it out of its rubber rings
He lashes it around Lex and Timmy
Then he ties it around one of the rubber grips
Hold on real tight
They go flying down the river
The  deafens
The raft lifts out of the water
And crashes down, rocking every way
Jagged rocks appear
Grant uses his paddle as a club to push off the rocks and the rushing shoreline
The kids duck from sudden overhanging trees
Grant looks ahead
He blanches
- the surging edge of a tumultuous waterfall
They're almost there
At the huge waterfall, water rushes violently, heaving over the magnificent precipice
Timmy tries to tighten ex's vest but is thrown back down
He : Hold my hand
Hold my hand when we go
The raft spins in the rushing water
Everyone is thrown around
The rope holding the kids to the raft tautens
The oars are wrestled out of Grant's hands and go flying through the air, spilling over the edge
At the last moment, Grant spots a tree branch arching over the cascade
With all his might, he stands and holds his balance long enough
to let his hands smash into the overhanging branch
They stop right at the waterfall's edge
Grant struggles mightily to hold onto the branch
But the water keeps rushing
His strength ebbs
Don't let go
Grant's veins pop out in his arms
His hands start to slip off the wet tree bark
Lex watches his hands slowly lose their grip
The rubber raft jumps and leaps below him
Water pours into the raft
Lex tries fruitlessly to let it out
Timmy holds down Grant's feet
You can do it
'm trying
'm trying
Ooooo
His hands slipping, slipping
No
: - The -Rex, face down in the mud
- Arnold, Wu, Muldoon, and Ellie stare raptly at the monitor
Son-of-a-bitch
He's taking a nap
Hasn't been this well fed
ever
Hammond is above, in his throne
He calls down: Could he drown in that position
That's a very valuable animal
know it's a valuable animal
Muldoon takes a step up toward Hammond's throne and the two argue quietly back and forth
In the foreground, Wu calls Arnold over
What's that, John
Wu points to the screen behind Arnold's head
In the upper right-hand corner, it blinks a yellow warning:
Ellie regards it
You running on auxiliary power
'm not
Looks like you are
Can't be
Print the system status log
Arnold nods and rapidly strikes keys
In the corner, a printer whirs to life
Moments later, it spins out a single page
Arnold tears it off
Ellie continues to stare at the screen
It now flashes red: An alarm klaxon
Hammond holds his ears against the noise
He stands up
The room lights begin to
They're reflected in Hammond's eyes
Hammond  above the chaos
What the hell is going on
Onscreen, numbers begin to count backward from ten
Hammond lurches
At zero, the lights go off, the monitors, even the computer
Just the alarms keep screaming
You're ruining my ordered, precise park
Arnold ignores him, keeps pressing buttons
Hammond rushes toward Arnold
Arnold looks over his shoulder in surprise
Hammond
Fix my park, Arnold
Fix it
Arnold crosses his hands in front of his face, blocking Hammond's attack
Hammond grabs Arnold's wrists and the two twirl to the ground
Breathing heavily, Hammond clutches his hand to his own chest
Arnold stands up, brushes off
He puts himself together, looks at Hammond
He  over the siren: know it's hard,  know it's hard, but 'm going to put it all back together for you -  promise
will - Grant still clings to the overhanging branch, holding the raft from toppling over the crashing waterfall
Lex and Timmy hold onto his legs
The  of the water diminishes
And the flow subsides from a raging current to a rolling river
And then to a gentle stream
trickle
Nothing
Grant slowly relaxes, lets go
So do the children
Around the raft, the water level begins to drain
Gradually, Grant and the kids are left in the raft sitting in just a few puddles of water
Around them, various pumps and other equipment is exposed where it was once covered by rushing white water
The waterfall stopped
Waterfalls aren't supposed to stop
think they cut the power
Hey - He points and the three of them look over the edge where the waterfall once poured
There's a shimmering rainbow and beyond that, in the mist is the visitor's center
Well, there's our pot of gold
Let's go, kids
They grab his hands and clamber out of the raft, running toward shore
- Muldoon pulls open the blinds and the hot sun filters in, so the room is alternate patches of bright and dark
In a hot corner, Ellie squats over a prostate Hammond, mopping his brow with a cool cloth
He murmurs, only barely intelligible
Told him, fix my park, fix my park
Wu brings the printout to Arnold
The printout is a chronological rendering of control room events since the restart
It is clear they have been running on auxiliary power
Wu yells above the alarm: You shut down as six thirty-four this morning, and when you started back up, it was with auxiliary power
Jesus
The auxiliary generator fires up first and then that's used to start the main generator because it needs a heavy charge
The main generator has to be manually reset
Outside
In the generator building
Arnold nods
Muldoon points to a line in the printout: 06:35:22   :   ()   - This doesn't mean the fences have been off since six-thirty, does it
Arnold grabs the paper, looks at it, slams it down
Backup power doesn't generate enough amperage to power the electrified fences, so they were automatically kept off
That's also why we had no phones or radio
All of the fences
Yes
Including the velociraptor mesh
(disgusted, exhausted) Yes, yes, yes
In the corner, Hammond lifts his head and Ellie gently helps him to a sitting position
Do you mean those raptor s could be loose
'm afraid so
No, no way
Last time, it took 'em two days to chew through that mesh
But give 'em enough time, they'll get out
We better get that power on now
Regardless, check the pit
Make sure there' five of them there
'  - Muldoon and Arnold run across the lawn
Muldoon carries his rocket launcher at a ready position
In the distance, the alarm still , lights  a continued warning
They reach the maintenance building where the generator is housed
Its familiar him has been replaced by its own alarms
The closer they approach, the louder and brighter these alarms are
Grey steam pours out of the vents of the building, obscuring everything
What's that steam coming out of my generator room
Relax, it's just refrigerated air
There's a leaky cooling pipe
fixed it a couple times before but the original installation was at too sharp an angle
Arnold accepts this
He is about to enter when Muldoon instructs him
Just go and turn on your generator, then get right back to the control room
Arnold lights a cigarette and disappears into the steam-shrouded door
- Muldoon inspects an extremely discouraging sight
The thick mesh that covered the pit has been chewed through and ripped open
With heavy gun in one hand, Muldoon shines his flashlight into the pit
It's empty
Muldoon looks up
'  - the dense forest surrounding the Visitor's Center
Muldoon examines the ground
He locates the raptor prints leading away Muldoon breaks into a run
/    - Muldoon comes back to the generator room still runnin g full-tilt
He kicks open the door
Steam pours out
Standing in the thick steam, Muldoon yells for Arnold
No answer
He steps in the doorway and shines his flashlight around
'  - Only the dark abstract shapes of rakes and coiled ropes and small machinery can be seen in the steam
Muldoon yells again
No answer at all
Muldoon curses and leaves
As soon as Muldoon is gone, there is movement
Even above the sirens, an animalistic breathing, grunting can be heard
Obscured by steam and flashing lights, a reptilian claw clutches a shadow
pack of cigarettes falls to the ground, spilling out on the floor
- Muldoon enters and confronts Hammond, Ellie, and Wu, Raptors chewed their way out
All five are out there
Arnold's not with you
Muldoon looks around grimly
He shakes his head
was hoping he was ba ck here already
Hammond takes charge
This is why my quarters were specially fortified
To assist in an emergency just like this one
Let's go
Muldoon, round up the workers
They'll go with us too
Muldoon stares at Hammond, then drops it
They prepare to go
Wait
What about Arnold
,  - Grant and the kids come over the hill
Timmy sees the big fence and the Visitor's Center close behind
We're home
Lex and Grant happily run down the hill
- Grant and the kids stand in the long shadows of the electric fence
This huge fence is much higher than what Timmy has had to climb
Grant turns to him apologetically
Sorry, Tim
We gotta climb up
That's all right, Dr
Grant
You owe me one
'  - Wu stands at the open sliding gate of the perimeter fence surrounding Hammond's quarters
Next to him is Ellie
Behind both of them, launcher at the ready, is Muldoon
Watching from the window above, Hammond waves
Ellie and Wu wear radio headsets
Okay Wu, 'll have you covered at every moment
But this shell carries quite a punch, so if you're too close, it'll take a piece of you
Ellie's on the headset with you
If another ones come at you, let her know
Then Ellie - you start jumping and yelling
The buggers are easily distracted
They'll come running and let Wu get that power on
Then both of you, get behind this fence as quick as possible
Wu and Ellie nod seriously and test radio contact
We starts his way across the lawn, Muldoon limps behind with his launcher
Ellie stands ready at the open gate
Wu takes slow steps
Muldoon follows
Wu is just five feet away from the door to the generator building
- Wu's tense face
is sudden and fierce
It comes from the brush
The raptor leaps onto Wu in an instant
Wu and the raptor roll on the ground
Wu struggles for his life
Muldoon can't get a safe shot
He : Wu, get away
Give me room to shoot
Ellie comes running away from the safety of the gate
She jumps up and down, waving her hands, and : Hey you cretaceous dromaeosaur, you can't catch me
Hey, come and get me, you flat-snouted Mongolian beast
Hey
The Raptor is distracted by this
He lets Wu go for a moment, shaking him loose from his bloody jaws
Instantly, Wu rolls away
Muldoon fires the rocket launcher
With a , the missile fires
Direct hit
The raptor is blown to tiny pieces
Muldoon grabs Wu and pulls the inju red man to safety
You ok
In reply Wu gets to his feet, looks where the Raptor was
Now, there's four
Muldoon helps Wu back inside the fence
He waves for Ellie to come in and join them
Ellie takes off toward the generator building
She : 'm going in
Muldoon, cover the door after  go in
Wu, guide me
Muldoon yells for her to wait but stops when he realizes that this may be their best plan
Ellie races like a gazelle across the open lawn
She's very fast and graceful
She ducks into the generator building
Above it all, Hammond watches at the small viewing window
- The three are at the top of the fence now
Grant carefully lifts Lex above the barbed wire and she grabs onto the other side of the fence to begin the climb down
Grant grabs Tim and lifts him next
Tim's tense face is a river of sweat
- Ellie finishes the stairs and feels her way along the basement wall
Her face is lit by a flashing yellow light
She bangs her head on a pipe
She rubs her head
Damn,  banged my head
( ) Oh that's good, that must be the water pipe
You're really close now, there's a cabinet just above your head
Reach up and open it
The handle turns to the left
Ellie turns the handle
The cabinet opens
( ) It's a large throw-switch
Pull it down, count to three, and push it back up
That's all there is to it
Ellie throws it down
She counts: One - - Just a few feet from the bottom of the fence
- Two - - Grant and Timmy jump down
Lex is just behind
Her sneaker catches in the fence pattern
She pulls on it
- Three
She throws the large switch back
- She jumps off the fence
Her sneaker comes off, falls to the ground
- it celebrates her narrow escape
Grant casually leans against the fence to help Lex with her shoe
The Visitor's Center is in sight
They all turn to each other
Elated
We did it
We made it
Lex jumps up and down
Grant smiles, high-fives Timmy
- The siren and the flashing lights stop
The room lights go on
Ellie turns to go back upstairs
Her foot slips, she falls to the ground
She has slipped on a pool of blood
She jumps up, recoils
It's Arnold
She squelches a , covering her own mouth
Ellie  as a raptor lunges at her
He jumps down from above the water pipe Ellie banged her head on
Ellie turns and races toward a ventilation shaft
She dives into it
The raptor gets there a second late and smashes against the shaft wall
Ellie pushes herself against the shaft wall and, using her legs to push against the wall, begins to climb up
The raptor smashes against the shaft again and gets inside
Ellie scrambles up
The raptor snarls and spits but it is momentarily pinned
Ellie continues her scramble up the shaft
At ground level, she slams her feet hard against a vent, popping it open
Scraping the wall and banging against pipes, she races toward the door
- Ellie runs full-tilt toward the fence surrounding Hammond's quarters
Wu, injured, lies within the safety of the fenced area
Muldoon stands with his rocket launcher just outside the fence waiting for Ellie
Ellie screams to him as she speeds across the lawn
Raptor
The raptor  th rough the door of the generator building after Ellie
Muldoon fires at the raptor
Misses
No time to reload
The raptor gains on Ellie
Muldoon ducks inside the fence's heavy gate
He slides the gate half-shut, waving Ellie on
Ellie dives inside the safety of the fence, losing her headset as she goes
The gate is almost closed
The raptor lunges
Muldoon slides shut the heavy gate, bashing the raptor's head with all his might
The raptor shudders, caught in the gate
Stunned, for a second, it doesn't move
Ellie and Muldoon run to the building
They push open the steel-clad security door and dive inside
Wu limping, chases after them
With a curse, Muldoon pushes the door back open, waves for Wu
'  - Wu runs frantically
The raptor jerks out of the gate, inside of the fence
He races after Wu
Keep it open
'm coming
Wu runs faster
The raptor gains on him
Wu screams, runs spastically
Wu and the raptor are neck-and-neck , equally close to the open door
Come on, Wu
Come on
Run
The raptor is inches from Wu
Both are closer and closer to the door
They're coming inside
Help
Wu and the raptor are at the door
No they're not, Ellie
Muldoon slams the door shut on Wu and the raptor
Wu's screams are horrific
'  - Ellie drops to her knees, her chest heaving, pulls her headset off with a bleeding hand
Muldoon, affected, turns to her
couldn't compromise everyone's safety
Ellie nods, catches her breath
Why didn't the power go on
You just reset the power
Now the computer has to be booted
Muldoon looks out the tiny barred window of the security do or
'  - There is already almost no sign of Wu
The gate to the perimeter fence slides shut
The raptor looks up
He is trapped within the perimeter fence of Hammond's quarters
to the viewing window above
Hammond stares down
'  - Grant and kids walk through the open security doors
All is empty and quiet
They call out but there are no answers
Where did everybody go
Grant thinks
Probably your grandfather's quarters
Let's go
Grant reconsiders
Actually, stay here
He corrals the kids into the half completed enclosure of the Gift Shop
No,  want to stay with you
Grant looks around tensely
No, keep an eye on things round here for me
'll be back with the others
What about - Grant looks at Timmy
'll radio the ship as soon as  find somebody
(beat)  You're in charge now
Don't move from here
unless you have to, ok
Timmy nods
Lex is happy, sinks to the floor
Goody
'm gonna rest
She finds a box of wind-up dinosaur toys
She winds one
Sends it walking to Timmy
Tired
He carried you the whole way
Grant slips off into the concealing shadows of the skeletal display of the -rex and raptor in combat
He looks back above his own shoulder into the menacing jaws of the skeletal raptor
He shouts back
Be right back
'  - It's a madhouse in the crowded baronial quarters of Hammond
Gennaro is singing at the top of his-lungs while Harding tries to restrain him
Scared Workers huddle together, many a re injured
Hammond sits on the floor, in a meditative trance
Ellie and Muldoon stare out the window
- The raptor is jumping in the air
With every jump he comes closer to leaping onto the roof of their small building
Muldoon regards his rocket launcher ruefully
Why don't you just nail that bastard
No more ammo
requisitioned six charges but the bean-counter - (he thrusts a finger at Hammond) - cut it down to two
Ellie looks up to the ceiling
There is a large glass skylight with crisscrossing iron bars casting an ominous shadow in the sun
- The ship continues along smooth sunlit sea
Land is in distant sight
- The cracked egg is nudged open
The cute scaly head of a six-inch baby raptor nuzzles its way out of the shell
It shakes off a few pieces of clinging shell and immediately begins to devour one of the remaining eggs
: - The wind-up dinosaur skitters across the polished floor
It bands against the  the wall again and again
Timmy looks down at it and smiles at Lex
Any candy behind the counter
Hungry
Starved
Timmy looks behind the counter
He sees boxes of goods
He moves a stack of umbrellas out of his way
Lex gets up and pulls one out
Nothing
Let's go to the kitchen
She smiles and pops to her feet
Timmy's not sure
Dr
Grant said - - let's go
We'll come right back
- Timmy's torn face
He's hungry, too
He makes the right decision
Nope
We're waiting here t ill Dr
Grant gets back
He'll help us get some - Interrupted by
rhythmic, horrible
Now some light and rapid
And a
It's definitely an animal
Lex backs off in a hurry
She knocks the umbrella over
It skirts across the floor
It spins and opens by itself
Printed on it is the ferocious face of the Spitter, the sides of its bright poisonous gills spinning to a stop
The breathing gets closer and closer
The children huddle together in a corner of the gift shop
They
It's  , lean and ferocious
More like a cyborg than a hunter, it studies the kids from just outside the gift shop entrance
His eyes flick back and forth between the two pieces of meat
Timmy grabs the box of toy dinosaurs
He winds one up and sends it off across the hall
The raptor glances over at the moving toy
Timmy grabs another, whispers as he winds it
Start winding now
Lex and Timmy wind toy after toy, send th em across the hall
The raptor leaps, crushing one in its jaws
Others waddle by
The raptor dodges and darts, grabbing this one, smashing that one
The kids go running out into the hall
They race down the Visitor Center corridor
Timmy pulls Lex behind him toward the restaurant
Where are we going
The kitchen
/  '  - With a huge leap, the raptor finally makes it to the roof of Hammond's quarters
He jumps lightly onto the skylight
Glass shatters over the assembled guests and workers below
Total commotion and
The raptor immediately begins to gnaw at the iron bars that block the skylight
Below, they shake off shards of glass and huddle in the corners
Ellie turns to Muldoon
How long
Well, they seem to be getting faster all the time
would say - fifteen minutes
Ellie no tices something out the window
It's Grant approaching the gate
She hammers on the glass
Grant's hand reaches for the knob
The raptor stops gnawing, its ears perked up
Ellie screams and screams
Grant notices some of Wu's remains inside the gate
He stops and looks up
At the window, Ellie waves her arms, warning him not to enter
Grant stops
He sees Wu's headset on the grass, reaches through the fence, grabs it, puts it on
Ellie jumps up and gets her headset
She barks into it
There's a raptor on the roof of this building
Open that gate and you're a dead man
Grant stares up at Ellie in the window
He waves
She presses her hand to the glass
Ellie, 'm go glad - Shut up and listen
We have about fifteen minutes here
The computer has to be rebooted
That'll turn on the electric fences
Besides the r aptor stuck in here with us, there are four more
Grant races back to the Visitor's Center as she continues to fill him in
, '  - The kids hurtle through this huge, industrial kitchen
The kitchen is a maze of turns, from the hot lamp pickup area to the rows of stainless steel burners to the chopping blocks to the potwashing area
The kids dart and duck from one area to the next, taking shortcuts under tables, crawling behind counters, scattering pots and pans behind
Relentlessly, with a casual speed, the raptor stalks them
It avoids their obstacles with a casual grace and when it cannot fit through their shortcuts, it just continues around
Timmy pulls open the large silvered door of the freezer
Lex starts to hurry inside
Timmy grabs her
We'll freeze to death in there
He's going to eat us
Timmy reaches into the freezer and grabs a pile of steaks
He tosses one toward the raptor
The raptor gobbles it in one bite
Timmy shoves Lex out of the way and begins to toss the steaks on the floor
One after the other, he tosses them, in a row, closer and closer to the open freezer
The raptor mechanically gobbles the steaks, following their path
He continues right into the freezer to grab the last of Tim's bait
Tim leaps and slams the heavy freezer door shut
Lex comes running and throws her small weight alongside of Timmy's
The heave and the lock catches on the door
From inside, there is a strangled  and the door is slammed repeatedly
The metal panels of the door buckle but they do not break
The door hinges bend and curve but they do not give
The kids collapse in relief on the kitchen floor
In just a moment, Timmy is back on his feet
What is it, Timmy
just remembered something
Rapto rs are born in large litters
There's probably more coming
We gotta hide
He grabs her hand and they run out of the back entrance of the kitchen
There's a stairway and they race up
- Grant, wearing his headset, calls for the kids and looks around the gift shop with concern
He sniffs the air and examines the crushed windup toys
He sees some animal scales on the floor
He hears a  above and begins to run
, '  - The kids hear this  too and it's closer to them
They bust into - ,  - The kids knock over trays of stones as they rush through this room
,  - Automated drills whir as Tim and Lex crash through, knocking equipment to the ground
The drills still whir on the ground
- The Hamachi-Hood sequencers explode in a heap of punch cards and magnetic tape as the kids race by
,  - The kids slide int o this room
They race to its far corner, past incubators and display cases of chemicals
They look back and see - '  -  raptor happily gorging itself on a table of eggs
He's been in this room, their place of refuge, the whole time
- The raptor's glistening eyes register the children
He begins to stalk
The kids
This time there is nowhere to go
The raptor closes in on the kids
Timmy feebly stands in front of his younger sister
- The raptor licks its lips, lizard-like
At the other end of the room,   quickly
He surveys the situation
Quickly, he grabs an egg off a table
He reaches into one of the chemical cabinets with   prominently displayed
He comes out with a syringe and a vial
The raptor is almost on the kids
Grant coughs conspicuously
The raptor whirls, studies Grant
He looks back at the children
Grant speaks into the headset
( ) Talk, Ellie, just keep talking
He tosses the headset on the ground
Ellie's voice crackles out
The raptor studies it, transfixed
Grant injects the egg, then gently rolls it on the ground
The raptor forgets the headset
He comes forward and sniffs the egg, then sucks it up, swallowing it whole
The raptor turns back to the kids
He takes two steps toward them, tenses to pounce - and keels over
The kids race around the dead raptor to Grant
Grant grabs his headset as the three run out of the room
Grant addresses Timmy as they run
Timmy, you know anything about computers
Well,  just got an  at home
told my Dad  wanted a 386
Ok good, you're elected
- Grant and Tim and Lex study the quiet room
Grant speaks calmly into his headset
( ) Okay, we've reached the computer room
Who can te ll Timmy how to reboot
( ) Ah, Alan, nobody here knows how to boot the computer
Please hurry, we've only got a couple minutes left
Tim, you got to book the system
They reset the power and there are no phones
We gotta turn on the fences and we gotta stop that ship
Are they going to be ok
If we can get help very soon
Sshh, you guys, 'm thinking
He studies a grid on a large console
He reaches out and touches a part of the screen
There is a beep and a warning sign -
'  - The raptor has chewed almost all the way through the bars
Panic below
In the middle of it all, Ellie is focused, listening on her headset
- Timmy tries somethin g else
Lex raises a hand
Grant stops her
( ) Ellie, we're working as fast as we can here
Timmy tries a screen section
Again
Again
Timmy shakes his head
In desperation he stabs at the keyboard below the touch screen
He punches the  button
The screen lights up a new message - '  - The raptor has just chewed through
He squeezes his body into the space as the bars
Spastically, the raptor jerks back and forth as the current flows through him
He can't get out
Finally, with a , he stops struggling and slides through the space he created
With a , he drops to the floor below
Ellie, Muldoon, Hammond and the workers look on in shock
- Grant cheers and hugs Timmy
Lex whoops
( ) Ok, we're all right here for now
Thanks
( ) Don't mention it
It was Timmy
( ) But there's still one more raptor
So be careful
Timmy is pushing menus and submenus on the touchscreen now
-  -
He gets the one he wants
He indicates the radio-mike to Grant
think this is the boat
They called it the Queen Anne or something
Grant grabs the mike
Queen Anne, do you read me
Queen Anne
The radio crackles to life
This is the Queen Anne
copy
What's up
Report your position
Ah, we're just about to dock here in Puntaremas
Who wants to know
Please identify yourself
Tim punches the screen which displays , (
) Grant reads it and nods
His voice is tough as nails
Try this for identification, Captain Farrell
You are in possession of stolen biological materials
If you don't turn that boat around and return to Isla Nublar immediately with your contraband cargo, you will be found in violation of Section 509 of the Uniform Maritime Act, you will be subject to revocation of license, penalties in excess of fifty thousand dollars, and five years in jail
Do you copy
Do you copy, Captain Farrell
copy
All ahead stern
blinking light on a map indicates that the ship is pulling away from the harbor
Grant nods to Timmy who terminates the radio contact
What's the Uniform Maritime Code
Who the hell knows
Grant and Timmy start to celebrate again when Lex interrupts
What good does that do
To have the ship turn around
Grant turns to her seriously
Well it gives us ten more hours
(to Timmy) Let's see if we can raise the Costa Rican Coast Guard on that thing
The last raptor smashes into the control room through Hammond's viewing window
Glass goes flying
Grant and kids go running into the hallway
- With the raptor in hot pursuit, the kids and Grant come flying
Tim and Lex jump over the railing, leaping onto the skeletal display
Grant goes for the stairs, jumping down them three at a time
The raptor goes after the kids, scrambling over the balcony onto the display
The kids scamper down the display, knocking paint cans and tools off the scaffolding as they go
The raptor is just one beat behind, and his snar ling face is splashed with red paint as he chases
The kids burrow into the rib cage of the Rex
They break off floating rubs and hurl them back at the raptor
The raptor is undeterred, closing the gap on the kids
The kids are stuck at the end of the rib cage - it's closed off by the skeleton and they can't break through
They're imprisoned
The raptor is pushing through the rib cage, bones crackling as it goes
Grant leaps up the scaffolding, grabs a beam, swings his weight onto it, and slams it into the -Rex's neck
The neck shatters and the massive head of the -Rex drops free
It falls directly onto the last raptor, squashing him flat
Dead
(grimly) And then there were none
- Muldoon leads his workers onto an army helicopter
Two workers carry Gennaro on a stretcher
Ellie boards with the kids on each side of her, holding her hands
Grant and Hammond walk together, toward the helicopter
Dr
Grant, don't abandon this beautiful place
need a man just like you to help me get my park back on its feet again
And it will be on its feet again
We have to leave now
Hammond stops
Oh you don't know
There are wonderful plans in the works, sites already purchased for Euro-Jurassic and Jurassic Japan
Grant is unimpressed
He holds a hand out to Hammond
Hammond tries a new approach
Don't you see 've exalted human potential here
You must see it
You must feel it
called back a life form
Listen, Dr
Grant, don't go
Be a part of this
'm inviting you to do just that - let the others go, if they want
You interrupted natural law
There are regulations, rules that nature follows that make her knowable
You mean there are rules that nature follows that create barriers to our knowledge
Barriers
Like the seasons
The earth spinning, orbiting the sun
The entire solar system in interlocking motion
Our own beings in biological step with it all
Mr
Hammond, you've disrupted the pattern and look what it's done
know what it's done
've made triceratops and gallimimus and a -Rex
've got a batch of iguanadons being born on Tuesday
What do you say to that
Don't count on it
Now get in
Grant jumps in the copter, holds out a hand to Hammond
You created mutant forms that you further mutated to create amus ement attractions
You made biological puppets with heartbeats and an early death sentence
created genetic miracles
You created a park to generate a profit- making merchandising operation
The merchandise is just a by-product
Souvenirs for people to reflect on the wonder
You fainted when you saw the brachiosaur
Alan, look, let's not argue
The problem is that my employees were not up to par with my dream
They failed me
The park,  promise you, is safe
It really is
Grant grabs Hammond's arm, starts to tug
You park is doomed
Now come with me
It is not
It's blooming
In the throes of labor
You are one more more negative voice in a universe of negativity
You'll amount to nothing
You'll be a bone-brusher all your life
pity you
Hammond pulls his arm away and strides away from the helicopter just as the
Hammond's suit whips in the wind
Grant calls to him, reaching out his arm
Come back, Mr
Hammond
It's over
Hammond keeps walking
He disappears over a grassy knoll
Grant's outstretched hand drops to his side when   comes
With a huge bellow, the -Rex comes charging at the helicopter screams for all to board as he starts to lift off
The Rex bites onto the copter skid as the copter tries to escape
The copter angles dangerously as the Rex holds on
Ellie fires a fire-extinguisher into the furious face of the Rex and its jaws relax
The copter escapes and starts to climb high into the sky
The Rex paws after it, then drops down to four legs and gives the copter a final swipe with its tail
The tail  through the air and  against the plexiglass windshield which fissures and pops
The pilot struggles to maintain altitude and manages to keep the craft in the air
With a  of its own, the copter breaks into the blue sky and soars
away, leaving an angry -Rex alone
Unnoticed by the frustrated Rex, Hammond slips away and walks into the jungle
- the exhausted faces of Muldoon and his workers, Lex and Timmy holding onto each other, and Grant huddles next to Ellie
He reaches out and puts an arm around her shoulder
She reaches up and pulls his arm close
They're so beautiful
They're condemned, aren't they
Even those embryo fragments had the same viral contamination
have a theory
Ellie looks up in surprise
She give him a big smile
You have a theory
Grant smiles back at her
think that they could never completely isolate the dinosaur
There was always some microscopic mosquito contamination
But at the molecular level, that was enough
Every dinosaur received the same genetic massage, the encoding that every mosquito gets to terminate life after a season
So the very process itself was flawed
She's sad
Grant hugs her
Over her shoulder he gives a parting glance to the island
green jewel in a blue sea
Suddenly it is obliterated by clouds
from the copter
the sky
to Isla Nublar, slowly reveling in its natural beauty and finally coming to earth in the midst of the verdant jungle
- Hammond slowly climbs a steep hill covered with creeping growth
He almost reaches the top when he slips
He falls to the soft ground and rolls
He tumbles he lplessly, rolling and spinning down the sharp drop, finally coming to a complete stop in a shallow pool of water
Face down, his head splashes into the puddle
No movement
Just the sound of labored breath
to Hammond's hand, half-submerged in water as a mosquito lands on his hand
: - The army copter circles lower and lower as it finds the Queen Anne , slowly drifting across the moonlit water
