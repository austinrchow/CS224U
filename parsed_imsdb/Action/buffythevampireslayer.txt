Buffy, the Vampire Slayer Buffy, the Vampire Slayer by Joss Whedon : - We see an Italian village at the height of the plague
Funeral processions, decrepit houses with their windows boarded up
the stench of death all around
: Through the filth a  walks his horse
He is weary but not so dingy as his surrounding; a stranger in these parts
He comes to an inn, where a boy takes his horse round back
He enters the inn
- The inn is dark and almost empty
couple of patrons drink silently at tables
Behind the bar stands a slovenly , dark-haired and lazy
She scratches at her shoulder, on which we see a birthmark
The knight approaches the bar, throws money down
tankard of ale, wench
The barmaid pours him a cup of ale
He drinks deep, stands a moment
(continuing) Some plague we're having, huh
: -  / - The barmaid leads the knight, by candlelight, upstairs to his room
The door opens inward
The knight stands in the doorway, places a hand on the barmaid's hip
She pauses a moment, then breaks free of his grasp, starts down the hall
He laughs a bit, resignedly, and closes the door
stands behind it
Not two feet from the knight, grinning at him
His eyes are skull-hollow and dancing in his head, his bloody smile full with teeth
His skin is gray, and peeling
The knight turns slowly and sees him
Oh, my god
The vampire licks his lips
He is on the knight in a second, pushing him backwards into the middle of the small room
The knight struggles but is no match for the vampire, who buries his face in the knight's neck
The knight screams
It suddenly flies open, the lock shattered
The vampire turns like a frightened animal
In the doorway stands the barmaid, a
In her hand is a wooden stake
The vampire drops the knight, who crabs backwards into a corner
The Slayer and the vampire come at each other
The Slayer spins and kicks; the vampire flies back
Snarling, he comes back at the slayer
They struggle; he slips free and is out the door
For a moment, the Slayer remains still, crouched on the floor
The knight watches her
She seems to be making a decision -- perhaps even knows what is going to happen
She runs at the window
: - The vampire comes running out the front door
Before he is a few feet from the front of the inn, the Slayer  through the upstairs window and lands on him
They both hit the ground, and she plants the stake right in his heart
After a moment, we hear a voice: (
) The lord giveth, and the lord taketh away
Ashes, ashes
She looks up
(continuing) All fall down There are ten or more vampires walking slowly toward her in the otherwise deserted street
At the front, maybe ten feet away, is
Amilyn is a grinning jackal, a servant to the Vampire-King
His garb is a rotted approximation of a courtier's livery
He ambles toward the Slayer, giggling, as she stands
Behind her is , the Vampire-King
His skin is deep white, and smooth
He wears a long coat -- his dress is not of any era
He is practically upon her before he speaks
You must forgive Amilyn
He tends to drool before supper
She turns
He smiles, almost lovingly
Lothos
You people will never learn
She swings at him but he grabs her arm
Amilyn laughs obnoxiously
Lothos grabs the back of the Slayer's head, brings her to him in a loving embrace
(continuing) We can't be stopped
This is our world now
He pulls her head back swiftly, snapping her spine as her head hits the back of her legs
Lightning flashes
: - Lightning flashes outside the window
It is torrenting rain
An old  speaks to a hysterical  of sixteen or so
They are both obviously noble of birth
can't
You know you must
There is only one
Now you are that one
It is time
Why
Why me
She has died
You are the next to be called
Why do you think you were sent to me
Trained as you were
You bear the mark
He pulls aside her blouse to reveal a birthmark on her shoulder, identical to the barmaid's
(continuing) The mark of the Coven
don't understand
Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent
Satan
He sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his Hell on our earth
They are a plague upon us
The man unravels a satchel of cloth
From it he pulls an elaborately carved wooden stake
(continuing) But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers
Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers
One dies, the next is called
'm just a girl
You are much more
He hands her the stake
She feels the fit
(continuing) One dies, the next is called
As she grips the stake more tightly, an awareness and sense of power sees to fill her
She lifts the stake over her head
- The hand is lifted high, but it is not the girl's
It holds not a stake, but a pom-pom
-   - Opening  : football game in progress
The stands are pretty full, the crowd enthusiastic
The hemery football stadium is just that; a real stadium, not just makeshift stands on grass
On  the sidelines are the Hemery cheerleaders, led by
She is blonde (in nature as in name), pretty, and very gracefully athletic
She obviously enjoys what she is doing, and she's good at it
With her on the squad are  and , two of her best friends
Beside them the , yelling at the players
The scoreboard reads
On the field are , wide receiver (and Buffy's boyfriend), , quarterback, and , the huge left tackle
Buffy and the crowd wince as Andy is sacked for a nine-yard loss
Come on, do the play
The one where
the one from the book
Where you make it go forward
The players huddle
All right, guys, come on
He hits Grueller's helmet
(continuing) Grueller
Fill that hole
They were all over me
Okay
Let's run twenty-two
Grueller, close the pocket, watch out for thirty-five
Thompson, run the post, right, wide out
Jeffrey, go up the middle and run around like a chicken
They clap and break
As they line up, Jeffrey looks over at Buffy
She smiles at him
He winks, very suave
Jeffrey
Jeffrey
He's our man
If he can't do it We don't want it
On the hike, Andy drops back and looks for a receiver
Jeffrey runs in circles like an idiot (and not unlike a chicken), waving his arms until Andy sails him the ball and he breaks for a touchdown
The crowd goes wild -- particularly Buffy, who does an impressive standing backflip
Nicole looks at her, impressed
Buffy smiles at her, giddy
(looking around) Is that good
Was that a good thing
: - The mall is typically busy
Buffy, Nicole, Jennifer and can bee seen making their way through it
They are all dressed very similarly:  bright colors, a lot of white and pink
Not trashy, but mainstream and uninspired
Esprit
All of them carry shopping bags; they've done a good days work
: The girls pass by stores, vaguely window shopping
Mr
Howard is so heinous
He's always giving me a hard time get a -plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history
'   have no sense of history
He wears a brown tie
You got a -plus
can't believe cheated off you
Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador
Like 'm ever going to Spain anyway
Ooh
dress on a rack outside a store has caught her eye
She takes it and holds it in front of her
(continuing) Mmmm
Wouldn't  look just edible and nutritious in this
Kimberly and Jennifer catch up to them
Guys, what's the sitch
'm bored
(modeling the dress for Kimberly)) What do you think
Please
It's so '91
Oh
Buffy puts it back
What are we doing
Why don't we see a movie
Well, where
Omniplex
Nee sitch
No way
No
They don't even have Dolby
Beverly Center
Please
They show previews for foreign movies
/ Bogus corn
Totally stale
And the ushers are like, the acne patrol
We're thinking Pavilion
Sitch
Sounds toasty
We're going Pavilion
Excellent
What's playing there
stranger, walking the other way, bumps into Buffy, doesn't stop
man of about fifty, he is dressed shabbily, in a wrinkled black suit and a black shirt
He somewhat resembles a priest
(continuing) Excuse much
Not rude or anything
(calling back) Nice ensemble
What a homeless
The girls continue walking
The man stops, turns to stare after them
His look is intense, slightly worried, his face somewhat haggard
Intelligence shines through his eyes
He holds himself stiffly, arms close to him, almost as if he expected something to strike at him
This is
He pulls a picture out of his coat pocket, looks at it
Looks at them
- The film is in progress
This has no effect on the girls, however, as they continue to talk ceaselessly
They all have diet sodas
(to Buffy) So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house
That's the plan
Good enough
Your parents are always going away for the weekend
You're so lucky
(maybe not) Yeah,  guess
My mom doesn't go anywhere
She even does the shopping network
'm gonna die a virgin
What did Jeffrey's dad say
'Just remember you're in training, son' Oh, God
He is so bald
Seated a few rows behind the girls are  and
The are fairly punked out, (and not currently attending high school)
Pike is long and lean, has short hair spiked and a taste for long coats and black
Benny is somewhat stockier, opts for a shaved head and suspenders
Doc Martins for both
Benny is clearly the more belligerent of the two -- when Pike speaks, it's with surprising wit and reserve
Sometimes
Will you guys shut up, please
It could happen
Pike and Benny throw popcorn at her
Booo
Suck
Wrong answer
No prize
God
Take a chill lozenge
Like we don't have rights too
Ignore them
can't believe these people
We paid money to see this
No, we didn't
Oh, yeah
But  still want to know what happens
Everyone get horribly killed except the blonde girl in the nightie, who finally kills the monster with a machete but it's not really dead
The boys stare at her
Oh, my God
Is that true
Probably
What movie is this
: - Fat and yellow, behind the clouds
We hear a long
- Jeffrey pulls into the parking lot in his  convertible
Grueller, howling, sits in the back behind Jeffrey and Andy
They park and hop out, head toward the entrance
Look at that moon
It's huge
Come on, guys, we gotta do something tonight
Party
You know, if you would spend more time at home sleeping, you would spend less time on the field, sucking
You were a bone out there today
Anyway, 'm booked
Gonna spend some quality time with the little woman
(coughing it into their hands) Pussy-whipped
Pussy-whipped
You guys are pathetic
Later for you, then
'm blowing
Andy, you coming
No, 'll hitch a ride with Jeffrey
Okay
Later
Headbutt
Andy and Grueller bring their foreheads together with painstaking slowness, grimacing, and barely tap heads
(continuing) Later
Grueller walks off, head through a park
At the same time, Pike and Benny emerge from the theater
They pass Andy and Jeffrey and the two pairs circle each other, almost growling, eyes locked, before pike and Benny turn and walk off, not quite in the direction Grueller took
Buffy, Kimberly, Jennifer and Nicole come out right after
Buffy heads straight for Jeffrey and they kiss massively
Nice game
Jeffrey,  don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can  borrow her
Andy
No way
You'd get her dirty
(off her look) He would, honey
He's an animal
: - Grueller walks through the trees, enters an enclosed clearing of grass
He hears something, stops
Maybe his name, maybe just the
He looks about him, hesitantly
Starts forward, stops again
Yo
Who is that
Don't mess with me man, 'll rip your head off
Nothing
(continuing) Come on, come out here
Let's see what you got
No one
(continuing) Forget this
He turns on his heel, ready to drop all show and bolt is right behind him
Wally is a ninth grader, small, nerdy, and recently undead
In marked contrast to the older vampire in the prologue, Wally is freshly undead
He still has fat on his face; in fact, he looks almost normal from afar
But his inhuman eyes and his uncommon pallor mark him as a vampire
And the way he speaks is unearthly
Hollow, almost detached; repeating phrases sometimes almost as though he had never heard them before
He smiles at Grueller
(continuing) Bessel
What are you doing here
Hi, Grueller
What are you grinning at
You think was scared
Could be
You think so
Could be
Grueller grabs Wally by his shirt collar and readily hoists his small body up, Wally's feet dangling two feet off the ground
Listen, you little worm
could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like  did last year, you got that
You got that
(repeating) Got that
Good
He lets Wally go
Wally remains two feet in the air
Grueller's eyes go wide
(continuing) What the
Wally smiles even more broadly, quietly hissing
He has long fangs, made somehow more grotesque by the fact that he also has braces
Wally's hands vise onto Grueller's head, lightning quick
Grueller screams
- Crossing a street, turning and listening
- ' Speeding by, everyone packed into it
Andy howls back at Grueller, mistaking his intent
He settles back
The girls are looking at him
It's um
you had to be there
In the front seat next to Jeffrey, Buffy winces slightly
You okay
yeah, 'm okay
'm fine
- : '   -    - We see another full moon, this one on the  screen
"Dracula" is on, Lugosi's original
The lights are off in the living room as Jeffrey enters from the kitchen, sits down on the couch holding a bag of munchies
Buffy is still in the kitchen, making corn
Jeffrey flicks the remote, changes channels
- The movie is replaced by the local news, in mid-broadcast sits at his deck, a super of a teenage girl behind him
-- The fourth such disappearance in less than two months
The sheriff was not available for comment, but a police spokesman issued a statement, saying that the situation is not out of hand
: - Buffy's  walks purposefully into the kitchen holding a suitcase that he plops by the front door
He crosses out again as Buffy's  crosses in, also with luggage
' We're gonna be late
knew it
' (to Buffy, but not looking at her) Now, we'll be back on Sunday, number's on the fridge, don't drive the Jaguar and tell Consuela my underwear does not go in the dishwasher
She's already out again by the end of this, as dad comes back in
' Have fun be good stay away from the Jag
know
And he's out the back, mom entering on his heels
' Well, that's everything
Kiss noise
She actually makes a kiss noise at her daughter
'Bye
Buffy's mom heads out the door as Buffy heads into the living room
- ' (calling out) Bye-bye, Bobby
Bye
(to Buffy) They think my name's Bobby
Well
it's possible they think my name's Bobby
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh
Something like that
Hey, it works for me
If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable
Buffy sits, squints disapprovingly at the screen
She has a bag of microwave lite popcorn and is spraying diet butter substitute on it
What show is this
It's the news, Buffy
Oh
Who's in it
(off his look) know what it is
It's what's on instead of the movie
just want to see the basketball scores
It's important
(over a handful of popcorn) Mmmnkay
Jeffrey leans in toward her
Of course, there are
other considerations
He starts kissing her about the face and neck
She leans submissively back on the couch as he works his way on top of her
He gives her a long kiss on the mouth, then works over to her ear
As he is burrowing about in there, Buffy sneaks another handful of popcorn into her mouth
She leans back, by accident, on the remote
- "Dracula" reappears
: 18TH    - Not, by any stretch, an upscale joint
Dark, cramped, and scummy
young Chinese Whore sits on a bed, wearing little enough that we can see the telltale birthmark on her shoulder
repulsive British  is dressing, his business finished
Looking disgusted, he throws his payment on the bed
For some reason, the bed is littered with popcorn
You never touched my heart
He leaves
Alone, the Girl hears a  in the dark corner, a wet
Slowly she gets up to see
Approaches
It is a pool of blood
She stares at it, terrified
hand reaches out of it
She runs out into the hall, but it leads nowhere but a dead end
Standing there, waiting for her, is Lothos
He smiles at her and we see she is now Buffy
Soon
: '  -  - Buffy is thrashing in bed
Jeffrey is holding her by the shoulders and shaking her
Buffy
Hey, what's the sitch
Wake up
She wakes, grasping, her eyes melting into focus on Jeffrey's face
Oh, wow
Oh, wow
Oh, wow
You were having a nightmare
He settles back down, his arms around her, and almost instantly begins to fall asleep again
(continuing) What'd you dream about
Nothing
Come on, what was it
Nothing
It was just a dream
: '  - Dark, cavernous -- walls hewn from rock, lit torches clamped to them
Cold stone floor and in the foreground, a dark pool of blood
, possibly a chant, fills the air
figure steps up to the pool, his back to the , and kneels before it
He holds his hand over the surface of the blood
As he speaks, his voice an urgent hiss, we him, see that it is Amilyn
You have brought us here, and we thrive
We thrive
You will awake in a new world
Just as  promised, untold splendor, rubies dripping from our lips
Just as we said
- ' hand shoots out of the pool and grabs Amilyn's
Amilyn leans over and fervently kisses it
(continuing) Soon
: - Buffy sits with Nicole, Jennifer, Kimberly and
Cassandra is not quite in the same league as the other girls -- for one thing, she studies
She's not as glamorous, nor a vacuous
The environment
They consider this a moment
The homelesses
Oh, please
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing
Guys
The environment
'm telling you, it's totally key
The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it
thought he was doing Indians
Jeffrey and Andy arrive, sit
Jeffrey straddles Buffy from behind, wrapping his arms around her
She snuggles in his grasp
Hey there
Hi
(shyly) Hi, Jeffrey
Whatchya guys doing
The winter dance
We need to come up with a theme
The senior dance
How about
'Our Friend, the Beer
' 'Putting Out for Fun and Profit'
possible thought
Try new Clue-flakes
It has to be, like a socially conscious theme
(reading from a memo) 'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them
' | Downer
still say the environment
That's my suggestion
It is a pretty crucial subject
See, Cassandra likes it
Cassandra's my friend
like it
Can  be your friend
Stay away from my thang
(to Buffy) Sorry, honey
'Thing
' Environment
That's cool with me
Okay
So, what are the most immediate threats to the world environment right now
Cassandra has paper and pen, is poised to make a list of suggestions
The other all look at each other uncomfortably
Cassandra obviously knows the answer, but regards her friends silently, waiting to see what the come up with
Well, um
litter
Litter, yeah
Everyone but Cassandra is impressed by this
(to Cassandra) Write that down
Okay, what else
Forest fires
Communism
Bugs
(helpfully) Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer
Oh, yeah
Right
We gotta get rid of that
That's right
, a well meaning but pompous little administrator, come up to the kids
He's kind of like Charlie Brown:  you always say his whole name
don't suppose you kids heard the first bell, did you
The first bell was saying, 'Start going to class, it's time to go to class
' In about thirty seconds the second bell is going to be saying, 'Already be in class
' We're having a very important discussion here
Why do  have trouble believing you
Something from your childhood, maybe
Button it, Kramer
Classes are starting
Be there or beware
Gary Murray walks off
Man has a complex
He's got a
What do you call it
Napoleonic Code
It's 'cause he's so tiny
Yes, but what he lacks in height he makes up in shortness
They get up and start heading to class
Let's meet tonight, okay
Where
Cafe Blase
Cool
We can figure decorations and stuff
Cassandra, you gotta come, too
Can't
History report
The Normans and the Saxons
Bogutude
Blow it off
really can't
Besides, it's pretty interesting
(not harshly) You're weird and 'm afraid of you
Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework
Like what
Like my homework
Buffy smiles, trots off
: - We see  of the deserted city at night
It's a small, upscale town
Suburban streets, businesses, and a  few more depressed areas, boarded up houses
No one is out , shadows flicker, but the curling mist is the only visible presence
: - classic faux-Fifties
diner
Pictures of Frankie and Annette, bright lights, those same tired Fifties standards playing on the
Buffy, Kimberly, Jennifer and Nicole are sitting at the end of the counter, at the corner
don't see why we have to invite everyone
Kimberly, it's the senior dance
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that
Can't they make exceptions
Maryanne Heinel
She's such a scud
Can't we have a Maryanne clause
Well, look who's here
' Pike and Benny have entered the diner, quite drunk
As they pass the jukebox, Benny gives it a kick and the music stops
few people look up, annoyed, as they approach the counter
Hey
The Fifties are over
(earnestly) We have to learn to let go
Don't give me any trouble, okay
No trouble
We just want to eat
They sit next to Buffy and begin pooling their money on the counter
It comes to about $2
50, heavy with pennies
(continuing) Come on, come on, fork up the scub
That's it, man
That's the whole story
We're looking at a dog, possible coffee
He digs and produces a quarter from his pocket
(continuing) It's coffee
Amazing
(to the other girls) Smell of booze much
Nice much
(to the waitress) Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe
You guys are thrashed
(to Buffy) What are you talking to them for
(to Buffy) What did you say
Yeah, we're drunk
We're the Drunks
What's your name
Buffy
Figures
Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo
'  'm just wondering
Buffy gives him a look
(continuing) The don't
You kind of wish they would, though
Wit-tay
'm sorry
'm Pike
This is Benny
Pike isn't a name
It's a fish
Hey, wait a minute
You're the guys from the movie
(good naturedly) We hate you guys
The girls all make sad noises, real sarcastic
(continuing) You guys were way rude
It was shocking
You just snuck in anyway
So you have to ruin the movie for us
You know, other people have feelings, too
am so sure
The waitress brings the hot do
Benny takes it out of the bun and holds it over his crotch, phallus-like
Hey, Buffy, you hungry
got something for you
The other girls look down and shriek
Buffy looks at Benny, looks at him in the eye
- ' It closes silently around the knife at her place
Buffy is still looking at Benny, she seems to be hypnotizing him, and maybe even herself
The  in the diner seems to for a moment
Buffy shifts slightly, almost a twitch, and the spell is broken
The  , Buffy looks away, letting go of the knife exactly where it was
Benny looks down
His hot dog has been sliced neatly down to about an inch
He is shocked
(continuing) Hey
She wasted my dog
(smiling) Bummer metaphor
Buffy looks off, a little surprised herself
: - Pike and Benny have left the diner and are walking down the street
Pike produces a bottle of Mezcal from his coat pocket and takes a swig, hand it to Benny
They continue to pass it back and forth
Rich bitches
They're a plague
They've gotta be stopped
You didn't like them
They're all the same
They're so stuck up, they're just
they're not even human
hate them
Would you sleep with them
Yes
Definitely
Definitely
Please, God
Well, there it is, isn't it
You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them
What's that all about
got a news flash, man, another shot of this and 'll have sex with you
Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me
They continue walking
shadowy figure appears behind them, following
: - The girls have all finished their sundaes
Come one, that was so weird
(uncomfortable) What, it's not weird
just cut the stupid hot dog in half
can't believe they still ate it
(to Buffy) Where'd you learn how to do that
didn't learn
just
it's not a big deal
Buffy, 'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National
(annoyed) Get a boob job
It's like when we took gymnastics in eighth grade
Buffy makes a face
She doesn't want to hear this story
We on her as Nicole tells it
What happened
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke
You're kidding
Snapped
Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and  swear to God she went across the room
Perm over heels
Oh, my God
Ouch
No wonder you quit
Well, that's the thing
She landed on her feet
Didn't even sprain a toe
And  go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this -- She makes a hyper-intense face
The others laugh
(continuing) -- like she's gonna kill me
was just scared is all
No
It was mondo bizarro
Buffy, the ape-woman
Seriously, Buffy
That look was way twisted
What were you thinking about
: - Perhaps in answer, we see the same shadowy figure moving behind Pike and Benny as they continue to walk home
They're really bombed now
They are somewhere in the hills now, and they come to the edge of a steep incline overlooking the valley waist-high concrete wall is built into the side of the earth
They stand below a thick, green tree
'll have it running in a week
It's be beauty
It just needs new shocks, you know, break pads, an engine, and some wheels
It'll be totally cherry
Pike finishes the bottle, eats the worm, and chucks the over the side
There is a moment before they hear it
When you get your car together, man, let's bail
You think
Split
Utterly
Let's bail this town
It's getting
don't know
Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches
Our own world, where we could live and grow beans
Hundreds of beans
Benny wavers, catches hold of Pike
think 'm gonna ralf
He leans over the side of the wall, hangs his head down
Don't worry, Benny
'm here for you
Pike falls over backwards
(continuing) 'm here for you, Ralf
Pike passes out
- Still waiting to throw up
The figure approaches slowly from behind him
The figure is a few feet away from him when a hand shoots down from above and grabs Benny's face
- Amilyn sits on a low branch, pulls Benny up to face him
Amilyn has changed his manner of dress drastically
He wears a motorcycle jacket and sunglasses
His hair is punked out
Benny is in shock, as Amilyn holds him easily by his shirt collar
You wanna go for a ride
Amilyn leans back -- all the way back, falling back out of the tree and pulling Benny with him
We see them fall out past the wall just as the shadowy figure reaches it
It is Merrick, the man from the mall
He runs to the side of the wall, looks over
The two are already lost in the dark mist
Merrick turns around, looks about him
He digs in his pockets, pulls out a cross and a stake, holds them tightly
While digging he pulls out an old, stained picture, lays it on the railing
Stake and cross in hand, he stands by Pike looking out at the night
- It is a ten year old girl about to blow out the candles on her birthday cake
The cake reads, "Happy Birthday, Buffy"
: - Buffy, Nicole and Jennifer and another cheerleader are practicing
What was the step after
The one from Thursday
never learned it right,  don't think
Buffy shows her
They do it together for a minute
That is so cool
Thank you very much
Nobody is even gonna look at the game
Hey,  was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'
You know, and a picture of the earth
Don't tread on the earth
don't get it
How do you not tread on the earth
mean, you kind of have to
never thought of that
gotta bail
You coming
You guys blow
'm waiting on Cassandra
She's gonna help me with my history
Cassandra's really smart
Yeah
She's okay, though
guess
Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight
Jealous
Jennifer laughs, uncomfortably
(continuing) Don't worry, Jennifer
Someday your prince will come
Yeah, just make sure you do first
Let's go, guys
'bye
The other girls leave
Buffy is alone on the empty field
She looks around her
She starts doing a routine, tentatively
Then she runs toward the middle of the field and jumps, flies into an extraordinary series of gymnastic flips and cartwheels
She rolls into one final flip, a huge one, and lands, a perfect ten, about three inches from Merrick
She screams in surprise, steps back
(continuing) God, where the hell did you come from
You scared me to death
'm sorry
That was impressive
The
tumbling
His accent is clipped -- British
What
Oh
used to do gymnastics
Are you looking for someone
'm looking for you, actually
Am  in trouble or something
Not at all
My name is Merrick was sent to find you some time ago
should have found you much sooner but there were
complications
You should have been taught, prepared
What are you talking about
've searched the entire world for you, Buffy
Why
To bring you
your birthright
My birthright
You mean, like a trust fund
Merrick looks at her
(continuing) had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and spent it on shoes
You must come with me
It's much too late already
You must come with me to the graveyard
Wait a minute
My birthright is in the graveyard
Later not
Wait
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff
Forget you
My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy
You don't understand
You have been chosen
Chosen to go to the graveyard
Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay
You must believe me
You must come with me while there's still time
Time to do what
To stop the killing
To stop the vampires
Let me get this straight
You're like, this greasy bum, and  have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause 'm chosen, and there's vampires
Yes
Does Elvis talk to you
Tell you to do things
Do you see spots
don't have time for your prattling
have proof
You bear the mark
He steps forward and pulls the neck of Buffy's shirt aside, revealing her shoulder
(continuing) The mark of the Coven
The -- where's the mark
There is no birthmark on her shoulder
He looks at the other one
(continuing) The mark of the -- wait a minute
Buffy pushes his hand off her
You mean that big hairy mole
Excuse me:  eeyuu
had it removed
And, like, knowing about my big old mole isn't proof of anything except that it's way past medication time
She starts to walk away
(continuing) Just stay away from me, okay
Did you ever dream that you were someone else
Buffy stops
This obviously registers with her
Everybody does
In the past
girl
Maybe Magyar peasant
An Indian princess
slave
The last one hits the mark
was a slave
In Virginia
don't know
It was
There was a big gram or something
And there's one, 'm like a prostitute
China
Oh, my God
never told anybody about this
remember the one about the peasant, too
God, there's a bunch
Is this, like channeling or something
Merrick rolls his eyes
(continuing) had a dream once where  was
There was like, knights in it, and worked in this bar
And
was fighting
'm always fighting
And there's a guy
He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always
trying to kill me
Lothos
The name has an obvious effect on the girl
How do you know all this
have to show you
: - Thick and orange, sinking beyond the hills
- Merrick leads Buffy, searching for a particular grave
can't believe 'm doing this can't believe 'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams
Oh, yeah, tell everyone 'm crazy
Beauty ida
Buffy stops, winces slightly
(continuing) Ow
Cramps
None of your business
God
This is it
Buffy is standing on a freshly dug grave
The headstone reads: " , 1972 - 1990
"
(continuing) Robert Berman was killed three days ago
The body was found in the bushes out by the canal
Extensive tissue damage -- tearing -- at the neck and shoulders
Coroner thinks it's a dog
You sit her
He points out a plot of ground about eight feet from the foot of the grave
Buffy sits and leans against another stone
Merrick reaches into his jacket, pulls out a stake and a cross, hands the cross to Buffy
Wait a minute
Just for protection
You won't have to do anything
just need you to watch
All right
What do we do now
We wait for Robert to wake up
Merrick goes over to the other headstone, crouches by it
Do you have any gum
- The last red glimmer disappears behind the hills
: - Cassandra stands waiting for Buffy
The sun is down, darkness increasing
She looks at her watch and gives up, heads for her car
Her key in the door, she hears a  behind her
Looks slowly around
: - Buffy sits fidgeting
Playing with her fingernails
Merrick stays in the position, listening
low, almost inaudible  come from under the ground
Buffy sits up straight, holds the cross to her
The  becomes louder, almost a scream
The  is followed by the of   wood -- of   -- of digging
The moaning continues, becoming eerier, somewhat more articulate
Buffy and Merrick wait
- Finally, fingers break through the ground and hold stiff in the open air
The moan becomes a triumphant
The fingers clutch at the ground
pops halfway out of his grave like a jack-in-the- box, his face dirty and dead-white
He sees Buffy in front of him, and he bobs toward her with a crazy grin, stretching as to a mother's tit
Merrick drops down behind Robert and grabs him, raising the stake
Buffy watches, immobilized
pair of arms shoot up from the ground right under Buffy
They grab her and pull her to the ground
Next to her face, the face of another vampire, a  , emerges grinning from the crumbling earth
Buffy screams lustily, and struggles to break free
Merrick is momentarily distracted by this, and Robert throws him off, and pulls himself out of the grave
Merrick falls to the ground, and his stake goes flying
Buffy pulls herself out of the girl's grasp, starts running away, but the girl grabs her
Buffy remembers the cross in her hand, spins and holds it to the vampire's forehead
It burns and the lady lets go, screaming and falling to the ground
'Bye now
Buffy runs
- They are struggling, several feet away
Robert grabs Merrick by the shoulders and picks him up, preparing to bite him stake suddenly pops out of his chest, planted in his back by Buffy
He falls and dies
Where's the other one
She -- It leaps at her, screaming
She throws it off, as Merrick produces another stake and throws it to her
Buffy sticks it in the vampire's heart
She dies, screaming, her face still smoking, blood spurting onto Buffy
Buffy looks at herself
At the blood
: '  - Merrick walks Buffy to the door
She is silent, slow
Go to school tomorrow
Try to act normal
Don't let anyone know what's happening
This is important
When the vampires find out who you are
you won't be hunting them anymore
All right
He hands her a piece of paper
Meet me at this address after school
have cheerleading squad
Skip it
Buffy nods
Merrick starts back down the path
Merrick
Merrick stops
(continuing) They can't come in, right
Unless you invite them
Is that true
It's true
Merrick moves on
Buffy goes inside
: '  -  - Buffy shuts the door, turns to go up to her room
She is startled by someone standing in her path
She almost screams
It's her mother
She stands, arm akimbo, looking very confrontational
Buffy looks a sight, and stands uncomfortably in front of her mother for a moment
' Do you know what time it is
Uum
around ten
Mom taps her watch, annoyed
' knew this thing was slow
She crosses out of the room
' (continuing) You pay a fortune for something
(calls out) Honey, come on, we're gonna be late
Her mother gone, Buffy lets out a small sigh -- of relief or frustration, it is not clear
She heads upstairs
: '  -  - Buffy stands at the sink, washing her shirt
She tries to get the blood off with fierce intensity
She is near tears
: '  -  - She sits in the middle of the bed in her pajamas, the blankets pooled around her
She cannot sleep
Finally, she lies back on the pillow
Lothos is beside her
: - Buffy walks through the hall slowly, obviously the worse for last night's wear
Gary Murray comes up next to her, looking at his watch pointedly:  she's late for class
He moves on
Jeffrey, going the other way, stops next to her
Hey, baby, how ya doing
You look beat
do
guess  do
Where were you last night
called your house like four times
went to sleep
think  have the flu or something
Jeffrey backs away from her
can't get sick
You know -- training and all
'm gonna be late
'Bye
Jeffrey moves off to class
Buffy walks on a bit
She bumps into Nicole
Hey, Buffers
You look thrashed
Thanks
You and Cassandra get anything done last night
Buffy looks confused for a moment, then remembers
Oh
No
She never showed
: '  -   ' She is waking up, obviously from being knocked out
She blinks stupidly, looks around
She is lying by a pool of what looks to be dark water in a large cave
Torches burn around her
She tries to get up and finds it difficult
She pulls herself up to the side of the pool and splashes water on her face
It's blood
She starts, staring with growing horror at her hands
She does not even see the figure rise from the pool at first
It's Lothos
He wears no shirt, only white trousers and boots, the style maybe Nineteenth Century
No blood seems to touch him as he rises
He looks at Cassandra with an almost sleepy lust
find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many
To feel their souls coursing about me
What's happening
What do you want
(smiling) So very much
My parents have money
Yes, 'm sure they do
This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn
Cassandra turns
Amilyn stands behind her, grinning
He hisses, bares his fangs at Cassandra
What
are you
Are we so strange
So alien to you
've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste
it's truly heartwarming
The perfect place to spread my empire
Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place
It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this
this Mecca of consumption
The city of Angels
He steps right up to her
(continuing) What are we
We are man, perfected
We exist to consume
On the world "to consume" we see Amilyn mouthing the words with Lothos, his eyes to the ceiling
He's heard this a hundred times
So
Do we change this one, or do we just drain her
Cassandra pulls her gold card out of her wallet
Here, look
My gold card
It's your
'll never report it
Amilyn snatches it from her, looks it over
She has a certain quality, this one
Amilyn bites the card
don't think this is gold
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic
Almost thoughtful
She's useless
No, wait
can be dumb
Really
Or mean, or whatever
can learn
'm useful
Really
Swear to God
He rips out her throat, tearing at it with his teeth as blood gushes around their faces and she wriggle, twists, dies
He hurls her into the door and wipes blood from his mouth
wish you wouldn't mention him
Slowly Cassandra slides down the wall, her eyes glazing over
As she descends we see, stenciled on the wall, "Hemery High School
Maintenance Only
" : - Grey, dusty and long since abandoned
Sunlight pours in through the large windows, practically caked with dust
Old crates are stacked here and there, bits of manikins leaning on one or two
Merrick sits on a crate, reading the newspaper
Buffy enters hesitantly, puts down her bookbag next to a pile of Merrick's stuff, including a rolled-up sleeping bag
This is definitely not her turf
She runs her finger along a crate, picks up a world of dust
She holds up her finger at Merrick
Fire the help
No kidding
Merrick looks up at her
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes
Our purposes
She repeats it not with attitude, but a dull wonder at her connection with this strange man
She crosses to him
(continuing) What, um
What do we do
There's a great deal  have to show you, 'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time
Why do you keep saying that
Do you know what a Vampire-King is
Vampire-King
You mean like Dracula
Oh, yes
And the man from your dreams
Lothos
Oh, him
Yes
They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork
The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own
You were difficult to trace, and  think the process has gone a lot further than 'd anticipated
Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy
But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention
(not paying attention) What
(annoyed) We'll cover it later
still don't get how they happened to come to my town
mean, was born here because
because they were coming here
That Lothos guy, and his buddies
In a way, yes
Your fate is inexorably connected to them
Great
First  have a birthright, now 've got a fate
Hey, do have to take notes on this
(put down his paper) We're going to have the work hard
You'll need some excuse for staying out
For your parents
Buffy laughs
Not a pressing issue
tell you, the best thing  can do right now is find out more about you
What your strengths are, your likes
Everything
What's your best subject
Uh
gym
Yes, you used to do gymnastics
But you stopped
Why
Well, everybody says
it's just kind of dorky
mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs
They're like -- (indicating huge) -- the mighty oak
It's not a look
But you enjoyed it, yes
Well
do cheerleading now
It's way cooler
Cheerleading
For
sporting events, yes
Sporting events, yeah
All right
Why don't you show me a cheer
Here
Yes, yes
It would be interesting
nice cheer
Okay
Buffy starts, a bit awkwardly, doing a cheer
(continuing) Who we gonna beat
(pathetically following her motion) Who we gonna beat
(stops) No -- you don't have to -- Oh
thought
you lead me -- No
You don't do anything
do it
Oh
Good
She starts again
Who we gonna beat
Who do we defeat
Who will we be pulverizing Into cream of wheat
Gradually, Buffy gets more into the cheer
The steps become more complicated as she repeats the verse
- ' We see a knife slip out of Merrick's sleeve
He palms it, hands behind his back
In the middle of her routine, he hurls it at her
She catches it, reflexively, inches from her face
Stops dead
Then bursts into tears
Merrick is thrown off by this reaction
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you
You threw a knife at my head
had to test you
But you threw a knife at my head
And you caught it
Only the chosen one could have done that
don't want to be the chosen one, okay
don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires
just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die
It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but  think it's swell
And then you come along
and
and then 'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me
She is coming at him now
He begins to back up
It was necessary
(realizing) Last night
You knew  was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you
don't think you understand the full implications of -- Buffy punches him in the face
He goes flying a good ways, lands on his back
His nose bleed merrily
Buffy stops
Oh
Sorry
(getting up) Don't you see what's happening
You're changing
You've got powers you've only just begun to tap
Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of
(pulling a handkerchief out of his pocket) God, this hurts
've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working
'm sorry have to take so many shortcuts in the training process
Put your head back
Two days ago, would you have even hit me
Let alone so powerfully
No
guess  would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you
Exactly
You're changing
You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful
Buffy looks at the knife in her hand
The    and we
: Buffy's period of training
Over the difficult course of it, she is obviously becoming more self-possessed, more at ease
Her style of dress loosens a bit:  a little punkier
Stops dying her hair blonde and her roots start showing
Accumulates a few more holes in her ears
- Buffy doing a series of gymnastic flips, swinging on vines, etc
: - Buffy arriving late for class
: ' - Buffy charging some books: Lawson's Treatis on Demonology, Psychological Interpretations of Vampirism, The Book of the Dead, and The Complete Garlic Cookbook
: - Merrick sits on a crate, reading the obituaries and circling certain entries
Buffy stands on her head, sweating with concentration
The up to reveal her feet
Between the toes of one is a nail brush, with which she is very carefully painting her toenails
: (" ") - Amilyn and a few of the old-world vampires are on a spree, trying on various leather jackets
As they cavort, the behind the counter, where we find the clerk, bloody and dead, slumped on the floor
: - Buffy kissing Jeffrey goodbye after school
long, lingering kiss, during which she pulls away, anxious to get going
She starts off, comes back and plants a big ol' on his lips one last time before splitting
: - Merrick and Buffy are playing
Merrick tees off, shoots horribly
(as announcer) Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par
Your turn
Buffy positions herself
What about bats
Do they turn into bats
No
No bats, no flying
They
float, occasionally
Not really flying
Toasty
Were there ever any, like, famous vampires
Oh, several
Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn
are any of those names familiar
If  say 'no' does that make me a bad person
Good Lord
What do you study in history
My nails
She gives a little 'isn't that funny' kind of laugh
He doesn't respond
All right
You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps
Or Jack the Ripper
They were vampires
Same one
Oh
She considers this a moment
Tees off:  another hole in one
: () Buffy and Merrick sparring, working their way in between the "trees
"  She is his superior in speed and strength, but he easily trips her up
She glares at him from the ground
: - Buffy late again
Gary Murray watches her from the hall, shaking his head
: - Two college-age guys stand hitchhiking
red convertible pulls up, with a beautiful blonde behind the wheel
The guys look at each other -- all right
They can't see her teeth, or the look in her eye
: - Buffy walks in, looks around
She approaches a
Excuse me
Yes, my child
Is something troubling you
Well, sort of
Well, maybe  can help
Yeah
Um
Could you bless these
She holds up a six-pack of Perrier
: '  - We see the entire cave, the still pool of blood, the torches lit
At the far end sits Lothos
In his arms is the body of a dead girl
Blood stains her neck and yet the image is poetic, reminiscent of Michelangelo's "Pieta"
They are both perfectly still, her draped across his lap, he with his eyes far far away
The silence holds
Lothos belches massively
: - Merrick is lecturing Buffy
Buffy is sitting, doodling in an open notebook, "uh-huh"ing and obviously not paying attention
Lothos was probably born in the eleventh or twelfth century; he's been difficult to trace
His power has increased with age
It will be a long while before you are ready to face him
We'll be lucky if we can get him to leave the area, to lie low for awhile
That will scatter the rest of them
Lothos is
He looks at Buffy, who is staring down at her notebook
(continuing) is extremely powerful, but he is still a vampire, and vulnerable to the same
He looks at her
Is she listening
(continuing) Daylight is still his enemy
The stake can still find his heart
Is she
(continuing) have huge antlers growing out of my buttocks
Nope
No reaction, just another "Uh-huh
" - ' Merrick slams a stake right through the middle of it
Buffy screams, jumps back a good two feet and lands on her butt
(angry) What
Try to pay attention
: - Merrick talking
Buffy drinking coffee, trying hard to stay awake
Listening
: - Buffy in class, taking a test
Nicole leaning over, trying to cheat off her when she falls forward onto the desk, asleep
: - Buffy being ushered into Gary Murray's office
: '  - Buffy sits in his chair
Gary moves about his desk, sitting behind it, leaning on it, talking to her annoyingly about his head
Well,  think we can safely say that something's going on with you, Buffy
Now, there's nothing to be nervous about; you're not in any trouble
just hoped maybe we could talk
Don't think of me as Gary Murray, administrator
Think of me as Gary Murray, party guy
Happening dude who can talk to the young
Me and you
It's open
Tell me
It's drugs, isn't it
: - Buffy stands under a tree, blindfolded
Merrick stands a ways apart, watching
Buffy stands very still, neck craned, waiting
Silently, a leaf falls
It wafts gently down
Buffy hurls a knife at it with easy precision
- The knife stick deep into the trunk, the leaf perfectly pinned
Merrick looks at it
Buffy smiles, knowing she has hit the target
Blindfold still on, she turns toward Merrick and walks into a branch, falls heavily backwards
: '  - The same session, continuing
Buffy still sits, expressionless, in the chair
The  still
Hey, there's nothing to be afraid of
know where you're coming from
Believe me
'll tell you the truth
've had my drug experiences, too
did a lot -- did some acid in the Sixties
Well, the late Seventies, actually
It was at a Doobie Brother's concert
: - Buffy at the mall with Kimberly, Nicole and Jennifer
For the first time, we really see how she stands out against her friends
She is wearing much more functional, cool garb, and less makeup, while they still sport the same dainty shit from the beginning
They stop to look at some dresses
Something in the next store catches Buffy's eye; she wanders off
: '  - Gary Murray is crouching on his desk
Buffy still sits
The still
As Gary talks, Buffy picks up a push pin from the table beside her, holds it
and  could see the music flowing into me, it was bright red and electric, and  felt like a big toaster, and  thought, maybe  am a toaster, we're all molecules, and my friend Melissa, her head looked like a big party balloon, and that scared me,  started to freak out
Buffy surreptitiously puts the push pin in her mouth
: - The other girls are moving on from the dress shop, notice Buffy is not with them
They spot her in the next shop, urge her to come on
Buffy puts back the chain saw she was looking at, follows them
: '  - Buffy hasn't moved, or opened her mouth
The   on
Gary Murray now sits behind his desk
guess you're surprised
Well, you know, there's more to most people than meets the eye
Everybody's got a secret
just want you to know that you can always share your secrets with me
What you say in this office, it will stay in this office
'm your pal
Buffy smiles at Gary
As he looks away for a second, Buffy spits out the push pin
The
: - Buffy sparring with Merrick again
She holds a stake
This time she ends up pinning him, the stake at his solar plexus
He moves the point to where his heart would be
: '  - The room is a shambles
Outside the first floor window, it is dark night
"Help Yourself" by the Posies blasts from Pike's Pike lies on his bed
Through the window we see Benny approach, slowly fading up to the pane
He's floating, really
(He's a vampire
)  He scrapes his fingers on the glass
Pike
Pike sits up, turns down the music
He goes to the window, begins to try to open it
It's stuck
Benny, man, where you been
You bailed on me,  passed out, man, almost did a Jimi Hendrix
Let me in
Hey, 'm trying, but this window is burnt -- Pike gets a good look at Benny for the first time
Invite me in, Pike
Wait a minute
What's wrong with you, man
'm fine
You look like shit, Benny
Benny grins, presses his slimy forehead against the glass
feel
pretty
No offense, man, but  think you're on something nasty
Why don't you just go and cool out and 'll see you in the morning or something
The sun
It burns
It burns
He laughs at his impression, brown spittle caking the window
(continuing) Let me in, Pike
'm hungry
Get away from here
'm hungry
mean it
Benny smiles, moves suddenly out of sight
Pike looks at the window for a second, then bolts out of his room
He runs to the front door, frantically hooks the chain
Benny appears at the door's little window, banging and scraping the glass
'm hungry
'm hungry
'm hungry
Pike backs away
: - Buffy walks slowly down the street, trying to appear nonchalant, but looking about her a lot
Sure is cold
What a dark night
Nice night for a walk
She whistles some, keeps walking
(continuing) 'Feelings, la la la la feelings'
Boy, 'm helpless
She passes an alley and there is a  amid the garbage cans
She moves slowly down the alley toward the noise
She is about halfway down when a rat scurries out from the cans and down a drain
(continuing) Yeucch
Behind her, another
She turns slowly
At the entrance to the alley stands a vampire
They stare at each other, some thirty feet away
(continuing) Hello
She moves back a step
The vampire takes a step
(continuing) What do you want
It floats rapidly at her, hissing
Buffy looks about her frantically, trapped
It hits her at top speed and she instantly rolls onto her back, flipping it and hurling it against the wall at the end of the alley
As it hits, Buffy, still rolling, produces a stake from her jacket and throws it directly at its heart
The stake punctures the startled creature's chest
Before he can so much as grab it, Buffy throws a roundhouse kick, driving the stake all the way home with her foot
The vampire screams, sinks to the ground
Buffy turns, triumphant
(continuing) Toaster-caked him
- hand stops it
It is Merrick, who steps into the alley and stares at Buffy
: - The two exit Merrick's car, an old Dodge Dart
As they talk, they make their way into the warehouse
Buffy looks out for trouble while Merrick unlocks the door
This is obviously their routine
He was slow
Very simple
They won't all be that easy
Fine
And the alley was a mistake
Never corner yourself like that
If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now
One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you
You felt a little sick, didn't you
The cramps
They enter the warehouse
: - They unload their stuff as they argue
Nice conversationalist
Yeah, felt 'em a little, but  ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject
It's natural
reaction to their presence, to the
unnaturalness of it
It's part of how you are able to track them
Oh, wonderful
My secret weapon is - That's just great
Thanks for telling me
You'll get used to it
'm more worried about your tactical mistakes
You are such a wet
what
wet
Didn't  just kill that vampire
think  did
didn't see you killing any vampires
You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'
Don't start with me again
Aren't , like the chosen one
The one and only
The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me
Like, ever
Buffy
And why are you always wearing black
It's so down
It's totally not your color
don't think you have a color
What do you want
Encouragement
(in bad American accent) 'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, just want to give you a great big hug, oh 'm just having a warm fuzzy
' Oh, fuck you
Merrick turns on her
Do you know how many girls 've trained to be Slayers
Five
Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and  saw them ripped apart
Do you want to live
Do you
What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer
Buffy looks at him a bit
Five
Five
So, basically, 've got the life expectancy of a zit, right
Not if you're careful
How can you keep doing this
It's what  was raised to do
There aren't many of us left, the Watchers
Watchers
There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge
(sees she doesn't know it) near a bunch of big rocks
That's where  was born
My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs
There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really
most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies
thought so myself for a time, when  was younger
(stops himself) 'm sorry
'm not supposed to
shouldn't go on like this
wish you would
It isn't important
'm curious, is all
Buffy, don't
don't start thinking of me as your friend
It interferes with the work, and it
And it makes it worse when  die, right
Silence
(continuing) Well, you know, 'm not gonna kick so easy
've got a few things the other girls didn't have
As for example, what
Well
there's my keen fashion sense, for one
Vampires of the world, beware
(impressed) Merrick
You made a joke
Are you okay,  mean, do you want to lie down
know it hurts the first time
In spite of himself, Merrick smiles
: - Buffy, Nicole, Kimberly, and Jennifer are walking down the hall
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels
Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something
Like dealing
Well,  hope so
Probably was
What do you suppose she was doing out there
Dying
Eeyuu
Coming from the opposite direction are Jeffrey, Andy and some of the other football players
They're suited up and heading for the gym
And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow
You going
don't know
Coach said  had to work on my 'ab's
' Coach knows what abs are
They pass Buffy
Andy stops and grabs her from behind
(continuing) Got to get some
Unthinkingly, Buffy flips Andy over and pins him against a locker
(continuing) Whoa
Whoa
'm sorry
'm sorry
don't actually need any right now
(to Buffy) What's with you
Don't grab me, okay
Absolutely
see now the error of my mistake
Yeah, keep your mitts off my thang
'll pop you one
(to Buffy) Did he scare you
Jeffrey puts his arm around Buffy but she shakes it off
can take care of myself, Jeffrey
So  noticed
Buffy goes off by herself
Jeffrey watches her
(continuing) Nice to feel needed
Let's move out
(rallying) Yes
The lads move off
We see Nicole, Kimberly and Jennifer, who have been watching the whole exchange
Nicole and Kimberly are obviously disdainful of Buffy's behavior
Jennifer is feeling sorry for Jeffrey
Boy does she want him
: - mod, brightly lit store
little hipper than your usual mall fare, but not Melrose either
Bright colors reign
Buffy is standing by a dressing stall, inspecting her fingernails, talking to Merrick as he changes inside
mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of
'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what  mean
Lately it bugs me, guess
(no response) Merrick
Are you still breathing
(
) (from inside) can't work this
We call them zippers
They're not supposed to be a challenge
But it's in the back
Why are we wasting time with this, anyway
Because you clash, Merrick
You clash with everything
mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her
'  Honestly, you look like something out of
Pasadena
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable
Well, you're on my turf now
You're just gonna have to trust me
Merrick comes out of the booth
He wears multi-colored parachute pants and an equally loud -shirt
Buffy looks at him -- he looks at himself
want to die
(doesn't like it either) Okay
The important thing is not to panic
: '   - Pike is hurriedly working on a part in the hood of his beat-up Dodge, which is filled with all his belongings
stands watching him
Zeph is about forty-five, greasy, good-natured
Pike works for him
You said you'd have the part by two
Christ, it's almost dark
Pike finishes, slams the hood
He picks up a battered guitar case and stuffs it into the car, shuts the door
What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going
'm leaving, man
'm bailing town
This place has gotten way too hairy
Where am  gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money
Hey, have you seen Benny lately
No
You want me to give him a message
You should think about leaving, too, man
Sell this place
Something's going on here
don't know
Something real weird
Pike gets in the car
It sputter, starts
Ah, you'll be coming back
don't think so
All right
Take care of yourself
am
Hey
What should  do if  see Benny
Run
Pike peels out
Zeph watches him go
That's my guitar
- burning down
: '  - On the edge of town
The car has stalled at an intersection
Pike is hunched over the wheel, his head down as he listens to the rasping
Come on, come on
Don't leave me, baby
Come on, breathe
Amilyn appears in the street in front of the car
Pike finally hears the     as he approaches the car
Pike straightens up slowly, and as the rear view mirror comes , we see there are two more behind him
They are both high-school age, fresh like Bessel and Benny
They all approach, slowly
Pike waits for a second, his hand on the key
(continuing) This is for the money, baby
Make me proud
He turns the key again and the car  to life
The headlights trap the hungry scowl of the vampires as Pike pops the car in reverse, smashing into the back two vampires
They both go flying, hurt but not killed
- Pike races at Amilyn, but he leaps up as Pike reaches him, and Pike hears a  as Amilyn lands on the roof of his car
Pike continues to bullet down the street as a hand suddenly punches through the roof, grabbing at him
He fights off the hand and tries to control the speeding car
It can't be done:  he goes off the road and into a park
The car careens along
- Amilyn ride it, laughing
- Pike spots a tree with a low branch and heads for it
Still fighting, he aims at the branch
It gets closer
- Amilyn looks up
- They pass under the branch and we hear a
The arm stiffens and falls into Pike's lap
The car hits another tree dead on
Pike slams into the steering wheel
The guitar case flies right through the windshield and lands on the grass
Pike pulls himself slowly from the car
He is bleeding, but not badly
Just shaken
He hears a low, seething  from a few yards back and turns around
Amilyn is getting shakily to his feet
Oh, give me a break
Amilyn hisses at him, then turns and races away, snarling, clutching what's left of his arm
One of the other vampires nears him
Pike tries to run and his knees buckle
He lands on them right next to the guitar case
As the vampire nears, he pulls the guitar out of the case and swings it, hitting the vampire in the head
He hits him again
The vampire bats away the guitar and grabs Pike
Brings his face to Pike's as Pike squirms
blasting kick in the head from Buffy
The vampire is flung to one side, falls
He starts up at Buffy and she nails him with a stake
Pike stares at her
She pulls a walkie-talkie from her pocket
(into walkie-talkie) 'm on the east side, near the playground
all right
She puts the walkie-talkie back
(continuing) Hi
Hi there
Is that your car
It was
think it's pretty much ready for the -- The last vampire hits Pike from behind
Without missing a beat, Buffy picks up the guitar and snaps the neck off
She and the vampire meet in the middle -- the creature barely moves before she buries the guitar neck in its chest
It falls
Merrick runs up
He is wearing black jeans and a windbreaker
He is more modern than he was before, but subtly
He sees the decaying bodies, one with a guitar sticking out of its chest
Interesting
kind of had to improvise
(to Pike) Sorry about your guitar
That's okay
Umm, listen, 'm not
have to fall down now
Pike's eyes glaze over slightly as he collapses into Buffy's arms
: -    - Thrashing about the room in hysterics, screaming and snarling, banging his one fist on the boiler tank
It booms hollowly
Lothos grabs him, throws him up against the wall
What's wrong with you
My arm
He took my fucking arm
Shut up
You let him have it
Lothos lets Amilyn go
Amilyn still fumes, quietly
(continuing) You reckless imbecile
This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself
twelve hundred years old and you act like a child
had him in my grasp
Cheer up
You may still
Only Lothos smiles at the joke
Amilyn raises his stump, looks at it
The tattered end of his jacket covers the grossness of it, but it still isn't good
(forlornly) look horrible
The other two -- the new ones
Where are they
don't know
But the boy, he couldn't kill them
(thoughtfully) No
Not a boy
(gathers himself) Find out if they're dead
And do something about that arm
Honestly, don't know how you made it through the Crusades
He turns toward his chamber
(continuing) Let me know about our little recruits
'll be in my chamber
On his way through the door he passes a box on an oil drum
He plucks a large kitten out of it
(continuing) having a snack
: '  - Buffy and Pike walk in, Pike still a bit unsteady on his feet
How are you doing
Oh, 'm good
'm good
Kind of miss my knees, though
You want some water or something
Water
Okay
They move into the kitchen
(continuing) Do you do this kind of thing a lot
mean, is this like a hobby
Not exactly
They were vampires, weren't they
Yeah
God
Unbelievable
Vampires
Buffy hands Pike the water and they move back into the living room
Pike curls up in an armchair by the window
Buffy begins stripping off her bloody clothes, leaving on a tank-top and jeans
You had a car full of stuff
Were you leaving
Yeah,  was bailing
have a friend, and he's really
well, he's really vampire,  guess
Bad scene
Well, stay here tonight
Thanks
Tomorrow morning, 'm on a bus
'm gone
Where are you gonna go
Well, 've always wanted to see Oxnard
As Buffy strips down to her tank top, she notices a gash on her arm
It's not bleeding much any more, but it's fairly impressive
Pike jumps up to help as she pats it down with her shirt
(continuing) Hey, jeez are you okay
You need a hand
It's nothing
It doesn't hurt
Pike looks at her a moment as she wraps her shirt around it
(almost awed) Who are you
Buffy doesn't look up
The questions seems to upset her a great deal
She even fights back tears
(continuing) 'm sorry,  just mean
well you seemed like such a flake
But, in a good way
can just keep talking till you strike me dead, or
Buffy smiles at this, though still upset
She sits down
Things are kind of confusing
'll back that up
Three weeks ago all  thought about was
well,  didn't actually think about anything
definitely didn't expect this
know
My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires
'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead
It's weird
went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff
went back and it was so tiny, the whole place
couldn't even fit on the swings
Everything just looked so small
(collects herself) 'm sorry
'm babbling
No, you're not
But she stands anyway, head to the stairs
'm kinda beat
You can stay in my mom's room if you want
think 'll just hang out here
Make sure the sun comes up and everything
You sure
Oh, 'll be fine
Got my chair, got my window, 'm great
Mmkay
She starts up the stairs
Hey, Buffy
Yeah
You know, you saved my life
And just wanted to say
forgive you for talking during the movie
Almost
She gives him a look, heads upstairs
He watches her go, looks out the window
: bus is pulling out
We see Pike through the window, looking comtemplative
He watches the terminal disappear
' The streets move by
On one there is a Police Officer talking to a hysterical Man
Next to them is a body, covered by a sheet
: - Buffy and Merrick are walking along the path to the steps of the main building, arguing
Merrick is wearing casual California gear, but again, very subdued
There isn't time
Make time, okay
You're the one who told me to act normal
've missed three practices already
If 'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk
Another distraction
It's not right
Why because it's not my fate
It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that 'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it
Your fate
'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore
Come on, Merrick
Football
Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left
All right
Toasty
You should come; it's gonna be a great game
Oh, 'll be there all right
'm not letting you out of my sight
Not till you're ready
Try and be inconspicuous, okay
Act like a fan
(being a fan) Football is my life
You're learning
Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning
She turns to go
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble
And where are they now
She smiles at him and runs up the steps, where Jeffrey is waiting for her
He looks at the departing figure of Merrick
So that's your tutor, huh
What is he, like, your boyfriend now
Jeffrey
Projectile vomit
They enter the building together
: - Right before the game
The scoreboard reads "Hemery vs Barber"
Fans fill the stands
We see Buffy with the other cheerleaders
She's really into it, enjoying herself as they all rally the crowd
We see Merrick taking a seat
He is wearing another new outfit -- a letterman jacket and baseball cap
He has binoculars around his neck
He takes his seat amidst the teens
Real inconspicuous
: - The coach is giving players his pep talk
Some people say winning is a state of mind
Can't win out there if you don't win -- (point to his head) -- in here
say, winning isn't a state of mind
say winning is having more points
And how do we get point
By putting the thing, the ball over the
in the place
End zone
Right
So  don't care about your minds
Maybe you're tired
Maybe you're worried about your grades
Maybe you dog just died or you've suddenly found that you're attracted to other men
don't care
'Cause we're a team
And there only on thing that matters to a team
What that
Winning
And how do we win
By putting the thing in the place
So let's go
Yeahh
They run out, full of fire
The coach turns to one player, whose face we cannot see
There you are
You missed practice again
You're benched till the fourth, um, the fourth part
Now get out there
Coach heads out
The player turns around, smiles after him
It's Grueller
: - The players run out toward the field, yelling
The last of them is Grueller
He floats behind them slowly, grinning and speaking in a passionless voice, again as if he were repeating words phonetically
Go team
Rah
Go team go
: () Fourth quarter
The scoreboard read "Hemery: 17, Barber: 21"
Fifty seconds left
Two
Four
Six
Eight
Who do we emasculate
Barber
Barber
Yay
On the sidelines, a player hobbles out and coach pushes Grueller in
He passes Buffy and she winces slightly
It messes up the routine and Nicole practically falls over her
Buffy, Jesus
You know these steps
Sorry
Buffy starts cheering again as the players huddle
- He is watching Buffy through his binoculars
nudges him
Hey, can  borrow your binoculars, man
(without looking around) No
You're checking out the cheerleaders
All right
Buffy, man
Merrick does turn
What about her
Everybody knows about her, man
Knows what about her
The teen leans closer
She's had sex
He nods at Merrick; "You know what  mean"
Merrick turns back
'm on the wrong bloody side
- The players are lined up
Grueller, at left tackle, smiles at the player facing him, growls
The player looks worried
Twenty-three
Thirty-two
Hike
The players scramble as Andy hands off
The carrier gets a few yards
When the pileup on the line of scrimmage peels apart, the player that had been facing Grueller is unconscious
As he is carted off the field, Grueller gleefully trots back to the huddle
- Watching the game, a little perplexed
- Merrick watches Buffy
- The coach yells at the players
Come on
Do the thing
Where you
go towards the guy
Come one
Throw the thing
- Smiling, listening to Andy call the play
- Kimberly sits, complaining to no one in particular
What are they doing
The clock's running out
(shouts) Throw the ball
She sits back, turns to her neighbor
Are they so brain-dead
Her neighbor smiles at her
He is a vampire, and he speaks in the same monotone that Grueller used
He waves a pennant
Rah
- The players are lined up again
Grueller is drooling
The other team is really worried about him now
The snap
Andy drops back and lobs it to Jeffrey
Jeffrey is way open
He catches it easily, looks behind him as he runs
Barber players are rushing at him
And Grueller is coming at him too, throwing other players right and left
Jeffrey looks a little worried
He bolts down field, toward the end zone, Grueller on his heels
- She sees something is definitely wrong
Jeffrey
In a flash, she races onto the field
Buffy
What is she
- He stands, his eyes following Buffy
- She also see Buffy
Oh, wow
She's really lost it
Party hearty
Everybody rises to their feet and cheers as Jeffrey makes it to the end zone
- Two, one, zero
- Grueller hits Jeffrey a second before he is enveloped by other players
Grueller, hungry with bloodlust, is confused by the exultant crowd, snarling at people
Buffy races for the crowd
She sees Jeffrey is all right
Grueller makes his way out of the throng and up into the stands even as everyone else is rushing onto the field
Jeffrey is triumphant
He sees Buffy running for him and raises his arms
She passes him right by and continues after Grueller, heads up the stands
He looks after her, confused, before he is swamped again
- He tries to make his way through the crowd
- Grueller reaches them and leaps over the back
Buffy sees him, runs up and without hesitation, dives off herself
The stands reach some thirty feet off the ground
Buffy sails down like a diver, grabs a branch about halfway down
She swings like a gymnast and the branch snaps
Still holding the broken branch, she completes a perfect flip and lands on her feet
The vampire fan is on the ground behind her, come for her and without stopping or even turning she twirls the branch and sinks the broken end in his heart
She looks around for Grueller
He is booking out, already several yards away
Merrick appears at the top of the stands just in time to see Buffy take off after Grueller
Wait
(calls as she runs) He knows who  am
She continues to race after Grueller
- Running back down the stands, making his way through the dispersing crowd to the nearest exit
: - Buffy is still following, but she can't keep up
She spot a tooling along the street on a Harley
She comes up to the side of the road and tentatively sticks her thumb out
The biker smiles, stops in front of her
- Ground level, behind the bike, we see its engine revving, smoke puffing from twin pipes
Hey, babe
You want to get some real power between your legs
Buffy looks at the biker a moment
- The same angle as before, ground level
Suddenly the biker's body lands in front of - spinning - revving the engine
Buffy takes off at top speed
Dyke
You're a dyke
'm telling the world
: ( ) in the trees signifies Grueller's flight
Seconds late, Buffy roars into view behind him
She navigates the streets with less ease than determination
Her eyes follow him off the road and she steers the bike on a violently bumpy and erratic course through the site
She finally hits a pile of bricks and is thrown headlong from the bike
She hits the ground hard; she rolls into it but has trouble getting up
' Grueller's smiling face appears over her
Fall down go boom have to see the nurse
(
) Grueller, God, what did they do you
He brings his face right next to hers
His voice is no longer passionless; it boils up from hell
They killed me
He grabs her and hauls her up
No kidding
She head-butts him with enormous force, sending him staggering back
Before he can recover, she dives for a pile of discarded lumber, chooses a nasty shard of wood
She turns on Grueller, who is smiling again
There are two more Vampires approaching her, surrounding her
The Master walks tonight
This is his kingdom, now
They rush her
She takes one on as the second hits her, knocking her over
They all three swarm over her, meeting her kicks with raking claws
The two hold her in front of Grueller
(continuing) You know, Buffy, 've always wanted you
He smiles again and leans toward her neck
The stake that pops out through his chest is as much a surprise to him as it is to Buffy
He falls backward, shocked and dead
Behind him stands Pike
One of the other vampires stupidly goes after Pike, who runs away
Buffy instantly flips the other one over onto Grueller, impaling him as well
Pike runs more or less in a circle, yelling, the vampire at his heels
didn't mean it
didn't mean it
Wooden shard in hand, Buffy sprints toward them, jumps into a series of flips
She lands with her legs around the vampire's shoulders, plants the stake in its heart as they topple onto Pike
For a moment, Pike and Buffy lie on top of each other, breathing hard
Then they get up awkwardly, embarrassed by their touching, (and by their slight arousal)
didn't expect to see you
know
Why'd you come back
don't know
kind of thought ought to be here
You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from
Thanks
Besides, Oxnard sucks
They start out of the site
(continuing) Listen,
really do want to help
mean, these guys are dag nasty, and somewhere my best friend is out there, and 'd like to, don't know
Even the score
Do some damage
'm good with damage
- ' She drives by, see Buffy with Pike
It's an eyebrow-raiser, but she keeps driving
Pike,  don't think you're up to this
think  could help
You gonna tell me you don't need help
: - Merrick runs up to the street where Buffy took the Harley
He has shed the raccoon coat
The biker is still there, standing in the road trying to thumb a ride
Did you see a girl come by here
You don't mean, like, a cheerleader
Yes
Yeah,  saw her
Bitch took my wheels
Wheels
My bike
She's a lesbian, too
She told me
Which way did she go
Down there
He points
The   with Merrick as he takes a step in that direction, leaving the biker behind (and momentarily )
Idiot girl
Can't watch over her
How long ago did -- The   back with Merrick as he turns to the biker, but in his place stands Lothos
Not five feet from Merrick
Oh, my God
- On his knees, Lothos' hand firmly locked around his throat
He cannot move or breathe
Merrick and Lothos look at each other a moment
It's a beautiful night
have never understood the human tendency to equate darkness with emptiness
To me the black is so thick with life, like soil
like blood
Darkness writhes under my eye
He looks at the night
Merrick slowly reaches for a gun stuck in the back of his pants as Lothos continues
(continuing) know who you are
She's out her, as well, isn't she
Another Slayer
Who is it this time
What offering have you brought me
-    - She is crouching on the ground, holding her stomach and gritting her teeth
Buffy
What's wrong
Oh, God
It's him
think it's him
Who
(not answering) Merrick
Buffy ups and runs in the direction of the noise
Calls back to Pike
(continuing) Stay here
She runs out of sight
: -     - Lothos lets him go and he falls, dead
It doesn't really matter
The names, the faces, they all melt together
After a time, there really is no difference
One more pathetic bitch, begging for me to suck on her clotted heart
This one may surprise you
- Merrick holds it firm behind his back, finger on the trigger
rather doubt it, if she was raised here
He laughs
He doesn't appear to have noticed the gun, but: (continuing) Where is she
can't wait to meet her
Do you think she's ready to face me
Or perhaps you can stop me with that gun
Perhaps
Merrick looks out at the trees nearby
' Buffy appears, far away, between the trees
Merrick looks at Lothos, afraid he will notice
- Approaching, stopping some twenty yards away
She looks about her for a weapon
Look at you
You pathetic thing
So small, so full of fury
After you've served me for a hundred years, think you'll have a little more perspective
don't think so
Lothos rushes suddenly at Merrick, hissing, his feet just off the ground
Merrick steps back, whips out the , and himself without hesitation in the head
Buffy's eyes go wide
Lothos growls, holding Merrick's spurting corpse
small, involuntary noise escapes Buffy
- Even twenty yards away, he hears
He spins and stares, starest at
Listening
Buffy walks slowly, silently backward, fading back into the dark, terrified and shocked
Lothos turns back and looks at Merrick dead in his hands
Disgusted, he lets him drop
Fool
He looks at the blood on his fingers
After a moment, he tastes it
: () Pike is standing by the trees where Buffy stood before, looking out into the street
' The same angle as Buffy's, before
Now Lothos is gone
Buffy is kneeling quietly by Merrick, holding his head in her lap
: - Through the dark mist Buffy appears, carrying Merrick's body in her arms
She is alone
She does not stop
: - On the outskirts of the graveyard, Buffy finishes filling in Merrick's grave under an old tree
She is still wearing her cheerleader outfit, now caked with dirt
She stands at the foot of the grave, tries to think of a prayer
Ummm, our Father, Who art in Heaven, duhmm
hallowed be Thy name
Uhh, kingdom come, daily break, don't know
don't even know if you're religious
You probably are
But you're dead, you know
You're just totally dead
and
She sits heavily on his grave
(continuing) and  don't know what to do
You were the one who
don't know if the training was over don't even know if  passed
You're so stupid
How could you be so stupid
What am  supposed to do without you
You son of a bitch
She stops, looks down for a moment
(continuing) Amen
: '   - Pike is at work on a contraption
Built out of scraps and parts, it is the beginnings of a cartridge-load crossbow
Zeph watches, behind him
Hah, 'd knew you'd be back
Didn't say you'd be back
Ha, ha, ha
You're sitting in your old car saying 'Nope, 'm never coming back
' Hee, Hee
Like you got anywhere to go
''m never coming back'  But knew you would
Birds got to return to the nest sooner or later
That's what  said
Just like  told you
Pike pays no attention to this babbling monologue
Over the course of it he takes a slim, handmade wooden shaft, slightly thicker than an arrow, and rubs it with garlic
He places it in the crossbow, take aim in front of him
He fires into the tire of a truck
The tire pops flat
Zeph cracks up
(continuing) Hah
Shot the damn tire, dumbass, didn't even look, just going around shooting things, popped it flat, ya bonehead
Pike, still not listening, continues to work
: - We see a banner stretched across the central beam of the ceiling
It reads "    "
half dozen inflatable globes dangle from the ceiling
Nicole and Kimberly are stetting up the drinks table, unloading and stacking hundreds of styrofoam cups
Jennifer crosses by them, carrying an armful of plastic wrappings and containers
got all the plastic stuff
What should  do with it
("you idiot") Throw it out
Jennifer crosses out as the two resume their conversation
really was way way too too
Oh, please
When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game
Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did  blink
'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing
'  And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey
'  Way mental
They laugh
Jennifer is the first to see Buffy walk in, looking cleaned-up but still ragged
They stop laughing
Hi, Buffy
Hi, guys
You were supposed to be here at three
forgot
Buffy, what is your sitch
You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird
Look, a lot's been going on
That's what  wanted to tell you guys about
need to tell you
You see
a while ago,  met this guy -- Oh my God you're having an affair
Cool
Does Jeffrey know
It's not that at all
This is an old guy, he's like fifty
/ Eeyuu
No, no
Listen
Haven't you guys noticed how weird things have gotten around here
Like, people disappearing, people turning up dead
What are you talking about
Weird
You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke saw you last night after the game
Pike
You're having a fling with him
He doesn't look fifty
Guys
Guys
Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago
Oh, thank you very much
Like you've got a grip
You're so out of it
You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee -- Excuse me for having something important to do
This isn't important
The earth is our home
Kimberly, it's a dance
It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that  see every stupid day
So, we're stupid now
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it
This isn't just any dance
It happens ot be the last dance of our last year
Except for Prom
Right
And Spring Fling
Okay
And the January Semi-formal -- Okay
Look, Buffy
You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine
But personally, think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing
really do
Listen to you
What language are you speaking
Get out of my facial
She storms out
Well,  guess you got what you came for
Nicole
Later for it
She also leaves, with Jennifer
Buffy stands alone in the room, small amidst the streamers
: '  - Buffy stands at the sink, rinsing a glass for way too long, staring
Her mother breezes
' Dinner's in the fridge, stay away from the Jag, we'll be back by twelve
She stops, seems to notice something about Buffy
' (continuing) Buffy, honey
(wanting to talk) Yeah
' Have you gained a few pounds
Maybe it's that outfit
Maybe
' What's Bobby gonna say
don't know, Mom; 've never met Bobby
' (laughs) Aren't we the chatty ones
Kiss noise
And she's out
Buffy looks at her clothes, herself
: - Pike drives slowly between the cars
He sees Buffy walking toward the mall
He pulls up by her, parks
Gets out of the car
Buffy, hey, 've been looking all over for you
Buffy doesn't stop
He paces her
(continuing) been working on some stuff for you
What'cha doing
'm going shopping
Don't try to stop me
Cool
could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches
What do you need
dress
Dress, huh
What for
For the dance
Come again
'm going to the senior dance
(charades) Second word
sound like 'dance'
She stops
'm going to the dance
What for
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends
Comprende
don't believe this
The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer
It's not a mixer
It's the senior dance
And it's important
You wouldn't understand
You got that right
thought you wanted to kill vampires
don't want to kill anybody, and don't want to talk about it anymore
Listen,  know you're bummed about your friend, and 'm really sorry
(offhand, almost disdainful) He did what he was supposed to
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy
Right
'm the chosen one
And choose to be shopping
should have known
Buffy raises her fist at him; he starts back, involuntarily
Leave me alone
Benny was right
You guys are all exactly the same
Buffy walks away, leaving Pike alone
(continuing; calls after her) 'm not disappointed, 'm just angry
As Pike walks off, the camera   the lamp post behind them
Benny is perched upon it
Buffy
Buffy
: - Vampires are gathered around
Lothos stands with Benny
Benny is beaming
Buffy
Lothos laughs, long and hard
: - Buffy looks at dresses, most of them fairly tight and fairly out there
She holds one in front of her, looks in a mirror
: '   - Pike sits, fiddling with his crossbow
Looks out the window, discontented
Laid out next to him we see wooden shafts, garlic, and a cross
: '  -  - Buffy lays her dress on the bed
We cannot see exactly what it looks like
She stuffs some blood-stained clothes into a duffel bag along with some stakes
She tosses the bag in the closet
: - Dozens of limos pull up
Kids pour inside
: - The party is underway
Streamers everywhere, tables by the windows
Couples dance, a
spins the tunes
There is a setup in one corner for taking prom pictures
The kids are all very elegant and hip
Every shade of black is represented
- Nicole and Kimberly stand by the punch bowl, chatting
They are both wearing slinky little black dresses
- There are two: at one end, leading to the house (it's closed) and one leading outside
Gary Murray stands by the outside door, on guard, as students enter
He is looking disdainfully at Andy and holding a flask he has confiscated
Well, it came with the tux
Buffy enters the gym
She is wearing a long white strapless gown
It is lovely, but very conservative for this crowd
Over her shoulder is a purse that goes with the dress
She enters hesitantly, looking around her for Jeffrey
She passes Andy, who is moving away from Gary Murray
Buffy
Looking tasty
Thanks
Have you seen Jeffrey
But Andy has moved on
Buffy works her way through the crowd to the punch bowl, sees Nicole and Kimberly
They stop whispering real quick
(continuing) Hi, guys
Hi
Have you guys seen Jeffrey
The limo never showed,  thought he might be here
Nicole and Kimberly look at each other significantly
haven't seen him tonight
Oh
She picks up a glass of punch
(continuing) 'm glad you guys are here
It's good to see you
(miss sarcasm) Yeah, whoops  came
(tries again) You look way pretty, Kim
know
like your little outfit
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch
As long as there's room for three in it
What, didn't you bring your new friends
Buffy is startled by this attack
Nicole giggles
guess you guys are mad at me
'm sorry
've been really -- Jeffrey suddenly appears between them
Jennifer is on his arm
(continuing) Jeffrey
There you are
-- She stops, as everybody assesses the situation
Buffy is shocked, doing a slow fade to hurt
Jeffrey is uncomfortable
Jennifer is apoplectic with embarrassment
Kimberly is in serious giggle, Nicole a bit more restrained, checking it out
Buffy, what are you doing here
thought we were meeting here
'm here with Jenny
-- who is practically hyperventilating, pulling at his arm like a dog on a leash
don't understand
Oh, come on, Buffy
You know what's going on
It's not working out at all
've got to move on
mean, 've got needs, too
told you about all this
No, you didn't
When
Didn't you get my message
You broke up with my machine
You weren't home
Like always
You left me a message
'm out of here
Jenny
At the mention of her name Jenny jumps, and in her haste to get away, she bumps into Buffy's arm, spilling bright red punch on Buffy's chest
She flees, Jeffrey in tow
They leave the gym
Kimberly finds it all pretty funny
Nicole is silent
Buffy turns away, toward the wall
soft  come on over the
Tears are forming in Buffy's eyes, as she wipes futilely at her dress
Finally she turns, looks toward the door
' Pike is there, walking in on his own
He wears a leather jacket and baggy old tux pants, accented by chains, earring and unlaced Doc Martins
He looks great
He walks directly toward Buffy, and does turn a few heads
crashed your party
Pretty shallow of you
That's me
'm glad you came
Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time
Pike picks up a glass of punch as he notices the stain on Buffy's dress
He looks about him a bit, then without hesitation dumps some punch on his lapel, matching stains
Buffy smiles at him
(continuing) Will  get the shit kicked out of me if  ask you to dance
don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice
They begin slow dancing, not too close
Yeah, well, you're the one 'm afraid of
They dance for a while, closer and closer
(continuing; gee-whizzically) You know, you're not like the other girls
Buffy pulls him closer, holds him, whispers almost weakly in his ear
Yes,  am
We see couples dancing, kissing
Gary Murray watching them
- Sitting by the window with her bovine date, she watches Buffy dance disdainfully
can't believe it
The window  by her head, a vampire's hand reaching for her
She screams, starts back
Other windows shatter, vampires appearing all around
couple of students run for the inner door but it is locked shut from the other side
Gradually the party stops as everybody becomes aware of the situation
They vaguely herd to the middle of the room
- Looking around, assessing the situation
- runs staggering in, blood spurting from his neck
They're out there
They're vampires
God, help me
He falls to the ground, a few feet in front of the doorway
Nobody moves for a second
Then one of the students starts toward the body
Don't go near the door
Buffy does instead, checking the lifeless body and listening as a number of figures begin to lumber toward the door through the mist
Buffy steps back as three 17-year-old vampire come to the door
1ST It's party time
Don't worry
They can't come in here
They can't come in unless they're invited
already invited them
Everyone looks at her
(continuing; defensively) They're seniors
Pike reaches into an inner pocket and pulls out a number of small stakes he has made, hands them to Buffy
She opens her purse
- Cosmetics, hair spray, etc
She fits the stakes in
The first thing we should -- 1ST Buffy
You wanna dance
(to Buffy) Looks like you're busted
2ND We want her
We want Buffy
Send her out
1ST Or we come in
They fade back, almost out of sight
Pike looks out the window
More are gathering
All right, everybody stay calm
(to Buffy) What's going on
Looks bad, Buffy
Send her out
What
They'll kill us
She's the one they're mad at
Yeah
Send her out
Everybody be quiet
What, are you kidding
They'll kill her
They'll kill us
(moving toward Kimberly, fist raised) You want some punch
got detention slips here, 'm not afraid to use them
But other students have picked up the cry, are clamoring to sacrifice Buffy
Pike crosses to his bag, sitting by the door
Two guys move toward Buffy, Andy intervenes
Pike steps in front of Buffy, holding his custom made cartridge-load crossbow
Trains it on the others
They quiet down
There's gotta be a back way out of here, or something
Buffy looks at the partygoers
Her friends
They stare back at her, scared, angry
She looks out the door
Back at her friends
'm going out the front
Are you nuts, Buffy
There's a hundred of them out there
They'll rip us apart
You're staying here
(before he can speak) Some of them might not come after me
If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain
You say that like it's a bad thing
Buffy, this is crazy
What do these guys want
Andy, start breaking up some chairs
You'll need weapons
Andy looks at her a moment, moves off
Buffy goes to Pike's bag, starts pulling out stakes
(continuing) Good thing one of us was prepared
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone
Buffy stands up
She kisses Pike very hard on the lips
Don't piss me off
She kneels down, begins to rip the hem of her dress
: - We see the doorway to the gym
mist has risen around the entire house, swirling about the feet of the undead who stand clustered about it
Some have keen and eager expressions, some vacant, half-conscious with bloodlust
They wait
figure appears in the doorway, walking slowly out
Buffy
Her torn dress now comes to just above her knees
She wears Pike's leather jacket over it
She wears her purse strapped across her chest under the jacket
In one hand she holds his crossbow; in her other hand is a cross
As she steps further away from the doorway, the vampires slowly begin to close around her
The door shuts behind her
: - Kimberly and some of the others are anxiously barricading the door
Pike looks out the window after Buffy
(to himself) Come on, move
: - The vampires move closer and closer
They circle her
She waits, apprehensive
When they are about eight feet from her she whips out a bottle of Perrier
She sprays it all around, searing the inner circle
Screaming, they clutch their faces
: - Yes
Others are watching as well
Andy comes up with some chair- made stakes, hands some to Pike
: - Buffy is defending herself in an astounding blur of gymnastics and martial arts
Leaping, throwing kicks, punches, and the odd stake, she manages to scatter them enough to make a run for it
: - Everyone is watching through the windows as the vampires follow after Buffy
It's okay
think they're going after her
: - Almost as if it heard that, one of the vampires turns toward the gym, grinning hugely
It and at least half the others turn back toward the easy pickings inside
: - (to Kimberly) 'll bet you feel stupid
Let's get away from these windows
Find something to cover them with
Students start mobilizing
Bring round the table
There's nails and stuff we used to put everything up
Get 'em
Andy and some others drag a table forward
Pike helps hoist it up against the window
He looks one last time outside, then covers it up
: - Buffy runs
She heads toward the nearby cluster of school buildings
Close behind are the undead
She passes a line of parked cars
- Jeffrey and Jennifer are in the back of his parked , making heated, clumsy love
We can see them through the window
Oh, yes
Yes
Oh, baby
Make me a woman
Yes
Make me a woman
As they are spouting this nonsense, Buffy zooms  and the  behind the car
After a second she walks back the , staring at the two of them
(pissed) That was quick
(looking up) Oops
She books out again, the horde on her heels
: '  - Jeffrey looks up and out the window
Buffy
(whining) Jeffrey
' Vampires swarm about the car in pursuit of Buffy
Jeffrey goes wide-eyed at the sight
Starts climbing off Jennifer and into the driver's seat
(terrified) Well, 'm done
Are you done
No -- Okay, let's go
But -- : - The car roars off
: - Windows and the boards covering them begin to smash inward student pounding in nails is caught, pulled out the window vampire crawling in is spiked by Pike
Another makes it in and is smashed on the head repeatedly by Andy
It staggers, smilingly, and turns toward him
The heart
Stab them in the heart
Andy manages to shove the two-by-four in its heart just as it gets its fingers around his throat
Kimberly screams
One of them has hold of her, starts pulling her out the window
Nicole runs to her, starts pulling the vampire's hands off her
Suddenly, the vampire grabs Nicole instead
Off balance, she is almost out the window before Kimberly can react, and all Kim can do is scream
Andy and Pike make it to the window too late; Nicole is pulled out, and they swarm over her
: - vampire catches up to Buffy
She shoots the last crossbow shaft at it
Shucks the bow away as another reaches her
She wrestles with it, fights it off but doesn't kill it
Moves on as more approach
: - Students are still holding most of them at the windows
One or two have gotten in
- junior vampire has snuck behind it and is going through the records
He stops, finding one he likes, and starts to put it on
: "Teen Angel"
It wafts over the carnage in the gym, lending it a surreal and dreamy quality
Hearing the music, another vampire grabs Kimberly and starts dancing with her
She screams a lot
It's about to plant one on her neck when Pike stabs it in the back
Pike turns from the dying vampire and is face to face with Benny
Pike is frozen for a moment
: - Buffy approaches the nearest building to the gym
The vampires are several feet behind her, some twenty of them
The door is locked
She smashes it in with her shoulder
Runs inside
few vampires are about to follow Buffy into the building when a hand is suddenly raised before them, stopping the
Slowly they start fading back
It is Amilyn
He smiles at the other vampires, and raises his fingers to his lips
Shhhh
: -     - Pike is slammed down onto it, Benny's face inches from his
"Teen Angel" has been replaced by some hard rock
Isn't this great, Pike
Isn't it great
Finally got those bitches on the run
He hoists Pike up and backhands him in the jaw, sends him flying against a wall
Pike shakes his head as Benny comes at him again, no longer smiling
(continuing) Of course 'm angry
leave you alone for five minutes, and look who you're hanging out with
He turns suddenly and grabs a girl, yells in her face
(continuing) don't want girls with good taste; want a girl that tastes good
She faints and he drops her, turns back to Pike
Pike is getting shakily to his feet
Blood trickles down his forehead
(continuing) was gonna change you, man
was gonna give you life
Do you know what that means
- Gary Murray, yelling orders at student, holding a board against a window as vampires pound on it
The exposed part of the window above him shatters, raining glass on his head
- vampire is clutching a helpless girl as another vampire takes their picture with an Instamatic
He expresses confusion and dismay when his image does not come out in the photo
- Pike is backing away from Benny, who is approaching him
Pike passes an overturned table, the stubs of its broken legs sticking up at the ceiling
Never die
Never get kicked around, never get busted
Benny grabs him with hateful force
His fingers dig into Pike's arms enough to draw blood
(continuing) It means never having to say you're sorry
And you blow it all off for that slut
What about my needs
Pike suddenly grabs Benny, holds him tightly in a brotherly embrace
Benny is thrown slightly by this
Still holding him, Pike pitches onto the table, driving the leg-shard through Benny's back
Pike still holds Benny as he twitches and screams, dying
Finally, he lets go, gets up
He looks a little dazed, a little lost
window shattering far behind him pulls his eyes back into focus, and he goes to help
- Sitting by a wall, tiny and silent amid the carnage
: - Buffy moves quickly along, crouching near a window and peering out
Nothing
She looks about her, waiting for an attack
She checks her purse
- ' Cosmetics and hair spray
small cross
No stakes left
Muttering under her breath, she moves swiftly into a classroom
: - Still moving cautiously, she heads for the window and pulls down the shade
She crouches behind the teacher's desk and pulls the chair down to her, laying it on its side
(cattily, to herself) 'Ooh, make me a woman, Jeffrey
oh, Jeffrey, you're so atheletical
love you
' She slams her elbow down on the chair leg -- very controlled, efficient motion -- and snaps it off
Looks around to see if anyone is around to hear as she picks up the leg, now a weapon
She goes softly to the door, peers cautiously out
- Looking out
Amilyn's face appears right next to her, also looking out
All clear
Buffy screams, turns, and Amilyn decks her, sends her flying back into the classroom
The stake flies out of her hand
It lands on a desk by the window
Buffy does not land nearly as well, crashing into a pile of desks and twisting her leg badly
Amilyn laughs repulsively, advancing
Pleased to meet you
Won't you guess my -- (kicks her hard) -- name
(defiantly, through the pain) It wouldn't be 'Dick,' would it
He kicks her again
(continuing) 'Lefty'
You're a fool, bloodbag
Die a fool and go to hell
He grabs her by the neck with his one arm and pins her against the wall in the corner
She reaches for the stake but it is just out of reach
He is squeezing the life out of her, his face inches from hers
(continuing) The chosen one
You're just another bloodbag -- not even fit to die for the Master
When will you ever learn
Buffy looks about for succor
- Buffy eyes the bottom of the shade, the pull dangling aimlessly
(with difficulty) do know
one thing
What
know
what time sunrise is
She pulls down hard on the shade pull and lets go
No
He turns in horror, letting go of Buffy, trying to catch the shade
The instant he releases her, Buffy grabs the stake and in one swift motion, buries it in Amilyn's back
The shade goes up, flapping loudly as it spins
It is still pitch black out
Amilyn stare, wide-eyed and silent, at the night as he dies
It's in about four hours, Dick
Amilyn spins, dying rage in his eyes
He grabs her
His strength is formidable even as his body begins to smoke
Suddenly screaming, he forces her over suddenly with such power that the two of them go crashing through the floorboards
: '  - The two of them fall through the ceiling directly into the blood pool
Amilyn's body surfaces first, now just a husk
Buffy pops up from the waist-deep blood, soaked and wounded
She stays a moment, breathing hard
Suddenly her eyes go wide
Oh, god, no
not yet
Lothos rises from the pool, smiling
Buffy is clearly paralyzed by fear
knew you'd come
He moves toward her
(continuing) You knew it, too, didn't you
All your life, dreaming
waiting to feed me
Buffy is suddenly galvanized into action
She throws a few punches at Lothos, but he takes them without flinching
She grabs at the stake in what remains of Amilyn's chest
Lightning quick, Lothos closes his hand around her and squeezes till the stake splinters and she screams with pain
He knocks her back on her ass
She starts moving backward, away from him, but it is hard enough for her to make her way through the thick gore
Lothos contemplates Amilyn's corpse, and his face darkens
(continuing) Ah, my fool is dead
He was careless, always
Still, 'll pull out your tongue for that
(coming toward her) Don't you understand
've killed you a dozen times
Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath
have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes
thousand years, and more
have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and  have bathed in the blood of emperors
(breaking the spell) Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert
What
And she is up, turning to run
He is thrown momentarily by her insolence
: '  -    - But he is on her the moment she emerges from the chamber, grabbing her by the hair and throwing her to the ground
You waste time
That is a sin
He kneels over her prostrate body
She is reaching frantically into her purse
He runs his hand along her body, a gesture both lustful and disdainful
(continuing) You're even weaker than the others
think you've forgotten something
She pulls out a small cross, holds it in front of him
He snarls at it, then grabs it, his hand around her
The cross bursts into flame
He holds her hand onto it
This
This is you only weapon
Your puny faith
No
With her other hand, Buffy holds up her hair spray
(continuing) my keen fashion sense
She squeezes it at him, the spray catching fire form the cross and whooshes a jet of flame right into his face
He screams, letting her go and backing up
Hey, his head is on fire
Buffy turns and hobbles away
: '  - Lothos stumbles about, head all aflame, till he finally pitches into the pool
: '  -  - Buffy comes out of the boiler room and hobbles along, moving as fast as she can
This is the suckiest party  have ever been to
It's not even a contest
She reaches a locked door that says "Gymnasium -- Authorized Personnel Only"
Puts her shoulder to it
: '  -    - As he pulls himself out of the pool, we are treated to a good look at his new head
It is charred and torn almost beyond recognition
It is so inhuman looking, that we are almost surprised when it screams
: '  -  - The  fills the hall
Buffy is still working on the heavy metal door
She turns, wide-eyed, at the
Oops
: '  - '  - We  rapidly through the cave, through the boiler room, the hall
We're moving much too fast to be running
: - Buffy pulls herself up through a trap door in the corner
Everything stops
For a moment there is silence
Buffy gets shakily up
Don't let her in
Don't let her in
Pike and the others see her
Pike and Andy run to her to help
(continuing) They'll kill us
Get her out
Gary Murray stops in front of Kimberly, takes her face in his hand and lightly pops the back of her head against the wall
Cross-eyed, she slides back down into comatic silence
Are you okay
Get away from me
She pushes them away
Lothos crashes through the trap door behind her, ugly and crazed
He picks her up, floating a good two feet off the ground
You bitch
He hurls her the length of the room
She hits a locker, which opens, spilling out someone's notebook
The binder falls open, inside it is a plastic pen case with pens and pencils within
Buffy looks, by this time, like shit
She props herself up as best she can, looks about her
There is nothing wooden, nothing sharp, within reach
(continuing) You would challenge me
Andy charges Lothos from behind
Pike tries to stop him, but is too late, as Lothos grabs him by the face without even looking at him
(continuing; to Buffy) 'll rip the flesh from your stinking bones
Squeeze Andy's head until we hear something crack
Lets him drop
Looks around at the cowed students
(continuing) am a God
God
am so sure
Lothos roars
Furious, he charges Buffy, his feet just skimming the ground, racing toward her, violently fast, upon her
She spins, on her feet in a flash, one quick motion
She thrusts her palm forward and stops him, cold, like Superman stopping a train, palm at his chest
Silence
Buffy looks directly into his eyes, the mad rictus of his face
Lothos stops, almost wide-eyed, as he looks down at his chest
Sticking out of the middle of his chest is a small eraser, and a #2
He steps back, staring at Buffy
The expression on his horrible face seems to have changed to one almost of respect
Her look is unfathomable
Lothos smiles, graciously
It doesn't
hurt
as much as had imagined
He falls gently to the ground
He's dust before he hits it
Silence
One by one the vampires, stricken, slip out into the night
- Kneeling by Andy's body
He gets up, and walks toward what's left of Lothos, warily keeping his eye on the spot
In the background we see Gary Murray, running out after a vampire
Just a minute, you
'm not finished with you
Pike kneels by the pile of dust with a pencil in it
Everybody is looking at Buffy
She stares back at the students who cast her out
Turns and walks out
Pike follows her
: - We see the direct aftermath; the gym, police cars, people helping the wounded
Over this is the voice of a reporter
(
) The death toll now reaches twelve and a half in the tragedy of Hemery High School
It was at the Senior Prom five days ago that the school was beset by a roving gang of crack- crazed gunmen
Survivors say some two hundred of the ruffians laid the school gym under a kind of siege, claiming several lives in the process
Said one administrator, 'Things here will never be the same
' : - Students walk, holding their books talking
: - Students passing notes, yawning, falling asleep
: - Students window shopping, sucking on slurpies, laughing
: - , the blue water
Kimberly dives gracefully into it, comes up on the other side
'  - Kim climbs out and joins Jeffrey, Jennifer and a boy and girl we don't know
They are all in bathing gear, with fluorescent zinc on their noses
She was even crazier after that mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her
Buffy
Jennifer nods
Kimberly wrinkles her nose in distaste
She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school
All year
She didn't even go to the prom
heard she got straight 's
Jennifer glares at him
(continuing) That's what  heard
The worst is, her parents -- this is true -- her parents were gonna send her to the Bahamas for graduation, and she refused
True story
She said she didn't want to go
It is to vomit
Well, where is she now
: - Buffy and Pike are walking up the elaborate stone drive toward us
We can't really tell where they are, but there are trees, hills in the background
Buffy leads the way
She is confident, at ease
She wears a large old sports jacket, a baseball cap pulled backward
Skirt and sneakers
Casual, cool, but disarming
She carries a knapsack
didn't say it was a bad idea, just said the timing was off
We could maybe wait till later
Don't be such a fraidy-cat
Who's afraid
Besides me,  mean
We've come all this way
We just have to check it out
got a hunch
You're the boss, boss
just thought maybe we should wait
Buffy stops at a large, elaborately carved door
She turns to Pike
Trust me
- Buffy grabs the large metal knocker, ringed through a gargoyle's mouth
And on the boom of the knocker, we see: - The castle
Archetypal, turreted, terrifying
Standing lonely on the craggy hill, drenched in the light of the rising moon
