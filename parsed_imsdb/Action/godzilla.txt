Explosion after explosion devastates the locale
One building after the next, accelerating in momentum, culminating in one final

The ash-like fallout drifts downward onto what's left of the islands below
We  this ash as it settles next to a dead reptile, unrecognizable now, and down onto what's left of the lizard's eggs
Suddenly the image clears from the grainy footage to clean, modern high resolution

Before anyone can answer, the ship is  by an enormous  as something hits the side of the immense ship

Again, the ship is ,  it violently

Two more life boats are revealed behind it as the crew desperately tries to hoist them up and over the side

The lifeboats swing , several of them    as they slam against the ship
Or whatever it is,
This time the entire ship begins to
Bounces off the deck and slides off the side
Following it is the Cook
Desperately, the Cook grabs onto the ship's side railing to keep from falling off
He looks back and something so horrible that he    and lets go of the railing

-  -                        11 With the infamously crippled nuclear power plant in the distance, the utility van slides to a muddy stop by this field of dirt
Nick hops out quickly and rushes to the back of the van
He opens the back of the van and grabs several metallic cases
Walking a few yards away from the van, he dumps the cases on the ground, opening them to  an assortment of sophisticated scientific equipment
Taped to the inside are several photos of a girl we'll meet later
Some of the photos are of her looking young and beautiful
Others are of the two of them happily together
With a switch he turns on the equipment which comes to life
Inside one of the cases are several cables attached to long
He grabs them and dashes away
"'m laughing at clouds, so dark up above
" Nick rushes over to a small patch of land and begins to the spikes into the muddy earth
"The sun's in my heart and 'm ready for love
" Once firmly in the ground, he rushes back over to the van and pops the hood
- ' We  the steaming engine and a large electric car "Let the cloudy skies chase
" He attaches the cables to the battery and they
Nick  and jumps back
Shaking off the shock, he rushes back over to the mud pit, dropping down to his knees
Suddenly, raising from the mud we see Excitedly Tatopoulos grabs a big empty glass jar and begins filling the jar with worms, happily in his element
"'m singin' in the mud, just scooping up my worms
" Unable to hear over his Walkman, he is oblivious as an enormous    lands right behind him
From the intense wind kicked up by the helicopter, Tatopoulos finally turns in time to see several coming toward him
Nick scrambles to his feet
(broken Russian) Good day
am here with permission

(in English) Permit
How do you say permit
He goes through his pockets looking for his permits

Tatopoulos looks up as the Russian soldiers move past him and over towards his cases of equipment
man in a long raincoat comes forward
It's Tatopoulos
The worm guy, right

The Russian soldiers close up his equipment and take it off to the Helicopter

With the ocean in the distance, through the heat waves we  a row of official looking black sedans coming toward us
13
-  -                     13 The doors to the sedans open as a group of very official looking Government types
Stopping to light his cigarette is  , 40's, intense, dangerous and worst of all

rushes over
(The following dialog is entirely in French with subtitles) The Japanese consulate has been calling and we've been getting pressure from the Americans
What did you tell them
Nothing yet
Are there any other survivors
Only one, Sir
He was very lucky
The group arrives at a door at the end of the hall
The Briefing Officer opens the door
'
- In the corner of the large room we see the old Cook from the tanker curled up in the fetal position
The doctors and a few nurses are attending to him
Get them out of there
Two of the Officials move in and escort the Doctors and Nurses out of the room
Raymond nods to two other Officials who begin to unpack some recording equipment, including a video camera
15
-                                    15 Raymond enters and moves close to the old Cook, kneeling down in front of him, inspecting his distant glare
The old Cook seems to be in a world of his own, rocking back and forth
Raymond nods to another Official who comes forward
(in French) Ask him what happened
The Second Official ask him in Japanese, but the old Cook does not respond
He asks again but the old Cook seems to be in a world of his own
(in English) It's no use
He's been like this since we fished him out of the ocean
Whatever happened to that tanker put him in a complete state of shock
Raymond takes out his lighter and ignites it on high
The old Cook's eyes slowly come back to life, transfixed by the fire
Slowly he brings the flame close to the old Cook's face
(in English) What did you see, old man
Drawn out of himself by the flame

Dr
Niko Topopolosis
(correcting) It's Tatopoulos
Right
The worm guy
(to guards at blockade) Can someone get those people off the beach
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell 'm doing here
Follow me
The Major leads Nick up the beach away from the crowds
You didn't answer my question
In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise
- Several soldiers and researchers are investigating the site when Nick and the Major walk past
Look,  may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field
We know
Major Hicks motions to some guards who clear a blockade away from a jungle pathway
Major Hicks takes the pathway
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm
Yeah, you're the worm guy
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's
You have any idea what that means
No, but  have the feeling 'm about to find out
It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before
Mutated by seventeen percent
Major Hicks stops, turns to Nick
(bemused) Seventeen percent, huh
Sounds big
They're enormous
new species created by man's recklessness
That's what 've been trying to tell you, 'm only a biologist
take radioactive samples and study them
Then you're perfect
(pointing to the ground) Here's your radioactive sample
Study it
With that Major Hicks walks away
What sample
You're standing on it
Nick looks down, sees nothing
don't see it
(no response) Where is it
We   above him, pulling back farther and farther, until we  he's standing inside of a 15 in the sand
(') don't see it
Two scientists have spread out a tape measure to document its length as two others inspect it with Geiger counters
Nick sees them and realizes he's standing in a remarkable discovery
He looks up ahead and
- Foot steps
- Five gigantic footsteps in front of him
Other researchers examining the prints with all kinds of equipment
Geiger counters, ,  away
Nick is stunned

-                 18 Nick rushes to catch up with Major Hicks who walks towards a command tent in the distance
(flabbergasted) That was a footprint
was standing inside a footprint
That's right
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that
Is there
We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out
The Major gestures to the many villagers who are being attended to
Some are injured, others are being examined for radiation
The village has been decimated
Somebody must have seen it
It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over
jeep pulls up and , a young researcher, comes rushing over with a video tape in his hands
As he passes Major Hicks
(on the run) Tape's in
The French finally released it
Peters takes off for the command' tent
Nick and the Major follow
-  - Part military, part scientific command post
Lots of activity
Peters waves the tape as he rushes over to a television
Major Hicks and Nick follow

We think there's a connection

Hi
Nick Tatopoulos
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist
She's clearly attracted to him
This doesn't escape Nick, who's not too comfortable with her flirtatious glare

This is all too overwhelming for him

What could have possibly done all that

Speak of the devil
Just then Caiman passes behind them
(nervous) Think  should ask him
'm going to ask him
You think  should
will
Audrey makes the decision and bolts after Caiman
Lucy rolls her eyes
Oh girl
- As he walks towards his office Audrey races up to him
Seeing her, he walks faster hoping to avoid her
He can't
Did you talk with Humphries
This is not the place
Just tell me, did you talk with him
He said he'd consider it
It's between you and Rodriguez
Are you serious
He's going to consider me for he job
What else did he say
They arrive at his office
An enormous standee of himself with the    is there
Why don't  tell you over dinner tonight
Your place
He stops at his door
Audrey is startled
Mr
Caiman, you're married
And you're beautiful
Mr
Caiman
Call me Charlie
(stubbornly) Mr
Caiman, 've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year
And 've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me
'm too old to be an assistant anymore
need to know this job is going someplace
So have dinner with me tonight

It's your choice
Caiman shuts the door on her
She turns and is face to face with the standee of Caiman
She takes out her chewing gum and plasters it on his nose

Nick looks very uncomfortable
Elsie looks at Nick
lasciviously
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl
How did Mrs
Tatopoulos handle it
Oh, 'm not married
Really
girlfriend then
No
Perhaps  work too much
(filtered) You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart
Nick seems to get lost in thought
Not for a long time, now
Well,  think you're cute
(awkward) Oh, thank you
(whispered to Clive) Is she always like this

The sound of a   overhead

As we  the helicopter we
- Taking up nearly the entire beach, an enormous cargo ship lays on its side in the sand
Two gigantic holes, ripped into its hull
Nick hops out and joins Major Hicks et al as they push past the gathered crowd of onlookers
The group gives a collective gasp as they see the ship for the first time
Three men (who we'll recognize from the Tahiti hospital) take measurements of the holes in the ship
Who are they
Lieutenant, get those people away from there
(French accent) They are with me
Everyone in the group turns to find Mr
Phillip Raymond
And who are you
Raymond hands him, as well as anyone who wants one, his business card
, property and casualty insurance
We are preparing a report
You're fast
That is our job
Well your people are getting in the way of my job
Major, what do you think could have done this
Get your people out of there or will
The Major walks away
Raymond studies him as he does
- Nick can't take his eyes off the enormous holes in the hull
He steps closer and turns to Peters, who's taking radiation counts of the ship
Mind if  borrow this
Peter hands him his Geiger counter and walks into the cracked hull of the ship

-  -                           22 Inside is eerily dark and creepy
The guts of the ship are tangled inside
Holding a Geiger counter, he gets readings from all over the area
One particular spot, above him, seems slightly stronger
Nick  something there
He opens his knapsack and puts on some rubber gloves, removing a glass jar (like the ones from Chernobyl) Carefully he climbs the debris until he reaches a sharp shard of metal
Clinging to it he finds a He tries remove it but he only gets half
He places it into his jar
Just as he reaches for the other half, With a , the section above him collapses
rush of water falls and a   swings down, just in front of him
Nick tumbles backwards, his heart pounding
The body swings lifelessly as it hangs from above
The others rush to his side, checking to see if he's all right
You okay, Nick
Yeah, 'm
wait
lost
Nick looks around frantically when the glass sample jar is suddenly handed to him
Are you looking for this
Thanks
Raymond studies Nick as he joins the rest outside

Suddenly
The ship  for a second
Jules slides and  his head into the boom-box
He yelps
The nets are full
Then bring 'em in
We can't

Jules gets up to move aft when , again the ship Arthur tries to  his engine but it only
Soon all three boats
Nothing but quiet for a long beat
What is going on
Then with another  all three boats begin to move , She's going sternway
What the hell did we catch
The three boats begin to   , moving in the water
Water  up into the boats, winches begin to  under the building pressure
The boats begin to move incredibly  backwards
Things on the boat begin to  and   onto the decks of the ships
Cut us free

The same cry is heard on all three boats
Leonard grabs an  and starts   at the tow lines
Jules and his deck hands do the same

Desperately they try and free themselves as their boats are dragged helplessly backwards
(screaming at his men) Cut the damned cables
Jules falls backward as the cables and ropes are either cut or snapped from the pressure
Their boat stops
Leonard and his crew  to the deck as their boat is freed
Is not so fortunate
The lone boat dragged backwards, faster now without the weight of the other boats
Then suddenly the aft of the boat begins to get  , dipping into the water
With an unstoppable force the Harpo gets Deck hands  off the boat as the top cabin is as the entire ship slowly For a moment all is quiet
No one can believe what just happened
Hearts pounding, catching their breath
Then with a  of air pressure, the Harpo  out of the water
With a gigantic , the boat  on its side and capsizes

Quickly stepping over him a young  rushes over to Major Hicks, seated with the rest of the team on the plane's opposing benches
The Solider interrupts their discussion
Major, we just got a report of a fishing trawler going down
Exact position, forty seven degrees latitude, 67 longitude
What makes you think it's related
The trawler was pulled under
The team exchanges worried glances
Hicks moves over to a map where the other incidents have been marked
He traces his finger up the 67th longitude until he hits the 47th parallel
Just off the East Coast
Jesus Christ
It's only two hundred miles off the American Eastern seaboard and we don't even know what it is
Theropoda Allosaurus Some type of enormous reptile the likes of which we haven't seen since the age of prehistoric dinosaurs
(sarcastic) So where's been hiding the last sixty million years The depth and breath of the ocean floor has barely been explored
His kind could have survived there completely undetected
(
) What about the traces of radiation
Everyone turns to discover Nick has walked over holding his loosely scribbled notes in his hand
The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is
What do we know
It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific
An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years
Hence the radiation
More than that
believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region
(sarcastic) Like your earthworms
Yes
We're looking at a completely incipient creature
The dawn of a new species
The first of its kind

Cars  and , flipping toward us, from the weight of the beast
We try to keep up with it, but it's too fast
After it passes, the Mayor sticks his head out of the doorway to see the demolished street scene
What was that

- '  -  -                     34 Caiman's on the phone as his  enters with some files
Rain and thunder continue outside
(into phone) don't give a crap about some war in a country  can't pronounce
That's not a lead story
Find me a damned story, will ya
Just then his Secretary notices a desk lamp, the shade and the light
She hears the approaching
She turns and
The enormous head of  growls as it passes by Caiman's office window
Mr
Caiman
think your story just walked by the window
Caiman turns but there's nothing there
He's confused, she's dazed
What
Just then the   past with a  whip

-  -                                      35 Animal, Lucy and Audrey are at the cashier paying
Did Romeo have a name
Nick Tatopoulos
That why you dumped him
No
just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches wanted to have some adventure, some fun
And now you live the glamorous life of Caiman's assistant
Life's a bitch, ain't it
In the distance we can  the  approaching
How long where you and dis guy goin' steady
Nearly four years
Four years
Girl, 'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him
That's the problem
He did
Suddenly the  gets  very quickly
Everyone in the diner reacts
Tell me that's not another goddamned parade
The next   the entire diner
Things begin to fall
Through the window we see people  in That's ain't no parade
Before anyone can speak the entire building is
Through the front window we
' Smashing down directly outside the window
Cars are One car  directly   , shattering it
Animal uses his size to  the girls from the falling debris
As the danger passes, Animal charges for the door
Victor, wait
36
-  -  -                        36 Animal comes rushing out
Water sprays from displaced fire hydrants, debris still falls, cars burn
Animal goes over to his   that has been partially crushed
He pries open the rear door and takes out his video camera and takes off running
Audrey and Lucy arrive too late to stop him
Victor, don't
Turning the corner Animal runs full speed through the debris, trying to jam a video cassette into his camera
It won't fit
He  up ahead
Just as it disappears around the corner a few blocks ahead
Thinking quickly, Animal bolts down a small alleyway
37
-                               37 His camera damaged, Animal struggles to get the tape inside as he exits the other side of the alley
He darts out into the street to get his shot
The  is
He looks up to see, ,
Then, for the first time, we can clearly see the entire massive creature that is
as he comes barreling towards us
The titanic lizard is ferocious and agile
Swiftly he moves closer
Animal's hands fumble with the tape
He  it in, sweating
He fingers the  , the red light goes on
Quickly he shoulders the camera
- Nearly on top of him, Godzilla's own image is suddenly covered by his own immense foot as it's lifted and about to come down directly on us
Oh shit
Before he can do anything about it
' Towering above him
He has no time to flinch as the gargantuan foot
In terrifying amazement, Animal remains standing '
Abruptly the foot again
Animal is unscathed and frozen with fear
- Close on Animal as the endless  of the creature just past him
It seems to go on forever
Finally it disappears
- Deserted and demolished
Cars burn, debris falls
Animal, the lone figure, just stands there, his chest heaving, hyper ventilating

Crowds have gathered as the military try to keep them at bay

-   -                     40 The guards let the convoy pass
The military is putting up a number of large tents
moves over quickly to greet the team as they exit their vehicles
(quick salute) Sergeant 'Neal, Sir
Any word from the Mayor's office
Just then dozens of   pull up
Reporters and camera crews come rushing toward them
The guards rush to intercept
Stepping out of the next car in the convoy, Nick and Elise join Major Hicks
They've agreed to evacuate the city
They've called out the National Guard and riot police are on alert
As they walk towards the tents the crowd crushes close
Nick and Elsie are overwhelmed
(aside to Nick) Evacuate Manhattan
That's over three million people
Has that ever been done before
don't think so
Several military guards have to clear a path for them as they enter the tents

-  -                         41 Still in construction
The team enters
Status report
We've lost sight of it, Sir
You want to run that by me again
(nervous) After the initial attack he just
disappeared
(interrupting) Major, Secretary of Defense Burk on the line
This takes Major Hicks off guard
The last person he wants to talk to
Nick walks over to the Sergeant
don't understand
How can something that large just disappear
We're not sure
We're scanning the area now
He probably returned to the river
Just like everywhere else we've been, we're always one step behind
Nick turns and notices the back of the tent is open revealing a beautiful view of the Manhattan skyline
Several soldiers enter, setting up telescopes
don't think so
Over Manhattan we see several dark plumes of smoke from the destruction
Military helicopters scan the city
Staring out at the skyline, Nick is mesmerized
mean, look at it
It's perfect
An island, water on all sides
But like no other island in the world, this is a place where he can easily hide
(beat) He's in there someplace
comes rushing in
Channel eight caught it on film
He rushes over to a bank of monitors, turns one on
On the screen we  the shaky video Animal took of the creature just as it was about to step on him
(filtered) 's exclusive images of the creature were taken less than a half hour ago
Nick and Elsie's jaws nearly hit the floor at the sight of the immense creature
Cameraman Victor "Animal" Palotti barely survived this vicious attack to provide us with this footage
The sounds of applause lead us to

Embarrassed, Animal smiles awkwardly
- Way to go Animal
That's my man
Animal passes Audrey and Lucy who are packing up some files
Great stuff, Animal
Weren't you scared
Sure  was

Damned right, you crazy Wop
We  the room is in disarray from packing up cartons of boxes and equipment
The workers have taken a break from the packing as they watch the t

The station manager,  enters anxiously
People
We have to be completely relocated to the New Jersey station before our 5:30 broadcast

Everyone else we'll see you in Jersey
Gotta go, honey
You guys gonna be all right
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight
Great
See ya then
Animal hurries out after him
Audrey and Lucy go back to packing
Audrey looks up at the t

just as they replay the footage of Nick and Elsie being led into the command tent
(filtered) military and government health officials set up a command post on the New Jersey coast this afternoon
Surprised at first, Audrey suddenly becomes very excited
She  Caiman exiting the studio at the end of the hall
She rushes over to him
Caiman, wait
Take me with you
What

Not now
You got my bag
Audrey holds up his bag as they walk towards the elevator
You don't understand,  can get us information
Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey
With that, Caiman walks into the elevator
Pissed, Audrey just stares at him
The bag
Audrey  the bag at him, knocking him backwards as the elevator doors close
Lucy walks over
Come on, Girl, we've gotta go

-   -              43 Lucy and Audrey carry their bags outside into the chaos that has taken over the city
Hundreds of people trying to leave at once
Gridlock
As they move into an overcrowded subway entrance, Audrey looks up just in time to  the lifting off from the building behind them

Police and the National Guard have quarantined off over twenty square city blocks
46
-            46 Below we see the largest traffic jam in the history of the city
Police and National Guardsmen guide the traffic
hundreds of thousands have jammed the streets in the largest evacuation in the history of the city
And many people are not happy about it
47
-              47 Quick cuts of people who where interviewed earlier
don't understand why we have to leave our homes
It's over already, isn't it
What are we running from

Dozens of armed officers pile out of the van
Maintaining blockades in front of their military vehicles
49
-  -              49 The evacuation effort is made more difficult as traffic must be diverted away from the quarantined destruction area ahead
Police block the street, smoldering buildings behind them
The detour only makes things worse
50

The Guardsmen peek inside
'

Godzilla apparently walked
The Guardsmen are visibly shaken
51
-                                   51 Way beyond capacity, the flooded subway platform bursts with people pushing and shoving to get into the trains
Caught in the craziness we find Audrey and Lucy trying desperately to get on board
Please don't push
People are getting shoved down onto the tracks and the trains can't leave
The last to fit inside, Lucy and Audrey cram in just as the doors shut behind them
People left behind  on the closed doors as the subway pulls out

The bridge is a veritable parking lot
(
) Well this is great

'  -                     53 With his close aides in tow, the Mayor stares at the melee below
If we're wrong on this evacuation they'll string me up from the Liberty torch
54
-    -               54 The Mayor's helicopter sails over the George Washington Bridge and over to a small landing pad near the Command Center
large group of people dressed in business suits await the helicopter
55
'  -                      55 Just as the helicopter is landing, the crowd moves toward the chopper
Who the hell are they
It's a contingent of building owners and community business representatives
don't have time for this nonsense
Most of them are campaign contributors
Well that's a different story
56
-  -                56 As the Mayor steps out he's greeted by a nervous crowd of people shouting, "How long do we have to shut our business down
Will the city cover the damages
Etc
" Among them,   tries to get the Mayor's attention

As he pushes through the dense crowd he runs directly into
Who waits for the Mayor
The Mayor is momentarily stopped
(handing his card) Insurance
We represent nearly thirteen percent of the buildings in your city
If you'll excuse me
We are very happy that you are in control of this situation
With that he gently pats the Mayor on the back, leaving a small, nearly undetectable  on the Mayor's collar
You can count on our emotional and financial support
Oh, well, thank you very much
Briskly he shakes his hand as he pushes his way through the crowd
Raymond watches him pass, seeing the device stuck to the Mayor's collar
- Rushing over from the parked news chopper, Animal and Caiman race for the Mayor who walks through a mob of reporters
Hurry, we're going to miss the Mayor
But before he can get close, two   stop them
Sorry, you gotta have a press  past this point
Don't you watch t
v
Can we see your press pass, sir
Flustered, Caiman searches his pockets for his press pass

Where the hell did  put it
'   - We  Caiman's plastic smile on his press
Suddenly ' picture is placed on top of Caiman's
: 57
-  -                  57 Smashed together like sardines, Audrey plays with Caiman's press pass, trying to put her photo over his
What the hell are you doing
Remember my friend we saw on t
v
Your old sweetheart
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post
Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama
There's a story here
know it
You got any tape or glue
left my forgery kit back at the office
Audrey looks over at a young ten year old boy holding his backpack, a  sticking out of the back
Hey, do you have any glue in your bag
What's it to you
Can  use some
What do  get
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man
Five bucks
You're kidding, right
The Kid simply puts his hand out

Please exit the station
For those of you without accommodations, the city has opened up shelters on Monroe and 60th and at Bergenline and 72nd
Please exit the
Audrey and Lucy walk through the crowd
Audrey turns and gives Lucy a kiss
Wish me luck
Audrey,  don't think this is a very good idea
Caiman finds out and he'll have your job
'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce
If there's a story here 'm going to find it
Lucy nods in acceptance as Audrey disappears into the dense crowd
Lucy worries for her friend
: "  "  - - Carried along with a Styrofoam cup of coffee
We a  carrying the junk food to a parked not too far from the Command Center Tent across the way
The man knocks on the back of the van
The van opens to reveal

'  - -                             59 Filled with high tech monitoring equipment, Raymond and his men are listening in to a conversation
The man with junk food hands it to Raymond
Merci
He opens the bag and takes out a croissant
He bites into it and grimaces
To wash away the taste, he drinks from the coffee
It's worse than the croissant
You call this coffee
(French accent) call this America
The man takes a seat near Raymond as Raymond turns up the volume on his headset
(
) (mid argument) You're telling me that in an election month 've evacuated the entire city for nothing

-   () - -            60 From behind the Mayor's head we  the monitoring device attracted to his collar
As he speaks we Do you realize what this evacuation will cost the people of this city
Representatives of all branches of the military, National Guard and the Mayor's office are here
The room overflows with people
Nick, Elsie and the scientist stand near the back of the tent
We're been monitoring the waters around the island
As far as we can tell it hasn't left the area
But you don't know for sure
We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area
But you don't know for sure Just then Sergeant 'Neal enters hurriedly
He wants to speak but waits for the opportunity
(controlling his temper) Mr
Mayor, if he's not in one of those buildings then we give the all clear
But not until we've checked each building
' Sir, that may be more difficult than we originally projected
More good news
' We've run into a problem

Sergeant 'Neal leads the team out of the cars and down a subway entrance
61
-  -                  61 Marching down the stairs, the team enters into the very large subway station
For all we see it seems like a normal subway station except for the fact that every one of the team members look
' Lt
Anderson and his men found this late this afternoon
The camera makes a hundred and eighty degree turn as we suddenly  what the team is staring at
The four normal subway tunnels have been making one
Debris and crumbled brick are everywhere
Several  with flashlights approach the hole
Lt
Anderson moves over to the astonished group
Some of the scientists fan out, examining the area
We were checking the office building above when we discovered the floor was gone
- We  that not only is the ceiling gone but the building above is hollowed and torn to shreds
Another hole in the building leads to the street
When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone
Christ
How many tunnels lead off the island
Only five, Sir
We've checked them all
He hasn't used any of them
Have them sealed off
And how should we do that, Sir
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs,  don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island
- As the  slowly move down deeper into the tunnels, their flashlight beams scan the area
Could they stumble onto something dangerous
- as he approaches Major Hicks and Sergeant 'Neal
You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you
He's just an animal
What are you suggesting
When  needed to catch earthworms, knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them
had to draw them out
-  - Still moving deeper into the tunnel we get the feeling these soldiers may just waken a sleeping giant
Nick moves to the edge of the platform, looking off into the dark tunnel
All we need to do is find out what it wants, what it needs, and he'll come to us
-  - The lead Soldier  something
Cautiously he moves forward thinking he's onto something
We  something in the darkness
We  his beam as the noise grows clearer
The beam falls onto something on the floor
Flopping on the ground is a large
As the beam moves farther along we see two, no, three fish ahead

Just as quickly the monitors return to normal

Raymond is putting sugar into his coffee when a bank of monitors turn on
They are seeing     as the Mayor
Pleased, he takes a sip
It's awful
You said this was French Roast
His aid turns, holding a package labeled

His associate hands him some milk
He adds it to the coffee
No use, it still sucks

That's a lot of fish

Sergeant 'Neal shoots him a glare and moves over to the men
Together they march into a building at the edge of the square
Loading up rifles, taking positions

The  move into their final positions
The National Guardsmen and Soldiers supporting the Tanks take positions

Everyone is waiting
The silence is deafening

Suddenly something catches his eye
Through a steam vent in the streets
Nick sees lifting into the air
He notices several other vents doing the same thing around the square

Nick grabs the receiver
Sergeant 'Neal, the subway vents
We have to shut them down

There is a long tense moment of waiting
When will it come
Will it come
Before the Young Officer can stop him, Nick rushes over to a manhole cover in the center of the street
The cover is to heavy
He yells back
We need to open all the manhole covers in the area
Let the scent waft down
The Young Officer signals other soldiers
Nick steps back and lets the soldiers go to work
As he walks back, he spots another manhole cover at the next intersection down a side street
He runs over to it
-   - particularly heavy one in the center of this intersection (a block away from Flat Iron Square), Nick, alone, wrestles to remove it
With all his might, he drags it clear
Suddenly, through the hole he  some from below
Rattled, he slowly backs away from the hole

Then with a  , the ground behind Nick and  , ripping up the boulevard as he does
Nick  only to find himself face to face with the gigantic creature
Godzilla's head slopes down, apparently looking Nick in the eye
All around foot soldiers appear, guns trained, shoulder hoisted rocket launchers prepared
Out of the corner of his eye, Nick sees all this
He gently signals with his hands that they should  fire
Sensing no danger from Nick, Godzilla simply Nick

Nick stops briefly as the Young Officer  a gas mask to Nick who quickly puts it on and dashes for a closer spot
Suddenly     we
Firing from the air cannons, the   streak across the sky landing behind Godzilla
The Yellow gas forms a wall of smoke that drifts upwards

Quickly Godzilla is surrounded by the gas fumes

The smoke annoying and distracting him, Godzilla spins, his tail waving the smoke away
But the smoke returns

Maintaining a total media blackout, officials remain silent this evening as to their progress in containing this creature
Behind him, in the crowd we  Audrey pushing her way through the reporters, her fake  pinned on her shirt
She turns and sees Caiman
Quickly she ducks down and moves deeper into the crowds
Suddenly there is movement as the crowd turns their collective attention over to a group of cars pulling up nearby
Audrey pushes her way to see what's happening
The cars are  from returning to the command tents as the reporters  the first car in line

Excited she starts to push her way through

Can  help you, young man
Do you have any home pregnancy tests
Especially ones that test for catastrophic hormones or clomiphene citrate
This is all we've got
The Pharmacist puts onto the counter six different off the shelf home pregnancy tests
'll take them all
(
) You must have quite some harem
Nick spins to find Audrey standing right behind him
Embarrassed, Nick awkwardly pays for the tests
Audrey
Is that you
Hi, hello
You look, wow, uh, how've you been
It's good to see you, Nick
The Pharmacist puts out Nick's change
He scoops it out and we  them as they exit together
So you made it
What
He points to her fake press  she's still wearing
You're a reporter
That's what you always wanted to be, right
'm happy for you
Really,  am
Yeah, well
108

So, you still picking apart cockroaches
No, 'm into earthworms now
You wouldn't be interested
They're real "boring" creatures
Very reliable, dependable, no surprises
You're still mad at me, aren't you
You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing
All this time
Yeah,  guess 'm still a little mad
That was eight years ago
Some people change, you know
Most people don't
'm sorry you feel that way
Audrey turns and walks away
Nick regrets his behavior and calls after her
Wait
'm sorry
You're right
Eight years is a long time
Can  offer you a cup of tea
Sure
'd like that
There's an awkward moment as neither knows what to say
One, thing, though
Who'd you get pregnant
Off Nick's awkward reaction
: 109
'  -  -                            109 Nick has set up a mini-lab in his private, small, tent
The home pregnancy tests have been ripped apart
Nick mixes some of the contents together
still can't believe it
How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
When you and  use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness
But from the inside now can actually effect change
(pointedly) never lost my idealism
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect
have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature
And you think this creature is one of them
Yes
The first of its kind
found this blood sample earlier this evening
Blood sample
How close did you get to that thing
got pretty close
What else do you know about it
Nick finishes his concoction, adding the blood sample into it He takes the piece of litmus paper from one of the home test boxes and dips it in
Well, we know he eats fish, he's of reptile genus, he's a burrower, he's amphibious and
Nick points out the litmus paper
It turns
he's pregnant Are you sure
Nick gets up and starts to gather his materials
(thrilled) Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy
don't get it
If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant
Excitedly Nick begins to pace
The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually
Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction
That's why he came to New York
Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting
Nesting
Yes
Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time
Nick moves to the front exit of the tent
Forgive me but 've got to get this into the lab, to confirm all this
'll be right back
Nick rushes from the tent
Alone, Audrey can't help but poke around a bit
She opens one of his
Taped to the roof of the case she

It's good

The big wigs are here and the room is packed
Major Hicks walks to a large map of Manhattan
General Anderson, the problem was the terrain
If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park
(points to the map) We should be able to take him down
Last time you didn't even scratch it
That's not true
Our worm guy, er, mean, Dr
Tatopoulos found blood
All eyes turn towards Nick who's still arranging his papers
Nervously Nick addresses the crowd
Well, yes
did
Clearly he was injured and bled
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking
Um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that
The blood  recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has
Are you trying to tell us there's another one of those things out there
don't believe so
Then how can it be pregnant
What is this, the "virgin lizard
" There's a smattering of laughter in the room
No, it reproduces asexually
That's why we must find the nest
If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own
Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest
It may be too late by then
These eggs will hatch very quickly
How could you possible know that
The fish

If Dr
Tatopoulos is right, we must act quickly before this problem escalates
You want to divide our efforts based solely on a wild theory
He's come through for us before and if he feels strongly
Come through for you
Major, your campaign's a disaster
You weren't even able to to prevent this thing from coming to Manhattan

Animal opens the bedroom window and begins to climb out
What are you doing
Lucy'd kill me if she knew
: 134
-  -                             134 Nick marches out of a changing room dressed in a military uniform
As he moves into the room we  all of Raymond's men dressed similarly
As they climb into their vehicles, Raymond hands each a stick of chewing gum
Nick gets in the passenger seat of one of the vehicles, Raymond climbs in behind the wheel
What's with the chewing gum
Makes us look more American
Nick looks over at the faux Americans
It's a tough sell, gum or not
Just let me do all the talking
With that the vehicles pull out of the warehouse and out into the rainy night
135
-  -  -              135 An armed blockage seals the Jersey entrance to the Lincoln tunnel
We widen to reveal Audrey and Animal by a small side entrance
Animal works the lock
What are you doing
It's the maintenance entrance
Runs along the side of the tunnel
When they repaired it last year  worked on a piece about it
Just then the lock  and the door opens
They enter
136
-   -        136 line of military vehicles approaches and slowly passes through a guarded entrance, each vehicle checked
Nick and Raymond's Humvee nears
-   - Raymond's Humvee rolls up and a  walks up to the window
(checking clipboard) Who you boys with
Oh, we're with the three two
didn't ask you, soldier
Sergeant 'Neal just called down for us to join in
Now he's suspicious
The guard approaches Raymond, checks him out
You got a problem talkin'
(perfect southern accent) Why no sir, 'm fine
The Guard is suspicious but on a tight schedule
Finally he waves him through
All right, keep it moving
(ala Presley) Thank you very much
They drive off
Nick is stunned by the act
Elvis Presley movies
(by way of explanation) He was the King
137
-   -  -       137 The door creeps open
Animal leans out to find the tunnel deserted
He and Audrey step out and into the tunnel
We  them as they are headed for the exit of the tunnel into Manhattan
138
'  -                               138 Raymond and Nick drive through Central Park
We can dozens of military people and vehicles in a large meadow
139
-   -                    139 The enormous pile of fish is getting dumped in the center of the field as many others are planting land mines
Tanks, rockets and soldiers align the area
The convoy of vehicles turn onto the meadow but Raymond and his men keep going straight
They drive slowly right past the trap sight and out of the park
Doors slam and immediately boots march past
We  to reveal Raymond's team quickly gathering their gear and heading down the subway entrance
Raymond grabs a heavy bag and tosses it to Nick who nearly topples from the weight
Be careful with that
Nick looks into the bag and sees a bag marked Shocked he looks back at Raymond, but he's gone
Nick regains his breath and follows
Older and nastier, but the same fish we saw in the tunnel before
We  the beam to its owner and find Nick
We  to reveal that we're
140
-   -                  140 The crisscrossing beams from the assault team's flashlights nearly blind us as Nick leads the team cautiously into the depth of this tunnel
Periodic fish are found along the way
Suddenly the faint sound in the tunnel
Everyone freezes as the wind shifts direction familiar  passes over them as they sniff the air
They've turned off the ventilation system
They're calling him to dinner
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres
Nervously they continue onward
141
23RD    -  -              141 Animal and Audrey arrive, spotting the assault team's vehicles
They head carefully down the stairs
142
23RD    -  -              142 Audrey and Animal, camera in hand shooting everything, climb down into the station
Animal rushes to the end of the platform and searches down into the tunnels
-   - Through the camera we  the lights in the distance of the tunnel
(whispering) They're down there
Let's go
Animal jumps off the platform, down onto what's left of the tracks
Audrey squeamishly follows
143
-  &  -  -                   143 Nick kneels down to inspect some debris
An old is heard in the distance
Suddenly the ground begins to quake
Dust falling
The gets louder and louder
Raymond moves up to Nick and points ahead
Nick nods in nervous agreement
Just as they move towards the sounds the       next to them
Bursting through the tunnel wall  appears
His enormous claws burrowing, he makes his way through and into the tunnel
Quickly he moves past the team
The team  into a cross tunnel just as the colossal beast  past them, barely missing them
144
23RD    -            144 Audrey and Animal have just gotten into the tunnel entrance
The entire place is shaking
Audrey is in a panic
Animal, let's get out of here
But Animal hoists his camera and starts filming as is moving  them
Audrey is tugging at him as the shaking gets more violent
With all her strength, she finally gets Animal to start moving backwards
Just as they're out of the tunnel, the outward
Audrey and Animal  into the maintenance ducks along side the tracks to avoid collision
- Animal is shielding Audrey with his body
She looks up just in time to  Godzilla   and out through the ceiling
An amazing site
Shoot
Shoot it
Animal grabs his camera and gets the last moment of it disappearing from view
Once gone, they both break into enormous sighs of relief and nervous laughter
145
-                                          145 Recovering, Raymond and the team walk back into the main tunnel
They near the hole Godzilla just created, examining it
Nick climbs into the hole
guess we go this way
Raymond and his men follow
146
-   -  -                 146 Major Hicks is at the radio as the Generals sit behind him
(into radio) Sergeant, status
147
-  -                            147 The park is bathed in light
Armed troops surround the area
Tanks and missile launchers are in place
Sergeant 'Neal kneels down by a sandbag fortification

-   - Moving steadily towards central park, Godzilla makes his way up seventh avenue
Got him
Section 5, heading north to target
149
-  ' -                  149 The Sergeant gives the nod and several teams of shooters take off running, taking positions
The tanks turn their gun turrets towards downtown, expectantly
Missile launchers turn, arming devices locked

151
-  -                       151 Godzilla moves up 7th Ave
He reaches Central Park South and
He glances over to the park where bright lights are glaring
Something is making Godzilla more cautious this time
Unsure he vacillates between moving forward and staying within the shelter of the tall buildings
- ' - ' (into radio) Don't fire until he's cleared the buildings and has moved into the park
- Still unsure, he  out, frustrated with his own indecision
' Come on, come on
152
-  -                                 152 Nick leads the team through the cross town tunnel created by Godzilla
Climbing over the debris, they make their way to another opening
We  them as they clamber through the hole and into
153
-  -                      153 The largest subway/rail station in New York
Godzilla has torn it to shreds
We get the feeling this is where Godzilla has spent most of his time
Scattered fish abound
High above, there is a immense black hole in the tall ceiling
Wherever it leads to is very dark
Nick and Raymond stare at the hole together
What is up there
154
34TH  -   -   -       154 Climbing the stairs out from the subway, Nick et all walk up onto the street to
The team cautiously approaches the building
155

' (into radio) Prepare to fire
Guns are cocked, locked on and hoisted
Suddenly Godzilla gets cold feet and starts to turn around
156
-   -  -                 156 The   suddenly begins to move away from the park
(into radio) Damn it
Fire
Shoot it before it gets away
157
-  -                            157 ' Fire at will
Fire at will
All the weapons surround the area
Several more Cobra Helicopters   out of nowhere
Plunging downward, they  at Godzilla
The firepower ripping up everything around him, Godzilla and deftly  out of the park and back between the buildings
But as he bounds over to 57th street, there is a contingency of    waiting
They Godzilla  and the rockets as Godzilla races by
With the helicopters right on his tail, Godzilla makes a westward run across 57th street
Smashing parked vehicles and his tail  buildings as it
Godzilla is heading straight for it, the helicopters from the air
Suddenly Godzilla  higher than we've seen before
He hurls himself  the West Side Highway and   into the Hudson River, vanishing beneath the water's surface
158
-   -  -                 158 Furious, Major Hicks throws his headset against the console violently
leans down into frame
Don't worry
The Navy has a little something there waiting for him
In the murky waters of the Hudson river

-   -  -         159 The alarm  are   as everyone rushes to battle stations
The  moves over to a sonar screen; a large  nearby blips on the screen
(into radio) We've got him on sonar
Arizona closing in
160
-  -                            160 Different monitors have put up a three dimensional schematic of the Hudson river
We  outlines of the three nuclear subs approaching their target
(filtered) Indiana, closing in
Calvin Coolidge, closing in
161
-    -  -           161 The doors are pried open
It's very dark in here, only the assault team's flashlights illuminate
As they enter the lobby, the team splits up into different search groups
Nick, Raymond and Jean-Claude move down the large front lobby and turn down one of the many hallways surrounding the main auditorium
-  -   - Cautiously they move towards us
In the distance we see the rest of the team moving the other direction
Raymond and Nick arrive at a door leading to the main auditorium
Nick is about to push the door open when Raymond stops him
Jean-Claude
On command, Jean-Claude snaps together his automatic rifle as Raymond pulls out his semi-automatic pistol
He nods "okay" to Nick who slowly opens the door
As the door opens a small pile of  tumbles down over their feet
They step over the fish and enter
162
-   -  -          162 Total darkness
Nick, Raymond and Jean-Claude cautiously step over the fish inside
Only their flashlight beams can be seen
'
- His beam cruises over the area nearby
It's been gutted
Fish lay strewed on the floor everywhere
Suddenly Nick spots a strange cluster of
He moves closer
Raymond follows
With their combined light we can pile of reptile eggs nearly twice as tall as they are
Raymond walks behind the egg, illuminating it from the other side, making it partially translucent
We can inside the egg and ' Three eggs
thought there would be more
You were right
Slowly Nick turns and  what Jean-Claude is staring at open jawed
Together their beams of light scan across the main auditorium floor surrounding the gaping hole to discover piled in clumps everywhere
That can't be
That's got to be over twenty eggs
163
-  -                           163 Another of Raymond's men (- #2) has found a switchboard, he examines the switches
164
-  -                            164 Animal and Audrey are wandering through the debris
Okay, where'd they go from here
165
-  -                           165 - #2 locates the switch he's looking for and hits it
166
-  -                              166 Nick, Raymond and Jean-Claude are stunned as the work lights suddenly   illuminating the room, revealing
All over the main auditorium floor

Nick is speechless
Raymond turns to him
Start counting
167
-                                    167 The light filters down from the gaping hole in the ceiling
They must have climbed all the way up into there
Together they notice some large metal piping that has fallen from the auditorium
They move over to it and begin to climb
168
-   -   -        168 The Arizona races past us
169
-   -  -                 169 We follow a runner who hands a report to the Admiral who is conferring with the General and Major Hicks by the schematic
The Admiral reads the report
They've surrounded the target just at the mouth of the Hudson river
170
-  -  -                   170 He swims at enormous speed heading directly at the Arizona
171
-  -  -                     171 The lights dim as they prepare for battle
Are we locked on
Locked on, Captain

At the same moment both submarines  their torpedoes
Godzilla reaches the underwater shoreline of Manhattan and begins
As his gigantic claws start  up earth, an enormous  of clouds and dirt cloud the waters around him, cloaking him

They got 'em
The Generals congratulate each other and Major Hicks
187
-  -                              187 Toppling down out of the murky turbulence, we Godzilla falling away from the shoreline, backwards the ocean floor, drifting down to the bottom of the Hudson river like so many cement shoed gangsters
188
-  -                   188 Raymond and his men are laying out the plastic explosives around the room by the clumps of eggs
Jean-Claude walks up to Raymond
- We do not have enough explosives
Raymond turns and sees Nick, across the room studying a group of eggs
Raymond goes towards him
-   -  - Crawling out from the hole in the center of the floor, Animal and Audrey appear
They're stunned at what they see
Quickly Animal hoists his camera and begins to film as an amazed Audrey walks through
-    - - Kneeling down along side the eggs, Nick examines them
Raymond approaches
Nick, we have a problem
Nick silences him with a gesture as he moves in to listen to the egg
He leans his ear against the shell
Suddenly we  a loud
Nick jumps backwards
The shell  and an large  opens up across the egg
As we hear other
, Nick turns and more eggs beginning to open all around them
-    - Hidden in this forest of tall eggs, Animal leans in close to one getting video footage of it cracking
Audrey nervously watches
What she doesn't see, however, is a , fish hanging from its jaw, as it approaches from behind
- Stunned, they can only stare as the of his shell and gives a mini version of the famous think we should leave now
Good idea
The  kneels down and immediately starts the dead fish laying nearby
Cautiously Nick and Raymond slowly back away until they are a far enough distance, they they break into a run and head for the exit
-    - The Babyzilla continues to chomp on its fish as it nears Audrey
Animal continues to shoot the cracking egg
(whispered) One more second
This is fantastic
Just then Animal turns to  the Babyzilla right behind Audrey
Don't you think we have enough
Yes
Definitely
Definitely enough
Audrey turns to see what Animal is staring at
Her eyes go  as she backs up into Animal
Another appear on the other side of them
Just be calm
Don't startle them
Animal leads Audrey backwards as they make their way towards the large "team" entrance at the end of the floor
The two Babyzillas swallow their fish and begin to  the air
Audrey moves up the isle
An egg  and an breaks out through a shell,
Audrey and frantically she  herself free
They both suddenly take off running
189
-  -                              189 Nick and Raymond race to the stairwell
Raymond pulls out his radio
(into radio) Everyone, outside
Now
- - - -  - Laying down the plastic explosives
Hearing the radio, he drops what they're doing just as several eggs near them begin to
Quickly he and his partner take off running
190
-   -                     190 Two other men are still laying cables for the explosives
One of them is kneeling in a pile of near the eggs
- #2 Come on, let's go
- #3 One moment
've almost got this
Just then a  pops up behind the eggs, a fish in his mouth
He  the fish and begins He turns and stares directly at the slowly retreating - #3
He smells his own hands and realizes he smells like fish, quickly he turns and
But Babyzilla is faster
He runs up from behind and onto - #3's back
- #2 begins to  at Babyzilla just as another one   from the side
In moments, they are both devoured
191
- - -                     191 Audrey and Animal reach the entrance and race inside
The main exit doors are locked from the outside
They turn back just as
appear in the team entrance doorway
Audrey  something, grabs Animal's wrist and pulls him to one of the Locker room doors
It's open
192
-                               192 Through the door we  the Babyzilla approaching as Audrey and Animal leap inside, slamming the door behind them
There is a sudden  against the door
Animal rushes over to a large   and, with all his strength,  it over, blocking the door
Great
Now what do we do
193
- - -                            193 Nick and Raymond run up to another open doorway and look inside
'
- Dozens and dozens of eggs everywhere begin to awaken and immediately begin to devour all the fish
Babyzilla appears only feet away and turns and stares directly at us
Quickly Raymond slams the doors shut as they both retreat back into the hallway
Raymond  the glass covering of a nearby   and raps it around the door handles, locking it closed
Suddenly a loud  as something begins to  against the locked doorway
We've got to lock them inside while we can
Raymond tosses his cellular phone to Nick
Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape
How do  do that
555-7600
Tell them it's a code dragonfly
They should get you through
Amazed by Raymond, Nick just stares at him
What are you waiting for
Nick snaps out of it and dials
(filtered) all circuits are busy right now
Please hang up and try again
194
-  -                194 large and  mob has gathered at the roadblock to the bridge
People, their cars packed with belongings, are screaming to be let back into Manhattan
Horns honk and the blockade guards are getting nervous
195
-  -                            195 The Mayor marches over to Major Hicks who is consulting with the Generals
Do you have any idea what's going on out there
The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body
That thing's dead
What the hell are we waiting for
Just then Elise rushes over to the Major
Major, if Nick is right, this could be our last chance to do something about it
We have to search for the nest, now
Major Hicks is torn
Finally he nods in agreement, turning to another officer
Organize a search party
want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system
You don't have the authority to do that
The Major turns and cooly approaches the Mayor
Try and stop me
Major Hicks smiles at the Mayor who exits, petulantly
196
-    -  -        196 We  dozens and dozens of Babyzillas fighting with each other over the last of the fish
Suddenly this image is   as doors are closed and a is rapped around door handles
We widen to reveal
Raymond fastening the hose around the door
Secured, Raymond takes off running
197
-  -                 197 Nick is on the pay phone frantically dialing as Raymond comes up
We hear a  signal from the phone
Nick dials again
What'd they say
can't get through
don't know what's wrong
(filtered) all circuits are busy right now
Jean-Clude and his partner arrive
- We've secured the doors on both levels
Where's Luc and Pierre
- They didn't make it
(quickly recovering) Nick, my men and  will hold them here
You will have to go and get help
Nick nods in agreement and takes off down stairs
The rest of the team   their automatic rifles and prepare for a fight
198
-                                     198 Animal and Audrey are checking out every corner of the room
There's got to be another way out of here
Audrey climbs up onto a table and yanks out a grate covering the air vent
Think we can fit up in there
Only one way to find out
He rushes over to her and helps her climb up inside
199
-  -                            199 Jean-Claude sends Luc up ahead as they guard the doorways
loud  is heard on the door they are guarding
Each turns their weapon towards the doors
Suddenly a portion of
leaping through the plaster
As they spill out into the hall, Jean-Claude attempts to open One of the Babyzilla's is
His brothers
Luc from the other side tries to lay down cover fire but he's overrun by the herd
200
-    -                      200 Nick comes racing down the stairs and into the hallway
Just then, he passes a locked door,  on the other side
Just up ahead he can  the main lobby
But before he can get there, a   is heard as the locked door in front of him    as
Flood into the main lobby only a few yards ahead
Nick slams on the breaks and quietly tries to back away
He turns to run the other directions when
Come   the locked door behind him
Pinned down with no way out
Nick  the elevator nearby and races over, slamming his hand against the button
Come on, come on
The Babyzillas by the front door spot Nick
couple of them start to    and start to move towards him
Behind, the Babyzilla also catch the scent and turn
This is not good
Just then the elevator doors open, Nick  inside
201
-                                        201 Nick frantically pushes the   button but it's painfully slow to react
hate these things
Just then the Babyzillas appear
They're just about to move in when the doors finally
Nick breaths a sigh of relief just as a loud  is heard as one of them  against the door
It's too late, the elevator begins to rise
202
-  -                                202 Climbing upward, Animal reaches a plateau and crawls into cross vent
He reaches back and grabs his camera
Putting it down he turns back and helps Audrey up and in
You okay
Out of breath, she nods
Animal takes the lead again, pushing his camera in front of him
He reaches another vent that looks down
He's about to pull it free when something catches his eye
'
-   - Standing guard, automatic rife in hand, Raymond appears with his back toward us
Animal lifts his camera to shoot
(whispered) What
What is it
Animal doesn't answer, he just shoots
203
-                                         203 The elevator doors open and Raymond  his gun around ready to shoot
Frightened, Nick throws his hands in the air
Hey, it's me
204
-                                            204 Audrey has pushed her way up alongside of Animal to peer down through the grating

-                                         205 Nick keeps dialing the cell phone, still busy
They're loose
They're allover the main lobby
couldn't get out
Just then the vents above  and Animal and Audrey come tumbling down
In a flash, Raymond has his weapon trained on their heads
Who the hell are you
It's okay
know her
Raymond turns his gun towards the fallen video camera and , ripping the camera apart
Hey
What gives
No cameras
Nick moves to Audrey's side, helping her up
What are you doing here
thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs
was wrong
Just then a   is heard against the near locked door
The  gets louder and heavier
Do you have a radio, a walkie-talkie
Anything we can use to contact the outside
What about the phones
Circuits are overloaded
(gets an idea) know a way
know how you can get a message out of here
The door   and   stampede into the hallway
Audrey is fast on her feet
This way
She takes off running and they follow
The Babyzillas give chase
Animal, hangs back and runs over to the destroyed video camera and
Just as he does, the Babyzillas are nearly on top of him
He dashes off
-    - Audrey gets there first and opens the small doorway that leads to a back stairwell, she ushers the rest inside
She slams the door behind her as the Babyzillas appear and begin to  the doorway
206
-   -  -                  206 They spill out into the hall and rush past all the luxury boxes overlooking the auditorium
Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here
How do you know
Our network covers the Ranger games
207
- -    -                     207 The Babyzillas are gathered by the doorway
One of the more aggressive ones starts to  at the door, into it
Another charges it,

-                              208 They rush up to a door marked
Audrey tries the door, it's locked
Animal charges his shoulder into it, but it doesn't give
Raymond gently moves Animal out of the way and the lock to pieces
He opens the door for everyone to enter
209
-  -                         209 They rush into the empty broadcast booth
Animal turns on the lights as Audrey goes over and boots the computer terminal
Raymond moves some equipment against the door, securing it closed
The network is on an intranet
It's a direct feed into our computer system
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than did
That stumps her
Animal gets an idea
When you worked with them, did they monitor the news broadcasts
(getting the idea) Yes, they did
We'll go live
We'll broadcast from here
Hopefully they'll see it
210
- -    -                     210 More of the creatures have gathered by the door
Two more  and the door collapses
The Babyzillas rush up the stairs

Caiman is on
(filtered) Yes, the threat is over but the pain continues
Suddenly Ed's computer begins to
Ed slides his chair over and looks at his monitor
It reads : He double clicks it and a letter pops up that reads
Ed pick up transponder  1 and watch the feed
(to himself) There's no Ranger game on tonight
Ed makes a couple of adjustments on his controls and turns on a blank monitor
He

If you're seeing this, Ed, please put us on Live
This is urgent

Please, trust me
(incredulous) 'm not putting you on live
212
-                                 212 Nick turns on a small television and we still  Caiman doing the news
Audrey turns to Animal
He's not going to do it
Oh yes he will
Animal turns the camera and points out the window at the ' below
213
-                                 213 Ed's eyes nearly pop out of his head
(filtered) Ed, you see that
They'll be all over the city if we don't stop them
Ed rushes over to the console and goes to work
214
-                                    214 The mode is festive
The Generals are preparing to leave as is Major Hicks
Sergeant 'Neal and some of his men are watching the t

(filtered) as our fears have been allayed thanks to the dedicated work of our boys in uniform
Everyone in the room begins to cheer
Suddenly Caiman's image goes fuzzy
In a moment it's replaced by Audrey

Are we live

and gives her the thumbs up
We're live from inside Madison Square Garden where Dr
Niko Tatopoulos has discovered the beasts lair
Doctor, tell us what is happening here
Animal swerves the camera over to Nick
Raymond stays back behind the camera, watching
We've discovered over two hundred eggs which began hatching only moments ago
216
-                            216 The creatures come bursting out of the stairwell and flood into the hall
Sniffing around they pick up the scent and take off
217
-                                    217 Soldier tugs on Major Hicks shoulder, try to get his attention
What is it
You better see this
The Major turns around just in time to  Nick on the t
v
If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape
(
) Oh my God
They're coming
The camera  to  through the luxury booths across from them, the dozens of Babyzillas approaching

Oh my God
On the screen the image turns to Nick
(filtered) If those creatures escape and multiply, in a very short time a new species will emerge
One that could replace us as the dominant species of this planet

Tell them we're on the way
220
-  -                         220 Raymond spots a large spool of co-axle cable
Quickly he ties it to the support beam
Reporting live from Madison Square Garden, this is Audrey Timmonds, 221
'  -  -                    221 Everyone is breathless watching the news
Lucy beams
That's my girl
222
-                                 222 Animal lowers the camera and everyone is silent
Thanks, Audrey
The computer beeps, Animal reads the message
The good news is they got the message
The bad news is we've got five and a half minutes to get out of the building
Suddenly the room  as the Babyzillas begin crashing against the blocked door
Raymond jumps to his feet
Okay, party's over
Time to leave
With that he  bullets into the front glass window Glass rains down below
Raymond tosses the spool of cable out the broken window
Anyone care to join me
Animal dislodges one of the video cameras, hoists it on his shoulder and moves over to join Raymond
223
- -18  -  -                223 Several -18's prepare to take flight
We focus on one, an enormous bomb attached under its wing
The -18 taxis away from us
224
-  -              224 Repelling down from the broken window of the broadcast booth, Animal and Raymond land on the upper-level balcony
Raymond signals to the others to follow
225
-                                 225 Audrey and Nick are nervous as they stare at the long drop down
The door is begging to give way from the repeated
Suddenly Audrey leans over and kisses Nick
In case  can't later
With that she  out, repelling downward
Nick is stunned by the unexpected kiss
Suddenly the door and the Babyzilla  into the room
Nick jumps
226
-                                226 Audrey hits the ground followed by Nick
Raymond leads as they make their way out
On the other end of the room some Babyzilla appear in a doorway and watch our friends scurry away
The Babyzillas take off in hot pursuit
227
- -18  -                     227 The -18's fly in formation
Their leader carrying the same bomb we saw loaded earlier
228
-  -  -                     228 Raymond, guns in each hand, comes rushing into the hallway
He  a small group of Babyzillas down the hall and gestures for the group to go the other way
Raymond backs away, guns trained on the Babyzillas who the air and decide to pursue
Raymond turns and runs
-    -    - As they tear forward they nearly run smack into a heard of several dozen Babyzillas who are tearing the concession stands to ribbons looking for food
Spotted, the Babyzillas  forward after the team
Raymond spots the escalators across the hall
The escalators, hurry

-   -             230 The team races into the corridor
Animal reaches down and hits the  button near the moving stairs
The escalator comes to life
The team runs down the "down" escalators as the Babyzillas flood into the corridor
Some try to go down the "up" escalator and fall all over themselves
Others are spooked by the moving down escalator
Finally, the brave ones begin to  down the "down" escalator
231
-                              231 Racing out of the escalator corridor the team moves into the main lobby and
They are surrounded on all sides by Babyzillas
Like the scene in Hitcock's "The Birds" it is eerily still as everyone freezes
232
- -18' -                     232 Closing over the city, the lead bomber breaks formation, flying lower, closer to the rooftops

The chandelier  and  in the center of the main lobby
The Babyzillas scatter, opening a pathway to the front door
Go
Now
Raymond  the team forward as he takes the rear through the pathway which begins to close up as they pass through
The Babyzillas recover and begin to charge
As Raymond passes some  , he grabs one and to the ground
Scatter all over the floor
As the Babyzillas run, they begin to stumble allover each other, tripping on the gum balls
Animal is the first to reach the main door, he opens it and Audrey and Nick are the first to exit
Raymond, behind as he rushes for the door

We can see it's heading directly for 237
-                          237 Raymond exits and Animal shuts the door behind him
The Babyzillas  against the doors
It takes all of Animal's and Raymond's strength to hold the doors closed
Raymond slides his rifle barrel between the handles as a temporary lock
He pulls Animal away and they take off running
'
-   - Rapidly approaching the famous forum
- , Not far behind Nick and Audrey as they race from the building
Behind them we
Collide and an   , engulfing the entire building in a mountain of flame
Raymond, Animal, Audrey and Nick are  several feet forwards, toppling to the ground from the incredible impact
As the building  in  we  several of the Babyzillas
Soon they are silenced
Slowly Nick sits up and turns to Audrey
They're both shaken up
Nick touches her cheek gently
Are you okay
Somehow  never thought your life was this exciting
You'd be surprised
Really
'd like to find out
She hugs him tightly
Nick smiles
Animal turns to Raymond who has cut above his eye
Hey Man, you all right
could use a coffee
We begins to pull away from this tableau, slowly lifting upwards when suddenly
Is heard
Then, violently  up through the ashes, a very angry emerges
Bleeding from his injuries, Godzilla leans down and nuzzles the burned out remains of his young
For the first time in the film we can  a partial expression of Godzilla's face; pain
But quickly that pain turns to burning anger as he focuses his hatred downwards, staring directly, and accusingly, at our heroes
Ohhhhhhhh
shit
What do we do
Running would be a good idea
And they do just as Godzilla
Fortunately our team  around a corner just in time
238
-                                     238 As our heroes come rushing around a corner, Godzilla the building in front of them, sealing off their exit
Raymond notices a very narrow alley
- Raymond leads them through this slim alley between to large brick buildings
They run for their lives as Godzilla appears behind them
His claws are too big to reach into the alley so he his way into it, the building ripping apart as he marches forward
Bricks go  as debris showers down on our team just they make their way to the other side
Slowed down by the the position of the alley, Godzilla his arms violently to clear a path
239
29TH  -  -                       239 Racing from the alley Raymond races over to a parked 240
-  -                                240 In one deft move, Raymond draws a screwdriver out of his belt, pops the ignition device off the steering column and hot wires the car in under 15 seconds
It's amazing
As he does this the others pile into the car
Not even completely all in, Raymond takes off as soon as the engine turns over
Animal nearly falls out
241
29TH  -  -                       241 Just as  bursts out from between the buildings the   away, squealing around the next corner

8TH  -  -                        242 Power sliding around the wet street corner, the Yellow Cab  onto 8th Ave
Whipping around the corner behind them Godzilla appears
As he's  faster, he nearly overtakes the car in a single  but the cab   moving down another street

27TH  -                                     243 The cab darts onto 27th street

245
-                                  245 Using this small cut-across, the cab quickly exits out onto the next main street (28th)
Godzilla rushes down the side street, his  shattering buildings as he does
246
-                                             246 Animal fumbles with his camera trying to get it to power up
The light goes  and Animal quickly holsters it and begins filming out the shattered back window
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the
The
In the rain

248
-  -                                     248 What are you talking about
The east side is always faster
But we can get to the west side faster
Through the rear window we  Godzilla  down trying to take a bite
The cab, again,  wildly, darting down a side street
Somebody make up your mind
& Take central park

He   and  up ahead
250
28TH  -                                     250 The last two turns of the cab have temporarily disoriented Godzilla who looks around to find the cab
He moves up a block and begins to look around
'
-  -  - Several blocks ahead, Godzilla spots the cab
He narrows his eyes and
Suddenly he  after the cab

Sergeant 'Neal  as the cab  out from behind the trees
' What the hell
The cab   right past and out of the Meadow again just as   directly into the clean up crew
Soldiers  for cover as others scramble out of the way
Godzilla  after the cab, his tail  several vehicles which tumble, crashing into the troops
In a flash, Godzilla disappears back into the forest on the other side
'Neal grabs his radio
' Command, Command, this Sergeant 'Neal
He's back

Captain Rogers, do we still have those -18's in the air
They're heading back to base now, sir
Turn 'em around
254
-  -                               254 The cab heads up the deserted streets, racing full tilt

Anyone see him
Suddenly from behind, Animal spots the creature several blocks behind
Again, he lifts the camera

Raymond decides to take it

The large cement   into the roof of the creature's mouth, preventing him from crushing the cab with his teeth

'                                       265 The sign supports will not hold much longer as it crumbles just above the cab
The torn electric cables dangerous close to the cab
Godzilla  his  towards the back of the car, trying to draw it into his throat

Grabbing the cable with his wrapped hand, he into Godzilla's
Nick leans back inside, slamming the door shut

Landing, hard, onto the pavement, the cab  , burning rubber as it enters the George Washington Bridge
Godzilla  only to realize he didn't get them
Seeing the cab on the bridge Godzilla gives chase
271
271 The cab races towards us when Godzilla His enormous weight makes the entire bridge The Cab goes airborne then bottoms out as it returns to the asphalt as the bridge undulates beneath them
It's as though they were driving during an earthquake
With each stride Godzilla takes, the bridge becomes more unstable

The cab is able to make some distance

Again out, his forward motion stopped

Slowly he

His last breath escaping
Defeated and weary, his eyes blink slowly as we watch his life slip away
Oddly, Nick stares sympathetically at Godzilla's sad and lifeless face
The stunned silence melts away as the mob behind them begins to applaud nervously, then vigorously
The mob breaks through the blockade and rushes over to our heroes, surrounding them
Cheering enthusiastically

Several news crews fight their way through the crowd

Dr
Tatopoulis, can you tell us what happened back there
Sorry, guys, 've promised my story as an exclusive to another reporter

Way to go, Audrey
We

Caiman,  quit
Audrey waves goodbye as Animal walks over, checking his camera and his coat pocket
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera
No
Where's Raymond
They look around, but he's gone
Nowhere to be seen

phone begins to
Nick checks his pockets and finds Raymond's cellular phone
Nick answers
Hello
(

Where are you

just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend
Wait

move closer and closer to the solitary egg
Just as we are about to collide with it
