: - It's an early Friday morning and a patrol car drives up an unpaved road and parks next to a gutted police car on cinder blocks
The camera pans with the  as he exits his car and walks up to a ramp leading to the babay blue
He is carrying a greasy bag of fast food
- The Officer enters the lobby, tosses the bag of food to his who is sitting at a desk
He grabs a tin cup and walks over to barred entrance to Block
Twenty or so , from drunks to drug dealers are sleeping peacefully in their cell on Block
The Officer rattles the tin cup between the entrance bar
- The inmates stir, rubbing their dirty faces and trying to sit up
The camera dollies slowly down the narrow hallway of the block which has three cells: Two small ones side by side, and one bigger cell that faces the block entrance
The sound of scribbling and business dealing can be heard from inside the cell
It is  jottin ginto a business ledger while chatting on his cellular phone
His cell is equipped with a small desk and a refridgerator
He hangs up the phone and continues writing
- The Officer with the tin cup sits in a couch across from his partner, who is now eating, and reads a magazine
- Azul picks up his phone and makes another call
He talks business
In the other cell, prisoners are getting up and looking around
Azul hangs up the phone and writes
'  - gorgeous, bikini-clad  struts slowly into a tighly framed glamour shot
She pauses, takes a deep breath, then dives a 'perfect ten' dive into a house-side moat
She swims long, slow motion strokes around the moat as the camera tracks alonside her, lovingly admiring her tan lines and hydrodynamic build
She slides out of the water and walks up a cobble stone walk, dripping as she passes a seated in a white suit
His face is unrevealed
As she enters the house, he sets his drink down by a phone
He lifts up the receiver and dials
2
- Azul's phone rings
He looks up at it, startled, as if no one has ever called him before
He glances at his watch, and then back at the phone, hesitating to answer it
He looks around the cell block as if someone might be playing a trick on him
Finally he answers it, pausing before saying hello
It is El Moco
(
) Good morning, Azul
Do you know who this is
(into phone) Moco
What the hell do you want after all these years
'  - is sitting on his porch drinking tequila
(into phone) We've got a lot to talk about
'm just a few town away with a whole new gang heard you were nearby so  thought 'd give you a call, amigo
(
) That's sweet of you, asshole
don't suppose you could get me out of there, and then maybe hand me over my share of money
(into phone) Yes,  figured you'd want your money, my friend
That is why  have called you heard you were getting out soon, and figured  should deal with our situation
But do you really need me to help you get out
From what  hear, you're running quite a business out of your cell with a phone and some loyal men
It keeps you well protected  hear
Not a bad idea may try that myself sometime
(
) could stay in here and earn peanuts compared to what you owe me if  were to get out
So, yes,  want you to help me
my friend
() 3
: (into phone) Soon my friend, soon
'm sending you some people in a few days to get you
(
) Really
Well, that's more like it
Just like the Moco  used to know
Azul is walking towards his window at the sound of a truck racing in
(into phone) Just hang in there my friend
won't forget that you have been a big part of our success
What's wrong
- large truck drives up to the jail, parking beside the police car
Two tall, well-dressed  step out
They reach into the cab and pull out machine guns
They walk briskly towards the jail
- Azul walks to his toilet and stands on it to see out his barred window
(into phone) There's something going on outside
Is this a double surprise
Are you getting me out today, Moco
There is no response from Moco
- The Guard reading the magazine stands when he sees someone approaching the door
- Close tracking shot of guns as Tall Men open the door and enter the jail
- Azul looks out of the jail cell suspiciously
Peering down the hall, he sees the guys with the guns
He hides behind the wall, peering out to see what happens next
4
- The Tall Men walk right up to the guard, and hand him a huge wad of money
The Guard tosses the money to his partner (still eating), then turns to unlock the block entrance bars
- Azul puts the receiver back up to his mouth
(into phone) There are two men here with guns
Did you send them
'  - Moco, glancing at his watch, hangs up
- Azul hangs up the phone and kicks his Bodyguard awake
The Bodyguard gets up and peers out the bars as Azul hides in a corner
- The Tall Men walk steady and alert, ready to kill
They enter Azul's block and scope out the cells
The Bodyguard, seeing the tall men, retrieves his shotgun from under his mattress and grabs his machete from under the sink
He stands ready to fight
The Tall Men move slowly towards the big cell, somewhat cautious
They see the Bodyguard a second too late, for he sticks the shotgun between the bars, and shoots one of them before they can react
The shot one stumbles back into his buddy's arms
Azul's Bodyguard, amused by all this, opens his cell door effortlessly, and walks out as if to greet them
The Tall Men hear the sound of the other cells opening, so they turn around
The other prisoners on the block begin exiting their cells, carrying guns and Molotov cocktails
The Tall Man drops his gun
Finally, Azul exits his cell carrying his phone
The Bodyguard forces the Tall Men into an empty cell, closing and locking the door
Azul presses the #-button on his phone
Moco's phone number is automatically redialed
Moco answers
() 5
: (into phone) 'm still here, Moco
And so are your little friends
But not for long
They have something they want to scream to you
Listen close, because you're going to repeat it to me when  come to visit you
- The cellmates throw their Molotov cocktails into the cell
Moco hears the men screaming as they burn to death
Azul is holding the phone at arm's length into the cell
- The Guards exchange glances when they hear the screaming, they smile and shrug, then go back to what they were doing
As Azul and his Bodyguards exit the block, the Guard with the magazine stands up as if to stop them, but Azul tosses him a wad of money and the guard sits back down to count it
- blue truck races towards the jail
Azul exits the jail carrying a shotgun
His Bodyguards get inside the Tall Men's truck and start it
Azul waits patiently for his blue truck
As the blue truck pulls up, two little rat-like  exit the blue truck, one handing Azul a guitar case
Azul tosses it onto the hood
The Bodyguards wave as they drive away
Azul waves back
He opens the case, revealing an arsenal of weaponry
Azul notices one piece is missing
One Rat quickly pulls the missing weapon from his jacket and replaces it in the case
Azul is unamused
He grabs his -10 machine gun from the guitar case and aims it at the thieving Rat's head
Suddenly, the Guard bolts out the jail waving the wad of money, as if complaining
Azul turns his -10 onto the Guard instead
few blasts later Azul and his rats pack up and go as the Guard twitches helplessly on the ground, still clutching the money in his bloody hand
/    - The blue truck barels down the highway and the camera pans with the truck as it passes a hitchhiker, , standing in the sun with a thumb in the air
() 6
: The truck    passes him up so he continues walking
Mariachi is carrying    a guitar case in one hand and a black jacket in the other
He    is wearing a white -shirt, black pants
The camera pans to a    sign that reads " 18 miles"
- Mariachi is walking around downtown Acuna
He notices a bar across the street and, liking the way it looks, he puts on his jacket and crosses over to it
He stops to read a sign on the building that says "  - "
He prays silently to himself before confidently walking inside
- Mariachi enters the club, greeting the     as ge makes his way to the bar
No one seems to greet him    back
He sits on a barstool near some  , laying    his guitar case down lovingly beneath his stool
He looks    around the place, as if sizing it up
What do you want to drink
Refresco
The other drinkers stare at him
Glancing around the room, Mariachi notices a small, table- shaped object draped with a cloth in one corner of the room
Sitting directly behind him are four mean-looking dudes
Mariachi is served his drink
(') No hay musica
(cleaning a glass) Why
'm a mariachi
good one
play beautiful ballads, old classic ballads, on an old-fashioned guitar
So what
() 7
: could add a little class to this place
work for fairly cheap,  live mostly off tips
But  need steady work, and can guarantee bringing in more customers
(nodding) Tell me, why would  need one little guitar player when 've already got a full band
Mariachi gives him a silent "what" look
The  motions to a   sitting near the small draped table
The Young Man removes the drape revealing a keyboard
Puts on his mariachi hat, dips his fingers into his shot glass and rubs his fingers together (as if warming up for the big show)
He hits a few switches in   as
Mariachi adjusts himself to the seat
The Young Men gently taps one switch and the keyboard sounds like an accordion, pulsing out a beat
He then presses another switch and a horn section swells to a crescendo and waltzes the familiar riffs
He adds the string and horns accents by banging on the keys
He sounds awful
Mariachi grimaces slightly then turns back to the Bartender who seems to enjoy it
The Keyboard Mariachi finishes his song, sits back down
(') (nodding with satisfaction) There you see
Either  can pay one guy to sound like a full mariachi band
Mariachi picks up his guitar and lays some money next to his full drink
He looks disappointed
(') or  could spend the same money only get one little guitar player
Understand
(walking away) Thank you, sir
() 8
: (2) You want to earn a living
Get a real musical instrument
The Bartender picks up the bottle of soda pop Mariachis left behind and offers it to the other men on the table
They say no, pay, and leave
The Bartender offers it to the at the table
They all shake their heads no
The Bartender shrugs and dumps it
- Mariachi walks out and looks up and down the street
He decides to walk south
As he walks down the sidewalk, the camera pans into a of another guitar case that is moving towards the Corona Club
The camera falls back a little revealing the backside of Azul, dressed also in black
Azul walks into the bar
- Azul enters the bar, notices to his left the table with the four mean-looking Dudes, drinking and eating chips and salsa
The oldest one, with his back to Azul, takes a sip from his mixed drink, then stands and excuses himself to the restroom
-    - The Old Mean Dude walks into the first stall and sits down
-  - The three remaining Dudes notice Azul's guitar case
So does the Bartender
They all look at each other and laugh
(laughing and rolling his eyes) What the hell is this, mariachi day
There is no work for you here
Azul walks the mean Dude's table
Their laughing quiets down a bit as Azul stands before them
The Bartender stops smiling
Bartender
one beer
() 9
: The Bartender nods and grabs a frosty glass
He begins to fill up at the tap
(') (without looking at him) In a bottle, wey
Bartender stops filling the beer, stares at the half-full glass for a moment, then drinks the beer
Azul is staring at the three Mean Dudes
They stare back
The Bartender slaps the unopened bottle down at the counter
Ready
Azul doesn't pay attention to him
'm looking for an old friend of mine
His name is
Moco
Do you know where can find him
You can sometimes find him here
He owns this place
So you know him
We work for him
That's too bad
Azul turns to the mean Dude sitting to his left, and places the guitar in his hands
The Mean Dude is confused
(') Hold it please
Azul opens the case and pulls out the -10
The other two Mean Dudes are already reaching for their pistols
The Bartender ducks beneath the counter
Azul fires a million bullets into two of the Mean Dudes, (the other is holding the case in shock)
Their chests explode, causing neat little dollops of flesh and blood fly everywhere
() 10
: The Mean Dude holding the guitar case is frozen with fear
He manages to look up at Azul, who is watching the Mean Dudes die a slow, bloody death
The barrel of the -10 is smoking
Azul turns slowly to the Mean Dude holding the case
Azul aims his -10 in the Dude's face
Still frozen holding the case, he spends his last moments looking down the gun's barrel
- The shots caused Old Mean Dude to peer out from his stall as the toilet paper fell to the ground and started to roll across the floor
He now watches it roll as more shots ring out
He pulls up his pants and and walks toward the door slowly
He is sweating profusely
He slowly picks up the toilet paper, plotting his next move
It grows silent
He takes a deep breath and rushes out the door
- The Old Dude bursts into the room with a roll of toilet paper in his hand, and a sheet of sweat sliding down his face
The Bartender rises up from behind the counter
The camera dollies slowly by the dead Dudes
Their blood- bathed faces twisted into odd shapes and expressions
The camera continues to dolly to the one dead Dude still holding the guitar case
His face is a bloody pulp
The camera stops dollying to the old Dude's mixed drink
hand is stirring it with a straw
The camera pans up the arm to reveal Azul, standing expressionless with his gun sling over his shoulder
Shot at 16fps the Old Dude quickly drops the toilet paper and runs back inside the bathroom
Azul turns to his guitar case and carefully chooses another weapon
He grabs the drink and tosses a napkin over his arm like a waiter, then casually follows the Old Dude into the bathroom
The Bartenders glance at each other
One pours a shot glass full of tequila and raises it to his lips to drink it
Shots ring out and the Bartender spills the drink over himself
Without warning Azul bursts from the bathroom and walks calmly to his case
He replaces the weapon, picks up the case and leaves
few seconds pass before the bartender grabs the phone and furiously dials
() 11
: (into phone) Get me Moco
The door bursts open as Azul reenters, storming to the bar
The Bartender is so petrified he doesn't think to drop the phone
Azul walks right up to the Bartender
The Bartender shuts his eyes
The sound of the beer bottle popping open canbe heard, along with the sound of thirsty guzzling
The Bartender opens his eyes to Azul
of the empty bottle slamming to the counter
The Bartender glances down at the bottle
of Azul tossing a few coins near the bottle as payment
Azul leaves
few seconds pass as the Bartender is standing there
You hear Moco yelling into the receiver asking what's going on
'  - Moco is on the porch trying to get the Bartender to answer him
(into phone) '    ,
-  - You hear Moco's voice through the phone
The camera dollies into the Bartender as he screams into the receiver
The camera dollies in to the corpses
-  - and finally a low outdoor frontal tracking shot of Azul walking away smiling as the image fades out
- Low angle of Hotel Coahuila sign
#5 enters the frame as his beeper goes off
He runs into the Hotel Coahuila

- Mean Dude #5 enters the lobby where an   is sitting at the counter reading a yellowed newspaper
There is a pit bull on the floor beside him
#5 Da me telefono
(without looking) Take it
Mean Dude #5 grabs the phone and dials Moco's number
He glances down at the   lying on the floor
#5 Pit bull
Yeah, pit bull
The line is picked up and Mean Dude talks into the phone
He pulls out a piece of paper from his coat pocket and places it on the counter
He begins jotting down four names
He then slowly crosses their names out
#5 (into phone) Dead
The Viejo Clerk glances up from his paper
The Pit Bull also glances up
#5 (') (into phone) All of them
How long ago
, What does this guy look like
Clerk goes back to reading his paper
Pit Bull is still paying attention, though

- An inside shot looking out of the front glass reveals Mariachi looking at his wallet as Mean Dude talks to the phone
No one notices him

And what was he wearing

The Pit Bull turns and looks out of the window
Seeing Mariachi, he gets up and walks to it
-  - Mariachi is putting his last few dollars back into his wallet
As he is walking away he notices the Pit Bull and he bends down for a closer look
#5 (into phone) Don't worry, Moco

) Mariachi looks up at the Clerk, then stands

: The Mean Dude turns around and looks and looks at the Clerk
Clerk turns to look at Mean Dude, who is walking back to the counter
Mariachi picks his guitar from the ground
He is in full view, but no one is looking at him
#5 Viejo, if you see anyone new in town, carrying a guitar case, dressed in black
you can call this number,
Mean Dude writes down a phone number and the description of Azul on a little card
(nodding sarcastically) And if  don't call, you'll kill me
(handing him the card) No
won't kill you
he will
The sarcastic smile fades from the old man
Mean Dude walks away
The old man reads the card, then glances out the window
Mariachi is gone
/   #5 Mariachi is turning a corner just as Mean Dude #5 exits the hotel
The Mean Dude walks off in the other direction
' - Mariachi enters Domino's bar
is waiting on a few bar bums that are nursing their jaws
Mariachi sits with them, asks for a refresco, He gets looks again
Domino serves him and he asks to see the owner
She says he's looking at the owner
He then asks her for work as a mariachi
She says she has no money to pay him
He looks arund the classy joint and knows she's lying (it turns out to be true, she has no money)
When he asks how a girl can take care of herself in a town like this she stuffs a gun barrel in his mouth
He nurses his jaw, pays and leaves, as the others laugh
- Mariachi enters the run-down lobby of the motel
The Viejo Clerk at the counter is reading his yellowed newspaper
Mariachi sees the Pit Bull laying by the counter
Pit bull

: Yeah, pit bull

Si, later
Thank you
The Old Man hands Mariachi a key for the second floor
(') Thank you, friend
As Mariachi walks away, the Clerk notices the guitar case and black clothes and he rereads the card Mean Dude left him
(different tone of voice) Uh, excuse me senor
forgot,  need a small deposit
Mariachi stops in his tracks
He turns back to the Clerk slowly
thinking
(walking back slowly) You can trust me
am very sorry, senor
But
how much can you spare
The dog is watching the event
(disappointed) 've only got a few pesos
plan on finding work in town
(grabbing money) Oh, that's enough for now, sir, thank you and
enjoy your stay
The Clerk deposits the money, slams the register shut, and continues reading his yellow paper
Confused, Mariachi pockets his empty wallet and turns to find his room
() 16

He hears the sound of Mariachi's footsteps trailing off
The old man drops the paper and bolts silently to the phone as he dials El Moco's phone number
'   - Mariachi opens his room, tosses his guitar onto the bed and hangs his jacket in the closet
He has only his white -shirt underneath

What happened to you, Mariachi
Too much refresco

He lifts up a bloody hand, grabs a napkin, and then seems to ask permission with his eyes before wiping his hands clean
Is it true
Mariachi nods an ashamed yes
() 22
: Domino reaches for her gun under the counter
The camera is on Mariachi when she brings it out and points at him

Domino
Wait a minute, Domino
It was self- defense
She cocks the pistol
(') (frantic) 'm new in town
don't know everyone
have no friends here
and no enemies
(lowering the gun a bit) Thieves
(nodding) No way
They were well-dressed men checked into the cheapest hotel in town, no money, nothing of value, except this guitar and maybe this coat, which they could have taken when  left my room, but they didn't
They were only interested in killing me
(lifting the gun back up) So why do you come here
You want to get me killed
need a place to stay until  figure this out
They've got me mixed up with someone else
And you've never seen them before
Not even in another town
() 23
: (2) (long pause) Are you saying they followed me, a mariachi, here
What for
Maybe they hate your music
Mariachi stares at her expressionless
She stares back at him
(') Maybe you were singing in another town, they hated your voice, and now they're trying to kill you
Are you serious
(nodding) Yes
She laughes
Are you going to help me, or am  gonna have to die on your porch
have a room upstairs
My room
Don't touch anything
'll be up after awhile and we can call a friend of mine
Mariachi shakes her hand
Thank you

What happened

#5 Dressed all in black, carrying a guitar case
No
#5 Well, he shot me
and has killed ten of Moco's men
all in one day
Domino looks a little upset
She slides the phone towards him a bit
Aren't you gonna call your boss
() 25
: #5 (nodding) have to tell Moco that he got away again
So, you better give me a drink first
Domino smiles and pours him half a beer mug with tequila
He laughs and drinks
As he's dialing, the camera is on Domino as she cleans up a few things, every once in a while glancing upstairs
#5 (') (into phone) Moco, he got away
Shot me in the arm
Killed La Palma
Pepino, Sunday
This guy is one slick maricon
Yeah
Also, didn't get a look at him
So, unless he's still carrying that guitar around and hasn't changed clothes,  won't even spot him, and  don't think he'll be that obvious
(
) Don't worry
If there's one thing  know, it's that he'll always wear black and he'll always carry that guitar with him
It's his signature
Besides, that's not a guitar he's carrying
It's a guitar case full of weapons
Find him
Mean Dude hangs up and puts his head in his hands
Que paso #5 screwed up
The guy left his guitar case in the hotel room
We chased him out, but he came back for the case
Maybe he loves his guitar
It's probably an antique
#5 It wasn't a guitar
It was a guitar case full of weapons that he uses on his victims
Adios, 'm gonna take a nap
And thanks for the drink
Mean Dude #5 stumbles as he tries to stand
() 26
: #5 (') If you see this guy, call us
He is about to walk off with the bloody towel and he turns back pointing at it
She waves her hand at him, as if granting him permission to take it
She cleans his glass, and when he is gone she slams the glass down and runs for the stairs
few seconds later she comes back into the bar, grabs the gun from under the counter and calls her assistant to watch the bar
He sees the gun and wonders what she's up to
She storms upstairs
'  - Domino opens the door abruptly and finds Mariachi taking a bath
He bolts upright, pulls a towel up from the floor and sits frozen waiting for Domino's next move
She laughs and walks to the counter
(friendly) thought  told you not to touch anything
Sorry
needed to relax
can
(smiling) No, it's alright, Finish up
Do you want shampoo
(laying back, closed eyes) Yes, please
Domino turns to a counter and her smile fades
She looks like she wants to rip Mariachi's throat out with her teeth
She puts the gun down on the counter
She finds an omnious- looking knife and then grabs a bottle of shampoo
She walks over to him, then pulls the knife up to his throat with one hand while grabbing his hair with the other
He opens his eyes wide
The shampoo hits the floor and begins to roll
Who are you
(choking) 'm a musician
() 27
: The shampoo bottle rolls into the guitar case and stops
Domino sees this, and with her foot reaches out and pulls the case toward her
What do you have in here
Mariachi tries to catch his breath, pausing before answering her as if wondering if all this is really happening
No
My guitar
Domino slides her foot out of her shoe, and unsnaps one of the latches with her toe
We'll see
She unsnaps another
The latches snap loud and echo in the quiet room
Mariachi gasps as she tightens her grip
(') You're very modest, Mariachi
She squeezes his hair and unsnaps another latch
(') (through gritted teeth) You told me you killed four men, when you really killed seven
Or were they still breathing even after you shot out their hearts
Another latch snaps
(groing dizzy) 'm a mariachi
not a murderer
Aren't you going to watch
She lifts the lid with her foot
It seems an eternity before the case is fully open
Domino is looking into the case, but Mariachi is not
He knows what's in there
() 28
: told you
am a musician
Slow dolly into the case, which contains a white, well-kept classical guitar
Domino is seeing it, and for a moment she almost believes he is telling the truth
She rushes to it, grabs the guitar and tosses it to Mariachi
He catches it, choking after she releases the blade
She is on the other side of the tub, now
She jams the knife down between Mariachi's legs
Mariachi's eyes bug
Play it
(still choking) w
what
Domino shoves the knife in deeper and Mariachi grimaces horribly
Play it, damnit, play something sweet
Mariachi is sweating and his face is extremely red
He pauses for a long time before plucking an odd note
She squints as if she's caught him
But he eventually starts picking out a sweet little melody
(') (growing impatient) Mariachi starts to sing but chokes on the words
He starts over, playing a "Rancho Grande" sounding song with his own made up words
(in a high sweet voice) What is this place
That treats me like a murderer
They've all got their heads up their butts
Even this beautiful girl, With a knife to my balls, Should  kiss her or hit her
Or both
He finishes his song, bowing and thanking his imaginary audience
Domino is smiling
She pulls the knife slowly out of the water and wipes it off on her apron
() 29
: You're a mariachi, all right
And a good one
Mariachi bows a solemn thank you
think this is the best 've ever played
You
inspired me
of the knife
She laughs
(') Hire me
Domino looks at him with a silent "what
"
(') 'm good
Hire me to play in your bar
'll work mostly from tips
But,  need steady work
couldn't pay you
have no money
This fancy place and you have no money
It's the truth
'll work for room and board, then
Please, 'm desperate
(thinking) Will  have to keep a knife at your balls to get you to play like that
(smiling) Not if you're paying me room and board
Please
until  find a permanent job
(thinking) You won't find a permanent job in this town
but
() 30
: (2) She gets up slowly, and turns to leave
Mariachi settles back, smiling triumphantly
Suddenly she darts around and slams the knife between his legs again with a furious look on her face
He bolts up out of this triumphant daze with a look of complete shock
She loosens up and laughs
(') You're going to need a better sense of humor than that, if you're gonna work for me, kid
She flings her knife aside
It sticks into a wall
She shrugs, smiles a beautiful smile, turns, and goes downstairs
Mariachi settles back down, closing his eyes
The knife slips out of the wall and clangs to the ground
Mariachi jumps again, rolls his eyes, and sinks underwater as the picture fades
- Mariachi plays in Amadeus
'  - Camera tracks past a pool table where   are playing nine ball
They make a few shots, then the phone rings
The camera continues to track past a small table where Azul's guitar case lies open
Weapons adorn it, with each knife, each gun in its pocket, in its own place
The camera continues tracking to a dresser on which sits Azul's cellular phone
delicate female hand lifts the receiver
The camera is now positioned above the bed as the  answers the phone
#1 (into phone) Yes
One moment please
He rolls over and wakes a  sleeping beside her
Girl #2 takes the phone and passes it to a third  as Girl #2 tries to wake Azul (he is sleeping between Girls #2 and #3
)
Girl #3 has the phone to her ear as if listening for background conversation
The two Rats playing pool are staring longingly at the three Girls in Azul's bed
They look hungry and deprived
One hits the other, signaling it's his shot
While one shoots, the other watches
Azul awakens and grabs the phone
() 31
: (into phone) Yeah
'  - Moco is sitting in his pool
swimming  is bringing him drinks
(into phone) Amigo
'm glad 've reached you
You've not answered all day
Killing ten of my men must have been very time consuming
(into phone) Six
(into phone) What
(into phone) 've only killed six
You were always bad at math, Moco
guess that's why you never paid me half of the money
You thought it all belonged to you
(into phone) knew half was yours
got greedy, my friend
It's my nature
But you
You are modest
You've killed ten of my men
know, because 'm having them buried in my yard right now
With my dogs and cats
(counting on his fingers, into phone) killed six
But don't bother counting so soon
The number will triple by tomorrow
(into phone) 'm sorry things turned out this way
My friend
got greedy
should never have tried to kill you
It would have been cheaper for me to pay you
Now 've got to find ten new men
() 32
: (into phone) Six
(into phone) Ten
(into phone) tell you what
You give me my money, and  won't kill any more of your men
And  won't kill you
(takes a sip, into phone) No, it's too late for that
We're going to have to see this through
(into phone) Just like the Moco  used to know
Still wearing white
(looking down at his clothes, into phone) What do you think
(into phone) think you should change clothes
'd hate to ruin a white suit with your stupid blood
Azul hangs up
He gets dressed and leaves
The little Rats are about to follow, but one Rat walks over to get one look at the girls
The girls tease him, and when he tries to advance them, they pull guns and laugh as the Rat runs away
- Domino walks by with a trash can
Mariachi is sitting on a barstool
need to get my money back from that hotel
'll be right back
Are you crazy
If you go anywhere with that jacket and that case you could be killed
Leave that stuff here
() 33
: Mariachi gets up and is about to get his guitar case from under the stool
Mariachi leaves it under the stool and takes off the jacket
never go anywhere without it
Take care of it
Mariachi leaves
Domino drops the trash can and tells her assistant to watch the bar
She heads for the staircase
'  - Domino walks out onto her balcony, peering down into the street
shot of Mariachi walking through the street
Domino turns and walks to the phone
She dials a number by heart and sits in a plush chair
'  - Moco answers the phone
Towel around his neck, wet hair
'  - (dolly in slow, into phone) Hi
It's Domino
(into phone) know who it is
Dolly into Moco
- The Clerk is reading a paper
He hears a noise and pulls it aside
Mariachi is standing at the counter smiling
The Clerk jumps in his seat, then after a few frozen seconds he sets down his paper and reaches for Mariachi's old room key
Mariachi shakes his head "no", points to the register, and makes the money sign with his hand
The Clerk slowly moves over to the register
He depresses a few keys to open it
It won't open
He makes a gesture like it's stuck or something (he is not very convincing)
He tries again and again; each time pretending to get more impatient
Mariachi glances down at the Pit Bull
The Pit Bull is eyeing Mariachi
() 34
: Mariachi points to the Clerk as if he has an inside joke with the dog ("this guy
")
Mariachi climbs over the counter and stands next to the Clerk
The Clerk things Mariachi is a lunatic
Mariachi holds up a finger as if cueing the Clerk for a demonstration
Mariachi then leaps over the counter landing firmly back on the other side of the counter
of his feet landing hard, just as before
The register opens
Mariachi shrugs, smiles, and reaches into the register, taking his money out himself
He counts it
After a brief consideration, he decides to leave the old man a tip
Mariachi waves a "good-bye" wave and dances out
The old man, still standing there with his arms outstretched as if he was robbed, dashes to the phone and calls Moco's men
- The bar Assistant is cleaning the bar
He walks over to grab a few glasses and when he returns, Azul is sitting at the barstool Mariachi was on earlier
The Assistant looks around, wondering where Azul appeared from
Can  get something to drink or eat
One beer
The Assistant grabs a mug and starts to fill it at the tap
He fills it halfway when
(') In a bottle, wey
(laughs) Sorry
He grabs a bottle and hands it to Azul, then lifts the mug, toasts and drinks it straight down
Azul drinks his straight down, too
(looking around) Isn't there a girl that works here
Yeah, she owns the place
(heading a few bills to the Assistant) () () 35
: (') She owns it, now
Then she is Moco's girl
(looking around) So-so
She's onto this new musician
Azul takes out a few more bills and hands them to the Assistant, and begins to stand up
Thank you
- Mariachi is out on the streets, returning to Domino's
- As he crosses the street he notices Azul leaving the saloon with a guitar case
Mariachi runs into the saloon
- Mariachi runs inside and checks to see if his case is still there
Domino comes downstairs
just saw a guy with a guitar case like mine
It's him they want
(to Assistant) Did he say anything
(nodding) No, he just ordered a drink
don't look anything like him
- Azul is walking to his truck when he turns to a corner and Mean Dude #4 sticks his gun in his face
Two more guns appear, pointed at the back of his head
#10 Is this the guy
#5 'm not sure
36
- The two Rats are in the blue truck half a block away
One hits the other to look at what's happening to Azul
of Rats seeing Azul with three guys around him with guns
They look at each other, start the truck and speed away
- #5 What's in the case
My guitar
#5 Yeah
You're one of those old-time mariachis, huh
(pause) Yes
#5 , let's take a look
Mean Dude #4 takes the case and lays it flat in Azul's palms
#5 (') If it's a guitar like you say it is, we'll never bother you again
Mean Dude #4 unsnaps two of the latches,
#5 (') If it's not
He unsnaps three more
#5 (') then we'll spray paint this street with your brains
He points the gun deep into Azul's face and cocks it
Azul closes his eyes
Mean Dude #5 lifts the lid
Azul hears a faint strumming sound, followed by the sound of the Mean Dude slamming the case shut
Azul opens his eyes
The Mean Dude resnaps the latches
--
#5 (') (walking away) Sorry
() 37
: They walk away leaving Azul wondering what happened
- Domino, Mariachi, and Assistant are standing at the bar
Look, as long as you don't carry the case around, they'll leave you alone
It's that guy they're after
(putting on his coat) better put this upstairs
He grabs the case and begins to take it to the stairs, but he pauses for it feels different to him
He slowly looks down at it
- Azul watches the Mean Dudes go and when tey turn the corner he puts the case on the ground to open it
- The Mean Dudes are rounding the corner, but Mean Dude #5, who is last, snaps his fingers and motions to the others to keep quiet and to watch Azul - Mariachi shakes the case, and puts it on the counter as if to open it
but he doesn't need to check it
He knows it's not his guitar
What's wrong
Mariachi looks at her startled, then runs out of the bar with the case
- Mean Dudes are watching Azul unsnap his case
- Azul opens the lid, revealing Mariachi's guitar
38
- #5 That's him
The Mean Dudes start walking towards Azul as the camera tracks back with them
Azul slams the case shut, wondering what the hell is going on
He looks up and notices the Mean Dudes walking towards him
He stands up and slowly walks in the other direction
- Mariachi is running through the streets and onto the sidewalk
- The bad guys are pulling out their weapons
Mariachi bolts around the corner
Now everyone is on the same sidewalk
Mariachi and Azul are on each end of the street with the Mean Dudes in between them
Azul turns and sees Mariachi with his guitar case
Mean Dude #5 turns and sees Mariachi, too
#5 That's him
The two other Mean Dudes exchange glances
Mean Dude #5 stalks after Mariachi, so the other two follow
Mariachi looks to Azul for help
Azul tips the imaginary hat to Mariachi and walks away
- Mariachi runs through the street almost getting hit
Bullets are flying as the Mean Dudes are firing at him as they run
- Mariachi leaps up over a few cars and ends up in a dead end
He turns around, drops the case on the ground and opens it million weapons seem to stare back at him when he opens it
He is frantic
He grabs a small gun, shakes it in his hand, doesn't like the feel
He tosses it back in
- The Mean Dudes are barreling down the street
One turns towards the dead end
39
- Mariachi pulls out the -10 and blasts the first Mean Dude he sees
He grabs the case and runs out into the street, jumping onto a truck and blasting the other Mean Dude from up there
He sees Mean Dude #5 run away
Mariachi comes off the truck and walks through the streets in slow motion
Peolple are staring at him as if he was Azul the killer
Mariachi walks straight to the bar
is bouncing a ball on one of the sidewalks
'  - The camera dollies past the vacant pool table, and over to a Rat sitting in a chair, drinking a beer
The other Rat is pacing back and forth in front of the sitting Rat
Azul enters the room
Throwing his guitar case onto the pool table as a grand entrance gesture
The sitting Rat stands beside the pacing Rat
#1 'm sorry we left
#2 We didn't know what to do
#1 We figured you could defend yourself
Rat #2 nods in agreement
Azul unsnaps one of the latches
You thought  could defend myself
against three armed men
using this
He opens the case and the guitar sparkles at them
The Rats exchange glances
They look at the guitar then back at Azul
(') My case got switched with some maricon mariachi
() 40
: #1 Where is this mariachi
He's dead by now
So,  want you to go look for my case
The two Rats are about to leave
(') Leave me a weapon
Both Rats take out their guns
Azul takes Rat #2's gun
(') That was disloyal of you to leave me out there
You should be as loyal to me as you are to each other
The Rats exchange glances, then aim their eyes back to the floor
Azul turns to Rat #2
(') Are you loyal
#2 (after glancing at Rat #1) Yes
(to Rat #1) Are you loyal
#2 Yes
Azul gestures to Rat #2
Then shoot him
Rat #1 turns to Rat #2 who is in shock
(') You are loyal, are you not
Or shoot you
Azul aims his gun at Rat #1, who immediately aims his gun at Rat #2
Rat #2 is sweating bullets
Rat #1 puts his gun down
#1 can't
() 41
: (2) Why not
#1 You said we should be as loyal to you as we are to each other
couldn't shoot him, for that would be as disloyal as shooting you
Rat #2 glances back and forth between Rat #1 and Azul
Very good
Now go find my case
Azul puts his gun down and motions the rats to leave
They leave
When they exit, Rat #1 turns to Rat #2 and snaps his fingers
Rat #2 shakes his hand
They leave
'  - Domino is dabbing hydrogen peroxide onto a cotton swab
She applies it to Mariachi's body scars on his back
Mariachi has his eyes closed
He washes the blood from his face
Where were you when he came into the bar
was on the phone, talking to a friend that knows what's going on
Did you mention me
No
He told me the man in black is Azul
If his name is Azul, why doesn't he wear blue
don't know
Anyway, he's killing the men of the town drug dealer
The dealer's name is Mauricio
But he's known as Moco
And Moco is sending these men to find Azul
So, why do they chase me
() 42
: They have never seen Azul
only Moco knows him
My friend says the description Moco gave his men was that he wears black, and carries a guitar case
Sounds like you, no
Couldn't you tell your friend that there are two people like that in his town
One is a killer, and one is a mariachi
Only special people can talk to Moco
Besides, you've killed a few of his men, now
Your best option is to keep out of sight, stop wearing black, and to hide that stupid case until this is all over
'  - Mean Dude #5 comes in and approaches Moco
#5 He got away
but  got a good look at him
Moco takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth
#5 (') Coca, Caca, Beto were killed
Moco takes out a match
#5 (') He won't get away again, Moco
promise
Moco lights his match across Mean Dude #5's face and lights his cigarette
Mean Dude #5 walks away, as Moco flicks his match at him in slow motion
'  - Mariachi is about to lay on the floor
She tosses him a blanket
Are you always closed Monday nights, or did you close since  can't play my guitar tonight
() 43
: Mondays are my day off
Want to play a game
Sure
The phone rings
Domino gets up to answer it
Mariachi reaches under his blanket for a small mirror and combs his hair, putting spit in his hair to slick it down
He quickly stashes the mirror
(into phone) Hello
(into phone) Come see me
(into phone) can't
(into phone) Please
Moco is sitting at a table playing cards
(into phone) don't feel well
've got to go

: (2) can't figure out something
You tell me you're poor
Poor family
Yet you've got this place
(sighing) This place is a gift
From who
From Mauricio
From Mauricio
The man trying to kill me
He's not trying to kill you, his man had you confused with Azul
Same thing
Look, you now how if you want to impress a girl, you send her flowers, candy, jewelry until you win her love
Yes
If one present doesn't work, you keep sending bigger and better things until you win her or you're broke
Correct
Well, Mauricio sent me flowers, then jewelry, then he gave me a job at his saloon, then he gave me the whole saloon
etc
He's still giving you things
He'll never run out of money
() 45
: (3) And you accept it all
What's the last thing he sent you
Domino walks over to the counter and picks up a key
motorcycle
Mariachi laughs
(') He wants me to ride out to his ranch when 've decided to be his
He thinks he's close to having me
Is he
(pause) He was
She sits next to Mariachi
(') Not anymore
They kiss
She gets up and is about to turn off the lights
So, you really are from a poor family
(in the dark) remember when  was growing up, we were so poor, that my brothers and sisters and all slept on the same blanket stretched out across the floor
We had to sleep in a circle, with our fingers in each other's ears, to keep the bugs from crawling into them
(after a pause) Ay, wey
Domino laughs
46
- Domino hands Mariachi a wad of money
Mariachi sees the money and looks up at her bewildered
Here's a little bit 've saved
want you to go get a new guitar
Mariachi starts to put up his hand as if to refuse it
(') Take it, stupid
'm not saying go by the best one, just a temporary one so you can play again tonight
Mariachi stops and thinks
He looks up at her questioningly, then he shrugs an "" and grabs the money and jogs out excitedly
Domino is smiling
- Mariachi walks down the sidewalk, passing curioso shops
The camera is low and zoomed in all the way
Mariachi stops by one of the window that has a guitar in the glass
He pulls his money and counts it
He stops after he notices someone's reflection in the window
He turns around and sees it is Mean Dude #5 right across the street
He meets up with another Mean Dude
They are standing right behind Mariachi
Mariachi is pretending to still look at the window
The Mean Dudes walk past Mariachi so Mariachi walks in the opposite direction
Mean Dude #5 stops and then turns around slowly

As he turns on the corner, Mariachi sees the truck and casually climbs inside and hides in the back
Mean Dude #5 turns the corner when whispers into walkie-talkie
#5 (into walkie-talkie) Where did he go, Loco
(laughs, into walkie-talkie) He got in my truck
Mean Dude #5 laughs
#5 (into walkie-talkie) Take him around the block
Mean Dude #5 taps his buddy and they start running down the block
Mariachi is in back the truck searching for a weapon
The truck stops
Mariachi rolls to the side and gently lifts his head
Mariachi sees the two Mean Dudes walking at him
Mariachi turns and Loco is there to knock him in the face with the rifle butt
Mariachi falls into truck, blood trickling from his dizzying head
He tries to get up a bit, but Loco is in the truck now, and slams the rifle down into his face hard
Blackout
' Mariachi is unconcious in the back of Loco's truck
Mean Dude #5 and other Mean Dudes are riding in back with Mariachi
' - The above scene intercuts back and forth with the arrival of Loco
Loco arrives at the gate, Mean Dude #5 opens the gate, they drive through
The truck is facing Moco so he can't see Mariachi yet
Mean Dude #5 closes the gate and walks over to the truck, opens the back door, and calls Moco over
Moco walks over to the truck and looks inside

- Mariachi is laying there unconcious, Moco puts his arm around Mean Dude #5, who is looking very proud, and Moco pulls out a cigarette and a match
That's not him
Moco strikes the match behind Mean Dude #5's head
Mean Dude #5 stops smiling

Azul wakes up and looks over the partition
Where's my case
#1 We couldn't find it
#2 We heard they caught you and were taking you to Moco's ranch
#1 so we came to see if it was true
Azul thinks a moment
He stands up
They caught the mariachi
Azul dresses, smiling
'  - Mariachi is in a holding cell at the ranch
He twitches, finally waking up
He sees a  outside and finds a way to escape

: He grabs the guard's assault rifle and turns a corner
Two men grab him
He slams the butt of the rifle, knocking the wind and teeth out of   #1, then he kicks down and breaks the shin bone of   #2 who screams out in agony
Mariachi silences him by karate punching his throat
The Bad Guy gurgles and hits the ground
Angle from the ground as Mariachi smashes the guy with is gun
He crawls up a wall, trying to escape as quietly as he can
He sees    running towards him since they heard some noise
Mariachi aims his assault rifle at the blue Chevy parked behind him
He fires and it explodes
Mariachi jumps Loco, gets him to drive him to the saloon
He also takes Loco's money
- Azul walks into frame, looks around then proceeds into the bar
- Azul goes inside and finds Domino tending the bar
What can  get you
One beer
She grabs a bottle and slams it down on the counter unopened
He eyes her admirably and then pops the top with one hand
He guzzles the drink, slamming it down empty
Anything else
(nodding) My guitar case
Where's Mariachi
Where's my case
Upstairs
() 50
: Get it
Domino grabs another beer for him and runs to get the case
(In between this time, Mariachi escapes with Loco
) She returns, slamming it to the floor
(') If you want your mariachi back, come with me
Why will you help me
Because you know where Moco's ranch is
don't
Domino calls her Assistant
(') You help me, 'll help you
Let's go
They leave
The Assistant tends to the bar
' They drive out to Moco's ranch in Azul's truck
Little do they know, they passed Loco's truck with Mariachi crouched in the passenger seat
He gets up after the truck passes
Mariachi didn't know it was Domino in Azul's truck or he could have turned around and kept her from going to Moco's ranch
They arrive at the gate and het out of the truck
(over the gate) Mauricio
Azul grabs Domino and points a gun to her head
He whispers to her
Play along
He kicks at the gate
() 51
: (') Open the gate or she's dead
The gate opens and we see Moco standing at a three-quarter stance, flanked with his men on both sides
Azul drags Domino in and faces her at Moco with a gun to her head
(to Domino) 'm sorry he used you to get to me, Domino
Azul cocks the pistol
(') Azul, let her go and you'll get your money
Moco, give me my money or  ruin your clothes with her blood
Moco signals his men to get the money
What have you done with Mariachi
Who
The musician your men confused with Azul
(staring at her) So that's why you were busy that night
Azul is glancing between Domino and Moco
(') you had that little monkey climbing all over you
Give me my money or  kill her
After all 've done for you, this is how you treat me
never asked you for anything until now
Let Mariachi go

: (2) Azul is anxious now
swear 'll kill her
No you won't
will
Moco pulls out his gun and shoots her in the heart
She falls limp in Azul's arms
Azul tries hold her up, but she's dead
Azul rests her on the ground, looking down at her, wondering why it's all come to this
All  wanted was my rightful share
But you've got to kill everybody
You feel sorry for her, don't you
See, that's why you can't ever be as big as me
Azul slowly looks at Moco
(') (aiming gun) Because you have too much heart
Moco shoots Azul in the heart
Azul had his hands to his side, and now he falls to his knees
Moco shoots him again, and Azul dies next to Domino
Mean Dude #5 is exchanging glances with the others
No one seems to be on Moco's side
- Mariachi is still in Loco's truck
Stop here
Loco stops the truck and Mariachi gets out
Loco drives back when Mariachi motions for him to leave
Mariachi watches him go then dashes around the corner to the saloon
- Mariachi runs into the bar
Domino
We're leaving
Right now

: The Assistant rushes over to Mariachi
She's gone
Where is she
Looking for you
Mariachi is about to race upstairs
(') She gave the case back to that guy
She left with him to find you
Mariachi tries to make sense of it all for a minute before grabbing the gun from under the counter and rushing upstairs
'  -  Mariachi grabs the key to the motorcycle and runs out
The motorcycle burns down the road
' Mariachi barrels down the road on the motorcycle
'  - Moco is walking away from the bodies
Bring that musician out here so he can be reunited with my Domino
Some men go to check
Cut back and forth with Mariachi coming
He's gone, sir
Find him
Mariachi rides through the semi-open gate
stopping at the bodies
He dismounts the bike and holds Domino
He has the gun in the back of his pants
You can see it while his back is to the camera and men are approaching him
Moco comes for the show

: (') (good shot) So you're the little mariachi that came to town, killed my men, and stole my girl
Mariachi slowly lifts his eyes to Moco
(') You are very talented
Mariachi stands, hands up
(') bet you play the guitarra real well, huh
Mariachi says nothing
(') (raising gun) Not anymore
Moco fires into Mariachi's left hand
Mariachi grimaces, crumbling to the floor
He keeps a tight grip on his hand
When he opens his hand to see the damage, the camera can see right through his hand for a reverse shot of his face through the hole
(') Now get the hell off my property and take your hand with you
Moco is laughing and looking at his men for support, but no one else laughs
Mariachi tries to stand, but he falls back
When he rises again he has the gun in his hand
He shoots Moco in the chest
Moco falls back and hits the ground hard
He gasps for air
Moco's men gather around him
Mean Dude #5 crouches down to check Moco's throat pulse
Moco's dead
Mean Dude #5 strikes a match across Moco's face and lights up a cigarette
He turns and walks away
The others follow
Mariachi wraps a tourniquet on his arm, kisses Domino, opens Azul's case, sees the weapons, and rides off with it
He looks back at the town behind him, then places his hand on the motorcycle to drive off
We notice the metal brace on his hand

: Mariachi rides into the sunset road
