Screenplay by Peter Briggs We  on  , a sea of stars spread across the infinite depths of space
As the  , we notice that three of these specks seem to be moving; one of them picking up acceleration and racing toward us
Our perspective changes, and we catch a quick glimpse as it  past, and into the gravitational pull of a large brownish planet
Kicking up  of  as it hits atmosphere
It seems to be manmade
Or at least artificial
- The planet is dead, barren
Death Valley on a grand scale
We watch the object plummet through the wispy cloud-cover, emitting a few last burning embers before falling to ground way-off in the distance resonates across the dusty plains, before settling back into an eerie silence
- We're looking into a deep gorge, dark and sinister
howling wind whips dust into a sandstorm, reducing visibility to almost zero
About seventy feet down there's a hole in the rock-face that just might be a cave entrance, and near is a peculiar  in the air
We hear a mechanical  and the  disappears, replaced by humanoid  clinging to the sheer rock - each well over seven feet tall
They are , a race of intergalactic big-game hunters on permanent safari; their clothing and weaponry a bizarre mix of aborigine and ultra-hi-tech
In their hands are circular metal discs; 'smart weapons' which cut into the stone and give them purchase
-
From their
, we see the fissure reduced to
The entrance registers as a black gaping void
The five hunters climb inside the rim of the tunnel, out of the wind's banshee wailing
The lead  reaches up to his headgear, pulling at the coupling pipes connecting it to a hidden breathing-apparatus
He removes the helmet, clips it to his rear utility pack, and takes a deep breath of the air
curious speckled pattern runs across his wide forehead, marking him different to the others; in addition, one of the fangs of his mandibles has been sheared away
We'll call him  , he's the leader of the hunting party
He reaches out a hand to caress the wall of the tunnel
Several feet in from the rim, it changes from rock to a textured biomechanical surface; a swirling mass of disturbing shapes
He hurries forward in response to the - of one of his team who has found something
The other  holds a telescopic spear up for scrutiny
Skewered on the end is a shriveled  with eight spindly legs and a segmented tail; it's a , the first stage of the deadly  lifeform
a caution to his party; they respond by pulling spears and elaborately-shaped swords
Several shoulder-mounted plasma cannons slide up to firing position, tracking with their owners' helmets
Thus armed, they move cautiously ahead
taking no chances
One helmeted  pauses, scanning the area
-
He switches through a variety of different views; infra-red, ultra- violet, enhanced motion-tracking
Nothing
He's so pre-occupied with this task, he totally fails to notice the skeletal  loom up behind him, emerging from the biomechanical growth on the floor
barbed tail skewers the  straight through the neck, splashing luminous blood across his chestplate gargled - issues from his throat, the band of spinning around in time to see him being dragged below the ground
The band of extraterrestrial hunters have no time to come to his aid; they themselves are set upon by a half-dozen
The carnage is swift and terrifying, a blur of motion
Steel blades and serrated biomechanical limbs scythe the air, alive with the  and  of both adversaries
One  is pinned against the tunnel wall, his spear out of range
The  claws away his face mask, and he finds himself dodging the 's toothed tongue, extended toward him with pile-driver speed
He reaches down, grasping the 'smart-weapon' hanging from his belt and brings it up in an arc that terminates at the 's grinning face
Big mistake
The two are in such close proximity that the 's acidic blood sprays across the 's head
While their technology seems to be resistant to it, their bodies aren't:  the viscous yellow liquid begins burning into the 's skin
He kicks the skeletal corpse away with a , clawing at his seared face
It all seems to be over as quickly as it began; there can be no question as to who were the victors
The  stand amidst a sea of biomechanical limbs strewn around like a charnel house
As his companions begin to carefully decapitate the  skulls, steps over the corpses to examine his fallen comrades
The first to be attacked was killed instantly; he crosses to the other
What he finds causes him to react with pity and disgust
His fallen comrade is only just alive; mandibles clicking frailly, half his head burnt away
watches the ailing  slide a steel blade from it's sheath and offer it to him
He takes it, knowing what has to be done
Rolling the knife quickly over the back of his hand - the sort of elaborate trick seasoned Green Berets perform - he plunges it downward into the fallen hunter
This unpleasant task accomplished, straightens up and activates his wrist-computer
dark shape blots out the light coming from the entrance; a small shuttlecraft, sleek and elegant
It hovers in the air with little more than a loud , and extends a ramp
The surviving  leap aboard, carrying their trophies with the reserved silence of men returning from combat
One more thing need to be done
bends down and flips a sequence of keys on the dead 's wrist
countdown is displayed in some unknown character-set, accompanied by a He then turns and swiftly boards the craft which takes smoothly to the air, it's undergear retracting
- white-hot fireball erupts out of the fissure, the result of the 's suicide-destruct mechanism
The shuttlecraft pulls quickly away, disappearing into the clouds
large spacecraft is suspended in orbit around the planet; the Mothership
The shuttle heads swiftly towards it
- An airlock  open and the  file  into the Mothership's docking bay
An   crouched against a strut takes time out from carving something into a block of wood to briefly look up at them
Like the  themselves, the ship is a curious mixture of old and new
An elaborate frieze written in alien script runs around the wall, with racks of sophisticated equipment recessed into it
Hatches lead off to various parts of the ship; we see carry his  head off down one of them
- The gallery seems to be more mechanical than the rest of the ship
enters, pausing next to a kind of readout device:  a cylindrical tube containing a substance similar to mercury which constantly changes it's mass into shapes and alien text
He peers over the protective railing
is magnificent:  a captive  , the nucleus of the society, fed by giant intravenous pipes
Each of it's limbs is tethered by straining clamps preventing any movement
To the rear, it's giant egg-sac glows and throbs, suspended by a jury-rigged sling
hangs above the  the  lays, seemingly defying gravity
As each  is scanned by a blue triangular beam - similar to a  gun-sight - it becomes translucent, giving us a view of the pulsing  inside
This done, a manipulator are carefully loads several eggs onto a pallet, which then sinks into a hatchway in the floor
It's an assembly-line of almost frightening mechanical efficiency
We see a pod ejected from the Mothership, rocketing away from the planet into deep space
The inference is obvious; the  are seeding worlds with  to hunt
- The blue beam slides across one of the eggs, and suddenly changes to red,  rapidly
sees the flowing display-tank alter from a rotating simulation of an   skull to a representation of a 's head
The manipulator arm swiftly grasps the  in question and moves it over to a protrusion on the floor
The causes the  to go berserk, straining at her bonds and  ferociously
She's obviously been through this before and knows what's about to happen
The protrusionsplits open, spilling out an intense white light:  an energy-filled blast furnace
The manipulator claw opens, the  drops in, and is no more
- An orange light plays across a wall of skulls, casting dark shadows into long-empty orbs
sprawls lizard-like across a flat slab of rock in the center of the room, inspecting his formidable arsenal of weaponry
Satisfied, he reaches out to run a finger across the jaw of his  trophy in an almost-erotic gesture
He regards it for a long moment as if coming to a decision of some kind, before finally getting to his feet
- The lights in the gallery are dimmer when   enters
He watches the cherry-red beam of the gliding   lock onto one of the , then runs his hand in sequence over the control board
The manipulator arm swings over, seizing the egg and loading it onto a waiting pallet
points his finger at the  and makes a guttural from deep in his throat
The effect is not unlike that of a child firing an imaginary gun
As if reading  's thoughts, the  lifts her crested head upwards and emits a venomous of contempt
In  , the planet sits still and green, awash with nebulous clouds
hulking    -- across our view, sunlight glinting from it's surface
It's a rectangular satellite- construction comprised of hundreds of communication dishes in a latticework of steel tubing
We hear
Subspace chatter
- Imagine a world where every square mile is covered by a canopy of treetop foliage, and you've just drawn yourself a picture of the planet Ryushi
Nestled amongst this lush rainforest is the Yutani-Templin Communications Relay Station
Several inverted-''-shaped suspension cranes painted bright yellow look down over a collection of preassembled buildings and roadways raised above the swamp on platforms, much like a truncated oil-rig
navigation beacon flashes intermittently from a tall gantry tower above, while dominating the view is the sloping face of a communications array several storeyes high
Off to one side of the platform is a gigantic many-wheeled haulage vehicle
flock of bird-like creatures fly past
- We're in the dark womb of a split-level command center alive with clusters of video readouts, somewhat reminiscent of a futuristic air- traffic control tower
On the upper tier, a large circular holo- display currently projects an image of the satellite we just saw
Thin trailers of paper flutter gently in the current coming from the air conditioning ducks, though beads of sweat still dot the foreheads of the people manning the consoled here
We move in on and  , two monitoring technicians occupying a control bank
listens carefully to something on her headset
Ah, negative on that request commercial freighter 'Nan-Shan'
've already got an inbound on that approach pending a beacon-fix
Hold on my mark until  get back with some confirmation

That's the second time  ran it, and it still reads the same

Toss you for it
- is sweating heavily, a black forelock of hair falling across her Oriental features
Her eyes flicker warily from side-to- side as she holds the smooth length of the sword before her, trying to assess from where the next attack will come
She doesn't have to wait long; two   drop to the floor in front of her, striking without hesitation
She expertly avoid the blows, parrying relentlessly
persistent begins to intrude
, like a telephone
She tries to ignore it, but her concentration is clearly broken

The blade plunges deep into her stomach, emerging from her back
She glances down in annoyed disbelief
Fuck
Holo off
The  immediately flicker and disappear
She sheathes the sword with one precise movement and crosses the wooden paneled floor to her desk
Mopping her face with a towel, she thumbs a stud
The stops, the corporate logo on her flat-screen desk panel replaced with a black girl's face

(

What kind of 'something'
(
, onscreen) Easier if you come down and look
'm on my way
- An eight-wheeled articulated crawler rolls noisily through the rain, climbing an access ramp leading from the swamp to the outpost's empty main-street
group of rhinos - brown two-horned quadrupeds indigenous to Ryushi - restlessly stir in their corral at it's approach
The crawler's pneumatics  gently as it comes to a halt, while somewhere off in the distance a dog
, a lean man in his forties
climbs down from the cab mounted five feet above the ground and squints up at the main relay antenna
He adjusts the cowboy hat on his head against the drizzle and crosses the street towards one of the buildings, ignoring a Pepsi sign  in the gentle breeze

Her name is
She's the base mascot

He climbs the few stairs to the monitoring tier, pulling the French-plaited hair of  , an Italian systems- mechanic with her hands buried in a disassembled console
You didn't wipe your feet coming in
Well, it's okay
You didn't tell me it was monsoon season going out
looks up at  and grins
Hey, buenos dias, cowboy
When d'you blow in
places his hat on ' head and  it down
Just got back
Missed anything
(snorts) Yeah
We're almost out of beer
Ahh, don't pay any attention to Urioste
She's still pissed that Noguchi wouldn't let her go off on your hunting trip
pours himself a cup of coffee from a  percolator
Wasn't my trip,  just did the driving
'Sides, freezing my butt off out in the wet taking pot-shots at the local wildlife isn't my idea of a good time, either
He sips gingerly from the cup of scalding liquid
Where'd you leave them
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range
They're making their own way back tomorrow
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones
Shit
When
Yesterday
We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'
Biggest market crash since twenty-four
looks ill
Fucking great
invested some money in them
You win some, you loose some
lose 'em all, that's why 'm still out here on this rock
Anything else you wanna ruin my day with
No, but  got something that might interest you
enters, pulling on a leather jacket
What've you got
nods to her and receives a quick smile for his trouble
They turn to watch the display clear, replaced with a computer simulation of the neighboring solar system
pair of incomings
They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure
Yeah
Turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace
The simulation  , revealing two unidentified objects heading towards the planet in the center of the display
Computer notations accompany them
(') Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive
Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles
That's what we thought
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through
Done it already
Nothing matches
And if you thought that was interesting, watch this
watches the course of the two objects simultaneously change
Jesus
Yeah, exactly
Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at
Tactical nukes, maybe
Everybody gives him a quick look, but nobody says anything
It's obviously not an appealing thought
Where're they headed
We ran a trajectory simulation
If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion
There's a great exhalation of breath, and everyone swaps significant glances
seems worried
She scratches her forehead
don't know what to make of this
Get a copy of the telemetry relayed back to Antarctica Traffic Control
Better alert the nearest RimCorp Base, too
nods, suddenly serious
Fort Powell
What do we tell 'em
Just give them the facts
They can leap to their own conclusions
'  -  - Down here in the swamp, the trunks of magnificent trees terminate in gnarled roots and disappear into watery murk, much like a Louisiana bayou
group of attentive -  suddenly bound for cover as a line of bullets  into the wood nearby
Seconds later, a loud   intrudes
and a pair of manta-ray-shaped hover-bikes with sleek lines and garnish decals  into suspended two feet above the mire, their powerful turbines kicking-up a swirl of spray
The two  skid to a halt and watch the scatter
and  - men who on Earth might be called "good 'ol boys" - are both riding one-handed; powerful hi-tech rifles gripped in the other
(yelling) You missed 'em, Ackland
Little fuckers move too fast
Let's do a sweep and catch 'em on the other side
nods his head, pulling his goggles down over his eyes
The two bikes  off in pursuit
'  -  - Up on a mud-bank, at the base of a sturdy gantry tower with two blinking blue lights atop it, stands the camp
It looks a little like a Bedouin bivouac, but up-close we can see the techno-fitted details
hard-featured woman seated next to a solid-fuel burner sips from a mug, while her Vietnamese counterpart is manually loading large-caliber bullets into a belt-feed
They watch as  and  roar past
scrambles out of the way as a beer can lobbed by   to the ground near him
Crazy idiots
cups her drink with both hands, assessing him
Ahhh, they're just letting off some steam; don't let 'em get to you
Ackland and York aren't such bad guys when you get to know 'em
Just a couple of weekend warriors
She peers curiously at the clunky cartridges 's thumbing into the belt feed
On the ground next to him is a widebore weapon on an over- the-shoulder guidance mechanism
(') Nice howitzer you've got there
Thanks
Good argument for gun-control
What are you going after, rhino
Nah
just wanna squeeze off a few rounds
'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected
They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it
He peers into the belt and blows out some dirt
(') Sure wish there was something on this planet with a bit of fight in it, though
Against a sea of stars, a small metal shape  towards us, followed moments later by it's identical twin
-   - strand of 's hair falls forward into her face, slick with rain
She brushes up at the miserable weather
She and  are standing on one of the twelve-feet-in-diameter wheels of the gargantuan haulage vehicle we saw outside the base earlier
Up on the side of the cab is painted a Nordic Valkyrie with an impressive bustline, next to which is the legend ' '
Two mechanics,   and , watch  point something out to  from the vantage point of 's crawler parked in the swamp nearby
See that sheathing on the suspension
Eaten away
Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers
The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module
That was four months ago
can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is

If you want these things kept in working condition, that's the only choice you've got
leans in to murmur quietly to
Maybe she wouldn't be so tetchy if she got laid every once-in-a-while

Nah
Freeze my dick off
shakes her head dubiously at 's comment

leans out of the crawler's cab and calls across
Miss Noguchi
You're wanted in admin
Thanks
She turns back to
(') Let me sort this out and we'll go over the logistics in my office
- peers at the display with undisguised concern
sense of urgency buzzes around the room
(') When
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour
Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort
Can we move it to a different orbit in time
looks up from his board in harassment
Already working on it
Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater
She meets 's eyes
(') Looks like you were right
Someone's lobbed a pair of smart-missiles at us
shakes his head
Relay station like us out in the middle of the boonies; why bother
All you're gonna do is punch a temporary hole in the traffic control net
That'd be small potatoes even for terrorists
and  are all-business at the control board
Can you patch me a temporary loop on
Okay, give me the numbers
She flips a switch
nearby screen changes to display an orbital path sketched out in rectangular neon blocks
cluster of thruster rockets on one corner of the relay frame ignites, and the darkened bulk of the satellite begins to move
The two pods  towards us at immense speed
- The two blips on the holo-board representing the pods make a marked alteration in their course
They've changed their heading again
Compensate
Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee
What do you need
three-second burn to port, on my mark
It's on the board
Framed against the green backdrop of Ryushi, the  pods rocket towards the communications platform
Picking up velocity
Match it
bead of sweat trickles down ' temple
Not gonna make it
The pod speeds  into , blotting out our view
- One of the two blips on the holo-display vanishes, and three-quarters of the monitors abruptly turn to static
curses
Goddammit
He pulls off his headset with weary resignation
(') We've lost the downlink
It's gone
The mass of the satellite tumbles end-over-end
gaping rent is torn through it; something sparks and flashes within
The second pod accelerates off curving into the atmosphere
'  -  - overhead;  looks up in time to see an object sear across the dusk sky
He pulls his bike to a stationary hover
Shit
What's that
has already dismounted as he watches the fireball hurtle to the ground
resonates across the forest, followed by a few plaintive  from the planet's indigenous lifeforms, before settling back into an eerie silence
Meteor,  guess
He raises a set of compact field binoculars to his face he sees a thin haze of smoke rising from the treetops
'you feel any impact shock
(uncertain) Not really
He lowers the binoculars and frowns
Me either
tell you,  used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits
believe me, you know about it
Do you wanna head back and call it in
(hesitant) dunno
dunno
Something about this feels funny
He looks across at the plume of smoke snaking off into the sky
(') That is the damndest impact 've ever saw
'  -   - The earth around the crater-rim is charred and cracked; some of the surrounding brush still aflame
scuttles inquisitively to the edge of the pit and stops, it's stinger twitching hesitantly

The  crawls off, vanishing into the long reeds
- sits on the front wheel of 's crawler, her knees pulled up to her chin, staring off into a thin mist that makes the night impenetrable
Behind and above, the lights of the cranes and the communications array strobe on-and-off
Above the bar on the main street is a flicking neon sign erected after-the-fact, emblazoned with the words "'"
The   of - from within become momentarily louder, and  glances over to see it's pressure-door  back, disgorging several drunken people follows them through
He spots  and heads over
Hey, boss
Wondered where you'd gotten to
just
wanted to be put on my own for a while
Clear my head
Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh
She shakes her head, and manages a smile
've got a lot of thinking to do
'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me
Not too much of the socializing type, then
No, not really
More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type
is straight-faced
(') 'm serious
That's why  switched from orbiting to planetary installations
Is that a fact
Uh-huh
Used to get it pretty bad
'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch
How long you been out here for now, anyway
Three months
Four
And before that
Six month stint on Datus
Only six
What is this
'Twenty Questions'
Just curious
There's a lot of talk goes around
shrugs
Thinks about it
don't know
guess 've just never found anywhere  really felt at home
She hugs her knees again, and suddenly looks a whole lot more at ease
spots a square glass balanced on one of the tire's wide treads
What is that
Real man' drink
She offers the glass to him
He takes it and sniff cautiously
Seltzer
Want some
hands the glass back and raises his own bottle
'll stick with my own
He sits with her and stares into the darkness
Any luck raising Ackland's party
Nothing
With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range
He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back
'We'
You wanna fly out there with me
Sure
Do me good to stretch my legs
takes a sip of her drink, her brow furrowing
(') This whole thing's got me spooked
hops off the wheel
Don't worry about it
If the Network goes by the book, like everyone figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days
They can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us
All we've gotta do is sit tight
Do you think Ackland'll sit tight
There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to
peculiar blue scanning beam plays over the rotating mass of the incapacitated satellite, examining every section
it comes to the rent torn through it, and pauses

The damage registers as a cold, black mass

Forget it
We lost the satellite link
It's dead
There's a long pause while everyone considers the options
We've got no option
We're gonna have to get it off
Oh man
Get real, Beauvais
That thing might chew his fucking face off for all be know
The motion sensor outside begins  again

He studies the surrounding darkness
There's nothing out there
He shakes his head in disgust

He thumbs a stud on the top of the 'howitzer'
There's a gentle , and the  of hydraulic cylinders as the harness mechanism lifts the weapon up
It darts quickly to-and-fro; a mechanical snake seeking a target
We see 's hand in
In addition to the firing trigger, there's also a thumb button
He squeezes it
The gun swings sharply around in a blinding movement, tracking something automatically
There's a   as it fires-off three shots in rapid succession
Something that was only yards from and is blown backwards to  against a tree bole, a mass of luminous green liquid and motion

Three humans; in motion and 'hot'
The triangular mechanism of the 's gun locks onto

He topples dead to the ground, a look of pained surprise on his face

She doesn't have time to take the harness off - she just slides her finger through the trigger guard and starts squeezing off random shots
The air shimmers as an unseen shape races at her
There's a loud of sliding metal, and a telescopic spear appears out of thin air
It  through ' body, lifting her off the ground and impaling her against a tree

There's a  , and the hazy air around disappears

He flips it
The engine  and then dies

The wounded bounds across the clearing at frightened speed

The creature an ornately-shaped lance from it's back and thrusts it -
The blade slices into the bike's body and jams there, while one of it's manta- wings  into the 's jaw, sending it reeling backwards into the swamp

He sees a handing from a tree, and the  of two more  in their camouflage nearby
He's not sticking around to argue though jams the throttle hard and the bike shoots off into the bayou as more cannon-blasts blossom around him
The group of  appear in the camp and cautiously survey the area
The   - the one with the distinctive armor - crosses to the tent and opens the entry flap

The extraterrestrial hunter scrutinizes the pulsing  on for a long moment, but takes no further action
'  -  - We    the deserted campsite
There isn't a soul there, human or otherwise
The wind whistles eerily through the tree-boughs
- First light the next day, the sun rising on the horizon
'chopper' - actually a twin-turbine heli-jet - flies in low above the veil of mist hanging over the treetops

The controls moving by themselves, on autopilot

From out of the window of the 'chopper', we see the twin blue lights of the navigation beacon blinking on-and-off above the trees

Wake up
We're at the beacon
He switches the controls over to manual and takes the chopper down

The encampment has been wrecked, much of is reduced to a twisted tangle of smoking debris
All-terrain gear lowers from the chopper, as it makes a watery landing in the swamp

She crouches down and rubs her fingers through it
Blood

Hold on
She begins to cross the camp, and her foot catches on a taut length of rope
swings down from the trees, hitting her squarely in the face and knocking her off her feet
in fear and surprise, then freezes at what she sees
Two bloodied bodies dangle head-first from the bough overhead; and
Each has been skinned and is beyond recognition hears her exclamation and is out of the tent in an instant
He stops in his tracks
Jesus palomino

Under cover of an overhang, watches as  is trundled away from the 'chopper' on a paramedic trolley by  and  , an Indian woman in her late thirties
As  slams the 'chopper's side door, we see that has left her leather jacket on the passenger seat

This  thrusts his trophy onto the next spike, then stares at the vacant one for a long moment
His wrist computer  for attention

Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder
Agreed
When we get the link back, and  send this in,

They're the least of your problems right now
What do you mean

She interrupts
Sorry
Can  have a word
Sure
What's up
Three-Pump failed a half-hour ago
The algae must have clogged up an intake duct
Think  spoke too soon
Again
How long before we start noticing the difference

Beauvais usually fixes it, but
ah
knows what she means

Can you handle it
Sure,  can manage
But 'm not going into the Pit on my own

What am  doing back here
Where's York

We

Not really, no
Ugly little sonuvabitch
What is it
We thought you might be able to tell us
found it by your cot at the camp
You were out cold
What did York say
York's vanished
Vanished
Beauvais and Minh are dead, Ackland
York's gone awol, unless you can help us go some way toward disproving our suspicion, he's the prime suspect right now
The news hits  hard
He falters and leans back, addressing Can
um
have some water
Please
Sure
She goes to fetch a cup
- It's lunchtime, and the  of machinery  food mixes with the of the twenty-or-so personnel eating there
and are deep in conversation across a table
Do you believe him
Ackland
don't know him well enough to say
If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure
There's not much we can do out here
stares hard at her
That's not much of an answer, and knows it
She capitulates
(') Alright then, For what it's worth
yes,  do
digs appreciatively into a container of food with his fork
You should try this seasoned stuff
It's good
approaches the table carrying something
Got a present for you
He hands 's leather jacket over to her
Oh, 've been looking for this
Where was it
You left it in the chopper
Oh, and before  forget, Don

And
And, nothing
They checked out just fine

He looks in a bad way
Help me get him up to Infirmary
Wait a minute
Something else has caught 's eye
"something" almost two metres in length protruding from the rear of the wrecked hoverbike
Grasping the haft firmly, she works it free
examines the spear, and slowly shakes her head
(') Holy Mary
-
The concealed hunter watches as the colorised human curiously turns the weapon over in her hands
- sits at a desk and peers into a microscope
Every so often she in satisfaction and types something into her computer terminal
The stasis tube containing the dead  stands to one side of the computer screen
The Infirmary is very quiet, and only the gentle of the air-conditioning intrudes
tosses uncomfortably on his cot
He finally sits up and massages his chest
Oh
Oh God
lowers her pen and looks across
What is it
It's nothing, Doc
Just a
touch of indigestion
something
Do you want a tablet

His breathing's getting heavy
He nods
Uh-huh

That sounds nasty
'll give you a couple of Demazine
nods again
His  has deepened, and now he's banging his chest with a balled fist
hurries over with three red tablets and a disposable cup of water
takes them gratefully and gulps them down
The effect is almost immediate;  quietens and an appreciative smile comes to his pale lips
(') Better
Yeah
Before he has a chance to elaborate,   once more
thin spray of blood and saliva dots 's white smock and speckles her cheek

She pulls away, dragging him from the bed in the process
He falls to the floor, his  growing in volume
Hold on, it's alright

Her fingers tremble as she clumsily examines a tray of surgical instruments
She finds a pneumatic spray-injector, fully charged with a vial of amber liquid attached

fumbles with the injector control and gives him a blast in his upper arm convulses once then goes still, his eyes staring fixedly at the ceiling
The Infirmary is deathly quiet once again
We hear a gentle , like twigs being snapped
watches in horrified fascination as a pool of blood spreads swiftly outward across the floor from below 's corpse
shudders as the body moves a little, then is rolled over by something underneath it
's body slumps forward onto it's front, revealing a gaping cavity in his back
Bits of spine and ribcage are just visible

Around it's head is a distinctive nascent crest
It kicks away from with a powerful push from it's legs, quickly gaining balance
After a moment appraising it's new environment, it stalks off behind a table
thinks quickly
She leaps forward and  a large red stud next to the pressure-door, which promptly  closed
The room is bathed in pools of shadows
Plenty of hiding space for the creature
hears breaking glass, making her start
She cautiously edges over to the Autodoc and looks up into the forest of probe-arms
There's a wicked looking blade there, the kind used in major surgery

Now she's armed
Stooped over, she begins to stalk the

Above them, a hinged flap on the wall lies open revealing a circular mechanism beneath

York just turned up outside
We're trying to get him into Infirmary
(astonished) York
leans over to examine him, but a particularly loud  from within the Infirmary distracts her

The door's sealed from inside
Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts
Force the door
Can't
It's pressure sealed

Here
Thanks
He inserts the end into the open flap and pulls hard, the physical effort showing on his face
The door grinds open about eight inches
The bloodied  forces itself through the narrow gap, vehemently

This galvanises
He races off in pursuit

slips her arm through the gap and fumbles around blindly
She must have hit the control knob, because the door slides back

Oh my God
She turns away and retches

There are blood-smears over everything, and it's all  can do to stop from getting in there

It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here
What is that
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system
found the grating ripped right off
The little fucker was strong
Where does that lead to
Central Pumping
All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp
If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out
You've checked that end
Not yet, no
Do it
don't want that thing on my installation
want it caught and destroyed
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem
Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers
If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power
That should give us ample time to find it
Alright
Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and 'll sign a release for the weapons
Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board

You all saw what happened to Doc Revna
There are nods of agreement and general enthusiasm all round

Keep in pairs
Diller, once the first team's done their sweep  want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it
Okay
One final point
Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself
However, just to add a little incentive
'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does
This seems to appeal to those assembled there
There's a palpable buzz in the air

They look like bushmen, but they had all this hi-tech shit strapped all over 'em
They must've wasted Beauvais and Minh inside thirty seconds
Minh got off a couple of shots from that cannon of his, but he might as well have been using a - gun
don't know how the hell  made it out of there alive
He nods toward the  spear in 's hands

Whatever it's made of, it went straight through a double-layer of honeycomb polyalloy composite like it was butter

Ever
claps the man on the shoulder to reassure him
Don't worry about it, Yorkie
You're safe now
Go get come rest
nods
He gets to his feet and leaves the room
waits until the door slides shut behind him
So, what do you think
What do  think
think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't

Not at her, but at something else
Something spooking the rhinos

'Bout five minutes

With the strap of a flashlight clenched in her mouth, she's just finishing up bolting the part to the larger piece of machinery in an alcove, with simultaneously doing her best not to touch the walls which are covered by a thin layer of gunge

On the mechanism's side is a luminous digital counter giving the current cable depth in meters

He sees the winch tripod above the shaft , the cable going taut as an angler's line
The wall-mounted drum is yanked so hard the lever leaps from it's 'clamped' position, freely unspooling cable at a frightening rate
The digital counter flickers rapidly; "11

He scrambles for the winch-lever and only just manages to lock it firmly into place; the over-stressed cable vibrating with a    as it hits the shaft's edge

Half-way there he remembers his pulse-rifle and dives to the floor, grasping it just as the  reaches the top

Rhinos try to bolt but are intercepted by inhumanly powerful forces
It's wholesale carnage

Two exterior panels begin to slide closed behind the polycarbonate window
Fracture lines appear on the toughened plastic as it comes under assault from the razor-edge tip of an 's tail

Right now, the stuff sprayin' out is just burnin' up, but if we get a blow-back, a good part of the station could go with it

Instinctively, he reaches down to his wrist for the self-destruct computer

His index finger won't slide into the trigger guard

He takes the guard in both hands and exerts pressure
Problem solved
