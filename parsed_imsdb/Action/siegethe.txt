And then: Fill the frame, blocking our view of the Mercedes, and for a moment, all we can  is their gentle bleating
But as they clear frame, we can see that: Has been turned into an abattoir, its windshield shattered and bloody

Opposite him: the man, whose voice we have only heard: -- and though he wears a civilian suit, his bearing betrays his pedigree
His considerable charm and habitual skepticism are as much a product of self-discipline as his close-order drill

You hear any demand

Sussman shoots him a look
Clearly Haddad enjoys pushing his buttons
Finally, Hub stands up
-- Okay
Blue paint
Voice-altering technology -- -- available from The Sharper Image catalogue
Last  looked they weren't offering exploding paint bombs
Still, the rhetoric sounds political
Militia
Not their style
Frank --
Jihad isn't known for their sense of humor, and Hamas is raising so much money here, why queer their deal
Anyway, isn't Green the color of Islam, not blue
-- And, excuse me, but why do we immediately assume they're Arabs
want a composite of the suspects in circulation by the end of business today
Tina, you cross-check it against the mainframe
Mike, have you got the lab analysis on the paint
Not yet
-- See if any was sold in quantity the last month
Danny -- Tina's phone buzzes
She picks it up as Hub keeps going: -- find out what stop these guys got on the bus, maybe there's a witness
Hub
think we're all eager to give up our weekends on this
It just occurs to me, has anybody even committed a crime here
mean, assault with a deadly color
Hub deals with Haddad's irreverence by ignoring it
Here's what  don't like
They know explosives
They know our response time
They put in a call and walk
young agent,  , hands Hub a piece of paper: Excuse me, sir
think you should see this
Came in on the Fax
Only two words are written: "
" Release him
Him who
Who are we holding
Marv Albert
McVeigh
Sheik what's-his-name from the Trade Center
-- Omar Abdel Rahman
asshole
The Hamas guy got released in April
Under protest
(looks at the fax) Why be coy about it
You think it's phony
(covering the phone) Hub, somebody's flashing a government badge over at the warehouse where they're working on the bus
Our tech guys want to know if we're cooperating with any other agencies on this thing
Off Hub's look, we: : - Hub and Haddad join   , a tall Black man
-- She's looking for wiring signatures on the device and asking for copies of any latent prints we've managed to lift
-- Agency
Smells like it
Turns out she's also been talking to some of the passengers
In the klieg lights --
Men in white coats dust every inch and generally behave as if investigating a crashed
In their midst, a young , midwestern pretty in a serious suit
She looks up as Hub enters
Hi
Hi, there
Special Agent Anthony Hubbard
Oh, shit, 've been trying to liaise with you all day
My name is Elise Kraft, National Security Council
She offers her hand
Hub doesn't take it yet
-- And you've been trying to "liaise" with me all day
Did you think of trying the phone book, Elise
We have fourteen lines, that's not counting the unlisted ones
(still holds out hand) Hi, 'm Elise Kraft, National Security Council
Finally, he takes her hand
And doesn't let go
And 'm Colin Powell
What exactly do you people want with my bus
She tries to take her hand away, but he tightens his grip
We're all on the same team here, Agent Hubbard
Who exactly is "we" on this particular team, Elise
It's never the question that's indiscreet, only the answer
He smiles
She smiles back
Convinced she's charmed him
Tell you what, you send me an official inter-agency request for cooperation on this and 'll give you copies of everything we come up with
Otherwise, get your ass on out of here before you contaminate my crime scene any more than you already have
There's no reason to be nasty
You think this is nasty
(smiles) In case you haven't heard
The has no charter to operate domestically
Which puts you in violation of federal law
Not according to the Cooperation Agreement, Special Order 12333 -- suggest you reread the paragraph on sharing information
happen to be well within my authority
Special Order 12333 refers to domestic terrorism
You got something you want to "share" with me
(he waits
but no answer is forthcoming) Us being teammates and all
(holds up a clipboard) Unfortunately, not yet
But as soon as  do, 'll -- -- get back to me, yeah,  know
(takes the clipboard from her hands) Here's what 'm gonna do
'm gonna have a couple my "teammates" here escort you back to wherever you came from
And then 'm gonna go back to the office and wait for that official cooperation request
Okay by you
Swell
Nice meeting you, Elise
Is that Elise with an "" or an ""
Nice meeting you, too, Special Agent Hubbard
Hub watches as Elise is led away by two
Agent Rose stands nearby
Tail her
-- In Frank Haddad's home
The Haddad's are celebrating the day has finished reading the Holy Koran
(
) (in Arabic) "In the Name of Allah, the beneficent, the merciful
Say:  seek refuge in the Lord of Men, the King of Men
" Frank's  offers the final benediction
Those who are Muslim cover their face with their palms
(in Arabic) "Make me know that which  have become ignorant of; and make me recite it in the hours of the night and the day; and make it an argument for me Thou Sustainer of all the worlds

Ameen
Later -- The guests mingle, eat pastries and drink sweet tea
Nice, wasn't it
Very
(after a moment) You ever gonna stop by, pick up your things
Nearby, Mike and Danny observe them
-- He doing her
Some detective you are
They stopped
Really
wonder if she likes white guys
wonder if she likes bald guys
Hub, meanwhile, congratulates Frank's wife,
You must be so proud
Small children, small worries
Big children -- -- big orthodontia bills
Someday, you'll understand
And then Frank notices Hub's  standing in the doorway

No, Judge, not yet we're not

Tell him -- (back to the phone) Sorry, Judge
No

Shit

He's -- Khalil has a sixth sense from a lifetime on the West Bank
All of a sudden, he

All units -- He slams the car into gear and   into traffic
In various guises, break cover and  after Khalil, who shifts into overdrive
Cars  to avoid flattening him
Hub's  pulls into traffic and finds his way blocked by a narrow passage between double-parked cars
He goes for it,  his way between them
Christ
(on the phone) Judge, 'm gonna have to call you back
Into an open-air ,   veiled  with bags of fruit and vegetables
He  over stalls
The  scrapes   as it swerves into an alley, desperately trying to cut off Khalil's escape route
Shit --

To avoid killing the two boys
Hub gets out of the car and continues the pursuit on foot
He's gaining on Khalil, when: Bears down on Khalil, its doors sliding open as reach out and   appears out of nowhere and Khalil into the van and jumps in after him
What the --
The van   and  into traffic
-- An impromptu huddle in the alley
gather in a circle as   and  circle above
They just found the van
Doesn't look like they're gonna find any prints
The Agent who took the pictures pulls a color xerox-type from a digital printer in his car
Hub looks at the picture of Khalil and the good-looking Palestinian
Run him down, bring him in
Fred hands a cell phone to Hub
Floyd Rose
Go, Floyd
As he listens, the first trace of a smile graces Hub's face
: In an ordinary neighborhood
Hub sits in an
Agent Rose climbs into the front seat
've got two in the Plymouth, at least three inside, and see that guy walking his dog
He did his business about an hour ago and they're still walking

It's not his dog, numbnuts
They're spies

Two , eating take-out are surprised by Frank and Tina, their guns drawn
Hi, guys,  expect you know the drill
Hub continues warily from one empty room to the next stairway leads downstairs
As Hub starts cautiously down, muted  can be heard
Reaching the bottom, he sees: Sitting in a chair
Behind him stands one of from the warehouse
And opposite him, in a barca-lounger: -- Somehow amidst the normalcy of the furnished basement is a palpable feeling of menace
As Hub shows himself, one of the Freelancers points a Glock 9 at his head
Hub just stares him down
Ralph, spare us
The freelancer lowers the gun
Hub looks at Khalil, whose face is badly bruised
never touched him
Really
'm taking him into custody just the same
What are you going to charge him with
Jaywalking
(Hub stares at her) don't suppose we could just have a little chat with him here first
Not in this lifetime
You know, Hub
may  call you Hub
If you guys hadn't blown the surveillance, we'd have been able to follow the money
What do you think, Khalil, you would have led us right to your friends, wouldn't you
Khalil averts his eyes from any contact with her
What friends --
What have you got for me, Elise
Enlighten me
(she stonewalls) Tell me now or tell me downtown
Still nothing
Hub calls out to his agents
Get this guy out of here and book him
As the other agents approach Khalil: One phone call and he's mine again
You know the number
have -- You have "the right to remain silent," you have "the right to an attorney
Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law -- (overlapping him) Oh, come on
Do you have any idea what you're starting here, the kind of shitstorm you're about to -- (overiding her) -- Kidnapping
Obstruction of Justice
Assault
As he heads out of the room, he says to a waiting Agent
Cuff her
: ' Elise sits, handcuffed, alone in the back seat
Up front, Frank is driving with Hub beside him
So, Elise
You okay back there, you don't get carsick or anything
Those handcuffs too tight --
Shouf mountains, right
Shiite or Sunni
Wow
You're really good
(to Hub) She's really good
You ready to tell us what's going on here, Elise --
Was the paintbomb a warning
(to Haddad) American University of Beirut
was there from '79 to 82
(a look to Hub) No shit
My father taught Economics
Henry Kraft
Is there a terrorist cell operating in this city that we are unaware of
(ignoring him; to Haddad) Such a tragedy
Growing up in that city was
paradise
Like an exotic Paris, wasn't it, Frank --
You ever been in Rikers, Elise
You know what happens in there
Elise looks at him, utterly unfazed by the threat
Yum
Frank's  goes off
As they look at one another, we: : Red lights flashing, have sealed off a Brooklyn Street
On the rooftops  teams are already deploying
politely insinuate themselves into the surrounding family  and take up firing
87 Stands alone in the middle of the street
Through a Marksman's we  the terrified passengers forced to stand, catch glimpses of the , obscured by the hostages
Hub confers with the  officer-in-charge
-- definitely Arab-types, only this time they're still in there
Any communication at all
Nope
It's weird they're just in there
Get the frequency of the driver's radio and patch it through to this number
We need two lines
Frank, get a negotiator out here
#2 Sir, they've got kids in there
We count six
This rocks Hub for a moment but he covers it well
That gives us something to work with
Elise leans forward as Hub opens the driver's door
What's happening out there
Hub takes off his jacket, folds it carefully on the seat
They've taken another bus, haven't they
Talk to me
Oh, now you want to talk
You want to be my friend, is that it
Listen, these guys are the real deal
How do you know
She just looks at him
Is there a terrorist cell operating in Brooklyn
(a long moment) Yes
Was the blue paint a warning
Yes
And 'm afraid this time they'll blow the bus
If they wanted to blow the bus then why haven't they blown the bus --
don't know
He starts away
Agent Hubbard
Please
Maybe  can help
Has been hastily improvised behind a  van
The driver's name is Larry Kaiser
He says they've got explosives strapped to their chests, they got automatic weapons, and they're speaking Arabic
Where the hell's the negotiator
Tunnel's got twenty minute delays and they're working on both bridges
(to the cop) What else did he say about the device
Did he describe it at all
Anything about a button, or a cord, or
Pulls up and raises its satellite dish
(almost involuntary) Oh, God
Frank turns to look at her
She is suddenly pale
(as it dawns on her) They're not here to negotiate
Meaning
They were waiting for the cameras
Hub is deep in conversation with the cops
Frank interrupts
-- Hub
Hub looks up
Frank nods for Elise to repeat what she said
They're want the newsies here
They want everybody watching
Hub and Frank look at each other
Can this be true
You've got the shooters in place
-- So
Use 'em
What
Kill 'em now
They just look at her
It's lose-lose any way you play it
Do you want to lose little or lose big
The  officer has been listening: got the marksmen on the com -- They're looking for a clean shot
As the Policeman waits for a response on his radio, two more pull up
The   has come to town: reporters breathlessly offer their live, on-the-scene reports
Hub and Elise stare at one another
Shooter says they've got the passengers all standing in the aisles
He says, no go
Hub can see the dread in Elise's eyes
As the seconds tick away,    jockey for position above
(to the cops) We have rules of engagement we're gonna follow here, folks, so put the safeties back on your weapons
(looks at Elise) Nobody's killing anybody until we see what's what
He grabs the phone
(on the phone) Larry, this is Agent Hubbard of the , 'll be negotiating our way out of this
Let me talk to one of them
know
know
You just hang in there, Larry
No, don't worry, 've got somebody here who can translate
He looks over at Frank, who's listening on another cell
(on the phone) Sir, -- My name is Anthony Hubbard
don't have any authority to make deals, or respond to demands
just want to find out if you need anything in there
If any of the passengers are in need of medical attention
He waits as Frank translates
Hub covers the mouthpiece
-- Frank
don't know if they understand
(on the phone) Sir, is there anything you want to say to me
That  can tell my people here
The guy's just breathing into the phone, maybe they're not even Arabs
(on the phone) get the feeling you don't want to talk, but will you listen --
Whatever grievance you have, whatever quarrel -- surely it doesn't involve these children -- Still no response
(on the phone) So 'm gonna ask you to
please
let
the
children go
No response -- then suddenly, the bus doors And six bewildered, ashen-faced  step out before the doors  closed behind them
As Hub and a couple of the cops hurry out from behind the barricades to help the children cross the -'  to safety, a smattering of breaks out among the cops
Elise tries to hold back tears
Okay, here we go
(on the phone) Thank you, sir
appreciate that gesture,  really do
The best way to get what you want in these situations is to show yourself to be reasonable
As you've just done
(Haddad translates) Now we've got some more to talk about
Elise watches as the news cameras zoom in
(on the phone) am unarmed, as you can see
So propose
You let the rest of the passengers go, and  take their place
That way, there's no pizza deliveries or bathroom breaks to worry about -- and all these -- (indicates  teams) -- people
will disappear
Frank shakes his head, don't do this
Hub's look says translate it
Frank does it
They all wait
(on the phone) 'm gonna take your silence to mean you're considering my offer -- Elise looks at Frank, she can't help but admire his bravery
How about we just start with a few of the elderly people you got on there
It's got to be hard for the older folks to be standing all this time
Hub looks back at Frank
Still no response
few elderly start down the steps
(on the phone) Thank you, sir
Now let's just let these -- Hurls Hub backwards as: To be replaced by a high-end, almost electronic
Imbeds itself into car doors, bus benches, doorways as every in a three-block radius is
Replaces blue paint in a horrific shower
Fights for consciousness
Rush to his side to see if he is alright -- but them
Though their mouths move it is only the that overwhelms us -- as we realize that Hub has been momentarily  by the blast
When at last Hub manages to speak, his words are  and -- as if the playback heads of a tape recorder needed to be cleaned
'm
alright
'm -- Frank Haddad bends down close and we can lip-read him saying, "Just hang in there, buddy
" -- okay
Just let me -- And then he leans over to  in the street
Slowly bleeds in through the white noise -- mercifully for us, and for Hub, who wipes his mouth and looks up, realizing that his  is coming back
He reaches for Frank's outstretched hand and stands, albeit woozily
Is anybody -- But the look in Frank's eyes says it all
Is numbing
we associate with other countries
And then he sees Elise
Her face is cut and bleeding, but as their eyes meet, her look is one of absolute compassion
: Crowded into the now-overflowing
In absolute denial of his physical condition, Hub paces like a caged animal
-- every trap, every hole
want to rumble every mosque, every community center, every student organization that's ever said an unkind word want the heat turned up under all our assets, all our informers, every snitch gets twisted inside out
And put some money out on the street -- Arab community hates these people as much as we do
They'll help
(turns to Mike) Have you got positive  on -- Hub, we don't have positive  on anybody
We need more hands
Fred -- 'm on it
He picks up a phone and begins requesting Agent transfers
want to talk to Khalil
He's down the hall
Now she picks up a phone and adds to the cacophony
-- Conferences with  at 9:00, 12:00, 4:00 and 9:00
Call your families, find a sleeping bag, nobody leaves this office until we have a strand to pull
Oklahoma City, people
The first twenty-four hours are the only twenty-four hours
And  don't want to see anybody walking
- Hub and Frank watch Khalil through a
The bruises on Khalil's face have deepened
Doctor seen him
He's on his way up
Got a cigarette --
You don't smoke
Hub pockets the pack of cigarettes and walks into: Frank hangs back in the doorway
Hub pulls up a chair, turns it backwards, and sits down very close to Khalil
Ten thousand dollars
Frank translates
Khalil pretends not to understand
Khalil
want to talk about the money
Again Frank translates
And again, Khalil looks blank
Okay
Hub reaches into his pocket and casually takes out the pack of cigarettes
Khalil's eyes widen
Hub smiles at him
At the  of the match lighting,  begins to bead on Khalil's forehead
Hub takes his time  the cigarette -- drawing deep so the tip turns bright red
Khalil unconsciously in his chair
(to Frank, re: Khalil) Doesn't like second hand smoke
Hub turns back to Khalil, casually gesturing with his cigarette
Khalil almost jumps out of his skin
You ready to talk about money
Frank hasn't even begun to translate before Khalil begins - in Arabic
(translating) He says he loves America and only wanted to get away from the security services at home
Tears stream down Khalil's face
He kneels at Hub's feet
(still translating) He says he's sorry but he didn't know he was doing something bad
His cousin introduced him to a man who promised him two hundred dollars for his dowry if he'd bring the suitcase to an address in Brooklyn
(to Hub) He's a cut-out
-- Hub hands Tina back the pack of cigarettes
Nasty habit
(to Danny) 3830 Flatbush Avenue
-- Bursts into an empty apartment
On the floor, a fax machine continuously sending the message: "
" -- We want every rental agreement from every landlord in Brooklyn
Hotels, motels, flophouses
(to the other agents) It's cash, guys
They're the only ones in America using cash
-- The room is dark
operates an overhead
This is a spectograph of the semtex used in the bomb
Look at the benzene spike
This is the genuine article
(another slide) Now
this one's from the barracks in Dhahran
As you can see, the signature is identical
-- () is cross-referencing data of suspected terrorists scroll past
surveillance of Ahmed bin Talal
The ruined army barracks
-- ask it if they've ever hit buses
The techie types in a few commands:  of destroyed file past
Tel Aviv
Jerusalem
Beirut
None a match
-- not according to the mainframe
-- The   now resembles an archeological dig
Floodlights on stanchions
Forensic , on their hands and knees, use   and brushes to search for latent prints
Different color  divides the site into a grid
-- with a -tip
Bone shards, hair, fingernails -- Nearby, Danny and Mike observe Hub's intensity
-- He's way over his head
Shut the fuck up and go give somebody a parking ticket
-- In
sifts through a plastic bag of fingertips and teeth
Scans each into a computer
Not yet
Sequence omitted from original script
-- Hub is      which are all  the terrible incident, over and over again
"-- Today; Tel Aviv has come to Brooklyn
The question
is why
" Finally, he turns away so no one will see
His eyes are hot with the emotion
You okay
The Fingerprint techie races in, sparing Hub a response
Got one
-- Hub and Tina address twenty agents
Ladies and Gentlemen, meet the late Ali Waziri
He projects a  of the dead Terrorist onto the wall
Tina talked to the Israelis and traced this sucker to a group operating out of Ramallah
That's the West Bank, not the West Side for those of you just joining us from Nebraska
few appreciative
They're all exhausted
This is the first good news in a bitch of a day
Okay, we've pulled his landing card and his -94
So now we know he came in three days ago, out of Frankfurt -- She points to where:  - has been created out of colored strips beneath a bank of silent  monitors
What we need now is to fill in the time between his arrival and the incident
All known associations, and most of all, we need an address
-- The - is progressing
add tie-lines, dedicated fax lines, wats lines and scrambled lines
Cable everywhere
Danny and Frank pore over Ali Waziri's -94
IAP66
What's IAP66
Hold on, hold on, 'm looking it up -- -- Today, Danny
Wait, wait -- Here we go
Student Visa, -1
Hub has been pacing, nearby
Where's the original --
In his passport
Which is
vaporized
Where's the copy
At the point of issuance
Could be the American Consulate in Tel Aviv
The American Consulate in Amman, Cairo, Alexandria, Riyadh -- all an easy drive from the West Bank -- Hub suddenly had to fight off a wave of nausea and dizziness
What time is it --
Three-fifteen
(off Hub's blank look) When's the last time you ate
Fred Darius, the young agent, appears
Sir
They want you in the lab
Hub peers through the eyepiece at a   of fiber
(
) Pure, unadulterated, Egyptian cotton
You're saying they're Egyptian
No
No
'm just saying -- See
-- It's what they use for funerals
The guy was wearing a shroud
He looks at Frank
It's just as Elise said
The real deal
Let's see if she's ready to talk
Elise sits quietly with the stillness of those who have been there before
Hub enters
thought one phone call and you were out of here
didn't make the call
Why not
She just looks at him, entirely neutral
Are you alright --
Just some tinnitus in my left ear -- They look across the professional chasm that divides them
need to know what  don't know
Life's too short
But there's a hint of some thawing in her tone
You hungry
We ordering in --
: Sequence omitted from original script
Hub and Elise sit, eating corned beef sandwiches
-- The funeral shroud is the final step in the ritual of self- purification
First a fast, then -- -- the washing of the body, then the shroud
saw it on Sixty Minutes
Tell me something  don't know
She pauses, always gauging how much to reveal
And when
Last March in Iraq, we identified the man we believe responsible for bombing the army barracks last year
In August, he went to Lebanon
Where he was
extracted
Extracted
Extracted by whom
(she just looks at him) see
His name is Sheik Ahmed bin Talal
He's Iraqi
And something of a religious leader
With something of a devoted following
(she nods) Okay,  can understand why we might not want to publicize the fact that our government's in the kidnapping business, but why not tell us
He's still being
debriefed
They're not ready to go public with charges
What else you got on his followers
Clearly, they're committed
Meaning
In this game, the most committed wins
So they'll just keep coming until we release him
Unless we match their commitment with our own
What about talking to this sheik
You don't think they've got guys talking to the sheik
Except the sheik isn't talking
So who's giving the orders
How do they coordinate, pick their targets
Believe me, we've put every resource we've got onto that very question
(puts down her fork) Otherwise
we wait
We wait
She looks at him
For one brief moment the mask drops away
If there's anybody on earth who knows how you feel, it's me
But you've got to let it go
Those people were dead the minute they got on the bus
Frank Haddad appears, making his way toward their table
Sorry, boss
Hello, Elise
Mmmm, is that pastrami
(tastes it; then with his mouth full) Oh, yeah, we made the guy in the picture
Sequence omitted from original script
: Where Students sit inside and , then  some more
(
) My people
The last of the unambivalent smokers
(shakes his head) Monsters
The toughest motherfucker in Bed-Stuy is a muffin compared to some of these guys
They watch as  gets his bill from the waiter
His name's Samir Nazhde
Teaches Arab Studies at Brooklyn College
He sponsored Ail Waziri's student visa
And dig this -- his brother blew up a movie theatre in Tel Aviv
You might consider leaving him alone
Why would  consider doing that --
In the cafe, Samir counts cash to leave on the table
Play him like a cop and haul him in now and get your arrest, or tag him and let him lead you to the really big fish
(an arabic curse) You're fishing and he's getting visas for bombers
You ever heard of catch and release
Yes, and he's on the next plane for Tunis
Hub looks at Elise
Samir is leaving -- it's now or never
Take him down
(keys his radio) Go
brace Samir politely but firmly, and lead him to their car
Samir slides into the back seat next to Elise
In the  , Hub watches as a look seems to pass between them
Then again, it may not have happened
Samir Nazhde, my name is Frank Haddad, 'm a Federal Agent
We have reason to believe you are an accessory to the bombing of Bus 87
Are you crazy --
You are an associate of Ali Waziri
Who
know no one by that name
Elise is looking out the window, seemingly oblivious
You got him a student visa
sign these applications as a matter of course, hundreds of them
Everyone wants to come to the land of opportunity and Baywatch
Elise tries to keep a smile off her face
Hub clocks this
You spent two years in Israeli jails during the Intifada
The only ones who didn't were women like you
Frank  him across the mouth
Samir says something in Arabic to Frank, who responds in kind
Frank -- Sorry
Family matter
(to Samir) You're going downtown, my friend
You cannot hold me
know my rights
watch American television
Defrauding the  is a Federal Offense
(hands Samir to waiting agents) Reservation for one, please
: - They enter the
It's well past midnight
People are sacked-out in sleeping bags while others continue working
Club Fed
Frank leans over Danny Sussman, who has fallen asleep, face down on his desk, and sings in a lovely brogue: (singing) "Oh, Danny-boy, the perps, the perps, are call-ing
(as he awakens) We need a search warrant on Samir
Frank, c'mere a sec
want to show you something
He leads Frank into another
Perched on nearby desk, Elise is dialing a phone, she stops to watch them: (quietly) Frank, you ever hit a prisoner again 'll have your badge
-- Someday  will tell you what those people did to my village in '71
Hub waits for him to calm down
(touches his arm) Okay
But right now, act as if 'm capable of saying something funny
Now, let's go see about that warrant
As they walk back, Hub says to Danny: Find me a Judge who'll play ball this time
And set up a polygraph for Samir
still don't understand why we're tipping our hand with him -- What's there to tip
You're just trying to protect your asset
(to Elise, pointedly:) Aren't you, Elise --
He's your Joe, your asset
He's working for you, you're his case officer -- right
How should she respond
How thin should she slice it
Sometimes
in addition to being a nationality, being a Palestinian is also a
profession
lucrative one
Meaning, he's your Joe
Mine
Yours
The Israelis
The Saudis
At one time or another, everybody in the Middle East has slept with everybody else
So you're saying
you sleep around
Only professionally
So we share him
No
(to Frank) -- Call , find out his status and start deportation proceedings
can't let you do that
Oh, you can't let me do that
What precisely is your involvement with these people
(sighs, then:) Samir's been a very important
project of mine for some time
'm the only one he'll deal with
He's very well-connected -- and extremely high-strung
Call the judge
(looks at Frank) How easy is it to get inside, Frank
How good are your sources in the mosques
How many people you got in Hamas --
Franks shakes his head, ruefully
She's right
No surveillance
've seen your deft touch
Daily reports
We tap his phone
And  get to see the transcripts
Fair enough
And  run him
We share him
He can't know we're talking
Then don't tell him
Done
(to Frank) Let him fly
(back to her) But we better start seeing product
She nods
deal
For now
Any more surprises for me
Not tonight
Then 'm going home to get some things
'll have somebody drive you
'll grab a cab
And he's gone
Frank turns to Elise: Elise
'm really high strung, too
She just smiles and walks away
-- Not many people around
Hub stands on the corner cruises up
On duty
Available
He slows long enough to see that Hub is black and passes right by
The taxi driver stops just long enough for Hub to slam his on the windshield
Hub sits in back, hurtling into the night
The driver's identifies him as
Hub shakes his head
As the hot  hits him, he runs his hands through his hair and feels the
Dried blood runs off in rivulets from his hands
Not his own
He leans against the shower wall, closes his eyes
: -- We are in her apartment
Samir looms over her
You let him   --
You cannot care about me and let such things happen
Next time don't be such a smart ass -- Sometimes  hate you just because you are so American
It makes me want to hurt you
think about fucking you and hurting you
Elise can taste the blood in her mouth -- but it's the price she's come to accept
In a heartbeat, it's all business
-- You want to fuck me
Then work with me
Don't tell me what  have to do
No
Do we really want to have this conversation again
Do we --
Something quietly ominous in her tone
He lowers his eyes
And like a sailboat, Elise changes tack
Strokes his arm
need you to help me
need you to be strong
As you have always been strong
For both of us
-- Samir
Look at me
-- He's fallen asleep in a chair
In his lap is a pile of visa applications
His  goes off
He rouses himself
-- Sex without any shred of tenderness
As Samir kisses the back of her neck, we  in her eyes the thousand-yard stare
-- In the doorway of an apartment building, Frank hands Hub a styrofoam cup of coffee
It's a ritual between them
-- -- Some people just cannot live in the camps
For my brother, it was already like dying
The only thing he lives for is movies
He sits up in bed, reaching for another cigarette
-- And then some sheik tells him that, to die for Allah is beautiful
If he does this thing, our parents will be taken care of, and he will live on in Paradise with seventy virgins
Seventy
(sighs) And my brother, he needs to believe it very much, so he straps ten sticks of dynamite to his chest and goes to the movies
(a rueful laugh) And  become a
It is very confusing
-- So who are you afraid of betraying
You know these people
They bomb, they maim
Do they represent the Palestine you want to build
(looks at him) They're using you
You are using me, too
Everybody uses the Palestinians
We are the whores of the Middle East
(looks at her) You make reports about our little talks --
What about fucking me

Someone is waiting
It's Devereaux, in a civilian suit
Hi
understand they call you Hub
know who you are, General
(offering his hand) Bill Devereaux

Same time was running the -- -- 173rd
Put me through school
God
Duty
Honor
Country
Where on Capitol Hill, Wall Street, or Hollywood would you find one man who's even paused over one of those words in the last ten years
Hub is unsure why he's audience to such a command performance
What, uh, brings you here, General
Can  get you some coffee
You want me to get to the point
The President's concerned
He's worried that -- have you met him by any chance
No, sir,  haven't
know -- reading the papers -- terrorism's a real concern for him
And your job is to -- -- With all the affection for the man  can tell you he doesn't know fuckall about terrorism, or the Mideast, that  don't put on his cue cards
What he's expert in is his own survival
You get my meaning
didn't guess you came all this way for a cup of coffee
Agent Hubbard -- you look like you think 'm here to take your baby away
With all respect for your expertise, sir
We're on track here
Which is what  said to the President -- the Army is not some big green police department
Stick with the man on the ground
appreciate your support
You're sure you're not chasing your own tail, though
Hub considers for a moment, then: What do you know about Sheik Ahmed Bin Talal
Old news
Maybe not
We've received two communications -- from the bombers to "Release Him
" We can't release him
know our stated policy is not to negotiate with terrorists, but -- Hub, we can't release him because we don't have him
We never had him
And besides that, he's dead
The  says -- The
The  couldn't predict the fall of the Berlin Wall until bricks were hitting them in the head
(resuming) The Libyans snatched the Sheik -- some sectarian Muslim thing -- 'll explain it next time you have a free week
They killed him
Qaddafi put out disinformation that it was us
Who was your source on this
Elise Kraft
woman will never know the Middle East
You're talking about a culture that keeps its women slipcovered
Elise Kraft can't tell a Sheik from the prophylactic of the same name
appreciate the heads up
Devereaux rises, offers his hand
As they shake, Elise sticks her head in the door without knocking
Hub, we've got Judge Frankel in -- (as Devereaux turns around) Oh
Hello, General
Please, don't let me -- (to Hub) Sorry
That tip on the landlord looks solid
The judge will see us right away
Sounds like  should get out of your way
We're there if you need us
(at the door; to Elise) Your father well, Elise
As can be expected
How's Maggie
Top of her game
(heads out) Well, go get 'em
And he's gone
Elise turns to Hub
Making new friends
How's your lip --
She looks at Hub -- and now she knows that he knows
She brazens it out: So
you like to watch --
No
Just learning about commitment
It's a full contact sport
: '  -- Judge Frankel, 60, puts down his sandwich and wipes his hands
-- You're telling me that just because some Brooklyn landlord tips you off that he's been paid in cash, you have the right to call in the cavalry -- Hub, as far as  know, paying cash is not yet a crime in this country
You're not hearing me
This Khalil was carrying cash for -- -- You've observed him giving cash to -- No, but -- -- But you have hard evidence linking this apartment to the people that blew up bus 87 --
Elise sits quietly beside Frank, observing Hub's trials
know we'll turn up trace elements of semtex, chemicals
something
And when you do, you'll get your warrant
What about as a feasibility study
Meaning
We enter first, take a look, then fill out the warrant
Tell me the difference between that and breaking-and-entering
We're the good guys
Not good enough
What is good enough, Judge
Another bus
school, maybe
These things come in waves
Waves mean nothing to me; there's been a wave of violent crime committed by black people in this city for the past twenty years, but if you came to me with a plan to put all black people behind bars as a preventative measure 'd send you packing
There's a price to be paid for living in a free society -- -- and not in cash  guarantee it
Hub catches Elise's eye -- "we're out of here
" Elise and Hub climb seemingly endless
-- Not two Judges from now, not two from now, not two  from now
These guys could split any and you've lost your best shot at -- Frank's working another warrant -- You don't understand, they're pros
From the age of twelve they've been dodging people like you, people better than you
You mean people like you
-- no matter how sparkling your record is, no matter how terrified you are to fail -- Finally he stops, turns on her: It's
against
the
law
-- Just because you went to night school, or filled out the back of a matchbook or whatever you did to get a law degree doesn't make you Sir Thomas More
Just because you talk the talk doesn't make you an expert
And just because you read my file doesn't make you an expert on me
You're gonna lose them and they're gonna do another horrible -- -- You think  want to lose them
Where do you get off talking that shit
(controls himself
) If  don't take 'em down properly they'll be on the street two hours from now
could find dynamite, semtex, plutonium and a book of matches in there and unless 've got the right warrant it's all inadmissible They've also got a warrant
warrant from God
They're ready to die
And your quaint laws don't mean shit to these people
My quaint laws
Last  checked you were an American citizen
And these happen to be the only laws we got
(turns on her) Look, 'm just a cop, okay, and 'm real sorry the cold war's over, and you Masters of the Universe got nothing going on over there in Afghanistan or Iraq or wherever -- but you're just not in the Middle East anymore
Oh, really
They reach the top of the stairs where Frank is waiting
He dangles a piece of paper -- the warrant -- and grins
-- Hub looks through the surveillance equipment focused on an apartment across the street -- paper shades drawn
Wearing a set of , Elise listens intently to the Arabic conversation
They're discussing how hard it is to find a decent cup of coffee over here
(hands headset to Frank) make out three voices
What do you have on the infrared
Three sounds right
If we had microwave we'd know for sure
The 's got microwave, how come we don't have microwave
Hub, meanwhile is question a Syrian Landlord
-- three of them
All day long they watch tv
And eat pizza
Nothing but pizza, pizza, pizza
Hub looks over at Frank
They've got a way in

Sequence omitted from original script
-- Mike Johannson, carrying two , knocks on a door
Hub, Frank, and a small army of  lock and load
Opens the door to the length of a chain and hands Mike a twenty-dollar bill
You want change, right --
No
You gonna open the door, or what --
The Arab motions, leave them on the ground
Jesus, didn't ya hear crime's down seven-percent
Muttering, he sets the pizza down and heads downstairs
After a moment we  the chain pulled and the door open
The Young Arab sets the pizza on an orange crate
Two other in the next room barely take their eyes off the rerun of "Hunter
" But as the young Arab opens the box: Hidden within,  with a blinding , knocking him to the ground

Lie down on the floor with your hands behind your back --
,  -- Have not been affected
Not only were they in the next room, but also their eyes were averted from the
But only get off half a clip each before they are by a fusillade of  return-fire
The Young Arab, momentarily disoriented, stumbles to his feet, only to be confronted by six armed agents -- all aiming at his chest
Drop your weapon
The terrorist puts his gun to his mouth and
As the  drifts lazily toward the ceiling, Hub calls out from behind the table: What about the others
See if we can get a pulse -- Other Agents scurry in to hover over the inert
Terminal
Same here
(softly) Gone
Hub picks himself up in time to see Elise, kneeling beside the body of the Young Arab, her hand on his boyish chest
We got semtex, we got detcord, same stuff as the bus, the whole enchilada
few  and high-fives as the adrenaline rush of the firefight abates
Frank opens the remaining box
Anybody like anchovies --
Then from across the room, Hub kneels beside an ominous- looking
claymore mine
Goddamn it
What --
It didn't fire
They had it rigged to the door and it didn't fire
Frank stares at the lethal booby-trap
Hub shakes his head
We're too old to be lucky, Frank
: -- Where Mike and Tina are dancing their asses off
Around them, other  from the takedown laugh and drink
Hub and Elise sit, watch them cut loose
(sips her drink) My first boyfriend was Palestinian
My father liked to say, they seduce you with their suffering
brings her another drink
You ever been over there --
(he shakes his head, no) The courtesy with which they welcome you into their homes
And the people, these incredibly
warm people in this
austere land
But you work against them
Only the crazies
tend to be suspicious of all true believers
(looks at him) Present company included
So 'm a fanatic
Let's just say you don't seem the ambivalent type
Is that right
So why're are you a fed
That's what my nephew keeps asking me
"Why you with The Man, Unc
" Well
What'd you tell him
You read my file
You tell me
Let's see
Catholic school
Captain of this, president of that
Hard work, fair play, make a difference, change the system from within
Rah
Rah
Rah
That was in my file
Tell me 'm wrong
He studies her for a moment
What --
You believe in anything, Elise --
Like what, for instance
How about right and wrong
It's easy to choose between right and wrong
What's hard is choosing the wrong that's more right
just want to make it all
a little
better
(finishes her drink) Ignore me
'm shitfaced
Frank appears to lean over their table
So am  --
Hey, Elise
tell us about being a spook
Ever meet Aldrich Ames
Weren't you at the Bay of Pigs
You were in charge of Waco, right -- Or was that Ruby Ridge
The Shah of Iran, Noriega,  love the way you guys predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And
Edgar Hoover wore a dress
She laughs and stands up to dance: What do you say, Hub
Peace
But as he grudgingly stands up, a  comes on
They stand there awkwardly
Finally, he takes her into his arms
This feels like high school
-- only my prom date wasn't packing a gun
Mine's a 9 mm
How big is yours
Two inches
From the ground
(laughing, they dance closer) So what's the latest from Samir want a list of every visa he sponsored
Not sure he'll do it
once knew this undercover guy, started to care so much about his source -- -- Samir's a source
Period
Have you considered that he might also be in bed with the other side
Samir in bed with them
That would too much to wish for
You're so confident
Only in bed
Tina watches them
She rolls her eyes at Frank
And then: low  as the light  and the chandelier sways
Whoa
What do they put in these drinks --
They got earthquakes in Manhattan
But Elise is not too drunk to make her way to the door
Hub joins her
Already, in the distance, the

Hub, Elise and Frank sit grimly silent

Finally, they can take it no longer and step out into a chorus of
Past the frustrated drivers

From the jeweled clutchbag to the tasteful necklace, everything is perfect, except: And now we : -- Haphazardly pulled-up over the steps and the already unspooling their hoses
Cops, Firemen, 's

Sits, weeping quietly beneath the once proud stone lions
Their faces cut and bleeding, stumble around, disoriented
As Hub and Elise continue toward a  we have never heard before in this country
kind of keening

Everybody standing around
Oh, Jesus
crunching underfoot, they can only watch as horribly disfigured  are carried out
shoves a microphone in Hub's face
Is it true the governor was attending tonight's benefit --
don't know
Who it is 'm speaking to --
Hub ignores the reporter
He sees that Elise is already tearing off part of her skirt to bandage a
He takes off his coat and goes to work beside her
: Hub sits alone
(
) Folks, as you can probably tell, we have begun our descent into Washington's National airport
- Hub reaches up to his
As anyone who's ever flown with a sinus problem knows, the pain is excruciating
-- You alright
But we can only - her question
He's sweating now
Over this, we : (
) Either we answer this threat quickly and convincingly or next week there'll be a hundred more all over the world
Sequence omitted from original script
-- As Hub climbs the steps toward the gleaming dome, the debate continues within: (
) Sounds great, General, except why can't we find out who's behind it -- strategy session chaired by General Devereaux
Sleeves rolled up, silver coffee service
Staff members abound
These sects are organized so you need a kill to your credit to get inside
It makes undercover operations impossible
What that leaves us is
we're working on it
How about who's behind who's behind this
Libya
Iraq
Iran
Possibly Syria
Ask a question
Get an atlas
All  know is that we must respond
Respond, sure
But how
Find out who it is and bomb the shit out of them
And if we can't find out --
The question hangs in the air
Look it keeps escalating
First a bus, then the theatre
What's next
Anything but leadership
With all respect, Senator, why don't we just stipulate that the President is a dumb son of a bitch so we can all get down to business
An icebreaker
Everyone laughs
(
) What about sending in the Guard
(
) The National Guard are trained for riot control not counter-terrorism
The Army then
've seen the contingency plans
It's settled legal doctrine, posse comitatus, that the Army not be turned against our own people
Even if that's what our own people are asking for, three to one
If the President is willing to declare a State of Emergency -- President Lincoln declared martial law in 1862
He suspended -- -- which the Supreme Court later found un-constitutional
Ex parte Milligan
And 've got an election in November
Ex-United States Congressman
Guys, guys, the President lost a lot of friends last night -- Not to mention six points in the polls
-- And his plane lands in two hours
We owe it to him to have a consensus
You don't fight a junkyard dog with rules
What you do is take the leash off your own, bigger, meaner dog
General
The Army is a broadsword not a scalpel
You do not want us in an American city
But hypothetically
how long would it take you to -- We only go if the President invokes the War Powers Act
understand that, General
Let us imagine, though, for a moment, that the order has been given
on Devereaux
As he weighs his remarks, we , almost imperceptibly to: As  is poured over anonymous hands in a ritualized manner
we  the  of chanting
--    -- Twelve hours after the President gives the word we can be on the ground
One light infantry division of ten thousand seven hundred men
Elements of the Rapid Deployment Force combined with Special Forces -- Delta
's, tanks, helicopters
And of course, the ubiquitous -16A1 assault rifle, a humble weapon until you see a man carrying one outside your local bowling alley or Seven- Eleven
It will be noisy, it will be scary and it will not be mistaken for a  parade
-- Where the same anonymous hands lift a cotton shroud
We watch in - as it drifts down a shoulder
-- That means civilian casualties
At a minimum it's a drunk private joyriding in a Hummer who runs down an old lady in Greenpoint
At a maximum
(sighs) Make no mistake
We will hunt the enemy
We will find the enemy
And we will kill the enemy
-- Turning the key in an ignition
An engine rumbles to life
-- (looks at them) And no card-carrying member of the is more deadset against it
than  am
Which is why  urge you
no,  implore you not to consider this option

The Chief of Staff sighs
know what the President will say
What's that
That's exactly why you're the only man for the job
-- Emerges from a dark garage like a beast from a cave
-- The Army General speaks up
remind you General Devereaux does not speak for official Army policy
police function has become accepted as our role in Haiti, in Somalia -- -- Could  interrupt
Everyone looks over at Hub
Devereaux smiles
That's Anthony Hubbard,
He's the  on the ground up there
They took out the first cell less than 36 hours after bus 87
suggest we hear what he has to say -- He nods to Hub, who acknowledges the vote of confidence
There is something you probably haven't thought about doing
And that is --
Nothing
Don't over-react
(off their incredulity) With all respect, gentlemen, 'm just a cop
To you these people may be martyrs, but to me they're criminals
And a criminal is no more than somebody who thinks he's better than everyone else
And he's not better
He only has to be wrong once
And that's where we come in
We run down a tip from a landlord, or we pick up a latent print from a bus
Our phones are ringing off the hook with people from the Arab community wanting to help
He measures his words carefully
Unaccustomed to these kind of august circumstances
They love this country and they hate that these criminals are giving them a bad name
With their help and some old-fashioned shoe leather, we'll nail these guys
-- Amen to that
Thank you, Agent Hubbard
, too, think we should proceed cautiously
(looks around) Now we've got an Agency briefing prepared
Some of you may not know Sharon Bridger
Sharon was posted in Iraq as part of our covert operations during the Gulf War
-- Sharon
--  as, from behind him, comes a familiar : We all know the traditional model of a terrorist network
One cell controlling all others

Hub looks to the back of the room at Elise, who's no longer Elise
She looks blithely at Hub as if nothing is amiss

Why was there no warning from Samir
Because he didn't know anything
Says Samir
Says me
Maybe 'll ask him
Over my dead body
Over six hundred dead bodies
They stare at one another
Both are tired and raw
Look, he's one of the good guys
Okay
How the fuck can you be so sure
Because he helped me recruit the network in Iraq
He just stares at her
We were part of the operation to destabilize Saddam Hussein
Printing up fake dinars, arming the Kurds -- -- and financing the Sheik
He's Iraqi
He was going to be our Ayatollah Khomeini -- -- And help bring down Saddam

Samir was the go- between
He risked his life for us over there
So who are they
Give me names, Give me pictures
Not some history lesson
can't give you pictures because don't know what they look like
We did everything at arm's length
So you got nothing
've got Samir
Has he had any contact with them
Minimal
How does he do it
He can't
They initiate
And otherwise
He's waiting
He's waiting
What's he waiting for
More bodies
We got lots more buildings in midtown, maybe he's waiting to see how many they can blow up
Look,  know how you must feel -- '      -- They'll make contact soon
How
Why soon
She looks at him, refusing to divulge anything more
Suddenly, Hub grabs her arm and roughly shoves her into: (viciously) What's the tradecraft, Sharon
Ironsites, visuals
love all that spy shit
(still, she says nothing) 'm gonna haul your boy downtown, strap his ass to a polygraph and ask him all about you
Then 'm gonna send the transcripts to a friend of mine at the Times who just loves to write about the latest  link to some political horror show
You burn him, you lose any chance you ever had
It's lose-lose from here on in, who said that
'm not fucking with you
How can you possibly remember who you're fucking
She slaps him, hard
Without hesitation he slaps her back
She claws at his face, but he grabs her wrist and bends her arm behind her back

No, we do not

And because he has a more pressing agenda
General, do you know that after yesterday's attack, half the parents in this country kept their children out of school --
(Devereaux nods) They're attacking our way of life

Two women waved through
If you are one of these twenty young men, you can hide among a population of similar ethnic background
Unfortunately for you, you can only hide there
And that population, in the classic immigration pattern, is concentrated
Right here in Brooklyn
Hub and Sharon stare at the Orwellian tableau
We intend to seal off this borough
And then we intend to squeeze it
This is the land of opportunity, gentlemen
The opportunity to turn yourselves in
After sundown tonight any young man fitting the profile described who has not cooperated will be arrested and detained
Hub and Sharon show their 's to an
Would you follow me, please
The General is expecting you
He leads him to    on the service roadway
There is historically nothing more corrosive to the morale of an army than policing its own citizens
The swarthy teenager is being interrogated by
But the enemy would be sadly mistaken if they were to doubt our resolve
They are now face to face with the most fearsome killing machine in the history of man
And  intend to use it
And be back on base in time for the play-offs
That is all
Devereaux sees Hub and strides over to him: Hub
Good to see you again
can't say the same, sir
Not in that uniform
thought you were against this
am against it
It wasn't my call
"'m only following orders" didn't work at Nuremberg
It may not be your policy but they're your tactics
Your operation had its chance, Hub, and you couldn't get it done
You're down three touchdowns
Time to bring in the first string
Against our own team
Devereaux suddenly goes ice cold
Are you questioning my patriotism
'm questioning your judgement, yes, sir
Hub,  want you to take a moment and reflect on my life as a soldier have a dozen tropical diseases 'll never entirely get rid of
set off metal detectors with the shrapnel in my ass
have watched men die and have killed
Now  am serving my President and quite possibly not the best interests of my country, but my profession doesn't afford me the luxury of that distinction
won't question your patriotism but don't you ever again question my command
'm not under your command, General
Take a good look around, my friend, and tell me that's still true
(softening his tone) But we're not shutting you out
In fact,  can't do it without you, Hub
need men like you
Men willing to put it on the line like you did in that schoolroom
(gestures to his uniform) These stars mean  have been putting it on the line for thirty years
and never made a mistake worth remembering
Don't tell me  made a mistake about you
-- Hub and Sharon exit the command tent
(ironic) They're not shutting us out
They need men like me
He'll fuck it up, the arrogant prick
You ever met anybody so in love with the sound of his own voice
We're putting Samir in play
Now
With all this going on
He's freaked
Oh, right, he's high-strung
Only you can manage him
You and the and the  and God-knows-who-else you're really working for --
(seething) Get back in there, Sharon, Elise, whatever the fuck your name is -- They'll probably make you a Colonel
if you're not one already
She gestures at the military leviathan
All this
is no more in our interest than it is in yours, Hub
What, exactly, are your interests, Sharon
You protect Samir, you protect the agency
You're interested in protecting everything but your country
You have no idea what  do for my country
No, and  don't want to know
With you or without you we're putting Samir in play
Now
She looks at him for a long moment
Considering: One more lamb to the slaughter

Oh, my God

Samir reappears, wild-eyed
Listen to that --
Are you listening

You can stop it all right now
What are you talking about --
The army is here
They're setting up interrogation centers right now
They're torturing people in cellars
Let's just calm down for a second

He knows
He fucking knows
She's crazy
They're ghosts

They'd never trust someone like me
Stop simpering
Please
've got a picture of the two of us, do you remember that picture, Samir

And then 'm gonna send copies to some friends of mine on the West Bank

Hub jumps up, takes Sharon by the arm
Let go of me -- He gives her the '  out of the apartment, shuts the door, then turns back to Samir, who sits, ashen-faced

Samir is trembling
Tears roll down his cheeks
Don't be afraid

There's nothing to be afraid of

Finally: His name is Tariq Husseini

Too long

They're teetering on the edge of the abyss
Electric shock
The neurotransmitters just shut down
Water
Palestinian authority is producing good intel using water
Hub finally can't take another second
Even in theory
Are you people insane --
The time has come for one man to suffer in order to save the lives of hundreds How about two men
How about three
How about public executions, that might work
You're welcome to wait outside
General
you've lost men, 've lost men
but what you're doing
It doesn't work in Belfast
It doesn't work in Gaza
And it won't work here
(it comes slowly at first, then in a rush:) -- What if
they don't want their leader back at all
You said yourself, we don't even have him
Maybe what they really want -- is that we herd our children into stadiums
Put soldiers into our streets
Radicalize people who want to think of themselves as Americans
Bend the law, shred the constitution
(searches for the kind of words that come so hard to him:) Because if we torture him -- and let's call it what it is
You
and
then the country men like us have sworn to defend
And bled to defend
And died to defend
is gone
(a deep breath) And they've won
Gen
Devereaux stares hard at Hub
And then: (to Col
Hardwick) think we have to soundproof the room before we begin
Hub looks at Sharon, who looks away
Escort him out
The two MPs lead Hub out of the room
Let's get this over with
Sequence omitted from original script
: -- Sharon emerges from the shower room
She is shattered
The blood drained from her face
As if carrying with her all the sin that was committed in the next room
The sound of a
The door opens and Devereaux emerges, in the torment of a man of honor who is living a lie
He knew nothing
Devereaux turns and walks off down the corridor
Sequence omitted from original script
: Glorious, alabaster stone -- floodlit at night
symbol of all that is good and free and just
Hub drives a rental car, staring out at the monuments
Hub pulls up to a lovely
Parked on the street, an from the Secret Service
Opens the door, wearing a Dartmouth lacrosse team t-shirt
'mon in, we're still trying to get the last one down
In the background, we  a three-year-old crying
- Tasteful antiques, rag rugs and kids' toys
The President wants this shit over with
There's only one way to do that
(looks at Hub) Let the Sheik go
So we do have the Sheik
You think our government operates as a single coherent entity
Devereaux just
pushed the agenda
(carefully) Of course the President was completely unaware of it
(return of serve) Of course
Now we can't just let him go
America has to stand tall in the world yadda yadda yadda
So what we do is
(the punch line) We let the American justice system do its work
His wife appears, holding a squalling baby, looking defeated
-- Honey
'll be right up, darling
She grits her teeth and goes upstairs
You have kids
They're great
Sometimes you just want to
drug them
What do you mean, let the justice system do its work
We don't release him
judge releases him
You're an  man
That's what judges are good at, right
(off Hub's look) It's not like we've gone after him in proper prosectorial fashion
Kidnaping him
Holding him in isolation
"Fruit of the poisoned tree" -- remember that one from law school
Oh, we'll have a big trial
Everybody'll get their rocks off
But the fact is -- (the punch line) -- the sheik will walk
He looks at Hub, shakes his head
And this whole episode becomes nothing more than the news cycle before the next news cycle
He hands Hub an
Documentary evidence of Devereaux's whole operation
Why me
Because you'll know what to do with it
Hub looks at the file in his hands
Considering
And what about her
Who
You know who
How much is she complicit in all this
Ask her
Hub looks up
Sharon emerges from the hallway
Sequence omitted from original script
-- Hub and Sharon sit in silence in Hub's rental car: ran an Iraqi network for two years
Samir recruited them from among the Sheik's followers
trained them in the North
Then we played them back into Baghdad, two, three at a time, hiding them in the mosques
Her voice softens just a bit as memory takes over
It was gonna be beautiful
(looks away) -- And then there was a policy shift -- She thought telling the story would be easy, but there's an enormous well of untapped feeling
She fights it back: -- The new doctrine was: Iran will be too powerful if Iraq falls apart
(her voice trembles) And it's not like
we sold them out
Exactly
We just
stopped
helping them
And  wasn't allowed to tell them what was coming down was ordered not to tell them
(fighting back tears) -- And they got slaughtered
She turns away
You've got to understand -- these people
believe
Paradise
Bliss
To us they're just words
But to them
It's very beautiful, actually
And when you look at their lives, the heartbreak
And what do we do
We think, aha, we can take advantage of that
(losing it) So  quit
came home
just can't
do it
anymore
She doesn't want to reveal herself this way
Doesn't want to be vulnerable
Doesn't want to cling to him
For a moment He puts his arms around her, but it's like holding a beautiful, dangerous predator
-- But first, you helped them
She senses the hardness in his tone
Looks up at him, and through tears, puts her game face back on
What do you mean --
They were being slaughtered
They needed to get out
But they were on the watch list
So you got them visas
You and Samir
promised we would take care of them
They were working
for us
Doing what, exactly
don't know what you mean
You said you trained them
Tradecraft
Subversion
That's what you said, right
(she nods) Only you left something out, didn't you
Didn't you, Sharon
(she can't bring herself to look at him) You taught them how to make bombs
The tears are streaming down her face now
Finally, she nods
-- And now they're here, doing what you taught 'em
The streetlight catches Sharon's face
Her eyes are haunted
And 'm going to have to live with the hell of that for the rest of my life
: -- ( ) -- (
) -- the people of Brooklyn will not be held hostage
This afternoon, join community and religious leaders in a march to protest the mass arrests -- Sequence omitted from original script
: Sequence omitted from original script
-- (handing out leaflets) March on city hall
Today
No fear
Hub and Frank are standing outside Hub's car, each on opposite sides, blocking any opportunity to suveil what is happening within
Sharon sits inside with Samir
She uses a  to make the slightest  under Samir's arm
The  plays
Ahhhhhh
In case you decide to go on walkabout
Into the incision she inserts a tiny plastic
How did you make contact
He is Afghani
Ahhhh
He got word to my uncle at the bath-house
You never met him
But you're sure he'll show up
(trembling) Sharon, they are all dead but the last cell and they are crazy with fear
Just tell me the message and will pass it on
need to deliver it in person
Believe me, they'll want to hear what  have to say
She turns off the radio
Hub and Frank glance inconspicuously around
You watch the game
On a piece of paper he has scribbled, "Hit Hardwick
Safe House
11:00
" (nods yes, then:) Kannell was really on
Hub then writes
"Bath-house
12:00
" (nods again) Think they'll make the play-offs
Hub looks at him
There's been little time for sentiment
How's your boy
He's alright
Thanks for getting him out
Sharon steps out of the car
In her hands is a device resembling a
green dot appears
That's Samir
(looks in at Samir) Green is about right
He slips Sharon the scribbled notes
As she looks at them: He's terrified
Then again, so am
You sure he'll go through with it
If he doesn't he knows 'll give him to Devereaux
(She mouths, "They out there
" Hub nods) How's it feel to be on the other end of it
like watching better
This is the endgame, you understand that
If this goes wrong -- Nothing's going wrong
We're the , something always goes wrong
The car door opens and Samir steps out, buttoning his shirt
don't suppose there's any way you would trust me to do this on my own
(off his look) thought not
Well, in case it gets hairy, remember
the most committed wins
Hub watches as she and Samir walk away
trust her about as far as  can throw her
That far
-- They hurry through the park
Samir is extremely agitated, eyes constantly darting from right to left
This is not the way to the bath-house
You said to get a key from my uncle so that we -- Shhhhhh
If you'd stop whining you'd feel the surveillance
Colonel Hardwick, earphones on, overhearing them: (
) Wait for the light to turn yellow and then cross against the traffic
On Col
Hardwick's computer, a   of Brooklyn
-- North on Ditmas Avenue
Sound garden's ready
On a nearby rooftop, an Army spotter uses a parabolic with a gunsight
Another mic is in a woman's shopping bag; another is in a twenty year-old's boom box
(
) (trembling) Sharon, please,  beg you
Do not make me do this
If they even dream we are being followed they will kill us
The light turns , they race across a crowded street
Where women in chadors carry mesh bags with tonight's meal
Nothing but a single bed with a dirty white sheet
Sharon enters and turns on the
loud
Sit
(takes out a pocket- knife) Raise your arm
What are you doing
She cuts the stitches under his armpit and begins to dig out the transponder
They cannot even dream we are being followed, isn't that what you said
Sharon very deliberately wipes her   on the On , we  the  in front of Brooklyn Borough hall
"-- that we will not be made afraid to walk free in this great city say, march across the bridge and into the stadium
Demand the release of -- Samir is staring at the
It is all so
tragic
(with rising dread) They're going to hit the march
Arab and Jew, side by side
Black and White, Christian and Muslim -- They appear as  images on Hardwick's microwave screen
(
) -- so American
Can you imagine a better target
(into his handset) Get me Devereaux
: is getting fired up as the  exhorts them
watch uneasily, not certain how to respond as the crowd begins to , "No Fear
No fear
" Sequence omitted from original script
Sharon goes to a closet and takes out some old clothes
She Then: Here
Put this on
We don't want our friends sweating too much while they wait
Hardwick speaks into a handset
They're getting ready to move
Units 1 and 2, on my signal -- -- Seem to materialize out of nowhere -- boxing them in
What the -- Undercover   roust Army  agents
An  agent with a deep drawl, spread-eagles one against a building: Hi, there, 'm new in town
Can you direct me to Carnegie Hall, or should just go fuck myself -- The  under the command of Danny Sussman -- roll up the rest of the sound garden -- examine the parabolic microphones
Blow off the rear door of the surveillance van
Frank enters and looks around at all the high-tech, microwave technology
Ah, microwave
In chadors, faces , descend a back staircase
Only as their faces emerge from the shadows and are caught by a dim bulb do we recognize Sharon and Samir
Sharon unlocks a metal door to reveal of a neighboring building
She and Samir hurry through a back alley and out into an adjacent street
(   194) Where several 's suddenly roar up and  off the square
Devereaux stands nearby, watching as: #2 (though a bullhorn) This is an unlawful gathering
You must disperse
repeat -- Soldiers in full   emerge to form a battle line: images of Selma, 1963; Chicago, 1968; Los Angeles, 1993
Join together
Join hands
Arab clerics and Hassidic rabbis, Black civic leaders and Hispanic gang members -- all continue to , "No fear
" Nervously look at one another as the marchers begin to move
#2 (through a bullhorn) These soldiers carry live ammunition
This is your final warning
"No Fear
No Fear
" Devereaux watches in dread as the marchers close the gap on the battle-line of anxious soldiers is this why he became a soldier
unselfconsciously approaches a young soldier
Looks into his eyes
Smiles
And walks past
Another marcher walks right past a soldier, who does nothing to stop her
Soon, they are all surging past the riot-line
watches, as something is revealed to him, something about America that, until this moment, he had forgotten
Frank is fiddling with the new technology like a kid at Christmas
But something is wrong
Where once there were of Samir and Sharon in the apartment -- now there is
' The - of Samir's transmitter still registers as an unmoving, steadily blinking light
Hub is watching the building
Frank steps out the van, his face pale
We've got a problem
Pound up the stairs of the building
Bursts open
Hub comes in low and fast
Frank comes in hard on his heels
In the center of the otherwise empty room, the white sheet, , is draped over a chair
What the -- Hub stares in dread fascination
It's a shroud
And he's out the door in a heartbeat
Sequence omitted from original script
Frank and Hub listen to a playback of Sharon's conversation with Samir on the digital recorders
"
sweating too much while they wait
" Frank looks up at Hub
First she turns off the tv, then she says it
She knew we were listening
It hits them both at the same time
The hammam
Sequence omitted from original script
Hub and Frank hit the street at a dead run
Samir opens a padlocked door with a key
He and Sharon disappear within
An Arab bath-house
Rays of sunlight play off the steaming waters
Their footsteps  off the tiled mosaic walls
Sequence omitted from original script
Samir kneels to touch the steaming water
How soon are they coming
They'll be here
He starts taking off his clothes
What are you doing --
He finishes disrobing
He steps into the bath
With a sponge he washes his body
What message do you have for them, Sharon
'll tell them when they're here
The   of the approaching  echoes off the tiled walls as Samir steps out of the purifying waters and takes a towel from a hamper
Nobody else is coming, is there
That's right
From the hamper he takes a Sig-Sauer
9 automatic
You're the last cell
There will never be a last cell
(racks the slide of the
9) You should listen to the young men in that stadium
It is just beginning
Sharon watches, in dread fascination, as he takes a white egyptian-cotton   and drops it over his head
Are streaming down the street
Hub and Frank desperately fight their way through a wild, almost "carnival" feel
-- Reflected in the purifying waters, Samir is putting civilian clothes on over the shroud -- still holding the
9 on Sharon
How could  have missed the play -- (a forgiving gesture) It was the money
You believe money is power
Belief is power
-- Just tell me we didn't finance your operation
(a sad smile) The world is a wheel
So
what message do you have for me, Sharon
They're going to release him
Praise God
When will he be free --
few months at most
First, they have to bring him to trial, but -- He turns away from her, opening the hamper
(not looking at her) -- No
-- But
that's what you want, isn't it
Why you've done all this -- Comes next
Velcro straps fasten the belt around his chest
No
It's not
He comes to stand beside her
want you to bleed
as we have bled
Samir, the Koran preaches -- Do not speak to me of the Koran, woman
(fighting his emotion) You take our leader
holy man
You put him in prison for preaching the word of God
You must learn the consequences of trying to tell the world how to live
(with rising terror) But it's over, your point's been made, why spill any more blood
Those poor people out there in the street, they're fucking marching for your cause
Yes
(fastens the last strap on his semtex harness) And they, too, will become its martyrs
from the top of the stairs: (
) Let her go and you'll live
Samir looks up, sees Hub aiming his
45
But Sharon is between them, blocking his shot
From outside, we  the sound of the marchers' , "No Fear
No Fear
" Samir  it, too
Move away from the door
--
Let her go and you'll live -- ' --
(screaming, panicked) --
--
--
They're all  at once
Still Samir keeps inching toward the stairs
Hub blocks the way
No way you're going out there
Samir jams the gun into Sharon's ribs
--
Sharon's eyes meet Hubs'
Shoot
Shut up
Shoot
Samir is edging ever closer
Starting up the stairs
Sharon's eyes plead with Hub, begging for a kind of unholy redemption
--
' --
(weeping now) You
promised
Hub's finger tightens on the trigger
But then slowly, almost imperceptibly at first, he lowers his gun
(sobbing) No --
It is God's will
His left hand moves imperceptibly toward the  of the explosive device
If there is a God, he weeps at the crimes we commit in his name
Rips through Sharon into Samir, blowing them both backwards
Is to Samir's hand as it reaches for the ripcord
Is a killing headshot
Rolling him into the baths
Blooms in the cleansing water
The funeral shroud billows
Still rings in the tiled room as Hub kneels beside Sharon
(on radio) Officer down
--
Is
he
dead
Shhhhhhh
(whispers) no
regrets
Hub cradles her head
You
knew
(the saddest smile) wondered
Appears at the top of the steps
Behind him, two race down to kneel beside Sharon
Hub is pushed aside as they begin triage -- but it doesn't look good as suddenly, she begins to convulse
Sharon
-- Emma
My name
is Emma
And then she begins to mumble, at first incoherently, and then more clearly
We realize she's speaking Arabic
-- what are you
don't
And then Frank is standing above them
Tears in his eyes
(translating) "
seek refuge
king of kings
" And Hub suddenly understands: she is preparing for her own death
He holds her as she continues to pray in and out of her two native tongues
Until, at last: / (whispers) Allah Ahkbar
God is great -- Allah Ahkbar -- Amen
And she's gone
-- block away, we can see the Marchers pass by
The chant of "No Fear
" fades into the distance
But Hub has already turned his back and is hurrying away
: -- Hub hurries toward the Courthouse
- opens the door
He is taken aback by the blood on Hub's clothes
want to talk about a free society
: Where Devereaux is watching coverage of the march
(
) -- "a very moving moment in which the people of a city step forward to declare their courage and solidarity -- He looks up to see Hub
He's carrying the that the Chief of Staff gave him
Agent Hubbard, do you want to tell me exactly what you mean detaining Colonel Hardwick and six of my staff
Because that strikes me as a very peculiar idea of interagency liaison
The last cell has been taken down
It was Samir
took him out
What makes you so sure he was the last cell
Sharon
Sharon is not trustworthy
Sharon is dead
She gave her life
(takes a piece of paper from his pocket) This is a writ from the  District Court releasing all those being held here without habeus corpus
My authority supersedes the civilian judiciary under the decree of martial law
(a rueful smile) Sorry
Your authority ends now
It's all over
What's over
(looks at him) They're going to release him
Release him
The Sheik
(holds up the Chief of Staff's' file) Clear violation of international law, Congressional oversight statutes, a couple of treaties, the Federal perjury statute, and my favorite, the Logan Act, for conducting your own personal foreign policy
(simply) know the whole story, General
You don't know shit
Poor suffering Sharon and her poor suffering people
It's called "going native" -- the most elementary error of an intelligence operative and she made it
She had all of you working for her and she was working for them without even knowing it
And now they're getting exactly what they want, which is the Sheik will be back in the mix
But ten times as strong, because now he's the big man who stood up to the Americans
(looks at Hub) did what was necessary
make no apologies
If you think you're going to be able to use that file against me, you know even less about politics than  imagined
General
'm not in politics
You can have this back
won't use it
Hub hands him the file
Devereaux takes it
Because you don't have the balls
(off Hub's look) Did you expect me to get all weepy with gratitude
You serve your country
(dismissively) Is there anything else
Hub would love to just
clock him
Instead: said  wasn't in politics
'm not
'm in law enforcement
He takes his gun from its shoulder holster
William Devereaux, you are under arrest for the torture and murder of Tariq Husseini under color of authority, United States Code Title 42, Chapter 21, Subchapter 1, Sections 1983
(takes out his gun) Surrender your weapon
Behind them, a  as Frank and several agents force their way into the room, followed by , who shout questions as  and  record the arrest
An  car -- Devereaux within, pulls away, lights flashing
Emerge from tunnel and into the waiting arms of their mothers, the tearful smiles of their wives and children
Hub and Frank stand there, watching the reunions
(after a moment) Did we win or did we lose --
Hub has no answer
No one has the answer
