The Captain is new -- and unexpected
is young and beautiful
She is half Vulcan and half Romulan
In appearance she is Vulcan with pointed ears, but her skin is fair and she has none of the expressionless facial immobility of a Vulcan

' () Main energizer hit, Captain
Engage auxiliary power
Prepare to return fire
The bridge takes another hit -- a big one
In its wake there is a second electrical  along the communi- cations panel
Uhura falls from her station
Bones rushes to her side amid the smoke and alarms
Shields collapsing, Captain
' () Captain, we're losing auxiliary power
Fire all phasers
No power to the weapons system, sir
Another hit: reverberating flashes of spark and flame on the bridge
Spock dies
Bones comes to him, but even as he coughs his way through the smoke, a final hit and Bones falls
The room is smoke filled and a shambles
Saavik looks about in shock
' () Captain, it's no use
We're dead in space
Saavik digests this for a painful moment
Then, touch- ing a comm button: Activate escape pods
Send out the Log Buoy
All hands abandon ship

There is a loud  and  -- 4     -                                  4 The side walls of the "bridge" slide apart, revealing a lighted room beyond
Through the opening strides He stops, surveys the shambles, and shakes his head
Any suggestions, Admiral

Saavik
The Klingons do not take prisoners

Trainees to the briefing room
Sulu awakens with a grin
Uhura straightens herself demurely
The Trainees head toward the distant room, Spock rises and leaves
Bones remains on the floor, head propped in his hand, whimsically
Physician, heal thyself
That's all you have to say
'm not a drama critic
Bones rolls his eyes and rises
Kirk sees Saavik who has not moved
(continuing) Well, Mr
Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship
Permission to speak candidly, sir
Very well
(fights emotion) don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities
And why not
Because
there was no way to win
no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face
Has that never occurred to you
No, sir
It has not
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say
(falters) As  indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me
Then you have something new to think about
Carry on
She stays at attention
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship
They'll learn
Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor
He leaves
They look at each other

(dry) Aren't you dead
Spock almost smiles
(continuing) assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating plan to give your cadets
am understandably curious
They walk together
They destroyed the simulator room and you with it
The Kobayshi Maru scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment
(dry) As  recall you took the test three times yourself
Your final solution was, shall we say, unique
(solemn) It had the virtue of never having been tried
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality
So you said at the time
Speaking of which, your protg's first rare -- a trifle emotional -- She's half Romulan, Jim
The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example
Than you
Yes,  see that
By the way, thank you for this
He lifts the book

(reads) 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
' Message, Spock
None of which  am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times
Kirk looks around uncomfortably, overlaps: Hrummm
and where are you off to, now
The Enterprise
must check in before your inspection
And you
(shortly) Home
Spock studies him -- Something oppresses you
They are old friends -- Something
He steps into a turbo elevator
The doors close as Spock watches, wiping the scene

Don't tell me you've got something

Are you sure

' ,  -                         11 Kirk reads the novel, trying to focus
His flat befits an Admiral and a loner with few possessions, except a collection of antiques
Startled, Kirk lowers the book and pushes a button
Come
The door slides open and Bones enters
He carries two packages, one of them wrapped in brown paper
(continuing) Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods
'Beware Romulans bearing gifts
' Happy Birthday
With a flourish, he pulls out a bottle of blue liquid
Romulan Ale
Bones, you know this stuff is illegal -- (broad) only use it for medicinal purposes
Don't be a pring
(reading the label with difficulty) Twenty-two, eighty-three
Takes the stuff a while to ferment
Gimme
He takes the bottle and pours; continues talking
(continuing) Now open the other one
Kirk starts to obey
'm almost afraid to
What did you bring me, contraband Klingon -- More antiques for your collection -- Cheers
They drink
The package is opened: a pair of gold "Ben Franklin" half-glasses
(
: Romulan Ale is an  : both men react
) Cheers
Bones, these are
charming
Four hundred years old
You don't find many with the lens still intact
Uh -- what are they
For your eyes
For most patients of your age,  generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens
But 'm allergic to Retlax
Exactly
Happy birthday
He toasts
Kirk is unsure how they work
(continuing) Slide them down your nose
Now look at me over the top
And you read printed matter through the bottom
(reacts) Amazing
don't know what to say -- Say thank you
Thank you
An awkward silence
Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter
Other people have birthdays
Why're we treating yours like a funeral
Bones,  don't want to be lectured
What  you want
Damn it, why isn't there a girl here
You know this has nothing to do with age
This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies
Spare me your notions of poetry, please
We all have our assigned duties and
Bull
You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations -- And who am  hiding from
From yourself, Admiral
Pause
Kirk pours another drink
Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think

Get back your command
Get it back before you really do grow old

As Chekov moves up, we rise with him to the top of the ridge and look down

They look at each other in consternation
Chekov is worried; something about all this is familiar
They descend towards the structures, now seen to be the wreckage of some sort of space craft
They pass but do not notice the  , half buried next to their feet
They look like cargo carriers
As Chekov looks at the porthole, a face suddenly looks back
It is the face of a
The Apparition scares the daylights out of Chekov -- and us
He screams

He comes clumsily over -- face

The porthole is empty
You're crazy --
saw it --
There's an air-lock
He points and they go into the airlock

Someone lives here -- there are beds, food, all jury- rigged -- but no people
Terrell checks a monitor
There's breathable atmosphere in here
He takes off his helmet; Chekov likewise
(continuing) What the hell is this
Did they crash
Where's the rest of the ship
They wander as they talk, picking up objects that be- speak a fairly sophisticated ad hoc environment: a laboratory in one hold; a kitchen; filled with disgusting

They seem to be waiting
One of the men is
Out of the airlock steps a tall masked figure moment of suspense as Terrell and Chekov watch, terri- fied
The mask is peeled back
(aloud despite himself) Khan
is startled by the recognition; comes over and examines Chekov and Terrell
(finally) don't know you
But you
never forget a face
Mister Chekov, isn't it
(wonderingly) never thought to see your face again
Chekov, who is this man
criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering -- What do you want with us
demand -- (mild) You are in a position to demand nothing, sir
, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing
What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the Botany Bay , marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James
Kirk
Listen to me -- you men and women -- Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born
Do you mean he
(i
e
Chekov) never told you the tale
To amuse you, Captain
Never told you how the Enterprise picked up the Botany Bay , lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze
've never even met Admiral Kirk -- Admiral
He didn't tell you how Admiral Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us
You lie
On Ceti Alpha  there was life, a fair chance to -- This is Ceti Alpha Ceti Alpha exploded six months after we were left here
The shock shifted the orbit of this planet and everything was laid waste
Admiral Kirk never bothered to check on our progress
It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive
On earth, two hundred years ago,  was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails
Captain Kirk was your host
You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him
(moves closer) And 'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile
And see how Admiral Kirk requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth
The wind howls in the silence
When Khan turns, his eyes are filled with tears
(continuing) plague upon you all
He recovers his poise and returns to them -- (continuing) You didn't expect to find me
You thought this was Ceti Alpha
Why are you here
They don't answer
Khan goes over to Terrell and, ,      -- (continuing) Why
Terrell gasps, stays silent -- (continuing) No matter
He lets go; Terrell falls with a thud -- (continuing) You will soon tell me willingly enough
He goes over to the tank and dips a kind of strainer in, pulling out    -- wriggling items -- (continuing) Let me introduce you to Ceti Alpha 's only remaining indigenous life form; what do you think
They've killed twenty of my people, including my beloved wife
Oh, not all at once and not instantly, to be sure
Their young enter through the ears and wrap themselves around the cerebral cortex
This has the effect of rendering the victim extremely susceptible to suggestion
Later, as they grow, follows madness, paralysis -- and death
These are pets, of course -- not quite domesticated
As he speaks, Khan dumps an eel in each of their helmets; he swirls the helmets around as though he were mixing martinis -- Khan, listen to me
Captain Kirk was only doing his duty
You -- 26     -  -                                   26 There is some pain at first,  am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end
That was what  learned from watching my wife
At a sign, the helmets are slammed down
As the muffled shrieks are heard from within, the eels crawl across the faces of Chekov and Terrell; with unerring in- stincts they head for the ears of the two hapless men
There is some atrocious pain as they enter -- then dazed calm
(continuing) That's better
Now: tell me why you are here -- and tell me where may find James Kirk

Welcome aboard, Admiral

Your first training voyage, Mr
Preston
Yes,

Well, shall we start with the engine room
He moves, followed by his staff
(eyeing his protg) believe you'll find all in order -- We'll see you on the bridge, Admiral
Very good, Mr
Spock
Kirk and party leave He's not what  expected, Sir
What did you expect, Lieutenant
(uncertain) He's very human
We can't all be perfect, Saavik
You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land
Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence
You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else  have taught you
Tolerance is logical
Saavik is humbled
As always, my mentor

(blurting) believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral
(sternly puts him on) Oh do you
Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times 've had to listen to Mr
Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles
Have you any idea the ribbing 've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap
(scandalized) Oh, no, sir
This is the finest engine room in the whole Star -- The repressed grins of the others, and a smile on Scotty's face tell Preston he's being had
He stops, confused
(continuing) If the Admiral can't see the facts for himself, then, with all due respect, he's as blind as a Tiberion bat
Approving laughter
Kirk looks amused
Midshipman, you're a tiger
My sister's youngest, Admiral
Crazy to get to space
Every young boy's fancy
seem to remember it myself
(brisk) Very well
Mr
Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise
Give the word, Admiral
Mr
Scott, the word is given
Aye, sir
He moves off, followed by Preston, who gives one last salute as Kirk leaves, followed by Bones

The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor
They step into the Turbo Lifts

Saavik
Spock casts a glance at Kirk, then, to Saavik: (continuing) Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock
Never, sir
Kirk tries to conceal his reaction
Spock enjoys it
Take her out, Mr
Saavik
Aye, sir
Saavik settles herself in the chair, looks again at the console -- Spock looks at Kirk
There's a first time for everything, Admiral

At the helm is Joachim, Khan's lieutenant
He is in the largest and brightest of Khan's group
Terrell sits in the First Officer's chair, Chekov at the Comm Console
Their behavior is normal, save for subtle hesitation, symptoms of their mind-controlled state
Steady on course
All systems normal
It's not much different from Enterprise
(beat) When  was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals
And now, Mr
Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis'
Beyond what  told you, sir, it is classified information
Umm
And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information
would think so, sir
He's on the Fleet General Staff
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula
(thinks) see
Helmsman
Aye, sir
May  speak
We're all with you, sir, but consider: we are free, we have a ship and the means to go where we will
We have escaped permanent exile on Ceti Alpha
You have proved your superior intellect and defeated the plans of Admiral Kirk
You do not need to defeat him again
He tasks me -- and 'll have him
'll chase him round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition's flames before  give him up

They are all young and earnest
Carol and David huddle over a computer console

don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks
Next time, we'll design a bigger one

Carol moves forward as the others close in
On the screen, please, Jedda
Buttons punched; the screen ebbs, flows and crackles on

This is Reliant -- Commander, we are receiving
This is Regula
Go ahead
Dr
Marcus
good
We're en route to you and should be there in three days
En route
Why
We weren't expecting you for another three months
Has something happened

(fractional pause) All went well
Nothing has happened
Ceti Alpha  has checked out
Pleased reaction from the scientists
still don't under -- We have received new orders
Upon our arrival at Regula , all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha
Consternation in the lab
David is livid -- the words "Bullshit" are overlapped  by his mother
Will you please be quiet (back to console) Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular
Who gave the order you are quoting
Who gave the order
(still smiling) The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr
Marcus, direct from the General Staff
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control -- have my orders
Pin him down, mother
Who gave the orders
Chekov hesitates, seems to be listening to someone off the monitor
The orders come from Admiral James Kirk
Sensation in the lab
knew it
knew it
All along the military has wanted to get their hands on this -- He starts to press a button; Carol pushes his hand away and communicates herself
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov
have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials
(pauses; listens) 'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor
Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed
Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival
Reliant out
The image fades
Commander Chekov --

48 Chekov, in a matched cut, turns away as by his side
He is charming
Well done, Commander
You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order
Khan smiles, more charming than ever as we move in
49
49 Everyone is talking at once
Will you please be quiet
We must have order here
(as they subside) This has to be some sort of mistake
Mistake
We're all alone here
They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this
Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa
It seems clear that Starfleet never intended that -- know, but -- 've tried to warn you
Scientists are always pawns of the military -- (angry) Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years,  cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event
Silence
(Deltan cool) You may be right, Doctor, but what about Reliant
She's on her way
Carol reacts: this is certainly true
Get your gear together where it's handy
Where are we going
That's for us to know and Reliant to find out
We have only three days
Let's not waste time
They split off in different directions as ordered

As he gets in -- ' Hold please --
Kirk holds and Saavik dashes in

Kirk nods, the doors close
There is an uneasy forced intimacy between them
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently
It is still regulation, Admiral
She reaches out and touches a button
The lift stops

Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems
wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating
You earned it
did not think so
You're bothered by your performance on the Kobayashi Maru failed to resolve the situation
There is no correct resolution
It is a test of character
May  ask how you dealt with the test
(amused) You may ask, Lieutenant
She stares
(continuing) That was a little joke
Humor
that is a difficult concept it is not logical
We learn by doing, Lieutenant
She's a laugh a minute
Kirk pushes the button; the elevator starts
(continuing) You want my advice
She studies him, considering
No doubt about it, the attraction is mutual and she has no idea how to handle it
Yes
Take the test again
The lift stops and the doors open
Who's been holding up the damn elevator
He reacts to them
Saavik exits demurely
Thank you, sir
Bones enters and the doors close
Kirk studies the ceiling
Has she changed her hairstyle
Kirk says nothing

Stop engines
They look wonderingly
Kirk takes a breath -- An emergency situation has arisen
By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours,  am assuming command of this vessel
Duty officer so note in the ship's log
Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula

Scott
' Aye, sir
We'll be going to warp speed -- ' Aye, sir -- (overlapping) Course plotted for Regula , Admiral

Sulu, go to Warp 5

Spock looks up
We've got a problem
Spock raises an eyebrow -- (continuing) Something may be wrong at Regula We've been ordered to investigate
Regula  is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves
told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant
Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they
How will they respond under real pressure
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts
The ship is yours
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula
Excuse my presumption, but  do not agree
As a teacher on a training mission,  am content to command a Starship
If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command
But it may be nothing; garbled communications
Why don't you
You proceed from a false assumption
am a Vulcan
have no ego to bruise
Kirk smiles in bemused wonderment
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions
was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well
(pause) Your mistake, if  may be so bold, was promotion
Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny
Anything else is a waste of material
would not presume to debate you
That is wise
In any case, were to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few
Or the one
Spock inclines his head
You are my superior officer
You are also my friend
have been and always shall be yours
Kirk is moved
He starts to speak, can't -- finally: Will you accompany me to the bridge
'd best talk with Mr
Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets
Kirk's face tells us the wisdom of Spock's choice

There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond

What in God's name does that mean

What exactly  Genesis
Put simply, Genesis is a procedure whereby the molecular structure of any given matter can be restructured -- changed -- into anything else of identical mass
(   ,  ) Fascinating
Wait -- Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory
Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale
What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three
Please watch closely

67                                                  67 -- Unleashing, almost instantan- eously, what we call the Genesis effect
Particulate matter is reorganized and electrified -- with life introduced results
Instead of a dead moon, a living breathing planet, capable of sus- taining whatever life forms we see fit to deposit on it
The reformed object you see represents the merest fraction of the Genesis potential, should the Federation wish to pursue these experiments to their logical conclusion
67A                                              67A When we consider the problems of population and food supply, the usefulness of this process begins to become clear
This concludes this demonstration tape
Thank you for your attention
The Genesis team eagerly awaits the decision of the Federation regarding the next phase of our work
The tape becomes snowy and blinks off
Kirk looks at Bones and Spock -- they are stunned
It literally is Genesis
The power of creation -- Have they proceeded with their experiments
The tape was made a year ago can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now -- But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix -- It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying

As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create -- Not anymore
Now you can do both at the same time
According to myth, the earth was created in six days
Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes -- don't dispute that in the wrong hands -- Would you like to tell me whose are the right hands, my cold-blooded friend
Are you in favor of these experiments
Gentlemen, this isn't -- Really, Dr
McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn
Logic suggests -- Logic

Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control -- Give me some time to recall the data on our computers -- give you sixty seconds, Admiral

All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code

Spock nods; Kirk turns to the screen -- (continuing) Khan, how do  know you'll keep your word
(on screen) 've given you no word to keep, Admiral
In my judgment, you simply have no alternative
take your point
Stand by to receive our transmission
He turns from the screen again, softly: (continuing) Mr

105                                           105 making a final adjustment
Hit your blowers
and a great wind of suction pulls the gas towards appropriate vents
The Crew Chief watches, then yanks off his respirator; wipes his brow
106
106 Kirk enters and them; he has a word or two for men he doesn't know by name
Kirk leads us to the operating theatre, where Bones works over Preston
Scotty stands by, his lips trembling
Preston opens his eyes, sees Scotty and Kirk
(faint) Is the word given
(soft) The word is given: warp speed
(almost smiles) Aye
He dies
Pause
Scotty looks across the body at Kirk
(looks at Preston) He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance
Scotty, 'm sorry
He stayed at his post
When the trainees ran, he stayed
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now
' Admiral, this is Spock
Kirk hits a wall intercom -- Yes, Spock
' Engine room reports auxiliary power restored
We can proceed at impulse power
(thinks) Best speed to Regula
Kirk out
Scotty, 've got to ask: Any chance of getting the mains back on the line
dinna think so, sir, but you'll have my best -- With an effort, he gets to his feet -- (continuing) Thanks --  know you tried, Doctor
Squeezes his shoulder and limps off -- We the sound of impulse power taking effect
Are you all right
Bones shrugs unhappily, looks at Preston
Doctors lose patients sometimes
Damn
'm still in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it
You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe
There may still be time
you gave as good as you got
(looks him in the eye) got beat
We're only alive because knew something about these ships that he didn't
He turns and leaves as Bones watches, looks again at Preston

Our ears cannot place it

Sensors, Captain
Scanners and sensors still inoperative
There's no way to tell what's  inside the station
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area
Affirmative, Admiral
(with irony) Blind as a Tiberian Bat
What do you make of the plantoid beyond

It consists of various remarkable ores
Essentially, a great rock in space
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock

Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters
' Just barely, sir

He starts out
Bones stops him
Khan could be down there
He's  there and hasn't found what he wants
Can you spare someone
There may be people hurt

Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort
' There is no such regulation
Saavik's gaze falters -- (continuing) All right, join the party
Mr
Spock, the ship is yours
Aye sir -- Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr
Scott
Be careful, Jim
Kirk, Bones and Saavik head for the turbo doors
112
-                           112 now
The silence is ominous

They separate
Each begins to search

We want him to go back
Bones reacts with brave apprehension
Rounding a corner, he starts:   scuttles right in front of him
Bones sighs with relief and moves forward
We think he's safe
: an upside down human
116     -                                         116 Kirk helps Bones cut down the last of the five from where they were hanged, upside down
Having recovered his composure, Bones examines the corpses
We  Madison, March, among others
One is clearly the
(stunned) They even killed the galley chief
This one looks like a Steward
They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in
This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim
Kirk looks around, despairingly -- Carol
117
117 working with console
Something puzzles her
She frowns, but a   distracts her
She looks up and moves off
118     -                                        118 moan is heard
All three now converge on the area
As they near it, Saavik's tricorder hums furiously
Be this a room, a locker of some other place, this time they -- "open the door
" The limp bodies of Chekov and Terrell fall out
' (on screen) Admiral Kirk, Enterprise
Come in, please
Come in please
She will continue sporadically
My God
Chekov emits a live, reassuring moan
That's Clark Terrell, Jim, 've served with him
Bones is passing his medical tricorder over Chekov
(continuing) Brain disturbance
Appears to be drug induced
He reaches into his kit
He shoots Chekov moves off to Terrell

This is Enterprise

Please -- Saavik's face appears on her screen
(on screen, hurried) Commander Uhura, this is Lt
Saavik
We're all right
Please stand by
Out
(baffled) Aye, aye
120
-                             120 Chekov opens his eyes, and stares into Kirk's
Oh, God, Admiral
He weeps like a child, and Kirk holds him
Meanwhile, Terrell opens his eyes and stares at Bones
It's Dr
McCoy, Captain
Do you remember me
McCoy
Yes
Oh, yes
121                                    121 Chekov breaks the embrace in high relief and anxiety
Oh, sir
It was Khan
We found him on Ceti Alpha
Easy, Pavel
Tell me what you can
No life signs -- but he was there
Captured us
He -- he put creatures in our bodies
To control our minds
Bones takes over Chekov -- It's all right, you're safe
Made us say -- lies
Do
things
But we beat him
The Captain and me
-- He thought he controlled us, but he didn't
The Captain was strong
Chekov breaks into tears
Kirk looks at Terrell, who is more composed
Captain
Where is Dr
Marcus
Where are the Genesis materials
He couldn't find them
Some of the scientists were still here, but everything else, even the data banks -- were empty
That's true, Admiral
All the memory cells have been emptied
(ponders) Erased
He tortured those people
None of them would tell him anything
He went wild, strung them up and slit their throats
He wanted to tear the place apart, but he was late: he had to get back to Reliant in time to blow you to bits
He came damn close
He left us
(with irony) We were no longer of use
Where is  the Reliant crew
Dead
Marooned on Ceti Alpha
He's completely mad, Admiral
He blames you for the death of his wife
know what he blames me for
(thinks) The escape pods are all in place
(looks around) Where's the transporter room
122
122 Kirk, wearing his spectacles, studies the transporter consoles
the transporter pods, and the others, b
g
Did he make it down here
Chekov and Terrell look at each other; they seem a bit stronger
It was not my impression
He spent most of his time trying to wring the information out of the people
Saavik approaches Kirk: Anything
Kirk looks at her over the rims of the glasses: Somebody left the unit on
If everyone else was dead, it implies that no one remained to turn it off
Those people back there bought escape time for Genesis with their lives
Saavik studies the console
It doesn't make sense
These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless
(wheels turn) If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground
Stage Two of what
Kirk gets it
(on communicator) Kirk to Enterprise
Damage report, Spock
' Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days
(beat) read you, Captain
Let's have it
Fractional pause
' The situation is grave, Admiral
We won't have main power for six days at least
Auxiliary power has temporarily failed, but maybe we can restore that in two days By the book, Admiral
Kirk frowns
Meaning you can't even beam us back
' Not at present
Kirk looks at Saavik and Bones, decides -- Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within one hour your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range
' Sir -- we won't leave you behind
Uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind
Kirk out
(to Terrell and Chekov) You gentleman can remain here, or
If it's all the same, Admiral, we'd like to share the risk
(hesitates) Very well
Let's go
Go
Where are we going
(points to console) Where they went
Saavik
Kirk walks onto the pods as Saavik works the console, rolling in electronic coding
The others join Kirk
But what if they went -- nowhere
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all
Ready
She presses a button, joins them on the pods
Slowly they
123
-                              123 it as the   continues, with irregularity
The plantoid is ugly and dead
The sound frightens us, and climaxes with: 124
-                                  124 The   screeches, then settles into its comfort- able mode as the   , , then They look around in wonder and relief
Admiral -- She indicates something
They cross as reveals a cave wall stacked with technical materials and crowned by a  , a giant version of the model we saw earlier
They stare
( ) Genesis,  presume
They walk by a group of crates
It all happens very fast: David leaps out and tackles Kirk, throwing him to the ground and landing atop him, a knife at his throat
At the same time, Bones and Saavik reach for their phasers, but Jedda, already armed, steps out
He has them covered and helpless
125                                            125 You're the sonavabitch who committed mass murder up there
He raises the knife -- 'm Admiral Kirk
We were still there , you dumb bastard
We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room -- Again he raises the knife -- Where's Dr
Marcus -- 'm Doctor Marcus
Carol reaches the tunnel entrance to the cave -- David -- Mother, go back
Carol sees Kirk -- Jim -- Go back
'm going to kill him
(takes a breath) You do that and you'll have murdered your father
All react
David and Kirk, facing each other, are turned to stone
Bones, Jedda and Chekov turn to look at Carol, wondering
Terrell very casually takes the phaser from Jedda
126     (  134)                             126 (cool) 'll hold onto this
But Kirk and Carol ignore them and walk towards each other
There are tears in Carol's eyes
She reaches up, trying to smile and touches his hair -- You've got a little grey -- She can't
Kirk takes her and holds her tightly, look- ing at David, over her shoulder
He stands there, stunned, looking back
Carol
Is that true
She nods -- (continuing) Why didn't you tell me
She's making it up
My father was Professor -- David, you're just making this harder -- 'm afraid it's even harder than you think, Doctor
He and Chekov have their phasers trained on them
(continuing) Please don't move -- Chekov --
'm sorry, Admiral
Terrell speaks into his wrist recorder
Your excellency, have you been listening
' (filtered) have indeed, Captain
You have done well
knew it --
David makes a reckless break for Terrell; Saavik instantly throws herself on him bringing him down as Terrell fires, hitting Jedda, who was behind David -- a killing ray
Jedda dematerializes
Carol and David reacts with horror and guilt
Most importantly, Chekov begins to tremble
Terrell himself is shaken by his reflexive action
He's in semi-panic
Don't move -- any of you
127                                                              127 thru                                                             thru 134                                                              134 135

-                          136 Joachim over his shoulder
Others in evidence
Khan speaks into his console
Captain
We're waiting
What's the delay
137
(  )                    137 All is well, sir
You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis
First things first, Captain
Kill Admiral Kirk
Reactions by all -- only Kirk and Bones are unsurprised
David and Saavik, dazed, fight the urge to do something
Chekov is close to a seizure
Terrell fights conflicting mental signals
Excellency
it is difficult
try to obey, but -- ' Kill him As though tearing off a leach, Terrell grabs at the wrist recorder and flings it to the ground
shock- wave of pain hits Terrell
He recovers, trembling and tries to obey
Chekov is shaking badly
Terrell aims his phaser at Kirk
Chekov slowly raises his phaser and aims at Terrell, though his hands are like lead
We  Chekov is going to do the right thing
Then, shockingly: Terrell turns his phaser on himself
' (still emanates from wrist recorder) Kill him, Terrell
Now
Terrell does, blowing himself into oblivion
138    -                                      138 He , horribly, drops his phaser, clutching his head
Bones leaps to his side, pulls an injection device from his belt pack, jabs it into Chekov's arm
Chekov, almost with a sigh of relief, drops
' Terrell
Chekov --
Jim -- for God's sake
They rush to his side, as do Carol and David
139    -                                      139 From the fallen man's ear, something begins to emerge
140     - '                                   140 The Ceti eel crawls out
It has grown quite large
141                                                         141 Horror from all
Kirk picks up a phaser
As the eel clears Chekov, he fires and destroys it
He shudders, then sees the wrist recorder and grabs it
Khan, you bloodsucker, they're finished
You'll have to do your own dirty work now
Do you hear me
Do you 142
142 Khan reacts to Kirk's : electronic shock
He clutches the communicator, his eye-whites rolling
Kirk
Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend
143     -                                 143 Still, 'old friend
' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target
(ironic) Perhaps  no longer need to try
He punches several buttons
In the Rocky Cavern the transporter beam locks on to the Genesis torpedo and its arming control box
As Kirk and the others watch, horrified, Khan beams up the materials
David tries to reach the torpedo, but Saavik holds him fast -- Let go -- he can't --
Only half of you would get there
The beam disappears and Genesis with it, leaving them alone
(desperate) Khan, you have Genesis, but you don't have me
You were going to kill me, Khan, it was your sole purpose
You'll have to come down here to do it
You'll have to come down
' 've done far worse than kill you, Admiral
've hurt you
And wish to go on hurting you shall leave you, as you left me -- where no one will ever find you: poetic justice; marooned for eternity in the center of a dead planet -- buried alive
Khan --
Goodbye, Admiral
Oh, and don't count on Enterprise
She can't move
My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens
144                                                       144 145
145 Khan closes his eyes in voluptuous satisfaction
Joachim enters and Khan looks at him
Well
Warp drive still inoperative
All other systems should be restored shortly
Khan sighs, contentedly
Excellent
We have all the time in the world
146
146 As before, Saavik is on the communicator
This is Lt
Saavik, calling Enterprise
She keeps trying
Chekov stirs -- He's alive
Bones goes and tends Chekov who moans, tries to sit up
Pavel
Chekov tries to smile; Kirk takes his hand -- No use, Admiral, they're still jamming all channels
(looks across Chekov) It wouldn't make any difference
If Enterprise obeyed orders she's long since gone
And if she couldn't obey, she's finished
So are we, it looks like
don't understand
Who's responsible for all this
Who is Khan
It's a long story
We appear to have plenty of time
(dry) You and your father can catch up on things
(bitter) My father
hope you realize another man has just been killed because of
Because of you, son
You shouldn't have tried to rush someone holding a primed phaser
Anyway it isn't one man dead, it's two, in case you've lost count
David has been effectively spiked
Long silence
Do you have anything to eat don't know about anyone else, but 'm starved
How can you think of food at a time like this
Our first order of business is survival
There's food in the Genesis cave, enough to last a lifetime -- should that be necessary
We thought this was Genesis
Carol laughs -- there's an edge of hysteria to it
This
It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this
What we did in there -- we did in a day
David, why don't you show Dr
McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food
But we can't just sit here --
(unruffled) Oh, yes we can
Is there really something to eat
David looks at his father, who checks his watch, putting on his spectacles
David
Please
(to Kirk) This is just to give us something to do, isn't it
(he shrugs) Come on
Saavik and Bones make to follow
Saavik turns to Kirk -- Admiral
As your teacher Mr
Spock is fond of saying:  like to think there always are possibilities
147                                                       147 thru                                                             thru 149                                                              149 150
150 Dark side of Gamma
Reliant sits idle
150A
150A Carol sits on the ground, Chekov's head in her lap, looking at Kirk
David was right, wasn't he
It's just to keep them busy
Why
Why didn't you tell me
How can you ask me that
Were we together
Where we going to be
You had your world and  had mine
wanted him in mine, not chasing through the universe with his father
Kirk turns away, overcome
She watches him
(continuing) He's a lot like you in many ways
Nothing  could do about it
He's smarter, of course; that goes without saying
Most of Genesis is really his
Her joke doesn't take effect
He doesn't turn
(continuing) This is it, isn't it
We're never going to get out of here
Kirk says nothing
(continuing) Please
Tell me what you're feeling
Kirk hesitates, comes back and sits next to Chekov; he changes Bones' compress on the ear as he finally speaks
There's a man  haven't seen in fifteen years who thinks he's killed me
You show me a son who'd almost be happy to help him
My son
My life that could have been and wasn't
What am  feeling
'm feeling old -- worn out
Carol studies him; gently she sets Chekov's head down on a sweater, then stands
Let me show you something that will make you feel young -- young as when the world was new
She offers her hand
Kirk looks at Chekov, who smiles, faint assurance
(continuing) He'll be all right
Come
After a moment's hesitation, Kirk takes her hand and she leads him to the tunnel
150B
150B Carol and Kirk
rising light falls on their faces as they walk, then run with excitement toward the source
Kirk races ahead
150C   '  -                        150C toward an iridescent light at its end, blindingly beautiful with color
:    until for Kirk to reach the end of the tunnel, and then, when it does: 150D
-                        150D where the rock tunnel ends
Kirk comes out of the tunnel, and his mouth drops open
150E     -    (  ) (     150E 130) huge cavern
Kirk is actually standing at the middle of it
Space extends vastly above and below his point of view
Like Eden, lush growth everywhere, water- falls, and a cobalt blue sky high, high above where a round orb glows sending light and warmth downward
There is a path from where Kirk stands down to the lower level where Bones, and the others are waiting and calling to him
Mist and haze waft gently across the cavern
150F                                                   150F as Carol comes up beside him
You did this -- in a day
The matrix formed in a day
The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate
Can cook or can't

151 The turbo doors open and Joachim stands there
Impulse power restored
Khan smiles
More than a match for poor Enterprise
He punches at his console

The Admiral's son
Don't you believe it
Oh,  believe it
She almost smiles
David returns her stare and it throws her
(continuing) What are you looking at
(confused) don't know
159B
-                             159B Saavik rises, paces
Kirk puts down his food
Now that's what  call a meal
It's like the Garden of Eden
Only here, every apple comes from the Tree of Knowledge
Kirk watches Saavik
What's on your mind, Lieutenant
The Kobayashi Maru , sir
The what
The no-win scenario -- and with what philosophy a commander faces defeat
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant
On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did
'd really like to know
Kirk looks at Bones, who smiles -- Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario -- And almost got tossed out of the Academy
He looks at his watch again, using his glasses -- How

Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death
Until now
We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik
He picks up the communicator
(continuing) Spock, this is Kirk
It's two hours
Are you about ready
' Right on schedule, Admiral
Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard
The others are on their feet, stunned with amazement -- Right

Spock is there to greet them
But the damage report -- we were immobilized
Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book
Hello, Spock
You remember Dr
Marcus
They are moving through the room as they talk -- Certainly
(overlapping) By the book
Regulation 46-: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle
' '
no uncoded messages on an open channel
' Saavik steps in front of Spock
(continuing) You lied
exaggerated
Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours -- (behind) 'm taking this bunch to sick bay

163
163 Saavik and Kirk follow Spock
They stop at a Turbo Lift -- They're inoperative below -deck
164
164 They race down corridors as they speak -- What  working around here
Not much, Admiral
We have partial main power
That's it
Best we could do in two hours
165
165 Full crew in place as doors whoosh open -- (overjoyed) Admiral on the bridge -- Battle stations

Kirk, Spock and Saavik approach the big screen
(continuing) Tactical
We see the Enterprise emerging from the dark side of Gamma Regula, where Reliant is now a moving blip
(continuing) Uh oh
She can out-run us and out-gun us
But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four
(studies his console) Scotty, can we make it inside
The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps
No promises, Mr
Scott
On your way
Trouble with the nebula, sir, is all that static discharge and gas clouds our tactical display
Visuals won't function and shields will be useless
Kirk looks over the rims of his glasses at Spock; they smile with faint amusement
What's sauce for the goose, Mr
Saavik
The odds will be even

You'll be in the way, Dr
Marcus

Carol and David are civilians on a battleship

168 Reacting
Saavik approaches Kirk and Spock
Admiral
what happens if Reliant fails to follow us into the nebula
Kirk and Spock exchange looks -- think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr
Saavik
Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego
Best speed, Scotty
169
169 The Enterprise whooshes by  leaving Regula behind
Reliant now appears in far b

170 There
Full impulse power
Not so wounded as we were led to believe -- so much the better

-                                  172 Call them -
Enterprise rushes  , flashes  and  towards the swirling nebula
Reliant does the same, closer in pursuit
At this moment, half the distance between Regula and the nebula has been covered

173 Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes
Reliant is closing
Steady as you go

174 Orientation,
Reliant can clearly see where Enterprise is headed -- 175
175 We'll lose them if they go in there
Rake her

177 Reliant's shot crosses Enterprise's bow -- 178
178 The ship reverberates with the near miss
Chekov wakes up, looks wildly about -- Take it easy -- But  must -- Listen to me, Pavel; you haven't the strength or the equilibrium -- But -- As they talk, David, unnoticed, leaves the area
The Enterprise is buffeted again -- Dr
McCoy,  can't just sit here
Tell me what  can do
(grim) You can help get my surgery squared away

She whitens in fear

179 That was close -- (unfazed) They just don't want us going in there
One minute to nebula perimeter
The bridge door slides open and David enters
He stares in wonder
Saavik reacts to David
(continuing) Admiral, they're reducing speed
Uhura, patch me in -- Aye, sir
180
180 Why are we slowing
We daren't follow them into the nebula, sir -- our shields will be useless
' This is Admiral Kirk
Khan's eyes bulge -- ' (continuing) We tried it once your way, Khan
Are you game for a rematch
Khan's eyes bulge -- ' (continuing) Khan --

No sir
We have Genesis -- Whatever you want -- Full power damn you And he reaches across and executes it himself

Barely moving, she feels her way forward

-                           188 Reliant's image is breaking up
Phaser lock inoperative, sir
Best guess, Mr
Sulu
Fire when ready
Sulu strains, then fires -- just as an electrical dis- turbance bounces the bridge -- 189
189 The bounce causes Sulu's phaser shot to go wide of Reliant, amid  discharges -- 190
190 Rolls from the near-miss concussion -- Aft-torpedoes -- fire --

When it clears, Enterprise appears to be alone

Occasional electrical flashes

199 The Bridge rattles from the explosion below; Sulu is thrown from his chair
Saavik leaps to her post -- Phaser bank one, fire

200 The Enterprise fires a phaser and delivers a raking shot -- which rips along the side of Reliant's primary hull
200A

201
201 Sulu is being helped by David -- Damage, Scotty
202
202 Bones is there, helping some crewmen
The Reactor Room flashes a red warning light and glows with a blue light
The air is heavy with smoke but the doors, damaged earlier, still hold
Admiral, 've got to take the mains off the line
The energizer's shaken loose and  can't get in there to fix her -- radiation -- 203
203 All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power
The bridge door opens and closes; Chekov, faint, stands there
Could you use another hand, Admiral
Man the weapons console, Mr
Chekov
David as the others react to Chekov taking his place
Quiet
(continuing) Spock
Spock is bent over the scanner -- Sporadic energy readings port side, aft
Could be an impulse turn
He won't break off now
If he followed me this far he'll be back
But from where
He's intelligent, but not experienced
His pattern indicates two dimensional thinking
Kirk looks at him, smiles
Mr
Saavik, all stop
All stop, sir
Descend ten thousand meters
Stand by photon torpedoes

206 As Reliant emerges from the dark blue mass into a clear almost tranquil place
Reliant, moving slowly, stops, as if looking around

Where is he
Where in God's name is he

208 Reliant motionless in the f

Now, behind Reliant and from below, like a great whale rising from the depths, Enterprise rises vertically, slowly passing the unsuspecting enemy

Cease fire
Look sharp
Power levels quite low, sir
(to intercom) Mr
Scott, can you get the mains back on line
' (breaking up slightly) 'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates
Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded

He is horribly burned, and it is clear that he is clinging to life by his will
No
Kirk
The game's not over
As Uhura's voice continues
, Khan pulls himself into a chair at the console, one of his hands useless at his side
(continuing) To the last  will grapple with thee
Painfully, with one good arm, he starts arming the Genesis console

213A There sits the Genesis torpedo: lights start blinking in response
As we watch, the  we met on Ceti Alpha walks to the torpedo and smiles at the lights

It's the Genesis Wave

He's on a build up to detonation
How soon -- We encoded four minutes -- We'll beam aboard and stop it -- You can't
The briefest stunned moment
Kirk hits intercom: Scotty,  need warp speed in three minutes or we're all dead
(continuing) Scotty
Spock leaps from his place and disappears through the bridge doors
(continuing) Saavik, get us out, best speed
Aye, sir

Her speed is pain- fully slow

Khan smiles triumphantly through his pain
An elec- tronic power  has been building
No
You can't get away
From hell's heart  stab at thee

Khan topples forward, dead

217 Spock rushes in
Bones ministers to Scotty, b

Spock sizes up the situation, starts for the radiation room, Bones intercepts him
Are you out of your Vulcan mind
No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, 'm not human
You're not going in there --
'm afraid  can't stop to discuss this logically -- He gives Bones the Vulcan nerve pinch
Bones goes down
Spock presses the access button and enters the Reactor Room, a separated area behind radiation-proof glass and metal,    and an iridescent blue glow within
218    -                                      218 (in horror) Spock -- get out of there

219 Bathed in blue light, arcing energy around him, Spock is a silhouetted figure as he goes to work, door clos- ing behind him

Spock is oblivious
Amid the fire-blue arcs, he moves to the control panel
Between his hands and the con- trols, power arcs insanely
Spock is in an inferno, a radiation hell, fighting now with all his strength to control it
Slowly, the damping rods move out
Spock moves to a manual control, begins to turn it

It is awesome

Instinctively she draws near her son
Finally, Kirk turns, sees Carol -- Reduce speed
My God, Carl
Look at it

Well done

The tone frightens Kirk
Saavik, take the con
He moves through the doors quickly, leaving the rest staring at the new world evolving
232
232 It is endless
Kirk runs forever, feet pounding down, down, down -- 233
233 The clouds tumble and move, new things lie beyond -- 234
234 Kirk races -- 235
235 Kirk emerges to encounter Scotty and Bones
Their looks tell him
He sees the flashing light over the Reactor Room
He dashes for the control panel
Bones grabs him
No, sir
You'll flood the whole compartment
He'll die --
(also holds him) He's dead already, Jim
Kirk's eyes bulge
Oh, God
236                                   236 With stunned understanding, Kirk stumbles to the door, sees Spock on his knees, hands blackened, face cracked with radiation lines and scars
Spock shakes his head
With a feeble hand he reaches the intercom button: filtered communication
Spock
The ship -- out of danger
Yes -- Spock is satisfied; he fights for breath -- Don't grieve, Admiral -- it's logical: the good of the many outweighs -- He almost keels over
Kirk has tears streaming down his face
the good of the few
Or the one
He props a hand on the glass to support himself
Kirk's hand reflexively goes to match Spock's on the other side of the glass -- (continuing) never took the Kobayashi Maru test -- until now
What do you think of my solution
Spock
have been -- and always will be -- your friend
Live
Long
And
Prosper
Spock falls
Bones and Scotty react
No
' (intercom) Admiral, you've got to see this
There's new life -- a whole new world, a Genesis world --

David watching Kirk attentively
So are Sulu, Uhura, Chekov, and Saavik
Bones stands next to Kirk
Scotty carries his bagpipes
Saavik wears her hair down
(continuing) And yet, in the midst of our sorrow it should be noted that this death takes place in the shadow of new life, the sunrise of a new world, a world that our beloved comrade gave his own life to protect and nourish
He did not feel that sacrifice a vain or empty one -- and we will not debate his profound wisdom, in these proceedings
Of my friend,  can only say this, that of all the souls  have encountered in my travels, his was the most -- (he falters) -- human
He tries to go on, but catches Bones' face: Bones is streaming tears
Kirk can't go on

Set course for Ceti Alpha  and we'll pick up survivors
Aye, sir
'll be in my quarters if needed, but  would prefer
Understood, sir
(aloud) Dismiss the company

He pours a drink, then decides not to have it
He sits wearily, not knowing how to shake the ghosts
Then he sees the book
Kirk picks up the battered volume, the gift from his friend, and closes his eyes a moment
Almost idly he starts turning pages, looking for a clue
But he can't see the writing -- he rummages through his pockets and pulls out the half-glasses -- One of the lenses is broken
It has a deep impact on Kirk
He puts down the book and glasses and covers his eyes
Kirk clears his throat
Yes
come
The door whooshes open and closes to admit David
The last person Kirk expected to see
don't mean to intrude
Uh, no
(rises) should be on the bridge
Are you running away from me
David's strength is turning a corner with Kirk -- suppose  was
(pause) poured a drink
Would you like it
No
--  guess 'm not what you expected
(rueful) didn't expect anything
That makes two of us
(he studies his father) Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death -- (hoarse) Not like this -- no
haven't faced death,  cheated death
tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity know nothing
You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life -- It was just words
But good words
That's where ideas begin
Maybe you should listen to them
'm trying, David
So am
My friends were killed, too
am truly sorry
Pause
They study each other
was wrong about you
And 'm sorry
Is that what you came here to say
Mainly
(he starts out, then turns -- ) And also that 'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son
stunned moment, then Kirk lets it all hang out: for David, for Carol and for Spock
He hugs his son, hold- ing onto him as if to life itself
246
246 The Enterprise passes the new planet in all its beauty
247
247 The door whooshes
Kirk strides on the bridge, David with him
Carol is there with Bones; they are glad at what they see
Admiral on the bridge
As you were, Mr
Saavik
Aye, sir
On course to Ceti Alpha
All is well
Good,  believe you already know my, uh, son -- Saavik comes close to blushing -- (continuing) Yes, well, why don't you show him around and
Aye, sir -- She takes him off, deadpan amusement -- (continuing) So you turn out to be the dumb bastard
They stare at her
(continuing) That is a little joke
Kirk has a smile
He joins Bones and Carol facing the screen
She's changed her hair again
(pause) Will you look at that
Think they'll name it for you, Doctor
Not if  can help it
We'll name it for our friend
(quietly) It is a far far better thing  do than  have ever done before
a far better resting place  go to than  have ever known
(soft) Is that a poem
Something Spock was trying to tell me
On my birthday
He shakes his head, remembering -- You okay, Jim
How do you feel
(considers; smiles) Young
feel young, Doctor
