360 degree pan reveals: nothing
Deserted, no hiding places
No animals, no humans, no objects
Except in mid distance -- 3 brightly painted, traditional, comforting, belongs in a village green
Perfectly ordinary -- except for its location
Silence
Only the wind over the plain
Except -- The

We wait for someone to answer it
But of course nothing and nobody for miles
Except -- 4 a

Driven at maximum, breakneck speed, 125 mph

Black leather like a second skin

Sexual, invulnerable, cool
Very cool

Then steps across to the phone box
Picks up the phone

Then presses button bakelite box

Then a  as -- 8 the floor lowers automatically
Emma disappears
Hanging outside the box, a notice now reads "Out of Order
" Next to the call box we notice a sign: an arrow pointing into the desert:  "London 84 miles
" 9 underground
Emma descends on the lift platform; steps into a research lab in retro hi tech
Walks past assistants, down long pink and orange steel corridors, Werner von Braun goes disco
Nears a door, marked:  "Prospero Project -- Authorized Personnel Only
" Logo with lightning emerging from a cloud
10 man enters, older
In matching leather suit: like an astronaut
Early 40's, handsome, charismatic, with swept-back silver-black hair
His name tag:
Ready, darling
Peter fixes her name tag:
; runs a finger down over her breast
She smiles
Ready as 'll ever be
Mutual erotic, intellectual attraction
Peter takes her hand and they walk down: 11 air-lock doors: a series of sealed chambers inside a hitech Labyrinth -- man joins them
shyer, bespectacled, less handsome version of Peter
On his name tag:

Thermal chamber ready
Compression module set
Temperature control on course between one and one forty
Water turbulence steady

Valentine smiles, shrugs -- Good luck
Peter
Emma
Thanks, Valentine
Emma gives him a quick peck on the cheek
shy look from Valentine at Emma
Peter senses Just a minute, darling
My brother's a worry wart
better have a word
Valentine -- Peter takes Valentine over to one side
Emma checks gauges and dials
Behind her a conversation
Peter returns
He takes a ring from his finger -- 12       - on a gold ring
13 He slips it onto her finger
Something to remember me by
Peter smiles
The remark strikes Emma as curious
But no time to query
She smiles back
He gives her a kiss -- (checks his watch) See you in an hour
One sunny day
The countdown  around them as they separate
14 Valentine watches her
15 Inside a bed of ice, Emma is lowered by hydraulic machine into a steel radioactive thermal chamber, glowing eerily blue The effect is very cold
Frozen
Numb
Like a sci-fi Sleeping Beauty, beauty entombed and sealed in a glass coffin
Plunged down into a vault
Opposite her -- In another glass coffin, Peter Peel, is lowered down

Peter winks at her -- Emma locks longingly at him, as -- 17 Valentine watches behind glass
Like a kid excluded from a bedroom
He attends to dials
And to his female assistant -- (thrilled) Readings still normal
The assistant smiles oddly
-- An insignia tattooed on her neck: "X404

The sun glints off it

The ice is infused with pulsating colors: purple -- blue -- green -- red

Something wrong
21 Peter Peel's "coffin" starts to overheat
Peter reacts -- (intercom cutting out) Losing control -- malfunction in thermal chamber -- for Christ's -- Emm --
22 Needles push off the dials, as -- The ice swells: strange mix of colors, absorbing heat and energy in clusters of molten metal
steam and sparks ignite
Valentine's eyes widen in alarm
(
) Five -- four --  three -- two -- one
Three -- two -- one
(repeating) Three -- two -- one
23 Peter's glass cracks The emergency light goes on -- the  sounds -- lab assistants running
24 Emma realizes; looks to Peter -- 25
- The "Koons" antenna is drawing a strange purple cloud towards it, from otherwise blue sky
siphoning the purple atmosphere down itself into 26
- Thru the air ducts the purple cloud starts to billow
Panic stations
Valentine looks aghast at the graphs:  all systems fucked, over the intercom -- Emma, Peter, get out
It's going to explode
Valentine's anguished face  Emma's face, as Emma
27 Emma undoes the straps, clambers out of her pod 28       (   ) Emma clambers onto her husband's pod -- in a sequence eternally replayed for her as a nightmare -- 29 Get out
Leave him --
Emma
30 The purple smoke enveloping Peter's	pod, soft caresses -- Peter struggling within, looking at Emma -- Peter
Her leatherclad limbs straddled over his glass coffin
Her  sounds
She grabs, claws on glass -- Her fist draws back, blam
blam
blam
three deadly blows, Emma  the pod cover, it -- Cracks -- splinters -- not breaking -- obscuring his face inside like a spider's web, as behind her Don't wait for him -- he's not -- Breathless, blood smeared on glass, Emma's gashed fist bleeds thru torn leather glove -- twisted mass of flesh and glass --  sound growing as: 31 The voluminous purple cloud being sucked by the antenna
32        ' gleaming thru a tear of blood as she pounds the glass -- 33 (faint) Emma
Emma
As a  sound grows till An  rocks the vault -- flames burst out -- sound and vision separate -- Emma hears explosion as a slow moving tear thru her psyche
trauma
34       (   ) The blast flings Emma back thru space, flying unconscious as if in a dream, floating backwards in -- milky way op-art swirl of glass and steel fragments, now -- out of control, weightless, powerless, as -- The background of sealed doors, white corridors all vanish
spinning, black void opens up behind her, as her eyes shut, head falls back -- An orgasmic, dream of near-death, as a     a hip new version of the ""   -- 35 In stark silhouette  The swishing of a bowler hat spinning thru space An umbrella tossed in the air, flicked like a deadly weapon -- rich velvety feel, key colors black/white/red

Flashes of: hair -- eye -- a red rose -- in bloom -- petals folding and unfolding, then tightly shut
thorned stem, sharp to the touch -- black and white  color -- leather Background metamorphosing into black and white of a chessboard as
medieval knight moves around its queen in a formal dance -- fetishistic attention to detail: leather catsuit, swish of legs, boots

Bowler hat thrown, skimming, swishing thru air, until -- Now only a single

Then -- as: 36

Her   as she looks around her Klaus Oldenberg room, vinyl comforter, satin sheets

Looks more mature
Sexual, haunted

Emma Peel -- widow
Same every night
Next to the clock, a framed photo of her dead husband, Peter Peel
From outside
Emma flings on a satin robe, goes to the window and sees -- 37 a  zooooming past, its bowler-hatted driver racing thru early morning streets
The damn thing  again
38 Emma frowns, annoyed

The sleek, sporty black Jaguar SS100 burns down deserted streets
Inside is a bowler-hatted man -- , late 30's
Handsome English gent, roguish looks, dandy's clothes Beau Brummel figure in a Savile Row suit, velvet collar, embroidered waistcoat

) (filtered) The War Office today approved military expenditure for the nation's new defense alert system
spokesman  said he would raise the matter at the forthcoming World  Council of Ministers, but that a state of vigilance was still necessary in the uncertain climate
As Steed turns into a mews, we realize that in this kinky, pop world, ordinary life does not intrude
No traffic
No extras
Nothing to spoil the view
As the radio continues with a weather forecast, Steed -- 41
'  - Steed's car enters his garage -- Door closes as -- 42
'  - but the curtains are still drawn so the place is dark
large bachelor's den
Dark wood, leather armchairs
Steed enters his library from a concealed door -- Titles on wine and birdwatching
He clicks the door, goes to his drinks cabinet
Pours a brandy
Hears a noise
Instantly on guard
In his glass, sees a shadowy reflection move
Steed peers 'round a corner
Sees a silhouetted figure stand over his desk -- a burglar
Steed sneaks up behind -- raises his umbrella, and -- Crack
Brings the umbrella down -- on the suspect's head
Who manages to dodge, swivel 'round, and -- Bam
Delivers an expert blow to Steed's stomach
rapid exchange of blows
Steed recoils, about to jab the umbrella, when -- His assailant about to deliver a kick to his crotch -- Steed covers the area -- bam
a spiked heel hits his bowler -- as the curtains are drawn back, light floods in -- they freeze
Steed knows his opponent:  a lethal blonde in red leather
Brenda --

And , his beautiful leather-clad bodyguard
Who smiles seductively
Mother
thought you were burglars
Brenda and  thought we'd drop in
Mother suits action to the word, drops into his wheelchair
See how you're getting on
Something in the wind
Mother wheels himself from the study
Taps a barometer
It whirls around
Weather's turning nasty
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely
Oh yes  did
want you to meet somebody
(off Steed's look) expect you'll like her
Brenda coolly files her nails
flash of jealousy

Bach   floats in the air
Hands gliding over keys, Emma Peel plays with virtuoso skill
On the piano, a framed picture of her late husband
And a photo of Emma between Peter and Valentine
Emma gets up, goes to the door
The   , keys jumping up and down automatically, as -- 46 Emma flicks open a large automated eye
Peers thru
Opens 47 (distinctive outfit) hands over a package tied in a bow
Dr
Peel
Thank you
Emma shuts the door
Unties the bow, opens up  Finds an embossed card: (reads) 'Please answer the Telephone

Just then

Emma goes over, picks up the phone

The phone goes dead
Emma opens up the case
Unveils a brace of kippers
Puzzled, she holds up a fish
Kippers

-  ( ) - Near the Mall, outside white stucco buildings, a Lotus Elan pulls up and parks as a car conveniently leaves, cutting off another angry
dash clock says 2:15
Out gets -- -- Emma Peel, different attire
She climbs steps
On a brass plaque, "Boodles Gentlemen's Club
"  She goes in, passing -- -- an astonished uniformed commissionaire
49
'  - approaches her, equally surprised
May  help you, madam
Mr
John Steed, please
'm afraid that's impossible
Impossible
The Porter points to a notice:  "No non-members
No animals
No women
" You are female
As you see
Then you can't come in
have an appointment
No women
Not in Boodles
Not since 1922
Really -- what happened in 1922
Bored, Emma breezes past, already inside the hall
Old mahogany, portraits of dead politicians, leather chairs
male enclave
The Porter rushes up to restrain her
Hardly missing a step, Emma lays a gentle hand on his shoulder -- finds the nerve ends
The Porter winces and -- Thank you so much
can find Mr
Steed myself
-- collapses on the ground in agony
Emma ignores him
Pushes thru double doors, upstairs, statues of naked bronze warriors frown down on her, into 50
-   - Thru a cloud of steam in an oriental room Steed sits naked save for a towel
He hears a disturbance, thru the mist, sees -- Emma before him
Automatically, Steed dons his bowler and tips it in her direction
Doctor Peel,  presume
And you must be Steed
Please don't get up
He doesn't
between them as they study
was about to throw in the towel
had a spot of bother at the door
shouldn't wonder
Not a woman inside Boodles since -- 1922
Why the kippers
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think
(looks around) So what was all this -- some sort of test
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege
guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor
Whereas you are
Dyed in the wool
But  can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules
Rules are made to be broken
Not by me
Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing
And just what is the game
say, this is all terribly formal
Must  go an calling you Dr
Peel
(re:  the steamroom) Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs
Peel
Much better
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you
didn't
Mother did
Mother
Steed steps closer, smiling
expect you'll like him
Off Emma's reaction -- 51

Steed dodges traffic -- Wearing racing goggles, windscreen down -- Executes a nifty maneuver, swerves on a zebra crossing, scatters pedestrians, his
Beside him, Emma is cool as a cucumber
Steed turns charmingly
Tea time -- four o'clock
Mustn't be late
(beat) word of warning
Don't take the macaroon
Mother's favorite
Steed swerves down a narrow alleyway, into a secret car park entrance by the riverbank
He pulls up before a sign: No Admittance At a control barrier Steed inserts a card
Emma sees a light flash up: "Security -- Top Priority Clearance Only
"  The barrier lifts
She looks again at Steed, reappraising him as Big Ben approaches four
The car disappears in darkness

We are beneath the Thames -- garbage and fish float past a window of reinforced glass
An original Campbell's tomato soup can floats down as we to reveal

Mother wheels himself forward and hooks onto the kettle

He pours, presiding like a fat spider at the center of a subterranean web, known as The Ministry: a vast bureaucracy in a labyrinth of tunnels
Catches Emma's wandering lock expect you're wondering where you are
An atmosphere of a gentleman's club reigns in the subterranean bureau -- Emma takes her tea
Don't tell me: You're the shadow secret service
You're so hushhush, even the legit secret service knows nothing about it
Am  right
Bodyguard Brenda, a glam leather Moneypenny, wheels a trolley brimming with fancies over to Emma and Steed
Close
We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it
(before Emma can make sense of this) Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut;  recommend the rum baba
Hmmm
Looks like rain, Steed
Showers followed by sunny periods
(looks up from trolley) We're not here to talk about the weather, surely
Oh, yes we are
(to Emma, cunning) Macaroon
Emma hesitates; takes a cake
About to take a bite, when -- Mother switches off lights
screen drops, covering the water window as the mood changes from coziness to terror -- an ancient   on
54 Emma watches on the wall, an official Ministry film of macabre death tableaux in the English countryside: We've had a series of bizarre weather reports
We kept them hush-hush and sent agents into the field for data
Case number one: April 14, 3:35
, Special Agent Simkins investigating mysterious fires in corn circles
field outside the village of Little Snoring, one of the hottest days of the year
Trapped by a sudden blizzard
Found frozen to death in a giant ice cube -- like a mammoth in perma-frost
(the picture changes) Case two: Pilot Raymond Shaw, May 6, 11:28
Took off from a deserted airstrip near Stoke Poges, investigating bizarre atmospheric reports
freak rainstorm downed him
Knocked unconscious by a flying fish, falling from 15,000 feet
Twenty-five inches of rain in eight minutes, over an area the size of a cricket pitch
(the picture changes) Case three: June 2, 5:43
Defense Chief Major Courtnay
Remains discovered in a turnip field near Ashby de la Zouche
Our boffins recorded a sudden blast of heat
Scorched earth, temperature of 1000 degrees
Spontaneous combustion
Not much of him left
The lights go back on
Emma notices - a new arrival a tall, striking  ; dark glasses
My number two
Special assignments
She's -- Let me guess -- 'Father'
( ) All happy families here, Mrs
Peel
Father's dark glasses turn to Emma like a hawk
Runs her fingers over Emma's face
Gets the outline
Emma realizes -- You're -- Blind
Father smiles
God, you're quick
Have a look at these, Mrs
Peel -- He passes 'round a box of evidence related to the screen events:  Steed investigates a pair of black shoes and bowler; Emma, a fish
The shoes have agent Simkins' name in them
Ah
From Trubshaw's
My shoemaker
(unimpressed) kipper
Or a red herring
What were they investigating
series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns
Global warming
Jungle plants in the Arctic
lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland
Blizzards in summer
How curious
Something strange is happening
And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out
(to Steed) Your mission is simple
Find out how and why these agents died
'm no spy -- where do  fit in
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art
Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded
We need your expertise
Perhaps 'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs
Peel -- Emma hesitates, unsure for the first time
'm not sure 'm ready to return to work
've been out of action for some time
'll consider your proposal
She gets up, ready to go
One moment, Mrs
Peel
There's another special reason we wanted you to join our happy family; rather curious, actually
Mother hits the lights
He flicks the video into slow-mo
File thru image clarification, identikit sketches
Eye witness reports
Strangers in the area
One description tallied in all three places
Recognize her
Emma locks
On the screen comes -- Emma Peel
Steed reacts
Me, isn't it
Emma stares at the screen: incredible
Like a twin sister
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs
Peel
With a twist
You're our chief suspect
You're saying  have no choice
Father will be your controller
Steed here will show you the ropes
(very arch) Ropes
55 life-size target of a man with blank face, bowler hat and umbrella, flips up, and -- Is riddled with holes by Emma, who works at reloading as 56         - looking on, Mother with Steed
Think she really killed those agents
She may not know
Theory goes she may be very ill
Amnesia
Possibly
Split personality
Insane
Who knows
If Dr
Darling is right, you should watch out
Why
She may try to kill you
57 Emma swiftly turns, aims, and -- with dead-eye precision
All on target
Steed reacts
Ulp
Perhaps  ought to talk with Dr
Darling
58 gallery of portraits of Emma Peel projected on the wall based on Warhol's Jackie (1964) -- Poignant, inscrutable, fascinating, iconic -- blown up, dissected, analyzed
The swirling newspaper dots cover Mother and Steed like bubbles from a light show
As
, head of the Ministry's Psychological Operations (Psy Ops) -- a kind of spy version of Timothy Leary, briefs them
In his thick dark glasses and beard, Darling's obsessive interest in Emma adds a sinister air
One key point: Mrs
Peel is a widow: she's obsessively devoted to the memory of her husband the scientist Peter Peel
You may find her a little
remote
Images of Peter Peel on the wall
Of Emma with him
They were a team
Met at Cambridge
Working on a top secret research mission into weather conditions, code name The Prospero Project, when Peel died
Steed looks meaningfully at Mother
Something went wrong
System malfunction
Explosion
Mrs
Peel had a narrow escape
Suspected sabotage
Nothing proven
File still open
How come you took so much interest in her, Dr
Darling
Her husband was one of ours
(eyes Peel's photo, then Mother) Peel
Did she know
Still doesn't
Better safe than sorry
She was in a dangerous game, Steed
High stakes
She may prove to be a risk
If she is, there's only one solution
Termination
Anyone particular in mind
You
Steed's reaction
59 Steed and Emma (new outfit), cross swords
Like everything else she does, Emma is a champion
Steed is hard put
Both fence attached to cables -- very high-tech dueling
Steed is in white; Emma (natch), in black
yin and yang
You're a lady of hidden talents, Mrs
Peel
Tic-tac
've no intention of hiding them
Tic-tac
Scientist
(tic-tac) marksman
(tic-tac) swordsman
(tic-tac) To what do you attribute your overachievements
Fast swordplay
Tic-tac-tic-tac-tic
Steed's good, too
My father always wanted a boy
Really
fail to see the connection
had a feeling you would
Touche
She lunges; her foil tips right into the heart on Steed's chest
Steed removes his mask; holds her foil tip
take your point
Emma takes off her mask
Do you
Yes indeed
need protection
60
- "Trubshaw's of Jermyn Street, since 1756
"  Steed's Jag parked in front -- of course there's a space
Getting out thought we were on our way
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting
No point setting out half shod
(dry) Or half cocked
61       - slips Steed's hand-made shoes an
The "lasts" shapes of shoes beside him -- bear Steed's name
couldn't agree more
Thank you, Trubshaw
(significantly) Very good, Mr
Steed

Leopard
tiger
Then next to them, in a wall of hunting trophies Emma paces impatiently beneath them
Shop assistants attend in tails and wing-collars, very old school tie
Steed emerges helped into a new flashy waistcoat
(gags at the waistcoat) Steed, we really must be -- (relishing his shoes) Ahh
Perfect fit
The luxury of a hand-made shoe
As unique as a face or a fingerprint
Or should  say
63 Eyes watching Emma and Steed rise
You can but  wish you wouldn't
Thank you, Trubshaw
youngish man -- in black polo neck, Beatle-cut mop, pauting lips, smart suit, druggy high-pitched giggle
, a cocky, cool psychopath
He watches Steed and Emma leave
and saunters after them
64
- as the Jag races through them, heading for the country
(
) That place is so absurd, so out of date
(
) Do you really think so
Another car follows them
as they pass Buckingham Palace, now painted pink and guarded by female grenadiers
65 reading:  "Scotland" with an arrow, as Steed and Emma zoom past in the Jag

) Press that button, would you
Tea
66       - opens, revealing a tea service: a samovar of tea, feeding into a pre-warmed pot, pouring into two china cups
to reveal: 67
- Emma, reacts, pours from the samovar
Sorry
Didn't mean to interrupt your flow of oratory
Steed's   again as at the beginning
You know what  mean
This car -- and you
Nobody walks around like that
Milk
Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs
Peel
No thank you
She hands over a cup
But why
What's the point
Gentleman has to have a code
This is part of mine
uniform
Think of it as my suit of shining armor
And  suppose you're the knight
The most unpredictable piece on the board
And always ready to protect his queen
That's predictable
When  find a queen in need of protection 'll let you know
Steed looks in the mirror
Behind them, a car
Tailing
'm hoping you will
He puts his foot down
Zoom
68
- Towards picturesque Scotland
The   by - then the other car
69
- Emma consults a list, reads -- Sir August Merryweather
why are we seeing him first
As per mother's instructions
Do we always follow Mother's instructions
For a man in my position -- Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking
How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work
(smiles) They call me in when they've reached a dead end
Freelance
Like yourself
have no choice
Why should you risk your life
After our fencing match,  was rather hoping you would do the risking
More tea
No thanks
meant me
Emma takes in Steed's evasive answers
Sighing, she pours
70
- The Jag winds around Loch Ness, followed by the car
(
) According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands
millionaire
Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry
Now
(
) An eccentric recluse
71
- Not so much eccentric
More barking mad
He has a wife called June
And a daughter somewhere -- Julie
June, July

The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined
Any other vices

Thinks British weather has been tampered with by

Emma takes this in
So

How
Small talk
Try the weather

- Steed and Emma speed up to the huge open main gates Signs:  "Private: No Admittance

They start up the drive
Several peacocks on the lawn fan open their beautiful tails
One of them, a mechanical peacock whose thousand eyes  with the  of a The other car pulls in behind

Jungle plants, parakeets, snakes
Walls lined with display cabinets and bell jars:  stuffed birds, butterflies, spiders

The Butler leaves
Emma fans herself
Nobody in the roam
But hears a sound of  from a smoked glass conservatory
Sir August
Sir August

) Eh
In here
Emma follows the , steps cautiously forward

Emma stays cool

Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man

How did you acquire a taste for it
Out in India
So character-forming for the British
Not the heat
Good Lord, no
The rain, dash it
good monsoon
Fifteen inches overnight
whole week of lovely rain
remember one summer in Jaipur
Sir August removes his goggles, recognizes her
You Have we met
You mean you don't recall
Before Emma can reply, the door opens
Ah, Lady June
Emma's attention switches to  , a buxom lady in a sou'wester and galoshes, who wheels in a tray of scones
Dear August
Loves his showers
Like a baby
(beat) Scones, Mrs
Peel
Thank you, Lady -- June
Emma sees Sir August gazing wistfully out of the window, which is rapidly darkening
Ah, beautiful
Just as he promised
Promised
Who promised
There, look
Emma looks, sees rain start to pitter-patter on the windows
Emma exchanges looks with June as the rain starts pouring
Imagine being caught out in a blow like that
76
- and lightning -- Steed is caught out in it; puts up his umbrella; wanders over the brow of a hill, past a big sign:  "No Trespassers
"  Rains more
And more
Turns to a tempest, as -- say, this is a bit much
Lashed by rain ' Steed carries on to the brow of the hill
He looks over, peers through the mist at -- deep purple cloud
Mushrooming towards him
Steed can't escape it
It envelops him
Starts to blink
Cough
Footsteps less sure
Surrounded by thick purple haze Steed stumbles and falls Down a hill
Tumbles to the bottom
He knocks his head on a rock
Steed blinks, shakes his head
Eyes refocus
He sees 77 Sun shining down on yellow sand, a barren vista
Dead trees
Suddenly Steed's in the Sahara
heat haze shimmers
Steed blinks, thinks he's dreaming when he sees
78        - Steed heads towards it
The   seems further away
Like an optical illusion
Then hears
Steed still bowler-hatted
Overcoat
Perspiring
Takes off bowler, wipes brow
Adjusts rose in buttonhole
It wilts
He arrives at the phone box
Opens the door
Steed picks up the  , listens to -- of "The Merry Widow

Over the , a strange -- (

Hello
Who the hell
Who is this
You must leave the test area
repeat, leave the area
Help is on the way
The line goes dead
Steed is baffled
Steps out, sees -- 79 a shimmering heat haze
figure on a camel moving towards them
Steed watches amazed, as the camel pads closer
The mirage arrives
The rider dismounts
woman in yashmak and veils
She draws closer
Drops the veils to reveal -- Emma Peel
In her black leather catsuit
Mrs
Peel
Good of you to drop by
And  see you're wearing your - riding outfit
Emma moves closer
Steed smiles at her
Emma closer and -- chop
-- gives a kung-fu jab to the throat, a kick to the balls, a jab to the stomach
As Steed lies on the ground -- Manners, Mrs
Peel
Emma takes out a

Round his heart
Steed slumps back on the sands
Eyes close

Drops a small toy snowshaker into his curled fingers
Blows a good bye kiss

Empty apart from one bed
nurse (Brenda in her red leather), her spiked heels clacking on the floor, brings over a cup of tea to Steed in a hospital bed
Who wakes, surprised to see Emma
Peering over him
Very nonchalant
Eating his grapes
Ah, Brenda
(as she leaves) Mrs
Peel
You should be dead
How do you feel
(eyes her) Strange
You were very lucky
Four shots to the heart
found you after  slipped away from Sir August
Mother brought you here
Not me you should thank
wasn't about to
mean your man Trubshaw
Your bullet-proof waistcoat
thought you were just overdressed

84 Mother with Dr
Darling taking notes
Emma looks up at them
Drops to a whisper
But they both are wearing headphones
Mother and Dr
Darling have me under observation
They think tried to kill you
Why should they think that
You told them
You said  arrived on a camel, shot you four times
Left you for dead
Frankly that's how  remember it
But that's absurd
may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs
Peel
(conceding) That's possible
Sir August was convinced he'd met me before
But 'd never met him
Another odd thing
When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised
Did he say who
No
But he must know
Incidentally, my double left you with this
Emma shows Steed the toy snow scene
winter wonderland snow scene
He looks puzzlingly at it
On its underneath
"The Wonderland Corporation," followed by -- An invitation
To a 'formal picnic'
Did you say formal
must dress
85
- The sporty Jag pulls up outside a tall, swanky building
Steed gets out, opens her door
Irritated, Emma steps out of the car, clad in her leather suit -- 86 hitting the street
Steed, admiring -- must say, you look more your old self -- You mean my other self
Either way
may  ask: why you dress in that fashion
should have thought that was obvious
(off his smirk) 'm in mourning
She moves off
Stay on his poker face
can't wait to see afternoon
He joins her; they survey the building
Where's the picnic
They look up to -- 87
- boardroom suite, overlooking London
Lights twinkling -- Around a conference table
Twelve
Each six feet tall
Ridiculous and sinister
In pink, turquoise, brown, black, white, green
Furry, giant paws and ears, swivel eyes
One teddy sports a familiar tartan
On the table, children's party food: jellies, hundreds and thousands, birthday cakes
And wrapped presents before each
Each bear has a name-badge: Bobby, Bobo, Bruno, Bibi, Betty, Binky etc
pinned to their fur
children's tune, "  ' ," plays

In front of the teddy bears, each one receives a present wrapped up in paper with a pink and silver bow
The tartan teddy opens his up:   snow scene

Only the party detritus plus little teddy bears sitting where formerly the big ones sat; the teddy bear picnic   again
One snow shaker left

90 Emma stares at it
Turns it over:  an address
Another invitation
38 Marlborough Terrace
91
() - Inside number 38, a deserted Eastern bloc embassy
dilapidated hammer and sickle tapestry in tatters
Old spy techno-junk lies discarded in elegant living rooms
Steed and Emma open the door, rush inside
They search for clues
cigar left in an ashtray
Steed picks it up with distaste
Then   moves over to the wine rack, picks up a vintage bottle of champagne -- (admiringly) Hm
Veuve-Cliquot '56
(then puzzled) But he bites the end of his Monte Cristos
(frowning) Clearly, we're dealing with a maniac
Meanwhile, Emma goes into the -- 92        - ' where she sees a blob of  , like radioactive chewing gum
few pieces of charred clothing tell us this was once a man in a teddy bear outfit
93 Steed enters behind her, examines the gunk
Colonel Crabtree
International Satellite Systems
Formerly of the Ministry
How on earth can you tell
Steed holds up the inside of a battered shoe:  the name
Elementary, Mrs
Peel
Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade
Very good, Steed
What's that
Leaving Steed to ponder the remains, Emma goes into 94 Dark
Switches on the light
And gasps
95 looks up as Emma emerges with - Leopard cub
Steed raises his brolly
What on earth
Any ideas
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society
Is that written in his shoe
(smug) Common knowledge, Mrs
Peel
(shrugs) She had this in her mouth
There, there
Cooing to the cub, Emma tosses to Steed -- another snowshaker
Inside -- another address:  84 Cadogan Place
Not again
There's got to be another
way to go about this

Before gliding through an open French window -- 97

She looks 'round

Then off balance, Emma hurls him over her shoulder, darts in to pin the teddy to the ground as -- The teddy grabs Emma's legs, flings her off balance
She falls
Teddy grabs a military sabre from the wall, and Woosh
Slices through air at Emma's head
She ducks
The sabre skims her hair
Emma grabs another sabre; the fight is on
Emma counterattacks
Slashes with the sabre and the teddy's head goes flying off
Jesus
The torso stands unsteadily
Emma's eyes widen as: man's head emerges from the teddy torso
Emma's so surprised, he can slug her
Emma's out

Teddy looks up in terror as a purple cloud releases another

Turns the corner
Towards the other room, sees dead Teddy
Reads the label on his suitcase

105 from the window behind her like a spider on glass appears another "Emma" -- -- let's call her Bad Emma -- coming straight for Emma
She makes a
Emma turns just in time to see
Well, well
If it isn't me
Emma starts towards her double, who hesitates, then turns, leaping out the window
she wears the same black catsuit
The real Emma rushes, follows her "double" Clambers outside to rappel up the line to 106
- Emma looks
Beneath a starlit sky criss-crossed by wires, a rooftop maze of buildings, flanked by giant gargoyles -- goblins, lions, griffins -- over twinkling lights
Emma searches the roof -- no sign, only shadows
Then turns a corner to see -- Above the city, fairy lights on the rooftops of Harrods, lit by a million bulbs
giant neon signs
Several floors below, Emma sees the streets
twinge of vertigo
Then she looks up, hears a  -- From: 107 she sees her "double" run
Emma gives chase
Hot pursuit
Over rooftops
'Round wires
neon signs high over the city
Emma follows
Gains on the "double," who -- Pushes faster
Gliding between rooftop buildings
Dodging, weaving
But Emma gains more
Sleek limbs, muscular, perfect body machine, until -- 108     ' as she sees her "double" leap over a yawning chasm
And stumble on the other side for a footing
109 as Emma's adrenaline surges
She cannot stop, she -- Jumps
Hangs in the air
Limbs pushing out for the edge
And only just, she lands perfectly, gaining, closing, until -- 110 Emma gains up close
final burst of acceleration
Then without warning, her "double" -- Turns, Emma catches up, and -- Wham
Wham
kick -- a chop to Emma's body - double scissorkick -- Emma reacts swiftly, surges into overdrive -- In a lightning-fast kung fu duel --    --    -- a flurry of kicks as Emma -- Lands on her back
The "double" attacks
Emma retaliates -- Kicks up her leg -- flings the "double" over her head she lands awkwardly -- a in a blow to her head -- but picks herself up without pausing And vanishes into the rooftop maze
111 Emma stands
Looks
She's lost her "double
"  She stands alone, silhouetted against the night sky
Caught in the moonlight
Above sparks of neon
Daunting, muscular, poised for action, as -- Ears listening to distant noises
of of  through wires
Then an   -- 112     '  - above her a  as a    of an aerial is snapped
Slowly wound tightly 'round, bent back, coiled, ready to spring -- 113        - looks 'round
Sees nothing, hears the sound of the  coming seconds before -- Through the air -- 114     ' a flashing line like a bolt of lightning, but cannot move quickly enough as -- 115 as a cable wire whips across, coils 'round Emma, lashing her tight, crushing air from her, as the wire -- Sweeps Emma off her feet, whiplashes her back like a spring, hoists her and dangles her over the city
She looks down
long way
Emma grabs hold of the wire, which pulls her back
She drops down to the rooftop
Slithers down the roof
Slips -- 116 Emma hangs on with fingertips
Overlooking city with 100-foot neon sign above her: 117 for "Wonderland Weather" with: a repeated loop of a 100-foot high bikini-clad "Emma" throwing head back in holiday fun -- Sign: "  -- " 118 Emma hangs on, looks up, stares at "herself

Overlooking the whole city
Dizzy, Emma threatens to pass out
Just when from -- 119 an unseen hand from Bad Emma winds down -- Another  for her to hold
It uncoils down past the windows, telltale flare up as it hits metal -- Emma tries to grab for it
Misses, then grabs hold, and -- a   -- a thousand  surge through her body -- --  shock, Emma plummets   -- 120 on a lower ledge
She hangs precariously
Catching her breath
About to redouble her efforts
When beside her from a -- 121 an umbrella extended
Steed reaches out, reels Emma in
They are back in Teddy's flat
Emma collapses in Steed's arms
He helps her up -- hands her a phone

Completely unpredicted

In a blue funk
Can't take chances

Father drives like a maniac
She senses their unease
You're probably wondering how can drive 'blind

new prototype from the boys in  division
Micro-sensors in the system read signals and road information
Converts the info into miles per hour
Ultra-sensitive
Ultra-smart
Father jumps a red light
together in a huge pile-up
Not that smart
Steed holds onto his hat
We know one thing
That suspect was not Mrs
Peel
So you say
You don't believe him
It's Mother you have to convince
He's very agitated
Wait here
Father  to a halt on Holland Park Avenue Steed and Emma get out
Father takes off
But Don't bother
Here's a bus
red London number 22 bus drives up
As it arrives, in a conductor's cap is -- the bodyguard, Brenda
Fares, please, 126

Metal hooks on electronic panels
Now paranoid
Suspicious
All the upper windows have been blacked out
Welcome to mobile
Weather's turning quite nasty
Sir August was blown to smithereens
Along with half of Banffshire
The Ministry's worried
He tried to warn us
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late
Someone tipped them off
Too late anyway
Today's escapade was only for starters
This is no ordinary weather
It's manmade kind of weather bomb
Impossible
Not quite
This is my field
Is there anything that isn't
(ignores) The Prospero Project was started by my husband
It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming
In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible
We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite
'quick fix'
Filling in mother nature's blind spots
Exactly
There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea
Propane gas mostly
In small quantities it captures chlorine
Protects the ozone layer
But it proved impractical
Too bulky
But if someone miniaturized the process
That's what we were working on
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes
Directed by laser
Bounced by satellite
Quite possible
Where would they aim for
Mother thinks, gets out of his wheelchair; takes a turn about the bus, sits down again
No one pays any attention
London
The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence

According to Dr
Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior

Hairpin bends
Across a train at a level crossing, which just misses them -- 135

She smirks -- Do you always drive this fast
Have  trespassed on a male prerogative

Steed looks into the mirror, sees a car behind them
Pulling up, trying to catch up
Emma glances in the mirror, and -- Hold on
Puts foot down

Steed's head pinned back to his seat
Emma's hair tossed in the wind

The car behind always catches up
Emma tries to shake it
Gears up
Mach force
Over crossroads
Shaking 'round corners, as

The car behind struggles to keep up
Emma coasts ahead, turns a corner -- And suddenly sees in front of her -- 138 crossing directly in their path
Turn

An old lady on a bicycle with a basket appears
Are you alright, young man
think so, thank you so much
of  as - The following car swerves back, stops and Bailey emerges, gun drawn as Steed and the Old Lady react
(relishing) Reach for the sky, pardner
Steed raises his hands
Oh, dear -- To Steed's surprise, she pulls an Uzi from her basket and --
into Bailey, who crumples, gun spinning along the tarmac
Cute and sweetlooking, the Old Lady is unfazed
Cocky little bastard
hope he was a baddy

Most unfair
Quite a fuss at the Ministry

142 Coughing
Then Emma, sputtering straw as Steed's face appears
He tries to conceal his relief at seeing her
What, Lady Disdain
Are you yet breathing
Barely
You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you
He pulls her out
She's annoyed
143 Emma brushes herself off; pulls off a piece of straw
(holding it ruefully) This must be the last straw
(takes one off her back) Here's the one that broke the camel's back
Someone didn't want us to get to the party

Steed, Emma and the Old Lady survey
(checks postcard) Wonderland Weather Ltd
This way
145
-    - On a lawn, a peacock flares its thousand eye tail
, its eyes conceal hidden cameras, recording Emma, Steed and the Old Lady, who've landed inside the walled grounds
They move stealthily forward, unaware
Over here
The Old Lady waves them on
They enter a tunnel into 146 Tall hedges surround Steed and Emma and the Old Lady on all sides
They follow the path, slopes , round, curves, turns into hairpin bends and -turns
At first intrigued
Then perplexed
Emma leads the way, Steed following
The Old Lady slips Steed stops to pick a rose, puts it in his lapel
Emma rushes ahead
Aha
Yes
It's clear now trapezoid shape, dictated by twin diagonal paths and a single curving path
late Seventeenth Century design, originally for King William of Orange, copied
Ah
Steed sees Emma slip 'round a corner
He pursues her
Glimpses her
Then loses her
Another glimpse
Sees her thru hedges, then seemingly -- Thru the other side of the hedge
In two places at once
Mrs
Peel
think 'm seeing double again
Out of sight, Emma rushes on
Around her, the hedges grow taller
She seems to grow smaller
Emma begins to realize things are not what they seem
As she pushes her way thru -- 147 the maze as a formal patter-n
Three tiny figures dart round
: 148
-   - pattern on a screen
The lines of the maze reformulated as abstract lines
Steed, Emma and the Old Lady as three flashing dots
Someone, somewhere is watching them
Laughter, then a familiar voice -- (
) Now this is more like it
149
- Steed searches for an exit
150 Emma sees a statue of a Butler
Which springs to life
Summons Emma
She follows down a path strewn with leaves
As Emma steps on the leaves, she -- Falls down -- a giant rabbit hole
151 Emma spins through darkness, like Alice in Wonderland
Steed
(
) Mrs
Peel
152
- The identical face of Emma on a marble statue, as -- Steed studies the classical statue
Mrs
Peel
Steed hears a noise, turns to see -- Emma walking towards him
She picks the rose from his lapel, slowly coils an arm around his neck
Pulls Steed towards her, closes her eyes -- kisses him full an the mouth
Mrs
Peel
(more kiss) Mrs
Peel
The kiss ends
Steed recovers his composure, lips coated with her lipstick
His tongue traces his lips; smarts
Your lipstick
Poison
He goes dizzy
Steed collapses to the ground
153
- Inside the house, a grand hall
Deserted
cobweb hangs from ceiling
velvet curtain tattered and torn
Emma
the hour
Ahead, the real Emma sees -- giant staircase
There on the stairs -- a glass eye
She picks it up
Puts it in a pocket
Emma goes -- 154 Sees a series of family portraits an the staircase
One of herself in ornate aristocratic regalia
155 Rooms on either side
Emma goes down the hall, pushes doors
156 mad child's collections of
toys
rocking horses
train sets
ventriloquists' dummies
and
Butterflies
scarabs
beetles
glass eyes, staring at her from the blackness
Then Emma turns into a whole room of
Snow shakers
wall of them in glass cabinets like insect specimens or fossils
Emma picks up one snow scene
She shakes it
157 as if in response, a storm gathers
Shadowy clouds roll in
158 drop of rain starts to fall
Steed's eyes flicker open
(re: rain) Not again
He rises, looks down, reacts -- Alice, the Old Lady, lies near him in the maze, her neck snapped
Steed kneels, next to her in the rain It's a trap
Tell Mother, beware
Tell Father
She dies in his arms
Wind picks up, too
Steed looks about, frowning with discouragement -- 159
- and lightning outside
Inside the room of snow shakers, a Emma shakes the snow scene
The weather seems to grow darker
160 Emma hears the unmistakable chilling voice: (
) wouldn't shake that too hard
The weather might turn nasty
From the shadows
a man
silhouette
Behind a distorting lens
His shape and face unclear
Emma puts down the shaker
Quite a collection
(
) If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects

true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass
Outside the big window the weather is turning nasty
Your voice -- it's so familiar
(
) We have met
From the shadows, a man moves out, revealing: Peter Peel, Emma's husband
Peter
Instinctively Emma moves towards him
long pause
must be dreaming
Emma pulls back
Before she can turn, Peter takes her hand, places it over his heart
-, -, -
Listen
Very much alive
Peter touches her hand
Emma looks into his eyes
Intrigued but alarmed, disbelief
Peter raises her hand to his lips
Darling, it's me
Emma shudders, battles with herself
Peter
Emma is tempted, yet filled with terror
161      - ' Inside her pupil -- : 162 His face as he kissed her -- his ring on her finger -the visor cracking -- the glass obscuring his face
163 Impossible
how
Peter smiles disarmingly
As if the answer was obvious
For you
all for you
Peter comes over, folds her in his arms
Takes her head between his hands
Emma leans over to him, about to kiss him, both closing their eyes, until -- Lips parted
Before they kiss, Emma pulls back -- Don't be afraid, darling
She turns, runs to the door
Like a trapped bird
She tries the door -- locked
Another door -- locked
window -- locked
Don't run away
forgive you, Emma
know you left me
But still love you
Do you still have my ring
need it
Peter grabs hold of Emma
She pulls away
Emma sees his face before her, pleading with her
Seductive yet nightmarish
As if hallucinating, Emma runs away, towards -- The big window overlooking the gardens
She runs, leaps, and in   -- Crashes thru the , shards and splinters  all 'round her, as she -- 164
-  - somersaults through the window down to the ground
Lands with a  on the wet ground
Looks up to see -- Steed above her, the
Steed
She struggles to her feet, comes towards him, upset
Oh, no
First time, shame on you
Third time, shame on me
He slugs her and the
(
) Diagnosis confirmed
Mrs
Peel is suffering from delusions and hallucinations
An extreme personality disorder
She imagines her husband Peter Peel has come back to her
Emma's face
(
) classic syndrome, to overcome her subconscious guilt at her other crimes
We've attached her to the dreamscape machine
We'll soon see what her unconscious looks like
Emma's eyes flicker
Steed comes  , sitting by Emma's bed
This time he's eating her grapes
Emma looks around
Everything blurs
Tugs at leather straps
No use
to reveal Emma strapped to a special couch -- Her head surrounded by a plastic dome, terminals and wires leading out into a Dreamscape machine
Drowsy, disoriented
Where am
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists
'm so sorry struck you, Mrs
Peel
Please forgive me
thought you were someone else
Was
(no smile) expect that's for you to know and me to find out
It was Peter --  saw him
Drugged, Emma's eyes drop
-- 165 giant spiral  , creating trippy black and white zig zag op-art effects a la Bridget Riley
She blinks
: 166       - Steed is gone
Dr
Darling leans over her
Emma stares at the hypnodisc
Closes her eyes
167 Thousand REMs per sec -- a tiny chip next to her eyes, transmitting out via wires to -- 168 "Dreamscape" apparatus like a liquid  screen flicks thru random images from Emma's unconscious
Peter Peel -- Teddy Bears -- post card views -- childhood snaps -- 169      "" Dr
Darling furls his hand over Emma's, his fingers resting upon her ring
During the interrogation, he soothingly strokes her hand -- tries to remove the ring without arousing her suspicion
Pulls gently on it
170 In his wheelchair, Mother sits beside Steed
This man -- did you see him
No
Her husband, she says
Alice tried to warn us
trap
Tell Mother beware
Tell Father That's all
171 Dr
Darling leans forward to interrogate Emma
172 He looks and sounds sinister
From a corner of her eye, she sees -- a clip of keys hanging from his pocket

Do you understand

As Emma talks, the "Dreamscape" plucks images from her unconscious in trippy psychedelic rush:  faces -- colors -- patterns flash past
Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers how many pecks of pickled peppers did Peter Peel --
174      - Quietly unclicks a lock
She stops in mid-gabble
How long have  been here
Three days
Emma unlocks her straps
Sits Up
Woozy
Do you get paid by the hour
Dr
Darling is shocked, indignant
Emma rips wires from her body
The "Dreamscape" machine winds down
Up in the gallery -- --
Mother bashes his metal cane on the railings (filtered) You are here under observation, Mrs
Peel
You must answer Dr
Darling's questions Pushes Dr
Darling aside

(filtered) You need treatment, Mrs
Peel
You can't resign
Watch me
Emma staggers
Mother looks at Steed
Who snaps himself out of staring at the hypnodisc
Emma heads for the airlock door marked: "-  --  " Don't open that, Mrs
Peel
Fat chance
she goes in
175
- Emma floats in the air, as Mother, Dr
Darling and Steed all follow
And float helplessly, turning around madly
Trying to gain on Emma
Mother's wheelchair, Steed's umbrella and bowler, all tumble thru the air as Steed tries to reach the "" switch (echoing) What are you trying to do to me
(flailing) We want to help
thought  was a widow
My husband
the only man  ever loved
is dead
For the rest of my life  have to live with that
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss
To us all
To you
Mother looks at Emma
He's let the cat out the bag
Steed finds the "" switch
They all tumble to the floor, Mother landing perfectly in his wheelchair, Steed effortlessly catching his hat and umbrella
He moves to Mother -- think you owe Mrs
Peel an explanation
Steed stares Mother out
Who delivers his revelations
Peter Peel was a first class agent
senior operative
'' department Special operations
He was engaged in top secret research
Top priority
Government approved
The Institute

for us
(beat) 'm sorry
turning moment for Emma
life lived on a lie
So all that time
Our work, our research was for you
for this
And the accident -- It was no accident
The official investigation
was written by me
(beat) It was sabotage, Mrs
Peel
Deadly serious, Emma walks over to him
Who
Quite frankly
it could have been you
Silence
Emma looks away, shocked
Steed intervenes You're accusing Mrs
Peel of killing her own husband
Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation
On the day he died, he was setting a test
To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion
He had to be certain
He said he was going to give Mrs
Peel something
Emma keeps staring at Mother, fingers her diamond ring
want you to remember
Did Peter give you anything on-that day
176      - touches her ring
177 Emma looks up at Mother
barefaced lie
No
Steed notices Emma touch her ring nervously
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was
you who betrayed him
He took a huge risk
The ultimate test
So 'm still
Under suspicion
Everyone died in the explosion, Mrs
Peel
You were the only survivor
Mother waits
Emma turns round
Looks fiercely at him
Mother shifts uneasily as Emma walks past him to the airlock
This is an official matter, Mrs
Peel
No need to take it personally
Where are you going
To find out who killed my husband
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs
Peel
This is a very secure establishment
So am
Emma pushes open the doors
Walks out
Down a corridor
Dr
Darling grabs Mother, as he exits with Steed -- She must remain here
She's highly dangerous
178       - Mother exits with Steed; they watch Emma going
Pity
was growing fond of Mrs
Peel
Unfortunately -- Guilty until proven innocent
Mother and Father know best
Mother wheels himself off
Then stops; over his shoulder: Something quick
Nothing too
messy

The weather forecast: (

Sunny intervals leading to sudden storms and gale warnings for all areas

Steed follows her

Sunlight streams through stained glass, illumining Emma as Steed watches her lay -- red rose by an altar tomb:  an ornate mausoleum two hands clasped in a pose of eternal sleep:  Peter Peel
Emma pauses, as in the b

, choirboys sing hymn practice
Steed watches Emma move away, toward the door
He drops a hymn book
Emma swivels round -- sees Steed
You followed me
Orders
To kill me
(fractional pause) Nothing personal
Emma smiles
Then turns, and -- Runs
Steed follows Emma through a door to -- 186
- Steed enters, glimpses -- Emma above
He follows her
Hears her footsteps
Trip- trapping up the spiral staircase
Steed listens, follows
187 From below, Steed hears a

As debris falls down -- Steed runs up stairs, reaches -- 188
- still
At the top, a sheer drop
Steed edges closer to the ledge
Looks
long way down
From behind -- long way down
Steed swivels
Sees Emma blocking his path
Cool menace
Steed steps away from the edge, Emma circles him
Careful
You might fall
Emma steps to the edge
Steed freezes
Emma locks down
Feet resting on the ledge
Rocking to and fro
could save you the trouble
No trouble
Because you always obey orders
Always
(pause) Except
Steed nears her
Emma pushes herself right to the edge
Yes
when  don't
It comes down to one thing, Mrs
Peel
Trust
Steed reaches out for her
Holds out his hand
And do you trust me
could be convinced, if
knew who poisoned me in the maze
That kiss
It wasn't me; you have my word
Steed snatches her from the edge, holds her in his arms
need proof
Emma thinks
Looks at him
Deadly serious
Their eyes lock
She hesitates, then pecks him on the cheek
It was longer
On the lips
Emma hesitates
Then a kiss on the lips
Longer
But not much
Steed grabs her hand, pulls her back
Much longer
Approximately
fifteen seconds
Emma harumphs, exasperated
Moves closer to him
Ready
Steed nods
Emma leans forward
full kiss
At first reticent
Emma looks at her watch
Counts seconds
Four
seven
ni-
Then
forgets
Warmer, more relenting
Edging towards passionate
They stay embracing for fifteen seconds
(aroused) Mmm
what are you doing
Keeping a stiff upper lip
Is that all
The kiss continues couple of seconds longer
Before Emma withdraws
With an effort, she regains her composure
long silence
So 'm in the clear
Steed savors the kiss
No reply
His smile says it all
But you did suspect me
Not for a moment
You're playing games
Aren't we all, Mrs
Peel
thought you played by the rules
thought you didn't
'm playing to win
Winning isn't everything
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game
(smiles; stands aside) After you -- Mrs
Peel
Steed motions down the stairs
It's close to the edge
No, after you
(back to square one) You don't trust me
As far as you trust me
Emma motions
Steed goes down, passes close to the edge, and swivels round nervously
Emma reads his thoughts
When it happens, Steed, you'll be the first to know
With this comforting thought, Steed descends first

Choirboys walk out from the church

Noise muffled
The Choirboy can't hear Steed and Emma's shouted warnings, as he lifts his hand up, and -- 192 Steed sees him reach out, warns the vicar and choirboys
Get down -- get down -- it's going to explode --
Steed and Emma, all the choirboys hit the dirt, as 193 The Choirboy grabs the phone, and lifts it up, and Silence
No explosion
few seconds pass
Steed and everyone are down on the ground
As they see -- 194 -- the Choirboy leaves the phone hanging
He gets out, scans the crowd
Then walks calmly over to Steed, who's still prone
It's your mother
The vicar and choirboys look on sympathetically, as -- Steed dusts himself off
Emma and everyone gets up
Steed goes to the phone box, takes the call
Mother
How did you find me
His expression changes as he listens
Emma goes to the phone box as Steed rings off
He emerges from the box
told Mother  took care of you
You lied
equivocated
But you're not their big worry at present
It's Dr
Darling:  he's disappeared
Emma's reaction to this news -- 195
- Inside the upper room, in front of a mirror -- With his back turned to us
Dr
Darling holds something in his hand, and waits as -- 196 Bad "Emma" walks over
She stands in front of him
Blank expression
Dr
Darling hardly even looks up
With her hair up, we recognize on her neck a tattoo:  Z424
We are in the final phase
shall require you to be especially obedient
There must be no failures
197      -    - which he grips tightly
As -- 198 a metamorphosis
His features melt and bubble, a mask of plastic surgery and it's slipping around like Michael Jackson's face under kleig lights
He adjusts it, then
Shakes the snowshaker

- as the sky darkens --   to reveal: Steed's Jag, zooming through country lanes
Rain starts
200
- Steed driving, winces with the drizzle
Drat
Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs
Peel
Any idea who
No idea who
No idea why
(thinks) Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things
Or grown-ups, who still like to be children
Quite
Any childhood friends
Enemies
Not to speak of
Peter and were both loners
There was nobody
Steed thinks; sighs
Very well
have a friend who might be of assistance
He's at the Ministry
We'd better be careful
'm a wanted woman,  know
201
- Through a door marked "Information & Counter Espionage" -- -- walks Steed with another man in identical clothes:  dapper Savile Row suit, umbrella and bowler
Which is Emma Peel, in disguise
Steed furtively checks passers-by
His name's Jones
'Invisible' Jones
Why's he called 'Invisible'
You'll find out
At a door marked "Information -- Col
Jones
" Steed knocks, opens the door for her
Aren't you coming
'll catch you up
Don't worry; he's expecting you
Emma goes in as Steed walks down the corridor
202
- room full of archives and files
Emma walks through tall corridors, stacks of cabinets full of old paper
Dusty, musty and mildewing
Long forgotten
Nobody there
Suddenly Emma hears -- She follows them
Round stacks, round corners
The  get
She's closing in
The  get , until up ahead of her -- filing cabinet drawer opens up
On its own
Emma watches as a file pops up, floats through air
The drawer slams shut
Still nobody there
Emma follows the file to a -- Desk
Emma watches as -- the chair swivels round
The file pages open up
Then the phone lifts up by itself, a voice: (
) Tell Miss Proudfoot, no calls
(beat) Colonel Jones at your service, Mrs
Peel
Just a moment -- Emma looks ahead of her
To the chair
As -- desk drawer opens up, a pipe is whisked through the air, a match is struck
The pipe lights; smoke belches forth
(
) Talk to the pipe, Mrs
Peel
That usually helps
Don't worry about me being invisible
Other than that 'm perfectly normal
see
(
) Or rather, you don't
Learnt the tricks in camouflage
Till this accident made a prang of things
How can  help you, Mrs
Peel
203
- Steed on the phone
say, Trubshaw, Steed here
Barometer's falling fast
Mrs
Peel and  find ourselves in need of foul weather gear
(beat) Yes, 'd say gentlemen's snuff for starters
And then -- 204
' File pages flip through the air as Jones goes through them
(
) Ah, here we are
Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel
Peter's brother
But -- (
) Half-brother to be precise
Emma is surprised
(
) Now let's see
Eton, Cambridge
research into robotics and plastics
Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change
know all this
(
) Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance
Surveillance
By whom
(
) Father
She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr
Darling
Who's now vanished
(
) Makes two of us
Are you suggesting that Dr
Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together
But that's absurd
Steed enters behind them on the run -- We must hurry, Mrs
Peel
Hurry
What for
'm just now -- You didn't tell her
(
) (testy) was getting to it
Getting to what
(
) The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative -- fail to see -- There's a reception this evening
Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend
Have we been invited
(
) (poker-voiced) Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but  think  can get you in
(surveys her male outfit) Well,  can't possibly go like this
had a feeling
That's why we're in a hurry
Steed proffers an arm to Emma
May  have the honor, Mrs
Peel
She decides, takes his arm
You may, Mr
Steed
The -team is born
Steed and Emma tip their hats to Jones
205
-   - Troops rushing in to take up defense positions
Searchlights pierce the cloudy sky protective ring of hardware surrounds the hall

' 22  (   ) - At the controls, Brenda looks on
She hands a bag of jelly babies to Mother
Who picks out his favorites, as he gives a briefing to Father and others, sitting in passenger seats -- as -- Inside that hall are some of the Most powerful figures in the world
Tight security
Our only option
'll see to it personally
Brenda glances over at Father's imperturbable face
As -- 207
() - Wind picking up
Outside the grand palace hall for the reception of the World Council of Ministers, guards stand on duty
Barriers, flashing lights
Nobody gets past, except -- 208
() - Up in the gallery, Steed and Emma enter through a secret passage behind a painting
He with bowler and umbrella
She in black leather and boots
They find themselves in a niche and freeze, very close to one another
Steed sniff s
What's that you're wearing
It's called Black Leather
Intoxicating
Here, have one of these
He fumbles with a bulging jacket pocket What is it
Limpet bomb
Small, very compact
From Trubshaw's
(hocks it on belt) When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit
You first
Shall we
She leads the way through marble halls, arched galleries, red velvet carpets, glittering chandeliers
From the hall, a  : (
) In the uncertain climate that threatens this global initiative, no magic umbrella can shield us
Steed checks out his own
(
) Only our own vigilance
Security and stability are our watchwords
Steed pauses, offers Emma a small silver box
Inside
Trubshaw again
What now
Snuff
(off Emma's lock) must insist you try some
Steed takes some; Emma follows his example
Weird
Does it make you high
They walk on, open doors to -- 209
- An empty gallery
Steed and Emma peer down at a -- 210 black and white floor
Butlers move across like surreal chess pieces
Otherwise, empty
chamber ensemble plays "The Merry Widow" waltz, which floats through empty halls
They're playing your song, Mrs
Peel
(annoyed) 'The Merry Widow
'  might have known
Where's the reception
They move cautiously forward as 211
- Outside, snow begins to fall
Trees and buildings shimmer under a light layer of white
Christmassy glow -- Even troops play with snowflakes, until -- 212 The wind rises
The snow falls harder
213
- Down in the hallway, Steed and Emma search for the Ministers
They head down a corridor, then hear a
They hide behind pillers
As -- Butlers walk past in military file, carrying elaborate displays of lobster and meats
Steed steals -- chicken leg
Nibbles on it
Suddenly another door opens -- Emma hides
Steed looks up to see -- Father "staring" at him
Oh, hello
We want Mrs
Peel
Dead, 'm afraid
Emma in hiding, listens as -- (
) You disobeyed an order, Steed
Mrs
Peel is dangerous; she cannot be trusted
Emma looks out the window behind her; eyes widen
back to -- (
) think she can
(beat) Can you
Emma is deeply affected by Steed's choice
Father's face, meantime, has turned to stone
shall summon security
She turns, almost walks into the door as she slips away
Emma returns as the  is raised -- Bad news
Father's looking for you
Where are those bloody ministers
Have a look at this
She leads him to the window:  sure enough -- heavy snow
Steed reacts, eyes wide
It's almost May, for heaven sake
214
- The blizzard rages through streets -- Now impassable
Snow drifts block roads
White mountains of snow start to climb up shop fronts
And amid the sky -- Filled with snowflakes, up round the roofs, a purple cloud descends on unsuspecting troops -- 215
- Steed returns, rushes across the marble halls -- To Emma
But up ahead, sees -- 216     '  - purple fog seeping into the hallway, billowing through the corridors as -- 217
- Inside an anteroom, like a Roman arena -- marble pillars, red carpet, golden walls, ceiling murals -- The World Council ministers assemble:  slick pin-striped suits or African robes, Chinese Mao-suits, Indian Nehru-jackets, all distinguished men and women, surrounded by -- Fussing officials, minor dignitaries, and butlers, bowing and weaving a web of diplomatic protocol, interrupted by -- 218 The sight of Emma Peel in black leather
She strides into the room
Picks a glass of champagne from a passing butler
All stare, Emma raises her glass -- Gentlemen, ladies
Forgive the breach of protocol
An emergency -- From the hallway --  --
The door bursts open, Emma is blown over by the blast as the purple cloud races inside
219 as the smoke furls around the ministers, they choke, fall
From the doors -- Steed leaps in, gives Emma another snort of snuff -- Quick --it'll protect you -- Emma inhales
Now immune to the gas, Steed and Emma hear --  --
They see -- through thick cloud -a mysterious man in a white lab coat, wearing a gas mask, leading a group of butlers, all in gas masks -- heads like black flies -- in formation round the ministers, helpless on the floor
kidnapping -- The man and butlers haul away several ministers, and -- Escape from the rear doors
The butlers form a guard to protect the man
Steed and Emma run after them
More butlers pursue
220
- As troops roll helplessly in the snow-covered purple haze, the butlers load the ministers onto waiting choppers as -- 221
'  - Mother, Brenda, et al choke on purple smoke in the bus
222
- Behind pillars, Steed and Emma hide as -- Butlers in gas masks patrol the halls
butler passes them without noticing
They try to emerge
But another patrols -- Steed trips the butler with his umbrella, then chops him down on the ground
He rises but Emma kicks him into as -- Behind them Steed sees the lab-coated man escape up the stairs, protected by a posse of butlers
He shouts -- After him, Mrs
Peel
whole posse of butlers then advances
Steed faces them
Go --
Emma hesitates
Then turns, heads for an ornate dual shaft elevator
She bangs the button, gets inside, doors shut, as the  from - gas masked butlers strike the brass door as -- Steed whips his rapier from his umbrella and duels with the butlers
To give Emma time, he uses every trick and prop at his disposal, plus, brute force to -- Kick, chop, punch, and impale them into submission, as -- 223
( ) - The posse of butlers fan out on to keep pace with Emma
They head upstairs, pressing elevator "" buttons on every floor, as -- 224 Emma waits inside
Until she reaches -- 225
(2ND ) - Doors open
of  hit the lift as Emma hides to one side until the doors close
226
- Emma sighs with relief
as the  rises
227       - Steed gaining on the butlers, heading for the stairs, as -- 228
- At the next floor, the doors open -- Two butlers rush inside
--
Emma cuts one in the throat with an elbow punch,  then -- Punches -- kicks -- stabs the other butler, a more brutish type, who recovers enough to grab Emma by the throat
She chokes, breaks his stranglehold, swerves him round, gains a nelson hold on his arms and throat -- And a knee in his back in time for -- The   at -- 3rd floor where -- Emma spins her captive butler round, in time to face -- Whooomph
a blast of fire from -- flamethrower launched in the hall
Aaargh --
The butler gets fried, but -- 229
(3RD ) - Shields Emma from the worst of the blast
She  hurls him clear of the doors, which -- 230
- Slam shut
231
- Steed continues his one-sided duel with the other butlers, skewering madly, trying to get upstairs to help Emma
232
- Up Emma goes
Looks for an escape route
Bangs on the walls
No trap doors
No secret panels
The "floor" light flickers between floors
Waiting, until
233
(4TH ) - The doors open
grenade is hurled inside the doors, it rolls to one corner, Emma dives to the other side, then -- Scrambles for the grenade
Picks it up
It slips out of her hands
Scrambles more
It slips out
Just beyond the elevator doors
Which start to shut
Emma leans out a foot, kicks the grenade towards the butlers, and -- As her elevator doors close -- --
It  among the butlers, one of whom -- Rushes to -- 234      (5TH ) - Where he waits for the elevator
Removes pin
Grenade ready
The light
Doors open
About to throw it inside, when -- 235     ' No Emma
236 The butler hesitates
Looks inside
Still no Emma
He wonders what to do, and -- The doors shut; he jams his foot
The doors open again
He moves in -- 237
- -- and looks round
Nobody there
Until, as we -- to reveal --  , spread-eagled like an  on the elevator roof, limbs flexed against the walls is -- Emma, who -- drops down and -- Scissors the butler's head between her legs
The grenade rolls free
Emma twists around, grabs his ears, and -- Sits on his face
Buries his head in her crotch
muffled sound from the guy, until -- Emma scissor kicks, breaking his neck
She drags -- 238
(67H ) - His head out
Leaving his neck between the doors
So as she leaps out, heads up for the stairs, the elevators doors
And --
His  rocks the elevator, which 239
-    - Breaks from its ropes, and -- Plummets down the elevator shaft, shaking the building as it crashes -- 240
- Everything shakes with the impact of the elevator as Steed battles his way up, step by step, throwing gas-masked butlers over his shoulder as he struggles
241
- Up the winding staircase, at the top, a skylight, which -- Flips open
The man leaps out, throwing back inside a smoke grenade, and locks the skylight
As the grenade -- 242 explodes in the narrow staircase, fills it with purple smoke
Emma rushes thru smoke, choking
She gets to the skylight, tries to open it -- locked
moment's panic
Then Emma -- punches a hole in the glass, flicks the switch, flips the skylight up, and -- Emerges into the night air
Snowflakes tumble around her
243
-  - Blades whirling
Amid the blizzard, the man ready to escape in a super-fab streamlined whirly chopper
Another assassin attacks Emma, pins her on her back, overlooking the city
Stands up before her -- Emma held back over gargoyle, over now snow white city
Knees assassin in balls
Flicks him backwards
As his body hurtles down into the snow-covered streets, Emma rushes forward
But too late:  sees -- The chopper -- about to take off
244 The gas-masked  in the white lab coat: Goodbye, Mrs
Peel
245 The chopper rises slowly
Emma looks
fifteen foot leap
Impossible
246 farewell wave from the gas-masked man
247      - contemplating the jump, beneath falling snowflakes, as the distance grows
248     ' The rope/chain ladder coils into the chopper's belly
249
- Above London rooftops, after dark -- The man (still wears gas mask) the Pilot, - and a Butler (ditto)
From the chopper, a giddy look down thru a glass command module
fairy tale, snow white city
the , interference
changing of stations
Then a broadcast of "The Merry Widow
" As the  serenades them high above the city  -- a  from outside on the door -- Surprised reactions
The Butler opens the door, sees -- Emma hanging onto the helicopter struts
The Butler is too dumbstruck to say anything
(shouts, re:  the gas mask) Anyone ever tell you you look like a housefly
Emma grabs his epauletted shoulder, yanks him up, flicks him out -- The Butler is jerked out -- flies into the open air
Emma watches him fall
Anyone else need a lift
The white-coated Man moves forward, but Emma is out, slamming the door, still clinging
(to Pilot; intercom) Can't you throw her off
The Pilot nods, works controls, the chopper dips as -- Blam --
a kinky leather boot crashes -- Into the Pilot's face as Emma kicks in the  from the front of the chopper, so the Pilots can't see -- a sudden rush of cold air -- The    round as the Pilots struggle for control -- (
) (intercom) Where'd she go
250
-   - with the blades whirling directly over her head, Emma crawls over the top of the chopper and lets herself down the other side as London's lights twinkle beneath
As the Co-Pilot pokes his head out of the cockpit -- Emma grabs him with one hand, hoists him up into the air -- The Co-Pilot dangles over the city
Grabs Emma
Slithers back onto the cockpit
Pistol whips her
Emma crunches back onto the metal
Blades whirring close
The co-Pilot peers into her eyes from inside the gas mask -- - Happy landings, Mrs
Peel
He raises his hand, ready to hit her again, Emma yanks him up, where his head get sliced off by the blades -- body and head fall away separately
As Emma reacts, her legs are grabbed from below and the white-coated Man pulls her down the side of the chopper -- Emma falls, but manages a flying handhold, hangs onto the chain wire below the chopper
As -- 251
- The Pilot and his passenger zoom at low level over buildings
Trying to dislodge Emma
252 Thru the blizzard, zooming down streets, landmark buildings looming up topped in snow, feet up
shinnying up the chain wire
"   ," no longer heard as old record or ensemble arrangement but enormous, for
253      - grimly hoists herself up along the struts again, hand over hand, coming up to the cockpit from behind -- 254 With a sudden movement, she yanks the Pilot out from behind and he goes flying towards eternity on his own
The chopper out of control as the white-coated Man is left to fly it himself
255 "  " , the chopper lurches, spinning round -- up and down, over spiraling corkscrews, an insane waltz
256
-   - The white-coated Man gets control
257
-   - Zig-zags down a narrow street, trying to smash Emma into sides of windows
258 as Emma bounces of buildings, holding on for dear life
259
-   - The chopper dips down, dragging Emma through icy water
Up ahead
Tower Bridge
twin peaks
a firework display going on
rockets and lights in the sky thru snowflakes
Emma sees the bridge coming, reaches down and -- 260 Detaches her pocket limpet bomb and lobs it into the chopper cockpit
261 The bridge looms up, chopper rising to cross it as Emma leaps onto the bridge
262
-   - The Man sees the bomb
Also flings himself onto the bridge as -- Against b
g
of the fireworks display -- 263       -   -   - -- the
Ball of flames
The crowd roars in appreciation
great fireworks
264
-   - Emma picks herself up, sees the Man in the white lab coat and runs for him
He runs too -- towards -- 265 which unloads a rope ladder as Emma puts on every ounce of steam
The Man reaches for the dangling ladder -- but -- 266      - stuck, wedged between narrow battlements
267 The Man looks at his shoe, at Emma charging towards him, at the rope ladder
He pulls his foot out of his shoe and grabs the ladder, sailing off in the second chopper, leaving Emma panting behind
She's soaked, frozen, gasping for breath, bending over, when she sees -- 268      - Emma pulls it from its wedge, looks at the inside:  --  "Trubshaw's of Jermyn Street
" (
) thought it was Cinderella who lost her slipper
269
' - On Jermyn Street, snow lies waist high
Searchlights announcements urge citizens to stay indoors
to reveal a fire glows, a calmly
Emma sits with her shoe, surrounded by a pile of shoes
Steed & Trubshaw beside her
This time the shoe's on the other foot
You said a hand-made shoe was as good as a photo-fit or Well, all we have to do is find the shoe that fits
It should be easy
Trubshaw client has his shoes delivered personally
The Ministry should be able to confirm our delivery
'll be back
Where are you going
Laying in supplies, Mrs
Peel weather may get very nasty and 've no umbrella
You needn't bother
can't drag you further into this
After all,  am still the chief suspect
No bother
Mother and Father think 've joined you
might as well
But -- (comes back) Oh, and by the way,  think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder
If you'd been through what  have, you wouldn't -- Steed reaches and pulls off the micro-bug from her shoulder
microtag
One of Mother's little toys
There you are
Free at last
He tips his bowler off her surprised reaction
270
'  - An armory
Steed stands before racks of umbrellas, displayed like ceremonial swords -- ivory handles, duck handles, you name it
Steed hefts a few, as picky as a Samurai
271      - Emma surrounded by a mountain of shoes
Triumphantly, she holds up a pair of shoe lasts
Prince Charming,  presume
Your name is
272 with the name:
Oh my God
273
' -  - Steed selects his umbrella and we   : 274
' -  - He sees only Trubshaw
Where's Mrs
Peel
She just left, sir
In a hurry
What
She said you'd understand
275 Worried
(
) Ah, here we are
276      -    - to reveal: 277
- Inside the archives, among leather volumes
file goes through the air, passed to Emma
As she reads
map is opened across a desk from her
(
) '' marks the spot
The shoes were delivered to
an island in Hyde Park
Surrounded by the Serpentine
On the site of a former Ministry installation
and now
(
) Privately owned by
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather
(
) Very good, Mrs
Peel
shall need a small plane
(
) You're not venturing alone, surely
'm going to find out who killed my husband
Will you take these documents to Steed
(
) Of course
278 Tell him  said
goodbye
279
- below the Thames as at the beginning
In darkest paranoia, Mother lies at the heart of his Labyrinth
Controls around him flash emergency
Panic
Cakes piled up beside him, uneaten
Beside him, Father
Brenda hands a phone
Steed for you
Mother grabs the phone, furious
Where's Mrs
Peel
He signals frantically for Father to trace the call, but being blind, Father just sits there
(
) (filtered) was hoping you could tell me
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son
Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am
(
) (filtered) 'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own
If 'm right, Mrs
Peel is innocent and you have a mole
(grabs mirror; searches his face) Where
(
) (filtered) In your operation
'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs
Peel, walks like Mrs
Peel and kills like Mrs
Peel
The line goes dead
280 Furious
Steed
(to Father) Find Mrs
Peel
Brenda smiles at the thought
Father rises, grim
281
- Through mist, an ultralight plane zooms down -- From the plane, Emma leaps in parachute
Down, down, down through the mist
Over parkland, the parachute floats down
To an island in the middle of the Serpentine river
282
( ) - Emma lands, buries her parachute
Walks towards a thick jungle, then a stream
Emma hops across on water lilies until she reaches land again
Where a peacock fans its tail of a thousand eyes
of
In the midst of the jungle, Emma sees -- 283 red phone box
Emma frowns in recognition; goes inside
Picks up the phone
Presses "Button ", and -- The floor goes down
Emma goes down with it, into -- 284 Formerly a Ministry installation
The "elevator" stops
Remembering, as from a dream, Emma steps out into -- 285 patrols
Emma pushes herself against a wall
The wall gives way to flip round, and Emma swivels into -- 286 The door locks behind
Alone, Emma stands warily
From nowhere, a chilling, disembodied voice
Intimate
Seductive
(
) Congratulations, Mrs
Peel
You have been a worthy opponent
You have tracked us down
You are within an ace of winning
This isn't a game
(
) Quite right, but we still make the rules
Rules are made to be broken
(
) People, too
Then who wins
You and
Together
But first you must confront your greatest enemy
Who could that be, Mrs
Peel
The answer is obvious
Suddenly lights
Emma is in a hall of mirrors
(
) Yourself
In every direction Emma turns, a thousand reflections of herself stare back at her, splintered into fragments as Emma spins, freaked and confused by the multiple images
Emma turns into herself -- only herself drapes arms around her and kisses her on the lips
Bad Emma -- whose eyes stare into Emma's startled ones as Emma pulls her mouth away, staggers back; realizes too late
The hallucinogenic lip poison
Emma crumples to her knees as -- 287     ' Sees "herself" above her, before she -- falls unconscious
288
- Steed's Jag races, skids in bad weather
289 Behind the wheel Steed, his face grim, concentrates on the slippery road
On the seat next to him the snow shaker with little Emma inside -- : 290
As if in a dream, Emma awakes captive inside a bizarre cage:   life size snow shaker
Emma "swims" in viscous air,	suspended like a mermaid
Thru glass she sees -- face peering in:  Father
(filtered) Emma in Wonderland
Welcome, Mrs
Peel
(filtered) We've been expecting you
We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us
Decontamination is almost complete
Decontamination --
And you've a new wardrobe
He does want you to look attractive
(beat ) He tells me you're very beautiful
Emma pounds the glass in frustration
Relax, Mrs
Peel
We're hundreds of feet below ground
The Ministry made it impregnable
No one can save you
291
- as Steed drives towards it
292
- Bathed in candlelight
romantic supper for two
door opens, admitting -- Emma
Dressed, coiffed, super-glamorous
She locks around, sees another door
In search of escape she hastens to open it, only to reveal -- giant rabbit -- the one we saw at the Teddy Bear meeting
Emma gasps in surprise, moves back into the room as he advances, removing the head -- it's Dr
Darling
Emma, my dear
How lovely you look
He steps out of the rest of his costume
Would that  could say the Same
Ah, but you haven't see the real me
Watch closely
He pulls at his face, which bubbles and collapses as he walks towards her -- Emma's horrified expression, eyes widening as -- Dr
Darling turns into
Peter
Peter
Darling Emma -- It was you
all the time
Not really
Not quite
'm afraid you still don't see
Again he claws at his face, pulling, twisting
Emma winces at the sight, her eyes popping out of her head
It's Valentine
(
) Valentine Peel
293
- beneath Gothic turrets pupils in top hats and tails
(
) Yes,  remember him quite well
windows to reveal:  Steed and an   in the beautiful library
This is where he used to spend his days
We have an old photograph somewhere
He's flipping through yearbooks, then shows Steed -- 294      - of Valentine Peel on stage, in wizard's garb
Made up as an old man
295 Absolute wizard with makeup
His favorite roll from Shakespeare
Prospero
'The Prospero Project
' From The Tempest
banished duke, ousted by his brother, marooned on a magic island
Who controlled the weather
296      - grim
' Brave New World that hath such people in it
' 297 Emma frozen, sinks into a chair, staring
You
Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project
He walks around the dinner table as he talks
But you died -- in the explosion
298      - Twisting the dial
the arm to reveal Valentine
(
) Oh, no
arranged the explosion
299 slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition
Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy
(stunned) Dr
Darling, Peter
all you
An unholy trinity
(stands) You killed my husband
For starters
Of course  had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well
Too many cooks -- Spoil the majority shareholders
In Wonderland Weather
planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you
But  found you
All the clues led me here
Of course
planned that, too
But -- why
You disappoint me, Emma
Can't you guess
(moves toward her) For you
It was all for you
(cold) 'Our revels now are ended
' Oh, no, Emma
They've only just begun
300
'  - The phone hangs in the air -- with the smoking pipe
(
) The shoes were delivered to an island in the Serpentine - former Ministry installation
she said to tell you goodbye
What
301      -     () - said it's not goodbye yet
Listen, 'm going to need some help
In a hurry
302
- (indicates supper) Think of this as your second wedding feast
'm already married
Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow
Now  think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid
Here
He pushes a button
Bad Emma enters
Tattooed Z424
Unmistakably hostile
My latest model
compound of plastics and sensor chips
big improvement on the old X404s
The poor thing is quite fond of me
Emma, say hello to Emma
, a strange mix of  and
You know,  believe she's actually jealous
Valentine, listen to me
Right, bridesmaid
Now what have  left out
Oh, yes,  know: the ring
(covers her hand) Ring
He stands very near her -- she's terrified -- then: How silly of me -- let me make you comfortable first
As he advances,     Emma's eye : 303
( ) - Another ball,  to reveal, from the lake, an odd eight foot high plastic ball emerges -- The ball lands on the shore
From the inside, a zip peels away the plastic layer to reveal -- Steed, like an urban dandy in suit and bowler
rose in his lapel
He steps out, and, poking with his umbrella -- Deflates the inflatable plastic submarine
Steed heads off --   the peacock swivel towards him, as he heads into the jungle where he sees the -- 304 Steed picks up the phone
Presses all the buttons until he hits "Button
"  As the floor lowers, his eyes widen in surprise
305 carved in Emma's likeness
Lowered from the ceiling hydraulically into -- 306
' -   - as Valentine descends spiral steps to join it
Valentine opens the coffin to reveal Emma strapped within
That's better
say, isn't this where you came in
It's impenetrable, by the way
You're mad
Entirely
On the other hand (he advances towards her, smiling) Mad people get things done
Let me show you -- 307
- Steed stealing down a corridor and -- hides, as a posse of guards rushes past, alerted by the peacock cameras
He waits till they pass, then reaches out his umbrella, and -- Nabs Father around the neck who was feeling her way after them
Brings her down
Steed How did you guess
You reek of Mrs
Peel's Black Leather
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance
you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry
Mother betrayed me
She was going to replace me with a younger Father
Errand boy that's all  was
'Find Steed
' Well, you found me
Have a sniff of this, why don't you
Careful, the scent can be overpowering
Holding Father securely, Steed forces her nose into his rose boutonniere, squeezes the rubber tube, sprays a Mist
Father passes out
Steed rises, locks around
Sees -- grille and removes it, climbs in and replaces it before the guards return
He turns and -- 308
- crawls forward through a mass of wires and plumbing -- until he hears a  -- '
Steed reaches another grille, through which he can see -- 309 Emma's coffin, standing on end, like the Iron Maiden faces a wall of  monitors as Valentine explains
People expect weather to be free
They're used to it
call that a denial of freedom
No freedom of choice
An abuse of human rights
They buy water, electricity, gas
Why shouldn't they be able to buy their own weather if they want to
If they have a little incentive
Emma reacts -- also Steed (unseen) behind her
Such as
Destruction of their local weather systems
can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air
The result would be
Chaos
Transport paralysis
Crop failure
Economic disaster
Frostbite or sunburn
on a massive scale
You've seen a few samples
Then what's stopping you
One very small thing
diamond 'cyclone' chip
thousand times more information on a fraction of the size
If  possess that, my powers would be unlimited
My dear half-brother was developing it
But he suspected sabotage
He gave the chip to
you, 'Mrs
' Peel
want you
But also your ring
Valentine takes her by the hand
Kisses -- 310      - diamond
In the light, a patterned imprint
-- a complex fractal equation of circuits
311 The missing piece of the jigsaw
tried to get you to give it to me as Peter;  tried to steal it from you as Dr
Darling
As myself 'll be a bit less subtle
(he slips it off her finger; holds it up) With this ring my plan will be complete
How Wagnerian
Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own
That would have amused Peter
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name
You'll always be Mrs
Peel
What are my choices
Choices
'll never marry you
Valentine is philosophical
He spins the sarcophagus on an axis, lying it flat -- Emma lying in her coffin as he looks down at her -- One out of two isn't bad
'll keep you alive, darling Emma
In a year or five, you may change your mind
If you're still in it
Valentine presses a button
From the ceiling -- a surgical laser
Moves down to within inches of her face
This little toy gave me back my face
It can replace yours
What do you think
Medusa
Madame Defarge
Maggie Thatcher
He marks an imaginary line round Emma's face
An
Emma reacts
(
) Dr
Darling, this is Father
We have an intruder
repeat -- Valentine switches off the
Ah
That will be Steed
He followed you
Please excuse me
have work to do
My most spectacular performance
ballet of clouds
It was made for you
want to give you a heart, Emma
want all of London to see it
And now with this
(flourishes ring) They will
(leans close) And for an encore: the biggest cyclone in history will wipe the City from the face of the earth
(winks) Shape of things to come, my darling
He stuffs a gag into Emma's mouth and closes the coffin on her muffled protests
Darkness
Immediately, Steed tries to force his way through the grille
No such luck
Blast
What to do
Mrs
Peel
He doesn't dare say her name too loud -- and there's no telling if she could hear him in that thing, anyway
He turns around in the tunnel -- heads the other way
312
- Moonlight night
Dark clouds approach like an army, spreading shadows
313 and , static energy waiting to explode
In the sky -- clouds join together like a genie from a lamp, forming -- over the city -- a strange dark sensuous figure, half human, half dreamlike
That stalks the city
314
- Steed crawling
rat runs over him
The things  do for England
Pitch dark, then -- Emma's coffin is opened and we see Bad Emma, looking down
Bad Emma stares at her human double -- Emma: who looks imploringly at her to undo the gag
Bad Emma removes it, she -- Runs a finger down Emma's body, inside a hole torn in the leather -- warm human flesh
Blood
Her flesh
Her blood
Fascinated
You must let me go
Bad Emma listens
Gently lays her head on Emma's breast, listens to -- the
Ba-boom
Ba-boom
Don't you understand
If he has me, he'll have no use for you
he'll destroy you
The words jolt Bad Emma back, remembering her mission
She goes to the laser, aims it at Emma's face
No
Bad Emma hesitates, looks strangely human as -- 315
The grille pops off and Steed emerges where the guards are waiting for him -- Oh, dear
No escape
He takes off his bowler -- deftly removes a strip from its brim, aims it at the guards, and -- Hurls it
316      -  ( ) glinting razor's edge, which -- Swoosh --
Slices into the closest guard before returning, like a boomerang to Steed
He taps twice hard steel as
317 run towards him, Steed swivels gracefully and - slams the bowler in their faces, a sartorial knuckleduster -- wham --
One drops -- Bam --
The other collapses, slump to the ground
Steed stoops down, picks up his hat, sees -- dent in its steel top
For the first time, Steed loses his cool
Genuine rage
Someone's going to pay for this
Stepping over the nearest body, Steed moves on his way, as -- 318      - places a ring inside a control module filled with identical-looking diamond chips
to reveal
319
- Masses of dials and switches
( Off to one side, on a wall, a rack of rapiers
) Valentine hits a switch
Start the countdown
Action stations
Five minutes
The countdown starts, red digitals going backwards -- Colorized computer screens map out hostile weather fronts
to
The
Father enters behind him
Congratulations
The clouds are on course
To explode
London will be ashes
Not yet
They haven't heard our terms
Father tries to hit the switch
Valentine yanks her off
Are you insane
Stop the program and you activate the auto-destruct
But all those people --
Valentine strikes her hard -- My cloud ballet
My cyclone
Father slides to the floor
Valentine ignores her
Concentrates on the control panel red lights, as -- 320
- Up in the sky, more white clouds -- Darken into boiling black
They move and billow
Bubbling with gases and energy Swirling with motion, a life of their own
river, a scarlet fog floats upwards
It gains mass and weight, slowly forming as it rolls -- 321 then   them -- into a weird pulsating red shape
love heart
322      - Whirling backwards
323
'   - Mother at the controls
the
Panic stations as --
and  -- Dense cloud formation moving south- west
On course for the center of the city
fog floating in from the river
The prediction is
unstable chemical reaction
Enforce the curfew
Emergency stand by
324
- Bad storm clouds advance over London
black and furious
325       - As shadows in a whirl of chemical matter
An airborne  of static
The black shape now -- Forming a sensuous female shape
Like a dream wisp of
Emma Peel with an hourglass figure
While -- 326 The heart-shaped cloud seems to -- move towards the black genie shape -- trying to connect, to form the cyclone
327
-   - Action stations
Like a re-run Blitz
Streets now eerily empty and dark
Through deserted streets -- Troops race to positions in gas masks
Searchlights illuminate clouds
Worried faces watch the skies, as -- 328      - Fly
329
-   - Chaos on all  monitors as
Valentine hastens down the spiral steps and opens Emma's coffin
What will he find
Emma's there, still gagged
Looks asleep
My dear
(pulls the gag: kisses her) wouldn't want you to miss the grand finale
Emma opens her eyes
Valentine looks down at her, until -- a tell-tale sign:  Z424
Bad Emma is unmistakable
He strikes her -- yanks her out of the coffin
Find her
Kill her
He races back upstairs as
330
-   - Emma makes her way through the labyrinthine superstructure of the place, crawling high on a girder over some   below
She hears   the Suddenly -- 331
-  - Steed battles more guards
No time to lose
Wham --
Bam --
Now moving with deadly earnest, Steed downs all oncomers, closing in on -- 332
- Steed rushes in,  the  behind
Pounding on door
He sees the timer racing backwards -- stands over the controls, trying to figure out how to stop the program
Looks for the chip -- amongst all the rest it's like trying to find a contact lens in water
333     - opens behind
Valentine emerges, drops the   with a
Steed whirls
John Steed
Valentine Peel
see you've gone back to using your original face
The last one you'll ever see
Perish the thought
Valentine fulls forth a rapier from the wall
Did they tell you at Eton that was fencing champion, too
Steed unsheathes his umbrella, revealing ditto
They said you were a very naughty boy
The fight is on as the numbers grow smaller
334 You're better than  expected
was at Harrow
But did they teach you this
Valentine whacks the blade off Steed's umbrella handle
Laughs
diminished phallic symbol
Steed, dumbfounded
Valentine advances towards Steed -- Who points the umbrella at him
Bang-bang
you're dead
You wish
He moves to close in, when
335      - from the muzzle, as a   out, and -- 336 recoils
Blood streams from his shoulder
He looks up, devastated
Steed blows smoke away from the muzzle
One shot -- for emergencies
(clutches wound) That's not playing by the rules
(echoes Emma
) Rules are made to be broken
(pulls his own gun) If you say so
do
He  again
To the heart
Valentine spins to the floor
You said
one shot
Did
My mistake
Steed turns to the console, tries to figure out how to stop the countdown, when behind the hatch opens again, revealing Emma
Valentine pulls her up, grabs her as hostage -- wouldn't do that, if  were you
Steed turns
Mrs
Peel --
Valentine has Emma, a knife to her throat, stands over the hatch
Bullet-proof waistcoats -- just the thing
get mine from Trubshaw's
We'll be off now, won't we, darling
(to Steed) We wouldn't want to miss the fireworks
Figure it out if you can, Steed
337 Valentine drags Emma, bolting the hatch
338 He's torn briefly, but there are thousands of lives at stake; Steed goes to the control module and starts pulling out chips, looking
339
-   - The biggest cyclone you've ever seen starts slowly whirling above the city, gathering momentum
340 going down, down, down, as
341
- Valentine drags Emma backwards
342
-   - The cyclone picking up force
343      - ' pull up a chip
The red numbers freeze
to reveal
344
- The
Steed allows himself a smile of relief
345
-   - The giant cyclone begins to break apart
346       - 347      - Troops pulling off gas masks as
348
-   - Steed sees the breakup of the cyclone
Then -- behind him -- an ominous - as the  reconfigures
and the words: "-, 3 " start flashing
different set of numbers start running backwards
You must be joking
349
- Valentine, dragging Emma, reacts to the new
Fool
In his hesitation, Emma suddenly makes her move
struggle -- Emma takes a bad fall down a landing below
Ugly
Dead
That will do
He's materialized across the girder from Valentine
Who pulls his revolver
Aren't you forgetting about something
You are, and it's behind you
Come, come
You don't really expect me to fall for -- Bad Emma's arms go 'round Valentine in a lethal embrace
Let go, you
idiot
Uh uh
She holds him in a vice-like grip
Hugging Valentine
think she really likes you
Where's Mrs
Peel
Ugh
As the life is squeezed out of him, Bad Emma finally smiles
Cradled together, she chokes Valentine, who gasps for breath, as -- One last desperate move on his part and Bad Emma tumbles backwards, Valentine locked in her arms in a dying embrace
They fall into the mists and liquid below
Steed almost falls himself as he grabs a beam for support
Looks down, sees
350 Dead
Emma
He has said her name
He scrambles down to her body
Emma lying sprawled out on the ground
Steed picks up her limp body in his arms like "Sleeping Beauty
"  His eyes fill with tears
He lays her down
Emma
He produces Peter's ring
351      - Slips it onto her finger and
352 Kisses her
chaste kiss on the lips
But with the force and passion of a lover
He closes his eyes, looks away in grief
The    but Steed doesn't give a damn
Behind, Emma opens her eyes
As if revived by the kiss
Or the ring
Looks up at him
Steed
Steed looks back at her -- surprise, delight
Mrs
Peel
What kept you
The plot
(realizing) Hello, we must be going
353      - - Racing backwards as
354 Steed pulls Emma through the catwalks and corridors of Valentine's Labyrinth
355 racing to zero, nothing to stop them
356
- Steed and Emma race in -- she sees the sarcophagus
Quick
Emma scrambles in and Steed leaps on top of her, bringing down the lid as
357 3-2-1 -- and a  like a nuclear  -- as the Underground  is fragmented to smithereens -- Emma's " coffin" goes flying
as the 358
- Beneath the clear moonlight, all bulbs on -- like Xmas
359 it floats the coffin -- which opens, revealing
Steed and Emma, squashed together, gasping for breath
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -' '
in a beautiful pea green boat
' fine night, Mrs
Peel
Still a bit chilly
English weather
You know, after all we've been through,  should say we deserve a long holiday
Have you any place in mind
As a matter of fact  have
The coffin drifts downstream in the moonlight
: 360
- 				360 few weeks later
Across snowy wastes, a pack of Huskies drag a sled behind them, by a -- Frozen fur-clad Siberian peasant
As he turns a corner, dogs stumble from ice and snow into -- 361 The peasant stops, stares
362 Sun beats down
tropical beach
warm sea
butler, Trubshaw
a From a tent, he brings two glasses down the beach to 363      - Where Steed and Emma toast in the sun
Steed in a smoking jacket, Emma in a bikini
don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed
It's the latest thing, Mrs
Peel
Our little paradise -- just made for two
(looks; frowns) Not quite
On cue from the water, Mother emerges, snorkeling in his wheelchair contraption -- with Brenda
He waves to -- Our chaperon
Pity your mother came, too
Steed seems peeved that his chance to be alone with  is spoiled
Trubshaw pours glasses of champagne
Still a little warm, Trubshaw
Is this the '28
little more ice,  think
Trubshaw trots off dutifully
large ice bucket appears
Mother moves in
Absorbed by Emma, now his new protegee
About your next assignment, Mrs
Peel
Next assignment
Steed gives his champagne to the Siberian peasant
He presses a switch -- an umbrella shoots up between them, opens up, twirls
to reveal the strip of beach, like a tiny bubble of tropical weather
Against a Siberian b
g
of snow
As we  we  a giant glass bubble, hearing -- (
) Ah
sun tan lotion
Any shops nearby
(
) Must be
Trubshaw's busy
'll send Mother
to reveal no shop for miles around
(
) Ahem
As  was saying, perhaps another macaroon
(
) Thank you, Steed
(
) Thank you, Mrs
Peel
Behind the umbrella --
of
