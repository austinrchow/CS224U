We see  , a pleasant faced senior who's among the top in his class
Sincere and serious, he has yet to develop a way with women

is also a senior
She's beautiful and intelligent
(ardent but uncomfortable) Hiya Liz
how're you doing
(teasing softly) How'm  doing what
Peter
Peter
Wait up
is the school nerd
quirky kid who, like , can be a little backward around girls, especially pretty ones like Liz
(to Liz) Would you, uh
excuse us for a minute
Despite ' protesting body language,  pulls him away like a conspirator
What is it
what
Did the Astro-Physics Journal really accept your paper
(laughs, embarrassed) Yeah
well
all  got's the data but they've agreed to publish it when it's finished
You know
it's my calculation on the Planetary Conjunction
And its influence on the anti-force
Isn't it
Yes
Look, Harry,  am busy with
(indicates Liz standing there) Yeah, you and the rest of the class
Every one is busy with Liz
(growing impatient) Peter
reaches in and smacks her bottom
Hiya, cupcakes
(elbowing him affectionately) Flash
They kiss and walk away
(sneering) And Flash is the busiest of them all
(disappointed) Come on, Harry
we'll be late for Octavius
makes a gesture dismissing  as crazy
Ock is nuts, don't you agree
Ock is a genius, Harry
Crazy, Yes
But, a genius misunderstood, and unappreciated
- It is a basement hallway full of  which are banging open and shut as they put stuff in and take stuff out
In their midst, a  is banging on the door marked "Cyclotron Room - Authorized Personnel Only
" Professor , , respectable, a good old fashioned professor, he's the head of the Physics Dept
With him is  , a 40-ish, Waspish school administrator
For a scientist as crazily focused as , is a natural enemy
(knocking furiously) Doctor Octavius
You are late for your lecture
The students are waiting
Doctor Octavius
Your friend is impossible Professor Rosomorf,  told the board we should let him go
The  above 's head
Then all the behind him  in succession
and look amazed
What's he doing in there, not his crazy experiment again
You mean his anti-force theory
one day they'll give him the Nobel Prize for it
Meanwhile he is demolishing our university
Octavius
(knocks) Open the door
' The anti-force experiment has now reached the limit of electronic overload safety
Therefore, Weiner, you will disconnect the overload safety device
(three-fingered, snake-like mechanical arms) suddenly thrust themselves into the  and begin working, each at a different task
is an acknowledged master at manipulating these
He flicks a switch and a searing -  lances down from a   and strikes a marked, "1,000,000"), illuminating it and filling our ears with a splitting
The knock on the door grows louder
comes up behind
Whoa, Doc
someone's at the door
(ignoring) World class scientific mind and they stick me in the basement with this third rate cyclotron

Yes, gentleman can  help you
Tell your boss, that his class is waiting

Professor  turns and looks at the bewildered men
Gentlemen, come, you must see this
But, your students
The imbeciles can wait
have better things to do than teach introductory Physics Rosomorf
Undergrads are kindless adolescence
You see he is impossible
Thorkel you are the dummiest administrator our university has ever had
(Thorkel turns to go) Don't go Thorkel
Come
Look
He starts to play his machines handles and buttons
The university pays you to teach something to your students
- Well, do you mean nothing
or do you mean something but you won't tell me what it is
(regaining) mean plain nothing
Well,  guess that's about as nothing as you can get
plain nothing

Liz
Ahh, it is something
No
look
The equipment on her  is starting to vibrate
They look at it, curiously
We hear the cyclotron's begin to build
- Everything is shaking like in an earthquake
Roz and Thorkel seem to dance in their place going crazy with anger and surprise
The  is deafening
The light is blinding

There is an outburst of : "Fire

Keep calm, everybody keep calm
Use the front door
Everybody out the front
Liz
Come on

He wades into the fire, but is beaten back by the
His sleeve is on fire
He pats it out

People
Thanks for your help Flash
No problem wimp
Our hero has a real way with words
Oh, why don't you grow up

peeps in, worried -- faces Thorkel
This man will bring a disaster upon this university

The universe is made up of forces
and counter-forces
Science is the study of the forces

He looks away and turns the last of the  on the last of the
(continues without a hitch) But
Professor Otto Octavius
have devoted my life to the study of the counter-forces
Good job, Peter
(taking place at lab table) Thanks, Professor
has walked slowly and uncomprehendingly toward the front of the huge
He simply cannot believe ' behavior
don't believe it,  simply don't
Can we carry on Mr
Thorkel
don't believe
oh, all right carry on Professor
Well
This week my dear students  have made a stunning breakthrough
Wait a minute, wait a minute
you've got fire forms to fill out, Dr
Octavius
have no time for forms, or administrators who persist in interrupting me, Mr
Thorkel
steams out and bangs shut the
now believe its possible that these counter forces can be
collected
the way the magnifying glass collects the sunlight
and focused into a hard beam call
Weiner
backs away from the  to reveal a word that  has scrawled in large letters
It says "Anti- Force
" call it, the Anti-Force
is plugging a   into a small   with a   inside it
(continues as he works) This anti-force, once harnessed, is capable of undoing any natural force at which it is aimed
for instance
(looks up maniacally) Gravity
scribbles down a note and mouths the word "gravity
" Then she turns to
(whispers) 'm sorry
It's alright
is "playing" his  like the Phantom of the Opera at the organ
We patch in the cyclotron
The lights flicker and go dim
Pay no attention to the lights
of course steal its energy, and it looses power
We patch in the cyclotron
and we gradually apply power
The power that am stealing
As the  builds in the
peers through the   at us, distorted by it
The  is a miniature version of the cyclotron's experimental chamber, and now the - glow begins
It crackles round the
And so we stand, four square against the fundamental force that orders and maintains our universe
gravity
which is holding down this goddamn ball
Rise
The  go totally dark
The kids react with and
What a crock
Shut up Harry
this is very interesting
Mr
Parker
Have you some
interesting observation you'd like to share with the class
No sir
Then shut up
And pay some attention to the experiment
peers at us through the   as the begins to rise
' face is ecstatic
Rise
Rise
The   suddenly shoots up, shattering the top of the box
It flies up to the ceiling where it shatters a The shards rain down on  who reaches out and catches the falling  and scales it in a raised fist
Now that's what  call an experiment
The   cuts out and  wheels to the He hits a  and several lance out of the back of the room
They pierce the smoke and light a   in the front
one, , one  touch where their circumferences meet
Behind them is a depiction of "space"
You are looking at a representation of two universes
Our Blue one
Our real universe
something we can touch and feel and see and draw calculations about
This is us
The Yellow universe
this is something else
Some other dimension
something
on the other side
hits another   and a hole appears where the touch
The      with each other
The colors swirl until both  are If it were possible to generate enough power behind it, the anti-force could wipe out not just gravity
but all our universal forces at the same time
In effect
it would blast a hole between this universe and the next
Each
(indicates green spheres) would flow into each other
No blue universe
No yellow
End, finished, over
(with a student's ear) That sounds like a scenario for the end of the world
My girl, it is
It is
It would mean wiping out everything that's known
and letting in everything that's unknown
Isn't that a little dangerous
Don't worry yourself, true inter- dimensional penetration is still purely theoretical, but one day
Maybe very near
maybe in the 21st century
- , ,  and  all take  from their (whispers to Peter) Look, it's just
don't know
when you and Flash go after each other like that
(whispers) He's not my type
He doesn't have to be
Check
And besides, he's not all bad
looks at  who's a few  down
has taken a  from his  and is spinning it on his finger with great joy and concentration
You don't get nicknamed Flash because you're a rocket scientist, Liz
Give it up, Parker
You'd die for a nickname like Flash
Yeah, of embarrassment
comes by and leans seductively by her
is a ripe one and hot-hot-hot
(teasing) Hey, Flash
'm scalping a pair of the Midnight Madness Wrestling Match tomorrow night
The Slammies
'd kill for that
Would you pay $125
Well, uh,
gee
if
can  tell you tomorrow
(moving on) You snooze, you lose
Hiya Liz
Kim, you know Peter and Harry
This is my new roommate
Kim Nickson
is pulling her pet, a foot long , out of her She wraps it around her neck and turns to the boys
They go bug-eyed
(interested) Hellooo, Peter
(embarrassed) Hi
We're going to the Student Reunion Meeting
You coming
Peter looks at
Wow
Then he looks at  who's adjusting herself in a small
jabs him in the ribs
Yeah, yeah
(frustrated) can't
gotta go over to the Daily Bugle
'm trying to sell some photos
Soooh, a photographer
Just an amateur
Well
nice meeting you, Kim
Yeah
bet it would be
Can  be your date for the reunion ShooShoo
No Jerk
(she turns to go) What did  say
It's not what you said, it's how you say it, ShooShoo
Everybody leaves and Harry is left alone, he throws his bag down
Damn
turns to go and comes face to face with the hulking Peter, Doc Ock wants to see you
About my data  bet
don't know
He knows about my work on the Planetary Conjunction, doesn't he
(lies) don't know
- enters wide-eyed behind
This place is a far cry from the experiment in the
It's a fantastic netherworld to which no undergrad gains entrance
No one but
is sitting in a swivel  with his back to
He has the look of Captain Nemo in his Nautilus
This is ' domain
Hello, Professor Octavius
(no response) really admired your experiment
(back to Peter) We have a lot of interests in common, Peter
Perhaps we should put our heads together, if you know what  mean
(flattered) That would be
great
(turns with a smile) Now you take the Planetary Conjunction
This Saturday night we will witness Saturn, Jupiter, the Moon, the Earth, the Sun
all in a row
Never seen within the memory of man, or measured for its effect
The total gravitational force must be quite exceptional
Isn't that the subject of your paper
Yes sir, 've worked out a new way to calculate the combined gravitational effect
'm a busy man, Mr
Parker
But  think could find the time to go over it with you
Make sure it all
checks out
Well
'm sort of working with Professor Rosomorf and he suggested we kind of keep it between us
He thinks that my theory is
well,  don't know
(to himself) The scoundrel
(turns angry) want to see that data, Peter
But Professor Octavius
if  knew you were interested
sorry, 've already given it to
Professor Rosomorf, and he is after all the head of our Physics Department
and  couldn't
turns sweet again
He smiles too broadly
Well, 'm certain something can be worked out
Run along, young man
begins to leave
Just a minute
how about if  show you my discoveries
something  never showed to any other student
as a matter of fact to anybody at all
Well  am really flattered,  mean 'd love to
but
Very well shall we say if you come here tonight
But Professor  don't now if  should
Make it eight sharp
'll be waiting for you
Right here
Peter looks worried then leaves
turns to  who slouches against the wall smiling
The same academic world that's so keen to embrace that boy's undergraduate work, ridicules my anti-force theory as quackery
ask you, Weiner
what is our society coming to
Ha
They are all a bunch of brainless assholes, that's what  say
Weiner
Go get me that boy's data
Cost you fifty bucks
(Weiner hissing) Just get it
We'll negotiate your fee when you have the data, alright Weiner
- Establish as    well beyond its prime sign says: "The Daily Bugle
" Peter enters the building
(
) Garbage
Absolute, 100% garbage
'  - Very forties, very messy
Jameson scans some  as stands helplessly by
Bag ladies
hate bag ladies
Yes, sir
is 50ish, grey at the temples, brush cut on top
He too is forties
His chewed up  is forties
This guy is a hard case
(looks at the other photos) Little kids
hate little kids
This is a daily newspaper
We need news value photographs, not artsy-fartsy shit
Yes, sir
comes to a picture of a    with a smiles in anticipation
Kid
You want a pro's assessment
Yes, sir
(handing photos back) Your photos suck
(cigar for emphasis) Parker, my readers are morons
gotta grab them by the eyes
Every time you press the button of that Nikon of yours it costs you fifty-five cents
So the next time you're about to take the plunge, ask yourself, am  taking dog bites man
Because if you are
know,  know
You want man bites dog
Parker, this is the post modern 20th century
want man eats dog
Get out
- seedy east village walk up
Peter takes his camera and takes various shots of a wino
He climbs the stairs to his building, looks through the mail, he collects from a beaten down mailbox
(reading) Rent
Rent, more bills, rent
electricity, bills
'  - one-room, shabby roof apartment, a chaos of books and papers
photo enlarger and darkroom baths in kitchen pots; 8x10s tacked to the walls; a spare camera and lenses
Self-consciously wacky kitsch; plastic dinosaurs, wind-up toys, a stuffed carp
An unmade bed and a 50's dinette set are the only furniture
grimy skylight leads to the roof
It's not a pretty place, but it has personality
voice from the kitchen, a shadow of an intruder, is sneaking around
There's nothing in there worth stealing
(
) (from within the kitchen) That's the understatement of the year
Aunt May, you're trespassing
(comes in) was just so desperately bored thought 'd come over and make you dinner
am old enough to
to make my own-- But  didn't feel like getting to know your roaches
'll introduce you
Oh
And those foul chemicals in the pots
take pictures, remember
Anyway, 've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills
She grabs her coat, crosses back to Peter and tugs on his shoulder
It's Friday night
Yes
Do you have a date
No
Then come on
- It is dark and empty except for
Sitting at it, lit by the  of its screen, is   ()
As he works, a  opens behind him
Someone walks quietly through the
keeps working
The intruder approaches
(at his ear) Professor Rosomorf, what happened here
Someone tried to rob me of some paper
suspect they were looking for that one
What is it
(unruffled) Award winning stuff
(turning slightly) Peter Parker's data on the Planetary Conjunction
Damn lucky  hid it in my computer under another title
My God, what's going on in our school
First Professor Octavius almost blows up the Physics lab
Now this
You report it in triplicate, of course
Thorkel, be careful when you talk to Octavius
Remember
the man is a very fragile genius
One day he'll bring us all the Noble Prize
Rosomorf, the man is a very dangerous crackpot
Off screen the voice of the   begins to build
That's him again
He's working day and night
tell you the man is very dangerous
(the whine grows louder) Come on Rosomorf, let's stop him before this building will explode
- and  are at work as before
takes no notice of the   who come in, nor the  who comes in behind them and sets to work attaching a   to the door
Shut it down, Octavius
ignores him
touches ' shoulder ignores him too
You've blown half the circuits in the Science Center
Call an electrician
have called the locksmith
What
what is he doing
He points toward the worker who's working on the lock on the main door
We have to shut your lab down and take a look at the lines
Please, Otto, we must lock it up
(to Thorkel) You're denying me access to my cyclotron
You bet
glares back and forth between the  , the , and
Then he pulls  the
The  descends
The  pull back and dangle from their panel
The dies
(contemplating) Okey, dokey
just give me till tomorrow
want to clean up my papers
Tomorrow
Ha
Tomorrow you can have this room
Oh
well Thorkel
few more hours won't make a difference
hope
He signals to the worker to stop
- The
Mets are playing baseball on
watches with his  , a paunchy 65 years old in and a
is perched on ' head
is in his hand cluttered but familiar living room sprawls comfortably around them
Another brewski
No, 'm fine, Uncle Ben
(at
) Yah
Way to do it
Alright
(to Peter) You don't follow the Mets like you used to, do you, Pete
No, not so much anymore
Funny
When your Mom and Dad, uh, passed away
had this idea
wanted you to be the best baseball player that ever was
Geez, what ever happened to that
Little league
(soft and warm) Yeah
Babe Ruth you wasn't
enters
It's on the table
Turn off the
nods, rises sluggishly and slowly, and turns the sound off only
moves toward his  in the doorway
How's that girl you told us about, Peter
Liz
She's great
But she has a boyfriend
- passes   and takes his seat
boy your age should have a girlfriend
Aunt May
she has a steady boyfriend
Peter, any girl that's worth your attention is of course gonna have a boyfriend
But if she really gets to know what you have to offer she'll
you get my drift
Look, just leave him alone, okay
When he's ready for girls he'll be a holy terror
(winks) It's in the blood
(now serious business) Lookit, how are you fixed for money, Pete
Maybe  can help you out a little
(lying to them) No, 'm alright
My scholarship covers almost everything, and  sell some photos here and there
Today my physics professor asked for some of my work
he wants to study my data
They might publish my work in the science magazine
that'll bring me some money
(practically cheering) Publish your work
You hear that May
(embarrassed laughs) Yeah, in fact  have to leave a little early tonight, to meet Professor Octavius
He offered me to be his assistant
Whoa
Did you hear that May
Oh, Peter, you promised you'd spend the night
can't, Aunt May
Professor Octavius wants to discuss my new findings
(disappointed) Peter, what you should be finding
is a nice girlfriend
- is eating a large  and a drinking a
'll show them
closing the cyclotron on me
Weiner
Yes, Professor
Where is he
It's ten past eight o'clock
(with mouth full) That must be him
He opens the door
Good evening
You are late
(to Weiner) Weiner, go outside and get us something to eat
And don't steal it
Just buy it
'll reimburse you
(to Peter) Do you want anything Parker
No thank you,  just had dinner at my aunt's
Piss off, Weiner
leaves
wanders around
He goes into the experimental chamber, he overlooks the which is scuttling away and crawls inside the open and into the chamber
Okey, dokey, Parker
how would you like to take Weiner's place
mean, be my assistant
Well, Professor, that would be a great honor, but 'm already working with
Rosomorf
that imbecile
Don't you understand, kid, that  am about to uncover the greatest discovery since Einstein came up with his theory of relativity
The "Anti-Force
" Wow
The theory of the Anti-force
You should go for the Noble Prize Professor
Noble Shmoble,  am going for a much bigger prize kid
Okey, dokey
Let me show you, kid, what  got here
begins the experiment
We move in past the shattered We see the  crawling on the chamber's
Present maximum anti-force power to date is 38 percent of theoretical limit have patched in the variable particle-wave accelerator
(shrugs) will now try to reach 50% power
(big breath) And if your paper has any value
can use it to get the power 'm missing to create the anti-force, to break through and beat any other form of power in our or any other universe, capish
Sorry, Professor,  can't do it
gave my word to Professor Rosomorf
is angry
Ock now sees the
He shoots out a to try and crush it but the  is too fast
The slams against the wall of the chamber
He starts to push every button or switch in sight
deafening whining starts
An    causes  to look at the "Relative Gravity"
It is at "4
999999KG" but suddenly the numbers start to tumble rapidly
: The glowing 5KG
: The   inches toward 50%
(screaming) 50 percent
anti-force
50 percent
that's all 'm missing
Parker, we can be rich together
Sorry
'd better go now
(really angry now) You'll be sorry, Parker
leaves
Another    causes  to look at the monitor
On it, flashing , is the word, "
"  pushes the    forward
The  increases to a  and
- Incredibly lit, the  is dropping on it's shimmering - down toward the 5KG  which now  in time with the  and
- The  is flashing "  -
" continues with the experiment
And then he sees the You
Get out of there, you creeping
He tries to shove the  with his hand
- Through the - we can barely make out  on the other side if the shattered
He sends after the
The  evades him and jumps onto the 's back
It then climbs onto the 's neck and bites him
(anguish) Noooooooooooo
The gravity  goes to
000001, then pops back up as ' tiny world goes berserk
spin, crack, explode or droop liquidly
dance on the  which erupts like the 4th of
begins to float
His shirt begins to tear away floats by with its pulled  undulating like a Medusa
smash through the walls and flail like snakes
'   distorts and
, his hair wild, face locked in a multi- grimace, is pinned halfway up a wall that is showering the room with (ecstasy above the din) It's an energy storm
Okey
Dokey
We see clearly the  still stuck to his neck
The big beast buffets and shakes
Tubes, junctions, valves and whatnot fall off, crashing to the floor where they twitch and writhe with a life of their own
Then, an enormous  rips a large hole in the 's side, sending debris and a  - of   lancing in our direction
- Ultimate weirdness
The  - penetrates first the  of the   and then the very walls
bang,  , the ceiling sags in a ,  way
The  sag too
The   pivots and embeds itself in a
sinks in the
The - dances wildly about in
Then, suddenly, it stops
comes running in holding a double decker sandwich and a large bottle of Pepsi
Weiner enters ' lab, singing, not at first noticing what's going on
Suddenly he stops dead
- scene out of 's surrealistic canvas
There are things inside of other things
look like watches
This place has been rippled to the max
lays face up, unconscious on the floor, a  across his chest
The  is weaving its web
slowly to see
and  are stuck to his body
The  seems to be wrapping him
He wakes up to see those   buried in his body
They weave around him as if they are looking for prey
He tries to tear them out, but they seem to be a part of his body, like his other limbs
He screams
Suddenly Weiner sees Professor
what happened to you
What did you do
Suddenly one of the waldos hits him so strongly that he flies back and out through the door to the corridor
- Oh my God
what happened here
He hears the police sirens approaching, he runs away
better get out of here
- The long  segues to a
pulls to a halt in front of the
Many   are already there, along with a   , some , a  from the and
runs across the lawn
to hold back the crowd of press, students and general gawkers
pushes to the front of the mob in time to see hustle a   back into it
The  shakes his head
throws down his , stomps it, and pulls out a fresh one
arrives to address the
(through bull horn) There is no danger
Please go back to your dorms
repeat, there is no danger
(approaches him) Spill it out, Professor
The public wants to know
The  closes on
Who are you
Jameson, Daily Bugle, Chief Editor, now what really happened here
There will be a press announcement in the morning Mr
Jameson
now if you'll excuse me
This elicits a flood of  : " heard a terrible explosion
" "Nuclear accidents
" "Meltdown
" "Genetic engineering
" "Are you guys making mutants in there
" have nothing to say
there will be an announcement
Now, please go home
everybody
we must clear the grounds
In the back of the crowd are , , ,  and You think they'll cancel classes
They must
the whole building must be contaminated with some kind of poisonous gas
How about nuclear contaminations
My God
lets beat it
But nobody moves
(more interested in other things) Could anyone be in there, Peter
(concerned) don't know
Maybe Professor Octavius
He usually works late
That nut,  bet it was all his doing
(seeing Peter) Hey Parker
Peter Parker
pushes forward
Mr
Jameson
What are you doing here
What's going on
That's for them to know, and for you to find out
But sir, they wouldn't tell us
You heard Thorkel

You got your camera
Sure, but  can't-- hundred dollars says you can
Yes sir
Get inside and get pictures, fifty bucks
You just said a hundred
Seventy, but  want blood and gore
(calling back) Seeya guys
He dashes off
shakes his head in dismay at this guy
Where is he going
To make fifty bucks
- approaches a   keeping low and out of sight
He leaps it like a skirmisher but fails ignominiously in a heap
He's torn his  and cut his leg
He moves to the side of the building
sits next to a
It's locked
As mulls over his next move, the  clicks and the slowly opens
leaps on the
and falls in
- lays in the , a pained look on his face
He rolls over and comes face to face with a wet
The headline reads, "Wave of Violence Rips City
" He pulls himself up and peers out
He sees a   hold the  open for who remove some weirdly fused objects
When they let the  swing closed,  stops it by inserting the  in the top
- squeezes inside and jumps to knock out the The Door closes behind him
- Skewed, strange, surreal,  stares at the weirdness and fumbles with his
He snaps off a few shots, then freezes when he hears a familiar voice
(
) (filtered through face mask) Take it easy
Take it easy with him
(
) Take him away and never bring him back
Now we see  and  following 2  carrying in a stretcher
They all wear
waldo sneaks out from under the sheet and hits Thorkel, as fast as lightning
He falls back
He's covered with a and attached to
Octavius moans
What was that
What was what
What hit me
What hit you
don't know
It was so fast
You're going to be fine, Otto
gets off a shot and ducks into the ' room leaving the  ajar for a peak
slips down from the
' eyes go wide at the sight
What in the hell has happened here
'  - The  are twisted in bizarre shapes
are exposed and spout
The  look like something out of a funhouse
hears the  go by
goes to the  of ' Lab and cracks it
up to the ,  softly, dangling from a above
As  looks out at the , the  drops on his neck
He reacts by swatting it away
Bad move
The   now squats malevolently on the back of 's hand
He stares at it transfixed
It bites
Ow
throws the  to the ripply tile floor where it scuttles unsteadily out the door
Sweat starts to bead on ' face
He shakes his head to clear it
His vision becomes uncertain
He lurches against a
'  is not just uncertain, not just fuzzy, not just moving in and out anamorphically
It's all of that
(
) (heavily distorted) Hey
What are you doing here, kid
turns to see a   distorted by his crazy vision

(heavily distorted) Yeah
Well,  ain't laughing
Get out
Just get out of here

As in a dream, appears at his side
(distorted) Okay, scoop, whaddaya got
got pictures of the Professor
in there
it's so strange in there
so bizarre
(winks) Good job, kid
Bizarre is what we need
Pick this up in the morning
(holding up his camera) There'll be two crisp twenties tucked inside
He hurries off
peers after him and all of a sudden his vision corrects to a perfect focus
The sweat is gone
He's okay
He makes his way through the crowd to the street
We  with  as the madding throng recedes behind him
He turns a corner
He hears a
An  screeches around the corner
It nearly hits who leaps to avoid it
- ' cheek is pressed against the brick
He opens his eyes and sees that he's hanging onto the side of the building like a spider
And he's three stories up
He looks down and sees the street thirty feet below him
And the Ambulance which he jumped over is driving away
He tries a downward step, but a  dislodges and crashes to the sidewalk
He takes an upward step
And then another
Tentatively at first, and then with growing confidence, he "crawls" to the roof of the building
At the top he gropes for a  and slips
He dangles eight stories above the street
Then, with a grunt, he vaults to the roof one-handed
- is flat on his back, staring at the stars
He sits up and looks wonderingly at his hands
On the back of his right hand are surrounded by a faint -
The disappears
(mutters to himself) This is weird
My God,  feel so weird
He leaps to his feet
He flexes
Feels weird
Good Weird
In fact, great weird
He tries a couple of "jumping jacks" and on the third jump he soars into the air
(exhilarated) Very weird
The great, bespangled,    is his backdrop as jumps and turns and does loops in the air
With the agility and tactility of a spider,  leaps from the  to a  to a   to another where he lands sideways and sticks
(sideways) Very, very weird
He leaps off the  and lands at the edge of the roof
He looks down
No one's looking back
So, he takes a step back and leaps the alley to the next roof
- lands on it
The next roof is seven stories up and across the street
bites his lip
Well, what the hell
- Backlit by a  ,  somersaults to the roof of the taller building, and misses the top
He sticks to the brick , upside down
He laughs with the moment
opens below him and a pretty in a  sticks her head out
She looks this way and that, and all she sees is a  in a down the street
Never thinking to look up, she withdraws into the room
- The  in the   leans against a and lights a  with a  , In the  he sees a reflection of  leaping off the taller building
He snaps around and looks up in time to see  make it to the next
- With the   behind him,  casts caution to the wind and leaps from rooftop to rooftop
Watching from the street, the  in the follows ' progress

He leaps up to a  and lands on a  across which he does a "bug crawl" and leaps again
He touches down on a   and bounds up and out of frame again

He's so surprised that he leaves the  open and twenty fly away in a furious flapping, free at last
The  lets out a stream of Hispanic expletives complete with all the appropriately obscene gestures

You want to wait around till midnight to find out
No, but
Let's see what else we've got
Another set of numbers roll up on the

It might be a calculation of the amount of power he needs to create the hole between the force and the anti-force

It's brilliant, Otto
It's mad, but it's brilliant
You have much work left to do

He has enough power with his Plutonium
Especially if he gets his hands on Parker's data, there he has enough power to do what he wants to do

But don't worry
he can never use it without Plutonium

) He's got the Plutonium, and he's on his way back to the lab
And he's got two prisoners with him
Liz and Flash
Don't worry
he needs a huge amount of power
thousands of volts of electricity

Electrical power

Nuclear power 270
And now, at the moment of full Planetary Conjunction
When all the planets line up with the sun
