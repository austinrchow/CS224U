90028 **************** -                1 2 It's magnified and deeply revealed
Flecks of green and yellow in a field of milky blue
Icy filaments surround the undulating center
The eye is brown in a tiny screen
On the metallic surface below, the words - are finely etched
There's a touch-light panel across the top and on the side of the screen, a dial that registers fluctuations of the iris
The instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits on a table between two men
The man talking is big, looks like an over-stuffed kid
"" it says on his breast pocket
He's dressed in a warehouseman's uniform and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in his lap
Despite the obvious heat, he looks very cool
The man facing him is lean, hollow cheeked and dressed in gray
Detached and efficient, he looks like a cop or an accountant
His name is  and he's all business, except for the sweat on his face
The room is large and humid
Rows of salvaged junk are stacked neatly against the walls
Two large fans whir above their heads
Okay if  talk
Holden doesn't answer
He's centering Leon's eye on the machine
kinda get nervous when take tests
Don't move
Sorry
He tries not to move but finally his lips can't help a sheepish smile
Already had
test this year -- but  don't think  never had a
(cutting in) Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention
Answer quickly as you can
Leon compresses his lips and nods his big head eagerly
Holden's voice is cold, geared to intimidate and evoke response
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a
What one
It was a timid interruption, hardly audible
What
What desert
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical
But how come 'd be there
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows
So you look down and see a tortoise
It's crawling towards you
tortoise
What's that
Know what a turtle is
Of course
Same thing
never seen a turtle
He sees Holden's patience is wearing thin
But  understand what you mean
You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon
Keeping an eye on his subject, Holden notes the dials in the Voight-Kampff
One of the needles quivers slightly
You make these questions, Mr
Holden, or they write 'em down for you
Disregarding the question, Holden continues, picking up the pace
The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its legs trying to turn itself over
But it can't
Not without your help
But you're not helping
Leon's upper lip is quivering
Whatcha mean, 'm not helping
mean you're not helping
Why is that, Leon
Leon looks shocked, surprised
But the needles in the computer barely move
Holden goes for the inside of his coat
But big Leon is faster
His a hole the size of a nickel through Holden's stomach
Unlike a bullet, a laser causes no impact
It goes through Holden's spine and comes out his back, clean as a whistle
Like a rag doll he falls back off the bench from the waist up
By the time he hits the floor, big slow Leon is already walking away
But he stops, turns and with a little smile of satisfaction, at the machine on the table
There's a flash and a puff of smoke
The Voight-Kampff is hit dead center, crippled but not destroyed; as Leon walks out of the room, one of its lights begins to blink, faint but steady
-                                      3 The horizon marked by a thin copper line that maybe the end, of the beginning of a day
The train that follows, cuts through the night at 400 miles an hour
-                                       4 No clickitty-clack of track-bound noise, it's a long, insulated Pullman of contoured seats and low-keyed lighting, coloured to soothe,and empty, except for the passenger half way down
His eyes closed, head rested against the glass
Ten years ago,  might have been an athlete, a track man or a welter-weight
The body looks it, but the face has seen some time -- not all of it good
-   -               5 Deckard comes down the aisle, slips a coin into the mechanism, receives a beer and returns to his seat
-                                       6 Tired of the program, he takes off the headset and drops it next to three empty beer bottles and a sandwich wrapper, adjusts his position and winds up staring at his reflection in the window
Runs a hand over his face, it could use a shave
He leans closer and peers through the glass
Out there in the black a sign flashes past: ,
-                                    7 The train slides in, smooth as an eel, and stops with- out a sound
Carrying a bag and umbrella, Deckard disembarks ahead of the other passengers and into the sweltering night
-                                    8 Deckard has got his coat swung over his shoulder, his shirt already damp, as he walks down the long, hollow passage under orbs of yellow light
-                                    9 Deckard unlocks his car and gets in
Turns the ig- nition and hits a sensor
The dash console glows and Deckard sits back waiting for the air unit to cool things off
(
) It was 97 degrees in the city and no hope of improvement
Not bad if you're a lizard
But two hours earlier  was drinking Acquavit with an Eskimo lady in North East Alaska
That's a tough change to make
It was so good,  didn't want to leave, so  left a day early
little detached, Deckard taps another sensor on the panel, lights up a cigarette and watches as his mes- sages flash across the viewer stating date, time and caller
The last one is repeated five times
Deckard sighs, switches off the viewer and gets on the radio
Contact
This is Blade Runner One calling Com-fast 27
The     precedes the mechanical female voice that answers
Blade Runner One, stand by please
pause
Followed by a husky male voice
Deckard
Yah, Gaff
() Where the hell you been
You know where  been
been on vacation
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is
What's up
Holden got hit
There is a pause
That was bad news
Bad
Severed spine
You'd better get in here
Bryant's waiting for you
'll see you in a minute
The  , the wipers rake two weeks of dust off the windshield and Deckard jams out of the lot
-                         10 An enormous grey vault of a building
businesslike Deckard strides down a long corridor with his brief- case and police  pinned to his coat
(
) --4-- referred to as a Nexus-6, The Tyrell Corporation's new pride and joy
Holden was administering the Voight-Kampff test when one nailed him
The door in front of Deckard slides open and he walks through
(
) The Nexus-6 must be fast because Holden was as quick as they come
The report said there were six of them
Three males and three female
Led by a combat model called Roy Batty
'  -                   11 The  is in his fifties
The deep creases in his face, the broken capillaries in his nose say brawler, spoiler, drinker, but the diplomas on the wall say something else
Bryant's kneeled at his safe trying to open it
Deckard it sitting on the edge of the desk reading the print-out
(
) They escaped from the colonies two weeks ago
Killed twenty- three people and jumped a shuttle
An aerial patrol found the ship in the desert
No crew
Bryant gets the safe open and brings out a bottle of whiskey
(
) Bryant's got a liver problem couple years back he handed me a bottle and said have a drink for another man
been drinking for him ever since
Deckard sets down the report and takes the shot Bryant just poured for him
Six, huh
Five
Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation
Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field
What was he after
There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure
But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing
Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees
Guess he found himself one
grim pause
You got a machine on it yet
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm
Its guess is that all five are in the city
Where do we start
Bryant's back at the safe locking up his bottle
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model
Check it out on the Voight-Kampff
There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect
If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek
What was the cover on the one that got Holden
Industrial refuse
Garbage man
Bryant nods
Did personnel have an address on him
Bryant fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket, copies down a number and hands it over
'll go take a look
Deckard stands and holds up his drink
Thanks
Like a sick boy looking out of the window, Bryant watches Deckard down the whiskey
Deckard puts down the glass and turns to leave
(
) The big incentive to emigrate was still free labor
If the public found out that their door-prizes might kill them, they might not be so hot to go up there
This was one of the worst one's we had and Bryant was worried
He wanted to tell me to be discrete or something
But  didn't give him a chance
'   -                       12 An electrical storm is brewing
Deckard stands out- side the entrance to an old hotel holding an umbrella, as people scuttle into doorways to avoid the sudden downpour
'   -                          13 heavy metal maze of cubicles and perilous iron balconies, peopled with rejects from the surface world; Mato Grosso Indians in white man's clothes and other lower echelon welfare recipients
Drop city is crowded, cramped and darkly alive
Deckard steps out of an elevator and moves through the crowd
cloud of steam drifts up through  a grating as two old men, clad in towels descend a flight of stairs under a neon sign that says bath house
musty subterranean wind ripples Deckard's clothes as he turns into an alcove
He stops in front of a door that says,  and pushes the buzzer
It's opened by an emphysema victim with an oxygen tank lashed to his hip
Deckard flashes his  and speaks some words which are inaudible due to the   down the hall
The man grabs a key from his wall, hands it over and shuts the door
'   -                       14 The companion ways below deck of a big ship are no more bewildering than the ups and downs and ins and outs of this establishment
But Deckard finds the door he's looking for
He pauses a moment, listens, then knocks
He inserts the key and with a hand on his gun opens it
'  -                                 15 An empty room
cot and not much else
He steps in and stands quiet as a hunter sensing the signs
For a place surrounded by greasy hovels it is surprisingly clean
Spartan in fact
The towel by the spotless basin is perfectly folded
Deckard runs two fingers over a shelf
No dust
He looks in the waste basket
Wadded up candy wrappers
The bed by the window is neatly made
Deckard looks under it, then runs his hands along both sides of the mattress
The closet
There's one suit in it
He pats it down
Nothing
show box on the floor
He stoops, takes out what looks like a pen from his pocket and care- fully traces it over the box
Assured of its harm- lessness, he lifts off the lid
It contains a little stack of photos bound with a rubber band
Deckard removes them, goes to the lamp by the balcony window and turns it on
touching collection of family snapshots
The kind of anonymous stuff sold by the bunch in dusty junk shops
The family dog
Junior on the pony squinting in the sun
Uncle Ben clowning with the kids
The faded polaroid of Christmas morning
Simple pictures of simple folks celebrating the family bond
curious collection for the likes of Leon and Deckard studies them with interest
-                                16 Oblivious to the cloudburst, a blue-eyed albino stands in the doorway, peddling candy and artificial flowers looking like he'd never been touched by the light of day
Leon is standing behind him, staring up at his room, watching Deckard at the window
He's still wearing his coveralls, but he looks different
His face is more intent, smarter and angry
-                                17 For one seething moment it looks like Leon might mash something, but suddenly he swings away and disappears into the crowd
'  -                                 18 Deckard pockets the pictures and moves away from the window
-                                       19 Leon's got a neck like a fire hydrant and legs to match, but he's a graceful runner
Looks like he could do it for days
And he could
He's put a lot of alley behind him and he's not out of breath
-                                   20 Slowing down he cuts into an opening and comes out onto a narrow street
The Asian Quarter
-                             21 seamy as well as steamy little place
Counter and small tables
Old slant-eyed enders humped over their fuming bowls jabbering and slurping
The only voice coming out clear is from the big three- on the back wall
As the mellow-mouthed announcer delivers the message, a Latin-looking beauty in a well-fitted maids uniform does a twirl, flashes a beguiling smile and glides
' Choose from a variety of seventy nine different personality types
Each and every one a loyal trouble- free companion given to you upon your arrival absolutely free
The Latin beauty is replaced by an impeccable Ray Bolger type gentleman's gentleman who clicks his heels, snaps to attention and struts off to make room for the next
' To use as personal body servant to tireless field hand -- the custom tailored humanoid robot, designed especially for your needs
The Chinese are paying no attention, but the man and the woman seated at the table by the window are
The woman is pretty, a touch of gray in her hair, kind and blue-eyed
looks like an American dream mom, right out of "Father Knows Best
" The man also resembles a tradition: the gym instructor, short cropped hair with the body of a drill sergeant, but the eyes are grey and chilling
is a presence of force with a lazy, but acute sense of what goes on around him
Leon has just come through the door behind them
Try- ing not to be the bull in a china shop, he approaches their table and kneels
Batty doesn't bother to look at him, which amplifies the note of sarcasm in his quiet voice
Did you get your precious 'things'
Somebody was already there
Police
Just a man
Police man
Leon looks sullen
Why don't you have a seat
There's one next to him
Leon pulls it over and sits
Enjoy the view
From the pot on the table, Mary pours tea and they sit so quiet and still in this noisy place that they seem almost invisible
The view they're "enjoying" is through the window
Outside the neon side in the win- dow directly across the street says:   , '  -                        22 Chew is a spindly old man of precision, his veiled eyes are shrewd and Chinese, but the rest of him looks like a Charles Dickens invention
He's got a jewelers' glass stuck in his eye, lurched over a lamp, squinting at something in his hand
After a moment his lips peal back into a sour, belligerent smile
Well, you're right
This little honey has a couple of defective cones
He snaps off the lamp and swings round to face his client
' face is almost young, but something has gone too far, too fast
Premature old age has made his bones brittle and his co-ordination slow
The house may be dark but there's a light on in it
Se- bastian is a closet genius
You're a regular perfectionist, Sebastian
Sebastian's apologetic, especially around the acerbic Mr
Chew
It's gotta be right for my customer
Your customer, eh
Chew snickers and beckons
Sebastian follows his down a high narrow hall to a heavy insulated door
There's a moth-eaten full length fur coat hanging by it
Chew tugs it on and they go through
The big door slams shut behind them
-                           23 Except for the work table with its sharp gleaming in- struments, the room is as barren and sterile as a morgue
The glass-doored compartments in the walls look like crypts
Some of them small as post office boxes
From one of the Chew removes a vacuum, packed box
Carefully separating the seal, he reaches into the purple jell and with a pair of tweezers extracts an eye
Through the jeweler's glass, which he has not bothered to remove, Chew holds the eye up to the light and studies it a moment
His other hand searches through his pockets
You got a pocket-charger, boy
Quick to accommodate, Sebastian removes a pencil-like device from a row of such things in his breast pocket and steps closer
The back of the eye is touched with the pencil and the pupil moves
Suddenly its staring back at them
Is that good enough for your customer
Anxious to leave, Sebastian nods
Chew reseals the eye taking his time
He can afford to, he's wearing his coat
How much is he paying you
In place of an answer, Sebastian clears his throat, stares at the bag like he didn't hear
Well, when do you get paid
Soon as  finish the job
When might that be
Day after tomorrow
Oh
Day after tomorrow
Sebastian nods
Chew stares at the poor bastard, con- cerned in spite of himself
The rich hate to pay, Sebastian
guy like Tyrell keeps you waiting
Pay the little guy last
You should charge twice as much
It'll make him feel better
Sebastian nods his head like that's exactly what he'll do
Chew sees it's hopeless and hands him the bag
Thanks, Mr
Chew
Chew pulls the door open for him and Sebastian goes through quick as a dog
'  -  -              24 Sebastian may lack co-ordination but he got what he came for and there's a hopeful spring to his walk as he heads for his truck
'  -                       25 It's an old panel job with ambulance siren and lights
The lettering on the side reads "

It's a jolt that causes him to yelp
is sprawled on the seat next to him, and wakes up with a yelp of her own
They stare at one another for a startled instant, and she jumps out and starts walk- ing
But she's forgotten her little beat-up overnight case
Sebastian puts the truck in gear, drives next to her and opens the door
Hey
You forgot your
He holds up the bag
Hesitantly she reaches for it
How come you were in my truck
was tired and didn't have any place to go
She stares at him, hand on her case, looking lost
Sebastian isn't good at this, but he tries
You can get back in if you want
She can't make up her mind
Don't worry,  won't hurt you
She gets in
Both of them are silent
People are not Sebastian's medium -- usually he's too shy, but this girl is shyer still, plus they're about the same age -- it gives him courage
What's your name
Pris
Mine's
Sebastian
Hi
So pleased with the way that went, he forgets for a while what comes next
Oh
Where do you want to go
She shrugs
That leaves him a lot of responsibility
He throws her side-long glances, but she's not helping
You want to go home
don't have one
Oh
What do you do with a teenage beauty who looks like she's lost out of some "Welcome to Sunny Arizona" poster
Where are your folks
They left
What about friends
have some, but  have to find out where they are staying
She leans forward and rests her elbows on the dash
Her body would win prizes, from any angle
Well, where should  take you
She looks at him,a shadow of enticement in her clear blue eyes
We scared each other pretty good didn't we
We sure did
She giggles and laughs
'm hungry,
've got stuff
If you wanna go to my place
was hoping you'd say that
Sebastian's face is normally on the grey side, but it just turned red
He turns on the ignition and they pull away from the curb
'  -  -                     26 Speeding along the freeway
The terminal in the com- munications console lit
Deckard's right hand just finished a punch-up
The screen flashes back
Deckard punches up
Letters flash across the screen: Screen flashes back: Deckard punches up

Screen flashes: Deckard's voice has been heard over the preceding

In his rear view mirror Deckard sees two black-clad motorcycle cops coming up behind him like the hounds of hell
They draw silently alongside
Deckard presses his
to the window
The cop tosses a salute to Deckard and he and his partner accelerate, vanish in the night
And Deckard's car does too

The street is strewn with refuse
The building looks vacant

And shelved along the walls and hung from the ceiling is a menagerie of animoids
Like so many broken toys awaiting resurrection from Sebastian's wise hands
Sebastian is seated at a large work-table, bent over a stereo scope
The tool in his right hand is a sensor probe and he's using it with the delicacy of an en- graver
The object of his concentration is a maze-like chip configuration no bigger than a thumbnail, but magnified under the scope, it looks like an aerial view of a large city
The needle-like sensor probe moves care- fully over the contours of the configuration, testing the bonds
Suddenly a blue flash erupts from one of the junctures
Oh
Pris is light on her feet
She's standing behind him with a half-eaten sandwich in her hand
Whatcha doin'
You scared me
But he's happy to see her
'm working
She's changed her dress and made up her face
Looks a little older and sexier
You look
better
Just better
Beautiful
Thanks
He watches her as she prowls around the room, looking at this and that, eating her sandwich
And you live in this building all by yourself
Yeah,  live here pretty much alone right now
Trying to make light of it
No housing shortage around here
plenty of room for everybody
She sprawls on the couch studying him
How old are you
He can't meet her eyes
Twenty
What's your problem
It's not an easy subject
His voice is barely audible
Methuselah Syndrome
What's that
My glands
They grow old too fast
Is that why you're still here
Yes

There is a silence
He steals a glance at her
like you just the way you are
Under the desk he bats his knees together
Ah, you get hold of your friends

They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow

Here's something you might find interesting
They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum
However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy
know all that
What about a summary then
think we're through for the night
Deckard starts to reach for the panel
Mr
Deckard
Hesitates
Yes
Do you have something against science
Not if it works
And what in your estimation works
The umbrella
Deckard picks up the umbrella and with it stabs the terminal off button before Esper can respond and the machine goes dead
He sits there for a moment then flips on the lamp
Leon's snap-shots are spread out before him

(
) Every government that could was racing to populate their colonial territory
But emigrants needed incentive
Over-population and the greenhouse factor didn't seem to be enough; but owning a human look-a-like had lots of appeal
It was big industry, the competition was stiff and Tyrell was top of the line
-                            31 The spinner gently touches down
The hatch drops open and Deckard steps out
(
) His claim to fame was making a product more human than human and sometimes the 'more' turned out to be a problem
This wasn't just an escaped andy who broke his owner's arm -- there were twenty-eight people dead and the pressure was on

to a guard who checks it against a list on a screen
(
) But so far they'd always managed to keep it quiet
Not to say that once in a while there wasn't bad publicity
Some fanatic bitching about equal rights for andies or an occasional trade union proclaiming it was aun-American for automatons to take jobs away from humans on the colony
The guard hands Deckard back his
, pushed a button and Deckard walks away
(
) But what's more American than good old supply and demand
The Government needed them, industry made them and the church backed them

Otherwise 'd be out of a job

The young lady inside would look right standing on a cliff, hair blowing in the wind, looking out to sea in a 19th Century painting
Hello, Mr
Deckard
My name is Rachael
Deckard tips his head to her and steps in
-                   33 No woman can be all things to all men, the Rachael comes closer than most
The only trouble is she's all busi- ness
Formidable without really trying
Some beauty is better avoided and Deckard looks straight ahead
-                   33A The door slides open and they continue down the corri- dor
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit
humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard
If it's a benefit, it's not our problem
But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem
Correct, Mr
Deckard
- -  -    33B They pass into a canopied, air-filtered corridor
Deckard doesn't answer the question because he's looking at the animals
Small northern animals in neat "en- vironmental" cages
He looks at the rabbit, the raccoon and the squirrel, but the owl asleep on its perch stops him
The armed guard at the exit never takes his eyes off them
You like our owl
Deckard nods
Rachael claps her hands
The owl opens its yellow eyes and blinks at them
It's artificial
Of course not
Hands thrust in her pockets, she strides off towards the exit without looking back
The exit is another tube
Just big enough for two
No room for excess
He tries to ignore her cool appraising stare
You're in a very unique position, Mr
Deckard
You could affect the future of this entire organization according to how you work your little test
Deckard has nothing to say
Are you apprehensive
Why should  be
For the responsibility of your power
Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share
The door slides open
Deckard looks down at her
You got it wrong, girl
work with the bureau not for them
He lets it sink in
My job isn't to detect malfunctioning andies, it's to eliminate them
The more the better
He walks out of the elevator first
-                   34 The office is dimly lit, but highlights of resilience reside in the luster of the antique furnishings, like glimmers of gold in a darkened mine
Dr
Tyrell is a fragile man of power, with that look of "youth" obtained from steroids and surgery
Dapper and trim, he leans against the desk looking at an old fashioned pocket watch
The only sound is the insidious  of in the background
Tyrell taps a sensor on his desk
The door in front of Deckard and Rachael slides open
They enter a vestibule and face another door, this one befitting the decor of the office, Tyrell slips the watch into his pocket as they enter
Mr
Deckard
Dr
Eldon Tyrell
How do you do, Mr
Deckard
Please sit down
Would you care for a cup of coffee
Thanks
Black
Please
Tyrell pours from an old time sylex into small china cups and hands one to Deckard
The congenial light in his eyes could almost pass for warmth -- dragon warmth
Somehow,  didn't expect that the man who did the dirty work would be the man to do the technical work
Here you are, Mr
Deckard
He hands Deckard a cup of coffee
Is this to be an empathy test
Yes
Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response
Plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris
Deckard nods
May  ask a personal question
Go ahead
Have you ever retired a human by mistake
No
But in your profession that is a risk
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof
Like you said, Mr
Deckard, a machine can be a hazard
The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it
One that relies on human interpretation
Where's the subject
Sitting next to you
Deckard stares at Rachael, then back at Tyrell
Delighted, Tyrell takes a cup of coffee
Accepting the challenge, Deckard opens his briefcase and starts fishing out the apparatus
-                                       35 Rachael's eye fills the screen, the iris brilliant, shot with light, the pupil contracting
' Ready
Go ahead
In the soft green glow of the dials, the needles in both gauges are at rest
Dr
Tyrell stands silhouetted behind Deckard, who sits in front of Rachael, a pencil beam trained on her eye
Wire mesh discs are attached to her cheeks
You're given a calfskin wallet for your birthday
The needles in both gauges swing violently past green to red, then subside
wouldn't accept it
Also, 'd report the person who gave it to me to the police
You have a little boy
He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar
Again the gauges register, but not so far
'd take him to the doctor
You're watching
and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist
'd kill it
Both needles go to red
Deckard makes a note, takes a sip of coffee and continues
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl
Is this testing whether 'm an android or a lesbian
You show the picture to your husband
He likes it and hangs it on the wall
The girl is lying on a bearskin rug
wouldn't let him
Why not
should be enough for him
Deckard frowns, then smiles
His smile looks a little like a grimace or the other way around
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion
'd never get an abortion
Why not
That would be murder, Mr
Deckard
In your opinion
It would be my child
Sounds like you speaks from experience
He notes the needles
One goes green and the other remains inert
Last question
You're watching an old movie
It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters
Ugh
Both needles swing swiftly
The entree consists of boiled dog stuffed with rice
Needles move less
The raw oysters are less acceptable to you than a dish of boiled dog
Deckard moves the adhesive discs from her cheeks and switches off his beam
Lights please
The lights come on
Well
If she is, the machine works
The machine works
She is
Rachael sits very still
Except her eyes -- they go to Tyrell and hang on
He stares back at her as he speaks
How many questions did it take
Thirteen
Rachael sits rigidly in her chair, as the ground crumbles around her, her big mermaid eyes locked with Tyrell
His voice is quiet and strong, mesmerizing
She's hang- ing by a thread
Deckard watches with a bas taste in his mouth
She didn't know
Memory implant
She was programmed
But  think she has transcended her conditioning
think she was beginning to suspect
Rachael nods fixedly
Careful not to let go her grasp
How many questions does it usually take, Mr
Deckard
Five, maybe six
Slowly, carefully, Tyrell unlocks his gaze from Rachael and turns towards Deckard, who is starting to put away his equipment
You're going to have to be on your toes, my friend
Deckard glances back at him
It's a complex problem and we wouldn't want anything to happen to you
Less of a man might shrink at the end of Deckard's look, but not Tyrell
For the good of all,  recommend you take Rachael with you
Considering her uniqueness, 'm sure she could prove quite helpful
Deckard almost smiles at the nasty power of Tyrell's style
He turns away and starts packing up the Voight- Kampff
No thanks
Deckard is ready to go
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground
Discreetly
All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an Esper 231 -- believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced
Deckard opens the door
Mr
Deckard,  think it would be wise to reconsider my offer
Rachael sits there very pale and expressionless, her feet flat on the floor, alone is the word
Trying to keep the fury out of it, Deckard's voice comes out in a whisper
work alone
On the last word, Rachael glances up at him and Deckard turns away
The outer door slides open and he goes through it
-                                      36 As seen through the windshield from the passenger side of a vintage Dusenberg
The headlights cut through the dark, illuminating a narrow strip of mountain road downgrade
sign slides by stating:  "Caution Curves Ahead
" Good advice considering the sheer nightmare of a drop to the right and the wall of solid rock to the left
The steady  of the  and the  of the will remain, but the location suddenly changes to: -                                        37 pleasant place of soft light and domestic charm
The young lady in the short dress is vacuuming the rug
Her back to the viewer
As she bends over to vacuum beneath the couch, exposing her beautiful ass, an admonishment from a resonant and slightly tired intercedes
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard
' Sorry
Abruptly the    : -                                      38 The moon is up there slicing through the trees, strobing over the hood of the car
The road is getting steeper and the corners sharper
Rags of mist skim by as the Dusenberg picks up speed
It is becoming a riveting ride, but the passenger's mind moves elsewhere
-                                         39 Swift, soft clouds overhead
In the cold shine of the icy light,the viewer walks down an aisle of maples and beeches, their clean hard limbs deflecting the frosty light, and underfoot the crisp, blue-white snow, melted through in spots, exposing soggy patches of rich brown earth
Come on, stay with the machine
-                                      40 The Dusenberg is going faster now, headlights eating up the road
Rushing the corners in gut wrenching four- wheel drifts
Not a pleasant sensation if you don't like roller-coasters
The Dusenberg slides out of a corner and faces a couple hundred yards of straightway leading to the next bend
Good place for a breather, but the driver shifts into high and screws on
-                                          41 Cold and gray
The current running strong
The nose of a kayak points through the swells, the viewer paddling for the shore
This is cold remote country, wild and untouched
sky bluer than the Madonna's cloak
The kayak banks and the viewer steps out, moving over the sandy beach towards a little camp
We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard
Concentrate
' How do you know 'm not
You're not responding to the stimulus
can see right here, 'm not getting a reading
' 'm tired of this
Almost through
-                                      42 In the Dusenberg the driver turns to look at the passen- ger, his specter-like face obscured by shadow, but by the glint of teeth, he must have just smiled
And the passenger's view snaps back to the road
Suddenly another pair of headlights round the approach- ing bend
Large ones, of a bus or a truck
Blinding
The Dusenberg is going too fast to stop
No room to pass
The Dusenberg brakes, goes into a broadside skid
The hands of the passenger reach out and grip the mahogany dash
Brakes locked, , skidding
The Dusenberg tears through the railing and plunges into space
The last view of the passenger is pure vertigo
Silence
'  -                 43 The good doctor is bending over his glass-top desk which resembles a pin-ball machine
Displayed under its surface is a network of crisp electronic symbols and read-outs indicating the results of the test
Deckard detached the patches from his forehead, which it a little damp, but other than that, he looks no worse for wear, stands up to stretch and walks over to the doctor's desk
So how did  do
Dr
Wheeler is a thin boney man, aloof but a promise of compassion in his sunken eyes
Nerves of steel
No rust
didn't say that
Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time
Meaning
Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to
Deckard starts to dress
During the road test
Yeah
Your mind kept wandering
That bothered me
Huh huh
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy
True
Wheeler studies his "desk" for a moment and his finger comes down on the section illuminating Deckard's simple statistics
You got a birthday coming up
Deckard bends over slipping on his shoes
Wheeler looks up, concerned
But you haven't put in for emigration
Nope
You're going to be over the limit
Listen,  could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but  still rather be here than up there
What if you change your mind
They'll change the limit before change my mind
You sure
Never been more sure of anything in my life
Deckard is ready to go
Looking at Wheeler, a little touched with his concern
Why didn't you go
Too old
But if you could
Wheeler considers it a moment, smiles and shakes his head
My job is here
Me too
They shake hands and Deckard walks
'  -               44 The referee is bouncing around the ring, trying to keep up with the two Mexican light-weights pounding the shit out of each other
If not for the fuzz and the silence, the audio on the holoscope is off, you might think you were ringside at the Garden
It's a good fight but Pris isn't watching
She's got her feet up on the couch painting her toe nails
The room is so quiet you can almost hear the polish
She starts on her fourth toe when a form above It sounded like a  of a , but so quiet, sudden and over so fast it's hard to be sure
She stares at the ceiling a moment, then glances at Sebastian
On the other side of the room, in his own world, Sebastian is peering into his magnifier, soldering gossamer strands with a laser
Pris has crossed the floor and is closing the door quietly behind her
If the animoids nestled around the ledges of the room are capable of noticing, they'd be the only ones in the room who did
- '  -  -     45 Pris moving smoothly past the doors, some of them open and warped offering sights and shadow and decay
- '  -  -  46 The gloom in here is like the light of the empty well
Her feet against the metal steps reverberate in the hollow silence
'  -        47 She's running now, down the hall, stops at the apart- ment directly above Sebastian's and opens the door
'  -        48 Mary turns her head as Pris comes in
She's sitting in a chair
The only piece of furniture in the room
It's broken and tilts at a funny angle
She nods and Pris nods back
Batty is lying on his back, rolling his head slightly from side to side like he's soothing a stiff neck
What's going on down there
He's not ready yet
When
Tomorrow, he says
Batty nods he can't wait
Pris glances at Mary and gives a frigid little smile
Pris backs out and closes the door behind her
Batty blows air through his nostrils
Like an animal
'  -  -                     49 The sky is streaked with remnants of a lingering dusk
Prisms of light flash over the sheen of Deckard's car as he cuts off the freeway and sweeps down the off- ramp curve
/
-  -                          50 Moving through the dark city streets
Deckard turns a corner and guns it up a long, steep hill
- '  -                51 At the top of the hill the car pulls into a drive and disappears into the subterranean garage of a high-rise
'  -                52 He's coming down the hall carrying a foil wrapped plastic plate and stops in front of his door
It's riddled with locks
He slips a small device out of his pocket, aims it at the door and the locks unlock, the bolts slide open
He walks in and kicks the door shut behind him
'  -                         53 He slips on the light and crosses the front room
Deckard is a pack rat -- hard to tell if he just moved in or is just moving out
As he enters the kitchen, the  of him causes him to whirl around fast, hand snapped out in front of him, gun already in it
Rachael almost got shot
But she's unruffled, a little pale maybe, but direct as ever
There's a long, chilly moment, then she almost smiles as her eyes move to the plate on the floor
Was that your dinner
Deckard looks down at the over-turned plate and nods
'm sorry
called and found out you were on your way home
These were already delivered to your department but  thought you should have copies as soon as possible
She's holding out a cassette the size of a cigarette pack
But it's taking Deckard's adrenalin time to recede
It's the Nexus information you wanted
He takes the cassette, but a man with so many locks must be wondering how they were gotten through so easily
He doesn't even want to ask
Thanks
He realizes he's still got the gun aimed at her and sticks it back in his belt and they're left staring at each other
The situation makes awkward silence
At least for him
She's looking at him like she's got something to say but isn't saying it
Is there anything else
know you think it complicates your work, but 'm here to help
've already got more help than need
think you need more help than you've got
He doesn't, but she's not backing off
There's two reasons a man rejects help
Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it
Sounds like 'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no
Two of us might be more effective than one
work alone
She smiles
No you don't
She lets it sink in
You use your equipment, don't you
So
So, 'm a piece of equipment
Use me
It's a strong look that passes between them -- a long one
Maybe if he were on firmer ground he might do something about such an offer but
Deckard's eyes follow her down as Rachael bends to the floor and starts picking the food off the rug, put- ting it back on the plate
That's okay, 'll get it
He bends down to help, but she's already done it
Their heads a few inches apart
Something in her eyes diminishes the distance even more
Do  make you nervous
Yeah
'm sorry
And she is
And suddenly he is too
She hands him the plate and they stand
She's looking at the floor, almost shy, then she looks up and he's watching her
She says it plain and simple
It's strange to suddenly realize that what you thought was your life is actually someone else's fabrication
Deckard nods
He feels it, but doesn't know what to do about it
can imagine
Can you
couldn't
These are not some of Deckard's finer moments
But she doesn't seem to notice
part of me is glad
think feel more
don't like who  was before
Deckard nods, waits the respectable interval and is glad to have a plate to take into the kitchen
In the scrambled sanctuary of his kitchen Deckard looks around for a place to put the plate, but things have piled up on him in here
He contemplates the refrig- erator
So why do you think they were after their records
He's a lot more comfortable talking shop
They probably want to find out when they were made
Right
He dumps his dinner in the garbage and comes back out
She's writing something on a card
guess the date of your birth is important if you know you're not made to last
No way he can keep his foot out of it
She looks up and hands him the card
That's my number
If you need me
She goes to the door, opens it but hesitates before going through
You better get better locks -- if you want to keep me out
She looks back at him and smiles -- the smile says she's talking about all kinds of locks
Deckard looks like he might ask her to stay, but
Good night
And she's gone
Night
He looks down at the number
It's the back side of a snapshot
He turns it over
The picture of a man and a woman
The little girl between them looks like a six-year old Rachael
'  -                         54 He's sitting in front of his console studying pictures of Nexus Sixes at they appear, blank-faced, hairless and unadorned on his monitor
The over-lay machine is transforming each image with instant attributes; hair, moustaches, teeth, eye colors, age, youth, hats, glasses, etc
All in rapid succession, running the gambit from ominous to beautiful
(
) The possibilities were infinite
They could change their appearances but not their future
Like she said, it was short
Longevity is what they were after
The garbage man even wanted a past
Poor fuck
'd check it out but knew she was right
The market worked on turn-over
Built-in obsolescence was the name of the game
That meant her too
It was something  didn't want to think about
On top of the monitor there's an open can of beans with a spoon stuck in it
Deckard puts out his cigarette and reaches for them as the
Yeah
Bryant here
Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section
You better get on it
was just about to have my dinner
If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold
got a spinner on your roof in five minutes
Good luck
Deckard hangs up and looks at the beans
He didn't want them anyway
He gets up and walks to the bedroom
Looks through the pile of clothes on the floor, finds his ankle laser and straps it on
- '   -                      55 The spinner skirts through the canyons of the city
Deckard, sitting in the contoured seat, watches the maze of suspension bridges, platforms and catwalks swing by below
The tops of larger buildings shimmer with advertisements and weather announcements
-   -                         56 Deckard is cruising low and slow over the city listen- ing to Esper

Which would make her termination date

About to pull it in an already crowded lot, but the sign flashes "
"  Deckard doesn't believe in signs; is about to set it down any- way when a Chicano in a fluorescent coat runs out and waves him off
Fuck
Pissed, Deckard veers away and buzzes low over and around the roof tops, all dark and cramped -- not a lot of room around here
-                                       58 Finally brings it down between two buildings hardly enough clearance, but he jockeys the machine into an alley, touches down and runs it slowly along the surface -- parking it by a sign that says "

The pulsing neon over the entry says "'

Deckard is at the bar sitting next to a big-bellied man in a black beard who's looking through a viewer
On the small stage in the background   is eating razor blades, a part of her juggling routine
Deckard leaves the bar and walks down a hall towards a door at the rear
'  -                             61 Taffey's what's referred to in the trade as a "Chicken Hawk" collector of young girls
It must be so, there's one in the bed
Thin, pale, about thirteen years old, eyes rolled up under her fluttering eyelids, wires attached to her forehead, lying flat on her back in Taffey's crowded little room
Taffey's a little fella with wide hips and narrow shoulders, wears a jet black toupe and has a face like a seal
But at the moment he's not present
There's a  at the , then the  of a Taffey comes out of the bathroom, heart pounding under his polyester bathrobe, and approaches the door like the guilty fucker he is
He looks through the peeper
Deckard is out there holding up his
Taffey Lewis
Yes
Can  come in
There is a pause lasting the time it takes Taffey not to think of a way to say no
The door opens and Deckard enters
Except for the drool coming out of the corner of her mouth, and the fluttering eye-lids, Venus doesn't move a muscle
Excuse my niece there
She's studying for an exam
Deckard takes the  Identikit hard copies our of his pocket and pushing some junk out of the way, fans them out on the table
'd like  you to take a look at these pictures
Of course
Taffey bends down really close, peering at the pictures from about two inches away
You see  lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little
What am  supposed to be looking for
Do you recognize any of them
He stops at Zhora
This one looks familiar, but don't know
Naw
There's one came in today looks a little like this one but
What did she want
Who
The girl that doesn't look like that girl
Nothing
She wanted to know about suck night
What night
didn't know if  wanted to handle her --  already got a snake act
But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones
What's suck night
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks
Bit  don't think that's her
You talking about the Opera House on the Main
Taffey nods
Deckard goes to the door and turns
Book the good ones for where
Lots of places
The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties
What shows
Silicone Valley
Lots of these science guys never leave that place
We book two shows a month in there
Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd
It's starting to get a little gooey
Deckard tips his head good night and backs out of the door
-                         62 Onstage four Mexican acrobats, in matching metallic jumpsuits roll head over heels in their rendition of a human wheel
From the
system the Announcer's voice blares through the cavernous theatre
' Let's hear it for the Hermano Brothers
Scattered
Hand in hand, the Hermano Brothers bow deeply, spring up and trot offstage
' Next we're gonna see a little charmer who keeps her dancing partner in a basket
She comes to us all the way from exotic Casablanca
'Salome
' The old boys in the pit strike up a tinny version of "In a Persian Market" as  dances onstage
She's a black-haired beauty in a scant belly dancer costume, a couple of pounds overweight but all in the right places
She kneels ceremoniously center stage and sets the basket down before her
Carefully removing the lid, she reaches in and lifts out a four- foot harlequin-patterned python
Grinding her hips to the music, she rises, holding the coiling snake out like an offering
Sounds of approval from the audience
The gold coins covering her breasts jingle and shimmer, as she weaves sensuously around the floor
-                                   63 To scattered ,  and , Salome flounces offstage, the snake hung around her shoul- ders, looking limp, and makes her way through the narrow corridor to her dressing room
She's about to enter when: Excuse me, Miss Salome
She turns
Deckard's posture and attitude suggest hum- ble, sleazy persistence
He comes closer with his shit-eating grin
'd like to have a word with you if  could
Salome stands almost six feet high in her high heels -- she looks down on him with the haughty suspicion of a chick who knows how to handle cheap hits
Yeah
'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists
He holds up a hand as if to stop her from protesting
Don't worry, 'm not here to make you join -- that's not my department
He glances around like a guy who's not supposed to be there
'm an investigator for the Confidential Committee on Moral Abuses
She nods, taking it a little more seriously
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place
don't know nothing about it
You haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way
She's definitely puzzled
How do you mean 'exploited'
Like to get this position
Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person
Are you for real
Oh, yeah
You'd be surprised what goes on around here
'd like to check the dressing room if  could
What the fuck for
For holes
This guy might be an asshole but he's funny
don't believe this
She shrugs and they go in
-                               64 Musty and cramped
portable shower, a dressing table and not much else
Salome takes the snake from around her shoulders and lays it on the dressing table
Deck- ard watches it undulate into the warmth of the lights
It that mother real
Of course he's not real
You think 'd be working here if  could afford a real snake
It's a good job
You mean the snake
Deckard nods
There's not much costume to take off but she's doing it
The best
Does it eat
Come on
His hand reaches out to touch it
As his fingers make contact there's an electric "snap
"  He jerks his hand back from the shock
Jeezus
Sorry
Hey
Do your job but don't wreck mine, huh
She slides behind the screen and turns on the shower
Deckard starts creeping around pacing around the room like he's inspecting the walls
They have their ways of doing their dirty work without the victim knowing what's going on
His eyes are moving over everything she's got
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body
bet  would
Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress
And to his amazement he actually spots one
It's down low on the wall
Not a good idea to turn his back on work but he can't resist
And what if somebody did try to 'exploit' me
Who do  go to
Through the hole Deckard is looking at a pair of fat legs
Me
And who do  go to about you
He looks back
She's some out of the shower dripping nude
She's taken off her black wig
Her hair is short and blonde
Deckard recognizes her immediately from the identikit
He stares at her a moment too long
Hmmmmm
Deckard grins and she returns it
She takes a towel off the table and starts to dry her body
The snake noses through the cosmetics, tongue flicking trying to get back to its mistress
Absently, she reaches out to stroke the snake and suddenly laughs
You ever get the feeling things aren't the way they seem
Her hand closes around the snake's head
Deckard sees it coming but can't move fast enough
She strikes him so hard it knocks him off his feet
Before he hits the floor, she kicks him in the stomach
The snake whistles through the air again as Deckard rolls out of the way
It slams down so hard it ruptures against the floor
He goes for his laser, but she's already out the door
-                                  65 Deckard bounds out of the room and sees her go through a door at the other end of the hall
He sprints after her, arrives at the door and flings it open
Black- ness
The  of her high heels  down the metal steps
-   -                        66 It's raining heavily
The front of the Opera House is open only to foot traf- fic these days
bizarre place on a Friday night, hawkers and whores, the rabble, the poor and the cur- ious mill around the randy-built platforms and brightly lit stands
Zhora, in just a raincoat, is not out of place in this flea market atmosphere
Trying not to run, she slices through the mob as quickly as she can
Deckard is not far behind, dodging and side-stepping, trying to move against the tide of people scurrying for shelter
She comes to an intersection and turns out of the mall onto a less crowded street
She glances over her shoulder as she breaks into a run and runs right into a couple of pedestrians
All three go down
Deckard comes out of the crowd in time to spot her get- ting to her feet
She sees him and runs
The two ped- estrians are in his line of fire
He runs past them and drops to one knee, leveling his laser
Stop or you're dead
She doesn't
The beam flashes through the air, but she's already around the corner
With his bottom lip between his teeth, it hurts to move so fast, Deckard jack-legs it into the street and jumps in front of the first car coming
It screeches to a stop
Deckard scrambles for the door, but the guy be- hind the wheel has other ideas
He peels out fast
The next car slows down and swerves trying not to hit him
Deckard goes for the door and before the old ma- tron inside can lock it, Deckard's yanked it open and jumps in
She screams as he pushes her into the pas- senger seat and jams the car into a wrenching about face
The lady squeals like a pig as the momentum plasters her against the door
Deckard slams it around the corner and guns it down the street
It's long and it's empty and it's going by fast
Nothing the old lady cares to see -- she's got her hands over her eyes, whimpering, hoping she'll faint before she dies
Deckard takes the next left so hard he almost lays it over
As the car bounces off the curb he floors it
Zhora's a hundred yards ahead, halfway down the street, trying to make it back into the crowded mall
She's running fast, but the car is faster
As he passes her, Deckard hits the brakes and skids broadside seventy feet
The door flies open and he rolls out
Zhora's ducking it with no where to go, except
The showcase window on her left  as she crashes through
It's a corner shop joined to a series of stores, front- ing the mall
Deckard runs to the opening she's made and pours  through the tunnel of her jagged wake as Zhora breaks through one window after another, getting sliced, getting shot, trying to get away from Deckard's laser
But she doesn't
His last shot burns a hole through the base of her skull
It kills her but doesn't stop her
Her speed takes what's left of her through the last two windows and into the street where she runs into a parked car with such force that she embeds herself in the side of it
Hunched over, breathing hard, Deckard comes slowly for- ward
The crowd starting to gather
There's something for everybody and they're coming from all directions
Deckard moves through them, edging to have a look
It's not a good thing to see
It looks like Salome and the car tries to eat each other
bloody feast of metal and flesh
Deckard bows his head, sick, exhausted
So much commo- tion he doesn't notice   closing in from behind
Drop it
Deckard has his back to them
They're fanned out and crouched, ready to fire
Deckard drops his laser
Two of them rush up, spin him around while the third does a frisk
arrive, wary and wild-eyed, pushing the people back -- his is not a good place for cops
Deckard's ankle laser is discovered by the Cop frisking him
With a snarl he pulls it out and hands it back to the  covering the action
On your belly
Deckard's not in the mood for it
Listen, Sergeant
He's reaching for his
The Cop with the rubber billy hits him in the head
One thrill after another
Somebody in the crowd
The last thing Deckard hears as he falls
The Cop reaches inside Deckard's coat for the concealed weapon they missed, but it's an  card
He looks at it for a moment, then looks up
Hey, Sarge, this guy's a cop
An embarrassing situation
Clear this fuckin' crowd
The Cops start pushing
And for one split second one of the crowd looks a lot like Leon
- '  -                67 Your standard low class crapper
Bryant is planted firmly on the cracked tile floor next to the urinals rubbing his face, trying not to pop the clutch in his anger
This is a public place, he doesn't want to yell
Just because it's a Nexus 6 doesn't change procedure
little known fact can become a well-known fact and part of our job, Deckard, is to make sure that doesn't happen
Now how can be do that if you blow one away in front of a fuckin' audience
It's not the sort of question that expects an answer
Deckard's washing his face in the basin hoping it'll all go away
Well
Deckard looks up dripping, reaches for a paper towel
Bryant slaps one in his hand
She was gonna get away
Then let her get away
thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker
Bryant takes a couple of deep breaths
'd say you got a little carried away
Deckard's voice is barely audible
didn't like her
You didn't like her
He slams the handle on one of the urinals
You start liking or disliking andies it's time to hang it up
The   and  and
There's nothing to do but nod
Deckard nods
Poor bastard has had a rough night
Bryant pulls a flask out of his coat and hands it to him
Deckard puts it to his mouth and Bryant watches Deckard's Adam's apple like he's count- ing the swallows
Deckard hands it back empty
Bryant caps it, puts it back in his pocket
Look, go home
Get some rest
Take an aspirin
Yeah
Bryant shuffles out like an old bear
-  -                       68 Cheap whiskey and bad wine
That's the kind of place this is
It's near closing
But still a few at the bar
Alcoholic silhouettes
In the b
g
Deckard comes down the passage from the men's room and stops at the phone
He gets a number out of his pocket and calls it
As he talks he leans against the wall, his body language intimate and chummy
Not much action at the bar other than somebody snoring and a dipso down at the end having a conversation with himself
Deckard hangs up, walks to the bar and straggles a stool
The 's a big lady with tits like sand bags and a voice that plays no favorites
can't protect your drinks, mister; while you was in the potty, this hummer snatched it
Deckard glances at his stool-mate
huge , slumped over the bar like a beached whale
No problem
Gimme another
The whale doesn't move, but it speaks, with a gravelly Russian accent
Forgive me
thought was free drink
will pay
Forget it
But the big man's digging through his pockets
Deck- ard's drink arrives and the Russian raises his head
It's a big melancholy face with a glint of warmth in his red-rimmed eyes and a smile that could melt your heart
But it's Leon
think  have no money
It's okay
Forget it
But  would like to buy you drink
'll but you one
What'll you have
Vodka
Shot of vodka, please
Thank you very much
My pleasure
Deckard brings out his smokes
Offers one
Leon takes it and they light up
The drinks come
Prosit
Prosit
Down the hatch
Leon slaps his glass on the bar, reach- es into his pocket, brings out a little match box and slaps that down too
It's done with such pride that Deckard has to look
You want to see my friends
Sorry, don't have the time
No problem
Leon smiles broadly and with ceremonious care opens the box and dumps three live cockroaches on the bar
Those cockroaches
Ya
Deckard looks interested
One of them starts to scamp- er away, but Leon walls off the next with his huge hand
How long you had these guys
Two months
But this one is not guy
It is girl
His girl
Leon leans closer like he doesn't want the cockroaches to hear
Usually Blackie waits until Igor is eating; then, when his back is turned, he tries to take advantage of Anna
Deckard nods, definitely interested
He signals the bartender for another round
The drinks arrive
Prosit
Prosit
Down the hatch
Their eyes meet at the bottom
You never saw a cockroach make love
Deckard shakes his head, but he'd like to
Leon smiles slyly
We will try
Leon brings a cube of sugar out of his pocket and puts it on the bar
They both lean down and watch intently
The drinks come and are put away, but the cockroaches are not cooperating
It must be that he is not hungry or maybe she is not hot
Leon is catching the roaches and one by one puts them back in their box
He holds up the last and kisses it
You like to kiss her goodbye
No thanks
Make sure you take your girlfriends with you when you leave
What neither of them notices is that between Leon's fingers, his stub of his cigarette is burning his flesh
Deckard lifts his glass, it is empty
like you
like you too
One more, eh
gotta piss
Deckard gets on his feet, leans forward like a man in a stiff wind and stops
think 'll piss outside
Leon watches his walk a perfect straight line through the bar down the passage and out of the rear exit
-    -                     69 Deckard reels out
The door swings shut and he's sober as hell and moving fast
Around the big trash dumpster alongside the building, he plasters himself against the wall and his gun is out, aimed at the door
He's in a good spot with a perfect line of fire
Moments go by and he's glad for the time to steady himself
The of his , the  of the city and the quiet
Suddenly from behind, Deckard is swept off his feet and twirled around in Leon's bear-trap embrace
Leon lets go and Deckard hits the pavement, skidding hard enough to tear clothes and burn skin, but he rolls out of it and comes up with gun in hand; but Leon is so fast he's already there and kicks it out of his hand
Leon moves towards him, backing Deckard against the wall
How come you know where Zhora was so quick
His hand is lightning
It shoots out, grabs Deckard's hair
showed pictures
Somebody recognized her
went to see
Deckard is pale
The sweat is starting to run
How old am
don't know
The grip tightens and twists
My birthday is April 10, 2015
How long do  live
Four years
He lets go
More than you
Deckard's knees come up fast
Leon's fist comes down faster, like a hammer
Painful to live in fear, isn't it
Deckard is doubled over, hugging his thigh
But that's how it is to be a slave
The future is sealed off, he grovels, he waits
Even hurt, Deckard is fast
He goes for his ankle gun, but Leon's got it out of his hand before he can even raise it and throws it down the alley
Deckard hurls forward, knocking him off balance, and scrambles to get away
Leon grabs him by the foot, drags him back and jerks him off the ground
Sex, reproduction, security, the simple things
But no way to satisfy them
To be homesick with no place to go
Potential with no way to use it
Lots of little oversights in the Nexus 6
He slams Deckard into the wall
tell you, nothing is worse than having an itch you can never scratch
Deckard slides down the wall to his knees and huddles, protecting his head with his arms, waiting for the next one
Leon folds his big hands together and raises them over his head, pausing just a second to savor the satisfac- tion of smashing Deckard's skull
The spasm that runs through Leon's face is not from satisfaction
It's the bullet that went through his neck
He hits the ground hard, his big teeth biting the air like a rabid dog
Dead
Rachael is standing in the alley
Deckard lies there looking at her
She comes slowly and quietly forward and drops Deckard's gun by his side
Deckard gets to his hands and knees and tries to get up, but can't quite manage it
He looks up at her, panting, spits blood and almost smiles
Like  said,  don't need your help
After a long moment, she bends down to touch him
You look terrible, you know that
'  -  -              70 He's lying in the tub with a drink, eyes half mast, water up to his chin, bruised and beat, but looking just a little wicked in his balmy luxury
(
) knew a cop once who was involved in a high-speed chase
They shot out one of his tires and he went over a cliff at hundred and fifty miles an hour
They found him in the morning with a broken skull, six fractured ribs and second- degree burns
On the way to the hospital he made a play for the nurse
He takes a drink and clears his throat
Hey
thought you were supposed to be taking care of me
' What do you need
He doesn't answer
Lies there sipping his drink
Rachael comes in a little uncertain, a little droll, and stands there looking down at him
Don't just stand there looking at me
It's not polite
What do you want me to do
Sit
She sits on the edge of the tub
Gimme your arm
She's wearing a short-sleeved dress
It's a long, del- icate arm and Deckard holds it, inspecting it like a maestro with a Stradivarius
He looks up at her
You ever take a bath with a man before
There's a lot  haven't done with a man before
He's got her hand in the water and had begun to soap her arm
Starting with her wrist and running the bar to her elbow, up and down, slow and slippery
She watches, not quite sure of the ritual
He pulls her closer, and runs his hand up higher, mould- ing and pressing, working around her flesh, up and under her arm into the privacy of her dress
You're getting me wet
Oh, yes
For a moment Deckard stares at her like some furry-legged satyr in rut, the fingers of his other hand rake through her hair and into the water she comes
'  -  -             71 The bed looks like it was hit by a storm and Deckard looks like something that was washed up in it
He's spread out flat, face creased and puffed
His eyes squint open, but only for a moment
His hands are more reliable
They search over the bed, but find it bare
He edges his head over the side, looking around for signs, but she's all gone
He gets up in two stages, sits and then stands
Then sits again, resting his head in his hands
'  -  -            72 Deckard's got his face in the mirror shaving it
It's been a long night
Nothing a new tongue and a trans- fusion wouldn't put right
He moves a couple of inches to the left so his eyes have a view of the tub
'  -   -         73 Deckard is on the edge of the couch with the phone on his knees, the card with Rachael's number in his lap and having no luck
' Sorry,  am not in at the moment, but if you'll leave your name and number 'll return your call as soon as  can
That's not soon enough
Deckard hangs up, puts the phone on the floor and leans back on the couch
Fuck you, then
'  -                  74 The rooster perched on the chair spreading its scrawny wings, strains from the tips of its toes, crowing at the ceiling
Between crows there's a  at the door
You might call this a "barnyard" apartment
There's straw on the floor and several hens roosting against the back wall
The front door opens a few inches and Sebastian pokes his head in
Mr
Deetchum
Hello
Nobody seems to be home except his chickens
As Sebas- tian enters, closing the door behind him, a goose charges out of the bedroom hissing and honking
Now, now, Waddles
Seeming to recognize Sebastian as no intruder, Waddles veers off from the attack
As Sebastian crosses the room a pig peeks out from behind the couch
Hello, Wrigley
He goes to the chickens and collects some eggs, putting them into a bowl he's brought
He puts down the bowl and reaching into his pocket carefully counts out the payment and puts the money on a plate
He's about to leave but notices there's no water in the dispenser
Mr
Deetchum isn't taking very good care of you people
Pouring from a jug on the table, he fills the dispenser with water, scatters a little grain on the floor, gets his bowel of eggs and leaves
Wrigley grunts and comes out from behind the couch for a long drink
- '  -              75 Sebastian arrives on his floor, walks down the hall to his apartment, opens the door, walks in
'  -                         76 He turns to close door, comes face to face with Roy Batty
Sebastian drops his bowl of eggs
Batty's hand flashes out and catches it
Whoops
Smiling, Batty hands them back to Sebastian, who is too startled to speak
Pris runs up and gives Batty and Mary a big hug, steps back effusing and smiling, everybody's favorite teen- ager
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian
Hello, glad to meet you
He pumps Sebastian's free hand
And my Aunt Mary
Sebastian turns and there's Aunt Mary, modest and warm
And this is my savior,
Sebastian, everybody
Sebastian stands there with his eggs, bashful and ex- cited, the hero of this little family's warm attention
Can't thank you enough, Mr
Sebastian
If you hadn't come along
We were worried to death
It's awfully kind of you
Sebastian is nodding and smiling
We're not used to the big city
Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost
You certainly have a nice place here
Well stocked
Batty looks around admiringly
Sebastian mumbles some- thing that sounds like "Thank you
" Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much
keep a lot of provisions right here
like a man who stays put
An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times
You live here all by yourself, do you
Well, no, not really
There's Mr
Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor
Everybody nods
long pause
We haven't found it easy, Mr
Sebastian
They glance around the room, waiting for Sebastian to pick up the ball
How about breakfast,  was just going to make some
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother
a little bite to eat would be
Oh, no bother, 'd be glad to
Well, actually We're famished
Sebastian is truly happy
Okay, then
You make yourselves comfortable and 'll bring the food right out
He disappears into the kitchen
Batty looks happy with the way things are going
Charming
Pris comes up close
Her tone muted but demanding
Well
Batty finds her attitude amusing, which makes her even more pugnacious
want to know what's going on
There's a punitive edge to Batty's response
There's only three of us left
Pris is shocked
Her whisper comes out a hiss
Then we're stupid and we'll die
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home
How are things at home
little spotted pig on the table sits up
Home again, jiggidy jig
They all turn and stare at the pig
Batty is delighted
don't trust him
don't think he knows what he's doing
The - from the microwave goes off in the kitchen
He knows what he's doing
If he won't cooperate
Mr
Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated
We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate
-                    77 Holden is laid out in an apparatus that resembles an iron lung
little above his head, facing him, is a bank of bio-feedback lights registering body functions
Deckard is in a chair sitting next to his friend
Holden has lost weight, his face is grey, he can't move his head, but he's smiling like the cat who ate the canary
How are you doing, old man
Holden's voice is just a whisper -- the kind of whisper that comes out of the joker at the back of the class
'm great
mean,  know 'm not really great, but  feel just great
How you like my new suit
Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled
Holden's eyes close, his smile gets bigger and little spasms of laughter pump out of his mouth
Don't make me laugh
It makes me pee
Sorry
Hey, it's okay
like to pee
So how are you doing
'm doing okay
From what  hear you're doing great
Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army
Making a lot of money, huh
Yeah
(pause) But that's what  wanted to talk to you about
Money
No
got a problem
Let's hear it
think 'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes
Holden giggles
Starts to laugh again
blue light on the panel begins to turn very bright
They both notice it
What's that
'm taking a piss
They wait for the light to abate
Let me ask you something, Deck
You been having intimate relations with one of these units
Deckard doesn't deny it
Holden smiles like a cherub
That's what  thought
one of the liabilities of the trade -- you has sex with your prey, old buddy
That's bound to create problems, unless you're a black widow
Deckard has to wait for him to stop giggling
What about -- not sex -- but love
Holden bites his bottom lip to keep the laugher out of his voice, but he can't
Love is just another name for sex
Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- don't care what you call it, an android can't have it
These aren't just
know what they are, Deck -- Look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way
Holden stops talking for a moment to get some air
Believe me, take it from an old pro, no matter how good we get, we're never gonna make an artificial anything that can feel
It's a contradiction
You might as well go fuck your washing machine
Holden laughs, Deckard doesn't
Just go out there and keep up the good work
Holden's whispers have become harder to hear
Got to save it, Deck, 'm getting sleepy
It's been good talking to you
Deckard stands
Thanks
But he's already asleep
Deckard stands there a moment looking at him, then walks out
'  -                           78 He's sitting on the couch, glum, contemplative
There's a
His eyes move to the door
Those locks are opening again
Rachael comes in
Looks surprised to see him
Him too
told you 'd come back
You did
You didn't hear me
You were sleeping
He likes that
Are you glad 'm here
He is
She's spunky
Hasn't seen this place in the daytime
Pleased, he watched her move around the mess
She spots a little framed photograph
Picks it up
It's a man with a shotgun and a boy holding up a quail
Who is this
Me and my dad
Where is he
Dead
Oh
She puts it down and comes to him
How come you're not on the job
am
Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out
How are you doing
Not too good
She sits next to him
Pleased as hell, they both sit there staring straight ahead
He looks at her
She looks at him
What do people do in the afternoon
If they are smart, they take naps
'  -                             79 They're under the sheet
Rachael is on her back, look- ing at the ceiling, hair sprawled like sea grass over the pillow
Deckard lies next to her, a man studying a treasure
Do you dream
Yeah
Sometimes
wish  could
His hand moves over her shoulder
Wishing is a kind of dreaming
His hand goes under the sheet
mean asleep
She feels good
He moves closer
Did you cry when your father died
Yeah
That's another thing  can't do
He kisses her lightly on the cheek
Nobody is freer than when he dreams
read that
It wasn't very good last night, was it
don't know,  have nothing to compare it to
guess thought there was something more to it
What
don't know
think  missed something
Like
'm not sure
Is there a secret
Her face is close
She's looking right at him
Her lips are right there
don't know
If there is 'd like to find it
Slowly their lips touch and his arms slide under her body
'  -                         80 Batty, Pris and Mary sit at the table staring at their host
Sebastian is staring back, his fork halfway to his mouth, looking from face to face
Although nothing is being said, he's totally comfortable, as much at home with them as he is with his animoids
Why are you staring at us
You're just all so
so different
Batty nods his head, smiling, sending home the fact and Sebastian is certainly getting it
What, Sebastian
You're androids
long pause
What makes you think so
You're all so perfect
Sebastian is smiling from ear to ear
What generation are you
Nexus - 6
Sebastian whistles
Mary's head is shaking slightly
Pris gets up and moves to the couch
Batty couldn't be more pleased
We can trust Sebastian, ladies
He's been working with mechanisms all his life
He's a wizard and a very perceptive man
Sebastian looks like a kid on Christmas Eve
Could you
His voice is trembling
Show me something
Like what
Like
Like a million things, but he's too excited to think of one
We're not computers, Sebastian, we're physical
Pris perks up proudly
think, therefore  am
Very good, Pris
Now show him why
It's a command Pris is pleased to obey
She sits quiet- ly a moment, hands folded in her lap, prim and proper
Mary doesn't like these displays, but Batty is beaming
Those hands in Pris' lap suddenly move, almost faster than the eye can see and slam down on either side of her, digging into the material with such ferocity that Sebastian jumps
She plunges into the guts of the couch up to her elbows and comes up holding springs and stuff- ing
Except for the clenched teeth, she is smiling like an angel
Sebastian is riveted, his eyes wide and astounded, like he's just seen the devil
He laughs nervously, glad that the devil is a friend
We have a lot in common
You mean that you can't come here and  can't go there
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems
Accelerated decrepitude
But we don't want to die quite yet
Of course not
You could help us
don't know much about biomechanics, Roy
wish  did, but you're out of my league
If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live
Sebastian sneaks a glance
Pris is staring at him with big childlike eyes, Sebastian looks back at Batty, moved but helpless
What about your friend, the man who owns this building
Dr
Tyrell
Batty nods
He's not really my friend
just do a job for him now and then
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian
He could
His company made us
'd be happy to mention it to him
Be better if  could talk to him in person
But he's not an easy man to get to
No
When do you deliver your project
This afternoon
Batty leans forward and looks right into Sebastian's eyes
Will you help us
There's no way Sebastian could say no, even if he wanted to
Yes
Pris sits up smiling
Mary sighs a breath of relief and Batty leans back nodding in gratitude
'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian
What do you think, Mary
don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us
Pris
Pris gets up and comes to Sebastian and kisses him
That has a lot of impact
Sebastian looks around try- ing to keep the tears from coming
You're our best and only friend
Thank you
'   -                   81 Rachael is lying across the bed in one of Deckard's shirts, her chin over the edge, her eyes moving around the room
Deckard lies next to her
Looking like a man who died a voluptuous death
When was the last time you cleaned this place
Hmmm
Have you ever cleaned your apartment
Don't be fooled by appearances
It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody
He rolls over to admire her legs
Because they would ruin the arrangement
He kisses the back of her thigh
They could clean around the arrangement
don't like people snooping around my stuff
He kisses her other thigh, gets up and goes into the bathroom
' There's a vacuum in the front room closet is you wanna give it a try
Rachael lies there a moment, then gets up and goes into the front room and opens the closet door
The vacuum is not easy to get to, but finally she wrestles it out
As she starts to plug it in -- Oh no, don't do that
He's wrapped in a sheet, watching her from the doorway
But if  don't plug it in how can Never mind the plug, just go through the motions
But then how can you
don't like the noise
Just practice
Practice makes perfect
She stares at him like he's nuts
'm serious
Go ahead
Show me how you would do it
Reluctantly she makes some half-hearted passes with the thing
How about under the couch there
Come on
She bends over to get it
Deckard pulls up a chair and sits down with his chin in his hands
She looks back at him
This feels stupid
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid
Part of your education
She drops the vacuum and sits on the floor
Deckard gets up and comes towards her
Her eyes travel halfway down his sheet and she leaves
You're sick, Deckard
never felt better

Sebastian's humble truck parked among richer relations, including a spinner and a 1928 Dusenberg
-                               83 The den
It contains a collection of big game trophies, and among all this sits Sebastian very straight and proper with an "egg" the size of a basketball in his lap
Old Hannibal Chew was right, the rich make you wait
Sebastian stands and carefully makes his way between the trophies to a window with a view of the grounds
-                          84 Tyrell's young  sits on the diving board watching her husband in the pool with their youngest
And two older  swim around trying to outdo each other for their dad's attention
From the sidelines an old servant pauses to watch the fun, then continues with a tray of mugs towards the house
-                                      85 And beyond on a plateau overlooking the grounds, a figure stands watching, waiting like a bird of prey
-                              86 On a gravel path between shrubs of winter roses, Tyrell turns to observe the last quiet light over his kingdom
The moment is sweetened by the    of one of the animals
He strolls by an old gardener who tips his cap, pro- ceeds up the steps and into his mansion
-                                  87 Next to a tray of cookies and milk, Sebastian sits pa- tiently with the "egg" in his lap
As the door opens he gets to his feet expectantly
It's , Tyrell's bodyguard
He could play the Giant in Jack and The Beanstalk
Okay, 'll take that now
Sebastian would rather put it in the boss's hands, but Styles takes it and is almost through the door when Sebastian stops him
Wait
He almost forgot
Can't fly without the pilot
Sebastian hands him a little box
Styles stuffs it in his pocket and shuts the door behind him
-                             88 Motionless and monumental, six buffalo stand like stat- ues in the grass
Suddenly they swing their shaggy heads to watch something pass
In the dark silence Batty stops to look at the curious beasts and then moves soundlessly towards the mansion
-                          89 It's a medieval-sized hall
The piece de resistance is an 18th Century, English painting of an Arab stallion, gleaming like coal over the  fireplace
The entire family is seated at the table which glitters for the festive occasion
Presents gathered around the oldest child
Styles hands the "egg" to Tyrell
hush falls over the table
This is Dad's big present
Tyrell sets is down before the boy
is a fresh, slim lad who is ten today
He looks up at his father, then, beaming, pries open the "egg's" hinged lid
Tyrell's hand goes to his pocket and the griffon steps out of the shell
Oh
Basically an avian invention, it has wings and plumage, the head of an eagle, the body of a lion and weighs no more than eight pounds
It cranes its neck and testing its balance, stands on one leg and then hops to the edge of the table and into the air
The littlest tot claps her hands as the griffon beats its wings rapidly and rises towards the ceiling
Turn- ing in a forty-five degree, it suddenly drops into a dive
Delighted, the children shriek and scream as the griffon swoops over their crouching heads and sails the length of the hall -- its silhouette flickering briefly over the ancestral portraits of the Tyrell clan
Reaching the end of the room, it banks sharply and flies back towards the table, cups its wings, spreads its tail and comes in for an awkward landing
They're laughing and clapping as it waddles down the table and knocks over a glass and stops in front of Ian
Papa
Did you make this
No
We can make man, but not a griffon
He bends down and kisses his wife
Have to give the cottage industry a chance too
Pleased he excuses himself and heads for the den
-                                  90 Tyrell comes in and sits behind his desk
Sebastian hands down the invoices
Tyrell glances over them and writes out a check
He looks up to hand it over when he sees Batty against the wall, by the door
For a fraction of a second he's shocked, but recovers fast
friend of yours, Sebastian
Yes, this is someone who wants to talk to you, Dr
Tyrell
Batty smiles
The name is Batty
Roy Batty
Oh
Very slowly Tyrell's hand moves towards the back side of the desk
To act without understanding could lead to the very thing the act seeks to avoid
What's in Batty's eyes completes the warning
Tyrell decides to heed it
little talk it all  need
Tyrell looks at Sebastian
Considers consequences
Back to Batty
Would you like to talk in private then
Batty thinks it over
Yeah
It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian
Why don't you go home
Here's your check, my boy
Thank you
Thank you, Dr
Tyrell
'll see you later
He slips out closing the door behind him
Opens it again and sticks his head it
Was everything okay
Just beautiful
He's gone
If Tyrell is scared he's doing a good job of concealing it
'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker
And what can he do for you
Can the maker repair what he makes
Would you like to be modified
Had in mind something a little more radical
What's the problem
Death
'm afraid that's a little out of my
Batty cuts in with a whisper
want more life, fucker
Come here
Batty walks forward
Sit down
Batty does
The facts of life
'll be blunt
To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal
coding sequence can't be revised once it's established
Why
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship
The ship sinks
What about
recombination
We've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table
Batty nods grimly
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed  strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again
but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you
But not to last
Put it this way
Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were
But 'm afraid you're a Ferrari
high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last
Batty smiles bitterly
Also you're too valuable to experiment with
am
Tyrell can't help a flash of pride
The bast of all possible androids
We're proud of our prodigal son -- glad you're returned
You're quite a prize
Shoulders hunched, Batty looks down, an uncharacteristic note of guilt in his voice
've done some questionable things
Also extraordinary things
Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for
They share a laugh
In spite of himself, there's a look of relief in Tyrell's face as Batty extends his hand
Tyrell takes it and they shake
The reverence in Bat- ty's eyes caused Tyrell a fatherly smile
The smile turns into a growl as he feels the bones in his hands crack
Before the scream comes out of his mouth, Batty stifles it
Tyrell claws at the iron fingers, but they're sinking into his face
Placing his other hand behind Tyrell's head, Batty squeezes them together and squashes the man's head like a melon
The mess is not small
Palms up, like a surgeon, Batty walks to the drapes and wipes off the gore and without looking back, strolls out of the room
-    -                    90A Styles is coming down the hall
He sees Batty coming towards him
Styles looks at him curiously, this is not one of the guests
As they close, Batty smiles
Could you tell me where the bathroom is
Styles doesn't get a chance to answer
Batty's hand has torn into his crotch
The man is lifted off the floor, up the wall and held a moment
Whatever is encased in his pelvis is pulverized
Batty lets go
Styles hits the floor
He died of shock
Grinding his teeth, Batty continues towards the
-                                 91 The birthday cake has arrived, the candles lit
They're waiting for Dad
Mrs
Tyrell looks around to find Batty observing from the doorway
little startled, a little curious, but ever the cor- porate wife, she smiles
May  help you
Batty smiles back and shakes his head in mock regrets
-                                     92 In the sink the faucet is on
The water pink with blood
Batty is washing his hands
portly maid emerges from the pantry
Batty looks up
She stops, embarrassed at being caught
Her eyes no- tice drops of blood on the floor and follow them to the door
When she looks back, Batty is right in front of her
'  -                           93 Books scattered on the bed
Rachael sitting cross- legged with one in her lap, looking through exquisite shots of nature
Deckard is next to her, watching her like a lover, like a father
(
) She'd never seen the great outdoors
Never even seen books on the subject
She went through everything  had, and we talked
And there were subjects we didn't discuss and they were words we didn't say,  couldn't say, like death, like future, like real
But it was hard because she was curious and full of questions
She was more alive than anyone 'd ever known
She looks up stunned by the beauty of a photo, but with no need to comment
It's in her eyes
She stares at him, a revelation taking shape
You and  are good friends, huh
He considers it and she stares at him, smiling at the wonder of it
It's so easy
Convinced and not convinced, he nods his head
She laughs at his solemnity
She's irresistible
Deckard's pretty irresistible himself
Have you ever known anybody a long time
You mean a woman
Uh-huh
What's a long time
Ten years
Nope
Nobody could stand me that long
The  on the  next to the bed
He reaches out and brings it to his ear
Yeah
This is Bryant
Are you alone
Yeah
She's not with you
Who
pause
Take a number
Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South
Got it
Okay, here it is
Eldon Tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred
The cat is about to get out of the bag
Pressure is definitely on
The Nexus program is terminated
When you finish there, locate Nexus designated Rachael and retire
Deckard says nothing
If you don't, we will
It has to be total, Deckard
That's an order from as high as it comes
Got it
Yeah
got it
Go
He hangs up the receiver and gets up
She watches him from the bed
The gun goes into his belt
He loads the ankle job and straps it on
She watches every move
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder
Because it's not
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it
Do you think  simulated what happened between us
No,  don't
Without looking at her, he puts on his jacket
He's standing in the middle of the floor with his back to her
He turns and they're facing one another
Neither of them moves
Don't leave here
Don't open the door, don't answer the phone
What difference will it make
Just wait here
He goes to the door
You know what  think
What
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me
He has to laugh
You know what else  think
What
This was the best day of my life
He turns and goes through the door
'  -                       94 Sebastian is putting his work table in order, but his mind is not with it and his hands are trembling
Batty, Pris and Mary are on the other side of the room talking:  their voices low
Let's go while there is still time
Where
Anywhere
Batty smiles
What's the point
Not to be trapped
You underestimate the trap, Mary
Sebastian has almost reached the door
Where are you going, Sebastian
Just thought 'd
No, you stay here with us
Out last night together
They all watch
Sebastian walks away from the door
Think of yourself as a light, Mary
Shine before you're turned off
She's too fragile for that logic, but it appeals to Pris
She and Batty hold a look that burns
Sebastian is by the window
Someone is coming here
Batty goes to the window and looks down
One man
(he smiles) He must be good
Then go get him
That wouldn't be very sporting
Sebastian looks ready to bolt
Batty puts an arm around him
want to do it
Okay, but don't kill him
Save a little for everybody masterpiece
pause
Turn out the lights, Pris
'  -                       95 In the dim, nocturnal light, Deckard crosses into the courtyard fronting the building and stops
He looks around
Nobody there, just silence
He comes closer to the building and stands in the sha- dows off to one side of the entry
His head jerks up to the
Sebastian comes hurtling down and explodes into the pavement thirty feet below
Deckard's eyes move up the line of descent, the shat- tered window on the next-to-top floor
'   -                 96 Not much to see, But Deckard misses none of it as he crosses the floor and positions himself in the spot of least exposure
He looks around
Elevator and stair- well
Close to the wall, he moves towards the elevator, keep- ing an eye on the stairwell door
Stepping to one side, he hits the button
The elevator door slides open
He reaches in, presses a button and as the doors slide shut, Deckard slips a pen between the doors, jamming the operation
Deckard's shoes and soundless as he quickly crosses the lobby floor
He pauses a moment in front of the stair- well door, then pushes it open and: , '  -            97 Steps into the dark on the other side
Suddenly he spins, dropping to the floor, and  three times in- to the figure hovering to his left
The man is hanging off the floor, his arms locked into the railing, neck broken -- with three holes in his chest
but he was already dead
Deckard stares at the corpse
It's Mr
Deetchum, the old watchman
That   are rats who were feeding on him, scampering for safer places, Deckard gets to his feet
The stairway rectangles ten stories up
As his foot touches the first step, a raw, terrified  shatters the air
It came from below
It's the cry of a young girl -- it Deckard ejects the half-used cartridge from his laser, inserts a fresh one and quiet as the silence, descends the basement stairs
-                                    98 At the bottom he faces a corridor
The comes from the double doors at the far end
The     by the time he gets there
Each door is fitted with a small window
Deckard steps to the side and peers through
-                                         99 It's a gym
The mirror-lined walls are cracked and tarnished, the equipment atrophied from lack of use
The heavier barbells have sunk into the floor
Two weight-reducing machines are flapping and grinding away like idiots
Deckard's eyes stop on the woman
She dangles a few feet off the floor, hung by the shoulders through rings suspended from the ceiling
Her head is slung forward, her body limp and slightly swaying
Deckard pushes open one of the doors until it touches the wall
Slowly, he advances toward the hanging figure, keeping an eye on the mirror to cover surprises from the door
He's not breathing hard
His heart isn't pound- ing
Deckard's in his element
Close enough to look up into her face, he stops
It isn't grisly death that causes the reaction in his eyes
It's the innocence of her angel face
It's not something he has time to consider
In the mirror behind him, he sees the door starting to open
Deckard spins
He shouldn't have
Pris' legs snap up, crack the laser out of his hand and clamp around his neck
Slowly, the door swings closed, but Deckard doesn't notice
His carotid artery is no longer sending blood to the brain
He jerks up his foot and reaches down
As his fingers close around the ankle laser, Pris' fingers close around his wrist
Deckard's hand opens like a flower
The laser drops to the floor as his eyes roll back into his head
Naughty, naughty
She lets go, but before he can fall, she rams a foot into his back
He's propelled fifteen feet across the room, slams into a machine and falls to the floor
Pris flies off the rings and comes at him
Deckard reaches out to pull himself up, but she's al- ready there
Not too hard and just in the right place, she kicks him in the stomach
He goes back to the floor, gagging for air
Oh-so-precisely she reaches out with a long index finger and flips the switch on the machine
It's a flab eliminator with a vibrator belt
Normally an innocuous piece of equipment, but the motor housing on this one is missing
Lots of bad place for flesh and bone
But that's where Deckard's hand is going
An eight- year-old against a full-down man
In two more seconds his hand will be ground round
Deckard tries to pull his hand loose
It won't come
He yanks hard, but it's welded in hers
His face is twisted and strained as he raises a leg, wedges his foot against her chest and pushes with all his might
The hold breaks
They topple back
Deckard hits the floor gulping to catch his breath
Pris is up and coming for him again
She hovers over him
Deckard rolls out of the way as she comes down like a pile driver
Reflexively Deckard raises his arm to protect himself
Pris just smiles, takes hold of his foot and drags him across the floor
She doesn't like to leave a piece of work unfinished
They're going back to the machine
He goes by a weight-stand of dumbbells and grabs hold
It doesn't stop him
He's sliding over the floor like it was ice, weight stand in tow
Pris gets to the machine, yanks his foot up and forces it toward the opening
Deckard sits up, a five-pound dumbbell in his hand, and clobbers her in the back
It knocks her off balance, but she doesn't let go of his foot
She hooks out with a fist but misses
He gets her with a roundhouse in the face
She goes to the floor and Deckard's up, the dumbbell over his head, coming down with it
Fighting for her life now, Pris drives a foot into his chest
It lifts him off the floor
He flies back across the gym and lands in a heap
No more games
Pris is furious and moving fast
She rips a steel bar out of the wall and, holding it over- head, charges him like a samurai
As she comes down for the kill, she freezes
Deckard landed near the laser
He crawls towards it
As in a nightmare, it takes forever
But he gets there
He reaches out and grabs the laser, rolls over and takes careful aim
She charges towards him, screaming her rage
He  as she comes
The shot amputates her left arm at the shoulder, but her hand doesn't let go of the bar
It dangles crazily in front of her as she charges forward
He     through her neck
Pris hiccups a rope of blood as she flies through the air and crashes next to Deckard
Dead
He lies next to her, chest heaving
Slowly he rolls over and gets to his hands and knees
Panting, he stag- gers to his feet and stands over her, swaying slightly
The sound that escapes his throat is raspy and dry
It might not sound like a war cry, but it is
-                                    100 Laser in hand, Deckard kicks open the swinging doors and walks into the corridor, a dangerous man
-                                   101 Deckard arrives at the main floor landing, checks his loads and continues up the stairs
He's going to shoot the next thing that moves and find out later if he was right or wrong
-   -                    101A On the next landing he throws the door open
His eyes move down the hall, looking for prints in the dust
None
He continues up the stairs
-                                 102 On the ninth floor he finds what he's looking for
Footprints coming and going from a door halfway down the hall
He stops to the side of it and listens
Silence
Deckard  three quick shots through the door
If somebody were on the other side of it, they aren't now
He kicks the door open and dives through head first and hits the floor in a roll,   into the far corners of the room but the room is empty
There's a kitchen bar, a closet and a bedroom door, both closed
Deckard's breathing is the only sound
No response from either door
Maybe it was a sound, maybe intuition, but suddenly Deckard twists around and  several shots into the closet
The smouldering door slowly creaks open
Mary is huddled in the rear of the closet
Her hand out like somebody about to catch a ball but afraid of it
In her other hand she clutches a button-eyed monkey
Her face is bewildered, frozen in fear, her body riddled with holes
No recognition gap here
Deckard  her through the neck to make sure
Mary falls to the floor, like a puppet with her strings cut
Deckard backs away from the pathetic figure in the closet and sits on the sofa, unable to take his eyes off her
Deckard lays the laser down next to him, holds out his hand and looks at it
It's steady
He drops it in his lap, closes his eyes and leans back
from the ceiling
Deckard looks up
-- with the proverbial   at the end
pause
Deckard jumps out of the way as the ceiling gives in
Chucks on concrete and plaster hit the couch where he was sitting
The hole is a couple feet in diameter -- beams cracked through, exposing the apartment above
Silence
Deckard wipes the plaster dust from his eyes and mouth, then whispers: Hello, Roy
-     -           103 Deckard comes out onto the landing
Taking his time, he climbs the steps to the next floor, the last floor
He  the hinges out of the big stairwell door, pushes it with his foot and it comes down with a
The  turn into silence
The corridor is empty
-   -                      104 Moving fast but cautious, he passes each door until he gest to the apartment above Sebastian's
Slowly he turns the know and pushed open the door
-   -                     105 Except for the hole in the middle of the floor, there's nothing to see
Back against the wall, he moves to- wards the bedroom, but stops at the
It sounds like the     and it's coming from the hallway
-   -                      106 Deckard looks around the corner of the door down the hall
Batty's at the other end
Except for jockstrap and gym shoes, he's nude
You wanna play
Deckard
Batty's fast
He ducks into a doorway
Pops out again
Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent
thought you were supposed to be good
Aren't you the man
The makeup on Batty's face is somewhere between a Coman- che warrior and a transvestite
The immensity of his insolence awesome -- the muscles of his body are swol- len, trembling from the thrill of it
This is how we do it up there, lad
Come on
In a blue of lightning-like action, Batty whips down the hall, zigzagging off the walls towards Deckard so fast that Deckard gets only three  off before the blur crashes through the wall on his left with a laugh
Deckard stands there a moment -- digesting the impact of it, then edges up to the gaping wall
Batty is be- hind him
He knees Deckard in the back and slaps him in the head
Deckard goes to his knees, then over on his face
Batty kneels next to him
Not hurt, are you
You better get it up or 'm going to have to kill you
Unless you're alive you can't play
And if you don't play, you don't get to be alive
Deckard's eyes are closed, mouth bleeding
He exhales and makes and effort
He slides his hands up even with his chest and starts to push
That's the spirit
Like a matador, Batty walks away
By the time Deckard's on his feet, Batty's disappeared through one of the doors
Deckard wipes the blood from his mouth, bends down and picks up his laser, reloads and looks down the hall, towards the jeering voice
' Come on, Deckard, show me what you got
'm right here on the other side of the door
But you gotta shoot straight 'cause 'm fast
Deckard gets to the door,  it, kicks it open and at Batty
But it's only the reflection of Batty
-   -                          107 The full length mirror on the other side of the room Batty's next to him, grabs Deckard's hand and steps in closer
Straight doesn't seem to be good enough
They're face to face
You don't have a chance, do you
In an exaggeration of weary disappointment, Batty drops his head to the side
Looks like 'm gonna have to scale it down for you
Give you a handicap
won't run through any more walls
Okay
promise to use the doors
Okay
Deckard stares back at him, but doesn't respond
Sud- denly fury storms through Batty
He throws Deckard out the door, knocking him down, grabs him by the collar and rams his head into the wall
Come on, let's use that brain
-                        108 He drags him down the hall, on his knees and bangs his head into the wall again
Think
We need a little resilience around here
He yanks him further and bashes his head again
Where are those balls of yours
Let's see a little bravery
The storm passes
Deckard hangs in Batty's hand like a bag of laundry
That was irrational of me -- not to mention unsportsmanlike
Won't happen again
He drops him
'll be down the hall when you're ready
Betty walks off and disappears through one of the doors
Deckard gets to his knees, leans against the wall a mo- ment, then punches it with his fist
On his feet he's a little wobbly
Holding his breath so he can hear above his own breathing, he listens
No sound
No sign of Batty
The laser is laying nearby
He doesn't bother
Deckard is backing down the hall, quiet as he can
He had a job to do
He would like to have done it, but he's not insane
He gets to the landing and turns
On the first step down, he stops
Batty's on the land- ing below, looking up at him
Where you going
He wait a moment for Deckard's answer
No cheating
promise is a promise
'll honor the handicapped, but we gotta play on the top floor
You go get your laser gun now
And 'll give you a few seconds before  come
Deckard turns back into the hall
Batty smiles
Deckard's running down the corridor
' One
Halfway down the hall he finds his laser
' Two
Deckard darts into the nearest door
The apartment above Sebastian's, with the hole in the floor
Deckard considers it
' No fair jumping through holes
You might get hurt doing that
Deckard dashes back into the hall, chooses another door and goes in
-                       109 His eyes skim over everything, looking for an advantage
He throws open a door
The bathroom
The plumbing is dismantled, walls stripped, revealing brick, nails protruding
Too small
-                       110 Batty's coming up the steps
Five
-                       111 Deckard's looking for a corner -- a place that covers the angles
He chooses the far side of the room with a line to the door
-                            112 Batty's coming down the center, listening at the doors
Six
-                       113 Deckard's crouched in the corner and aimed
He looks at his hand
It's trembling
' Seven
-                            114 Batty's standing in front of a door, listening
Oh,  wonder where he is
Not in here,  don't think
Eight
He goes to the next door
Maybe here
Doesn't sound like it
Nine
Batty moves to the next
The door to Deckard
-                       115 Deckard's crouched lower, holding his breath -- talk about a hair trigger
Silence
Batty's  are heard Deckard looks around
Runs a hand over the wall behind him
Batty's
pause
Ten
The door explodes
shape hurtles across the room
Deckard pivots, fol- lowing it with
It's a
He spins back
but Batty's already on him
He gets one  off be- fore Batty's got his hand
There's a hole over Batty's right eye
Blood running down his face, dripping on Deckard
The right side of his face isn't working too good
The corner of his mouth doesn't quite shut -- his voice comes out slurred, a little hollow
One point for you
The would doesn't minimize his omnipotence, just makes it more malignant
He throws Deckard against the far wall
Deckard
Hits Batty in the shoulder
Ho ho
Try it again
He comes at Deckard, jerking back and forth, a cobra in fast motion, faking, weaving, yelping with excitement as Deckard tries to get a shot,   until his laser's empty
Bloody and crazed, Batty pushes up against him
What's wrong
Don't you like me
'm what we've made
-                            116 He's backing Deckard out the door
Deckard trips and falls
There's fear on his face
The strength is gone
Something is starting to crack
What's wrong
Aren't you a lover of Faster, Bigger and Better
Deckard's pedaling backwards over the floor
It's time to die
Deckard throws the laser at him
It misses
Batty throws his head back and laughs
one-eyed colossus about to eat the world
Suddenly he stops
His eye moves over the wall
Ah
He reaches out and pinches something
His lips compress as he yanks it out of the wall
It's a ten-penny nail
He holds it out to Deckard and drops it
Deckard catches it
That's for you
One side of Batty's face smiles savagely
Stick it in your ear and push
If that doesn't work, try the eye
Deckard stares at the nail in his hand, then up at his executioner
Believe me, it'll be better for you than what 'm about to do
Batty watches him, hoping the stimulus might inspire his victim to more action
It doesn't look like it
Well
Deckard springs to his feet and bolts
But instead of going for the stairwell he turns in the first available door
#2 -                    117 Provocation accomplished
Batty smiles and walks lei- surely towards the door
Deckard's terrified scream and the  of   stop him
Batty speeds up and moves into the room
The window pane is splattered, curtains sucked out, bellowing in the wind
Crap
He walks up to the window
Deckard comes away from the wall, inching up behind him, laser in both hands, aimed at the base of Batty's skull
Batty starts to lean over, but even before his eyes see the pavement, he knows
He spins
Deckard  again
This one goes home
Batty falls like he was poleaxed, hits the floor dead weight
Deckard starts to tremble
His arms go limp as his head tilts back and he closes his eyes
He can breathe again
On the floor, Batty's hand is crawling toward Deckard's ankle
With the unsuspected abruptness of a man slipping on a banana peel, Deckard comes down
Face knotted in hor- ror, he    in Batty's body -- but the hand holds on
With a screech of frustration he drops the laser and like an animal claws at Batty's dead fingers -- but the fingers are welded shut
Deckard starts to crawl, pulling Batty behind him
He struggled through the door and stumbles to his feet
-                            118 Deckard plunges down the corridor dragging Batty along
He falls, gets to one foot, falls again and crawls the last couple feet to the stairwell
-                       119 Groaning, he tugs and pulls, hauls and heaves Batty's body to the edge of the landing
He pauses for breath, then lays back, wedging his feet against Batty's shoul- ders and pushes
Inch by inch the body goes over the edge
Then all at once it drops
But the hand holds and the weight of the body takes Deckard with it
As Deckard slides over the edge, he grabs hold of the railing
Deckard's hanging three hundred feet over the basement floor, supporting himself and Batty's corpse -- almost four hundred pounds of stress on his fingers
With his free foot he chops away at Batty's hand, try- ing to break it loose
But it's not working
Deckard's fingers are starting to slip
His face is a mask of agony as he wedges his heel over Batty's thumb
With the help of gravity and everything he's got in his right leg to push with, he pushes
The thumb breaks loose
Batty falls
The       sounds good, but Deckard doesn't notice
He's in an awkward position
He must reverse the way he's facing to pull himself up
He lets go with his right hand and crosses it over the left
Then turns the left around so he's got an over- hand grip
Like a man doing his last pull-up
the one that can't be done, Deckard pulls himself up, throws a foot over the edge and grapples and heaves and wiggled himself onto the cold solid steel of the stairwell landing
And lies there, body jerking spasmodically, slowly clenching and unclenching his cramped hand, but it's his burning cheek against the cool metal he's most aware of
Dizzy, hot, lungs on fire, he stands -- and putting one foot in front of the other, Deckard descends the stairs
'  -                         120 Slowly the door pushes open and Deckard comes out into the morning
The sun isn't yet risen, but the sky has begun to pale
It's a brooding gray stew of a dawn not very pretty, but even though he can't show it, Deckard is glad to see it
For a moment he tilts his head back and takes some breath, then walks across the courtyard towards the street, so dead on his feet he hasn't the energy to fall
Deckard slumps into the shelter of his car
The col- lapses on the front seat
'  -                            121 In a corner of the dimness Deckard sits slumped on a chair, facing the pearly gray light of the window
The only  in the room is the soft steady that comes from the bed
Quietly he gets up and walks over to her
Rachael lies sleeping, one delicate arm exposed from under the sheet
Deckard stands there, bettered and grim, staring down at her
Moments go by and finally he sits gently on the edge of the bed
Rachael opens her eyes, and looks up at him, she smiles
() -                         122 Deckard's car is skimming over the narrow highway
He and Rachael in the front seat
Except for the occasion- al glance, their faces are still and quiet in the cold shine of an icy dream
The clouds overhead are soft and swift
(
) She wanted to go to a place  knew
Out of the city
Like one of those pictures she saw
Where there were trees but no buildings
Rachael's face in the window watching the woods stream by
(
) We had a good time
She told me a funny story and  taught her a song
song about monkeys and elephants
And it made us laugh so hard we couldn't sing
() -                               123 Deckard and Rachael walking
The land lays white and hushed before them
Down an aisle of maples and beeches
The frosty light slanting through the clean, hard limbs
The crisp, blue-white snow underfoot melted through in spots exposing soggy patches of rich brown earth
Rachael stops and faces him
Her lips are parted, her warm breath turning the cold air to vapor
Looking lithe and fragile by these barren-rooted trees, she stands in the crisp white snow looking at Deckard
Nothing in her retreats, even now her eyes insist on knowing
-                                         124 Deckard walking over the snow
Alone
He walks slowly, mechanically through the cold, unaffected by it
His gaunt face, empty of expression except for the tears running down his pale cheeks
But for the  of his wet shoes over the crusted snow, there is no sound
And Deckard recedes into the silence of the freezing white landscape
-                                     125 Deckard's car, solid, ,  along like some metal animal
Headlights piercing the dark of the long, flat road
speed of air and tires spin- ning
And then silence
And the silence astounded by the
-                                         126 Deckard is behind the wheel, face in shadow, eyes star- ing straight ahead
(
) told myself over and over again, if  hadn't done it, they would have
didn't go back to the city, not that city,  didn't want the job
She said the great advantage of being alive was to have a choice
And she chose
And a part of me was almost glad
Not because she was gone but because this way they could never touch her
As for Tyrell -- he was murdered, but he wasn't dead
For a long time  wanted to kill him
But what was the point
There were too many Tyrells
But only one Rachael
Maybe real and unreal could never be separated
The secret never found
But  got as close with her as 'd ever come to it
She'd stay with me a long time
guess we made each other real
And the ruby lights of Deckard's car disappear into the darkness
