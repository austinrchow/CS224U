0in } True Romance by Quentin Tarantino When you are tired of relationships, try a romance
- smoky cocktail bar downtown Detroit
, a young hipster hepcat, is trying to pick up an older lady named
She isn't bothered by him, in fact, she's alittle charmed
But, you can tell, that she isn't going to leave her barstool
In "Jailhouse Rock" he's everything rockabilly's about
mean he is rockabilly: mean, surly, nasty, rude
In that movie he couldn't give a fuck about anything except rockin' and rollin', livin' fast, dyin' young, and leaving a good-looking corpse
love that scene where after he's made it big he's throwing a big cocktail party, and all these highbrows are there, and he's singing, "Baby You're So Square
Baby,  Don't Care"
Now, they got him dressed like a dick
He's wearing these stupid-lookin' pants, this horrible sweater
Elvis ain't no sweater boy
even think they got him wearin' penny loafers
Despite all that shit, all the highbrows at the party, big house, the stupid clothes, he's still a rude-lookin' motherfucker
'd watch that hillbilly and 'd want to be him so bad
Elvis looked good
'm no fag, but Elvis was good-lookin'
He was fuckin' prettier than most women
always said if  ever had to fuck a guy mean had too 'cause my life depended on it
'd fuck Elvis
Lucy takes a drag from her cigarette
'd fuck Elvis
Really
When he was alive
wouldn't fuck him now
don't blame you
(they laugh) So we'd both fuck Elvis
It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it
Lucy laughs
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you
How 'bout me what
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight
What are we gonna see
Donny Chiba triple feature
"The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter"
Who's Sonny Chiba
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever
(not believing this) You wanna take me to a kung fu movie
(holding up three fingers) Three kung fu movies
Lucy takes a drag from her cigarette
(laughing) don't think so, not my cup of tea
- The sounds of the city flow in through an open window: car horns, gun shots and violence
Paint is peeling off the walls and the once green carpet is stained black
On the bed nearby is a huge open suitcase filled with clear plastic bags of cocaine
Shotguns and pistols have been dropped carelessly around the suitcase
On the far end of the room, against the wall, is a
"Bewitched" is playing
At the opposite end of the room, by the front, is a table
and   sit around
Cocaine is on the table as well as little plastic bags and a weigher
Floyd is black, Drexl is a white boy, though you wouldn't know it listen to him
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit
Naw man,  don't be eatin' that shit
That's bullshit
, a stout, mean-looking black man who's older than Drexl and Floyd
Walks through the door carrying hamburgers and french fries in two greasy brown-paper bags
Naw man, that's some serious shit
Nigger, you lie like a big dog
What the fuck are you talkin' about
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off
heard that
Hold on a second, Big
You sayin' you eat pussy
Nigger,  eat everything
eat pussy
eat the butt
eat every motherfuckin' thang
Preach on, Big
Look here
If  ever did eat some pussy -  would never eat any pussy - but, if  did eat some pussy,  sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body
'd be ashamed as a motherfucker
Shit
Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things
So you won't eat pussy
Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers' dicks
Heard that
Drexl and Big  bump fists
Yeah, that's right, laugh
It's so funny, oh it's so funny
(he takes a hit off of a joint) There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked
Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys
And white boys are freaks for that shit - - Because it's good
Then, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat
And because you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up for every nigger in the world everywhere
Drexl
On behalf of me and all the brothers who aren't here, 'd like to express our gratitude - Drexl and Big  bust up
Go on pussy-eaters
laugh
You look like you be eatin' pussy
You got pussy-eatin' mugs
Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit
So you do eat pussy
Naw naw
You don't like it, but you eat that shit
(to Drexl) He eats it
Damn skippy
He like it, too
(mock English accent) Me thinketh he doth protest too much
Well fuck you guys then
You guys are fucked up
Why you trippin'
We jus' fuckin' with ya
But  wanna ask you a question
You with some fine bitch,  mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy
You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick
" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger,  ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush
" Now, what do you say
tell Jayne Kennedy, "Suck my dick or 'll beat your ass
" Nigger, get real
You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast - Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit
Now what would you do
'd say fuck it
Drexl and Big  get up from the table disgusted and walk away, leaving Floyd sitting all alone
Big  sits on the bed, his back turned to Floyd, watching "Bewitched"
(yelling after them) Ain't no man have to eat pussy
(not even looking) Take that shit somewhere else
(marching back) You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy
With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger, you'd aim to please
(glued on ) 'm hip
In fact, 'm gonna show you what  mean with a little demonstration
Big , toss me that shotgun
Without turning away from "Bewitched" he picks up the shotgun and tosses it to Drexl
(to Floyd) All right, check this out
(referring to shotgun) Now, pretend this is Jayne Kennedy
And you're you
Then, in a blink, he points the shotgun at Floyd and blows him away
Big  leaps off the bed and spins toward Drexl
Drexl, waiting for him, fires from across the room
The blast hits the big man in the right arm and shoulder, spinning him around
Drexl makes a beeline for his victim and fires again
Big  is hit with a blast, full in the back
He slams into the wall and drops
Drexl collects the suitcase full of cocaine and leaves
As he gets to the front door he surveys the carnage, spits and walks out
'   - big white Chevy Nova is driving down the road with a sunrise sky as a backdrop
The song "Little Bitty Tear" is heard a capella
'   - Cliff  Worley is driving his car home from work, singing this song gently to the sunrise
He's a forty-five-years-old ex-cop, at present a security guard
In between singing he takes sips from a cup of take-out coffee
He's dressed in a security guard uniform
- Cliff's Nova pulls in as he continues crooning
He pulls up to his trailer to see something that stops him short
Cliff's  Through windshield Clarence and a nice-looking   are watching for him in front of his trailer
- Upon seeing Clarence, a little bitty tear rolls down Cliff's cheek
: ' Clarence and the Young Woman walk over to the car
Clarence sticks his face through the driver's side window
Good Morning, Daddy
Long time no see
- All three enter the trailer home
Excuse the place,  haven't been entertaining company as of late
Sorry if 'm acting a little dense, but you're the last person in the world expected to see this morning
Clarence and the Young Girl walk into the living room
Yeah, well, tha's , Daddy,  tend to have that effect on people
'm dyin' on thirst, you got anything to drink
He moves past Cliff and heads straight for his refridgerator
think there's a Seven-Up in there
(rumaging around the fridge) Anything stronger
(pause) Oh, probably not
Beer
You can drink beer, can't you
can, but  don't
(closing the fridge) That's about all  ever eat
Cliff looks at the Girl
She smiles sweetly at him
(to Girl) 'm sorry
'm his father
(sticking her hand out) That's , 'm his wife
(shaking his hand vigorously) Alabama Worley, pleased to meetcha
She is really pumping his arm, just like a used-car salesman
However, that's where the similarities end; Alabama's totally sincere
Clarence steps back into the living room, holding a bunch of little ceramic fruit magnets in his hand
He throws his other arm around Alabama
Oh yeah, we got married
(referring to the magnets) You still have these
(to Alabama) This isn't a complete set; when  was five  swallowed the pomegranate one
never shit it out, so  guess it's still there
Loverdoll, why don't you be a sport and go get us some beer
want some beer
(to Cliff) Do you want some beer
Well, if you want some it's here
He hands her some money and his car keys
Go to the liquor store - (to Cliff) Where is there a liquor store around here
Uh, yeah
there's a party store down 54th
(to Alabama) Get a six-pack of something imported
It's hard to tell you what to get 'cause different places have different things
If they got Fosters, get that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has
Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well
'm fuckin' starvin' to death
Are you hungry too
'm pretty hungry
When  went to the store  was gonna get some Ding-Dongs
Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food
What would taste good
(to Cliff) What do you think would taste good
'm really not very - You know what would taste good
Chicken
haven't had chicken in a while
Chicken would really hit the spot about now
Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt
(to Cliff) Where's a good chicken place around here
really don't know
You don't know the chicken places around where you live
(to Alabama) Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is
He gives her some more money
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy
She opens the door and starts out
Clarence turns to his dad as the door shuts
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life
Is she a four alarm fire, or what
She seems very nice
Daddy
Nice isn't the word
Nice is an insult
She's a peach
That's the only word for it, she's a peach
She even tastes like a peach
You can tell 'm in love with her
You can tell by my face, can't ya
It's a dead giveaway
It's written all over it
Ya know what
She loves me back
Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk - Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache
can't believe how much like your mother you are
You're your fuckin' mother through and through
haven't heard from ya in three years
Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning
You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer
don't get me wrong, 'm happy to see you
just slow it down
Now, when did you get married
Daddy, 'm in big fuckin' trouble and  really need your help
: "" '  - are sitting on a couch with sheets of paper in their hands silently mouthing lines
One of the actors is
The casting director,   , steps into the waiting room, clip board in hand
Dick Ritchie
Dick pops up from the pack
'm me
mean, that's me
Step inside
'  - She sits behind a large desk
Her name-plate rests on the desktop
Several posters advertising "The Return of
Hooker" hang on the wall
Dick sits in a chair, holding his sheets in his hands
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys
There's Brian and Marty
Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian
And you're reading for the part of Marty
Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood
And what you're trying to do is get him off
(she picks a up a copy of the script) Whenever you're ready
(reading and miming driving) Where'd you come from
(reading from the script lifelessly) don't know
He just appeared as magic
(reading from script) Well, don't just sit there, shoot him
She puts her script down, and smiles at him
That was very good
Thank you
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that
Sure
No problem
Could we try it now
Absolutely
Dick picks up the script and begins, but this time with a Brooklyn accent
Where'd he come from
(monotone, as before) don't know
He just appeared as magic
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him
Ravencroft puts her script down
Well, Mr
Ritchie, 'm impressed
You're a very fine actor
Dick smiles
- Cliff's completely aghast
He just stares, unable to come to grips with what Clarence has told him
Look,  don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free
You're always making jokes
That's what you do, isn't it
Make jokes
Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it
But if you make a joke about this - (raising his voice) - 'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head
Cliff pauses and collects himself
What do you want from me
What
Stop acting like an infant
You're here because you want me to help you in some way
What do you need from me
You need money
Do you still have friends on the force
Yes,  still have friends on the force
Could you find out if they know anythin'
don't know they know shit about us
But  don't wanna think,  wanna know
You could find out for sure what's goin' on
(pause) Daddy
What makes you think  could do that
You were a cop
What makes you think  would do that
'm your son
You got it all worked out, don't you
Look, goddamnit,  never asked you for a goddamn thing
've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible
After Mom divorced you, did ask you for anything
When  wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it
No, it was always "", "No problem", "You're a busy guy,  understand"
The whole time you were a drunk, did  ever point my finger at you and talk shit
No
Everybody else did
never did
You see,  know that you're just a bad parent
You're not really very good at it
But  know you love me
'm basically a pretty resourceful guy
If  didn't really need it  wouldn't ask
And if you say no, don't worry about it
'm gone
No problems
Alabama walks in through the door carrying a shopping bag
The forager's back
Thank God
could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it
didn't get any chicken
How come
It's nine o'clock in the morning
Nothing's open
-  - Cliff's on the telephone in his bedroom, pacing as he talks
The living room od the trailer can be seen from his doorway, where Clarence and Alabama are horsing around
They giggle and cut up throughout the scene
As Cliff talks, all the noise and hubbub of a police station comes through over the line
He's talking to  , an old friend of his from the force
We see both inside the conversation
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey
What about him
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth,  found out through the grapevine that it might be, and  only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale
Are you still working security for Foster & Langley
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route
And you know,  stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins
Now, while have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it
McTeague
don't know him
Is he a nice guy
You think he'll help me out
don't see why not
When you gonna come round and see my new place
You and Robin moved
Shit, are you behind
Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago
Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed
Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place
'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla
: - Clarence and Cliff stand by Clarence's 1965 red Mustang
Alabama's amusing herself by doing cartwheels and handstands in the background
They have nothing
In fact, they think it's drug related
Do tell
Why drug related
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that
No shit
Yeah
Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle
Name mean anything to you
Nope
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should
Who is he
Gangster
Drug Dealer
Somebody you don't want on your ass
Look, Clarence, the more  hear about this Drexl fucker, the more  think you did the right thing
That guy wasn't just some wild flake
That's what 've been tellin' ya
The guy was like a mad dog
So the cops aren't looking for me
Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out
So, once you leave twon,  wouldn't worry about it
Clarence sticks his hand out to shake
Cliff takes it
Thanks a lot, Daddy
You really came through for me
got some money  can give you - Keep it
Well, son,  want you to know  hope everything works out with you and Alabama
like her
think you make a cute couple
We do make a cute couple, don't we
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble
Remeber, you got a wife to think about
Quit fuckin' around
(pause) love you son
They hug each other, Clarence takes a pice of paper out and puts it into Cliff's hand
This is Dick's number in Hollywood
We don't know where we'll be, but you can get a hold of me through him
Clarence turns toward Alabama and yells to her
Bama, we're outta here
Kiss Pops goodbye, Alabama runs across from where she was and throws her arms around Cliff and gives him a big smackeroo on the lips
Cliff's a little startled
Alabama's bubbling like a Fresca
Bye, Daddy
Hope to see you again real soon
(mock anger) What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that
Oh, hush up
The two get into the Mustang
(to Cliff) We'll send you a postcard as soon as we get to Hollywood
Clarence starts the engine
The convertible roof opens as they talk
Bama, you take care of that one for me
Keep him out of trouble
Don't worry, Daddy, 'm keepin' this fella on a short leash
Clarence, slowly, starts driving away
(to Cliff) As the sun sets slowly in the west we bid a fond farewell to all the friends we've made
and, with a touch of melancholy, we look forward to the time when we will all be together again
Clarence peels out, shooting a shower of gravel up in the air
As the Mustang disappears Cliff runs his tongue over his lips
The-son-of-a-bitch was right
she does taste like a peach
'  - Dick's apartment is standard issue for a young actor
Things are pretty neat and clean
nice stereo unit sits on the shelf
framed picture of a ballet dancer's feet hangs on the wall
The phone rings, Dick answers
Hi, Dick here
-   - Top floor, Las Vegas, Nevada hotel room with a huge picture window overlooking the neon-filled strip and the flaming red and orange sunset sky
Clarence paces up and down with the telephone in his hand
(big bopper voice) Heeeellllloooo baaaabbbbbyyyy
Note: We intercut both sides of the conversation
(unsure) Clarence
You got it
It's great to hear from you
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly
You comin' to
When
Tomorrow
What's up
Why're leavin' Detroit
Clarence sits down on the hotel room bed
Alabama, wearing only a long -shirt with a big picture of Bullwinkle on it, crawls behind him
Well, there's a story behind all that
'll tell you when  see you
By the way,  won't be alone
'm bringing my wife with me
Get the fuck outta here
'm a married man
Get the fuck outta here
Believe it or not,  actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me
'm not quite sure how  did it
'd hate to have to do it again
But  did it
Wanna say hi to my better half
Before Dick can respond Clarence puts Alabama on the phone
Hi, Dick
'm Alabama Worley
Hello, Alabama
can't wait to meet you
Clarence told me all about you
He said you were his best friend
So,  guess that makes you my best friend, too
Clarence start dictating to her what to say
Tell him we gotta go
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it
What
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow
He said don't go nowhere
We'll be there some time tomorrow
Wait a minute - Tell him not to eat anything
We're gonna scarf when we get there
Don't eat anything
Alabama, could you tell Clar - Ask him if he got the letter
Did you get the letter
What letter
(to Clarence) What letter
The letter  sent
(to Dick) The letter he sent
Clarence sent a letter
Has he gotten his mail today
Gotten your mail yet
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the
(to Clarence) Yes
Has he looked through it yet
(to Dick) Ya looked through it
Not yet
(to Clarence) Nope
Tell him to look through it
(to Dick) Get it
Let me speak to Clarence
(to Clarence) He wants to speak with you
No time
Gotta go
Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all
Tell him  love him
And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over
(to Dick) He can't
We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter
The letter explains it all
He wants you to know he loves you
And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over
Money problems
Now tell him goodbye
Bye-bye
Now hang up
She hangs up the phone
'  - Dick hears the click on the other end
Hello, hello, Clarence
Clarence's wife
mean Alabama
hello
Extremely confused, Dick jangs up the phone
He goes over to the  and picks up the day's mail
He goes through it
: Southern California Gas Company
: Group
: Fossenkemp Photography
: Columbia Record and Tape Club
: It's obviously from Clarence
Addressed to Dick
Dick opens it
- lower-middle-class trailer park named Astro World, which has a neon sign in front of it in the shape of a planet
big, white Chevy Nova pulls into the park
It parks by a trailer that's slightly less kept up than the others
Cliff gets out of the Chevy
He's drinking out of a fast-food soda cup as he opens the door to his trailer
- He steps inside the doorway and then, before he knows it, a gun is pressed to his temple and a big hand grabs his shoulder
() Welcome home, alchy
We're havin' a party
Cliff is roughly shoved into his living room
Waiting for him are four men, standing: ,  (young Wise-guy)  (an old Wise-guy), and Tooth-pick Vic (a fireplug pitbull type)
Sitting in Cliff's recliner is  , the Frank Nitti to Detroid mob leader Blue Lou Boyle
Cliff is knocked to his knees
He looks up and sees the sitting Coccotti
Dario and Lenny pick him up and roughly drop him in a chair
(to Frankie) Tell Tooth-pick Vic to go outside and do you-know-what
In Italian Frankie tells Tooth-pick Vic what Coccotti said
He nods and exits
Cliff's chair is moved closer to Coccotti's
Dario stands on one side of Cliff
Frankie and Lenny ransack the trailer
Virgil has a bottle of Chivas Regal in his hand, but he has yet to touch a drop
Do you know who  am, Mr
Worley
give up
Who are you
'm the Anti-Christ
You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you
My name is Vincenzo Coccotti
work as a counsel for Mr
Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from
hear you were once a cop so  assume you've heard od us before
Am  correct
've heard of Blue Lou Boyle
'm glad
Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit--am question you've been asking yourself
Now, we're gonna have a little  and , and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine
(taking out a pack of Chesterfields) Want a Chesterfield
No
(as he lights up) have a son of my own
About you boy's age
can imagine how painful this must be for you
But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves
And  implore you not to go down the road with 'em
You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice
Look, 'd help ya if  could, but  haven't seen Clarence - Before Cliff can finish his sentence, Coccotti slams him hard in the nose with his fist
Smarts, don't it
Gettin' slammed in the nose fucks you all up
You got that pain shootin' through your brain
Your eyes fill up with water
It ain't any kind of fun
But what  have to offer you
That's as good as it's ever gonna get, and it won't ever get that good again
We talked to your neighbors
They saw a Mustang, a red Mustang, Clarence's red Mustang, parked in front of your trailer yesterday
Mr
Worley, have you seen your son
Cliff's defeated
've seen him
Now  can't be sure of how much of what he told you
So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light
That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and  don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity
Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead
What are you talkin' about
'm talkin' about a massacre
They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there
Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand
whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks
don't believe you
That's of minor importance
But what's of major fuckin' importance is that believe you
Where did they go
On their honeymoon
'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time
Where did they go
They didn't tell me
Coccotti looks at him
Now, wait a minute and listen
haven't seen Clarence in three years
Yesterday he shows up here with a girl, sayin' he got married
He told me he needed some quick cash for a honeymoon, so he asked if he could borrow five hundred dollars
wanted to help him out so  wrote out a check
We went to breakfast and that's the last  saw of him
So help me God
They never thought to tell me where they were goin'
And  never thought to ask
Coccotti looks at him for a long moment
He then gives Virgil a look
Virgil, quick as greased lightning, grabs Cliff's hand and turns it palm up
He then whips out a butterfly knife and slices Cliff's palm open and pours Chivas Regal on the wound
Cliff screams
Coccotti puffs on a Chesterfield
Tooth-pic Vic returns to the trailer, and reports in Italian that there's nothing in the car
Virgil walks into the kitchen and gets a dishtowel
Cliff holds his bleeding palm in agony
Virgil hands him the dishtowel
Cliff uses it to wrap up his hand
Sicilians are great liars
The best in the world
'm a Sicilian
And my old man was the world heavyweight champion of Sicilian liars
And from growin' up with him  learned the pantomime
Now there are seventeen different things a guy can do when he lies to give him away
guy has seventeen pantomimes
woman's got twenty, but a guy's got seventeen
And if you know 'em like ya know your own face, they beat lie detectors to hell
What we got here is a little game of show and tell
You don't wanna show me nothin'
But you're tellin' me everything
Now  know you know where they are
So tell me, before  do some damage you won't walk away from
The awful pain in Cliff's hand is being replaced by the awful pain in his heart
He looks deep into Coccotti's eyes
Could  have one of those Chesterfields now
Sure
Coccotti leans over and hands him a smoke
Got a match
Cliff reaches into his pocket and pulls out a lighter
Oh, don't bother
got one
(he lights the cigarette) So you're a Sicilian, huh
(intensly) Uh-huh
You know  read a lot
Especially things that have to do with history find that shit fascinating
In fact,  don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians were spawned by niggers
All the men stop what they were doing and look at Cliff, except for Tooth-pic Vic who doesn't speak English and so isn't insulted
Coccotti can't believe what he's hearing
Come again
It's a fact
Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts
If you don't believe me, look it up
You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily
And Moors are niggers
Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy
Blond hair, blue eyes
But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country
They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin
find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene
'm just quotin' history
It's a fact
It's written
Your ancestors were niggers
Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid
That is a fact
Now tell me, am  lyin'
Coccotti looks at him for a moment then jumps up, whips out an automatic, grabs hold of Cliff's hair, puts the barrel to his temple, and pumps three bullets through Cliff's head
He pushes the body violently aside
Coccotti pauses
Unable to express his feelings and frustrated by the blood in his hands, he simply drops his weapon, and turns to his men
haven't killed anybody since 1974
Goddamn his soul to burn for eternity in fuckin' hell for makin' me spill blood on my hands
Go to this comedian's son's apartment and come back with somethin' that tells me where that asshole went so  can wipe this egg off of my face and fix this fucked-up family for good
Tooth-pick Vic taps Frankie's shoulder and, in Italianm asks him what that was all about
Lenny, who has been going through Cliff's refridgerator, has found a beer
When he closes the refridgerator door he finds a note held on by a ceramic banana magnet that says: "Clarence in
: Dick Ritchie (number and address)"
Boss, get ready to get happy
: "
" ' - Dick's asleep in a recliner
He's wearing his clothes from the night before
His room-mate  is lying on the sofa watching
The sound of our hands knocking on his door wakes Dick up
He shakes the bats out of his belfry, opens the door, and finds the cutest couple in Los Angeles standing in his doorway
Clarence and Alabama immediately start singing "Hello My Baby" like the frog in the old Chuck Jones cartoon
/ Hello my baby, Hello my honey, Hello my ragtime gal - Hi guys
Alabama throws her arms around Dick, and gives him a quick kiss
After she breaks, Clarence does the same
Clarence and Alabama walk right past Dick and into his apartment
Wow
Neat place
' -  - The Pink's employees work like skilled Benihana chefs as they assemble the ultimate masterpiece hot-dog
' -  -  - Clarence, Alabama, and Dick are sitting at an outdoor table chowing down on chili dogs
Alabama is in the middle of a story
when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked
He never had a kid before, and crashed the car
Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers
Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here
"
He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital
So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude
Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if 'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo
So they asked Waldo where he was from
And, so there you go
And here we are
That's a pretty amazing story
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl
What are women like out here
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier
You goin' out
Well, for the past couple of years 've been goin' out with girls from my acting class
Good for you
What's so fuckin' good about it
Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head bunch of women in the world
It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional instability before they can get their  card
Oh, guess what
had a really good reading for "
Hooker" the other day
You're gonna be on "
Hooker"
Knock wood
He knocks the table and then looks at it
formica
did real well
think she liked me
Did you meet Captain Kirk
You don't meet him in the audition
That comes later
Hope, hope
(finishing her hot-dog) That was so good  am gonna have another
You can't have just one
Alabama leaves to get another hot-dog
Clarence never takes his eyes off her
How much of that letter was on the up and up
Every word of it
Dick sees where Clarence's attention is
You're really in love, aren't you
For the very first time in my life
(pause) Do you know what that's like
Clarence is so intense Dick doesn't know how to answer
(regretfully) No,  don't (he looks at Alabama) How did you two meet
Clarence leans back thoughtfully and takes a sip from his Hebrew cream soda
Do you remember The Lyric
- Sonny Chiba, as "Streetfighter" Terry Surki, drives into a group of guys, fists and feet flying and whips ass on the silver screen
Clarence sits, legs over the back of the chair in front of him, nibbling on popcorn, eyes big as sourcers, and a big smile on his face
- cab pulls up to the outside of The Lyric
The marquee carries the names of the triple feature: "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter" and "Sister Streetfighter"
Alabama steps out of the taxi cab and walks up to the box office
box office girl reading comic looks at her
One please
Ninety-nine cents
Which one is on now
"Return of the Streetfighter"
It's been on about forty-five minutes
-  - Alabama walks into the lobby and goes over to the concession stand
young usher takes care of her
Can  have a medium popcorn
super-large Mr
Pibb, and a box of Goobers
- It's still assholes and elbows on the screen with Sonny Chiba taking on all-comers
Alabama walks through the doors with her bounty of food
She makes a quick scan of the theater
Not many people are there
She makes a beeline for the front whick happens to be Clarence's area of choice
She picks the row of seats just behind Clarence and starts asking her way down it
Clarence turns and sees this beautiful girl all alone moving towards him
He turns his attention back to the screen, trying not to be so obvious
When Alabama gets right behind Clarence, her foot thunks a discarded wine bottle, causing her to trip and spill her popcorn over Clarence
Oh, look what happened
Oh god, 'm so sorry
Are you
Yeah
'm fine
It didn't hurt
'm the clumsiest person in the world
(picking popcorn out of his hair) It's
Don't worry about it
Accidents happen
(picking popcorn out of his hair) What a wonderful philosophy
Thanks for being such a sweetheart
You could have been a real dick
Alabama sits back in her seat to watch the movie
Clarence tries to wipe her out of his mind, which isn't easy, and get back into the movie
They both watch the screen for a moment
Then, Alabama leans forward and taps Clarence on the shoulder
Excuse me
hate to bother you again
Would you mind too terribly filling me in on what  missed
Jumping on this opportunity
Not at all
, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba
The oriental
The oriental in black
He's an assasin
Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had
So he got himself arrested
They take him into the police station
And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses
Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill
Does a number on him
Kicks the cops' asses some more
Kicks the bars out of the window
And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him
Want some Goobers
Thanks a lot
thought Sonny was the good guy
He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker
Sonny don't be bullshittin'
He fucks dudes up for life
Hold on, a fight scene's coming up
They both watch, eyes wide, as Sonny Chiba kicks asses
: On the screen, Sonny Chiba's all jacked up
Dead bodies lie all around him
(in Japanese) flashes on the screen
The theater light go up
Alabama's now sitting in the next seat to Clarence
They're both applauding
Great movie
Action-packed
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass
Sonny kicks ass
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter"
It was the only movie up to that time rated  for violence
But we just saw the
If that was the , 'd love to see the
My name is Clarence, and what is yours
Alabama Whitman
Pleased to meet ya
Is that your real name
Really
That's my real name, really
got proof
See
She shows Clarence her driver's license
Well, cut my legs off and call me Shorty
That's a pretty original moniker there, Alabama
Sounds like a Pam Grier movie
(announcer voice) She's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'
She carried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her waist, and the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes
Alabama Whitman is Pam Grier
Pray for forgiveness, Rated
for Ruthless Revenge
- Clarence and Alabama are outside the theater
With the marquee lit up in the background they both perform unskilled martial arts moves
Clarence and Alabama break up laughing
Where's your car
'll walk you to it
took a cab
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies
Sure
Why not
Nothing
It's just you're a girl after my own heart
What time is it
'Bout twelve
suppose you gotta get up early, huh
No
Not particularly
(pause) How come
Well, it's just when  see a really good movie  really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it
It's sort of tradition
Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie
love to get pie after a movie
Would you like to get some pie
'd love some pie
'  - Clarence and Alabama are sitting in a booth at an all-night Denny's
It's about 12:40 a
m
Clarence is having a piece of chocolate cream pie and a coke
Alabama's nibbling on a peace of heated apple pie and sipping on a large Tab
Well, enough about the King
How about you
How 'bout me what
Tell me about yourself
There's nothing to tell
'mon
What're ya tryin' to be
The Phantom Lady
What do you want to know
Well, for starters, what do you do
Where're ya from
What's your favorite color
Who's your favorite movie star
What kinda music do you like
What are your turn-ons and turn-offs
Do you have a fella
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone
And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me
Alabama takes a bite of pie, puts down her fork, and looks at Clarence
Ask me them again
One by one
What do you do
don't remember
Where are you from
Might be from Tallahassee
But 'm not sure yet
What's your favorite color
don't remember
But off the top of my head, 'd say black
What's your favorite movie star
Burt Reynolds
Would you like a bite of my pie
Yes,  would
Clarence scoops up a piece on his fork and Alabama bites it off
Like it
Very much
Now, where were we
What kinda music do you like
Phil Spector
Girl group stuff
You know, like "He's a Rebel"
What are your turn-ons
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie
Turn-offs
'm sure there must be something, but  don't really remember
The only thing that comes to mind are Persians
Do you have a fella
She looks at Clarence and smiles
'm not sure yet
Ask me again later
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone
Apparently,  was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia
When  came to,  didn't know who  was, where  was, or where  came from
Luckily,  had my driver's license or  wouldn't even know my name
hoped it would tell me where  lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and  stopped somebody on the street and they told me  was in Detroit
So that was no help
But  did have some money on me, so  hopped in a cab until  saw somethin' that looked familiar
For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar
So  told him to stop and  got out
And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me
Because you looked like a nice guy, and  was a little scared
And  sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so  spilled my popcorn on you
Clarence looks at her closely
He picks up his soda and sucks on the straw until it makes that slurping sound
He puts it aside and stares into her soul
smile cracks on her face and develops into a big wide grin
Aren't you just dazzled by my imagination, lover boy
(eats her last piece of pie) Where to next
- It's about 1:30 a
m
Clarence has taken Alabama to where he works
It's a comic book store called Heroes For Sale
Alabama thinks this place is super-cool
Wow
What a swell place to work
Yeah,  got the key, so  come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music
How long have you worked here
Almost four years
That's a long time
'm hip
But you know, 'm comfortable here
It's easy work
know what 'm doing
Everybody who works here is my buddy
'm friendly with most of the customers
just hang around and talk about comic books all day
Do you get paid a lot
That's where trouble comes into paradise
But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it
Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like
You bet
How much is that worth
Clarence gets a box off the shelf
Four hundred bucks
didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books
Well, we sell other things too
Cool stuff
"Man from
" Lunch boxes
"Green Hornet" board games
Shit like that
But comic books are main business
There's a lot of collectors around here
She holds up a little  Joe sized action figure of a black policeman
What's that
That's a "Rookies" doll
George Sanford Brown
We gotta lotta dolls
They're real cool
Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"
always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine
He pulls a plastic-cased "Spiderman" comic form the box
"Spiderman", number one
The one that started it all
Clarence shows the comic book to Alabama
God, Spiderman looks different
He was just born, remember
This is the first one
You know that guy, Dr
Gene Scott
He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised
Well,  thought about that even before  heard him say it
Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time
He pulls out another comic
"Sgt
Fury and His Howling Commandos"
One of the coolest series known to man
They're completely worthless
You can get number one for about four bucks
But that's one of the cool things about them, they're so cheap
(he opens one up) Just look at that artwork, will ya
Great stories
Great Characters
Look at this one
We see the "Sgt
Fury" panels
Nick's gotten a ring from his sweetheart and he wears it around his neck on a chain
, later in the story he gets into a fight with a Nazi bastard on a ship
He knocks the guy overboard, but the Kraut grabs ahold of his chain and the ring goes overboard too
So, Nick dives into the ocean to get it
Isn't that cool
She's looking into Clarence's eyes
He turns and meets her gaze
Alabama, 'd like you to have this
Clarence hands her the "Sgt
Fury and His Howling Commandos" comic book that he loves so much
'  -  - Clarence's bedroom is a pop culture explosion
Movie posters, pictures of Elvis, anything you can imagine
The two walk through the door
What a cool room
She runs and does a jumping somersault into his bed
Later
Alabama's sitting Indian-style going through Clarence's photo album
Clarence is behind her planting little kisses on her neck and shoulders
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit
How old were you then
Five
She turns the page
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis
finally knew what  wanted when  grew up
- Clarence and Alabama slow dance in the middle of his room to Janis Joplin's "Piece of My Heart"
You know when you sat behind me
At the movies
Uh-huh,  was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then  thought, she doesn't want me bothering her
What would make you think that
dunno
guess 'm just stupid
You're not stupid
Just wrong
They move to the music
Alabama softly, quietly sings some of the words to the song
love Janis
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died
She 'd, didn't she
Yeah, she 'd
But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'
She didn't take too much
It shouldn't have killed her
There was somethin' wrong with what she took
You mean she got a bad batch
That's what happened
In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life
She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them
She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him
Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money
So, she said no
And the guy says, "Look,  really love you, and wanna prove it
So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens,  can never get any of your money, and 'll sign it
" So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes
And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire
So he really loved her
Uh-huh
They kiss
'  -  - It's the next day, around 1 p
m
Clarence wakes up in his bed, alone
He looks around, and no Alabama
Then he hears crying in the distance
He puts on a robe and investigates
'  -   - Alabama's wearing one of Clarence's old shirts
She's curled up in a chair crying
Clarence approaches her
She tries to compose herself
What's wrong, sweetheart
Did  do something
What did  do
You didn't do nothing
Did you hurt yourself
(he takes her foot) Whatd'ya do
Step on a thumbtack
Clarence, 've got something to tell you
didn't just happen to be at the theater
was paid to be there
What are you, a theater checker
You check up on the box office girls
Make sure they're not rippin' the place off
'm not a theater checker
'm a call girl
Pause
You're a whore
'm a call girl
There's a difference, ya know
(pause) don't know
Maybe there's not
That place you took me to last night, that comic book place
"Heroes For Sale"
Yeah, that one
Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you
Who
don't know
didn't talk with them
The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America
That  was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day
That dazzling imagination
It's over on the
All it says is: "Dear Clarence
"  couldn't write anymore
didn't not want to ever see you again
In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again
Las night
don't know
felt
hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts
So  just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself
" Who and what is a Drexl
My pimp
You have a pimp
Uh-huh
real live pimp
Uh-huh
Is he black
He thinks he is
He says his mother was Apache, but  suspect he's lying
Is he nice
Well,  wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent
But 've only been there about four days
He got a little rough with Arlene the other day
What did he do to Arlene
Slapped her around a little
Punched her in the stomch
It was pretty scary
This motherfucker sounds charming
Clarence is on his feet, furious
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there
How much longer before he's slappin' you around
Punchin' you in the stomach
How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place
At the bus station
He said 'd be a perfect call girl
And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me
They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar
And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night
At least five hundred
They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill"
And when  was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way
He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects
But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch
So what 'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes
It seemed like a lotta fun, but  don't really like it much, till last night
You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick
Since it was a secret,  just pretended  was on a date
An, um,  guess want a second date
Thank you
wanna see you again too
And again, and again, and again
Bama,  know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce
So, fuck it, you wanna marry me
What
Will you be my wife
When Alabama gives her answer, her voice cracks
Yes
(a little surprised) You will
You better not be fucking teasing me
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me
They seal it with a kiss
- - Alabama's wedding ring
The newlyweds are snuggling up together onthe couch watching
The movie they're watching is "The Incredible One-Armed Boxer vs
the Master of the Flying Guillotine"
Alabama watches the screen, but every so often she looks down to admre the ring on her hand
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"
don't believe so
Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer
We hear, off screen, the  Announcer say: (off) We'll return to Jimmy Wang Yu in
"The Incredible One-Armed Boxer vs
the Master of the Flying Guillotine", tonight's eight o'clock movie, after these important messages
Clarence looks at the
He feels the warmth of Alabama's hand holding his
We see commercials playing
He turns in her direction
She's absent-mindedly looking at her wedding ring
He smiles and turns back to the
More commercials

Worley
How do you do, Mr
Worley
Top o' the morning, Mrs
Worley
Bottom of the ninth
Mr
Worley
Oh, by the by, Mr
Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs
Alabama Worley
Of course
Are there others, Mr
Worley
Moving on top of her
Not for me
He starts kissing her and moving her down on the seat
She resists
(playfully) No no no no no no no no no
(playfully) Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
: big mean-looking black man in pimp's clothes
Bitch, you better git yo ass back on the street an' git me my money
Pimp on street corner with his arm around Alabama, giving her a sales pitch to a potential customer
'm tellin' you, my man, this bitch is fine
This girl's a freak
You can fuck 'er in the ass, fuck 'er in the mouth
Rough stuff, too
She's a freak for it
Jus' try not to fuck 'er up for life
: Pimp beating Alabama
You holdin' out on me, girl
Bitch, you never learn
: Alabama passionately kissing the uninterested pimp
Hang it up, momma
got no time for this bullshit
: showing kung fu film
: Clarence's face
There's definitely something different about his eyes
Clarence springs off the couch and goes into his bedroom
Alabama's startled by his sudden movement
(yelling after him) Where you goin', honey
(off) just gotta get somethin'
'  -  - Clarence splashes water on his face, trying to wash away the images that keep polluting his mind
Then, he hears a familiar voice
(off) Well
Can you live with it
Clarence turns and sees that the voice belongs to Elvis Presley
Clarence isn't surprised to see him
What
Can you live with it
Live with what
With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you
And gettin' away with it every day
Are you haunted
Yeah
You wanna get unhaunted
Yeah
Then shoot 'em
Shoot 'em in the face
And feed that boy to the dogs
can't believe what you're tellin' me
ain't tellin' ya nothin'
'm just sayin' what 'd do
You'd really do that
He don't got no right to live
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me
He doesn't deserve to live
And  do want to kill him
But  don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life
don't blame you
If  thought  could get away with it - Killin' 'em's the hard part
Gettin' away with it's the easy part
Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed
Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it
They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head
If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it
Clarence looks at Elvis
Clarence,  like ya
Always have, always will
'  -  - -  snub-nosed
38, which Clarence loads and sticks down his heavy athletic sock
'  -   - Clarence returns
Sweetheart, write down your former address
What
Write down Drexl's address
Why
So  can go over there and pick up your things
(really scared) No, Clarence
Just forget it, babe
just wanna disappear from there
He kneels down before her and holds her hand
Look, sweetheart, he scares you
But 'm not scared of that motherfucker
He can't touch you now
You're completely out of his reach
He poses absolutely no threat to us
So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it
You don't know him - You don't know me
Not when it comes to shit like this
have to do this
need for you to know you can count on me to protect you
Now write down the address
: " ,   " - It's pretty late at night
Clarence steps out of his red Mustang
He's right smack dab in the middle of a bad place to be in daytime
He checks the pulse on his neck; it's beating like a race horse
To pump himself up he does a quick Elvis Presley gyration
(in Elvis voice) Yeah
Yeah
He makes a beeline for the front door of a large, dark apartment building
- He's inside
His heart's really racing now
He has the  guide that Alabama wrote the address on in his hand
He climbs a flight of stairs and makes his way down a dark hallway to apartment 22, the residence of Drexl Spivey
Clarence knock on the door
Young Black Man, about twenty years old, answers the door
He has really big biceps and is wearing a black and white fishnet football jersey
You want somethin'
Drexl
Naw, man, 'm Marty
Watcha want
gotta talk to Drexl
Well, what the fuck you wanna tell him
It's about Alabama
figure jumps in the doorway wearing a yellow Farah Fawcett -shirt
It's our friend, Drexl Spivey
Where the fuck is that bitch
She's with me
Who the fuck are you
'm her husband
Well
That makes us practically related
Bring your ass on in
'   - Drexl and Marty about-face and walk into the room, continuing a conversation they were having and leaving Clarence standing in the doorway
This is not the confrontation Clarence expected
He trails in behind Drexl and Marty
(to Marty) What was  sayin'
Rock whores
You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores
They ass be young man
They got that fine young pussy
Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you
They give you hips, lips, and fingertips
Drexl looks over his shoulder at Clarence
(to Clarence) You know what 'm talkin' about
Drexl gestures to one of the three stoned Hookers lounging about the apartment
(to Marty) These bitches over here ain't shit
You stomp them bitches to death to get the kind of pussy 'm talkin' about
Drexl sits down at a couch with a card table in front of it, scattered with take-out boxes of Chinese food
black exploitation movie is playing on
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up
Pussy love pink rocks
This is not how Clarence expected to confront Drexl, but this is exactly what he expected Drexl to be like
He positions himself in front of the food table, demanding Drexl's attention
(eating with chopsticks, to Clarence) Grab a seat there, boy
Want some dinner
Grab yourself an egg roll
We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if--know
No thanks
No thanks
What does that mean
Means you ate before you came down here
All full
Is that it
Naw,  don't think so
think you're too scared to be eatin'
Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit
'm still a mystery to you
But  know exactly where your ass is comin' from
See, if  asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, 'd say to myself, "This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the world
Who know
Maybe he don't
Maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my Chinese, watch my
" See
You ain't even sat down yet
On that  there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out, and you ain't even bothered to look
You just been starin' at me
Now,  know 'm pretty, but  ain't as pretty as a couple of titties
Clarence takes out an envelope and throws it on the table
'm not eatin' 'cause 'm not hungry
'm not sittin' 'cause 'm not stayin'
'm not lookin' at the movie 'cause  saw it seven years ago
It's "The Mack" with Max Julian, Carol Speed, and Richard Pryor, written by Bobby Poole, directed by Michael Campus, and released by Cinerama Releasing Company in 1984
'm not scared of you
just don't like you
In that envelope is some payoff money
Alabama's moving on to some greener pastures
We're not negotiatin'
don't like to barter
don't like to dicker
never have fun in Tijuana
That price is non-negotiable
What's in that envelope is for my peace of mind
My peace of mind is worth that much
Not one penny more, not one penny more
You could hear a pin drop
Once Clarence starts talking Marty goes on full alert
Drexl stops eating and the Whores stop breathing
All eyes are on Drexl
Drexl drops his chopsticks and opens the envelope
It's empty
It's empty
Clarence flashes a wide Cheshire cat grin that says, "That's right, asshole
" Silence
Oooooooooh weeeeeeee
This child is terrible
Marty, you know what we got here
Motherfuckin' Charles Bronson
Is that who you supposed to be
Mr
Majestyk
Looky here, Charlie, none of this shit is necessary
ain't got no hold on Alabama
just tryin' to lend the girl a helpin' hand - Before Drexl finishes his sentence he picks up the card table and throws it at Clarence, catching him of guard
Marty comes up behind Clarence and throws his arm around his neck, putting him in a tight choke hold
Clarence, with his free arm, hits Marty hard with his elbow in the solar plexus
We'll never know if that blow had any effect because at just that moment Drexl takes a flying leap and tackles the two guys
All of them go crashing into the stereo unit and a couple of shelves that hold records, all of which collapse to the floor in a shower of LPs
Marty, who's on the bottom of the pile, hasn't let go of Clarence
Since Drexl's on top, he starts slamming fists into Clarence's face
Clarence, who's sandwiched between these two guys, can't do a whole lot about it
Ya wanna fuck with me
(hits Clarence) Ya wanna fuck with me
(hits Clarence) 'll show ya who you're fuckin' wit
He hits Clarence hard in the face with both fists
Clarence, who has no leverage whatsoever, grabs hold of Drexl's face and digs his nails in
He sticks his thumb in Drexl's mouth, grabs a piece of cheek, and starts twisting
Marty, who's in an even worse position, can do nothing but tighten his grip aroud Clarence's neck, until Clarence feels like his eyes are going to pop out of his head
Drexl's face is getting torn up, but he's also biting down hard on Clarence's thumb
Clarence raises his head and brings it down fast, crunching Marty's face, and busting his nose
Marty loosens his grip around Clarence's neck
Clarence wiggles free and gets up on his knees
Drexl and Clarence are now on an even but awkward footing
The two are going at each other like a pair of alley cats, not aiming their punches, keeping them coming fast and furious
They're not doing much damage to each other because of their positions, it's almost like a hockey fight
Marty sneaks up behind Clarence and smashes him in the head with a stack of LPs
This disorients Clarence
Marty grabs him from behind and pulls him to his feet
Drexl socks him in the face: one, two three
Then he kicks him hard in the balls
Marty lets go and Clarence hits the ground like a sack of potatoes
He curls up into a fetal position and holds his balls, tears coming out of his eyes
Drexl's face is torn up from Clarence's nails
Marty has blood streaming down his face frim his nose and on to his shirt
(to Marty) You
That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he
Naw
It don't feel too good but it's alright
Drexl kicks Clarence, who's still on the ground hurting
(to Clarence) You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy
You're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house
Gonna come in here and tell me
Talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees
Shit
Your ass must be crazy
(to Marty) don't think that white boy's got good sense
Hey, Marty
(laughing) He must of thought it was white boy day
It ain't white boy day, is it
(laughing) Naw, man, it ain't white boy day
(to Clarence) Shit, man, you done fucked up again
Next time you bogart your way into a nigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day
(hurting) Wannabee nigger
Fuck you
My mother was Apache
Drexl kicks him again
Clarence curls up
Drexl bends down and looks for Clarence's wallet in his jacket
Clarence still can't do much
The kick to his balls still has him down
Drexl finds it and pulls it out
He flips it open to driver's license
Well, well, well, looky what we got here
Clarence Worley
Sounds almost like a nigger name
(to Clarence) Hey, dummy
He puts his foot on Clarence's chest
Clarence's  as he looks up
Before you bought your dumb ass through the door,  didn't know shit just chalked it up to au revoir Alabama
But, because you think you're some macho motherfucker,  know who she's with
You
know who you are, Clarence Worley
And,  know where you live, 4900 116th  street, apartment 48
And 'll make a million-dollar bet, Alabama's at the same address
Marty, take the car and go get 'er
Bring her dumb ass back here
He hands Marty the driver's license
Maty goes to get the car keys and a jacket
(to Marty) 'll keep lover boy here entertained
(to Clarence) You know the first thing 'll do when she gets here
think 'll make her suck my dick, and 'll come all in her face
mean it ain't nuttin' new
She's done it before
But  want you as a audience
(hollering to Marty) Marty, what the fuck are you doin'
(off) 'm tryin' to find my jacket
Look in the hamper
Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there lately
While Drexl has his attention turned to Marty, Clarence reaches into his sock and pulls out the
38
he stick the barrel between Drexl's legs
Drexl, who's standing over Clarence, looks down just in time to see Clarence pull the trigger and blow his balls to bits
Tiny spots of blood speckle Clarence's face
Drexl shrieks in horror and pain, and falls to the ground
(off) What's happening
Marty steps into the room
Clarence doesn't hesitate, he shoots Marty four times in the chest
Two of three Hookers have run out of the front door, screaming
The other Hooker is curled up in the corner
She's too stoned to run, but stoned enough to be terrified
Drexl, still alive, is laying on the ground howling, holding what's left of his balls and his dick
Clarence points the gun at the remaining Hooker
Get a bag and put Alabama's thing in it
She doesn't move
You wanna get shot
ain't got all fuckin' day, so move it
The Hooker, tears of fear ruining her mascara, grabs a suitcase from under the bed, and, on her hands and knees, pushes it along the floor to Clarence
Clarence takes it by the handle and wobbles over to Drexl, who's curled up like a pillbug
- Clarence's forgotten driver's license in Marty's bloody hand
Clarence puts his foot on Drexl's chest
(to Drexl) Open you eyes, laughing boy
He doesn't
Clarence gives him a kick
Open your eyes
He does
It's now Drexl's  from the floor
You thought it was pretty funny, didn't you
He fires
- The bullet comes out of the gun and heads right toward us
When it reaches us, the screen goes awash in red
'  - The front swings open and Clarence walks in
Alabama jumps off the couch and runs toward Clarence, before she reaches him he blurts out: killed him
She stops short
've got some food in the car, 'll be right back
Clarence leaves
Except for the  playing, the room is quiet
Alabama sits on the couch
Clarence walks back into the room with a whole bounty of take-out food
He heaps it on to the coffee table and starts to chow down
Help yourself
got enough
am fuckin' starvin'
think  ordered one of everythin'
He stops and looks at here
am so hungry
He starts eating french fries and hamburgers
(in a daze) Was it him or you
Yeah
But to be honest,  put myself in that position
When  drove up there  said to myself, "If  can kill 'em and get away with it, 'll do it
"  could
So  did
Is this a joke
No joke
This is probably the best hamburger 've ever had
'm serious, 've never had a hamburger taste this good
Alabama starts to cry
Clarence continues eating, ignoring her
Come on, Bama, eat something
You'll feel better
She continues crying
He continues eating and ignoring her
Finally he spins on her, yelling: Why are you crying
He's not worth one of your tears
Would you rather it had been me
Do you love him
(no answer) Do you love him
(no answer) Do you love him
She looks at Clarence, having a hard time getting a word out
think what you did was
What
think what you did
What
was so romantic
Clarence is completely taken back
They meet in a long, passionate lovers' kiss
Their kiss breaks and slowly the world comes back to normal
gotta get outta these clothes
He picks up the suitcase and drops it on the table in front of them
(comically) Clean clothes
There is a god, Clarence flips open the suitcase
Alabama's and her husband's jaws drop
Clarence
Those aren't my clothes
: - We see the Hollywood Holiday Inn sign
Pan to the parking lot where Clarence's empty red Mustang is parked
- '  - - Dick's jaw drops
His hand reaches out of shot
- The reason for all the jaw dropping
the suitcase is full of cocaine
Clarence smiles, holding a bottle of wine
Alabama's watching the cable
Holy Mary, Mother of God
This is great, we got cable
(to Alabama) Bama, you got your blade
Keeping her eyes on the , she pulls out from her purse a Swiss army knife with a tiny dinosaur on it and tosses it to Clarence
Clarence takes off the corkscrew and opens the wine
He pours some wine into a couple of hotel plastic cups, a big glass for Dick, a little one for himself
He hands it to Dick
Dick takes it and drinks
This shit can't be real
It'll get ya high
He tosses the knife
Do you want some wine, sweetheart
Nope
'm not really a wine gal
Using the knife, Dick snorts some of the cocaine
He jumps back
It's fuckin' real
(to Clarence) It's fuckin' real
certainly hope so
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man
know
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got
Tell me
don't know
fuckin' lot
He downs his wine
Clarence fills his glass
This is Drexl's coke
Drexl's dead
This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it
And what Clarence wants to do is sell it
Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'
So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers
Look, Clarence, 'm not Joe Cocaine
Dick gulps half of his wine
Clarence fills up
But you're an actor
hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set
Yeah, they do
And maybe when  start being a successful actor 'll know those guys
But most of the people  know are like me
They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of
Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time - No way
The whole enchilada in one shot
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be
'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand
How difficult can that be
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group
Big shots
Fat cats
Guys who can use that kind of quantity
Guys who can afford two hundred thousand
Basically, guys  don't know
You don't know
And, more important, they don't know you
did talk with one guy who could possibly help you
Is he big league
He's nothing
He's in my acting class
But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz
thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this
He could use it
He could afford it
What'd'ya tell 'em
Hardly anything
wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't
What's this acting class guy's name
Elliot
Elliot what
Elliot Blitzer
, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff
Where
(to Alabama) The zoo
(to Dick) The zoo
(pause) What are you waiting for
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think
What's to think about
Shut up
First you come waltzing into my life after two years
You're married
You killed a guy
Two guys
Two guys
Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal
Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl
think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved
got no pity for a mad dog like that
think  should get a merit badge or somethin'
Dick rests his head in his hands
Look, buddy,  realize 'm layin' some pretty heavy shit on ya, but  need you to rise to the occasion
So, drink some more wine
Get used to the idea, and get your friend to the phone
- -  black panther, the four-legged kind, paces back and forth
Clarence, Alabama, Dick and Elliot Blitzer are walking through the zoo
One look at Elliot and you can see what type of actor he is, a real , blow-dry boy
As they walk and talk, Clarence is eating a box of animal crackers and Alabama is blowing soap bubbles
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading - Want an animal cracker
Yeah,
He takes one
Leave the gorillas
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars - Unloading
That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime
(trying to chill him out) Clarence
Where did you get it
grow it on my window-sill
The lights really great there and 'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street
(forcing a laugh) Ha ha ha
No really, where does it come from
Coco leaves
You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste - (turning to Dick) Look, Dick,  don't - (laughing) No problem, Elliot
'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all
Actually, 'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet
Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people 'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business
But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes:  gotta friend in the department
What department
What do you think, eightball
The police department
Duh
What else would  be talking about
Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions
Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour
He snagged this coke
But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust
He trusts you
We were in Four  together
We've known each other since childhood
So, 'm handling the sales part
He's my silent partner and he knows if  get fucked up,  won't drop dime on him
didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'
Sure
didn't hear anything
Elliot is more than satisfied
Clarence makes a comical face at Dick when Elliot's not looking
Dick is wearing -don't-believe-this-guy expresion
Alabama is forever blowing bubbles
: -   - We're in the snack bar area of the zoo
Alabama, Dick, and Elliot are sitting around a plastic outdoor table
Clarence is pacing around the table as he talks
Alabama is still blowing bubbles
(to Elliot) Do  look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream
Elliot hasn't the slightest idea what that is supposed to mean
What
Do  look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream
(with conviction) No
No, you don't
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me
Clarence
(to Dick) Let me handle this
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks
He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years
They're reliable
They're dependable
And, they're safe
Riddle me this, Batman
If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here
'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass
Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off
He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it
At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend
And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here
'm not puttin' him down
Hey, let him run wild
Have a ball, it's his money
But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts
Elliot has been silenced
He nods his head in agreement
-  -   - Movie producer, Lee Donowitz, is driving his Porsche through the winding Hollywood hills, just enjoying being rich and powerful
His cellular car phone rings, he answers
Hello
(pause) Elliot, it's Sunday
Why am  talkin' to you on Sunday
don't see enough of you during the week  gotta talk to you on Sunday
Why is it you always call me when 'm on the windiest street in
: Elliot is on the zoo payphone
Clarence is next to him
Dick is next to Clarence
Alabama is next to Dick, blowing bubbles
(on phone) 'm with that party you wanted me to get together with
Do you know what 'm talking about, Lee
: Store-fronts whiz by in the background
Why the hell are you calling my phone to talk about that
: Well, he'd here right now, and he insists on talking to you
: In the 7th street tunnel
Lee's voice echoes
Are you outta your fuckin' mind
: You said if  didn't get you on the - Clarence takes the receiverout of Elliot's hand
(into phone) Hello, Lee, it's Clarence
At last we meet
'  - Virgil's knocking on Dick's door
Floyd (Dick's room-mate) answers
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here
Naw, he ain't home right now
Do you live here
Yeah,  live here
Sorta room-mates
Exactly room-mates
Maybe you can help me
Actually, who 'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit
Clarence Worley
heard he was in town
Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama
Have you seen him
Are they stayin' here
Naw, they ain't stayin' here
But,  know who you're talkin' about
They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn
How do you know
You been there
No,  ain't been there
But  heard him say
Hollywood Holiday Inn
Kinda easy to remember
You're right
It is
-  - Clarence is still on the phone with Lee
Lee, the reason 'm talkin' with you is  want to open "Doctor Zhivago" in And  want you to distribute it
: Stopped in the traffic on Sunset Boulevard
don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie
: The biggest
The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee
We're talkin' a lot of film
man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that
And Lee, you're no idiot
: He's still on Sunset Boulevard, the traffic's moving better now
'm not sayin' 'm not interested
But being a distributer's not what 'm all about
'm a film producer, 'm on this world to make good movies
Nothing more
Now, having my big toe dipped into the distribution end helps me on many levels
Traffic breaks and Lee speeds along
The background whizzes past him
(continuing) But the bottom line is: 'm not Paramount
have a select group of distributers  deal with
buy their little movies
Accomplish what wanna accomplish, end of story
Easy, business-like, very little risk
: Now that's bullshit, Lee
Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk
'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable
This is "Doctor Zhivago"
This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half
Two years
That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine
: Speeding down a benchside road
Well, then, what's the hurry
Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration
: wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes
If  had time for a courtship, Lee,  would
'd take ya out, 'd hold your hand, 'd kiss you on the cheek at the door
But, 'm not in that position
need to know if we're in bed together, or not
If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire
Pause
Clarence hands the phone to Elliot
(to Elliot) He wants to talk ya
(into phone) Mr
Donowitz
(pause) told you, through Dick
(pause) He's in my acting class
(pause) About a year
(pause) Yeah, he's good
(pause) They grew up together
(pause) Sure thing
Elliot hangs up the phone
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire
He wants everybody there
(pointing to Clarence) He'll talk to you
If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're , he'll do business
If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door
He also wants a sample bag
No problems on both counts
He offers Elliot the animal crackers
Have a cookie
Elliot takes one
Thanks
He puts it in the mouth
That wasn't a gorilla, was it
- The red Mustang with Clarence and Alabama pulls up to the hotel
Alabama hops out
Clarence stays in
You did it, Quickdraw
'm so proud of you
You were like a ninja
Did  do my part
Babalouey, you were perfect,  could hardly keep from busting up
felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles
You were chillin', kind of creepy even
You totally fucked with his head
'm gonna go grab dinner
'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy
Then 'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch -rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms
They kiss
We now return to "Bullit" already in progress
He slams the Mustang in reverse and peels out of the hotel
Alabama walks her little walk from the parking lot to the pool area
Somebody whistles at her, she turns to them
Thank you
She gets to her door, takes out the key, and opens the door
- '  - She steps in only to find Virgil sitting on a chair placed in front of the door with a sawed-off shotgun aimed right at her
(calmly) Step inside and shut the door
She doesn't move, she's frozen
Virgil leans forward
(calmly) Lady
'm gonna shoot you in the face
She does exactly as he says
Virgil rises, still aiming the sawed-off
Step away from the door, move into the bathroom
She does
He puts the shotgun down on the chair, then steps closer to her
, Alabama, where's our coke, where's Clarence, and when's he coming back
think you got the wrong room, my name is Sadie
don't have any Coke, but there's a Pepsi machine downstairs
don't know any Clarence, but maybe my husband does
You might have heard of him, he plays football
Al Lylezado
He'll be home any minute, you can ask him
Virgil can't help but smile
You're cute
Virgil jumps up and does a mid-air kung fu kick which catches Alabama square in the face, lifting her off the ground and dropping her flat on her back
- Clarence, in his car, driving to get something to eat, singing to himself
(singing) "Land of stardust, land of glamour, Vistavision and Cinema, Everything about it is a must, To get to Hollywood, or bust
" - '  - Alabama's laying flat
She actually blacks out for a moment, but the salty taste of the blood in her mouth wakes her up
She opens her eyes and sees Virgil standing there, smiling
She closes them, hoping it's a dream
They open again to the same sight
She has never felt more helpless in her life
Hurts, don't it
It better
Took me a long time to kick like that
'm third-degree blackbelt, you know
At home  got trophies
Tournaments  was in
Kicked all kinds of ass
got great technique
You ain't hurt that bad
Get on your feet, Fruitloop
Alabama wobbily complies
Where's our coke
Where's Clarence
And when he's comin' back
Alabama looks in Virgil's eyes and realizes that without a doubt she's going to die, because this man is going to kill her
Go take a flying fuck and a rolling donut
Virgil doesn't waste a second
He gives her a sidekick straight to the stomach
The air is sucked out of her lungs
She falls to her knees
She's on all fours gasping for air that's just not there
Virgil whips out a pack of Lucky Strikes
He lights one up with a Zippo lighter
He takes a long, deep drag
Whatsamatta
Can't breathe
Get used to it
- Clarence walks through the door of some mom and pop fast-food restaurant
Woah
Smells like hamburgers in here
What's the biggest, fattest hamburger you guys got
The Iranian Guy at the counter says: That would be Steve's double chili cheeseburger
Well,  want two of them bad boys
Two large orders of chili fries
Two large Diet Cokes
(looking at a menu at the wall) And 'll tell you what, why don't you give me a combination burrito as well
- '  - Alabama is violently thrown into a corner of the room
She braces herself against the wall
She is very punchy
Virgil steps in front of her
You think your boyfriend would go through this kind of shit for you
Dream on, cunt
You're nothin' but a fuckin' fool
And your pretty face is gonna turn awful goddamn ugly in about two seconds
Now, where's my fuckin' coke
She doesn't answer
He delivers a spinning roundhouse kick on the head
Her head slams into the left side of the wall
Where's Clarence
Nothing
He gives her another kick to the head, this time from the other side
Her legs start to give way
He catches her and throws her back
He slaps her lightly in the face to revive her, she looks at him
When's Clarence getting back
She can barely raise her arm, but she somehow manages, and she gives him the middle finger
Virgil can't help but smile
You gotta lot of heart, kid
He gives her a spinning roadhouse kick to the head that sends her to the floor
- - Burgers sizzling on a griddle, Chili and cheese is put on them
Clarence is waiting for his order
He notices a  reading a copy of "Newsweek" with Elvis on the cover
That's a great issue
The Customer lowers his magazine a little bit
Yeah,  subscribe
It's a pretty decent one
Have you read the story on Elvis
No
Not yet
You know,  saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it
But, look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit
ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later
Man,  was ever wrong
That good, huh
He takes the magazine from the Customer's hands and starts flipping to the Elvis article
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years
It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys
don't know about you, but they give me the creeps
can see what you mean
Like, look at her
She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down
Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick
Clarence and the Customer laugh
- '  - Alabama's pretty beat up
She has a fat lip and her face is black and blue
She's crawling around on the floor
Virgil is tearing the place apart looking for the cocaine
He's also carrying on a running commentary
Now the first guy you kill is always the hardest
don't care if you're the Boston Strangler or Wyatt Earp
You can bet that Texas boy, Charles Whitman, the fella who shot all them guys from that tower, 'll bet you green money that that first little black dot that he took a bead on, was the bitch of the bunch
No foolin' the first one's a tough row to hoe
Now, the second one, while it ain't no Mardi Gras, it ain't half as tough row to hoe
You still feel somethin' but it's just so deluted this time around
Then you completely level off on the third one
The third one's easy
It's gotten to the point now 'll do it just to watch their expressions change
He's tearing the motel room up in general
Then he flips the matress up off the bed, and the black suitcase is right there
Alabama's crawling, unnoticed to where her purse is lying
Virgil flips open the black case and almost goes snow blind
Well, well, well, looky here
guess  just reached journey's end
Great
One less thing  gotta worry about
Virgil closes the case
Alabama sifts through her purse
She pulls out her Swiss army knife, opens it up
Virgil turns toward her
, Sugarpop, we've come to what  like to call the moment of truth - Alabama slowly rises clutching the thrust-out knife in both hands
Mr
Karate-man smiles
Kid, you got a lotta heart
He moves toward her
Alabama's hands are shaking
Tell you what 'm gonna do
'm gonna give you a free swing
Now,  only do that for people  like
He moves close
Alabama's eyes study him
He grabs the front of his shirt and rips it open
Buttons fly everywhere
Go ahead, girl, take a stab at it
(giggling) You don't have anything to lose
- Alabama's face
Virgil's right, she doesn't have anything to lose
Virgil's also right about his being the moment of truth
The ferocity in women that comes out at certain times, and is just here under the surface in many women all of the time, is unleashed
The absolute feeling of helplessness she felt only a moment ago has taken a one hundred and eighty degree turn into "'ll take this motherfucker with me if it's the last thing  do" seething hatred
Letting out a bloodcurling yell, she raises the knfe high above her head, then drops to her knees and plunges it deep into Virgil's right foot
- ' Talk about bloodcurling yells
Virgil bends down and carefully pulls the knife from his foot, tears running down his face
While Virgil's bent down, Alabama smashes an Elvis Presley whiskey decanter that Clarence bought her in Oklahoma over his head
It's only made of plaster, so it doesn't kill him
Virgil's moving toward Alabama, limping on his bad foot
, no more Mr
Nice-guy
Alabama picks up the hotel  and tosses it to him
He instinctively catches it and, with his arms full of television, Alabama cold-cocks him with her fist in the nose, breaking it
Her eyes go straight to the door, then to the sawed-off shotgun by it
She runs to it, bends over the chair for the gun
Virgil's left foot kicks her in the back, sending her flying over the chair and smashing into the door
Virgil furiously throws the chair out of the way and stands over Alabama
Alabama's lying on the ground laughing
Virgil has killed a lot of people, but not one of them has ever laughed before he did it
What's so fuckin' funny
(laughing) You look so ridiculous
She laughs louder
Virgil's insane
He picks her off the floor, then lifts her off the ground and throws her through the glass shower door in the bathroom
Laugh it up, cunt
You were in hysterics a minute ago
Why ain't you laughing now
Alabama, lying in the bathtub, grabs a small bottle of hotel shampoo and squeezes it out in her hand
Virgil reaches in the shower and grabs hold of her hair
Alabama rubs the shampoo in his face
He lets go of her and his hands go to his eyes
Oh Jesus
She grabs hold of a hefty piece of broken glass and plunges it into his face
Oh Mary, help me
The battered and bruised and bloody Alabama emerges from the shower
She's clutching a big, bloody piece of broken glass
She's vaguely reminiscent of a Tasmanian devil
Poor Virgil can't see very well, but he sees her figure coming toward him
He lets out a wild haymaker that catches her in the jaw and knocks her into the toilet
He recovers almost immediately and takes the porcelain lid off the back of the toilet tank
Virgil whips out a
45 automatic from his shoulder holster, just as Alabama brings the lid down on his head
He's pressed up against the wall with this toilet lid hitting him
He can't get a good shot in this tight environment, but he fires anyway, hitting the floor, the all, the toilet, and the sink
The toilet lid finally shatters against Virgil's head
He falls to the ground
Alabama goes to the medicine cabinet and whips out a big can of Final Net hairspray
She pulls a Bic lighter out of her pocket, and, just as Virgil raises his gun at her, she flicks the Bic and sends a stream of hairspray through the flame, which results in a big ball of fire that hits Virgil right in the face
He fires off two shots
One hits the wall, another hits the sink pipe, sending water spraying
Upon getting his face fried Virgil screams and jumps up, knocking Alabama down, and runs out of the bathroom
Virgil collapses on the floor of the living room
Then, he sees the sawed-off laying on the ground
He crawls toward it
Alabama, in the bathroom, sees where he's heading
She picks up the
45 automatic and fires at him
It's empty
She's on her feet and into the room
He reaches the shotgun, his hands grasp it
Alabama spots and picks up the bloody Swiss army knife
She takes a knife-first-running-dive at Virgil's back
She hits him
He arches up, firing the sawed-off into the ceiling, dropping the gun, and sending a cloud of plaster and stucco all over the room
Alabama snatches the shotgun
Arched over on his back Virgil and Alabama make eye contact
The first blast hits him in the shoulder, almost tearing his arm off
The second hits him in the knee
The third plays hell with his chest
Alabama then runs at him, hitting him in the head with the butt of the shotgun
Ever since he's been firing it's as if some other part of her brain has been functioning independently
She's been absent-mindedly saying the prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi
Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace; where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; and where there is sadness, joy
Divine Master, grant that  may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love; for it is in giving that we receive, it is pardoning that we are pardoned, and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life
Clarence, who's been hearing gunshots, bursts through the door, gun drawn, only to see Alabama, hitting a dead guy on the head, with a shotgun
Honey
She continues
He puts his gun away
Sweetheart
Cops are gonna be here any minute, She continues
He takes the gun away from her, and she falls to the ground
She lies on the floor trembling, continuing with the downward swings of her arms
Clarence grabs the shotgun and the cocaine, and tosses Alabama over his shoulder
: - Everybody is outside their rooms watching as Clarence walks through the pool area with his bundle
Sirens can be heard
- Clarence is driving like mad
Alabama's passed out in the passenger seat
She's muttering to herself
Clarence has one hand on the steering wheel and the other strokes Alabama's hair
Sleep baby
Don't dream
Don't worry
Just sleep
You deserve better than this
'm so sorry
Sleep my angel
Sleep peacefully
6 - new motel
Clarence's red Mustang is parked outside
6 - '  - Alabama, with a fat lip and a black and blue face, is asleep in bed
Clarence is in a nondescript room speaking directly to the camera
He's in a headshot
feel so horrible about what she went through
That fucker really beat the shit out of her
She never told him where  was
It's like  always felt that the way she felt about me was a mistake
She couldn't really care that much
always felt in the back of my mind,  don't know, she was jokin'
But, to go through that and remain loyal, it's very easy to be unraptured with words, but to remain loyal when it's easier, even excusable, not to - that's a test of oneself
That's a true romance
swear to God, 'll cut off my hands and gouge out my eyes before 'll every let anything happen to that lady again
: - wonderful, gracefully flowing shot of the Hollywood Hills
Off in the distance we hear the roar of a car engine
- Vaaarrroooooommmm
silver Porsche is driving hells bells, taking quick corners, pushing it to the edge
- Elliot Blitzer is the driver, standing on it
blond, glitzy Coke Whore is sitting next to him
They're having a ball
Then they're seeing a red and blue light flashing in the rear-view window
It's the cops
Fuck
knew it
fucking knew it
should have my head examined, driving like this
(he pulls over) Kandi, you gotta help me
What can  do
He pulls out the sample bag of cocaine that Clarence gave him earlier
You gotta hold this for me
You must be high
Uh-huh
No way
(frantically) Just put it in your purse
'm not gonna put that shit in my purse
They won't search you
promise
You haven't done anything
No way, JosE
Please, they'll be here any minute
Just put it in your bra
'm not wearing a bra
(pleading) Put it in your pants
No
You're the one who wanted to drive fast
Read my lips
She mouths the word "no"
After all 've done for you, you fuckin' whore
She goes to slap him, she hits the bag of cocaine instead
It rips open
Cocaine completely covers his blue suit
At that moment Elliot turns to face a flashing beam
Tears fill his eyes
-   - Elliot is sitting in a chair at the table
Two young, good-looking, casually dressed, Starsky and Hutch-type   are questioning him
They're known in the department as Nicholson and Dimes
The dark-haired one is Cody Nicholson, and the blond is Nicky Dimes
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine - Not a tiny little vial - But a fuckin' baggie
No don't sit here and feed us some shit
You got caught
It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught
But now we gotcha
, Mr
Elliot actor, you've just made the big time - You're no longer an extra - Or a bit player - Or a supporting actor - You're a fuckin' star
And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience - But there is a bright side though
If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on - And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass
Pussy just won't feed right anymore - That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions
Elliot starts crying
Nicholson and Dimes exchange looks and smile
Mission accomplished
-  '  - is sitting behind his desk, where he spends about seventy-five percent of his day
He's you standard rough, gruff, no-nonsense, by-the-book-type police captain
Nicholson
Dimes
Het in here
The two casually dressed, sneaker-wearing cops rush in, both shouting at once
Krinkle, this is it
We got it, man
And it's all ours
mean talk about fallin' into somethin'
You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful
Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, 'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over - Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month
We have it, and if  say we,  don't mean me and him, 'm referring to the whole department
Haven't had a decent bust this whole month
Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion - Both you, idiots shut up,  can't understand shit
Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about
Okee-dokee
It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke
So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him
Nicholson and
Nicholson and  go to work on him
Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it
Scarin' the shit outta him
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid
So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'
And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it
: - Detroit
Very fancy restaurant
Four wise-guy Hoods, one older, the other three, youngsters, are seated at the table with Mr
Coccotti
- And so, tomorrow morning comes, and no Virgil
check with Nick Cardella, who Virgil was supposed to leave my narcotics with, he never shows
Now, children, somebody is stickin' a red-hot poker up my asshole and what  don't know is whose hand's on the handle
- #1 () You think Virgil started gettin' big ideas
It's possible
Anybody can be carried away with delusions of grandeur
But after that incident in Ann Arbor,  trust Virgil
- #2 () What happened
-() Virgil got picked up in a warehouse shakedown
He got five years, he served three
Anybody who clams up and does hid time,  don't care how  feel about him personally, he's
: ' It seems a cop from some department, we don't know where, stole a half a million dollars of coke from the property cage and he's been sittin' on it for a year and a half
Now the cops got this weirdo - Suspect's words - To front for him
So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz
He produced "Coming Home in a Body Bag"
That Vietnam movie
Uh-huh
That was a good fuckin' movie
Sure was
Do you believe him
believe he believes him
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire
He'll wear a wire
We talked him into it
Dirty cops
We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this
Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the
Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust
Cocaine
Dirty cops
Hollywood
This is Crocket and Tubbs all the way
And we found it, so we want the fuckin' collar
: - - #3 () Maybe Virgil dropped it off at Cardella's
Cardella turns Virgil's switch off, and Cardella decides to open up his own fruit stand
Excuse me, Mr
Coccotti
(to Marvin) Do you know Nick Cardella
No
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk
didn't mean - Shut your mouth
Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth before you were in your daddy's nutsack
What sun do you walk under you can throw a shadow on Nick Cardella
Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy
Children, we're digressing
Another possibility is that rat-fuck whore and her wack-a-doo cowboy boyfriend out-aped Virgil
Knowing Virgil,  find that hard to believe
But they sent Drexl to hell, and Drexl was no faggot
So you see, children,  got a lot of questions and no answers
Find out who this wing-and-a-prayer artist is and take him off at the neck
: "  " - Clarence's red Mustang is parked on top of a hill just off of Imperial Highway
As luck would have it, somebody has abandoned a ratty old sofa on the side of the road
Clarence and Alabama sit on the sofa, sharing a Jumbo Java, and enjoying the sunrise and wonderful view of the  Airport runways, where planes are taking off and landing
plane takes off, and they stop and watch
Ya know,  used to fuckin' hate airports
Really
With a vengeance,  hated them
How come
used to live by one back in Dearborn
It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit
hated where  was, but couldn't do anythin' about it
didn't have enough money
It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here  was livin' next to an airport
Whenever  went outside,  saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show
All day long 'm seein', hearin' people doin' what wanted to do most, but couldn't
What
Leavin' Detroit
Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips
Fun, fun, fun, fun
Another plane takes off
But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook love airports now
Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch
been in America all my life
'm due for a change
wanna see what  in other countries is like
Besides, it's more dramatic
Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove
Cancoon
Why Cancoon
It's got a nice ring to it
It sounds like a movie
"Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon"
Don't 'cha think
But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing
They kiss
Don't you worry 'bout anything
It's all gonna work out for us
We deserve it
'  - Dick, Clarence and Alabama are just getting ready to leave for the drug deal
Floyd lays on the couch watching
Alabama's wearing dark glasses because of the black eye she has
(to Floyd) You sure that's how you get to the Beverly Wilshire
've partied there twice
Yeah, 'm sure
Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass
(to Clarence) Come on, Clarence, lets go
Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby
'm just makin' sure we got everything
(pointing to Alabama) You got yours
She holds up the suitcase
The phone rings
The three pile out the door
Floyd picks up the phone
Hello
He puts his hand over the receiver
Dick, it's for you
You here
No
left
He starts to close the door then opens it again
'll take it
(he takes the receiver) Hello
(pause) Hi, Catherine,  was just walkin' out the - (pause) Really
(pause) don't believe it
(pause) She really said that
(pause) 'll be by first thing
(pause) No, thank you for sending me out
(pause) Bye-bye
He hangs up and looks to Clarence
(stunned) got the part on "
Hooker"
No shit
Dick, that's great
Clarence and Alabama are jumping around
Floyd even smiles
(still stunned) They didn't even want a callback
They just hired me like that
Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies
We start shooting Monday
My call is for seven o'clock in the morning
Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car
We can't be late
Dick looks at Clarence
He doesn't want to go
Clarence
Yeah
Um, nothing, let's go
They exit
-  - We see the airport and move in closer on a hotel on a landscape
-   - Lenny can be seen putting a shotgun together
He is sitting on a bed
Dario enters the frame with his own shotgun
He goes over to Lenny and gives him some shells
Marvin walks through the frame cocking his own shotgun
The bathroom door opens behind Lenny and Frankie walks out twirling a couple of
45 automatics in his hands
-  '   - Nicholson and Dimes and   from internal affairs are in a room on the same floor as Donowitz
They have just put a wire on Elliot
, say something
(talking loud into the wire) Hello
Hello
Hello
How now brown cow
Just talk regular
(normal tone) "But soft
What light through yonder window breaks
It is the east and Juliet is the sun
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief -" Are you gettin' this shit
Clear as a bell
Nicholson, Dime, and the head  Officer, Wurlitzer, huddle by Elliot
Now, remember, we'll be monitoring just down the hall
And if there's any sign of trouble you'll come in
Like gang-busters
Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine
So you gotta get him to admit on tape that he's buying this coke
And this fellow Clarence
Yeah, Clarence
You gotta get him name the police officer behind all this
'll try
You do more than try
You do
Hope you're a good actor, Elliot
- Clarence, Dick and Alabama en route
You got that playing basketball
Yeah
got elbowed right in the eye
And if that wasn't enough,  got hurled the ball when 'm not looking
Wam
Right in my face
They stop at a red light
Clarence looks at Alabama
Red light means love, baby
He and Alabama start kissing
- Marvin, Frankie, Lenny and Dario in a rented Caddy
- Clarence, Alabama, and Dick get out of the red Mustang
Dick takes the suitcase
'll take that
Now, remember, both of you, let me do the talking
Clarence takes out his
38
Dick reacts
They walk and talk
What the fuck did you bring that for
In case
In case of what
In case they try to kill us
don't know, what do you want me to say
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp - know that Richard
don't think 'll need it
But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it
Pause
Clarence stops walking
Hold it, guys
don't know about the rest of you, but 'm pretty scared
What say we forget the whole thing
Dick and Alabama are both surprised and relieved
Do you really mean it
No,  don't really mean it
Well,  mean, this is our last chance to think about it
How 'bout you, Bama
thought it was what you wanted, Clarence
It is what  want
But  don't want to spend the next ten years in jail don't want you guys to go to jail
We don't know what could be waiting for us up there
It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be
The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars
'm just looking at the downside
Now's a helluva time to play "what if"
This is our last chance to play "what if"
want to do it
'm just scared of getting caught
It's been fun thinking about the money but  can walk away from it, honey
That rhymes
He kisses her
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here
Yeah, let's just get outta here
The three walk back to the car
Clarence gets behind the wheel
The other two climb in
Clarence hops back out
'm sorry guys,  gotta do it
As petrified as  am,  just can't walk away
'm gonna be kicking myself in the ass for the rest of my life if don't go in there
Lee Donowitz isn't a gangster lookin' to skin us, and he's not a cop, he's a famous movie producer lookin' to get high
And 'm just the man who can get him there
So what say we throw caution to the wind and let the chips fall where they may
Clarence grabs the suitcase and makes a beeline for the hotel
Dick and Alabama exchange looks and follow
-  - Elliot's walking around the lobby
He's very nervous, so he's singing to himself
(singing) There's a man who leads a life of danger, To everyone he meets he stays a stranger
Be careful what you say, you'll give yourself away
- '   - Nicholson, Dimes, Wurlitzer, and the three other Detectives surround the tape machine
Coming from the machine: ' (off) odds are you won't live to see tomorrow, secret agent man, secret agent man
Nicholson looks at Dimes
Why, all of the sudden, have  got a bad feeling
: Clarence enters the lobby alone, he's carrying the suitcase
He spots Elliot and goes in his direction
Elliot sees Clarence approaching him
He says to himself, quietly: Elliot, your motivation is to stay out of jail
Clarence walks up to Elliot, they shake hands
Where's everybody else
They'll be along
Alabama and Dick enter the lobby, they join up with Clarence and Elliot
Hi, Dick
How you doin', Elliot
Well,  guess it's about that time
guess so
Follow me
-  - The four of them are riding in the elevator
As luck would have it, they have the car to themselves
Rinky-drink elevator Muzak is playing
They are all silent
Elliot
Yeah
Get on your knees
Not sure he heard him right
What
Clarence hits the stop button on the elevator panel and whips out his
38
said get on your fuckin' knees
Elliot does it immediately
Dick and Alabama react
Shut up, both of you,  know what 'm doin'
: ' Pandemonium
He knows
How the fuck could he know
He saw the wire
How's he supposed to see the wire
He knows something's up
: Clarence puts the
38 against Elliot's forehead
You must think 'm pretty stupid, don't you
No answer
Don't you
(petrified) No
(yelling) Don't lie to me, motherfucker
You apparently think 'm the dumbest motherfucker in the world
Don't you
Say: Clarence, you are without a doubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world
Say it
: ' We gotta get him outta there
Whatta we gonna do
He's in an elevator
: Say it, goddamn it
You are the dumbest person in the world
Apparently 'm not as dumb as you thought  am
No
No you're not
What's waiting for us up there
Tell me or 'll pump two right in your face
: He's bluffin ya, Elliot
Can't you see that
You're an actor, remember, the show must go on
This guy's gonna kill him
: Stand up
Elliot does
The
38 is still pressed against his forehead
Like Nick Carter used to say:  'm wrong, 'll apologize
want you to tell me what's waiting for us up there
Something's amiss
can feel it
If anything out of the ordinary goes down, believe this, you're gonna be the first one shot
Trust me,  am , you fuck with me, you die
Now quit making me mad and tell me why 'm so fucking nervous
: ' He's bluffin',  knew it
He doesn't know shit
Don't blow it, Elliot
He's bluffin'
He just told you so himself
You're an actor, so act, motherfucker
: Elliot still hasn't answered
With the
38 up against Elliot's head Clarence puts his palm over the top of the gun to shield himself from the splatter
Alabama and Dick can't believe what he's gonna do
Elliot, tears running down, starts talking for the benefit of the people at the other end of the wire
He sounds like a little boy
don't wanna be here
wanna go home
wish somebody would just come and get me 'cause  don't like this
This is not what  thought it would be
And  wish somebody would just take me away
Just take me away Come and get me
'Cause  don't like this anymore
can't take this
'm sorry but just can't
So, if somebody would just come to my rescue, everything would be alright
: ' Nicholson and Dimes shake their hands, They have a "well, that's that" expression an their faces
: Clarence puts down the gun and hugs Elliot
Sorry, Elliot
Nothing personal
just hadda make sure you're all right
'm sure
really apologize for scaring you so bad, but believe me, 'm just as scared as you
Friends
Elliot, in a state of shock, takes Clarence's hand
Dick and Alabama are relieved
: ' Nicholson and Dimes listen open-mouthed, not believing what they're hearing
'  - Floyd still lying on the couch watching
He hasn't moved since we last saw him
There is a knock from the door
(not turning away from ) It's open
The front door flies open and the four Wise-guys rapidly enter the room
The door slams shut
All have their sawed-offs drawn and pointing at Floyd
Yes
Are you Dick Ritchie
No
Do you know a Clarence Worley
Yes
Do you know where we can find him
He's at the Beverly Wilshire
Where's that
Well, you go down Beechwood
- '   - The door opens and reveals an extremely muscular guy with an Uzi strapped to his shoulder standing in the doorway, his name is Monty
Hi, Elliot
Are these your friends
You could say that
Everybody, this is Monty
'mon in
Lee's in the can
He'll be out in a quick
They all move into the room, it is very luxurious
Another incredibly muscular , Boris, is sitting on the sofa, he too has an Uzi
Monty begins patting everybody down
Sorry, nothin personal
He starts to search Clarence
Clarence back away
No need to search me, daredevil
All you'll find is a
38 calibre
Boris gets up from the couch
What compelled you to bring that along
The same thing that compelled you, Beastmaster, to bring rapid-fire weaponry to a business meeting
'll take that
You'll have to
The toilet flushes in the bathroom
The door swings open and Lee Donowitz emerges
They're here
Who's who
Lee, this is my friend Dick, and these are his friends, Clarence and Alabama
(pointing at Clarence) This guy's packin'
Really
Well,  have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous
But, Lee, 'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy
So, if you want, 'll put the gun on the table
don't think that'll be necessary
Let's all have a seat
Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody
They all sit around a fancy glass table except for Boris, who's getting the coffee, and Monty, who's standing behind Lee's chair
Oh, Mr
Donowitz - Lee, Clarence
Please don't insult me
Call me Lee
, sorry, Lee
just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies
After "Apocalypse Now"  think it's the best Vietnam movie ever
Thank you very much, Clarence
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars,  can't stand
"Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs
Kramer", "Gandhi"
All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit
hear you talkin' Clarence
We park our cars in the same garage
Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap
All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books
Boris starts placing clear-glass coffee cups in front of everybody and fills everybody's cup from a fancy coffee pot that he handles like an expert
Clarence, there might be somebody somewhere that agrees with you more than do, but  wouldn't count on it
Clarence is on a roll and he knows it
They ain't plays, they ain't books, they certainly ain't movies, they're films
And do you know what films are
They're for people who don't like movies
"Mad Max", that's a movie
"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly", that's a movie
"Rio Bravo", that's a movie
"Rumble Fish", that's a fuckin' movie
And, "Coming Home in a Body Bag", that's a movie
It was the first movie with balls to win a lot of Oscars since the "The Deer Hunter"
: ' They're all listening to this
What's this guy doin'
Makin' a drug deal or gettin' a job on the "New Yorker"
: ' My uncle Roger and uncle Cliff, both of which were in Nam, saw "Coming Home in a Body Bag" and thought it was the most accurate Vietnam film they'd ever seen
You know, Clarence, when a veteran of that bullshit wars says that, it makes the whole project worthwhile
Clarence, my friend, and  call you my friend because we have similar interests, let's take a look at what you have for me
: ' Thank God
: ' Clarence puts the suitcase on the table
Lee, when you see this you're gonna shit
: The four Wise-guys are at the desk
(quietly to the others) What was the Jew-boy's name
Donowitz, he said
- How can  help you, Gentlemen
Yeah, we're from Warner Bros
What room is Mr
Donowitz in
: ' Lee's looking over the cocaine and sampling it
Now, that's practically uncut
You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more
Don't worry, 'll desire
Boris, could  have some more coffee
Me too, Boris
Boris fills both of their cups
They both, calm as a lake, take cream and sugar
All eyes are on them
Lee uses light cream and sugar, he begins stirring this cup
Clarence uses very heavy cream and sugar
(stirring loudly) You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar
'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up
Both are cool as cucumbers
have to hand it to you, this is not nose garbage, this is quality
Can Boris make anybody a sandwich
got all kinds of sandwich shit from Canters in there
No thank you
No
But thanks
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset
ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick
Where'd you go
Norms in Van Nuys
Bastards
That's why  always eat at Lawreys
Lee continues looking at the merchandise
Alabama writes something in her napkin with a pencil
She slides the napkin over to Clarence
It says: "You're so cool" with a tiny heart drawn on the bottom of it
Clarence takes the pencil and draws an arrow through the heart
She takes the napkin and puts it in her pocket
Lee looks up
, Clarence, the merchandise is perfect
But, whenever 'm offered a deal that's too good to be true, it's because it's a lie
Convince me you're on the level
: ' If he don't bite, we ain't got shit except posession
Convince him
: ' Well, Lee, it's like this
You're getting the bargain of a lifetime because don't know what the fuck 'm doing
You're used to dealin' with professionals
'm not a professional
'm a rank amateur
could take that, and  could cut it, and  could sell it a little bit at a time, and make a helluva lot more money
But, in order to do that, 'd have to become a drug dealer
Deal with cut-throat junkies, killers, worry about getting busted all of the time
Just meeting you here today scares the shit outta me, and you're not a junkie, a killer or a cop, you're a fucking movie-maker
like you, and 'm still scared
'm a punk kid who picked up a rock in the street, only to find out it's the Hope Diamond
It's worth a million dollars, but  can't get the million dollars for it
But, you can
So, 'll sell it to you for a couple a hundred thousand
You go to make a million
It's all found money to me anyway
Me and my wife are minimum wage kids, two hundred thousand is the world
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'
(to Elliot) Thanks a lot, bigmouth
knew you were a squid the moment  laid eyes on you
In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit
(to Lee) He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop
He just saw his chance and he took it
Why does he trust you
We grew up together
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it
bullshitted him
Lee starts laughing
That's wild
This fucking guy's a madman
love it
Monty, go in the other room and get the money
Clarence, Alabama and Dick exchange looks
: ' Nicholson and Dimes exchange looks
& Bingo
: The four Wise-guys are coming up
: ' (pointing to Alabama) What's your part in this
'm his wife
(referring to Dick) How 'bout you
know Elliot
And Elliot knows me
Tell me, Clarence, what department does you friend work in
Dick and Alabama panic
(without missing a beat) Carson County Sheriffs
: ' The internal affairs officers high five
: ' Monty brings in a briefcase of money and puts it down on the table
Wanna count your money
Actually, they can count it
'd like to use the little boy's room
: ' They all stand
, boys
Let's go get 'em
- '   -  - Clarence steps inside the bathroom and shuts the door
As soon as it's shut he starts doing the twist
He can't believe he's pulled it off
He goes to the toilet and starts taking a piss
He turns and sees Elvis sitting on the sink
Clarence,  gotta hand it to ya
You were cooler than cool
was dying
thought for sure everyone could see it on my face
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes
Being cool is hard on your body
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "'ll take that gun", "You'll have to"
That was cool, wasn't it
You know,  don't even know where that came from
just opened my mouth and it came out
After  said it  thought, that's a cool line,  gotta remember that
: ' Everything's just as it was
Sudenly, Nicholson, Dimes and the four Detectives break into the room with guns drawn
& Police
Freeze, you're all under arrest
Everybody at the table stands up
Boris and Monty stand ready with the Uzis
You two
Put the guns on the floor and back away
Fuck you
All you pigs put your guns on the floor and back away
Monty, what are you talking about
So what they say
This is your last warning
Drop those fuckin' guns
This is your last warning
We could kill all six of ya and ya fuckin' know it
Now get on the floor
What the fuck am  doing here
Boris
Everybody's gonna get killed
They're cops
So they're cops
Who gives a shit
Lee, something  never told you about me
don't like cops
, let's everybody calm down and get nice
Nobody has to die
We don't want it, and you don't want it
We don't want it
The four Wise-guys burst through the door, shotguns drawn, except for Frankie, who has two
45 automatics, one in each hand
Half of the cops spin around
Freeze
Who are you guys
Police
(to Lenny) Do we get any extra if we have to kill cops
: Clarence and Elvis
How do you think 'm doin' with Lee
Are you kiddin'
He loves you
You don't think 'm kissin' his ass, do you
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass
'm not lyin' to him
mean it
loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag"
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that
Elvis fixes Clarence's collar
like ya, Clarence
Always have
: ' This is a Mexican stand-off if there ever was one
Gangsters on one end with shotguns
Bodyguards with machine guns on the other
And cops with handguns in the middle
Dick's ready to pass out
Alabama's so scared she pees on herself
For Elliot, this has been the worst day of his life, and he's just about had it
Officer Dimes
Officer Dimes
Dimes looks at Elliot
This has nothing to do with me anymore
Can  just leave and you guys just settle it by yourselves
Elliot, shut the fuck up and stay put
(to Elliot) How did you know his name
How the fuck did he know your name
Why, you fuckin' little piece of shit
Lee, understand,  didn't want to - Shut the fuck up
Well,  hope you're not planning on acting any time in the next twenty years 'cause your career is over as of now
You might as weel burn your card
To think  treated you as a son
And you stabbed me in the heart
Lee can't control his anger any more
He grabs the coffee pot off the table and flings hot coffee into Elliot's face
Elliot screams and falls to his knees, Instinctively, Nicholson shoots Lee twice
Alabama screams
Boris lets loose with his Uzi, pinting Nicholson red with bullets
(screaming) Cody
Nicholson flies backwards
Marvin fires his shotgun, hits Nicholson in the back, Nicholson's body jerks back and forth then on the floor
Clarence opens the bathroom door
Dimes hits the ground firing
shot catches Clarence in the forehead
Alabama screams
Dario fires his sawed-off
It catches Clarence in the chest, hurling him on the bathroom sink, smashing the mirror
It might have been a stand-off before, but once the firing starts everybody either hits the ground or runs for cover
Dimes, Alabama, Dick, Lenny, an  Officer and Wurtlitzer hit the ground
Boris dives into the kitchen area
Monty tips the table over
Marvin dives behind the sofa
Dario runs out of the door and down the hall
With bullets flying this way and that, some don't have time to anything
Two  Officers are shot right away
Frankie takes an Uzi hit
He goes down firing both automatics
Elliot gets it from both sides
Alabama is crawling across the floor, like a soldier in war, towards the bathroom
Clarence, still barely alive, lays on the sink, twitching
He moves and falls off
Alabama continues crawling
Marvin brings his sawed-off from behind the sofa and fires
The shotgun blast hits the glass table and Monty
Monty stands up screaming
The Cops on the ground let loose, firing into Monty
As Monty gets hit, his finger hits the trigger of the Uzi, spreading fire all over the apartment
- Cop cars start arriving in twos in front of the hotel
: Alabama crawling
The suitcase full of cocaine is by Dick
Dick grabs it and tosses it in the air
Marvin comes from behind the sofa and fires
The suitcase is hit in mid-air
White powder goes everywhere
The room is enveloped in cocaine
Dick takes this cue and makes a dash out the door
An  Officer goes after him
Lenny makes a break for it
Wurlitzer goes after him but is pinned down by Marvin
Alabama reaches the bathroom and finds Clarence
Sweety
Clarence's face is awash with blood
can't see you
've got blood in my eyes
He dies
Alabama tries to give him outh-to-mouth resuscitation
-  - Dario runs down the hall, right into a cluster of uniformed police
He fires his shotgun, hitting two, just before the others chop him to ribbons
- The hallway's empty but we hear footsteps approaching fast
Dick comes around the corner, running as if on fire
Then we see the  Officer turn the same corner
(aiming gun) Freeze
Dick does
'm unarmed
Put your hands on your head, you son-of-a-bitch
He does
Then, from off screen, a shotgun blast tears into the  Officer, sending him to the wall
Oh shit
He starts running again and runs out of frame, then Lenny turns around the corner and runs down the hall
Dick runs into the elevator area, he hits the buttons, he's trapped, it's like a box
Lenny catches up
Dick raises his hands
Lenny aimes his sawed-off
Look,  don't know who you are, but whatever it was that  did to you, 'm sorry
Two elevator doors on either side of them open
Lenny looks at Dick
He drops his aim and says: Lotsa luck
Lenny dives into one elevator car
Dick jumps into the other, just as the doors close
: The Mexican stand-off has become two different groups of two pinning each other down
Wurlitzer has Marvin pinned down behind the sofa and Dimes has Boris pinned down in the kitchen
In the bathroom, Alabama's pounding on Clarence's bloody chest, trying to get his heart started
It's not working
She slaps him hard in the face a couple of times
Wake up, goddamn it
Dimes discards his handgun and pulls one of the sawed-off shotguns from the grip of a dead Wise-guy
Boris peeks around the wall to fire
Dimes lets loose with a blast
scream is heard
(off) 'm shot
Stop
Throw out your gun, asshole
The Uzi's tossed out
Dimes goes to where Wurlitzer is
(to Marvin) , black jacket
It's two against one now
Toss the gun and lie face down on the floor or die like all you friends
The shotgun's tossed out from behind the sofa
-  - Dick's sitting on the ground, he can't believe any of this
The doors open on the fourth floor
He runs out into the hallway
He starts trying the room doors for an open one
Oh, God, if you just get me outta this  swear to God 'll never fuck up again
Please, just let me get to "
Hooker" on Monday
'  - Dick steps in
Three gorgeous girls are doing a killer aerobics workout to a video on
The music is so loud they're so into their exercises, they don't hear Dick tiptoe behind them and crawl underneath the bed
' Boris has caught a lot of buckshots, but he'll live
He's lying on the kitchen floor
Dimes stands over him
He has the sawed-off in his hand
Don't even give me an excuse, motherfucker
Dimes pats him down for other weapons, there are none
Wurlitzer puts the cuffs on Marvin and sits him down on the couch
Dimes looks in the bathroom and sees the dead Clarence with Alabama crying over him
Dimes walks over to Wurlitzer
Everything's under control here
Sorry about Nicholson
Me too
'm gonna go see what's goin' on outside
You do that
Wurlitzer exits
Dimes grabs the phone
Shotgun in hand, Lenny moves hurriedly down the lobby
Cop yells out
You
Stop
Lenny brings up his sawed-off and lets him have it
Other cops rush forward
Lenny grabs a woman standing by
Get back or 'll blow this bitch's brains to kingdom come
' Dimes on the phone talking with the department
Boris is still moving on the floor
Marvin is sitting on the couch with his hands cuffed behind his back
Alabama is crying over Clarence, then she feels something in his jacket
She reaches in and pulls out his
38
She wipes her eyes
She holds the gun in her hand and remembers Clarence saying: (off) She's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'
She carried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her waist, and the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes
Alabama Whitman is Pam Grier
Pray for forgiveness, Rated
for Ruthless Revenge
Alabama steps out of the bathroom, gun in hand
Marvin turns his head toward her
She shoots him twice
Dimes, still on the phone, spins around in time to see her raise her gun
She fires
He's hit in the head and flung to the floor
She sees Boris on the kitchen floor
Bye-bye, Boris
Good luck
You too, cutie
She starts to leave and then spots the briefcase full of money
She takes it and walks out the door
The elevator opens and Wurlitzer steps out
Alabama comes around the corner
Hey, you
Alabama shoots him three times in the belly
She steps into the elevator, the doors close
Alabama enters the lobby and proceeds to walk out
In the background, cops are all over the place and Lenny is still yelling with the woman hostage
wanna car here, takin' me to the airport, with a plane full of gas ready to take me to Kilimanjaro and
and a million bucks
(pause) Small bills
-   - Alabama puts the briefcase in the trunk
She gets into the Mustang and drives away
-  - Alabama's driving fast down the freeway
The  on the radio is trying to be funny
She's muttering to herself
could have walked away
told you that
told you  could have walked away
This is not my fault
did not do this
You did this one hundred percent to yourself
'm not gonna give you the satisfaction of feeling bad
should laugh 'cause you don't deserve any better
could get another guy like that
'm hot lookin'
What are you
Dead
Dumb jerk
Asshole
You're a asshole, you're a asshole, you're a asshole
You wanted it all, didn't ya
Didn't ya
Well watcha got now
You ain't got the money
You ain't got me
You ain't even got your body anymore
You got nothin'
Nada
Zip
Goose egg
Nil
Donut
The song "Little Arrows" by Leapy Lee comes on the radio
Alabama breaks down and starts crying
She pulls the car over to the side
The song continues
She wipes her eyes with a napkin that she pulls out her jacket
She tosses it on the dashboard
She picks up the
38 and sticks it in her mouth
She pulls back hammer
She looks up and sees her reflection in the rear-view mirror
She turns it the other way
She looks straight ahead
Her finger tightens on the trigger
She sees the napkin on the dashboard
She opens it up and reads it: "You're so cool"
She tosses the gun aside, opens up the trunk, and takes out the briefcase
She looks around for, and finally finds, the "Sgt
Fury" comic book Clarence bought her
And with comic book in one hand, and briefcase in the other, Bama walks away from the Mustang forever
